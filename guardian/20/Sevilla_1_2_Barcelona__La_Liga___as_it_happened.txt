So, Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> go back up to 
second after a terrific fightback, while Sevilla can take positives from the 
first half, despite tiring towards the end. The real winners were us, the 
viewing public, after a thrilling game of football that nobody bar the visiting 
players wanted to end. Thanks for joining me.Bye!

93 mins: A penalty shout from the home fans, as Umtiti hangs on to Correa’s 
arm. It would have been very harsh. Umtiti clears Vitolo’s cross, and time may 
be up...

92 mins: Sevilla win a free kick, which is pumped long into the area, but 
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> clear. The hosts try 
to build from the back, but Neymar breaks down the right. With Suárez in space, 
he takes a heavy touch, and Rico collects it.

88 mins: The frequent stoppages have taken the sting out of the game. 
Incidentally, that’s Neymar, Messi and Suárez all in the book, which can’t 
happen often.

87 mins: Suárez hauls down his man in an attempt to break through on goal, and 
is penalised. He should have been booked; this referee has been inconsistent, 
at best. Moments later, he is booked for dissent after being manhandled by 
Carriço. That’s the ninth yellow card of the match.

86 mins: Carriço is the latest name in the book for a weary challenge on 
Suárez (Luis). Suárez (Denis) brings down the free kick, but does so with his

83 mins: A farcical interlude as the referee books Messi for trying to put his 
boot back on without leaving the field. He gets booked, then huffs to the

77 mins: Umtiti wanders far enough upfield to have a wild shot from the edge

74 mins: Ter Stegen almost hands Sevilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> a lifeline, failing to deal with 
an outswinging corner and getting beaten to the ball by N’Zonzi, whose header 
bounces just wide!

71 mins: Barcelona slowing the pace now after the thrills and spills of the 
first hour. After sliding 30 passes all over the pitch, Messi picks out Neymar 
in the middle. His feathered through ball is latched onto by Suárez, who takes 
the ball around Rico – but just runs out of room, and fires wide! That would 
have been one for the archives.

69 mins: Sevilla have been a little ragged in this second half, the passes not 
quite connecting; this time, Rami’s diagonal pass is overhit, leaving Vietto 
frustrated.

67 mins: Ganso, summer signing and star of Rumour Mills 2010-2013, is on, 
replacing Vázquez. From the free kick, Nasri finds Sarabia, whose low cross has 
too much swazz for Nzonzi to handle.

59 mins: Messi almost stuns the home crowd into silence, shimmying into the

58 mins: Moments before, Rami hacked Busquets down, trying (and) failing to 
stop a counter-attack. The referee played advantage, and didn’t show the 
fortunate Rami a second yellow card.

53 mins: Sevilla grew more cautious as the first half went on, and Messi’s 
equaliser has left them in a tricky spot, unable to throw themselves forward 
with the same gusto as in the first half.

51 mins: Another lightning Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> counter, with Suarez bursting 
clear and finding Messi, who has Neymar in space to his left but fires a 
cross-shot that’s deflected behind.

49 mins: Barcelona, much livelier at the start of the second half, win a free 
kick as Mariano is booked. Messi’s ball drifts over to the right, and the 
return ball is grasped comfortably by Rico.

48 mins: At the other end, Nasri scampers into the area, collects Vitolo’s 
through ball and fires straight at Ter Stegen. Approximately five seconds 
later, Neymar dances down the left and pulls back to Rakitic, whose meaty 
effort is parried away by Rico.

47 mins: Denis Suárez thwacks the ball out wide to namesake Luis. His low 
cross is picked up by Messi, who confounds my half-time analysis by dallying, 
and getting robbed by Mariano.

At the risk of stating the obvious, Lionel Messi is  good at football  such an 
accurate finisher. I’m struggling to think of a game where he has let a chance, 
or even a couple of half-chances, go unpunished. Sevilla’s defence were five 
feet away from him as he shaped to shoot; they may as well have booted the ball 
in themselves.

37 mins: Neymar squares to Messi, 25 yards out, who tries a daisy-cutter that 
flashes six feet wide. It smacked of desperation, but we’ve seen him score from 
there many, many times.

36 mins: Roberto gets forward from right back and latches on to a long ball, 
crossing for Neymar. With defenders closing in, he rolls the ball to Messi, who 
can only thud into a wall of white shirts.

34 mins: Sarabia, making his first start since the loss to Athletic Bilbao in 
September, has been a constant threat. He links up with Vitolo, who has 
Escudero to his left – but his pass is just overhit.

So, Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> go back up to 
second after a terrific fightback, while Sevilla can take positives from the 
first half, despite tiring towards the end. The real winners were us, the 
viewing public, after a thrilling game of football that nobody bar the visiting 
players wanted to end. Thanks for joining me.Bye!
 
It’s all over, and Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> 
have grabbed a big win in a breathless match, thanks to goals from Lionel Messi 
and Luis Suárez.
 
93 mins: A penalty shout from the home fans, as Umtiti hangs on to Correa’s 
arm. It would have been very harsh. Umtiti clears Vitolo’s cross, and time may 
be up...
 
92 mins: Sevilla win a free kick, which is pumped long into the area, but 
Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> clear. The hosts try 
to build from the back, but Neymar breaks down the right. With Suárez in space, 
he takes a heavy touch, and Rico collects it.
 
90 mins: Three added minutes. The home crowd do not like that.
 
88 mins: The frequent stoppages have taken the sting out of the game. 
Incidentally, that’s Neymar, Messi and Suárez all in the book, which can’t 
happen often.
 
87 mins: Suárez hauls down his man in an attempt to break through on goal, and 
is penalised. He should have been booked; this referee has been inconsistent, 
at best. Moments later, he is booked for dissent after being manhandled by 
Carriço. That’s the ninth yellow card of the match.
 
86 mins: Carriço is the latest name in the book for a weary challenge on 
Suárez (Luis). Suárez (Denis) brings down the free kick, but does so with his 
hand. That’s his last act of the game – he’s replaced by Rafinha.
 
83 mins: A farcical interlude as the referee books Messi for trying to put his 
boot back on without leaving the field. He gets booked, then huffs to the 
touchline, spending a full three minutes waiting to come back on. In the 
meantime, Joaquin Correa comes on forSevilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla>, replacing the impressive 
Sarabia.
 
82 mins: Barcelona come back at the hosts, and N’Zonzi treads on Messi’s foot, 
forcing his boot off and earning a booking.
 
81 mins: Mariano reads a Neymar feint in enjoyable fashion, setting up a 
charge downfield – butSevilla <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla>, 
tiring after their Champions League exploits and first half endeavour, run out 
of steam.
 
79 mins: Sarabia works hard to earn a corner, but the delivery is poor, 
evading the big lads who had come up from the back.
 
77 mins: Umtiti wanders far enough upfield to have a wild shot from the edge 
of the area. This game has changed. Sampaoli is trying to change it back, 
bringing on Iborra for the fading Samir Nasri.
 
75 mins: Barcelona let Sevilla <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> 
off the hook, Neymar crossing for Suárez, who fires his shot too close to 
Sergio Rico.
 
An email!

“The home crowd’s been singing the tune from Gala’s Freed from Desire,” says 
Kári Tulinius. “I wonder who’s on fire and terrifying defenses in the 
Sánchez-Pizjuán. Vietto’s on fire? Vitolo’s on fire? Or are they willing the 
club tosign Will Grigg <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw-yqqvkyDM>?”
 
74 mins: Ter Stegen almost hands Sevilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> a lifeline, failing to deal with 
an outswinging corner and getting beaten to the ball by N’Zonzi, whose header 
bounces just wide!
 
73 mins: André Gomes is on for Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, replacing Rakitic.
 
71 mins: Barcelona slowing the pace now after the thrills and spills of the 
first hour. After sliding 30 passes all over the pitch, Messi picks out Neymar 
in the middle. His feathered through ball is latched onto by Suárez, who takes 
the ball around Rico – but just runs out of room, and fires wide! That would 
have been one for the archives.
 
69 mins: Sevilla have been a little ragged in this second half, the passes not 
quite connecting; this time, Rami’s diagonal pass is overhit, leaving Vietto 
frustrated.
 
67 mins: Ganso, summer signing and star of Rumour Mills 2010-2013, is on, 
replacing Vázquez. From the free kick, Nasri finds Sarabia, whose low cross has 
too much swazz for Nzonzi to handle.
 
66 mins: Suárez’s pass to Neymar is underhit, and Mariano intercepts before 
striding upfield.Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are 
short at the back, and Digne hauls his fellow full-back down, earning a booking 
in the process.
 
64 mins: Sevilla’s unbeaten home record very much at risk now, but perhaps 
it’ll focus their minds; they have seemed unsure whether to stick or twist 
since half time. Sarabia gets two chances to cross from the right-hand byline, 
but can’t find a team-mate, andBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> clear.
 
62 mins: Barcelona have dominated the second half, and after Suárez takes the 
ball from Carriço, Messi charges through theSevilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> midfield, then picks out Suárez 
on the right of the area. He takes a touch and fires low, inside Rico’s near 
post.
 
This has been coming. Luis Suárez gives Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> the lead!
 
59 mins: Messi almost stuns the home crowd into silence, shimmying into the 
middle past several bewildered defenders, but lifting the ball over the bar! 
Honestly, he can’t hit a barn door, this lad.
 
58 mins: Moments before, Rami hacked Busquets down, trying (and) failing to 
stop a counter-attack. The referee played advantage, and didn’t show the 
fortunate Rami a second yellow card.
 
57 mins: Denis Suárez plays it forward to Messi, who tries to return the 
favour with a threaded through pass that’s just too long.
 
55 mins: Mascherano has held the Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> defence together at times, and 
stops a Sevilla attack with a perfectly-timed block tackle on Vitolo, who was 
threatening to break free on the left.
 
54 mins: Suárez, who has come into this game like a wrecking ball – there’s an 
up-to-date reference – backheels into the path of Messi, who takes a touch and 
curls a shot towards the top corner. Rico does well to palm it over.
 
53 mins: Sevilla grew more cautious as the first half went on, and Messi’s 
equaliser has left them in a tricky spot, unable to throw themselves forward 
with the same gusto as in the first half.
 
51 mins: Another lightning Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> counter, with Suarez bursting 
clear and finding Messi, who has Neymar in space to his left but fires a 
cross-shot that’s deflected behind.
 
49 mins: Barcelona, much livelier at the start of the second half, win a free 
kick as Mariano is booked. Messi’s ball drifts over to the right, and the 
return ball is grasped comfortably by Rico.
 
48 mins: At the other end, Nasri scampers into the area, collects Vitolo’s 
through ball and fires straight at Ter Stegen. Approximately five seconds 
later, Neymar dances down the left and pulls back to Rakitic, whose meaty 
effort is parried away by Rico.
 
47 mins: Denis Suárez thwacks the ball out wide to namesake Luis. His low 
cross is picked up by Messi, who confounds my half-time analysis by dallying, 
and getting robbed by Mariano.
 
We’re back under way.
 
At the risk of stating the obvious, Lionel Messi is  good at football  such an 
accurate finisher. I’m struggling to think of a game where he has let a chance, 
or even a couple of half-chances, go unpunished. Sevilla’s defence were five 
feet away from him as he shaped to shoot; they may as well have booted the ball 
in themselves.

The dreaded active/inactive offside debate has returned in the Premier League, 
with Chelsea and Arsenal goals under the microscope this weekend. Sevilla could 
have had a case there, with Rakitic (I think) jumping out of the way of Messi’s 
shot from an offside position. There wasn’t much in the way of an appeal from
Sevilla <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla>.
 
Sevilla will wonder how they’re only level after dominating that half, but a 
pinpoint Lionel Messi strike has broughtBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> right back into the game.
 
44 mins: Sergi Roberto is booked for pulling back Vitolo. There will be no 
added time in this breathless first half.
 
43 mins: Messi launches a counter attack from deep with a raking ball to 
Neymar, who slaloms past two defenders, and pulls the ball back to Messi, 20 
yards out. He has to find the very bottom corner to beat Rico, and does.
 
That’s 27 goals for Lionel Messi against Sevilla, and from nowhere, Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are level.
 
41 mins: Whistles from the crowd as Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> hog the ball, but Sevilla, 
packed into their own half, spring out, Vietto moving forward and eventually 
finding Mariano on the right. They hold the ball up until Vitolo skips into 
space, and fires a shot low beyond the far post.
 
39 mins: Suárez is on the right of the front three, with Messi free in the 
middle – it hasn’t really worked so far.Sevilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sevilla> have slowed down from that 
frantic start, with half time approaching.

37 mins: Neymar squares to Messi, 25 yards out, who tries a daisy-cutter that 
flashes six feet wide. It smacked of desperation, but we’ve seen him score from 
there many, many times.
 
36 mins: Roberto gets forward from right back and latches on to a long ball, 
crossing for Neymar. With defenders closing in, he rolls the ball to Messi, who 
can only thud into a wall of white shirts.
 
34 mins: Sarabia, making his first start since the loss to Athletic Bilbao in 
September, has been a constant threat. He links up with Vitolo, who has 
Escudero to his left – but his pass is just overhit.
