The Checkatrade Trophy, which suffered serious attendance drops of 20% for the 
first set of matches in August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/checkatrade-trophy-sees-attendances-fall-as-the-bteamboycott-bites>
, has come under further scrutiny after the Bradford goalkeeper Colin Doyle was 
substituted three minutes into the game against Bury on Tuesday night. “I 
thought he had a poor 45 seconds,” said the assistant manager Kenny Black after 
Bradford’s 2-1 victory, in a direct snub to the new rules introduced this 
season for the re-formatted Football League tournament which now features 
Under-23 academy sides from Premier League and Championship clubs.

Clubs must field five ‘first-team’ players – five who played in the team’s 
last league match, five who will play in the next league game or the club’s 
five highest appearance-makers this season. Doyle had started forBradford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bradford> last Saturday against 
Chesterfield, but with the manager Stuart McCall keen on giving the substitute 
Rouven Sattelmaier some game time, switched his keepers quickly.

Fans are continuing to boycott the competition, with Portsmouth recording 
their lowest crowd of the post-War era as 1,355 spectators watched their 2-2 
draw with Reading Under-23s. The lowest attendance of the night was at Barnet, 
where 457 people watched the game with Norwich Under-23s while Port Vale 
recorded the second-lowest crowd in the club’s history.

The Football League seems sure to look into events at Bradford, but speaking 
before Tuesday’s games Dan Ashworth, the technical director of the Football 
Association, defended the changes: “The principle of revamping theCheckatrade 
Trophy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/johnstones-paint-trophy> has been 
excellent,” he said. “The youth-development programme is excellent right 
through to the age of 18. However, there is a void to fill and we need to get 
our younger players experience to bridge the gap between youth and senior 
football.

“The slightly different concept to the Checkatrade Trophy gives our young 
players potentially up to six or seven senior games playing in an open-age 
competition against seasoned professionals. It gets them understanding and 
experiencing the importance of winning. Results are not as important at youth 
level compared to senior football, when there is something riding on every 
game.”

The MK Dons manager, Karl Robinson, is one who is not impressed 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37540062> with the inclusion of 16 sides 
with Category One academies in a competition previously known as the 
Johnstone’s Paint Trophy. “How can we have a development trophy for Premier 
League teams who can do what they want yet we can’t develop our own players in 
it?” Robinson told the BBC.

“I think the rules need to change drastically, or don’t have the competition. 
I don’t think it is conducive to development any more. I think it’s rubbish. If 
they made this an open competition where we could all play our under-21s, play 
players to get fit, close half the stands, and make it more of a competition 
for development.

“Don’t make it just a development competition for Premier League teams when 
clubs like us work so hard to develop our own players.”
