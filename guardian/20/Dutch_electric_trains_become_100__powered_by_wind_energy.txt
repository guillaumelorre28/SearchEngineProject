Dutch electricity company Eneco won a tender offered by NS two years ago and 
the two companies signed a 10-year deal setting January 2018 as the date by 
which all NS trains should run on wind energy.

“So we in fact reached our goal a year earlier than planned,” said Boon, 
adding that an increase in the number of wind farms across the country and off 
the coast of theNetherlands <https://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands> had 
helped NS achieve its aim.

Eneco and NS said on a joint website that around 600,000 passengers daily are 
“the first in the world” to travel thanks to wind energy. NS operates about 
5,500 train trips a day.

One windmill running for an hour can power a train for 120 miles, the 
companies said. They hope to reduce the energy used per passenger by a further 
35% by 2020 compared with 2005.
