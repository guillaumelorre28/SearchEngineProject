Crystal Palace hope to fend off competition from Championship rivals to sign 
Jamie Vardy fromFleetwood Town 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fleetwood-town>, before loaning the 
striker back to the Conference side for the rest of this season. Blackpool, 
Leicester City, Southampton, West Ham United and both halves of the Old Firm 
have been linked with Â£700,000 offers for the 25-year-old. Vardy's prolific 
scoring form has seen him the subject of a rejected bid from Blackpool, whose 
manager, Ian Holloway, has now turned his attention back towards Celtic's Paddy 
McCourt. Fleetwood are in the hunt for promotion to the Football League and 
want to retain Vardy's services until May. The Carling Cup semi-finalists are 
thought to be willing to agree a deal to let that happen.

Palace look certain to have the funds with their 20-year-old defender 
Nathaniel Clyne set to move to the Premier League.
