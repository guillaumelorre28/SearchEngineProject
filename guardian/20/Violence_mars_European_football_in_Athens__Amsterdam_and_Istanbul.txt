A series of violent clashes between football fans across Europe have led to 
injuries and several arrests in Athens, Amsterdam and Istanbul.

Greek police say at least six people have been hospitalised and 10 detained 
after rival fans from Serbia and Croatia clashed using chains, baseball bats 
and knucklesdusters at Athens airport.

The fighting occurred on Thursday following the Champions League match between 
Olympiakos andDinamo Zagreb <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dinamozagreb>

The Serbian fans had travelled to Athens to support Olympiakos and took part 
in the clashes, most dressed in black and wearing hoods. Olympiakos won the 
Group F game2-1
