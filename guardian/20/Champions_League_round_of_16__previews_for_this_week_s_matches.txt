Paris Saint-Germain v Chelsea

In a repeat of last season’s quarter-final, Chelsea will be looking for 
revenge over French championsParis Saint-Germain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain> after being dumped out by 
Laurent Blanc’s team on away goals. Both meetings between the teams last year 
ended in draws and that’s a result Chelsea have become accustomed to under 
interim manager Guus Hiddink. Their 5-1 win over Newcastle at the weekend did 
not fit the pattern of their recent performances. They drew six of their first 
eight league matches under Hiddink, who has made Chelsea hard to beat.

They have lost just once in 33 matches during Hiddink’s two stints at Stamford 
Bridge, though they’ll have to make do with a makeshift back four in Paris. 
John Terry was injured at the weekend, joining Kurt Zouma on the sidelines, so 
Branislav Ivanovic is likely to join Gary Cahill at centre-back, withBaba Rahman
 <https://www.whoscored.com/Players/114845/> coming in at left-back. The young 
Ghanaian has occasionally looked shaky in his brief playing time but he has 
saved his best performances for the Champions League, earning a strong rating 
of 7.62 across three appearances in the competition.

With Nemanja Matic suspended, Chelsea’s defence could be exposed further, 
which is far from ideal against this Paris Saint-Germain attack. In a league 
where competition has proven hard to come by, despite being held to a stalemate 
with Lille at the weekend, they have steamrolled their way to the top. They are 
unbeaten after 26 league matches and have only dropped eight points from a 
possible 78.Zlatan Ibrahimovic 
<https://www.whoscored.com/Players/3281/Show/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic> is still 
making light work of France’s top flight, despite his advancing years – he has 
scored 21 goals and provided eight assists – whileAngel di María 
<https://www.whoscored.com/Players/23110> has also been in sparkling form (7.96 
rating) with a point to prove after a forgettable spell in England. His tussle 
with Rahman may prove the key individual battle of the night.

These clubs are meeting for the fifth time in four years in the Champions 
League. Zenit have had the better of the fixtures, winning three, but Benfica’s 
one victory in that time proved the most decisive with an injury time goal from 
Nelson Oliveira – now of Nottingham Forest – taking the Portuguese club through 
on away goals at this stage of the competition in 2012. The man of the match on 
that day wasAxel Witsel <https://www.whoscored.com/Players/25191/>, who has 
since switched between the two clubs.

André Villas-Boas has confirmed he will be leaving Zenit at the end of a 
bitterly disappointing league campaign. Last season’s Russian Premier League 
champions sit fourth, having won just three of their last 12 matches, and will 
again rely on star manHulk <https://www.whoscored.com/Players/16886>. The 
Brazilian earned the second highest group stage rating (8.79), courtesy of 
three goals and four assists, but will have to cope with abuse from the home 
support due to his Porto past.

Benfica <https://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica> suffered their first 
defeat in 15 league matches against Hulk’s old employers on Friday but they 
have been in sensational form lately, picking up 40 points from a possible 42 
before that defeat to Porto. They will be strong favourites as a result, with 
all eyes on sought-after 18-year-old midfielder Renato Sanches, who secured an 
excellent rating of 7.41 across his two group stage appearances.

Real Madrid were dumped out of the Champions League by Roma at this stage of 
the competition back in 2008, but they will be heavy favourites to turn the 
tables this time around. Roma, now back under the management of Luciano 
Spalletti, are on a four-game winning streak in the league, but in matches 
against strong opposition in recent years they have been found wanting to say 
the least. They qualified for the knockout stages despite winning just one 
game, and onlyMalmo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/nov/25/malmo-life-after-zlatan-ibrahimovic-video>
 conceded more goals than Roma in the group stages (16).

That no side scored more goals than Real Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> (19) will be a concern for 
the hosts, with Zinedine Zidane set to embark upon the truest test of his 
credentials. The visitors will be without Gareth Bale once more but, while 
Cristiano Ronaldo has at times flattered to deceive in La Liga, he led the 
group stage scoring charts with 11, while Karim Benzema has had a direct hand 
in 18 goals in his last 12 appearances.

If Mo Salah passes a fitness test he may be the key man for the hosts on the 
counterattack. He comes into the game on the back of a man of the match display 
against Carpi at the weekend, when he scored a goal and provided two assists. 
Roma’s best hope is to use their pace on the break. They have been severely 
punished for attempting to go toe-to-toe with heavyweights, losing 6-1 and 7-1 
to Barcelona and Bayern in the last two seasons, so will need to defend a lot 
better against Madrid.

Undeniably the least glamorous fixture of the round, the battle between Gent 
and Wolfsburg should still be an intriguing affair. Having reached theChampions 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> for the first 
time in their history, Gent were the surprise package of the group stages, 
winning their last three matches to secure safe passage with room to spare. 
Hein Vanhaezebrouck has every right to feel his side could go even further in 
the competition too, up against a Wolfsburg team that have been bitterly 
disappointing following the sale of star man Kevin De Bruyne last summer.

Dieter Hecking led Wolfsburg to an unlikely title challenge last season but 
they now find themselves in eighth place and 26 points adrift of Bayern Munich 
thanks to their woeful away record this season. They have won just one away 
match in the league all season, so should be considered underdogs against the 
tournament’s outstanding underdogs this week.

Without suspended centre-back Naldo – not only the team’s highest rated player 
(7.53) but the only man to score more than once for Wolfsburg in the group 
stages – holding midfielder Josuha Guilavogui and first-choice goalkeeper Diego 
Benaglio, Wolfsburg are vulnerable. Young keeper Koen Casteels will replace the 
latter on a return to his homeland having began his career with Gent’s Pro 
League rivals Genk.

For the hosts, targetman Laurent Depoitre has attracted plenty of interest from
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> clubs, 
while Danijel Milicevic and Sven Kums are the key men in the midfield. 
Elsewhere a point of interest will be how Gent choose to line up, with all of 
their wins in the group stages coming when they switched to a back three.
