“Jack indicated to me his deep regret for causing any embarrassment to the 
government and apologised.

“One lapse of judgement does not detract from the fact that Jack has been an 
outstanding staff member, a significant contributor to my office since late 
2013 and I believe he will have a bright future.”

Pyne said the 26-year-old policy adviser had been an “outstanding staff 
member” and he believed he had a bright future.

“I feel sorry for Jack Walker,” Senator Mathias Cormann told Sky News on 
Sunday, and wished him all the best for the future..


“By all accounts he was a very good staffer who had a lapse of judgment 
overseas and on the face of it has paid a high price.”

Last Sunday Walker and eight friends attended the Grand Prix in Sepang

and celebrated Australian Daniel Ricciardo’s win by stripping down to their 
budgie smugglers emblazoned with the Malaysian flag.

Malaysian authorities were not amused the the nine men spent four nights in 
jail before being cautioned and released.

Walker’s resignation came after the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said he 
needed to have a “very hard look at himself”.
