Well, what a horrible experience for Granit Xhaka. His penalty was among the 
worst you’ll ever see. It went way, way west. It’s a pity that we’ll see n more 
of Shaqiri in this tournament as he arrived in style and was the best player by 
a mile in the second half and extra-time. As forPoland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/poland>, they were solid agains and full 
of character. If Lewandowski ever turns up, they will be very tricky opponents 
for whoever they face. Right, I have to shoot off. Thanks for you emails and 
tweets. We’ll always have that Shaqiri goal won’t we?

Poland are into the quarter-finals!

Poland win 5-4 on penalties! Grzegorz Krychowiak keeps his head and finds the 
corner. Five brilliant, nerveless spot-kicks.

Fabianski has been in great form today, so strong and the busier keeper late 
in the game. Could it be that he is the matchwinner?

deflection on the way through and ends up at the feet of the full-back, who 
can’t shift his body to get a shot away and allows Sommer to clear.

ET117 min: It’s that man Derdiyok again! Seferovic gets on to the end of a 
long ball played into the left channel and wraps his foot round a cross towards 
Derdiyok that bounces awkwardly in front of him meaning he can only watch it 
bounce off his knee and fall into Fabianski’s hands.

other overhead kicks. Is the Shaqiri one better than Trev’s?” writes Dave 
Grinnell. It’s good but that Trev one is something else. Shaqiri runs him close 
though.

ET113 min: What a pass from Shaqiri! What a save from Fabianski! The little 
man, who has come to life in dramatic fashion, dinks a delicious little ball 
over the Swiss defence to Derdiyok on the back post, who heads at goal from 
eight yards out and forces a wonderful reaction stop from Fabianski.

ET110 min: Lewandowski is fouled about three times in one passage of play, 
eventually winning a free-kick for a fourth foul that wasn’t by Shaqiri. The 
attack leads to nothing.
Hubert O'Hearn (@BTBReviews) 
@GreggBakowski <https://twitter.com/GreggBakowski> Man, Lewandowski's eaten 
more grass today than a herd of dairy cattle.

ET108 min: Glik heads behind for a corner. Not a good idea against Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>. The first is cleared 
behind. The second is cleared out. But the ball breaks to Shaqiri, who shows 
wonderful skill, as though he hasn’t got 108 minutes’ worth of football in his 
legs, bamboozling his marker and forcing another corner with a little cross to 
the near post.

ET104 min: Peszko, who as just come on for Grosicki, takes little time in 
getting involved, dragging down Lichtsteiner after the full-back showed the 
first bit of attacking intent in the past 10 minutes. The resulting free-kick

ET98 min: Either Lewandowski overhits a pass or Piszczek checks his run. 
Either way aPoland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/poland> move reaches a 
disappointing end. Here’s an email from Kári Tulinius: “Normally I can’t stand 
the Swiss team, as no dull football is as dull as when the Swiss are involved. 
Rote and annoying, they’re like a cuckoo clock that shits on your head. 
However, any team with Xherdan “Power Cube” Shaqiri is capable of moments of 
transcendence. I hope he goes back to Shaqiri so I can go back to my irrational 
grudge against the Swiss team.”

move. He picks it up again and jinks into the box on teh left, where he tries 
to score another sensational goal by chipping Fabianski from 12 yards. He 
doesn’t, getting under it and sending it over. He has stones that lad.

ET93 min: Poland are passing the ball around in the sterile fashion. 
Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> are letting them 
do so. Yup, not much going on here.

sliding through him, winning the ball and making a point.

Peep!

ET 90 min: Poland get us underway. Derdiyok is fouled for Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>. Rodriguez lofts it into the 
Poland penalty area but it’s headed clear. Poland have been solid but they 
tired dramatically at the end of that second half. Doesn’t bode well for them.

A selection of your reactions to Shaqiri's goal …

“Gooooooooooooooooooool! Feel the Bern!” – Andy Gordon. 

“Bicycle kicks don’t lie” – Marie Meyer.

“Did that just happen?! That’s the best volley since Ronnie Whelan’s effort 
against the USSR in ’88. Okay then, APART FROM Van Basten’s in the final that 
year!” – Justin Kavanagh.


“As good as Rivaldo’s goal was, this was better. The ball wasn’t controlled by 
Shaqiri before hitting it and he had to stretch and contort to produce a 
scissor kick to a ball moving away fro the goal. Rivaldo’s goal was one where 
you applauded but Shaqiri’s makes you laugh and swear because you just cannot 
believe that someone had the thought to do that let alone being able to 
actually do it. It was a ridiculous scissor kick” – Neil Mackie.
Hubert O'Hearn (@BTBReviews) 
@GreggBakowski <https://twitter.com/GreggBakowski> Shaqirir's goal was as 
beautiful as any you'll ever see. It will be shown in slo-mo with symphonic 
music for years of intros

Well, what a horrible experience for Granit Xhaka. His penalty was among the 
worst you’ll ever see. It went way, way west. It’s a pity that we’ll see n more 
of Shaqiri in this tournament as he arrived in style and was the best player by 
a mile in the second half and extra-time. As forPoland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/poland>, they were solid agains and full 
of character. If Lewandowski ever turns up, they will be very tricky opponents 
for whoever they face. Right, I have to shoot off. Thanks for you emails and 
tweets. We’ll always have that Shaqiri goal won’t we?
 
Poland win 5-4 on penalties! Grzegorz Krychowiak keeps his head and finds the 
corner. Five brilliant, nerveless spot-kicks.

So, it looks like the penalties will be taken in front of the end where the 
Swiss fans are gathered. I’m nervous. Penalties just make me jittery. 
 
Fabianski has been in great form today, so strong and the busier keeper late 
in the game. Could it be that he is the matchwinner?
 
Well, it was always going to be wasn’t it? 
 
ET118 min: Piszczek is played through by Krychowiak, whose pass takes a 
deflection on the way through and ends up at the feet of the full-back, who 
can’t shift his body to get a shot away and allows Sommer to clear.
 
ET117 min: It’s that man Derdiyok again! Seferovic gets on to the end of a 
long ball played into the left channel and wraps his foot round a cross towards 
Derdiyok that bounces awkwardly in front of him meaning he can only watch it 
bounce off his knee and fall into Fabianski’s hands.
 
ET116 min: “I’ve always thought that Trevor Sinclair’s overhead kick 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVcIR6ftJuk> was the one which killed all 
other overhead kicks. Is the Shaqiri one better than Trev’s?” writes Dave 
Grinnell. It’s good but that Trev one is something else. Shaqiri runs him close 
though.
 
ET 115 min: Derdiyok wallops a free-kick towards the Pyrenees. Not a good 
couple of minutes from the Swiss striker there. I’d have Shaqiri doing 
everything right now. Did Swiss media really question his fitness?
 
ET113 min: What a pass from Shaqiri! What a save from Fabianski! The little 
man, who has come to life in dramatic fashion, dinks a delicious little ball 
over the Swiss defence to Derdiyok on the back post, who heads at goal from 
eight yards out and forces a wonderful reaction stop from Fabianski.

ET 112 min: Pazdan is booked for a foul on Derdiyok. 
 
ET110 min: Lewandowski is fouled about three times in one passage of play, 
eventually winning a free-kick for a fourth foul that wasn’t by Shaqiri. The 
attack leads to nothing.

@GreggBakowski <https://twitter.com/GreggBakowski> Man, Lewandowski's eaten 
more grass today than a herd of dairy cattle.

<https://twitter.com/BTBReviews/status/746725010245619712>  
ET108 min: Glik heads behind for a corner. Not a good idea against Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>. The first is cleared 
behind. The second is cleared out. But the ball breaks to Shaqiri, who shows 
wonderful skill, as though he hasn’t got 108 minutes’ worth of football in his 
legs, bamboozling his marker and forcing another corner with a little cross to 
the near post.
 
ET107 min: Shaqiri is bright and inventive, popping a couple of passes left 
and right and eventually finding Embolo on the right, but the teenager is 
tackled well on the run.
 
ET105 min: Switzerland cause a little panic at the back after a ball into the 
box is deflected towards Embolo but Pazdan, who has been very, very good, 
hammers the ball clear on the volley.
 
This is heading for penalties. 
 
ET104 min: Peszko, who as just come on for Grosicki, takes little time in 
getting involved, dragging down Lichtsteiner after the full-back showed the 
first bit of attacking intent in the past 10 minutes. The resulting free-kick 
comes to nought.
 
ET102 min: Nothing is happening here. So here’s Conor Murphy: “Xherdan 
Shaqiri’s goal: nice but could he do it on a rainy night in …” Honk!
 
ET100 min: And there it is. Maczynski drops to the floor due to cramp and 
Jodlowiec replaces him.
 
ET99 min: I’m pretty sure Poland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/poland> 
haven’t made a substitution yet. Extraordinary. They have 22 legs chock full of 
lactic acid out there.

ET98 min: Either Lewandowski overhits a pass or Piszczek checks his run. 
Either way aPoland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/poland> move reaches a 
disappointing end. Here’s an email from Kári Tulinius: “Normally I can’t stand 
the Swiss team, as no dull football is as dull as when the Swiss are involved. 
Rote and annoying, they’re like a cuckoo clock that shits on your head. 
However, any team with Xherdan “Power Cube” Shaqiri is capable of moments of 
transcendence. I hope he goes back to Shaqiri so I can go back to my irrational 
grudge against the Swiss team.”
 
ET97 min: Poland have possession but they don’t appear to have anyone with the 
legs to do anything with it. Djourou clears a cross from the left andPoland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/poland> pick up possession once more.
 
ET95 min: Shaqiri threads a ball through to Seferovic and then gets on the 
move. He picks it up again and jinks into the box on teh left, where he tries 
to score another sensational goal by chipping Fabianski from 12 yards. He 
doesn’t, getting under it and sending it over. He has stones that lad.

ET93 min: Poland are passing the ball around in the sterile fashion. 
Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> are letting them 
do so. Yup, not much going on here.
 
ET 92 min: Pazdan makes a fine macho tackle on Derdiyok over by the touchline, 
sliding through him, winning the ball and making a point.
 
ET 90 min: Poland get us underway. Derdiyok is fouled for Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>. Rodriguez lofts it into the 
Poland penalty area but it’s headed clear. Poland have been solid but they 
tired dramatically at the end of that second half. Doesn’t bode well for them.
 
“Gooooooooooooooooooool! Feel the Bern!” – Andy Gordon. 

“Bicycle kicks don’t lie” – Marie Meyer.

“Did that just happen?! That’s the best volley since Ronnie Whelan’s effort 
against the USSR in ’88. Okay then, APART FROM Van Basten’s in the final that 
year!” – Justin Kavanagh.


“As good as Rivaldo’s goal was, this was better. The ball wasn’t controlled by 
Shaqiri before hitting it and he had to stretch and contort to produce a 
scissor kick to a ball moving away fro the goal. Rivaldo’s goal was one where 
you applauded but Shaqiri’s makes you laugh and swear because you just cannot 
believe that someone had the thought to do that let alone being able to 
actually do it. It was a ridiculous scissor kick” – Neil Mackie.
