Edinson Cavani scored twice but it was not enough to prevent the champions, 
Paris St-Germain, dropping their first Ligue 1 points of the season at home to
Bordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bordeaux>.

Cavani gave PSG the lead in the 27th minute when he sent a right-foot shot 
high into the net. Wahbi Khazri laid on the equaliser three minutes later as 
his cross was met by Henri Saivet’s head six yards out.

PSG went back in front after 34 minutes when the Uruguay striker Cavani found 
the top corner from a free-kick.

Saivet was then sent off for a second bookable offence in the 77th minute but 
Bordeaux’s 10 men fought back to level through Khazri a minute later.

PSG are still top with 13 points from five matches while Bordeaux occupy ninth 
position on six points. PSG launch their Champions League campaign with a home 
game against Malmo of Sweden on Tuesday.
