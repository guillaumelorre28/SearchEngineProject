Party properly with a vintage up-do. It seems like every catwalk, from Dries 
Van Noten to Opening Ceremony, had a version of 1920s finger waves. Marc 
Jacobs’s were heavily lacquered with unfinished ends, while Stella McCartney’s 
were soft and infinitely wearable, worn with a little low ponytail. If you 
don’t have the electric tools, just add product to damp hair, then curl the 
front section with your fingers. Clip in place, then leave to dry for perfect 
party glamour.
