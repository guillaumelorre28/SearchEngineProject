Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain> dropped points for only 
the fourth time in the league this season when they were held at home by Lille 
on Saturday.

PSG host Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday and their 
coach, Laurent Blanc, clearly had that game in mind as he left Zlatan 
Ibrahimovic out of his squad.

But PSG still fielded a strong side with Edinson Cavani leading the attack and 
missing two good chances.

PSG, who had won 16 consecutive games in all competitions heading into the 
match, last failed to win a league game on 1 December, a goalless draw away to 
Angers.

It makes little difference as second-placed Monaco trail by 25 points before 
their trip to Saint-Etienne on Sunday.

Jean-Kévin Augustin replaced Ibrahimovic in attack and had a good chance in 
the ninth minute after being set up by winger Ángel di María but Lille’s 
goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama, palmed away his low shot.

Enyeama made a good save to stop Di María’s toe-poke in the 37th minute, and 
theLille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lille> midfielder Rio Mavuba was 
the next to rescue his side as he headed Layvin Kurzawa’s header off the line 
four minutes later.

But Cavani should have done better in the 57th minute when Enyeama flapped at 
Blaise Matuidi’s cross from the left. The ball fell to Cavani but he failed to 
hit the target.

Cavani had another chance with five minutes to go after midfielder Benjamin 
Stambouli picked him out in the penalty area but Enyeama thwarted him.
