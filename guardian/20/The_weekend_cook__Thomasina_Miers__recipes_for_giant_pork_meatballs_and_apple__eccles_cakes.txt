As the days get shorter, I am reminded of the food we ate as children after 
coming home from school in the dark. My mother often made meatballs from the 
mince that was a stalwart of her weekly shop, and I loved to shape them for 
her. These days, I make larger ones than she did, mainly because it’s quicker. 
The recipe is simple but incredibly good, packed with herbs and cheese.

Eccles cakes are another dish I’m often inspired to make after a trip home. In 
recent years, bothSt John <https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/smithfield/> in 
London andPump Street Bakery <http://www.pumpstreetbakery.com> in Orford, 
Suffolk, have reinvigorated the traditional recipe, making it even more 
mouth-watering. Do give them a whirl: you’ll be in for a treat.

Giant pork meatballs in tomato sauce

I rinse the sauce off the tomatoes, to get rid of that tinny flavour, but use 
them just as they are, if you prefer. The shaped meatballs will benefit from 
20-30 minutes in the fridge, but don’t worry if you’re pushed for time. Serves 
four.

3 tbsp olive oil
3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced
3 400g cans plum tomatoes, drained
2 bay leaves
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp capers, rinsed of brine or salt
1-2 pinches brown sugar (optional)

For the meatball
600g minced pork
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
1 tbsp fresh sage leaves, finely chopped 
1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped 
1 small sprig fresh rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped
60g fresh breadcrumbs
Zest of 1 lemon
1 heaped tbsp Dijon mustard
1 egg, beaten
1 tbsp olive oil
70g grated Parmesan

Make the tomato sauce first. Warm the oil in a deep pan on a medium-low heat, 
then gently fry the garlic just until it begins to colour at the edges. Add the 
tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, then stir in the bay leaves, season 
generously and leave to simmer gently for 45 minutes. Half an hour into the 
cooking, add the capers and taste the sauce – add a pinch or two of brown 
sugar, if you think it needs it, and a few tablespoons of water if the sauce 
looks too thick and dry. By the end, it should be thick and silky.

While the sauce is cooking, get on with the meatballs. In a bowl, combine all 
the ingredients except the oil and half the Parmesan, season generously, then 
mix with your hands until well amalgamated. Heat a little oil in a large frying 
pan, then saute a teaspoon of the mix until cooked and check it’s seasoned 
sufficiently. Shape the remaining meatball mix into eight balls then, if you 
have time, refrigerate them for 20-30 minutes, to firm up.

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Pour the remaining oil into the frying 
pan, heat over a medium-high flame, then lightly brown the meatballs on all 
sides. Transfer to a baking dish just large enough to hold them, pour on the 
sauce and toss gently to coat. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake for 
20 minutes, until firm to the touch.

Serve with wide pasta ribbons, perhaps with a rocket and parmesan salad on the 
side, dressed simply with extra-virgin olive oil and a squeeze of fresh lemon. 
Or, for a real treat, eat the meatballs on toast.

Use all-butter puff pastry, not the stuff made with other fats, and you’ll 
have almost as gorgeous an eccles cake as you would if you’d made them with 
homemade pastry. Makes about 16.

50g very soft butter, plus 1 knob extra
100g dark brown muscovado sugar
100g currants
4 eating apples, cored, peeled and coarsely grated
½ tsp freshly ground nutmeg
1 tsp freshly ground allspice
A few pinches ground cinnamon
3 tbsp cider vinegar (or brandy)
2 375g blocks ready-made puff pastry, chilled
1 egg, beaten
40g caster sugar

Combine the butter, sugar, currants, apples, spices and vinegar in a bowl, 
leave to sit for 10 minutes, then strain through a sieve into a saucepan, 
squeezing out the juices. Add a pinch of salt to the apple mix.

Heat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Roll out the pastry to about 5mm thick 
and use a 10cm cookie cutter to cut out as many circles as you can (you should 
get about eight from each block). Spoon heaped tablespoons of apple mix into 
the centre of each pastry circle, then bring up the sides of the pastry over 
the top of the filling and pinch together the edges to seal. Flatten each cake 
by pressing it down firmly with a palm, turn over so the folds are at the 
bottom, then slash the top of each cake two or three times and brush all over 
with beaten egg. Put on a chilled baking tray, then put in the freezer for 30 
minutes, to chill.

You can now bag them and leave them in the freezer, to be cooked frozen 
whenever you want (just remove however many you want, brush again with beaten 
egg and cook as below, allowing a little longer in the oven because they’ll be 
frozen solid to start with). To cook them straight away, brush with more egg, 
sprinkle with sugar and bake for 15 minutes, until golden and crisp. Leave the 
cakes to cool slightly and, while they are resting, simmer the juices for five 
to 10 minutes, until they’ve reduced to a rich caramel. Stir in the extra knob 
of butter and serve with the warm cakes.

And for the rest of the week…

I often make the meatballs in large batches, but only go as far as browning 
them before freezing them with their sauce in small bags, all ready to be baked 
straight from frozen – it’s a great timesaving meal for the children. The sauce 
also works in lasagne, with plain pasta or in moussaka; or add some warming 
Middle Eastern spices and use it for baked eggs and peppers, or with spiced 
lamb dishes. I always keep good-quality puff pastry in the freezer, because it 
makes great impromptu weekend pizza bases.
