Espanyol supporters smuggled a pig’s head into the Estadi Cornellà-El Prat 
stadium to throw at Gerard Piqué during a fraughtCopa del Rey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa-del-rey> derby with Barcelona on 
Wednesday night.

Barcelona won the match 2-0

 to complete a 6-1 aggregate victory following astormy first leg

 at the Camp Nou last week which had seen Lionel Messi stamped on and Luis 
Suárez suspended for his part in a fracas – and the second tie was just as 
ill-tempered.

A group of fans revealed the pig’s head, concealed in a paper bag, to a local 
radio journalist and claimed they wanted to recreate the incident in November 
2002 when Barcelona fansthrew a pig’s head at Luís Figo

following his controversial switch to Real Madrid.

Piqué remained on the bench throughout to prevent the fans seeing through 
their plan. There were also several inflammatory banners with offensive 
messages towards Shakira, Pique’s partner, and Suárez.

Another sign read “Pau, your foot shows us the way” following the goalkeeper 
Pau López’s apparent stamp on Messi last week which infuriated the Ballon d’Or 
winner, a play on Real Madrid fans’ banner “José, your finger shows us the way” 
after José Mourinho poked the then-Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova in the eye 
during the2011 Spanish Super Cup

.

The game was just as spiky on the pitch with Felipe Caicedo and Marc-André ter 
Stegen clashing and Álvaro González apparently elbowing Messi near the end of 
the game. Álvaro reportedly called the Barça forward “really short”, marking 
his height with his hand, to which Messi replied: “You’re really bad.”
