This column has long been devoted to the pleasures of everyday cooking: a 
celebration of the simple, seasonal and satisfying, with barely so much as a 
nod to what you could call hobby cooking. So, nothing really for those who like 
to produce their own salami.

But earlier this week I got a fancy to make baked Alaska, the simultaneously 
hot and cold dessert with layers of golden sponge and ice cream under a cloud 
of hot meringue that no one could exactly call “everyday”. It is a 
once-in-a-blue-moon way to end a meal for the both the eater and the cook, 
which is probably why I had so much fun making it. One can be too down to earth 
sometimes.

If I’m honest, I find the classic baked Alaska on the sweet side. With that in 
mind I have added a sharp sauce of blackcurrants to pour into the meringue as 
you shatter its sparkly crust with your spoon. Yes, such recipes use every damn 
bowl and pan in the kitchen and I had to rethink my usual rather laid-back 
speed of cooking (one for organised cooks only this, if your Alaska is not to 
end in sweet, creamy, tears.) But the result is gorgeous and left us sinking 
our spoons through meringue into cold ice cream and soft sponge cake like 
seven-year-olds at a birthday party. Don’t even think of using shop-bought cake.

The sort of cook who has a blow torch will find the final bit of the recipe a 
doddle. Those who haven’t, like me, may have to keep their fingers crossed. Ice 
cream in the oven, what could possibly go wrong?

Blackcurrant compote

blackcurrants 350g
caster sugar 80g
water 3 tbsp

Remove the blackcurrants from their stalks, dropping them into a small 
saucepan. Add the sugar and water, then bring to the boil. Lower the heat, and 
let the currants simmer gently for 4 or 5 minutes, then remove from the heat as 
soon as the sugar has dissolved and the berries are starting to burst. Pour 
into a jug or bowl and set aside.

Blackcurrant baked Alaska

For the sponge:
butter 200g
caster sugar 200g
eggs 4
self-raising flour 200g
baking powder 1 tsp
blackcurrants 150g, removed from stems

blackcurrant compote (see above)
vanilla ice cream 6 balls (500ml)

For the meringue:
caster sugar 200g
egg whites 5
cornflour 1 tbsp

A sense of urgency is required at the end of cooking. You’ll need a baking 
tray or swiss roll tin approx 30 x 22cm, lined with baking parchment.

Set the oven at 170C/gas mark 3-4. Put the butter into the bowl of a food 
mixer, add the sugar and beat till light, creamy and soft. Occasionally scrape 
down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to help the ingredients to 
combine smoothly.

Break the eggs into a bowl, beat lightly with a fork to mix the yolks and 
whites then add to the butter and sugar a little at a time, the beater still 
turning, till the eggs are fully incorporated. Mix the flour and baking powder 
then fold into the batter.

Transfer the mixture to the lined baking tray, smooth the surface then scatter 
the blackcurrants on top. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes (check 
after 30). Remove from the oven, leave to cool then turn out on to a cooling 
rack and peel off the paper.

When the sponge is cool enough, cut out 6 discs using an 8cm biscuit cutter 
(or saucer). Transfer the discs to a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving a 
little room around each.

Make 6 large balls of ice cream with a scoop, place them on a metal or plastic 
tray and return them to the freezer until hard.

To make the meringue, put the sugar on a baking sheet and warm in a low oven 
for 5-7 minutes. Whisk the egg whites in a clean food mixer till thick and 
fluffy. With the whisk still turning, add the warmed sugar in 2 or 3 batches, 
then continue whisking for 4 or 5 minutes till firm and glossy. Fold in the 
cornflour. Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 7.

Press the centre of each sponge disc with the back of a spoon to create a 
hollow. Working quickly, place a ball of ice cream in the centre of each piece, 
then cover each with a thick layer of meringue, enclosing the entire cake, 
right down to the baking sheet. There should be no cake or ice cream visible.

Bake immediately in the preheated oven for 3-5 minutes till the meringue 
starts to colour. Alternatively, if you have a kitchen blowtorch, lightly brown 
each one all over. Lift on to cool plates and serve with the compote (above).

Serves 2
water 600ml
sugar 150ml
peaches 2
mascarpone 2 tbsp
soft amaretti 50g (4 biscuits)
blackcurrant compote (see above)

Put the water and sugar into a medium-sized saucepan and bring to the boil. 
Cut the peaches in half, remove the stones, then lower the fruit into the 
syrup. Reduce the heat and leave to simmer for 7-10 minutes or until the 
peaches are fully tender.

Remove the peaches from the pan with a draining spoon and place them snugly, 
hollow side up, in a serving dish. Place a tablespoon of mascarpone in each 
peach half. Crumble the amaretti on top.

Warm a little compote in a pan, then spoon over the peaches and serve.
