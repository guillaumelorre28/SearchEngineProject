An injury-ravaged Bayern Munich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bayernmunich> side beat Hoffenheim 2-0, 
shrugging off a string of absences and their midweek Champions League defeat at 
Porto to close in on the Bundesliga title.

Sebastian Rode scored in the 38th minute and Hoffenheim’s Andreas Beck added 
an own goal in stoppage time as Bayern, with the youngsters Mitchell Weiser and 
Gianluca Gaudino in the lineup, opened a 13-point lead. Second-placed 
Wolfsburg, are in action against Schalke on Sunday, after which both sides will 
have five games to play.

The German champions, who host Porto on Tuesday in the Champions League 
quarter-final, second leg after Wednesday’s 3-1 loss, were without half a dozen 
starters, including Philipp Lahm, Arjen Robben, Franck Ribéry and Bastian 
Schweinsteiger. But Manuel Neuer was in top form in goal, spectacularly denying 
Anthony Modeste at point-blank range after a defensive blunder by the Brazilian 
Dante – criticised for his performance at Porto.

Rode then made the most of Bayern’s second chance of the game, curling his 
shot from the edge of the box past the goalkeeper Oliver Baumann.

Rode was lucky not to be penalised for bringing down Eugen Polanski in the 
area a minute later but there was no denying the dominance of Bayern, who came 
close again when Robert Lewandowski scraped the bar at the start of the second 
half.

They did get a second goal when Thomas Müller charged into the box and cut the 
ball back to the unfortunate Hoffenheim captain, Beck, who slipped the ball 
into his own net.

“We played a good first half with a lot of control,” said Pep Guardiola, who 
left Xabi Alonso, Thiago Alcântara and Jérôme Boateng on the Bayern bench at 
the start to give them a rest.

“The second half was more complicated and our legs were a bit tired,” added 
the smiling Spaniard, whose team could clinch the title as early as next week 
if Wolfsburg lose. “I am very proud of my players.”
