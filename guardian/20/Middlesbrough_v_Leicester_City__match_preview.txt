Claudio Ranieri will want to see Leicester City capitalise on their solid win 
over West Ham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/31/leicester-city-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report>
. The Italian should be especially keen because this is the last game for which 
Islam Slimani and Riyad Mahrez will be available before leaving for the Africa 
Cup of Nations. Middlesbrough’s scoring average of fewer than one goal a game 
will not worry their opponents, who need to improve in 2017.Graham Searles
