The 31-year-old, who was part of the Spain squads that won the 2010 World Cup 
and 2012 European Championship, is due to undergo a medical on Friday.

It is understood the former Athletic Bilbao and Juventus forward has been 
handed a two-year deal.

Llorente won five major trophies at Juventus - including three Serie A titles 
- and appeared as a substitute in the 2015 Champions League final. But he was 
not a regular starter by the time he returned to La Liga with Sevilla, where he 
largely acted as Kevin Gameiro’s understudy.

He started 14 times in his solitary season, scoring four times.

No transfer fee has been announced for the player, though Sevilla were keen to 
sell him having made him one of their highest earners when he arrived on a free 
transfer last summer.

Swansea were in need of attacking reinforcements, having allowed Alberto 
Paloschi, Bafetimbi Gomis and Portugal’s Euro 2016 hero Eder to move on.
