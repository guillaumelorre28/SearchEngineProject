 (Icac) assistant commissioner Anthony Whealy has leapt to the defence of Megan 
Latham, saying comments that she should consider a “quiet retirement into 
private life” were completely unfounded and unfair.

Latham resigned as Icac commissioner on Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/23/icac-commissioner-megan-latham-resigns>
 after theNew South Wales parliament last week passed controversial plans  
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/16/baird-governments-icac-reform-disgraceful-exercise-to-sack-commissioner>
to restructure the body, which would force her to reapply for her job. She now 
plans to return to the NSW supreme court bench.

The former NSW director of public prosecutions Nick Cowdery, has also spoken 
out against the Icac restructure that effectively forced Latham out, describing 
it as “unprincipled and unwarranted”.

“It appeared to be nothing more than a device to remove the commissioner, 
cloaked in some other reforms that were probably unnecessary,” Cowdery said.

On Thursday, the outgoing Icac inspector David Levine, told News Corp that 
Latham should not return to the court.

He claimed her return would give rise to issues of “impartiality and political 
activity” after her time with Icac.

“The preferable course would be to arrange for her quiet retirement into 
private life or ­another part of the legal system,” Levine told News Corp.

Whealy, who has also served on the NSW supreme court bench and as an Icac 
assistant commissioner, said he was shocked by the comments.

Potential conflicts of interest are regularly encountered by courts, and 
judges can be asked to recuse themselves or take other steps to avoid any 
perception of bias, he said.


Whealy told Guardian Australia that Latham was one of the most highly 
respected criminal judges in NSW, and there should be no issue with her 
returning to the bench. He described the remarks as “completely misguided”, 
“hollow” and unfair.

“If you take his comments to mean that Megan isn’t a fit and proper person to 
go back and be a judge, I would take serious exception to that,” he said.

“To attack her as lacking in judgment or integrity or criticising her 
impartiality, I think are completely misguided and are simply the remarks of 
people who have got a grudge against her.


“When you come to putting into personal terms for someone like Megan, it’s a 
very hollow argument.


“The attack now on her personally is completely unwarranted and unfair, and 
she’s not now in a position to respond.”

The Labor opposition has used the changes to Icac to attack the Baird 
government, saying they were clearly designed to force Latham out.

They say the restructure significantly weakens the anti-corruption body, and 
described the move to push Latham out as retribution for her findings onLiberal 
party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> donations, 
which forced the sidelining of 11 Liberal MPs.

Cowdery, the NSW director of public prosecutions from 1994 to 2011, said of 
the restructure: “This kind of action has been taken sparingly in the past with 
some politically unpopular courts/judicial officers, but that does not make it 
right.”

His comments were echoed by Whealy, who said no other anti-corruption body in 
the country used a trio of commissioners. Having three commissioners would 
significantly reduce Icac’s effectiveness, he said.

“It’s sad to say, but I’m afraid it’s just a vendetta against [Latham],” he 
said.

The NSW opposition leader, Luke Foley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/luke-foley>, said last week changes 
to Icac and the treatment of Latham was a “tawdry and disgraceful exercise”.


“The government is railroading Ms Latham out of a job because she inquired 
into corruption in the ranks of the Liberal party,” he said.

“Removing the commissioner was never discussed in the parliamentary committee 
but it is now being snuck into this legislation.”
