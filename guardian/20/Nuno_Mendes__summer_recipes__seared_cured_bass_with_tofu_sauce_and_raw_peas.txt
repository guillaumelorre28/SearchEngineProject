This recipe is simple but relies on really good ingredients such as the 
freshest fish and peas, top-quality Japanese soy sauce, and a grassy Spanish or 
Portuguese olive oil for the tofu sauce.

Seared cured bass with tofu sauce raw peas, chillies and lemon

(Serves 4 as part of a sharing menu)
300g sustainably farmed small bass 
<http://www.goodfishguide.org/fish/749/Bass,%20seabass%20(Farmed)>, filleted, 
scaled and pin boned.
60g caster sugar
40g fine sea salt
80g small raw peas
Pinch of salt 
A squeeze of lemon
6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 red long chilli, deseeded, sliced thinly

For the tofu sauce

350g very good quality soft tofu (Clearspring or Yutaka)
2 tbsp low sodium Japanese soy sauce
1 pinch of Maldon salt
2 tbsp top quality olive oil

Combine the sugar and salt, spread the mixture on a flat tray so that the 
fillets are covered above and below, then leave to cure for 45 minutes. While 
the fish is curing, blitz all of the ingredients for the tofu sauce in a 
blender - keep the sauce cold until serving.

Season the peas with a pinch of salt, a squeeze of lemon juice and some olive 
oil and set aside.

When youâ€™re ready to serve, wash the cure off the fillets, pat them dry and 
sear them, skin-side down, for 45 seconds in a non-stick pan on a high heat to 
get the skin nice and crispy (if you apply pressure you will prevent the fish 
from curling). Cut each piece in two before plating.

Place the seared bass skin-side up on a large serving plate, spoon a generous 
amount of the tofu sauce around it, place mounds of the marinated peas around 
and scatter the red chilli slices with a little olive oil around the plate. Eat 
right away.
