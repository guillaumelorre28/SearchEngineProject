The news in clues

A hidden theme from Raich in last Friday’s Independent 
<http://independent.co.uk/independent.co.uk/editorial/xword/c_080115.bin>. 32 
across (yes, this puzzle has 35 clues jammed into a 15-by-15 grid) gave a hint 
...


31ac The Spanish six put in extra note showing bony frame (6)
[ Spanish “the” + Roman numeral “six”, inside abbrev. for an “extra note” at 
the end of a letter]
[ EL + VI, inside PS ]

... with PELVIS, and a couple of titles confirmed it. Here’s one:


25ac Questionable South American film is covering Open University (10)
[ abbrev. for “South” + abbrev. for “American” + synonym for “film” + “is” 
surrounding abbrev. for “Open University” ]
[ S + US + PIC + IS surrounding OU ]

30ac Notices doctor embracing popular son (5)
[ abbrev. for “doctor” around synonym for “popular”, then abbrev. for “son”]
[ MD around IN, then S ]

And here’s the answer:

If you haven’t yet done the puzzle, can you name the other track that was 
hiding inside a 10-letter word above a five-letter one?


Latter patter

The annotated solution

’sprize puzzle <https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/26459> is now 
available, including this fine and timely clue:


2d/7d Freezing cold bum pinched by two brothers? Yes, in play (5,7)
[ slang for “bum” inside an abbrev. for “brother” and a synonym for brother, 
then an anagram of “Yes”]
[ ASS inside BR and MONK, then EYS ]

This is not in fact an allusion to a multiply blue version of Pinter’s The 
Caretaker <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/caretaker.html>, but a simple clue 
for BRASS MONKEYS. The phrase itself is one which combines apparent rudeness 
with a spurious origin myth and aeneous primates.


Now, Guardian columnist and occasional monkey correspondent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/14/how-to-avoid-monkey-trap-oliver-burkeman>
Oliver Burkeman <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/oliverburkeman> has 
recentlywarned against overdoing the debunk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/oliver-burkeman-column/2015/jan/01/detoxing-debunked>
, but this is too rich to ignore. “Spurious”, you say? Why the suspicious minds?


Well, you and I might have been told the same tale: that the balls on a brass 
monkey (stop sniggering at the back) are nothing in the least rude: in the 
olden times, in fact, sailors kept their cannonballs on a brass apparatus 
commonly known as a “monkey”. And when the temperature on deck was low, the 
brass would shrink just enough that the ordnance might roll off. Freeze the 
balls off a brass, you see, monkey.


Lexicographers and folklorists, however, smell a pack of rats. Brewer’s 
Dictionary of Phrase and Fable 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/brewer-s-dictionary-of-phrase-and-fable.html> 
takes the gloves off:


there is no substantiating evidence for this rather unlikely story.

Ouch. Harsh words from Ebenezer Cobham. Among the grounds for scepticism are 
that brass doesn’t do this, that cannonballs weren’t stored like this and,says 
Oxford Dictionaries 
<http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-is-the-origin-of-the-term-brass-monkey>
, that a cannonball-holder is only ever referred to as a “monkey” at times when 
people are telling you this story about where “brass monkey” comes from. Nope, 
this is a way of explaining a colourful phrase to an inquisitive child without 
having to acknowledge the existence ofcojones.


I’d like, today, to add to the scholarship on this topic. Here’s a passage 
from an 1845 collection of “Patent Sermons” by Elbridge Gerry Paige, columnist 
for New York’s Sunday Mercury (and not to be muddled up with the Elbridge Gerry 
who gave his name to “gerrymandering”). This “sermon”, undated, is titled “On 
Enjoying Life”:

 from Short Patent Sermons, by Dow Jr. Photograph: Google Books 
On the basis that these “toes” are indeed toes, and that the “nose” in the 
1847 variant from Herman Melville ...

 From Herman Melville’s Omoo. Photograph: Google Books 
... is a nose, I think there’s little doubt what the “balls” are. Or rather: 
feel free to resume sniggering at the back.


After all, when the monkey pops up in the dictionary, he’s usually up to some 
mischief. Witness the word that tends to follow “(not) give a monkey’s”. And 
the entry for spanking/slapping/choking the monkey is the only appearance of ZZ 
Top in the OED’s citations. (I Got the Six, as the B-side to Sharp Dressed Man, 
was among the first songs I owned, but I presumed the monkey was a gambling 
metaphor.)

Which leaves one question. Even if the balls make sense, why a monkey, and why 
brass? It’s not clear. And if you think that someone should have got to the 
monkey’s bottom of this, bear in mind that nobody has the faintest idea why we 
even call monkeys “monkeys”. A satirical pop at monks? A character in Reynard 
The Fox? Not the foggiest. Maybe you can help. In the meantime, a more savoury 
simian suggestion.


Not “Who put that monkey on horseback without tying his tail?”, a catchphrase 
from the prim 1978 edition of the Penguin Dictionary of Historical Slang. Nope, 
we’re looking for an anti-Darwinian expression (which would surely be more 
effectively anti-science if it were “a monkey’s nephew”, but there you have 
it). Reader, how would you clue A MONKEY’S UNCLE?
