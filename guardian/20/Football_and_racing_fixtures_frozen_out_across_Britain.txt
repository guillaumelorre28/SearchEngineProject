Five more football games and four horse racing meets were called off on 
Tuesday as freezing temperatures continued to hit sports in Britain. Although 
the big game of the night between Tottenham and Burnley in the League Cup 
semi-final was expected to go ahead because Spurs have undersoil heating, the 
matches in League One between Crewe andBristol Rovers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bristolrovers>, Stockport and Cheltenham, 
Peterborough and MK Dons, and the League Two meeting of Exeter and Macclesfield 
were called off because the playing surfaces were frozen.

A Scottish third-division game between Cowdenbeath 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/cowdenbeath> and Berwick was also 
postponed with temperatures in some parts of Britain falling to minus 11 
Celsius (12.2 Fahrenheit). Saturday's schedule was also hit when three FA Cup 
matches were among 12 called off, with eight more in Scotland.

Racing has been badly hit by the big freeze which is expected to go on until 
the weekend. Tuesday's meets in England at Leicester and Sedgefield were called 
off and so were Wednesday's events at Fontwell Park and Scotland's Musselburgh 
because the courses were frozen. Even a meet on Wolverhampton's all-weather 
track was scrapped on Monday.
