The funniest standup I’ve ever seen

One out of Louis CK, Chris Rock, Daniel Kitson, Stewart Lee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/stewart-lee>, Richard Pryor or Bridget 
Christie <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/bridget-christie>. James Acaster 
is phenomenal, but he’s my friend so I can’t say him or he’ll make fun of me.


The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen

Bill Hader playing Stefon on Saturday Night Live is a treat, but the first 
time I saw Greg Davies doing his mindreader character Derren Chilblain in We 
Are Klang I laughed so hard I nearly threw up.

The funniest item of clothing I’ve ever owned

I have an Entertainment 720 t-shirt. That will either mean nothing to you, or 
everything.

The funniest word

Trebuchet.

The funniest person I know

Joint first place for my cousins. They are 11 and eight and they have 
absolutely no respect for me. They call me Madam Lily. I assumed that this was 
a reference to some TV show but apparently it isn’t.

The funniest book I’ve ever read

Dead heat between Catch-22 and Alan Partridge’s book. The former influenced my 
whole outlook on the world, the latter got me told off by an air steward on a 
flight for laughing too loudly while everyone else was asleep.


The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny

Question Time.

The funniest heckle I’ve ever had

Years ago, I was gigging with some of the guys from The Inbetweeners 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-inbetweeners>. I was on first and 
it was clear that the crowd had no interest in me. I did about a minute of my 
allotted 10 before a man stood up and shouted: “When are the famous people on?”

The funniest number

23.

The funniest joke I’ve ever heard 

It’s not really a joke, but my family in Kerala have this expression that I 
love. If someone is trying to rip you off or trick you in some way, you say: 
“What is this? Cucumbertown?” I have no idea what it means but I adore it.
