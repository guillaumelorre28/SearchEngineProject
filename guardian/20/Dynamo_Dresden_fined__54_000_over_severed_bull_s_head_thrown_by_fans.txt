The German football association (DFB) announced on Tuesday that repeat 
offenders Dynamo, who were already on probation following incidents last 
season, had failed to safeguard their high-risk German Cup game in August 
againstRB Leipzig <https://www.theguardian.com/football/red-bull-leipzig>, who 
are nicknamed the Bulls.

Dresden fans had thrown a bull’s head on to the inside area of the stadium, 
unfurled insulting banners and hit one player with a coin during their win over 
their fellow eastern German club, owned by energy drinks maker Red Bull.

RB Leipzig’s seven-year rise into German football’s top flight has been dogged 
by boycotts and protest stunts by opposing fans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/08/why-rb-leipzig-has-become-the-most-hated-club-in-german-football>
. Unlike in other leagues in Europe, the statutes of the German Football 
Association deter big investors from taking over its clubs and many fans feel 
RB Leipzig have overstepped the mark in the deal with their sponsor.

There were a total of six incidents of unsportsmanlike behaviour from their 
fans, including at three other games in October, the DFB said, including the 
use of banned flares.

This is not the first time Dynamo has been sanctioned, with the club having 
been suspended from the German Cup in the 2013-14 season because of crowd 
trouble.
