I was feeling a bit gloomy the other week, thanks to heavy rain and the 
big shadow cast by all the goings-on in government. But then I came acrossMolly 
O’Neill’s A Well-Seasoned Appetite 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Well-Seasoned-Appetite-Recipes-Eating-Seasons/dp/0140237828>
 (Penguin, 1997) and cheered up no end.

As the title suggests, the book is pegged around the joy of eating the right 
food in the relevant season. “When the air grows heavy and the human spirit 
wilts,” O’Neill writes (be that due to actual summertime humidity or a 
metaphorical political cloud), “a salad is the best revenge. A seemingly 
innocent tangle of greens is neither gentle nor mild. It is alive. Fierce both 
in its inherent crispness and in the varying pepper of individual varieties, it 
appeals to the brutal side of the summer appetite. Eating a salad is like 
cracking a whip against languor and ennui.Salad

Those are big claims for small leaves, I know, but they restored my appetite, 
and helped me decide to spend the rest of summer hiding in the vast array of 
ingredients that go under the umbrella term “salad”.

Courgette and samphire

A mix of green and yellow courgettes looks great here, but use just green, if 
that’s all you have. If you have one, use a mandolin to cut the courgettes nice 
and thin. Serves six.

300g podded edamame beans (fresh or frozen and defrosted)
2 green courgettes (450g), cut into 0.5cm-thick slices
2 yellow courgettes (550g), cut into 0.5cm-thick slices
90g samphire, broken into small lengths 
1 tbsp poppy seeds
15g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped
100g soured cream, to serve

For the dressing
2½ tbsp lemon juice 
1½ tsp Dijon mustard
Salt
60ml olive oil
2 tbsp soured cream

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, blanch the edamame for three 
minutes, until cooked but still with a bite, then drain, refresh under cold 
water and set aside to dry. Once dry, put in a large bowl with all the other 
salad ingredients, except the cream.

For the dressing, put the lemon juice and mustard in the small bowl of a food 
processor, add three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, then, with the motor 
running, slowly pour in the oil and mix until emulsified. Add the soured cream, 
work briefly to combine, then pour over the salad and toss. Arrange on plates 
(or one big platter), add a spoonful of soured cream on top and serve.

Sweetheart cabbage, asparagus and horseradish

This is great with smoked fish. If you can’t get hold of lovage, buy a bunch 
of celery with its leaves still intact, and use those instead. Serves four.

1 sweetheart cabbage, central stalk removed, the rest cut widthways into 
0.5cm-thick shreds
250g asparagus, woody ends discarded, cut 2-3mm thick on an angle 
2 celery stalks, cut 2-3mm thick on an angle
10g lovage leaves (or 15g celery leaves)
5g dill, roughly chopped
10g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped
30g parmesan, finely shaved
Salt and black pepper
For the dressing
2 lemons
2 tbsp olive oil
20g finely grated horseradish
1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed
80g soured cream

First make the dressing. Top and tail one of the lemons, then cut down the 
sides, following the natural curves, to remove the skin and pith. Holding the 
lemon over a small bowl, cut between the membranes to remove the individual 
segments, then tear each segment into two or three pieces and drop into the 
bowl. Squeeze two tablespoons of juice from the second lemon and add to the 
bowl, then add all the other dressing ingredients, mix in a half-teaspoon of 
salt and plenty of pepper, and set aside.

Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil, add the cabbage and blanch 
for a minute. Drain, refresh under plenty of cold water, then shake and set 
aside to dry. Once dry, transfer the cabbage to a large bowl.

To serve, add all the remaining salad ingredients to the cabbage bowl, pour 
over the dressing and toss to combine.

Fermented carrot, radish and kohlrabi



Serve this as a condiment (with grilled meat or oily fish, say, or in a cheese 
or roast beef sandwich, or with plain rice, and so on) or eat it as it is, as a 
side salad or snack. It lasts for a long time in the fridge (a couple of 
months, at least), so you’ll have plenty of time to experiment and try it out 
with all sorts. Temperature plays a big part in how quickly the vegetables will 
ferment (the warmer the room, the quicker the process) but here a slower 
ferment in a cooler room is preferable, because that produces a better flavour. 
The vegetables will have a distinct aroma when you open the jar, and may also 
emit gases and/or bubbles, but that’s perfectly normal and to be expected. Once 
refrigerated, the fermentation process slows down and the texture and flavour 
stabilise. Make sure you use a sterilised jar and clean utensils, otherwise you 
risk introducing bad bacteria that will cause your ferment to spoil. Serves six 
as a condiment or four as a salad.

2 carrots, peeled, trimmed and cut into long, thin strips with a vegetable 
peeler
200g radishes, tops removed and cut into 2mm-thick slices (use a mandolin, if 
you have one)
1 kohlrabi, peeled, cut in half and then thinly sliced into 2mm-thick rounds 
(again, use a mandolin if you can)
1 tbsp flaky sea salt
1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced
1 tsp fennel seeds, toasted

For the salad
15g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
10g mint leaves, shredded
1 tbsp olive oil
50g rocket
1 medium pink lady apple, cored, quartered and cut into 2mm-thick slices

Put the carrot, radish and kohlrabi into a medium bowl, add the salt and rub 
together using your fingers – the salt and massage help the vegetables release 
their juices. Add the garlic and fennel seeds, mix well and transfer to a 
plastic container big enough to hold all the vegetables snugly but with space 
for at least 2cm of air at the top. Squash down the vegetables to release more 
juices (you should now have enough liquid to cover them completely)  then lay 
clingfilm over the surface of the veg (if need be, use a weight to keep them 
submerged) and put the lid on the container. Leave to sit at room temperature 
for about five days, giving the vegetables a stir each day with a clean fork 
and also a squash down, to encourage them to continue releasing juices. After 
day three, taste the ferment every day, to make sure you are happy with its 
strength: it will get stronger with every day that passes. Once you’re happy 
with the flavour, transfer to a sterilised jar and keep in the fridge.

To make the salad, strain the fermented vegetables and put them in a large 
bowl. Add all the other salad ingredients, toss and serve.

In this Tunisian classic, burning the vegetables on a ridged griddle pan (or 
over an open flame on a barbecue) is a surefire way to introduce a tonne of 
smoky flavour. An hour may seem like a long time to leave vegetables to char, 
but they can be left to do so while you get on with something else. (If 
charring indoors, remember to ventilate your kitchen.) Mechouia is lovely with 
pitta for scooping it up, or serve with grilled fish or meat for a more 
substantial meal. It keeps in the fridge for three days. Serves six to eight, 
as part of a mezze.

2 large aubergines
2 red onions
2 large red peppers 
6 tomatoes
2 mild red chillies
75ml olive oil
1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed
1 tbsp good-quality sherry vinegar
Salt
1 tsp urfa chilli flakes, to serve (optional)

Put a large, ridged griddle pan on a high heat (if you have two griddle pans, 
use both to speed things up). Put the whole aubergines, onions and peppers on 
the hot pan(s), all skin on, and cook for about an hour, turning every 15 
minutes, until well charred and completely cooked through. Remove from the pan 
and leave to cool. Repeat the process with the tomatoes and chillies, cooking 
those for about 20 minutes and turning every five, then remove from the pan and 
leave to cool.

Peel and discard the charred skins of all the vegetables and remove the seeds 
from the peppers and chillies. Roughly chop the cooked vegetables, then put 
them in a large bowl, along with any juices. Add the olive oil, garlic, vinegar 
and a third of a teaspoon of salt, mix well and leave at room temperature for a 
couple of hours, to let the flavours develop.

To serve, give the mechouia a good stir, transfer to a large plate or shallow 
bowl, and sprinkle with chilli, if using.
