Hamilton pulls in and is off to celebrate. What a day for him. He moved in 
front at the first turn and took complete control of the race. Rosberg’s rear 
wheels spun on the start when moving into third gear and the German driver 
never really recovered, though he also picked up a harsh five second penalty 
for an overtaking move. The Red Bulls looked good out there, too, occupying the 
other couple of places on the podium.

So now it’s the summer break. Hamilton leads the championship on 217 points, 
Rosberg is back on 198. I wonder who will be more relaxed on the beach for the 
next week or so? Thanks for reading. Stay on site for the report and reaction 
from Hockenheim. Until next time, farewell.

“A beautiful start, brilliantly managed. Awesome race, mate, well done.” The 
reaction on Hamilton’s radio says it all. The Briton responds to say “fantastic 
race, guys. The summer break, I hope you enjoy it”.

And Hamilton wins. Again. Ricciardo is second, Verstappen is third. And 
Rosberg is back in fourth. Hamilton is 19 points clear of Rosberg in the 
championship.

Lap 66: Hamilton has 7.2 sec, which will please him no doubt – despite sending 
neutrals to sleep with how straightforward it has been.

Lap 65: But now Perez fights past Verstappen too and then Alonso to climb into 
the final points place. A little further ahead, Button jumps past Bottas and 
into eighth.

Lap 64: Perez is battling Alonso for 10th place. The latter defends well to 
keep the attack at bay, though, before being lapped by Verstappen … but then 
Alonso comes off the hairpin quickly and unlaps himself.

Lap 45: Hamilton leads Ricciardo by 11.8 sec. Looking back on Rosberg’s stop, 
they waited eight seconds before starting to work on his car – a large mistake 
that could now cost him a place on the podium.

Lap 44: Rosberg pits to take that penalty and get out with soft compounds. He 
will now race to the finish and have an opportunity to eat into the distance to 
Ricciardo … but, realistically unless there is a disaster for the leader, not 
Hamilton.

Lap 42: With the five second penalty, as it stands Rosberg looks set to drop 
back to fourth … although Verstappen appears to be struggling in that position 
at the moment. Hamilton, meanwhile, is out on his own and barring a disaster 
set to extend his championship lead.

Lap 36: Hamilton is told to go on plan B now – a third stop, it seems, now 
Rosberg has to take a five second penalty on his next trip to the pits. It’s a 
Mercedes 1-2 on the track now, with Hamilton leading by five seconds (not 
including the penalty).

Lap 35: There are groans in the stands upon learning of Rosberg’s penalty. 
Meanwhile, Hamilton pits and he has not lost the lead – but he too has moved to 
supersoft. Rosberg remains on softs.

Lap 24: Gutierrez will pit at the end of this lap. Hamilton’s lead continues 
to grow marginally with each lap. He and Ricciardo may opt for two stops. 
Rosberg appears to be going for three and remains in fourth. Is it too early to 
write him off?

Lap 22: Tasty puns part three from Iain Brown: “I’m pretty sure one of the 
red-tops went with ‘Ignited Colours of Benetton’ the day after the Verstappen 
incident. Or have I missed a meeting?” Fair play to that sub.

Race report from the Hockenheimring

Lewis Hamilton wins German Grand Prix to maintain F1 championship lead
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/31/lewis-hamilton-wins-german-grand-prix-f1-championship-lead-nico-rosberg> 
Hamilton pulls in and is off to celebrate. What a day for him. He moved in 
front at the first turn and took complete control of the race. Rosberg’s rear 
wheels spun on the start when moving into third gear and the German driver 
never really recovered, though he also picked up a harsh five second penalty 
for an overtaking move. The Red Bulls looked good out there, too, occupying the 
other couple of places on the podium.

So now it’s the summer break. Hamilton leads the championship on 217 points, 
Rosberg is back on 198. I wonder who will be more relaxed on the beach for the 
next week or so? Thanks for reading. Stay on site for the report and reaction 
from Hockenheim. Until next time, farewell.

“A beautiful start, brilliantly managed. Awesome race, mate, well done.” The 
reaction on Hamilton’s radio says it all. The Briton responds to say “fantastic 
race, guys. The summer break, I hope you enjoy it”.
 
And Hamilton wins. Again. Ricciardo is second, Verstappen is third. And 
Rosberg is back in fourth. Hamilton is 19 points clear of Rosberg in the 
championship.

Lap 66: Hamilton has 7.2 sec, which will please him no doubt – despite sending 
neutrals to sleep with how straightforward it has been.
 
Lap 65: But now Perez fights past Verstappen too and then Alonso to climb into 
the final points place. A little further ahead, Button jumps past Bottas and 
into eighth.
 
Lap 64: Perez is battling Alonso for 10th place. The latter defends well to 
keep the attack at bay, though, before being lapped by Verstappen … but then 
Alonso comes off the hairpin quickly and unlaps himself.
 
Lap 63: Hamilton says he has seen some rain on his visor. A couple of spits, 
it should be mentioned, not quite the deluge.
 
Lap 62: Felipe Nasr follows Felipe Massa in retiring early.
 
Lap 61: Hamilton’s lead is over 6 sec. Ricciardo is closing but not enough to 
really bother the world champion.

Lap 59: There was a 20% chance of rain … and we are told a shower might break 
out in about five minutes. Some late action perhaps? Hopefully because 
otherwise we are rolling into a dull conclusion.
 
Lap 58: Focus on TV has shifted to the battle for 14th, telling you all you 
need to know about events towards the front of the race.
 
Lap 57: Back in ninth Button says there is a problem with his car.
 
Lap 56: All but Massa remain on the track, a gauge of how uneventful this race 
has been.
 
Lap 54: Hamilton posts a new fastest lap to go 5.8 sec clear of Ricciardo. It 
would be good for the championship leader to have a couple of easier laps, 
spare his engine for the races to come.
 
Lap 52: A bit of a lull but Ricciardo is closing the gap on Hamilton, who is 
not quite far enough clear to slow down.
 
Lap 50: Hamilton is overlapping the back markers.
 
Lap 49: This is all a bit dull, isn’t it?

Lap 48: Hamilton is well clear of Ricciardo but the second placed driver is 
posting very fast lap times and well clear of Verstappen and Rosberg is tailed 
off in fourth.
 
Lap 47: And now Hamilton pits – and gets out without much trouble, with hardly 
any of his lead eaten into.
 
Lap 46: Ricciardo pits, allowing Raikkonen up to second. That makes Hamilton’s 
lead 28 seconds.
 
Lap 45: Hamilton leads Ricciardo by 11.8 sec. Looking back on Rosberg’s stop, 
they waited eight seconds before starting to work on his car – a large mistake 
that could now cost him a place on the podium.
 
Lap 44: Rosberg pits to take that penalty and get out with soft compounds. He 
will now race to the finish and have an opportunity to eat into the distance to 
Ricciardo … but, realistically unless there is a disaster for the leader, not 
Hamilton.

Lap 43: The gap, minus the penalty, between Rosberg and Ricciardo is 7.5 sec 
but closing.
 
Lap 42: With the five second penalty, as it stands Rosberg looks set to drop 
back to fourth … although Verstappen appears to be struggling in that position 
at the moment. Hamilton, meanwhile, is out on his own and barring a disaster 
set to extend his championship lead.
 
Lap 41: Vroom.
 
Lap 40: Ricciardo is up into third, overtaking Verstappen. That’ll be the 
super soft tyres.
 
Lap 39: Hamilton now leads Rosberg by 7 sec.
 
Lap 38: Verstappen leads Ricciardo by 1.1 sec in third – but will Red Bull ask 
him to move aside for his team-mate?
 
Lap 37: Massa is told to retire, the first to depart the race.
 
Lap 36: Hamilton is told to go on plan B now – a third stop, it seems, now 
Rosberg has to take a five second penalty on his next trip to the pits. It’s a 
Mercedes 1-2 on the track now, with Hamilton leading by five seconds (not 
including the penalty).
 
Lap 35: There are groans in the stands upon learning of Rosberg’s penalty. 
Meanwhile, Hamilton pits and he has not lost the lead – but he too has moved to 
supersoft. Rosberg remains on softs.
 
Lap 34: Ricciardo is gone to supersoft tyres and nobody has any idea why.
 
Lap 33: Rosberg has been given a five second penalty for that move on 
Verstappen. Is that harsh? It seemed like a fair attack, no?
 
Lap 32: Raikkonen now pits, allowing Rosberg into third. The German is 
25.213sec behind his Mercedes team-mate Hamilton, though.
 
Lap 31: Hamilton leads Ricciardo by 11sec. Raikkonen is in third and Rosberg 
is on his tail.
 
Lap 30: That move from Rosberg is being investigated – did he force another 
driver off the track?
 
Lap 29: Hamilton’s lead is now almost 11sec. Rosberg is back in sixth and told 
to push Verstappen in fifth … and the Mercedes gets past the Red Bull with a 
clinical attack on the hairpin, forcing Verstappen off the track momentarily.
 
Lap 28: Rosberg pits for a second time and changes to soft tyres. Is this now 
plan C?
 
Lap 27: Massa has a long stop to fix whatever was costing him time.
 
Lap 26: Hamilton’s lead is 8.3sec, gaining a second on Verstappen here.
 
Lap 25: All but Verstappen and Rosberg from the top 10 are using soft tyres.
 
Lap 24: Gutierrez will pit at the end of this lap. Hamilton’s lead continues 
to grow marginally with each lap. He and Ricciardo may opt for two stops. 
Rosberg appears to be going for three and remains in fourth. Is it too early to 
write him off?
 
Lap 23: Alonso shows his experience to get past Gutierrez and jump into 10th. 
Gutierrez is the only driver yet to pit.
 
Lap 22: Tasty puns part three from Iain Brown: “I’m pretty sure one of the 
red-tops went with ‘Ignited Colours of Benetton’ the day after the Verstappen 
incident. Or have I missed a meeting?” Fair play to that sub.
 
Lap 21: Sainz takes advantage of Massa and then Grosjean gets past him on the 
next corner. Massa is now 16th. What a disaster for the Brazilian.
 
Lap 20: Verstappen is 1.2sec ahead of Ricciardo but has lost another second on 
Hamilton.
