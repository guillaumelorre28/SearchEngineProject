GOAL! Rochdale 1-4 Stoke City (Walters 90+3)

A simple ball down the right wing puts Arnautovic through and his perfect low 
cross is economically tapped home by Walters.
 Jonathan Walters guides the ball home expertly for the fourth and final goal.

GOAL! Rochdale 1-3 Stoke City (Bennett 78)

And, from that needless free-kick, Dale have a goal back. Stoke can’t clear, 
the ball drops to Bennett and he turns neatly away from Sidwell before slotting 
home. They’ve deserved that.

GOAL! Rochdale 0-3 Stoke City (Moses 62)

This is another stunning strike. Moses beats the full-back Rafferty twice, 
cuts back onto his right and sends a glorious curling effort in off the far 
post. “We want four!” chant the Stoke fans and at the moment you’d have to say 
they’ll get it.

but undone by a couple of moments of quality.

GOAL! Rochdale 0-2 Stoke City (Ireland 53)

The suckerpunch. Moses in the left channel shimmies past Eastham far too 
easily and his pull-back is perfect for Stephen Ireland, who taps home from 
five yards out. That, you’d imagine, will be that.

 Stephen Ireland celebrates with his team-mates after scoring the second.

49 min: Rochdale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> have carried 
on where they left off in the first half. They’ve been much the better side for 
the majority of the game.

47 min: Nzonzi apparently has a groin strain, so that’s two injury concerns 
for Mark Hughes.

45 min: The impressive Camps breaks forward from midfield but can only scuff 
his shot at Butland. And, showing just what I know, there’ll be a minimum of 
two minutes added time.

43 min: Done gets into the right channel yet again and dinks an effort over 
Butland. The keeper, in no man’s land, gets just enough on it to keep it out. 
Stoke need the half-time whistle, but there’ll be a good four minutes of 
stoppage time I reckon.

39 min: What a chance for Rochdale! Done, ghosting between the Stoke 
centre-backs, is slipped by Camps and he’s through. The striker, though, pokes 
his effort wide of Butland’s goal.

Right, that’s it from me. Stick around on site for all the reports and 
reaction. But for now, cheerio!
 
Peep! PEEP!! PEEEEEEP!!! All over. Stoke go on to face Blackburn in the fifth 
round. Cue Mark Hughes narrative. Dale are left to concentrate on their League 
One promotion push.
 
A simple ball down the right wing puts Arnautovic through and his perfect low 
cross is economically tapped home by Walters.

90+2 min: Dawson looks to force his way into the area and goes down a little 
easily on the edge of the box. Martin Atkinson is unimpressed.
 
90 min: There’ll be a minimum of three minutes of added time.
 
88 min: Dawson is named as man of the match over the Tannoy, bringing a round 
of boos from the Stoke fans.

87 min: … Tanser swirls the ball into the area, but it drops to a Stoke boot.
 
86 min: Dale get a free-kick out on the right. Another chance to sling the 
ball into the box …
 
84 min: Rochdale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> are pressing 
as much as they can, but Stoke are just happy to pop the ball around now.
 
83 min: A lull.
 
80 min: Butland comes and flaps at a corner. Not what you need as a Stoke 
defender at this point.
 
And, from that needless free-kick, Dale have a goal back. Stoke can’t clear, 
the ball drops to Bennett and he turns neatly away from Sidwell before slotting 
home. They’ve deserved that.

77 min: Bardsley goes into the book for a daft challenge on Tanser down by the 
corner flag.
 
77 min: Noble-Lazarus pings an effort at goal from the free-kick – the ball 
moves in the air like a petrol station £1 ball but it’s a couple of yards over 
the bar.
 
76 min: Sidwell goes into the book for pulling back Dawson as the Dale 
midfielder batters his way forward. And Stoke make another change: Moses goes 
off to be replaced by Charlie Adam.
 
75 min: Toe-poke. Definitely toe-poke.
 
74 min: Toe-poke or toe-punt? 
 
73 min: A hideous non-clearance from Lancashire lands the ball at the feet of 
Walters, but his toe-poked effort fizzes a couple of yards wide.
 
70 min: Stat!

69 min: Stoke have utterly drawn Rochdale’s sting here. The Premier League 
side are in complete control.
 
67 min: “  Starting to feel a little sorry for Robbie Savage ” chuckles Fraser 
Thomas. Yes, the BT commentator is getting plenty of stick from the Stoke fans. 
He, they suggest, “looks like a girl”. Searing #bantz.
 
65 min: … dinked in, but met by a Stoke head.
 
64 min: Henderson is brought down by Ireland 30-odd yards from the Stoke goal. 
Central. A chance to Put It In The Mixer here forRochdale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> …
 
This is another stunning strike. Moses beats the full-back Rafferty twice, 
cuts back onto his right and sends a glorious curling effort in off the far 
post. “We want four!” chant the Stoke fans and at the moment you’d have to say 
they’ll get it.

61 min: Ireland charges down Lillis’s attempted clearance and the keeper is 
pretty relieved to see the ball drop kindly for him.
 
59 min: … Walters gets a glancing header onto Arnautovic’s delivery but the 
ball flashes across goal and out for a goal kick.
 
58 min: Walters is bundled down by Lancashire (the Rochdale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> player, not the entire county). 
Dangerous free-kick for Stoke …
 
57 min: And another Rochdale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> 
change: Reuben Noble-Lazarus replaces Vincenti.
 
55 min: Rochdale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> make a 
change: Done is replaced by former Crystal Palace striker Calvin Andrew.
 
54 min: The 0-2 scoreline is very harsh on the Dale. They’ve been excellent, 
but undone by a couple of moments of quality.
 
The suckerpunch. Moses in the left channel shimmies past Eastham far too 
easily and his pull-back is perfect for Stephen Ireland, who taps home from 
five yards out. That, you’d imagine, will be that.

 51 min: Wilson lets fly from distance. It’s a decent effort but always 
swinging wide.
 
50 min: Stoke get the chance to heave a free-kick into the area, but it’s a 
poorly directed set-piece.
 
49 min: Rochdale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> have carried 
on where they left off in the first half. They’ve been much the better side for 
the majority of the game.
 
47 min: Nzonzi apparently has a groin strain, so that’s two injury concerns 
for Mark Hughes.
 
Peep! Off we go again then. Can Rochdale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> maintain their momentum?
 
Stoke have made a change at the break, with Steve Sidwell replacing Nzonzi.
 
Peep! PEEEP! And they are an incident-free couple of minutes.

45 min: The impressive Camps breaks forward from midfield but can only scuff 
his shot at Butland. And, showing just what I know, there’ll be a minimum of 
two minutes added time.
 
43 min: Done gets into the right channel yet again and dinks an effort over 
Butland. The keeper, in no man’s land, gets just enough on it to keep it out. 
Stoke need the half-time whistle, but there’ll be a good four minutes of 
stoppage time I reckon.
 
42 min: Some inter-county banter in the terraces: “Staffordshire, [BAD 
WORD],[BAD WORD], [BAD WORD]. Staffordshire, [BAD WORD],[BAD WORD], [BAD 
WORD],” taunt the home fans.
 
39 min: What a chance for Rochdale! Done, ghosting between the Stoke 
centre-backs, is slipped by Camps and he’s through. The striker, though, pokes 
his effort wide of Butland’s goal.

38 min: … but it’s straight into the meaty palms of Jack Butland.
 
37 min: Wilson ends up clonking Dawson in the chest with his boot after the 
Rochdale man nips in to nod the ball away. He’s in the book andRochdale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> have a dangerous free-kick down 
by the corner quadrant …
 
36 min: Butland does well to smother a chance as Dawson looks to break clear 
inside the area.Rochdale <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rochdale> are 
pressing here.
