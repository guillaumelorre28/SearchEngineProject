A history of problems resulting in assorted operations on the 25-year-old’s 
right knee explain why a player mentored by José Mourinho during the first of 
Santon’s two spells at Inter has never fulfilled his extraordinary teenage 
promise.

Capable of playing in both full-back positions as well as in a defensive 
midfield role – although Newcastle deployed him primarily at left-back – Santon 
was once dubbed the new Paolo Maldini. He had also been a target for Crystal 
Palace where his former St James’ Park manager Alan Pardew is in charge, but 
Santon’s partner is from Tyneside and the couple are keen to return to the 
north-east.

Santon left Inter’s pre-season training camp on Thursday and headed for 
Wearside where, with personal terms believed to be all but agreed, the deal 
hinges on the medical.

He is likely to be used at right-back by Sam Allardyce. Sunderland’s manager 
would expect a player who began his career as a winger to offer some 
much-needed attacking impetus from a position that proved a weak link last 
season.
