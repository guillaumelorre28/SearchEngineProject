Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> have 
kept two clean sheets all season. Liverpool have kept three. Both sides may 
have come out of last weekend lamenting defeats that have allowed Chelsea to 
open a small gap at the top of the table but it could be argued that with 
defences like they have it is remarkable they are as high up as they are. But 
this, perhaps, is the modern way: defending in the old-fashioned sense has 
become unfashionable.

“There is no modern generation,” José Mourinho growled in the summer of 2015 
after winning the Premier League with Chelsea. He was responding to criticism 
of his supposedly “boring” style of play and with a certain level of wilful 
misunderstanding dismissed those who supposedly rejected the counterattack as 
“stupid”.

He may have had a point that there are certain coaches who pay too little 
attention to their defences but he was surely wrong about there being no new 
generation. Pressing, high lines, percussive, vertical football are in vogue, 
from Dortmund to Liverpool, from Sevilla to Hoffenheim.

There are differences. There are the Cruyffians, the Bielsistas, the German 
school inspired by Valeriy Lobanovskyi via Ralf Rangnick, and the post-Arrigo 
Sacchi Italians all using variations on the basic idea of pressing high and it 
is they, for all the successes of Mourinho and Diego Simeone, who represent the 
essence of modern football. And that, seemingly, means goals are on the up 
again.

In the Premier League, there was a clear shift in around 2009, from a 
situation in which 2.5-2.6 goals per game was normal to one in which 2.7-2.8 
was. Over the past couple of seasons there was retrenchment but this season 
goals are up again to the extent that if the average is maintained it will be 
the highest-scoring season in 20-team Premier League history.

The pattern is more complicated in the Champions League but the recent trend 
is upwards, to almost three goals a game in the group stage.

There is very rarely a single, simple explanation for anything. One of the 
reasons goals-per-game has gone up in the Champions League is that the gulf in 
quality between the best and the worst sides has increased and so there are 
more hammerings.

That might perhaps have happened anyway given the economics of modern football 
as the wealthy continue to get wealthier but it’s a process that has been 
exacerbated by the introduction of the Champions Path to qualification in 2009 
which, however well-intentioned, has led only to more mismatches in the group 
stage.

A decade ago there were usually four or five games of the 96 in the group 
stage that ended with a team winning by four or more goals. Now there are 
commonly 11 or 12. This season, with eight games to play, there had been a 
record 13.

That is not the case in the Premier League, where it is hard to discern any 
pattern in the number of victories by four goals or more – other than to point 
out how few there are by comparison with the group stage of the modern 
Champions League, bearing in mind there are four times as many Premier League 
games. So what does lie behind the rise in Premier League goals?

The step in 2009 seemed to stem from two inter-related reasons: a desire to 
ape Pep Guardiola’sBarcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> 
and play more progressive, open football, something that was facilitated by the 
liberalisation of the offside law, which effectively killed the offside trap as 
a systematic tactic, forcing defensive lines back and so creating a greater 
playing area in midfield. Even promoted sides were swept along by it.

Whereas the tendency had been for teams to sit deep, scrap away and try to 
nick a goal on the break, particularly away, sides such asBlackpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blackpool> and Swansea looked to have the 
ball and attack. More recently those defensive lines have crept forward again, 
without such protection from the offside law, and physical contact in the 
midfield has increased. There has been a gradual shift in focus from technique 
back towards physique, which is why the most significant figure in the Premier 
League over the past season and a half has arguably been N’Golo Kanté.

It would be an over-reaction to write off Guardiola’s purism but equally it is 
notable how his sides have – occasionally – been picked off by rapidly 
countering opponents: what Chelsea did to them on Saturday recalledwhat Real 
Madrid did to Guardiola’s Bayern in the 2014 Champions League semi-final 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/29/bayern-munich-real-madrid-champions-league-match-report>
.

But it is not just to do with defensive lines being high. The focus on passing 
the ball out from the back is fraught with danger – see Steve Cook for 
Bournemouth against Arsenal, or John Stones for City against Southampton – but 
it also means a change in emphasis. Defenders and goalkeepers are no longer 
selected for their capacity to stop opposing attackers but also for their 
passing ability and that seems to have led to a drop-off in the basic skills of 
negation.

The flip side is defenders who lack technical ability can be exposed by an 
opponent playing a high press; this is not a problem that can be rectified by a 
return to a more old-fashioned style of defensive defender, unless he is also 
good on the ball.

In that sense, the increase in goals is largely an issue of tactical 
philosophy. The change in the offside law permitted a style of flourish, and 
that style, in its various guises, has become hegemonic.

That in turn has had a major impact on the type of players sought by top 
clubs. Guardiola’s version of the approach has been challenged recently by a 
more physical, more vertical variant but it is still part of the same 
proactive, high-pressing school.
