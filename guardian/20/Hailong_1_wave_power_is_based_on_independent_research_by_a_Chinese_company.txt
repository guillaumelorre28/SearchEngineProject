Two articles published by the Guardian insinuated that a Chinese company 
“stole” Scottish technology in the process of developing the Hailong 1 
wave-power generating device (Mysterious factory break-in raises suspicions

 15 October). However, these reports are not grounded in facts.

Upon seeing the above-mentioned reports, we immediately sent an inquiry to the 
relevant company,China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> Shipbuilding 
Industry Corporation (CSIC). CSIC replied that the Hailong 1 wave-power 
generating device is based on independent research and development by CSIC. The 
Chinese company has a patent on the invention and application of this device is 
in accordance with all international conventions on intellectual property 
rights (IPR) as well as Chinese laws and regulations. In the designing and 
building process, the Chinese company had never had discussion with any British 
entity with regard to the relevant technology, nor purchased any reference 
material not open to the public or employed any personnel associated with the 
Scottish company, Pelamis Wave Power.

Hailong 1 has been designed to suit China’s marine environment conditions. 
There are huge differences between Hailong 1 and the Pelamis version in terms 
of design, appearance and structure of the joint.

China attaches great important to the protection of intellectual property 
rights and the World Intellectual Property Organization has established an 
office in China.
