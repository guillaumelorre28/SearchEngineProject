The progressive thinktank the Australia Institute is stepping up its campaign 
against the controversial Adani Carmichael mine proposal, publishing an open 
letter toMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> questioning the 
project.

The questions being posed via a full-page advertisement in the Australian 
Financial Review on Wednesday include whether the Adani mine, if it proceeds, 
will pay full coal royalties to theQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> government, or whether 
the project has been granted a royalty holiday.

The group is also asking whether Adani will pay the full company tax rate in 
Australia, whether the project will actually generate 10,000 jobs, whether the 
company will pay for the billions of litres of water it will use and whether 
the production of “new subsidised coal” will reduce jobs and exports in other 
parts of Queensland.

The renewed activism against the project follows a commitment by the company 
on Tuesdayto locate a new operational headquarters in Townsville 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/06/adanis-carmichael-coal-rail-line-may-not-be-eligibile-for-government-funding>
.

The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the Indian multinational 
had made a commitment to the state government to employ local workers, not 
bring in employees on 457 visas.

One Nation has also met twice in recent months 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/06/one-nation-met-with-adani-over-fears-company-would-fly-in-workers-from-india>
 with company representatives to satisfy itself that the company would not 
bring in fly-in fly-out foreign workers to work on the project.

Federal Nationals and the Queensland state Labor government want the project 
to be given a concessional loan from the $5bn Northern Australia Infrastructure 
Fund if that improves the viability of the development.

The government has confirmed this week it is considering lending $1bn towards 
a 388km railway line associated with the Carmichael mine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/05/george-christensen-backs-1bn-federal-loan-for-adani-railway-line>
. On Monday, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, metthe Adani Group chairman, 
Gautam Adani 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/05/adani-protest-hundreds-rally-against-proposed-1bn-loan-to-mining-company>
, in Melbourne to discuss the project.

But federal Labor said on Tuesday the project needed to proceed or not proceed 
on the basis of commercial merit, not subsidy.

“If the Adani coalmine stacks up commercially then we welcome the jobs that it 
will provide in Northern Queensland,” the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said.

“In terms of accessing taxpayer money through the Northern Australia 
Infrastructure Fund, we haven’t seen the case made out for that. The deal 
should stand up under its own commercial merits.”

The Adani Australia chief executive, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, told reporters on 
Tuesday the company would welcome a concessional loan.
