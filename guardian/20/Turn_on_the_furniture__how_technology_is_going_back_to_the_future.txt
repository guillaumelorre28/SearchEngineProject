When electronics was young, it was a given that a device, be it a radio, a 
gramophone or one of the newest-fangled televisors – later known as televisions 
– was also a piece of furniture. When everything needed rows of hot, glowing 
glass valves and mighty transformers, miniaturisation and portability were not 
even an option for domestic use.

There were military radios that lived in a soldier’s backpack and were powered 
by big 90-volt batteries, but the consumer had to wait for transistors to be 
invented in 1947 before portability was a possibility – albeit an expensive 
one. Even then it was 1955 before the first consumer transistor radio went on 
sale in the US.

So from the 1930s to the early 1960s or so, everything was furniture. A radio 
sat on a sturdy table, and had a hot, distinctive smell when it “warmed up” to 
start playing. The house-proud would give it a weekly wax and polish to keep 
its handsome, handmade carpentry shiny. Radiograms were radios that included a 
gramophone turntable and, with the extra weight of that, normally stood on 
their own four legs. And until the mid-1950s at least, TVs, despite having tiny 
screens, were nonetheless enormous floor-standing appliances with even greater 
wooden surfaces to burnish.

But such is the hipster-driven trend towards reverse progress in technology – 
think of the boom in vinyl records, the huge typewriter-likeFreewrite laptop

 and the reinvented Polaroid camera – there’s now a small but perceptible 
movement back to electronic-as-furniture. One of the earliest examples came 
three years ago, when Ruark, a Southend-on-Sea loudspeaker manufacturer with a 
history in cabinet making, brought out a radiogram for the modern day, the R7, 
whose extreme retro-ness made it an immediate hit.

Since then, furniture-scale technology, or smaller technology designed to be 
part of a tasteful furniture landscape, has become its own modest but growing 
category. Here are some examples of new technology furniture.

 Floor-mounted TV, £1,199: a modern TV is a just a plain oblong when it’s off, 
and no one with a scintilla of taste would ever consider mounting one on a 
wall. So where can you put it? Panasonic thinks perhaps on the floor, and its 
new DX802 sits there on a delicate steel frame. A quietly radical idea.
