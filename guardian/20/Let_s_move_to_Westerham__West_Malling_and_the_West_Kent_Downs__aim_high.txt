What’s going for it? On occasion, friends use me like a bargain-basement 
Kirsty and Phil. “Where, Tom,” one began recently, “can I find a period 
two-bedroom house no more than an hour’s commute to London Victoria? In the 
countryside. I want to see fields. £450k tops. And I don’t want anything 
modern.” A good question. To which I replied, after a G&T and a cogitate, “Why, 
Westerham, West Malling and the West Kent Downs.” Actually Westerham is a bit 
out of her league, but I threw it in as something to aim towards, because it’s 
such a lovely old town. Head east of Oxted, west of Maidstone and there’s a 
very endangered species: perhaps the only accessible patch of the home counties 
still remotely affordable. No idea why, because it has fabulous bony hills that 
Chaucer’s pilgrims crossed; pretty if suburban villages supplying the 
commuter’s every whim; great accessibility, too. And, reader, she moved there.

The case against Westerham in full rush hour/school run mode is a sight. Find 
a home close to train stations and schools to minimise using a car.

Well connected? Trains: half hourly to London Victoria from West Malling (50 
mins), Borough Green & Wrotham (45 mins) and Otford (35 mins); or from Oxted to 
London Bridge (hourly, 45 mins) or London Victoria (half hourly, 40 mins). 
Driving: a few minutes to the M26/M20, and 20 mins to the M25.

From the streets 


Kelly Innes “Every May bank holiday there’s a tradition of beating the bounds 
– walking the perimeter of Westerham parish.


Jane Hunter “Westerham has a great cafe culture and it’s friendly. Chartwell 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/chartwell>, Winston Churchill’s former home 
and now a National Trust property, is a mile away and a great place to visit.”
