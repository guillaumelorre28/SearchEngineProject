Steve Archibald, the former East Fife manager and Scotland striker who is 
reported to have declared an interest in buying Airdrie, has been urged to show 
his hand.

The First Division club were placed in provisional liquidation this week with 
debts of Â£750,000 but will hold an emergency general meeting on Monday, when 
shareholders will be asked to allow the constitution to be changed to clear the 
way for a takeover bid.

"I'm happy to speak to Steve Archibald, indeed anyone else who may have an 
interest," said Blair Nimmo, the liquidator.

George Peat became treasurer of the Scottish Football Association again 
yesterday with a surprise defeat of the Hearts chief executive Chris Robinson 
in a vote of the member clubs.

Peat, who resigned the post last year after leaving the Airdrie board, is now 
a director of Stenhousemuir.
