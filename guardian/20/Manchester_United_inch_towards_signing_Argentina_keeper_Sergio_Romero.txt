Romero, 28, spent last season on loan at Monaco from Sampdoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sampdoria> and impressed as the Argentina 
No1 at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

Roma are also targeting Romero, who is a free agent after leaving Sampdoria, 
but Van Gaal is hopeful of acquiring him. Valdés will leave the club after the 
manager stated the 33-year-old had not adhered to his “philosophy”. This was 
the reason cited for Valdés not being selected for United’s summer tour of 
America.

Although David de Gea could still leave for Real Madrid, Romero would expect 
to be the No2 goalkeeper to whoever replaces him. The Ajax goalkeeper Jasper 
Cillessen, who was Van Gaal’s No1 when the coach led Holland at the World Cup, 
is a candidate to succeed De Gea.
