This recipe is inspired by three dishes – the Portuguese salted-cod fritters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/16/nigel-slater-five-fritters-recipes>
, the classic Frenchbrandade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/22/nigel-slater-classic-brandade-cod>
 and the British favouritesmoked haddock with potatoes and cheese 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/smokedhaddockandpota_73433>. You can use as 
much cheese as you like here – I like a lot! It’s the perfect thing to eat with 
fresh crusty bread and a nice glass of wine.

Serves 2
350g young potatoes, unpeeled
4 cloves peeled garlic, 3 whole, 1 finely grated
140g fresh cod fillet, lightly salted
200ml single cream
Comté cheese, grated
Handful parsley, chopped
Pinch smoked paprika
Good quality extra virgin olive oil

Rinse the potatoes and boil them with the whole garlic cloves and a generous 
amount of salt until they are very soft.

Drain the liquid, reserving enough to poach the cod, reheat it to a simmer, 
add the cod and poach until cooked through (it depends on the size of your 
fillet, but no longer than three or four minutes).

Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and mash with the 
garlic.

Mix in the cod and gently beat everything together over a medium heat. Add the 
grated garlic and the single cream and continue to beat – the consistency 
should be that of a chunky dip. Add the grated comté cheese and the parsley.

Transfer to a serving plate, shake a little paprika over the top and drizzle 
with olive oil. Serve it with really good country bread.
