As a Punjabi growing up in West Bengal, the food that my mother cooked 
involved a variety of flavours from across India. The combination of Punjabi, 
West Bengali, Gujarati and south Indian cuisine played a huge part in my food 
education from a young age.

Punjabi cuisine is very different from that of West Bengal. The former focuses 
on tandoor-cooked dishes, dairy products, dal, pulses, parathas and vegetables; 
the latter on subtle flavours, rice, fantastic desserts and plenty of 
freshwater fish.

All of my friends would come around for my mother’s stuffed parathas and 
chapatis. They were invariably covered in butter or ghee on both sides, though 
the stuffing changed with the seasons – I can easily recall at least 20 
variations. My favourite was a stuffing of black chickpea flour, onions, lime 
juice, chilli and grated fresh ginger.

My best friend, Reshmi, was just as enthralled with Punjabi flavours as I was 
with those of West Bengal, and we’d often exchange our tiffins at lunchtime. 
I’d enjoy her plain paratha or puri withaloo dum 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dum_Aloo>, or sandwiches, or Chinese-style fried 
rice. In return, she’d eat my plain chapati with scrambled eggs cooked with 
onion and spices, or stuffed parathas served with mango pickle or yoghurt.

When I moved to the UK in 1994, I left behind my friends, my family and the 
food I loved to eat, and I found myself in a country that served inauthentic 
Indian dishes (such asbalti <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balti_(food)> and 
bright-red tikka dishes). I had to find my own identity again, to navigate my 
way around this new culinary landscape.

Fortunately, Indian flavours are now very easy to find in supermarkets across 
the UK, but that wasn’t always the case. I’d walk to the local shops and find 
ingredients I’d never seen before: desiccated coconut (we always used fresh) or 
small radishes (we only ever ate long moolis). Packaged meat and even the 
drinks baffled me: I’d only seen my father and his friends drinking whisky or 
beer, so trying wine and local cider was a complete novelty.

I’d never eaten avocados; in fact, I didn’t like the flavour on its own, so I 
mixed it up with mint, coriander, tamarind, apples and various spices. For me, 
these cultural and culinary differences allowed me to continue to be creative.

The food I cooked started to become very much Anglo-Indian: I’d experiment 
with dishes such as a cumin-scented beetroot hummus and chicken drumsticks 
marinated in Indian-style spice blends for summer barbecues. I started to buy 
meat and fish that I’d never seen before in West Bengal: monkfish, sausages and 
salami. I enjoyed tasting each new ingredient, working out which Indian 
flavours and cooking methods would suit their taste and texture. My experiments 
with flavour were partly to give me the comfort of something familiar, despite 
being thousands of miles away from home.

The three recipes you see here came about as a result of these experiments. In 
West Bengal, fish is a staple part of the diet, whether caught in the delta of 
the river Ganges or from the ponds that most villagers have in their gardens.

Growing up, I lived in a house with no grill or oven, so everything was cooked 
on a gas hob – we would enjoy our freshwater fish in curries, or sometimes even 
steamed in a banana leaf. Things are very different there now, but it was only 
when I moved to England that I was able to cook fish in an oven for the first 
time.

Whole baked sea bream with red onions

I first encountered sea bream when I moved here: its versatility means that 
it’s fantastic fried, steamed or baked, as it is here. The combination of 
citrus, chilli, garlic and soy sauce is the perfect pairing for the sweetness 
of the fish.

Serves 2
5 tsp rapeseed oil
1 red onion, sliced
2 garlic cloves, sliced
2 tsp soy sauce
1 medium sea bream
½ tsp chilli flakes
1 tsp of smoked paprika
Juice of 1 lime
½ tsp black salt
3 large potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced

1 Put 2 teaspoons of oil into a nonstick frying pan over a high heat. Once 
hot, add the onion, garlic and soy sauce. Fry it all together for 5 minutes, 
keeping the heat high, until browned. Take the pan off the heat and set aside.

2 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Slash the fish through the flesh 
down to the bone, season and sprinkle with chilli flakes, smoked paprika, lime 
juice, black salt and sprinkle the remaining oil.

3 Lay the fish on the sliced potatoes and bake for 30 minutes or until the 
fish is cooked through. Serve topped with the browned onions.

Green apple, coriander and mint chutney 

Where I would use mango if I were back in West Bengal, here I use green 
cooking apples, which can be found in abundance across the UK. When combined 
with the mint leaves, the fruit gives the chutney a beautiful fresh flavour. 
This chutney can be served with anything but I particularly like it with sea 
bream and sea bass.

Lemon rice with curry leaves and peanuts

Another school friend, Radha, always invited me to tea when she made this. 
It’s a simple recipe made with readily available ingredients.
