Josip Ilicic’s penalty was cancelled out by the former Fiorentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fiorentina> winger Juan Cuadrado, on loan 
at the Juventus Stadium, with Mario Mandzukic and Paulo Dybala completing the 
turnround in the second half.

Massimiliano Allegri’s Juve are now fourth before next Sunday’s trip to face 
lowly Carpi while second-placed Fiorentina, who next entertain Chievo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chievo>, remain four points shy of Inter.

Wojciech Szczesny excelled in the Roma goal as Napoli were held to a goalless 
draw at the Stadio San Paolo.

Roma looked like scoring in the first half but Maurizio Sarri’s Napoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/napoli> turned the screw after the break, 
with the on-loan Arsenal goalkeeper Szczesny standing between them and a 
seventh straight home win.

Misfiring Milan were held to a 1-1 draw by the basement team, Hellas Verona, 
at San Siro.

Sinisa Mihajlovic has watched his Rossoneri drop points to such clubs as Carpi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/carpi> in recent weeks and the club’s 
mission to return to the Champions League places is looking increasingly 
fragile.

Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> took the lead through 
Carlos Bacca shortly after half-time but paid a heavy price for Nigel de Jong’s 
decision to commit a professional foul. He was sent off and Luca Toni levelled 
from the spot.

Valter Birsa’s second-half goal led to Chievo beating nine-man Atalanta 1-0 in 
Verona.

Nicolo Cherubin’s 66th-minute dismissal offered Alberto Paloschi the chance to 
score a penalty but Marco Sportiello denied him before Birsa produced the 
winner 10 minutes later.

To compound Atalanta’s disappointment Jasmin Kurtic was sent off for dissent 
in stoppage time.

Massimo Maccarone scored twice and set up a third goal for Riccardo Saponara 
as the upwardly mobileEmpoli brushed Carpi aside 3-0 at the Stadio Carlo 
Castellani.
