Well, Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> were 
disappointing there. For a team with such potential, they looked blunt in 
attack - though Embolo was certainly an upgrade on Seferovic - and short of 
ideas in midfield, where Xhaka and Shaqiri failed to shine.

Romania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> achieved exactly what 
they set out to achieve: not to lose. That’s a first point on the board for 
them and a win over Albania could see them into the knock-outs. See all the

FULL TIME

Xhaka finds Embolo, who runs at the Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> defence. In his desperation to 
find an opening, he bulldozes Grigore and earns a yellow card. And that, more 
or less, is that. Full time.

90 min: Keseru wriggles and twists in the centre of the pitch, desperately 
trying to hang onto the ball and to keep it from marauding Swiss midfielders. 
He’s clipped to the ground when the marauding Swiss midfield get sick of that 
sort of thing. Shaqiri is hauled off - and has been a bit disappointing - 
Everton’s Tarashaj replaces him. Three minutes added time.

88 min: Lichsteiner and Lang combine very neatly up the Swiss left wing. Lang 
clips a good cross into the area that would have destined for Embolo’s head 
and, then, the back of the neck had Tatarusanu not climbed well to claim.

87 min: Schar concedes a corner and Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> send forward a fair few men.

him to the ball, a good solid clearance.

76 min: Shaqiri blasts the free kick into the wall, it bounces back for 
Mehmedi, and he wafts a tame shot at Tatarusanu. A moment or two later, 
Dzemaili attempts to lash a first time volley at goal from a ball ballooned 
over his head. The result is not pretty. His manager stands on the touchline 
shaking his head ruefully.

74 min: Switzerland heap more pressure on Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania>. Mehmedi lurks on the Swiss 
left, then clips a delicious ball high across the area. It goes over Embolo and 
finds Shaqiri unmarked. Unfortunately, it is behind him and he attempts an 
outrageous bicycle kick, with the ball ballooning off his shin and high over 
the goal. Oh.

73 min: Embolo is nearly clear again - though may have been offside - and 
Tatarusanu has to race out from his goalline to intercept the long through ball 
from Mehmedi. Embolo is certainly causing more problems than Seferovic.

“For a game I thought would be a purists’ delight, this has been pretty 
entertaining stuff. I wouldn’t say it’s of stunning quality, but fun goes a 
long way,” reckons Kári Tulinius, who is right.

touch is a little agricultural. He knocks the ball so far past Chiriches it

69 min: That’s always good to see. Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> win a free kick that is 
virtually in their own half (I exaggerate). Torje sends all the big men into 
the box, then lashes the ball a full 5,000 yards at goal. Somner has to dive 
sharply to his left to save his dipping, thunderous drive. There’s something 
about an outrageously optimistic free-kick in a European Championship that is 
just a lot of fun to watch.

67 min: Dzemaili is in an acre of space in the Romania half. He pauses, then 
plays a lovely through ball to Embolo who breaks at speed. He can’t do much 
with the pass though, soSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> head backwards and keep 
control in the Romania half. They’re in control at the moment.

You heard this here third: 
Ron Youghal (@RYoughal) 
@TomBry <https://twitter.com/TomBry> Embolo is the future! Went to school with 
him, amazing player. Will lead the Swiss to victory!

GOAL! Romania 1-1 Switzerland (Mehmedi, 55)

Mehmedi pulls a ball back across the Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> area to Seferovic, stationary on 
the penalty spot. The ball is tapped behind for a corner … and from it Mehmedi 
rams the ball home from 15 yards! Powerful strike.

53 min: Switzerland take their turn to attack as the game comes alive - 
Dzemaili thinks about rifling in a shot but instead crosses. Probably the wrong 
option andRomania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> can clear.

52 min: Torje toddles up the left wing, with Rodriguez in close attendance. 
Somehow Torje wangles a throw-in despite being the last man to touch the ball 
before it goes out. Romania spend the next minute or so flinging dangerous 
crosses into the area, withSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> worriedly clearing them. 
Finally Torje flings in the most dangerous of the lot and Djourou somehow 
slides in, two feet from the goal, and hoofs it wide when it looked for all the 
world like he was going to score an own goal.

50 min: Xhaka gets in a tangle with the ball and is robbed by Sapunaru. In his 
haste to get the ball back, Xhaka goes in on the Romanian man, who hits the 
deck. Xhaka is shown a yellow card, but replays suggested Sapunaru simply trod 
on the Swiss player and hit the deck.

48 min: But Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> 
aren’t letting Romania have it all their own way. Xhaka lurks outside the 
Romania box, looking for all the world like he is about to fire a long-range 
rasper at goal. Instead, he plays a diagonal ball to Shaqiri, who tears into 
the box but fires his shot into Chipciu’s leg. Corner. Which is wasted.

46 min: Hoban immediately gets a chance. Stancu carves out an opening in the

shot wide of SOmner’s goal. That was probably the best chanceRomania

number 10, Arsene comes out for the unveilingin full Lordi regalia

Weird fact: I once interviewed Lordi in their full Lordi regalia. A little bit 
of behind the scenes knowledge for you: those costumes absolutely stink. Like 
proper, proper hum.

Here’s the latest from the Press Association on events in Lille: 

Police in Lille have used tear gas on fans following scuffles in the city 
centre. Supporters were seen running through the streets before officers 
attempted to disperse them by firing the gas into the crowds. Fans from 
England, Wales, Slovakia and Russia have been gathering in the city for Group B 
matches between the countries.

neutral country, you lack aggression’. Really, where do they recruit these 
people from, the past? Can the standard of commentary drop any lower?” Stay

There’s a lovely snippet from Jonathan Wilson about Romanian football in this 
Knowledge column from a few year’s back: scroll down to the 11th paragraph 
(begins “But there’s more. Jonathan Wilson points us towards etc etc”) for a 
fabulous tale about how Chinese whispers and rampant corruption caused a side 
to beat another 9-0 thanks to some extravagant extra time.

Well, Romania have had no possession and seem intent on protecting their lead 
before mounting the odd counterattack via Chipciu.Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> need a new striker and they 
need Shaqiri to turn up as, increasingly, they’re getting panicky around the 
box.

PEEP PEEP!

Schar concedes a corner, Romania’s first of the afternoon. They take it short 
and then lift the ball to the far post before a Swiss head knocks it behind for 
Romania’s second. That one is hoiked in and Seferovic heads it clear. With 
that, it’s half-time.

38 min: Pintilii has taken a knock and the Romanian physio applies some magic 
spray. When play restarts, Romania are lucky not to concede. Lichsteiner is 
played in up the right wing and clips a wonderful ball back across the area. 
Behrami is clear in the box and powers a header wide of the posts. Had that 
been on target - and it should have been, given the quality of the ball and the 
space Behrami had - it would have been 1-1. Poor fromSwitzerland

leaving Schar for dust this time but playing a poor ball into the box. He sets 
up a Romania attack though, with the ball fizzing about the Swiss box, until 
eventually a ballooning ball lands in Somner’s hands.Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> don’t like Romania running 
at them, as Corporal Jones might have said.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>, who are beginning to look a 
little tense. Rodriguez lifts an outswinger into the box but Xhaka can’t get a 
big enough portion of his head onto the ball. Goal kick.

31 min: Dzemaili pokes a good ball through to Seferovic, but does so under 
heavy attention from Pintilii. The referee decides Pintilii’s attentions are a 
little unfair and blows for a foul just outside the D. Rodriguez lines it up, 
firing the ball at Tatarusanu’s right hand post. The keeper was there to claim 
though.

27 min: Shaqiri has a nibble at Prepelita, conceding a free-kick on the left 
wing. The ball is launched into the box and the Swiss defence are all over the 
place. Sapunaru, on the penalty spot, has a chance and smashes a shot which 
clips the right hand upright and goes out.

25 min: Chipciu races clear up the Romanian left, leaving Lichsteiner for 
dust. He cuts inside, makes room for the shot and can’t quite wrap enough of 
his foot around the ball to bend the ball past Somner. He looks dangerous.

Well, Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> were 
disappointing there. For a team with such potential, they looked blunt in 
attack - though Embolo was certainly an upgrade on Seferovic - and short of 
ideas in midfield, where Xhaka and Shaqiri failed to shine.

Romania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> achieved exactly what

trying to hang onto the ball and to keep it from marauding Swiss midfielders. 
He’s clipped to the ground when the marauding Swiss midfield get sick of that 
sort of thing. Shaqiri is hauled off - and has been a bit disappointing - 
Everton’s Tarashaj replaces him. Three minutes added time.
 
88 min: Lichsteiner and Lang combine very neatly up the Swiss left wing. Lang 
clips a good cross into the area that would have destined for Embolo’s head 
and, then, the back of the neck had Tatarusanu not climbed well to claim.
 
87 min: Schar concedes a corner and Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> send forward a fair few men. 
They’re not taking this draw yet. Chiriches jumps but a Swiss defender beats 
him to the ball, a good solid clearance.
 
85 min: Free kick to Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> 20 metres outside the 
Romania box. Rodriguez lifts the ball in, the Swiss big men pile in to get on 
the end of it, Romania clear it with ease.

For anyone concerned about the Germany manager’s nether regions:

84 min: Lichsteiner, who has pushed forward now that Lang is playing right 
back, plays a nice ball into Embolo. The Swiss striker leans on Grigore ever so 
delicately and the Romanian defender hits the deck. Hmm.

83 min: For Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>, 
Lang replaces Dzemaili to bolster the Swiss defence. For Romania, Stancu - who 
has just take a knock - is replaced by Andone.
 
80 min: That said, Hoban plays an incisive ball into Torje in the Swiss area. 
All he had to do was trap it and shoot, but his touch is very heavy andRomania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> concede possession. They look 
tired and are struggling even more than normal to keep hold of the ball.
 
78 min: Perhaps chastened by that volley, Dzemaili opts not to shoot when he 
finds himself with the ball in the D. He attempts a pass to Shaqiri but the 
Romania defence clear.Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> are all over Romania at the 
moment, with the Romanians puffing hard.
 
76 min: Shaqiri blasts the free kick into the wall, it bounces back for 
Mehmedi, and he wafts a tame shot at Tatarusanu. A moment or two later, 
Dzemaili attempts to lash a first time volley at goal from a ball ballooned 
over his head. The result is not pretty. His manager stands on the touchline 
shaking his head ruefully.

Sibley/Reuters  
75 min: Grigore flattens Embolo just outside the Romania box, when the striker 
was nearly in the clear. Free kick toSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>, yellow card to Grigore. 
Fourth Romania yellow.
 
74 min: Switzerland heap more pressure on Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania>. Mehmedi lurks on the Swiss 
left, then clips a delicious ball high across the area. It goes over Embolo and 
finds Shaqiri unmarked. Unfortunately, it is behind him and he attempts an 
outrageous bicycle kick, with the ball ballooning off his shin and high over 
the goal. Oh.

73 min: Embolo is nearly clear again - though may have been offside - and 
Tatarusanu has to race out from his goalline to intercept the long through ball 
from Mehmedi. Embolo is certainly causing more problems than Seferovic.

“For a game I thought would be a purists’ delight, this has been pretty 
entertaining stuff. I wouldn’t say it’s of stunning quality, but fun goes a 
long way,” reckons Kári Tulinius, who is right.

 
71 min: Embolo tries to wiggle free in the Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> area but for all his power, his 
touch is a little agricultural. He knocks the ball so far past Chiriches it 
goes out for a goal kick.
 
69 min: That’s always good to see. Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> win a free kick that is 
virtually in their own half (I exaggerate). Torje sends all the big men into 
the box, then lashes the ball a full 5,000 yards at goal. Somner has to dive 
sharply to his left to save his dipping, thunderous drive. There’s something 
about an outrageously optimistic free-kick in a European Championship that is 
just a lot of fun to watch.
 
68 min: Lichsteiner swishes another good cross into the Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> area, taking two defenders out 
of the game. Embolo gets up to head it in, but catches the ball too fine and it 
goes out for a kick.

chance. Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters  
67 min: Dzemaili is in an acre of space in the Romania half. He pauses, then 
plays a lovely through ball to Embolo who breaks at speed. He can’t do much 
with the pass though, soSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> head backwards and keep 
control in the Romania half. They’re in control at the moment.

65 min: Hoban hoists a good ball into Keseru - or Kerazoo, as Andy Townsend is 
calling him on ITV - and he has a free header at goal, which he does not make 
the most of.

64 min: Seferovic is finally put out of his misery. That’s his second poor 
game in a row.Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> 
replace him with the 19-year-old Embolo, a fast, effective and physically 
imposing striker who probably should have started (he’ll score an own goal now).
 
60 min: That’s the end of Romania’s Razvan Rat. He’s replaced by Filip, 13 
years his junior and approximately 110 caps less experienced.
 
58 min: Shaqiri stands over a ball 10 yards outside the Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> box, having won the free-kick by 
being flattened while dribbling at pace at the area. He takes a few steps back 
then clobbers a left-foot shot at goal. It’s a yard too high.
 
57 min: That was a netbuster from Mehmedi, a thunderous left-foot thrash into 
the opposite corner. Oof. Breel Embolo was about to come on forSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>, had taken his tracksuit 
off, done his warm-up and then that goal went in. He’s now sat back down.
 
Mehmedi pulls a ball back across the Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> area to Seferovic, stationary on 
the penalty spot. The ball is tapped behind for a corner … and from it Mehmedi 
rams the ball home from 15 yards! Powerful strike.

53 min: Switzerland take their turn to attack as the game comes alive - 
Dzemaili thinks about rifling in a shot but instead crosses. Probably the wrong 
option andRomania <https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> can clear.
 
52 min: Torje toddles up the left wing, with Rodriguez in close attendance. 
Somehow Torje wangles a throw-in despite being the last man to touch the ball 
before it goes out. Romania spend the next minute or so flinging dangerous 
crosses into the area, withSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> worriedly clearing them. 
Finally Torje flings in the most dangerous of the lot and Djourou somehow 
slides in, two feet from the goal, and hoofs it wide when it looked for all the 
world like he was going to score an own goal.

50 min: Xhaka gets in a tangle with the ball and is robbed by Sapunaru. In his 
haste to get the ball back, Xhaka goes in on the Romanian man, who hits the 
deck. Xhaka is shown a yellow card, but replays suggested Sapunaru simply trod 
on the Swiss player and hit the deck.

48 min: But Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> 
aren’t letting Romania have it all their own way. Xhaka lurks outside the 
Romania box, looking for all the world like he is about to fire a long-range 
rasper at goal. Instead, he plays a diagonal ball to Shaqiri, who tears into 
the box but fires his shot into Chipciu’s leg. Corner. Which is wasted.

47 min: Romania have started brightly, and Torje attempts to race past the 
Swiss left back Rodriguez. Had he managed it, he would have had a simple pull 
back to Keseru. But he didn’t.
 
46 min: Hoban immediately gets a chance. Stancu carves out an opening in the 
Swiss box, lays the ball off to the new man and he rasps an outside of the boot 
shot wide of SOmner’s goal. That was probably the best chanceRomania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania> have had all match in open play.
 
We’re off again: Romania’s Hoban replaces Pintilii, who was injured at the end 
of the first half.

Here’s the latest from the Press Association on events in Lille: 

Police in Lille have used tear gas on fans following scuffles in the city 
centre. Supporters were seen running through the streets before officers 
attempted to disperse them by firing the gas into the crowds. Fans from 
England, Wales, Slovakia and Russia have been gathering in the city for Group B 
matches between the countries.
 
Kevin Porter emails: “ITV commentator: ‘Maybe if you are brought up in an 
neutral country, you lack aggression’. Really, where do they recruit these 
people from, the past? Can the standard of commentary drop any lower?” Stay 
tuned to this here commentary on the Guardian, Kevin, and you may well find out.
 
There’s a lovely snippet from Jonathan Wilson about Romanian football in this 
Knowledge column from a few year’s back: scroll down to the 11th paragraph 
(begins “But there’s more. Jonathan Wilson points us towards etc etc”) for a 
fabulous tale about how Chinese whispers and rampant corruption caused a side 
to beat another 9-0 thanks to some extravagant extra time.

Well, Romania have had no possession and seem intent on protecting their lead 
before mounting the odd counterattack via Chipciu.Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> need a new striker and they 
need Shaqiri to turn up as, increasingly, they’re getting panicky around the 
box.
 
Schar concedes a corner, Romania’s first of the afternoon. They take it short 
and then lift the ball to the far post before a Swiss head knocks it behind for 
Romania’s second. That one is hoiked in and Seferovic heads it clear. With 
that, it’s half-time.
 
45 min: Stancu sells Djourou a dummy and goes past him. Somner, in the Swiss 
goal, thinks about coming and Stancu’s eyes light up but Schar is there to 
clear things up. Nearly a good breakaway move fromRomania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/romania>.
 
43 min: Romania have had almost no possession and could not care less about 
that.Switzerland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> pass the 
ball through them, carving another chance for Seferovic who heads the ball at 
goal but the Romania keeper claims.
 
41 min: Mehmedi breaks clear in the Romania area and rifles a shot from a 
tight angle. Chiriches dives in and blocks the ball before it gets further than 
six inches from Mehmedi’s boot.Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> do very little with the 
corner, and Romania break but, instead of waiting for more numbers, they blare 
a shot high and wide over Somner’s goal.
 
38 min: Pintilii has taken a knock and the Romanian physio applies some magic 
spray. When play restarts, Romania are lucky not to concede. Lichsteiner is 
played in up the right wing and clips a wonderful ball back across the area. 
Behrami is clear in the box and powers a header wide of the posts. Had that 
been on target - and it should have been, given the quality of the ball and the 
space Behrami had - it would have been 1-1. Poor fromSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>.

36 min: Keseru pulls Behrami to the ground for no good reason: yellow card.
 
35 min: The dangerous Chipciu breaks clear down the Romania left again, 
leaving Schar for dust this time but playing a poor ball into the box. He sets 
up a Romania attack though, with the ball fizzing about the Swiss box, until 
eventually a ballooning ball lands in Somner’s hands.Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland> don’t like Romania running 
at them, as Corporal Jones might have said.

34 min: Corner to Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/switzerland>, who are beginning to look a 
little tense. Rodriguez lifts an outswinger into the box but Xhaka can’t get a 
big enough portion of his head onto the ball. Goal kick.
 
31 min: Dzemaili pokes a good ball through to Seferovic, but does so under 
heavy attention from Pintilii. The referee decides Pintilii’s attentions are a 
little unfair and blows for a foul just outside the D. Rodriguez lines it up, 
firing the ball at Tatarusanu’s right hand post. The keeper was there to claim 
though.

27 min: Shaqiri has a nibble at Prepelita, conceding a free-kick on the left 
wing. The ball is launched into the box and the Swiss defence are all over the 
place. Sapunaru, on the penalty spot, has a chance and smashes a shot which 
clips the right hand upright and goes out.
 
25 min: Chipciu races clear up the Romanian left, leaving Lichsteiner for 
dust. He cuts inside, makes room for the shot and can’t quite wrap enough of 
his foot around the ball to bend the ball past Somner. He looks dangerous.

The Swiss fans know how to tailgate party:
