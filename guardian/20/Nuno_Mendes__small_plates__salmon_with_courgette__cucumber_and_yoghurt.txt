As the water gets colder in the north of Scotland, the salmon gorge on 
plankton that have a far higher fat content than in summer, producing nicely 
fattened fish. This quick-cured version will keep in the fridge for three or 
four days – but if you cure overnight, it will last even longer.

Serves 2
270g salmon (2 fillets)
4 heaped tbsp salt
4 heaped tbsp caster sugar
Lemon zest

For the cucumber and yoghurt salad


1 cucumber, cut into batons
1 courgette, cut into batons
Pinch of salt and ground white pepper
Splash of lemon juice
2 tbsp thick Greek yoghurt
Pinch ground cumin

For the yoghurt sauce


4 tbsp single cream
2 tbsp thick Greek yoghurt
Salt

To garnish


Extra virgin olive oil
Toasted ground cumin

Combine the salad ingredients and let it marinate in a bowl for a couple of 
minutes. Mix together the salt and sugar and bury the salmon fillets in it, 
ensuring it’s covered on all sides. Mix the cream and yoghurt with a little 
salt for the sauce and set aside.

Leave the salmon to cure at room temperature for 45 minutes then remove the 
fillets from the cure, rinse and pat dry. Cut off the skin and slice thinly.

Serve with a little lemon zest on top, the salad and the yoghurt sauce on the 
side. Drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle some of the cumin on top.
