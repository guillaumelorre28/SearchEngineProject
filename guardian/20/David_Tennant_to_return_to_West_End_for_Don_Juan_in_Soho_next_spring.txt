David Tennant <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-tennant> is to return 
to the West End stage, playing a lothario in Patrick Marber’s play Don Juan in 
Soho.

Tennant will star in a new production of the play at Wyndham’s theatre in 
London next spring, directed byMarber

himself.

Marber’s contemporary take on the classic Molière comedy Dom Juan, premiered 
at the Donmar Warehouse in December 2006, directed by Michael Grandage.

Despite some good reviews and praise for its then leading man, Rhys Ifans, 
there was noWest End <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/westend> transfer, 
meaning few people would have seen it.

The Guardian’s Michael Billington said it offered “a rutting rake’s modern 
progress” but it lacked the “subversiveness” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/dec/07/theatre2> of Molière’s original.

The Daily Telegraph’s Charles Spencer was far more enthusiastic, calling it 
“savagely funny, disturbingly dark and disgracefully sexy”.

Tennant, helped by Doctor Who, is firmly established as one of the UK’s most 
popular actors. His last stage role was in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s 
production of Richard II, part of its King and Country cycle of plays presented 
at theBrooklyn Academy of Music in New York 
<https://www.bam.org/theater/2016/richard-ii> last spring.

He is thought to have spent much of the summer and autumn filming what will be 
the third and final season of Broadchurch for ITV, reprising his role as DI 
Alec Hardy alongside Olivia Colman as DS Ellie Miller.

The last time he appeared in the West End was also at the Wyndham’s, playing 
Benedick alongside Catherine Tate’s Beatricein a memorable Josie Rourke version 
of Much Ado About Nothing

in 2011.
