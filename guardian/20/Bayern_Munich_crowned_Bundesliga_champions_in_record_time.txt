Bastian Schweinsteiger scored with a back-heel to deflected Phillip Lahm's 
cross past goalkeeper Oka Nikolov in the 52nd minute for Bayern's 11th win in 
succession.

Defending two-times champions Borussia Dortmund came from two goals down to 
beat Augsburg 4-2 at home but were unable to prevent Bayern from sealing their 
23rd German championship.

Schalke won 2-0 at Werder Bremen, Bayer Leverkusen drew 1-1 with Wolfsburg, 
and Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach beat the bottom side Greuther Fuerth 1-0.

Such has been Bayern's dominance of the German top flight that no other side 
have claimed the title this early in the Bundesliga's 50 years. Victory over 
Eintracht was their 11th in a row, having dropped points only four times all 
season.

Bayern already eliminated second-placed Borussia Dortmund from the German Cup 
and have one foot in the Champions League semi-finalsafter beating Juventus 2-0

, raising the prospect of a potential treble for Jupp Heynckes' side in his 
last season in charge.
