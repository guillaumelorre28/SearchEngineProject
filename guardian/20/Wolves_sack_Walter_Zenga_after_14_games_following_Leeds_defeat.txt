The club, 18th in the league, said in a statement on their website 
<http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/statement-walter-zenga-departs-wolves-3382950.aspx>
: “Wolves have announced Walter Zenga’s contract has been terminated with 
immediate effect. Stefano Cusin, assistant head coach, has also left the club.

“Wolves will be conducting a thorough process to recruit a new head coach and 
won’t be revealing any timescales associated with this important task. Rob 
Edwards, first-team coach, has been placed in interim charge of the first team, 
supported by Under-23s coach, Scott Sellars.

“The club would like to extend their thanks and best wishes to Walter and 
Stefano for their contribution to Wolves during the season so far. Wolves will 
be making no further comment at this stage.”

The Italian took over from Kenny Jackett in July. His latest setback, a 1-0 
home defeat to Leeds United, was enough to convince the club’s new owners, 
Fosun International, to make a change.
