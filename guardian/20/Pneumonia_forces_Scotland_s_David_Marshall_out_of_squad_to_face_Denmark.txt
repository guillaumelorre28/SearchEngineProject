<https://www.theguardian.com/football/scotland> squad for the friendly against 
Denmark at Hampden Park on Tuesday. The Cardiff goalkeeper has pneumonia.

The Hull forward Shaun Maloney has been called up. He was not in the squads 
Gordon Strachan named for the friendlies against Czech Republic, where anIkechi 
Anya goal gave Scotland a 1-0 away win <http:>, or for the visit of the Danes.

The Dundee goalkeeper Scott Bain, the back-up to Allan McGregor in Prague on 
Thursday, will remain with the squad, as will the Birmingham defender Paul 
Caddis, who made his debut as a late substitute against the Czechs. The Norwich 
full-back Steven Whittaker is back in the squad after missing the Czech game 
because his wife was giving birth. Steven Fletcher, who sat out the midweek 
trip with a chest infection, will join up with the squad later.

The Scotland coach Stuart McCall was encouraged by the win over the Czech 
Republic as preparations continued for theDenmark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/denmark> game with the second squad.

He said: “It was nice to get a clean sheet and to go to the Czech Republic and 
win 1-0 is terrific. There were some bright individual performances, Allan 
McGregor was outstanding on the night. Ross McCormack showed he can play up 
there on his own if need be and Matt Phillips, when he came on, is a bit 
different to what we have, a lot of strength and pace.

“But all in all a lot of good things came out of it. Other things that we have 
looked at already, things that we need to improve on, which we will be able to 
show the second group.”
