Joey Barton’s Hampden hearing over alleged betting offences has been put back 
to 17 November.

Barton was originally due to face a Scottish Football Association judicial 
panel on 27 October but it is understood the suspendedRangers

to prepare his case this week.

The former Newcastle United player had been given until Wednesday this week to 
respond but the SFA has confirmed the hearing date has been changed.

Barton was charged with placing 44 bets

 on games between 1 July and 15 September this year. SFA rules ban players from 
betting on any football match, anywhere in the world.

It is understood Barton did not bet on any games involving Rangers – although 
he reportedly placed money on Celtic to lose heavily in their Champions League 
game in Barcelona, a match the Hoops lost 7-0.

Barton was due to return to training this week after serving a month-long club 
suspension following an bust-up with the manager, Mark Warburton, and team-mate 
Andy Halliday.

However, Rangers announced on Sunday that they had told him to stay away

 from both Ibrox and their Auchenhowie training base for another seven days 
after opening a “formal disciplinary procedure”.

If Rangers do not broker a peace deal or find grounds to sack him, they face 
having to pay off the former England international’s two-year contract, which 
is worth £2m.
