Inter are looking to sign a midfielder in January and have asked Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> whether they would consider 
letting Lucas leave on a short-term basis and have been told that the 
Merseyside club would not stand in his way should he wish to move to Italy on 
loan.

The 29-year-old Lucas is Inter’s preferred choice but Lass Diarra (Marseille), 
John Obi Mikel (Chelsea), Milan Badelj (Fiorentina) and Luiz Gustavo 
(Wolfsburg) are other options.

Lucas has been at Liverpool since 2007 but has had limited playing time under 
Jürgen Klopp. Joël Matip and Dejan Lovren are first choice in central defence 
and the German manager has plenty of options in central midfield with Jordan 
Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum, Adam Lallana, Emre Can, Kevin Stewart and Marko 
Grujic all capable of playing in that position.

Inter are seventh in Serie A and their form has improved dramatically since 
Stefano Piolo took over from Frank de Boer at the beginning of November.
