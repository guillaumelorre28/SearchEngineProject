The Football Association said the former Luton, Crystal Palace and Port Vale 
player “was involved in an act of violent conduct in or around the 77th minute 
of the game”, which Rochdale won 1-0. It is believed the incident concerned the
Oldham <https://www.theguardian.com/football/oldham> defender Peter Clarke, who 
was struck by an elbow near the edge of his six-yard box as a Rochdale attack 
broke down close to the corner flag.

The FA’s statement 
<http://www.thefa.com/news/2016/nov/04/calvin-andrew-banned-for-12-games-041116>
 said the incident was not seen by the match officials but caught on video: “It 
was alleged the standard punishment of three matches that would otherwise apply 
would be clearly insufficient. The player admitted his behaviour constituted 
violent conduct but denied the clearly insufficient element of the charge. 
However, this was found proven following an Independent Regulatory Commission 
hearing.”

Andrew, who signed a new one-year contract in the summer having moved to 
Rochdale in 2014, will not play again this year.

Only Eric Cantona has been given a more hefty sentence after the Manchester 
United forward was banned for nine months in 1995 for striking a Crystal Palace 
supporter. Joey Bartonwas also banned for 12 matches 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/23/joey-barton-12-game-ban-fa> 
in 2012 for two charges of violent conduct in QPR’s 3-2 defeat at Manchester 
City.
