The Real Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid> coach 
Zinedine Zidane lauded his side’s never-say-die attitude after seeing them 
claim a dramatic Super Cup win over Sevilla.

Madrid looked dead and buried as they trailed 2-1 deep into stoppage time in 
Trondheim, but Sergio Ramos’s equaliser sent the match to extra-time where Dani 
Carvajal scored a stunning late goal to give the Champions League winners

 3-2 in Norway, on Tuesday.

Carvajal went on a weaving run in the Sevilla

lifting the ball over the goalkeeper Sergio Rico.

Zidane said afterwards: “In football you never know what’s going to happen. 
The good thing about tonight is that we knew it was going to be difficult, but 
we never gave up.


“They got ahead in a key part of the game, but we never gave up and Sergio’s 
goal in the last minute brought us back to life.”

He added: “Second title [as Madrid coach], first of this season and I’m very 
happy with the effort the guys have made.”

Madrid, who were without the Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Toni Kroos, 
had taken a 21st-minute lead through a superb goal from the 20-year-old Marco 
Asensio but Sevilla were back on terms just before the break through Franco 
Vázquez.

Sevilla went ahead with 18 minutes left when Yevhen Konoplyanka slotted home 
from the penalty spot after Vitolo had been tripped by Ramos.

That looked to have won Sevilla the title but Ramos made amends for his foul 
by heading home in stoppage time, and then full-back Carvajal proved an 
unlikely winner with a last-gasp solo goal sealing a 3-2 victory.

The former Sevilla defender Ramos, who also scored a stoppage-time equaliser 
in the 2014 Champions League final against Atletico Madrid before his side went 
on to win 4-1 in extra-time, said on his club’s website: “It’s incredible. 
Until the final whistle goes you need to continue fighting because by fighting 
to the end you get your rewards.

“More than anything you need to highlight the collective work of the team and 
its fight. The team, despite the players missing, have shown what they are 
about here and to start the season with a title is always incredible.”

The new Sevilla coach, Jorge Sampaoli, whose side lost Timothée Kolodziejczak 
to a red card in extra time, said: “I’m proud of the way we played.

“Without much time to work together this team showed courage against the 
champions of Europe.”

The Europa League holders, who have now lost three Super Cups in succession, 
do not have much time to dwell on the loss as they play the first leg of the 
Spanish Supercup against Barcelona on Sunday.

“Tomorrow we will start to think about what comes next and help the players 
recover,” added Sampaoli.

“These types of cups are quite prejudicial to your preparations (for the new 
season). We had to cut our preparations to arrive at this game. It will be a 
case of counting on those players who are 100 per cent.”
