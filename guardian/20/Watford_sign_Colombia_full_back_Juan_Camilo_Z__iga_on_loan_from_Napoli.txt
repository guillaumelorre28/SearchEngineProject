 and Jerome Sinclair as new signings at Watford this summer.

Having started his career with Atlético Nacional in his homeland, Zúñiga moved 
to the Italian side Siena in 2008 before joining Napoli a year later for €8.5m.

of the newWatford head coach Walter Mazzarri

, and helped them win the Coppa Italia in 2012 and 2014. Zúñiga was on loan at 
Bologna for the second half of last season.

 – that Napoli publicly moved to defend the full-back.

“For the Brazilian champion we send our best wishes for a speedy recovery,” 
they said. “At the same time the club expresses its support for Zúñiga, who has 
been subjected to fierce criticism and threats of all kinds, for a foul in play 
that was not malicious but unfortunate in its consequences.”
