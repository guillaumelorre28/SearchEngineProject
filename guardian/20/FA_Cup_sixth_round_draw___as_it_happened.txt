So, Everton v Chelsea is the obvious stand-out, while Alan Pardew returns to 
Reading for a tie both teams will be reasonably pleased with. If they can book 
their places in the last eight, Arsenal andManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> will both be at home, 
although Watford and West Ham will be challenging opponents. That’s your lot 
from me – here are the match reports from today’s action.Cheerio.

No8: Everton

Last but not least, it’s Everton, another Premier League side whose best 
chance of glory this season lies in this competition. The Toffeesbeat 
Bournemouth yesterday

Carlisle; they’ve had a relatively straightforward draw thus far in their quest 
for a sixth FA Cup, and a first since 1995.

No7: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> or Hull City

Arsenal are still on for the three-peat, a feat not seen in the FA Cup since 
Blackburn, back in the 19th century. They will have to negotiate a tricky 
replay with Hull, 2014 finalists and Championship leaders, after thegoalless 
draw at the Emirates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/20/arsenal-hull-city-fa-cup-match-report>
 yesterday. You wouldn’t bet against a team unbeaten in the Cup since 2013, 
when they lost in the last 16 to... Blackburn.

Another side never to lift the famous old pot, Palace are in the 
quarter-finals courtesy of a dashing Cup run at odds with their league form.

Tottenham at White Hart Lane

and haven’t been as far as the quarter-finals since 1995.

No5: West Ham United

The Hammers are a force to be reckoned with, with Slaven Bilic prioritising 
the Cup with the team sitting very comfortably in the Premier League table. 
West Ham swept past Blackburn earlier today, adding to thememorable replay 
victory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/09/west-ham-liverpool-fa-cup-fourth-round-replay-match-report>
 over Liverpool in round four. Having lost in the final in 2006, they’re still 
seeking a first FA Cup since 1980, when they were a second division side.

No3: Watford

Three 1-0 wins in a row have the Hornets into the last eight with the minimum 
of fuss. Newcastle, Nottingham Forestand Leeds United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/20/watford-leeds-united-fa-cup-match-report>
 have all been seen off, and with Quique Sánchez Flores’s team safely in 
mid-table, this represents an excellent chance for Watford to win their first 
ever FA Cup, and bury the hurt of 1984, when they lost in the final. This is 
their first trip to the quarter-finals since 2007.

By the way, it’s finished Chelsea 5-1 Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/feb/21/chelsea-v-manchester-city-fa-cup-fifth-round-live>

No2: Reading

The Royals are the only side from outside the top flight guaranteed a 
quarter-final place. They’re also the only lower league team to beat Premier 
League opponents,sending West Brom packing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/20/reading-west-bromwich-albion-fa-cup-match-report>
 on Saturday. They’ve also beaten Huddersfield and Walsall on their way to the 
last eight. Reading have never won the FA Cup, but are enjoying something of a 
golden age in the competition; this is their fourth quarter-final appearance in 
the last seven tournaments, and they took Arsenal all the way in last year’s 
semis.

No1: Chelsea

I’m calling it: Chelsea will be ball No1 in the draw, as they run down the 
clock against Man City’s youth team. Guus Hiddink’s team are looking for an 
eighth FA Cup, having last won the trophy in 2012. They will be glad only one 
other City remain, having been knocked out in the last three campaigns by 
Manchester City (twice) and Bradford City. So far, they’ve eliminated 
Scunthorpe, MK Dons, and nowManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> by an aggregate score of 
11-2 (and counting).

Welcome, then, to the business end of the FA Cup. There are 11 teams still in 
contention, althoughManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, currently 4-1 down at 
Chelsea, won’t be making the final draw. It’s an open-looking field, with big 
guns, dark horses and plucky outsiders all present and correct. The draw is 
coming up shortly after 6pm; we’ll take a look at the runners and riders in the 
meantime.

No8: Everton

Last but not least, it’s Everton, another Premier League side whose best 
chance of glory this season lies in this competition. The Toffeesbeat 
Bournemouth yesterday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/20/bournemouth-everton-fa-cup-match-report>
, following up victories – and clean sheets – against Dagenham & Redbridge and 
Carlisle; they’ve had a relatively straightforward draw thus far in their quest 
for a sixth FA Cup, and a first since 1995.

No7: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> or Hull City

Arsenal are still on for the three-peat, a feat not seen in the FA Cup since 
Blackburn, back in the 19th century. They will have to negotiate a tricky 
replay with Hull, 2014 finalists and Championship leaders, after thegoalless 
draw at the Emirates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/20/arsenal-hull-city-fa-cup-match-report>
 yesterday. You wouldn’t bet against a team unbeaten in the Cup since 2013, 
when they lost in the last 16 to... Blackburn.
 
No6: Crystal Palace

Another side never to lift the famous old pot, Palace are in the 
quarter-finals courtesy of a dashing Cup run at odds with their league form. 
Alan Pardew’s team put Southampton and Stoke to the sword, beforeshocking 
Tottenham at White Hart Lane 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/21/tottenham-hotspur-crystal-palace-fa-cup-match-report>
 earlier today. The Eagles have only made the final once before, back in 1990, 
and haven’t been as far as the quarter-finals since 1995.
 
No5: West Ham United

The Hammers are a force to be reckoned with, with Slaven Bilic prioritising 
the Cup with the team sitting very comfortably in the Premier League table. 
West Ham swept past Blackburn earlier today, adding to thememorable replay 
victory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/09/west-ham-liverpool-fa-cup-fourth-round-replay-match-report>
 over Liverpool in round four. Having lost in the final in 2006, they’re still 
seeking a first FA Cup since 1980, when they were a second division side.

earlier today. Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP/Getty Images  
No4: Shrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> Town or 
Manchester United

Whoever draws ball No4 will either face League One strugglers Shrewsbury, who 
would be making only their third quarter-final appearance, orManchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>, 11-time winners and 
hungry for silverware. They’ll have to wait until Monday night, or longer, to 
find out.
 
No3: Watford

Three 1-0 wins in a row have the Hornets into the last eight with the minimum 
of fuss. Newcastle, Nottingham Forestand Leeds United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/20/watford-leeds-united-fa-cup-match-report>
 have all been seen off, and with Quique Sánchez Flores’s team safely in 
mid-table, this represents an excellent chance for Watford to win their first 
ever FA Cup, and bury the hurt of 1984, when they lost in the final. This is 
their first trip to the quarter-finals since 2007.

. Yowza!
 
No2: Reading

The Royals are the only side from outside the top flight guaranteed a 
quarter-final place. They’re also the only lower league team to beat Premier 
League opponents,sending West Brom packing

 on Saturday. They’ve also beaten Huddersfield and Walsall on their way to the 
last eight. Reading have never won the FA Cup, but are enjoying something of a 
golden age in the competition; this is their fourth quarter-final appearance in 
the last seven tournaments, and they took Arsenal all the way in last year’s 
semis.

No1: Chelsea

I’m calling it: Chelsea will be ball No1 in the draw, as they run down the 
clock against Man City’s youth team. Guus Hiddink’s team are looking for an 
eighth FA Cup, having last won the trophy in 2012. They will be glad only one 
other City remain, having been knocked out in the last three campaigns by 
Manchester City (twice) and Bradford City. So far, they’ve eliminated 
Scunthorpe, MK Dons, and nowManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> by an aggregate score of 
11-2 (and counting).
 
Welcome, then, to the business end of the FA Cup. There are 11 teams still in 
contention, althoughManchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, currently 4-1 down at 
Chelsea, won’t be making the final draw. It’s an open-looking field, with big 
guns, dark horses and plucky outsiders all present and correct. The draw is 
coming up shortly after 6pm; we’ll take a look at the runners and riders in the 
meantime.
 
Good afternoon. Here are the teams in the hat (and their numbers) for the 
sixth round draw:


1 Chelsea
2 Reading
3 Watford
4 Shrewsbury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/shrewsbury> Town or 
Manchester United
5 West Ham United
6 Crystal Palace
7 Arsenal or Hull City
8 Everton
