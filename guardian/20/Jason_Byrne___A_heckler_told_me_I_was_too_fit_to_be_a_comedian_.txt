The funniest standup I’ve ever seen

Billy Connolly. I saw him in Dublin when I was 16 and all I wanted him to do 
was to stop talking because I couldn’t catch my breath from laughing. He paints 
pictures in your head with his beautiful, fantastic use of words. He will 
always be my number one hero.

The funniest heckle I’ve ever had

“Get off, you’re fit!” A person actually thought I was too fit-looking to be a 
comic.

The funniest thing that shouldn’t be funny

When people fall over in the street.

The funniest film I’ve ever seen

The Jerk. It is Steve Martin at his best, full of silly jokes and great 
moments. He made comedy history with that movie. One of my favourite scenes is 
when he thumbs a lift, he gets into truck and asks the driver where he’s 
headed. “To the end of the fence,” says the driver. “Great,” says the Jerk, and 
he then gets out a few feet from where he was thumbing a lift.

The funniest hairstyle I’ve ever had

A very uneven bowl cut.

The funniest number

92.

The funniest joke I’ve ever heard

“I’m a liquorice farmer.” “Oh, what do you do?” “All sorts.” Boom!

The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen 

Fork Handles, Four Candles by the Two Ronnies. I sat on the floor of my living 
room as my dad coughed and spluttered his laughter out through his red face; I 
thought he was going to need an ambulance. This sketch is the perfect lesson in 
playing on words, and Ronnie Barker was a genius at it.

The funniest word

Gravel.

The funniest TV show I’ve ever seen

Family Guy. It’s been such an amazing outlet for things you are just not 
allowed to say on stage or screen unless you’re a cartoon. When it gets dark, 
it gets really dark; my favourite kind of comedy, that I never do on stage.
