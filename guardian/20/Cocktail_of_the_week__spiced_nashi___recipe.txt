The sweet pear, slightly salty agave in the tequila, lime and autumnal syrup 
combine to winning effect. Drink after a fish dinner. Serves one.

½ Asian pear (or slightly unripe william pear) plus 2 thin slices to garnish
50ml tequila (we use Arette reposado 
<http://www.tequilaarette.com/?s=producto&tp=arette_reposado>)
25ml fresh lime juice
15ml cinnamon syrup (shop bought – try Monin 
<https://www.monin.com/en-gb/products/premium-syrups/monin-cinnamon-syrup> – or 
homemade with brown sugar, water, cinnamon and a dash of vanilla)
Demerara sugar

Muddle the pear and tequila, add the lime juice and syrup, and shake over ice 
until chilled. Strain into a chilled martini glass. Dip each pear slice halfway 
into the drink and then the sugar, to coat (caramelise with a blowtorch, if you 
like), lay on top of the drink and serve.
