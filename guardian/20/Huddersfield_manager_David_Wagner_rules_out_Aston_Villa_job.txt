The Huddersfield <https://www.theguardian.com/football/huddersfield> manager, 
David Wagner, has apparently ruled himself out of the running for the 
managerial vacancy at Aston Villa.

The German had been identified as a potential successor to Roberto Di Matteo 
after the former Champions League winner was sacked this week

.

Wagner, previously part of Jürgen Klopp’s staff as the manager of Borussia 
Dortmund’s second team,has impressed Villa after giving Huddersfield realistic 
ambitions of returning to the top division for the first time since 1972

.

However, the Huddersfield chairman, Dean Hoyle, has been assured that Wagner 
will not leave the John Smith’s Stadium for any other Championship club.

Hoyle told the club’s official website: “The club doesn’t want to get into a 
situation where it has to comment every time David or a player is linked with a 
move away, but setting the position out once will help to set our fans’ minds 
at ease.

“Like everyone, I know David has aspirations to manage at the highest level – 
but I also know he wants that to be with Huddersfield, which we’re all working 
to make possible in the future. David has told me that he would never leave us 
for another Championship club, regardless of which club that is.”

Wagner’s decision appears to leave the former Birmingham City manager Steve 
Bruce as the favourite for the Villa job.
