Inspirational reflections from Liz Hurley, who informs something called Heathy 
Living magazine <http://www.healthylivingmagazine.us/Articles/4956/>: “None of 
my friends have had plastic surgery yet and nor have I. Most of us are still – 
just – in our 40s.”

Your 40s? Elizabeth, that is nothing – Joan Collins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/joan-collins> is 81, and has famously 
never gone anywhere near cosmetic enhancement, preferring to achieve it all 
with tit tape and Vaseline. “I’m not into Botox or ‘lifting’,” Joanie sniffed 
a while back. “Believe me – I’ve seen such sights, it’s put me off totally.”

“You know what they say about plastic surgery?” she opined soon after. “It’s 
the plain woman’s revenge.”

Once again, we must thank the celebrities for their time.
