Forty years after it happened the New South Wales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales> government will 
apologise to the families who lost loved ones in the Granville train disaster.

Eighty-three people died in the tragedy on 18 January 1977 and another 213 
were injured when a commuter train derailed near Granville railway station and 
a bridge collapsed on to the carriages in 1977.

And now those affected will get an apology, the transport minister, Andrew 
Constance, told the ABC 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-14/granville-train-disaster-nsw-government-to-apologise-to-families/8182976>
.

“Obviously everyone’s deeply sorry for what has occurred,” Constance said. 
“Over the years, people have had to cope with what was one of the most horrific 
tragedies in the nation’s history.”

At the time, the then NSW premier, Neville Wran, described the state of the 
railway system as “ramshackle”.

Investigations and inquiries revealed an alarming lack of investment in 
maintenance and ageing infrastructure, and following the disaster, the state 
government borrowed heavily to modernise the railway.
