and Jenson Button have each been hit with a 25-place grid penalty for Sunday’s

race.

On Friday Alonso – who is still looking for his first points of the season – 
was given a 20-place penalty after McLaren changed his engine. That was 
increased to 25 places because he changed his gearbox after coming to a halt 
during Saturday morning’s practice run.

McLaren also learned before Saturday’s qualifying session that Button would be 
demoted 25 places for having a power unit change ahead of Sunday’s race. He was 
dropped 15 places in the last race in Canada because of repairs that had to be 
done following a failure in practice. It is impossible to be demoted further 
back than 20th on the grid, so Button and Alonso will also be hit by time 
penalties during the race.

Button said on Friday, before news of the penalty was confirmed: “I’m probably 
going to start at the back. And then Sunday, who knows? With penalties, you 
sort of really need a safety car to bring you back into the game. Hopefully 
that will be the case and we can race.”

Red Bull’s Australian Daniel Ricciardo and the Russian Daniil Kvyat, taking 
part in their “home” grand prix, also face 10-place grid drops following engine 
changes. Regulations stipulate drivers must make four engines last the entire 
season or pay a penalty.
