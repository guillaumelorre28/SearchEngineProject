: “I have an official enquiry from the WWE. It’s about working for them as a 
wrestler. I will listen. I don’t shit my pants. Why should I immediately say 
no? Wrestling is very popular, especially in the [United] States. I will go 
through the enquiry with my agent next week.”

Wiese, who has six international caps for Germany and was part of his 
country’s World Cup squad in 2010, has drastically transformed his physique and 
now weighs 115kg (18st 1lb). It has been suggested that Wiese would spend 
around a year training in Florida and could then become the lead wrestler in 
the WWE’s plans for Germany, where events are now being broadcast on 
free-to-air television for the first time in 12 years.

Wiese revealed this summer than he turned down the chance to be Iker 
Casillas’s No2 at Real Madrid in 2012, and instead moved from Werder Bremen to 
Hoffenheim, where he was made club captain. However, the German suffered a dip 
in form and lost his place to former Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes in 
2013 and admitted his time at Hoffenheim had become “like a horror story” after 
suffering fan protests.

Despite having a contract that ran until 2016, Wiese’s contract was mutually 
terminated in January this year, allowing the 32-year-old to concentrate on his 
new hobby. “I had to deal with all the negativity, and lifting weights is fun,” 
he added.
