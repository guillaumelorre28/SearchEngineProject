“I have always known West Ham as a great club. I have always been watching 
them. West Ham’s a great club and I am very, very happy and very, very excited 
that I am here,” Emenike told West Ham TV.

“I’ve known him [Bilic] for years. When he was at Lokomotiv Moscow I was at 
Spartak Moscow, then he came to Besiktas and I was in Fenerbahce, so we have 
known each other for a long time. I’m happy to be here and happy to play for 
him.

“We have followed each other’s careers and thank God we are here today and we 
are here together.”

Emenike added: “The Premier League is the best in the world. It is everyone’s 
dream to come and play here. I am excited to be here.

“But it is not always just about the player. It is teamwork and it is all 
about us as a team. I am here to play with the team and work with the team.”

Emenike, capped 37 times by Nigeria, spent part of this season on loan at the 
Arabian Gulf League side Al-Ain in the United Arab Emirates.

The Hammers have the option to make the transfer permanent in the summer and 
the forward will provide options for Bilic withAndy Carroll sidelined again by
