It is not for everyone, living out here. It takes a special kind of person. 
You have to appreciate solitude.It’s scarcely populated and there’s a lot of 
wilderness – Jämtland’s the size of Denmark but there’s only about one person 
per square kilometre living here. I went to cooking school in Åre, Sweden’s one 
proper ski resort.

There is still a feeling that Jämtland is a bit different, a bit other. 
Historically this was an independent country, and the local dialect is almost a 
language of its own.

If it wasn’t for the Gulf Stream, Jämtland would be polar. This climate 
squeezes through the little gap in the mountains between Norway and Sweden, and 
means we can grow most things that you can in the UK, though not as fast. That 
gives more flavour – a raspberry that takes 30 days to ripen will have only 30% 
of the aroma and taste of one that takes 90 days to ripen. The closer to the 
edge of a plant’s possible growth zone you are, the more flavour some fruit has.

You don’t need a delivery for three lemons. In the beginning we worked with 
all kinds of produce from all over the world, but as we sourced more and more 
from this region, the need to order in became smaller. If you can order 
everything, it’s hard to develop.

 Faviken restaurant is ‘nicely situated’ in deep forest. 
Jämtland is nicely situated for a restaurant. The deep forests mean there’s 
lots of game, and it’s also close to the coast and some of the cleanest, 
richest fishing waters in Europe.

When the owners of Fäviken <http://favikenmagasinet.se/> asked me to work for 
them, the restaurant was just serving moose fondue.It was the kind of place 
where a skiing party from the middle management of an insurance company would 
eat.

Moose hunting is something that engages a lot of people in Sweden, even though 
no one needs to do it any more. It’s like a remnant of sustenance hunting – 
each year, in the first week of September, a quarter of a million Swedes go out 
and kill 80,000 moose. That produces a lot of meat. I grew up eating moose. 
It’s very light, not very gamey, a bit like lean beef.

Trondheim, just over the Norwegian border, is definitely worth seeing. It has 
one of northern Europe’s biggest gothic cathedrals and is the start of a 
pilgrim trail.

Kafferosteri <http://www.arekafferosteri.se/constructor.php?pID=30> is a 
little cafe in the middle of absolutely nowhere,yet you can buy espresso made 
by a world-champion barista there. The people who run it roast the coffee for 
Fäviken and are exceptionally good at it. They’re so highly regarded that 
whenever I go somewhere and have an espresso in a good coffee bar, the staff 
say, “send our regards to the guys.”

Jämtland has long-running traditions, especially cheese-making, that you won’t 
find in many places. It’s an elaborate process, involving moving different 
types of cattle and goats between farms. But many of the dairy farms are now 
being turned into summer houses, which is sad. I’d like to see these techniques 
preserved.

Stockholm's top 10 good value restaurants

Kretsloppshuset <http://kretsloppshuset.com/> is a co-operatively owned 
restaurant in the village of Mörsil where I live. It was built to be completely 
sustainable way before these issues were being discussed. It has its own 
massive greenhouses, is all sustainably heated and is really pretty. The food 
is mostly vegetarian, and it’s the only place in the area to go for a good 
lunch.

Hotdogs are the only real Swedish fast food. About three years ago we bought a 
charcuterie and, as a consequence of making very good sausages, we opened a hot 
dog place in Åre. It’s calledKorvkiosk <https://www.facebook.com/korvkiosk.se>, 
which means sausage shack, and is only 3.3 sq m with a little kitchen and a 
window on to the street. We sell hotdogs and ice-cream made with milk from the 
local farm – and that’s it.
