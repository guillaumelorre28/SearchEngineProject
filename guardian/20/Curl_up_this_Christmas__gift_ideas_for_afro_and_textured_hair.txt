 Curly girl hair hack: As I Am Coconut Co-wash. Photograph: As I Am 
Ditching shampoo in favour of conditioner-only cleansing is the secret to 
longer/healthier/better hair. This method gently removes residue while locking 
in essential moisture and refreshing curls.As I Am 
<http://www.mankind.co.uk/as-i-am-coconut-cowash-cleansing-conditioner-454g/11321482.html>
’s light conditioning cream is a favourite among women with natural hair as it 
is chock-full of nourishing ingredients such as coconut and tangerine. The 
gentle formula is free from parabens, silicones and sulphates, thus reviving 
strands without stripping them. And, better yet, it smells good enough to eat.

 Smooth operator: the Ouidad double detangler. Photograph: Ouidad 
The downside to textured hair is that every curl is a potential tangle. Worse 
still, trying to negotiate a knot can lead to breakage and a sore scalp. A 
growing army of women have abandoned combs in favour of fingertips, which is 
effective but can be time-consuming. TheOuidad 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ouidad-Double-Detangler-Comb-Count/dp/B002HM1ONG> 
comb comes from the US but is worth the cost – its wide teeth and round tips 
make detangling a breeze. A must-have.

 Curls go nuts for this wonder oil. Photograph: Handout 
If the Instagram memes are anything to go by, this powerhouse product can 
literally fix your entire life. Got boyfriend problems? Just add a dash of 
coconut oil; trouble at work? A few drops of coconut oil will sort it. Just 
kidding, but still, this all-rounder is rich in antimicrobial properties and 
fatty acids that strengthen follicles while leaving your hair shiny and moist, 
but not greasy. It’s also an effective detangler and conditioner that can be 
rubbed on to hair before shampooing (this is called a “pre-poo”, but let’s 
forget that). The best varieties areextra-virgin, fair trade and 100% organic.

DIY satin-lined beanie hat <https://youtu.be/_SekfXjOP0A> 
Cold weather can be brutal on all hair types, but curls are particularly 
vulnerable to rain and wind. Other than hibernating all winter – which is, of 
course, tempting – a satin-lined hat can help protect hair while preventing 
frizz. The best ones can be foundhere <http://www.chidora.co.uk/>.

 Lush has hit a high note with its no-nonsense R&B moisturiser. Photograph: Lush
Made from a blend of butters and tropical oils, this is a great moisturiser 
for specific hair types.Lush <https://www.lush.com>’s R&B, or revive and 
balance, mixes oat milk, jojoba oil, avocado butter, orange blossom and 
sweet-scented jasmine, an especially reviving blend. It’s also a leave-in 
conditioner and isn’t tested on animals. A word of caution: R&B is rich so a 
little goes a long way. Also, the heavy scent is as divisive as Marmite...

 The Panasonic Nanoe comes with a diffuser attachment and straightening nozzle 
for stress-free tresses. Photograph: Panasonic 
This clever bit of kit comes with a large diffuser that adds volume, minimises 
frizz and reduces breakage as well as a quick-dry nozzle for when you want to 
wear your hair straight. Panasonic claims theNanoe 
<http://www.boots.com/en/Panasonic-Nanoe-Hair-Dryer-EH-NA65_1362787/> infuses 
1,000 times more moisture into strands than typical ion dryers. I’m not sure 
how you measure that, but when I tried it out, my drying time was cut in half 
and the curls were on point.
