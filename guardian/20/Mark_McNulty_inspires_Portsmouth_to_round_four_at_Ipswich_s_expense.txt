Marc McNulty scored one goal and made another as Portsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> stunned 10-man Ipswich with a 
2-1 FA Cup third-round replay win at Fratton Park.

Two goals in five first-half minutes from the former Ipswich player Gary 
Roberts and McNulty booked Pompey a fourth-round home date with their 
neighbours, Bournemouth.

It was a notable scalp for the 2008 winners, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/18/facup.portsmouth> who went 
close to knocking Ipswich out in the initial tie at Portman Road but were 
denied by a late equaliser.

The opening goal here came in the 32nd minute when Roberts tucked away from 
the spot. Piotr Malarczyk tripped McNulty in the box – earning him the first of 
his two yellow cards on the night – and Roberts did the rest.

McNulty then doubled the lead. The striker met Gareth Evans’ brilliant 
inswinging cross eight minutes before half-time and planted a firm header 
beyond Bartosz Bialkowski.

The Championship side’s hopes of a comeback started on the hour as the Arsenal 
loanee Ainsley Maitland-Niles got them back into it. The winger curled in a 
brilliant shot from 25 yards to give his side hope.

But Ipswich’s hopes of progress were dashed when Malarczyk was sent off late 
on for a second yellow card for fouling Roberts.

It is the first time Pompey – who are fifth in League Two – have reached the 
fourth round in six years; that year they went on tolose to Chelsea

 in the final.
