Pep Guardiola, the Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> 
manager, refused to be downcast after a last-minute own goal from Gerard Piqué 
handed Osasuna a 1-1 draw at Reyno de Navarra.

Seydou Keita had given Barça the lead after 72 minutes, but Piqué diverted a 
cross beyond his own goalkeeper Victor Valdés deep into injury time.

"Gerard tried to clear the danger and almost did but it ended up in the net," 
said Guardiola. "It is frustrating especially as it was so late in the game, 
but these things can happen.

"It feels uncomfortable not to win when you have been so close. We knew that 
they would press us, but we controlled their play. We have lost two points, but 
I am happy with our performance," added the manager, whose side had their lead 
at the top ofLa Liga <https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> cut 
to a point after Real Madrid won 2-0 at home to Getafe.

"Last week Osasuna <https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna> conceded in 
the last minute, and this week they equalised. This is football. We must now 
recover and get a good result in Russia."

Barcelona face the Russian champions Rubin Kazan on Wednesday, hoping to 
avenge last month's shock 2-1 defeat.
