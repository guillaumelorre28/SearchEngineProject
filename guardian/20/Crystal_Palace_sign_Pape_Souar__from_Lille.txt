Crystal Palace <https://www.theguardian.com/football/crystalpalace> have 
completed the signing of the Lille full-back Pape Souaré.

The Palace co-chairman Steve Parish announced the deal on his Twitter feed, 
writing: “Delighted that @papeSouaré has just this minute signed for #cpfc . A 
warm welcome from all of us”.

The Senegal international flew straight to London to complete the deal after 
his nation’s early exit from the Africa Cup of Nations this week.

Souaré becomes Alan Pardew’s third signing of the week after the arrivals of 
Jordon Mutch and Shola Amoebi.

Mutch has signed a four-and-a-half-year contract and Ameobi has joined until 
the end of the campaign.
