Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker, is battling the biggest business crisis 
in its 78-year history after admitting in September it installed software in 
diesel vehicles to deceive US regulators about the true level of their toxic 
emissions.

On Friday, it cut €1bn (£701m) from its 2016 investment plan, as its emissions 
cheating scandal expanded to include tens of thousands more US vehicles.

Auto analysts say the company could face a bill as high as €35bn for fines, 
lawsuits and vehicle refits.

According to Bild am Sonntag, Volkswagen spends about €1.5m per season on each 
of the football clubs it could now cut from its sponsorship list. In addition, 
Volkswagen may drop its €5m-a-year sponsorship of the ice hockey club Grizzlys 
Wolfsburg, the paper said.

Volkswagen said football was a major pillar of its sponsoring strategy that it 
would continue to pursue in the future. “It has not yet been decided what the 
volume of that will be,” it said in a statement on Sunday.

Last month, VfL Wolfsburg said it had postponed plans for a new 
multimillion-euro youth training centre after VW’s emissions scandal.
