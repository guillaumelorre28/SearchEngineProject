Alan Stubbs has been sacked as manager of Rotherham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rotherham> United. The former Hibernian 
manager was appointed during the summer but he has found life south of the 
border in the Championship tough, winning only one of his 13 league matches in 
charge.

The Millers have conceded 32 goals in those games and a six-match losing run 
means they are already six points adrift of safety at the bottom of the table.

Stubbs’ last game in charge was Tuesday night’s 4-2 defeat at Birmingham and 
he departs along with his assistant, John Doolan, and first-team coach, Andy 
Holden.

The club, in a statement on their website, 
<http://www.themillers.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/rotherham-united-alan-stubbs-3372664.aspx>
 said: “Following a board meeting this morning it was felt that a change of 
first-team management was needed to give the club the best possible opportunity 
to preserve our Championship status. The club would like to place on record our 
thanks to Alan, John and Andy for their effort and professionalism, and we wish 
them well for the future.

“The board have now started the process of appointing a new first-team 
manager. The club will be making no further comment at this stage.”
