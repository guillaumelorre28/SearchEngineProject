 last season and they will face a mouth-watering visit to the south coast 
high-flyers, whose manager Gus Poyet remains suspended.

the elite level having won the Conference outright, have been drawn away to 
Ronnie Moore's Tranmere.

bye. They will make the long journey to Devon to face Exeter.

M62 to take on Huddersfield while the beaten Championship play-off finalists, 
Watford, head to League Two Bristol Rovers.

while Birmingham welcome John Sheridan's Plymouth.

Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest host Hartlepool, Leicester make the trip to
