The British racing driver Susie Wolff has announced that she will retire from 
motor sport at the end of the season.

Wolff became the first female to take part in a Formula One race weekend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/04/british-grand-prix-susie-wolff-silverstone>
 in more than two decades in first practice at last year’s British Grand Prix.

The Scot, who joined Williams in 2012 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/11/susie-wolff-joins-williams-driver>
, said: “I’d like to thank Williams for the opportunity they have given me over 
the last few years which has allowed me to achieve my dream of driving a 
Formula One car.

“It has been great to work with everyone at the team, both at Grove and 
trackside, and I’d like to thank everyone who has been part of my journey at
Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/williams>.

“I am now closing this chapter but looking forward to new challenges in the 
future.”

Wolff also took part in practice for the German Grand Prix last year as well 
as sessions in Spain this season and again at Silverstone.

February 2015: Williams test driver Susie Wolff: ‘My goal is to race in F1.’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2015/feb/05/williams-test-driver-susie-wolff-formula-one-video>
Wolff, who is married to the Mercedes GP executive director Toto Wolff, does 
not believe the sport is ready for a female racing driver in the near future.

Writing in a blog on the Huffington Post 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/susie-wolff/susie-wolff-retired_b_8461408.html>
, Wolff, 32, added: “My progression into Formula One came to represent so much 
more than a racing driver simply trying to reach the pinnacle of the sport. It 
was also the hope that finally there may again be a female on the starting grid.

“I rode the wave, was energised by all the support and fought hard. There were 
those who wanted it to happen. Those who didn’t.

“I can only tell you, I gave it my all. Do I think F1 is ready for a 
competitive female racing driver that can perform at the highest level? Yes. Do 
I think it is achievable as a woman? Most definitely. Do I think it will happen 
soon? Sadly no.

“We have two issues: not enough young girls starting in karting at a young age 
and no clear role model. Sometimes you just have to see it to believe it. My 
gut feeling tells me it is time to move on.”

Wolff was appointed Williams’ development driver in 2012 before being promoted 
to the role of test driver this season.

But her hopes of becoming the first woman to start an F1 race since the 
Italian Lella Lombardi in 1976 suffered a setback when Adrian Sutil was signed 
up by Williams after Valtteri Bottas sustained an injury in qualifying for the 
Malaysian Grand Prix.

Bottas was fit enough to take part in the race but the move by Williams 
appeared to scupper any long-term hope Wolff had of competing for the team in a 
race.

The Williams deputy team principal Claire Williams added: “It has been a 
pleasure to work with Susie over the years and see her develop as a driver 
within the team.

“Her feedback and knowledge of the car has been an important part of our 
recent development and we will be sorry to see her go.

“We want to thank her for all her efforts and wish her the very best for her 
future endeavours.”
