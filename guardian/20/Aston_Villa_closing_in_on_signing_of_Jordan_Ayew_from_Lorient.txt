 to Liverpool.

The Ghana striker, 23, flew into the UK on Friday to discuss personal terms 
after Villa submitted a bid of around £9m for a player who scored 12 goals in 
Ligue 1 last season.

Swansea, whom Ayew’s brother Andre joined earlier in the summer

 from Marseille, are also understood to have shown an interest but the second 
oldest son of the Ghana legend Abedi Pele appears set on a move to the Midlands.


“I’m delighted to have arrived in the UK and to have the opportunity to join a 
club the size ofAston Villa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa>
,” Ayew told Sky Sports News. “I’m looking forward to meeting the manager and I 
am very excited about the prospect of playing in the best league in the world.

“I’m sure with the new players that Aston Villa are bringing in that we can 
all work together to make it a great season for a great football club.”


Ayew’s agent, Mark McKay, confirmed earlier that Villa had submitted a bid for 
Ayew. “Villa have made an offer for Jordan Ayew to Alex Hayes, the 
vice-president of Lorient,” he said. “We are hoping Jordan will be allowed to 
travel fromLorient <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lorient> to Birmingham 
tonight to discuss personal terms. Tim Sherwood is an admirer of Jordan and 
feels he could be a big success in the Premier League.”

Villa have already seen their club captain, Fabian Delph, join Manchester City 
this summer while the Holland defender Ron Vlaar declined the club’s offer of a 
new contract. Benteke’s departure means Gabby Agbonlahor, Libor Kozak and 
Callum Robinson are the only strikers at the club with first-team experience.
