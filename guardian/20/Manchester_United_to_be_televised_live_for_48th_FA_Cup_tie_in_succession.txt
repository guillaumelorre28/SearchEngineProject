Manchester United’s third round tie against Sheffield United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldunited> will be shown by BT 
Sport, making it the 48th successive FA Cup match featuring the 11-times 
winners to be televised live.

The Football Association announced 
<http://www.thefa.com/news/the-fa-cup/2015/dec/emirates-fa-cup-third-round-tv-ties-selected>
 on Friday that five matches have been selected by BT Sport and the BBC, with 
Liverpool’s trip to League Two side Exeter up first on the BBC on the evening 
of Friday 8 January.

Wycombe Wanderers’ home tie against struggling Aston Villa will be the first 
game shown live at 12.45pm on Saturday 9 January on BT Sport 2, followed by 
United’s match against the League One side Sheffield United, which kicks off at 
5.30pm. That continues the unbroken run of successive FA Cup ties featuring the 
Old Trafford club,which stretches back

 to their third round replayagainst Exeter in January 2005 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jan/20/match.manchesterunited>.

Chelsea’s tie against Leyton Orient or Scunthorpe United will also be shown by 
BT Sport <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bt-sport> 2 while the trip by the 
Premier League leaders, Leicester City, to face Tottenham Hotspur is the final 
tie to be televised.

The decision to feature four of the Premier League’s most popular sides was 
heavily criticised by the chairman of Eastleigh, who are the only non-league 
club to have guaranteed their participation in the third round.

“Superb news this morning!!! We get a rare chance to check out Man Utd and 
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> in the FA CUP
