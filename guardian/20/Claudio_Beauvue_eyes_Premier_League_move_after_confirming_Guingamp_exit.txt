interested.

Speaking to radio station RMC, Beauvue, who has hit 18 goals this season 
including five in the Europa League, suggested a move to England may be on the 
cards.

“The deal I had with the club president was that I would leave in the event of 
a beautiful season,” he said. “The season has been very beautiful, so it is 
sure that I will be playing my football elsewhere next season.

“I don’t know whether it will be in France or abroad, I do not have a 
priority. It is true though that I am very attracted to the Premier League. 
We’ll see what happens when I get back from holiday in the summer.”
