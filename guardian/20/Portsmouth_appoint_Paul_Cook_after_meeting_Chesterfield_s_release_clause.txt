 by Preston North End.

Cook becomes Portsmouth’s fourth permanent manager in two years, and will be 
looking to repeat his successes atChesterfield

League Two last season and into the top six of League One this term.

The south coast club met a release clause in Cook’s contract allowing him to 
leave the Proact Stadium.

Cook said: “I’d like to place on record my thanks to [the Chesterfield chief 
executive] Chris Turner, chairman Dave Allen and the rest of the board for 
giving me the opportunity to manage such a great club.

“I’d like to thank the staff in all departments of the club for everything 
they have done during my time at the club. Most importantly, I’d also like to 
thank the players, who have been fantastic, both on and off the pitch. Finally, 
thanks to the fans for their superb support.”

Cook replaces Andy Awford, who parted company with Pompey last month, with 
Gary Waddock placed in temporary charge.

Portsmouth, who were relegated to League Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> in 2013 and finished 
16th this season, are in talks with Cook’s assistant, Leam Richardson, about 
joining him on the south coast.
