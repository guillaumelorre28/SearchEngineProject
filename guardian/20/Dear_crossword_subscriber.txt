We hope you are enjoying the Guardian Unlimited crossword service. 

 Thanks to all of you who have entered the monthly Genius crossword. It's 
proving to be very popular with cruciverbalists and a challenge for our 
compilers. We'd also like to thank you for emailing your comments and 
suggestions about the service. We hope to introduce new features and functions 
in 2004.

 As we near the end of 2003, we are giving away a copy of the Guardian Year 
Book 2003 to 50 Guardian Unlimited crossword subscribers. The Guardian Year 
Book 2003 includes the sharpest and most irreverent journalism and photography 
from the Guardian over the last year.

 To enter the draw, simply click on the link below, fill in your address, and 
click on Submit. Terms and conditions apply.

with you on January 5 2004.

Best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year,

 The Guardian Unlimited crossword team
