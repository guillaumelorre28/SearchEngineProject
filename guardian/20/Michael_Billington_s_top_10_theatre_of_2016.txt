1. The Flick
National Theatre, London

Peter Brook once argued that the acid test of any play was the image it leaves 
behind. No question about the abiding memory of Annie Baker’s astonishing play: 
a run-down movie auditorium, rows of empty seats, a projection booth. But this 
was simply the setting for a play about the quiet desperation of three lonely 
people intoxicated by film. Sam (Matthew Maher) was a burly cleaner aching with 
unexpressed love for Rose (Louisa Krause), the wraith-like projectionist. She, 
in turn, was besotted with Avery (Jaygann Ayeh), a 20-year-old African American 
on a break from college.

For some, since it ran three-and-a-quarter hours, the triangle seemed eternal, 
but I loved everything about the play. The long silences. The way passion,as in 
the work of Racine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/04/jean-racine-theatre-london-french>
, was constantly beating against the restraints of a decorous framework: at one 
point, Sam registered his sexual jealousy by quietly emptying a bag of popcorn 
for Avery to clean up. Above all, this was a play about work, about the fact 
that running an old-style movie house is as much concerned with sweeping away 
the debris as resisting the trend towards digitisation.

As one of the few theatre critics to have worked as a cinema usher, I could 
even vouch for the accuracy of a time-honoured scam concerning the resale of 
old ticket stubs. Sam Gold’s unhurried production, imported from New York, was 
a miracle and the acting was marvellous. But the main credit belongs to Baker, 
for making moving drama out of a trio of lost souls and for creating the year’s 
most unforgettable theatrical image.Read the full review

In a breakthrough year for female dramatists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/11/is-2016-the-year-of-the-female-playwright>
 – and a modest one for men – Ella Hickson’s play stands out. It spanned 150 
years and covered a vast range of subjects: the exploitation and exhaustion of 
the world’s oil resources, the links between the energy industry and 
imperialism, the social progress made by women and the unresolved problems of 
parenting. It was a lot to cram in, but I was awed by the boldness of the 
conception. Anne-Marie Duff as the time-transcending May also caught 
brilliantly the pain that accompanied a pathfinding woman’s gain.Read the full

 butI was genuinely shaken 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/apr/11/cyprus-avenue-david-ireland-belfast-play-royal-court-theatre-upstairs>
 by the climax of David Ireland’s play involving bin-bagged infanticide. What 
made it so disturbing was that it seemed the logical outcome to a play about 
the insanity of sectarian hatred: the protagonist was a Belfast man so devoted 
to the Protestant cause that he was convinced his five-year-old granddaughter 
was the incarnation of Gerry Adams. But Ireland’s achievement was to have laced 
the lunacy with laughter. It was just a pity that Vicky Featherstone’s 
production and Stephen Rea’s amazing performance were seen by so few.Read the

 Perfectly pitched … Cherry Jones (centre) in The Glass Menagerie. Photograph: 
Michael J Lutch 
Cherry Jones is a big name on Broadway but scarcely known in Britain. She was 
brilliant in John Tiffany’s production of the Tennessee Williams classic – the 
revival of the year, stripping an over-familiar play of gauzy wispiness. This 
was a tough, clear production, perfectly pitched between realism and symbolism 
and with a great performance at its centre. As Amanda, angling for a suitor for 
her gauche daughter, Jones gave us a woman who was neither monstrous nor comic 
but filled with gusto, vitality and an unquenchable recollection of past joys. 
The good news is that the production comes to London in February.Read the full

 Incipient madness … Glenda Jackson in King Lear. Photograph: Tristram Kenton

In a year of Lears, Glenda Jackson took on the title role after a 25-year 
absence from the stage. She was tremendous:forbidding, ironic, vainglorious, 
vulnerable 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2016/nov/03/glenda-jackson-returns-to-the-stage-as-king-lear-old-vic-in-pictures>
 and capable of switching in a second from incipient madness to dazzling 
perspicacity. At 80, most actors have the insight but not the energy to play 
Lear; Jackson had both. Gregory Doran’sconcurrent RSC production 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/02/king-lear-review-royal-antony-sher>
 with Antony Sher was richer in texture and had a better supporting cast than 
Deborah Warner’s, but what counted was Jackson’s ability to scale the summit

<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/may/29/chimerica-review>, it

the childless Rose were confronted by severe moral choices in a plausible,

Most adaptations of Miguel de Cervantes’s novel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/13/classics.miguelcervantes> fall 
at the first hurdle: it just seems too vast for the stage. James Fenton’s 
version and Angus Jackson’s production overcame that by presenting us with a 
joyous piece of popular theatre: one that embraced puppetry, comic props and 
Hispanic music. But it was the performances that made it work. David Threlfall 
as the Don, with his shaggy beard and wild eyes, even evoked Lear when 
threatening to strip off his clothes, and his footsteps were memorably dogged 
by Rufus Hound as Sancho.Read the full review

wouldn’t say Peake was natural casting since she normally exudes defiant common 
sense but, in Sarah Frankcom’s production, she captured perfectly Blanche’s 
endless capacity for self-delusion: “One’s my limit,” she cried, grasping the

 Veteran pair … Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart in No Man’s Land. Photograph:

Old-timers wax lyrical about Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud in the 1975 
premiere of Pinter’s play. But although they were memorable, the play is big 
enough to take constant reinterpretation. This time round Ian McKellen was 
excellent as the scrounging Spooner, furtively taking notes about his host’s 
sumptuous pad. Patrick Stewart as Hirst beautifully caught the weariness of a 
writer who feels he is nearing journey’s end only to find his departure 
temporarily stayed.Read the full review
