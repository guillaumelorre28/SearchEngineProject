Celtic maintained their cruise towards a 48th top-flight title with a 2-0 
defeat ofRoss County while Rangers, who will host the Old Firm derby on New 
Year’s Eve, struggled to break downSt Johnstone in a 1-1 draw.

Inverness stayed bottom of the table after a 2-1 defeat by Motherwell while 
Partick Thistle beat Dundee 2-0.

Erik Sviatchenko opened the scoring at Celtic Park seven minutes before 
half-time with a long-range effort, the centre-half’s first goal of the season, 
that Scott Fox in theRoss County 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rosscounty> goal should have dealt with.

Stuart Armstrong doubled the lead just before the interval with his eighth 
goal of the season after a twisting burst into the penalty area.

The champions took their foot off the pedal in the second half with the Rangers
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> game in three days’ time. 
Martin Woods almost grabbed one back for the visitors close to full-time but 
Craig Gordon saved well and then denied Andrew Davies.

Moussa Dembélé came on after the hour for Leigh Griffiths and the big question 
before the 31 December derby is which of the two Brendan Rodgers will pick up 
front for the big game.

“We aim to go there and win. We want to win every game and that’s the attitude 
for the weekend,” said Rodgers.

“It’ll be a battle, a tough game. There’s huge pressure on them to get the 
result at home.”

Celtic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic> have 55 points from 19 
games with Rangers second, on 39.

In an entertaining first half at McDiarmid Park, when neither defence 
convinced, Rangers took the lead after a concerted period of pressure. Joe 
Garner’s shot was blocked and Barrie McKay followed up to score.

But they held the lead for only five minutes before a poor back pass by Rob 
Kiernan was intercepted by the home side’s Steve Maclean, who made the most of 
his gilt-edged chance.

Rangers, who lost 5-1 to Celtic in the Premiership in September, changed 
formation in the second half but to no avail. The defender Clint Hill seemed to 
be hobbling when he was substituted, which will be a worry for Mark Warburton 
before Saturday.

Warburton said he was disappointed with dropping two points. “We should have 
gone in [at half-time] one or two up. I didn’t think we were threatened in the 
second half but we’ve got to test the keeper more.”

Partick <https://www.theguardian.com/football/partick> Thistle eased into a 
two-goal lead against Dundee before half-time thanks to goals from Callum 
Booth, directly from a free-kick, and Kris Doolan, who struck shortly before 
the break. Chris Erskine’s shot was saved by Scott Bain and the striker was on 
hand to score from an acute angle.

Dundee <https://www.theguardian.com/football/dundee> had been 2-0 down in 
their previous game against Hearts and came back to win 3-2 at home but there 
seemed few signs of a similar escape.

Inverness should have gone into half-time ahead after a period of dominance 
but Craig Clay gaveMotherwell <https://www.theguardian.com/football/motherwell> 
the lead with a swirling strike from 25 yards – his first goal for the club – 
that left Fon Williams, the home goalkeeper, stranded.

Both teams struggled to put searching moves together in the strong wind in the 
second period.

Scott McDonald added a second three minutes from time when he was set up by 
his strike partner Louis Moult after a breakaway.

But Inverness, who have not won at home since September, struck back after a 
wind-affected corner when Tansey bundled the ball home.
