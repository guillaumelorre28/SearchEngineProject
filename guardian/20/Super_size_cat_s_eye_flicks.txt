The cat’s eye flick has become almost a neutral. No longer seen as ultra-glam 
or retro, it can be dieted down to a subtle line or, as on the Dior couture 
catwalks, blown up into a big, bold wing. Black nods to punk, gold nods to 
disco. Use the end of the eyebrow as an anchor, and head towards there from the 
top of your lashes with a felt-tipped eyeliner. Draw another line from under 
the lash line to the point of your wing, then colour in the gap.
