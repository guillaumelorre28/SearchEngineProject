The Hypocrite

Local boy Richard Bean <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/richardbean> 
celebrates Hull’s role asUK city of culture 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/uk-city-of-culture> 2017 with a new comedy 
about a bigwig torn between his loyalty to Charles I and his duty to parliament 
as civil war looms. Given the hero’s endless domestic problems, including a 
fugitive wife and a lovesick daughter, this could be a 17th-century One Man, 
Two Guvnors.Philip Breen <http://www.phillipbreen.co.uk/>, a hotshot comic 
director, is at the helm.

Antony and Cleopatra

Josette Simon, who has played Titania and Rosaline for the RSC and Maggie in 
Arthur Miller’s After the Fall at the National, is back in Stratford as the 
Egyptian queen. She follows in a long and distinguished line that includes 
Peggy Ashcroft, Janet Suzman, Helen Mirren and Harriet Walter, but will 
doubtless make the role her own. Iqbal Khan, who directeda controversial Othello
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/12/othello-rsc-stratford-hugh-quarshie-lucian-msamati-joanna-vanderham>
 in 2015 with a black Iago, is in charge of Shakespeare’s sumptuous tragedy.

The Goat

Damian Lewis <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/damian-lewis>, last seen on 
stage in Mamet’sAmerican Buffalo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/apr/27/american-buffalo-review-damian-lewis-mamet-wyndhams-theatre>
, now stars in another American classic:Edward Albee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/18/edward-albee-obituary>’s 
disturbing 2002 play about an acclaimed architect who conceives a hopeless 
passion for a goat. But this is less a play about bestiality than a modern 
version of Greek tragedy: an Oedipus Rex for the affluent society. Fans of 
Lewis inHomeland <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/homeland> and 
Billions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/13/billions-review-naughty-guilty-damian-lewis>
 may be in for a shock, but the production is in the sure hands of Ian Rickson 
as director.

 Haunting … Jude Law and Halina Reijn in Obsession. Photograph: Jan Versweyveld 
Obsession

This looks like a winning combination: Britain’s Jude Law 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jude-law> stars in a production directed 
by Belgium’sIvo van Hove <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ivo-van-hove> who 
seems to be everywhere right now. The source is a 1942 film by Luchino Visconti,
Ossessione <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035160/>, which was itself based on 
James M Cain <https://www.theguardian.com/books/james-m-cain>’s The Postman 
Always Rings Twice: a haunting tale of lust, greed and murder. It will be 
fascinating to see how Van Hove matches Visconti’s emphasis on realistic 
locations and human grossness.

Angels in America

Tony Kushner <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/tony-kushner>’s dazzling 
phantasmagoria, embracing sex, politics and religion, is back with a cast to 
dream of: America’s Nathan Lane and our ownDenise Gough

 directs and it will be intriguing to see how Kushner’s two-part play, which in 
the 90s summed up the uncertainty as we approached a new millennium, stands up 
today.

The Ferryman

Sam Mendes <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sam-mendes> teams up with Jez 
Butterworth <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/jez-butterworth>, best known for 
Jerusalem <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/feb/10/jerusalem-review> but 
a contributor to the recent Bond movies, for one of the year’s most tempting 
new plays. Butterworth has always favoured rural settings and here we are in a 
Derry farmhouse in1981, when the Carney family’s celebration of the annual 
harvest is interrupted by an unexpected visitor. Wecan expect something eerie, 
strange and menacing.

The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other

Peter Handke <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/handke>’s extraordinary 
wordless 1992 play puts the teeming life of a town square on stage, and 
features 450 characters. It was first seen in the UK at the 1994 Edinburgh 
festival and was mesmerisingly stagedat the National in 2008 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/feb/14/theatre1>. Now it returns to 
Scotland as part ofDavid Greig <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/davidgreig>’s

Desire Under the Elms

Banned in Britain until 1940, Eugene O’Neill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/eugene-o-neill>’s play transports the 
passion of Greek tragedy, as well as basic Freudian instincts, to an American 
farm. It all revolves around 75-year-old Ephraim Cabot’s marriage to a young 
bride and his desire for a son.Sam Yates <http://www.samyatesdirector.com/>, 
who directs, calls it “a steamy, claustrophobic drama”, and it is one that fits 
well into Rob Hastie’s enterprising first season in South Yorkshire.
