Southend United, unbeaten in their past seven games, welcome Hull City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity>, who have not won away in eight 
matches, to Roots Hall. The Premier League side are the natural favourites, 
having won their past three meetings with Southend, the most recent of which 
was in the League Cup in 2009. This will be Phil Brown's first encounter with 
his former employers and the Southend manager will be eager to remind Hull of 
his ability to motivate a side. Steve Bruce will be aware of this and will hope 
to avoid an upset.Mikkel Mousten
