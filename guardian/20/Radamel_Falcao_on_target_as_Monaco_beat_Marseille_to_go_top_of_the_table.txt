The substitute Emmanuel Rivière scored a 79th-minute winner as big-spending 
Monaco moved to the top of the fledgling Ligue 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football> table and handed Marseille
their first defeat of the season with a 2-1 win at the Stade Vélodrome.

Marseille <https://www.theguardian.com/football/marseille> had begun their 
season with three straight wins in the league and looked on course for a fourth 
when the Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes gave them a 43rd-minute lead. But 
Monaco drew level through one of their big-money summer signings, Radamel 
Falcao, two minutes after the interval, and Rivière settled it six minutes 
after being introduced off the bench.

St Etienne continued their good start to the domestic campaign by edging out 
Bordeaux 2-1. Les Verts took a seventh-minute lead through Romain Hamouma, Loïc 
Perrin doubled it five minutes into the second half, with Ludovic Obraniak's 
stoppage-time goal scant consolation for Les Girondins.

Nice led twice against Montpellier through Timothée Kolodziejczak and Valentin 
Eysseric but their efforts were cancelled out by Souleymane Camara and Siaka 
Tiéné before Montpellier's Djamel Bakar was sent off late on.

On Saturday Paris Saint-Germain needed two stoppage-time goals to claim a 2-0 
win overGuingamp at the Parc des Princes. The 18-year-old Adrien Rabiot came 
off the bench to score his first goal for the club and Zlatan Ibrahimovic 
scored his first of the season.
