Barcelona's title celebrations fell flat tonight as they surrendered a 
one-goal advantage to slip to a 2-1 defeat at RealMallorca 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmallorca>. With Real Madrid's defeat 
against Villarreal last night handing the Catalan side the Primera Division 
crown, expectations were of a showcase of Barça's attacking skills.

Samuel Eto'o scored after 10 minutes to set the expected tone but from there 
on it was a disappointing day for both player and club, as the striker missed a 
host of chances - including a last-minute penalty.

At the other end a fine strike from the impressive Juan Arango and a deft 
Loureiro Santana header sealed the points for the hosts.

Atlético Madrid <https://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid> moved 
into fourth place after coming out on top against Valencia as the battle for 
the final Champions League place continues to go all the way. Diego Forlan 
scored the only goal from the penalty spot after 30 minutes after Sergio Aguero 
had been brought down by visiting keeper Cesar Sanchez. Atletico are now two 
points clear of Los Che.

At the other end of the table, Sporting Gijon moved out of the relegation zone 
after an impressive 2-1 victory against high-flying Malaga. They achieved it 
thanks to an own goal eight minutes into the second half from Helder Rosario.

But that slice of luck was the least they deserved for a committed performance 
which sees them move aboveOsasuna <https://www.theguardian.com/football/osasuna>
 on a better head-to-head record and out of immediate danger.

Gerard handed Sporting a 24th-minute lead with Robson Weligton levelling 
matters 14 minutes later for a Malaga side whose Champions League hopes are now 
all but over.
