Final thoughts:

It looked like a game of two halves was more likely to tilt the USA’s way at 
the end but credit to Juan Carlos Osorio for constantly keeping his counterpart 
off-balance with his adjustments. His rotations and general wonkiness can make 
Osorio ripe for satire, but his adjustment to negate the US 3-5-2 dictated the 
key period of the first half, and the introduction of Lozano then switch of 
flanks relieved any build-up of pressure as the US searched for a winner, while 
having to be mindful of Mexico’s threat.

Not mindful enough. Rafa Marqez made his international debut before Christian 
Pulisic was born, and on the day age and guile beat youthful exuberance, as 
Marquez won the game.


So the Hex starts with wins for Costa Rica, Mexico and Panama, all on the 
road. Now the USA in particular will face a stern test asthey go on the road to 
face Costa Rica, who usually beat them at home in qualifying, this Tuesday. No 
time to wallow for Klinsmann — his team could be in real qualifying trouble by 
the time they head into the winter break, unless he can do whatMexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> just did, and change the record.

Thanks for joining me tonight, at the end of an extraordinary week. I’m off to 
hold my loved ones close.

Final score: USA 1-2 Mexico

Boos from the crowd as Mexico’s technical team clear the bench to celebrate

Red card for Carlos Salcedo

Silly second yellow for time-wasting by Salcedo. He’s sent off, duly dawdles 
to start a melee with frustrated US players, and we’ll see how much time the 
referee adds on.

90 mins+3: Klinsmann looking disgusted and weary on the sidelines at this 
dramatic turn in fortunes for his team. Now they have to go to Costa Rica for 
their next game, where their record indicates they’ll lose. The small silver 
lining for Klinsmann might be that records haven’t meant anything tonight...

86 mins: The USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> 
continue to drive forward, but need to be wary of Mexico’s willingness to 
gamble on the counter in these last few minutes. US settling for possession at 
the moment as they try and pace themselves for the final assault on goal.

84 mins: Another corner for the US and Bradley trots across to set up the 
inswinger. It’s a dangerous looking one this time, and it has Talavera flapping 
at it. Wood can’t reach it at the back post anyway, as the referee blows for a 
foul.

82 mins: Michael Orozco comes on for Matt Besler, perhaps to try and shut down 
the threat of Lozano, who’s been darting at that side of the field. 
Immediately, the tinkerman Osorio switches Lozano to the left, and puts Corona 
on the right.

This is called the I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I gambit.

80 mins: The corner doesn’t clear the first man but the USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> have stepped up their 
intensity in winning the ball back, and now the crowd roars in approval as 
Pulisic battles and battles for the ball and comes away with it at Chicharito’s 
expense. He’s utterly unperturbed by this stage.

Suddenly the game gets wild as Lozano goes up to the other end on a dangerous 
run that ends with johnson making a last ditch clearance off the toe of 
Chicharito as he’s about to finish at the near post.

78 mins: End to end now as Pulisic makes an interception in midfield and 
sprints towards the box, only to be blocked in bizarre fashion by Salcedo on 
the edge of the box in a very dangerous position. Salcedo is booked, but more 
importantly forMexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> they have 
to defend a free kick just outside the D...

...And it’s up and down and headed under the bar when Talavera tips it over

76 mins: Wood looks sharp again as Altidore’s hold up play sets him up to turn 
and spin in the box and power a left foot shot to force a good save from 
Talavera.

Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> break and the substitute 
Lozano causes a brief panic in the US box as the ball flashes across the box, 
but nobody’s following up.

74 mins: Before that can happen Lozano comes on for Vela, in the final Mexican 
change. That’s an attacking move. Osorio not content with the draw. But his

20 minutes. Looks like DeAndre Yedlin’s speed is about to enter the game, maybe

70 mins: Terrible free kick from Layun as he tries to disguise the cut back 
for Chicharito near the penalty spot. His pass misses his team mate comletely 
and the US break. To complete a miserable sequence for Layun he is booked as he 
drags down Wood to stop the break.

62 mins: Best period of possession of the match for the US ends with Chandler 
getting into an advanced position on the right and cutting the ball back to the 
edge of the box, where the arriving Johnson sweeps his first-time shot just 
over the bar.

In the build up to that Chicharito was very lucky not to have what looked like 
a deliberate elbow on Brooks punished.

60 mins: Mexico rocking now, and suddenly there’s another US turnover and 
Bradley and Wood combine. Bradley could maybe have slipped another pass to 
Wood, but shoots and it’s a poor shot that’s saved easily, and a stungMexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> spring forward.

And now there’s a scramble in the US box, which ends in Herrera hitting the 
deck dramatically. Immediately the referee blows the whistle...and books 
Herrera for simulation. The right call — but it’s definitely Mexico’s turn to 
feel like nothing’s going their way.

58 mins: Another half-chance for Wood as he gets between the center backs 
again, but a heavy touch allows Salcedo to get to the ball and concede a 
corner, with Wood barreling into the box.

The corner allows a free header for Omar Gonzalez who doesn’t realize how much 
time he has and it’s weak.

56 mins: Besler fouls dos Santos wide right to concede a free kick, but Layun 
can’t clear Besler (again) as he tries to float a cross in.

USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> getting some joy 
turning Mexican players in midfield. Pulisic is the latest beneficiary as he 
sets up a US attack that ends in a corner. They waste it by getting a little 
too cute with their approach before Jones steps up to hit a long range shot 
which...well, it wasn’t what you’d call a good long range shot.

GOAL! USA 1 MEXICO 1 (WOOD!)

Altidore turns brilliantly in picking up a ball out of defense and pushes the 
ball forward to the onrushing Wood. He has plenty to do as he forces his way 
into the box and looks to have overrun the ball momentarily, only to regain 
control and poke the ball into the net! Great time for the USA to score. How 
willMexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> respond?

Second half begins

Almost immediately there’s a comedy of errors in the Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> box, as the ball ricochets 
wildly. Eventually Jones’ shot from the edge of the box is blocked. Wild start 
to the half, and more urgency from the US than we saw in the previous 45 
minutes.

Ayala on for Reyes at half-time by the way. Mexico have one sub left.

An email:

From Raymond Reardon:

“With Britain’s isolationist policies post brexit and the USA’s president to 
be’s isolationist talk pre-election shouldn’t the US and the UK form an 
Atlantic axis called USUK.”

Not entirely sure that’s helping, Raymond.

Half-time thoughts:

A great first half for Mexico, who quietened the home crowd from the start, by 
swarming past a USA team clearly uncomfortable in their new 3-5-2 formation. 
They adjusted their own formation to deal with the unfamiliar US line up with 
just a few seconds on the clock, and by the time the US adjusted to 4-4-2 in 
response,Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> had taken the 
lead and hit the woodwork twice.

And to add injury to insult, the US lost Tim Howard to injury late in the half.

Mexico saw out the half comfortably repelling the USA’s willing but mostly 
unimaginative attacks, and choosing their moments to counter and stretch theUSA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> back line.

As it stands Klinsmann need to find another gear from somewhere, or at least 
hope that he can change the mood of the game and the crowd with an early goal 
in the second half, perhaps from a set piece. But he needs something. At the 
moment he has Cero.

Half-time USA 0-1 Mexico

The Mexican players are all pleading their case to the referee after the 
whistle, as Jermaine Jones had committed a late-looking tackle that was never 
revisited after advantage was played. The referee waves them off, and the 
players trudge off to the locker room. A lot to think about for the home team 
in particular.

45 mins+1: Lovely run from Vela to get behind Besler and send a low ball 
across the box, but it’s cut out before any Mexican forward can inflict more 
damage. We’re in the first of three added minutes by the way.

Final thoughts:

It looked like a game of two halves was more likely to tilt the USA’s way at 
the end but credit to Juan Carlos Osorio for constantly keeping his counterpart 
off-balance with his adjustments. His rotations and general wonkiness can make 
Osorio ripe for satire, but his adjustment to negate the US 3-5-2 dictated the 
key period of the first half, and the introduction of Lozano then switch of 
flanks relieved any build-up of pressure as the US searched for a winner, while 
having to be mindful of Mexico’s threat.

Not mindful enough. Rafa Marqez made his international debut before Christian 
Pulisic was born, and on the day age and guile beat youthful exuberance, as 
Marquez won the game.


So the Hex starts with wins for Costa Rica, Mexico and Panama, all on the 
road. Now the USA in particular will face a stern test asthey go on the road to 
face Costa Rica, who usually beat them at home in qualifying, this Tuesday. No 
time to wallow for Klinsmann — his team could be in real qualifying trouble by 
the time they head into the winter break, unless he can do whatMexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> just did, and change the record.

Thanks for joining me tonight, at the end of an extraordinary week. I’m off to 
hold my loved ones close.
 
Boos from the crowd as Mexico’s technical team clear the bench to celebrate 
the end of an era. Dos a Cero no mas.

Final thoughts in a moment.
 
Silly second yellow for time-wasting by Salcedo. He’s sent off, duly dawdles 
to start a melee with frustrated US players, and we’ll see how much time the 
referee adds on.
 
90 mins+3: Klinsmann looking disgusted and weary on the sidelines at this 
dramatic turn in fortunes for his team. Now they have to go to Costa Rica for 
their next game, where their record indicates they’ll lose. The small silver 
lining for Klinsmann might be that records haven’t meant anything tonight...
 
90 mins +1: We’re going to have three minutes of extra-time for the US to 
salvage something after that sucker punch.
 
It had to be Marquez...! Layun swings the corner to the near post where 
Marquez has ghosted across to flick a free header up and over Guzan and inside 
the unguarded back post!USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> facing the first home 
qualifying loss in 15 years.
 
88 mins: Lozano lively again, this time on his switched left wing position, 
but his scampering run is ended by Jozy Altidore knocking him to the ground. 
Layun sends in an inswinger which Johnson heads behind for Mexico’s first 
corner...
 
86 mins: The USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> 
continue to drive forward, but need to be wary of Mexico’s willingness to 
gamble on the counter in these last few minutes. US settling for possession at 
the moment as they try and pace themselves for the final assault on goal.
 
84 mins: Another corner for the US and Bradley trots across to set up the 
inswinger. It’s a dangerous looking one this time, and it has Talavera flapping 
at it. Wood can’t reach it at the back post anyway, as the referee blows for a 
foul.
 
82 mins: Michael Orozco comes on for Matt Besler, perhaps to try and shut down 
the threat of Lozano, who’s been darting at that side of the field. 
Immediately, the tinkerman Osorio switches Lozano to the left, and puts Corona 
on the right.

This is called the I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I gambit.
 
80 mins: The corner doesn’t clear the first man but the USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> have stepped up their 
intensity in winning the ball back, and now the crowd roars in approval as 
Pulisic battles and battles for the ball and comes away with it at Chicharito’s 
expense. He’s utterly unperturbed by this stage.

Suddenly the game gets wild as Lozano goes up to the other end on a dangerous 
run that ends with johnson making a last ditch clearance off the toe of 
Chicharito as he’s about to finish at the near post.
 
78 mins: End to end now as Pulisic makes an interception in midfield and 
sprints towards the box, only to be blocked in bizarre fashion by Salcedo on 
the edge of the box in a very dangerous position. Salcedo is booked, but more 
importantly forMexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> they have 
to defend a free kick just outside the D...

...And it’s up and down and headed under the bar when Talavera tips it over 
for a corner. Just not close enough to the corner.
 
76 mins: Wood looks sharp again as Altidore’s hold up play sets him up to turn 
and spin in the box and power a left foot shot to force a good save from 
Talavera.

Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> break and the substitute 
Lozano causes a brief panic in the US box as the ball flashes across the box, 
but nobody’s following up.
 
74 mins: Before that can happen Lozano comes on for Vela, in the final Mexican 
change. That’s an attacking move. Osorio not content with the draw. But his 
team need to stabilize.

And now Yedlin does replace Chandler.
 
72 mins: Coaches pondering their final moves as the game heads into the final 
20 minutes. Looks like DeAndre Yedlin’s speed is about to enter the game, maybe 
for Chandler.
 
70 mins: Terrible free kick from Layun as he tries to disguise the cut back 
for Chicharito near the penalty spot. His pass misses his team mate comletely 
and the US break. To complete a miserable sequence for Layun he is booked as he 
drags down Wood to stop the break.
 
68 mins: For once Mexico get a kindly break for the ball to run free for Layun 
wide left, and while his sweeping cross can’t pick out Chicharito,Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> retain possession in the US 
third, and finally earn a free kick on the right of the box as Besler brings 
down dos Santos. He’s booked and the US must defend an awkward set piece...
 
66 mins: On the sidelines Osorio is considering what final substitution he can 
make to adjust the trajectory this game is taking — at the momentMexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> looking way more ragged than they 
did in the first half, and we could see more cards soon.
 
64 mins: An inswinging Bradley free kick is not cleared fully, and Mexico are 
relieved when play is stopped for an offside. Now the game gets choppy again as
Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> commit a couple of fouls 
to break up the play and the US momentum. Vela picks up a yellow for a kick out 
on Jones.
 
62 mins: Best period of possession of the match for the US ends with Chandler 
getting into an advanced position on the right and cutting the ball back to the 
edge of the box, where the arriving Johnson sweeps his first-time shot just 
over the bar.

In the build up to that Chicharito was very lucky not to have what looked like 
a deliberate elbow on Brooks punished.
 
60 mins: Mexico rocking now, and suddenly there’s another US turnover and 
Bradley and Wood combine. Bradley could maybe have slipped another pass to 
Wood, but shoots and it’s a poor shot that’s saved easily, and a stungMexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> spring forward.

And now there’s a scramble in the US box, which ends in Herrera hitting the 
deck dramatically. Immediately the referee blows the whistle...and books 
Herrera for simulation. The right call — but it’s definitely Mexico’s turn to 
feel like nothing’s going their way.
 
58 mins: Another half-chance for Wood as he gets between the center backs 
again, but a heavy touch allows Salcedo to get to the ball and concede a 
corner, with Wood barreling into the box.

The corner allows a free header for Omar Gonzalez who doesn’t realize how much 
time he has and it’s weak.
 
56 mins: Besler fouls dos Santos wide right to concede a free kick, but Layun 
can’t clear Besler (again) as he tries to float a cross in.

USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> getting some joy 
turning Mexican players in midfield. Pulisic is the latest beneficiary as he 
sets up a US attack that ends in a corner. They waste it by getting a little 
too cute with their approach before Jones steps up to hit a long range shot 
which...well, it wasn’t what you’d call a good long range shot.
 
54 mins: The through ball to Altidore came from Brooks stepping up sharply to 
intercept and drive the ball forward to where Ayala had over-committed on 
Altidore and was spun easily. Nothing looked on at that moment, but once 
Altidore got his head upMexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> 
were scrambling.
 
Altidore turns brilliantly in picking up a ball out of defense and pushes the 
ball forward to the onrushing Wood. He has plenty to do as he forces his way 
into the box and looks to have overrun the ball momentarily, only to regain 
control and poke the ball into the net! Great time for the USA to score. How 
willMexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> respond?
 
50 mins: Brooks has to do some good work to put Vela off his shot, which 
eventually trundles through to Guzan.
 
Almost immediately there’s a comedy of errors in the Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> box, as the ball ricochets 
wildly. Eventually Jones’ shot from the edge of the box is blocked. Wild start 
to the half, and more urgency from the US than we saw in the previous 45 
minutes.

Ayala on for Reyes at half-time by the way. Mexico have one sub left.
 
Twitter is still speaking:

But it’s mostly puns about walls. Under the circumstances I will go high.
 
An email:

From Raymond Reardon:

“With Britain’s isolationist policies post brexit and the USA’s president to 
be’s isolationist talk pre-election shouldn’t the US and the UK form an 
Atlantic axis called USUK.”

Not entirely sure that’s helping, Raymond.
 
Half-time thoughts:

A great first half for Mexico, who quietened the home crowd from the start, by 
swarming past a USA team clearly uncomfortable in their new 3-5-2 formation. 
They adjusted their own formation to deal with the unfamiliar US line up with 
just a few seconds on the clock, and by the time the US adjusted to 4-4-2 in 
response,Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> had taken the 
lead and hit the woodwork twice.

And to add injury to insult, the US lost Tim Howard to injury late in the half.

Mexico saw out the half comfortably repelling the USA’s willing but mostly 
unimaginative attacks, and choosing their moments to counter and stretch theUSA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> back line.

As it stands Klinsmann need to find another gear from somewhere, or at least 
hope that he can change the mood of the game and the crowd with an early goal 
in the second half, perhaps from a set piece. But he needs something. At the 
moment he has Cero.
 
The Mexican players are all pleading their case to the referee after the 
whistle, as Jermaine Jones had committed a late-looking tackle that was never 
revisited after advantage was played. The referee waves them off, and the 
players trudge off to the locker room. A lot to think about for the home team 
in particular.
 
45 mins+3: The US are lumping long balls forward, but to little effect other 
than kickstartingMexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> counters. 
And that will be that for the half...
 
45 mins+1: Lovely run from Vela to get behind Besler and send a low ball 
across the box, but it’s cut out before any Mexican forward can inflict more 
damage. We’re in the first of three added minutes by the way.
 
44 mins: Salcedo has to make a lunging interception as Chandler whips in a 
cross intended for Altidore. With the attack breaking down Brooks steps up 
trying to force back possession and fouls Chicharito. The Mexican forward goes 
down hard, in a manner that is in no way related to Brooks already having been 
booked. A small melee ensues, and Brooks gets away with what’s likely a final 
warning.

A minute later, Chandler is not so lucky as his badly timed tackle on Corona 
getshim a yellow card. This has been a poor half for the US.
 
42 mins: Almost immediately Guzan is forced into a rushed clearance after 
Chicharito closes him down. The USA look like they’re just trying to get in at 
half-time and figure out a new blueprint.Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> looking very comfortable playing
