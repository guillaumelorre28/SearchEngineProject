“I don’t know where my sombrero is, but I can’t wait to come back next year,” 
says Hamilton, after clinching the Mexican GP. Thanks for your company, emails 
and tweets. The Brazilian GP, in a fortnight’s time is next up, where Rosberg 
can be crowned world champion – if he wins in Interlagos. Bye!

A quick word from Lewis Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> then, interviewed by Juan 
Pablo Montoya, of all people. “This is honestly the best crowd we get anywhere, 
these guys turn up and have great passion for this sport,” says Hamilton. “I 
love it, I’ve had Tacos every day since I’ve been here.”

As for Nico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg>, while 
Hamilton waves at the crowd, he says: “I have to accept second-place. We have 
had some massive battles out there, it’s OK to be second.” Which isn’t what 
Hamilton said before this race.

And then there’s the man everybody wants to speak to, Sebastian Vettel. “I was 
using a lot of sign language. He left the track and didn’t move so you can 
understand why I got annoyed. All of a sudden I was told to come up here.”

A 30th career win for Lewis Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton>, from pole position. 
Hamilton lifts the trophy aloft, with Tito Wolff duly applauding the Mercedes 
driver. A fine GP in Mexico City is all over. There’s confetti everywhere in 
the colours of the Mexico flag. It’s been some occasion, especially for 
Hamilton, and he and Rosberg go to Brazilian GP with it all very much to play 
for.

guard is unmoved. Here come the anthems, with Hamilton, Rosberg, and Vettel all

After wrongly being given it in the first place, Nico Rosberg’s just chucked 
the winners’ hat down on the table, evidently unable of just handing it to his 
team-mateLewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton>, 
who’s about 5mm away from him.

Vettel, after running towards the podium, is still reeling from that heated 
exchange with Verstappen it seems.

Max Verstappen’s been given a five-second penalty, so strictly speaking Vettel 
should be on that podium. Remarkably, Vettel’s running towards the podium. 
Verstappen’s been asked to leave. The Red Bull driver does at least have 
Hamilton and Rosberg talking in the cool-down room.

Nico Rosberg is 19 points clear of Lewis Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> in the drivers’ championship 
on the back of this. Hamilton’s clawed some ground back on his team-mate in 
Mexico City.

The overriding message of the final lap is that of wagging fingers between 
Vettel and Verstappen. It’s all a bit childish but it at least upped the anti 
on the final lap. But it’s Hamilton’s day, again, and it’s another Mercedes 
one-two.

Lewis Hamilton wins the Mexican Grand Prix!

It’s a Mercedes one-two, with Rosberg in second. Sebastian Vettel, who 
finishes fourth, is still venting his frustrations at Max Verstappen, who 
finishes third.

Lap 70/71 Vettel’s fuming. Somehow Ricciardo does not bypass the German, and 
Verstappen remains in third-place. Just as the Ferrari was bemoaning the Red 
Bulls’ antics, Ricciardo tried his luck and there was a small coming together, 
but nothing too serious.

Lap 69/71 Two laps to go! “He has to let me go,” cries  wolf  Vettel. And then 
there’s some beautiful choice words from the German. Will Verstappen hold up 
the Ferrari? The stewards say they will investigate the incident after the 
race. It’s all a bit tasty.

Lap 67/71 Räikkönen finds his way past Hülkenberg, putting the German in a 
spin. Hülkenberg was fortunate to avoid a collision there. And then, Verstappen 
locks up badly, but finds his way back to the track via some help with the 
grass. Verstappen’s been told to give the place to Vettel by Red Bull.

pushing mate, you will catch those two cars at this pace,” Red Bull tell 
Ricciardo. Meanwhile, Alonso and Palmer are up to a bit of touchy-feely in that 
battle for 13th.

Lap 64/71 Palmer’s medium tyres have yielded 61 laps while Alonso, directly 
behind him in 14th, tries to unsettle the Englishman. Alonso’s tyres in 
comparison have done just 17 laps. We probably haven’t seen the last of that 
battle.

Lap 61/71 Just the ten laps to go! To celebrate that feat, Button’s eased past 
Palmer to move into 12th. Unbelievably, Palmer, who pitted behind the safety 
car following Wehrlein’s incident on the first lap, has not changed tyres since.

Lap 58/71 Red Bull v Mercedes is the strategic battle with 13 laps to go. Do 
Mercedes have the pace to last the distance or might Ricciardo and Verstappen 
dampen all of the pre-race talk?

Lap 57/71 Hamilton leads Rosberg by more than seven seconds. It’s looking 
favourable for Mercedes, but they do have to pit again if they don’t have in 
the tank to finish with what they’ve got. Ricciardo, meanwhile, is flying.

Lap 55/71 Ricciardo’s 14.5secs behind Vettel, has he got time to thrash out 
that gap? You would guess not, but the Red Bull’s performed brilliantly so far. 
It’s hotting-up out there, with track temperatures beginning to soar once more.

Lap 53/71 Pérez must be fed up with the rear of Felipe Massa. He’s still 
looking at the sight of the Brazilian’s rear-wing, after 30 laps or so after 
sashaying behind the Williams. Meanwhile, Kimi Räikkönen’s got more problems 
with grip in the Ferrari. Something’s not right there.

Lap 51/71 Ricciardo pits. The one-stop doesn’t come off for Red Bull, then. 
Verstappen locked up a little bit on that lunge on Rosberg. Plenty of smiles 
from the team back at the garage in the pits. A maverick of a young driver, 
Verstappen.

Lap 49/71 “Left-rear feels like it’s taken a hit,” says Daniel Ricciardo. 
Verstappen, his Red Bull team-mate, has giving Rosberg a real difficult time. 
The teenager attempted to move into the second but ended up coming just off the 
track before recovering. Very positive move from Verstappen as ever. “Regroup, 
Max. Hard luck, nice try,” he’s told. You just get the feeling that Red Bull 
are trying to keep Verstappen on his leash or something.

Lewis Hamilton victory in Mexican Grand Prix keeps his title hopes alive
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/30/lewis-hamilton-mexican-grand-prix-title-hopes-alive-nico-rosberg> 
“I don’t know where my sombrero is, but I can’t wait to come back next year,” 
says Hamilton, after clinching the Mexican GP. Thanks for your company, emails 
and tweets. The Brazilian GP, in a fortnight’s time is next up, where Rosberg 
can be crowned world champion – if he wins in Interlagos. Bye!
 
A quick word from Lewis Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> then, interviewed by Juan 
Pablo Montoya, of all people. “This is honestly the best crowd we get anywhere, 
these guys turn up and have great passion for this sport,” says Hamilton. “I 
love it, I’ve had Tacos every day since I’ve been here.”

As for Nico Rosberg <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nico-rosberg>, while 
Hamilton waves at the crowd, he says: “I have to accept second-place. We have 
had some massive battles out there, it’s OK to be second.” Which isn’t what 
Hamilton said before this race.

And then there’s the man everybody wants to speak to, Sebastian Vettel. “I was 
using a lot of sign language. He left the track and didn’t move so you can 
understand why I got annoyed. All of a sudden I was told to come up here.”
 
A 30th career win for Lewis Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton>, from pole position. 
Hamilton lifts the trophy aloft, with Tito Wolff duly applauding the Mercedes 
driver. A fine GP in Mexico City is all over. There’s confetti everywhere in 
the colours of the Mexico flag. It’s been some occasion, especially for 
Hamilton, and he and Rosberg go to Brazilian GP with it all very much to play 
for.
 
A fan has just dropped his smartphone while trying to lineup a hazy shot of 
Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton>. The security 
guard is unmoved. Here come the anthems, with Hamilton, Rosberg, and Vettel all 
on the podium.
 
After wrongly being given it in the first place, Nico Rosberg’s just chucked 
the winners’ hat down on the table, evidently unable of just handing it to his 
team-mateLewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton>, 
who’s about 5mm away from him.

Vettel, after running towards the podium, is still reeling from that heated 
exchange with Verstappen it seems.
 
1 Hamilton

2 Rosberg

3 Vettel

4 Ricciardo

5 Verstappen 
 
Max Verstappen’s been given a five-second penalty, so strictly speaking Vettel 
should be on that podium. Remarkably, Vettel’s running towards the podium. 
Verstappen’s been asked to leave. The Red Bull driver does at least have 
Hamilton and Rosberg talking in the cool-down room.
 
Nico Rosberg is 19 points clear of Lewis Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> in the drivers’ championship 
on the back of this. Hamilton’s clawed some ground back on his team-mate in 
Mexico City.
 
The overriding message of the final lap is that of wagging fingers between 
Vettel and Verstappen. It’s all a bit childish but it at least upped the anti 
on the final lap. But it’s Hamilton’s day, again, and it’s another Mercedes 
one-two.
 
“Really solid weekend, Lewis,” Mercedes tell Hamilton. Well, it’s back-to-back 
wins for the race winner.
 
It’s a Mercedes one-two, with Rosberg in second. Sebastian Vettel, who 
finishes fourth, is still venting his frustrations at Max Verstappen, who 
finishes third.
 
Lap 71/71 Here we go then! It’s a bonkers race for third, whilst Lewis Hamilton
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton> is still out in front. Nico 
Rosberg remains in second.
 
Lap 70/71 Vettel’s fuming. Somehow Ricciardo does not bypass the German, and 
Verstappen remains in third-place. Just as the Ferrari was bemoaning the Red 
Bulls’ antics, Ricciardo tried his luck and there was a small coming together, 
but nothing too serious.
 
Lap 69/71 Two laps to go! “He has to let me go,” cries  wolf  Vettel. And then 
there’s some beautiful choice words from the German. Will Verstappen hold up 
the Ferrari? The stewards say they will investigate the incident after the 
race. It’s all a bit tasty.
 
Lap 67/71 Räikkönen finds his way past Hülkenberg, putting the German in a 
spin. Hülkenberg was fortunate to avoid a collision there. And then, Verstappen 
locks up badly, but finds his way back to the track via some help with the 
grass. Verstappen’s been told to give the place to Vettel by Red Bull.
 
66/71 Vettel flies past Ocon to stay in hot pursuit of Verstappen. “Let’s keep 
pushing mate, you will catch those two cars at this pace,” Red Bull tell 
Ricciardo. Meanwhile, Alonso and Palmer are up to a bit of touchy-feely in that 
battle for 13th.
 
Lap 65/71 Vettel now trails Verstappen by 1.4secs, and the Ferrari is 
advancing nicely on the Red Bull. Where’s Ricciardo? He’s 19 seconds behind 
race leader,Lewis Hamilton <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton>. 
As it stands, it’s a Mercedes one-two.
 
Lap 64/71 Palmer’s medium tyres have yielded 61 laps while Alonso, directly 
behind him in 14th, tries to unsettle the Englishman. Alonso’s tyres in 
comparison have done just 17 laps. We probably haven’t seen the last of that 
battle.
 
Lap 63/71 “I can see him coming,” says Verstappen of Vettel, who has been 
storming through the last few laps because of those practically box fresh 
tyres. Ricciardo could do with helping out his team-mate at the opponent.
 
Lap 62/71 Hülkenberg, in sixth, shackles the attentions of Räikkönen in a nice 
battle in the points.
 
Lap 61/71 Just the ten laps to go! To celebrate that feat, Button’s eased past 
Palmer to move into 12th. Unbelievably, Palmer, who pitted behind the safety 
car following Wehrlein’s incident on the first lap, has not changed tyres since.
 
Lap 60/71 So, as earlier, if it stays this way, Hamilton would trail Rosberg 
by 19 points in the drivers’ championship. The race leaders are currently as 
follows:

1 Hamilton

2 Rosberg

3 Verstappen

4 Vettel

5 Ricciardo
 
Lap 59/71 Verstappen is three seconds behind Rosberg. Ricciardo’s charging 
towards the leaders, he’s 26 seconds behind Hamilton with 12 laps to go.
 
Lap 58/71 Red Bull v Mercedes is the strategic battle with 13 laps to go. Do 
Mercedes have the pace to last the distance or might Ricciardo and Verstappen 
dampen all of the pre-race talk?
 
Lap 57/71 Hamilton leads Rosberg by more than seven seconds. It’s looking 
favourable for Mercedes, but they do have to pit again if they don’t have in 
the tank to finish with what they’ve got. Ricciardo, meanwhile, is flying.
 
56/71 Jolyon Palmer’s enjoying himself. He’s had a good race and is currently 
jostling for 11th, currently held by Ericsson. Palmer started the race at the 
back of the grid, remember.
 
Lap 55/71 Ricciardo’s 14.5secs behind Vettel, has he got time to thrash out 
that gap? You would guess not, but the Red Bull’s performed brilliantly so far. 
It’s hotting-up out there, with track temperatures beginning to soar once more.
 
Lap 53/71 Pérez must be fed up with the rear of Felipe Massa. He’s still 
looking at the sight of the Brazilian’s rear-wing, after 30 laps or so after 
sashaying behind the Williams. Meanwhile, Kimi Räikkönen’s got more problems 
with grip in the Ferrari. Something’s not right there.
 
Lap 52/71 Suddenly, there’s not too much longer to run in Mexico City. 
Hamilton is out in front, trailed by team-mate Rosberg and then Verstappen’s in 
third. Meanwhile, Ricciardo has just moved into fifth after overtaking 
Hülkenberg. Ricciardo’s now 20 seconds or so behind Vettel in the Ferrari.
 
Lap 51/71 Ricciardo pits. The one-stop doesn’t come off for Red Bull, then. 
Verstappen locked up a little bit on that lunge on Rosberg. Plenty of smiles 
from the team back at the garage in the pits. A maverick of a young driver, 
Verstappen.
 
Lap 49/71 “Left-rear feels like it’s taken a hit,” says Daniel Ricciardo. 
Verstappen, his Red Bull team-mate, has giving Rosberg a real difficult time. 
The teenager attempted to move into the second but ended up coming just off the 
track before recovering. Very positive move from Verstappen as ever. “Regroup, 
Max. Hard luck, nice try,” he’s told. You just get the feeling that Red Bull 
are trying to keep Verstappen on his leash or something.
