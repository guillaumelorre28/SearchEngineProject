The former Manchester City and Newcastle United midfielder and his 
representative spent almost two hours in talks with the club on Thursday 
afternoon, but there was no change to his situation.

It is understood the meeting was the first stage in a formal disciplinary 
process, which the club confirmed it had instigated this month.

The meeting came on the day Barton was initially due to attend a Scottish 
Football Association hearing over charges that the midfielder broke strict 
betting rules. He was accused of placing 44 bets on games between 1 July and 
15 September this year.

The hearing was put back until 17  November following Barton’s request for 
more time to prepare a defence and the stand-off between club and player now 
looks likely to continue until at least that date.

Barton joined Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> in the 
summer from Burnley, signing a two-year deal in July said to be worth £20,000 a 
week.
