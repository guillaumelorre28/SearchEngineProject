Perhaps it was something about the light that morning on Vulcano. Or maybe the 
sound of goat bells tinkling across the hillside. Something made up Laura 
Panico’s mind. She had been here all summer visiting friends. It was too lovely 
to leave to go back to Britain. But how was she to earn a living?

Five years on, Laura has a business bringing visitors to Vulcano – one of the 
Aeolian islands, a confetti trail of volcanic outcrops off the north coast of 
Sicily. Her guests spend a week learning to cook the way her friend’s 
grandmother does, pulling squid from the sea and cooking them on the boat, and 
savouring the unique aroma the volcanic soils give to the local wines.

We reach Vulcano by hydrofoil, jetting across a shimmering sea from Sicily, 
then step out on to a quayside of one-storey shops and restaurants that looked 
like it had been that way for ever. No time to look around though: we need to 
start on lunch.

 Myla shows us how to make arancini. 
Local taxi driver Santi drives us past soaring views of the smouldering 
volcano to Maria Tindara’s trattoria up in the hills. In the days when Maria 
did the cooking, there was no electricity, and produce came up the track by 
donkey. Things have changed – there’s a Tarmac road, gas and electricity, and 
daughter-in-law Rosi and grandson Gilberto run the kitchen now. But the recipes 
are much the same.

Rosi came to work here as a teenager, and Maria’s son Angelo took a shine to 
her. “I thought, ‘She’s the one for me’,” he says, eyes twinkling under bushy 
brows. And he married her. “I still work in the kitchen,” laughs Rosi. “They 
just don’t pay me now.”

 Squid stuffed with cheese, herbs and breadcrumbs. 
She shows us how to roll narrow maccheroni tubes. The secret tool? An old 
umbrella spoke. Cut a knuckle-length of dough, push the spoke down into it, 
join the sides up. And roll. It sticks to the board and my fingers, but slowly 
I find the right balance of pressure and rolling action and mine start to look 
vaguely edible.

Sharing a rolling board is a great ice-breaker, and I quickly get to know the 
others on the trip. There’s Brian and John from New York, Barbara and John who 
live in France, John’s son Matt and his partner Louise, all the way from 
Australia, and Monica and Nick from London.

We cook a sauce of sardines, fennel and sweet tomatoes to go with the pasta. 
Pudding is a tangy tart made with milk, crushed almonds and lemon. Thesecondo 
piatto is slivers of beef, which we stuff with breadcrumbs, capers and cheese 
then deep-fry in olive oil. It’s a truism for a reason – food tastes better if 
you’ve cooked it (or helped cook it, anyway). Lunch lasted long into the 
afternoon.

 Lemon and almond milk tart. 
If family recipes tested through generations are a key ingredient here, fresh 
produce is another. Without doubt the freshest came the following evening. 
Filippo has fishedtotani – large brown squid – in these clear waters for 15 
years. We sit on his boat’s roof, dusky sunlight stretching a pool of orange 
towards us across the waves. A fisherman called Billy drops flashing lights 
with scary-looking hooks over the side. We spy a pod of dolphins.

It’s idyllic, but Filippo isn’t happy. “Cheeky dolphins,” he mutters. “They 
steal the squid. We might have to see if they’ll deliver pizza out here!”

They haul up the first light 20 minutes later … nothing. Filippo began the 
evening in jovial mood, but now he is serious, barking at us to keep the noise 
down. A second light comes up, empty. We watch in awkward silence. Will we 
catch anything? And if not, what will we eat for dinner?

As they haul up the third, Filippo is suddenly animated, and the other 
fishermen cast lines into the sea. Whoosh! A slithering squid flops over the 
side, almost landing on my foot. More follow. Billy gives me a line, motioning 
me to pull. I haul and haul, and finally, splat! Up comes my squid, in a spray 
of water.

 Chef Rosi and husband Angelo. 
The squid is gutted, chopped, dusted in flour, then cooked in hot olive oil. 
We eat it with our hands, hot and fresh with hunks of bread, salad and a 
tumbler of dry, local white. It’s late, and we are starving, but the food 
tastes spectacular.

The bounty of these islands is everywhere. Pretty much every ingredient we 
cook with has come straight from the ground or sea. Laura brings fresh 
ricotta-filled pastries for breakfast each morning at our cosy rural hotel, 
Villa Saracena, and one day takes us for a stroll just a mile up the road to 
see where the gorgeous curd cheese is made.

We find Fabrizio pouring goat’s milk into a large aluminium vat. His 350 goats 
are milked by hand every morning. I’m not remotely surprised to learn that his 
dad showed him how to make cheese as a boy. It’s a simple process – heating, 
cooling, adding rennet, spooning off curds. He shows us pots of creamy ricotta 
and harder, dried cheese, too.

 Custard tart with cherries. 
Family recipes, fresh produce … the final magic ingredient is fertile volcanic 
soil, which is great for goats and also for grapes. We often hop on boats to 
visit other islands during our stay, and on nearby Salina we visit the Hauner 
family’s vineyard. Racks of local malvasia grapes are drying in the sunshine. 
“Drying increases the sugar content, which makes them perfect for dessert 
wine,” says Andrea, as he shows us the cellar where wines are gently mellowing.

 Matt stuffs cannoli with ricotta cheese. 
His great, great grandfather planted many of their vines. Three generations of 
the family taste the wines each harvest and decide the blend for perfect 
flavours. Andrea’s mother brings outfrittata, salty cheese, figs, tomato 
marmalade and capers to complement the wines. By the end I can’t remember which 
I like most. They are all splendid.

On the way back we stop in a shallow cove. I pull on my trunks and plunge into 
the sea. Floating on my back, full of fine wine and food, I decide I’m rather 
glad Laura chose to share her slice of paradise. Then I wonder what will be for 
dinner.
