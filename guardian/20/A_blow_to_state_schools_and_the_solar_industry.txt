Many state schools struggling to help disadvantaged pupils (Report, 22 November
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/22/stark-choice-as-schools-struggle-to-foot-bill-for-poorer-students>
) are facing a further demand on their shrinking budgets. Prudent schools that 
have invested in solar panels to reduce their electricity bills nowface a 
retrospective six- to eight-fold hike in their tax rates

, if the government gets its way. This would be socially divisive, as it will 
apply to state schools but not to the private schools that have charitable 
status. The higher rates will also apply to businesses and other organisations 
that use solar electricity internally. This is yet another blow to the solar 
industry, already reeling from four separate subsidy cuts since May 2015. UK 
solar had been expanding exponentially, creating many new jobs and reducing 
both the wholesale price of electricity and our carbon emissions.
