Under Holoubek, Sparta have won three in succession in Europe and now head the 
group before the match at the Generali Arena. TheSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> manager said: “Sparta are a 
good team with technical players and a good collective. They have another 
trainer now and he changed, not the system, but a little the philosophy. It’s a 
strong team, with a strong defensive block and it will be difficult.

“It’s a difficult game, an important game, because if you can take three 
points it’s important for the squad.”

Shane Long hopes to inspire the bid to reach the knockout stages after leaving 
his newborn son. Long’s preparations have included Jax Anthony coming home for 
the first time. Asked if it had been difficult to leave his son behind, the 
29-year-old said: “It has been tough. We had him last Monday. He is now nine 
days old. We didn’t get him home until Sunday, so I’ve only had two or three 
days with him. It is amazing. It is a madhouse now with three kids under six 
but I’m loving every minute.

“It’s nice to come back into the squad and be where we are in the table. It is 
a massive game for both sides. For them it could mean qualification from the 
group and the same for us. They are a different team to the one we faced in the 
first game.”
