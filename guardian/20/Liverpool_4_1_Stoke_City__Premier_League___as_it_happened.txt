Jordan Henderson, who was excellent, has a post-match chat:

I think early on they put us under some pressure, we struggled to deal with 
the long ball in the first 10, 15 minutes. Then we adapted well towards the end 
of the first half we dealt with it better. After the goal I thought we 
dominated again. You keep asking if we had to win, I say the same thing back. 
It doesn’t matter what anyone else does. It matters what we’re doing. Every 
win’s a good result, it doesn’t matter who you’re playing.

And Daniel Sturridge has also spoken to Sky:

We’re very resilient. We never give up, we keep going and we know the hard 
work’s going to pay off at some point. It’s nice to play and score goals. I’ve 
not had many gifts like that for a while. I consider that one a gift from the 
defender to be fair. Those ones, the one on ones, are a striker’s dream. The 
most important thing is I keep my mindset as positive as possible. It’s a team 
game. Everyone’s going to be needed at some point. I stay positive and give my 
input when I can.

This is quite impressive, even if going a goal down to Swansea isn’t really 
something to be boasted about under any circumstances.

Liverpool have gone 1-0 down in 4 matches this season and won 3 of them. Only 
Chelsea & Everton have won as much from a goal down#lfc

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>. Stoke’s games against the top 
five have so far ended 3-1, 4-1, 4-1 and 4-0. Chelsea are next for them.

90+3 mins: They play it short, and when the cross eventually comes in only 
Wijnaldum is there to compete for it, which he does only half-heartedly.

88 mins: Stoke, in the knowledge that any further scoring is more likely to 
harm them than help them, play aimless keep-ball for a bit.

85 mins: This half has been a bit of a disappointment, following the 
breathless, constantly entertaining first. Stoke’s interest has dwindled along 
with their chance of victory.

56 - Daniel Sturridge's goal against Stoke came just 56 seconds after coming 
on as a second half substitute. Impetus.

83 mins: Mané tees up Henderson, who has a free shot from the edge of the 
area. It was probably going wide, but anyway hit Sturridge, bounced up, and 
Moreno’s acrobatic follow-up is deflected wide. The corner is sent in low and 
slow, and straight to a defender.

74 mins: Firmino misses from five yards! From another short corner Henderson 
picks out Lovren with a lovely looping pass pass, the defender volleys the ball 
across goal and it hits Firmino, who to be fair didn’t know a great deal about 
it, and bounces away from goal.

GOAL! Liverpool 4-1 Stoke (Sturridge, 71 mins)

Johnson has the ball on the right, and to his left Shawcross points towards 
the goalkeeper, telling him where he should send it. Sturridge sees this, and 
trots towards Grant to cut off a potential back-pass. So Johnson passes to 
Shawcross instead, and he immediately and without looking up passes straight to 
Sturridge’s feet, and he goes round Grant and slots into an empty net!

66 mins: Lovely work from Milner on the left, who turns twice, befuddling a 
couple of defenders on each occasion, before picking out Clyne at the far post. 
His header is a bit limp, and Grant saves.

63 mins: Lallana tackles Diouf and stays on the ground, hands covering his

hold him off.

61 mins: Firmino passes to Mané, whose left-foot shot from just inside the 
area is deflected narrowly wide. That attack was a little too easy, and hinted 
at possible floodgate-opening to come.

GOAL! Liverpool 3-1 Stoke (Mbula own goal, 60 mins)

A goal and an assist there from Mbula, whose poor defensive header dropped to 
Henderson, who swiftly passed to Origi on the right, and then raced back to get 
just in front of Mané to convert the low cross!
 Mbula taps the cross in ahead of Mane. Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters

56 mins: Firmino tries to curl a pass into Mané’s path with the outside of his 
right foot, and comesthat close to pulling off an eye-of-the-needle beauty. He 
doesn’t, though. It’s overhit, chased down, kept in play and eventually 
Lallana’s shot is deflected wide.

53 mins: A long ball is sent looping forward towards Crouch and lands in an 
awkward space approximately equidistant between Crouch, Lovren and Mignolet. 
The Belgian keeper wins the race and just stays in his area.

49 mins: A first chance of the second half, and it’s beautifully created, 
Milner playing a one-two with Mané and running into space from the left. He is 
left, though, with the choice between a very difficult shot and some kind of 
cross/pull-back arrangement, goes for the former and misses goal from a sharp 
angle.

The players are back out. Stoke continue to hold a threat, but haven’t been

It could, of course, all change yet.

45+2 mins: Ooooh! Milner gets down the left and passes towards Firmino. The 
ball’s just behind him but flicks off his heel and perfectly towards Mané, 
whose first-time left-footer zips just wide!

GOAL! Liverpool 2-1 Stoke (Firmino, 44 mins)

Firmino puts Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> in the 
driving seat! Milner passes to him and then runs forward for the return, 
distracting a couple of defenders and giving the Brazilian a slender pocket of 
space in which to turn and shoot left-footed across goal, against the far post, 
back across goal, and finally in!

43 mins: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> continue 
to knock on the door, but it’s just not opening for them. Clyne picks out Origi 
in the area, but his first touch takes him away from goal and the chance is 
lost.

41 mins: Good pressing from Stoke leads to a couple of heart-in-mouth moments 
in Liverpool’s defence, but they escape with the ball, race upfield and in the 
end Mané goes past Imbula, races into the penalty area, and then runs out of 
pitch.

38 mins: Chance for Firmino! Lallana pulls back, but the ball bounces just 
before it reaches Firmino, and as a result he scoops his shot over the bar from 
15 yards.

37 mins: Another long-range shot from Milner. His last was too high, this one 
never leaves the ground. But it is rather slow, and Grant falls on it.

GOAL! Liverpool 1-1 Stoke (Lallana, 35 mins)

Origi holds up the ball on halfway and finds Mané in space on the right. His 
centre is too fast for Lallana, but the ball runs into Johnson, bounces back to 
Lallana, and this time he shoots low across goal from another acute angle, and 
in!

Here’s Andy Hunter’s match report from Anfield, and with that I’ll bid you

Liverpool sink Stoke City to go second after Adam Lallana sparks recovery

Jordan Henderson, who was excellent, has a post-match chat:

I think early on they put us under some pressure, we struggled to deal with 
the long ball in the first 10, 15 minutes. Then we adapted well towards the end 
of the first half we dealt with it better. After the goal I thought we 
dominated again. You keep asking if we had to win, I say the same thing back. 
It doesn’t matter what anyone else does. It matters what we’re doing. Every 
win’s a good result, it doesn’t matter who you’re playing.

And Daniel Sturridge has also spoken to Sky:

We’re very resilient. We never give up, we keep going and we know the hard 
work’s going to pay off at some point. It’s nice to play and score goals. I’ve 
not had many gifts like that for a while. I consider that one a gift from the 
defender to be fair. Those ones, the one on ones, are a striker’s dream. The 
most important thing is I keep my mindset as positive as possible. It’s a team 
game. Everyone’s going to be needed at some point. I stay positive and give my 
input when I can.

though Kenny Dalglish beat him to the achievement.

It’s all over, and what started awkwardly ended very comfortably for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>. Stoke’s games against the top 
five have so far ended 3-1, 4-1, 4-1 and 4-0. Chelsea are next for them.
 
90+3 mins: They play it short, and when the cross eventually comes in only 
Wijnaldum is there to compete for it, which he does only half-heartedly.
 
90+2 mins: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have a 
corner to take, and a minute to play.
 
90+1 mins: Into stoppage time we roll, and there’ll be about three minutes of 
it.
 
88 mins: Stoke, in the knowledge that any further scoring is more likely to 
harm them than help them, play aimless keep-ball for a bit.
 
85 mins: This half has been a bit of a disappointment, following the 
breathless, constantly entertaining first. Stoke’s interest has dwindled along 
with their chance of victory.
OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) 
56 - Daniel Sturridge's goal against Stoke came just 56 seconds after coming 
on as a second half substitute. Impetus.

84 mins: Crouch gets a generous round of applause as he comes off, and Bony 
comes on.
 
83 mins: Mané tees up Henderson, who has a free shot from the edge of the 
area. It was probably going wide, but anyway hit Sturridge, bounced up, and 
Moreno’s acrobatic follow-up is deflected wide. The corner is sent in low and 
slow, and straight to a defender.
 Moreno shoots. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters  
81 mins: A long Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
move ends with Moreno overhitting a pass beyond Milner and into touch.
 
78 mins: After a decent move, Afellay’s 20-yarder dips just over the bar, as 
close as Stoke have come this half.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> promptly bring on Moreno, 
Firmino coming off.
 
76 mins: Sturridge’s was Liverpool’s 100th Premier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> goal under Klopp’s 
stewardship. It has taken them 48 games.
 
75 mins: Stoke bring on Afellay, in place of Diouf.
 
74 mins: Firmino misses from five yards! From another short corner Henderson 
picks out Lovren with a lovely looping pass pass, the defender volleys the ball 
across goal and it hits Firmino, who to be fair didn’t know a great deal about 
it, and bounces away from goal.
 
Johnson has the ball on the right, and to his left Shawcross points towards 
the goalkeeper, telling him where he should send it. Sturridge sees this, and 
trots towards Grant to cut off a potential back-pass. So Johnson passes to 
Shawcross instead, and he immediately and without looking up passes straight to 
Sturridge’s feet, and he goes round Grant and slots into an empty net!

69 mins: Lallana and Origi are the ones making way.
 
68 mins: And Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> 
prepare a double change of their own, Can and Sturridge stripping off and 
limbering up.
 
66 mins: The first substitution, as Ramadan Sobhi comes on for Whelan.
 
66 mins: Lovely work from Milner on the left, who turns twice, befuddling a 
couple of defenders on each occasion, before picking out Clyne at the far post. 
His header is a bit limp, and Grant saves.
 
63 mins: Lallana tackles Diouf and stays on the ground, hands covering his 
eyes. Ooh, turns out he got a poke in the face as the Stoke player tried to 
hold him off.
 
61 mins: Firmino passes to Mané, whose left-foot shot from just inside the 
area is deflected narrowly wide. That attack was a little too easy, and hinted 
at possible floodgate-opening to come.
 
A goal and an assist there from Mbula, whose poor defensive header dropped to 
Henderson, who swiftly passed to Origi on the right, and then raced back to get 
just in front of Mané to convert the low cross!

56 mins: Firmino tries to curl a pass into Mané’s path with the outside of his 
right foot, and comesthat close to pulling off an eye-of-the-needle beauty. He 
doesn’t, though. It’s overhit, chased down, kept in play and eventually 
Lallana’s shot is deflected wide.
 
54 mins: Stoke keep pushing, Diouf winning their second corner of the game.
 
53 mins: A long ball is sent looping forward towards Crouch and lands in an 
awkward space approximately equidistant between Crouch, Lovren and Mignolet. 
The Belgian keeper wins the race and just stays in his area.
 
49 mins: A first chance of the second half, and it’s beautifully created, 
Milner playing a one-two with Mané and running into space from the left. He is 
left, though, with the choice between a very difficult shot and some kind of 
cross/pull-back arrangement, goes for the former and misses goal from a sharp 
angle.
 
46 mins: Stoke get us back under way, with both teams unchanged at the 
interval.
 
The players are back out. Stoke continue to hold a threat, but haven’t been 
able to cope with the zip of Liverpool’s passing in front of their back-line. 
It could, of course, all change yet.
 
Watching the replays, Diouf’s reaction to Liverpool’s second is absolutely 
corking: down on his knees, arms raised towards the heavens, begging for divine 
intervention.
 
45+4 mins: The referee brings a breathless first half to a close. I’ll have 
another helping of that please, waiter.
 Gareth Southgate, entertained. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images  
45+2 mins: Ooooh! Milner gets down the left and passes towards Firmino. The 
ball’s just behind him but flicks off his heel and perfectly towards Mané, 
whose first-time left-footer zips just wide!
 
45+1 mins: There will be approximately three minutes of stoppage time.
 
Firmino puts Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> in the 
driving seat! Milner passes to him and then runs forward for the return, 
distracting a couple of defenders and giving the Brazilian a slender pocket of 
space in which to turn and shoot left-footed across goal, against the far post, 
back across goal, and finally in!

43 mins: Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> continue 
to knock on the door, but it’s just not opening for them. Clyne picks out Origi 
in the area, but his first touch takes him away from goal and the chance is 
lost.
 
41 mins: Good pressing from Stoke leads to a couple of heart-in-mouth moments 
in Liverpool’s defence, but they escape with the ball, race upfield and in the 
end Mané goes past Imbula, races into the penalty area, and then runs out of 
pitch.
 
38 mins: Chance for Firmino! Lallana pulls back, but the ball bounces just 
before it reaches Firmino, and as a result he scoops his shot over the bar from 
15 yards.
 
37 mins: Another long-range shot from Milner. His last was too high, this one 
never leaves the ground. But it is rather slow, and Grant falls on it.
 
36 mins: Allen flies in on Wijnaldum, but the ball has already gone, and he 
gets booked for his troubles.
 
Origi holds up the ball on halfway and finds Mané in space on the right. His 
centre is too fast for Lallana, but the ball runs into Johnson, bounces back to 
Lallana, and this time he shoots low across goal from another acute angle, and 
in!

33 mins: Mané feels that Pieters is applying too much pressure to his shoulder 
and stops. The referee disagrees, and waves play on. Liverpool’s fans howl in 
disapproval.
 
30 mins: Space suddenly opens up for Pieters on Stoke’s left, but he delays 
his cross a little too long, and it is deflected towards Mignolet.
