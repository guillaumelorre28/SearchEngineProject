This time of year, when there’s so much light, all Swedish people want to do 
is go outside and enjoy it. There’s a place in the south of Stockholm called 
Södra Teatern that’s set on a hill overlooking the entire city. In the summer, 
the venue opens this huge terrace, called the Mosebacketerrassen, that seats 
about 1,500 and has the most spectacular views – you can see the water from 
almost every angle, which makes for a beautiful backdrop. And because it’s not 
in the city centre, it’s not at all touristy, just full of locals – apart from 
the odd visitor who has stumbled across it.

There’s so much history here. The place was built in 1859 (it’s the city’s 
oldest private theatre) and it actually comprises several venues, including a 
jazz club, which hosts brunches and concerts, and a theatre that feels a bit 
like a smaller version of our opera house. It still has its original box seats, 
velvet and crystal chandeliers with room for about 450 people, so the 
theatrical experience is very intimate.

One of the smaller auditoria, which only seats 40 or 50, showcases authors and 
poets reading their work. It’s wonderful that all the performing arts sort of 
blend together here.
