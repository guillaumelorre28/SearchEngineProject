To fully comprehend how much England’s top-flight has changed since Arsène 
Wenger <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsene-wenger> first strode into 
Highbury’s famous marble halls for his official unveiling on 22 September 1996, 
a list of the other managers employed in the Premier League that day is most 
instructive.

Arsène Wenger: 20 years at Arsenal – an incredible journey of joy and 
frustration | Amy Lawrence

Six years after the Czech Jozef Venglos became the first born outside Britain 
or Ireland to take charge of a top division club, Ruud Gullit – hired byChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> a few months previously to 
replace the new England manager Glenn Hoddle – was the only foreigner in a job, 
with the remainder all largely familiar faces steeped in the traditions of the 
old school.

Tottenham had briefly flirted with Ossie Ardiles but reverted to the tried and 
tested when the Argentinian was sacked in November 1994. Wenger’s arrival 
changed all that. By the turn of the century, five more had cut their teeth in 
the Premier League and the number now stands at more than 50, including all of 
last season’s top eight clubs.

The revolution took some time to build momentum, however, with Wenger guiding 
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> to third place after 
beating Blackburn 2-0 in his first match. Of the other clubs in the division 
that season, 220 managers have been appointed, with two of the clubs 
(Nottingham Forest and Southampton) making 17 apiece.

That means the other 19 clubs have had an average of more than 11 different 
managers since Wenger’s arrival, while none of the men who were in their posts 
that autumn day 20 years ago are still involved in club management.

The only non-British or Irish manager in the Premier League when Wenger 
arrived, Gullit steered Chelsea to the FA Cup in May 1997 – their first major 
trophy in 26 years. But the Dutchman was surprisingly sacked the following 
season with the club second in the table behind Manchester United and went on 
to manage Newcastle, Feyenoord and LA Galaxy, although his last managerial post 
with the Russian club Terek Grozny in 2011lasted less than six months

After guiding Coventry away from trouble the previous season, Atkinson moved 
“upstairs” to become director of football in November 1996 and was replaced by 
Gordon Strachan – then a sprightly 39-year-old who still occasionally pulled on 
his boots. Atkinson went back to Sheffield Wednesday a year later before 
famouslysitting in the wrong dugout 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfhLi2gyG8E> before a match against Arsenal on 
the first day of his final managerial post at Nottingham Forest. “I just 
happened to look around and I’m stood with Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, 
Nelson Vivas,” he recalled. “I thought: ‘How are we bottom of the league with 
these in the team?’” His book, The Manager, was released this month.

Despite winning the FA Cup just 16 months earlier – Everton’s last piece of

after the former striker had resigned in March following a disagreement with

Road until October 1998, when he moved to Tottenham. That proved to be his 
final managerial post, lasting nearly three years at Arsenal’s bitter rivals.

It looked like a new era of dominance could be about to begin just as Wenger 
arrived in north London but Roy Evans’s side failed to build on a spectacular 
start to the season that had seen them top the table over Christmas. A 
fourth-place finish was a huge disappointment and perhaps with covetous glances 
at the Frenchman making waves at Highbury, Gérard Houllier was appointed in the 
summer of 1998 – initially alongside Evans. That didn’t last too long, with 
Evans making way and eventually going on to have a spell as Fulham caretaker, 
Wales assistant and as director of football at Swindon Town.

 less than a month after Wenger’s unveiling, it appeared that Fergie might be 
losing his touch. But a surge in the second half of the season helped United 
retain their title ahead of Kevin Keegan’s Newcastle. “What does he know about 
English football, coming from Japan?” Ferguson had asked on Wenger’s arrival, 
although their rivalry took a while to really warm up with Arsenal’s title 
triumph in 1998. “Perhaps he sent it by horse?” replied Wenger after his 
counterpart claimed he had apologised after another spat a year later. It was 
to become a recurring theme untilFerguson’s retirement in 2013

The purchase of Brazilian midfielder Emerson and Italian striker Fabrizio 
Ravanelli had raised expectations on Teesside but a season that had promised so 
much ended in relegation and defeats in both the League and FA Cup finals. A 
three-point deduction after Robson said he was unable to field a team against 
Blackburn due to a severe injury and illness crisis ended up being crucial, 
with the manager even making an appearance off the bench against Wenger’s 
Arsenal at Highbury. He led them back to the Premier League at the first 
attempt before eventually leaving in 2000 and has since had spells at Bradford, 
West Brom, Sheffield United and with Thailand.

After throwing away a 12-point lead the previous season that led to their 
manager’s infamous rant at Ferguson, Newcastle started the new campaign with 
renewed hope after spending a world record £15m on Alan Shearer. Butthe 5-0 
victory over United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/sep/20/david-squires-on-the-20th-anniversary-of-newcastle-5-0-manchester-united>
 was as good as it got. Keegan shocked the Toon Army in January by announcing 
his resignation, claiming he had “taken the club as far as I can” amid rumours 
of a fallout with the owner Sir John Hall. Kenny Dalglish stepped into the 
breach and guided them to another second place, while Keegan went on to manage 
Fulham, England and Manchester City before an ill-fatedreturn to St James’ Park 
in 2008 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/04/newcastleunited.premierleague1>

Forest never recovered from a poor start to the season and by the time Arsenal 
visited the City Ground in December, Clark had been sacked. The caretaker 
Stuart Pearce inspired a surprise 2-1 victory for the league’s bottom side but 
the task of saving the two-times European Cup winners proved beyond even him. 
Clark – who had been linked with the England job before the FA opted for Glenn 
Hoddle – was out of work for approximately a week, when Manchester City 
appointed him to replace Steve Coppell. That proved to be his last post and he 
was last seen serving as Forest chairman before being unceremoniously sacked as 
club ambassador in 2013.

Top of the table after four straight wins to begin the season, things soon 
unravelled for Pleat. They ended the season a respectable seventh despite a 
dramatic collapse in form before Christmas, including a 4-1 thumping at 
Highbury after Des Walker was sent off. Pleat lasted only another few months at 
Hillsborough and returned to Tottenham as director of football, stepping in as 
caretaker on two occasions – neither of which yielded a victory over the 
biggest rivals. He remains part of the furniture at White Hart Lane as a 
consultant and was instrumental inthe signing of Dele Alli from MK Dons

wasthe signing of striker Ali Dia

, supposedly on the recommendation of his cousin, 1995 Ballon d’Or winner 
George Weah, until it turned out that Dia was actually Senegalese and not 
related to Milan’s Liberian striker. Souness left in the summer to join Torino 
but lasted only four months before jumping ship to Benfica, Blackburn and then 
Newcastle. Observer Sport Monthly voted the Scot as the Worst Football Manager 
two years after he left St James’ Park with the club flirting with relegation 
and he hasn’t been seen in the dugout since.

season with 40 points following Coventry’s great escape act. Reid stayed in his

before finally returning to the Premier League in 1999. Consecutive 
seventh-placed finishes cemented their top-flight status but Reid was 
eventually sacked in 2002 after nearly eight years at the club. His most recent

Having finished just two points behind Arsenal the previous season, Spurs 
supporters hoped that this could be the year they could claim bragging rights 
in north London. It didn’t turn out that way, however, with a 3-1 defeat at 
Highbury in November beginning Wenger’s hegemony. They ended up 10th and 
Francis was gone a few months later, to be replaced by Tottenham’s own version 
of Wenger, the Swiss Christian Gross. A year later, Francis returned to QPR and 
then Bristol Rovers in 2001 but has not held a managerial post since leaving 
six months later, although he been part of the coaching staff at Crystal Palace 
and Stoke, among others.

Redknapp had just embarked on his third season as manager and the arrival of 
imports like Florin Radiciou and Paulo Futre were welcomed at Upton Park. But 
they ended up having to rely on youth team products Rio Ferdinand and the 
manager’s nephew Frank Lampard, who had made his debut against Arsenal on the 
season’s opening day, to survive relegation. Redknapp’s first clash with Wenger 
came in January and resulted in a 2-1 home defeat – the first of 14 Premier 
League victories for the Frenchman over his rival in 29 meetings. Now a TV 
pundit and director of Wimborne Town.

 Newcastle’s star midfielder Yohan Kebab despite being the club’s director of 
football, Kinnear was seen as a rising star in the managerial world. Beaten 3-0 
on the opening day after David Beckham’s wonder goal for Manchester United, 
Wimbledon recovered and went on to reach the semi-finals of both cup 
competitions as well as beating Wenger’s Arsenal at Highbury in February. 
Kinnear stayed with The Dons until March 1999, when he suffered a heart attack 
before a game, and went on to manage Luton and Nottingham Forest before his two 
spells at Newcastle in 2008 and 2013.
