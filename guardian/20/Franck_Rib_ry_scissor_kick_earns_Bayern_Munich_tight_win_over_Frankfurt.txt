Franck Ribéry’s spectacular first-half volley earned Bayern Munich a 1-0 win 
overEintracht Frankfurt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eintrachtfrankfurt> to stretch their 
Bundesliga lead over Borussia Dortmund, who host Werder Bremen on Saturday 
evening.

Ribéry scored with an acrobatic scissor kick in the 20th minute, sending back 
the rebound after Lukas Hradecky saved Mario Götze’s initial effort with his 
foot. Götze, like Ribéry making a rare start owing to injury problems, had run 
at the Frankfurt defence to create the chance. It was Ribéry’s second goal in 
just eight league appearances this season, five as a substitute.

Szabolcs Huszti shot narrowly wide for Frankfurt after the interval, prompting 
a response from Bayern. Xabi Alonso struck the crossbar with a free-kick 
shortly after and was denied by Hradecky in the 65th.

Afterwards, Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said: “When you only score one 
goal, it’s even more important not to concede,” Bayern, who had 21 efforts on 
goal compared with the visitors’ four, moved eight points clear of Borussia 
Dortmund, who host Werder Bremen on Saturday evening.

On Tuesday Bayern host Benfica in the first leg of their Champions League 
quarter-final, and the Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski, who had a quiet game, 
said: “The three points are the most important thing. On Tuesday we’ll have to 
play much, much better.”
