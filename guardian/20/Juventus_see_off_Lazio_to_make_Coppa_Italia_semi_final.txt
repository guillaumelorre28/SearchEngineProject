The Coppa Italia holders, Juventus, reached the semi-finals of this year’s 
competition on Wednesday with a 1-0 win over Lazio, the team they beat in last 
season’s final. Full-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, who spent three seasons at 
Lazio before joiningJuventus <https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus>, 
scored the only goal in the 66th minute as his side continued their excellent 
recent form.

After a slow start to the season, Juventus have won their last 10 Serie A 
games to put them second in the table and back in the hunt for a fifth 
successive league title. They have also reached the last 16 of the Champions 
League. Juve, who thumped neighbours Torino 4-0 in the previous round, will 
face old rivals Internazionale in a two-legged semi-final.

Lichtsteiner snapped up a rebound and the ball crossed the line before Lazio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lazio> goalkeeper Etrit Berisha could 
clear it, after Simone Zaza’s shot had hit the post.

Zaza was fielded alongside Álvaro Morata in a second-choice front line as the 
coach, Massimiliano Allegri, rested Paulo Dybala and Mario Mandzukic.

“I don’t like to use the word rotation because we have a competitive squad of 
an excellent standard,” Allegri said.

“Today, I would like to compliment Stefano Sturaro, Zaza and Morata, who has 
improved a great deal, and Martín Cáceres, who contained Keita Baldé. They all 
played a good match. It’s difficult to leave anyone out.”
