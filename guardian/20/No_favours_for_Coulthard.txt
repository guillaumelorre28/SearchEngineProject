David Coulthard knows better than to ask the McLaren-Mercedes management to 
throw their entire efforts behind his attempt on the world championship after 
his team-mate Mika Hakkinen's bitterly disappointing retirement from Sunday's 
Spanish grand prix when almost within sight of the chequered flag.

The Scot, who finished fifth after stalling on the grid and getting involved 
in a first-corner collision, is widely regarded as the onlyMcLaren 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mclaren> driver to have a realistic chance 
of the title. Yet the team will not require Hakkinen to play a subservient role 
until his own chances are effectively extinguished.

"In principle we will not ask one driver to drive in a supporting role to the 
other until he has no chance of winning the title," said Martin Whitmarsh, the 
McLaren managing director, yesterday.

"However, I think when you get to the point where, to all intents and 
purposes, our second driver in the championship placings has no longer got a 
reasonable chance, then we will obviously call team orders."

If Coulthard stays ahead, he will eventually get the same level of support 
from Hakkinen as he himself provided in 1998 and '99 when he rode shotgun to 
the Finn in the closing races of the season after his own chances of the title 
had faded away.

For the moment this means putting aside the fact that Michael Schumacher's 36 
points put him eight ahead of Coulthard. Although Hakkinen is 32 points down on 
the Ferrari driver, which means he has to win at least three races without 
Schumacher scoring a point toget within striking distance, with 12 of the 
season's 17 races to go there is plenty of time for things to change.

That also means, therefore, that Coulthard may have to wait some time before 
he is given the sort of priority treatment enjoyed by Schumacher at Ferrari.

Schumacher's contract with the Italian team gives him absolute priority status 
as team leader, even though his proven superiority over first Eddie Irvine and 
now Rubens Barrichello means he has seldom needed to pull rank in any obtrusive 
fashion.

Â• The crash that killed the Italian Michele Alboreto was caused by a damaged 
tyre, the Audi car company said yesterday. Alboreto, 44, was killed last 
Wednesday on the Euro-Speedway circuit at Lausitz, Germany, at the wheel of an 
Audi R8 that he was testing for the Le Mans 24-hour race.
