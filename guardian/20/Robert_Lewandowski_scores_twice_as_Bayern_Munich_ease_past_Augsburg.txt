Lewandowski had not scored in his previous five league games but ended his 
mini-drought after 19 minutes when he finished off a counter-attack set up by 
Arjen Robben, who himself added the second two minutes later.

Lewandowski struck again three minutes after halftime and Koo Ja-cheol pulled 
one back after a Bayern defensive lapse.

Bayern, who have 23 points, and RB Leipzig, who are two points behind, 
remained unbeaten after the first nine games of the season. RB Leipzig, in 
their first season in the top flight, won 2-0 at Darmstadt.
