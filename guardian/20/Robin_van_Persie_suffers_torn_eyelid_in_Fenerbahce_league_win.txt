having taken a blow to the eye in a seemingly innocuous collision with an 
opponent.

 to show blood coming from Van Persie’s heavily bandaged left eye but a club 
statement said the situation was much less serious than feared.

“He received a blow to the eye and suffered a torn eyelid and bleeding,” the 
club doctor, Burak Kunduraciogl, said. “After the first intervention we sent an 
ophthalmologist to the hospital to assess him. After the investigations we 
learned that nothing important happened. His condition is good.”
