Fábio da Silva could move on loan to the Bundesliga club Freiburg from 
Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
until the end of the season.

Discussions are at an advanced stage and David Moyes is content to allow the 
left-back to leave as the United manager has Alexander Büttner as cover for 
Patrice Evra in the position.

Moyes's willingness to allow Fábio to depart also underlines that hopes remain 
regarding a temporary move for Fábio Coentrão, the Real Madrid left-back, 
despite resistance from the Spanish club.

Fábio da Silva has managed three appearances this season, with the most recent 
lasting only four minutes after the Brazilian was sent off having come one as 
76th-minute replacement in the2-1 FA Cup defeat to Swansea City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/05/wilfried-bony-swansea-fa-cup-victory-manchester-united>
 at Old Trafford on 5 January.

Freiburg are 16th in the Bundesliga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball>, occupying a place 
that at the end of the season would entail a play-off against a side seeking 
promotion.
