League One side Doncaster Rovers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/doncaster> now have a celebrity owner 
after a takeover by the former chairman John Ryan and the One Direction singer 
Louis Tomlinson was confirmed.

A spokesman for Ryan said the deal had been completed and there will be a 
formal announcement in London.

The 21-year-old Tomlinson is a lifelong fan of his hometown club. He played 
for their reserve side this year

, watched by a crowd of almost 10,000, and had been close to a takeover before, 
but a move was twice delayed because of negotiations over his image rights.

Ryan, who ended his 15-year association with Rovers in November, will be the 
lesser known of the two men but will doubtless be the more hands-on. His 
spokesman said: “It’s done, the takeover is complete.”

The businessman has extensive football experience and oversaw Doncaster’s rise 
from non-league to the Championship, as well as their move from Belle Vue to 
the Keepmoat Stadium, before stepping aside in November.

The earlier snag came about because Tomlinson’s image rights are owned by his 
management team and would entitle them to a share of any money generated by the 
club through merchandise and extra ticket sales from the use of his image or 
name.

While Tomlinson signed as a player last season in a move to make money for the 
Bluebell Wood charity, Ryan has also played for Doncaster, bringing himself on 
as a substitute, then aged 52, in a 4-2 win against Hereford after the club had 
sealed promotion from the Conference in 2003.
