I rescued a ponytail palm that had several growing points at the top of the 
trunk, but only one had leaves. This is flourishing, but the others remain 
leafless and dead-looking. The plant seems healthy overall, but it looks 
lopsided. What can I do?

One side is flourishing, which is a great sign. The simplest trick would be to 
cut off the top just below the good growth. Seal with wax if you can and wait 
several weeks, making sure that the plant doesn’t dry out completely around the 
base, but keeping watering to the bare minimum. I’ll bet good money that new 
growth will then appear evenly around the top of the plant.

Ask Alys Fowler: what can I do about a dying privet hedge?

Ponytail palms (Beaucarnea recurvata) are multiheaded because someone pruned 
them in the nursery to promote bushy growth. You’ll do the same when you hack 
the head off (you may need to use a saw to do this cleanly).

You can take a gamble that the healthy part of the top you cut off will 
re-root if you pot it up. This can be a slow process and the leaves may die 
back, but it often works. A little rooting hormone wouldn’t go amiss. Don’t let 
it dry out, but don’t overwater or it will rot. Good luck.
