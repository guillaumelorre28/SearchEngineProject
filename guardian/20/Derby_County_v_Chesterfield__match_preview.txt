A Derbyshire derby between the county’s two long-serving League clubs is a 
rare thing indeed – this is the first meeting of the sides separated by 21 
miles for 29 years, and they have not been paired together in theFA Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup> since 1948. Spireites supporters 
will be encouraged by the news that Steve McClaren is likely to rotate his 
squad with promotion his priority. Paul Cook’s team are going well in League 
One, however, and victory would rekindle talk of their 1997 semi-final heroics.
