.

With the game goalless in injury time, Doncaster’s Harry Forrester 
accidentally lobbed Christian Walton from 40 yards when attempting to give the 
ball back to theBury <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bury> goalkeeper 
following an injury. Dickov ordered his players to allow Bury’s Leon Clarke to 
walk through unchallenged from kick-off to score an equaliser.

“Every club manager wants to begin the new season with three points, so for 
Paul to focus on the game’s best interests at a moment of intense pressure is 
something that deserves this special recognition,” said theFootball League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league> chief executive, Shaun 
Harvey.

Dickov said: “I’m actually a little bit embarrassed by all the plaudits to be 
honest. I think any other manager in my position would have done the same 
thing. One thing we have here at Doncaster within football is a really good 
name and it was important to keep that.

“The reaction it’s had has been absolutely fantastic, especially with coverage 
coming from all over the world. People have been very supportive and if 
anything, it’s raised the profile of the ethos of this club which is great for 
everyone. But away from all that, I firmly believe it was the right thing to 
do.”
