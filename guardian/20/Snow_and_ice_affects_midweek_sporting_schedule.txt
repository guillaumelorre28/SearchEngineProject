Four midweek matches have been postponed by the Scottish Football League as a 
result of the snow which has covered much of the country.

The SFL programme was postponed due to the refereeing crisis last weekend and 
now the weather has intervened, with tomorrow night's first division clashes 
between Cowdenbeath and Dunfermline and Raith Rovers and Dundee postponed.

The second division contest between Dumbarton and Alloa has also fallen victim 
to the weather, as has the third division fixture between Clyde and Queen's 
Park.

The matches at Cowdenbeath, Dumbarton and Clyde have been rescheduled for 7 
December, but a new date for the Raith Rovers fixture is still to be confirmed.

Yesterday's Premier League match between Dundee United and Rangers was also 
postponed because of the weather.
