Sam Allardyce, after winning one point from his first two games in charge of 
Crystal Palace <https://www.theguardian.com/football/crystalpalace>, has called 
for the Premier League fixture organiser to be “sacked”.

The former England manager, who left his position with the national team after 
only one match following an undercover newspaper investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-leaves-england-manager-role-fa>
, is now pointing the finger at fixture congestion.

Yohan Cabaye, Christian Benteke and Andros Townsend were all substituted by 
Allardycewith Palace losing 2-0 at Arsenal on Sunday afternoon

 as the manager began to turn his attention to Tuesday’s home game with the 
bottom side Swansea City.

“We’ve been dealt the blow of not having enough recovery time between now and 
Tuesday night, why can’t we play Wednesday?” asked Allardyce. “I don’t know who 
does the fixtures but he needs sacking really.

“Swansea played yesterday, have 24 hours on us. They’re such big games with so 
much at stake, you want a fair crack at it, and it’s unfair when you’re playing 
[Sunday] and Tuesday night. I was disappointed in our first-half performance 
[against Arsenal].

“We gave much too good possession away. None more so than the [Giroud] goal. 
That was simple possession given away on one of our attacks in the first half.
It was a brilliant piece of skill

, how he took the goal, but our passing wasn’t good enough.”

Allardyce is now looking to the transfer window to help out his Palace squad. 
“Two things [need] to happen for the team to get better and produce more 
results: get the team fitter and buy players in. Two if possible, three if the 
finances will allow,” he said. “I want to lift the squad. It lifted the whole 
place last year at Sunderland.”
