In her acceptance speech for the Golden Globes Cecil B DeMille lifetime

Trump initially spoke to the New York Times on the phone, deriding Streep as a 
“Hillary lover” and denying he had mocked Kovaleski. “People keep saying I 
intended to mock the reporter’s disability, as ifMeryl Streep 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep> and others could read my mind, 
and I did no such thing.”

The president-elect followed up with a series of tweets on Monday in which he 
wrote: “Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, 
doesn’t know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a Hillary 
flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never “mocked” a disabled reporter 
(would never do that) but simply showed him “groveling” when he totally changed 
a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more 
very dishonest media!”

Trump’s response was widely anticipated, with comedian Dana Schwartz among 
those to accurately predict Trump’s choice of words,tweeting several hours 
beforehand: 
<https://twitter.com/DanaSchwartzzz/status/818295430203068417?lang=en> “Can’t 
wait for Donald Trump to tweet about how Meryl Streep is overrated.”
