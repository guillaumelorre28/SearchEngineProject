In a wide-ranging cover feature for Architectural Digest (At Home with Marc 
Jacobs and Neville, his Insta-Famous Bull Terrier 
<http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/marc-jacobs-new-york-city-house>), 
the designer <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/marc-jacobs> has invited the 
world to share the joys of his New York city abode. There’s a gianttoad seat 
and lily pad table set 
<http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/marc-jacobs-new-york-city-house#11> 
for the garden, artwork from the likes ofRichard Prince 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/04/richard-prince-sued-copyright-infringement-rastafarian-instagram>
, Ellsworth Kelly and Gerhard Richter, and acres of cream carpets miraculously 
free of paw prints from Neville. But what lessons can fashion civilians learn 
from this master of interiors?

paintings of your other best friends: who’ll be next to be immortalised with 
wall-portrait status? In this guest room, for example, Jacobs has an Elizabeth 
Peyton portrait of museSofia Coppola

Looking to do a tight edit on your wardrobe, shoe and or soft toy collection 
and still present it in a way that says, “I like living in hotels”? Mahogany 
closets can set things off.

Nothing sets off a marble tub like a Eugène Printz ceiling light, 
19th-century urns on lacquer cabinets,Urban Archaeology 
<http://www.urbanarchaeology.com/> sink mirrors or a gilded biomorphic mirror 
from Antoni Gaudí. What’s the take-home message here? Hang a set of old 
mirrors opposite each other to really give bath time that infinity and beyond 
feel.

Look at that climbing!! #SaturdayontheroofwithHediandNeville @nevillejacobs

Of course, as anyone who follows either Marc Jacobs 
<https://www.instagram.com/themarcjacobs/?hl=en> or his dog Neville 
<https://www.instagram.com/nevillejacobs/> on Instagram knows, it is not the 
first time Jacobs has opened his home to the world. Nothing says “at home with” 
like a set of outdoor cushions that complement your dog’s colouring.
