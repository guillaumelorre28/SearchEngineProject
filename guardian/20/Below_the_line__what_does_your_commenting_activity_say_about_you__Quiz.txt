When it comes to online media, what is your commenting style, and what does 
your ‘below the line’ activity say about you? Do you mainly (a) debate issues 
that matter to you, (b) chat with others, (c) make new friends, or (d) troll 
other users?

Your answers, particularly if you confessed to (d), say a lot about your 
personality. A recent Canadian study put this question to 1,000 brave 
volunteers. All were dedicated internet commenters who spent, on average, over 
an hour a day in various online comments sections. Around 6% of respondents 
selected trolling as their favourite activity. The study found that these 
self-confessed trolls tended to score more highly on measures of extraversion 
and, unsurprisingly, lower on agreeableness (though they did not differ from 
non-trolls on conscientiousness, neuroticism or openness).

More worryingly, trolls scored higher than non-trolls on measures of the 
so-called “dark tetrad” of personality: machiavellianism (the tendency to 
manipulate others), narcissism (excessive self-esteem), sadism (the enjoyment 
of inflicting pain on others) and psychopathy (characterised by selfishness and 
a lack of empathy and remorse). Ouch!

This leaves just one mystery: Does “troll” (in this sense) rhyme with “roll” 
or “doll”. If you’re reading online, answers in the comments please. But play 
nice.
