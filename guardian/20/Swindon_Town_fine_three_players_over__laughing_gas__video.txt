 that the three have been fined an unspecified sum.

A statement read: “Swindon Town can confirm that the internal investigation 
into the recent conduct of Drissa Traoré, Jeremy Balmy and Brandon 
Ormonde-Ottewill has now concluded and a disciplinary meeting has taken place. 
The three first-team players have been fined by the football club for their 
actions.”

The players, who admitted wrongdoing and apologised to their team-mates, will 
be available to play again this weekend at home to Chesterfield.

The statement added: “The trio acknowledge that their actions were wrong and 
would like to apologise to their team-mates, the club’s staff and the 
supporters. They are keen to move on from this issue and get back to training 
to help the team as quickly as possible. All three will be considered for 
selection once again this weekend. Swindon Town now consider this matter to be 
closed and will be making no further comment.”
