This works as well in a jug to serve a crowd as in a glass for one; just 
multiply the quantities accordingly. It’s all but guaranteed to release your 
inner dancehall queen. Serves one.

50ml Wray & Nephew overproofed Jamaican rum
50ml orange juice
50ml pineapple juice
25ml grenadine
15ml fresh lime juice
Pineapple wedge and mint, to garnish

Put all the liquids in a shaker with some ice and hard shake. Pour into 
a hurricane or highball glass filled with fresh ice and garnish.
