Chelsea have a difficult away tie at Everton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> in the only confirmed 
all-Premier League tie in the FA Cup sixth round.

Guus Hiddink’s side sent Manchester City crashing out with a 5-1 win at 
Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Hiddink won the FA Cup in 2009 withChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> but faces a tough trip to 
Goodison Park as he searches for a repeat triumph.

The winners of the fifth-round tie between Shrewsbury Town and Manchester 
United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united>, who play on 
Monday, will face West Ham at home. West Ham, who beat Blackburn Rovers 5-1 on 
Sunday, last won the Cup in 1980, their most recent major trophy, and their 
manager, Slaven Bilic, has openly prioritised the competition this season.

The only replay of the round thus far will take place on 8 March when Arsenal 
travel toHull City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity> after their 
0-0 draw at the Emirates on Saturday. The victors will have a home tie against 
Watford, who scraped past Leeds thanks to a calamitous Scott Wootton own goal.

Fresh from beating Premier League opposition at home on Saturday, Reading will 
welcomeCrystal Palace <https://www.theguardian.com/football/crystalpalace> to 
the Madejski Stadium as they attempt to reach the semi-finals at Wembley.
