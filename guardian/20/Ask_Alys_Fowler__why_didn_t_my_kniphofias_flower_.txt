I planted three yellow  <mailto:askalys@theguardian.com>kniphofia

this year; none flowered. One grew quite big, with lots of leaves but no sign 
of buds. My soil is clay but I added compost and grit to improve the drainage. 
They get sun for about half of the day.

Be patient. You have decided to put sun-loving plants in a moderately sunny 
place; they are either just getting used to their home or sulking a bit. Either 
way they’ll settle in. Lots of leaves is a good sign: it means the plant is 
putting down roots. If the other two don’t start to show signs of healthy 
growth next year, consider moving them to somewhere with more sun.

Ask Alys: will my amaryllis flower again?

Once kniphofias (red-hot pokers) get comfortable, they are robust, easygoing 
plants, but think of it this way: if you wanted to go to Greece to lie on the 
beach and someone offered you the Hebrides, pointing out that both had white 
sand and turquoise waters, you might be a bit miffed. Once you’d found some 
good wellington boots, though, and realised the beaches of the Hebrides are 
just as lovely as the Aegean’s, you’d settle in. But I will say this: afternoon 
sun is stronger than morning; if they are sitting in gloom all afternoon, they 
may sulk for ever.
