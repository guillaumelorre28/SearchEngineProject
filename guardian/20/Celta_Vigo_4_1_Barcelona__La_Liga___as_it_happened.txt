A quick review of today’s goals. Celta struck twice in a five-minute span 
during the first goal, staking a 2-0 lead on a gorgeous26th-minute goal by 
Nolito <https://streamable.com/o00b> and a 30th-minute tally by Iago Aspas 
<https://streamable.com/o00b> (thanks in no small part to a ghastly error by 
Pique). A second byAspas in the 56th minute <https://streamable.com/40p0> made 
it 3-0. Barca pulled one back whenNeymar finally broke through in the 80th 
<https://streamable.com/aa9i>, but Guidetti’s emphatic response two minutes 
later <https://streamable.com/ymcz> closed the scoring on a famous Celta 
victory.

And it’s over! Celta Vigo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo>

skids wide of the far post.

GOAL! Celta Vigo 3-0 Barcelona (Iago Aspas, 56 min)

Unbelievable! Celta with a lightning-fast counter-attack keyed by Molito, who 
directs a long pass downfield to Aspas, who speeds past Alves and has nothing 
but green and Ter Stegen between him and the goal. He runs 25 yards unmolested 
before chipping it above and to the left of Ter Stegen to give the hosts a 3-0 
lead. Another clear breakaway. An absolute stunner.
 Aspas makes it 3-0 for the hosts.

54 min: Alves draws a foul and Barca have a free kick from a dangerous area. 
It’s sent into the area, where Pique very nearly heads it into the goal – but 
is denied by the crossbar again.

53 min: Iniesta deep into the area with a lateral pass to Suarez, whose shot 
from close range and beats Sergio but smacks off the post. The rebound falls to

Penny for your thoughts? Here’s some #analysis from the only voices that 
matter: you.

Conor Murphy checks in, via email.

With Aspas and Balotelli, 2 of the biggest flops in recent Liverpool history 
scoring with aplomb in Europe, perhaps Brendan Rodgers’ [fate] is being sealed 
as much on the fields of Udine and Vigo as anywhere in England.

And a burning question from Matt Loten, also via email. 

So, is this relatively uninspiring opening to the season from Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> down to an inevitable 
staleness brought on by the transfer ban? Or does the blame lie with Enrique 
and his apparent inability to get the best out of his front three, and 
insistence on rotating his squad, despite the fact that the likes of Sergi 
Roberto are quite simply not up to scratch?

What say ye, faithful readers?

Half-time: Celta Vigo 2-0 Barcelona

A strangely disinterested Barcelona find themselves down two goals and in 
grave danger of seeing their 100% start to the season go down the tubes. Can
Celta Vigo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> land the plane or 
will the second half see an inspired comeback?

43 min: Celta have completed 190 of 301 passes (63.1%), compared to 222 of 320 
(69.4%) for Barca. Yet it’s the hosts who have indisputably put on a 
footballing clinic here in the first half.

40 min: A corner to Barca, taken by Messi and played short. Neymar pirouettes 
with the ball on the right edge of the era before passing to Messi, who passes 
to Iniesta, then back to Messi and through to Neymar, who’s hair-trigger shot 
is deflected out by a defender for another corner.

GOAL! Celta Vigo 2-0 Barcelona (Iago Aspas, 30 min)

A hideous giveaway by Pique at midfield gives possession to Iago Aspas, who 
has a clear breakway with both of Barca’s central midfielders in his wake. At 
the edge of the area he chips Ter Stegen and Celta are two goals up.
 Iago Aspas doubles Celta’s pleasure.

GOAL! Celta Vigo 1-0 Barcelona (Nolito, 26 min)

What a goal from Nolito, the former Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> reserve player showing the big 
club what they’ve been missing. A long cross across the pitch with acres of 
space. He takes a beat before uncorking a right-footed shot to the far post 
that grazes Ter Stegen’s outstretched arm before caroming off the post into the 
net. Nolito’s fifth of the season puts the hosts out in front.
 Nolito opens the scoring for Celta Vigo.

11 min: The first touch of the match for Messi – conspicuously quiet thus far

Sergio turns away with a lunging save. Moments later a corner to Barca that’s 
taken by Suarez but easily cleared.

9 min: Another half-chance by Celta as they work it up the left flank and the 
ball is sent across the face of the goal toward the top of the area, where it’s 
met by Aspas and he puts a shot toward the general direction of the goal. It 
skids wide right, no problem for Ter Stegen.

7 min: Celta win the match’s first corner. It’s sent to a cluster of players 
at the far post. The whistle sounds and the home fans swell, but it’s not the 
penalty they hope for: Orellana is ruled offside.

2 min: An early chance for Celta as they fortuitously break the offside trap 
but Iago Aspas carrying into the left edge of the area crosses to nobody rather 
than having an attempt on goal.

Welcome to today’s meeting between Celta Vigo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> and Barcelona. An early-season 
showdown between La Liga unbeatens is in store as Barcelona look to remain 
perfect through five matches against a Celta side that’s also yet to lose this 
season, picking up 10 of a possible 12 points in the league. As we wait for the 
sides to emerge from the tunnel at Balaídos roughly a half hour from now, 
here’s a look at Luis Enrique’s pre-match press conference from Tuesday.

That’s all for now. With today’s result Celta Vigo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo>, at least temporarily, move 
top of the La Liga table. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to 
check back later for a full match report.
 
A quick review of today’s goals. Celta struck twice in a five-minute span 
during the first goal, staking a 2-0 lead on a gorgeous26th-minute goal by 
Nolito <https://streamable.com/o00b> and a 30th-minute tally by Iago Aspas 
<https://streamable.com/o00b> (thanks in no small part to a ghastly error by 
Pique). A second byAspas in the 56th minute <https://streamable.com/40p0> made 
it 3-0. Barca pulled one back whenNeymar finally broke through in the 80th 
<https://streamable.com/aa9i>, but Guidetti’s emphatic response two minutes 
later <https://streamable.com/ymcz> closed the scoring on a famous Celta 
victory.
 
And it’s over! Celta Vigo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> 
remain unbeaten in La Liga while Barcelona’s 100% start to the season is but a 
memory. The 4-1 scoreline marks Luis Enrique’s worst defeat at the helm of the 
Catalan side.
 
90 min+1: Muir wins a free kick on a foul by Sergi Gómez, but Messi’s free 
kick sails over the crossbar.
 
90 min: The fourth official signals for two minutes of stoppage time. Absolute 
euphoria among the home fans at Balaídos.
 
88 min: Sergio turns away yet another shot by Messi, who was set up nicely by 
Neymar’s pacy run and pass.
 
85 min: Planas, another former Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> B player, on for Celta in 
place of Wass, who’s played quite well today.
 
And just like that Barca’s comeback hopes are dashed. John Guidetti slips into 
the area into shocking acres of space. The right back Mallo having pushed ahead 
fires a pass into the former Manchester City striker, who calmly deposits it 
into the net.
 Guidetti restores Celta’s three-goal lead.  
And Barcelona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> are on the 
board as Neymar pulls one back with a shrewdly angled shot to beat Sergio on an 
assist by Messi.
 Neymar pulls one back for floundering Barcelona.  
79 min: Mathieu with a foul on Orellana. Moments later Mallo shown yellow.
 
77 min: Rakitic floats in a cross and Dani Alves gets behind the defense but 
he sends a header over the bar. A second change for the Celta as Giudetti 
enters for Aspas.
 
76 min: Suarez crashes to the pitch after absorbing a sneaky blow to the 
kidney from Sergi Gómez in an attempt to bring it to the referee’s attention. 
It works as the defender is shown yellow. Now a change for the hosts as Pablo 
Hernández comes on for Radoja.
 
73 min: Barcelona now pressing forward but can’t make the final pass to crack 
Celta’s well organized defense. Messi attempts a through ball into the final 
third but it’s intercepted and booted back toward midfield. And Barca will 
start again ...
 
71 min: Aspas receives a pass at the top of the area, takes a wide turn past 
his defender and fires a right-footed shot that’s turned away by Ter Stegen.
 
68 min: The teams exchange possession in midfield as the pace seems to have 
slowed, a notch off the back-and-forth action that marked the opening stages of 
the second half.
 
65 min: Barca with a positive sub as Ivan Rakitic enters for Busquets.
 
63 min: Neymar’s shot near the right edge of the area is turned away by 
Sergio, who’s been up to the task all day. (Meanwhile, Karim Benzema has just 
put Real Madrid ahead 1-0 at Athletic Bilbao.)
 
61 min: Nolito very nearly makes it 4-0 to Celta! Yet his angled shot just 
skids wide of the far post.
 
58 min: A Neymar header misses the target.
 
57 min: First sub of the match as Barcelona’s Munir is on for Munir replaces 
Sergi Roberto.
 
Unbelievable! Celta with a lightning-fast counter-attack keyed by Molito, who 
directs a long pass downfield to Aspas, who speeds past Alves and has nothing 
but green and Ter Stegen between him and the goal. He runs 25 yards unmolested 
before chipping it above and to the left of Ter Stegen to give the hosts a 3-0 
lead. Another clear breakaway. An absolute stunner.
 Aspas makes it 3-0 for the hosts.  
55 min: Another shot by Messi turned away by Sergio. Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> seem to be licking their chops 
here, primed for the opener.
 
54 min: Alves draws a foul and Barca have a free kick from a dangerous area. 
It’s sent into the area, where Pique very nearly heads it into the goal – but 
is denied by the crossbar again.
 
53 min: Iniesta deep into the area with a lateral pass to Suarez, whose shot 
from close range and beats Sergio but smacks off the post. The rebound falls to 
Messi, but he can’t put it on goal. Another fine chance for Barca just missed.
 
51 min: Another dreadful defensive giveaway by Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona>, this one by Busquets, results 
in an Iago Aspas breakaway. This time he shoots wide.
 
48 min: A Neymar shot from inside the area sails over the crossbar.
 
46 min: And we’re underway in the second half as Barca kick off. No changes 
for either side. Bear in mind Barca have four wins in fourLa Liga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/laligafootball> matches with none of 
their eight goals coming before the 50th minute.
 
More reader feedback. Here’s a note from Kevin Porter, via email.

Hi Bryan,

Elsewhere in Europe this evening Hatim Ben Arfa has bagged two for Nice in a 
6-1 pounding of Bordeaux.

Watch Ben Arfa’s second below – and cue the Benny Hill theme 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK6TXMsvgQg>.
 Ben Arfa bags a brace against Bordeaux.  
Penny for your thoughts? Here’s some #analysis from the only voices that 
matter: you.

Conor Murphy checks in, via email.

With Aspas and Balotelli, 2 of the biggest flops in recent Liverpool history 
scoring with aplomb in Europe, perhaps Brendan Rodgers’ [fate] is being sealed 
as much on the fields of Udine and Vigo as anywhere in England.

And a burning question from Matt Loten, also via email. 

So, is this relatively uninspiring opening to the season from Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> down to an inevitable 
staleness brought on by the transfer ban? Or does the blame lie with Enrique 
and his apparent inability to get the best out of his front three, and 
insistence on rotating his squad, despite the fact that the likes of Sergi 
Roberto are quite simply not up to scratch?

What say ye, faithful readers?
 
A strangely disinterested Barcelona find themselves down two goals and in 
grave danger of seeing their 100% start to the season go down the tubes. Can
Celta Vigo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> land the plane or 
will the second half see an inspired comeback?
 
45 min: Now it’s the full-back Hugo Mallo who haves a go at goal from outside 
the area. It sails wide right but speaks to the all-out attackCelta Vigo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/celtavigo> have imposed on the defending 
champions.
 
43 min: Celta have completed 190 of 301 passes (63.1%), compared to 222 of 320 
(69.4%) for Barca. Yet it’s the hosts who have indisputably put on a 
footballing clinic here in the first half.
 
41 min: Barca threatening here, but Celta’s well drilled defense close in and 
clear the ball past midfield.
 
40 min: A corner to Barca, taken by Messi and played short. Neymar pirouettes 
with the ball on the right edge of the era before passing to Messi, who passes 
to Iniesta, then back to Messi and through to Neymar, who’s hair-trigger shot 
is deflected out by a defender for another corner.
 
37 min: Messi’s free kick sails into the area where it’s easily saved by 
Sergio. Lots of two-way contact in the box ignored by the referee.
 
36 min: Suarez draws a ‘foul’ – the replay confirms it was of the phantom 
variety – and Barca will have a free kick about 30 yards from goal.
 
33 min: An interesting fact as Barca look to rebound from a nightmarish start.
Infostrada Sports (@InfostradaLive) 
Barça are trailing 2-0 in La Liga within 30 min for first time since beating 
Getafe 5-2 in Dec 2013.#fcblive <https://twitter.com/hashtag/fcblive?src=hash> 
#CeltaFCB <https://twitter.com/hashtag/CeltaFCB?src=hash>
 <https://twitter.com/InfostradaLive/status/646754790710636544> September 23, 
2015 <https://twitter.com/InfostradaLive/status/646754790710636544>  
A hideous giveaway by Pique at midfield gives possession to Iago Aspas, who 
has a clear breakway with both of Barca’s central midfielders in his wake. At 
the edge of the area he chips Ter Stegen and Celta are two goals up.
 Iago Aspas doubles Celta’s pleasure.  
What a goal from Nolito, the former Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> reserve player showing the big 
club what they’ve been missing. A long cross across the pitch with acres of 
space. He takes a beat before uncorking a right-footed shot to the far post 
that grazes Ter Stegen’s outstretched arm before caroming off the post into the 
net. Nolito’s fifth of the season puts the hosts out in front.
 Nolito opens the scoring for Celta Vigo.  
23 min: Busquets shown yellow for a clattering challenge on Nolito. Tactically 
smart with Celta on the attack.
 
22 min: Iniesta, also atypically invisible today, plays through to Alves, 
whose pass to Messi results in a deflected shot and a corner to Barca.
 
21 min: Orellana hacked down while attacking down the right flank and whistles 
fill the stadium but the foul is not given.
 
20 min: Well-worked interplay between Messi and Neymar as Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> threaten, but the attack is 
snuffed out in the area by a gaggle of Celta defenders.
 
19 min: The Celta corner is easily corralled by Ter Stegen. Now Barca will 
look to build up from the back.
 
18 min: Nolito with a nifty ball through Aspas up the left flank. He puts it 
on goal but it caroms off aBarcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> defender. Corner to Celta.
 
15 min: Another half-chance for Celta as Orellana tries to play around 
Mathieu, but it goes past the line for a goal kick. Moments later a quick Barca 
counter-attack results in a Neymar shot that’s saved by Sergio. Another corner 
to the visitors.
 
13 min: The pace slows a bit. Iniesta draws a foul near the the middle of the 
pitch.
 
11 min: The first touch of the match for Messi – conspicuously quiet thus far 
– comes early in the 11th minute and it’s a thudding right-footed shot that 
Sergio turns away with a lunging save. Moments later a corner to Barca that’s 
taken by Suarez but easily cleared.
 
9 min: Another half-chance by Celta as they work it up the left flank and the 
ball is sent across the face of the goal toward the top of the area, where it’s 
met by Aspas and he puts a shot toward the general direction of the goal. It 
skids wide right, no problem for Ter Stegen.
 
7 min: Celta win the match’s first corner. It’s sent to a cluster of players 
at the far post. The whistle sounds and the home fans swell, but it’s not the 
penalty they hope for: Orellana is ruled offside.
 
5 min: Cheeky run by Nolito into the box: he nutmegs Dani Alves but can’t 
manage a clean attempt on goal. Celta really pressuring Barca in the early 
stages.
 
4 min: Long cross forward to Nolito, the former Barca man, but he can move it 
forward into the final third and is dispossessed.Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> strangely passive here early, 
though Celta have yet to take full advantage.
 
2 min: An early chance for Celta as they fortuitously break the offside trap 
but Iago Aspas carrying into the left edge of the area crosses to nobody rather 
than having an attempt on goal.
 
1 min: And we’re off. Celta attacking from right to left in traditional home 
kits, Barca from left to right in yellow shirts and blue shorts. The hosts with 
possession early and looking to build up from the back.
 
The players have taken the pitch. Should be underway in the next minute or two.
 
Here’s a look at today’s teams.

Celta Vigo XI <https://twitter.com/rccelta_oficial/status/646735681688064000>:
