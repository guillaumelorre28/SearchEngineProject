The Conservatives <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> will 
end subsidies to onshore windfarms from 1 April 2016, a year earlier than set 
out in the previous Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition agreement.

There will be a grace period for projects that already have planning 
permission,the Department of Energy and Climate Change said 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-onshore-wind-subsidies-protect-investment-and-get-the-best-deal-for-bill-payers>
.

Labour claimed the announcement jeopardises 1,000 wind turbines that are 
awaiting planning permission and cannot make a profit without a government 
subsidy.

The onshore wind industry attacked the move as a costly political 
intervention, while trade body RenewableUK called for an urgent meeting with 
the new energy secretary, Amber Rudd, to discuss the implications of the 
announcement.

Rudd and the communities secretary, Greg Clark, are also to press ahead with 
plans to give local communities – rather than national government – the right 
to veto windfarms.

There will also be two new “planning tests” so that councils can only approve 
windfarms on sites that have been clearly designated as part of a local or 
neighbourhood plan, and where the proposed project has the backing of the local 
community.

The funding for the subsidies comes from the “renewable obligation”, which is 
funded by levies added to household fuel bills.

Rudd said her announcement should not come as a surprise to the industry since 
David Cameron had said the subsidies would be ending early and the change had 
been clearly signalled.

She told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “This cannot come as a surprise to 
the industry. It was alerted by previous Conservative energy ministers and by 
the prime minister.”

She said she was engaged in discussion with the Scottish government, which has 
warned it may seek a judicial review of the decision.

And Rudd insisted the change to the timetable would not mean the government 
could not meet its targets for renewable energy by 2020, saying there were 
enough decisions in the pipeline to ensure such targets were met.

But the European commission warned on Tuesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/16/uk-misses-eus-interim-renewables-target>
 that the UK was set to miss its key EU renewable energy target for 2020, and 
told the government it should review its policies to get back on track.

The Scottish government’s energy minister, Fergus Ewing, has said it is 
irrational to reduce or scrap onshore wind subsidies. He claimed, citing 
figures from Scottish Power, that British consumers could end up paying between 
£2bn and £3bn more in bills. Scotland would be home to 70% of planned future 
windfarms and theEdinburgh government claims it has not been consulted by the 
UK government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/04/scotland-calls-for-consultation-over-windfarm-subsidies>
.

People’s fuel bills will increase directly as a result of this government’s 
actions
Maria McCaffery 
Downing Street dismissed the commission’s warning and denied claims that 
scrapping subsidies could cause bills to rise. “The priority is making sure we 
keep bills down for consumers and families and making sure communities have 
more of a say over what happens in their area,” Cameron’s official spokesman 
said.

Meanwhile, Rudd rejected protests from the industry that she was intervening 
just when it was on the way to maturity. She said solar was just as 
cost-effective and had nearly reached grid parity.

She said: “We have to create a balance between supporting the industry, 
reaching our targets and looking after the taxpayer.” By 2020 she said 
windfarms would provide 10% of the energy the UK needed.

She also confirmed she was content for the Chinese government to invest in new 
nuclear plants in the UK, despite its questionable nuclear safety record. She 
said Chinese investors would be subject to UK nuclear safety regulation 
standards.

Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, said renewable energy investment 
was undermined by the mixed messages of Cameron’s last government, and “sadly 
that looks set to continue”.

“Onshore wind is the cheapest and most developed form of clean energy and 
there are 1,000 projects whose investment plans could be affected by the latest 
moving of the goalposts. Ministers need to make clear which projects exactly 
the grace period will apply to,” Flint said.

In an attempt to show that Cameron was not abandoning the green agenda, the 
Tory 2015 manifesto also agreed to press ahead with an intensification of 
offshore windfarms.

Energy <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy> is a UK government 
responsibility, but Ewing earlier this month wrote to Rudd, saying: “It is 
disappointing that I have not had the opportunity to engage with you on this 
ahead of it being a matter for speculation in the press.

“We have not received any information from your department on the possible 
options you are considering or what analysis has been done to assess the impact 
on projects in Scotland.”

Ewing warned that changing previously agreed subsidies would cause a crisis of 
confidence with business.

His letter said: “Any lack of clarity on the UK government’s intentions has 
the potential to stall a very substantial pipeline of investment in the UK and 
Scotland and dent [our] reputation with developers and inward investors.”

Environmentalists and the wind power industry accused the government of 
attacking the cheapest form of renewable energy, and said the move would send a 
“chilling signal” to investors.

Maria McCaffery, chief executive of RenewableUK, said: “The government’s 
decision to end prematurely financial support for onshore wind sends a chilling 
signal not just to the renewable energy industry, but to all investors right 
across the UK’s infrastructure sectors.

“It means this government is quite prepared to pull the rug from under the 
feet of investors even when this country desperately needs to clean up the way 
we generate electricity at the lowest possible cost – which is onshore wind. 
People’s fuel bills will increase directly as a result of this government’s 
actions.”

RenewableUK also said senior economists in the sector had calculated
that billpayers could end up paying £3bn more because of
commitments to meet binding targets.

Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said pulling “support for [the] 
cheapest low-carbon power” was a fail by the government.

Ed Davey, the Lib Dem former energy and climate change secretary, said 
<https://twitter.com/EdwardJDavey/status/611423986409414656>: “Anti-wind power 
Tories will put up electricity bills, cut green jobs and reduce investment.”

The announcement comes on the same day as the pope is to deliver his 
encyclical on the environment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/pope-calls-for-open-spirit-towards-climate-change-encyclical>
, which, environmentalists hope, will add momentum for a strong climate deal at 
a crunch UN summit in Paris this December.

The Green party’s leader, Natalie Bennett, said: “The government’s plans to 
end subsidies for onshore wind farms are short-sighted and irrational.”

Emma Pinchbeck, head of climate and energy policy at WWF UK, said: “The 
proposed cuts to onshore wind will drive out investment in the cheapest form of 
renewable electricity and put up energy bills.”

She added: “The prime minister is showing leadership on securing a global 
agreement on climate change [in Paris]. The government needs to close the gap 
between this international commitment and their domestic policy decisions if it 
is not to undermine his credibility on the international stage.”
