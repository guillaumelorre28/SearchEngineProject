“This is not the moment to criticise,” insisted the Palermo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/palermo> owner, Maurizio Zamparini, in an 
open letter to supporters last Thursday. It was a curious line to go down for a 
man whose own relentless reprovals had just prompted the club’s manager to quit.

Beppe Iachini had sounded resolute in the wake of a 3-1 defeat by Inter four 
days earlier, stressing his belief that Palermo were improving and had the 
right mentality to avoid relegation. That was before Zamparini went on the 
radio and said precisely the opposite, calling the performance ugly and 
predicting that a similar effort would see the Sicilians lose their next match, 
against Napoli, 5-0.

There followed a private meeting between the pair. Iachini stormed out. He 
took charge of training afterwards, but by the end of the day had handed in his 
resignation. Zamparini told another radio station he was doing everything in 
his power to change Iachini’s mind, but then, in the same breath, accused the 
manager of having a “losing mentality” and “not giving a shit about anything”.

Nobody in Palermo could be surprised by such strident self-contradiction. Over 
the course of his 14 years as owner, Zamparini has earned quite the reputation 
for changing his mind. He has hired and fired managers so frequently that there 
is no longer even a clear consensus on quite how many he has got through.

This season alone, the exact figure could be disputed. The most inclusive 
assessments hold that Palermo have changed managers eight times since the start 
of the campaign. That would be more than Serie A’s other 19 teams put together.

Palermo began with Iachini, swapped him for Davide Ballardini in November, 
then two months later announced that they had replaced the latter figure with 
Guillermo Barros Schelotto. But, despite being publicly named as the new 
manager, the Argentinian never actually held the relevant Uefa licence. And so 
Fabio Viviani, who had been working in the club’s analytics department, was 
asked to sit on the bench as a caretaker.

Viviani lasted a single game in this role, losing 4-0 away at Genoa, before he 
was replaced by Giovanni Bosi, who also took charge of one match before being 
succeeded by Giovanni Tedesco. Three weeks later, Bosi returned – with Tedesco 
relegated to assistant. Then, in February, after Barros Schelotto had abandoned 
hope of navigating Uefa’s bureaucratic hurdles and taken a job with Boca 
Juniors instead, Zamparini recalled Iachini.

All of which brings us up to last week. After Iachini had resigned, Zamparini 
turned to Walter Novellino. Include Barros Schelotto and you could reasonably 
state that Palermo have had seven different managers in as many months – a pair 
of whom enjoyed two separate stints at the helm.

Zamparini, of course, has a different take. “Viviani was already on the 
staff,” he grumbled when the figure – then still at six – was put to him during 
another radio interview last month. “And I never even paid Schelotto …”

No matter how you do the sums, though, they still add up to an ugly mess. 
Without a win in seven matches, Palermo would have fallen into the relegation 
zone before their match against Napoli even kicked off on Sunday if Frosinone 
had won away to Carpi.

As it was, the Canarini lost to a last-minute goal, but the threat was hardly 
extinguished. Palermo remained just a single point clear of 18th-placed 
Frosinone, and now Carpi themselves were only another one further back.

Novellino did his best under the circumstances. In the few short days he had 
working with his team, he installed a new 4-4-2 formation and made sure that 
they did not embarrass themselves on Sunday night at home to Napoli. Instead of 
losing 5-0, as Zamparini had claimed they would do under Iachini, theRosanero 
were beaten 1-0 – the only goal arriving on a Gonzalo Higuaín penalty.

There were some grumbles about that spot-kick, awarded after Sinisa Andelkovic 
had manhandled Raúl Albiol at a corner. Nobody would dispute that an 
infringement took place – indeed, replays suggested this was just one of 
several committed by Palermo defenders on the same action – but the Sicilian 
press observed that Napoli had been guilty of much the same behaviour at the 
other end.

In any case, Novellino did not seem distraught with the outcome. His team had 
offered very little, Palermo’s only real chance arriving at the end of the 
first half, when Pepe Reina pushed away a Franco Vázquez shot that was curling 
in towards the bottom corner. But as the manager was quick to point out, more 
winnable fixtures lie ahead – with Empoli and Chievo up next.

He might yet steer Palermo to safety. They are, after all, still above the 
relegation zone for now, and others ahead of them – most notably Udinese and 
Atalanta – are struggling almost as badly. But even if Novellino does 
ultimately succeed, fans can still reasonably ask how their team wound up in 
such a mess in the first place.

This time last year Palermo were chasing a spot in Europe. Their top scorer, 
Paulo Dybalahas been sold to Juventus since then 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/04/juventus-sign-paulo-dybala-palermo-32m>
, but a fee of €32m (£25m) plus bonuses should have left plenty of scope to 
reinvest.


Palermo did sign a handful of players, but in total they spent less than a 
quarter of what they had brought in. Most aggravating of all to Iachini, 
Zamparini also sold the player who had seemed like Dybala’s natural 
replacement, Andrea Belotti, who had quietly produced a strong goals-to-minutes 
ratio while playing off the bench last season.

Even so, there was something rather sad about Zamparini’s eventual breakdown 
in relations with Iachini. It had appeared, for a time, that this manager might 
finally be the one to teach the owner the value of patience and stability.

Hired by Palermo in September 2013, Iachini had led them to promotion from 
Serie B with a record points tally. By staying at the helm throughout the 
entire season that followed, he became the first manager ever to last through a 
full unbroken campaign under Zamparini in Sicily.

Palermo eventually finished 11th in 2014-15, some way short of that European 
dream but also far away from relegation. And even when Iachini was fired last 
November, Palermo were 15th. Vázquez was one of a number of players to express 
dismay at that decision, describing it as an “enormous injustice”.

Pos Team P GD Pts 
16 Udinese 29 -19 30 
17 Palermo 29 -23 27 
18 Frosinone 29 -26 26 
19 Carpi 29 -19 25 
20 Verona 29 -24 19 
The club’s supporters were largely in accordance. Two days after Iachini’s 
resignation, a group of about 200 showed up outside training demanding that 
Zamparini get lost. His open letter, with its all-in-caps appeals for 
“COLLABORATION”, only served to fan the flames. The same chants were heard 
again, even louder, during Sunday’s match.

And yet, for all this, many fans would also recognise that their club might 
not be where it is today without Zamparini. Since he took over the club in 
2002, Palermo have spent more seasons than not in the top flight, enjoying a 
run of relative success not seen in these parts since the 1950s.

The question that the protesters are asking now, is whether that prize is 
worth the pain of an owner whose endless meddling has the effect of always 
putting himself, rather than their team, in the spotlight, and rarely for 
positive reasons. “Better to be in Serie C [without you],”said one who 
confronted him in the street following his row with Iachini last week 
<http://www.mediagol.it/video/video-conforto-zamparini-tifoso-te-ne-devi-andare-meglio-in-serie-c-che-con-te-in-questo-modoo/>
, “than to stay in Serie A like this.”

Talking points

• The win keeps Napoli nipping at Juventus’s heels at the top of Serie A, 
though thePartenopei cannot have been encouraged to see the champions navigate 
another potentially tricky banana skin. Sassuolo were the last team to beat 
Juve inSerie A <https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball>, and have 
taken points off Napoli, Roma and Fiorentina besides, but never really 
threatened to pull level after falling behind to yet another beautiful Dybala 
goal.

• Another clean sheet for Gigi Buffon means that he has now gone 926 minutes 
without conceding a goal in Serie A. He need last just four minutes of next 
week’s Turin derby to break the Serie A record set by Sebastiano Rossi for 
Milan back in 1993-94.

• Also on a roll right now are Roma, who extended their winning run to eight 
straight games in Serie A. After the debacle in Madrid, Edin Dzeko even proved 
that he can sometimes put a shot on target, though his goal was not half as sexy
as the one that Alessandro Florenzi scored in the second half 
<https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/709351042144542720>. 

• Not a good weekend for Alessandro Costacurta, kicked in the face live on air 
by his Sky Sport co-host Marco Cattaneo during half-time of Inter’s match 
against Bologna. Or was he? The whole incident was subsequently broken down in 
classicmoviola style by the same broadcaster, replays demonstrating that 
Cattaneo had never made contact. Though, if he had, he might have been taking 
revengefor an incident in which Costacurta stood on his foot 
<http://m.sky.it/sport/calcio_italiano/2016/03/13/moviola-cattaneo-costacurta-sky-calcio-show-retroscena>
.

• From 2-0 down to 3-2 winners against Torino, you certainly have to give 
Genoa some credit for their resilience. They very nearly achieved a similar 
comeback in the derby against Sampdoria in January, falling 3-0 behind only to 
eventually have chances to equalise at 3-2.

• Late-breaking news as I prepare to file this, but Stefano Colantuono appears 
to have been fired as manager of Udinese. Even taking that into account, 
Palermo’s eight managerial changes would still exceed every other team in the 
division.

Results: Carpi 2-1 Frosinone, Chievo 0-0 Milan, Empoli 1-1 Sampdoria, 
Fiorentina 1-1 Verona, Genoa 3-2 Torino, Inter 2-1 Bologna, Juventus 1-0 
Sassuolo, Lazio 2-0 Atalanta, Palermo 0-1 Napoli, Udinese 1-2 Roma.
