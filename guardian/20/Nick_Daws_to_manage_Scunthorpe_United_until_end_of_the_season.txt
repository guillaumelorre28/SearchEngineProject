Nick Daws has been appointed the manager of Scunthorpe until the end of the 
season after an impressive spell as the caretaker of theLeague One

Andy Dawson has been named as Daws’ assistant after the pair’s spell together 
included four straight victories and only one defeat after taking over from 
Mark Robins and Ned Kelly in mid-January.

“We’ve seen what they’ve done over the period they’ve been in charge and we 
have been impressed,” said the chairman, Peter Swann.

“They’ve worked very hard and the players are responding to them and we 
thought it was really important we kept that intact and it gives us a chance to 
still reach the play-offs.

“I think as a duo they work very well together. As a club, we need somebody to 
lead the team forward as a manager and between them they are very happy in this 
situation.

“They’re both going to give us everything they’ve got. The football we’ve 
played in recent weeks has been excellent and I can only see that improving.”
