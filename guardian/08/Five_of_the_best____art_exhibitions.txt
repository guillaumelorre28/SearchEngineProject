1 Celts

Edinburgh’s summer has been packed with new art but there may not be anything 
else quite as poignant, strange and memorable as this exhibition of ancient 
wonders. The Celtic world is revealed here as a place of mysterious gods and 
even more mysterious art. Flowing intricate patterns, the green of bronze and 
the misty mountain hops of the prehistoric past create a woozy, dreamlike mood, 
opening windows on ancient Scotland and Europe that you won’t forget.

 George Stubbs’s Two Leopards. 
Nature stares back at you searchingly from the paintings and drawings of 
George Stubbs. This great 18th-century artist set out to understand the natural 
world from the inside out – by dissecting a horse. His original drawings of the 
animal feature in this fine show, along with his sublime painting Horse 
Frightened By A Lion and portraits of a monkey, a moose and a variety of big 
cats. Meticulous, accurate, and yet the spirit of his art is utterly romantic.

 Tate Modern’s Switch House. 
The relaunch of the Tate Modern 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tate-modern> is the art event of the 
summer. The museum’s new wing – the Switch House – expresses the dynamic energy 
of modern art history, from a dark expressionist basement to its Futuristic 
pyramidal heights. It also contains a fair amount of art, with Rachel 
Whiteread’s green resin cast of a wooden floor playing off Carl Andre’s bricks 
and Eva Hesse turning minimalist seriality into a hymn to breastfeeding. 
There’s loads to argue over and a very nice bar to have that argument in.

 The Hive at Kew Gardens. Photograph: Jeff Eden/RBG Kew 
This walk-in sculpture doesn’t so much imitate a beehive as show how the 
architecture of nature can inspire human design. Its repeating honeycomb-like 
construction creates a lofty hi-tech environment in which to contemplate the 
world of bees. The creation of artist Wolfgang Buttress, it boasts an LED light 
show triggered by real-life insect activity. Bee there or bee square.

 Georgiana Houghton’s The Eye of God. Photograph: Victorian Spiritualists' 
Union/Courtesy of the artist and Courtald Gallery 
Last chance to enter the wild and wonderful world of the Victorian woman who 
made art that she attributed to the dead. Houghton was a spiritualist medium 
who claimed her swirling drawings were the work of Titian and other artists 
guiding her passive hand. If so, their ghosts could see the future of modern 
art, for Houghton was an abstract artist decades before abstraction is usually 
said to have started. What a discovery.
