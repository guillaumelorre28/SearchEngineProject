The closure of the Calais refugee camp  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/france-begins-operation-clear-calais-refugee-camp>
is largely being driven by French domestic politics, and any long-term solution 
is likely to be dependent on the outcome of next year’s presidential election.

Although the French have made strenuous efforts to provide refugees with 
alternative accommodation inFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>, 
such is the pull factor of the English language and the prospect of work that 
there is no guarantee that another camp will not form near another ferry 
terminal in the region.

As a result, the presidential candidates are vying to come up with longer-term 
solutions to the refugee crisis in north-west France, including the candidates 
of the right demanding a rewriting the Le Touquet treaty signed in 2003 by the 
then UK home secretary, David Blunkett, and French interior minister, Nicholas 
Sarkozy. The treaty ensures the British undertake their border checks on French 
soil.

There are many votes to be harvested in northern France, and few on the right 
are going to lose votes in the region by promising to tear up the treaty. For 
some in northern France,Calais <https://www.theguardian.com/world/calais> has 
become a cause and a symbol of the region’s economic malaise.

The danger is that the negotiations over the future of the bilateral treaty 
bleed into the wider discussions about Brexit, likely to start in earnest in 
the middle of next year.

The French are likely to be the most influential voice calling for a tough 
line if the UK opts for a hard Brexit, and the possible tearing up of Le 
Touquet is a piece of potent armoury in the French negotiator’s locker. 
Equally, no agreement has yet been reached, for instance, about the rights of 
UK citizens in France, or indeed the many French citizens in the UK – an issue 
on which the French ambassador Sylvie Bermann will be questioned by a Lords 
select committee this week.

The Anglo-French security relationship is very close, and a breakdown over 
border controls could have wider ramifications.

With the French right’s primary due to take place at the end of November, 
Alain Juppé, increasingly the favourite to become the next French president, 
says he wants a complete renegotiation of the treaty that ensures UK police 
undertake border checks on French soil.

In an interview with the Guardian last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/alain-juppe-france-managing-migrants-uk-calais-kent-border>
, he said: “We can’t tolerate what is going on in Calais, the image is 
disastrous for our country and there are also extremely serious economic and 
security consequences for the people of Calais.”

Sarkozy has said he will be in the UK the day after he is elected to demand 
the treaty is rewritten.

It is likely that Xavier Bertrand, president of the 
Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie region and one of the few French politicians 
focused on a long-term solution, will act as an adviser to Juppé on Calais, or 
even Sarkozy.

He told the Guardian that British responsibilities were not limited to 
providing cash for better security in Calais, but has spoken about UK 
cooperation in the removal of refused asylum seekers, including jointly 
organised flights of refused asylum seekers back to their countries of origin. 
The same call has been taken up by up by François Fillon, another candidate for 
the right.

Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister and a socialist, is more 
cautious. In an interview with la Voix du Nord, he said: “Challenging Le 
Touquet agreements by moving the border to the English coast would reopen the 
border we closed in Calais, and so give a strong signal to smugglers and 
migrants to return en masse there. It would start again from scratch.”

The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, argued: “If the border is 
moved to the other side of the Channel, as some suggest, we’ll have to put out 
boats to rescue people who will be in the water.”

Cazeneuve insists that unlike 2003, when the Sangatte camp was destroyed in a 
short-term operation, a comprehensive strategy is in place. This includes 
dispersal of refugees to regional camps, securing the tunnel, a crackdown on 33 
illegal immigration routes and the maintenance of a stronger police presence on 
the French coast.

But if this does not work, the call for more drastic action will grow ever 
louder during the presidential campaign.
