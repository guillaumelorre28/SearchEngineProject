Today in Campaign 2016

 * A 2005 video revealed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump bragging 
about groping women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women>
 without consent, as part of a conversation with a television host that was 
caught on a live microphone. “When you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump 
says in the recording,obtained by the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html?postshare=3561475870579757&tid=ss_tw>
. “I did try and fuck her, she was married.” 
You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. 
It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. Grab them by the pussy. You 
can do anything.”

 * In a statement on Friday, Trump described the conversation as “locker room 
banter” and said former president Bill Clinton “has said far worse to me on the 
golf course – not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended.” 
 * Republican leaders decried Trump’s remarks but refused to withdraw their 
endorsements of the nominee. House speaker Paul Ryan disinvited Trump from 
their first joint campaign event in Wisconsin, saying, “I am sickened by what I 
heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified.” 
 * Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John McCain also denounced the comments 
but did not unendorse Trump. Republican chairman Reince Priebus released a 
short statement: “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked 
about in this manner. Ever.” 
 * One Republican senator called for Trump to drop out of the race with only a 
month before election day, and a second came close. “@realDonaldTrump 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump> should drop out. @GOP 
<https://twitter.com/GOP> should engage rules for emergency replacement,” Mark 
Kirk tweeted 
 * One Republican leader abandoned Trump, saying his remarks were “beyond 
offensive & despicable”. Utah governor Gary Herbert announced, “while I cannot 
vote for Hillary Clinton, I will not vote for Trump.” 
 * 
 * In defiance of the DNA exoneration of five African American men who had 
been convicted and then acquitted of rape, Trump suggested to CNN Thursday that 
he still believes so-called Central Park Five are guilty.

 * US intelligence officials are “confident” that the Russian government has 
orchestrated a series of cyberattacks on American political organizations and 
parties “to interfere with the US election process,” according to the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
 * “These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US 
election process,” said homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson and director of 
national intelligence James Clapper in a statement. “Such activity is not new 
to Moscow-the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe 
and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based 
on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most 
officials could have authorized these activities.”
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) 
This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.

Texas senator Ted Cruz has condemned Trump’s remarks but not withdrawn his 
endorsement, which hemade two weeks ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/ted-cruz-support-donald-trump>.

“Every wife, mother, daughter – every person – deserves to be treated with 
dignity and respect,” Cruztweeted 
<https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/784568112419069952>.
Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) 
These comments are disturbing and inappropriate, there is simply no excuse for 
them.

<https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/784567958525927426> 
Cruz spent months hemming and hawing about whether to endorse Trump, who had 
mocked the senator’s wife and spread a conspiracy theory about Cruz’s father 
and the assassination of John F Kennedy. Inthe heated final days of the primary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/02/ted-cruz-indiana-heckler-canada-zodiac-killer>
, Cruz called Trump a “serial philanderer”, an “amoral pathological liar” and a 
“braggadocious, arrogant buffoon”.

The senator drew heckling and boos at the Republican national convention for 
his refusal to endorse Trump. “I am not in the habit of supporting people who 
attack my wife and attack my father,” Cruz said in July, adding that he would 
not be “like a servile puppy dog and say, ‘Thank you very much for maligning my 
wife and maligning my father.’”

He buckled a few months later.

On 23 September, Cruz wrote 
<https://www.facebook.com/tedcruzpage/posts/10154476728267464>: “After many 
months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I 
have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, 
Donald Trump.

“Second, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our 
nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable – that’s why I 
have always been#NeverHillary 
<https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/neverhillary?source=feed_text&story_id=10154476728267464>
.”

Cruz endorses Trump: 'He's the only thing standing in Clinton's way'

Florida senator Marco Rubio, who lost to Trump in the Republican primary, has 
denounced the nominee’s remarks.

Like Paul Ryan, John McCain, Kelly Ayotte, Pat Toomey and Rob Portman, he has 
not withdrawn his endorsement of Trump.
Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) 
Donald's comments were vulgar, egregious & impossible to justify.
No one should ever talk about any woman in those terms, even in private.

Trump replies to Ryan's disinvitation

Trump has released a statement regarding his disinvitation from Paul Ryan’s 
Wisconsin event. He does not mention Ryan.

Governor Mike Pence will be representing me tomorrow in Wisconsin. I will be 
spending the day in New York in debate prep with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, 
Gov. Christie and Sen. Jeff Sessions, and then flying to St. Louis on Sunday 
for the 2nd presidential debate.”

accused Donald Trump of “attempted rape” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview>
in Ivanka Trump’s bedroom in 1992.

Harth and her longtime boyfriend were in meetings with Trump to forge a 
business partnership. “He was relentless,” Harth recalled in an interview, 
describing how on Dec. 12, 1992, he took the couple to dinner and a club — and 
then situated himself beside Harth and ran his hands up her skirt, to her 
crotch. “I didn’t know how to handle it. I would go away from him and say I 
have to go to the restroom. It was the escape route.” …

The first sign of trouble came the day before the evening groping, in an 
initial business meeting in which, Harth and Houraney say, Trump spent the time 
asking about the breasts of the beauty contestants — real or enhanced? — and 
staring at Harth, then 30. At one point he asked Houraney, “Are you sleeping 
with her?” Houraney explained awkwardly that they were a couple, but Trump was 
unfazed.

“You know, there’s going to be a problem,” Trump told Houraney, according to a 
1997 sexual harassment lawsuit Harth filed against him. “I’m very attracted to 
your girlfriend.”

Senator John McCain, the Republican party’s 2008 nominee, has similarly 
condemned the remarks but stopped short of withdrawing his support ofDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

He does, however, draw close to abandoning the nominee in a statement:

There are no excuses for Donald Trump’s offensive and demeaning comments. No 
woman should ever be victimized by this kind of inappropriate behavior. He 
alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences.”

Paul Ryan disinvites Trump from event

Paul Ryan, speaker of the House and the most powerful Republican in Congress, 
has condemned Donald Trump’s boasts of groping women but refused to withdraw 
his endorsement of the party’s nominee.

His statement:

“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, 
not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it 
deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect 
for women than this clip suggests.

“In the meantime, he is no longer attending tomorrow’s event in Wisconsin.”

Ryan had been scheduled to attend his first joint campaign event with Trump in 
Wisconsin on Saturday.

Republican senator calls for Trump to quit

Republican Senator Mark Kirk, though he has never shied from criticizing 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, is now openly 
calling for the Republican nominee’s resignation.

Kirk has already rejected the possibility of endorsing Trump, but never gone 
so far as to call for the replacement of the man who won the Republican primary 
contest.
Mark Kirk (@SenatorKirk) 
.@realDonaldTrump <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump> should drop out. @GOP 
<https://twitter.com/GOP> should engage rules for emergency replacement.

Top allies of other anti-Trump Republicans have made similar calls. Stuart 
Stevens served as a strategist for Mitt Romney in 2012, and John Weaver for 
John Kasich this last year.
stuart stevens (@stuartpstevens) 
Trump would be fired from any major company in America. Yet he's asking to be 
hired for biggest job in the world.

Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey, a Republican in a close race, has curtly 
denounced the remarks as “outrageous and unacceptable”.

North Carolina senator Richard Bur said they were “inappropriate and 
completely unacceptable”.

As recently as mid-August, Toomey had still refused to say whether he would 
endorse Trump for president 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-trump-two-step-how-a-gop-senator-is-trying-awkwardly-to-keep-his-job/2016/08/16/af237228-6167-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html>
. The senator faces deep anti-Trump sentiment in the suburbs around 
Philadelphia, where a large number of white college-educated voters live. 
Toomey has tried to argue 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-09-09/toomey-battles-trump-effect-as-republicans-seek-to-hold-senate>
 that whether Trump or Hillary Clinton win, he’ll act as a congressional check 
on their powers.

He joins senators Mark Kirk, Kelly Ayotte and Jeff Flake as vocally angry 
about the video. Senator Rob Portman said he was glad Trump had apologized, if 
his statement can be read as such. Ayotte and Portman have said they will vote 
for Trump.

Senator Mitch McConnell and Representative Paul Ryan, the leaders of the party 
in Congress, have remained silent.

Party leaders such as Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, and chairman Reince

 saying “I did try and fuck her, she was married,” about an unknown woman, and 
boasting about how he feels entitled to “grab them by the pussy”.

Ohio Senator Rob Portman has become one of the few Republicans to venture a 
simulacrum of defense for Trump – though with a small condemnation.

Portman said Trump was “right to apologize” and “the comments were offensive 
and wrong”.

“This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many 
years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even 
close. I apologize if anyone was offended,” Trump said.

Portman is looking increasingly lonely among his peers. Representative Cathy 
McMorris Rodgers, the highest ranking Republican woman in Congress, has 
released a less equivocal statement.

“I have said before that I would not hesitate to voice my disagreement with Mr 
Trump when he says something that I believe should not be part of our political 
dialogue,” she said.

“It is never appropriate to condone unwanted sexual advances or violence 
against women. Mr Trump must realize that it has no place or private 
conversations today or in the past.”

Illinois senator Mark Kirk and Arizona senator Jeff Flake, two Republican 
senators who have refused to endorse Trump, have added their scorn to the wave 
of anger against the businessman.

On Thursday night Trump said Kirk “is not doing so well”

 * A 2005 video revealed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump bragging 
about groping women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women>
 without consent, as part of a conversation with a television host that was 
caught on a live microphone. “When you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump 
says in the recording,obtained by the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html?postshare=3561475870579757&tid=ss_tw>
. “I did try and fuck her, she was married.” 
You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. 
It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. Grab them by the pussy. You 
can do anything.”

 * In a statement on Friday, Trump described the conversation as “locker room 
banter” and said former president Bill Clinton “has said far worse to me on the 
golf course – not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended.” 
 * Republican leaders decried Trump’s remarks but refused to withdraw their 
endorsements of the nominee. House speaker Paul Ryan disinvited Trump from 
their first joint campaign event in Wisconsin, saying, “I am sickened by what I 
heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified.” 
 * Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John McCain also denounced the comments 
but did not unendorse Trump. Republican chairman Reince Priebus released a 
short statement: “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked 
about in this manner. Ever.” 
 * One Republican senator called for Trump to drop out of the race with only a 
month before election day, and a second came close. “@realDonaldTrump 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump> should drop out. @GOP 
<https://twitter.com/GOP> should engage rules for emergency replacement,” Mark 
Kirk tweeted 
 * One Republican leader abandoned Trump, saying his remarks were “beyond 
offensive & despicable”. Utah governor Gary Herbert announced, “while I cannot 
vote for Hillary Clinton, I will not vote for Trump.” 
 * 
 * In defiance of the DNA exoneration of five African American men who had 
been convicted and then acquitted of rape, Trump suggested to CNN Thursday that 
he still believes so-called Central Park Five are guilty.

 * US intelligence officials are “confident” that the Russian government has 
orchestrated a series of cyberattacks on American political organizations and 
parties “to interfere with the US election process,” according to the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
 * “These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US 
election process,” said homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson and director of 
national intelligence James Clapper in a statement. “Such activity is not new 
to Moscow-the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe 
and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based 
on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most 
officials could have authorized these activities.”

Texas senator Ted Cruz has condemned Trump’s remarks but not withdrawn his 
endorsement, which hemade two weeks ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/ted-cruz-support-donald-trump>.

“Every wife, mother, daughter – every person – deserves to be treated with 
dignity and respect,” Cruztweeted 
<https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/784568112419069952>.
Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) 
These comments are disturbing and inappropriate, there is simply no excuse for 
them.

<https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/784567958525927426> 
Cruz spent months hemming and hawing about whether to endorse Trump, who had 
mocked the senator’s wife and spread a conspiracy theory about Cruz’s father 
and the assassination of John F Kennedy. Inthe heated final days of the primary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/02/ted-cruz-indiana-heckler-canada-zodiac-killer>
, Cruz called Trump a “serial philanderer”, an “amoral pathological liar” and a 
“braggadocious, arrogant buffoon”.

The senator drew heckling and boos at the Republican national convention for 
his refusal to endorse Trump. “I am not in the habit of supporting people who 
attack my wife and attack my father,” Cruz said in July, adding that he would 
not be “like a servile puppy dog and say, ‘Thank you very much for maligning my 
wife and maligning my father.’”

He buckled a few months later.

On 23 September, Cruz wrote 
<https://www.facebook.com/tedcruzpage/posts/10154476728267464>: “After many 
months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I 
have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, 
Donald Trump.

“Second, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our 
nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable – that’s why I

Florida senator Marco Rubio, who lost to Trump in the Republican primary, has 
denounced the nominee’s remarks.

Like Paul Ryan, John McCain, Kelly Ayotte, Pat Toomey and Rob Portman, he has 
not withdrawn his endorsement of Trump.
Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) 
Donald's comments were vulgar, egregious & impossible to justify.

Trump has released a statement regarding his disinvitation from Paul Ryan’s 
Wisconsin event. He does not mention Ryan.

Governor Mike Pence will be representing me tomorrow in Wisconsin. I will be 
spending the day in New York in debate prep with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, 
Gov. Christie and Sen. Jeff Sessions, and then flying to St. Louis on Sunday 
for the 2nd presidential debate.”
 
The New York Times has published an interview with Jill Harth, who in 1997 
accused Donald Trump of “attempted rape” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview>
in Ivanka Trump’s bedroom in 1992.

Harth and her longtime boyfriend were in meetings with Trump to forge a 
business partnership. “He was relentless,” Harth recalled in an interview, 
describing how on Dec. 12, 1992, he took the couple to dinner and a club — and 
then situated himself beside Harth and ran his hands up her skirt, to her 
crotch. “I didn’t know how to handle it. I would go away from him and say I 
have to go to the restroom. It was the escape route.” …

The first sign of trouble came the day before the evening groping, in an 
initial business meeting in which, Harth and Houraney say, Trump spent the time 
asking about the breasts of the beauty contestants — real or enhanced? — and 
staring at Harth, then 30. At one point he asked Houraney, “Are you sleeping 
with her?” Houraney explained awkwardly that they were a couple, but Trump was 
unfazed.

“You know, there’s going to be a problem,” Trump told Houraney, according to a 
1997 sexual harassment lawsuit Harth filed against him. “I’m very attracted to 
your girlfriend.”

Senator John McCain, the Republican party’s 2008 nominee, has similarly 
condemned the remarks but stopped short of withdrawing his support ofDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

He does, however, draw close to abandoning the nominee in a statement:

There are no excuses for Donald Trump’s offensive and demeaning comments. No 
woman should ever be victimized by this kind of inappropriate behavior. He 
alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences.”
 
Paul Ryan, speaker of the House and the most powerful Republican in Congress, 
has condemned Donald Trump’s boasts of groping women but refused to withdraw 
his endorsement of the party’s nominee.

His statement:

“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, 
not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it 
deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect 
for women than this clip suggests.

“In the meantime, he is no longer attending tomorrow’s event in Wisconsin.”

Ryan had been scheduled to attend his first joint campaign event with Trump in 
Wisconsin on Saturday.
 
Republican Senator Mark Kirk, though he has never shied from criticizing 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, is now openly 
calling for the Republican nominee’s resignation.

Kirk has already rejected the possibility of endorsing Trump, but never gone 
so far as to call for the replacement of the man who won the Republican primary 
contest.

Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey, a Republican in a close race, has curtly 
denounced the remarks as “outrageous and unacceptable”.

North Carolina senator Richard Bur said they were “inappropriate and 
completely unacceptable”.

As recently as mid-August, Toomey had still refused to say whether he would 
endorse Trump for president 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-trump-two-step-how-a-gop-senator-is-trying-awkwardly-to-keep-his-job/2016/08/16/af237228-6167-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html>
. The senator faces deep anti-Trump sentiment in the suburbs around 
Philadelphia, where a large number of white college-educated voters live. 
Toomey has tried to argue 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-09-09/toomey-battles-trump-effect-as-republicans-seek-to-hold-senate>
 that whether Trump or Hillary Clinton win, he’ll act as a congressional check 
on their powers.

He joins senators Mark Kirk, Kelly Ayotte and Jeff Flake as vocally angry 
about the video. Senator Rob Portman said he was glad Trump had apologized, if 
his statement can be read as such. Ayotte and Portman have said they will vote 
for Trump.

Senator Mitch McConnell and Representative Paul Ryan, the leaders of the party 
in Congress, have remained silent.

Mitt Romney, Republican party’s 2012 nominee who has refused to endorse Trump 
andpilloried him for months

, has also attacked the businessman for the video.

Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our 
wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world.

Party leaders such as Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, and chairman Reince 
Priebus have tried to bring reluctant conservatives into Trump’s camp for 
months. Earlier this year, Priebus called out Romney by name in a plea to stop 
creating divisions in the party.
Reince Priebus (@Reince) 
Respect Mitt and differences but couldn't disagree more. SCOTUS too important 
to lose for generations. Let's stop this and unify.

In 2012, Romney was widely mocked after a presidential debate for saying that 
he had “binders full of women” 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/17/mitt-romney-s-binders-full-of-women-comment-sets-internet-ablaze.html>
who were qualified to work for him.

The video released today reveals Trump

 saying “I did try and fuck her, she was married,” about an unknown woman, and 
boasting about how he feels entitled to “grab them by the pussy”.
 
Ohio Senator Rob Portman has become one of the few Republicans to venture a 
simulacrum of defense for Trump – though with a small condemnation.

Portman said Trump was “right to apologize” and “the comments were offensive 
and wrong”.

“This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many 
years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even 
close. I apologize if anyone was offended,” Trump said.

Portman is looking increasingly lonely among his peers. Representative Cathy 
McMorris Rodgers, the highest ranking Republican woman in Congress, has 
released a less equivocal statement.

“I have said before that I would not hesitate to voice my disagreement with Mr 
Trump when he says something that I believe should not be part of our political 
dialogue,” she said.

“It is never appropriate to condone unwanted sexual advances or violence 
against women. Mr Trump must realize that it has no place or private 
conversations today or in the past.”
 
Illinois senator Mark Kirk and Arizona senator Jeff Flake, two Republican 
senators who have refused to endorse Trump, have added their scorn to the wave 
of anger against the businessman.

On Thursday night Trump said Kirk “is not doing so well”

 in his campaign. “That’s his problem.”

DJT is a malignant clown - unprepared and unfit to be president of the United 
States.
