MIA <https://www.theguardian.com/music/mia> has accused the MTV Video Music 
Awards of “racism, sexism, classism, elitism” after the video for her single 
Borders was not included on this year’s nominee list.


The self-directed video makes a statement on the refugee crisis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/27/mia-borders-video-refugee-crisis-europe>
, portraying groups of men packed on flotilla boats, while others scale vast 
border fences topped with barbed wire.

The VMA shortlist, announced earlier this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jul/26/beyonce-adele-2016-mtv-video-music-awards-lemonade>
, is dominated by Beyoncé’s Lemonade, an artist MIA condemned this year for not 
being vocal about issues beyond Black Lives Matter. “IsBeyoncé 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce> or Kendrick Lamar going to say 
Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter? Or this kid in Pakistan matters?” 
she told the Evening Standard in April.

Posting a series of messages on Twitter today, the Sri Lankan rapper writes:

BORDERS came representing people outside US showing 🌍. This is a perfect 
example of "allowed" voice vs excluded voices .Even if U direct it.

Her reference to “allowed’ voice v excluded voices” alludes to MIA’s original 
comments surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement, which eventually led to 
her being dropped from the bill of London’sAfropunk festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/19/grace-jones-replaces-mia-at-afropunk-festival>
.

“After discussing the situation with the artist and the community, a decision 
was agreed upon by all involved that MIA will no longer headline Afropunk 
London,” astatement from the festival read 
<http://www.afropunk.com/profiles/blogs/a-message-about-afropunk-london-1> last 
week, after ticketholders threatened to boycott the event. “A key part of the 
Afropunk ethos has always been educating one another, breaking down boundaries 
and sparking conversation about race, gender, religion, sex, culture and 
everything that makes life worth living.”
