D’Army Bailey, a lawyer and judge who helped preserve the Memphis hotel where 
the civil rights leaderMartin Luther King 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king> Jr was assassinated 
and turn it into the National Civil Rights Museum, died on Sunday. He was 73.

Adrienne Bailey said her husband died after a long illness, surrounded by 
family at Methodist hospital inMemphis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/memphis>.

Bailey led the fight to preserve the crumbling Lorraine Motel, where King was 
slain while standing on a balcony on 4 April 1968. King had stayed at the hotel 
while marching and making speeches on behalf of striking sanitation workers who 
were protesting against low wages and unsafe working conditions.

Bailey assembled donors to buy the hotel, which ultimately became the National 
Civil Rights Museum in 1991. The museum has since been extensively renovated.

Bailey also had small acting roles in several films, including The People vs 
Larry Flynt and How Stella Got Her Groove Back.

Former US congressman Harold Ford Sr called Bailey an “unwavering advocate for 
justice”.

“Our community was made better by his years of service, his stunning intellect 
and a deep appreciation for the rule of law,” he said. “We should all be 
thankful for his tireless efforts and leadership.”

Bailey received his law degree from Yale and practised civil rights law in New 
York before moving to California. He served on the Berkeley, California, city 
council from 1971 until 1973.

He wrote The Education of a Black Radical: A Southern Civil Rights Activist’s 
Journey, 1959-1964 and Dr Martin Luther King Jr’s Final Journey.
