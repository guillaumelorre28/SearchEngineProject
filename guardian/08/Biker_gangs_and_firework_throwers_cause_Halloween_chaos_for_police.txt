Gangs of bikers and youths pelting fireworks caused Halloween 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/halloween> chaos for emergency 
services across the country.

More than 200 motorcyclists gathered for a “Halloween ride out” in Solihull and
Birmingham <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham>, while in Leeds a group 
of more than 50 people racing off-road motorcycles and quad bikes brought 
Kirkstall Road to a standstill.

Fireworks were thrown at police in two separate attacks caught on video, with 
one officer narrowly avoiding being hit by an explosive in Tottenham, north
London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>, the Metropolitan police said. A 
youth was detained over the attack.

Footage from the dashcam of a car being driven by neighbourhood watch group 
Shomrim showed a firework fly past a Met officer. The rocket then ricocheted 
and exploded next to a police car.

The riders, many of whom were wearing face masks, darted between traffic, 
jumped red lights and performed stunts on busy main roads.


The fire service also reported that a group of bikers were stopping them from 
responding to an emergency call.


Ch Insp Jack Hadley of West Midlands police described it as “outrageous” and 
“totally unacceptable”.


“This wasn’t a rally of bike enthusiasts – this was loutish, criminal 
behaviour,” he said. “Bikers were riding without lights, at speed, dangerously, 
pulling wheelies in the street, mounting pavements and damaging vehicles.”

In Leeds <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/leeds>, Kirkstall Road was closed for 
90 minutes as police waited for the bikers to disperse.


Witnesses described the scene as “utter chaos” and “madness” and compared it 
to the film Mad Max. It is thought the event was organised on social media. No 
arrests were made, West Yorkshire police said.
