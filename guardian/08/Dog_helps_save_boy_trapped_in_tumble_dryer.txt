A family dog has been hailed as a hero for helping to save a young boy trapped 
in a tumble dryer.

Teddy the cockapoo raised the alarm after the machine started with 
five-year-old Riley Gedge-Duffy stuck inside.

Riley, who has Down’s syndrome, sustained burns to his arms back and head in 
the incident at the family home in Bangor, County Down, on Sunday.

His father, Aaron Duffy, said: “My wife was upstairs hoovering at the time and 
the dog ran upstairs and basically went berserk so she knew something was not 
right.

“When she went downstairs she saw our older son watching TV and asked ‘where’s 
Riley?’ The dog was barking like mad and running backwards and forwards to the 
tumble dryer, but because it was so dark inside she could not see where Riley 
was.

“They could hear banging and crashing and could see his iPad going round and 
round. We suspect he was inside for a couple of minutes. She pulled Riley out 
and started pouring cold water over him. I arrived home about 40 seconds later, 
stripped him and took him into the shower to cover him in cold water. After 
that I dialled 999. It doesn’t bear thinking about what might have happened if 
the dog had not been there.”

Riley was taken to the Ulster hospital in Dundonald. Duffy said he was 
expected to have a CT scan to check swelling to his head.

“He’s doing very well, apart from the burns and bruising to the head,” he 
said. “But he is in good enough form and is getting back to his old self.”

A hospital spokeswoman described the boy’s condition as comfortable.

Duffy, 42, warned other parents of the dangers posed by tumble dryers, and 
thanked ambulance and medical staff for their swift response.

He said: “You read about these things happening, but this happened in our 
house and I just want other parents to be aware. We have a bigger than usual 
tumble dryer because there are six of us in the house and we have lots of 
laundry. It’s not an old model or anything but by just turning the dial and 
closing the door, that triggers it to start.

“It angers me, really, when I think about what could have happened. Kids have 
suffocated and the heat drawing the air could have killed Riley quicker. Only 
for our dog reacting the way she did, my wife would not have known something 
was up.”

He said it was the second time in two months that Teddy had warned of danger. 
“The dog alerted us that an iPhone charger was catching fire. She’s a brilliant 
dog, it is amazing.”

ambulance service described the incident as “horrific” and said crews were on 
the scene within six minutes.

“Today [Riley] is back to his old self and we will maybe get him a wee visit 
to the station next week,” the service said.
