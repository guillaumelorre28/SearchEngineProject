Newquay is famous for its surfing beaches and laid-back attitude but food was 
never a strong point – not until now. A wave of new independent restaurants, 
cafes and takeaways have opened in recent months, including Rick Stein’s new 
Fistral beach takeaway, delivering new takes on Cornwall’s seafood dishes – and 
the area’s other great local produce.

A former head chef for Rick Stein, Paul Harwood opened Fish House last year 
and it’s been packed ever since. The location helps: a former storeroom, 
decorated with salvaged timber, beach-hut decor and with an open kitchen. The 
property extends on to an elevated terrace overlooking Fistral beach. And the 
food (refined without being pretentious) is among the best in town. The a la 
carte menu is a little more expensive (£13.95 for a generous plate of fish 
curry withbasmati, raita and papadums) but the light lunch menu is great value: 
tiger prawns cooked in garlic and chilli with homemadefocaccia, moules frites 
or crispy squid with Greek salad and aioli. My daily special (two fresh, 
grilled mackerel fillets, cooked in a curry paste with a zingy tomato and 
coriander salad) was billed as a starter (from £6.50) but with a bowl of crisp, 
hand-cut chips (£2.50) it made an excellent lunch for just under £10.
• Lunches from £6.95, mains from £11.50. Fistral beach, Headland Road, 
thefishhouse-fistral.com <http://thefishhouse-fistral.com/>. Open midday-3pm, 
6pm-10pm, closed Monday lunchtimes and from 3 January-13 February

Newquay has many beaches and plenty of beach cafes, too; of note are Lewinnick 
Lodge <http://www.lewinnicklodge.co.uk/> on Pentire Head (for heavenly sunsets) 
andLusty Glaze Beach <http://www.lustyglaze.co.uk/>. More central, is the 
Breaks at Tolcarne: a surfy diner among the beach huts and high cliffs of a 
privately-owned beach with a terrace and an open-air lounge area right on the 
sand. Popular with locals, it’s a great place to watch the waves roll in. Go 
for the pre-surf breakfasts (it does a hefty full Cornish) or try a “lounging 
lunch” and sample from a seafood board that includes smoked salmon, Cornish 
crab, locally smoked mackerel andBaker Tom’s bread <http://www.bakertom.co.uk/>
; or baked-in-a-shell Newquay Bay crab and seafood gratin. Good value are the 
savoury pies byGrumpies of Cornwall <http://www.grumpiesofcornwall.co.uk/> – 
made in nearby Launceston from good-quality local ingredients: chicken and 
mushroom, steak, vegetarian – all at £4.75 (with crushed potatoes and 
peppercorn gravy for an extra £2.75).

The easy way to get here is from East Pentire (the cafe’s car park is between 
bungalows on Newquay’s western headland); the long way is to cross the river 
Gannel via gorgeous Crantock beach: at low tide, paddle through the sandy 
shallows; when the water’s up, climb aboard the Fern Pit’s own ferry. Either 
way, you arrive at a ramshackle boathouse shop (a curious mix of beach kit, 
souvenirs and tanks of live of crabs and lobsters), before taking a long flight 
of steps that meanders through a wild cliff garden to the cafe, run by the 
Northey family since 1910. The food may not be the finest (think jacket 
potatoes and cheese and pickle) but it is well worth the climb for the views, 
the chickens in the garden, the rustic picnic tables and the fresh crab 
sandwiches (£7.25) made with crab caught and landed by the Northey family’s own 
fishing boat.
• Cakes from £1.25, sandwiches from £4.50. 19 Riverside Crescent, Pentire Head,

Rick Stein has been talking about Newquay for years and finally he’s opened a 
an upmarket beachside chippy … with a twist: it’s also an Indian takeaway. 
There are two counters; everything is served in carry-out boxes but can also be 
eaten inside. The idea is to be a seaside fuelling station: hop in and out 
between surfs, grab a bacon roll (£3.95), anasi goreng (£7.95) or a fish chilli 
burger (£5.95). The space is open-plan and has canteen tables and lots of rope 
and steel, though it also lacks a little soul. For me, the Goan chicken curry 
lacked spice; ditto thepad thai (ask to have the chilli ramped up if you like 
more heat). Favourites on the Asian menu are the rich, meaty lamb karahi and 
the buttery vegetablemakhanwala – order both; these dishes work best when 
shared. From the fish menu, cod, hake or haddock and chips are classic Stein, 
cooked in beef dripping for a crisp batter (or vegetable oil on request).
• Battered or grilled fish from £5.95, chips from £2.25, Asian mains from 
£6.95, family meal (fish and chips for 4) £24.95. Fistral beach, Headland Road,

This Newquay newbie is part of Trenance Heritage Cottages 
<http://www.trenancecottages.co.uk/>, a community-led restoration project that 
recently turned a row of 18th-century dwellings into a mini 
life-in-the-old-days museum, set among the rose beds of Trenance Gardens. With 
painted furniture, pretty china and a whiff of the WI, the cafe is big on 
hearty tearoom staples made with local, organic produce. A choice of doorstep 
sandwiches includes a feta and homemade pesto, and a breakfast sandwich (bacon, 
sausage and free-range egg), all on slabs of localChough Bakery bread 
<http://www.cornishpasty.com/>. Proper Cornish cream teas come with home-baked 
scones, clotted cream andBoddington Berries jam

loose leaf teas (grown in Cornwall). When I visited the chalkboard specials 
included creamy mushrooms on toast (£5) and a pollock fish pie with salad

Named after the fictional Amity Island in the film Jaws, Katy Davidson’s 
seafood takeaway bar has become a Newquay favourite within weeks of its opening 
in May. The set up is simple: a larder of Newquay shellfish laid out on a 
fish-shop counter ready for cooking or putting into sandwiches, salads and 
seafood pots. “It’s street food with a roof,” she says. Specialities include 
the Chief Brody (fresh melt-in-the-mouth lobster served in a brioche roll with 
homemade seafood sauce and Padstow kitchen salad leaves at £8), fresh crab 
sandwiches (with Amity’s own lemon mayo) and a chunky fish-finger sandwich 
(“the Bruce” is made with pollock coated in a light tempura batter). When 
available, Katy also offers baby octopus, cuttlefish and garlic prawns but 
oysters are her passion. Cornish Porthilly Rock oysters (farmed in the Camel 
Estuary) are served raw in the shell, in tempura batter (a basket for £8), or 
in an Amity Po Boy (deep fried oysters in a bun).
• Seafood sandwiches, rolls and salad bowls from £5.50, basket of tempura baby 
octopus £4.50. South Quay Hill, 07813 792968,Facebook page

Simon Evans worked in industrial-scale catering before ditching the suit and 
opening his own Cornish-Mediterranean takeaway. And it’s been a roaring 
success. When Simon had to move sites earlier this year, his loyal customers 
helped look for premises and kit out the new place. The lunch menu looks basic 
– just hot sandwich of the day or an “all-in salad box” – but a lot goes into a 
Gusto dish. In the box, there are five or six vegan salads, plus a choice of 
“two proteins” (pulled Cornish pork, salt beef, roast lamb, two varieties of 
falafel, chicken, crab or fish fritters), a drizzle of spicy dressing (mild 
pickled mango, chilli and garlic or Moroccan pesto, among others) and a chunk 
of freshly-baked bread (including a splendid wholemeal focaccia with a crisp 
salted crust). The hot sandwich is no mean little toastie, either. Mine was a 
generous flatbread wrap filled with boneless lamb rib and served with salads 
and a feta-and-mint fritter. Also on offer are brunches, Sunday lunches and a 
new evening menu of rotisserie meats with roasted vegetables.

There is something to be said here about excessive food miles, but somehow 
kangaroo seems perfectly at home on a Newquay menu, especially when it’s cooked 
as it should be by a surfing Aussie chef. Chris Brookes’ Fore Street restaurant 
brings a taste of his native land to north Cornwall with an array of antipodean 
fare, from home-baked damper bread (a camp-style soda bread served with a dip 
of Queensland macadamiadukka) to a Bush Tucker breakfast (with Cornish bacon 
and ‘roo sausages) and crocodile and black pudding croquettes (which didn’t 
work for me). Elsewhere on the menu, there are soups, seafood, risottos and 
vegetarian dishes. But for me, the winning dish is the kangaroo burger: lean, 
tender fillets of imported ‘roo meat, cooked pink and packed into a light bun 
with slices of beetroot, caramelised onion and outback spice mayo (£7.95 
including fries and salad).

A combo of tacos, cocktails and crazy golf, delivered by a young surfer with a 
sideline inbespoke wetsuits <http://neonwetsuits.com/> … this is so Newquay. 
Before Elsie Pinniger took over in April, this was a tired cafe-in-a-hut on a 
vintage mini golf course, close to Fistral but a bit off-the-beaten track. 
Elsie painted the hut black, renamed it (after the film, Happy Gilmore), added 
kitschy-California colour and drew up a budget menu of Mexican-style dishes. 
Now it’s a hip Newquay hangout– even the mini golf looks cool. The food’s the 
main thing, though. Start the day with Mexican eggs (perfectly cooked in a 
spiced tomato sauce with wilted spinach and a doorstep of buttered sourdough) 
or a huge breakfast burrito served with fresh tomato salsa and sour cream. The 
tacos are great: beef (slow-braised brisket), fish (Estrella beer-battered 
catch of the day), pulled pork or vegetarian, all served with salsa, house slaw 
and radish, pickle, herbs and lime. Elsie uses Cornish meat and Newquay fish. 
She makes her own soft-shell tacos – you get 4 of them for £9.50.

• Early-bird special (breakfast burrito and coffee) £5, tacos from £6 (mixed 
taco boards from £9.50, kids tacos £4.50). 11 Tower Road,Facebook page

Jessica Davis worked as a pastry chef in Australia (and later in the kitchens 
of Cornwall’s Scarlet Hotel), before opening this popular cake shop and cafe in 
the centre of Newquay. The place is tiny but you can also sit outside on a 
sunny deck (a glimpse of the sea lies beyond Sainsbury’s car park). With the 
exception of bagels and croissants, everything is homemade and gluten-free; the 
smoothies are made from a choice of four non-dairy milks – and as with the 
local Origin coffees and the hot chocolate, are served in recycled jam jars. 
Try a jar of clean green – avocado, spinach, banana, almond milk and spirulina 
(£4.50). And do try the cakes: chocolate brownies, fig and toasted almond 
frangipan, dairy-free orange and dark chocolate loaf, and a flourless hazelnut 
cake.
• Cakes from £2, smoothies £4.50, gluten-free granolas £3.50, open toasted 
bagel or rye bread sandwiches £3.50. 2 Broad Street,Facebook page
