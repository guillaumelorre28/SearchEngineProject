 with a run to the semi-finals last year.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/30/england-new-zealand-world-t20-match-report>
 of the World Twenty20, said: “Birmingham Bears have been one of the top teams 
in T20 over the last two years and I’m very excited to join such a great club 
that boasts several internationals.”

Ronchi has made 100 appearances for New Zealand: one Test – against England at 
Headingley last year – 70 one-dayers and 29 T20s.

Warwickshire’s director of cricket, Dougie Brown, said: “Luke has played in 
the biggest limited-overs competitions in the world and he is widely recognised 
as one of the finest wicketkeeper-batsmen in the game. His power and ability to 
consistently hit boundaries will bolster our middle-order batting lineup and I 
am sure his performances will also be great entertainment for our fans at 
Edgbaston.”
