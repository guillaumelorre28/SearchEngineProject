Stumps – England trail by 56

38th over: England 78-4 (Batty 0, Root 36) The wicket means this is final over 
of a day on which India effectively took a dormie two lead in the series. Batty 
comes in as the nightwatchman while, from the non-striker’s end, Root surveys 
the burning deck. This will probably be over tomorrow. Cheers for reading, bye.

Wicket! Stokes lbw b Ashwin 5

And the decision is overturned! Pitched on middle and leg, it turned past the 
edge and would have hit off.

Review!

Ashwin returns and he immediately hits Stokes on the pad. While they’re 
appealing the ball shoots away to the boundary. It’s given as runs, upon seeing 
which Kohli reviews. Given not out but he’s missed it...

37th over: England 78-3 (Stokes 5, Root 36) There are two slips and a silly 
point for Root against Jadeja. England could probably do with a single just to 
have the right-hander against the off-spinner and the leftie against the 
left-armer. And whaddya know? Root gets one off the last ball with a push into 
the off-side.

36th over: England 77-3 (Stokes 5, Root 35) Six balls from Jayant, after the 
last of which Ben Stokes is not out. And that’s all that matters for England at 
this stage. We’ve probably got time for three more overs after this one.

35th over: England 77-3 (Stokes 5, Root 35) As suspected more changes: Jadeja 
replaces Shami. He has Root in all sorts of trouble, pushed right back and 
inside edging on to his pads.

Oh go on then, let’s do it again.

34th over: England 76-3 (Stokes 5, Root 34) Between the overs Joe Root has 
some treatment, which appears to involve a large man giving him a bear hug from 
behind and wrestling him from side to side. Rather him than me. One off this 
one.

33rd over: England 75-3 (Stokes 5, Root 33) Four to Stokes, crushing a short 
one off his ribs and square on the leg-side to the rope. With a vertical bat, 
too. Outstanding, if futile, stuff. Two overs to go, so there will be sundries.

 Trevor Bayliss  Stephen Brown asks: “Apologies if you have covered this (in 
what I’m sure was not just informative, but witty and erudite as well); but how 
long/how many wickets do we need to wait before Hameed is allowed to come in? 
Surely we could do with passing some time and get a small lead today before 
accelerating our lead to 200/250 tomorrow morning.”

Er, I’m pretty sure he can bat now so I can only assume he’s still not fit to. 
The rest of your email might be the most hopelessly optimistic thing I’ve ever 
read.

32nd over: England 71-3 (Stokes 1, Root 33) Bairstow clips wide of midwicket 
very nicely for two but that’s the last of his contribution today. Stokes the 
new man and he’s away with a push to mid-off. Hello darkness my old friend.

“Short of the Yorkshire boys (I include Stokes in this because I want to), 
there are very few playing who look like England cricketers,” HONKs Mr. A 
Wilson.

Wicket! Bairstow c Patel b Jayant 15

Excellent catch behind the stumps. Jayant pushes it through from round the 
wicket, the ball keeps low and Bairstow jabs his bat down outside off, only to 
nick it. Patel does well to get down and hold the catch.

31st over: England 68-2 (Bairstow 13, Root 33) Maybe there’s a very, very 
small sliver of reverse there for Shami. It’s almost imperceptible if there is. 
There’s a double appeal against Root, first for lbw and then for the catch; it 
was missing leg-stump and no one is especially convinced he’s hit it. Four 
byes, flung down leg, from the last ball.

Lee Smith writes: “I think it probably true to say India have the better 
spinners and England are in the main just not used to playing spinners of that 
quality for an extended period such as this tour. There is no shame in 
admitting that India are the better team in home conditions, but it’s just that 
England do get into promising positions only to let them slip away. That is the 
real kick in the shins.”

30th over: England 64-2 (Bairstow 13, Root 33) Third ball Bairstow wants a run 
to mid-on but Root, the striker, says no. And from the final ball we just about 
see why: a bullet throw to the striker’s end has Bairstow hurriedly scampering 
into his crease and relieved the throw was wide.

swing for Shami – rather he’s angling it in from very wide. This probably won’t 
be an especially long spell.

I’m going to ask that you don’t keep sending me your snaps of random people 
who look like England cricketers. One, they’re a pain to upload, and two, some 
of them really aren’t very good.

28th over: England 62-2 (Bairstow 13, Root 31) Ooh crafty from Shami. Bairstow 
cuts out to deep point and Shami sets off in pursuit, stopping it just inside 
the rope by stepping firmly on it. He saves three and no doubt roughs it up 
just a smidgeon more. That accounts for 50% of the runs off the over and the 
only ones not scored off the edge of the bat.

27th over: England 56-2 (Bairstow 8, Root 30) Back to pace and the tantalising 
possibility of reverse swing, with Shami replacing Jadeja. “Stumps in play” 
says his captain, which makes this line well wide of off all the more 
perplexing. Speaking of perplexing, 66% of viewers voted for Ashwin and Jadeja 
over Harbhajan and Kumble, which shows you: democracy doesn’t work. Still.

John Starbuck writes: “Dan,Just got back from the local surgery (a checkup, 
thanks for asking) to discover we have lost two wickets. But also people are 
betting on how many we’ll have down at a certain score. So what kind of 
currency is a barb? Is it replacing the rupee?” You know I was secretly hoping 
I wasn’t the only one who had no idea.

26th over: England 53-2 (Bairstow 6, Root 29) Time for Ashwin to have a rest, 
so on comes Jayant. Absolutely nothing on offer for Root, who gets a big meaty 
inside edge on to his pads and thus prompts momentary excitement.

25th over: England 53-2 (Bairstow 6, Root 29) Aw this is disappointing. The 
fan question on the telly begins: “Which spin pair would you rather have in 
your team.” Sadly one of the options is not “Moeen Ali & Gareth Batty”. Alas 
it’s Ashwin & Jadeja v Harbhajan and Kumble. Bairstow gets four here, driving 
Jadeja against the spin and through mid-on to the fence.

23rd over: England 47-2 (Bairstow 2, Root 25) This is a good idea from 
Bairstow, walking away to square-leg between deliveries and making Jadeja wait, 
disrupting his rhtythm. Second slip has come out now, which is a very, very 
minor victory for England.

22nd over: England 47-2 (Bairstow 2, Root 25) “Of course India has better 
spinners,” writes Alastair Cook  Martin Hamilton, “but a big part of it must 
also be that our batsmen are not as good as theirs at playing spin. Tentative 
play makes a bowler look better than he is.” Yeah that is a good question, 
which someone posed before this series: is England’s biggest problem their 
bowling of spin or their batting against it? Root gets the first boundary for 
17 overs with a nice back-foot push through extra cover.

21st over: England 40-2 (Bairstow 1, Root 21) In comes Jonny Bairstow so, so 
much earlier than he would have liked. It was a wonderfully flighted ball from 
Ashwin in the last over, but I hate to say Botham is right: it was a 
half-hearted shot from Moeen. Bairstow gets off the mark backing away and just 
squeezing off a cut.

Wicket! Moeen c Jayant b Ashwin 5

Moeen becomes the latest to be beaten by the flight. He comes down the track, 
checks his shot and lifts it to mid-on, who barely has to move. The players 
take drinks – England need a stiff one.

19th over: England 37-1 (Moeen 4, Root 20) The deficit is down to double 
figures, although that will be of little comfort now. Moeen is beaten by a 
proper grubber, then only a fumble from cover prevents nerves jangling when he 
takes a scampered single. Another lbw appeal, again turned down as it’s missing 
leg, to finish the over.

there: a slow-mo replay reveals it just about missed Moeen’s outside edge. One

17th over: England 34-1 (Moeen 3, Root 18) Moeen is dropped! He pushes forward 
to Jadeja and gets the thinnest nick, but it’s enough to deceive Patel, who 
fumbles it to the floor. Next ball he inside edges on to his pads before 
gasping at the oxygen of runs, hurrying through for a couple out to cover. 
Obviously this pitch is less of a road for India’s spinners, because they’re 
better.Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> is a simple game 
sometimes.

16th over: England 31-1 (Moeen 1, Root 17) A single to Root means Moeen now 
faces Ashwin for the first time, two slips circling the bat as the ball turns 
away from the left hander from round the wicket. Moeen is looking to smother 
what little turn there is by stepping down the wicket, which sounds like a good 
plan to me. There’s half an appeal for lbw but it was missing leg.

15th over: England 30-1 (Moeen 1, Root 16) And now Moeen Ali has batted in all 
three positions in the top three. He’s off the mark with the easiest of singles 
to mid-on, although if he thinks that’s indicative of how easy batting is going 
to be against these spinners he has another think coming: Root nicks a sharply 
bouncing ball up to gully, then thanks his lucky stars there is no one there.

14th over: England 27-1 (Root 14) Ravi Ashwin is not a happy man: Joe Root is 
stood very close to the umpire so he can assist Cook in deciding whether or not 
to review any lbws. That’s of precisely zero use when you leave a big gap 
between bat and pad, and cordially invite the ball through it, mind.

Oh this is gorgeous. Floated up and Cook, beaten in the flight, sees the ball 
go through the gate and into his stumps.

38th over: England 78-4 (Batty 0, Root 36) The wicket means this is final over 
of a day on which India effectively took a dormie two lead in the series. Batty 
comes in as the nightwatchman while, from the non-striker’s end, Root surveys 
the burning deck. This will probably be over tomorrow. Cheers for reading, bye.
 
And the decision is overturned! Pitched on middle and leg, it turned past the 
edge and would have hit off.
 
Ashwin returns and he immediately hits Stokes on the pad. While they’re 
appealing the ball shoots away to the boundary. It’s given as runs, upon seeing 
which Kohli reviews. Given not out but he’s missed it...
 
37th over: England 78-3 (Stokes 5, Root 36) There are two slips and a silly 
point for Root against Jadeja. England could probably do with a single just to 
have the right-hander against the off-spinner and the leftie against the 
left-armer. And whaddya know? Root gets one off the last ball with a push into 
the off-side.
 
36th over: England 77-3 (Stokes 5, Root 35) Six balls from Jayant, after the 
last of which Ben Stokes is not out. And that’s all that matters for England at 
this stage. We’ve probably got time for three more overs after this one.
 
35th over: England 77-3 (Stokes 5, Root 35) As suspected more changes: Jadeja 
replaces Shami. He has Root in all sorts of trouble, pushed right back and 
inside edging on to his pads.

Oh go on then, let’s do it again.
 
34th over: England 76-3 (Stokes 5, Root 34) Between the overs Joe Root has 
some treatment, which appears to involve a large man giving him a bear hug from 
behind and wrestling him from side to side. Rather him than me. One off this 
one.
 
33rd over: England 75-3 (Stokes 5, Root 33) Four to Stokes, crushing a short 
one off his ribs and square on the leg-side to the rope. With a vertical bat, 
too. Outstanding, if futile, stuff. Two overs to go, so there will be sundries.

 Trevor Bayliss  Stephen Brown asks: “Apologies if you have covered this (in 
what I’m sure was not just informative, but witty and erudite as well); but how 
long/how many wickets do we need to wait before Hameed is allowed to come in? 
Surely we could do with passing some time and get a small lead today before 
accelerating our lead to 200/250 tomorrow morning.”

Er, I’m pretty sure he can bat now so I can only assume he’s still not fit to. 
The rest of your email might be the most hopelessly optimistic thing I’ve ever 
read.
 
32nd over: England 71-3 (Stokes 1, Root 33) Bairstow clips wide of midwicket 
very nicely for two but that’s the last of his contribution today. Stokes the 
new man and he’s away with a push to mid-off. Hello darkness my old friend.

“Short of the Yorkshire boys (I include Stokes in this because I want to), 
there are very few playing who look like England cricketers,” HONKs Mr. A 
Wilson.
 
Excellent catch behind the stumps. Jayant pushes it through from round the 
wicket, the ball keeps low and Bairstow jabs his bat down outside off, only to 
nick it. Patel does well to get down and hold the catch.
 
31st over: England 68-2 (Bairstow 13, Root 33) Maybe there’s a very, very 
small sliver of reverse there for Shami. It’s almost imperceptible if there is. 
There’s a double appeal against Root, first for lbw and then for the catch; it 
was missing leg-stump and no one is especially convinced he’s hit it. Four 
byes, flung down leg, from the last ball.

Lee Smith writes: “I think it probably true to say India have the better 
spinners and England are in the main just not used to playing spinners of that 
quality for an extended period such as this tour. There is no shame in 
admitting that India are the better team in home conditions, but it’s just that 
England do get into promising positions only to let them slip away. That is the 
real kick in the shins.”
 
30th over: England 64-2 (Bairstow 13, Root 33) Third ball Bairstow wants a run 
to mid-on but Root, the striker, says no. And from the final ball we just about 
see why: a bullet throw to the striker’s end has Bairstow hurriedly scampering 
into his crease and relieved the throw was wide.
 
29th over: England 63-2 (Bairstow 13, Root 32) Not much by way of reverse 
swing for Shami – rather he’s angling it in from very wide. This probably won’t 
be an especially long spell.

I’m going to ask that you don’t keep sending me your snaps of random people 
who look like England cricketers. One, they’re a pain to upload, and two, some 
of them really aren’t very good.
 
28th over: England 62-2 (Bairstow 13, Root 31) Ooh crafty from Shami. Bairstow 
cuts out to deep point and Shami sets off in pursuit, stopping it just inside 
the rope by stepping firmly on it. He saves three and no doubt roughs it up 
just a smidgeon more. That accounts for 50% of the runs off the over and the 
only ones not scored off the edge of the bat.
 
27th over: England 56-2 (Bairstow 8, Root 30) Back to pace and the tantalising 
possibility of reverse swing, with Shami replacing Jadeja. “Stumps in play” 
says his captain, which makes this line well wide of off all the more 
perplexing. Speaking of perplexing, 66% of viewers voted for Ashwin and Jadeja 
over Harbhajan and Kumble, which shows you: democracy doesn’t work. Still.

John Starbuck writes: “Dan,Just got back from the local surgery (a checkup, 
thanks for asking) to discover we have lost two wickets. But also people are 
betting on how many we’ll have down at a certain score. So what kind of 
currency is a barb? Is it replacing the rupee?” You know I was secretly hoping 
I wasn’t the only one who had no idea.
 
26th over: England 53-2 (Bairstow 6, Root 29) Time for Ashwin to have a rest, 
so on comes Jayant. Absolutely nothing on offer for Root, who gets a big meaty 
inside edge on to his pads and thus prompts momentary excitement.

Well, now through to deep into tomorrow’s first session, ideally.
 
25th over: England 53-2 (Bairstow 6, Root 29) Aw this is disappointing. The 
fan question on the telly begins: “Which spin pair would you rather have in 
your team.” Sadly one of the options is not “Moeen Ali & Gareth Batty”. Alas 
it’s Ashwin & Jadeja v Harbhajan and Kumble. Bairstow gets four here, driving 
Jadeja against the spin and through mid-on to the fence.
 
24th over: England 48-2 (Bairstow 2, Root 27) “If Joe root fails again...” 
begins Robert Sim.

He looks comfortable enough in this over, at least. He nurdles 
Collingwood-esque into the leg-side for the only run from it.
 
23rd over: England 47-2 (Bairstow 2, Root 25) This is a good idea from 
Bairstow, walking away to square-leg between deliveries and making Jadeja wait, 
disrupting his rhtythm. Second slip has come out now, which is a very, very 
minor victory for England.
 
22nd over: England 47-2 (Bairstow 2, Root 25) “Of course India has better 
spinners,” writes Alastair Cook  Martin Hamilton, “but a big part of it must 
also be that our batsmen are not as good as theirs at playing spin. Tentative 
play makes a bowler look better than he is.” Yeah that is a good question, 
which someone posed before this series: is England’s biggest problem their 
bowling of spin or their batting against it? Root gets the first boundary for 
17 overs with a nice back-foot push through extra cover.
 
21st over: England 40-2 (Bairstow 1, Root 21) In comes Jonny Bairstow so, so 
much earlier than he would have liked. It was a wonderfully flighted ball from 
Ashwin in the last over, but I hate to say Botham is right: it was a 
half-hearted shot from Moeen. Bairstow gets off the mark backing away and just 
squeezing off a cut.
 
20th over: England 39-2 (Root 21) Sigh.
 
Moeen becomes the latest to be beaten by the flight. He comes down the track, 
checks his shot and lifts it to mid-on, who barely has to move. The players 
take drinks – England need a stiff one.
 
19th over: England 37-1 (Moeen 4, Root 20) The deficit is down to double 
figures, although that will be of little comfort now. Moeen is beaten by a 
proper grubber, then only a fumble from cover prevents nerves jangling when he 
takes a scampered single. Another lbw appeal, again turned down as it’s missing 
leg, to finish the over.
 
18th over: England 35-1 (Moeen 3, Root 19) I’ve been a bit harsh on Patel 
there: a slow-mo replay reveals it just about missed Moeen’s outside edge. One 
off the over.
 
17th over: England 34-1 (Moeen 3, Root 18) Moeen is dropped! He pushes forward 
to Jadeja and gets the thinnest nick, but it’s enough to deceive Patel, who 
fumbles it to the floor. Next ball he inside edges on to his pads before 
gasping at the oxygen of runs, hurrying through for a couple out to cover. 
Obviously this pitch is less of a road for India’s spinners, because they’re 
better.Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> is a simple game 
sometimes.
 
16th over: England 31-1 (Moeen 1, Root 17) A single to Root means Moeen now 
faces Ashwin for the first time, two slips circling the bat as the ball turns 
away from the left hander from round the wicket. Moeen is looking to smother 
what little turn there is by stepping down the wicket, which sounds like a good 
plan to me. There’s half an appeal for lbw but it was missing leg.
 
15th over: England 30-1 (Moeen 1, Root 16) And now Moeen Ali has batted in all 
three positions in the top three. He’s off the mark with the easiest of singles 
to mid-on, although if he thinks that’s indicative of how easy batting is going 
to be against these spinners he has another think coming: Root nicks a sharply 
bouncing ball up to gully, then thanks his lucky stars there is no one there.
 
14th over: England 27-1 (Root 14) Ravi Ashwin is not a happy man: Joe Root is 
stood very close to the umpire so he can assist Cook in deciding whether or not 
to review any lbws. That’s of precisely zero use when you leave a big gap 
between bat and pad, and cordially invite the ball through it, mind.
 
Oh this is gorgeous. Floated up and Cook, beaten in the flight, sees the ball 
go through the gate and into his stumps.
