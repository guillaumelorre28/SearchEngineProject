In closing, the presentation.

Vernon Philander is the Man of the Series. 

He didn’t get the gong in either of their wins, but it is a logical decision 
for the work he did across the three Tests. Outstanding.

Steve Smith is up at the presentation now. “I am very pleased and proud of how 
the boys stood up this game,” he says. “It was obviously a disappointing start 
to the series and we were outplayed... but I’m proud of how the boys turned it 
around.”

Smith adds that he’s pleased that two debutants were in the middle at the end. 
Nice touch, wasn’t it?

Next up on stage is the winning series captain, Faf du Plessis. “It’s pretty 
disappointing that we didn’t win the Test Match also hard to look past the fact 
that we had already won the series. I’m a very satisfied captain,” he says. “It 
is very easy to captain with a bowling attack like that.”

Faf’s a fan of the day/night Tests too. Says he likes it more than he 
expected. That’s a pretty good endorsement from the captain of the losing side, 
I reckon. And now they’re up to lift the trophy. Big smiles. Big victory. Well 
played.

You know what, I might leave it there. It’s been quite a match and quite a 
series. Huge turnover in the Australian side, masterful bowling from the 
tourists. I doubt we’ll forget it in a hurry. Thanks for all your company 
across the Tests, it’s been very much appreciated.

For our part, we’ll be back with the OBO for Guardian Australian in the 
Chappell-Hadlee ODIs coming up in the first week of December. Until then. 
Goodnight from Adelaide Oval.

While the players gather for the presentation. 

A win for Australia with their remodelled XI. It could be said that they have 
come a very long way in the space of a Test Match. But with Pakistan ahead, 
considered assessments might be best at the end of the summer. Still, it’s a 
start. And the hosts really did earn this win, with excellent bowling across 
the match the defining Khawaja ton.

Usman Khawaja is the man of the much. “He solidifies the top of the order,” he 
says of the new man Renshaw. “Hopefully this will lead into a big series 
against Pakistan because there’s a lot of work to do there.” He’s not wrong.

Matt Renshaw is on the ABC now: “It has been amazing, trying to embrace it all 
and have a lot of fun,” he says. “I was just trying to have find but once the 
crowd got going that was the hard part. I had to just keep myself grounded and 
not play something stupid.”

AUSTRALIA WIN BY SEVEN WICKETS (Renshaw 34, Handscomb 1)

Peter Handscomb, the man who had such a hand in giving Australia a healthy 
first innings lead, hits the winning runs. It takes a few attempts after 
getting the strike, nearly giving a return catch. But it matters little when he 
finds the gap at midwicket and claims the win. Handshakes all around.

40th over: Australia 125-3 (Renshaw 33, Handscomb 0) It looked like they were 
going to get it that over too before the captain fell to the last ball, Smith 
picking up four through the cordon after a couple by midwicket. But now, as 
noted before, it’ll be a rookie. Shamsi has the ball.

WICKET! Smith c de Kock b Abbott 40 (Australia 125-3)

Smith is fuming. It’s a great bit of bowling from Abbott, two runs short of 
the win. After all those plays and misses from Renshaw, the captain gets a 
feather. Handscomb out to the middle means that one of these two will get to 
hit the winning runs on debut. Nice. A handy knock from Smith, by the way.

39th over: Australia 119-2 (Renshaw 33, Smith 34) Oh this is brilliant, the 
crowd are livid when Smith takes one. Even in the press box there is a cry of 
“No!”. But when he times the next Shamsi delivery off his pads through the 
onside for four? An enthusiastic round of applause! 31 balls he spent on 24. A 
single - indeed a dropped catch at slip - earns more cheers. Then when he goes 
down the ground foranother boundary it’s all-but a standing ovation! Test 
cricket... wouldn’t have it any other way. Eight to win now.

Listen to the fans! This is brilliant from Renshaw #AUSvSA

38th over: Australia 108-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 32) Smith take Abbott’s first 
ball of a new spell to midwicket putting Renshaw on strike. The crowd probably 
aren’t enjoying the prospect of Renshaw batting out the over to dinner, 
ensuring the long break will take place you would have to think? We will see. 
By half way through the over the slow clapping has begu, and Renshaw... is on 
front foot defending. Glorious. I can only imagine some corners of twitter at 
the moment. He’s beaten by the penultimate delivery, just to stick with the 
theme, a very good one from Abbott, again missed by quite a decent margin. He 
defends the last ball into the offside. Is that... dinner? No, it is not! We 
will continue on.

Critics of Aus team have been crying out for a player who will value his 
wicket like Renshaw does.

37th over: Australia 107-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 31) Bronx cheer of sorts goes up 
when the board ticks over for the first time in a while, Smith pulling Shamsi 
for a couple. He follows it with a single to cover. That doesn’t modify the 
Renshaw approach, who has 11 scoring shots in nearly 130 balls now. Defending 
and leaving, even when Shamsi goes around the wicket to provoke a stroke. The 
crowd are egging him on to do something slightly more. Suggestion through the 
stump mic that the South Africans want him to have a crack as well. Good luck 
with that, don’t think he cares.

36th over: Australia 104-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 28) Back to back maidens might 
encourage the umpires to actually take dinner at the scheduled time? That’s 
only an over or two away, and they need to be confident of a result within 15 
minutes (or four overs). It was Rabada to Renshaw, by the way. You can probably 
guess how it played out, a couple of leaves, a couple of defensive strokes and 
a play and miss. Essentially Renshaw at a glance this afternoon.

outstanding. It's been amazing to witness this match.#AUSvSA

35th over: Australia 104-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 28) Shamsi to Smith. There’s a 
play and miss in the early in the over, which governs a more conservative 
approach for the remainder of it. A maiden. Still, not far away now. 23 runs to 
be precise.

34th over: Australia 104-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 28) Lovely Smith cover drive 
nets him three. Haven’t seen much of that today. His signature when in full 
flight. He hasn’t dominated the series nor made a ton, but he looks ready for 
something like that in the second half of the summer when Pakistan arrive.

33rd over: Australia 101-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 25) Shamsi and Smith has brought 
about a certain outcome in this match so far, but less here. I think Smith has 
put it away now, result assured. He’ll be happy to do this in singles just 
about. He gets one of those to end the over and retain the strike, around the 
corner with the full face of the bat.

32nd over: Australia 100-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 24) Rabada and Renshaw resume 
their contest. He’s only given one chance to bust out his favoured leave this 
time around, Rabada straightening up his line. But the Renshaw defence is up to 
the challenge. A maiden. We’re nearing dinner, but there’ll be no dinner as 
this session will be extended.

31st over: Australia 100-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 24) It’s too easy for Smith when 
Shamsi has the ball. It’s been a mismatch from the get go. The former uses 
those fancy feet of his to meet the first ball of the over at the point of 
pitching, lifting it over midwicket for a boundary. And two more in that 
general direction to end the over raises Australia’s 100.

30th over: Australia 94-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 18) Smith straight off strike to 
Rabada, a single off the pads. Only takes two balls for Rabada to beat 
Renshaw’s bat. And again. It’s going to be a ~talking point~ you can be sure of 
that.

29th over: Australia 93-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 17) Renshaw finding his groove 
against the spin now, twice taking Shamsi through midwicket for two. 34 left 
now for the Australians. Suspect we’ll be seeing an extra half hour (or as much 
of it as is required) rather than getting a long break when the time comes 29 
minutes from now. Meanwhile, that’s a (Cowan) ton for Renshaw on debut!
Geoff Lemon Sport (@GeoffLemonSport) 
Matt Renshaw, spoken of as a player who can bat time like Ed Cowan, raises a 
Cowan ton at Adelaide. 100 balls faced. Played.

28th over: Australia 89-2 (Renshaw 20, Smith 17) Rabada back on from the 
Cathedral or Northern End. Smith has seen first hand how threatening he can be 
late in the day, so he’s defending throughout the maiden. Nothing silly here 
from the Skip. Like all good captains, he’d love to be out there at the end.

27th over: Australia 89-2 (Renshaw 20, Smith 17) Shamsi has Renshaw down the 
business end and so continues the spell. He remains a real and present threat 
to the left-hander, who isagain beaten outside the line. But I’d counter that 
by noting that, again, he’s well inside the line. It doesn’t look pretty, but 
he’s nowhere near these, suggesting that it’s at least in part something he has 
some control over once the ball takes off from the track, be it against spin or 
seam. 96 balls faced now.

26th over: Australia 89-2 (Renshaw 20, Smith 17) Just under 20,000 here at the 
Adelaide Oval. Makes it 125,993 for the match. Pretty healthy. Renshaw bounces 
back from that review with a couple taken past square leg then a single to fine 
leg. Between times he was beaten outside the off-stump for the umpteenth time. 
It’s another very good bit of bowling, straightening away from the left-hander 
from around the wicket. Big of a debate on radio about whether the pink ball 
concept will be retained for Adelaide next year for the Ashes Test. It’s very 
clear thatCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Australia and the 
SACA are in support. These four days must have helped. It’s been an excellent 
Test Match with bat and ball pretty evenly matched. Can’t ask for much more 
than that. Strong views out there? Hit me with them.

NOT OUT! Contact outside the line is the DRS verdict, Richard Kettleborough 
again has it right. Indeed, in this series he’s never had it wrong. Pretty good 
an umpiring.

25th over: Australia 86-2 (Renshaw 17, Smith 17) Smith is feasting on Shamsi, 
and wish so few runs available to the Proteas from here I suspect he won’t get 
back on if it’s Smith he’s scheduled to bowl to next time up. He seems to lose 
his way whenever bowling to the Aussie skipper. This time around, a short ball 
is put away half way through an over, and then happens all over again to end 
the set. He’s caught up to Renshaw already.

24th over: Australia 78-2 (Renshaw 17, Smith 9) Philander taking on Renshaw 
from around the wicket. A couple of blocks, a few leaves. It’s a maiden. 
Renshaw has made his 17 from 84 balls, and that’ll inspire some. But I fancy it 
won’t take long before it’ll annoy a certain section of Australian fans who 
favour the crush, kill, destroy approach.

23rd over: Australia 78-2 (Renshaw 17, Smith 9) It’s Shamsi bouncing away from 
us at the Southern End to restart after the drink. Renshaw’s into his happy 
place, watching the first three deliveries sail past his off-stump. Not tempted 
for even a moment. He’s defence to negate the spin off the front foot once 
Shamsi brings his line straighter. But then he gets one to reeeeeally go, 
pitching middle and turning significantly, past the edge. He misses it by a 
long way suggesting that he was happy to play inside the line. A single tucked 
into the onside ends the set. Good cricket, this.

22nd over: Australia 77-2 (Renshaw 16, Smith 9) Philander has the last over 
before drinks. It’s not where he needs to be to Smith though, who relishes the 
chance to pull a genuine half-tracker. He grabs two more when Vern slips onto 
his pads. That puts a nice little dent in the runs required column, which reads 
50 by the end of the over. They’ll have a cordial on that.

Ball that got Khawaja for a duck did turn, but only by 0.8°

Batsman expected more turn (Shamsi's average turn is 3.1°)#ausvsa

21st over: Australia 71-2 (Renshaw 16, Smith 3) Smith enjoyed Shamsi on day 
two, and does again immediately here pulling hard behind square. Too short. 
Renshaw much better in response to the spin than he was the previous time they 
shaped up against each other before those couple of wickets.

20th over: Australia 68-2 (Renshaw 16, Smith 0) Philander not immediately on 
the mark, Renshaw taking advantage of an overpitched delivery to stroke a 
compact cover drive to the rope. Stylish, even. Back to where he started by the 
end of the set, leaving with a big stride and watchful eye.
cricket.com.au (@CricketAus) 
That's a glorious drive from Renshaw for four more!

19th over: Australia 64-2 (Renshaw 12, Smith 0) That’s a wicket maiden, in 
case this wasn’t obvious. Big Vern Phillander is taking off his cap at the 
Cathedral End now as well. One more big push from the South Africans coming up 
here. Especially with Renshaw looking a tad vulnerable.

WICKET! Khawaja lbw Shamsi 0 (Australia 64-2)

That’s a wonderful bit of bowling from Shamsi, a wrong’un in the end beating 
Khawaja’s inside edge. Just enough of the ball was hitting the top end of 
off-stump to overturn the decision on review. Two wickets in the over. Well 
then. Here comes the captain. Still 63 to win.

Review! Faf gives Shamsi the DRS referral he demands after hitting Khawaja on 
the front pad. Straight one. Looks close. Stand by...

WICKET! Warner run out (Bavuma) 47 (Australia 64-1)

Oh Davey! What doing man? Pulls Shamsi square and just takes off. He has to 
turn back, in full knowledge that the alternative approach would be to saw off 
the debutant. Bavuma only has to lob it into de Kock for the run out to be 
completed, Warner a long way short. Australia require 63 to win with nine 
wickets in hand if you think Australia still have the epic collapse somewhere 
deep inside.

18th over: Australia 64-0 (Renshaw 12, Warner 47) This is getting fun now, the 
regularity in which Renshaw is playing and missing. Abbott won’t be laughing, 
beating the newbie’s edge again. Shrugs of shoulders from the batsmen. It’s 
fine, unlucky bowling.

17th over: Australia 64-0 (Renshaw 12, Warner 47) Warner happy to take a look 
at Shamsi here as he chucks a couple up, giving them a rip. As I said yesterday 
on the OBO, his numbers won’t show it but he hasn’t had a bad debut for mine. 
Big appeal for lbw! But turned down by Umpire Llong. No review. That’s a pretty 
good maiden.

16th over: Australia 64-0 (Renshaw 12, Warner 47) Three more for Warner to 
start the Abbott over, this time driving through cover. Easy peasy. Thereafter 
Renshaw is forced to defend, duck and leave. But then he’s beaten again to 
finish the over. That’s happening a lot at the moment, but to be fair to him he 
misses them by some margin, playing down the line rather than following the 
ball with the bat. In other words, if you’re going to play and miss this isn’t 
a bad way to go about it. If he can be there at the end, it would be passing an 
early character test.

15th over: Australia 61-0 (Renshaw 12, Warner 44) Warner is sweeping and and 
driving the left arm spin, picking up three easy runs and popping Renshaw back 
on strike. But it’s a matchup that suits the spinner, beating him with spin 
outside the off-stump then winning a leading edge to finish the set. Nice 
bowling. All told, Renshaw a fraction less convincing in this innings than the 
one that came before it. Which in a sense makes it more impressive for the fact 
that he’s still there after 50 balls. Keep going, big boy.

14th over: Australia 58-0 (Renshaw 12, Warner 41) Renshaw cops an unplayable 
from Abbott, around the wicket shaping in then cutting away ala Flintoff v 
Gilchrist in the 2005 Ashes. Rogers on the radio commentary is offering handy 
technical insight to the new bloke. He’s not completely sold on how he crosses 
his front foot over the back before addressing the ball, believing it could 
become a handbrake on his strokeplay. But then again, Alastair Cook only has 
three shots, as they say. What he does do well: timing it off his pads. Abbott 
slips onto them and it is a boundary, his second. Abbott bounces back quickly 
though, beating him twice outside the off-stump. Good battle. I think we’re 
about to see spin from the Southern End.

13th over: Australia 54-0 (Renshaw 8, Warner 41) This is Warner at his best. 
Through cover his drive didn’t go the journey, but they scampered four anyway. 
That hurts a fielding side. Next ball the legs weren’t required though, 
flicking Rabada through midwicket with glorious timing. Australia’s 50 is up. 
The first half century stand between these two at the first time of asking at 
the top of the order as well. Very good early signs.

12th over: Australia 44-0 (Renshaw 7, Warner 33) As soon as I say that, Warner 
gets himself beaten with a lose looking flay through the offside. Keeping with 
that theme, he doesn’t get all of the pull shot he attempts next up, but it’s 
safe and two are scored. Then Abbott beats him with a beaut. Never dull, our 
Davey.

Back to the women at Coffs Harbour, Perry is unbeaten in the 60s now. That 
makes it 16 half centuries in her last 22 ODI hits. After only making one 
before this run (where she averages 98) started. Ethan Meldrum has graphed this 
nicely. What a gun.

11th over: Australia 42-0 (Renshaw 7, Warner 31) Warner crunches Rabada 
through midwicket when dropping short to begin the over. Not good bowling, he 
doesn’t miss out there. And he does it again two balls later; slightly squarer, 
same result. Rabada has had an outstanding series, but he’s letting the skipper 
down there with so few runs to play with. Let’s do some maths. Now, I don’t 
want to get ahead of myself, but I like the early call: Australia need 85 and 
Warner 69 for a century. This isn’t completely ridiculous if Renshaw is riding 
shotgun for the duration.

10th over: Australia 33-0 (Renshaw 7, Warner 22) Warner pushes Abbott’s first 
ball after tea into the covers to give the strike straight back to Renshaw. 
Chris Rogers explaining on the radio that the Renshaw technique, getting well 
across to the off-stump, might limit his strokeplay. But it sure is effective 
for picking up the line and letting through to the ‘keeper as Abbott nags away 
at that fifth stump line from around the wicket.

9th over: Australia 32-0 (Renshaw 7, Warner 21) Renshaw sees a full toss on 
his pads and whips it through midwicket for his first runs of the session. 
Inside 100 for the win now. It came at the end of a Rabada over that was good 
enough to beat the bat early, but beyond that was happy shouldering arms. A joy 
to watch.

afternoon with a few games running at the same time. On the radio it was down 
to Al Martello at Waverley. Swan Mackay from Princes Park. The Galloping 
Gasometer down at Moorabbin or Victoria Park or the Western Oval or Geelong.

Sure enough with chat like this, it is Adam Collins with you here for what may 
very well be the last session of this Australia v South Africa series here at 
Adelaide. It’s been smashing. And we’ll get to that in a minute, but for now 
let’s embrace what we have this Sunday afternoon: a buffet of cricket.

In Mohali the English were rock and rolled by 283 early on the second morning. 
Young Jonny Bairstow didn’t add to his overnight 89. Big Bad Ben Stokes - 
already in strife for some scallywag behaviour yesterday - has an early 
breakthrough in reply for the visitors, India 1-for-44.

Across the ditch at Hamilton it was a rain effected third day, but a result is 
still on the cards with New Zealand 271 versus Pakistan 216 at the end of their 
respective first innings. Babar Azam made an unbeaten 90 in just his second 
Test. We’ll see him in Brisbane in a couple of weeks. And Tim Southee picked up 
6fer with the ball.

Up in Coffs Harbour the Australian women are into their fourth ODI rubber 
against South Africa, having already stitched up the series 3-nil. The hosts 
are 152-4 after 37, Nicole Bolton collecting a half century at the top of the 
list.

In the Sheffield Shield, Victoria are 195-5 in reply to South Australia’s 405. 
Travis Head made a ton for the SACAs. NSW declared on 495-5 and have Tassie 
53-4. Peter Nevill responded emphatically to his removal from the Australian 
team with a big unbeaten century there. And in Townsville, Queensland are in a 
commanding position, posting 422 against WA who are 115-2 in their response.

With the players readying themselves to return here at the Adelaide Oval, 
that’ll do us. Let’s play.

Tea - Australia trail by exactly 100 with 10 wickets in hand

It should be straightforward, unless there’s another collapse, but Australia 
won’t be celebrating yet. This new-look side has to make sure it finishes off 
the job. A good bowling performance this mornign restricted the lead to 127, 
then a good opening partnership scored runs and got safely to the break. Matt 
Renshaw is happy to take the first ball and then let David Warner score all the 
runs, so he and Warner should get along just fine.

Geoff Lemon with you, but leaving your company with a tear in my eye, as I 
reluctantly hand the baton to my colleague Adam Collins. I know that he’ll take 
care of you. But I hope that you think of me, from time to time, and I hope 
that, just maybe, you smile.

8th over: Australia 27-0 (Warner 20, Renshaw 3)


Last over before tea, and Shamsi is brought on to see if an over of left-arm 
wristies can cause any consternation. Not for the batting side, as Shamsi 
offers too much width. Warner cuts a couple, then doubles down and cuts four 
more. Flicks a single to fine leg, Renshaw blocks out the last couple, and the 
bails are flicked off by the greatest umpire in the land.

Vernon Philander is the Man of the Series. 

He didn’t get the gong in either of their wins, but it is a logical decision 
for the work he did across the three Tests. Outstanding.

Steve Smith is up at the presentation now. “I am very pleased and proud of how 
the boys stood up this game,” he says. “It was obviously a disappointing start 
to the series and we were outplayed... but I’m proud of how the boys turned it 
around.”

Smith adds that he’s pleased that two debutants were in the middle at the end. 
Nice touch, wasn’t it?

Next up on stage is the winning series captain, Faf du Plessis. “It’s pretty 
disappointing that we didn’t win the Test Match also hard to look past the fact 
that we had already won the series. I’m a very satisfied captain,” he says. “It 
is very easy to captain with a bowling attack like that.”

Faf’s a fan of the day/night Tests too. Says he likes it more than he 
expected. That’s a pretty good endorsement from the captain of the losing side, 
I reckon. And now they’re up to lift the trophy. Big smiles. Big victory. Well 
played.

You know what, I might leave it there. It’s been quite a match and quite a 
series. Huge turnover in the Australian side, masterful bowling from the 
tourists. I doubt we’ll forget it in a hurry. Thanks for all your company 
across the Tests, it’s been very much appreciated.

For our part, we’ll be back with the OBO for Guardian Australian in the 
Chappell-Hadlee ODIs coming up in the first week of December. Until then. 
Goodnight from Adelaide Oval.

Australia snap losing streak with consolation Test win over South Africa

While the players gather for the presentation. 

A win for Australia with their remodelled XI. It could be said that they have 
come a very long way in the space of a Test Match. But with Pakistan ahead, 
considered assessments might be best at the end of the summer. Still, it’s a 
start. And the hosts really did earn this win, with excellent bowling across 
the match the defining Khawaja ton.

Usman Khawaja is the man of the much. “He solidifies the top of the order,” he 
says of the new man Renshaw. “Hopefully this will lead into a big series 
against Pakistan because there’s a lot of work to do there.” He’s not wrong.

Matt Renshaw is on the ABC now: “It has been amazing, trying to embrace it all 
and have a lot of fun,” he says. “I was just trying to have find but once the 
crowd got going that was the hard part. I had to just keep myself grounded and 
not play something stupid.”
 
Peter Handscomb, the man who had such a hand in giving Australia a healthy 
first innings lead, hits the winning runs. It takes a few attempts after 
getting the strike, nearly giving a return catch. But it matters little when he 
finds the gap at midwicket and claims the win. Handshakes all around.
 
40th over: Australia 125-3 (Renshaw 33, Handscomb 0) It looked like they were 
going to get it that over too before the captain fell to the last ball, Smith 
picking up four through the cordon after a couple by midwicket. But now, as 
noted before, it’ll be a rookie. Shamsi has the ball.
 
Smith is fuming. It’s a great bit of bowling from Abbott, two runs short of 
the win. After all those plays and misses from Renshaw, the captain gets a 
feather. Handscomb out to the middle means that one of these two will get to 
hit the winning runs on debut. Nice. A handy knock from Smith, by the way.
 
39th over: Australia 119-2 (Renshaw 33, Smith 34) Oh this is brilliant, the 
crowd are livid when Smith takes one. Even in the press box there is a cry of 
“No!”. But when he times the next Shamsi delivery off his pads through the 
onside for four? An enthusiastic round of applause! 31 balls he spent on 24. A 
single - indeed a dropped catch at slip - earns more cheers. Then when he goes 
down the ground foranother boundary it’s all-but a standing ovation! Test 
cricket... wouldn’t have it any other way. Eight to win now.

38th over: Australia 108-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 32) Smith take Abbott’s first 
ball of a new spell to midwicket putting Renshaw on strike. The crowd probably 
aren’t enjoying the prospect of Renshaw batting out the over to dinner, 
ensuring the long break will take place you would have to think? We will see. 
By half way through the over the slow clapping has begu, and Renshaw... is on 
front foot defending. Glorious. I can only imagine some corners of twitter at 
the moment. He’s beaten by the penultimate delivery, just to stick with the 
theme, a very good one from Abbott, again missed by quite a decent margin. He 
defends the last ball into the offside. Is that... dinner? No, it is not! We 
will continue on.
Ric Finlay (@RicFinlay) 
Critics of Aus team have been crying out for a player who will value his 
wicket like Renshaw does.

37th over: Australia 107-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 31) Bronx cheer of sorts goes up 
when the board ticks over for the first time in a while, Smith pulling Shamsi 
for a couple. He follows it with a single to cover. That doesn’t modify the 
Renshaw approach, who has 11 scoring shots in nearly 130 balls now. Defending 
and leaving, even when Shamsi goes around the wicket to provoke a stroke. The 
crowd are egging him on to do something slightly more. Suggestion through the 
stump mic that the South Africans want him to have a crack as well. Good luck 
with that, don’t think he cares.
 
36th over: Australia 104-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 28) Back to back maidens might 
encourage the umpires to actually take dinner at the scheduled time? That’s 
only an over or two away, and they need to be confident of a result within 15 
minutes (or four overs). It was Rabada to Renshaw, by the way. You can probably 
guess how it played out, a couple of leaves, a couple of defensive strokes and 
a play and miss. Essentially Renshaw at a glance this afternoon.

35th over: Australia 104-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 28) Shamsi to Smith. There’s a 
play and miss in the early in the over, which governs a more conservative 
approach for the remainder of it. A maiden. Still, not far away now. 23 runs to 
be precise.
 
34th over: Australia 104-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 28) Lovely Smith cover drive 
nets him three. Haven’t seen much of that today. His signature when in full 
flight. He hasn’t dominated the series nor made a ton, but he looks ready for 
something like that in the second half of the summer when Pakistan arrive.
 
33rd over: Australia 101-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 25) Shamsi and Smith has brought 
about a certain outcome in this match so far, but less here. I think Smith has 
put it away now, result assured. He’ll be happy to do this in singles just 
about. He gets one of those to end the over and retain the strike, around the 
corner with the full face of the bat.
 
32nd over: Australia 100-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 24) Rabada and Renshaw resume 
their contest. He’s only given one chance to bust out his favoured leave this 
time around, Rabada straightening up his line. But the Renshaw defence is up to 
the challenge. A maiden. We’re nearing dinner, but there’ll be no dinner as 
this session will be extended.
 
31st over: Australia 100-2 (Renshaw 24, Smith 24) It’s too easy for Smith when 
Shamsi has the ball. It’s been a mismatch from the get go. The former uses 
those fancy feet of his to meet the first ball of the over at the point of 
pitching, lifting it over midwicket for a boundary. And two more in that 
general direction to end the over raises Australia’s 100.

that.

against the spin now, twice taking Shamsi through midwicket for two. 34 left 
now for the Australians. Suspect we’ll be seeing an extra half hour (or as much 
of it as is required) rather than getting a long break when the time comes 29 
minutes from now. Meanwhile, that’s a (Cowan) ton for Renshaw on debut!

28th over: Australia 89-2 (Renshaw 20, Smith 17) Rabada back on from the 
Cathedral or Northern End. Smith has seen first hand how threatening he can be 
late in the day, so he’s defending throughout the maiden. Nothing silly here 
from the Skip. Like all good captains, he’d love to be out there at the end.
 
27th over: Australia 89-2 (Renshaw 20, Smith 17) Shamsi has Renshaw down the 
business end and so continues the spell. He remains a real and present threat 
to the left-hander, who isagain beaten outside the line. But I’d counter that 
by noting that, again, he’s well inside the line. It doesn’t look pretty, but 
he’s nowhere near these, suggesting that it’s at least in part something he has 
some control over once the ball takes off from the track, be it against spin or 
seam. 96 balls faced now.
 
26th over: Australia 89-2 (Renshaw 20, Smith 17) Just under 20,000 here at the 
Adelaide Oval. Makes it 125,993 for the match. Pretty healthy. Renshaw bounces 
back from that review with a couple taken past square leg then a single to fine 
leg. Between times he was beaten outside the off-stump for the umpteenth time. 
It’s another very good bit of bowling, straightening away from the left-hander 
from around the wicket. Big of a debate on radio about whether the pink ball 
concept will be retained for Adelaide next year for the Ashes Test. It’s very 
clear thatCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Australia and the 
SACA are in support. These four days must have helped. It’s been an excellent 
Test Match with bat and ball pretty evenly matched. Can’t ask for much more 
than that. Strong views out there? Hit me with them.
 
NOT OUT! Contact outside the line is the DRS verdict, Richard Kettleborough 
again has it right. Indeed, in this series he’s never had it wrong. Pretty good 
an umpiring.
 
Review! Not out on the field, but Philander thinks he’s nabbed Renshaw lbw. 
Upstairs we go.
 
25th over: Australia 86-2 (Renshaw 17, Smith 17) Smith is feasting on Shamsi, 
and wish so few runs available to the Proteas from here I suspect he won’t get 
back on if it’s Smith he’s scheduled to bowl to next time up. He seems to lose 
his way whenever bowling to the Aussie skipper. This time around, a short ball 
is put away half way through an over, and then happens all over again to end 
the set. He’s caught up to Renshaw already.
 
24th over: Australia 78-2 (Renshaw 17, Smith 9) Philander taking on Renshaw 
from around the wicket. A couple of blocks, a few leaves. It’s a maiden. 
Renshaw has made his 17 from 84 balls, and that’ll inspire some. But I fancy it 
won’t take long before it’ll annoy a certain section of Australian fans who 
favour the crush, kill, destroy approach.
 
23rd over: Australia 78-2 (Renshaw 17, Smith 9) It’s Shamsi bouncing away from 
us at the Southern End to restart after the drink. Renshaw’s into his happy 
place, watching the first three deliveries sail past his off-stump. Not tempted 
for even a moment. He’s defence to negate the spin off the front foot once 
Shamsi brings his line straighter. But then he gets one to reeeeeally go, 
pitching middle and turning significantly, past the edge. He misses it by a 
long way suggesting that he was happy to play inside the line. A single tucked 
into the onside ends the set. Good cricket, this.
 
22nd over: Australia 77-2 (Renshaw 16, Smith 9) Philander has the last over 
before drinks. It’s not where he needs to be to Smith though, who relishes the 
chance to pull a genuine half-tracker. He grabs two more when Vern slips onto 
his pads. That puts a nice little dent in the runs required column, which reads 
50 by the end of the over. They’ll have a cordial on that.

Ball that got Khawaja for a duck did turn, but only by 0.8°

21st over: Australia 71-2 (Renshaw 16, Smith 3) Smith enjoyed Shamsi on day 
two, and does again immediately here pulling hard behind square. Too short. 
Renshaw much better in response to the spin than he was the previous time they 
shaped up against each other before those couple of wickets.
 
20th over: Australia 68-2 (Renshaw 16, Smith 0) Philander not immediately on 
the mark, Renshaw taking advantage of an overpitched delivery to stroke a 
compact cover drive to the rope. Stylish, even. Back to where he started by the 
end of the set, leaving with a big stride and watchful eye.

That's a glorious drive from Renshaw for four more!

19th over: Australia 64-2 (Renshaw 12, Smith 0) That’s a wicket maiden, in 
case this wasn’t obvious. Big Vern Phillander is taking off his cap at the 
Cathedral End now as well. One more big push from the South Africans coming up 
here. Especially with Renshaw looking a tad vulnerable.
 
That’s a wonderful bit of bowling from Shamsi, a wrong’un in the end beating 
Khawaja’s inside edge. Just enough of the ball was hitting the top end of 
off-stump to overturn the decision on review. Two wickets in the over. Well 
then. Here comes the captain. Still 63 to win.
 
Review! Faf gives Shamsi the DRS referral he demands after hitting Khawaja on 
the front pad. Straight one. Looks close. Stand by...
 
Oh Davey! What doing man? Pulls Shamsi square and just takes off. He has to 
turn back, in full knowledge that the alternative approach would be to saw off 
the debutant. Bavuma only has to lob it into de Kock for the run out to be 
completed, Warner a long way short. Australia require 63 to win with nine 
wickets in hand if you think Australia still have the epic collapse somewhere 
deep inside.
 
18th over: Australia 64-0 (Renshaw 12, Warner 47) This is getting fun now, the 
regularity in which Renshaw is playing and missing. Abbott won’t be laughing, 
beating the newbie’s edge again. Shrugs of shoulders from the batsmen. It’s 
fine, unlucky bowling.
 
17th over: Australia 64-0 (Renshaw 12, Warner 47) Warner happy to take a look 
at Shamsi here as he chucks a couple up, giving them a rip. As I said yesterday 
on the OBO, his numbers won’t show it but he hasn’t had a bad debut for mine. 
Big appeal for lbw! But turned down by Umpire Llong. No review. That’s a pretty 
good maiden.
 
16th over: Australia 64-0 (Renshaw 12, Warner 47) Three more for Warner to 
start the Abbott over, this time driving through cover. Easy peasy. Thereafter 
Renshaw is forced to defend, duck and leave. But then he’s beaten again to 
finish the over. That’s happening a lot at the moment, but to be fair to him he 
misses them by some margin, playing down the line rather than following the 
ball with the bat. In other words, if you’re going to play and miss this isn’t 
a bad way to go about it. If he can be there at the end, it would be passing an 
early character test.

15th over: Australia 61-0 (Renshaw 12, Warner 44) Warner is sweeping and and 
driving the left arm spin, picking up three easy runs and popping Renshaw back 
on strike. But it’s a matchup that suits the spinner, beating him with spin 
outside the off-stump then winning a leading edge to finish the set. Nice 
bowling. All told, Renshaw a fraction less convincing in this innings than the 
one that came before it. Which in a sense makes it more impressive for the fact 
that he’s still there after 50 balls. Keep going, big boy.

14th over: Australia 58-0 (Renshaw 12, Warner 41) Renshaw cops an unplayable 
from Abbott, around the wicket shaping in then cutting away ala Flintoff v 
Gilchrist in the 2005 Ashes. Rogers on the radio commentary is offering handy 
technical insight to the new bloke. He’s not completely sold on how he crosses 
his front foot over the back before addressing the ball, believing it could 
become a handbrake on his strokeplay. But then again, Alastair Cook only has 
three shots, as they say. What he does do well: timing it off his pads. Abbott 
slips onto them and it is a boundary, his second. Abbott bounces back quickly 
though, beating him twice outside the off-stump. Good battle. I think we’re 
about to see spin from the Southern End.
 
13th over: Australia 54-0 (Renshaw 8, Warner 41) This is Warner at his best. 
Through cover his drive didn’t go the journey, but they scampered four anyway. 
That hurts a fielding side. Next ball the legs weren’t required though, 
flicking Rabada through midwicket with glorious timing. Australia’s 50 is up. 
The first half century stand between these two at the first time of asking at 
the top of the order as well. Very good early signs.
 
12th over: Australia 44-0 (Renshaw 7, Warner 33) As soon as I say that, Warner 
gets himself beaten with a lose looking flay through the offside. Keeping with 
that theme, he doesn’t get all of the pull shot he attempts next up, but it’s 
safe and two are scored. Then Abbott beats him with a beaut. Never dull, our 
Davey.

Back to the women at Coffs Harbour, Perry is unbeaten in the 60s now. That 
makes it 16 half centuries in her last 22 ODI hits. After only making one 
before this run (where she averages 98) started. Ethan Meldrum has graphed this 
nicely. What a gun.

11th over: Australia 42-0 (Renshaw 7, Warner 31) Warner crunches Rabada 
through midwicket when dropping short to begin the over. Not good bowling, he 
doesn’t miss out there. And he does it again two balls later; slightly squarer, 
same result. Rabada has had an outstanding series, but he’s letting the skipper 
down there with so few runs to play with. Let’s do some maths. Now, I don’t 
want to get ahead of myself, but I like the early call: Australia need 85 and 
Warner 69 for a century. This isn’t completely ridiculous if Renshaw is riding 
shotgun for the duration.
 
10th over: Australia 33-0 (Renshaw 7, Warner 22) Warner pushes Abbott’s first 
ball after tea into the covers to give the strike straight back to Renshaw. 
Chris Rogers explaining on the radio that the Renshaw technique, getting well 
across to the off-stump, might limit his strokeplay. But it sure is effective 
for picking up the line and letting through to the ‘keeper as Abbott nags away 
at that fifth stump line from around the wicket.

9th over: Australia 32-0 (Renshaw 7, Warner 21) Renshaw sees a full toss on 
his pads and whips it through midwicket for his first runs of the session. 
Inside 100 for the win now. It came at the end of a Rabada over that was good 
enough to beat the bat early, but beyond that was happy shouldering arms. A joy 
to watch.
 
Shall we go... around the grounds?

Remember when that was a thing? You’d be at the football on a Saturday 
afternoon with a few games running at the same time. On the radio it was down 
to Al Martello at Waverley. Swan Mackay from Princes Park. The Galloping 
Gasometer down at Moorabbin or Victoria Park or the Western Oval or Geelong.

Sure enough with chat like this, it is Adam Collins with you here for what may 
very well be the last session of this Australia v South Africa series here at 
Adelaide. It’s been smashing. And we’ll get to that in a minute, but for now 
let’s embrace what we have this Sunday afternoon: a buffet of cricket.

In Mohali the English were rock and rolled by 283 early on the second morning. 
Young Jonny Bairstow didn’t add to his overnight 89. Big Bad Ben Stokes - 
already in strife for some scallywag behaviour yesterday - has an early 
breakthrough in reply for the visitors, India 1-for-44.

Across the ditch at Hamilton it was a rain effected third day, but a result is 
still on the cards with New Zealand 271 versus Pakistan 216 at the end of their 
respective first innings. Babar Azam made an unbeaten 90 in just his second 
Test. We’ll see him in Brisbane in a couple of weeks. And Tim Southee picked up 
6fer with the ball.

Up in Coffs Harbour the Australian women are into their fourth ODI rubber 
against South Africa, having already stitched up the series 3-nil. The hosts 
are 152-4 after 37, Nicole Bolton collecting a half century at the top of the 
list.

In the Sheffield Shield, Victoria are 195-5 in reply to South Australia’s 405. 
Travis Head made a ton for the SACAs. NSW declared on 495-5 and have Tassie 
53-4. Peter Nevill responded emphatically to his removal from the Australian 
team with a big unbeaten century there. And in Townsville, Queensland are in a 
commanding position, posting 422 against WA who are 115-2 in their response.

With the players readying themselves to return here at the Adelaide Oval, 
that’ll do us. Let’s play.

 
It should be straightforward, unless there’s another collapse, but Australia 
won’t be celebrating yet. This new-look side has to make sure it finishes off 
the job. A good bowling performance this mornign restricted the lead to 127, 
then a good opening partnership scored runs and got safely to the break. Matt 
Renshaw is happy to take the first ball and then let David Warner score all the 
runs, so he and Warner should get along just fine.

Geoff Lemon with you, but leaving your company with a tear in my eye, as I 
reluctantly hand the baton to my colleague Adam Collins. I know that he’ll take 
care of you. But I hope that you think of me, from time to time, and I hope 
that, just maybe, you smile.
 
8th over: Australia 27-0 (Warner 20, Renshaw 3)


Last over before tea, and Shamsi is brought on to see if an over of left-arm 
wristies can cause any consternation. Not for the batting side, as Shamsi 
offers too much width. Warner cuts a couple, then doubles down and cuts four 
more. Flicks a single to fine leg, Renshaw blocks out the last couple, and the 
bails are flicked off by the greatest umpire in the land.
