Right that’s it from me. It was rarely as enthralling as that close scoreline 
suggests, to be honest. It always felt as though RCB’s score was around 10 
below par and that MS Dhoni had it under control all along. Credit has to go to 
the CSK bowlers, Ashish Nehra with 3-28 especially, and Mike Hussey for his 56 
from 46 balls.

Chennai go through to Sunday’s final, where they will play Mumbai Indians. 
Again. Do join me for that one. Cheers for reading. Bye!

CSK win by three wickets

19.5 overs: CSK 140-7 (Ashwin 1, Jadeja 0) One needed from the last two. It’s 
full on middle and Ashwin just leans into it and knocks it square on the leg 
side for the winning run!

19.1 overs: CSK 137-6 (Dhoni 24, Jadeja 0) three to win So we go to a final 
over, Jadeja is the new man. Harshal Patel, with five runs to defend, is the 
bowler. Slapped down the ground to long off; it should only be one, but Kohli’s 
return throw is a touch lax and they get back for two.

19 overs: CSK 135-6 (Dhoni 22) five to win Bravo strides out. And strolls back

Wicket! Negi run out 12

18.5 overs: CSK 135-5 (Dhoni 22) five to win Yorker dug out to cover. They go 
for the single but Negi is miles short as Sarfaraz hits directly.

18th over: CSK 127-4 (Dhoni 15, Negi 11) target 140 27 needed from 18 balls. 
Dhoni reduces that target by one, then Negi reduces it by six with an absolute 
monster of a slog, high but also a good way over mid on. Harshal Patel is the 
bowler, by the way. Negi tries again a couple of balls later, but just drags it 
along the floor to mid on for one. Ooh Dhoni then gets lucky, inside edging on 
to his pads and they dash through for one more – that could so easily have gone 
into the stumps. Negi smears the final ball out to extra cover, where Starc 
comes around to keep them to a couple. 13 needed from 12 balls. Let’s go 
ball-by ball, yeah?

17th over: CSK 113-4 (Dhoni 13, Negi 0) target 140 Kohli decides to hold Starc 
back until the death, as you’d expect, but it might be too late now. No sooner 
have I typed that than Hussey goes, but as long as Dhoni’s there then CSK 
should still do this. A slower ball goes beneath the low bottom edge of MS’s 
bat and nutmegs Karthik, allowing the batsmen three byes.

Wicket! Hussey c H Patel b Wiese 56

A great innings comes to an end. Wiese drops short, Hussey tries to pull but 
top edges it and the ball loops to midwicket.

16th over: CSK 106-3 (Dhoni 10, Hussey 55) target 140 Chahal again. Hussey 
sashays down the pitch to his first ball, backs away to leg and smacks it back 
down the ground for six. He tries again next ball, but Chahal sees him coming 
and pushes it a bit wider, so Hussey can only bunt to mid off for one. Another 
single to Dhoni, then Hussey charges again but can only screw it off the inside 
edge to Sarfaraz at mid on. No run for that, but six from the next as Hussey 
slog sweeps over mid on for six!

15th over: CSK 91-3 (Dhoni 9, Hussey 41) target 140 Speaking of Starc (look, 
read the last entry), here he is again. It’s probably best for CSK to just keep 
things ticking over here and see off Starc, before targeting the other seamers. 
Indeed that’s what they do here: a single from each of the over’s six balls.

14th over: CSK 85-3 (Dhoni 6, Hussey 38) target 140 Back comes Chahal. His 
overs and Starc’s will be crucial, you imagine. Dhoni isn’t even bothering with 
a cap against the spinner; that might be because of the heatwave they’re 
apparently going through out there. Just one from the first four balls, then 
Hussey gets a leading edge in the air, but too far to the bowler’s right for it 
to be a c&b chance. One run from that, one run to Dhoni down to long on and the 
required rate is now above nine. CSK are still favourites in my book.

13th over: CSK 82-3 (Dhoni 4, Hussey 37) target 140 Kohli turns back to 
Aravind. They probably need a couple more wickets in the next three overs or so 
to win this, do RCB. I mean, if ever there was a pair in the post-Bevan era you 
wanted to see you home, it’s these two. Hussey picks up a pair of twos, then 
Aravind drops short and on leg stump, and Hussey whips the pull round the 
corner for four more. Singles from each of the last two balls make 10 from the 
over.

12th over: CSK 72-3 (Dhoni 3, Hussey 28) target 140 Wiese has been the least 
effective of the RCB bowlers so far today – 18 from his two overs so far. This 
is a risky move from Kohli, holding back his strike bowlers with a new batsman 
at the crease. Wiese goes too full to Hussey and rightly gets driven through 
extra cover for four. Eight off the over, which is around about up there with 
the required rate. I think this one’s going down to the wire, folks.

11th over: CSK 64-3 (Dhoni 1, Hussey 22) target 140 This is probably a crucial 
innings for Dhoni; if he goes cheaply then RCB might just do this. Harshal 
Patel is back into the attack, having conceded just five from his first over. 
Hussey gets a single to give Dhoni the strike and he gets off the mark from the 
fourth ball of his innings, a dab down to third man for it. Two from the over. 
Oh and it looks like Hussey has had his score corrected somehow. Er, not sure 
what happened there.

10th over: CSK 62-3 (Dhoni 0, Hussey 23) target 140 After adverts, Hussey goes 
after Chahal, slogging him up in the air over mid off. It plugs though and 
Starc jogs round, dives and flaps it back in to keep them for three. Faf is 
bowled the very next ball, exposing his stumps and losing them. Raina only 
lasts two, which brings the Microsoft man to the crease.

Is this on? Surely it’s not on. Raina goes big second ball, trying to hit down 
the ground and into the stands, but just picks out the man on the straight 
boundary.

Wicket! du Plessis b Chahal 21

Once again, du Plessis goes for the premeditated used-to-be-called-a-Dilscoop. 
This time though he misses it, it’s an arm ball and over goes leg stump.

9th over: CSK 58-1 (du Plessis 17, Hussey 21) target 140 Another half chance 
as de Villiers swoops in from cover, picks up, dives and throws off target with 
Hussey short. Du Plessis responds with what was once called the Dilscoop, a 
premeditated little shovel over his shoulder for four. And the same amount 
comes from the final ball, bunted down the ground.

8th over: CSK 47-1 (du Plessis 12, Hussey 15) target 140 Time for some spin, 
with Chahal being brought in. More poor fielding as du Plessis hesitates in 
calling for a run and Hussey is a goner if de Villiers – of all people – 
doesn’t throw the ball a couple of feet behind the stumps. He does that, 
though. Two more to deep extra cover when, yep, there’s a fumble.

7th over: CSK 41-1 (du Plessis 8, Hussey 13) target 140 Wiese into the attack 
now and he begins with a wide, drifted listlessly outside of the tramlines on 
the off side. then a couple of balls later, perhaps a drop? I can’t see any 
edge, but, after it clatters out of Karthik’s gloves – unacceptable, really, at 
Wiese’s pace – and the batsmen jog through for one, the umpire gives it as 
runs. Then a ridiculous wide off what should have been the last delivery, the 
ball coming off the pad down the leg side.

6th over: CSK 34-1 (du Plessis 5, Hussey 11) target 140 Guys, forget about 
what’s happening on the pitch: we need a montage of slow-motion close-up shots 
of the inanimate object that is theIPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl> 
trophy, backed with some inartistic montage music. And by gum we’ve got one! 
That’s more like it, TV producer! There is a brief glimpse too, of du Plessis 
toe ending a slog up in the air and over the bowler’s head, whence Wiese chases 
it down and reels it back in nicely to save one. It was still better looking 
than that montage.

Harshal Patel. He drops too short, strays too far on to leg stump, and Hussey 
hooks him round the corner for a one bounce four. Other than that? I dunno, 
because they’re talking to Andy Bichel. He likes theIPL

4th over: CSK 23-1 (du Plessis 1, Hussey 4) target 140 Du Plessis should be 
gone first ball! Arvind sends down a ripper that hits the bat slightly higher 
than Faf expected, takes the edge and flies into Gayle’s chest at slip. They go 
through for a single, then Hussey is close to going too: mishitting a pull that 
bounces just in front of Harshal Patel at deep square leg. He should have dived 
forward there as Hussey did in the first innings to get Mandeep in the same 
region.

Wicket! Smith c Starc b Arvind 17

Short from Arvind and Smith swivels and pulls. It’s an aesthetically pleasing 
body movement from Smith, but he gets it off the bottom end of the bat and 
Starc poaches him at deep square leg.

3rd over: CSK 21-0 (Smith 17, Hussey 3) target 140 Starc again; RCB need 
wickets. He gives up a bit of width to Smith, who mishits a wild slog, but the 
ball goes over extra cover and bobbles limply to the fence. After a pair of 
singles, it looks as though Starc is clutching at his back a bit. Oh this won’t 
help, short and wide outside off stump, it swings away and takes the toe end of 
the bat, down and between keeper and slip for four to third man. Smith pushes 
down the ground for a single. 21 from the first three overs, which is perfectly 
on the required run rate.

2nd over: CSK 10-0 (Smith 7, Hussey 2) target 140 It’s Arvind from the other 
end – another left armer, albeit a much slower one than Starc. Smith’s drive to 
cover is only half stopped, so they get a single for that. Hussey drops and 
runs, probably only getting through because AB misses his attempt at a 
one-handed pick up. Another dot, then a very strange punch, with the hands 
miles from the body, on the back foot and it’s a mishit, but it’s back past the 
bowler fro four. One more to mid off completes the over.

1st over: CSK 3-0 (Smith 1, Hussey 1) target 140 Well. Dwayne Smith has a 
massive, needless mow at his first ball and gets cut in half by Starc. He’s 
underway next ball though, tucking it to midwicket for a single. Hussey, he of 
the crap nickname (honestly, they don’t call me Mr OBO) emulates his opening 
partner, playing and missing at his first ball. Hussey gets a single while, er, 
I check my inbox, then Smith takes a very, very sharp leg bye from the last.

Unless Starc can do something special, this shouldn’t be too hard a run chase 
for CSK. I’m going with a six-wicket win, the total reached after 15.4 overs.

End of innings

20th over: RCB 139-8 (Aravind 0, Starc 1) Bravo with the final over. Harshal 
clumps the first ball to mid on for a single, bringing the 17-year-old Sarfaraz 
on strike. He goes back in his crease and slaps over extra cover for four. A 
single from a mistimed reverse sweep, then Harshal goes. Starc takes one first 
ball to mid off, giving Sarfaraz the strike once again. Not that he can do 
anything with it, but his 31 from 21 balls has at least prevented RCB’s total 
from being humiliating. Aravind swings and misses at the final ball.

close  
Right that’s it from me. It was rarely as enthralling as that close scoreline 
suggests, to be honest. It always felt as though RCB’s score was around 10 
below par and that MS Dhoni had it under control all along. Credit has to go to 
the CSK bowlers, Ashish Nehra with 3-28 especially, and Mike Hussey for his 56 
from 46 balls.

Chennai go through to Sunday’s final, where they will play Mumbai Indians. 
Again. Do join me for that one. Cheers for reading. Bye!
 
19.5 overs: CSK 140-7 (Ashwin 1, Jadeja 0) One needed from the last two. It’s 
full on middle and Ashwin just leans into it and knocks it square on the leg 
side for the winning run!
 
19.4 overs: CSK 139-7 (Jadeja 0) one to win Dhoni on strike. It’s full, on 
off, Dhoni swings and feathers it through to Karthik!
 
19.3 overs: CSK 139-6 (Dhoni 26, Jadeja 0) one to win Full toss, creamed out 
to deep extra cover for two; Kohli with some excellent fielding in the deep to 
prevent the boundary. Scores level.
 
19.2 overs: CSK 137-6 (Dhoni 24, Jadeja 0) three to win Short, Dhoni gets a 
bottom edge to it and there’s no run to midwicket.
 
19.1 overs: CSK 137-6 (Dhoni 24, Jadeja 0) three to win So we go to a final 
over, Jadeja is the new man. Harshal Patel, with five runs to defend, is the 
bowler. Slapped down the ground to long off; it should only be one, but Kohli’s 
return throw is a touch lax and they get back for two.
 
19 overs: CSK 135-6 (Dhoni 22) five to win Bravo strides out. And strolls back 
off again as Starc, from round the wicket, detonates the stumps with a mighty 
fine yorker!
 
18.5 overs: CSK 135-5 (Dhoni 22) five to win Yorker dug out to cover. They go 
for the single but Negi is miles short as Sarfaraz hits directly.
 
18.4 overs: CSK 135-4 (Dhoni 22, Negi 12) five to win Bump ball back at the 
bowler, but he can only get a palm to it and they get two.
 
18.3 overs: CSK 133-4 (Dhoni 20, Negi 12) seven to win Inswinger flicked to 
mid on for one.
 
18.2 overs: CSK 132-4 (Dhoni 20, Negi 11) eight to win The batsmen get caught 
in two minds, the throw from mid off should bring the run out, but it misses 
and they get an overthrow.
 
18.1 overs: CSK 131-4 (Dhoni 19, Negi 11) nine to win Starc to bowl the 
penultimate over. You would imagine that he needs to get Dhoni here. He doesn’t 
with this ball, the India captain dancing down the track and mashing a length 
ball outside off back to long off for four.
 
18th over: CSK 127-4 (Dhoni 15, Negi 11) target 140 27 needed from 18 balls. 
Dhoni reduces that target by one, then Negi reduces it by six with an absolute 
monster of a slog, high but also a good way over mid on. Harshal Patel is the 
bowler, by the way. Negi tries again a couple of balls later, but just drags it 
along the floor to mid on for one. Ooh Dhoni then gets lucky, inside edging on 
to his pads and they dash through for one more – that could so easily have gone 
into the stumps. Negi smears the final ball out to extra cover, where Starc 
comes around to keep them to a couple. 13 needed from 12 balls. Let’s go 
ball-by ball, yeah?
 
17th over: CSK 113-4 (Dhoni 13, Negi 0) target 140 Kohli decides to hold Starc 
back until the death, as you’d expect, but it might be too late now. No sooner 
have I typed that than Hussey goes, but as long as Dhoni’s there then CSK 
should still do this. A slower ball goes beneath the low bottom edge of MS’s 
bat and nutmegs Karthik, allowing the batsmen three byes.
 
A great innings comes to an end. Wiese drops short, Hussey tries to pull but 
top edges it and the ball loops to midwicket.
 
16th over: CSK 106-3 (Dhoni 10, Hussey 55) target 140 Chahal again. Hussey 
sashays down the pitch to his first ball, backs away to leg and smacks it back 
down the ground for six. He tries again next ball, but Chahal sees him coming 
and pushes it a bit wider, so Hussey can only bunt to mid off for one. Another 
single to Dhoni, then Hussey charges again but can only screw it off the inside 
edge to Sarfaraz at mid on. No run for that, but six from the next as Hussey 
slog sweeps over mid on for six!
 
15th over: CSK 91-3 (Dhoni 9, Hussey 41) target 140 Speaking of Starc (look, 
read the last entry), here he is again. It’s probably best for CSK to just keep 
things ticking over here and see off Starc, before targeting the other seamers. 
Indeed that’s what they do here: a single from each of the over’s six balls.
 
14th over: CSK 85-3 (Dhoni 6, Hussey 38) target 140 Back comes Chahal. His 
overs and Starc’s will be crucial, you imagine. Dhoni isn’t even bothering with 
a cap against the spinner; that might be because of the heatwave they’re 
apparently going through out there. Just one from the first four balls, then 
Hussey gets a leading edge in the air, but too far to the bowler’s right for it 
to be a c&b chance. One run from that, one run to Dhoni down to long on and the 
required rate is now above nine. CSK are still favourites in my book.

13th over: CSK 82-3 (Dhoni 4, Hussey 37) target 140 Kohli turns back to 
Aravind. They probably need a couple more wickets in the next three overs or so 
to win this, do RCB. I mean, if ever there was a pair in the post-Bevan era you 
wanted to see you home, it’s these two. Hussey picks up a pair of twos, then 
Aravind drops short and on leg stump, and Hussey whips the pull round the 
corner for four more. Singles from each of the last two balls make 10 from the 
over.
 
12th over: CSK 72-3 (Dhoni 3, Hussey 28) target 140 Wiese has been the least 
effective of the RCB bowlers so far today – 18 from his two overs so far. This 
is a risky move from Kohli, holding back his strike bowlers with a new batsman 
at the crease. Wiese goes too full to Hussey and rightly gets driven through 
extra cover for four. Eight off the over, which is around about up there with 
the required rate. I think this one’s going down to the wire, folks.
 
11th over: CSK 64-3 (Dhoni 1, Hussey 22) target 140 This is probably a crucial 
innings for Dhoni; if he goes cheaply then RCB might just do this. Harshal 
Patel is back into the attack, having conceded just five from his first over. 
Hussey gets a single to give Dhoni the strike and he gets off the mark from the 
fourth ball of his innings, a dab down to third man for it. Two from the over. 
Oh and it looks like Hussey has had his score corrected somehow. Er, not sure 
what happened there.
 
10th over: CSK 62-3 (Dhoni 0, Hussey 23) target 140 After adverts, Hussey goes 
after Chahal, slogging him up in the air over mid off. It plugs though and 
Starc jogs round, dives and flaps it back in to keep them for three. Faf is 
bowled the very next ball, exposing his stumps and losing them. Raina only 
lasts two, which brings the Microsoft man to the crease.
 
Is this on? Surely it’s not on. Raina goes big second ball, trying to hit down 
the ground and into the stands, but just picks out the man on the straight 
boundary.
 
Once again, du Plessis goes for the premeditated used-to-be-called-a-Dilscoop. 
This time though he misses it, it’s an arm ball and over goes leg stump.
 
9th over: CSK 58-1 (du Plessis 17, Hussey 21) target 140 Another half chance 
as de Villiers swoops in from cover, picks up, dives and throws off target with 
Hussey short. Du Plessis responds with what was once called the Dilscoop, a 
premeditated little shovel over his shoulder for four. And the same amount 
comes from the final ball, bunted down the ground.
 
8th over: CSK 47-1 (du Plessis 12, Hussey 15) target 140 Time for some spin, 
with Chahal being brought in. More poor fielding as du Plessis hesitates in 
calling for a run and Hussey is a goner if de Villiers – of all people – 
doesn’t throw the ball a couple of feet behind the stumps. He does that, 
though. Two more to deep extra cover when, yep, there’s a fumble.
 
7th over: CSK 41-1 (du Plessis 8, Hussey 13) target 140 Wiese into the attack 
now and he begins with a wide, drifted listlessly outside of the tramlines on 
the off side. then a couple of balls later, perhaps a drop? I can’t see any 
edge, but, after it clatters out of Karthik’s gloves – unacceptable, really, at 
Wiese’s pace – and the batsmen jog through for one, the umpire gives it as 
runs. Then a ridiculous wide off what should have been the last delivery, the 
ball coming off the pad down the leg side.
 
That was just incredibly out of the blue.
 
6th over: CSK 34-1 (du Plessis 5, Hussey 11) target 140 Guys, forget about 
what’s happening on the pitch: we need a montage of slow-motion close-up shots 
of the inanimate object that is theIPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl> 
trophy, backed with some inartistic montage music. And by gum we’ve got one! 
That’s more like it, TV producer! There is a brief glimpse too, of du Plessis 
toe ending a slog up in the air and over the bowler’s head, whence Wiese chases 
it down and reels it back in nicely to save one. It was still better looking 
than that montage.
 
5th over: CSK 28-1 (du Plessis 1, Hussey 9) target 140 Time for a new bowler, 
Harshal Patel. He drops too short, strays too far on to leg stump, and Hussey 
hooks him round the corner for a one bounce four. Other than that? I dunno, 
because they’re talking to Andy Bichel. He likes theIPL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl>, in case you were wondering.
 
4th over: CSK 23-1 (du Plessis 1, Hussey 4) target 140 Du Plessis should be 
gone first ball! Arvind sends down a ripper that hits the bat slightly higher 
than Faf expected, takes the edge and flies into Gayle’s chest at slip. They go 
through for a single, then Hussey is close to going too: mishitting a pull that 
bounces just in front of Harshal Patel at deep square leg. He should have dived 
forward there as Hussey did in the first innings to get Mandeep in the same 
region.
 
Short from Arvind and Smith swivels and pulls. It’s an aesthetically pleasing 
body movement from Smith, but he gets it off the bottom end of the bat and 
Starc poaches him at deep square leg.
 
3rd over: CSK 21-0 (Smith 17, Hussey 3) target 140 Starc again; RCB need 
wickets. He gives up a bit of width to Smith, who mishits a wild slog, but the 
ball goes over extra cover and bobbles limply to the fence. After a pair of 
singles, it looks as though Starc is clutching at his back a bit. Oh this won’t 
help, short and wide outside off stump, it swings away and takes the toe end of 
the bat, down and between keeper and slip for four to third man. Smith pushes 
down the ground for a single. 21 from the first three overs, which is perfectly 
on the required run rate.
 
2nd over: CSK 10-0 (Smith 7, Hussey 2) target 140 It’s Arvind from the other 
end – another left armer, albeit a much slower one than Starc. Smith’s drive to 
cover is only half stopped, so they get a single for that. Hussey drops and 
runs, probably only getting through because AB misses his attempt at a 
one-handed pick up. Another dot, then a very strange punch, with the hands 
miles from the body, on the back foot and it’s a mishit, but it’s back past the 
bowler fro four. One more to mid off completes the over.
 
1st over: CSK 3-0 (Smith 1, Hussey 1) target 140 Well. Dwayne Smith has a 
massive, needless mow at his first ball and gets cut in half by Starc. He’s 
underway next ball though, tucking it to midwicket for a single. Hussey, he of 
the crap nickname (honestly, they don’t call me Mr OBO) emulates his opening 
partner, playing and missing at his first ball. Hussey gets a single while, er, 
I check my inbox, then Smith takes a very, very sharp leg bye from the last.
 
Here come the players. Starc, you won’t be surprised to hear, has been chucked 
the ball.
 
Unless Starc can do something special, this shouldn’t be too hard a run chase 
for CSK. I’m going with a six-wicket win, the total reached after 15.4 overs.
 
20th over: RCB 139-8 (Aravind 0, Starc 1) Bravo with the final over. Harshal 
clumps the first ball to mid on for a single, bringing the 17-year-old Sarfaraz 
on strike. He goes back in his crease and slaps over extra cover for four. A 
single from a mistimed reverse sweep, then Harshal goes. Starc takes one first 
ball to mid off, giving Sarfaraz the strike once again. Not that he can do 
anything with it, but his 31 from 21 balls has at least prevented RCB’s total 
from being humiliating. Aravind swings and misses at the final ball.
 
Slower ball, outside off and he cuts meekly to point.
 
Harshal thinks about taking a bye off a wide, walks out of his ground and 
Dhoni throws down the stumps.
