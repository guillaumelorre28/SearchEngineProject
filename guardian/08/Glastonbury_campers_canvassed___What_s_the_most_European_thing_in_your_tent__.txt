Chris: The dreaded bit was the walk from the car park. It’s a long walk when 
the wheels fall off your trolley.


Paul: We bought a German trolley, so it’s lasted.

Steve: How did we feel this morning? Fantastic! Banging headache, but I still 
felt fantastic.

Paul: Did the Brexit news ruin our mood? No, party on!

Steve: I kind of thought it would happen.

Jenny: People will survive.

Chris: You just don’t want Boris Johnson and Farage anywhere near control.

Tom: What’s the most European thing in our tent? Us!

Chloe: We’re all “in”.

Carolyn: We’re not massively bothered. I think the majority of people at 
Glastonbury would be in.

Tom: It’s 50-50: the fact that half the people in the country are going to be 
upset, I do think that’s bad.

Chloe: We looked at it straight away when we eventually woke up, but it’s not 
like suddenly tomorrow everything’s different.

Emily: Brexit? Really shocked, it was horrible. Sam is wearing the hat of lies 
– we pass it round.

Sam: We had the hat of truth at uni in Cardiff, but we lost it.

Emily: The most European thing in our tent? We’ve got a couple of French 
speakers but they’re not here right now.

Sam: We saw Christine and the Queens, she’s French! The sun came out for her, 
it was great.

Dom: I’m looking forward to Richard Hawley, Savages and Doreen Doreen, they’re 
high camp, 80s style: you have to see them.

Sarah: The most European thing in our tent? A brioche bun and a blue Ikea bag.

Harriet: When we heard the Brexit news I had a little cry. We went to see 
Damon Albarn with the Orchestra of Syrian Musicians and they did Out of Time. I 
was literally bawling my eyes out.

Sarah: I wouldn’t want anything to do with Britain if I was European. My dad’s 
Irish and my parents were so worried about Brexit they made me get an Irish 
passport. I was like, don’t worry, it’ll never happen …

Mark: Are we having a good time? Loving it, it’s wet and wild!

Emily: Beans on Toast was an absolute star! We saw Michael Eavis last night, 
he was brilliant.

Mark: I’m looking forward to Hot Chip remembers Prince, Underworld, Disclosure 
and we’re all doing ZZ Top this afternoon, Purple Rave and Danny Howells.

Darren: I’ve been coming for over 20 years. It’s better when it rains, people 
have more fun – the worse the weather, the more camaraderie you have. It’s like 
the war, Dunkirk spirit comes out!

Mark: I was really shocked by the EU result, and shocked that Cameron landed 
on his sword.

Darren: If we’re left with Boris and Trump, what hope do we have?

Emily: It’s better being here and getting that news. The most European thing 
in our tent? A camembert.

Peter: I was the first person through the gate. They asked me how I’d spent 
the night, and I said “contemplating life”. When you’re sat in the rain under 
an umbrella and it’s pissing down and you’ve got three hours to stare at 
nothing and weigh things up, see how things are going … I thought, I’m still 
quite happy, sat here in the rain.

Leah: What’s the most European thing in our tent? Chorizo!

Mark: It’s absolutely brilliant. The kids came in yesterday. I’ve been here 
since last Sunday working on campsite security. They’re all right so far, it 
was a little bit of a strain to get them in but we had our little wagon. We 
heard different stories about bringing them, but we thought, if it gets muddy, 
it gets muddy. To be honest, it’s very well catered for kids. As long as you 
don’t take them down Shangri-La you’ve got nothing to worry about. I saw James 
this morning, and Elle King on the John Peel stage, one of those ones where you 
walk in without knowing her and she was amazing. I’m looking forward to 
Coldplay on Sunday and I fancy seeing Jake Bugg, as well.

weekend, and we raise money for Stanchester Academy, the school that we work 
for. Most of the stewards on site are raising money for charity.

Jason: I’m looking forward to The Shires on Saturday night. Baaba Maal and the

Ruth: We were shocked.

Nick: Glastonbury will probably be 98% in – here you kind of put it to one 
side, but it probably won’t be until Monday when you get home that it will dawn 
on you. We haven’t really been following the news – we buy the Guardian every 
day here, but it hasn’t really hit home.

Ruth: It’s quite useful as a doormat in our tent too! When we’ve read it of 
course!

Nick: Most European thing in our tent? A box of French merlot!
