The Republican national convention has concluded. Here’s what happened on the 
fourth and final day:

 * Donald Trump accepted the presidential nomination in an approximately 
75-minute speech in which he promised to “restore law and order to our 
country”. A speech transcriptis here 
<https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/DJT_Acceptance_Speech.pdf>. 
 * Trump described “a moment of crisis for our nation” born of a series of 
threats, from “illegal immigration” to violent crime to violence directed at 
law enforcement to transnational terrorism. 
 * The details of Trump’s dire picture of a darkly violent America did not 
stand up to scrutiny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jul/21/republican-national-convention-day-four-trump?page=with:block-57919ef5e4b00b50d2e0fd2a#block-57919ef5e4b00b50d2e0fd2a>
, but the sense he communicated of a nation under siege seemed to resonate 
deeply with the packed crowd at Cleveland’s Quicken Loans arena, which 
repeatedly leapt to its feet, chanted and cheered. 
 * “I have a message for all of you,” Trump said. “The crime and violence that 
today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 
2017, safety will be restored.” 
 * Trump was preceded at the lectern by his daughter Ivanka, who promised the 
country that her father would work tirelessly to make America great again. The 
highest spike in Google traffic on the night, in terms of percentage, was for 
the question: “How old is Ivanka Trump?” 
 * Ivanka Trump noted she was a millennial and said her father would fight for 
equal pay for women and paid family leave. 
 * Donald Trump invited Bernie Sanders to join his “movement” and predicted 
that “millions of Democrats” would end up voting for him. 
 * Litigious tech billionaire Peter Thiel, in his speech, told the crowd: “I’m 
proud to be gay,” and was applauded. A call to protect “the LGBTQ community” by 
Trump was also applauded, and he thanked the crowd for applauding. 
 * At the end, thousands of balloons and confetti dropped from the ceiling as 
the candidates and their families took the stage. 
 * Cleveland officials reported no RNC-related arrests on the day – but that 
may have been before Code Pink’s Medea Benjamin was pulled from the arena for 
protesting Trump’s speech.

Overall violent crime in United States down dramatically

Lois Beckett

Do the crime statistics cited by Trump to make the case that the country needs 
a law-and-order candidate hold water?

The 17% homicide spike that Trump referenced is statistically significant, 
“real and nearly unprecedented,” according to aJustice Department funded study 
<http:// https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/249895.pdf>.

The study was largely concentrated in ten cities with large African-American 
populations, the study found. You can read our in-depth coverage of the report 
here:

Is the 'Ferguson effect' real? Researcher has second thoughts
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/13/ferguson-effect-real-researcher-richard-rosenfield-second-thoughts>
The researcher who wrote the report, criminologist Richard Rosenfeld, argued 
that the best explanation for the homicide increase might be linked in some 
ways to the high-profile incidents of police violence towards black Americans 
and the subsequent widespread protests against the police.

While he did not agree with the traditional conservative concept of a 
“Ferguson Effect,” he argued that there might be some connection between police 
violence, protests, and an increase in community violence, perhaps linked to 
deteriorating trust of citizens in the police.


The liberal Brennan Center has released a fact-check of Trump’s claims 
<https://www.brennancenter.org/press-release/fact-checking-trump-crime-numbers-dont-add>
, highlighting the fact that overall violent crime is down dramatically over 
the past twenty years.

Ben Jacobs

Ed Cox, the chair of the New York State Republican Party and president Richard 
Nixon’s son-in-law, noted some similarities to the Guardian. 

“Certainly Donald Trump calls his supporters the silent majority 
unapologetically,” said Cox. “Now that was not a part of his acceptance speech 
in 68, that was November [19]69, the Vietnam speech. ButDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has captured that silent 
majority completely for the first time since Reagan, and maybe even better than 
Reagan. But certainly like my father-in-law.”

We’re back! Seems that a thousand journalists simultaneously trying to upload 
videos of balloons falling on Republican delegates was more than the WiFi could 
handle.

The delegates are now taking group pictures with the signs from their states 
and taking group pictures onstage. Lots of balloons popping everywhere. Stands 
clearing out.

The speech is over. The crowd goes, as they say, quite wild. Melania Trump 
takes the stage and is verily applauded. Barron Trump is next, dressed like a 
Blues Brother. Here come more Trumps. The band’s not playing, that’s the studio 
recording of All Right Now. Now there are Pences on stage too. There is 
handshaking and now... now... there is glitter-- the video screen shows 
fireworks..

Trump is close to the finish. CAPS below in original script:

I’m asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the 
White House. My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty 
pledge. It reads: “I’m With Her”. 282 I choose to recite a different pledge. My 
pledge reads: “I’M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.” I am your voice. So to 
every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their 
future, I say these words to you tonight: I’m with you, I will fight for you, 
and I will win for you.

Trump speaks on personal terms about his family, notably his father, which we 
haven’t heard him do much of. Ad-libs CAPS:

In this journey, I’m so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my 
wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be 
my greatest source of pride and joy. AND BY THE WAY, MELANIA, AND IVANKA, DID 
THEY DO A JOB.

My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I 
wonder sometimes what he’d say if he were here to see this tonight.

Somebody yells, ‘YOU ROCK!’ Would Fred Trump really say that?

It’s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the 
dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most 
comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I 
have a lot of that in me also. I LOVE THOSE PEOPLE.

Then there’s my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. 
She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and 
charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character. SHE COULD 
PICK ‘EM OUT FROM ANYWHERE.

To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother 
Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved 
my life in business.

final address. Photograph: Adrees Latif/Reuters 
Trump, ad-libs CAPS:

An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious 
institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate 
their political views.

I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech 
for all Americans.

We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is 
start believing in ourselves and in our country again. It is time to show the 
whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever 
before.

What a big applause line that was.

Trump now thanks evangelical Christians for supporting him but admits, in an 
improvised aside, that he may not deserve it:

At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community BECAUSE I WILL 
TELL YOU WHAT, THE SUPPORT THAT THEY’VE GIVEN ME, AND I’M NOT SURE I DESERVE 
IT, HAS BEEN SO AMAZING, AND IS SUCH A BIG REASON FOR ME BEING HERE TONIGHT. 
You have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from 
speaking your minds from your own pulpits.

More Trump, ad-libs CAPS:

The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and 
principles. VERY IMPORTANT. This will be one of the most important issues 
decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd 
amendment. [LOUD BOOS] I, on the other hand, received the early and strong 
endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all 
Americans to keep their families safe.

This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will 
build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of 
tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids 
from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of 
their choice.

My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American 
children. AND THAT’S WHAT SHE’S DOING. AND THAT’S WHAT SHE’S DONE. We will 
repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. [CHEERS.] You will be able to choose 
your own doctor again. [CHEERS] And we will fix TSA at the airports WHICH IS A 
TOTAL DISASTER!

We’re going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take 
the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.

We will completely rebuild our depleted military [BIG CHEERS], and the 
countries that we protect, at a massive COST TO US, will be asked to pay their 
fair share.

We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care 
of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran 
support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit 
the doctor or hospital of their choice WITHOUT WAITING FIVE DAYS ON A LINE AND 
DYING. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal – one more sign of how out of touch 
she really is.

We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of 
wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The 
politicians have talked about THIS FOR YEARS, BUT I’m going to do it.

The Republican national convention has concluded. Here’s what happened on the 
fourth and final day:

 * Donald Trump accepted the presidential nomination in an approximately 
75-minute speech in which he promised to “restore law and order to our 
country”. A speech transcriptis here 
<https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/DJT_Acceptance_Speech.pdf>. 
 * Trump described “a moment of crisis for our nation” born of a series of 
threats, from “illegal immigration” to violent crime to violence directed at 
law enforcement to transnational terrorism. 
 * The details of Trump’s dire picture of a darkly violent America did not 
stand up to scrutiny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jul/21/republican-national-convention-day-four-trump?page=with:block-57919ef5e4b00b50d2e0fd2a#block-57919ef5e4b00b50d2e0fd2a>
, but the sense he communicated of a nation under siege seemed to resonate 
deeply with the packed crowd at Cleveland’s Quicken Loans arena, which 
repeatedly leapt to its feet, chanted and cheered. 
 * “I have a message for all of you,” Trump said. “The crime and violence that 
today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 
2017, safety will be restored.” 
 * Trump was preceded at the lectern by his daughter Ivanka, who promised the 
country that her father would work tirelessly to make America great again. The 
highest spike in Google traffic on the night, in terms of percentage, was for 
the question: “How old is Ivanka Trump?” 
 * Ivanka Trump noted she was a millennial and said her father would fight for 
equal pay for women and paid family leave. 
 * Donald Trump invited Bernie Sanders to join his “movement” and predicted 
that “millions of Democrats” would end up voting for him. 
 * Litigious tech billionaire Peter Thiel, in his speech, told the crowd: “I’m 
proud to be gay,” and was applauded. A call to protect “the LGBTQ community” by 
Trump was also applauded, and he thanked the crowd for applauding. 
 * At the end, thousands of balloons and confetti dropped from the ceiling as 
the candidates and their families took the stage. 
 * Cleveland officials reported no RNC-related arrests on the day – but that 
may have been before Code Pink’s Medea Benjamin was pulled from the arena for 
protesting Trump’s speech.

Do the crime statistics cited by Trump to make the case that the country needs 
a law-and-order candidate hold water?

The 17% homicide spike that Trump referenced is statistically significant, 
“real and nearly unprecedented,” according to aJustice Department funded study 
<http:// https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/249895.pdf>.

The study was largely concentrated in ten cities with large African-American 
populations, the study found. You can read our in-depth coverage of the report 
here:

Is the 'Ferguson effect' real? Researcher has second thoughts
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/13/ferguson-effect-real-researcher-richard-rosenfield-second-thoughts>
The researcher who wrote the report, criminologist Richard Rosenfeld, argued 
that the best explanation for the homicide increase might be linked in some 
ways to the high-profile incidents of police violence towards black Americans 
and the subsequent widespread protests against the police.

While he did not agree with the traditional conservative concept of a 
“Ferguson Effect,” he argued that there might be some connection between police 
violence, protests, and an increase in community violence, perhaps linked to 
deteriorating trust of citizens in the police.


The liberal Brennan Center has released a fact-check of Trump’s claims 
<https://www.brennancenter.org/press-release/fact-checking-trump-crime-numbers-dont-add>
, highlighting the fact that overall violent crime is down dramatically over 
the past twenty years.

 
Ed Cox, the chair of the New York State Republican Party and president Richard 
Nixon’s son-in-law, noted some similarities to the Guardian. 

“Certainly Donald Trump calls his supporters the silent majority 
unapologetically,” said Cox. “Now that was not a part of his acceptance speech 
in 68, that was November [19]69, the Vietnam speech. ButDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has captured that silent 
majority completely for the first time since Reagan, and maybe even better than 
Reagan. But certainly like my father-in-law.”
 
Here’s some more interesting end-of-night data from the folks at Google. The 
biggest spike in search traffic, in terms of percentage, it appears to us, was 
a 4,900% spike in searches for “How old is Ivanka Trump?”

We’re back! Seems that a thousand journalists simultaneously trying to upload 
videos of balloons falling on Republican delegates was more than the WiFi could 
handle.

The delegates are now taking group pictures with the signs from their states 
and taking group pictures onstage. Lots of balloons popping everywhere. Stands 
clearing out.

 
The end of Trump’s speech and the huge balloon drop seemed to knock out wifi 
in the arena. Normal service will be resumed on the blog very soon...

The speech is over. The crowd goes, as they say, quite wild. Melania Trump 
takes the stage and is verily applauded. Barron Trump is next, dressed like a 
Blues Brother. Here come more Trumps. The band’s not playing, that’s the studio 
recording of All Right Now. Now there are Pences on stage too. There is 
handshaking and now... now... there is glitter-- the video screen shows 
fireworks..

and... 
 
Here’s the end:

To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise: We 
Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make America Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

And We Will Make America Great Again.

THANK YOU.

Trump is close to the finish. CAPS below in original script:

I’m asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the 
White House. My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty 
pledge. It reads: “I’m With Her”. 282 I choose to recite a different pledge. My 
pledge reads: “I’M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.” I am your voice. So to 
every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their 
future, I say these words to you tonight: I’m with you, I will fight for you, 
and I will win for you.
 
Trump speaks on personal terms about his family, notably his father, which we 
haven’t heard him do much of. Ad-libs CAPS:

In this journey, I’m so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my 
wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be 
my greatest source of pride and joy. AND BY THE WAY, MELANIA, AND IVANKA, DID 
THEY DO A JOB.

My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I 
wonder sometimes what he’d say if he were here to see this tonight.

Somebody yells, ‘YOU ROCK!’ Would Fred Trump really say that?

It’s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the 
dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most 
comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I 
have a lot of that in me also. I LOVE THOSE PEOPLE.

Then there’s my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. 
She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and 
charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character. SHE COULD 
PICK ‘EM OUT FROM ANYWHERE.

To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother 
Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved 
my life in business.

Trump, ad-libs CAPS:

An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious 
institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate 
their political views.

I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech 
for all Americans.

We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is 
start believing in ourselves and in our country again. It is time to show the 
whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever 
before.

What a big applause line that was.
 
Trump now thanks evangelical Christians for supporting him but admits, in an 
improvised aside, that he may not deserve it:

At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community BECAUSE I WILL 
TELL YOU WHAT, THE SUPPORT THAT THEY’VE GIVEN ME, AND I’M NOT SURE I DESERVE 
IT, HAS BEEN SO AMAZING, AND IS SUCH A BIG REASON FOR ME BEING HERE TONIGHT. 
You have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from 
speaking your minds from your own pulpits.
 
More Trump, ad-libs CAPS:

The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and 
principles. VERY IMPORTANT. This will be one of the most important issues 
decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd 
amendment. [LOUD BOOS] I, on the other hand, received the early and strong 
endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all 
Americans to keep their families safe.

One of the biggest applause lines of the night:

We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who 
will uphold our laws and our Constitution.
 
This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will 
build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of 
tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids 
from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of 
their choice.

My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American 
children. AND THAT’S WHAT SHE’S DOING. AND THAT’S WHAT SHE’S DONE. We will 
repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. [CHEERS.] You will be able to choose 
your own doctor again. [CHEERS] And we will fix TSA at the airports WHICH IS A 
TOTAL DISASTER!

We’re going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take 
the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.

We will completely rebuild our depleted military [BIG CHEERS], and the 
countries that we protect, at a massive COST TO US, will be asked to pay their 
fair share.

We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care 
of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran 
support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit 
the doctor or hospital of their choice WITHOUT WAITING FIVE DAYS ON A LINE AND 
DYING. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal – one more sign of how out of touch 
she really is.

We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of 
wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The 
politicians have talked about THIS FOR YEARS, BUT I’m going to do it.
