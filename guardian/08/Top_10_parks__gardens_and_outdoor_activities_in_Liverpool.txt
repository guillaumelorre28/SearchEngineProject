Another Place, Crosby

Antony Gormley's silent army of sea-gazing sculptures – Another Place – has 
rightly put Crosby beach on the tourist trail. The 100 life-size figures, 
drowned by the approaching tide twice a day make for a poignant spectacle: it's 
rare that stationary public art can be quite so moving. Behind the beach, 
Crosby marina is an inviting, watery maze of pontoons, reed beds, watersports 
and cycle trails. If you've a couple of hours, take the coastal path north to 
Formby, with its red squirrel-favoured pinewoods, and wind-sculpted dunes.

Sefton Park
 Photograph: Eli Pascall-Willis/Alamy 
The biggest park, by far, in Liverpool is Sefton Park, arcing around the bo-ho 
southern suburbs of the city. Within, you'll find the steamy wrought-iron Palm 
House – stuffed to the rafters with exotic fronds and ferns – an ornamental 
lake or two, and acres of lawn to stretch out on.

The Pier Head

For all its talk, Liverpool's really only a three-sided city. The fourth? A 
river runs through it. And, in the past 10 years or so, it has returned to the 
waterfront in a big way. The new Leeds-Liverpool canal extension now scythes 
cleanly through the Pier Head; centrepiece of a bold and jaunty new landscaping 
scheme. On a grey day, it comes over a bit like a festival of poured concrete, 
but when the sun's out, the views – and the Mersey breezes – are the easiest 
way to escape the city for an hour.

Festival Gardens

Liverpool hosted the first of those curious garden festivals that bothered the 
outer reaches of blighted cities in the 1980s. Of course, as soon as the 
wisteria wilted, the site quickly returned to the brownfield edgeland it grew 
out of. Now it's back in its more-or-less 1980's pomp. The years out of the 
spotlight have allowed nature to soften the edges and landscape architect Peter 
Smith has wisely cut back just enough to allow his scheme to sit within a 
framework of hedgerow, knee-high grasses and recolonised shrubs. The effect is 
of a series of magical set pieces: a three-tier waterfall, dazzling herbaceous 
borders, rock gardens and river views.

The Wirral Way

Once an Adelstrop-like railway branch line, the Wirral Way is now a 
footpath/cycle route running along the Dee side of the Wirral peninsula. Along 
its 10-mile length, grassy knolls offer magnificent views over to the hills of 
north Wales, the shingly beach at Thurstaston, and the National Trust-managed 
Heswall Meadows: all billowing cornflowers and poppies in summer. It's handily 
bookended by the towns of West Kirby and Heswall, so you'll have no trouble 
picking up picnic provisions. And if you hire a bike (wirralcycle.weebly.com 
<http://wirralcycle.weebly.com/>), this is just the best way to spend an 
afternoon.

Port Sunlight Village

Part open-air museum, part super-sized Trumpton recreation, Port Sunlight 
remains one of Britain's best examples of a "model village", built by the 
philanthropically inclinedWilliam Hesketh Lever 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lever,_1st_Viscount_Leverhulme> to house 
workers at his Sunlight soap factory. The Arts and Crafts-inspired garden 
village is set in 130 acres of beautifully maintained grounds, complete with a 
sunken park called the Dell. Clustered around the parks and avenues, the 
village's architecturally eclectic houses, the Lady Lever art gallery, the 
church, the pub and the hotel create an intoxicating mix.

Everton Brow

Everton brow, a lofty vantage point just to the north of the city centre, 
offers the best view in the city. Here, at the top of the town, you spy 
glimpses of the Mersey, glinting between the spires and skyscrapers. In truth, 
this isn't the prettiest of city parks, and the hike to the top up the steps 
from Shaw Street will have you breathless. But trust us on this one. Time your 
visit for sunset and you'll be rewarded by the best show in town, as the sun 
sinks behind the wind turbines over the Mersey Bay. Magical.

St James Gardens

Dive into the countersunk grotto of St James Gardens – Liverpool's answer to 
the Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris – and the Anglican cathedral seems to erupt 
out of the ground, like a mighty, landlocked, cliff face. It's commonly thought 
this disused quarry was the source for the sandstone used to erect the UK's 
largest cathedral, but that honour actually goes to Storeton quarry, on the 
Wirral. Still, this Grade I-listed park – once a cemetery for the city's great 
and good – feels wonderfully removed from the rattling city. And the cathedral 
views are sublime.

Wakeboarding Park
 Wakeboarding Park liverpool 
Alongside the excellent Liverpool Watersports Centre 
<http://www.liverpoolwatersports.org.uk/> in Queens Dock, the newly arrived 
Wakeboarding Centre also offers lessons in sailing, windsurfing, kayaking and 
power boating. But it's the opportunity to try out boatless wakeboarding 
(thanks to a clever "cable tow", similar to a ski drag lifts) that attracts the 
thrill seekers. It's certainly the most adrenalin-packed way to explore the 
city's famous docks. And, should you not be seized with the desire to squeeze 
into a wetsuit, it's great to come down and watch the experts twist and fly 
through the waves.
• 110 Mariners Wharf, liverpoolwakepark.co.uk <http://liverpoolwakepark.co.uk/>
. Open daily, until dusk. 15-minute session £22, under-16s £15, wetsuit and 
wakebaord hire £3 each (free for under-16s)

Shiverpool Ghost Tours

You'd expect an old seafaring city with a Celtic heart to have its share of 
myth and folklore to spin. Liverpool's theatrically inclined Shiverpool tours 
gleefully upend the history books with nocturnal explorations of the city's 
shadowier precincts. Best by far is its Auld City Shivers tour. En route, 
you'll learn about the city's earliest history, retracing the old port's 
original seven streets clustered around the Town Hall, before diving below the 
city streets into the plague pits and the slimy site of the castle's original 
dungeons. Fun, yes, but perhaps not for impressionable youngsters.
• Starts at Queen Victoria Monument, Derby Square. shiverpool.co.uk 
<http://shiverpool.co.uk/our-tours/auld-city-shivers.aspx>. Tours nightly, 
adult £14, child/student/senior £11
