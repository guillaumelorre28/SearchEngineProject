British gin is synonymous with London. However, in recent years, more than 
two-thirds of the UK’s total gin production has moved outside the capital – and 
outside England altogether. Scotland is now at the heart of the British gin 
industry, home to two of the world’s largest brands (Gordon’s and Tanqueray) 
but also to an array of craft gin distillers: currently more than 25. In the 
past two years, half a dozen new craft gins have reached the shelves, from 
names such as Crossbill and Heather Rose. There’s even a fresh venture to 
celebrate from the Isle of Jura, where three women have establishedLussa Gin 
<http://www.lussagin.com/index.html>, using 15 botanicals from the hills and 
lochs, woods and coastline of the island.

To reflect this rise in Scottish craft gin, the Wine and Spirit Trade 
Association <http://www.wsta.co.uk/> (WSTA) has launched the Scotland Gin Trail 
<http://www.wsta.co.uk/images/Spirits/GinTrail/Scotland_GinMap2016.pdf>. The 
route’s 17 stopoffs include craft distilleries and gin bars across Scotland, 
from the bright lights ofGlasgow Distillery 
<https://glasgowdistillery.com/makar-gin> (a young producer that launched its 
first spirit, Makar Glasgow Gin, in 2014) to the dark skies ofShetland Reel Gin 
<http://www.shetlandreel.com/> (the UK’s most northerly distillery).

Those who follow the trail can discover the diversity of Scotland’s gins. For 
example, on the north coast,Dunnet Bay Distillery 
<http://www.dunnetbaydistillers.co.uk/dunnet-bay-distillers/> creates the 
delicate, aromatic Rock Rose Gin, which has earned awards for husband-and-wife 
team Martin and Claire Murray. Meanwhile,Eden Mill <https://www.edenmill.com/> 
in St Andrew’s prefers to challenge palates with one-of-a-kind craft creations 
such as Golf Gin, which is “flavoured with retired golf clubs” – hickory 
shavings from clubs are added to the botanicals.

 Glasgow Distillery’s Makar gin. 
A great place to begin is Edinburgh Gin 
<http://www.edinburghgindistillery.co.uk/>, a distillery and visitor centre 
close to the castle. Gin enthusiasts can tour the distillery (tickets from 
£10), peeking into the two copper stills, Flora and Caledonia, before heading 
into the Heads and Tales basement bar for a tutored tasting of the 
navy-strength Cannonball Gin, Seaside Gin (which incorporates coastal 
botanicals) and or its own eponymous gin, which is distilled with heather, milk 
thistle and pine.

 Still crazy … Hendrick’s has been credited for kick-starting fresh interest in 
gin in Scotland. Photograph: Alamy 
Gin in Scotland is nothing new. The juniper-flavoured Dutch spirit genever 
first arrived in Edinburgh in the 1600s, and was gleefully embraced. When a tax 
on imported spirits cut off the supply, entrepreneurial locals began to craft 
their own cheap, readily available versions, and helped usher in an era of mass 
drunkenness and moral hand-wringing across the UK, known asthe Gin Craze 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_Craze>. But then in the late 18th century, 
Scots discovered a taste for whisky, and gin lost out.

Until now. The release of the South Ayrshire-made Hendrick’s Gin 
<https://uk.hendricksgin.com/> in 1999 signalled the start of a new era for gin 
in Scotland, and the past few years have seen further development and new 
ventures. The WSTA trail puts gin back on the map – and enables visitors to see 
and enjoy so much of the great landscape that inspires the producers.
