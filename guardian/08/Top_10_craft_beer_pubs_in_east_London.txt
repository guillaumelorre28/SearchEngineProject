Crate Brewery, Hackney Wick


The sprawling industrial estate that stretches along the Lee Navigation canal 
at Hackney Wick has, in recent years, been infiltrated by artists, creatives 
and, most recently, brewers in search of affordable space. For instance, Crate, 
a tap room for the brewery next door, is a stark, exposed concrete box 
decked-out with rugged upcycled furniture. It also has plenty of outdoor, 
canalside seating for summer. Naturally, its own beers dominate the bar (try 
the sparky, mango-tinged pale or the terrific imperial coffee stout), but Crate 
also carries some A1 guest beers and a truly excellent range of bottles and 
cans. Its fridges include selections from key craft brewers such as Kernel, 
Wild Beer and Evil Twin, some real connoisseur’s classics (Old Chimney’s Good 
King Henry stout), and several rare imports and one-offs from bottles of 
Oregon-based Hop Valley’sAlpha Centauri imperial IPA 
<http://hopvalleybrewing.com/beer/> to Thornbridge’s 10th anniversary special, 
Jaipur X <http://www.thornbridgebrewery.co.uk/beers.php>. Such stock is 
evidence of how dedicated hop-heads are travelling to this burgeoning beer 
enclave in increasing numbers.Howling Hops 
<http://www.howlinghops.co.uk/brewery.htm> also brews in Queen’s Yard (see 
entry), while, a short walk along the canal, thePlough at Swan Wharf 
<http://hackneyplough.co.uk/swan-wharf/> – a cafe-bar with a huge, grungy 
courtyard terrace – serves a compact range of craft ales, including beers by 
another Hackney Wick brewery,Truman’s <http://www.trumansbeer.co.uk/> (pint

This freehouse by Old Street tube station has been run by the Durrant family 
for the past 51 years, but no one could accuse of them of letting the grass 
grow. You can still get a pint of Fuller’s London Pride here, but the 
Fountain’s fridges and 17 cask and keg pumps otherwise offer a sterling array 
of contemporary craft goodies. About half the pumps are given over to London 
breweries, such as Five Points, Partizan and Camden Town, but, perhaps more 
interesting is the regularity with which less obvious brewers from across the 
UK are given a run out on the taps. This fly-past was notable for the 
appearance of a couple of beers from Macclesfield’s Red Willow, while you can 
expect to see beers from such remote craft stars as Argyll’s Fyne, Cornwall’s 
Harbour or Cumbria’s Hawkeshead, to name but a few. If your tastes are more 
transatlantic, the fridges contain plenty of US bottled beers too.

Small brewpub chain Zerodegrees <http://www.zerodegrees.co.uk/> would probably 
take issue with Howling Hops’ claim to be “The UK’s first dedicated tank bar.” 
But, that point of order aside, there is a lot to like about this venue where 
you can drink fresh beer, direct and unfiltered, from 10 huge steel tanks. This 
rough-edged warehouse space is very much a working brewery. If you nip to the 
loo, you might see the bottling line in action and there are pallets of malt 
and torrified wheat stacked by the entrance. What it lacks in creature 
comforts, however, this place certainly makes up for in tasty beer. Its pale XX 
uses citra, cascade, centennial, simcoe and cascade hops, to create a 
firecracker of a brew, one florid with sherbet, gooseberry and lime flavours.

If your idea of a good time is not just drinking beer, but simultaneously 
choosing more beer to take home to drink later, then you will love Mother 
Kelly’s. This railway arch bar and bottle shop is home to several huge fridges 
stacked with superb beers to drink-in or takeaway, many of them lesser-known, 
highly-rated imports, such as Natt imperial porter from Norwegians Ægir or the 
US Tunnel Vision IPA. That quality and global perspective continues at the bar 
where influential UK brewers (Magic Rock, Northern Monk) rub shoulders, across 
19 keg taps, with new names such as Estonian micro, Põhjala. At just 2.8%, the 
Siren Half Mast IPA I sampled here was one of the most layered and complex 
sub-3% beers I have ever tasted. Friendly staff and a warm feel mean Mother 
Kelly’s is somewhere you will happily linger, too. Although, if you want to 
keep moving, it is worth noting that Redchurch Brewery’s nearby tap room is 
open Thurs-Sat (schooners from £2.30, 275-276 Poyser Street, 020-3487 0255;
theredchurchbrewery.com <http://www.theredchurchbrewery.com/>). Where better to 
drink its Great Eastern? Arguably, the best British IPA.

The Kings Arms’ owner, Barworks (in east London, see also the Well & Bucket 
<http://www.wellandbucket.com/> and the Singer Tavern <http://singertavern.com/>
), is on a mission to prove how, if you put great beer front and centre, pubs 
can thrive, even at a time when some 30 are closing every week. The Kings Arms 
is militant in that regard. It’s on a residential side-street, and is an 
unprepossessing space – a simple dark green, wood-panelled room – that serves 
minimal food, but which has astounding beer to spare. Two fridges are packed 
with imports from iconic craft brewers such as Mikkeller, Crooked Stave and 3 
Floyds, while 12 keg and four cask pumps dispense a mix of on-point UK beers 
(Mondo, Red Cat, Big Smoke) and further exotica from foreign climes (Bronx 
Brewery’s rye pale ale, Brekeriet’s sour barrel-aged wheat beer from Sweden). A 
sample half of One Mile End’s Snakecharmer IPA, given an interesting creamy, 
peachy note from its use of the Sorachi Ace hop, was very good. If you find 
yourself in Whitechapel, One Mile End is based at theWhite Hart brewpub

This pub and gig venue may, in many ways, be the last word in east London cool 
(craft beers, street food, hip music), but, to a large extent, its charm lies 
in how it evokes a lost, very different era. A dimly lit cocoon of carved wood 
panelling and red velour banquettes, it looks – but for the lack of fag smoke – 
like the kind of vintage East End boozer that used to feature in old episodes 
of Minder. Beer-wise, thankfully, things are far more up to date. The 
Sebright’s three cask and five keg lines, as well as its compact bottled 
selection, have a notable London focus, with breweries such as Brick, Gipsy 
Hill, Mondo, Five Points, Weird Beard and Hammerton to the fore. Truman’s 
impressive Zephyr, a zesty, hop-forward pale ale, was in perfect condition.

The Fox looks like a typically gussied-up, gastrofied London pub: lots of wood 
and bare brick, some mismatched antique-y furniture and a smattering of trendy 
art. The clientele of young professionals seemed curiously unfazed by the 
background music, which veered, distressingly, from lachrymose Radio2 
indie-rock to Elton John. One thing that the Fox cannot be faulted on is its 
beer. Whoever is buying it in, clearly knows their hops, with such stellar 
names as Siren, Wild Beer, Burning Sky (arguably, Britain’s best new brewer; 
its Aurora was, as ever, a pleasure), Four Pure and Brew By Numbers jumping out 
across its cask, keg and bottled menus. Talking of bottles, the Fox has 
famously installed a craft beer vending machine that, sadly, appeared to be 
turned off on this visit.

 Barbecue delights and more at Duke’s Brew and Cue 
Duke’s is primarily a restaurant serving slow’n’low BBQ, but, as the 
birthplace of Beavertown Brewery – both businesses are owned by Logan Plant – 
its small bar area is something of a pilgrimage for beer fans. If you are happy 
to hover or are lucky enough to grab one of a handful of seats, you can work 
your way through four dedicated Beavertown keg lines (including one that 
showcases its experimental Alpha Series beers), as well as a comprehensive 
range of its cans – the dry, citrusy Quelle Saison is a particular highlight. 
Elsewhere on the bar, there are five other keg lines and one cask to go at, as 
well as a couple of fridges stocked with a very discerning selection of beers. 
From Moor’s new “live” conditioned cans (yes, like bottle conditioning, but in 
a can), to beers from California’s revered Firestone Walker, there is top 
quality on every shelf.

This huge, handsome Victorian boozer – a period piece decorated with some 
fascinating historic bric-a-brac – is, in many ways, the perfect high street 
pub. It is still a lively, unpretentious community hub (complete with 
dartboard, fruit machines and big screen football at the weekend), but one that 
has superb craft beer at its heart. It is owned by Brodie’s, whose brewery is 
next door, and you will usually find about 11 of its cask beers on, priced at 
an inclusive £2.75 a pint. Things become more exotic across eight keg lines, 
which showcase Brodie’s edgier ales, such as its Belgian coffee brown ale, its 
evolving London sours (cherry, this visit), or the barrel-aged versions of its 
pale ales and stouts. The 7.4% Soho Superior IPA was everything you would hope: 
thick’n’sweet, loaded with tropical fruit flavours and, yet, bracingly bitter. 
It certainly made the diversion up into Leyton worthwhile. Try to use Leyton 
Midland Road train station, which is only a few minutes’ walk away; the nearest 
tubes are a significant walk/bus ride away.

The Cock Tavern, Hackney


With its dark, plain interior and vintage beer pumps, the Cock Tavern is one 
of those modern pubs that longs to be a no-nonsense Edwardian beer house. A 
quick scan across its 16 cask and keg lines confirms how seriously it takes all 
things ale. The best contemporary London breweries are well-represented: 
Anspach & Hobday, Brixton Brewery, Pressure Drop and Big Smoke, whose Electric 
Eye pale was all honeyed melon with a fine, almost paracetamol-sharp bitterness 
to it. Meanwhile, high-quality additions from around the UK, beers from 
Liverpool’s Mad Hatter (never pass up a chance to drink its Toxteth IPA), 
Manchester’s Cloudwater, Berkshire’s Siren and Bristol’s Wiper & True, add 
variety to the mix. The Cock is also something of a brewing hub. Someone was 
busy making a house perry and a bit of a mess on one of the adjacent tables 
(cider is big here, too); Howling Hops started brewing in the Cock’s basement – 
its beers still feature heavily at the bar – and that cellar space is now 
occupied by new brewery,Maregade <https://www.facebook.com/maregade>. 
Apparently, it is a Danish word, pronounced mar-a-gella.
