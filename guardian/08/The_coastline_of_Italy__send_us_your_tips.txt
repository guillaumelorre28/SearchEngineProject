Italy’s coastline can stun us with its views or draw us in with its romance – 
and we want to hear what makes it so special to you, from the beaches and cafes 
that line the harbours of your favourite fishing village to great little places 
to stay within reach of the sea. Send us a tip and you could win a £200 hotel 
voucher. Contribute viaGuardianWitness <https://witness.guardian.co.uk/>. 


The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
fromHotels.com <http://www.hotels.com/>, allowing you stay in over 260,000 
places worldwide. Submit your tips by clicking on the blue button and using the 
text tab. Try and include as much detail as possible (location, any website 
addresses, prices etc) and feel free to add a photo if you own the copyright to 
it –but it’s the text we’ll be judging!


Your tip should be around 100 words long. Terms and conditions
