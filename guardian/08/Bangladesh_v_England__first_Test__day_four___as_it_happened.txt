Stumps

78th over: Bangladesh 253-8 (Sabbir 59, Taijul 11) target 286 If Taijul is a 
rabbit, he is a spirited one. He chips Batty for four over mid-on, and then 
miscues him for two more, close to Moeen at deep extra. And that is stumps, 
because Cook refuses to bowl spin alone. Story of the day, really.

But what a day: another gripping, stirring, low-scoring, nail-biting serving 
of Proper Test Creekit. Thanks for your company, and see you at 5am BST 
tomorrow for the denouement of this outstanding drama. The last email comes in 
from Julien Lesage: “Given that Batty is being rather successful with the ball, 
perhaps the selectors should be looking for a player called Bowlly to bat in 
the top order?” They certainly need someone there. But, above all, they need a 
captain who has some faith in the slower half of his attack.

77th over: Bangladesh 247-8 (Sabbir 59, Taijul 5) target 286 Broad bowls his 
NINTH over on the trot, which is verging on cruelty, although he probably 
doesn’t mind. He somehow finds the energy to bowl a ball which is both a 
bouncer and a leg-break. Sabbir ducks and evades it, and then plays at a length 
ball, and misses. A maiden, so Batty will have a full over at the rabbit Taijul.

76th over: Bangladesh 247-8 (Sabbir 59, Taijul 5) target 286 Can Taijul play 
spin? So far, he can, sort of – he lofts Batty down the ground for two, and 
squirts him for two more into a gap that doesn’t appear to be there at all, 
between Stokes at silly mid-slip and Root at silly mid-gully. Only 39 needed. 
The lights are shining brightly, and Cook seems to have been told he can only 
bowl one more over of seam.

“C’mon, two balls,” says Jonny Barstow in the middle of all that. “That’s all 
it is lads.”

75th over: Bangladesh 243-8 (Sabbir 59, Taijul 1) target 286 Broad bowls his 
eighth over in a row, which is like bowling 16 at Trent Bridge. Sabbir again 
takes a single off the first ball. Brave, Minister. But Taijul stays calm and 
collects a single himself with a poke to square leg, and then Sabbir, when he 
could take a single and keep the strike, comes back for a second.

74th over: Bangladesh 239-8 (Sabbir 56, Taijul 0) target 286 Correction: 
Sabbir doesn’t regret handing Kamrul the strike – he takes a single off the 
first ball of Stokes’s over and leaves Taijul to see out five balls, which he 
just about manages. Time for Batty.

73rd over: Bangladesh 238-8 (Sabbir 55, Taijul 0) target 286 Broad keeps 
asking good questions, and Kamrul didn’t have an answer. Sabbir may be kicking 
himself for trusting him with half an over.

“Need to write three intros for my web piece,” tweets Lawrence Booth, former 
rector of this parish. “Humiliating defeat, face-saving win, sleepless night.” 
He can stick with the face-saver for now.

Wicket!

Kamrul c Ballance b Broad 0 (238-8). A simple flip to short leg. England well 
on top: Sabbir may have to get the remaining 48 by himself.

72nd over: Bangladesh 237-7 (Sabbir 54, Kamrul 0) target 286 Batty’s reward 
for making the big breakthrough is to be banished yet again. Stokes returns, 
and instantly fumbles a run-out chance, perhaps out of sheer exhaustion. He 
finds some swing, but not the edge. Sabbir risks a slog, dancing down the track 
to pick up a streaky single. Fewer than 50 needed now. Two monks have joined 
the crowd in their glowing orange robes. You don’t get that at Headingley.

71st over: Bangladesh 234-7 (Sabbir 51, Kamrul 0) target 286 Broad raises his 
game when he needs to. The ball was an inswinger, hitting the leg bail. But 
Sabbir is still there to give the home crowd hope.

“Tim,” says John Starbuck, “you need to keep a closer eye on your autocorrect, 
which has changed Bairstow into Barstow at least twice now. My system does it 
too so it’s not just you. Time to teach the computer a lesson.” You’re right – 
it’s a bairstard.

70th over: Bangladesh 234-6 (Sabbir 51, Mehedi 1) target 286 Mehedi is 
confident enough to get off the mark with a sweep off Batty. Sabbir survives an 
appeal for lbw which is loud from Bairstow, but lonely. And then Sabbir goes to 
a superbfifty on debut with a resounding shot for four down the ground, not so 
much a drive as a drill.

An email arrives from Peter Davies. “Re your description of Bairstow dropping 
Broad [10.59] - one of the many things to love about cricket is that it is an 
absolute double entendre minefield. Keep up the good work.”

69th over: Bangladesh 229-6 (Sabbir 47, Mehedi 0) target 286 Sabbir, so good 
at playing the sparky junior partner, now has to be the wise old head 
shepherding Mehedi, who is 18. He starts by seeing off yet another over from 
Broad, who has gone straight from under-used to over-Cooked.

68th over: Bangladesh 227-6 (Sabbir 45, Mehedi 0) target 286 For half an over, 
Cook looked as if he might have been right to exile Batty for so long: Sabbir 
scooped him for four and swept him for three. But then Batty struck, finding 
extra bounce to go with his turn, and Ballance did the rest. Good captaincy, in 
the end.

Wicket! Mushfiqur c Ballance b Batty 39 (227-6)

Batty does the trick! A fine, patient innings from Mushfiqur ends with a catch 
at short leg, and England are back on top.

67th over: Bangladesh 219-5 (Mushfiqur 38, Sabbir 38) target 286 A boundary! 
The first for several weeks. Broad tries a bouncer and Mushfiqur pulls it 
elegantly in front of square, just the way his coach told him to. Broad 
responds with a fine yorker and an lbw appeal; Cook thinks about a review, but 
runs out of time. This pair have now climbed more than halfway to the summit – 
they’ve added 79, and only 67 more are needed. That summit, if conquered, will 
be the highest peak in Bangladesh’s history.

66th over: Bangladesh 210-5 (Mushfiqur 33, Sabbir 38) target 286 Rashid 
continues too, making you wonder if Cook has officially gone to sleep. Sabbir 
plays a tennis shot for a single – forehand, topspin – to keep himself awake. 
Rashid is getting some turn, and Moeen and Batty must be wondering what they 
have to do to get a go.

64th over: Bangladesh 206-5 (Mushfiqur 31, Sabbir 36) target 286 Rashid 
continues in his unaccustomed role as the only spinner Cook trusts. Bangladesh 
carry on getting ’em in singles, and that’sdrinks. The last hour belonged to 
the batsmen, and to the enduring magic of Test cricket.

“Hello Tim,” says Robert Darby. “The odds on a draw may be 4000 to 1, but what 
about a tie? Have a strange feeling about this.” You should get even better 
odds.

Sabbir tickles Broad and Bairstow can’t get down low enough to hold on. A blot 
on a phenomenal performance.

62nd over: Bangladesh 202-5 (Mushfiqur 29, Sabbir 34) target 286 Rashid flips 
a leg-break past Sabbir’s outside edge, but that’s as good as it gets. The 
batsmen take a single apiece. If anyone in the Barmy Army is reading this, 
please can they start chanting Gareth Batty’s name.

61st over: Bangladesh 200-5 (Mushfiqur 28, Sabbir 33) target 286 Woakes gives 
way to Broad, so Batty’s ostracism continues. And so does the stalemate. The 
spinners have taken all five wickets to fall, but Cook won’t risk them because 
they’ve gone for twice as many runs as the three seamers. The thing is, they 
wouldn’t have gone for those runs if Cook hadn’t allowed so many singles.

60th over: Bangladesh 200-5 (Mushfiqur 28, Sabbir 33) target 286 Rashid 
concedes a few and then loses his length, dishing up a half-tracker which keeps 
so low that Sabbir can’t cash in. Still, six off the over and every innings in 
the match has been in the 200s, which is just as it should be for maximum 
suspense.

59th over: Bangladesh 194-5 (Mushfiqur 24, Sabbir 31) target 286 Another 
maiden from Woakes. The draw is now 4000/1 at the bookies’, and Cook is 
operating like a man who has a fiver on it.

“Re 49th over,” retorts Smylers, “do you really think millennials subscribe to 
anything so paper-based as the Radio Times?” Ah, good point. “I’m somebody who 
at 19:00 is often unavailable for watching live telly, cricket-based or 
otherwise, cos we’re still frantically trying to get the children into bed.”

58th over: Bangladesh 194-5 (Mushfiqur 24, Sabbir 31) target 286 Stokes 
finally comes off, and spin returns – but it’s Rashid, not Batty, who must have 
offended Cook in a former life. The field is set to allow the single; the 
batsmen help themselves from the buffet. Rashid does get one to turn and bounce 
past Sabbir’s attempted sweep, but it’s too wide to count.

57th over: Bangladesh 192-5 (Mushfiqur 23, Sabbir 30) target 286 Woakes 
continues, trying a few things – a yorker, an off-cutter that is also a slower 
ball – but all he gets is half an inside edge, and Mushfiqur survives. On Sky, 
Rob Key, who’s been a sparky addition to the team, sums up the pitch: “It’s 
played so much better than it looked.”

56th over: Bangladesh 191-5 (Mushfiqur 23, Sabbir 29) target 286 The trouble 
with deadlocks is that this Bangladesh side know how to break them. Even if 
they need six leg byes to do it. The target is below 100 now, and the 
partnership above 50. Cook has to do something other than bowl his seamers to 
defensive fields.

55th over: Bangladesh 183-5 (Mushfiqur 23, Sabbir 28) target 286 Only four off 
three overs since tea. After those big hits against the spinners, Cook is 
trying to smother Bangladesh with maidens, like a tired parent refusing to 
react to a revved-up kid.

“Morning Tim,” says Andrew Howard. “If Bangladesh do win, and I’d be happy for 
them and the sport if it happens, we do need to think about the Aussie response 
to England becoming the first of the current leading nations to lose a Test v 
Ban. However, based on their abject performance in SL, would we give Aus any 
chance right now away in Bangladesh? I’d make Ban the favourites!” Interesting 
mixture of attack and defence there: a pre-emptive gloat.

53rd over: Bangladesh 182-5 (Mushfiqur 22, Sabbir 28) target 286 Sabbir, who 
is making his Test debut, looks like a quick learner. He survives a half-appeal 
for lbw against Woakes (going down), and then plays the shot he should have 
played – an easy clip for two. But England are still favourites, because the 
tail is long and these two probably need to add 70 of the remaining 100-odd.

bowling change, as Cook takes Rashid off after a single over and turns to... 
Stokes! Who has only just had a spell, and not been at his best. It must be a 
cunning plan to get Batty so riled that when he finally comes on, he fires 
England to victory.

51st over: Bangladesh 179-5 (Mushfiqur 22, Sabbir 25) target 286 Cook summons 
Chris Woakes, so that’s four bowlers in four overs and still Batty can’t get a 
look-in. Woakes produces a maiden but no threat.

“So hard to call it from here!” says Dean Kinsella. “Gripping Test match. I 
hope it goes to nine wickets down before the final denouement – either way. 
Even as an England fan, a part of me will be delighted for Bangladesh should 
they taste their first win over us.”

50th over: Bangladesh 179-5 (Mushfiqur 22, Sabbir 25) target 286 Adil Rashid 
replaces Moeen, and almost strikes, drawing Sabbir’s edge with a grubbing 
leg-break, but it keeps so low that it bounces off Bairstow’s ankle. That’stea, 
and the pot of gold is beckoning to Bangladesh. They need 107 now, and at the 
rate they are going, they will get there tonight if they get there at all.

49th over: Bangladesh 176-5 (Mushfiqur 20, Sabbir 24) target 286 Broad again, 
and no alarms for the batsmen. Come on Cook, bring back Batty – situations like 
this are crying out for someone to take charge, and he is used to doing that, 
both as a bowler and as a captain.

“Thank you to John Starbuck (21st over) for raising awareness of the ITV4 
highlights,” says Smylers. “It’s a shame that ITV couldn’t have arranged these 
sooner: the current Radio Times lists a programme called Pawn Stars in the slot 
the cricket is now scheduled, and even has a Q&A on the letters page saying 
‘terrestrial highlights of away tours seem to be a dead duck’. The ITV4 
highlights don’t seem to be on ITV Hub, and I’m not sure I’m organised enough 
to be the kind of person who watches TV at the time it’s actually broadcast.” 
Are you, by any chance, a millennial?

48th over: Bangladesh 175-5 (Mushfiqur 19, Sabbir 24) target 286 Great stuff 
from Sabbir, who clonks Moeen for six over mid-off, then waits for him to drop 
short and shovels him round the corner for four more. Cook takes fright and 
sends leg slip back to short fine leg. Twelve from the over: a change in the 
weather.

47th over: Bangladesh 163-5 (Mushfiqur 18, Sabbir 13) target 286 Intoxicated 
by his own strokeplay, Sabbir charges down the track at the other end too, 
having failed to notice that he is facing Stuart Broad. He gets away with it, 
missing the ball, then almost getting run out by a shy from Jonny Barstow, who 
is having about the best match you could possibly have while not being 
favourite for man of the match.

46th over: Bangladesh 160-5 (Mushfiqur 18, Sabbir 10) target 286 So Moeen was 
only changing ends. That’s fine by Sabbir, who trots down the track and helps 
himself to a six, his first in Tests. He has got his eye in now.

“Morning Tim,” says Alex Fergusson. “You can tell Robert Darby (36th over) to 
come on over to Juba. There’s no light breeze, but he can bring his 
(presumably) Java House coffee and there are fewer, albeit malarial, mosquitoes 
here. As I write this, we’ve just got Shakib O’Neal who was just making me a 
touch concerned.”

45th over: Bangladesh 152-5 (Mushfiqur 17, Sabbir 3) target 286 Well, we have 
a change of bowling, but it’s not Batty for Stokes, it’s Broad for Moeen. Is 
Alistair Cook becoming creative in hs old age? Broad, bowling only his second 
over of this innings, nearly nabs Sabbir, inside-edging a length ball, then 
driving airily at an outswinger.

45th over: Bangladesh 150-5 (Mushfiqur 17, Sabbir 1) target 286 My message 
about a change of bowling mysteriously fails to reach Cook. Stokes continues to 
get 10/10 for effort, but Mushfiqur continues to keep him out and even picks up 
four with a semi-retracted push through the slips, to bring up a spirited 150.

44th over: Bangladesh 146-5 (Mushfiqur 13, Sabbir 1) target 286 Mushfiqur 
looks at the scale of the task and is he daunted? He is not. He lofts Moeen for 
four over mid-on, forcing the aged Batty to throw himself into the squishy 
Toblerone on the boundary. Even if they crumble now, Bangladesh have shown 
great attitude.

43rd over: Bangladesh 140-5 (Mushfiqur 8, Sabbir 0) target 286 Stokes bends 
his back, bowls some short stuff, then slips in the full one, but Mushfiqur 
sees it coming. A maiden, but not a threatening one. Time to get Stokes off and 
Batty back on.

42nd over: Bangladesh 140-5 (Mushfiqur 8, Sabbir 0) target 286 That’s a big, 
big wicket. Shakib did nothing wrong, getting studiously forward – it was just 
a lovely ball from Moeen, a crisp catch by Bairstow, and an excellent move by 
Cook to bring Mo back.

A beauty from Moeen, turning and taking the edge from round the wicket, and 
now England are right on top.

40th over: Bangladesh 138-4 (Shakib 23, Mushfiqur 7) target 286 Stokes again, 
anodyne again by his high standards. The batsmen take a single and a bye, and 
Cook turns to Moeen.

the man of the match so far, continues in his role as England’s specialist 
reverser. He gets some swing but it’s gentle, not jagged, and Mushfiqur has no

Morning everyone, and big thanks to Dan for taking the early shift. When I 
emailed him at lunchtime, he was just making his seventh cup of tea, to go with 
two coffees: the cricket writer’s version of the 7-2 field.

Dan’s stint brought six wickets and let’s hope mine does the same, as long as 
the cricket gods give Bangladesh some runs too. This has been such a good 
contest – tight, gripping, not just turning but twisting – and it has a chance 
of going right to the wire.

37th over: Bangladesh 130-4 (Shakib 19, Mushfiqur 4) target 286 Shakib gets a 
couple when Rashid drifts one too floaty and wide of off and the batsman 
plunders them through cover. Rashid looks a bit tired out there and I reckon it 
might be an idea to get Moeen back on with the left-hander there. Indeed the 
left hander looks confident: he waits for the fuller ball, in the slot, and 
clambers into it, sending it sailing over the long-on rope and into the crowd 
for the first six of the innings.

That’s drinks and that’s the end of me for this Test. Tim de Lisle will take 
you through to the close today, when England might or might not win this.

36th over: Bangladesh 122-4 (Shakib 11, Mushfiqur 4) target 286 Here is Ben 
Stokes and the ball is reversing from the very first delivery. He pushes his 
third delivery a bit fuller and the Bangladesh captain can’t resist the drive; 
he’s fine though as the edge flies low through vacant third slip and down to 
third man for a single. That was encouraging for Stokes though.

“Good morning Dan from Nairobi,” writes Robert Darby. The sun is shining, 
there is a light breeze and England are beating Bangladesh. I have just had a 
cup of Kenyan coffee, probably the best in the world, so all is hunky-dory. The 
only fly in the ointment, so to speak, is that we are suffering from more 
mosquitoes than I can remember. Fortunately at our altitude they don’t carry 
malaria. The buggers can still give a nasty bite, though.”

Mike Robson writes: “In Dhaka, two hours back with the score at 57/1, I bet my 
admin manager Ekramul Hoque 200 Taka England to win, 500 to him in case of 
Bangladesh pulling it out of the fire. Things looking rosier now, but I can’t 
watch or the whole office will grind to a halt.”

In London, at 8.35am, in freezing October and five hours into my shift, I’m 
beginning to resent these.

35th over: Bangladesh 120-4 (Shakib 10, Mushfiqur 3) target 286 The quicker 
balls from Rashid are causing real damage now: a 90kph dart explodes out the 
surface on its way through to Shakib. Unperturbed, the batsman drives the final 
ball with a dismissive and elegant swish of the bat, back past the bowler for 
four. And here comes a bowling change...

34th over: Bangladesh 115-4 (Shakib 6, Mushfiqur 2) target 286 Batty’s first 
spell was none for 25 from seven overs; this one is now two for 17 from six. 
Stokes is warming up, which suggests England think this ball might start to 
reverse soon.

78th over: Bangladesh 253-8 (Sabbir 59, Taijul 11) target 286 If Taijul is a 
rabbit, he is a spirited one. He chips Batty for four over mid-on, and then 
miscues him for two more, close to Moeen at deep extra. And that is stumps, 
because Cook refuses to bowl spin alone. Story of the day, really.

But what a day: another gripping, stirring, low-scoring, nail-biting serving 
of Proper Test Creekit. Thanks for your company, and see you at 5am BST 
tomorrow for the denouement of this outstanding drama. The last email comes in 
from Julien Lesage: “Given that Batty is being rather successful with the ball, 
perhaps the selectors should be looking for a player called Bowlly to bat in 
the top order?” They certainly need someone there. But, above all, they need a 
captain who has some faith in the slower half of his attack.
 
77th over: Bangladesh 247-8 (Sabbir 59, Taijul 5) target 286 Broad bowls his 
NINTH over on the trot, which is verging on cruelty, although he probably 
doesn’t mind. He somehow finds the energy to bowl a ball which is both a 
bouncer and a leg-break. Sabbir ducks and evades it, and then plays at a length 
ball, and misses. A maiden, so Batty will have a full over at the rabbit Taijul.
 
76th over: Bangladesh 247-8 (Sabbir 59, Taijul 5) target 286 Can Taijul play 
spin? So far, he can, sort of – he lofts Batty down the ground for two, and 
squirts him for two more into a gap that doesn’t appear to be there at all, 
between Stokes at silly mid-slip and Root at silly mid-gully. Only 39 needed. 
The lights are shining brightly, and Cook seems to have been told he can only 
bowl one more over of seam.

“C’mon, two balls,” says Jonny Barstow in the middle of all that. “That’s all 
it is lads.”

 
This match has been a microcosm of his bizarre career.
 
75th over: Bangladesh 243-8 (Sabbir 59, Taijul 1) target 286 Broad bowls his 
eighth over in a row, which is like bowling 16 at Trent Bridge. Sabbir again 
takes a single off the first ball. Brave, Minister. But Taijul stays calm and 
collects a single himself with a poke to square leg, and then Sabbir, when he 
could take a single and keep the strike, comes back for a second.
 
74th over: Bangladesh 239-8 (Sabbir 56, Taijul 0) target 286 Correction: 
Sabbir doesn’t regret handing Kamrul the strike – he takes a single off the 
first ball of Stokes’s over and leaves Taijul to see out five balls, which he 
just about manages. Time for Batty.
 
73rd over: Bangladesh 238-8 (Sabbir 55, Taijul 0) target 286 Broad keeps 
asking good questions, and Kamrul didn’t have an answer. Sabbir may be kicking 
himself for trusting him with half an over.

“Need to write three intros for my web piece,” tweets Lawrence Booth, former 
rector of this parish. “Humiliating defeat, face-saving win, sleepless night.” 
He can stick with the face-saver for now.
 
Kamrul c Ballance b Broad 0 (238-8). A simple flip to short leg. England well 
on top: Sabbir may have to get the remaining 48 by himself.
 
72nd over: Bangladesh 237-7 (Sabbir 54, Kamrul 0) target 286 Batty’s reward 
for making the big breakthrough is to be banished yet again. Stokes returns, 
and instantly fumbles a run-out chance, perhaps out of sheer exhaustion. He 
finds some swing, but not the edge. Sabbir risks a slog, dancing down the track 
to pick up a streaky single. Fewer than 50 needed now. Two monks have joined 
the crowd in their glowing orange robes. You don’t get that at Headingley.
 
71st over: Bangladesh 234-7 (Sabbir 51, Kamrul 0) target 286 Broad raises his 
game when he needs to. The ball was an inswinger, hitting the leg bail. But 
Sabbir is still there to give the home crowd hope.

“Tim,” says John Starbuck, “you need to keep a closer eye on your autocorrect, 
which has changed Bairstow into Barstow at least twice now. My system does it 
too so it’s not just you. Time to teach the computer a lesson.” You’re right – 
it’s a bairstard.
 
Mehedi lbw b Broad 1 (234-7). Reward for Cook’s boundless faith in his fellow 
veteran.
 
Broad gets an lbw against Mehedi, or does he? Bangladesh review, but it looks 
out...
 
70th over: Bangladesh 234-6 (Sabbir 51, Mehedi 1) target 286 Mehedi is 
confident enough to get off the mark with a sweep off Batty. Sabbir survives an 
appeal for lbw which is loud from Bairstow, but lonely. And then Sabbir goes to 
a superbfifty on debut with a resounding shot for four down the ground, not so 
much a drive as a drill.

An email arrives from Peter Davies. “Re your description of Bairstow dropping 
Broad [10.59] - one of the many things to love about cricket is that it is an 
absolute double entendre minefield. Keep up the good work.”

 
69th over: Bangladesh 229-6 (Sabbir 47, Mehedi 0) target 286 Sabbir, so good 
at playing the sparky junior partner, now has to be the wise old head 
shepherding Mehedi, who is 18. He starts by seeing off yet another over from 
Broad, who has gone straight from under-used to over-Cooked.
 
68th over: Bangladesh 227-6 (Sabbir 45, Mehedi 0) target 286 For half an over, 
Cook looked as if he might have been right to exile Batty for so long: Sabbir 
scooped him for four and swept him for three. But then Batty struck, finding 
extra bounce to go with his turn, and Ballance did the rest. Good captaincy, in 
the end.
 
Batty does the trick! A fine, patient innings from Mushfiqur ends with a catch 
at short leg, and England are back on top.
 
It hasn’t quite been 11 years this time – it just feels like it.
 
67th over: Bangladesh 219-5 (Mushfiqur 38, Sabbir 38) target 286 A boundary! 
The first for several weeks. Broad tries a bouncer and Mushfiqur pulls it 
elegantly in front of square, just the way his coach told him to. Broad 
responds with a fine yorker and an lbw appeal; Cook thinks about a review, but 
runs out of time. This pair have now climbed more than halfway to the summit – 
they’ve added 79, and only 67 more are needed. That summit, if conquered, will 
be the highest peak in Bangladesh’s history.
 
66th over: Bangladesh 210-5 (Mushfiqur 33, Sabbir 38) target 286 Rashid 
continues too, making you wonder if Cook has officially gone to sleep. Sabbir 
plays a tennis shot for a single – forehand, topspin – to keep himself awake. 
Rashid is getting some turn, and Moeen and Batty must be wondering what they 
have to do to get a go.
 
65th over: Bangladesh 206-5 (Mushfiqur 31, Sabbir 36) target 286 Broad is 
still on, for reasons best known to Cook, who gets the maiden he wants, but not 
the wicket he needs.
 
64th over: Bangladesh 206-5 (Mushfiqur 31, Sabbir 36) target 286 Rashid 
continues in his unaccustomed role as the only spinner Cook trusts. Bangladesh 
carry on getting ’em in singles, and that’sdrinks. The last hour belonged to 
the batsmen, and to the enduring magic of Test cricket.

“Hello Tim,” says Robert Darby. “The odds on a draw may be 4000 to 1, but what 
about a tie? Have a strange feeling about this.” You should get even better 
odds.
 
63rd over: Bangladesh 204-5 (Mushfiqur 30, Sabbir 35) target 286 A 
heart-breaker for Broad, and a chest-beater for Bairstow, who had been immense 
up to that point. There’s still time for England to recover.
 
Sabbir tickles Broad and Bairstow can’t get down low enough to hold on. A blot 
on a phenomenal performance.
 
62nd over: Bangladesh 202-5 (Mushfiqur 29, Sabbir 34) target 286 Rashid flips 
a leg-break past Sabbir’s outside edge, but that’s as good as it gets. The 
batsmen take a single apiece. If anyone in the Barmy Army is reading this, 
please can they start chanting Gareth Batty’s name.
 
61st over: Bangladesh 200-5 (Mushfiqur 28, Sabbir 33) target 286 Woakes gives 
way to Broad, so Batty’s ostracism continues. And so does the stalemate. The 
spinners have taken all five wickets to fall, but Cook won’t risk them because 
they’ve gone for twice as many runs as the three seamers. The thing is, they 
wouldn’t have gone for those runs if Cook hadn’t allowed so many singles.
 
60th over: Bangladesh 200-5 (Mushfiqur 28, Sabbir 33) target 286 Rashid 
concedes a few and then loses his length, dishing up a half-tracker which keeps 
so low that Sabbir can’t cash in. Still, six off the over and every innings in 
the match has been in the 200s, which is just as it should be for maximum 
suspense.
 
59th over: Bangladesh 194-5 (Mushfiqur 24, Sabbir 31) target 286 Another 
maiden from Woakes. The draw is now 4000/1 at the bookies’, and Cook is 
operating like a man who has a fiver on it.

“Re 49th over,” retorts Smylers, “do you really think millennials subscribe to 
anything so paper-based as the Radio Times?” Ah, good point. “I’m somebody who 
at 19:00 is often unavailable for watching live telly, cricket-based or 
otherwise, cos we’re still frantically trying to get the children into bed.”
 
58th over: Bangladesh 194-5 (Mushfiqur 24, Sabbir 31) target 286 Stokes 
finally comes off, and spin returns – but it’s Rashid, not Batty, who must have 
offended Cook in a former life. The field is set to allow the single; the 
batsmen help themselves from the buffet. Rashid does get one to turn and bounce 
past Sabbir’s attempted sweep, but it’s too wide to count.
 
57th over: Bangladesh 192-5 (Mushfiqur 23, Sabbir 30) target 286 Woakes 
continues, trying a few things – a yorker, an off-cutter that is also a slower 
ball – but all he gets is half an inside edge, and Mushfiqur survives. On Sky, 
Rob Key, who’s been a sparky addition to the team, sums up the pitch: “It’s 
played so much better than it looked.”
 
56th over: Bangladesh 191-5 (Mushfiqur 23, Sabbir 29) target 286 The trouble 
with deadlocks is that this Bangladesh side know how to break them. Even if 
they need six leg byes to do it. The target is below 100 now, and the 
partnership above 50. Cook has to do something other than bowl his seamers to 
defensive fields.
 
55th over: Bangladesh 183-5 (Mushfiqur 23, Sabbir 28) target 286 Only four off 
three overs since tea. After those big hits against the spinners, Cook is 
trying to smother Bangladesh with maidens, like a tired parent refusing to 
react to a revved-up kid.

“Morning Tim,” says Andrew Howard. “If Bangladesh do win, and I’d be happy for 
them and the sport if it happens, we do need to think about the Aussie response 
to England becoming the first of the current leading nations to lose a Test v 
Ban. However, based on their abject performance in SL, would we give Aus any 
chance right now away in Bangladesh? I’d make Ban the favourites!” Interesting 
mixture of attack and defence there: a pre-emptive gloat.
 
53rd over: Bangladesh 182-5 (Mushfiqur 22, Sabbir 28) target 286 Sabbir, who 
is making his Test debut, looks like a quick learner. He survives a half-appeal 
for lbw against Woakes (going down), and then plays the shot he should have 
played – an easy clip for two. But England are still favourites, because the 
tail is long and these two probably need to add 70 of the remaining 100-odd.
 
52nd over: Bangladesh 180-5 (Mushfiqur 22, Sabbir 26) target 286 Yet ANOTHER 
bowling change, as Cook takes Rashid off after a single over and turns to... 
Stokes! Who has only just had a spell, and not been at his best. It must be a 
cunning plan to get Batty so riled that when he finally comes on, he fires 
England to victory.
 
51st over: Bangladesh 179-5 (Mushfiqur 22, Sabbir 25) target 286 Cook summons 
Chris Woakes, so that’s four bowlers in four overs and still Batty can’t get a 
look-in. Woakes produces a maiden but no threat.

“So hard to call it from here!” says Dean Kinsella. “Gripping Test match. I 
hope it goes to nine wickets down before the final denouement – either way. 
Even as an England fan, a part of me will be delighted for Bangladesh should 
they taste their first win over us.”

 
50th over: Bangladesh 179-5 (Mushfiqur 22, Sabbir 25) target 286 Adil Rashid 
replaces Moeen, and almost strikes, drawing Sabbir’s edge with a grubbing 
leg-break, but it keeps so low that it bounces off Bairstow’s ankle. That’stea, 
and the pot of gold is beckoning to Bangladesh. They need 107 now, and at the 
rate they are going, they will get there tonight if they get there at all.
 
49th over: Bangladesh 176-5 (Mushfiqur 20, Sabbir 24) target 286 Broad again, 
and no alarms for the batsmen. Come on Cook, bring back Batty – situations like 
this are crying out for someone to take charge, and he is used to doing that, 
both as a bowler and as a captain.

“Thank you to John Starbuck (21st over) for raising awareness of the ITV4 
highlights,” says Smylers. “It’s a shame that ITV couldn’t have arranged these 
sooner: the current Radio Times lists a programme called Pawn Stars in the slot 
the cricket is now scheduled, and even has a Q&A on the letters page saying 
‘terrestrial highlights of away tours seem to be a dead duck’. The ITV4 
highlights don’t seem to be on ITV Hub, and I’m not sure I’m organised enough 
to be the kind of person who watches TV at the time it’s actually broadcast.” 
Are you, by any chance, a millennial?
 
48th over: Bangladesh 175-5 (Mushfiqur 19, Sabbir 24) target 286 Great stuff 
from Sabbir, who clonks Moeen for six over mid-off, then waits for him to drop 
short and shovels him round the corner for four more. Cook takes fright and 
sends leg slip back to short fine leg. Twelve from the over: a change in the 
weather.
 
47th over: Bangladesh 163-5 (Mushfiqur 18, Sabbir 13) target 286 Intoxicated 
by his own strokeplay, Sabbir charges down the track at the other end too, 
having failed to notice that he is facing Stuart Broad. He gets away with it, 
missing the ball, then almost getting run out by a shy from Jonny Barstow, who 
is having about the best match you could possibly have while not being 
favourite for man of the match.
 
46th over: Bangladesh 160-5 (Mushfiqur 18, Sabbir 10) target 286 So Moeen was 
only changing ends. That’s fine by Sabbir, who trots down the track and helps 
himself to a six, his first in Tests. He has got his eye in now.

“Morning Tim,” says Alex Fergusson. “You can tell Robert Darby (36th over) to 
come on over to Juba. There’s no light breeze, but he can bring his 
(presumably) Java House coffee and there are fewer, albeit malarial, mosquitoes 
here. As I write this, we’ve just got Shakib O’Neal who was just making me a 
touch concerned.”

 
45th over: Bangladesh 152-5 (Mushfiqur 17, Sabbir 3) target 286 Well, we have 
a change of bowling, but it’s not Batty for Stokes, it’s Broad for Moeen. Is 
Alistair Cook becoming creative in hs old age? Broad, bowling only his second 
over of this innings, nearly nabs Sabbir, inside-edging a length ball, then 
driving airily at an outswinger.
 
45th over: Bangladesh 150-5 (Mushfiqur 17, Sabbir 1) target 286 My message 
about a change of bowling mysteriously fails to reach Cook. Stokes continues to 
get 10/10 for effort, but Mushfiqur continues to keep him out and even picks up 
four with a semi-retracted push through the slips, to bring up a spirited 150.
 
44th over: Bangladesh 146-5 (Mushfiqur 13, Sabbir 1) target 286 Mushfiqur 
looks at the scale of the task and is he daunted? He is not. He lofts Moeen for 
four over mid-on, forcing the aged Batty to throw himself into the squishy 
Toblerone on the boundary. Even if they crumble now, Bangladesh have shown 
great attitude.
 
43rd over: Bangladesh 140-5 (Mushfiqur 8, Sabbir 0) target 286 Stokes bends 
his back, bowls some short stuff, then slips in the full one, but Mushfiqur 
sees it coming. A maiden, but not a threatening one. Time to get Stokes off and 
Batty back on.
 
42nd over: Bangladesh 140-5 (Mushfiqur 8, Sabbir 0) target 286 That’s a big, 
big wicket. Shakib did nothing wrong, getting studiously forward – it was just 
a lovely ball from Moeen, a crisp catch by Bairstow, and an excellent move by 
Cook to bring Mo back.
 
A beauty from Moeen, turning and taking the edge from round the wicket, and 
now England are right on top.
 
40th over: Bangladesh 138-4 (Shakib 23, Mushfiqur 7) target 286 Stokes again, 
anodyne again by his high standards. The batsmen take a single and a bye, and 
Cook turns to Moeen.
 
39th over: Bangladesh 136-4 (Shakib 23, Mushfiqur 6) target 286 Shakib plays 
Rashid confidently, swatting him into the off side. The game needs a fifty 
partnership here, and these two are half way there.
 
38th over: Bangladesh 130-4 (Shakib 19, Mushfiqur 4) target 286 Ben Stokes, 
the man of the match so far, continues in his role as England’s specialist 
reverser. He gets some swing but it’s gentle, not jagged, and Mushfiqur has no 
trouble defending.
 
Morning everyone, and big thanks to Dan for taking the early shift. When I 
emailed him at lunchtime, he was just making his seventh cup of tea, to go with 
two coffees: the cricket writer’s version of the 7-2 field.

Dan’s stint brought six wickets and let’s hope mine does the same, as long as 
the cricket gods give Bangladesh some runs too. This has been such a good 
contest – tight, gripping, not just turning but twisting – and it has a chance 
of going right to the wire.
 
37th over: Bangladesh 130-4 (Shakib 19, Mushfiqur 4) target 286 Shakib gets a 
couple when Rashid drifts one too floaty and wide of off and the batsman 
plunders them through cover. Rashid looks a bit tired out there and I reckon it 
might be an idea to get Moeen back on with the left-hander there. Indeed the 
left hander looks confident: he waits for the fuller ball, in the slot, and 
clambers into it, sending it sailing over the long-on rope and into the crowd 
for the first six of the innings.

That’s drinks and that’s the end of me for this Test. Tim de Lisle will take 
you through to the close today, when England might or might not win this.
 
36th over: Bangladesh 122-4 (Shakib 11, Mushfiqur 4) target 286 Here is Ben 
Stokes and the ball is reversing from the very first delivery. He pushes his 
third delivery a bit fuller and the Bangladesh captain can’t resist the drive; 
he’s fine though as the edge flies low through vacant third slip and down to 
third man for a single. That was encouraging for Stokes though.

“Good morning Dan from Nairobi,” writes Robert Darby. The sun is shining, 
there is a light breeze and England are beating Bangladesh. I have just had a 
cup of Kenyan coffee, probably the best in the world, so all is hunky-dory. The 
only fly in the ointment, so to speak, is that we are suffering from more 
mosquitoes than I can remember. Fortunately at our altitude they don’t carry 
malaria. The buggers can still give a nasty bite, though.”

Mike Robson writes: “In Dhaka, two hours back with the score at 57/1, I bet my 
admin manager Ekramul Hoque 200 Taka England to win, 500 to him in case of 
Bangladesh pulling it out of the fire. Things looking rosier now, but I can’t 
watch or the whole office will grind to a halt.”

In London, at 8.35am, in freezing October and five hours into my shift, I’m 
beginning to resent these.
 
35th over: Bangladesh 120-4 (Shakib 10, Mushfiqur 3) target 286 The quicker 
balls from Rashid are causing real damage now: a 90kph dart explodes out the 
surface on its way through to Shakib. Unperturbed, the batsman drives the final 
ball with a dismissive and elegant swish of the bat, back past the bowler for 
four. And here comes a bowling change...
 
34th over: Bangladesh 115-4 (Shakib 6, Mushfiqur 2) target 286 Batty’s first 
spell was none for 25 from seven overs; this one is now two for 17 from six. 
Stokes is warming up, which suggests England think this ball might start to 
reverse soon.
