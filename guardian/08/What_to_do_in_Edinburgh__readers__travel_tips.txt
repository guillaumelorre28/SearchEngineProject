Winning tip: Scottish Poetry Library

Stroll up the Royal Mile and, just past the Canongate Kirk, turn into 
Chrichton’s Close (next to Starbucks) to discover the haven that is the 
Scottish Poetry Library, with tasteful modern architecture and a calm and 
welcoming feel. Browse poetic tomes and biographies, and do buy, at least, a 
greetings card from Edinburgh’s most literary little gift shop.

Craigmillar Castle, three miles from the city centre, is a proper delight. It 
has all the castle essentials: intimidating curtain walls, stairs to climb, 
ramparts with terrific views – and don’t miss the arrow-slit window right by 
the final entrance to the tower. But there’s no furniture, no red ropes and no 
shuffling lines of visitors to get in the way of the imagination as you roam 
freely through a castle rumoured to be the only place where the magnificently 
unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots ever felt truly safe and relaxed. And all for 
just £5.50 (child £3.30). That’s an £11 saving on the more famous Edinburgh 
Castle. Enough for a couple of pints in theSheep Heid Inn 
<http://www.sheepheid.co.uk/> on the way back to town …

An unassuming door off the Royal Mile leads downstairs into this energetic 
live music venue and bar. The lineup is eclectic as is the crowd, and although 
this isn’t genteel by any stretch of the imagination, it is authentic, 
atmospheric and the drinks won’t hurt your pocket. Watch local bands with odd 
names (ska band Sea Bass Kid wowed us) or those from further afield. With a mix 
of genres the only thing certain is that you’ll be dancing in no time.

We were escorted down this underground street by a guide in 17th-century 
clothing who described the horrors of living in Edinburgh, particularly during 
the plague. We were shown dark, dismal rooms and told a number of dark, 
depressing stories about their inhabitants. We learned a lot about life (and 
particularly death) in 17th-century Edinburgh. At the end we had our photograph 
taken and in it both my husband and I look as if we’ve seen a ghost.

 The Falkirk Wheel on the Union Canal. Photograph: Alamy 
This restored canal runs from the heart of Edinburgh out to Falkirk, through 
lovely lowland countryside. There are pubs, restaurants and three scary high 
stone aqueducts; and at the far end it connects to the Forth and Clyde Canal 
via the Falkirk Wheel, the world’s only rotating barge elevator. Barge tours 
are available, but residential barges and boats can also be rented.

Soup genius

Union of Genius by the university campus claims to be Scotland’s first soup 
cafe. It does at least two vegan soups a day and many others, plus amazing 
olive bread. And you will probably make friends at the one dining table they

I travel to Edinburgh often and my favourite budget area is Rose Street. It 
runs parallel to Princes Street and is full of bars and restaurants so when I 
arrive late I don’t need to venture too far for delicious food (theMussel Inn 
<http://www.mussel-inn.com/> is a favourite) and real ale (the Kenilworth 
<https://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/restaurants/scotlandandnorthernireland/thekenilworthrosestreetedinburgh>
 is outstanding).

This is a must if you are into art deco and movies. It’s a step back in time 
with a red carpet feel, including glamorous movie star photographs on the 
walls. Pay a little extra for the Golden Screen tickets, and sit in comfy 
reclining chairs with footrests, enjoy complimentary drinks and snacks (bubbly 
if you pay a bit more). It’s certainly a change from modern cinemas, and the 
staff are sweet and approachable. It’s a wonderful nostalgic experience.

The Sheep Heid Inn is Edinburgh’s oldest pub and a great place to meet locals 
from the city or Duddingston village because of its welcoming ambience, log 
fire and low-beamed ceiling. There are great views over Edinburgh’s skyline 
from the garden and traditional Scottish pub games are always going on inside – 
you’ll probably be asked to join in. Hearty grub might include Angus beef pie.

Created in 2010, this plant-packed space is tucked away behind General 
Register House. An aim is to focus on ancient traditions and folklore before 
the knowledge of such customs and beliefs is lost. Each plant tells a story. 
Rowan trees, for example, were traditionally planted to ward off witches and 
evil spirits. In gardens where rosemary is planted, they say, the woman is the 
boss. Birth, marriage, death, heraldry, tartan and famous Scots all feature, 
with excellent information boards about the 57 species. And entrance is free.
