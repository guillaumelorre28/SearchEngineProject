1 | Hiroshima Peace Memorial


Preserved from the ruins, 1945 

The greatest monuments to peace often emerge from the remnants of destruction, 
as we see in the skeletal Genbaku Dome in Hiroshima, presciently preserved by 
the city’s survivors. When the A-bomb was dropped on 6 August 1945, it 
annihilated the commercial and political centre of Hiroshima. The domed 
Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall was one of the few buildings to withstand 
the blast. A plaque at the site reads: “Let all the souls here rest in peace. 
For [we] shall not repeat the evil.” The original Japanese lacks the pronoun. 
Who is it that shall be trusted to refrain from barbarity?

2 | High Altar Cross

Geoffrey Clarke, Coventry Cathedral, 1960-1962

Coventry Cathedral is a monument to peace and reconciliation. After Luftwaffe 
bombs incinerated much of it, the rubble became endowed with sacred 
significance, including crosses formed from charred wooden beams and melted 
roofing nails. For all the power of Basil Spence’s design for the new 
cathedral, and its striking art, – including Piper windows, Sutherland 
tapestry, and Clarke and Epstein sculptures – the humble form of fused nails 
has become Coventry’s most evocative symbol. Nail crosses have been sent, like 
relics of old, around the world, and the archbishop wears one around his neck.

3 | Monument Against War and Fascism and for Peace

Jochen Gerz and Esther Shalev-Gerz, Harburg, 1986

This monument may not look like much, but that’s the point. In 1986 the 
artists unveiled a 45ft-high pillar, covered in lead, on which they invited 
visitors to inscribe their names. As sections filled up, the monument was 
lowered, until it was completely submerged in 1993. A burial stone is all that 
remains above ground, with the pillar visible from a chamber below. The 
monument doesn’t battle repression by attempting to stand for ever, but by 
sinking away, embodying repression itself. The artists write: “In the end, it 
is only we ourselves who can rise up against injustice.”

 ‘Every lost life’: 9,000 fallen remembered at Arromanches. 
4 | The Fallen

Sand in Your Eye, Arromanche, Normandy, France, 2013

Monuments do not have to be places where we passively grieve; they can also be 
objects and sites we create together. On International Peace Day 2013, the 
group Sand in Your Eye worked with volunteers to create a temporary memorial to 
the 9,000 people – from all sides – who perished on the beaches of Normandy on 
D-day, 6 June 1944. Using stencils of fallen bodies, volunteers raked the sand 
to reveal soldiers’ silhouettes, before the evening tide poignantly washed away 
the figures. While honoring the Allied victory, the work underscores the 
tragedy of every lost life.

5 | The Artists’ Tower of Protest, 1966 


Irving Petlin and Mark di Suvero, Los Angeles, 1966 

In the mid-1960s, Petlin and di Suvero hatched an idea for a collaborative 
artistic protest against the Vietnam war, resulting in the peace tower, which 
stood for several months in West Hollywood. Di Suvero designed a minimalist 
steeple, around which he and Petlin hung hundreds of small works lent by famous 
artists of the era, including Robert Motherwell, Philip Guston, Ad Reinhardt, 
Elaine de Kooning, Richard Diebenkorn, Louise Nevelson, Frank Stella, Roy 
Lichtenstein and Leon Golub. The project was recreated in New York in 2006, 
hoping to inspire a new generation of artists to protest conflict.

Barnett Newman, Houston, 1963-67 

Best known as an abstract expressionist painter, this is one of Newman’s few 
sculptures. Following the assassination ofMartin Luther King 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king> in 1968, owners John 
and Dominique de Menil offered to donate the sculpture to the city of Houston 
in King’s memory. A councillor informed them that the city preferred “a nice 
drinking fountain”. It now sits in a reflecting pool outside Houston’s 
Rothko Chapel, its severed form echoing the abrupt end of King’s life.

Phnom Penh, Cambodia, 2005 

Between 1975 and 1979, Pol Pot <https://www.theguardian.com/world/pol-pot> and 
his soldiers slaughtered 1.7 million fellow Cambodians, a fifth of the 
country’s population. The skeletons contained in this monument constitute only 
a portion of the more than 17,000 men, women and children murdered on the site 
by the Khmer Rouge, often after torture. A stupa is a historic Buddhist 
funerary structure, traditionally built to house relics of the Buddha, or other 
holy personages. Here the bones of everyday Cambodians – many now anonymous – 
become sacred, returning to them a measure of dignity, and providing a focal 
point for the ritual work of reconciliation.

 ‘Sermon on the mount’: Leonard Knight’s life work in Niland, California.

Leonard Knight, Niland, California, 1986

After a conversion experience in his mid-30s, Knight spent the rest of his 
life looking for creative ways to proclaim his message of universal love. He 
began by creating a hot-air balloon bedecked with prayers. When the balloon 
failed, he turned tobuilding a mountain out of adobe clay in the Californian 
desert <http://www.salvationmountain.us/>, which he coated with paint donated 
by visitors over the course of several decades. Until his 80s he lived in an 
old fire truck parked beside the mountain. He turned his philosophy into a 
literal Sermon on the Mount: “Love Jesus and keep it simple.”

 ‘Unlikely source of humour’: Face2Face in Bethlehem by French artist JR. 
Photograph: WpN 
9 | Face2Face

JR, Bethlehem, 2007

The Israel-Palestine conflict seems like an unlikely source of humour. But as 
JR demonstrates, humour may be an important conduit for dialogue. Noting that 
Israelis and Palestinians usually only see each other through the distorting 
lens of the media,JR photographed people making funny faces on opposite sides 
of the separation barrier <http://www.jr-art.net/projects/face-2-face> between 
Israel and the West Bank, who would otherwise be neighbours. “Most of the time 
people can’t recognise who is the Israeli and who is the Palestinian, so they 
couldn’t recognise who they were supposed to be,” said JR. “They’re much more 
open than you think they are.”

10 | Imagine Peace Tower 


Yoko Ono, Reykjavik, 2007

Yoko Ono is still underrated as an artist. Indeed, it was her visionary 
conceptual art that first enraptured John Lennon. Located on an island off 
Reykjavik,this piece <http://imaginepeacetower.com/> arose from Ono’s early 
idea for a “light house” channelled through prisms. Here beams of light, 
generated by geothermal power, emanate from a wishing well, as if the hopes of 
humanity cannot help but hurtle to the skies to proclaim their message. The 
monument is both a memorial to her late husband as well as his radical vision 
of peace. To “imagine there’s no heaven” requires a prophet.
