Goodnight Mister Tom, Michelle Magorian

---

I had another recipe planned this week. I’ve been struggling to get through 
books in the past month, as my time shifts from cooking to writing, but 
recently I read one that was perfect. A dream summer book. No matter - you can 
have that one in a fortnight. Because this week, I have been blackberry picking.

There’s a walk we take when I visit my Gloucestershire family: around the 
lake, across the road, up the slope, under the old train lines, and then back 
through the village along the stream. If it’s a nice day, we may venture 
further, to hills or fields, but this weekend just gone, the weather wasn’t 
particularly nice. So we stuck to the well-trodden path, and were rewarded with 
a seasonal bonus: the blackberries are here. I have long associated blackberry 
picking with this walk; I first visited the village when I was 12, in late 
August, and I remember picking blackberries in the same place - it may have 
even been the same plants.

In addition to crumble (a given, when blackberries are in the fruit bowl and 
the September rain has arrived early), I wanted to make jam. Berry jams are 
wonderful, and blackberry jam in particular is one of my favourites. It is even 
more delicious when made with bay leaves too. It is a perfect jam for early 
autumn - the bay is warm and fragrant and the berries are still sweet, tart and 
earthy.

In Magorian’s brilliant Goodnight Mister Tom, William – a second world war 
evacuee from London – moves in with Tom, a widower living in the English 
countryside. Life in the country is healing for William, who has suffered at 
home at the hand of his mother. Just before the end of William’s first summer 
with Tom, he spends an afternoon with other children residing in the village, 
eating scones and chocolate cake (which are new to him), and picking handfuls 
of blackberries to be bottled up that evening. During rationing, when sugar was 
much more scarce, Tom and Willie wouldn’t have been able to turn all the 
blackberries into jam. Luckily, these days you can pick some up without any 
hassle, and the sugar and lemon will keep the fruit in your cupboard for much 
longer.

Blackberry and bay leaf jam

Fills a 500g jar

Ingredients 
300g blackberries 
300g granulated sugar (you can use jam sugar - which has added pectin - but I 
find that granulated works really well, and it’s much cheaper)
Juice of a lemon
 3 large bay leaves
 Pinch flaky salt

Equipment 
Small saucepan
 Potato masher 
Wooden spoon
Sterilised jar <http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-sterilise-jars>

1. Put the blackberries, lemon juice, bay leaves, sugar and salt into the 
saucepan. Squash the berries with a potato masher, to release their juice. They 
don’t need to be squashed to a pulp, just break them up a bit.

2. Place the pan over a medium heat and bring the mixture to the boil. While 
it is coming to the boil, stir it constantly, to dissolve the sugar. This 
should take around five minutes. Once at a boil, allow it to bubble away for 
eight or so minutes, until it reaches 105C. If you don’t have a thermometer, 
then you should place a plate in the freezer. Once the jam is looking thick, 
spoon some onto the freezing cold plate, let it sit for ten seconds, and then 
push the side of it. If it wrinkles, rather than stays as a liquid, it is ready.

3. Once the jam is ready, remove the bay leaves and let it sit for five 
minutes to settle, before you transfer it into the sterilised jar. Seal the 
jar. It will keep for six months in a cool, dark place. Store it in the fridge 
once it is open.

Serve with toast and butter, scones
