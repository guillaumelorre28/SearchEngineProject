 * Donald Trump’s running mate Mike Pence has forcefully batted down 
speculation that he considered dropping from the Republican ticket after video 
emerged on Friday of Trump bragging about touching women without their consent. 
Pence, a family values Christian and adiscriminatory

 sexual moralist,said <https://twitter.com/mike_pence/status/784799653547999234>
 at the weekend that he was “offended” by Trump’s remarks about grabbing 
“pussy”, that he did not “condone” the remarks and could not defend them – 
which last bitrang quite true 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/vice-presidential-debate-pence-kaine-trump-clinton>
. But Pence told CNN this morning that being tapped by Trump had been “the 
greatest honor of my life”.

 * In a conference with Republican members of Congress, House speaker Paul 
Ryan has said he won’t defend Donald Trump in the 29 days until the election 
(he hadn’t been working overtime to do so), and he hinted that Hillary Clinton 
would win the presidency. Ryan told members that they should do with regard to 
Trump whatever they needed to to win their own races. His focus, he said, was 
on maintaining a House majority to block a president Clinton. 
 * In a national poll conducted after the emergence of the Trump hot mic tapes 
but before the debate, Clinton led Trump by 11 points in a four-way race. 
 * Actual billionaire and actual philanthropist Warren Buffett has hit back at 
Donald Trump after Trump, at the debate last night, defended his (Trump’s) 
practice of carrying forward huge personal income losses to avoid paying future 
federal income taxes.

 * Mark Burnett, the reality-television icon who produced The Apprentice, has 
broken his silence about the rumored existence of tapes from the show’s filming 
that would reveal more controversial comments by Republican presidential 
nominee Donald Trump during his time as the show’s host, declaring that he has 
“neither the ability not the right” to release archived footage from the show. 
“MGM owns Mark Burnett’s production company and the Apprentice is one of its 
properties,” the joint statement from MGM and Burnett states. “Despite reports 
to the contrary, Mark Burnett does not have the ability nor the right to 
release footage or other material from The Apprentice. Various contractual and 
legal requirements also restrict MGN’s ability to release such material.”

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, speaking in 
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, compared the rise of his political movement to the 
United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union.

“I think November 8 is gonna be Brexit,” Trump said, recounting that he 
encouraged the “leave” vote, despite not knowing what Brexit was at the time. 
“I think we’re gonna win the state of Pennsylvania so big, and we’re gonna 
spend a lot of time in the suburbs over the next couple of weeks.”

Ted Cruz: 'I am supporting the Republican nominee'

Onetime presidential nominee and Texas senator Ted Cruz is standing by 
Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> despite the release of a 
video recording from 2005 showing the candidate bragging about sexually 
assaulting women.

“I am supporting the Republican nominee because I think Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is an absolute disaster,” 
Cruz told an interviewer during an agricultural tour of northwest Texas.

Cruz’s support had been an open question - the Texas senator famously withheld 
his support of Trump after the New York real estate tycoon clinched the 
Republican nomination, telling attendees of the Republican national convention 
in July to “vote your conscience” in the general election. Cruz endorsed Trump 
last month, mere weeks before the video’s release prompted numerous members of 
the Republican party to disavow the candidate.

“My differences with Donald I have articulated at great length during the 
campaign,” Cruz continued. “This is an election unlike any other but I’ll tell 
you, Hillary Clinton, I think, is manifestly unfit to be president.”

“The policies she’s advancing are the continuation of eight years of Barack 
Obama.”

The Apprentice producer: I can't release any cut footage of Donald Trump

Mark Burnett, the reality-television icon who produced The Apprentice, has 
broken his silence about the rumored existence of tapes from the show’s filming 
that would reveal more controversial comments by Republican presidential nominee
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> during his time 
as the show’s host, declaring that he has “neither the ability not the right” 
to release archived footage from the show.

“MGM owns Mark Burnett’s production company and the Apprentice is one of its 
properties,” the joint statement from MGM and Burnett states. “Despite reports 
to the contrary, Mark Burnett does not have the ability nor the right to 
release footage or other material from The Apprentice. Various contractual and 
legal requirements also restrict MGN’s ability to release such material.”

“The recent claims that Mark Burnett has threatened anyone with litigation if 
they were to leak such material are completely and unequivocally false. To be 
clear, as previously reported in the press, which Mark Burnett has confirmed, 
he has consistently supported Democratic campaigns.”

Speaking in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> suggested that 
more video recordings of him making predatory comments about women may come out 
in the future - and that if they do, he’s still not going anywhere.

“I was getting beaten up for 72 hours on all the networks for inappropriate 
words from 12 years ago, ‘locker room talk,’ whatever you want to call it,” 
Trump said, of a video from 2005 showing himbragging to a television host 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video>
 about attempting to have sex with a married journalist and sexually assaulting 
women.

“But I said to myself, ‘Wait a minute.’ And I just saw very inappropriate 
words, but Bill Clinton sexually assaulted innocent women andHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> attacked those women 
viciously.”

Donald Trump’s sex boasts: ‘When you are a star they let you do anything’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video>
“If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things,” Trump vowed, 
we’ll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate 
things.”

The statement would seem to indicate that Trump knows of more instances that 
might have been recorded, and warning that even if they were to be released, he 
will remain at the top of the Republican ticket.

RNC chair: The Republican Party is committed to Donald Trump

In a phone call with members of the Republican National Committee at 5pm this 
evening, party chair Reince Priebus told Republican leadership that the party 
is committed to electingDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as president, a decision that 
was not a given in the wake of revelations that Trump had made bragging 
comments about sexually assaulting women in 2005.

“Over the last 24 to 48 hours, there have been a lot of false rumors that we 
didn’t want to engage in,” Priebus told the RNC’s members, according to 
Politico. “Nothing has changed in terms of our support for the nominee.”

Telling the committee’s 168 members that “I think the issue was taken care of 
at the debate,” Priebus expressed more support for Trump than congressional
Republicans <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans>, who were told by 
House speaker Paul Ryan that the body’s leadership would focus on maintaining 
the party’s majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives in a similar 
conference call this morning.

Entertainment Tonight host Nancy O’Dell has responded to Donald Trump’c 
characterization of remarks he made about attempting to manipulate her into 
sleeping with him because he helped her shop for furniture, telling viewers 
that there is “no room for objectification of women,” even in “the locker room.”

“I feel that it’s very important that I address you all directly,” O’Dell 
states in the comments, set to air tonight on Entertainment Tonight. “As a 
journalist for 26 years now, it is my job to bring you news about others, 
rather than turning the focus on myself. But by now, I’m sure that most of you 
have heard the audio tape which became national news and part of the 
presidential race. My name was mentioned and, unfortunately, the release of it 
has thrown me into the middle of the political arena of which I didn’t ask to 
be a part.”

“I released a statement on Saturday and I truly mean what I said,” O’Dell 
continued. “There is no room for objectification of women, or anybody for that 
matter - not even in the ‘locker room’.”

Trump has defended the remarks, in which he also stated that his fame allowed 
him to sexually assault women without punishment, by calling them “locker room 
remarks.”

 * Donald Trump’s running mate Mike Pence has forcefully batted down 
speculation that he considered dropping from the Republican ticket after video 
emerged on Friday of Trump bragging about touching women without their consent. 
Pence, a family values Christian and adiscriminatory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/mike-pence-led-anti-lgbt-backlash-trump>
 sexual moralist,said <https://twitter.com/mike_pence/status/784799653547999234>
 at the weekend that he was “offended” by Trump’s remarks about grabbing 
“pussy”, that he did not “condone” the remarks and could not defend them – 
which last bitrang quite true 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/vice-presidential-debate-pence-kaine-trump-clinton>
. But Pence told CNN this morning that being tapped by Trump had been “the 
greatest honor of my life”.

 * In a conference with Republican members of Congress, House speaker Paul 
Ryan has said he won’t defend Donald Trump in the 29 days until the election 
(he hadn’t been working overtime to do so), and he hinted that Hillary Clinton 
would win the presidency. Ryan told members that they should do with regard to 
Trump whatever they needed to to win their own races. His focus, he said, was 
on maintaining a House majority to block a president Clinton. 
 * In a national poll conducted after the emergence of the Trump hot mic tapes 
but before the debate, Clinton led Trump by 11 points in a four-way race. 
 * Actual billionaire and actual philanthropist Warren Buffett has hit back at 
Donald Trump after Trump, at the debate last night, defended his (Trump’s) 
practice of carrying forward huge personal income losses to avoid paying future 
federal income taxes.

 * Mark Burnett, the reality-television icon who produced The Apprentice, has 
broken his silence about the rumored existence of tapes from the show’s filming 
that would reveal more controversial comments by Republican presidential 
nominee Donald Trump during his time as the show’s host, declaring that he has 
“neither the ability not the right” to release archived footage from the show. 
“MGM owns Mark Burnett’s production company and the Apprentice is one of its 
properties,” the joint statement from MGM and Burnett states. “Despite reports 
to the contrary, Mark Burnett does not have the ability nor the right to

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, speaking in 
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, compared the rise of his political movement to the 
United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union.

“I think November 8 is gonna be Brexit,” Trump said, recounting that he 
encouraged the “leave” vote, despite not knowing what Brexit was at the time. 
“I think we’re gonna win the state of Pennsylvania so big, and we’re gonna 
spend a lot of time in the suburbs over the next couple of weeks.”
 
Watch it live here:
 
Onetime presidential nominee and Texas senator Ted Cruz is standing by 
Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> despite the release of a 
video recording from 2005 showing the candidate bragging about sexually 
assaulting women.

“I am supporting the Republican nominee because I think Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is an absolute disaster,” 
Cruz told an interviewer during an agricultural tour of northwest Texas.

Cruz’s support had been an open question - the Texas senator famously withheld 
his support of Trump after the New York real estate tycoon clinched the 
Republican nomination, telling attendees of the Republican national convention 
in July to “vote your conscience” in the general election. Cruz endorsed Trump 
last month, mere weeks before the video’s release prompted numerous members of 
the Republican party to disavow the candidate.

“My differences with Donald I have articulated at great length during the 
campaign,” Cruz continued. “This is an election unlike any other but I’ll tell 
you, Hillary Clinton, I think, is manifestly unfit to be president.”

“The policies she’s advancing are the continuation of eight years of Barack 
Obama.”
 
Mark Burnett, the reality-television icon who produced The Apprentice, has 
broken his silence about the rumored existence of tapes from the show’s filming 
that would reveal more controversial comments by Republican presidential nominee
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> during his time 
as the show’s host, declaring that he has “neither the ability not the right” 
to release archived footage from the show.

“MGM owns Mark Burnett’s production company and the Apprentice is one of its 
properties,” the joint statement from MGM and Burnett states. “Despite reports 
to the contrary, Mark Burnett does not have the ability nor the right to 
release footage or other material from The Apprentice. Various contractual and 
legal requirements also restrict MGN’s ability to release such material.”

“The recent claims that Mark Burnett has threatened anyone with litigation if 
they were to leak such material are completely and unequivocally false. To be 
clear, as previously reported in the press, which Mark Burnett has confirmed, 
he has consistently supported Democratic campaigns.”

Speaking in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> suggested that 
more video recordings of him making predatory comments about women may come out 
in the future - and that if they do, he’s still not going anywhere.

“I was getting beaten up for 72 hours on all the networks for inappropriate 
words from 12 years ago, ‘locker room talk,’ whatever you want to call it,” 
Trump said, of a video from 2005 showing himbragging to a television host 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video>
 about attempting to have sex with a married journalist and sexually assaulting 
women.

“But I said to myself, ‘Wait a minute.’ And I just saw very inappropriate 
words, but Bill Clinton sexually assaulted innocent women andHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> attacked those women 
viciously.”

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video>
“If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things,” Trump vowed, 
we’ll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate 
things.”

The statement would seem to indicate that Trump knows of more instances that 
might have been recorded, and warning that even if they were to be released, he 
will remain at the top of the Republican ticket.
 
In a phone call with members of the Republican National Committee at 5pm this 
evening, party chair Reince Priebus told Republican leadership that the party 
is committed to electingDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as president, a decision that 
was not a given in the wake of revelations that Trump had made bragging 
comments about sexually assaulting women in 2005.

“Over the last 24 to 48 hours, there have been a lot of false rumors that we 
didn’t want to engage in,” Priebus told the RNC’s members, according to 
Politico. “Nothing has changed in terms of our support for the nominee.”

Telling the committee’s 168 members that “I think the issue was taken care of 
at the debate,” Priebus expressed more support for Trump than congressional
Republicans <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans>, who were told by 
House speaker Paul Ryan that the body’s leadership would focus on maintaining 
the party’s majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives in a similar 
conference call this morning.
 
An internet meme pretending that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were

Entertainment Tonight host Nancy O’Dell has responded to Donald Trump’c 
characterization of remarks he made about attempting to manipulate her into 
sleeping with him because he helped her shop for furniture, telling viewers 
that there is “no room for objectification of women,” even in “the locker room.”

“I feel that it’s very important that I address you all directly,” O’Dell 
states in the comments, set to air tonight on Entertainment Tonight. “As a 
journalist for 26 years now, it is my job to bring you news about others, 
rather than turning the focus on myself. But by now, I’m sure that most of you 
have heard the audio tape which became national news and part of the 
presidential race. My name was mentioned and, unfortunately, the release of it 
has thrown me into the middle of the political arena of which I didn’t ask to 
be a part.”

“I released a statement on Saturday and I truly mean what I said,” O’Dell 
continued. “There is no room for objectification of women, or anybody for that 
matter - not even in the ‘locker room’.”

Trump has defended the remarks, in which he also stated that his fame allowed 
him to sexually assault women without punishment, by calling them “locker room 
remarks.”
