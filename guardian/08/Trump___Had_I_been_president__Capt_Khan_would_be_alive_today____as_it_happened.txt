 * Speaking with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, Republican presidential 
nominee Donald Trump declared that if he had been president in place of either 
George W. Bush or Barack Obama, Captain Humayun Khan would be alive. 
 * “I have great respect for the Khan family, I have great respect for - I 
mean, the son is a great hero,” Trump said, when asked if he should apologize 
to the Khan family for insinuating that their grief was choreographed by the 
Clinton campaign. “But if I were president at that time, Captain Khan would be 
alive today, George, because I wouldn’t have been in Iraq.”

 * Khizr Khan, who is currently touring Virginia

 on Hillary Clinton’s behalf, called Trump’s comments “the most cruel thing you 
can say.” “There’s no sincerity in those remarks,” Khan continued. “He utters 
these words totally oblivious to the understanding of where we are, where we 
stand, what our values are, and how to be empathetic. There is one character 
that a leader must have to be the leader of a great country, to be the leader 
of the armed forces of the United States: empathy.”

 * Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has announced the location of her 
Election Night party - and it comes with a literal glass ceiling.Clinton will 
deliver remarks to supporters and volunteers at the Jacob K. Javits Convention 
Center in Manhattan on November 8, according to a release from her campaign. (

 * Donald Trump is insisting that he will spend $100 million or more of his 
own money on his presidential bid. Campaign finance documents show he’s not 
even close, the AP reports: The Republican nominee said in a CNN interview 
Wednesday that his personal investment in his campaign will top $100 million. 
He said he’s “prepared to go much higher than that.” Yet finance reports 
current through Sept. 30 show Trump, a billionaire New York businessman, has 
put about $56 million into his own campaign. To hit $100 million, he would have 
to put another $44 million into his race - far more than he’s ever contributed 
in a single month. Facebook

Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, who un-endorsed Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> after the release of video in 
which the Republican presidential nominee bragged about sexually assaulting 
women, has announced that he will vote for Trump anyway:
Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) 
I will not defend or endorse @realDonaldTrump 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump>, but I am voting for him. HRC is that 
bad. HRC is bad for the USA.

At the time, Chaffetz cited his 15-year-old daughter when he pulled his 
support.

“Do you think I can look her in the eye and tell her that I endorsed Donald 
Trump?” Chaffetz asked.

A pair of fundraisers for the Clinton Foundation attempted to steer business 
opportunities toward former president Bill Clinton,according to hacked emails 
obtained by activist group Wikileaks 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-foundations-fundraisers-pressed-donors-to-steer-business-to-former-president-1477527597>
:

In the memo, Mr. Band explained how he helped the foundation and former 
president, and found donors among his own firm’s clients. Mr. Band responded to 
the review by writing: “We appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles, and 
the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to 
protect the 501(c)3 status of the Foundation”...

In 2009, according to the memo, Declan Kelly, an Irish-American businessman 
and ally of theClintons, introduced a senior UBS Group AG executive 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/ubs-deal-shows-clintons-complicated-ties-1438223492>
, Bob McCann, to Mr. Clinton at a charitable event. “Mr. Kelly subsequently 
asked Mr. Mccann to support the foundation … [and] also encouraged Mr. Mccann 
to invite President Clinton to give several paid speeches, which he has done,” 
according to the 12-page memo. Mr. Clinton earned $1.5 million from those 
speeches.

The Clinton campaign has refused to confirm or deny the authenticity of this 
or any hacked emails obtained by Wikileaks.

Donald Trump: 'Had I been president, Captain Khan would be alive today'

Speaking with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> declared that if 
he had been president in place of either George W. Bush or Barack Obama, 
Captain Humayun Khan would be alive.


“I have great respect for the Khan family, I have great respect for - I mean, 
the son is a great hero,” Trump said, when asked if he should apologize to the 
Khan family for insinuating that their grief was choreographed by the Clinton 
campaign. “But if I were president at that time, Captain Khan would be alive 
today, George, because I wouldn’t have been in Iraq.”

Stephanopoulos, an assiduous fact-checker, countered that Trump did, in fact, 
support the war in Iraq before it began 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/19/donald-trump-confronted-with-past-support-for-iraq-war>
.

“I never supp- look, look, let’s get it straight: I was opposed to the war in 
Iraq,” Trump said, falsely. “Right from the beginning - that was way before the 
war started, and that was the first time I was ever even asked about Iraq, and 
I gave a very, like, ‘I don’t know, who knows.’ That was way before. If you 
look at just before the war started, I said, ‘don’t do it, it’s a mistake, 
you’re gonna destabilize the Middle East.’ From the beginning, I was opposed to 
the war in Iraq.”

Trump’s record on the matter has been exhaustively fact-checked 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/in-2002-donald-trump-said-he-supported-invading-iraq-on-the>
. In an interview in 2002, before the invasion of Iraq, radio host Howard Stern 
asked Trump: “Are you for invading Iraq?”

Trump answered, “Yeah, I guess so.”

“Had I been president, Captain Khan would be alive today,” Trump continued. 
“We wouldn’t have been in this horrible, horrible mistake, the war in Iraq.”

Khizr Khan, who is currently touring Virginia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/khizr-khan-trump-virginia-campaign-hillary-clinton?CMP=twt_gu>

what our values are, and how to be empathetic. There is one character that a 
leader must have to be the leader of a great country, to be the leader of the

“And he totally lacks that.”

Speaking in Kinston, North Carolina, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> was swiftly interrupted by a 
protestor, who he accused of being a Clinton campaign plant.

“Were you paid $1,500 to be a thug?” Trump said. “Was he paid? Get him out - 
get him out. Out!”

Trump then marched around the platform while the protestor was escorted out.

“Folks, did you see where, through Wikileaks, we found out that Clinton was 
paying people $1,500 plus an iPhone to go out and be violent at our rallies?” 
Trump said, referring to a discredited conspiracy theory espoused by James 
O’Keefe, of Project Veritas.” Okay? It’s a disgrace - it’s a disgrace.”

“They found our people were very tough - they found that out.”

Donald Trump in 2013: I have 'sex' in common with Ivanka

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has a long history of making 
suggestive - some might say “super creepy and gross” - comments about his 
eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump. But a newly unearthed interview from 2013 shows 
the tycoon making the connection much more explicit.

In the February 2013 interview on the Wendy Williams Show, obtained by Us 
Weekly 
<http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/donald-trump-joked-he-and-ivanka-had-sex-in-common-w446872>
, Williams asked Ivanka Trump, then 31, her favorite thing that she had in 
common with her father.

“Either real estate or golf,” Ivanka replied.

Williams then asked the elder Trump, then 67, the same question.

“Well, I was going to say sex, but I can’t relate that to her,” Trump said, 
pointing to Ivanka, who appeared embarrassed by the comment.

Donald Trump lends name to new hotel so near – and so far from – White House

Dan Roberts

It was once a brand synonymous with gold and marble; a sign of guaranteed 
opulence if not necessarily good taste. Instead, the taint of sexual assault 
claims and alleged racism hung over the formal opening of the latest building 
to bear the Trump name: the Republican presidential candidate’s newest hotel in
Washington DC <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc>.

Just 723 short steps along Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, this may 
be the closestDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
comes to the heart of political power this year, but the glitzy launch was 
meant to be the highlight of his business calendar.

Rooms during inauguration week in January were marketed at up to $500,000 
each. During asoft launch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests>
 in September, Trump ensured wall-to-wall media coverage by using the occasion 
to finally admit he had been wrong to doubt Barack Obama’s right to American 
citizenship.

But weeks of political scandal appear to have taken their toll on the brand. 
During the recent IMF meetings in Washington, usually the busiest week of the 
year for luxury hotels in the city, rooms could befound online at a significant 
discount 
<http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/trumps-d-c-hotel-shows-as-poll-sink-so-does-his-brand.html>
 compared to its sold-out rivals.


While Trump was boasting of the building’s 5ft-thick walls during Wednesday’s 
ribbon-cutting ceremony, the sound of political protest out on the street could 
be heard from inside the lobby. Overnight,Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of 
Fame 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-damaged>
 was destroyed by a vandal with a sledgehammer and pickaxe.

The candidate sounded wistful and unusually subdued as he took a break from 
the campaign trail to attend the launch. “With the notable exception of 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue, this is the most coveted location in DC. The best 
location,” said Trump.

Even the struggling campaign’s slogan, “Make America great again”, was watered 
down, perhaps succumbing to criticism that it implies the country is no longer 
at its best. ‘The United States is great. Its people are great,” said Trump, 
during brief political remarks that followed the launch.

Donald Trump, on love:

Last night was something, wasn’t it? You know, they kept 15,000 outside. They 
actually did this - they said we couldn’t allowed, they allowed 15,000 in. They 
said, ‘We’re afraid of a stampede.’ Can you imagine? Because there were so many 
people, if there were a stampede we’d be in trouble. Even out of love! Love can 
kill too.

Trump on military experts: 'I'll teach him a couple of things'

Donald Trump dismissed the expertise of former Army War College dean Jeff 
McCausland,telling ABC’s George Stephanopoulos 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hell-teach-military-expert-couple-things/story?id=43083480>
 that “You can tell your military expert that I’ll sit down and I’ll teach him 
a couple of things.”

McCausland had said that Trump’s recent comments declaring that the current 
battle for control of Mosul is a “total disaster” betrays a lack of knowledge 
on military strategy.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months 
of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN!
 <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/790337063489040384> October 23, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/790337063489040384> 
“I’ve been hearing about Mosul now for three months,” Trump said, reiterating 
his longstanding point that the essence of military strategy is surprise. 
“‘We’re going to attack. We’re going to attack.’ Meaning Iraq’s going to attack 
but with us. Okay? We’re going to attack. Why do they have to talk about it?”


“Element of surprise,” Trump said. “One of the reasons they wanted Mosul, they 
wanted to get Isis leaders who they thought were, you know, in Mosul. Those 
people have all left. As soon as they heard they’re gonna be attacked, they 
left. The resistance is much greater now because they knew about the attack. 
Why can’t they win first and talk later?”

Lois Beckett

Throughout her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has said that she 
supports the second amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners.


But many gun rights advocates say they fear she will reopen the door for 
cities and states toban private ownership  
<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/constitution-and-second-amendment/>of 
handguns, pointing to her repeated comments questioning a key US supreme court 
decision on gun ownership. Even liberal second amendment experts have called 
some of Clinton’s explanations of her position “odd”.

As one law professor who supports gun rights put it, Clinton on guns is like a 
Republican politician who claims she supports abortion rights, even as she 
opposes Roe v Wade.

At the final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her position 
that the supreme court was wrong in its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v 
Heller, which overturned Washington DC’s ban on handgun ownership, as well as a 
law that required other guns in homes to be “kept nonfunctional”.

In a controversial 5-4 decision, the court ruled that Americans have a 
constitutional right to have and use firearms in their homes for self-defense.


Clinton had dodged giving a clear answer 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/DemocraticDebate/story?id=4670271&page=1> about 
her opinion of the ongoing case during a presidential primary debate in early 
2008, though she suggested that the supreme court would probably find a full 
ban on handguns unconstitutional. But in 2015, theWashington Free Beacon 
reported 
<http://freebeacon.com/politics/leaked-audio-clinton-says-supreme-court-is-wrong-on-second-amendment/>
, Clinton told an audience at a private event that “the supreme court is wrong 
on the second amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.”


That’s an opinion that is shared by many people – including some of the 
liberal justices on the supreme court, whoargued 
<https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf> in their dissent that 
the second amendment was intended to protect the right of people in each state 
to form militias, not to limit lawmakers’ ability to regulate civilian gun 
ownership.

But that particular view is not one that is popular with the general public. A 
Gallup poll from 2008 found that73% of Americans 
<http://www.gallup.com/poll/105721/public-believes-americans-right-own-guns.aspx>
 believed the second amendment “guarantees the rights of Americans to own guns”.

Why gun rights advocates don't trust Clinton on the second amendment

With less than two weeks before the general election, Hillary Clinton’s 
campaign deployed one of its most potent weapons in the fight against 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump: Khizr Khan, the father of a 
Muslim war hero killed in the line of duty.
Father of Muslim American soldier: ‘Donald Trump, you have sacrificed nothing’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/28/khizr-humayun-khan-donald-trump-video-democrat-convention>
Khan, a Gold Star father whose impassioned speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/khizr-khan-democratic-convention-constitution-trump>
 on the final night of the Democratic National Convention helped knock Trump 
down to his current position in the presidential race, spoke on Clinton’s 
behalf to congregants and guests of a mosque in Norfolk, Virginia, home to the 
world’s largest naval base and more than 60,000 active duty military personnel.

“The courage [to speak against Trump] wasn’t ours,” Khan said at Masjid 
William Salaam, the first of three stops in Norfolk Khan made on Wednesday. 
“The courage was given to us.”

“People ask would I do it again,” Khan continued. “A million times - again and 
again and again - up until hatred and political bigotry is wiped out of this 
United States, we will continue to speak.”

Khan’s son, Marine captain Humayun Khan, was killed in 2004 by a car bomb 
after instructing the soldiers under his command to fall back from the vehicle. 
Khan was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, and is 
buried in nearby Arlington National Cemetery.


With his wife, Ghazala Khan, standing beside him, Khan excoriated Trump in a 
self-written speech at the DNC in June, describing his family as “patriotic 
American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country” whose son would never 
have been able to serve his country had Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims 
entering the United States been in place.

“If it was up to Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>
, he never would have been in America,” Khan said at the time. “Donald Trump 
consistently smears the character of Muslims. He disrespects other minorities, 
women, judges, even his own party leadership. He vows to build walls and ban us 
from this country.”

Poll: Clinton holds 9-point lead in New Hampshire, tied in Nevada

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican rival Donald 
Trump by 9 points in battleground New Hampshire - but is dead-even with him in 
Nevada,according to two new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-holds-9-point-lead-new-hampshire-tied-nevada-n673361>
 out this afternoon.

In the Granite State, which gave Trump his first victory in the Republican 
primaries, Clinton leads with the support of 45% of likely voters, trailed by 
Trump with a mere 36%. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson holds the support of 
10% of likely voters, and Jill Stein of the Green Party has 4% support.

Clinton is up seven points from the most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal 
poll of New Hampshire, which showed her lead at a mere two points.

Down-ballot, the race is much tighter: Incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte leads 
the race for reelection to the US Senate with the support of 48% of likely 
voters, with Democratic challenger Maggie Hassan at 47%.

In battleground Nevada, Clinton and Trump are tied with 43% support from 
likely voters each. Johnson holds 10% support, and Stein is not on the ballot.

Donald Trump has 'no doubts' about winning the White House

In an exclusive interview with Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-26/trump-has-no-doubts-about-winning-white-house?utm_content=politics&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-politics>
, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump dismissed polls showing 
Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on the verge of an electoral landslide in the 
upcoming presidential election.

“We are gonna win,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to do fantastically in 
Pennsylvania... I think we’re winning North Carolina,” Trump continued, naming 
two states where he has led in a single poll stretching back months.

The proof, Trump said, is in the popularity of his campaign rallies.

“You know the reason why they couldn’t get in?” Trump said, of the lines 
outside his most recent rallies. “Stampede.”

can say.” “There’s no sincerity in those remarks,” Khan continued. “He utters 
these words totally oblivious to the understanding of where we are, where we

 * Donald Trump is insisting that he will spend $100 million or more of his 
own money on his presidential bid. Campaign finance documents show he’s not 
even close, the AP reports: The Republican nominee said in a CNN interview 
Wednesday that his personal investment in his campaign will top $100 million. 
He said he’s “prepared to go much higher than that.” Yet finance reports 
current through Sept. 30 show Trump, a billionaire New York businessman, has 
put about $56 million into his own campaign. To hit $100 million, he would have 
to put another $44 million into his race - far more than he’s ever contributed 
in a single month.  
Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, who un-endorsed Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> after the release of video in 
which the Republican presidential nominee bragged about sexually assaulting 
women, has announced that he will vote for Trump anyway:
Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse)

At the time, Chaffetz cited his 15-year-old daughter when he pulled his 
support.

“Do you think I can look her in the eye and tell her that I endorsed Donald 
Trump?” Chaffetz asked.
 
A pair of fundraisers for the Clinton Foundation attempted to steer business 
opportunities toward former president Bill Clinton,according to hacked emails 
obtained by activist group Wikileaks 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-foundations-fundraisers-pressed-donors-to-steer-business-to-former-president-1477527597>
:

In the memo, Mr. Band explained how he helped the foundation and former 
president, and found donors among his own firm’s clients. Mr. Band responded to 
the review by writing: “We appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles, and 
the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to 
protect the 501(c)3 status of the Foundation”...

In 2009, according to the memo, Declan Kelly, an Irish-American businessman 
and ally of theClintons, introduced a senior UBS Group AG executive 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/ubs-deal-shows-clintons-complicated-ties-1438223492>
, Bob McCann, to Mr. Clinton at a charitable event. “Mr. Kelly subsequently 
asked Mr. Mccann to support the foundation … [and] also encouraged Mr. Mccann 
to invite President Clinton to give several paid speeches, which he has done,” 
according to the 12-page memo. Mr. Clinton earned $1.5 million from those 
speeches.

The Clinton campaign has refused to confirm or deny the authenticity of this 
or any hacked emails obtained by Wikileaks.

Khan family for insinuating that their grief was choreographed by the Clinton 
campaign. “But if I were president at that time, Captain Khan would be alive 
today, George, because I wouldn’t have been in Iraq.”

Stephanopoulos, an assiduous fact-checker, countered that Trump did, in fact, 
support the war in Iraq before it began 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/19/donald-trump-confronted-with-past-support-for-iraq-war>
.

“I never supp- look, look, let’s get it straight: I was opposed to the war in 
Iraq,” Trump said, falsely. “Right from the beginning - that was way before the 
war started, and that was the first time I was ever even asked about Iraq, and 
I gave a very, like, ‘I don’t know, who knows.’ That was way before. If you 
look at just before the war started, I said, ‘don’t do it, it’s a mistake, 
you’re gonna destabilize the Middle East.’ From the beginning, I was opposed to 
the war in Iraq.”

Trump’s record on the matter has been exhaustively fact-checked 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/in-2002-donald-trump-said-he-supported-invading-iraq-on-the>
. In an interview in 2002, before the invasion of Iraq, radio host Howard Stern 
asked Trump: “Are you for invading Iraq?”

Trump answered, “Yeah, I guess so.”

“We wouldn’t have been in this horrible, horrible mistake, the war in Iraq.”

Speaking in Kinston, North Carolina, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> was swiftly interrupted by a 
protestor, who he accused of being a Clinton campaign plant.

“Were you paid $1,500 to be a thug?” Trump said. “Was he paid? Get him out - 
get him out. Out!”

Trump then marched around the platform while the protestor was escorted out.

“Folks, did you see where, through Wikileaks, we found out that Clinton was 
paying people $1,500 plus an iPhone to go out and be violent at our rallies?” 
Trump said, referring to a discredited conspiracy theory espoused by James 
O’Keefe, of Project Veritas.” Okay? It’s a disgrace - it’s a disgrace.”

“They found our people were very tough - they found that out.”
 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has a long history of making 
suggestive - some might say “super creepy and gross” - comments about his 
eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump. But a newly unearthed interview from 2013 shows 
the tycoon making the connection much more explicit.

In the February 2013 interview on the Wendy Williams Show, obtained by Us 
Weekly 
<http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/donald-trump-joked-he-and-ivanka-had-sex-in-common-w446872>
, Williams asked Ivanka Trump, then 31, her favorite thing that she had in 
common with her father.

“Either real estate or golf,” Ivanka replied.

Williams then asked the elder Trump, then 67, the same question.

“Well, I was going to say sex, but I can’t relate that to her,” Trump said, 
pointing to Ivanka, who appeared embarrassed by the comment.
 
Nearly half an hour after he was scheduled to appear, Republican presidential 
nomineeDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has 
emerged from his private jet in Kinston, North Carolina, to speak to a smallish 
rally of supporters at an airfield.

“We are going to win North Carolina, and we are going to win back the White 
House - believe me!”
 
It was once a brand synonymous with gold and marble; a sign of guaranteed 
opulence if not necessarily good taste. Instead, the taint of sexual assault 
claims and alleged racism hung over the formal opening of the latest building 
to bear the Trump name: the Republican presidential candidate’s newest hotel in
Washington DC <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc>.

Just 723 short steps along Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, this may 
be the closestDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
comes to the heart of political power this year, but the glitzy launch was 
meant to be the highlight of his business calendar.

Rooms during inauguration week in January were marketed at up to $500,000 
each. During asoft launch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests>
 in September, Trump ensured wall-to-wall media coverage by using the occasion 
to finally admit he had been wrong to doubt Barack Obama’s right to American 
citizenship.

But weeks of political scandal appear to have taken their toll on the brand. 
During the recent IMF meetings in Washington, usually the busiest week of the 
year for luxury hotels in the city, rooms could befound online at a significant 
discount 
<http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/trumps-d-c-hotel-shows-as-poll-sink-so-does-his-brand.html>
 compared to its sold-out rivals.


While Trump was boasting of the building’s 5ft-thick walls during Wednesday’s 
ribbon-cutting ceremony, the sound of political protest out on the street could 
be heard from inside the lobby. Overnight,Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of 
Fame 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-damaged>
 was destroyed by a vandal with a sledgehammer and pickaxe.

The candidate sounded wistful and unusually subdued as he took a break from 
the campaign trail to attend the launch. “With the notable exception of 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue, this is the most coveted location in DC. The best 
location,” said Trump.

Even the struggling campaign’s slogan, “Make America great again”, was watered 
down, perhaps succumbing to criticism that it implies the country is no longer 
at its best. ‘The United States is great. Its people are great,” said Trump, 
during brief political remarks that followed the launch.

said, ‘We’re afraid of a stampede.’ Can you imagine? Because there were so many 
people, if there were a stampede we’d be in trouble. Even out of love! Love can

Donald Trump dismissed the expertise of former Army War College dean Jeff 
McCausland,telling ABC’s George Stephanopoulos 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-hell-teach-military-expert-couple-things/story?id=43083480>
 that “You can tell your military expert that I’ll sit down and I’ll teach him 
a couple of things.”

McCausland had said that Trump’s recent comments declaring that the current 
battle for control of Mosul is a “total disaster” betrays a lack of knowledge 
on military strategy.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months 
of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN!

2016 <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/790337063489040384> 
“I’ve been hearing about Mosul now for three months,” Trump said, reiterating 
his longstanding point that the essence of military strategy is surprise. 
“‘We’re going to attack. We’re going to attack.’ Meaning Iraq’s going to attack 
but with us. Okay? We’re going to attack. Why do they have to talk about it?”


“Element of surprise,” Trump said. “One of the reasons they wanted Mosul, they 
wanted to get Isis leaders who they thought were, you know, in Mosul. Those 
people have all left. As soon as they heard they’re gonna be attacked, they 
left. The resistance is much greater now because they knew about the attack. 
Why can’t they win first and talk later?”
 
Throughout her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has said that she 
supports the second amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners.


But many gun rights advocates say they fear she will reopen the door for 
cities and states toban private ownership  
<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/constitution-and-second-amendment/>of 
handguns, pointing to her repeated comments questioning a key US supreme court 
decision on gun ownership. Even liberal second amendment experts have called 
some of Clinton’s explanations of her position “odd”.

As one law professor who supports gun rights put it, Clinton on guns is like a 
Republican politician who claims she supports abortion rights, even as she 
opposes Roe v Wade.

At the final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her position 
that the supreme court was wrong in its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v 
Heller, which overturned Washington DC’s ban on handgun ownership, as well as a 
law that required other guns in homes to be “kept nonfunctional”.

In a controversial 5-4 decision, the court ruled that Americans have a 
constitutional right to have and use firearms in their homes for self-defense.


Clinton had dodged giving a clear answer 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/DemocraticDebate/story?id=4670271&page=1> about 
her opinion of the ongoing case during a presidential primary debate in early 
2008, though she suggested that the supreme court would probably find a full 
ban on handguns unconstitutional. But in 2015, theWashington Free Beacon 
reported 
<http://freebeacon.com/politics/leaked-audio-clinton-says-supreme-court-is-wrong-on-second-amendment/>
, Clinton told an audience at a private event that “the supreme court is wrong 
on the second amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.”


That’s an opinion that is shared by many people – including some of the 
liberal justices on the supreme court, whoargued 
<https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf> in their dissent that 
the second amendment was intended to protect the right of people in each state 
to form militias, not to limit lawmakers’ ability to regulate civilian gun 
ownership.

But that particular view is not one that is popular with the general public. A 
Gallup poll from 2008 found that73% of Americans 
<http://www.gallup.com/poll/105721/public-believes-americans-right-own-guns.aspx>
 believed the second amendment “guarantees the rights of Americans to own guns”.

With less than two weeks before the general election, Hillary Clinton’s 
campaign deployed one of its most potent weapons in the fight against 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump: Khizr Khan, the father of a 
Muslim war hero killed in the line of duty.
Father of Muslim American soldier: ‘Donald Trump, you have sacrificed nothing’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/28/khizr-humayun-khan-donald-trump-video-democrat-convention>
Khan, a Gold Star father whose impassioned speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/khizr-khan-democratic-convention-constitution-trump>
 on the final night of the Democratic National Convention helped knock Trump 
down to his current position in the presidential race, spoke on Clinton’s 
behalf to congregants and guests of a mosque in Norfolk, Virginia, home to the 
world’s largest naval base and more than 60,000 active duty military personnel.

“The courage [to speak against Trump] wasn’t ours,” Khan said at Masjid 
William Salaam, the first of three stops in Norfolk Khan made on Wednesday. 
“The courage was given to us.”

“People ask would I do it again,” Khan continued. “A million times - again and 
again and again - up until hatred and political bigotry is wiped out of this 
United States, we will continue to speak.”

Khan’s son, Marine captain Humayun Khan, was killed in 2004 by a car bomb 
after instructing the soldiers under his command to fall back from the vehicle. 
Khan was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, and is 
buried in nearby Arlington National Cemetery.


With his wife, Ghazala Khan, standing beside him, Khan excoriated Trump in a 
self-written speech at the DNC in June, describing his family as “patriotic 
American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country” whose son would never 
have been able to serve his country had Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims 
entering the United States been in place.

“If it was up to Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>
, he never would have been in America,” Khan said at the time. “Donald Trump 
consistently smears the character of Muslims. He disrespects other minorities, 
women, judges, even his own party leadership. He vows to build walls and ban us 
from this country.”
 
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican rival Donald 
Trump by 9 points in battleground New Hampshire - but is dead-even with him in 
Nevada,according to two new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-holds-9-point-lead-new-hampshire-tied-nevada-n673361>
 out this afternoon.

In the Granite State, which gave Trump his first victory in the Republican 
primaries, Clinton leads with the support of 45% of likely voters, trailed by 
Trump with a mere 36%. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson holds the support of 
10% of likely voters, and Jill Stein of the Green Party has 4% support.

Clinton is up seven points from the most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal 
poll of New Hampshire, which showed her lead at a mere two points.

Down-ballot, the race is much tighter: Incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte leads 
the race for reelection to the US Senate with the support of 48% of likely 
voters, with Democratic challenger Maggie Hassan at 47%.

In battleground Nevada, Clinton and Trump are tied with 43% support from 
likely voters each. Johnson holds 10% support, and Stein is not on the ballot.
 
In an exclusive interview with Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-26/trump-has-no-doubts-about-winning-white-house?utm_content=politics&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-politics>
, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump dismissed polls showing 
Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on the verge of an electoral landslide in the 
upcoming presidential election.

“We are gonna win,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to do fantastically in 
Pennsylvania... I think we’re winning North Carolina,” Trump continued, naming 
two states where he has led in a single poll stretching back months.

The proof, Trump said, is in the popularity of his campaign rallies.

“You know the reason why they couldn’t get in?” Trump said, of the lines 
outside his most recent rallies. “Stampede.”
