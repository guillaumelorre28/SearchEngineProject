I was appointed chief executive of Student Minds, 
<http://www.studentminds.org.uk/> the UK’s student mental health charity, six 
months ago and as a leader in my 20s I am often asked how I find the role. I’ve 
learned lots in my first few months and have had great insight and advice from 
sector colleagues. In the hope of encouraging more young people to grab 
opportunities in the charity sector, here are some of the highlights.

Stay grounded

No chief executive – no matter how big the charity they work for is – should 
lose sight of the grassroots. Run training and talk to your beneficiaries 
regularly. I camped in a field for Student Minds’ volunteer festival – it’s the 
best start to the role I could have had. I learned what really mattered to our 
beneficiaries.

Ask for feedback and improve

When you’re responsible for others you can end up neglecting your own personal 
development, but training and conferences and books reinvigorate us. People 
assume you don’t need feedback when you’re the chief executive, so it’s 
important to ask colleagues for suggestions on how you could improve.

Use experts

When my role was announced, a fellow chief executive offered mentoring and 
this has proved invaluable for grappling with new challenges. I’ve also reaped 
huge benefits by tapping into the understanding and expertise of our trustees.

After internal promotions it can be easy to carry on doing your old job, as 
well as your new one. It’s important to keep track of tasks and understand how 
to delegate effectively. Say no more often, and learn to say thank you, rather 
than sorry. You might just have to accept that it’s necessary to recruit for a 
replacement rather than do two jobs.

Prioritise staff health

In my experience, engaged staff know they are valued – so I aim to make staff 
wellbeing a priority. All employees attend training sessions on mental 
wellbeing and we encourage the team to look out for each other. I’ve also 
learned that workplace wellbeing must start with the chief executive, so I 
encourage staff to do sensible hours and talk about ways of coping with stress.

Small charities rock

I wouldn’t have achieved as much in a large organisation, and I certainly 
wouldn’t be a chief executive without wearing so many hats in a resourceful 
small charity. It’s the best environment for learning to adapt at pace and lead 
with agility.

Diversify income

In recent months our team established a training scheme enterprise, built 
relationships with corporates, and maintained service funding. Charity finance 
is tough but a creative team who are encouraged to try new ideas and who are 
allowed to fail at times can take it on.

Be transparent

As a sector, I think we’re poor at sharing what works, and useful information 
is often difficult to find. My generation grew up embracing open access and 
over-sharing.Charities <https://www.theguardian.com/society/charities> can and 
should widen their impact by doing the same. If you pilot an intervention, 
publish the evidence – the good, the bad and the ugly. Read this blog and 
disagree? Great! Comment, or better still, write a blog as a chief executive 
who is 10 years in to the role. I’d love to read it – we can all do more to 
learn from one another.
