Boojum

Belfast foodies talk about Boojum with almost mystical reverence. That might 
seem OTT for what, at first glance, looks like a standard Tex-Mex, 
assembly-line burrito joint, but Boojum is a cut above that. The thick and 
tender, rope-like tangle of braised, shredded beef in my fat fist of a burrito 
was excellent. Like everything else in that wrap – from a stridently hot, smoky 
salsa to the spicy, tomato-based savoury rice – it had a fresh, well-defined 
flavour. No wonder Boojum is busy.
Note: it also has a branch at Botanic Avenue

This Cuban-owned joint is alive with Latin music and rapid-fire Spanish 
instructions issuing from its small galley kitchen, and its food (mainly 
pressed, toasted Cuban sandwiches) is equally vibrant. A samplechoripán cubano 
of coarse chorizo grilled with tangy, verdantchimichurri, offered several 
layers of texture and flavour. Yellow mustard and spiced Cuban mayo added 
further pep to a sandwich which, with all that meat and cheese, could otherwise 
become a bit of a chore. It’s colourfully mocked up to look like a 
weather-beaten, sun-bleached cafe in downtown Havana, and food can be eaten 
inside or while browsing the shops in adjoiningQueen’s Arcade

This Cathedral Quarter spin-off from chef Niall McKenna’s much-raved-over 
James Street South is a buzzy, casual brasserie – complete with counter-seating 
around an open kitchen – which, until 4pm, is also great value. Each afternoon, 
dishes such as warm salad of potato, fried egg and Clonakilty black and white 
pudding; spaghetti carbonara; porcini risotto; or peppery, perfumed pastrami 
with remoulade and pieces of what resembled XXL melba toast, are all knocked 
out at £6.50. Throw in the fromage du jour for dessert and you can do two 
courses for £10 on the nose. Service is friendly and efficient, so you can eat 
and move on pretty quickly if you wish – before the staff upsell you to a large 
glass of wine. If you are on a tight budget, be strong and stick to tap water.

Depending where you start, this tiny takeaway-cafe is about 20 minutes’ walk 
from central Belfast, but plough on – it is worth it. Bollywood Spice serves 
the full gamut of Indian dishes but, as its boards extolling the virtues of 
coconut-based cookery or explainingvarutharachathu chicken curry indicate, it 
specialises in vibrant, assiduously spiced south Indian dishes. My masala dosa 
(£5) is a sound rendition. The pancake-like, fermented rice and lentil dosa has 
the correct light lactic edge: it is crispy and lacy but still malleable and it 
contains a melting potato filling reassuringly dotted with mustard seeds. A 
vegetable sambar on the side is a dense broth bobbing with whole dried 
chillies. The coconut chutneys are fresh and clean in a way that belies their 
latent heat. This was a curry with serious afterburn.

Found en route to the Titanic Quarter by the so-called Big Fish sculpture 
(actually a modest catch), Wolf & Devour is a street food van that deals in 
large meaty portions of rib-sticking fodder. There is a lot of this stuff 
about, but Wolf & Devour’s food is accomplished and its lunches are sensibly 
priced at around the £6 mark. There is a certain quiet finesse to my 15-hour 
shredded brisket sandwich, with cheese, onions and coleslaw. Not only is the 
beef bouncing with flavour, but the barbecue sauce is nuanced and the toasted 
focaccia is light and airy. Elsewhere, the menu includes burgers, harissa 
chicken flatbreads, and soda bread sandwiches stuffed with local bangers.

Despite Long’s city-centre location, tourists would be unlikely to stumble 
across this spot hidden away behind a car park, next to a heavily fortified 
police station. The mesh grill on its windows make it look shut even when it is 
open. However, the smell of beef dripping wafting down Athol Street is 
alluring, and locals swear by an institution that has been dishing up fish 
suppers for over 100 years. Long’s opening hours (afternoons only, last orders 
at 6.20pm) and the interior – simple wooden booths separated by Formica screens 
– are suitably traditional. Everything is cooked to order. Long’s ethereally 
light, yielding chips, which deliver a proper potato flavour, live up to the 
hype – as does the impeccably fresh haddock, which falls apart in firm, silky 
flakes. The batter, though, is less impressive. Deeply tanned and 
well-seasoned, it has a lovely savoury edge to it but it is a shade too thick 
and, consequently, a bit undercooked and gluey directly beneath that crisp 
outer shell. Still, good fish and chips, and Belfast’s love of Long’s is not 
sentimentality.

City-centre sister restaurant to the highly regarded Il Pirata 
<http://ilpiratabelfast.com/> (toast of happening suburban ’hood 
Ballyhackamore), Coppi deals in a similar mix ofcicchetti (small plates), 
pizzette and sharply executed pasta and risotto dishes. Bargain-hunting food 
fans should arrive between noon and 4pm, when Coppi serves a selection of main 
courses for £7. A plate of plump, pan-fried gnocchi with peppery, spicy ground 
pork was simple but full of good, accurate flavours. The broccoli was al dente 
and the Parmesan cream sauce correctly seasoned and elegant in its relative 
restraint. The space itself is a huge, dimly lit bar-restaurant, modishly 
decked out: not least with moody, black-and-white images shot by Christopher 
Martin along the route that the Giro d’Italia took when it visited Northern

A sparsely furnished, raw concrete box, busy with people tapping at MacBooks, 
Established may look like any number of modern coffee shops but it sets itself 
apart in several ways. First, its coffee is great. A sample rich, chocolatey 
flat white was knockout. Its food, while limited to a few dishes at breakfast 
and lunch, is predicated on good ingredients (breads come from the renowned
Zac’s Bakehouse <http://zacsbakehouse.com/>), and priced fairly, with most 
dishes coming in at around £5. There is an Ottolenghi vibe to lunch dishes of, 
say, lamb meatballs with hazelnut romesco and mint yoghurt or a salad of sumac- 
roasted squash with beetroot, sunflower seeds andtzatziki. A breakfast of wild 
mushrooms and spinach on good sourdough delivered a persuasive hillock of 
buttery, thoroughly seasoned funghi.

restaurants, with Love Fish and Meat Locker of interest to cash-conscious

but Deane clearly has a grasp on financial realities. The bright, airy Love 
Fish, a pristine white room dominated by a large atrium,offers a £6.50 light 
lunch menu <http://www.michaeldeane.co.uk/love-fish/menu/>. There are open 
seafood sandwiches with fries, smoked salmon, Dundrum mussels, salt and chilli 
squid, and fish and chips. The portion of my sample prawn orzo was a modest but 
polished plate of food, the dense bisque and silky grains of pasta elegantly 
punctuated by small bursts of tart, sweet semi-dried tomato. Next door, in Meat 
Locker,a tight menu of £10 mains 
<http://www.michaeldeane.co.uk/meat-locker/menu/> is served lunch/pre-theatre. 
It includes such dishes as braised pork belly with Roscoff onions and kale or 
the house burger with beef dripping-cooked chips. Talking of pre-theatre 
bargains, chef Simon McCance’s much-loved Ginger Bistro also serves a selection 
of its crowd-pleasing classics on weekday early evenings, at around £9 a pop 
(6-8 Hope Street, 028-9024 4421,gingerbistro.com <http://www.gingerbistro.com/>

 Purple corn tacos at General Merchants 
About a mile from central Belfast, this stretch of the Ormeau Road is home to 
a fast-growing cluster of trendy cafes and bars. Belfast’s second General 
Merchants (the original is in Ballyhackamore) had not been open for a week when 
I visited, but it was packed. The stylish, varnished wooden interior and 
whitewashed walls has a slightly Danish feel, but General Merchant’s brunch-y, 
all-day menu is inspired by Australian cafe culture, where good coffee and 
pan-global fusion plates are the norm. Expect the menu to feature such dishes as
huevos rancheros; pea fritters with labneh, poached eggs, sumac and pistachios; 
and toasted sourdough with Vegemite, smashed avocado, feta, mint and popped 
quinoa. At lunch, that choice is bulked out with a few gourmet sandwiches, a 
soup and a salad, all of which use quality local ingredients. My roast beef 
sandwich with crispy onions and celeriac was tasty, although the decision to 
serve it on a slight sweet buttermilk roll is a curious one.
