go on display next year at theDulwich Picture Gallery.

Jansson is best known for her blobby superstars the Moomins, who became so 
much more famous than their creator that they decorated the tail fins of 
Finnish planes, and even the wristwatch of former president Tarja Halonen.

A major retrospective of her art will feature newly discovered artwork for the 
strip cartoon of the Moomins, found in a mass of material sent for storage by 
the defunct London Evening News paper, which had serialised her work for years.

The exhibition will showcase her as a serious artist as well as an 
illustrator, including self-portraits, landscapes, and her work for the Finnish 
satirical magazine Garm, which first accepted her work when she was just 15. 
She went on to create hundreds of illustrations and cartoons for the magazine, 
including more than 100 covers, which in the war years often featured 
caricatures of Adolf Hitler and other instantly recognisable Nazi figures.

One of the hippo-like Moomins, who hibernate through the winter and wake up as 
the snow melts in their idyllic valley, made a first appearance in a cameo role 
in Garm in 1943. The first Moomins book was published in 1945, and they became 
famous across the world from magazines, books, and television programmes 
including a 104-part Japanese animated version.


Jansson, who died in 2001, was born into a family of artists in Helsinki in 
1914. Her family was closely involved in her work and has kept control of the 
Moomins – once turning down an offer from Disney for the rights.

Her niece Sophia Jansson, now creative director of the Moomins, said she was 
delighted the gallery would now show the full range of her work in the 
exhibition opening in October 2017. “It was hugely important to Tove that she 
be recognised as a talented fine artist in addition to being creator of the 
Moomins,” she said. “Balancing her painting and her other projects alongside 
the demands that the Moomins made of her was something she struggled with all 
her life.”

Sointu Fritze, chief curator at the Ateneum museum in Helsinki and lead 
curator for the exhibition at Dulwich, said Jansson’s art and stories were very 
relevant for Europe today. “Her entire oeuvre and way of thinking are 
characterised by the acceptance of differences,” Fritze said. “Although the 
family circle – both the artist’s own and the fictional Moomin family – is 
central, the door is always open for those seeking shelter.”

The exhibition will be at the Dulwich gallery in south-east London from 25 
October 2017 to 28 January 2018.


• This article was amended on 21 October 2016 to recognise that, although the 
first major retrospective in the UK, the Dulwich show is not the first UK 
exhibition of Tove Jansson’s art.
