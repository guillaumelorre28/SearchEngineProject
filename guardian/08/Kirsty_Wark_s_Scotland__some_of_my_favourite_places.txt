If I were to describe Scotland to someone who didn’t know it, I’d say it’s a 
place of vast lochs, gentle hills and mountains – and that it’s beautifully 
green. I’d add that it’s also very easy to navigate because at its narrowest, 
between Edinburgh and Glasgow, it is less than 50 miles wide.

Though there are places in Canada, 
even vistas in upstate New York, that I’ve felt are very Scottish, I’d have to 
say nowhere can quite compare to Scotland.

The first thing you should do – or taste, actually – when visiting is to find 
a whisky that you like and have a dram. There are plenty of wonderful whisky 
shops, particularly in Edinburgh, which can help you with your decision.

My favourite city view has to be from one end of Edinburgh’s George Street to 
the other. It doesn’t matter which end. I also love the view of the Glenfinnan 
viaduct in the Highlands. It is a wonderful piece of engineering and, of 
course, Scotland has bred some great engineers. Viaducts and bridges are 
wonderful landmarks that string the country together.

For a day out, the Isle of Arran in the Firth of Clyde is a great spot. Arran  
<http://www.visitarran.com/>is where I set my novel and there are so many 
things to do there: hike, swim, play golf, enjoy the beach…

While on Arran you can also eat and drink in lovely pubs. The Brodick Bar and 
Brasserie <http://brodickbar.co.uk/> is a fantastic restaurant where the 
produce is locally sourced, whileThe Lagg Hotel <http://www.lagghotel.com/> is 
great for a drink. A place that’s changed a lot recently is theDrift Inn 
<http://driftinnarran.com/> in Lamlash. The fish there comes straight from the 
harbour. Years ago, people in Scotland exported everything bar haddock and 
herring. Now they’ve at least got the sense to make sure we can all eat 
mussels, scallops and razor clams.

Arran has its own festival scene with arts, folk music, and outdoor events, 
but I think the peace and the vistas, such as overlooking theHoly Isle 
<http://www.holyisland.org/>, are unsurpassed. It lends itself to rumination. 
It’s a very peaceful environment.

I was raised going to the Ubiquitous Chip <http://www.ubiquitouschip.co.uk/>, 
the famous restaurant in Glasgow’s West End, but the restaurant scene there 
changes all the time. Recently, I was at theOx and Finch 
<http://www.oxandfinch.com/> on Sauchiehall Street, which serves a kind of 
Scottish tapas (such as harissa mackerel, herb salad and preserved lemon, £6), 
and there’s another terrific restaurant calledThe Gannet 
<http://www.thegannetgla.com/> on Argyle Street in Finneston, which has superb 
including slow-cooked Borders lamb, barley risotto, mushroom and scorched 
leeks. Then there’sCrabshakk <http://www.crabshakk.com/>, which has the best 
fish, I think, in the west of Scotland. Amid the changes, while customers have 
become more demanding, in terms of quality, they’ve also become more 
adventurous in what they order.

Chef Tom Kitchin is an absolute star so I’m not going to miss the chance to 
suggest his Edinburgh restaurant,The Kitchin <http://thekitchin.com/>. But also 
tryValvona & Crolla’s  
<http://www.valvonacrolla.co.uk/restaurants/vincaff%C3%A9-ristorante> Ristorante
in the New Town, or any of the Contini  <http://www.contini.com/>restaurants.

At the top of Byres Road in Glasgow, close to the university and Botanic 
Gardens, is a great arts venue calledÒran Mór <http://oran-mor.co.uk/>. It’s 
the kind of place to stop for coffee and a spot of people watching. Another 
place that’s good for that isCafezique <http://www.delizique.com/middle> over 
on Hyndland Street.

It’s controversial, I know, 
but I think Edinburgh has always had better pubs than Glasgow. In Edinburgh, I 
might go to theCumberland Bar <http://www.cumberlandbar.co.uk/>. It’s in the 
New Town – but it’s a very old bar. In Glasgow, I’d go and sit inThe Wee Pub 
<http://www.ubiquitouschip.co.uk/drink.php> at the Ubiquitous Chip.

If you’re after a secret tip … I have a few. Contini Caffe  
<http://www.contini.com/contini-caffe>at the top of the Edinburgh’s Royal Mile 
has fabulous ice-cream. For superb cheese, go toGeorge Mewes 
<http://www.georgemewescheese.co.uk/> on Byres Road in Glasgow. And if you go 
to Valvona & Crolla, on Elm Row at the top of Leith Walk, don’t forget that 
it’s not just a deli, there’s a great cafe-bar at the back. You just need to 
explore a little to find it.
