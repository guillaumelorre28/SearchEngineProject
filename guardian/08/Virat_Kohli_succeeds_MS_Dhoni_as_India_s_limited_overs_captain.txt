Kohli replaced Dhoni as India’s Test captain in 2014 and took his side to No1 
in the world last year, when he amassed 655 runs at an average of 109.16 in a 
4-0 series victory over England.

England return to the subcontinent, with Eoin Morgan the captain, for three 
ODIs and three T20s, the first of which is on 15 January in Pune.
