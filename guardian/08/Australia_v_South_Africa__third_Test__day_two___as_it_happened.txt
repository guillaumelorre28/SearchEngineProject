Australia 307-6 at stumps on day two, a lead of 48

Jonathan Howcroft

Another engrossing day of Test cricket ends with Australia holding the upper 
hand thanks to a sublime unbeaten 138 from Usman Khawaja. Sent in late on 
Thursday as a makeshift opener the elegant left hander will return to the 
crease on Saturday afternoon after spending the entire second day batting.

Partners came and went around him. Steve Smith had more than 59 in his locker 
but a regrettable run-out threatened to change the course of the game. It 
didn’t thanks to Peter Handscomb’s busy debut. His dismissal for 54 sparked a 
mini-collapse but the wickets of Nick Maddinson and Matthew Wade to the new 
ball under lights failed to mushroom into anything serious.

For South Africa, Kyle Abbott was the standout, deserving better than his 3/38 
from 25 overs.

Captain Obvious here, but the first session tomorrow will set up the rest of 
the game. Quick wickets for South Africa will drag them back into contention 
but a couple of hours of Australian batting could see them extend their lead of 
48 into match-winning territory.

Thanks for your company, we’ll see you then.

102nd over: Australia 307-6 (Khawaja 138, Starc 16)

Final over of the day, and it’s Abbott to bowl it. Khawaja’s had enough, he 
takes a single from the first ball and he’ll park himself at the non-striker’s 
end, reminding himself of his good day’s work.

Starc looks assured now against the pacemen, standing and delivering with a 
straight bat, playing in the V. And that’s stumps.

101st over: Australia 306-6 (Khawaja 137, Starc 16)

Shamsi returns to torment Starc, half-appealing for an LBW, then 
half-appealing for an LBW and a bat-pad chance that drops in front of 
short-leg. Starc continues to hold his end up though.

99th over: Australia 305-6 (Khawaja 136, Starc 16)

Shamsi returns to the attack late in the day to bowl his left-arm wrist spin 
to Starc with just four overs remaining in play. And Starc does not know which 
way the ball is turning! One rips off the pitch and into the hands of Amla at 
first slip, the wrong ‘un nips between bat and pad and misses the bails by a 
particle so small they’re searching for it in that big shiny tunnel in Geneva.

98th over: Australia 304-6 (Khawaja 135, Starc 16)

Kyle Abbott back on for his final dart with the tail at his mercy. 22 overs 
3-35 so far in a terrific display. Immediately on the line and length, but 
Starc looks to be warming to his task and does well to rotate the strike with 
the implacable Khawaja.

97th over: Australia 303-6 (Khawaja 135, Starc 15)

More of the same from Philander, finding the middle of Khawaja’s blade, and 
the inch or so just outside the edge of Starc’s. Apart from the one that 
rockets from a Starc push through extra cover for a rare boundary and the team 
300.

Five overs remaining. Australia lead by 43.

96th over: Australia 293-6 (Khawaja 134, Starc 7)

Rabada changing the angle, moving around the wicket, offering Khawaja the 
single, which he takes second delivery. Regardless of how the rest of the day 
pans out, this has been a Herculean effort from the makeshift opener.

Starc is not in Khawaja’s class and looks at risk of losing his wicket every 
delivery, but he survives with a series of play and misses, bunts, and leading 
edges into space.

I don't care for the interpretation of "pitching outside the line of leg stump"
@JPHowcroft <https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft>. If some of the ball is in line, 
it's in line.

95th over: Australia 291-6 (Khawaja 133, Starc 6)

Philander’s tested Starc all over and eventually he gets one through the big 
man’s defences, and it’s given LBW -reviewed immediately. And for good reason, 
the ball pitched a hair’s breadth outside the line of leg stump. Starc 
survives, only to waft another swoosh at one that beats the outside edge.

Apparently the ball had 45% landing in line with the stumps, not the required 
50%. A game of millimetres.

94th over: Australia 289-6 (Khawaja 133, Starc 4)

Rabada’s in his happy place, hitting a good length and forcing both 
left-handers to consider the health of their thumbs. Starc isn’t one to take a 
backward step though and he fronts up well with a straight bat and a jutted jaw.

93rd over: Australia 286-6 (Khawaja 132, Starc 2)

Ten overs remaining tonight. Discussion on TV wanders into ‘why is the ball 
swinging more tonight than last night?’ territory. It would be a shame if one 
of them just went “I don’t know. Nobody knows really. Makes for great cricket 
though.”

Philander sending down his wobbly off-cutters in the vicinity of Khawaja’s 
outside edge, but the vigil continues.

92nd over: Australia 285-6 (Khawaja 132, Starc 1)

Khawaja offered a single first up, and he accepts, happy to rest his aching 
bones at the non-striker’s end and allow Mitchell Starc to fend off some Rabada 
thunderbolts. The big lefty does enough, including pinching a single of his own 
off the last ball to farm the strike.

Since the new ball was taken and the lights came on this innings has 
transformed. The neon pink pill keeps darting past the outside edge with a 
comet’s tail behind it like an homage to Tron.
Barney Ronay (@barneyronay) 
Was a bit surprised by the standing ovation for the man who got in and then 
got out. Aus 3-10 since then

WICKET! Wade c De Kock b Philander 4 (Australia 283-6)

90th over: Australia 283-6 (Khawaja 131)

Philander replaces Abbott, who once again bowled beautifully. But the pressure 
isn’t released with Veep hitting the same spots and beating Wade’s outside edge 
on a couple of occasions. Wade responds by taking guard way outside his crease 
to neutralise the seam movement, but instead he nicks a healthy edge through to 
a diving De Kock.

90th over: Australia 277-5 (Khawaja 130, Wade 0)

If Maddison was limited on debut, Wade certainly isn’t on recall, crunching a 
square drive for four from his first delivery.

Hard to gauge much from that Maddison knock. He came in at a tough time and 
faced some good bowling, including one very special ball indeed.

WICKET! Maddinson b Rabada 0 (Australia 277-5)

BANG! Fast, full, tailing back in to the left-hander and the zing bails go 
flying into the Adelaide night. Nick Maddinson got a good one from Kagiso 
Rabada to end his difficult stay at the crease without a run.

Abbott is making Maddinson’s first dig in Test cricket a tough one, putting 
the pink ball on the spot relentlessly. A maiden ensues, and the New South 
Welshman remains on a duck.

88th over: Australia 276-4 (Khawaja 129, Maddinson 0)

Rabada trying to offer shock value from the other end but Khawaja has been in 
way too long to be unsettled by any short stuff.

Tapan saw something in Handscomb before the selectors did. “Watching Handscomb 
making runs on tired indian pitches in A tour it was clear he would play for 
Australia seniors. When Voges, Mitch Marsh and Burns were preferred it made me 
cringe (though Voges was more of an option due to Ashes and his exp of English 
conditions). But still Handscomb should have made his debut before Ferguson in 
the last match only, even though my sympathies were with Ferguson for not 
making his debut earlier.”

87th over: Australia 273-4 (Khawaja 127, Maddinson 0)

Abbott’s found his mojo with this new ball under lights. His first delivery to 
Maddinson just passes the outside edge, as does the third, and the fifth, all 
kissing a good length and spitting towards first slip.

Handscomb can be satisfied with his debut, or can he? As Rowan Sweeney emails 
in: “If I recall correctly, the last Victorian to make a fifty on debut was 
dropped after making 200 n.o. Best of luck, Peter.”

True words from one who knows. Handscomb is getting his weirdness on, and we 
love it.https://t.co/p3aQl0lZts <https://t.co/p3aQl0lZts>

WICKET! Handscomb b Abbott 54 (Australia 273-4)

Abbott rips through Handscomb with a beauty. Hits the deck, cuts in, and 
sneaks between bat and pad to castle middle and off.

85th over: Australia 273-3 (Khawaja 127, Handscomb 54)

Rabada with his first dart with the new ball, immediately after the drinks 
break. A couple start full outside off but the third is on Khawaja’s hip and he 
swivels a pulled four. He doesn’t look full of pizzazz at the crease though and 
a quicker one swooshes past him before one wobbles off the seam beyond his 
outside edge. He’s still there though, like he has been since this time last 
night.

Gervase Greene has taken to the email, and I’m delighted he has.

“Jonathan, isn’t it remarkable how little ‘debate’ there is over Handscomb’s 
stance (or ‘set-up’, as the Nine commentary team insist on describing it. I 
guess he is ‘At Bat’). If he didn’t hit the ball a bit harder than average, 
grammar pedants could almost call him a dangling modifier (google it). In My 
Day* I can recall snorts of derision when assorted British visitors in the 
late-70s started facing the incoming bowler with the bat mid-air already. To 
this day I cannot recall an Australia more united than that day Thommo hurled a 
sandshoe-crusher yorker to bowl Tony Greig at the Gabba in the 2nd innings of 
the 1st Test of the 1974/75 Ashes. A tsunami of ‘toldjer!’ acclaimed the 
delivery that proved Grieg’s 1st innings defiant century was a one-off. The 
whole of Australia, maybe the world, had spent the following day decrying ‘why 
doesn’t someone bowl that Pommie/Yarpie git a Yorker?’ as The 10-ft tall Greig 
held his bat off the ground. Nowadays, Handscomb’s bat stays poised and 
vigilant in the direction of the midday sun. And no Twitter-kerfuffle? Not even 
a brouhaha. Progress!”
* In My Day marks me as a curmudgeon, but it is not exactly so. But almost.

84th over: Australia 266-3 (Khawaja 121, Handscomb 54)

If there was any fear Handscomb might be rattled by that near miss they’re 
dispelled by back to back cover driven fours to open the 84th over.

A pulled four wide of mid-on makes it a hat-trick of boundaries, to bring up 
the Victorian’s 50 on debut and push Australia into the lead.


Handscomb looks to the manor born. Top knock.

83rd over: Australia 249-3 (Khawaja 121, Handscomb 41)

The new ball isn’t talking loudly for South Africa and Handscomb and Khawaja 
are milking ones and twos from Abbott. But, hold on, Handscomb might have 
bitten off more than he could chew with one quick single too many. A direct hit 
has him diving full length with the third umpire forced to check replays of 
whether the bouncing bat was in the air when the zing bails lit up. Not out! 
Sighs of relief for the debutant.

81st over: Australia 245-3 (Khawaja 120, Handscomb 38)

Philander to share the new ball and he’s so unlucky not to claim Handscomb, 
nipping one back off the seam, catching the inside edge but it drops before De 
Kock.

The long sleeve jumpers on the fielding team indicate as the sun sets the 
temperature drops pretty quickly in the Athens of the South.

Khawaja now has his longest Test innings in terms of balls faced - now up to 
240...

81st over: Australia 243-3 (Khawaja 120, Handscomb 36)

Kyle Abbott is handed the new pink ball at the earliest opportunity, running 
in from the Cathedral End as the sun sets over the Adelaide Oval, sending the 
sky an Instagrammer’s #nofilter fantasy. Game on again.

Not much doing from that first look at the new pill, a tiny amount of swing 
back into the left hander, but the bowler’s only just hitting 130kph. That 
perception of swing almost does for Khawaja who plays inside the line of the 
last couple, giving Abbott something to smile ruefully about.

80th over: Australia 243-3 (Khawaja 120, Handscomb 36)

Review! Hail Mary appeal with the first delivery of Shamsi’s over to 
Handscomb. The right-hander goes deep in his crease looking to play a cut shot 
but is beaten for pace to one that bounced a bit more than most. He hits it, 
but the question is whether it hit his pad first. The review reveals it did hit 
his pad first, but was bouncing well over. Worth a look, and a decent warning 
to Handscomb about how his deep guard makes him an LBW candidate.

Khawaja sees out the rest of the over, but he’s gone into his shell a bit 
since dinner. Hardly surprising considering he’s been on the field every 
delivery for two days in a row.

South Africa will be restored the review at the end of the over.

76th over: Australia 234-3 (Khawaja 117, Handscomb 30)

Shamsi continuing a tight line and length to Khawaja. Second maiden from him 
in a row.

TV commentary has gone to the subject of Faf’s appeal - which is easy to 
perceive as pushing the patience of the ICC and everyone involved. Although, 
hearing Mr Warne lament the Proteas skipper not taking responsibility for his 
actions must have brought a few wry smiles around the country. Maybe Faf should 
say his mum packed the mints in his kit bag and he didn’t think there was 
anything wrong with sucking them on tour?

75th over: Australia 234-3 (Khawaja 117, Handscomb 30)

Duminy into the attack now with his right-arm offies from over the wicket. He 
starts with a rank wide long hop and some junk that should have generated a 
sundry, forcing him to change his approach around the wicket, from where he 
immediately looks dangerous. One turns and strikes Handscomb on the pads and 
another finds a thick edge that races along the ground past Amla at slip.

74th over: Australia 230-3 (Khawaja 117, Handscomb 26)

Du Plessis is clearly trying to buy 10 cheap overs and throw his seamers full 
bore at the new ball as darkness descends but this brief passage after dinner 
has been all Australia so far.

Shamsi puts the breaks on finally with a maiden.

73rd over: Australia 230-3 (Khawaja 117, Handscomb 26)

50 partnership from just 68 deliveries as this pair continue their 
postprandial game of tip and run.

If Handscomb’s technique and runs don’t help him succeed, he has the patronage 
of a certain SK Warne to prop him up. The debutant has perfect Warnian genes, 
being of Australian, Victorian, and St Kilda CC descent. One can only imagine 
he likes American Pie too.

72nd over: Australia 223-3 (Khawaja 115, Handscomb 21)

Shamsi bowling his left-arm over the wicket wrist spin to partner Elgar. A 
similar over ensues with Handscomb in particular showing a confident use of his 
feet that will stand him in good stead for the Yasir Shah challenge to come 
later in the summer. A couple of those nudges reach the boundary this over 
though, courtesy of some dreadful fielding. Some South Africans still with 
their heads in the buffet. And the Adelaide feed is as good as it gets on the 
circuit, so I can hardly blame them.
Cat Jones (@Cricketbatcat) 
Finally Elgar on for a bowl. I've been waiting for this ALL SERIES. #AusvSA

71st over: Australia 213-3 (Khawaja 110, Handscomb 16)

Dean Elgar to open the bowling for this final session of the day as South 
Africa look to rattle through to the new ball in 10 overs time.

The over proceeds as you’d expect, a series of loopy left arm droppers nudged 
around the beautiful oval for a few singles.

There’ll be 32 overs bowled in the session, meaning we’re likely to overrun 
the scheduled close of play slightly, but not by much.

Actually, can we ditch the cricket? Channel 9 have just shown the trailer for 
the new David Attenborough show, you know, the one of that lizard sprinting 
away from an army of snakes straight from a Room 101 nightmare.

Evening all, a change of narrator for you to see you through the sunset 
session. I have the good fortune of turning up with Australia in the ascendancy 
in a Test match for the first time since the Ashes tour of 1989.

Usman Khawaja has mixed elegance with patience to bat serenely through two 
sessions after his unexpected move to opener. He’s at the crease alongsdie 
debutant Peter Handscomb who has looked accomplished after a nervy first over. 
The Victorian’s upright technique and guard deep in his crease is sure to 
provoke plenty of debate.

While you’re enjoying your dinner (or tea, or supper, I know this naming 
convention is a hotly debated issue on social media) please cast your eye over 
this. From Andy Bull in this week’sThe Spin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/thespin>. 

Ashoquolla Sultankhil travelled a long way to play Bexleyheath CC, all across 
Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungry, Serbia, and France. Sultankhil – his 
team-mates all call him Shuk – is from Baghlan in northern Afghanistan. When 
Shuk was a baby, his father left home. When Shuk was a child, his mother and 
brother were killed by the Taliban. And when Shuk was a teenager, he decided to 
come to Europe and claim asylum in England. He was placed in foster care and 
given a place at Woolwich Polytechnic. Soon after he turned up at Bexleyheath 
CC, where, though he couldn’t speak much English, he made it clear that he was 
nuts about cricket and started playing for their U15s.

Two years later, Shuk now has five GCSEs, including a C in English, and is 
still turning out for the club. He is also being threatened with deportation. 
Shuk recently lost his application to remain in the UK, and is now on his final 
appeal to stay in the country he calls home. Shuk’s team-mates at Bexleyheath 
CC are petitioning the government on his behalf. They say he “has embraced all 
of cricket life, engaging in the social and fund raising sides as well as 
playing the game itself” and that “he is a smashing, polite, friendly hard 
working lad who has quite simply become part of our family”. You can read more 
about Shuk’s case here. If you’re persuaded by his case, please do sign his 
petition.

DINNER - Australia 209-3 (Khawaja 108, Handscomb 14)

A fine session for the hosts, rattling off an even 100 runs across the two 
hours, Usman Khawaja registering his fifth Test century along the way. It could 
have been flawless, if not for a mix-up that left the captain Steve Smith short 
of his ground when on 59 after he’d 137 on with Khawaja either side of lunch.

It has been a defining hand from the left-hander, thrown up to the top of the 
list after Dave Warner was precluded from opening the innings last night. He 
was mature enough to survive last night, and skilful enough to prosper today. 
The strokes were there, but so too was the hard work to see off the South 
African trio of quality seamers when deserving of it.

Smith will be gutted, his call for a single to point honoured by Khawaja 
initially before being sent back. It’s ugly cricket, but the captain was 
equally brilliant in the stand. It laid the foundation for the runs that 
Australia desperately wanted to avoid leaving too much work to their 
inexperienced lower-middle order. With that said, Handscomb has looked better 
with each minute he has spent out there since Smith’s demise, 14 not out at the 
long break. The hosts are 50 short of a valuable first innings lead.

Right. That’s enough from me. JP Howcroft will take the baton as day becomes 
night in Adelaide. Thanks for your company, I’ve enjoyed it as always. See you 
tomorrow.

70th over: Australia 209-3 (Khawaja 108, Handscomb 14) Handscomb is defending 
and leaving in keeping with the best traditions of the pre-interval over. Until 
Abbott overpitches on his pads, a ball he’s happy enough to push through 
midwicket. Strong writs, three scored. Khawaja sees off the final couple of 
deliveries, collecting one to midwicket in the process. And that, my friends, 
will be dinner. I’ll take a moment and wrap up the session.

69th over: Australia 205-3 (Khawaja 107, Handscomb 11) Shamsi has been given a 
big go in this middle session but is still searching for a maiden Test scalp. 
With only minutes to the long break Khawaja is satisfied in defence before 
getting a loopy one on the pads, tucking it away for one. Handscomb driving 
turns the strike over as well, meaning he’ll be up the business end for the 
final over of the session, which will be delivered by Abbott.

68th over: Australia 203-3 (Khawaja 106, Handscomb 10) Abbott back on for a 
couple before dinner. He’s too straight to begin, Khawaja stroking a single 
into the on-side. Then a bit a short, Hanscomb cutting a couple behind gully. 
His best shot yet. He does likewise to end the over, and this time it goes the 
full journey - his first boundary in Test cricket. That’ll feel good; into 
double figures as well. That’s Australia’s 200 up as well.

67th over: Australia 196-3 (Khawaja 105, Handscomb 4) Shamsi gets another go. 
Khawaja, untroubled after bringing up a century moments before, takes one to 
point. Hanscomb gets three behind point that he tries to cut close to his body. 
He looks a bit nervous out there, but that’s perfectly understandable. Still, a 
big job ahead and this is what he has been picked for.

66th over: Australia 191-3 (Khawaja 103, Handscomb 1) Four slips in place for 
Handscomb, Philander I am sure very happy to be given another chance at the 
Victorian right hander on debut. He’s forced to play and defend, facing up deep 
in his crease. It’s a tough initial interrogation for the 25-year-old, but he 
comes across as a savvy enough operator to understand that. A good late leave 
to end the over suggests some confidence. A maiden will be recorded in the 
book. Australia now trail by 68, with a quarter hour to come before dinner.

65th over: Australia 191-3 (Khawaja 103, Handscomb 1) Khawaja is using his 
feet to get to the pitch of Shamsi, it’s beautifully timed and to the rope. To 
98. Then 99 with another drive, this time to long-off. The cheer is bigger 
again for Hanscomb who takes one himself, his first run in Test cricket. Now 
back on strike and the field upKhawaja makes no mistake in cutting to a ton! A 
glorious way to get there, and he loves it. 197 balls with ten boundaries the 
others numbers in the equation. He needed to step up with the vast inexperience 
across Australia’s top six, and then again when Dave Warner was prevented from 
opening last night. He’s done both beautifully. There’ll be some scrutiny over 
the run out with Smith, but time for that later. For now, it’s all about Usman. 
What a superb century.

Another engrossing day of Test cricket ends with Australia holding the upper 
hand thanks to a sublime unbeaten 138 from Usman Khawaja. Sent in late on 
Thursday as a makeshift opener the elegant left hander will return to the 
crease on Saturday afternoon after spending the entire second day batting.

Partners came and went around him. Steve Smith had more than 59 in his locker 
but a regrettable run-out threatened to change the course of the game. It 
didn’t thanks to Peter Handscomb’s busy debut. His dismissal for 54 sparked a 
mini-collapse but the wickets of Nick Maddinson and Matthew Wade to the new 
ball under lights failed to mushroom into anything serious.

For South Africa, Kyle Abbott was the standout, deserving better than his 3/38 
from 25 overs.

Captain Obvious here, but the first session tomorrow will set up the rest of 
the game. Quick wickets for South Africa will drag them back into contention 
but a couple of hours of Australian batting could see them extend their lead of 
48 into match-winning territory.

Thanks for your company, we’ll see you then.

Africa at the Adelaide Oval. Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images  
102nd over: Australia 307-6 (Khawaja 138, Starc 16)

Final over of the day, and it’s Abbott to bowl it. Khawaja’s had enough, he 
takes a single from the first ball and he’ll park himself at the non-striker’s 
end, reminding himself of his good day’s work.

Starc looks assured now against the pacemen, standing and delivering with a 
straight bat, playing in the V. And that’s stumps.

101st over: Australia 306-6 (Khawaja 137, Starc 16)

Shamsi returns to torment Starc, half-appealing for an LBW, then 
half-appealing for an LBW and a bat-pad chance that drops in front of 
short-leg. Starc continues to hold his end up though.

100th over: Australia 305-6 (Khawaja 136, Starc 16)

Abbott around the wicket to Starc and the Australian number 8 does his job, 
seeing off another over.

*See over 99 (The Large Hadron Collider).
 
99th over: Australia 305-6 (Khawaja 136, Starc 16)

Shamsi returns to the attack late in the day to bowl his left-arm wrist spin 
to Starc with just four overs remaining in play. And Starc does not know which 
way the ball is turning! One rips off the pitch and into the hands of Amla at 
first slip, the wrong ‘un nips between bat and pad and misses the bails by a 
particle so small they’re searching for it in that big shiny tunnel in Geneva.
 
98th over: Australia 304-6 (Khawaja 135, Starc 16)

Kyle Abbott back on for his final dart with the tail at his mercy. 22 overs 
3-35 so far in a terrific display. Immediately on the line and length, but 
Starc looks to be warming to his task and does well to rotate the strike with 
the implacable Khawaja.
 
97th over: Australia 303-6 (Khawaja 135, Starc 15)

More of the same from Philander, finding the middle of Khawaja’s blade, and 
the inch or so just outside the edge of Starc’s. Apart from the one that 
rockets from a Starc push through extra cover for a rare boundary and the team 
300.

Five overs remaining. Australia lead by 43.

96th over: Australia 293-6 (Khawaja 134, Starc 7)

Rabada changing the angle, moving around the wicket, offering Khawaja the 
single, which he takes second delivery. Regardless of how the rest of the day 
pans out, this has been a Herculean effort from the makeshift opener.

Starc is not in Khawaja’s class and looks at risk of losing his wicket every 
delivery, but he survives with a series of play and misses, bunts, and leading 
edges into space.
Gary Naylor (@garynaylor999) 
I don't care for the interpretation of "pitching outside the line of leg stump"

I agree.
 
95th over: Australia 291-6 (Khawaja 133, Starc 6)

Philander’s tested Starc all over and eventually he gets one through the big 
man’s defences, and it’s given LBW -reviewed immediately. And for good reason, 
the ball pitched a hair’s breadth outside the line of leg stump. Starc 
survives, only to waft another swoosh at one that beats the outside edge.

Apparently the ball had 45% landing in line with the stumps, not the required 
50%. A game of millimetres.
 
94th over: Australia 289-6 (Khawaja 133, Starc 4)

Rabada’s in his happy place, hitting a good length and forcing both 
left-handers to consider the health of their thumbs. Starc isn’t one to take a 
backward step though and he fronts up well with a straight bat and a jutted jaw.
 
93rd over: Australia 286-6 (Khawaja 132, Starc 2)

Ten overs remaining tonight. Discussion on TV wanders into ‘why is the ball 
swinging more tonight than last night?’ territory. It would be a shame if one 
of them just went “I don’t know. Nobody knows really. Makes for great cricket 
though.”

Philander sending down his wobbly off-cutters in the vicinity of Khawaja’s 
outside edge, but the vigil continues.
 
92nd over: Australia 285-6 (Khawaja 132, Starc 1)

Khawaja offered a single first up, and he accepts, happy to rest his aching 
bones at the non-striker’s end and allow Mitchell Starc to fend off some Rabada 
thunderbolts. The big lefty does enough, including pinching a single of his own 
off the last ball to farm the strike.

Since the new ball was taken and the lights came on this innings has 
transformed. The neon pink pill keeps darting past the outside edge with a 
comet’s tail behind it like an homage to Tron.

90th over: Australia 283-6 (Khawaja 131, Starc 0)

The collapse is on, hold onto your hats! The third wicket with the new ball 
has set this game back on edge with Australia down to the tail with a lead of 
24.
 
90th over: Australia 283-6 (Khawaja 131)

Philander replaces Abbott, who once again bowled beautifully. But the pressure 
isn’t released with Veep hitting the same spots and beating Wade’s outside edge 
on a couple of occasions. Wade responds by taking guard way outside his crease 
to neutralise the seam movement, but instead he nicks a healthy edge through to 
a diving De Kock.

90th over: Australia 277-5 (Khawaja 130, Wade 0)

If Maddison was limited on debut, Wade certainly isn’t on recall, crunching a 
square drive for four from his first delivery.

Hard to gauge much from that Maddison knock. He came in at a tough time and 
faced some good bowling, including one very special ball indeed.
 
BANG! Fast, full, tailing back in to the left-hander and the zing bails go 
flying into the Adelaide night. Nick Maddinson got a good one from Kagiso 
Rabada to end his difficult stay at the crease without a run.

89th over: Australia 276-4 (Khawaja 129, Maddinson 0)

Abbott is making Maddinson’s first dig in Test cricket a tough one, putting 
the pink ball on the spot relentlessly. A maiden ensues, and the New South 
Welshman remains on a duck.

88th over: Australia 276-4 (Khawaja 129, Maddinson 0)

Rabada trying to offer shock value from the other end but Khawaja has been in 
way too long to be unsettled by any short stuff.

Tapan saw something in Handscomb before the selectors did. “Watching Handscomb 
making runs on tired indian pitches in A tour it was clear he would play for 
Australia seniors. When Voges, Mitch Marsh and Burns were preferred it made me 
cringe (though Voges was more of an option due to Ashes and his exp of English 
conditions). But still Handscomb should have made his debut before Ferguson in 
the last match only, even though my sympathies were with Ferguson for not 
making his debut earlier.”
 
87th over: Australia 273-4 (Khawaja 127, Maddinson 0)

Abbott’s found his mojo with this new ball under lights. His first delivery to 
Maddinson just passes the outside edge, as does the third, and the fifth, all 
kissing a good length and spitting towards first slip.

Handscomb can be satisfied with his debut, or can he? As Rowan Sweeney emails 
in: “If I recall correctly, the last Victorian to make a fifty on debut was 
dropped after making 200 n.o. Best of luck, Peter.”
Geoff Lemon Sport (@GeoffLemonSport)

Abbott rips through Handscomb with a beauty. Hits the deck, cuts in, and 
sneaks between bat and pad to castle middle and off.

85th over: Australia 273-3 (Khawaja 127, Handscomb 54)

Rabada with his first dart with the new ball, immediately after the drinks 
break. A couple start full outside off but the third is on Khawaja’s hip and he 
swivels a pulled four. He doesn’t look full of pizzazz at the crease though and 
a quicker one swooshes past him before one wobbles off the seam beyond his 
outside edge. He’s still there though, like he has been since this time last 
night.

Gervase Greene has taken to the email, and I’m delighted he has.

“Jonathan, isn’t it remarkable how little ‘debate’ there is over Handscomb’s 
stance (or ‘set-up’, as the Nine commentary team insist on describing it. I 
guess he is ‘At Bat’). If he didn’t hit the ball a bit harder than average, 
grammar pedants could almost call him a dangling modifier (google it). In My 
Day* I can recall snorts of derision when assorted British visitors in the 
late-70s started facing the incoming bowler with the bat mid-air already. To 
this day I cannot recall an Australia more united than that day Thommo hurled a 
sandshoe-crusher yorker to bowl Tony Greig at the Gabba in the 2nd innings of 
the 1st Test of the 1974/75 Ashes. A tsunami of ‘toldjer!’ acclaimed the 
delivery that proved Grieg’s 1st innings defiant century was a one-off. The 
whole of Australia, maybe the world, had spent the following day decrying ‘why 
doesn’t someone bowl that Pommie/Yarpie git a Yorker?’ as The 10-ft tall Greig 
held his bat off the ground. Nowadays, Handscomb’s bat stays poised and 
vigilant in the direction of the midday sun. And no Twitter-kerfuffle? Not even 
a brouhaha. Progress!”
* In My Day marks me as a curmudgeon, but it is not exactly so. But almost.

84th over: Australia 266-3 (Khawaja 121, Handscomb 54)

If there was any fear Handscomb might be rattled by that near miss they’re 
dispelled by back to back cover driven fours to open the 84th over.

A pulled four wide of mid-on makes it a hat-trick of boundaries, to bring up 
the Victorian’s 50 on debut and push Australia into the lead.


Handscomb looks to the manor born. Top knock.

83rd over: Australia 249-3 (Khawaja 121, Handscomb 41)

The new ball isn’t talking loudly for South Africa and Handscomb and Khawaja 
are milking ones and twos from Abbott. But, hold on, Handscomb might have 
bitten off more than he could chew with one quick single too many. A direct hit 
has him diving full length with the third umpire forced to check replays of 
whether the bouncing bat was in the air when the zing bails lit up. Not out! 
Sighs of relief for the debutant.

Philander to share the new ball and he’s so unlucky not to claim Handscomb, 
nipping one back off the seam, catching the inside edge but it drops before De 
Kock.

The long sleeve jumpers on the fielding team indicate as the sun sets the 
temperature drops pretty quickly in the Athens of the South.

81st over: Australia 243-3 (Khawaja 120, Handscomb 36)

Kyle Abbott is handed the new pink ball at the earliest opportunity, running 
in from the Cathedral End as the sun sets over the Adelaide Oval, sending the 
sky an Instagrammer’s #nofilter fantasy. Game on again.

Not much doing from that first look at the new pill, a tiny amount of swing 
back into the left hander, but the bowler’s only just hitting 130kph. That 
perception of swing almost does for Khawaja who plays inside the line of the 
last couple, giving Abbott something to smile ruefully about.
 
80th over: Australia 243-3 (Khawaja 120, Handscomb 36)

Review! Hail Mary appeal with the first delivery of Shamsi’s over to 
Handscomb. The right-hander goes deep in his crease looking to play a cut shot 
but is beaten for pace to one that bounced a bit more than most. He hits it, 
but the question is whether it hit his pad first. The review reveals it did hit 
his pad first, but was bouncing well over. Worth a look, and a decent warning 
to Handscomb about how his deep guard makes him an LBW candidate.

Khawaja sees out the rest of the over, but he’s gone into his shell a bit 
since dinner. Hardly surprising considering he’s been on the field every 
delivery for two days in a row.

South Africa will be restored the review at the end of the over.
 
79th over: Australia 241-3 (Khawaja 119, Handscomb 35)

Temba Bavuma joining the Faf’s havin a laugh bowling chaff party. Bavuma’s 
right-arm skidders have potential, but on a track as true as this against two 
set batsmen he’s performing the role of a bowling machine.
 
78th over: Australia 239-3 (Khawaja 119, Handscomb 33)

Handscomb dancing all around his crease against Shamsi, looking to manoeuvre 
the ball into run scoring areas. After finding the field for four deliveries, 
he finally manages to rotate the strike.

Shamsi continuing a tight line and length to Khawaja. Second maiden from him 
in a row.

TV commentary has gone to the subject of Faf’s appeal - which is easy to 
perceive as pushing the patience of the ICC and everyone involved. Although, 
hearing Mr Warne lament the Proteas skipper not taking responsibility for his 
actions must have brought a few wry smiles around the country. Maybe Faf should 
say his mum packed the mints in his kit bag and he didn’t think there was 
anything wrong with sucking them on tour?
 
75th over: Australia 234-3 (Khawaja 117, Handscomb 30)

Duminy into the attack now with his right-arm offies from over the wicket. He 
starts with a rank wide long hop and some junk that should have generated a 
sundry, forcing him to change his approach around the wicket, from where he 
immediately looks dangerous. One turns and strikes Handscomb on the pads and 
another finds a thick edge that races along the ground past Amla at slip.
 
74th over: Australia 230-3 (Khawaja 117, Handscomb 26)

Du Plessis is clearly trying to buy 10 cheap overs and throw his seamers full 
bore at the new ball as darkness descends but this brief passage after dinner 
has been all Australia so far.

Shamsi puts the breaks on finally with a maiden. 
 
73rd over: Australia 230-3 (Khawaja 117, Handscomb 26)

50 partnership from just 68 deliveries as this pair continue their 
postprandial game of tip and run.

If Handscomb’s technique and runs don’t help him succeed, he has the patronage 
of a certain SK Warne to prop him up. The debutant has perfect Warnian genes, 
being of Australian, Victorian, and St Kilda CC descent. One can only imagine 
he likes American Pie too.
 
72nd over: Australia 223-3 (Khawaja 115, Handscomb 21)

Shamsi bowling his left-arm over the wicket wrist spin to partner Elgar. A 
similar over ensues with Handscomb in particular showing a confident use of his 
feet that will stand him in good stead for the Yasir Shah challenge to come 
later in the summer. A couple of those nudges reach the boundary this over 
though, courtesy of some dreadful fielding. Some South Africans still with 
their heads in the buffet. And the Adelaide feed is as good as it gets on the 
circuit, so I can hardly blame them.

Dean Elgar to open the bowling for this final session of the day as South 
Africa look to rattle through to the new ball in 10 overs time.

The over proceeds as you’d expect, a series of loopy left arm droppers nudged 
around the beautiful oval for a few singles.

There’ll be 32 overs bowled in the session, meaning we’re likely to overrun 
the scheduled close of play slightly, but not by much.
 
Actually, can we ditch the cricket? Channel 9 have just shown the trailer for 
the new David Attenborough show, you know, the one of that lizard sprinting 
away from an army of snakes straight from a Room 101 nightmare.
 RUN!  
Evening all, a change of narrator for you to see you through the sunset 
session. I have the good fortune of turning up with Australia in the ascendancy 
in a Test match for the first time since the Ashes tour of 1989.

Usman Khawaja has mixed elegance with patience to bat serenely through two 
sessions after his unexpected move to opener. He’s at the crease alongsdie 
debutant Peter Handscomb who has looked accomplished after a nervy first over. 
The Victorian’s upright technique and guard deep in his crease is sure to 
provoke plenty of debate.

Tasmanian town may rename cricket oval after Donald Trump

While you’re enjoying your dinner (or tea, or supper, I know this naming 
convention is a hotly debated issue on social media) please cast your eye over 
this. From Andy Bull in this week’sThe Spin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/thespin>. 

Ashoquolla Sultankhil travelled a long way to play Bexleyheath CC, all across 
Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungry, Serbia, and France. Sultankhil – his 
team-mates all call him Shuk – is from Baghlan in northern Afghanistan. When 
Shuk was a baby, his father left home. When Shuk was a child, his mother and 
brother were killed by the Taliban. And when Shuk was a teenager, he decided to 
come to Europe and claim asylum in England. He was placed in foster care and 
given a place at Woolwich Polytechnic. Soon after he turned up at Bexleyheath 
CC, where, though he couldn’t speak much English, he made it clear that he was 
nuts about cricket and started playing for their U15s.

Two years later, Shuk now has five GCSEs, including a C in English, and is 
still turning out for the club. He is also being threatened with deportation. 
Shuk recently lost his application to remain in the UK, and is now on his final 
appeal to stay in the country he calls home. Shuk’s team-mates at Bexleyheath 
CC are petitioning the government on his behalf. They say he “has embraced all 
of cricket life, engaging in the social and fund raising sides as well as 
playing the game itself” and that “he is a smashing, polite, friendly hard 
working lad who has quite simply become part of our family”. You can read more 
about Shuk’s case here. If you’re persuaded by his case, please do sign his 
petition.

A fine session for the hosts, rattling off an even 100 runs across the two 
hours, Usman Khawaja registering his fifth Test century along the way. It could 
have been flawless, if not for a mix-up that left the captain Steve Smith short 
of his ground when on 59 after he’d 137 on with Khawaja either side of lunch.

It has been a defining hand from the left-hander, thrown up to the top of the 
list after Dave Warner was precluded from opening the innings last night. He 
was mature enough to survive last night, and skilful enough to prosper today. 
The strokes were there, but so too was the hard work to see off the South 
African trio of quality seamers when deserving of it.

Smith will be gutted, his call for a single to point honoured by Khawaja 
initially before being sent back. It’s ugly cricket, but the captain was 
equally brilliant in the stand. It laid the foundation for the runs that 
Australia desperately wanted to avoid leaving too much work to their 
inexperienced lower-middle order. With that said, Handscomb has looked better 
with each minute he has spent out there since Smith’s demise, 14 not out at the 
long break. The hosts are 50 short of a valuable first innings lead.

Right. That’s enough from me. JP Howcroft will take the baton as day becomes 
night in Adelaide. Thanks for your company, I’ve enjoyed it as always. See you 
tomorrow.

70th over: Australia 209-3 (Khawaja 108, Handscomb 14) Handscomb is defending 
and leaving in keeping with the best traditions of the pre-interval over. Until 
Abbott overpitches on his pads, a ball he’s happy enough to push through 
midwicket. Strong writs, three scored. Khawaja sees off the final couple of 
deliveries, collecting one to midwicket in the process. And that, my friends, 
will be dinner. I’ll take a moment and wrap up the session.
 
69th over: Australia 205-3 (Khawaja 107, Handscomb 11) Shamsi has been given a 
big go in this middle session but is still searching for a maiden Test scalp. 
With only minutes to the long break Khawaja is satisfied in defence before 
getting a loopy one on the pads, tucking it away for one. Handscomb driving 
turns the strike over as well, meaning he’ll be up the business end for the 
final over of the session, which will be delivered by Abbott.

68th over: Australia 203-3 (Khawaja 106, Handscomb 10) Abbott back on for a 
couple before dinner. He’s too straight to begin, Khawaja stroking a single 
into the on-side. Then a bit a short, Hanscomb cutting a couple behind gully. 
His best shot yet. He does likewise to end the over, and this time it goes the 
full journey - his first boundary in Test cricket. That’ll feel good; into 
double figures as well. That’s Australia’s 200 up as well. 
 
67th over: Australia 196-3 (Khawaja 105, Handscomb 4) Shamsi gets another go. 
Khawaja, untroubled after bringing up a century moments before, takes one to 
point. Hanscomb gets three behind point that he tries to cut close to his body. 
He looks a bit nervous out there, but that’s perfectly understandable. Still, a 
big job ahead and this is what he has been picked for.

Usman Khawaja first Australian to score Test century since Steve Smith, 3rd 
Test v Sri Lanka. That's 381 overs and 14 balls#AUSvSA

66th over: Australia 191-3 (Khawaja 103, Handscomb 1) Four slips in place for 
Handscomb, Philander I am sure very happy to be given another chance at the 
Victorian right hander on debut. He’s forced to play and defend, facing up deep 
in his crease. It’s a tough initial interrogation for the 25-year-old, but he 
comes across as a savvy enough operator to understand that. A good late leave 
to end the over suggests some confidence. A maiden will be recorded in the 
book. Australia now trail by 68, with a quarter hour to come before dinner.

65th over: Australia 191-3 (Khawaja 103, Handscomb 1) Khawaja is using his 
feet to get to the pitch of Shamsi, it’s beautifully timed and to the rope. To 
98. Then 99 with another drive, this time to long-off. The cheer is bigger 
again for Hanscomb who takes one himself, his first run in Test cricket. Now 
back on strike and the field upKhawaja makes no mistake in cutting to a ton! A 
glorious way to get there, and he loves it. 197 balls with ten boundaries the 
others numbers in the equation. He needed to step up with the vast inexperience 
across Australia’s top six, and then again when Dave Warner was prevented from 
opening last night. He’s done both beautifully. There’ll be some scrutiny over 
the run out with Smith, but time for that later. For now, it’s all about Usman. 
What a superb century.
