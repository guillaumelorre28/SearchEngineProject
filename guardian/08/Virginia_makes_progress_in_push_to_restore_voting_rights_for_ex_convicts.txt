Tammie Hagen has a secret code for finding felons. Touring the streets of 
Richmond on her bicycle, the 51-year-old former restaurant manager stops 
Virginians and asks if they are registered to vote.

If the answer is “I can’t”, she follows up with the stigma-sensitive phrase: 
“Are you still on supervision?”

It elicits a knowing response from those who, like her, want to take part in 
democracy but have been barred in theirmillions across the US 
<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/06/us/unequal-effect-of-laws-that-block-felons-from-voting.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0>
, due to a brush with the criminal justice system at some point in their lives.

As the deadline approaches for registering to take part in one of the most 
consequential US elections in a generation,Virginia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia> is the exception to 
controversial state rules that ban those convicted of a felony from voting.

The state’s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, had to circumvent 
Republican-led attempts in the state supreme court to block a blanket amnesty, 
and he did so byindividually clearing felons to vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/22/virginia-restores-voting-rights-felons-governor-terry-mcauliffe>
 – one signature at a time. An estimated 70,000 ex-offenders are now thought to 
have been registered to vote before the deadline of 17 October.

In the presidential election, Virginia – a state Donald Trump once hoped to 
win – looks so far out of reach that Trump’s campaign isreported to have pulled 
out

. But severaltightening House races 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/12/heres-how-good-a-shot-democrats-have-of-actually-winning-the-house/?tid=sm_fb>
 there could yet make the difference in the battle for control of Congress.

The on-off nature of the restoration of rights in Virginia has confused many. 
Thirteen thousand former offenders who registered to vote when McAuliffe first 
attempted an automatic clearance were later told they had been disenfranchised 
once again, when thecourt ruled his executive action was in breach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/virginia-executive-order-felon-voting-supreme-court>
 of the state constitution.

Hence the effort through individual signatures, as groups such as New Virginia 
Majority <http://www.newvirginiamajority.org/>, for which Hagen now works, are 
scrambling to find suitable candidates for gubernatorial clemency. The effort 
is as much about overcoming weary cynicism as getting paperwork to the 
governor’s office in time.

 “It felt pretty bleak,” says Hagen as she describes reaction to the first 
setback. “People were really discouraged. I came across lots who were reluctant 
to try again. ‘It’s not going to happen,’ they’d say, ‘my vote’s not going to 
happen.’”

It is a feeling with which she can sympathise, as she says she had “consigned” 
herself “to never voting in my life”, thanks to a string of “petty drug 
offences” that led to her first felony conviction at 25 and a last one six or 
seven years ago.

But rehabilitation led to a conviction that ex-offenders deserve to play a 
role in political life. Hagen estimates she has registered 600-800 Virginians 
and submitted “several hundred requests” for restoration of voting rights to 
the governor’s office.

In the north of the state, where Democrats are targeting several House seats 
once seen as impossibly out of reach, on Tuesday volunteers knocking on doors 
registered 200 new voters out of the Alexandria office alone.

Florida’s disenfranchised: voices of the 1.7 million not allowed to vote

But this last-minute rush for electors is not welcomed by all. A few miles 
from Alexandria, a leading conservative critic of the governor’s policy is 
deeply uncomfortable with what he sees as a nakedly partisan attempt to 
enfranchise voters who largely lean Democratic.

 “If you are not willing to follow the law then you can’t demand a right to 
make the law for everyone else, which is what voting is about,” says Roger 
Clegg, the president of theCenter for Equal Opportunity 
<http://www.ceousa.org/voting/voting-news/felon-voting>. 

“You can’t assume somebody has turned over a new leaf once they have walked 
out of prison.”

 Clegg is particularly scathing of the argument that preventing ex-offenders 
from voting is a ploy to limit the voice of African Americans in politics.

 “The fact that felons are disproportionately this or that colour does not 
make these rules racist any more than the fact that felons are 
disproportionately male makes these laws sexist,” he argues.

 Even the harshest critics of the reforms concede that a rush of new faces to 
the polls can also be a sign of a healthy democracy. They would simply prefer 
more stringent tests before the right is restored.

 “The best argument that the other side has to make is that it is important to 
do what we can to reintegrate felons back into society and it certainly would 
be a bad thing if society sent a message that once you have committed a felony 
your civil life is over,” Clegg says.

 “But the automatic reinfranchisement of felons misses an opportunity to do 
that kind of reintegration. There should be a ceremony like a naturalisation 
ceremony, where you go down to the courthouse and the person brings their 
friends and family around and everyone has a little American flag. That would 
be meaningful.”

 For those on the streets trying to persuade ex-offenders to give democracy a 
second chance, there is plenty of meaning in the process already.

 “These are folks who have been systematically kicked out of the system, who 
have been ignored,” says Matthew Rogers, regional field director of New 
Virginia Majority in Alexandria.

“Many of them do not even know their rights have been restored. So many of 
them break down in tears they are so excited.”
