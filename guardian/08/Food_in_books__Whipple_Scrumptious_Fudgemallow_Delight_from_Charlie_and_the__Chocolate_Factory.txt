“Why not?” the fat shopkeeper said, reaching behind him again and taking 
another Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight from the shelf. He laid it on 
the counter.

Charlie picked it up and tore off the wrapper... and suddenly... from 
underneath the wrapper... there came a brilliant flash of gold.

Charlie’s heart stood still.

After a night of only half sleeping, I awoke on Wednesday, to the news I’d 
been dreading for months. I really don’t know where we go to from Donald 
Trump’s victory. I know elections are won and lost all the time all around the 
world, but this one feels different. Like June’s Brexit vote here, a campaign 
run on division, on fear, and on hatred of any perceived ‘difference’ has 
triumphed. I don’t quite know how to process that information.

In the past 36 hours, I have had conversations with friends and family who 
feel the same; we don’t know what to do, or how to move forward. My darling 
sister, in Seattle, is a post-doc virologist, with a job in a research 
laboratory. She is surrounded each day by talented colleagues, who, like her, 
hail from countries all over the world. Yesterday morning, after the election 
result (and following a much called for breakfast of peanut butter cookies), 
she walked into work to find everyone in varying degrees of shock. I imagine 
it’s the same in many offices, schools, hospitals and businesses in the States. 
I have no idea how she and her colleagues are soldiering on; I found it near 
impossible to sit down and write about books today. With everything else that 
is happening, it feels like it’s just so futile.

The thing is, it’s not. We need books – now especially. We need stories that 
introduce us to worlds, cultures and ideas outside of our own. We need to feel 
comforted, and challenged, and inspired. We need to return to familiar 
favourites, and to seek out work by writers we’re yet to discover, to lose 
ourselves in the stories they have created. In the weeks and months to come, I 
want to find more tangible things to do, and ways to move forward in a world I 
don’t recognise. But for now, I’m going to get lost in my books.

Today, as I looked over my bookshelves, I found myself thinking about the 
chocolate bar that held the Golden Ticket. The one the changed Charlie’s life 
forever: one tiny, everyday item, so full of hope and magic. It’s a fussy 
recipe, but if you have a Saturday afternoon to make some chocolate, it’s such 
a lovely one. Alternatively, the marshmallow and the salted caramel are great 
on their own – when I first made this, we squeezed the leftovers from the 
piping bags over ice-cream and straight onto our fingers, to be greedily licked 
off.

Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight

Makes 12 bars

Ingredients
 600g dark chocolate (70%) 
Ganache 
100g dark chocolate 
200ml double cream
 Salted Caramel Sauce
 110g caster sugar
 45g salted butter (chopped into small pieces)
 70ml double cream
 1.5tsp flaked sea salt
 Marshmallow 
 2 egg whites 
100g caster sugar
 2tbsp golden syrup
 Pinch salt

Equipment 
Small heavy-bottomed saucepan
 2 large heatproof bowl 
Whisk
 Large saucepan
 Electric hand whisk
 3 disposable piping bags
 Spatula 
Silicone chocolate mould (I bought mine from eBay - each bar is 1.3cm deep, 
10cm long and 4.5cm wide)
Chocolate thermometer 
Plastic spoon 
Palette knife

1. First, make the ganache. Place the chocolate, in small pieces, in a large 
heatproof bowl. Bring the cream almost to the boil in a saucepan, then pour 
over the chocolate. Allow to sit for a minute, then stir with a whisk until the 
chocolate is melted. Allow to cool for a couple of minutes, then cover with 
cling film and place in the fridge for an hour.

2. To make the fudge sauce, place the caster sugar in a small, heavy-bottomed 
saucepan. Melt over a low-medium heat until the sugar has dissolved and the 
caramel has turned a dark, golden colour. Remove from the heat, whisk in the 
butter and then the cream. The mixture might separate a bit, but just continue 
to whisk. Pour into a separate bowl to cool. Add the salt, and stir.

3. Put the marshmallow ingredients in a large heatproof bowl over a pan of 
barely simmering water. Whisk on a high speed for 5-6 minutes until the 
marshmallow forms strong peaks.

4. Pull the ganache (which should have solidified) out of the fridge and whisk 
it on a high speed for a couple of minutes until it is light and aerated. Scoop 
all three fillings into separate disposable piping bags and set them aside.

5. Next, temper 400g of the chocolate for the shells (if you have moulds for 
12 bars - if you only have 6 moulds, as I did, temper half now and half later). 
Place 270g of this chocolate in the heatproof bowl over a pan of barely 
simmering water, ensuring that the water doesn’t ever touch the bowl directly. 
Stir the chocolate while it melts, keeping the heat as low as you can. Once the 
chocolate has melted, pay close attention to it and remove it from the heat 
once it has reached 52C. Remove the bowl from the heat and wrap the base in a 
tea towel to keep it warm. Add the remaining 130g of the chocolate and stir it 
in. Once melted, continue to stir until the temperature of the chocolate 
reduces to 32C.

6. Use the plastic spoon to transfer small amounts of the chocolate into each 
mould, and push it around until it covers the base and sides. Add more if you 
can still see the light through the chocolate when you hold it up to a window, 
and pay careful attention to the grooves, corners and sides. Set the chocolate 
aside on the bench (so long as it’s a cool day and you don’t have the heating 
on too high) until set.

7. Snip the tip off each piping bag, creating a half centimeter hole. Pipe a 
layer of the ganache into the each chocolate shell, and smooth with a palette 
knife. Pipe a strip of fudge sauce down the centre and then pipe a layer of 
marshmallow over the top. Place in the fridge for 20 minutes to solidify a 
little. While the bars are in the fridge, temper the rest of the chocolate for 
the base, using the same method as before. Once the chocolate is tempered, 
spoon it over the marshmallow layer and, using a chocolate scraper or palette 
knife, scrape across the top once, ensuring the chocolate has gone right to the 
corners.

8. Return the bars to the fridge for half an hour, then turn them out. The 
long bars can be quite fiddly, but take it slow. I had the most success when 
holding the mould upside down over the edge of a table, and slowly peeling the 
silicone back.

Wrap the bars in foil and store in the fridge if you’re not eating them 
immediately - they do melt on a warm day! The gorgeous wrappers here were made 
by my brilliant friend Anna.
