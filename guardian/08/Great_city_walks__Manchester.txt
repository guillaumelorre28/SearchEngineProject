In a nutshell

This circular walk treats you to some of the highlights of Manchester city 
centre, including a historic Roman fort. From St Peter’s Square, you’ll head 
along the Rochdale Canal to Castlefield, before looping back to the start.

Why it’s special

The mix of history, scenery and canalside walking make this a wonderfully 
enjoyable route, with lots to see. Rochdale Canal isn’t far from St Peter’s 
Square and following the towpath you’ll pass Oxford Street lock and Tib lock, 
before you reach Duke’s lock. It was named after Francis Egerton, Duke of 
Bridgewater, who paid for its construction.

The route crosses the pretty Bridgewater canal basin before climbing to the 
Roman fort, Mamucium. Built around AD78, it once guarded the road between the 
fortress of Deva Victrix, which later evolved into Chester, and Eboracum, now 
York.

Passing the Museum of Science and Industry <http://www.mosi.org.uk>, which 
occupies the site of the former Liverpool Road train station and houses many 
interesting exhibits, you’ll head through the scenic St John’s Gardens. On St 
John Street you can see the only surviving Georgian terrace in central 
Manchester.

The final leg of the walk takes you past Manchester Central 
<http://www.manchestercentral.co.uk> convention centre and Bridgewater Hall 
<http://www.bridgewater-hall.co.uk>, a concert venue built on 300 giant steel 
springs to protect the acoustics.
