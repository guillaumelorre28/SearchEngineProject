Blimey, it’s wet here. The 40-minute drive from Aberdeen airport to Banchory 
is through overhanging woods and rain-dark farmland, as unseen elves chuck 
endless buckets of rainwater at me.

Aberdeenshire is no stranger to wet weather. A year ago this month, incessant 
rain and unseasonal snowmelt resulted in the county’s worst floods for 200 
years. At Ballater the river Dee burst its banks and in minutes the main street 
was under water. Local holidaymaker Prince Charles has joined the villagers’ 
valiant rebuilding efforts by repurposing an ex Co-op as a restaurant. It 
opened last month, shining the spotlight on the region’s excellent fresh and 
wild ingredients. These I’m game to discover, together with the rest of 
Deeside’s foodie scene.

Banchory is the biggest town in Royal Deeside 
<https://www.visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/royal-deeside-p237731>; 
Ballater (for Balmoral) and Braemar lie further west towards the river’s 
salmony source. The Dee here is joined by the peaty, foamy river Feugh, and the 
cold, soft waters gush and tumble to the North Sea.

Banchory Lodge Hotel <http://www.banchorylodge.com/> (doubles from £120 B&B) 
is toasty warm and blissfully dry, a place to unwind with an excellent whisky. 
At 23, head chef Fraser Rodman has already earned hisScotch Beef Club 
<http://www.scotchbeefclub.org/> grill stripes. He serves impeccable local 
ingredients in caber-tossing portions: my steak and ale suet pudding (£12.50) 
all but sunk me. The town is a staid, stone-and-mortar place. “When our serving 
staff started wearing jeans there was local outrage,” says Rodman.

Notwithstanding this devotion to tradition, Banchory also has two other great, 
modern places to eat.The Cowshed <http://www.cowshedrestaurantbanchory.co.uk/> 
has a chic chip shop attached and a grown-up menu: special mention to the 
lamb’s liver with oatmeal potatoes and salted onion marmalade (£10.50), and the 
huge, dive-in wine glasses. AndBuchanans Green Bistro 
<http://www.buchananfood.com/green-bistro/> is joined to a wonderful arts 
centre. Val and Callum Buchanan are fuss-free food lovers whose thriving, airy 
place serves delightful snacks and handsome meals, with their own-baked cakes 
and brilliant breads. They ferment their own yoghurt, brew beers and pick from 
their fertile allotment. Gail and Rita forage mushrooms and herbs, and the 
place oozes hospitality.

The A93 to Ballater tracks the Dee west. I nip off at Finzean for the Farm Shop
 <http://finzean.com/FarmShop.html>, a shining example of how to remain 
relevant, even when rural and remote. From dawn, local farmers roll up for the 
papers and bacon rolls. Parents meet and shop here after the village school 
drop-off; by lunchtime there’s a throng of incomers gorging on muscular venison 
burgers (£10.95), followed by gargantuan Tipsy Laird’s cake. Followed by a lie 
down.

Like many of the region’s estates, Finzean offers cottages and country 
pursuits, from dragonfly spotting to full-on deer stalking. These are also 
bookable at the nearbyGlen Tanar <http://www.glentanar.co.uk/> near Aboyne, 
whose wild and wonderful Victorian ballroom is hung with hundreds of pairs of 
antlers dating from the estate’s time as a pleasure lodge for the likes of 
Lillie Langtry and her set.

Hard by the fast river and its Victorian suspension pedestrian bridge is the 
Cambus o’May creamery <http://cambusomay.com/>, a drop-in working dairy where 
cheesemaker Scott Sutherland-Thomson makes me welcome with nibbles of their 
unpasteurised, umami-rich cheeses.

On to Ballater, the granite village near Balmoral Castle, where most shops 
seem to hold a royal warrant for every service, from picture framing to haggis 
stuffing. Half of the premises along Bridge Street are boarded up – the flood 
sent some struggling businesses under – but I sensed a gritty community driving 
ahead.

Prince Charles’ Rothesay Rooms <https://rothesay-rooms.co.uk/> is dressed in 
dark greens, tartans and antler candelabra. Chef Guy Fenton has sourced fine 
local ingredients: organic beef, for his short ribs with neeps (£20), is from
Wark Farm <http://www.warkfarm.co.uk/> in nearby Alford, and fish is fresh off 
the Peterhead boats. Guy’s cullen skink (£7) has Arbroath smokies gussied up 
with quail’s egg, crème fraîche and an up-from-London foam touch. Next door is 
a Highgrove shop filled with biscuits and tourists.

Any Ballater post-flood dampness is further washed away at Rocksalt and Snails 
<https://www.facebook.com/Rocksaltandsnailsballater/>, with gallons of tea and 
Davinia’s deerstalker pie. If there’s a better one, I’ll eat my wet hat.

Behind Balmoral is the Royal Lochnagar Distillery 
<https://www.discovering-distilleries.com/royallochnagar/> (tours from £7.50), 
surrounded by barley fields and ice-melt streams, rightly proud of its 
grassy-green, “lightly firm” whisky.

Braemar <http://braemarscotland.co.uk/> is a lovely village, famous for its 
highlandgathering 
<http://braemarscotland.co.uk/events-whats-on/braemar-gathering/>, and with a 
timber-eaved hall for Highland flings,Lamont Sporran shop 
<http://www.sporrans.net/>, and NG Menzies Butchers – “Bag a brace of haggis”.

The Dee-side drive back to Banchory swings past dramatic glens and shrouded 
bens, the fat river flowing under tweedy hillsides and past Brigadoon castles. 
Sometimes the sun will break through the clouds, casting a filmy lightness over 
the mountainsides. There are immense stands of Scots pine, and lonely, glassy 
lochans with wild ducks.

Along the fern-lined road is Riverside Cottage 
<http://www.riversidecottagecafe.co.uk/>, where there’s a tapas evening and 
music by local fiddler Paul Anderson. Paul is a master musician and a 
historian, proud – in a humble way – of his place. “Like those who played 
before me, I’m inspired by what I look at every day. The beauty…” he starts, 
before launching into “Some jigs from the 1700s” accompanied by a pal on the 
bagpipes. “I see the rain washed over us today,” he says to me over a brace of 
local Macbeth beers and inevitable whisky chasers. “Looks like Royal Deeside 
has baptised you, too.”
