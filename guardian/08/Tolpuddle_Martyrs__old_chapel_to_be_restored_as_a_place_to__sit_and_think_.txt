A small derelict agricultural building beside the main road through the Dorset 
village of Tolpuddle is to be restored as “a quiet place” to sit and think, in 
honour of the structure’s little known role in British trade union history.

A sycamore tree in the centre of the village 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/15/arts.politics>, a few hundred yards 
from the old barn, is famous as the meeting place of the six agricultural 
labourers who became known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs, after they were sentenced 
to transportation to Australia in 1834 for daring to collectively demand better 
wages and working conditions, as their already miserable pay was being cut from 
nine to six shillings a week.

They were pardoned two years later after their cause became a national 
campaign, and a petition was signed by 800,000 people. Their history is 
celebrated in a festival and rally organised every summer by the Trades Union 
Congress, and told ina small museum <http://www.tolpuddlemartyrs.org.uk/> in 
the village.

Few who come to the rallies know that years before the meetings under the the 
tree, most of the men met regularly in the little building, which was 
originally the plainest and most modest of one-room Methodist chapels.

 It was built in 1818 by two of the martyrs, George Loveless and Thomas 
Standfield on a tiny patch of land they leased beside the latter’s cottage 
home. The pair were almost certainly the two who were recorded as returning 
with “their hearts glowing with sacred flame” after walking the 20 miles to and 
from a Methodist meeting in the town of Wareham. At least four of the six 
martyrs were Methodist.

It became redundant when the village got a larger Methodist chapel in 1862, 
and was altered to become a small barn and stable.

Andrew McCarthy, who lives a few houses away, thinks the two martyrs must have 
built it with their own hands. “It looks like a barn because essentially that’s 
what it was – the type of building they saw every day, made of simple cheap 
materials, cob with a bit of brick and flint, sticks and branches and thatch 
for the roof.”

McCarthy chairs the Tolpuddle Old Chapel Trust 
<http://tolpuddleoldchapeltrust.org/TheTrust/news/>, which bought the building 
just in time to save it from collapse and learned a few weeks ago that it had 
won a development grant of almost £65,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund – and 
is on track for a full grant of almost £350,000.

The building is listed Grade II*, the second highest category, in honour of 
its importance not just for the martyrs’ story but as a rare survival of one of 
the simplest early Methodist chapels. The trust succeeded in buying it for 
£25,000, after the farmer had turned down approaches both from the Methodists 
and the TUC. The building had spent many years on theat risk register 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/21/feminism-birthplace-old-brighton-london-zoo-aviary-historic-sites-risk-endangered-english-heritage>
 of nationally important buildings in danger of being lost forever, too 
derelict even for storage.

The old chapel will be restored as simply as possible, reinstating the 
original entrance door and restoring the one attempt at grandeur, a gothic 
arched window. But the interior will be left empty, apart from a bench, and an 
old Methodist bible given to McCarthy by a garden centre owner who found it – 
wrapped in plastic – in one of her polytunnels.


The village has lost its shop, but still has a village hall, a pub, and the 
museum.

 “We don’t need to duplicate any of those things,” McCarthy said. “What we 
want is a place where people can escape from the busy world for a little while, 
and just sit down on the bench and be quiet for a bit – and think about the 
history of the martyrs, what they believed in, their connection with the land 
and this building. Or – they can just sit.”
