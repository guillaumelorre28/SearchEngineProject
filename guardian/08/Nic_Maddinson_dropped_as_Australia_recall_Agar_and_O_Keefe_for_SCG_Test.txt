Australia will take three spin options into Tuesday’s third Test against 
Pakistan in Sydney, with Steve O’Keefe and Ashton Agar joining Nathan Lyon in 
the 13-man squad for the SCG.

Batsman Nic Maddinson has been dumped after struggling at No6 in his first 
three Tests, while South Australian seamer Chadd Sayers is also out. Uncapped 
all-rounder Hilton Cartwright remains in the side and will vie for the number 
six spot, with Matthew Wade also an option to move up the order.

With a tour of India on the horizon, Australia are likely to play two spinners 
in Sydney after wrapping up a 2-0 series victory with a last-gasp win in the 
Boxing Day Test. Lyon was under pressure to perform on day five and delivered 
three key wickets, and it is likely only one of Agar and O’Keefe will come in 
to partner the incumbent.

Australia’s 13-man squad: Matt Renshaw, David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steve 
Smith (capt), Peter Handscomb, Matthew Wade, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, 
Nathan Lyon, Jackson Bird, Hilton Cartwright, Ashton Agar, Steve O’Keefe.
