Far, far away, Manchester


From 2 August, the normally hushed rooms of Manchester Art Gallery will be 
disrupted by the squeals of children as they discover a fantasy world of 
princesses and knights. Set over the two top floors of the gallery, the 
transformed space will include three tents where kids under 12 can create 
costumes and make films of their stories to project on to the gallery walls. 
Artists will also be on hand to organise art activities, and there will be 
sensory play areas for babies and toddlers.

Bike It, nationwide

Britain has 13,000 miles of walking and cycling routes, among them plenty of 
short, traffic free ones suitable for children. UK charity Sustrans is 
promoting its best family-friendly routes as part of its Free Range Kids 
campaign, aimed at ensuring future generations of independent, active children. 
The routes include the Spen Valley Greenway, near Bradford, a 5½-mile route 
along the River Exe in Devon and a nine-mile ride into the heart of the New 
Forest with Holmsey tearooms providing a handy pitstop. Or get a breath of sea 
air on a five-mile ride from Frinton to Clacton in Essex, building up an 
appetite for fish and chips.

 Let kids channel their inner Clapton at Brighton's School of Rock.

and Metal Hammer magazines to offer three courses in August. The Total Guitar

Wild Weekends, Staffordshire

Any budding Bear Grylls needs to learn survival skills before they embark on a 
perilous journey into the wilderness. A Wild Weekend on 6-7 August at Trentham 
Estate, near Stoke-on-Trent, will prepare your intrepid explorers by teaching 
them to use a selection of hunting tools, stalk their lunch, use a compass and 
make camouflage using natural materials. They will then get the chance to put 
these skills into action on navigation courses set up around the estate, 
culminating in a gruelling "circular challenge". Parents in search of some 
peace could head to the Trentham Gardens, described by Alan Titchmarsh as "one 
of the UK's must-see gardens."

Mr Stink, Salford and Nottingham

Written by Little Britain star David Walliams, this children's musical is 
literally causing a stink. It is described as Britain's first scratch n' sniff 
production, and children are given a booklet that they are encouraged to 
scratch and sniff at key points in the show. Despite an abundance of farts, 
belches and smelly socks, a touching tale emerges of 12-year-old Chloe, who is 
bullied at school and ignored at home. She befriends homeless Mr Stink and his 
dog, Duchess, but is met with opposition from her snooty, 
air-freshener-wielding mother.

Gruffalo Day, Norfolk

Legend has it that the sleepy county of Norfolk is home to one of the most 
infamous characters in children's literature – the Gruffalo. Holkham national 
nature reserve will be holding a storytelling session on 5 August to mark 
Gruffalo Day, inspiring kids to explore its 4,000 hectares in pursuit of the 
grizzly creature, along with other rare species including natterjack toads, 
barn owls, marsh harriers, lapwings and the monstrous-sounding garganey, which 
is in fact a harmless rare species of duck. The reserve includes sand flats, 
sand dunes, saltmarshes and woodland and offers beautiful views of the coast.

a science centre with 300 interactive exhibits. From July 30 to August 31,

their paces with their "Championsheeps" events including a farmyard assault
