Following the fun users had with the ‚Äúeffective power‚Äù iPhone text message bug 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/27/iphone-crash-bug-text-imessage-ios>
, people have been sending a link to users of Apple‚Äôs Safari browser that will 
crash their iPhones or Macs.


The link, which is simply crashsafari.com, overloads the default browser with 
a self-generating text string which populates the address bar. After about 20 
seconds or so it will force aniPhone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> to reboot, while significantly 
heating up as the smartphone tries to handle the code of the site.

A similar thing happens on iPads, which also has Safari, while even Android 
devices running Chrome heat up and become sluggish. Rebooting the iPhone or 
quitting Chrome on anAndroid <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android> 
device clears the problem.

Desktop and laptop computers are also affected to a lesser degree depending on 
how much processing power they contain. The site will cause Safari on a Mac to 
crash.Chrome <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chrome> on a Mac and PC 
also becomes bogged down.

The code of the website appears to generate an ever-increasing load, which 
becomes harder and harder for the browser to handle, likely resulting in a 
memory issue and forcing the reboot of the device.

As with the effective power text message bug, users have started sending the 
link disguised by URL shorteners with tempting text to get iPhone users to 
click on the link and crash their smartphones.

For the immediate future, iPhone users should be very careful about which 
shortened or obfuscated links they click on, should they be forced into 
rebooting their smartphone. One of the shortened links has already been clicked 
over 100,000 times.

Should the worst happen, it appears that smartphones will behave normally 
after a reboot.

code of the website appeared to generate an ever-increasing string of 
characters.
