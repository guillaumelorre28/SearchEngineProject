The last time the Perimeter Institute and quantum technology 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/apr/16/justin-trudeau-and-quantum-computers>
 appeared on this blog was when Justin Trudeau visited, and gave a 
much-discussed potted explanation of quantum computing. This evening Michele 
Mosca will give alecture 
<http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/outreach/general-public/public-lecture-series>
 on how we have moved from understanding quantum physics to using it in the 
development of new technologies and in doing new science. He will also 
speculate on what this might lead to next.

The live webcast will appear below, and will be replaced by a recording 
shortly after the event.
