The annual Guardian “hits and misses” feature, canvassing publishers about 
their high points and regrets of the year, always makes me wonder about what my 
friends and allies in the small-press world think about their own successes and 
failures. About whether they’d lament the same missed books and share the same 
triumphs as those in the corporate world. Or whether the small-press universe 
is entirely different. I put the questions to them once again and their replies 
were as intriguing as ever.

It was wonderful to see the acclaim pour down on Tommy Wieringa’s A Beautiful 
Young Wife 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/31/a-beautiful-young-wife-tommy-wieringa-review>
, an immaculate dissection of a middle-aged man’s delusions, written with 
unsparing economy, a perfect ear for the unguarded remark, and unforgettable 
imagery. This newspaper was among many to sing its praises, describing it as
“reminiscent of Updike at his very best”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/31/a-beautiful-young-wife-tommy-wieringa-review>
 Tommy is world class, and more and more readers in English are coming to 
realise it.

Our book that deserved to do better
The Sacred Combe <https://thepigeonhole.com/books/the-sacred-combe> by Thomas 
Maloney marries the familiar – a tale of a marriage imploding, a search for 
meaning, and a family battered by loss – with the unusual: a living argument 
between Enlightenment and Romance, embodied in an ancient house, its 
inhabitants and the landscape. And overlays it with allusion galore. Praised by 
good literary bloggers and notables such as Richard Holmes and Jim Perrin, it 
was largely ignored by the broadsheets and bookshops on publication this summer.

I wish I’d published
The book that left its teethmarks on me was Svetlana Alexievich’s Second-Hand 
Time 
<http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/from-second-hand-time-by-svetlana-alexievich-1/>
(Fitzcarraldo), ugly-frank, full of a strange, cruel nostalgia, artless yet 
artful, and devastatingly real in baring a host of Russian souls chorally, in 
all their challenging complexity. The most beautifully uplifting book was 
Christopher de Hamel’sMeetings With Remarkable Manuscripts 
<https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/213069/meetings-with-remarkable-manuscripts/> 
(Allen Lane).

Guapa, Saleem Haddad’s debut 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/28/guapa-by-saleem-haddad-review>. 
Over the course of 24 hours, a young Arab gay man confronts questions of home 
and belonging after his grandmother catches him in bed with his lover. It’s a 
moving and wryly humorous novel that bridges cultures in all sorts of ways.

Our book that deserved to do better
Night Prayers by Santiago Gamboa 
<http://www.europaeditions.com/book/9781609453114/night-prayers>, a story about 
the strength of the bond between siblings, a foretold mystery, and an account 
of a troubled time in the recent history of Colombia all rolled into one. We’re 
publishing Gamboa’s new novel in 2017, and I very much hope he starts getting 
the recognition he deserves.

I wish I’d published

His Bloody Project 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/12/his-bloody-project-by-graeme-macrae-burnet-review>
 (Saraband). I read it earlier this year and loved it. It’s the kind of book 
that requires the reader’s complete participation, the sense of place is so 
strong you feel you inhabit the remote crofters’ community, and it bends and 
blends genres with apparent effortlessness.

An Unreliable Guide to London

Our book that deserved to do better 
The Foreign Passion by Cristian Aliaga 
<https://neverimitate.wordpress.com/2016/05/24/book-review-the-foreign-passion/>
 (translated by Ben Bollig). Patagonian poetry in translation is never going to 
be a bestseller, but this book has a really insightful analysis of Europe told 
from the outer edges of Argentina.

 (published by OWNIT!). It’s an excellent debut novel about black masculinity 
told through a series of prison letters. Publisher Crystal Mahey-Morgan has 
done amazing things this year and deserves serious recognition.

 is a nightmarish wander through lust, violence and treacle-thick darkness. Its 
stories are lodged in my brain like a particularly unwholesome parasite.

Sunshine  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/oct/10/poet-melissa-lee-houghton-writing-world-mental-health-day>
 by Melissa Lee-Houghton has just been shortlisted for the Costa awards, which 
is a big deal for a small publisher like us. Melissa speaks about things we 
don’t want to talk honestly about as a society: suicide, mental health, 
pornography. Sunshine is incredibly hard-hitting, but also stylish, surreal and 
funny. It’s essential poetry reading right now.

It’s still early days, but November’s Cenotaph South: Mapping the Lost Poets 
of Nunhead Cemetery 
<http://www.pennedinthemargins.co.uk/index.php/2016/10/cenotaph-south-mapping-the-lost-poets-of-nunhead-cemetery-2/>
 deserves a wide audience. Chris McCabe is on an epic quest to uncover all the 
lost poets of London’s Magnificent Seven cemeteries, and this latest instalment 
is full of Blakean mysteries, strange encounters and unexpected delights.

I wish I’d published
I’m currently reading The Hatred of Poetry 
<https://www.poetryfoundation.org/features/articles/detail/88730> by Ben Lerner 
(Fitzcarraldo Editions). It’s both a love letter to and a critique of the genre 
we all love to hate. As someone who spends his days (and nights) embroiled in 
poetry, I would have published this in a flash.

This has to go to Harry Gallon’s The Shapes of Dogs’ Eyes 
<http://sabotagereviews.com/2016/05/08/8314/> after coming runner-up in 
Sabotage’s best novella category. Gallon captures a particular millennial 
malaise as his protagonist is caught between stasis and growing up. Gallon’s 
magic is in how he turns this into something both hilarious and subversive with 
his hypnotic prose.

Our book that deserved to do better
Described by WordRiot as a novel that “highlights the creative importance of 
small publishers”, Lochlan Bloom’sThe Wave 
<https://lochlanbloom.com/writing/the-wave/> is impossible to describe 
succinctly as it moves through prose and screenplay, crossing realities as it 
shifts. It is a mystery that can’t be satisfied, and that’s sort of the point!

I wish I’d published
Vertigo by Joanna Walsh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/04/vertigo-joanna-walsh-review-novel-paperback>
 – and I’ll keep recommending it way past everyone getting tired of me doing 
so. As soon as I finished the first story I was green with envy that And Other 
Stories had published this and not Dead Ink. If you ask me this question next 
year, I might just give the same answer.

The Handsworth Times by Sharon Duggal 
<https://bluemoosebooks.com/books/handsworth-times>: how one family struggles

injustice, struggling for their dignity.

If You Look at Me I Am Not Here by Sarayu Srivatsa 
<https://thewritesofwoman.wordpress.com/2016/01/20/if-you-look-for-me-i-am-not-here-sarayu-srivatsa/>
. Set in post-partition India, it is a saga about history, identity and 
loyalty. So far, so Rushdie, you may think – but what sets this apart is the 
deftness of touch, a true intimacy, and characters who are so much more than 
mere cyphers or symbols.

I wish I’d published
Moonstone by Sjón

Having only joined Comma at the final stages of production, working on Iraq + 
100 <http://commapress.co.uk/books/iraq-100> was about as exciting a baptism of 
fire as I could get. The variety of coverage that the book received was 
incredible, and I loved the strange futures and darkly humorous stories that 
arose from the commission. Glass of blood wine, anyone?

Our book which deserved to do better 
Scent: The Collected Works  
<http://commapress.co.uk/books/scent-the-collected-works/> is a compendium of 
Dinesh Allirajah’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2015/feb/02/dinesh-allirajah-obituary>
delicately understated short stories, his extraordinary, intellectually 
acrobatic blogposts, and his jazz-inspired poetry. As a writer who spent more 
time supporting others in the region than promoting himself, Din deserved to be 
better known in his tragically short lifetime than he was ; this book is our 
chance to redress that.

I wish I’d published 
I recently finished The Power by Naomi Alderman  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/02/the-power-naomi-alderman-review>
and it certainly lived up to expectation. Its clever inversion of gendered 
society is as funny and dark and disturbing as it should be, and, as all good 
SF does, it invites you to take a long hard look at the world around you. I 
would have loved to be involved in its creation!

Publishing Feeding Time by Adam Biles <http:// 
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/17/feeding-time-by-adam-biles-review>
 was a joy. Partly because of the simple delight of helping bring something so 
good into the world and knowing how funny it was, how unsettling and how full 
of human warmth. But also because it got some stonking reviews and we were 
lucky enough to launch it in Shakespeare & Company. That was one of the 
proudest, and most enjoyable experiences of my career, let alone this year.

Our book that deserved to do better
Forbidden Line by Paul Stanbridge 
<http://davidjcollard.blogspot.co.uk/2016/12/forbidden-line-essex-epic.html> 
has only just come out, and, in all honesty, I’m hoping the best is yet to 
come. It’s already had some pretty astonishing praise and I’m crossing my 
fingers for good coverage in the new year. But, like every publisher, I think 
it should have been announced with trumpets in heaven, all traffic coming to a 
standstill and frantic announcements on the News at Ten. This book is 
incredible and I just want it to get the attention it deserves.

I wish I’d published
Scary Old Sex by Arlene Heyman 
<http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-erotic-truths-of-scary-old-sex>
 (Bloomsbury). By some measures, this one possibly also deserved to do better 
and receive more attention here in the UK. But it is also brilliant and 
hilarious and true – and that’s what counts. People will be enjoying it for 
years to come and I’ll get a pang every time I see it.

It has been a joy to publish Elizabeth Haynes’s new novel, Never Alone 
<http://www.myriadeditions.com/books/never-alone/>. This is rural noir at its 
best – a woman alone, an isolated farmhouse, snow, dogs and delicious plotting. 
Haynes excels at placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances and, as 
with her bestselling debutInto the Darkest Corner 
<mailto:http://www.myriadeditions.com/books/into-the-darkest-corner/>, this 
novel is touching people’s lives.

Our book that deserved to do better 
Will Volley’s masterly graphic novel, The Opportunity 
<http://www.forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/2016/directors-commentary-will-volley-on-the-opportunity/>
 exposes the unforgiving world of door-to-door selling. Reviewers have likened 
it to David Mamet’s Glengarry Glen Ross and heralded a modern-day Death of a 
Salesman but it hasn’t yet reached the wider audience it deserves.

I wish I’d published 
Refugee Tales <mailto:http://commapress.co.uk/books/refugee-tales> (Comma 
Press) takes its lead from Chaucer and charges modern-day storytellers, 
including Ali Smith, Chris Cleave and Patience Agbabi, to relate the plight of 
those held indefinitely at Gatwick’s airport’s immigration detention centres. 
With The Detainee’s Tale, The Lorry Driver’s Tale, The Dependant’s Tale and 
others, we cannot fail to be moved and better understand the fate of refugees.

Wonders Will Never Cease by Robert Irwin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/17/wonders-will-never-cease-by-robert-irwin-review>
: The Game of Thrones with real history or “a sort of marriage between AS Byatt 
and Terry Pratchett: one you can enjoy greatly on the first reading, but which 
will be even better second time round, as it’s so densely packed with learning 
and allusions. This is a lightning trip around 15th-century culture, European 
culture and indeed world culture. Bravo.” (Tibor Fischer in the Guardian).

Our debut title, Dodge and Burn <http://www.dodoink.com/dodge-and-burn/> by 
Seraphina Madsen – a beautifully written, drug-infused, psychedelic road trip. 
Seraphina explores a literary territory that is usually dominated by male 
authors; she was influenced by Burroughs and Hunter S Thompson but has carved 
out a niche all of her own. We were very proud when it received rave reviews 
from book bloggers, was longlisted for the Republic of Consciousness prize and 
chosen by Foyles (Charing Cross) as a staff pick.

The book that made my year

Laura Powell’s The Unforgotten 
<http://freightbooks.co.uk/the-unforgotten-by-laura-powell.html> is a 
psychological thriller set in 1950s Cornwall. It’s about a transgressive love 
affair between a 15-year-old girl and 30-year-old journalist, set against the 
background of a series of murders of young women. It’s a great page-turner, is 
brilliantly written and has sold strongly.

Our book that deserved to do better
Neil Mackay’s The Wolf Trial 
<http://www.freightbooks.co.uk/the-wolf-trial-by-neil-mackay.html> is a novel 
based on the true story of Peter Stumpf, the first convicted serial killer in 
history – who was tried as a werewolf in Germany in 1563. It’s a brilliant 
epic, combining elements of literary fiction and horror. While it has been 
successful, selling well in hardback and international sales, it received 
virtually no press interest outside Scotland. I hope the paperback, due in 
June, attracts the attention this fabulous work deserves.

Panty by Sangeeta Bandyopadhyay <http://www.tiltedaxispress.com/books/#/panty/>
, translated by Arunava Sinha. This condensed, surreal exploration of sexual

wonderful Dhaka Lit Fest.

Our book that deserved to do better 
One Hundred Shadows 
<http://www.tiltedaxispress.com/books/#/one-hundred-shadows/> by Hwang Jungeun, 
translated by Jung Yewon. An award-winning novel by one of the rising stars of

violent gentrification. Praised by Han Kang and compared to Murakami – what 
higher recommendation can there be?

The Empty Space by Geetanjali Shree 
<http://www.seagullbooks.org/index.php?p=book_details&book_id=NjIy&cat_id=MTM3>

<https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/books/bricks-and-mortar>) is a polyphonic 
novel about the emergence of a sex trade in a big city in the former GDR, from 
just before 1989 to the present day. It pays homage to modernist, East German 
and contemporary writers such as Alfred Döblin, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, 
Wolfgang Hilbig and David Peace. But the author uses his own style and almost 
hallucinatory techniques. I cannot emphasise enough how much I would like more 
people to read this novel.

I wish I’d published
Sudden Death by Álvaro Enrigue, translated by Natasha Wimmer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/sudden-death-by-alvaro-enrigue-review>
. This is one of the best novels I’ve read all year. It is, on the surface, 
about a tennis match between the poet Quevedo and the painter Caravaggio in 
Rome in the 16th century. But it’s also about the conquest of Mexico, sex, art, 
the novel, the Catholic church, the history of tennis. You’d be hard-pressed to 
find a book that was at once so bold in style and ambitious in structure and so 
much fun to read.

I must mention a 2015 title, Signs Preceding the End of the World 
<http://www.andotherstories.org/book/signs-preceding-the-end-of-the-world/> by 
Yuri Herrera, translated by Lisa Dillman. Apart from continuing to woo many 
readers this year, it won the 2016 best translated book award. And I would love 
Trump to read it: a short novel that takes you, with a great writer’s flair, 
right into the head, heart and life of a strong Mexican woman who crosses the 
border to the US and to a new hybrid identity.

Our book that deserved to do better
Wolfgang Bauer’s Crossing the Sea: With Syrians on the Exodus to Europe 
<http://www.andotherstories.org/book/crossing-the-sea-with-syrians-on-the-exodus-to-europe/>
 (translated by Sarah Pybus) is the first time a journalist has actually been 
smuggled by sea and reported on it. Many people loved it, including Robert 
Fisk, the UNHRCR spokesperson Melissa Fleming and the novelist Nell Zink, but 
we expected more coverage.

I wish I’d published
Second-hand Time by Svetlana Alexievich 
<https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/books/second-hand-time>. I’d seen this in 
Suhrkamp Verlag’s catalogue a few years ago and thought it looked amazing, but 
at the time we weren’t publishing nonfiction. Well, it is amazing. Reportage by 
oral testimony is a great form and she’s a master.

The book that made my year 


A Fine Line <https://www.bitterlemonpress.com/products/a-fine-line> by 
Gianrico Carofiglio was the opportunity to resume our love affair with Guido 
Guerrieri, defence lawyer of lost causes. This is the latest in the series and 
in it Guerrieri tangles with judicial corruption and its toxic seepage not only 
through a single court but through the rule of law itself.

Our book that deserved to do better
Exhibitions by Richard Dorment 
<http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/05/the-art-critic-who-loved-to-provoke-the-establishment/>
. A reasonably priced, beautifully designed and illustrated book that brings 
together a selection of more than 100 forthright, scholarly, bold, vivid and 
fascinating critical essays by the former art critic of the Telegraph. Should 
be at the top of the nonfiction lists.

I wish I’d published
The North Water 
<http://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/The-North-Water/Ian-McGuire/9781471151248>
 (Scribner) by Ian McGuire. The tale of an opium-addicted 19th-century Irish 
surgeon who encounters a vicious psychopath on board an Arctic-bound whaling 
ship. Beautifully written, often violent, but somehow always lyrical.

breach by Olumide Popoola and Annie Holmes 
<https://www.peirenepress.com/books/peirene_now/breach>. A series of connected 
stories about life in the Calais refugee camp. Peirene’s first commissioned 
fiction book addressing urgent political topics via literature.

Our book that deserved to do better
The Empress and the Cake by Linda Stift 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/28/empress-and-the-cake-by-linda-stift-review-kafkaesque-nightmare>
. A chilling, quirky, Austrian psycho-thriller about the obsessions of the 
mind, Empress Elisabeth and cake, of course. Continental readers loved it, 
British readers seem to be bewildered. Interesting indeed.

I wish I’d published
A World Gone Mad: The Diaries of Astrid Lindgren  
<http://www.pushkinpress.com/book/a-world-gone-mad/>1939–1945 (Pushkin Press). 
A riveting insight into the world of the creator of Pippi Longstocking. It’s 
also a compelling chronicle of the second world war from a Swedish point of 
view – a country that remained neutral throughout. An intelligent, entertaining 
read.
