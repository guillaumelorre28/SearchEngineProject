Through the lens of literature, something interesting happens to the world of 
sand and sea, harbours and hotels. In fiction, the seaside frequently 
represents a threshold between order and chaos, society and nature, identity 
and its loss, with a move or visit to the coast signalling a shift from the 
former to the latter. This undermining of tradition or self is reflected in 
eroding coastlines, in crumbling houses, in the disintegration of narrative 
structure itself.


The seashore can represent renewal, and after a spell at the seaside – in 
fiction as in real life – one might turn around and return inland, changed. At 
the same time, though, there is a link between a coastal setting and some kind 
of compulsion towards death.

I explore these themes in my new novel, Death and the Seaside, in which a 
young woman, struggling to get a grip on her life and to finish a story she is 
trying to write, is encouraged to go to the coast for inspiration. My 10 
favourite seaside books – presented here in chronological order – likewise take 
the reader to the seafront, or into the sea.


1. The Awakening  <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/awakening.html>by Kate 
Chopin <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/awakening.html> (1899)
At the family’s summer house on the Gulf coast, Edna Pontellier begins to feel 
restless. After falling in love with a younger man, James, she struggles to 
reconcile her desires with her role as a wife and mother. Her husband, worrying 
about Edna’s mental health, complains to the doctor that she “lets the 
housekeeping go to the dickens”. Meanwhile, James has been teaching Edna to 
swim, ultimately enabling her, as Sandra M Gilbert puts it in an introduction 
to this landmark and – in its day – highly controversial novel, to swim “away 
from the shore of her old life

”.

2. Death in Venice  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/death-in-venice-and-other-stories.html>by 
Thomas Mann 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/death-in-venice-and-other-stories.html> 
(1912, English translation 1925)
In Venice, the honoured author Aschenbach acknowledges a deep longing “for 
nothingness”. Meanwhile, he is developing an obsession with a beautiful young 
boy, Tadzio. Despite the spread of a contagious disease, Aschenbach’s 
fascination causes him to remain at this coastal resort, where we see the 
disintegration of his mental, moral and physical self. Mann’s great novella 
yields more on every reading.

3. Brighton Rock  <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/brighton-rock.html>by 
Graham Greene <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/brighton-rock.html> (1938)
In this classic thriller, Charles Hale is on a newspaper assignment in 
Brighton when he meets Pinkie, a teenage gang leader, and realises that he is 
doomed: “Hale knew, before he had been in Brighton three hours, that they meant 
to murder him.” A hard core of hatred and violence runs through this novel, in 
which the seedy underworld becomes visible. After murdering Hale, Pinkie feels 
his world falling apart, as he tries to cover his tracks and keep hold of his 
alibi.

4. Holiday  <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/holiday-6.html>by Stanley 
Middleton <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/holiday-6.html> (1974)
Edwin Fisher has returned to the English seaside town in which he holidayed as 
a child, to reflect on the death of his young son and the failure of his 
marriage. In this resort, now under threat from cheap package holidays in 
exotic locations, and in the company of holiday acquaintances whose own 
relationships begin to seem increasingly shaky, Edwin’s contemplation of the 
past leads to a re-evaluation of events at home and a shift of perspective. I 
read this Booker-winning novel on holiday this summer, and Middleton’s voice is 
still in my ear.

5. The Bookshop  <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bookshop.html>by Penelope 
Fitzgerald <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bookshop.html> (1978)
In an abandoned old house in the fictional Suffolk seaside town of 
Hardborough, widow Florence Green opens a bookshop. She is challenged by rising 
damp, a poltergeist and local opposition. Hardborough exemplifies insularity: 
“The town itself was an island between sea and river, muttering and drawing 
into itself as soon as it felt the cold. Every 50 years or so it had lost, as 
though careless or indifferent to such things, another means of communication.” 
As David Nicholls says in an introduction to this witty and tragic novel, the 
final sentence is “one of the saddest I’ve ever read”.

6. The Sea, The Sea  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/02/iris-murdoch-the-sea-the-sea>by 
Iris Murdoch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/02/iris-murdoch-the-sea-the-sea> 
(1978)
In the same year that The Bookshop was shortlisted for the Booker prize, Iris 
Murdoch won with this novel, in which Charles Arrowby has retired from his 
successful career in the London theatre: “all those wonderful glittering 
absolutely vanished pantomimes”. He buys an isolated house – whose name means 
“Black End” – on a rocky coastline, a “great space for which I have been 
longing all my life”. He writes his memoirs and takes dips in a sea that is 
both attractive and dangerously difficult to get back out of. When he discovers 
that his childhood sweetheart lives in the village, he becomes obsessed.

7. Beside the Sea  <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/beside-the-sea.html>by 
Véronique Olmi <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/beside-the-sea.html> (2001, 
English translation 2010)
This is a claustrophobic and unsettling novella in which a single mother takes 
her two young boys to the seaside, where it rains, their hotel room looks on to 
a concrete wall, and the funfair leaves the younger boy sick and snivelling. 
The world beyond their trio is hostile, while the sea is both frightening (it 
is “a freezing great floating graveyard”) and welcoming (“It’s just saying how 
glad it is to see you, it’s really missed you!”). Foreshadowed by images of 
dissolution (“I told the kids, we’ll dissolve in all this water, and down we 
went onto the beach”) and minimal punctuation that gives the narrative a fluid 
and breathless quality, there is a sense of inevitability in the terrible act 
of love that follows.

8. The Sea  <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/sea.html>by John Banville 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/sea.html> (2005)
On a childhood seaside holiday, Max Morden meets the Grace children, but their 
friendship ends traumatically in a scene that goes on to haunt him. When he 
returns decades later, he is revisiting both the seaside village and the past. 
Banville vividly captures intangibles such as a feeling that time “has all 
begun to run together”, and the loss of self experienced by Max, now retired 
and widowed, which is expressed by a dream of trying to write his will on a 
machine that is lacking the letter “I”.

9. On Chesil Beach  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/25/fiction.ianmcewan>by Ian McEwan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/25/fiction.ianmcewan> (2007)
In the summer of 1962, Edward and Florence are honeymooning in a hotel on the 
Dorset coast. On their first night, as they sit down to supper, they are all 
too aware of the view, through the open bedroom door, of a four-poster bed with 
a pure-white bedcover. With the point of view shifting tidally between them, 
the narrative traces the couple’s history, their anxieties, and the crucial 
failures of communication and understanding that lead to the story’s painful 
denouement.

10. The Many  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/04/the-many-wyl-menmuir-review>by 
Wyl Menmuir 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/04/the-many-wyl-menmuir-review> 
(2016)

Nominated for this year’s Man Booker prize 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/27/man-booker-prize-2016-longlist-jm-coetzee>
, Wyl Menmuir’s debut novel describes Timothy Buchanan’s move to a coastal 
village, where he is troubled by fragments of information about a dead man, and 
bewildered by the fish that are trawled from the contaminated sea, and where he 
attempts to make a home. With its eerily strange setting, The Many is a 
desperately beautiful expression of grief.
