Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> attended a Sinn 
Féin fundraising dinner in New York just months before the party’s allies in 
the Provisional IRA ended its ceasefire with a massive terror attack in 
London’s Canary Wharf district.

As controversy rages over the Republican presidential candidate’s demand that 
Muslims be barred from the United States

 to prevent Islamist terror attacks, footage has emerged of the tycoon shaking 
hands with Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams.

For decades, Sinn Féin <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sinn-fein> and 
the IRA were the political and military wings of the Irish republican movement, 
and the party was frequently accused of being an apologist for terror.

Trump and Adams met in the Essex Hotel in Manhattan in March 1995 at an event 
organised by the US-based Friends of Sinn Fein.

Guests, including Trump – currently the frontrunner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/28/donald-trump-suffers-his-largest-drop-in-polls-after-week-of-controversy>
 in the race to become Republican presidential nominee – were charged a $200 
entry fee to hear Adams speak about the Irish peace process.

But less than four months later the PIRA ended its ceasefire with a huge bomb 
in London’s Docklands on 9 February 1996. Two men working in a nearby 
newsagents were killed in the massive explosion, which caused £100m in damage 
to the Canary Wharf/South Quay district.


On his way to the New York fundraiser a few months earlier, Trump would
have seen a group of demonstrators protesting ongoing IRA violence, including 
victims of the1993 Shankill bomb massacre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/24/northernireland.rosiecowan> in 
which 10 people died.

There were also protests from the relatives of Catholics who had been shot, 
beaten and exiled by the IRA even after the organisation declared its first 
ceasefire on 31 August 1994.

Friend to foe: Trump’s ugly descent into anti-Muslim rhetoric 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/dec/09/donald-trump-anti-muslim-video>
On the steps of the hotel, Alan McBride, whose wife was killed in the Shankill 
Road bombing, said: “He justifies the existence of the Provos, of Sinn Féin, of 
the IRA, claiming that they were fighting for a just and lasting peace. Well, 
I’m sorry, but I don’t see how my wife’s murder helped IRA/Sinn Féin achieve 
peace. It’s hypocrisy.Gerry Adams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gerryadams> is a hypocrite.”

As well as paying the $200 entry fee, business leaders and other donors, 
including a number of US celebrities, were asked to give donations to Friends 
of Sinn Féin.

During his speech, Gerry Adams even joked about Sinn Féin playing the “Trump 
card” from a podium close to where the businessman sat.

A spokesman for Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for 
comment.

Meanwhile, the fallout from Trump’s comments that Muslims should be banned 
from entering the US continued on Wednesday evening. Aberdeen’s Robert Gordon 
University announced that it is revoking the honorary doctorate it awarded to 
Donald Trump in 2010 “in recognition of his achievements as an entrepreneur and 
businessman”.

A spokesman for Robert Gordon university said: “In the course of the current 
US election campaign, Mr Trump has made a number of statements that are wholly 
incompatible with the ethos and values of the university. The university has 
therefore decided to revoke its award of the honorary degree.”

Anthony Baxter, the award-winning documentary maker who has made two films 
following Trump’s escapades in Scotland, also added his condemnation, saying 
Trump’s latest remarks expose his bullying behaviour to the world.

Baxter, whose films You’ve Been Trumped and A Dangerous Game document the 
environmental and community costs of the billionaire’s luxury golf development 
in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, and the subsequent struggles between the locals and 
Donald Trump and Scottish legal and governmental authorities, told the 
Guardian: “We already know golfers have chosen to boycott Trump’s Aberdeenshire 
course after watching You’ve Been Trumped because they were shocked by the 
bullying of local residents which was documented in the film. And his latest 
comments are simply an escalation of the bullying I’ve witnessed at first hand 
over the last half-decade.”

Baxter added: “The Menie Estate residents who opposed Mr Trump’s golf courses 
have endured years of intimidation – and now the world is beginning to wake up 
to what they’ve been going through – but on a much bigger scale. It remains to 
be seen if his call for a ban on Muslims entering the US will mean a wider 
boycott of his golf resorts in Scotland, and luxury developments elsewhere.”
