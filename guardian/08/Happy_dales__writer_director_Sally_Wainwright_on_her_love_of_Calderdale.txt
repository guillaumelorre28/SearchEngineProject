When I was growing up it felt to me as though Halifax were a cultural backwater
. I felt that I lived in the middle of nowhere. Everything I was interested in 
– theatre and television – was happening in London but now I think culture and 
art are no longer the domain of posh southern people, they’re everybody’s 
domain now. Culture is a lot less snobby than it was.

West Yorkshire has become increasingly important to me as I’ve got older. 
There’s a real depth to the landscape – it’s so dramatic and awe-inspiring. Now 
I see Calderdale – Halifax, Hebden Bridge, Ripponden, Sowerby Bridge and Elland 
– as really beautiful. That’s the area I think of as Happy Valley territory.

 Shibden Hall, Halifax 
What made me fall for the area again was learning about Shibden Hall 
<http://museums.calderdale.gov.uk/visit/shibden-hall> in Halifax – and the 
amazing landowner and adventurer Anne Lister who owned it. About 15 years ago, 
I read Jill Liddington’s bookFemale Fortune: The Anne Lister Diaries 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/secret-diaries-of-miss-anne-lister.html> and 
then went back to Shibden Hall, and to Halifax, and saw it in a different 
light. Ever since then I’m really proud of having come from there. The hall 
dates back to 1420 and it has fantastic gardens.

I grew up eight miles from Haworth, where the Brontë sisters grew up. The 
whole area is steeped in a fantastic cultural tradition. I’d encourage people 
to visit Haworth and theBrontë Parsonage Museum <https://www.bronte.org.uk/>, 
which was the lifelong family home of the Brontës.

The Piece Hall <http://www.thepiecehall.co.uk/> is a beautiful, unique Grade 
I-listed building in Halifax. It was built in 1779, early in the Industrial 
Revolution, and is full of tiny rooms where people brought their piecework 
(cloth) to sell. It’s on a hill so two sides of it are two-storey and two sides 
three-storey. It’s undergoing a £7mtransformation 
<http://www.thepiecehall.co.uk/future/vision/> and reopens next year.

I love looking up at Norland Moor from Sowerby Bridge. We used this view in a 
couple of scenes in Happy Valley. It gave us such fantastic, dramatic shots and 
just made me appreciate even more where I’d grown up. That landscape is so 
verdant and colourful.

Hebden Bridge is vibrant; there’s a lot going on artistically and it’s also 
got great galleries, pubs and restaurants. I tend to go for a drink at theWhite 
Lion <http://www.whitelionhotel.net/>, which is a former coaching inn close to 
the river but still in the centre of the town. And, when I need to stay in the 
town because we’re filming, I’m often at theCroft Mill Apartment Hotel 
<http://www.croftmill.com/> (studios sleeping two from £90 B&B) because it’s 
historic, fantastic and right in the centre of town. Hebden Bridge does have a 
seedier side though. There are problems with drug addiction, which is what I 
was writing about in Happy Valley, but there are also a lot of interesting 
people and arts festivals around the town, and you have theArvon foundation 
writing centre <http://www.arvon.org/> close by at Ted Hughes’s former home of 
Lumb Bank near Heptonstall.

The beer is great in this part of Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/series/best-craft-beer-pubs-around-the-uk+yorkshire>
. Last year, Happy Valley shared its production office with a small brewery,
Little Valley Brewery <http://www.littlevalleybrewery.co.uk/>.

It really interests me that the Brontë sisters’ brother, Branwell, worked at 
the railway station in Sowerby Bridge – and that he got sacked. He was then at 
the station in Luddendenfoot, which is slightly further on towards Hebden 
Bridge. Allegedly, he got the sack because he had his fingers in the till; 
whether that’s true or not I don’t know but I just find it funny he used to 
work at the station where I went to school.

Visiting the village of Heptonstall feels like stepping back in time. It’s a 
very unusual and exceptional place; the scenery is fantastic and Sylvia Plath’s 
grave is in its churchyard.

Ripponden’s Old Bridge Inn <http://www.theoldbridgeinn.co.uk/> is over 700 
years old. I’ve been there a lot and it’s a lovely pub in a nice, peaceful 
spot. And, if you’re after a great pub with rooms, I’d say go toShibden Mill Inn
 <http://www.shibdenmillinn.com/> (doubles from £125), which is a 17th-century 
property alongside Shibden Brook.

 A room at the Croft Mill Apartment Hotel, Hebden Bridge 
The first series of Happy Valley was filmed over the winter and I thought the 
countryside and the area looked fantastic. For the second series we are going 
to be filming over summer and into autumn, so it’s going to look different. It 
looks great whatever time of year it is though.

early 2016. A celebration of Yorkshire-inspired crime writing, Yorkshire Pride, 
is part of the Theakstons Old Peculier crime writing festival
