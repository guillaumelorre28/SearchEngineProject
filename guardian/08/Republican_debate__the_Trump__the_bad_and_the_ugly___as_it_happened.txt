The sixth Republican presidential debate is history. Here’s a summary of what 
we learned:

 * The debate delivered on much-touted friction between Donald Trump and Ted 
Cruz, and between Marco Rubio and Chris Christie. There was a bonus section in 
which Rubio slammed Cruz in about eight different ways, prompting this exchange:
Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) 
Cruz: "I appreciate you dumping your oppo research file on the debate stage." 
Rubio: "It's your record." Searing.

2016 <https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/687850139071807488> 
 * There were a lot of questions about how to address America’s gun violence 
epidemic, but only one answer: uphold the second amendment, arm everyone. Rubio 
and Cruz both warned that the government “could confiscate your guns.” 
 *  Trump kept up his attack on Cruz for being born in Canada and thus 
possibly ineligible to be president. Cruz said Trump was just bringing it up 
because his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. Sabrina Siddiqui

Here's that masterful Ted Cruz takedown of the birther issue:

2016 <https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/687866094221045762> 
 * After calling Barack Obama a “feckless weakling” in the last debate, 
Christie had more choice words for the president, calling him a “petulant 
child” and saying the GOP was coming to “kick your rear end out of the White 
House.” 
 * Cruz and Trump tangled over what, exactly, Cruz meant when he accused Trump 
of having “New York values.”Cruz said only New Yorkers don’t know what that 
means. Trump talked about the city’s response to 9/11. 
 * Trump and Cruz, their “bromance” over, in Trump’s estimation, also argued 
about who was polling better in Iowa.Real Clear Politics averages think it’s 
Trump, by a razor-thin .4%. 
 * When you stack all those up, the night appears to have been quite punchy. 
And we haven’t gotten to Bush, Kasich, and Carson. 
 * Bush stumbled a bit in his intro, after his wont, saying “terrorism is on 
the run,” which sounds like a good thing. He did mount a persuasive criticism 
of Trump’s call to ban Muslims from US borders, saying the thinking alienates 
regional allies in the Middle East. 
 * Kasich responsibly returned, at each opportunity, to policy specifics on 
issues ranging from community policing to the Pentagon budget to taxes. But did 
he gain traction? He seemed to be having a separate debate.

 * Carson didn’t have much to say. He called for greater national unity. He 
warned about an electromagnetic pulse attack. 
 * The candidates attacked Hillary Clinton. Rubio said the Democrat was 
“unqualified to be commander in chief because she “lied” “to those four 
families in Benghazi.”

The top search item of the night, taxes, according to Google trends, is a bit 
counterintuitive, given that there was relatively little discussion of tax 
policy, apart from general-ish calls for a reformed tax code (not counting the 
full frontal attack by Rubio on Cruz’s VAT-style tax plan):

These speaking time breakdowns are always interesting. If you thought Carson 
was retiring, you’re not wrong. There are two top tiers here: Trump-Cruz doing 
most of the talking, followed by Rubio-Christie.

The gun violence section of the evening’s debate may not have been much of a 
debate, with all the candidates voicing their unconstrained enthusiasm for gun 
rights. But at least the moderators took the time and were sufficiently 
thorough to take the issue, and the question, to every candidate onstage.

Megan Carpentier

From Guardian US opinion editor Megan Carpentier:

Well, that was two-and-a-half hours of my life I’ll never get back.

To recap: 

 * Donald Trump is still a jerk who will make America great again by making 
bombastic statements with little relationship to reality; 
 * Ted Cruz is the college debater who knows how to condescend and overexplain 
his errors until you don’t care that he made them as long as he stops talking 
and also would like you to see a movie about Benghazi instead of the 
Congressional hearings; 
 * Jeb! Bush was probably a great politicians in the 90s, for the 90s, like 
the Hootie of politicians; 
 * Ben Carson has read your comments and is praying for your eternal soul; 
 * Chris Christie thinks we can fix our bridge problems by lowering taxes 
(which isn’t a metaphor, except that it is); 
 * Marco Rubio, when properly hydrated, is kind of snarky and will definitely 
run for president again; 
 * John Kasich is still running for president this time and is polling better 
than Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, Carky Fiorina and Mike Huckabee, like it’s good 
to lead a swing state or something.  There’s only 563 more Republican debates 
to go! Or at least it feels that way.

The sixth Republican presidential debate is history. Here’s a summary of what 
we learned:

 * The debate delivered on much-touted friction between Donald Trump and Ted 
Cruz, and between Marco Rubio and Chris Christie. There was a bonus section in 
which Rubio slammed Cruz in about eight different ways, prompting this exchange:
Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) 
Cruz: "I appreciate you dumping your oppo research file on the debate stage." 
Rubio: "It's your record." Searing.
 <https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/687850139071807488> January 15, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/687850139071807488> 
 * There were a lot of questions about how to address America’s gun violence 
epidemic, but only one answer: uphold the second amendment, arm everyone. Rubio 
and Cruz both warned that the government “could confiscate your guns.” 
 *  Trump kept up his attack on Cruz for being born in Canada and thus 
possibly ineligible to be president. Cruz said Trump was just bringing it up 
because his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. Sabrina Siddiqui 
(@SabrinaSiddiqui) 
Here's that masterful Ted Cruz takedown of the birther issue:

2016 <https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/687866094221045762> 
 * After calling Barack Obama a “feckless weakling” in the last debate, 
Christie had more choice words for the president, calling him a “petulant 
child” and saying the GOP was coming to “kick your rear end out of the White 
House.” 
 * Cruz and Trump tangled over what, exactly, Cruz meant when he accused Trump 
of having “New York values.”Cruz said only New Yorkers don’t know what that 
means. Trump talked about the city’s response to 9/11. 
 * Trump and Cruz, their “bromance” over, in Trump’s estimation, also argued 
about who was polling better in Iowa.Real Clear Politics averages think it’s 
Trump, by a razor-thin .4%. 
 * When you stack all those up, the night appears to have been quite punchy. 
And we haven’t gotten to Bush, Kasich, and Carson. 
 * Bush stumbled a bit in his intro, after his wont, saying “terrorism is on 
the run,” which sounds like a good thing. He did mount a persuasive criticism 
of Trump’s call to ban Muslims from US borders, saying the thinking alienates 
regional allies in the Middle East. 
 * Kasich responsibly returned, at each opportunity, to policy specifics on 
issues ranging from community policing to the Pentagon budget to taxes. But did 
he gain traction? He seemed to be having a separate debate.

 * Carson didn’t have much to say. He called for greater national unity. He 
warned about an electromagnetic pulse attack. 
 * The candidates attacked Hillary Clinton. Rubio said the Democrat was 
“unqualified to be commander in chief because she “lied” “to those four 
families in Benghazi.”

The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs is in the spin room in North Charleston. This from 
Ben Carson <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ben-carson> is – positively 
reassuring:

When asked if his campaign was a direct mail scam, Ben Carson answered "not 
that I know of."

The top search item of the night, taxes, according to Google trends, is a bit 
counterintuitive, given that there was relatively little discussion of tax 
policy, apart from general-ish calls for a reformed tax code (not counting the 
full frontal attack by Rubio on Cruz’s VAT-style tax plan):

These speaking time breakdowns are always interesting. If you thought Carson 
was retiring, you’re not wrong. There are two top tiers here: Trump-Cruz doing 
most of the talking, followed by Rubio-Christie.

The gun violence section of the evening’s debate may not have been much of a 
debate, with all the candidates voicing their unconstrained enthusiasm for gun 
rights. But at least the moderators took the time and were sufficiently 
thorough to take the issue, and the question, to every candidate onstage.
 
Hillary Clinton is on Jimmy Fallon, coming up next! Looks fun. Looks funny. 
Good times.

From Guardian US opinion editor Megan Carpentier:

Well, that was two-and-a-half hours of my life I’ll never get back.

To recap: 

 * Donald Trump is still a jerk who will make America great again by making 
bombastic statements with little relationship to reality; 
 * Ted Cruz is the college debater who knows how to condescend and overexplain 
his errors until you don’t care that he made them as long as he stops talking 
and also would like you to see a movie about Benghazi instead of the 
Congressional hearings; 
 * Jeb! Bush was probably a great politicians in the 90s, for the 90s, like 
the Hootie of politicians; 
 * Ben Carson has read your comments and is praying for your eternal soul; 
 * Chris Christie thinks we can fix our bridge problems by lowering taxes 
(which isn’t a metaphor, except that it is); 
 * Marco Rubio, when properly hydrated, is kind of snarky and will definitely 
run for president again; 
 * John Kasich is still running for president this time and is polling better 
than Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, Carky Fiorina and Mike Huckabee, like it’s good 
to lead a swing state or something.  There’s only 563 more Republican debates 
to go! Or at least it feels that way.  Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui)
