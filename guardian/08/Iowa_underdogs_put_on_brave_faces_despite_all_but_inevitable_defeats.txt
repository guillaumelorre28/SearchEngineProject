Iowa caucus: candidates offer last pitch as America (finally) prepares to vote

On the final weekend before the Iowa caucuses, the presidential candidates 
straggling behind the leaders – Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio for the
Republicans <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans>, Hillary Clinton 
and Bernie Sanders for the Democrats – carried on with brave faces, despite 
sinking poll numbers and ambivalent voters.

Underdog candidates could, however, have an outsize effect on the campaign: 
their supporters represent the spread between the leaders. Sway voters who 
prefer a third- (or fourth- or fifth-) tier contender could bring another 
candidate closer to the nomination.

For example supporters of the third Democratic candidate, Martin O’Malley, 
polling at 3% in Iowacould ultimately sway the race 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/us/politics/clinton-sanders-omalley-iowa-caucuses.html>
 on Monday.

According to caucus rules, a candidate must have support from 15% of 
caucus-goers in any given precinct to reach “viability”. If too few voters 
support a candidate, they are free to support another. Both the Clinton and 
Sanders camps have sought to win over O’Malley backers.

Nonetheless, on Saturday in Boone, Iowa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/iowa>, the former governor of Maryland 
told supporters not to waver.

“Hold strong in that first alignment,” he said. “We have to beat expectations. 
I’m hoping and working to make my campaign the surprise that comes out of Iowa.”

Touring the state he won eight years ago, meanwhile, Republican Mike Huckabee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mikehuckabee> projected the aura of a 
tired heritage act as he spoke to Iowans in small-town clubs and bars.

One part preacher to two parts standup guy, the former Arkansas governor 
charmed the room at the Inspired Grounds coffee shop in West Des Moines. But 
after visiting all 99 counties these past eight months, he is nowhere in the 
polls.

“I’m going to be glad,” he told the gathering, “when we finally actually base 
this whole election on votes rather than some east coast pollster who has never 
spent a night in Iowa, and doesn’t have a clue about voters who are going to be 
going to the caucuses.”

In the age of Instagram and viral videos, Huckabee spoke up for “the 
old-fashioned way” of electioneering. “Hard work and handshakes”, he said are 
the real way to pass your audition for a job at the White House.

There was no policy pitch, except for a moment to hymn the value of lawmaking 
experience and warn of the danger of appointing as president another untried 
freshman senator – a swipe at Ted Cruz,Marco Rubio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> and Rand Paul.

Outside, Gary Leffler, a resident and Huckabee supporter, said the former 
governor is “a man of faith, a man of God”, and that “you have to vote on 
principle and I’m a principled man”.

Asked about the long odds of his preferred candidate, Leffler said he would at 
least vote Republican no matter what.

Huckabee’s rival Ben Carson <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ben-carson>, 
a retired neurosurgeon whose support in the state peaked at 25% but has now 
dropped to 10%, pledged to voters that he would defy the odds.

“We’re seeing a lot of movement on the ground, there’s a lot of shifting going 
on right now,” Carson told the Detroit News on Friday, in south-east Iowa.

“It almost feels like an earthquake. And I think a lot of it is shifting in 
our favor. So we’re actually looking forward to a very good night, which would 
be quite surprising, I think, to a lot of pundits.”

Another one-time frontrunner, former Florida governor Jeb Bush 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeb-bush>, has seen his numbers steadily 
decline to the point that he found 2% support in the Register poll – 
neck-and-neck with “undecided”.

In recent days Bush has traveled with his wife Columba and daughter Noelle. 
Next month, they will be joined in New Hampshire by their four grandchildren 
and former president George W Bush.

In Sioux City, he told reporters: “This is a family deal, especially when you 
get to the beginning of the end.”

Chris Christie <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chris-christie>, the 
governor of New Jersey, made the rounds in Iowa, with a stop at the Chrome 
Horse Saloon in Cedar Rapids. “When you see me in a place like this,” he told 
the crowd, “I become smarter and more charming and better looking and funny. By 
the time you walk out of here, you are going to be, ‘Damn, man, that guy should 
be emperor.’”

Christie, the Financial Times reported, cautioned the crowd against supporting 
Trump, the Republican frontrunner. “Showtime is over,” he said. “We are not 
electing the entertainer-in-chief, everybody … we are electing the 
commander-in-chief. This isn’t a game. This isn’t a TV show. This is the real 
world.”

Carly Fiorina <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/carly-fiorina>, too, has 
walked a long road in Iowa, pushing her program to “take our government back”. 
In Mason City, USA Today reported, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO tried to 
explain her concept of zero-based budgeting.

“It means you can examine any dollar, you can cut any dollar and you can move 
any dollar. All the government does now is discuss the rate of increase.”

Senator Rand Paul, too, predicted he will surprise in Monday’s caucus, arguing 
that polls are skewed toward older voters, not theyounger voters who rally to 
his pro-liberty positions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/31/rand-paul-iowa-caucus-college-students>
.

He told NBC on Sunday that his campaign has called “a million” Iowans: “I 
think we’ve called them so much we know them by name by now.”

And Ohio governor John Kasich, recently endorsed by the New York Times as 
their editorial board’s Republican of choice, gave up on Iowa almost 
completely. He campaigned in New Hampshire, accompanied by a guitarist, and 
said he was “thrilled” by the newspaper’s endorsement.

“It really illustrates for a lot of people that Kasich’s a conservative but he 
has wide appeal,” Kasich told reporters. “He can get people to come who 
traditionally don’t go. And the last guy I can think of who could do that is 
Ronald Reagan.”
