The open question of how Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> will govern is being filled 
in with names of men – and five women, as of early January – floated for 
inclusion in his cabinet and for cabinet-level posts. Trump’s picks reveal a 
penchant for military brass, political outsiders, Wall Street titans and ... 
white men. The picks do not betray a particular faith in the value of prior 
government experience. Here’s the list so far:

the Obama administration. Has called for a “new security architecture for the 
Mideast built on sound policy … Iran is a special case that must be dealt with 
as a threat to regional stability, nuclear and otherwise”. Only three years out 
of active duty, would require a congressional waiver of a federal law requiring 
a seven-year cooling off period for defense. Nicknamed “Mad Dog”.Read further

economy” and recommended “a much more aggressive approach in dealing with 
China”. “Bob Lighthizer is very smart, very strategic and totally fearless,” a 
Washington attorney who has worked with him for three decades but asked not to
