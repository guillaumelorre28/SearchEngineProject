Afternoon summary

 * The high court has said it will rule on Thursday whether or not Labour’s 
national executive committee was entitled to fight the leadership contest 
without getting nominations from MPs like his challenger. 
 * John Bercow, the Commons speaker, has told Labour MP Seema Malhotra that 
alleged unauthorised entry into her office 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/23/jeremy-corbyn-aide-accused-illegal-entry-mps-office>
 does not amount to a possible breach of parliamentary rules. 
Alleged violation of Labour MP's office by Corbyn aide 'not a breach'

 * Owen Smith, who is challenging Corbyn for the Labour leadership, has 
accused Corbyn of being like Tony Blair in failing to deliver radical policies.
Speaking on the Radio 2 Jeremy Vine Show Smith said that he was “massively to 
the left” of Blair. He said: 
Crucially, I think we need to be less timid, as we speak. I think Jeremy and 
Tony have got something in common in that respect; neither of them has been 
very forthright when it comes to really radical policies to change things.

I think Jeremy has shared some of the traits of New Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> in that he’s not been bold 
enough. We have not put pen to paper on policy in almost any area in the last 
nine months.

Persuading Labour members that Corbyn is similar to Blair will be quite a hard 
sell, to put it mildly, but Smith’s argument about Corbyn not developing policy 
is much better founded.Richard Murphy, the tax campaigner, who last year was an 
enthusiastic Corbyn supporter, cited this as one reason why he has lost faith 
in Corbynin a blog last week. 
<http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2016/07/17/the-rise-and-fall-of-corbyns-economics/>
 “I had the opportunity to see what was happening inside the PLP,” he wrote. 
“The leadership wasn’t confusing as much as just silent. There was no policy 
direction, no messaging, no direction, no co-ordination, no nothing.”

 * London and Dublin are agreed there will be no return to a “hard border” 
between Northern Ireland and the Republic, Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny insisted 
after Downing Street talks. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Here is a Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leadership 
contest reading list.

 * David Wearing at the Guardian says it is obvious why Jeremy Corbyn is so 
popular with Labour members. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/26/labour-battle-blairites-corbynistas-conservatives-progressives>
Jeremy Corbyn’s support unites around clear basic principles: the need to 
break decisively with neoliberalism, in favour of a new egalitarian economic 
model, and to defend migrants, minority-ethnic people and those on social 
security from the rising tide of bigotry and the effects of spending cuts.

Conspiracy theories about mass Trotskyist entryism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/10/corbyn-led-labour-might-turn-into-1980s-trotskyist-tribute-act-says-cruddas>
, while (unintentionally) entertaining, are of little help in explaining the 
huge and enduring support for Corbyn among Labour’s ballooning membership. The 
real reasons are simple enough – Corbyn represents a head-on challenge to a 
status quo that a broad swath of left-progressive opinion now considers 
intolerable. No analytical genius is required to identify his limitations as a 
leader. The problem is the lack of any credible candidate to carry forward that 
challenge in his place.

 * Anthony Painter on a medium blog looks at how Owen Smith could win. 
<https://medium.com/@anthonypainter/can-owen-smith-win-163522e2e81b#.37mezsqg1> 
Smith has pulled off a smart early manoeuvre- one that allows him to 
concentrate on the party core. By hinting at favouring a confirmatory 
referendum on the Brexit deal, he’s appealed to the party’s right. That gives 
him freedom to play for the party’s left. And that is how, ultimately, he can 
win this election (with my three assumptions in place….).

His current argument is that he is a more competent version of Jeremy Corbyn. 
Undoubtedly, that is true on the basis that it is nigh-on impossible to be less 
competent. But the ‘I’m a competent version of Jeremy’ relies on the fact that 
enough of Jeremy Corbyn’s support is driven by ‘competence’ as a virtue. I 
don’t think it’s too controversial to suggest that the very fact they are 
backingJeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> 
suggests that competence in the parliamentary or electoral domains are not 
their most important concern. Moreover, if he is to win this election has to be 
more about Smith and less about Corbyn. Currently, that is the mistake that a 
lot of Labour moderates are making. The road to victory is in Smith convincing- 
views on Corbyn are already polarised.

Therefore, Smith has to demonstrate some big, idealistic thinking to make his 
leftwards pitch and that he is authentically left-wing.

 * Helen Lewis at the New Statesman says Facebook is essential to Corbyn’s 
success. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/07/how-jeremy-corbyn-won-facebook>
Thanks to Facebook and the campaign group Momentum, personal supporters of 
Corbyn have flooded into Labour. His Facebook page has 250,000 more Likes than 
the Labour Party page, which recently passed the half-million mark. (Angela 
Eagle’s page has around 18,900 andOwen Smith’s 6,600 
<https://www.facebook.com/owensmithmp/?fref=ts>.) It is a measure of Corbyn’s 
online success that theYouGov data on the upcoming leadership election suggests 
<https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/755350736964386816> that he would lose 
if the selectorate were the same as it was last summer, because of the 
disillusionment of long-standing members. However, he has reshaped the party in 
his own image, and it now has a pro-Corbyn majority.

Owen Smith, the Labour leadership contender, was on Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine show 
at lunchtime. He said he was “massively to the left of Tony Blair” and that he 
was “as leftwing” asJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>.

He also said the party was “heading in the right direction” under Corbyn. 

I have got members of my own party in Pontypridd who have joined because they 
think the party is heading in the right direction, and I agree with them.

A spokesman for Smith later clarified this remark. Smith meant that, under 
Corbyn, the party was reconnecting with people, the spokesman said. But Smith 
did not think Corbyn was the right person to lead the party forward, the 
spokesman went on.

Here is more from the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
leadership rules case in the high court.

Gavin Millar qc disputes that his client wants to 'exclude' Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> - he would simply need MPs 
nominations

1/2 & Gavin Millar argues once a challenge has been successfully triggered 
then nomination requirements can't apply only to the challenger

The consequence of the rules requiring nominations isn't a concern of the 
rules says Millar

In other words if JC fails to get nominations it's a political decision not a 
result of the rules - fairness requires rules equally applied

stresses involvement of MPs in nominations

500 Labour councillors back Owen Smith

More than 500 Labour councillors have signed a joint letter saying they are 
backingOwen Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith> for the 
Labour leadership.

The initiative was organised by Gedling councillor Michael Payne and 
Westminster councillorTim Roca. Explaining why they were backing Smith, they 
said:

Across the country, Labour councillors are making a real difference for 
working people and the most vulnerable. They are on the frontline against Tory 
austerity, and know the effect it has on the people who need a Labour 
government most. Councillors speak to real voters every day, and understand 
that winning a general election withJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> as leader will be nearly 
impossible.

Here is an extract from the letter.

Owen has convincingly made the case that he knows how to get things done and 
has the tenacity and skill to advance the cause of working people. He has not 
shied away from saying our Party has been too timid and that he would increase 
taxes on the wealthy. He has set out a radical vision for a £200bn investment 
programme, re-nationalising our railways and putting the decision to make war 
firmly in the hands of elected MPs, not the Government of the day.

But there is more at stake here. There are militants in both wings of our 
Party who are determined to carry out a civil war against each other, whether 
it harms working people or not. We have intimidation and bullying in 
constituencyLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> parties up and 
down the country. We have those who seem to prefer perpetual division to the 
job of winning power for the good of those we represent. We need a unifying 
leader who is principled and competent.


The full text of the letter, and the names of all the signatories, are here, 
on LabourList.

Sadiq Khan, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> mayor of 
London, has stepped up his campaign to get more powers by inviting a commission 
to come up with new devolution proposals for the capital.

In 2013, when Boris Johnson was mayor, a London finance commission,  
<https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/business-and-economy/promoting-london/london-finance-commission>
chaired by Prof Tony Travers, came up with plans to give the mayor direct 
control of the money raised by certain property taxes in the city.

The proposals did not get implemented, but Khan has asked Travers to reconvene 
the commission and to report back “with a more comprehensive, wide-ranging 
suite of devolution requests that will be presented to ministers”.

Khan said:

London needs a stronger voice so that we can protect jobs and growth from the 
economic uncertainty ahead.

It is vital that we have greater control over how the capital is run – so we 
have more control over the things we need to improve our city such as skills 
training, housing, business rates and the tools to tackle air quality, health 
and crime.

London’s population is the same size of Wales and Scotland combined, but we 
have far less control over how the capital is run.

A stronger voice for London will be good for the whole country, because when 
London succeeds, Britain succeeds.

Theresa May and her Irish opposite number, Enda Kenny, have finished their 
talks in Number 10. They spoke briefly to the media afterwards. Here are the 
key points.

 * May said she wanted the UK to maintain “the closest possible relationship” 
with Ireland after Brexit. 
 * May and Kenny both said they were determined to maintain free travel across 
the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. May said there 
was “a strong will” to keep this. She said: 
I recognise that one of the biggest concerns for people is the common travel 
area. As I said yesterday, we benefited from a common travel area between the 
UK and the Republic of Ireland for many years before either country was a 
member of the EU. There is a strong will on both sides to preserve it and so we 
must now focus on securing a deal that is in the interests of both of us.

Alongside this, we should continue our efforts to strengthen the external 
borders of the common travel area; for example, through a common approach to 
the use of passenger data.

And Kenny said:

We both recognised that Ireland is the only EU member state that shares a land 
border with the UK. We are in agreement that we don’t wish to see any return to 
the borders of the past on the island of Ireland.

 * May and Kenny both said they would not let Brexit undermine the peace 
process.May said: 
It is in all our interests to work together to safeguard our national security 
and the outcome of the referendum will not undermine it.

And Kenny said:

We agreed that we would work together to ensure that the benefits of the peace 
process are preserved in any new arrangements which might emerge regarding the 
United Kingdom’s future relationship with the EU.

 * May said she and Kenny had agreed that Britain and Ireland must “take time” 
to find practical solutions to a number of “complex issues” arising from the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU.  Theresa May and Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny

 * Suzanne Evans, Ukip’s former deputy chairman, has backed a little-known 
councillor who admits that she is not “politically minded”, to succeed Nigel 
Farage as leader.As the Press Association reports, Evans, who is temporarily 
suspended from the party, said she has “given up hope” of taking the party’s 
top job as she endorsedLisa Duffy. Admitting that her chosen contender is “not 
a household name”, Evans claimed the Huntingdonshire councillor would help the 
party move away from its “one-man band image” and make a “clean break with the 
past”. Duffy, the chief of staff for the Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn, is a former 
party director who was involved in election organisation. The former TK Maxx 
store manager insisted she is “not a nobody”, but denied being ambitious and 
said she is not “politically minded”. 
 * MPs have called for an investigation into the war in Yemen after the 
government backtracked on its insistence that the Saudi-led coalition has not 
breached international humanitarian law in the conflict. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/21/foreign-office-retracts-statements-to-mps-on-saudi-campaign-in-yemen>
 Stephen Twigg, the chairman of the international development committee, has 
written to the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urging him to push for an 
international investigation into allegations that human rights have been 
breached. Twigg wrote: 
Last week’s corrections are a significant revision of the evidence the 
government has given to my committee and to parliament and call into question 
the depth of the UK government’s specific assessments of Saudi operations or of 
the evidence heard by my committee on alleged violations of IHL [international 
humanitarian law]. I appeal to you to take a different approach from your 
predecessor, and to now press for a truly independent, international 
investigation into violations of IHL in Yemen.

I have asked several members of Jeremy Corbyn’s team this morning for a 
response to what Owen Smith said about Corbyn’s patriotism (see 8.47am)

but they haven’t responded.

But the social media activist LabourEoin has been on the case defending Corbyn.

Here are two Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leadership 
articles from today’s papers that are worth a look.

 * Oliver Wright in the Times (paywall) says Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of 
London, has decided not to endorse Owen Smith in the leadership contest, as 
Smith’s campaign faces criticism from senior party figures. 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mayor-refuses-to-support-corbyn-rival-0qk9rdwvt>
Senior moderate MPs have privately expressed disillusionment with Mr Smith’s 
early performances in the leadership race. They point to his faltering 
responses to questions about his past role as a lobbyist for Pfizer, the 
pharmaceutical giant, and his “bizarre” offer to make Mr Corbyn president of 
the party.

“I suppose we’ve got to take a deep breath, hold our nose and back him,” one 
said. “But from what I’ve seen so far the idea that Owen can beat Jeremy seems 
fanciful. It’s a mess.”

Another added: “We’ve not exactly got Rocky in the ring.”

One Labour MP who backed Mr Smith over Angela Eagle in the contest to take on 
Mr Corbyn said that he now put his chances of success at “less than 1 per cent”.

“I’m disappointed. I expected when he won he would set out a distinct policy 
platform straightaway but I’ve heard little of substance so far.”

 * Janan Ganesh in the Financial Times (subscription) says Labour’s soft left 
cannot escape the blame for the party’s plight.

Labour’s soft left retains a spurious credibility because it fended off 
Militant entryists in the 1980s. Judged on its recent record, it has become a 
disaster for the party, choosing Ed Miliband over his brother David in 2010, 
opening the membership to sundry hotheads from other movements and, in no small 
number, joining them in the Jeremania of 2015. Even now their idea of a 
solution isOwen Smith 
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8c32fb02-4cfa-11e6-8172-e39ecd3b86fc.html#axzz4FParmJsm>
, a more elegant vessel for the politics of Mr Miliband. Those of us who see a 
formal split as Labour’s least bad recourse against Mr Corbyn must reckon with 
the breakaway party being dominated by these well-meaning klutzes.

Unrepentant supporters of Mr Corbyn at least know their own minds ...

Next to this, Corbynites with buyer’s remorse are a study in confusion. Like 
those free-marketeers who vote to leave the EU and now blanch at mooted curbs 
on migration, they cannot believe their succour for brute ideologues has led to 
power for brute ideologues. They have a good line against unelectable socialism 
— that it betrays the people it is meant to serve — but the implication, which 
is that Labour must be led by a plausible winner, and therefore someone more 
centrist than they would like, is lost on them. Nobody to the left of Tony 
Blair has won an election since 1974.

11.58am BST 11:58  <> 

Suzanne Evans, the former deputy chairman of Ukip, has announced that she has 
given up hope of standing for the party’s leadership. She is currently 
suspended from the party, and used a news conference this morning to say she 
now accepted that there was no chance of being reinstated in time to allow her 
to stand.

She criticised the way she has been treated by the party, but she she would 
not be leaving it.

I have to face up to reality. There’s no way they are going to allow me to put 
my name on the ballot paper.

So first I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to all those Ukip members 
who backed me to the hilt. I have been overwhelmed and deeply humbled by the 
faith you have shown in me. And so I’m very sorry to have to tell you I have 
now given up hope of becoming the next leader of Ukip.

Naturally I have questioned whether I should stay in a party that allows and 
arguable encourages senior figures to behave like this, but the support I’ve 
received from so many good, decent honest members, as shocked as I am at the 
way I have been treated, has made me more determined than ever not to give up 
on Ukip.

Evans was suspended earlier this year following accusations of disloyalty.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/23/ukip-suzanne-evans-suspended-disloyalty-nigel-farage>
She has been critical of Nigel Farage, the outgoing leader, and she is an ally 
of Douglas Carswell, the sole Ukip MP who relationship with Farage is 
particularly fractious.

 * Owen Smith, who is challenging Corbyn for the Labour leadership, has 
accused Corbyn of being like Tony Blair in failing to deliver radical policies.
Speaking on the Radio 2 Jeremy Vine Show Smith said that he was “massively to 
the left” of Blair. He said: 
Crucially, I think we need to be less timid, as we speak. I think Jeremy and 
Tony have got something in common in that respect; neither of them has been 
very forthright when it comes to really radical policies to change things.

I think Jeremy has shared some of the traits of New Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> in that he’s not been bold 
enough. We have not put pen to paper on policy in almost any area in the last 
nine months.

Persuading Labour members that Corbyn is similar to Blair will be quite a hard 
sell, to put it mildly, but Smith’s argument about Corbyn not developing policy 
is much better founded.Richard Murphy, the tax campaigner, who last year was an 
enthusiastic Corbyn supporter, cited this as one reason why he has lost faith 
in Corbynin a blog last week. 
<http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2016/07/17/the-rise-and-fall-of-corbyns-economics/>
 “I had the opportunity to see what was happening inside the PLP,” he wrote. 
“The leadership wasn’t confusing as much as just silent. There was no policy 
direction, no messaging, no direction, no co-ordination, no nothing.”

 * London and Dublin are agreed there will be no return to a “hard border” 
between Northern Ireland and the Republic, Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny insisted 
after Downing Street talks. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Here is a Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leadership 
contest reading list.

 * David Wearing at the Guardian says it is obvious why Jeremy Corbyn is so 
popular with Labour members. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/26/labour-battle-blairites-corbynistas-conservatives-progressives>
Jeremy Corbyn’s support unites around clear basic principles: the need to 
break decisively with neoliberalism, in favour of a new egalitarian economic 
model, and to defend migrants, minority-ethnic people and those on social 
security from the rising tide of bigotry and the effects of spending cuts.

Conspiracy theories about mass Trotskyist entryism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/10/corbyn-led-labour-might-turn-into-1980s-trotskyist-tribute-act-says-cruddas>
, while (unintentionally) entertaining, are of little help in explaining the 
huge and enduring support for Corbyn among Labour’s ballooning membership. The 
real reasons are simple enough – Corbyn represents a head-on challenge to a 
status quo that a broad swath of left-progressive opinion now considers 
intolerable. No analytical genius is required to identify his limitations as a 
leader. The problem is the lack of any credible candidate to carry forward that 
challenge in his place.

 * Anthony Painter on a medium blog looks at how Owen Smith could win. 
<https://medium.com/@anthonypainter/can-owen-smith-win-163522e2e81b#.37mezsqg1> 
Smith has pulled off a smart early manoeuvre- one that allows him to 
concentrate on the party core. By hinting at favouring a confirmatory 
referendum on the Brexit deal, he’s appealed to the party’s right. That gives 
him freedom to play for the party’s left. And that is how, ultimately, he can 
win this election (with my three assumptions in place….).

His current argument is that he is a more competent version of Jeremy Corbyn. 
Undoubtedly, that is true on the basis that it is nigh-on impossible to be less 
competent. But the ‘I’m a competent version of Jeremy’ relies on the fact that 
enough of Jeremy Corbyn’s support is driven by ‘competence’ as a virtue. I 
don’t think it’s too controversial to suggest that the very fact they are 
backingJeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> 
suggests that competence in the parliamentary or electoral domains are not 
their most important concern. Moreover, if he is to win this election has to be 
more about Smith and less about Corbyn. Currently, that is the mistake that a 
lot of Labour moderates are making. The road to victory is in Smith convincing- 
views on Corbyn are already polarised.

Therefore, Smith has to demonstrate some big, idealistic thinking to make his 
leftwards pitch and that he is authentically left-wing.

 * Helen Lewis at the New Statesman says Facebook is essential to Corbyn’s 
success. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/07/how-jeremy-corbyn-won-facebook>
Thanks to Facebook and the campaign group Momentum, personal supporters of 
Corbyn have flooded into Labour. His Facebook page has 250,000 more Likes than 
the Labour Party page, which recently passed the half-million mark. (Angela 
Eagle’s page has around 18,900 andOwen Smith’s 6,600 
<https://www.facebook.com/owensmithmp/?fref=ts>.) It is a measure of Corbyn’s 
online success that theYouGov data on the upcoming leadership election suggests 
<https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/755350736964386816> that he would lose 
if the selectorate were the same as it was last summer, because of the 
disillusionment of long-standing members. However, he has reshaped the party in 
his own image, and it now has a pro-Corbyn majority.

Owen Smith, the Labour leadership contender, was on Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine show 
at lunchtime. He said he was “massively to the left of Tony Blair” and that he 
was “as leftwing” asJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>.

He also said the party was “heading in the right direction” under Corbyn. 

I have got members of my own party in Pontypridd who have joined because they 
think the party is heading in the right direction, and I agree with them.

A spokesman for Smith later clarified this remark. Smith meant that, under 
Corbyn, the party was reconnecting with people, the spokesman said. But Smith 
did not think Corbyn was the right person to lead the party forward, the 
spokesman went on.

More than 500 Labour councillors have signed a joint letter saying they are 
backingOwen Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith> for the 
Labour leadership.

The initiative was organised by Gedling councillor Michael Payne and 
Westminster councillorTim Roca. Explaining why they were backing Smith, they 
said:

Across the country, Labour councillors are making a real difference for 
working people and the most vulnerable. They are on the frontline against Tory 
austerity, and know the effect it has on the people who need a Labour 
government most. Councillors speak to real voters every day, and understand 
that winning a general election withJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> as leader will be nearly 
impossible.

Here is an extract from the letter.

Owen has convincingly made the case that he knows how to get things done and 
has the tenacity and skill to advance the cause of working people. He has not 
shied away from saying our Party has been too timid and that he would increase 
taxes on the wealthy. He has set out a radical vision for a £200bn investment 
programme, re-nationalising our railways and putting the decision to make war 
firmly in the hands of elected MPs, not the Government of the day.

But there is more at stake here. There are militants in both wings of our 
Party who are determined to carry out a civil war against each other, whether 
it harms working people or not. We have intimidation and bullying in 
constituencyLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> parties up and 
down the country. We have those who seem to prefer perpetual division to the 
job of winning power for the good of those we represent. We need a unifying 
leader who is principled and competent.

Sadiq Khan, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> mayor of 
London, has stepped up his campaign to get more powers by inviting a commission 
to come up with new devolution proposals for the capital.

In 2013, when Boris Johnson was mayor, a London finance commission,  
<https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/business-and-economy/promoting-london/london-finance-commission>
chaired by Prof Tony Travers, came up with plans to give the mayor direct 
control of the money raised by certain property taxes in the city.

The proposals did not get implemented, but Khan has asked Travers to reconvene 
the commission and to report back “with a more comprehensive, wide-ranging 
suite of devolution requests that will be presented to ministers”.

Khan said:

London needs a stronger voice so that we can protect jobs and growth from the 
economic uncertainty ahead.

It is vital that we have greater control over how the capital is run – so we 
have more control over the things we need to improve our city such as skills 
training, housing, business rates and the tools to tackle air quality, health 
and crime.

London’s population is the same size of Wales and Scotland combined, but we 
have far less control over how the capital is run.

A stronger voice for London will be good for the whole country, because when 
London succeeds, Britain succeeds.

Theresa May and her Irish opposite number, Enda Kenny, have finished their 
talks in Number 10. They spoke briefly to the media afterwards. Here are the 
key points.

 * May said she wanted the UK to maintain “the closest possible relationship” 
with Ireland after Brexit. 
 * May and Kenny both said they were determined to maintain free travel across 
the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. May said there 
was “a strong will” to keep this. She said: 
I recognise that one of the biggest concerns for people is the common travel 
area. As I said yesterday, we benefited from a common travel area between the 
UK and the Republic of Ireland for many years before either country was a 
member of the EU. There is a strong will on both sides to preserve it and so we 
must now focus on securing a deal that is in the interests of both of us.

Alongside this, we should continue our efforts to strengthen the external 
borders of the common travel area; for example, through a common approach to 
the use of passenger data.

And Kenny said:

We both recognised that Ireland is the only EU member state that shares a land 
border with the UK. We are in agreement that we don’t wish to see any return to 
the borders of the past on the island of Ireland.

 * May and Kenny both said they would not let Brexit undermine the peace 
process.May said: 
It is in all our interests to work together to safeguard our national security 
and the outcome of the referendum will not undermine it.

And Kenny said:

We agreed that we would work together to ensure that the benefits of the peace 
process are preserved in any new arrangements which might emerge regarding the 
United Kingdom’s future relationship with the EU.

 * May said she and Kenny had agreed that Britain and Ireland must “take time” 
to find practical solutions to a number of “complex issues” arising from the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU.  Theresa May and Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny

party move away from its “one-man band image” and make a “clean break with the 
past”. Duffy, the chief of staff for the Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn, is a former

the evidence heard by my committee on alleged violations of IHL [international 
humanitarian law]. I appeal to you to take a different approach from your 
predecessor, and to now press for a truly independent, international 
investigation into violations of IHL in Yemen.

Here are two Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leadership 
articles from today’s papers that are worth a look.

 * Oliver Wright in the Times (paywall) says Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of 
London, has decided not to endorse Owen Smith in the leadership contest, as 
Smith’s campaign faces criticism from senior party figures. 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mayor-refuses-to-support-corbyn-rival-0qk9rdwvt>
Senior moderate MPs have privately expressed disillusionment with Mr Smith’s 
early performances in the leadership race. They point to his faltering 
responses to questions about his past role as a lobbyist for Pfizer, the 
pharmaceutical giant, and his “bizarre” offer to make Mr Corbyn president of 
the party.

“I suppose we’ve got to take a deep breath, hold our nose and back him,” one 
said. “But from what I’ve seen so far the idea that Owen can beat Jeremy seems 
fanciful. It’s a mess.”

Another added: “We’ve not exactly got Rocky in the ring.”

One Labour MP who backed Mr Smith over Angela Eagle in the contest to take on 
Mr Corbyn said that he now put his chances of success at “less than 1 per cent”.

“I’m disappointed. I expected when he won he would set out a distinct policy 
platform straightaway but I’ve heard little of substance so far.”

 * Janan Ganesh in the Financial Times (subscription) says Labour’s soft left 
cannot escape the blame for the party’s plight.

Labour’s soft left retains a spurious credibility because it fended off 
Militant entryists in the 1980s. Judged on its recent record, it has become a 
disaster for the party, choosing Ed Miliband over his brother David in 2010, 
opening the membership to sundry hotheads from other movements and, in no small 
number, joining them in the Jeremania of 2015. Even now their idea of a 
solution isOwen Smith 
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8c32fb02-4cfa-11e6-8172-e39ecd3b86fc.html#axzz4FParmJsm>
, a more elegant vessel for the politics of Mr Miliband. Those of us who see a 
formal split as Labour’s least bad recourse against Mr Corbyn must reckon with 
the breakaway party being dominated by these well-meaning klutzes.

Unrepentant supporters of Mr Corbyn at least know their own minds ...

Next to this, Corbynites with buyer’s remorse are a study in confusion. Like 
those free-marketeers who vote to leave the EU and now blanch at mooted curbs 
on migration, they cannot believe their succour for brute ideologues has led to 
power for brute ideologues. They have a good line against unelectable socialism 
— that it betrays the people it is meant to serve — but the implication, which 
is that Labour must be led by a plausible winner, and therefore someone more 
centrist than they would like, is lost on them. Nobody to the left of Tony 
Blair has won an election since 1974.
 
ICM has released a poll today giving the Tories a 16-point lead over Labour.

Suzanne Evans, the former deputy chairman of Ukip, has announced that she has 
given up hope of standing for the party’s leadership. She is currently 
suspended from the party, and used a news conference this morning to say she 
now accepted that there was no chance of being reinstated in time to allow her 
to stand.

She criticised the way she has been treated by the party, but she she would 
not be leaving it.

I have to face up to reality. There’s no way they are going to allow me to put 
my name on the ballot paper.

So first I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to all those Ukip members 
who backed me to the hilt. I have been overwhelmed and deeply humbled by the 
faith you have shown in me. And so I’m very sorry to have to tell you I have 
now given up hope of becoming the next leader of Ukip.

Naturally I have questioned whether I should stay in a party that allows and 
arguable encourages senior figures to behave like this, but the support I’ve 
received from so many good, decent honest members, as shocked as I am at the 
way I have been treated, has made me more determined than ever not to give up 
on Ukip.

Evans was suspended earlier this year following accusations of disloyalty.

She has been critical of Nigel Farage, the outgoing leader, and she is an ally 
of Douglas Carswell, the sole Ukip MP who relationship with Farage is 
particularly fractious.
