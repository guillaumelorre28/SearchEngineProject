Summary

The fifth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 cycle is in the can. 
Here’s what we learned:

 * It was long on substance. Candidates were asked about national security 
issues, immigration policy, government surveillance and naughty things the 
candidates have said about each other on the campaign trail. 
 * Florida senator Marco Rubio and Texas senator Ted Cruz locked horns over 
Rubio’s support for immigration reform and Cruz’s support for reining in NSA 
surveillance. Both fought expertly. No clear winner declared. 
 * Donald Trump said he had no plan to run as a third-party candidate. “I am 
totally committed to the Republican party,” Trump said. 
 * Former Florida governor Jeb Bush repeatedly attacked Donald Trump, calling 
him the “chaos candidate” and saying “You’re not going to insult your way to 
president of the United States.” 
 * Was it such a fight-y night? Not really – neither Cruz nor Rubio, nor New 
Jersey governor Chris Christie, opted to tangle with Trump, who himself passed 
on an invitation to hit Cruz. 
 * Christie did, however, call president Obama a “feckless weakling.” 
 * Did Trump botch a question about the country’s triad of nuclear defenses, 
sub-plan-silo? He didn’t answer a Q about which needed updating most urgently.

 * Rubio left the door open on a path to citizenship for some undocumented 
migrants, a heresy in some corners of the party. “I personally am open to 
people having the possibility of applying for a green card,” he said – after 10 
years’ probation and strict tests. 
 * Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator, did go after Trump, who he said wanted to 
shred the constitution. Trump pretty much ignored him. 
 * A substantive big-picture debate broke out over whether it’s better for the 
US national security to have dictators in the Middle East. Also unresolved. 
 * Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina quoted Thatcher: “Margaret 
Thatcher once said, if you want something talked about, ask a man. If you want 
something done, ask a woman.”

And here’s our full report from Sabrina Siddiqui and Paul Lewis on the ground

Like the first, not one word about income inequality, climate change, or racial 
justice. The Rs are out of touch.

Closing statements

Paul: The greatest threat to national security is our debt. It’s both parties’ 
fault. [Cough] We are not a stronger nation if we go further into debt. I’m the 
only one on this stage who will hold the line on spending. [Rabid cheers]

Kasich: You have to win Ohio to win the White House if you are a Republican. 
The people of Ohio are the people of America. Connect with heads and hearts. We 
will beat Hillary Clinton. [some applause]

Christie: I lost touch with my wife and brother for six hours on 9/11 and many 
friends and neighbors were killed. Terrorism is real. I have already protected 
the country. I want the chance to do it again. I will protect America. [generic 
applause]

Fiorina: I remember 9/11 too. We had to put in place security measures around 
the world. We have to begin by beating Hillary Clinton. We need to unify our 
party. We need to beat Hillary Clinton. I can.

Bush: Ask yourself: Which candidate will keep you and the country safer, 
stronger, freer. I have a proven record as governor. I don’t make false 
promises. Keep America safe. Vote Bush. [some applause]

Rubio: This is the most important election in a generation. But millions of 
Americans feel left behind. This election is about restored economic vibrancy. 
Rebuild the military. New American century Vote Rubio. [applause and some 
whistles but the crowd just sounds tired]

Cruz: America can win again and we will win again. Ronald Reagan was awesome. 
I will be too. Cutting taxes. Stronger military. Simple strategy: We win, they 
loose. [passing applause]

Carson: I’ve been to 58 countries. USA is #1. Mother said if I work hard 
anything is possible. I believe it’s true. Political correctness bad. 
[applause-ish]

Trump: Our country doesn’t win anymore. Military, trade, Isis, vets, health 
care. Nothing works in our country. If I’m elected president we will win again 
and we’re going to have a great great country greater than ever before.

Trump: 'I am totally committed to the Republican party'

Trump is asked whether he will last as a Republican:

I really am. I’ll be honest. I really am. I’ve gained great respect for the 
Republican leadership. I’ve gained great respect... in different forms for the 
people I’ve met on this dais.

I am totally committed to the Republican party. I feel very honored to be the 
frontrunner. If I am nominated I think I will do very well.

Carson says the same. He says Priebus told him the Washington Post / Robert 
Costa report about the Republican meeting about what to do if Trump was 
nominated was inaccurate. He believes Priebus. Sure!

Richard Wolffe

From Guardian US columnist Richard Wolffe:

Trump said that the biggest problem facing the world is a nuclear weapon in 
the hands of a madman, or a maniac – an important distinction in today’s 
politics, and one to which voters should give serious consideration.

He also assures us that the devastation of a nuclear weapon is very personal 
to him: a sentiment shared by much of humanity, to be sure.

Trump is asked about calling Cruz a maniac. Trump makes nice.

I got to know him over the last three or four days. He has a wonderful 
temperament. He’s just fine, don’t worry about it.

Kind of laughter and applause.

The question flips to Cruz. Cruz is asked about what he said behind closed 
doors questioning Trump’s judgment. Cruz says he will say the same in public as 
he said in private.

Then he doesn’t say anything about Trump. Starts talking about his daughters, 
Reagan and communism.

Cruz is way far afield by now. Dana Bash reins him in. Is Trump qualified?

Anyone up here, says Cruz, would be infinitely more qualified.


Cruz keeps talking. Blitzer tries to cut in. “I’m answering the question, 
Wolf!”

Mona Chalabi

“We”. “They”. “China”. “Triad”. Anybody heard the words “female voters” 
recently? Here’s more from data editorMona Chalabi: 

Aside from an opening statement by Carly Fiorina about being called “every 
b-word in the book” (I know, we’re confused too 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2015/dec/15/cnn-republican-presidential-debate-december-15#block-5670c452e4b0a51f553dda9e>
), it’s starkly clear:women’s issues have been have been absent from more than 
two hours of debate so far. 

That’s partly because not all candidates depend on those female Republican 
voters to help them edge up in the polls.

Donald Trump’s latest rise in the polls has been largely due to rising support 
among men, according to ananalysis 
<http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1174a2GOPElection.pdf> 
released on Tuesday by the Washington Post and ABC News. Compared to a month 
ago, Trump has risen 17 points among male Republicans.

By contrast, however, some of the recent rise of Cruz (I know, we’re confused 
by that bro-mance onstage just now too) could be attributable to the fact that 
the Texas senator has jumped up 16 points among women.

Rubio takes the question on the triad-- planes, missile silos and nuclear 
subs. He gives a little course on the country’s nuclear defenses. Does not 
really prioritize one.

Q for Trump: What’s your priority among your nuclear triad?

Trump: We need someone who can be totally trusted. Well, I called Iraq “very 
strongly. We have to be extremely vigilant and extremely careful when it comes 
to nuclear.”

“The biggest problem we have today is not president Obama with global 
warming,” he says... [It’s] having some madmen go out and get a nuclear weapon.

Richard Wolffe

From Guardian US columnist Richard Wolffe:

From the party that was once led by a “compassionate conservative”, Rand Paul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rand-paul> said that refugees shouldn’t 
expect to get government-funded housing. And John Kasich lamented the arrival 
of 10 disruptive Central American minors in his own state when he couldn’t 
track them.

This party has traveled a long way from the Bush era in the last seven years.

And then finally, the real threat to national security: Hillary Clinton’s 
private email server. Jeb! somehow tried to thread a needle with China, Isis 
and the media – it’s hard to tell who is the greater challenge for the next 
President of the United States, I guess.

Christie is asked about his threatened cyber war on China.

He says China hides business from its people. He says he would reveal the 
corrupt workings of the Chinese government to the Chinese people. He accuses 
Obama of a lack of response to Chinese cyber-attacks.

Bush is asked whether all that is a good idea. “I completely agree with 
Chris,” Bush says. “Think about it. Secretary Clinton uses a private server.”

“We have to have the best defensive capabilities,” Bush says. “We need to 
create a situation that they know that there will be adverse impacts... They’ll 
respect that.”

The fifth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 cycle is in the can. 
Here’s what we learned:

 * It was long on substance. Candidates were asked about national security 
issues, immigration policy, government surveillance and naughty things the 
candidates have said about each other on the campaign trail. 
 * Florida senator Marco Rubio and Texas senator Ted Cruz locked horns over 
Rubio’s support for immigration reform and Cruz’s support for reining in NSA 
surveillance. Both fought expertly. No clear winner declared. 
 * Donald Trump said he had no plan to run as a third-party candidate. “I am 
totally committed to the Republican party,” Trump said. 
 * Former Florida governor Jeb Bush repeatedly attacked Donald Trump, calling 
him the “chaos candidate” and saying “You’re not going to insult your way to 
president of the United States.” 
 * Was it such a fight-y night? Not really – neither Cruz nor Rubio, nor New 
Jersey governor Chris Christie, opted to tangle with Trump, who himself passed 
on an invitation to hit Cruz. 
 * Christie did, however, call president Obama a “feckless weakling.” 
 * Did Trump botch a question about the country’s triad of nuclear defenses, 
sub-plan-silo? He didn’t answer a Q about which needed updating most urgently.

 * Rubio left the door open on a path to citizenship for some undocumented 
migrants, a heresy in some corners of the party. “I personally am open to 
people having the possibility of applying for a green card,” he said – after 10 
years’ probation and strict tests. 
 * Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator, did go after Trump, who he said wanted to 
shred the constitution. Trump pretty much ignored him. 
 * A substantive big-picture debate broke out over whether it’s better for the 
US national security to have dictators in the Middle East. Also unresolved. 
 * Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina quoted Thatcher: “Margaret 
Thatcher once said, if you want something talked about, ask a man. If you want 
something done, ask a woman.”

And here’s our full report from Sabrina Siddiqui and Paul Lewis on the ground 
in Las Vegas:

Like the first, not one word about income inequality, climate change, or racial 
justice. The Rs are out of touch.

Trump: “I get along with Ted very well actually. I just think he was very 
nice, and very respectful, and I have a lot of respect for Ted.”
 
Trump is being interviewed after the debate. He calls the debate “one of my 
better ones.”

#factcheck: why not
 
It’s over! Who won? 
 
Paul: The greatest threat to national security is our debt. It’s both parties’ 
fault. [Cough] We are not a stronger nation if we go further into debt. I’m the 
only one on this stage who will hold the line on spending. [Rabid cheers]

Kasich: You have to win Ohio to win the White House if you are a Republican. 
The people of Ohio are the people of America. Connect with heads and hearts. We 
will beat Hillary Clinton. [some applause]

Christie: I lost touch with my wife and brother for six hours on 9/11 and many 
friends and neighbors were killed. Terrorism is real. I have already protected 
the country. I want the chance to do it again. I will protect America. [generic 
applause]

Fiorina: I remember 9/11 too. We had to put in place security measures around 
the world. We have to begin by beating Hillary Clinton. We need to unify our 
party. We need to beat Hillary Clinton. I can.

Bush: Ask yourself: Which candidate will keep you and the country safer, 
stronger, freer. I have a proven record as governor. I don’t make false 
promises. Keep America safe. Vote Bush. [some applause]

Rubio: This is the most important election in a generation. But millions of 
Americans feel left behind. This election is about restored economic vibrancy. 
Rebuild the military. New American century Vote Rubio. [applause and some 
whistles but the crowd just sounds tired]

Cruz: America can win again and we will win again. Ronald Reagan was awesome. 
I will be too. Cutting taxes. Stronger military. Simple strategy: We win, they 
loose. [passing applause]

Carson: I’ve been to 58 countries. USA is #1. Mother said if I work hard 
anything is possible. I believe it’s true. Political correctness bad. 
[applause-ish]

Trump: Our country doesn’t win anymore. Military, trade, Isis, vets, health 
care. Nothing works in our country. If I’m elected president we will win again 
and we’re going to have a great great country greater than ever before.
 
Trump is asked whether he will last as a Republican:

I really am. I’ll be honest. I really am. I’ve gained great respect for the 
Republican leadership. I’ve gained great respect... in different forms for the 
people I’ve met on this dais.

I am totally committed to the Republican party. I feel very honored to be the 
frontrunner. If I am nominated I think I will do very well.

Carson says the same. He says Priebus told him the Washington Post / Robert 
Costa report about the Republican meeting about what to do if Trump was 
nominated was inaccurate. He believes Priebus. Sure!

 
From Guardian US columnist Richard Wolffe:

Trump said that the biggest problem facing the world is a nuclear weapon in 
the hands of a madman, or a maniac – an important distinction in today’s 
politics, and one to which voters should give serious consideration.

He also assures us that the devastation of a nuclear weapon is very personal 
to him: a sentiment shared by much of humanity, to be sure.
 
Trump is asked about calling Cruz a maniac. Trump makes nice.

I got to know him over the last three or four days. He has a wonderful 
temperament. He’s just fine, don’t worry about it.

Kind of laughter and applause.

The question flips to Cruz. Cruz is asked about what he said behind closed 
doors questioning Trump’s judgment. Cruz says he will say the same in public as 
he said in private.

Then he doesn’t say anything about Trump. Starts talking about his daughters, 
Reagan and communism.

Cruz is way far afield by now. Dana Bash reins him in. Is Trump qualified?

Anyone up here, says Cruz, would be infinitely more qualified.


Cruz keeps talking. Blitzer tries to cut in. “I’m answering the question, 
Wolf!”
 
“We”. “They”. “China”. “Triad”. Anybody heard the words “female voters” 
recently? Here’s more from data editorMona Chalabi: 

Aside from an opening statement by Carly Fiorina about being called “every 
b-word in the book” (I know, we’re confused too 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2015/dec/15/cnn-republican-presidential-debate-december-15#block-5670c452e4b0a51f553dda9e>
), it’s starkly clear:women’s issues have been have been absent from more than 
two hours of debate so far. 

That’s partly because not all candidates depend on those female Republican 
voters to help them edge up in the polls.

Donald Trump’s latest rise in the polls has been largely due to rising support 
among men, according to ananalysis 
<http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1174a2GOPElection.pdf> 
released on Tuesday by the Washington Post and ABC News. Compared to a month 
ago, Trump has risen 17 points among male Republicans.

By contrast, however, some of the recent rise of Cruz (I know, we’re confused 
by that bro-mance onstage just now too) could be attributable to the fact that 
the Texas senator has jumped up 16 points among women.
 The truth about female voters and the GOP Photograph: Mona Chalabi for the 
Guardian  
Rubio takes the question on the triad-- planes, missile silos and nuclear 
subs. He gives a little course on the country’s nuclear defenses. Does not 
really prioritize one.
 
Q for Trump: What’s your priority among your nuclear triad?

Trump: We need someone who can be totally trusted. Well, I called Iraq “very 
strongly. We have to be extremely vigilant and extremely careful when it comes 
to nuclear.”

“The biggest problem we have today is not president Obama with global 
warming,” he says... [It’s] having some madmen go out and get a nuclear weapon.
 
From Guardian US columnist Richard Wolffe:

From the party that was once led by a “compassionate conservative”, Rand Paul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rand-paul> said that refugees shouldn’t 
expect to get government-funded housing. And John Kasich lamented the arrival 
of 10 disruptive Central American minors in his own state when he couldn’t 
track them.

This party has traveled a long way from the Bush era in the last seven years.

And then finally, the real threat to national security: Hillary Clinton’s 
private email server. Jeb! somehow tried to thread a needle with China, Isis 
and the media – it’s hard to tell who is the greater challenge for the next 
President of the United States, I guess.
 
Christie is asked about his threatened cyber war on China.

He says China hides business from its people. He says he would reveal the 
corrupt workings of the Chinese government to the Chinese people. He accuses 
Obama of a lack of response to Chinese cyber-attacks.

Bush is asked whether all that is a good idea. “I completely agree with 
Chris,” Bush says. “Think about it. Secretary Clinton uses a private server.”

“We have to have the best defensive capabilities,” Bush says. “We need to 
create a situation that they know that there will be adverse impacts... They’ll 
respect that.”
