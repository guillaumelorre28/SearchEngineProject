The Bluecoat

One of the undisputed grande dames of Liverpool's cultural landscape, the 
Bluecoat gallery is housed in the oldest building in the city centre; 
originally a schoolhouse and dating from the early 18th century, the building 
enjoys Unesco world heritage and Grade I-listed status. Although boasting a 
rich history: it hosted the first Post Impressionist exhibition in 1911, 
including works by Picasso, Cézanne, Van Gogh, Matisse and Gauguin – it is, 
nevertheless, an institution facing forwards. Not without initial local 
controversy, the arts centre underwent significant architectural redevelopment 
in 2008 and continues to be a staple for those hoping to spot emerging and 
mid-career artists.

FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology)
 Photograph: Bjanka Kadic/Alamy 
Key to the redevelopment of the Ropewalks quarter of Liverpool, and catering 
for the needs of film and art lovers since 2003, FACT was founded on a remit to 
"use the power of creative technology to inspire and enrich lives". Tucked 
behind the bohemian Bold St, this futuristic-looking space – made up of three 
floors of galleries, cinema screens, a cafe and a bar – celebrated a decade 
since its launch, in which time it has played host to pioneering work from
Pipilotti Rist <http://www.pipilottirist.net/>, Nam June Paik 
<http://www.paikstudios.com/>, Apichatpong Weerasethakul 
<http://www.kickthemachine.com/> and Kurt Hentschläger 
<http://www.kurthentschlager.com/>.

Open Eye Gallery

The only gallery dedicated to photography and related media in the north-west, 
Open Eye is increasingly an essential part of Liverpool's already impressive 
art offering. Founded in 1977, it remained something of a hidden gem until its 
move in 2011 to a purpose-built home on the waterfront. As if to consolidate 
the move, a new artistic director, Lorenzo Fusi (previously curator of 
Liverpool Biennial), was appointed in 2013 and has already signalled his intent 
with some progressive programming. Using a mixture of cutting-edge 
international photography and a considerable archive, Open Eye is a must-visit 
destination on the city's art map.
• 19 Mann Island, Liverpool Waterfront, openeye.org.uk 
<http://www.openeye.org.uk/>. Open Tues-Sun during exhibitions, 10.30am-5.30pm. 
Closed on Mondays (except bank holidays), admission free

Exhibition Research Centre (ERC)

to The Show exhibition. Photograph: Museum of Modern Art Library, New York 
Within the John Lennon Art and Design Building is the first academic centre 
devoted to the study of exhibitions in the UK. It offers a different 
perspective on the city's arts scene; the focus here is delving deeper into why 
and how artists and curators work. Quietly producing an excellent and varied 
programme since the start of 2013, the arts space is open to the public but is, 
as yet, flying somewhat under the radar. The current exhibition, Please Come to 
The Show (until 11 April), showcases a fabulous array of innovative printed 
invitations, posters and flyers from The Museum of Modern Art.

10am-5pm (during exhibitions), admission free

Lady Lever Art Gallery

Yes, we know, it's not strictly Liverpool, but it is well worth the short 
train journey across the river. For visitors to the Lady Lever, its location in 
the picturesque model-village ofPort Sunlight 
<http://www.portsunlightvillage.com/> will make for a pleasing, if slightly 
uncanny, addition to the experience. Both the village and the gallery itself 
are a legacy of the benevolence of English industrialist William Hesketh Lever, 
who wanted to share his collection with the public, even personally selecting 
works for display. With one of the UK's most impressive collections of fine and 
decorative art – including a number of pre-Raphaelite works – the Lady Lever 
Gallery is a fitting memorial to its benefactor; 2014 marks the centenary of 
the laying of its foundation stone.

Metal Culture 

Based in a working train station (Edge Hill, the oldest passenger station in 
the world), and part of a trio of national arts organisations (including 
Southend-on-Sea and Peterborough), Metal is probably best known locally for its 
artist meals. Established specifically to bring communities and artists 
together over food, an Aga stove is an important addition in each venue. 
Comfort food aside, Metal has a commitment to providing the time and space 
artists need to develop their practice, providing residency spaces in the old 
railway rooms, as well as regular film nights, discussion groups and, of 
course, performances and exhibitions.

The Royal Standard
 The Royal Standard liverpool 
Providing an ambitious programme of exhibitions since 2006, as well as 
affordable studio and project spaces, this is the city's most exciting 
artist-led space. The gallery is a magnet for promising and emerging 
contemporary artists and curators; boasting past exhibitorsJamie Shovlin 
<http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/jamie_shovlin.htm>, Pil and Galia 
<http://www.kollectiv.co.uk/> and Laura Buckley <http://www.laurabuckley.com/>, 
plus collaborations with establishments ranging from Tate Modern toBlackpool's 
Supercollider <http://www.supercolliderhq.org.uk/contents2.html>. In a business 
park at the edge of the city centre, this place may feel somewhat off the 
beaten track, but persevere; it also means that artists get large and 
affordable workspaces, making The Royal Standard a much-needed nurturing ground 
for independent and innovative art events, talks, pop-up galleries and 
collaborative projects.

Victoria Gallery & Museum

A glorious sister venue to London's Natural History Museum (both designed by 
Liverpool-born architect Alfred Waterhouse), it's worth a visit to the 
University of Liverpool's gallery and museum for its exterior alone. The Grade 
II-listed building's gothic terracotta design led to the coining of the term 
"red-brick" university and is a shining example of Victorian prowess; more so 
now after a recent £8.6m refurb. Expect a really creepy museum (fossils, 
taxidermy, skeletons and curios from the university's 130-year history), a 
special collections gallery (including the largest display of paintings and 
prints by wildlife artistJohn James Audubon 
<http://www.audubon.org/john-james-audubon> outside the US), and a regularly 
revolving programme of contemporary art exhibitions.
• Ashton Street, vgm.liverpool.ac.uk <http://vgm.liverpool.ac.uk/>. Open

Walker Gallery

With an impressive collection of paintings, sculpture and decorative art from 
the 13th century to the present day, this grand gallery is still one of 
Liverpool's best tourist attractions. Part of a strip of much-loved public 
buildings on William Brown Street (including the Central Library, St George's 
Hall and World Museum), it's a great place to spend an afternoon. Lose yourself 
in the Victorian galleries lined with traditional wallpapers, 17th-century 
Dutch and Flemish art,John Moores Painting Prize 
<http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/johnmoores/> winners – including 
Hockney's Peter Getting Out Of Nick's Pool 
<http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/hockney.aspx> – and 
(our favourite) the stunning white sculpture room on the ground floor.

Tate Liverpool

Opened in 1988 as part of the redevelopment of Liverpool's waterfront, this 
converted Albert Dock warehouse retains many original features, including 
wonderful iron-work windows looking out on to the Mersey. A vital element in 
the positioning of the city as an important centre for the arts, Tate Liverpool 
has become one of the largest and most significant galleries of modern and 
contemporary art in the UK outside of London. Expect blockbuster artists across 
four floors of gallery space, a cafe, bookshop (including a great selection of 
art magazines) and an ever-changing programme of special events and lectures.
