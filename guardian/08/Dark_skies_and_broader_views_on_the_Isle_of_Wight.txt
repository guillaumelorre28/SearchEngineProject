I am sorry that Polly Toynbee cannot understand why anyone might like the Isle 
of Wight (Tory Britain rehearses its collapse on the Isle of Wight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/07/isle-wight-tory-rehearses-collapse>
, 7 April). It is true (and lamentable) that the island suffers great 
inequality, but in that it is a microcosm of Britain as a whole. It is also 
true that much of its population is, like Polly Toynbee and me, ageing and 
white. I hope they feel suitably guilty.

But what the article overlooks is not only the unusual politeness and 
friendliness of most islanders (at least in my experience) but also the Isle of 
Wight’s stunning natural beauty, inland and coastal. It really is a gem. And as 
well as having a variety of lovely, unspoilt landscapes, it is probably the 
best place in southern England to enjoy truly dark skies at night.

The Isle of Wight is not as warm as Tuscany or Provence, and the food is not 
as good, but it is one of the most beautiful parts of our beautiful country. 
When commentators like Polly Toynbee go on tour to take the pulse of the 
electorate, they should take a few hours out for a walk in the countryside. It 
would improve their views in more ways than one.

• Polly Toynbee has really had to scratch around to find evidence of Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> success at local council level in 
one bit of the Isle of Wight and it is remarkably perverse of her to give the 
impression that the constituency is otherwise solidly Conservative. It was 
represented in parliament by my Liberal colleague Stephen Ross from 1974 to 
1987 and by Liberal Democrat Peter Brand from 1997 to 2001; 40% 
non-Conservative representation in recent years doesn’t suggest an overly 
“solid” Tory electorate.
