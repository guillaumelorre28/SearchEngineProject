The Frog and Toad books are perfect gifts. Children of three to five adore 
these wry, intelligent and gentle stories about two very different friends. 
Frog is patient and modest. Toad is not. But together they face the problems 
any child will recognise: ice‑creams that melt too fast, an overpowering 
inability to get out of bed, lost buttons, failure of will power, and all the 
myriad misunderstandings, anxieties and triumphs of small busy lives.

The illustrations are a restful, greeny-brown delight. There’s nothing brash 
and cartoony about these stories. Though written as simply as fables, the wry 
humour makes them appeal to a wide age range. No adult I know ever tires of 
reading them aloud. I’ve seen grown men reduced to tears of laughter by Frog 
and Toad’s confusions.

It’s an old-fashioned adventure story, but set in a modern London estate. The 
adventure takes place over one night, when the characters go on a mission to 
the other side of the city. It’s set against the backdrop of a riot – people 
are looting shops and the town centre is a no-go area. Throughout the book 
there’s a threat of violence, and it deals with topics such as sexting, which 
aren’t very well represented in the usual books on the GCSE syllabus. The 
dialogue and conversations between characters are so vibrant – I have no idea 
if that’s how young people talk on estates in London, but it felt authentic. I 
was blown away by one of my pupils’ responses to the book – he went away and 
made his mum order the earlier story, Liccle Bit. He hadn’t read a book for 
five years.

E Nesbit was the inventor of the modern children’s adventure story. Less well 
known than Five Children and It orThe Railway Children 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/mar/26/theatre.booksforchildrenandteenagers>
, this to my mind is her most imaginative book. Three siblings discover a 
secret tunnel that leads them to what they believe is an enchanted castle, 
though its princess, Mabel, is just as ordinary as they are, despite possessing 
a ring that can make you invisible.

The most powerful part of this book is when some creatures called the 
Ugly-Wuglies, whom the children make out of coathangers and umbrellas and 
broomsticks, come to life. They have no roofs to their mouths, so when they 
speak, “Can you recommend me to a good hotel?” comes out as “Aa oo re o me me 
oo a oo ho el?” It is terrifying yet funny at the same time.

A classic bit of historical children’s fiction. I’m amazed when I reread it 
just how closely she followed the Tudor sources. The story starts with a 
christening procession that saw the future queen watching her baby brother, 
Edward VI, being taken by torchlight through the galleries of the palace to the 
ceremony in the Chapel Royal. It was just one of Plaidy’s many historical books 
with young female protagonists that were catnip to an introverted nine-year-old 
like me. My own copy, with its picture of Hampton Court Palace on the cover, is 
undoubtedly one of the reasons I’ve ended up working there as chief curator.

This is a lyrical picture book where we follow a young girl who takes a little 
boy on an adventure through books. It’s about how fiction opens our minds and 
opens doors to other places. There are beautiful illustrations combined with 
extracts from classic literature and lullabies. Even though the text elements 
of the story are short, there’s a joyous celebration of language within it. The 
use of classic texts such as Treasure Island has made the children want to 
explore those books – we’ve had to buy more classic text for our library 
because of it.

This book is set in 1919 and it’s about a girl called Henrietta. It’s shrouded 
in mystery at the beginning so you don’t really know what’s happened, but you 
know there’s been an accident and that she had a brother who has died, and that 
they’ve moved away to the country and mum is ill. It’s a real page turner – I 
finished reading it in one night when my son went to bed. He’s 10 but I would 
say it’s suitable for children of nine-plus. There are lots of words where my 
son would ask “what does that mean?”

It’s a rollicking story, with lots of historical education. The main 
character’s father is sent away because he’s charged with a theft, and so the 
son has to prove his father is not guilty. He has to fight the social 
prejudices of the day – prejudices against poor people – to prove his father is 
innocent. It shows the injustice of 200 or so years ago for somebody of colour, 
and it’s about the imbalance of power between rich and poor, and about someone 
trying to fight against injustice. It’s so relevant to today, and that’s why I 
really enjoyed it. It’s also very educational – not many people are aware, 
especially school children today, that black people did exist in north Devon 
and places like that in the 17th or 18th century.

, so it’s got classic writers, but also lots of contemporary writers.

The reason I love short stories is that they introduce children to new 
authors. Children often get stuck in a rut – “I’m just reading everything by
Jacqueline Wilson. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/06/jacqueline-wilson-interview>” 
When you give them a short story anthology it opens a whole new world. It’s 
suitable for a child around seven, or a child a bit older than that could read 
independently.

I’m a sucker for both rhyming couplets and any “mean person finds joy and love 
through the magic of Christmas” story, so How The Grinch Stole Christmas! – 
Dickens with a fluffier antagonist – is in constant demand in my family every 
December. The jaunty, singsong style of Dr Seuss is entrancing and comforting, 
especially for children, but it’s the warmth and the heart in this story that 
make it so unforgettable (along with classic insults like “you have termites in 
your smile”). No child or adult should go through a winter season without at

It’s easy to forget the brilliant characterisation in these stories. They’re 
about a girl who gets into trouble constantly, but her moral development as a 
character comes about as a result of her making mistakes. She learns to deal 
with her own vanity and pride. They’re timeless books and the things that she 
goes through – feelings of loss, abandonment, feeling like you don’t fit in – 
most young people experience today. Considering it was written in the early 
1900s, it’s still incredibly relevant. There’s a remake happening of the TV 
series, so it’s going to come back into the public eye.

It’s about a school for wizards, so that may sound familiar. What is 
astonishing about the book is that Le Guin’s definition of magic and how it 
works is strangely convincing. You have to really understand something – to 
know its real name – before you can control it. The hero, Sparrowhawk, has 
therefore to find the real name of the shadow that is haunting him.

It’s a book full of magic and adventure – it has unquestionably the best map 
of any fantasy book. But it’s also full of beauty and a wisdom that I still 
draw on now. It would be the gift that keeps on giving.

This book it had a profound effect on me. I believe any child experiencing 
adversity, rejection or that feeling of not belonging will find solace in this 
book. It will also make them realise they are not alone, as it covers many of 
the issues children are facing today.

Those who suffer from depression or mental health problems, because of the 
unhappy situations they have to endure, will find this book will empower them 
to feel worthy and not to allow events to ruin their life, as it will reassure 
them that it is not their fault when people behave cruelly.

It’s a classic book that inspires readers. It fires up the imagination and 
takes the reader on an unforgettable journey.

Paul Stewart’s delightful tale of discovering your own special talents, even 
though they may be different from those around you, is brought to life by Jane 
Porter’s beautiful collage illustrations. Penguin’s deepest desire has always 
been to fly but everything goes wrong. It is only when penguin falls into the 
sea that he discovers a different way to fly. This heart-warming picture book 
shows children that everyone has something they’re good at. It’s simply a 
matter of finding what it is.

I loved this book. Pushkin Children’s Books are to be congratulated in making 
it available to an English audience. How important it is, in these times, that 
our children read the stories from other peoples, other cultures, other times.

Set in Tokyo just before the second world war, the Little People, Bilbo, Fern 
and their children, Robin and Iris, live on a shelf in a dusty room full of 
books and are cared for by the Moriyama family. The Little People have been 
entrusted to the Moriyamas by an English teacher, Miss MacLachlan, who has to 
leave Japan after 20 years’ teaching English as the war comes closer. There is 
a strong sense of place and the changing seasons are beautifully described. 
While the story has elements of the work of Oscar Wilde and Hans Christian 
Andersen, the author admits to having been inspired by Kenneth Grahame and 
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

An education book that changed me: favourite reads revealed

It’s a short novel, suitable for ages nine- to 13, written as a series of 
poems. The narrator is Lonnie Motion, an 11-year-old boy whose parents died 
four years previously in a fire and whom, having spent some time in “group 
home” now lives with his foster mother, Ms Edna. His teacher encourages him to 
“write it down before it leaves your brain” and so sets about writing a series 
of poems through which we learn of his feelings about the loss of his parents, 
his separation from his sister and the people in his life who show him love.

Woodson captures the language of a young African American boy who is 
determined to make sense of his world. I was struck by how well I felt I knew 
the other characters in the book just through their appearances in Lonnie’s 
poems. The warmth and optimism of the book shines through without ever feeling 
forced.

This is a collection of stories about Richard Feynman, one of the greatest 
physicists of the 20th century. It’s all about how he got into physics and the 
fun he had doing it. Some stories are more serious – he was involved in 
developing the nuclear bomb – but a lot are about how he played with concepts 
and was always open to new ideas. The book challenges the sense that there’s a 
canon of material one must learn to master the subject – it’s about mindset, 
creativity and fun. It’s accessible to 15- to 16-year-olds who are interested 
in physics.

Zoo-ology was published the month my eldest child was born, and has been a 
family favourite for eight years. Each spread is a safari for the senses, 
crammed with Joelle Jolivet’s striking animal prints. Her artwork is 
captivating at any age – bold enough to appeal to babies, and beautiful enough 
to tempt you to tear out and frame the pages. The book is a wonderful way to 
start talking about biodiversity, but most of all, it’s fun. When my boys were 
little, they sat on the pages playing animal hide and seek and spotting the 
hidden chameleons. Now eight, six and four, they gather around to invent their 
own versions of I Spy and Guess Who? Older children can pore over well-chosen 
facts about the featured creatures, tucked away at the back.

I’m mixed race and there weren’t any books that appealed to my ethnicity. It 
was the first book I connected with. It explores the idea of racism by 
reversing the superior race and having the black community as the ruling class. 
The main story line is a white boy and a black girl who are friends and they 
end up falling in love even though the odds are against them. The themes are 
more prominent in today’s society than ever – you’ve got racism, terrorism, 
friendship and war. The school I teach in is quite diverse, and when theBlack 
Lives Matter protests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement> were 
happening over the summer last year, I used this novel to explore the issue 
more deeply.
