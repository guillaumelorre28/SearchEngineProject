Day two of the 2016 Republican national convention is in the can. Here’s what 
happened:

 * Donald Trump was formally nominated by the Republican party to be president 
of the United States and Mike Pence was nominated to be vice president. 
 * On the convention floor, a member of each state delegation said something 
good about their state, then announced how its delegates were to be awarded. 
 * Once upon a time, the question was whether Trump could hit 1,237 delegates. 
In the end he got 1,725. Ted Cruz was second with 475. John Kasich got 120 and 
Marco Rubio 114. 
 * Award for liveliest floor speech went to Chris Christie, who hid it well if 
he’s sour about not being named running mate. Christie, a former prosecutor, 
pretended to prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the crowd got to yell “guilty!” 
over and over. They also chanted “Lock her up!” 
 * Donald Trump Jr won praise and applause for a speech that appeared to be 
undergirded by some conviction about his father’s virtue and industriousness. 
Tiffany Trump also spoke, with poise. 
 * But it emerged that a couple lines about education in Donald Trump Jr’s 
speech had also appeared inan essay 
<https://twitter.com/AlanYuhas/status/755604868157636608> by a Canadian law 
professor, who it turns out helped write Jr’s speech. Much of the convention 
buzz Tuesday was attached to Melania Trump borrowing Michelle Obama’s words the 
night earlier. 
 * House speaker Paul Ryan presided amiably over Trump’s nomination and gave a 
speech about Republicans having an advantage in the national debate because 
they have ideas. The speech barely mentioned Trump.

 * Outside the convention hall, city officials said the total number of 
arrests on the week was five and “the Erie County Public Health Department is 
overseeing an issue regarding norovirus at Kalahari Resort.” 
 * Police were a heavy presence in Public Square as protests played out from 
across the spectrum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/cleveland-protest-republican-national-convention-police>
. 
 * Trump said he would appear at the convention Wednesday night before giving 
his big speech Thursday. Stay tuned!

It appears that at least a couple lines in Donald Trump Jr’s speech were 
lifted from an essay in The American Conservative (full article here 
<http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/trump-vs-the-new-class/>), 
without attribution.

Reince Priebus is back. He recognizes the delegate from Illinois to move to 
adjourn the convention. The delegates moves to adjourn.

Priebus calls for ayes and nos. The ayes have it although once again there are 
some inexplicably stalwart “NO!”s. What would they accomplish at this late hour?

Then the band strikes up Love Train. Listen to this while you look at the

Kimberlin Brown continues, bravely, as the room empties. The California 
delegation, her local, is politely listening. The vast majority of delegates 
otherwise are peacing out. The Trump family is long gone from their box. The 
night is finishing on time.

Brown: 

As an actress and a farmer– did you ever expect to see those words in the same 
sentence – I’ve seen first hand the impact of high taxes, over-regulation, and 
suspect trade deals.

I have seen tv and movie productions move out of the country. If you were an 
“A” lister like Leonardo DiCaprio or an owner of a studio, you were okay. But, 
if you were a cameraman, sound tech, boom operator or did any one of the many 
jobs in a production, you were out of luck.

“I am proud to support Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> – the extraordinary 
businessman and the right leader for our time,” Carson says. His prepared 
remarks are over but he keeps speaking.

Then a protester is attempting a protest. She has a banner that a member of 
the crowd tries to snatch from her. Two people nearby hold up American flags, 
which they have very handy, to block her from cameras. People are yelling at 
her, “USA! USA!”

Carson wraps and the band strikes up. Convention staff are moving toward the 
protester, who is giving a peace sign and seems nonthreatening in the extreme. 
A lady tries to steal the protester’s flag. The protester is surrounded by 
convention people. She has not been removed. She is holding up a peace sign. 
Here come convention staff. The band plays through the interruption. The 
American flag curtains blocking the protester from cameras is strange, it’s as 
if they’re trying to shield her while she’s changing. The protester is being 
led out. There she goes.

“We must resist the temptation to take the easy way out and passively accept 
what is fed to us by the media or the political elite,” Carson says, from his 
prepared text. Then he ad libs a line about the media: “They don’t know what 
they’re talking about, and they have an agenda.”

Carson then strays from his prepared text. The Teleprompter stops moving. 

And Carson says that one of Clinton’s mentors was Saul Alinsky. “This was 
someone that she greatly admired... he wrote a book called Rules for Radicals. 
On the dedication page he acknowledges Lucifer, the original radical who 
founded his own kingdom.”

Why are liberals always trying to force Ben Carson to be politically correct?

Capito’s done. Up next is Ben Carson and people are excited. A few delegates 
are visibly jumping up and down. There’s sustained applause. Ben Carson is a 
Republican rock star. “Don’t eat up my time,” he jokes.

Day two of the 2016 Republican national convention is in the can. Here’s what 
happened:

 * Donald Trump was formally nominated by the Republican party to be president 
of the United States and Mike Pence was nominated to be vice president. 
 * On the convention floor, a member of each state delegation said something 
good about their state, then announced how its delegates were to be awarded. 
 * Once upon a time, the question was whether Trump could hit 1,237 delegates. 
In the end he got 1,725. Ted Cruz was second with 475. John Kasich got 120 and 
Marco Rubio 114. 
 * Award for liveliest floor speech went to Chris Christie, who hid it well if 
he’s sour about not being named running mate. Christie, a former prosecutor, 
pretended to prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the crowd got to yell “guilty!” 
over and over. They also chanted “Lock her up!” 
 * Donald Trump Jr won praise and applause for a speech that appeared to be 
undergirded by some conviction about his father’s virtue and industriousness. 
Tiffany Trump also spoke, with poise. 
 * But it emerged that a couple lines about education in Donald Trump Jr’s 
speech had also appeared inan essay 
<https://twitter.com/AlanYuhas/status/755604868157636608> by a Canadian law 
professor, who it turns out helped write Jr’s speech. Much of the convention 
buzz Tuesday was attached to Melania Trump borrowing Michelle Obama’s words the 
night earlier. 
 * House speaker Paul Ryan presided amiably over Trump’s nomination and gave a 
speech about Republicans having an advantage in the national debate because 
they have ideas. The speech barely mentioned Trump.

 * Outside the convention hall, city officials said the total number of 
arrests on the week was five and “the Erie County Public Health Department is 
overseeing an issue regarding norovirus at Kalahari Resort.” 
 * Police were a heavy presence in Public Square as protests played out from 
across the spectrum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/cleveland-protest-republican-national-convention-police>
. 
 * Trump said he would appear at the convention Wednesday night before giving 
his big speech Thursday. Stay tuned!  
It appears that at least a couple lines in Donald Trump Jr’s speech were 
lifted from an essay in The American Conservative (full article here 
<http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/trump-vs-the-new-class/>), 
without attribution.

Update: the author Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> Jr apparently borrowed from, 
a Canadian law professor, weighs in, somewhat cryptically, tweeting, “Except it 
wasn’t stealing.”

F.H. Buckley tells @businessinsider <https://twitter.com/businessinsider>: "I 
was a speechwriter for this speech. So I'm afraid there's no issue here."

Here’s the latest summary of the protest and public safety situation courtesy 
of the city of Cleveland. Quoting a statement:

 There have been a total of 5 arrests as it relates to the Republican National 
Convention since Sunday, July 17.

· A warning alarm on an RTA bus sounded. The bus was stopped and evacuated. A 
hazmat crew declared it to be a false alarm.

· A fire alarm was pulled at the Hilton. The building was evacuated and the 
incident is being investigated.

· The Bicycle Unit was deployed to large scale demonstrations to keep two 
opposing sides separated. Both protests dispersed and no civilians or officers 
were harmed.

· The list of registered protest groups is available here. 
<https://clecityhall.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/list-of-official-parade-and-park-use-permits-and-official-speakers-platform1.pdf>

· The expectation for protestors is to exercise their rights peacefully and 
without harming others or property.

· If not of a criminal nature, individuals with prohibited items are asked to 
leave and the items confiscated.

· Officers have trained for many scenarios. Hundreds of agencies have 
responded to the call to assist Cleveland Police.

Health Concerns:

· The Erie County Public Health Department is overseeing an issue regarding 
norovirus at Kalahari Resort.
 
Reince Priebus is back. He recognizes the delegate from Illinois to move to 
adjourn the convention. The delegates moves to adjourn.

Priebus calls for ayes and nos. The ayes have it although once again there are 
some inexplicably stalwart “NO!”s. What would they accomplish at this late hour?

Then the band strikes up Love Train. Listen to this while you look at the 
tweet below and it will be like being here:

Kimberlin Brown continues, bravely, as the room empties. The California 
delegation, her local, is politely listening. The vast majority of delegates 
otherwise are peacing out. The Trump family is long gone from their box. The 
night is finishing on time.

Brown: 

As an actress and a farmer– did you ever expect to see those words in the same 
sentence – I’ve seen first hand the impact of high taxes, over-regulation, and 
suspect trade deals.

I have seen tv and movie productions move out of the country. If you were an 
“A” lister like Leonardo DiCaprio or an owner of a studio, you were okay. But, 
if you were a cameraman, sound tech, boom operator or did any one of the many 
jobs in a production, you were out of luck.

The last scheduled speaker is actress and businesswoman Kimberlin Brown. “Many 
of you may know me from one of your favorite soap operas, The Young & the 
Restless, the Bold & the Beautiful, and many other television shows and films,” 
she begins.
 
“I am proud to support Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> – the extraordinary 
businessman and the right leader for our time,” Carson says. His prepared 
remarks are over but he keeps speaking.

Then a protester is attempting a protest. She has a banner that a member of 
the crowd tries to snatch from her. Two people nearby hold up American flags, 
which they have very handy, to block her from cameras. People are yelling at 
her, “USA! USA!”

Carson wraps and the band strikes up. Convention staff are moving toward the 
protester, who is giving a peace sign and seems nonthreatening in the extreme. 
A lady tries to steal the protester’s flag. The protester is surrounded by 
convention people. She has not been removed. She is holding up a peace sign. 
Here come convention staff. The band plays through the interruption. The 
American flag curtains blocking the protester from cameras is strange, it’s as 
if they’re trying to shield her while she’s changing. The protester is being 
led out. There she goes.

“We must resist the temptation to take the easy way out and passively accept 
what is fed to us by the media or the political elite,” Carson says, from his 
prepared text. Then he ad libs a line about the media: “They don’t know what 
they’re talking about, and they have an agenda.”

Carson then strays from his prepared text. The Teleprompter stops moving. 

And Carson says that one of Clinton’s mentors was Saul Alinsky. “This was 
someone that she greatly admired... he wrote a book called Rules for Radicals. 
On the dedication page he acknowledges Lucifer, the original radical who 
founded his own kingdom.”

“I have to start out by saying one very important thing. I’m not politically 
correct,” he says.

Why are liberals always trying to force Ben Carson to be politically correct? 
 
Capito’s done. Up next is Ben Carson and people are excited. A few delegates 
are visibly jumping up and down. There’s sustained applause. Ben Carson is a 
Republican rock star. “Don’t eat up my time,” he jokes.
