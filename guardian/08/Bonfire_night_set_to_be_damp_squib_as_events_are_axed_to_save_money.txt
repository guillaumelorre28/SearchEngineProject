For decades the citizens of Birmingham have wrapped up warm and trooped along 
toPype Hayes park  
<https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/directory_record/9143/pype_hayes_park>in their 
thousands for an evening of fun and entertainment on Guy Fawkes night.

Not this Bonfire night <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/bonfire-night>
. The city council has said it cannot justify staging the event in times of 
austerity and is instead directing Brummies to a private – and pricey – event.

“I think lots of people are angry,” said Margaret Phillips, landlady of the 
Bagot Arms pub <http://www.thebagotarmserdington.co.uk/> opposite the park. 
“Fireworks used to be something everyone around here looked forward to. It was 
really good for local businesses, too. We used to have a really good night in 
here on Bonfire night.”

Communities across the UK are facing the same unwillingness by civic bodies to 
stage Bonfire night celebrations. Some, likeBirmingham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham>, say that when they are making cuts 
they simply cannot afford it, while others balk at soaring insurance premiums.

Other organisations such as Rotary clubs are struggling with the same issues – 
plus the thorny old one that it is actually pretty easy to watch an organised 
firework display for free.

One result is that manufacturers of smaller “garden” fireworks are reporting 
booming sales – a worry for fire services, which would prefer Bonfire night 
events across a city to be contained in as few spaces as possible.


The decline of Pype Hayes has been a slow-burner. In 2011 the city council – 
the largest local authority in Europe – cancelled the bonfire 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-15270391bonfire>, citing 
budget cuts, but continued to provide fireworks. There was a popular 
Disney-themed night and one to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the 
first world war.


Last year the council called off Pype Hayes, but said it intended to find a 
private partner and would be back this time. No partner has been found and the 
event is off.

Cllr Ian Ward, deputy leader of the council, said: “Well publicised budget 
cuts mean Birmingham, like most local authorities, is facing significant 
financial pressures. As a result, we have to find partners to help fund our 
events – for example, the annual Frankfurt Christmas market in Birmingham is 
sponsored by Willmott Dixon.

“We were in talks with a partner about this year’s event, but we were unable 
to reach an agreement, so sadly the fireworks display at Pype Hayes will not 
take place this year.”

Ann Holtom, a Pype Hayes Lib Dem campaigner (and no fan of the 
Labour-controlled authority), does not hold back in her criticism. “This 
incompetent council is unable to find the money for a popular local event,” she 
said. “They say they haven’t been able to find a suitable private sponsor, but 
how hard have they actually been looking? So much for the council’s negotiating 
skills. No wonder our city finances are in such a mess.”

Carl Chinn, 
<http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/history/chinn-carl.aspx> professor 
of Birmingham community history at the University of Birmingham, said it was a 
pity that the Pype Hayes display was not taking place.

“It is sad. This was a really important community event that brought people 
together. These municipal bonfires were brought in so that people could enjoy 
fireworks safely. But the council’s funding has been drastically cut by central 
government and they have to find savings.”

The council was at pains to warn people that it is against the law to set off 
their own fireworks in the street – and suggested afireworks night at Edgbaston 
stadium <http://www.edgbaston.com/conference-events/fireworks/> as an 
alternative to Pype Hayes. But its event is not cheap. A family ticket is £18 
and a VIP ticket – which includes a warm private room with bar, hot dog and 
chips – is £16 per person.

Pype Hayes fireworks regular Jez Davies, a factory worker and father, was not 
impressed. “This was always our event. We had pride in it. I loved coming to 
Pype Hayes as a child and it was great to bring my kids here. It does seem a 
shame that a huge city like Birmingham can’t put on fireworks.”

Birmingham is by no means the only place where there are disappointed 
fireworks fans wondering what to do this weekend.

Ten thousand people attended the display in Walker park 
<https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/news-story/cancellation-fireworks-display-walker-park>
, Newcastle upon Tyne, last year. This year, for the first time since the start 
of the century, there will be no display.

David Wood, chairman of the Walker ward committee, explained that it cost 
£12,000 to put the display on, £4,000 of which went on safety. “We had a 
shortfall of £3,000 so thought it best to cancel this year.” Wood said 
commercial partners were still offering money, but less than previous years. 
“Everyone up here at least is feeling the effects of austerity,” he said.

The committee is planning to plough the money saved into CCTV cameras for the 
park and will try again next year to raise the money for a display.

In north Wales, Llandudno town council has had to cancel its annual display 
<https://www.facebook.com/llandudnofireworks/> at short notice after it was 
told it would have to pay at least £22,000 to insure the wonderful Victorian 
pier in case of a fire.

Greg Robbins, chairman of the fireworks sub-committee 
<http://www.llandudno.gov.uk/events-fireworks.html>, said: “We are very 
disappointed for the public that this display cannot now go ahead. It has not 
been possible to find an alternative location. We hope everyone stays safe.”

This year Liverpool city council has teamed up with Wirral council on the 
other side of the Mersey to stage an event calledRiver of Light 
<http://www.albertdock.com/river-of-light/>, which features music and circus 
performers as well as fireworks set off from three barges. But it means the 
loss of two traditional Liverpool fireworks displays in Newsham park and Sefton 
park. Many are expected to take in informal displays closer to home rather than 
venturing into town.

It is not only councils that are cancelling events. For more than three 
decades the Lions Club of Newbury in Berkshire has staged a Bonfire night event 
at the racecourse. But the cost of staging the event at such a prestigious 
venue has become too high, given that bad weather could scupper the whole thing 
anyway.It has called the display off and will try to find another venue next 
year. <http://www.newburylions.org.uk/news/fireworks-2016-cancelled/>

A more fundamental problem has led to the display at East Grinstead FC’s East 
Court ground being halted 
<http://www.kentlive.news/no-fireworks-display-in-east-grinstead-this-year/story-29822638-detail/story.html>
. It has run the show since Tony Blair came to power, but too many people had 
realised that if they tramped up the hill overlooking the ground they could 
watch for free.

Some large local authorities are still staging displays. Up to 80,000 people 
are expected to attendLewisham council’s display at Blackheath 
<http://www.lewisham.gov.uk/inmyarea/events/whats-on/fireworks/Pages/default.aspx>
. The event is free, although donations are requested.

London Fire Brigade in Greenwich gave the display its backing, tweeting: 
“Organised fireworks displays are far safer & much more fun, support Blackheath 
fireworks to keep it free and safe.”

Across the capital in Newham, the council is also putting on a free display 
<https://www.newham.gov.uk/Pages/Services/Guy-fawkes-night.aspx>. Lambeth, 
however, is not reviving its Brockwell park display.

 It decided to charge in 2014, but thousands of tickets went unsold and the 
event was cancelled last year.

Manchester, backed by local partners, is staging eight free events 
<http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/200109/council_news/7080/manchester_people_-_october_issue/4>
 and is proud of its offer.

Cllr Rosa Battle, the city council’s executive member for culture and leisure, 
said its Bonfire night displays have always been incredibly popular.

“We’re asking locals not to hold their own displays at home and are inviting 
them to join in the fun and save money by coming along to one of our organised 
displays. They are free, great fun, and you won’t annoy your neighbours.”
