Today in Campaign 2016

 * Donald Trump’s campaign chair in a prominent Ohio county has claimed there 
was “no racism” during the 1960s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/trump-ohio-campaign-chair-no-racism-before-obama>
 and said black people who have not succeeded over the past half-century only 
have themselves to blame. Kathy Miller, who is white and chair of the 
Republican nominee’s campaign in Mahoning County, made the remarks during a 
taped interview with the Guardian’sAnywhere but Washington series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/anywhere-but-washington> of 
election videos. 
 * “If you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s 
your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you,” Miller said.
 * She later resigned.

 * A few days before she faces Donald Trump in the first of the presidential 
debates, Hillary Clintontook the hot seat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/hillary-clinton-zach-galifianakis-between-two-ferns-trump>
 on on Zach Galifianakis’s Funny or Die web series Between Two Ferns. 
Galifianakis, reprising his dim and politically incorrect alter ego from 
previous episodes, opens by asking Clinton whether she was excited to be the 
first “girl president”, then follows up by reminding her that “for a younger, 
younger generation you will also become their first white president, so that’s 
pretty cool, too.” 
 * He also described Clinton’s style as that of a “librarian from outer space.”
 * Trump suggested tonight that Hillary Clinton bears responsibility 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/donald-trump-clinton-charlotte-unrest-philadelphia>
 for unrest that has followed police shootings of African Americans, saying she 
has “supported with a nod” the idea “that cops are a racist force to our 
society”. 
 * Clinton “shares directly in with the responsibility for the unrest that is 
afflicting our country,” Trump told a crowd of several thousand in suburban 
Philadelphia, while the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, braced for a third 
night of protests following a fatal police shooting of a black man.“Rioting in 
the streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens and it must be ended and it 
must be ended now,” Trump told to the almost entirely white crowd. The 
Republican nominee dismissed a brief protest against him as the result of a few 
“violent disrupters” and pledged: “I am with you and I will fight for you” to 
“law abiding African Americans”. 
 * A child’s letter to Barack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> asking for a young Syrian 
refugee to be resettled in his home has gone viral and been praised by the US 
president at the United Nations. “Remember the boy who was picked up by the 
ambulance in Syria? Can you please go get him and bring him to my home?”the 
letter 
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/09/21/six-year-olds-letter-president-we-will-give-him-family>
 from six-year-old Alex of Scarsdale, New York, began. “Park in the driveway or 
on the street and we will be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers, and 
balloons.” 
 * The letter was referring to Omran Daqneesh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/boy-in-the-ambulance-image-emerges-syrian-child-aleppo-rubble>
, the five-year-old boy who was filmed sitting dazed, bloodied and covered in 
dust after being pulled from the rubble of his home in Aleppo, Syria, last 
month.

Donald Trump’s improbable journey from reality television fixture to 
Republican presidential nominee - stop and read those words aloud to yourself 
and you’ll see what we mean - began the night of the 2011 White House 
Correspondents’ Dinner, according to Frontline.

That night - President Barack Obama famously read him for filth 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8TwRmX6zs4> after releasing his birth 
certificate, proving Trump’s longtime implication that he was not an American 
citizen to be a fraud - is when “Obama is starting something that I don’t know 
if he’ll be able to finish,” according to campaign advisor and former reality 
contestant Omarosa.

According to Omarosa, Trump’s campaign is a chance to “show them all” after 
being humiliated on the national stage.

“Every critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump,” 
Omarosa said. “It’s everyone who’s ever doubted Donald, who ever disagreed, who 
ever challenged him. It is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man 
in the universe.”

The Guardian’s Joanna Walters has more on Anthony Weiner being investigated 
for allegedly sending sexually explicit texts to an underage girl:

Disgraced former US congressman Anthony Weiner is being investigated by the 
New York police department and also reportedly by the federal authorities after
reports 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/anthony-weiner-latest-sexting-scandal-probed-nypd-article-1.2802042>
 emerged that he was allegedly conducting an online sexual relationship with a 
15-year-old in another state earlier this year.


Weiner, whose career previously nosedived after he was caught sending sexually 
explicit texts and images 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/07/anthony-weiner-twitter-pictures-new-york>
 to women while he was still married, allegedly spent several months this year 
in highly explicit exchanges with the 15-year-old girl.


The former politician and failed New York mayoral candidate asked her to 
undress for him during a video call and engage in rape fantasies among a 
plethora of explicit exchanges that began in January 2016, the Daily Mail
reported 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html#ixzz4Ku5mkVQq>
 on Wednesday.

Weiner is still married to Huma Abedin, Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton’s longtime aide and campaign vice-chairman, although the two 
are now separated.

A spokesman for the NYPD <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nypd> confirmed 
on Thursday afternoon that Weiner, 51, who lives in the city, was under 
investigation.

“We are aware of the allegations against him and we are looking into it,” the 
spokesman said, without releasing any further details.

The girl in question had given a lengthy interview, accompanied by her father, 
to the Daily Mail and provided pictures and other records of messages she says 
she exchanged with Weiner.

Nigel Farage calls Hillary Clinton 'a truly awful candidate'

Former Ukip chief Nigel Farage, who has swapped a career engineering the 
United Kingdom’s exit from politico-economic unions to supporting Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump, told Lou Dobbs tonight that he thinksHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is the worst 
candidate he’s ever seen.

“I was always told that it was a very good thing in life to be judged by your 
enemies, and if Mrs. Clinton is now my avowed, sworn enemy, I must be getting 
something right,” Farage told the Fox Business anchor, launching into a 
critique of “political elites” that has made him a favorite of Trump’s.

Clinton “represents a kind of politics,” Farage said, “that pretends at 
election time that it represents ordinary folk and their aspirations, but 
actually is about self. So I think that Hillary Clinton is a truly awful 
candidate - frankly, I think, the worst I have ever seen in the States. And if 
she were to win this presidency, all the same bad old things would just 
continue.”

The anti-EU British politician and former Ukip leader has not officially 
endorsed Trump formally, but arecent appearance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/nigel-farage-donald-trump-rally-hillary-clinton>
 at a Trump rally in Jackson, Mississippi, left little doubt about the 
anti-establishment Farage’s stance on the American presidential election.

“We reached those people who have never voted in their lives but believed by 
going out and voting for Brexit they could take back control of their country, 
take back control of their borders and get back their pride and self-respect,” 
Farage said at the time of the successful campaign to separate the UK from the 
European Union, calling Trump, like Brexit, “for the little people, for the 
real people.”

Two-term North Carolina congressman Robert Pittenger has apologized for 
telling the BBC today that civil unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, after the 
shooting of 43-year-oldKeith Scott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database#keith-scott-2016796>
 is due to jealousy.

“They hate white people because white people are successful and they’re not,” 
Pittenger said at the time.

“What is taking place in my hometown right now breaks my heart,” Pittenger 
said in a statement after his comments were condemned by both Republicans and 
Democrats. “My anguish led me to respond to a reporter’s question in a way that 
I regret. The answer doesn’t reflect who I am. I was quoting statements made by 
angry protesters last night on national TV. My intent was to discuss the lack 
of economic mobility for African americans because of failed policies. I 
apologize to those I offended and hope that we can bring peace and calm to 
Charlotte.”

Donald Trump's private airline pockets $1.6m from Secret Service

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has benefitted from campaign 
expenditures at his hotels, clubs and other corporations to the tune of $8m 
over the course of his presidential campaign, but anew analysis of campaign 
finance information from Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-secret-service-campaign-travel-payments-228553>
 shows that his business empire is now making money off of more than his donors 
- they’re profiting from American taxpayers, as well.

FEC filings show that the Secret Service, tasked with protecting Trump and his 
family since November of last year, has paid $1.6m to Trump’s private airline 
to compensate for the cost of flying its agents on his plane since his 
protection began. The agency typically makes such reimbursements to campaigns, 
but those expenses are traditionally paid to third-party airlines and aviation 
providers, not to the candidate’s company itself.

The Secret Service has reimbursed Hillary Clinton’s campaign to the tune of 
$2.6m, for example - but Clinton’s planes are chartered from a third-party 
company that Clinton has no financial stake in, unlike Trump’s TAG Air, Inc., 
which is owned by the candidate.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, speaking at a 
campaign rally in Chester, Pennsylvania, tells the audience that he is the only 
candidate who will be able to steer the American economy.

“If Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> gets 
in, here’s your chances of recovery: zero, zero zero,” Trump said. “Jobs are 
going to come flowing back to America. It used to be that cars were made in 
Flint, and you couldn’t drink the water. Cars were made in Flint and you 
couldn’t make the water where? Mexico!”

“And now, it’s very sad. Today the cars are made in Mexico, and you can’t 
drink the water in Flint! How bad! How bad is it, though? How sad!”

Speaking to supporters at a rally in Chester, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> emphasized “safety” as a key 
part of his plan to “make America great again.”

“People are starting to get nervous, folks!” Trump said. “We’re going to win 
the White House - we’re going to take it back!”

“We’re going to make America safe again,” Trump told the cheering crowd. “The 
rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens, and it must be 
ended, and ended now.”

“The main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African 
Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children 
in safety and peace and with a good education,” Trump said, of civil unrest in 
Charlotte, North Carolina, after the fatal shooting by police of an African 
American man. “And we’re gonna give that to them!”

“I am with you, and I will fight for you - I promise!”

Donald Trump’s eldest son has reiterated the content of a tweet from earlier 
this week in which he declared that Muslim refugees rape European children on a 
daily basis.

The (false) claims were made in a Facebook Live interview with a Salt Lake 
City CBS affiliate, in whichDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> Jr. was asked to defend his 
father’s proposed ban on refugees from Syria and other Muslim countries.

“I think its an important thing, but I think we also have to be able to vet 
people who are coming in to our country,” Trump Jr. said, in response to 
concerns about his father’s proposal.

“If you look at what’s happened in Europe as it relates to the migrant flows, 
you know, and you’re hearing about young children being raped daily, and you’re 
looking at countries that were very good and peaceful countries, the statistics 
are going through the roof in terms of those kind of attacks - we just have to 
be intelligent with what we’re doing,” Trump Jr. continued.

Trump Jr. had tweeted a Breitbart News article from earlier in the week making 
similar claims of a “rape epidemic” following the admission of refugees from 
the Syrian civil war:

Donald Trump’s campaign has issued a statement attacking disgraced former 
congressman Anthony Weiner for giving $550 to Hillary Clinton’s presidential 
campaign:

The announcement by the FBI and New York Police Department that they are 
investigating close Clinton ally Anthony Weiner’s inappropriate relationship 
with an under-aged female is extremely disturbing. The Clinton campaign should 
immediately return all campaign contributions from Weiner. America has had 
enough of the sleaze that is Clinton, Inc.


Trump himself has donated a cumulative $4,750 to Weiner’s campaigns.

North Carolina congressman says Charlotte protestors 'hate white people 
because white people are successful and they’re not'

Two-term North Carolina congressman Robert Pittenger told the BBC today that 
civil unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, after the shooting of 43-year-old
Keith Scott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database#keith-scott-2016796>
 is due to jealousy.

“They hate white people because white people are successful and they’re not,” 
Pittenger said.

“The grievance in their minds – the animus, the anger – they hate white people 
because white people are successful and they’re not,” were the congressman’s 
exact words, blaming the so-called hatred, in part, on welfare.

“It is a welfare state. We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, and 
we’ve put people in bondage, so they can’t be all they’re capable of being.”

Anthony Weiner's cellular records subpoenaed by US attorney

Disgraced former congressman and onetime New York mayoral candidate Anthony 
Weiner’s cell phone records have been subpoenaed by US Attorney Preet Bharara’s 
office this afternoon, the Guardian has confirmed.

Weiner, the husband of longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, is the 
subject of preliminary investigations by the FBI and the New York Police 
Department after the Daily Mail reported that he had exchangedsexually explicit 
messages 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/anthony-weiner-sexually-explicit-messages-teen-daily-mail>
 with an underage girl via various social media platforms.

Weiner was once seen as a rising star in the Democratic party, but his 
political future imploded after he wascaught sending sexually explicit texts 
and images 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/07/anthony-weiner-twitter-pictures-new-york>
 to young women while he was still married in multiple scandals that spanned 
years. The most recent chapter of the behavior led to Abedinannouncing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-sexting-twitter-scandal>
 in August that she was separating from her husband after Weiner wasrevealed in 
another report 
<http://nypost.com/2016/08/28/anthony-weiner-sexted-busty-brunette-while-his-son-was-in-bed-with-him/>
 to have sent another woman a provocative picture of himself in his underwear, 
with his young son next to him.

Weiner asked the underage girl to undress for him and engage in rape fantasies 
in a series of messages that began in January 2016, the Daily Mailreported

 * Donald Trump’s campaign chair in a prominent Ohio county has claimed there 
was “no racism” during the 1960s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/trump-ohio-campaign-chair-no-racism-before-obama>
 and said black people who have not succeeded over the past half-century only 
have themselves to blame. Kathy Miller, who is white and chair of the 
Republican nominee’s campaign in Mahoning County, made the remarks during a 
taped interview with the Guardian’sAnywhere but Washington series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/anywhere-but-washington> of 
election videos. 
 * “If you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s 
your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you,” Miller said.
 * She later resigned.

 * A few days before she faces Donald Trump in the first of the presidential 
debates, Hillary Clintontook the hot seat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/hillary-clinton-zach-galifianakis-between-two-ferns-trump>
 on on Zach Galifianakis’s Funny or Die web series Between Two Ferns. 
Galifianakis, reprising his dim and politically incorrect alter ego from 
previous episodes, opens by asking Clinton whether she was excited to be the 
first “girl president”, then follows up by reminding her that “for a younger, 
younger generation you will also become their first white president, so that’s 
pretty cool, too.” 
 * He also described Clinton’s style as that of a “librarian from outer space.”
 * Trump suggested tonight that Hillary Clinton bears responsibility 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/donald-trump-clinton-charlotte-unrest-philadelphia>
 for unrest that has followed police shootings of African Americans, saying she 
has “supported with a nod” the idea “that cops are a racist force to our 
society”. 
 * Clinton “shares directly in with the responsibility for the unrest that is 
afflicting our country,” Trump told a crowd of several thousand in suburban 
Philadelphia, while the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, braced for a third 
night of protests following a fatal police shooting of a black man.“Rioting in 
the streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens and it must be ended and it 
must be ended now,” Trump told to the almost entirely white crowd. The 
Republican nominee dismissed a brief protest against him as the result of a few 
“violent disrupters” and pledged: “I am with you and I will fight for you” to 
“law abiding African Americans”. 
 * A child’s letter to Barack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> asking for a young Syrian 
refugee to be resettled in his home has gone viral and been praised by the US 
president at the United Nations. “Remember the boy who was picked up by the 
ambulance in Syria? Can you please go get him and bring him to my home?”the 
letter 
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/09/21/six-year-olds-letter-president-we-will-give-him-family>
 from six-year-old Alex of Scarsdale, New York, began. “Park in the driveway or 
on the street and we will be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers, and 
balloons.” 
 * The letter was referring to Omran Daqneesh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/boy-in-the-ambulance-image-emerges-syrian-child-aleppo-rubble>
, the five-year-old boy who was filmed sitting dazed, bloodied and covered in 
dust after being pulled from the rubble of his home in Aleppo, Syria, last 
month.

Trump is running for president to “show them all” after being humiliated at 
the WHCD in 2011, according to Omarosa.https://t.co/OiueLwoLaA

Donald Trump’s improbable journey from reality television fixture to 
Republican presidential nominee - stop and read those words aloud to yourself 
and you’ll see what we mean - began the night of the 2011 White House 
Correspondents’ Dinner, according to Frontline.

That night - President Barack Obama famously read him for filth 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8TwRmX6zs4> after releasing his birth 
certificate, proving Trump’s longtime implication that he was not an American 
citizen to be a fraud - is when “Obama is starting something that I don’t know 
if he’ll be able to finish,” according to campaign advisor and former reality 
contestant Omarosa.

According to Omarosa, Trump’s campaign is a chance to “show them all” after 
being humiliated on the national stage.

“Every critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump,” 
Omarosa said. “It’s everyone who’s ever doubted Donald, who ever disagreed, who 
ever challenged him. It is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man 
in the universe.”
 
The Guardian’s Joanna Walters has more on Anthony Weiner being investigated 
for allegedly sending sexually explicit texts to an underage girl:

Disgraced former US congressman Anthony Weiner is being investigated by the 
New York police department and also reportedly by the federal authorities after
reports 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/anthony-weiner-latest-sexting-scandal-probed-nypd-article-1.2802042>
 emerged that he was allegedly conducting an online sexual relationship with a 
15-year-old in another state earlier this year.


Weiner, whose career previously nosedived after he was caught sending sexually 
explicit texts and images 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/07/anthony-weiner-twitter-pictures-new-york>
 to women while he was still married, allegedly spent several months this year 
in highly explicit exchanges with the 15-year-old girl.


The former politician and failed New York mayoral candidate asked her to 
undress for him during a video call and engage in rape fantasies among a 
plethora of explicit exchanges that began in January 2016, the Daily Mail
reported 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html#ixzz4Ku5mkVQq>
 on Wednesday.

Weiner is still married to Huma Abedin, Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton’s longtime aide and campaign vice-chairman, although the two 
are now separated.

A spokesman for the NYPD <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nypd> confirmed 
on Thursday afternoon that Weiner, 51, who lives in the city, was under 
investigation.

“We are aware of the allegations against him and we are looking into it,” the 
spokesman said, without releasing any further details.

The girl in question had given a lengthy interview, accompanied by her father, 
to the Daily Mail and provided pictures and other records of messages she says 
she exchanged with Weiner.

Former Ukip chief Nigel Farage, who has swapped a career engineering the 
United Kingdom’s exit from politico-economic unions to supporting Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump, told Lou Dobbs tonight that he thinksHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is the worst 
candidate he’s ever seen.

“I was always told that it was a very good thing in life to be judged by your 
enemies, and if Mrs. Clinton is now my avowed, sworn enemy, I must be getting 
something right,” Farage told the Fox Business anchor, launching into a 
critique of “political elites” that has made him a favorite of Trump’s.

Clinton “represents a kind of politics,” Farage said, “that pretends at 
election time that it represents ordinary folk and their aspirations, but 
actually is about self. So I think that Hillary Clinton is a truly awful 
candidate - frankly, I think, the worst I have ever seen in the States. And if 
she were to win this presidency, all the same bad old things would just 
continue.”

The anti-EU British politician and former Ukip leader has not officially 
endorsed Trump formally, but arecent appearance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/nigel-farage-donald-trump-rally-hillary-clinton>
 at a Trump rally in Jackson, Mississippi, left little doubt about the 
anti-establishment Farage’s stance on the American presidential election.

“We reached those people who have never voted in their lives but believed by 
going out and voting for Brexit they could take back control of their country, 
take back control of their borders and get back their pride and self-respect,” 
Farage said at the time of the successful campaign to separate the UK from the 
European Union, calling Trump, like Brexit, “for the little people, for the 
real people.”
 
Two-term North Carolina congressman Robert Pittenger has apologized for 
telling the BBC today that civil unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, after the 
shooting of 43-year-oldKeith Scott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database#keith-scott-2016796>
 is due to jealousy.

“They hate white people because white people are successful and they’re not,” 
Pittenger said at the time.

“What is taking place in my hometown right now breaks my heart,” Pittenger 
said in a statement after his comments were condemned by both Republicans and 
Democrats. “My anguish led me to respond to a reporter’s question in a way that 
I regret. The answer doesn’t reflect who I am. I was quoting statements made by 
angry protesters last night on national TV. My intent was to discuss the lack 
of economic mobility for African americans because of failed policies. I 
apologize to those I offended and hope that we can bring peace and calm to 
Charlotte.”
 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has benefitted from campaign 
expenditures at his hotels, clubs and other corporations to the tune of $8m 
over the course of his presidential campaign, but anew analysis of campaign 
finance information from Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-secret-service-campaign-travel-payments-228553>
 shows that his business empire is now making money off of more than his donors 
- they’re profiting from American taxpayers, as well.

FEC filings show that the Secret Service, tasked with protecting Trump and his 
family since November of last year, has paid $1.6m to Trump’s private airline 
to compensate for the cost of flying its agents on his plane since his 
protection began. The agency typically makes such reimbursements to campaigns, 
but those expenses are traditionally paid to third-party airlines and aviation 
providers, not to the candidate’s company itself.

The Secret Service has reimbursed Hillary Clinton’s campaign to the tune of 
$2.6m, for example - but Clinton’s planes are chartered from a third-party 
company that Clinton has no financial stake in, unlike Trump’s TAG Air, Inc., 
which is owned by the candidate.
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, speaking at a 
campaign rally in Chester, Pennsylvania, tells the audience that he is the only 
candidate who will be able to steer the American economy.

“If Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> gets 
in, here’s your chances of recovery: zero, zero zero,” Trump said. “Jobs are 
going to come flowing back to America. It used to be that cars were made in 
Flint, and you couldn’t drink the water. Cars were made in Flint and you 
couldn’t make the water where? Mexico!”

“And now, it’s very sad. Today the cars are made in Mexico, and you can’t 
drink the water in Flint! How bad! How bad is it, though? How sad!”
 
Donald Trump, on African American voters:

Clinton doesn’t want to hear their voices, she doesn’t want to hear their 
voices, so I will be their voice - I will be the voice for all forgotten 
Americans in this country. I will be your voice.
 
Speaking to supporters at a rally in Chester, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> emphasized “safety” as a key 
part of his plan to “make America great again.”

“People are starting to get nervous, folks!” Trump said. “We’re going to win 
the White House - we’re going to take it back!”

“We’re going to make America safe again,” Trump told the cheering crowd. “The 
rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens, and it must be 
ended, and ended now.”

“The main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African 
Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children 
in safety and peace and with a good education,” Trump said, of civil unrest in 
Charlotte, North Carolina, after the fatal shooting by police of an African 
American man. “And we’re gonna give that to them!”

“I am with you, and I will fight for you - I promise!”
 
Watch it live here:
 
Donald Trump’s eldest son has reiterated the content of a tweet from earlier 
this week in which he declared that Muslim refugees rape European children on a 
daily basis.

The (false) claims were made in a Facebook Live interview with a Salt Lake 
City CBS affiliate, in whichDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> Jr. was asked to defend his 
father’s proposed ban on refugees from Syria and other Muslim countries.

“I think its an important thing, but I think we also have to be able to vet 
people who are coming in to our country,” Trump Jr. said, in response to 
concerns about his father’s proposal.

“If you look at what’s happened in Europe as it relates to the migrant flows, 
you know, and you’re hearing about young children being raped daily, and you’re 
looking at countries that were very good and peaceful countries, the statistics 
are going through the roof in terms of those kind of attacks - we just have to 
be intelligent with what we’re doing,” Trump Jr. continued.

Trump Jr. had tweeted a Breitbart News article from earlier in the week making 
similar claims of a “rape epidemic” following the admission of refugees from 
the Syrian civil war:

Donald Trump’s campaign has issued a statement attacking disgraced former 
congressman Anthony Weiner for giving $550 to Hillary Clinton’s presidential 
campaign:

The announcement by the FBI and New York Police Department that they are 
investigating close Clinton ally Anthony Weiner’s inappropriate relationship 
with an under-aged female is extremely disturbing. The Clinton campaign should 
immediately return all campaign contributions from Weiner. America has had 
enough of the sleaze that is Clinton, Inc.


Trump himself has donated a cumulative $4,750 to Weiner’s campaigns.

“The grievance in their minds – the animus, the anger – they hate white people 
because white people are successful and they’re not,” were the congressman’s 
exact words, blaming the so-called hatred, in part, on welfare.

“It is a welfare state. We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, and 
we’ve put people in bondage, so they can’t be all they’re capable of being.”
 
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign has announced the creation of a Catholic 
advisory council, geared at focusing onissues and policies 
<http://email.donaldjtrump.com/t/r-l-ydjktjn-ddckjdkiu-y/> important to 
Catholic voters.

“On the issues and policies of greatest concern to Catholics, Donald Trump 
will fight for Catholics whereasHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is openly hostile to 
those issue of greatest concern to Catholics and will attack the core teachings 
of the Catholic Church, and has worked against them as First Lady, as US 
Senator and as Secretary of State, and would continue to do so if she is 
elected President,” said congressman Sean Duffy.


Trump, who once engaged in a prolonged feud with Pope Francis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/18/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-wall-mexico-border>
, is currently supported bya mere 32%

Catholics.

Disgraced former congressman and onetime New York mayoral candidate Anthony 
Weiner’s cell phone records have been subpoenaed by US Attorney Preet Bharara’s 
office this afternoon, the Guardian has confirmed.

Weiner, the husband of longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, is the 
subject of preliminary investigations by the FBI and the New York Police 
Department after the Daily Mail reported that he had exchangedsexually explicit 
messages 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/anthony-weiner-sexually-explicit-messages-teen-daily-mail>
 with an underage girl via various social media platforms.

Weiner was once seen as a rising star in the Democratic party, but his 
political future imploded after he wascaught sending sexually explicit texts 
and images 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/07/anthony-weiner-twitter-pictures-new-york>
 to young women while he was still married in multiple scandals that spanned 
years. The most recent chapter of the behavior led to Abedinannouncing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-sexting-twitter-scandal>
 in August that she was separating from her husband after Weiner wasrevealed in 
another report 
<http://nypost.com/2016/08/28/anthony-weiner-sexted-busty-brunette-while-his-son-was-in-bed-with-him/>
 to have sent another woman a provocative picture of himself in his underwear, 
with his young son next to him.

Weiner asked the underage girl to undress for him and engage in rape fantasies 
in a series of messages that began in January 2016, the Daily Mailreported
