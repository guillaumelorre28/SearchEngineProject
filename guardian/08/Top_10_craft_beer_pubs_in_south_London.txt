Hop Burns & Black, East Dulwich, and The Beer Shop, Nunhead


A mile apart, these two idiosyncratic venues are definitely worth checking out 
if you are in south-east London. Hop Burns & Black is a shop as well as a bar. 
It stocks some 300 bottled beers, as well as hot sauces and vintage vinyl. But 
it is also a shop with a limited amount of indoor and outdoor seating, so that 
people can kick back with a drink while they consider their purchases. 
Naturally, HB&B has a substantial core range of London beers, from such outfits 
as Big Smoke, Howling Hops, London Beer Lab and Gipsy Hill, whose Beatnik pale 
ale is, for a 3.8% beer, a remarkably tasty and well-rounded creation. 
Elsewhere, its stock ranges far and wide but remains classy throughout. 
Selections from Manchester’s excellent Cloudwater and Danes Mikkeller jumped 
out.

 The Beer Shop. Photograph: Lisa Jane Photography 
Definitely more bar than shop, the Beer Shop is a tiny, friendly micropub – 
all utilitarian and rough-hewn wooden fixtures adorned with colourful cushions 
– that serves keg and bottled beers and gravity-dispenses cask ales from, 
almost exclusively, UK brewers. Expat northerners looking for their fix of 
Wylam, Blackjack, Mad Hatter or Squawk beers will find such breweries well 
represented here, alongside the cream of the UK craft crop, from Sussex’s
Burning Sky <http://www.burningskybeer.com/> to Bristol’s Wiper & True 
<http://wiperandtrue.com/>. Having ventured this far off the Tube map, if you 
want to extend your crawl, have a look at theFlying Pig 
<http://www.theflyingpiglondon.com/> (58-60 East Dulwich Road, 020-7732 7575), 
just up the road from Hop Burns & Black, and, in Nunhead, the community-runIvy 
House <http://ivyhousenunhead.com/>, a Grade II-listed craft beer haven (40 
Stuart Road, 020-7277 8233) with a variety of live music and activities from 
yoga to knitting and chess.

This small London chain has two venues in south-west London (74-76 Battersea 
Bridge Road and 94 Northcote Road, between Clapham and Wandsworth commons), and 
a huge venue by Tower Bridge, which provides a lifeline for picky tourists. The 
choice across four cask, 14 keg taps and an extensive bottled menu, runs the 
gamut from a daily, £2.90-a-pint, real ale (on this visit,Little Beer 
Corporation <http://littlebeer.co.uk/>’s Little Tenderness), to obscure and 
expensive sharing bottles, such as a 2012 bottle of barrel-aged Rodenbach 
Vintage – yours for £24.95. The Draft Houses tend to be loud, lively spaces, 
which will not suit everyone, but the young staff are usually knowledgeable and 
enthusiastic. They know their hops. Note: Drhop Kick, the commemorative Six 
Nations beer the Draft House has created withFourpure <http://www.fourpure.com/>
, is a stridently bitter beer full of gooseberry and ripe honeydew melon 
flavours and worth a try during the tournament.

Perched on the edge of foodie utopia Borough Market, The Rake was one of 
London’s craft beer pioneers and in its 10th year, this small, spartan bar – 
its walls covered in graffiti added by visiting brewers – remains a vital hop 
hub. By modern standards, seven keg and three cask lines do not constitute an 
enormous choice, but whether it is Lefebvre’sBarbãr Bok 
<http://www.brasserielefebvre.be/en/product/4/barbar-bok#/product/resized/4_barbarbrn-bouteille-et-verre-pt.jpg>
 winter ale or beers from the Rake’s spin-off brewpub, Tap East, you will 
always find something good and unusual on the bar. Its fridges, likewise, 
contain a wealth of first-rate beers, as diverse as sharing rarities from 
Colorado’sLeft Hand Brewing <http://lefthandbrewing.com/> and cans from 
Cornwall’sHarbour <https://www.harbourbrewing.com>. The Rake hosts a 
meet-the-brewer with Hebden Bridge brewerVocation 
<http://www.vocationbrewery.com/> on 25 February and its annual Welsh beer 
festival is on 3-6 March.

Over in Bethnal Green, the Tanner’s sister bar, Mother Kelly’s, has become a 
site of pilgrimage for the capital’s craft connoisseurs. The choice in this 
neat, modest corner boozer (14 draught lines and around 20 bottles) is much 
smaller, but there is a distinctive focus on local London breweries. One tap is 
dedicated to kernel beers and, on this visit, Bermondsey’s Brew By Numbers, 
Peckham’s Brick, Woolwich’s Hop Stuff and Walworth’s Orbit were among the other 
draught choices. Somewhat tucked away from any main drag, the Tanner is known 
as a relatively chilled bolthole. You may find yourself staying longer than you 
anticipated.

 Brew by Numbers, Bermondsey. Photograph: Gavin Freeborn 
The past two years has seen an explosion in the number of breweries that also 
operate as ad hoc taps. In railway arches and on industrial estates across the 
UK, it is now common to find craft beer fans congregating to drink from 
temporary bars squeezed between the finishing tanks and the bottling line. 
Arguably, this all started with the Bermondsey Beer Mile, where up to six 
breweries and several beer retailers open each weekend around Druid Street. The 
route gets very busy (so busy that theKernel brewery 
<http://www.thekernelbrewery.com> has stopped opening) but, if you want to 
drink immaculately fresh or limited edition experimental beers in great numbers 
and often at bargain prices, the Bermondsey Beer Mile is the place to do it. 
The main locations are cask-focusedSouthwark Brewing

 Beers brewed onsite at Ubrew, Bermondsey, London 
Also part of the Bermondsey Mile, Ubrew is unusual in this group for a number 
of reasons. It is open all week (except Mondays) and, hidden away on a business 
park off Old Jamaica Road, it operates both as a bar and an open-access 
brewery, where the public can pay to use its brewing equipment. Hardcore beer 
geeks will love all this, not least the choice of 10 high-quality keg beers at 
the bar and Ubrew’s selection of experimental bottled ales, such as Billionaire 
Stout and Donald Chump, which are brewed onsite. Ubrew also hosts irregular 
launches for new beers and magazines, as well as homebrewing and 
meet-the-brewer evenings.

In this quaint corner pub round the corner from Tower Bridge, there is a 
central reservation where you can rest your pint, into which various breweries’ 
beer mats have been set in Perspex and inlaid. That decorative flourish 
illustrates how seriously the Dean Swift takes its ale. The pub’s four cask and 
nine keg taps and its modest fridges are packed with stellar brews from both 
London breweries (Kernel, Beavertown, Fourpure, etc), and British craft 
flag-wavers, such as Welsh wondersTiny Rebel <http://www.tinyrebel.co.uk/> and 
West Yorkshire’sSummer Wine <http://www.summerwinebrewery.co.uk/>. There are 
some rare international gems on offer too, including, on this visit, bottles 
from revered US gypsy brewer,Stillwater Artisanal 
<http://www.stillwater-artisanal.com/>. Whoever does the buying at the Dean 
Swift is clearly a stickler for quality.

Based in a converted Victorian slaughterhouse in Penge, Late Knights brewery 
only launched in 2013 but it has rapidly established itself as one of south 
London’s most dynamic craft beer evangelists. It owns four bars in south-east 
London, including this Peckham cracker, and sites in Brockley, Sydenham and 
Gipsy Hill. As dark and aesthetically grungy as any East Berlin dive bar, Beer 
Rebellion serves 10 keg and six cask ales with, naturally, an emphasis on its 
own Late Knights ales. I opted forPartizan’s intriguing lemon and thyme grisette
 <http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/partizan-saison-grisette-lemon-thyme/254676/>, 
but the wider choice takes in most of the key London breweries, including 
Anspach & Hobday, Beavertown and Peckham neighbourBrick 
<http://www.brickbrewery.co.uk/>, whose railway arch brewery opens as a weekend 
tap (Arch 209, Blenheim Grove, Thurs 5-9pm, Fri 5-10pm, Sat 12-10pm).

impressive beer range, with 13 keg and seven cask lines supplemented by a long, 
bound bottled menu. In both cases, you will encounter discerning choices from 
near and far. UK craft pacesetters such as Wild Beer, Moor, Beavertown and Brew 
By Numbers rub shoulders with swanky international beers such asOmnipollo’s 
Mazarin 
<http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/omnipollo-mazarin-oatmeal-pale-ale/170159/> 
oatmeal pale ale orGreen Flash <http://www.greenflashbrew.com/beer/>’s 
legendary West Coast imperial IPA. Interestingly, in a sector where prices are 
skyrocketing, there are some bargains to be had at the C&A. Pricing strong cask 
beers such as Red Willow’s 5.9% Shameless and Wiper & True’s 6.9% White Cloud 
IPA at £4 and £4.50 respectively shows admirable restraint. That may help 
explain why, on this early Thursday evening visit, this large, spruce, 
neo-Victorian beer house was already packed.

If you have visited one of London’s Craft Beer Co bars, you will know what to 
expect: plain modern decor, rafts of fantastic beer, irregular tap-takeover and 
launch events. The quality of the house beers in its small Brixton branch is 
impeccable; thinkSiren’s Soundwave 
<http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/siren-soundwave/204306/> and Five Points Railway 
Porter <http://fivepointsbrewing.co.uk/beer/railway-porter/>, while, on this 
visit, the guest beers (for instance, Cigar City’s Cracker wit or Birranova’s 
Italian take on a strong English ale,Abboccato 
<http://www.birraartigianalepugliese.it/portfolio/item/abboccata/>), included 
several imports that would have any craft geek drooling. Basically, across its 
24 taps and an extensive bottled menu, you can get a good snapshot of all that 
is currently great in beer globally. Incidentally, Brixton Craft Beer Co is 
close toBrixton Brewery <>, which opens as a tap on Saturday afternoons (Arch 
547, Brixton Station Road, 020-3609 8880, 12-4pm).

Stormbird, Camberwell


Nothing quite sets a beer geek’s pulse racing like the sight of hand-drawn 
pump clips at the bar. Only rare imports and much sought-after, limited-edition 
beers can afford to forgo the usual point-of-sale paraphernalia and you will 
find many such beers at Stormbird. For instance, on this visit,Mikkeller’s 
Nuclear Hop Assault 
<http://shop.mikkeller.dk/shop/beer/to-ol/nuclear-hop-assault-thrash-metal-pack-2/>
, Magic Rock andToccalmatto’s Custard Pie  
<http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/magic-rock--toccalmatto-custard-pie/243556/>and 
To ØL’s Nelson Survin <http://to-ol.dk/shop/product/nelson-survin/>. The choice 
here is vast: 22 taps and over 100 bottles and cans. Stormbird serves no fewer 
than five gluten-free beers, has a whole fridge section given over to Moor’s 
new conditioned cans and, if you have cash to splash, you can share 750ml 
bottles from US breweries such as Jack’s Abbey and Moylan’s. The bar itself is 
a simple space – wooden floor, big, stripped communal tables – but with such 
exceptional beer on offer, Stormbird has charisma to spare.
