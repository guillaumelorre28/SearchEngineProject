Middlesex are gathering in front of the pavilion, where they’ll be presented 
with the trophy.Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are 
walking around the ground, thanking their fans. Time for me to shut down, pack 
up, and slink off in search of a pint of cider. So long everyone, sorry for the 
typos, and thanks so much for making the Guardian’s live blog such a great 
place to follow the county game this season.

Well, if nothing else, I’m glad for my colleague and friend Mike Selvey, who 
is busy writing his final report for the Guardian even as I type this. It’s a 
fitting way for him to finish, given how much of his career he spent playing 
here for the Middle Saxons, as he likes to call them. It’s their first 
championship title since 1993. As forSomerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset>, well, as Andrew Benton says 
“there’s always next year”. They’ve been saying that for 125 years now.

34th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 173-6 (Hodd 
14, Rafiq 4) need 240

“So what are the odds that I get to talking cricket with the guy running the 
cars concession at the Autumn Fair in Ekenäs, Finland (yes,that Ekenäs, home to 
Ekenäs CC of OBO and the OBOccasionals matchup glory) yesterday?” asks Sara 
Torvalds. “OK, reasonable, I suppose, as he was of Indian descent. He tried to 
turn the conversation to NZ in India, but I had to confess I’d had no time for 
that series, what with the County Championship going down to the wire. That 
surprised and delighted him no end, though. He was particularly surprised to 
find me rooting for Somerset, so I had to confess my love for Marcus 
Trescothick (one day Iwill see him play live!), but what are the odds the guy 
himselflives in Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> (when 
he’s not out and about letting kids ride the bumper cars)!? Surely those odds 
are enough to secure the necessary draw at Lord’s, right? Right?!”

33rd over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 172-6 (Hodd 
14, Rafiq 3) need 240

All of a sudden, things feel a little different. Forget about the runs needed, 
for a moment, the more pertinent point is thatMiddlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> need four wickets to win the 
championship. “Nothing for Yorkshire to lose now,” points out John Leavey, “3rd 
if they lose, 3rd if they draw. Unless they hate the southerners more than the 
south-westerners!” Hodd cuts the ball just past slip.

WICKET! Gale 22 b Roland-Jones

Gale is bowled, off the bottom-edge I think, as he swings a pull shot across 
the line.
 Another Yorkshire wicket goes as Gale is bowled by Toby Roland-Jones.

32nd over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 160-5 (Gale 
22, Hodd 5) need 240

I’m told that the Somerset players are on the outfield at Taunton, trying to 
kill the final few minutes before they find out whether or not they’ve won the 
title. They can’t bear to watch. “Do you think there is a point at which 
Yorkshire will decide they can’t win and settle for a draw just to stopMiddlesex
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> from winning?” asks Vinny 
Raghavan. My guess is that they’re committed to it, now, one way or another.

Hodd swings and misses. Then gets a single to mid-wicket. There are now just 
nine overs to go, Yorkshire still need another 84 runs,Middlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> another five wickets. Cross your

30th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 149-4 
(Bresnan 55, Gale 20) need 240

Bresnan batters another four. Word reaches Lord’s from the Rose Bowl. Here’s 
Paul Weaver: “TheHampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> 
supporters are drifting away and Lancashire must be well into their survival 
celebrations by now. Durham lost their second wicket when Stoneman gloved one 
from Dawson to Tom Alsop at short leg and just now Graham Clark was stumped as 
he went down the wicket to Crane. But Durham are 259 for three and need just 37 
off 11 with Ben Stokes the new man.”

29th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 147-4 
(Bresnan 50, Gale 19) need 240

Gale got hold of that one, a shortish ball from Finn, which he pulled to 
mid-wicket for four. Yorkshire now need 99 to win, from 70 balls. Four more, 
off Gale’s thigh pad. Ali has just reminded me that Gale and Bresnan are 
brothers-in-law, making this a family affair. Bresnan brings up his fifty, what 
a match he’s having.

Gale has a yahoo at Roland-Jones’ second delivery, and doesn’t get near it. He 
connects with a crisp cut for a single later in the over though, and we now 
have 12 overs to go.

“I take it back,” Ali adds, as Gale steps to leg and hammers a glorious four 
through cover. This impromptu OBO party has just become a little more official, 
because we’ve had an email in from Gary Naylor: “There are some people who will 
never feel the way we feel now.” Personally, I’m feeling hot and confused, 
squinting at my lap top while I sweat in the press box. But I don’t suppose 
that’s what you have in mind.

Roland-Jones is back into the attack. Gale is in horrendous form at the 
minute, points out my mucker Ali Martin, and is only averaging 20 for the 
season. Bresnan, on the other hand, is batting as well as ever, and has just 
smeared four to cow corner. If you’re finding all this excitement inspiring, 
the OBO’s own team are looking for recruits for their upcoming tour: “The 
OBOccasionals team are one player short for our trip to the island of Vis in 
Croatia next weekend, and this is a final, not at all desperate plea for 
someone to join us. We have two games, on Friday and Sunday, and it should be a 
glorious weekend. If there is anyone out there interested, email
Joe.neate@gmail.com <mailto:Joe.neate@gmail.com>!”

25th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 119-4 
(Bresnan 39, Gale 6) need 240

A great over from Finn, around the wicket to Gale ending in a an edge that 
flies between the slip and the keeper. The slip got his fingertips to it, but 
it flew on for four.

24th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 113-4 
(Bresnan 38, Gale 1) need 240

A four! A six! And a cry of “Was that a drop?” from the back of the press box. 
Someone is here is paying attention, at any rate. Most people have their heads 
buried in their laptops, and are working away on their reports. After some 
debate we decide that it wasn’t, and that the ball fell just short of Compton’s 
grasp. Rayner runs his hands through his hair.

23rd over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 101-4 
(Bresnan 27, Gale 0) need 240

Gale is the new man in. Bresnan cloths a lofted drive down the ground for two 
runs to bring up Yorkshire’s 100. Then has a wild swing at a slower ball, which 
he misses altogether. I only saw the very last part of Ballance’s dismissal, by 
the way, which is why the details are so scanty. It can tell you it was a 
steepler, but not much more.

22nd over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 96-3 
(Ballance 28, Bresnan 24) need 240 to win

Four off Rayner’s latest over. And here’s Paul Weaver, with an update from the 
Rose Bowl: “ A cry went out from the Arlott Atrium: “Hampshire, you’re rubbish, 
just like the umpires.” It summed up the frustration in these parts. There have 
been a number of miscues from the Durham batsmen but they have survived and are 
now 208 for one and making their victory chase look easy. Stoneman is enjoying 
his Durham leaving party, having struck 14 fours in an unbeaten hundred. Durham 
need just 88 off 16. It looks grim forHampshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire>.”

21st over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 92-3 
(Ballance 27, Bresnan 21) need 240 to win

Finn comes around the wicket to Ballance, switches back over it when a single 
puts Bresnan on strike. Another single means Yorkshire need exactly 150 to win. 
Make that 148, as Bresnan clobbers two runs out to cover,Middlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> reeling the ball in just short of 
the rope and returning it with a relay throw. Having thought about it for a 
minute, I’ve decided I’m not conflicted after all. I do want Somerset to win. 
I’m just trying to find a way to make myself feel better about the fact that 
they’re not going to.

Ballance drops to one knee and carts Rayner for six over mid-wicket way. I’ll 
admit I’m a little conflicted, since much as I’d loveSomerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> to win, I’d always imagined I’d be 
there at Taunton to see them do it.

19th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 77-3 
(Ballance 17, Bresnan 16) need 240 to win

Bresnan throws a pull at a short ball from Finn, cuffs it short mid-wicket. 
Ballance cuts a single to third man. This wouldn’t be OBO without an email or 
two, so here’s Josh Robinson: “Being sat at a desk desperately trying to finish 
an article (it’s like my student OBOing days all over again) rather than (as I 
had planned) having been at Taunton this week, or indeed Lord’s today, I very 
much sympathize with your missing out on the cheese and wine. But what better 
way to share the nailbiting finish to the season than by OBOing it. All you 
need is Smyth there now. Having been carping away BTL about how overly generous 
the target was to Yorks, I’m now eating my words. Not only that, but I’m 
predicting that this is going to end in a draw, such that you’ll have OBOd your 
beloved Somerset’s first championship win. As I say: where would you rather be?”

(Ballance 13, Bresnan 13) need 240 to win

And here’s Steve Finn, hurtling in from the Nursery End. His first ball is a 
beauty, and almost has Bresnan LBW. He’s spared by a thin inside edge. Later in 
the over, Bresnan wallops a six over square leg, with a flick off his pads. I 
know that the Guardian’s own Jon Wilson is way down to my left in the sunny 
grandstands with a nice bottle of red wine, some cheese, bread, and a jar of 
pickled onions. I could be there, I should be there, if I’d only kept my mouth 
shut.

We've gone to OBO …

Andy Bull

I suspected there would come a point, sometime today when I regretted telling 
my editors that I’d come along to Lord’s with my laptop. And that moment has 
arrived. Because they’ve asked me to take over the blog and turn it into an 
over-by-over. It’s been about four years since I’ve last done one of these. But 
hey ho, let’s see how we go.Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are 59 for three, Gary Ballance 
nine, Tim Bresnan six, they need 240, and there are 25 overs left to play.

Oof! The third Yorkshire wicket has just fallen at Lord’s, with David Willey 
picking out Steve Eskinazi running around from mid-on to give Murtagh his 
second. The big left-hander had been pushed up the order to give it some tap 
but 11 from 21 was not that. Yorkshire are 48 for three from 12.4 overs ... 
chasing 240 in 40. This declaration is looking smarter by the minute/wicket.

It’s swelteringly hot at Lord’s, where both the Compton and Edrich stands are 
jam-packed with county cricket fans, most of them debating the merits of 
Middlesex’s declaration. Consensus is that 240 from 40 overs was probably a 
touch too generous to Yorkshire. It came at the end of an excruciating, and at 
times utterly surreal little passage of play, in which Yorkshire’s Adam Lyth 
and Alex Lees delivered a few overs of particularly ugly declaration bowling. 
Lees still managed to take two wickets. When he took the first of them – Dawid 
Malan, for 116, out slapping a full toss straight to square leg – his 
celebrations consisted of an apologetic shrug to his team-mates. It was Lees’ 
first wicket in professional cricket. Given the way the game is headed –
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are 38 for one as I 
type this, and Lees is 19 not out – it may not be the most memorable thing that 
happens to him today. Anyway. Middlesex’s captain James Franklin was so 
determined to get the declaration spot on that he and Steve Eskinazi refused to 
hit a fair few of the pies Lees and Lyth were serving them. So we were treated 
to the strange spectacle of batsmen cautiously blocking rank bowling. 
Thankfully, that’s all over now, though I guess it may be a while before 
Somerset and their supporters forgive, or forget, this strange episode.

Oh, another wicket, Lees out for 20, and Yorkshire 39 for two. Gary Ballance 
joins the pinch-hitter David Willey in the middle.

At the moment Hampshire, who have to win here, look like they’re going down; 
they have bowled 51 of their 78 overs and taken just one wicket.But there could 
be a lot of cricket to come. Durham have fallen behind the rate but having lost 
just one wicket will be tempted to launch an effort after tea. Mason Crane, the 
talented youngHampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> 
leg-spinner, is doing his best to keep both sides in the match, alternating 
four-balls with wicket-taking deliveries. Stoneman, playing his last innings 
for Durham before joining Surrey (as is Borthwick) was almost caught at deep 
mid-off by James Vince off Crane when he had made 67, having almost fallen to 
the same combo a little earlier. At tea, Durham have scored 149 for one. That 
means they have to make 147 more off 27 overs. It might become a terrible 
anti-climax but I think Durham will have a go after they’ve had a cuppa. I’m 
keeping half an eye on Lord’s too. All that pre-declaration bowling reminded me 
of one of the worst aspects of three-day cricket, and those contrived finishes 
on Tuesday and Friday afternoons. But both Yorkshire and Middlesex deserve this 
title, and I hope one of them gets it.

Right, after 30 minutes of pies being served up by Yorkshire at Lord’s (in 
which Alex Lees claimed the first two wickets of his first-class career), 
Middlesex have declared on 359 for six. It means Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> will need 240 runs in 40 overs 
for a hat-trick of titles, Middlesex 10 wickets for their first since 1993. 
Seems very generous from the home side if you ask me but anyway, this game, 
with apologies to Somerset, is now (mercifully) on.

And so one of the three teams that came into this final round is safe, with 
Warwickshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> completing a 
crushing 237-run win over Lancashire to guarantee their Division One status and 
leave the Red Rose now praying for Durham to knock off the runs at Hampshire, 
or at least grind out a draw. Hampshire win and they are safe, at the expense 
of Lancs. Weaver has a tense finale on his hands …

Like many others this week, Barney Ronay’s attention is focused on this 
thrilling County Championship finale – and particularly the role played by Ryan 
Sidebottom. Here’s an extract from his column:

It has been quite a week for Sidebottom, who has been playing in Yorkshire’s 
final match of the season at Lord’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/23/county-cricket-three-way-title-race-goes-to-the-final-day-live>
 , and who on Thursday was involved in a brilliantly minimal,self-contained 
moment of pure theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/22/middlesex-yorkshire-county-championship-division-one-day-three-match-report>
, an hour where on the face of it very little seemed to happen, but which under 
conditions of full immersion was as gripping as anything you’re likely to come 
across anywhere.

Even better this was a great moment in the County Championship, a competition 
that seems to spend most of its time these days being told off by its 
grandchildren for letting the roof leak and the windows rot and generally 
squandering the family pile before nodding vaguely and heading off out in the 
Jag for a sherry and a snooze.

Ryan Sidebottom chuntering away signals good health for county cricket |

Hampshire have broken through in the 27th over. A ripper from Crane caught 
Jennings right back on his stumps and lbw, and it was 75 for one. It’s now 79 
for one, so with 50 overs remaining Durham need another 217 and Hampshire need 
nine wickets. Lancashire, it seems are simply relying onHampshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> not pulling it off.

It’s lunch here at the Ageas Bowl and Hampshire are still looking for their 
first wicket.Durham have scored 41 without loss after 15 overs, so they’re not 
exactly powering along. But the batsmen are looking solid. Durham need 255 from 
63 overs to sendHampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> into a 
tailspin and into the second division. Both slow left-armer Dawson and 
leg-spinner Crane are spinning the ball the wrong way – from their point of 
view – to the two left-handers. But they will be encouraged by the fact that 
they have turned the ball more than Ryan Pringle in this match, and Pringle’s 
seven in Hampshire’s second innings meant he took 10 in the match.

This was not just a good morning for Middlesex and perhaps Somerset, but for 
county cricket. The crowd were able to spill on to the outfield during the 
lunch interval having witnessed a vibrant morning’s batting from Nick Gubbins 
and Dawid Malan. The pair had come together the previous evening with Middlesex 
in trouble at 2-2 and proceeded to add 198 for the third wicket, 117 of them in 
the first session today. Both drove with particular fluency and Gubbins seemed 
destined for his second hundred of the game when five minutes before the 
interval he chipped a gentle return catch to Akeem Rafiq from the leading edge 
of his bat, for 93. Milan though is still there, and will stew for a while with 
his score on 99. At 201 for 3, theMiddlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> lead is now 81, still not enough 
to start thinking about the end game. There are 64 overs left.

Hampshire are desperate for the 10 wickets that will spell first division 
survival but Durham have made a good start to their chase. They have scored 25 
without loss from their opening seven overs, with both Keaton Jennings and the 
more aggressive Mark Stoneman looking good against Berg and Brad Wheal. But
Hampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> are now turning to 
spin, with Liam Dawson. Here is where the game will be won or lost. Remember – 
despite their early season batting frailties – it has been Hampshire’s 
inability to take 20 wickets in a match which has really cost them dear this 
year.

Find myself stationed at Lord’s today but see the match I left at Edgbaston is 
continuing to head one way, Warwickshire’s way.Lancashire are now 57 for five 
in their pursuit of 347 … and nightwatchman Simon Kerrigan is still in. Now, 
the Lancashire Twitter feed is pretty decent when the Red Rose are bowling, 
with highlights of wickets posted swiftly. When they are batting, however, 
nowt. Not a sausage. But Haseeb Hameed c Clarke (second slip) b Wright 27 and 
Steven Croft c Hain (short leg) b Clarke 1 is what I can tell you.

Ever read The Laughing Policeman by Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo? I once picked 
up a second hand copy at a railway station, to read on a long commute. The 
cover promised that the final chapter contained the most mindbending twist. I 
raced through it, alive with expectation, waiting, waiting all the while for 
the big reveal. Only to find that someone had torn out the very final few 
pages. Apparently it only happens in the penultimate paragraph. I still don’t 
know what it is. Anyway. I’m hoping today won’t play out the same way. I’m sure 
there’s something extraordinary in store at Lord’s. In the meantime, I’ve been 
reading more of Mike’s early works. His very first piece for The Guardian was 
actually a tourist’s guide to India, which contains a fine anecdote about Ken 
Barrington’s bath plug and a group of rowdy fans propelling oranges into the 
middle of Eden Gardens with a catapult made out of a car tyre. It ends with the 
following piece of wisdom: “It was Keith Fletcher who introduced me to the 
pleasures of drinking Scotch whisky by insisting I drank a tumblerful last 
thing at night, in an effort, he said, to kill any stomach bugs. My advice to 
this year’s tourists is: stock up well on the duty-frees, because while it may 
not be the elixir of life it might quell any rumbles on the sub-continent. And 
even if it doesn’t, it is one hell of a pleasant way to prove someone wrong.”

Welcome to the Ageas Bowl where Hampshire have just declared at 245 for nine. 
That has set Durham 296 to win from a minimum of 78 overs.Hampshire resumed 
this morning on 176 for seven, with a lead of 226, with Lewis McManus and Mason 
Crane the overnight batsmen. It appears that there was an agreement between the 
teams, becauseHampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> batted 
for exactly an hour. With only one run added, Crane drove Ryan Pringle to Scott 
Borthwick at mid-on, but the talented McManus went on to make 67 from 90 balls, 
with 10 fours, before he was caught behind. But then Gareth Berg – who must 
have felt flattered to have been protected by a nightwatchman the previous 
evening, hit a quick 36 as if to prove that he was a respectable batsman after 
all. It’s been an entertaining morning in the brilliant autumn sunshine.

It’s a glorious morning at Lord’s, as if somebody up there knew this was Mike 
Selvey’s last day covering cricket for the Guardian and fixed the weather for 
the occasion. Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> are 119 
for two as I type this, but if Selve’s taught me anything in the 10 years I’ve 
been working with him, apart from the locations of his favourite spots for 
sundowners, it’s that you’ve got to know when to watch. And I suspect this 
day’s play isn’t quite going to catch light till a little later in the 
afternoon. In the meantime, I’ve been having a rummage around in the archives. 
And I’ve found, alongside a report from April 23, 1985, a short report on the 
day’s play at Fenner’s, between Cambridge University v Essex, written, of 
course, by one Mike Selvey. It was his very first match report for the paper.

The County Championship has come down to the wire and will be won on the very 
final day. It is a three-horse race, with Somerset hoping to win their first 
title in 141 years andMiddlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> 
and Yorkshire facing each other at Lord’s as they do battle to claim the trophy.

Who needs what to win the County Championship cricket title?

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/who-needs-what-to-win-the-county-championship-cricket-title>
Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> are now top of the table 
with 226 points having beaten Nottinghamshire in three days, however they will 
rue the fact they missed out on a fifth batting point in their first innings 
which would have made Yorkshire’s task harder. The players will gather at 
Taunton on Friday to watch proceedings at Lord’s.

Middlesex, who have banked five points in the match so far, are second with 
218 andYorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire>, who have 
claimed seven, are third with 211. There are three possible scenarios from the 
match: a result (which is worth 16 further points to the winning side), a draw 
(which is worth five further points to each side) or a tie (which is worth 
eight further points to each side).

A draw would not be enough for either side at Lord’s, so they must both go for 
the win in order for the victorious side to clinch the 16 points on offer to 
overtakeSomerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset>.

A tie would put Middlesex level with Somerset on points although, under 
tie-breaker rules, Somerset would still then win the Championship as they would 
have won more games this season (six) thanMiddlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> (five).

Hello. The live blog will get under way shortly. Here’s Mike Selvey’s report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/22/middlesex-yorkshire-county-championship-division-one-day-three-match-report>
 from day three at Lord’s, as Yorkshire kept their title chances alive. Win 
today, and the title is theirs. Lose, and they hand it to opponents Middlesex. 
Draw, and Somerset, who beat Nottinghamshire yesterday, will win their first 
ever County Championship.

It was the equinox and the autumnal shadows were already stretching out across 
the Lord’s turf when theYorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 
team took the field and began their charge towards what they hoped on the final 
day of the season would be the County Championship title for the third year in 
a row.

A colossal innings of immense character from Tim Bresnan and lower‑order 
defiance first from Azeem Rafiq and then the old warhorse Ryan Sidebottom, took
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> to the fourth batting 
point they needed to ensure they remained in the race and then, with what 
proved to be a 56-run last-wicket partnership, beyond to a lead of 120.

This provided a tricky situation for Middlesex. With the points, potentially, 
still to win the title themselves, they were scarcely in a position to do so, 
the more so when Sidebottom removed Sam Robson in his first over and Jack 
Brooks castled Nick Compton in his second. This being so, it became incumbent on
Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> to do all they could to 
ensure Yorkshire do not win (it is in the genes of the Middle Saxon) and by the 
close they had reached 81 for two from 38 overs, still 39 adrift, with Nick 
Gubbins on 38 and Dawid Malan 37.

There does, though, remain an outside possibility that Middlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> could bat long enough to set 
Yorkshire a Twenty20-type run‑rate knowing they would have to go for it. They 
would be holding their breath in Taunton at that. A fiver will get entry to 
Lord’s for the last day, which has got to be worth it.

Well, if nothing else, I’m glad for my colleague and friend Mike Selvey, who 
is busy writing his final report for the Guardian even as I type this. It’s a 
fitting way for him to finish, given how much of his career he spent playing 
here for the Middle Saxons, as he likes to call them. It’s their first 
championship title since 1993. As forSomerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset>, well, as Andrew Benton says 
“there’s always next year”. They’ve been saying that for 125 years now.

After beating Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> by 61 
runs with 28 balls to spare, Toby-Roland Jones finishing the innings with a 
hat-trick spread across two overs.
 
It’s all over. Toby Roland-Jones has just won Middlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> the county championship.

Hodd is bowled. 
 
I think my heart just broke. 
 
Finn has yorked Patterson. 
 
35th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 178-7 (Hodd 
17, Patterson 2) need 240

Middlesex have got seven men out now when Hodd is on strike. In other news, 
Hampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> have been relegated. 
Hold on...
 
“I’m a Somerset fan,” writes Pete Salmon, “and I’ve just realised Middlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> are going to win aren’t they. 
That’s what’s going to happen, isn’t it. ISN’T IT?!”
 
Rafiq slices a top edge high into the air, and Simpson takes the catch over 
behind first slip.
 
34th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 173-6 (Hodd 
14, Rafiq 4) need 240

“So what are the odds that I get to talking cricket with the guy running the 
cars concession at the Autumn Fair in Ekenäs, Finland (yes,that Ekenäs, home to 
Ekenäs CC of OBO and the OBOccasionals matchup glory) yesterday?” asks Sara 
Torvalds. “OK, reasonable, I suppose, as he was of Indian descent. He tried to 
turn the conversation to NZ in India, but I had to confess I’d had no time for 
that series, what with the County Championship going down to the wire. That 
surprised and delighted him no end, though. He was particularly surprised to 
find me rooting for Somerset, so I had to confess my love for Marcus 
Trescothick (one day Iwill see him play live!), but what are the odds the guy 
himselflives in Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> (when 
he’s not out and about letting kids ride the bumper cars)!? Surely those odds 
are enough to secure the necessary draw at Lord’s, right? Right?!”
 
33rd over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 172-6 (Hodd 
14, Rafiq 3) need 240

All of a sudden, things feel a little different. Forget about the runs needed, 
for a moment, the more pertinent point is thatMiddlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> need four wickets to win the 
championship. “Nothing for Yorkshire to lose now,” points out John Leavey, “3rd 
if they lose, 3rd if they draw. Unless they hate the southerners more than the 
south-westerners!” Hodd cuts the ball just past slip.

32nd over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 160-5 (Gale 
22, Hodd 5) need 240

I’m told that the Somerset players are on the outfield at Taunton, trying to 
kill the final few minutes before they find out whether or not they’ve won the 
title. They can’t bear to watch. “Do you think there is a point at which 
Yorkshire will decide they can’t win and settle for a draw just to stopMiddlesex
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> from winning?” asks Vinny 
Raghavan. My guess is that they’re committed to it, now, one way or another.
 
31st over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 157-5 (Gale 
22, Hodd 2) need 240

Hodd swings and misses. Then gets a single to mid-wicket. There are now just 
nine overs to go, Yorkshire still need another 84 runs,Middlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> another five wickets. Cross your 
fingers, Somerset really could be about to win the county championship for the 
first time in their history.
 
Bresnan goes!

Dan Mullan/Getty Images  
30th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 149-4 
(Bresnan 55, Gale 20) need 240

Bresnan batters another four. Word reaches Lord’s from the Rose Bowl. Here’s 
Paul Weaver: “TheHampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> 
supporters are drifting away and Lancashire must be well into their survival 
celebrations by now. Durham lost their second wicket when Stoneman gloved one 
from Dawson to Tom Alsop at short leg and just now Graham Clark was stumped as 
he went down the wicket to Crane. But Durham are 259 for three and need just 37 
off 11 with Ben Stokes the new man.”
 
29th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 147-4 
(Bresnan 50, Gale 19) need 240

Gale got hold of that one, a shortish ball from Finn, which he pulled to 
mid-wicket for four. Yorkshire now need 99 to win, from 70 balls. Four more, 
off Gale’s thigh pad. Ali has just reminded me that Gale and Bresnan are 
brothers-in-law, making this a family affair. Bresnan brings up his fifty, what 
a match he’s having.
 More runs for Tim Bresnan. Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images  
28th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 136-4 
(Bresnan 49, Gale 14) need 240

Gale has a yahoo at Roland-Jones’ second delivery, and doesn’t get near it. He 
connects with a crisp cut for a single later in the over though, and we now 
have 12 overs to go.
 
27th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 133-4 
(Bresnan 46, Gale 12) need 240

“I take it back,” Ali adds, as Gale steps to leg and hammers a glorious four 
through cover. This impromptu OBO party has just become a little more official, 
because we’ve had an email in from Gary Naylor: “There are some people who will 
never feel the way we feel now.” Personally, I’m feeling hot and confused, 
squinting at my lap top while I sweat in the press box. But I don’t suppose 
that’s what you have in mind.
 
26th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 127-4 
(Bresnan 46, Gale 7) need 240

Roland-Jones is back into the attack. Gale is in horrendous form at the 
minute, points out my mucker Ali Martin, and is only averaging 20 for the 
season. Bresnan, on the other hand, is batting as well as ever, and has just 
smeared four to cow corner. If you’re finding all this excitement inspiring, 
the OBO’s own team are looking for recruits for their upcoming tour: “The 
OBOccasionals team are one player short for our trip to the island of Vis in 
Croatia next weekend, and this is a final, not at all desperate plea for 
someone to join us. We have two games, on Friday and Sunday, and it should be a 
glorious weekend. If there is anyone out there interested, email
Joe.neate@gmail.com <mailto:Joe.neate@gmail.com>!”
 
25th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 119-4 
(Bresnan 39, Gale 6) need 240

A great over from Finn, around the wicket to Gale ending in a an edge that 
flies between the slip and the keeper. The slip got his fingertips to it, but 
it flew on for four.
 
24th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 113-4 
(Bresnan 38, Gale 1) need 240

A four! A six! And a cry of “Was that a drop?” from the back of the press box. 
Someone is here is paying attention, at any rate. Most people have their heads 
buried in their laptops, and are working away on their reports. After some 
debate we decide that it wasn’t, and that the ball fell just short of Compton’s 
grasp. Rayner runs his hands through his hair.
 
23rd over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 101-4 
(Bresnan 27, Gale 0) need 240

Gale is the new man in. Bresnan cloths a lofted drive down the ground for two 
runs to bring up Yorkshire’s 100. Then has a wild swing at a slower ball, which 
he misses altogether. I only saw the very last part of Ballance’s dismissal, by 
the way, which is why the details are so scanty. It can tell you it was a 
steepler, but not much more.
 
Ballance is out, caught. 
 
23rd over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 96-3 
(Ballance 30, Bresnan 24) need 240 to win

The fifty partnership is up and... over.
 
22nd over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 96-3 
(Ballance 28, Bresnan 24) need 240 to win

Four off Rayner’s latest over. And here’s Paul Weaver, with an update from the 
Rose Bowl: “ A cry went out from the Arlott Atrium: “Hampshire, you’re rubbish, 
just like the umpires.” It summed up the frustration in these parts. There have 
been a number of miscues from the Durham batsmen but they have survived and are 
now 208 for one and making their victory chase look easy. Stoneman is enjoying 
his Durham leaving party, having struck 14 fours in an unbeaten hundred. Durham 
need just 88 off 16. It looks grim forHampshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire>.”
 
21st over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 92-3 
(Ballance 27, Bresnan 21) need 240 to win

Finn comes around the wicket to Ballance, switches back over it when a single 
puts Bresnan on strike. Another single means Yorkshire need exactly 150 to win. 
Make that 148, as Bresnan clobbers two runs out to cover,Middlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> reeling the ball in just short of 
the rope and returning it with a relay throw. Having thought about it for a 
minute, I’ve decided I’m not conflicted after all. I do want Somerset to win. 
I’m just trying to find a way to make myself feel better about the fact that 
they’re not going to.
 
20th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 87-3 
(Ballance 24, Bresnan 19) need 240 to win

Ballance drops to one knee and carts Rayner for six over mid-wicket way. I’ll 
admit I’m a little conflicted, since much as I’d loveSomerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> to win, I’d always imagined I’d be 
there at Taunton to see them do it.
 
19th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 77-3 
(Ballance 17, Bresnan 16) need 240 to win

Bresnan throws a pull at a short ball from Finn, cuffs it short mid-wicket. 
Ballance cuts a single to third man. This wouldn’t be OBO without an email or 
two, so here’s Josh Robinson: “Being sat at a desk desperately trying to finish 
an article (it’s like my student OBOing days all over again) rather than (as I 
had planned) having been at Taunton this week, or indeed Lord’s today, I very 
much sympathize with your missing out on the cheese and wine. But what better 
way to share the nailbiting finish to the season than by OBOing it. All you 
need is Smyth there now. Having been carping away BTL about how overly generous 
the target was to Yorks, I’m now eating my words. Not only that, but I’m 
predicting that this is going to end in a draw, such that you’ll have OBOd your 
beloved Somerset’s first championship win. As I say: where would you rather be?”
 
18th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 74-3 
(Ballance 15 Bresnan 15) need 240 to win

That said, Wilson did seem unusually keen to chat about shipping tonnage 
production levels in Sunderland during WW2, so maybe I am better off up here 
after all. Rayner continues, four off the over.
 
17th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 70-3 
(Ballance 13, Bresnan 13) need 240 to win

And here’s Steve Finn, hurtling in from the Nursery End. His first ball is a 
beauty, and almost has Bresnan LBW. He’s spared by a thin inside edge. Later in 
the over, Bresnan wallops a six over square leg, with a flick off his pads. I 
know that the Guardian’s own Jon Wilson is way down to my left in the sunny 
grandstands with a nice bottle of red wine, some cheese, bread, and a jar of 
pickled onions. I could be there, I should be there, if I’d only kept my mouth 
shut.
 
16th over: Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 63-3 
(Ballance 13, Bresnan 6) need 240 to win

Ollie Rayner is on, for the first time this innings. Ballance drives his first 
ball through the covers for four.
 
I suspected there would come a point, sometime today when I regretted telling 
my editors that I’d come along to Lord’s with my laptop. And that moment has 
arrived. Because they’ve asked me to take over the blog and turn it into an 
over-by-over. It’s been about four years since I’ve last done one of these. But 
hey ho, let’s see how we go.Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are 59 for three, Gary Ballance 
nine, Tim Bresnan six, they need 240, and there are 25 overs left to play.
 
Oof! The third Yorkshire wicket has just fallen at Lord’s, with David Willey 
picking out Steve Eskinazi running around from mid-on to give Murtagh his 
second. The big left-hander had been pushed up the order to give it some tap 
but 11 from 21 was not that. Yorkshire are 48 for three from 12.4 overs ... 
chasing 240 in 40. This declaration is looking smarter by the minute/wicket.
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> going too hard too 
early?

It’s swelteringly hot at Lord’s, where both the Compton and Edrich stands are 
jam-packed with county cricket fans, most of them debating the merits of 
Middlesex’s declaration. Consensus is that 240 from 40 overs was probably a 
touch too generous to Yorkshire. It came at the end of an excruciating, and at 
times utterly surreal little passage of play, in which Yorkshire’s Adam Lyth 
and Alex Lees delivered a few overs of particularly ugly declaration bowling. 
Lees still managed to take two wickets. When he took the first of them – Dawid 
Malan, for 116, out slapping a full toss straight to square leg – his 
celebrations consisted of an apologetic shrug to his team-mates. It was Lees’ 
first wicket in professional cricket. Given the way the game is headed –
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are 38 for one as I 
type this, and Lees is 19 not out – it may not be the most memorable thing that 
happens to him today. Anyway. Middlesex’s captain James Franklin was so 
determined to get the declaration spot on that he and Steve Eskinazi refused to 
hit a fair few of the pies Lees and Lyth were serving them. So we were treated 
to the strange spectacle of batsmen cautiously blocking rank bowling. 
Thankfully, that’s all over now, though I guess it may be a while before 
Somerset and their supporters forgive, or forget, this strange episode.

Oh, another wicket, Lees out for 20, and Yorkshire 39 for two. Gary Ballance 
joins the pinch-hitter David Willey in the middle.

At the moment Hampshire, who have to win here, look like they’re going down; 
they have bowled 51 of their 78 overs and taken just one wicket.But there could 
be a lot of cricket to come. Durham have fallen behind the rate but having lost 
just one wicket will be tempted to launch an effort after tea. Mason Crane, the 
talented youngHampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> 
leg-spinner, is doing his best to keep both sides in the match, alternating 
four-balls with wicket-taking deliveries. Stoneman, playing his last innings 
for Durham before joining Surrey (as is Borthwick) was almost caught at deep 
mid-off by James Vince off Crane when he had made 67, having almost fallen to 
the same combo a little earlier. At tea, Durham have scored 149 for one. That 
means they have to make 147 more off 27 overs. It might become a terrible 
anti-climax but I think Durham will have a go after they’ve had a cuppa. I’m 
keeping half an eye on Lord’s too. All that pre-declaration bowling reminded me 
of one of the worst aspects of three-day cricket, and those contrived finishes 
on Tuesday and Friday afternoons. But both Yorkshire and Middlesex deserve this 
title, and I hope one of them gets it.
 
Right, after 30 minutes of pies being served up by Yorkshire at Lord’s (in 
which Alex Lees claimed the first two wickets of his first-class career), 
Middlesex have declared on 359 for six. It means Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> will need 240 runs in 40 overs 
for a hat-trick of titles, Middlesex 10 wickets for their first since 1993. 
Seems very generous from the home side if you ask me but anyway, this game, 
with apologies to Somerset, is now (mercifully) on.
 
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> need 240 in 40 overs 
to win the match and the title.
 
And so one of the three teams that came into this final round is safe, with 
Warwickshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> completing a 
crushing 237-run win over Lancashire to guarantee their Division One status and 
leave the Red Rose now praying for Durham to knock off the runs at Hampshire, 
or at least grind out a draw. Hampshire win and they are safe, at the expense 
of Lancs. Weaver has a tense finale on his hands …

 
Like many others this week, Barney Ronay’s attention is focused on this 
thrilling County Championship finale – and particularly the role played by Ryan 
Sidebottom. Here’s an extract from his column:

It has been quite a week for Sidebottom, who has been playing in Yorkshire’s 
final match of the season at Lord’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/23/county-cricket-three-way-title-race-goes-to-the-final-day-live>
 , and who on Thursday was involved in a brilliantly minimal,self-contained 
moment of pure theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/22/middlesex-yorkshire-county-championship-division-one-day-three-match-report>
, an hour where on the face of it very little seemed to happen, but which under 
conditions of full immersion was as gripping as anything you’re likely to come 
across anywhere.

Even better this was a great moment in the County Championship, a competition 
that seems to spend most of its time these days being told off by its 
grandchildren for letting the roof leak and the windows rot and generally 
squandering the family pile before nodding vaguely and heading off out in the 
Jag for a sherry and a snooze.

Hampshire have broken through in the 27th over. A ripper from Crane caught 
Jennings right back on his stumps and lbw, and it was 75 for one. It’s now 79 
for one, so with 50 overs remaining Durham need another 217 and Hampshire need 
nine wickets. Lancashire, it seems are simply relying onHampshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> not pulling it off.
 
It’s lunch here at the Ageas Bowl and Hampshire are still looking for their 
first wicket.Durham have scored 41 without loss after 15 overs, so they’re not 
exactly powering along. But the batsmen are looking solid. Durham need 255 from 
63 overs to sendHampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> into a 
tailspin and into the second division. Both slow left-armer Dawson and 
leg-spinner Crane are spinning the ball the wrong way – from their point of 
view – to the two left-handers. But they will be encouraged by the fact that 
they have turned the ball more than Ryan Pringle in this match, and Pringle’s 
seven in Hampshire’s second innings meant he took 10 in the match.
 
This was not just a good morning for Middlesex and perhaps Somerset, but for 
county cricket. The crowd were able to spill on to the outfield during the 
lunch interval having witnessed a vibrant morning’s batting from Nick Gubbins 
and Dawid Malan. The pair had come together the previous evening with Middlesex 
in trouble at 2-2 and proceeded to add 198 for the third wicket, 117 of them in 
the first session today. Both drove with particular fluency and Gubbins seemed 
destined for his second hundred of the game when five minutes before the 
interval he chipped a gentle return catch to Akeem Rafiq from the leading edge 
of his bat, for 93. Milan though is still there, and will stew for a while with 
his score on 99. At 201 for 3, theMiddlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> lead is now 81, still not enough 
to start thinking about the end game. There are 64 overs left.
 
Hampshire are desperate for the 10 wickets that will spell first division 
survival but Durham have made a good start to their chase. They have scored 25 
without loss from their opening seven overs, with both Keaton Jennings and the 
more aggressive Mark Stoneman looking good against Berg and Brad Wheal. But
Hampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> are now turning to 
spin, with Liam Dawson. Here is where the game will be won or lost. Remember – 
despite their early season batting frailties – it has been Hampshire’s 
inability to take 20 wickets in a match which has really cost them dear this 
year.
 
Find myself stationed at Lord’s today but see the match I left at Edgbaston is 
continuing to head one way, Warwickshire’s way.Lancashire are now 57 for five 
in their pursuit of 347 … and nightwatchman Simon Kerrigan is still in. Now, 
the Lancashire Twitter feed is pretty decent when the Red Rose are bowling, 
with highlights of wickets posted swiftly. When they are batting, however, 
nowt. Not a sausage. But Haseeb Hameed c Clarke (second slip) b Wright 27 and 
Steven Croft c Hain (short leg) b Clarke 1 is what I can tell you.
 
Ever read The Laughing Policeman by Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo? I once picked 
up a second hand copy at a railway station, to read on a long commute. The 
cover promised that the final chapter contained the most mindbending twist. I 
raced through it, alive with expectation, waiting, waiting all the while for 
the big reveal. Only to find that someone had torn out the very final few 
pages. Apparently it only happens in the penultimate paragraph. I still don’t 
know what it is. Anyway. I’m hoping today won’t play out the same way. I’m sure 
there’s something extraordinary in store at Lord’s. In the meantime, I’ve been 
reading more of Mike’s early works. His very first piece for The Guardian was 
actually a tourist’s guide to India, which contains a fine anecdote about Ken 
Barrington’s bath plug and a group of rowdy fans propelling oranges into the 
middle of Eden Gardens with a catapult made out of a car tyre. It ends with the 
following piece of wisdom: “It was Keith Fletcher who introduced me to the 
pleasures of drinking Scotch whisky by insisting I drank a tumblerful last 
thing at night, in an effort, he said, to kill any stomach bugs. My advice to 
this year’s tourists is: stock up well on the duty-frees, because while it may 
not be the elixir of life it might quell any rumbles on the sub-continent. And 
even if it doesn’t, it is one hell of a pleasant way to prove someone wrong.”
 
Welcome to the Ageas Bowl where Hampshire have just declared at 245 for nine. 
That has set Durham 296 to win from a minimum of 78 overs.Hampshire resumed 
this morning on 176 for seven, with a lead of 226, with Lewis McManus and Mason 
Crane the overnight batsmen. It appears that there was an agreement between the 
teams, becauseHampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> batted 
for exactly an hour. With only one run added, Crane drove Ryan Pringle to Scott 
Borthwick at mid-on, but the talented McManus went on to make 67 from 90 balls, 
with 10 fours, before he was caught behind. But then Gareth Berg – who must 
have felt flattered to have been protected by a nightwatchman the previous 
evening, hit a quick 36 as if to prove that he was a respectable batsman after 
all. It’s been an entertaining morning in the brilliant autumn sunshine.
 
It’s a glorious morning at Lord’s, as if somebody up there knew this was Mike 
Selvey’s last day covering cricket for the Guardian and fixed the weather for 
the occasion. Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> are 119 
for two as I type this, but if Selve’s taught me anything in the 10 years I’ve 
been working with him, apart from the locations of his favourite spots for 
sundowners, it’s that you’ve got to know when to watch. And I suspect this 
day’s play isn’t quite going to catch light till a little later in the 
afternoon. In the meantime, I’ve been having a rummage around in the archives. 
And I’ve found, alongside a report from April 23, 1985, a short report on the 
day’s play at Fenner’s, between Cambridge University v Essex, written, of 
course, by one Mike Selvey. It was his very first match report for the paper.

The County Championship has come down to the wire and will be won on the very 
final day. It is a three-horse race, with Somerset hoping to win their first 
title in 141 years andMiddlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> 
and Yorkshire facing each other at Lord’s as they do battle to claim the trophy.

Who needs what to win the County Championship cricket title?

Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> are now top of the table 
with 226 points having beaten Nottinghamshire in three days, however they will 
rue the fact they missed out on a fifth batting point in their first innings 
which would have made Yorkshire’s task harder. The players will gather at 
Taunton on Friday to watch proceedings at Lord’s.

Middlesex, who have banked five points in the match so far, are second with 
218 andYorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire>, who have 
claimed seven, are third with 211. There are three possible scenarios from the 
match: a result (which is worth 16 further points to the winning side), a draw 
(which is worth five further points to each side) or a tie (which is worth 
eight further points to each side).

A draw would not be enough for either side at Lord’s, so they must both go for 
the win in order for the victorious side to clinch the 16 points on offer to 
overtakeSomerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset>.

A tie would put Middlesex level with Somerset on points although, under 
tie-breaker rules, Somerset would still then win the Championship as they would 
have won more games this season (six) thanMiddlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> (five).
 
Hello. The live blog will get under way shortly. Here’s Mike Selvey’s report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/22/middlesex-yorkshire-county-championship-division-one-day-three-match-report>
 from day three at Lord’s, as Yorkshire kept their title chances alive. Win 
today, and the title is theirs. Lose, and they hand it to opponents Middlesex. 
Draw, and Somerset, who beat Nottinghamshire yesterday, will win their first 
ever County Championship.

It was the equinox and the autumnal shadows were already stretching out across 
the Lord’s turf when theYorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> 
team took the field and began their charge towards what they hoped on the final 
day of the season would be the County Championship title for the third year in 
a row.

A colossal innings of immense character from Tim Bresnan and lower‑order 
defiance first from Azeem Rafiq and then the old warhorse Ryan Sidebottom, took
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> to the fourth batting 
point they needed to ensure they remained in the race and then, with what 
proved to be a 56-run last-wicket partnership, beyond to a lead of 120.

This provided a tricky situation for Middlesex. With the points, potentially, 
still to win the title themselves, they were scarcely in a position to do so, 
the more so when Sidebottom removed Sam Robson in his first over and Jack 
Brooks castled Nick Compton in his second. This being so, it became incumbent on
Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> to do all they could to 
ensure Yorkshire do not win (it is in the genes of the Middle Saxon) and by the 
close they had reached 81 for two from 38 overs, still 39 adrift, with Nick 
Gubbins on 38 and Dawid Malan 37.

There does, though, remain an outside possibility that Middlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> could bat long enough to set 
Yorkshire a Twenty20-type run‑rate knowing they would have to go for it. They 
would be holding their breath in Taunton at that. A fiver will get entry to 
Lord’s for the last day, which has got to be worth it.
