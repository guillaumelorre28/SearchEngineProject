Knitting has long since moved on from granny pastime to cool retro activity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/aug/12/modern-craft-knitting-gardening-cakes>
 favoured by young hipsters. From stitch and bitch sessions – the naughtie's 
version of the coffee morning – to the more recentguerilla knitting

 where "graffiti" artists with nicknames such as Deadly Knitshade adorn public 
spaces with their cool wool creations, knitting is becoming almost as popular 
as the nation's other favourite retro obsession – baking.

Now the Pelirocco in Brighton, a kitsch hotel whose funky rooms are inspired 
by "sex sirens and maverick musicians" has got in on the act with a knitted 
bedroom.

Deisgned by Brighton local and artist Kate Jenkins 
<http://www.cardigan.ltd.uk/about.php?s1=2>, the room features her trademark 
knitted food – in a wooly fry-up – a knitted telephone, curtains and toothpaste 
and toothbrush, not to mention the more traditional knitted bedspread. In 
keeping with the rest of the hotel's rooms, Jenkins' room has its own name – 
the Do Knit Disturb room. Boom boom!

In a departure from the hotel's speciality as Brighton's "sauciest stopover", 
Do Knit Disturb is a single room. The Diana Dors-inpired Pin Up Parlour or the 
sexy Play Room suite might be a better bet for a dirty weekend away, but for 
sheer novelty value and cuteness – or for anyone with a wool fetish – Do Knit 
Disturb is hard to beat.

Knitting <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/knitting> – it's the new 
rock'n'roll. Next up: the baking-themed room?
