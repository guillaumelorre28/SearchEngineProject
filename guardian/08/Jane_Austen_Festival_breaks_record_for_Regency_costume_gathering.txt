“One cannot have too large a party,” writes Jane Austen in Emma. So we assume 
she would have approved of this gathering held last weekend at afestival in her 
honour <http://www.janeaustenfestivalbath.co.uk/>, which broke the world record 
for the largest gathering of people dressed in Regency costume.

A total of 550 men, women and children squeezed into the Assembly Rooms in 
Bath, home of the Jane Austen Centre which runs the festival, reclaiming the 
title from theJane Austen <https://www.theguardian.com/books/janeausten> 
Society of North America whose 491 Austen fans set the previous record at an 
event in Greater Louisville, Kentucky.


The gathering was a highlight of the 10-day festival which runs until 21 
September with more than 80 events, including walks, talks, performances and a 
masked ball, all celebrating the life and times of the author.
