The fun-loving nature of Blackpool is encapsulated in its tower, which, unlike 
the humourless Eiffel Tower which it copied, is packed with entertainment. 
Since it was relaunched in 2011 as part of the council's £20m regeneration 
scheme, the attractions have multiplied. Now you can look out over the Irish 
Sea from the observation deck (or vertiginously down through the skywalk's 
glass platform) and leave the children at Jungle Jim's indoor play area.The 
original 19th-century ballroom

, with its sprung wood floor, Wurlitzer organ and gilded balconies, still takes 
some beating, however – as does the Tower Circus, with its ring suspended over 
water and dancing fountains (open March-November).
