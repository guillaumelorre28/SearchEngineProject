Chris Lynn has been ruled out for the rest of the series against Pakistan and 
the upcoming one-day tour of New Zealand because of a neck injury.


The batsman made his ODI debut in the series-opening win over Pakistan on 13 
January, but the pain from a bulging disc in his neck has increased and he has 
been ordered to rest.

Australia coach Darren Lehmann is hopeful Lynn will return for the home T20 
series against Sri Lanka, starting on 17 February.


“He’s been playing in a lot of pain, even in the BBL,” Lehmann said. “It’s 
just gotten to the stage where he can’t function anymore. He’s got a couple of 
weeks of no cricket now – light duties if you like.

“A little bit of physical stuff, but nothing weight bearing. He’s got to calm 
down the neck. It’s quite aggravated.”


Peter Handscomb has been named to make his ODI debut in Thursday’s clash with 
Pakistan at the Waca Ground, while Billy Stanlake will replace the rested 
Mitchell Starc.
