108th over: India 391-4 (Nair 71, Vijay 17) Vijay will fancy opening tomorrow 
morning given a softish ball, runs on the board and runs to be had. 
Accordingly, he‚Äôs circumspect against Moeen but then follows one that drifts 
towards the pads, flicking it around the corner for four before delaying just 
enough so that there is no case for a further over. And because Cook moved a 
man from cover to leg-slip, next ball he takes four more through that very 
zone; India are 86 runs behind. STUMPS.

107th over: India 383-4 (Nair 71, Vijay 9) Cheer up Lokesh, give me a smile. 
Probably this over and one more, as Rashid bustles in, Nair taking a single to 
cover before Vijay stretches into a drive for two. The he adds one more, and 
we‚Äôll have a final over before stumps.

106th over: India 379-4 (Nair 70, Vijay 6) Vijay comes down the track and with 
the field up, loft-whips one over midwicket. He doesn‚Äôt get all of it but gets 
enough, clearing the infield for four, the only runs of the over.

NOT OUT!

No edge, but the impact was fully outside the line.

Rashid‚Äôs first ball at Murali Vijay hits the pad, there‚Äôs a confident appeal,

NOOOOOOOOOOO! WICKET! KL Rahul c Buttler b Rashid 199 (India 372-4)

Rashid tosses one wider, Rahul fetches it to take himself there, it bounces 
more than he expects, turns away from him, and he top-edges a dolly. He 
crouches in disbelief; the dressing room are devastated; but he‚Äôs got to go, 
another busted chasing a wide on. Oh man. Brutal, to bat that well for that 
long and leave in a vex.

103rd over: India 372-3 (Rahul 199, Nair 69) So confident was Rahul that Nair 
would still be there when he got back that during that review, he stepped off 
the pitch for a drink. Seven overs left after this yin, bowled by Rashid, and 
Rahul nurses himself through the nervous one-nineties by getting a huge stride 
down the pitch and sweeping it to fine leg. One away, and the crowd go for it!

‚ÄúDid Athers have any comment about flat tracks and the need for more for the 
bowlers in, say, the innings where England were compiling 477?‚Äù asks Jen Oram. 
‚ÄúOr is he just contemplating a drop-in pitch to be dropped in when the 
opposition are batting? A Changing of the Pitch ceremony at the end of each 
innings would greatly add to cricketing tradition, with the ringing of the bell 
and 12th men saluting.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs like that. I‚Äôm sure he wants England to win, but I don‚Äôt 
find him a partial commentator - he wants to watch testing cricket, which this 
isn‚Äôt really.

102nd over: India 368-3 (Rahul 195, Nair 69) Nair gets well forward and helps 
a reverse-sweep around the corner for four - he‚Äôs played that beautifully. And 
then, a review! For something! Inside-edge onto the pad, I think.

100th over: India 361-3 (Rahul 193, Nair 64) Rahul misses a sweep but flicks 
it with his glove and tells the umpire as much as the ball scuttles away for 
four. Ah ha ha ha ha! He then sashays down the track and strokes a gigantic six 
down the ground!

99th over: India 351-3 (Rahul 183, Nair 64) England have to find a way; if 
only they had a wicket-taking bowler fresh and angry. But no, let‚Äôs have some 
more Liam Dawson, because, well. The truth is he‚Äôs actually bowling pretty well 
- and so‚Äôs Moeen at the other end - but there‚Äôs no edge in the middle, no sense 
of danger.

98th over: India 350-3 (Rahul 182, Nair 64) Moeen speeds it up a touch and 
Nair flips two behind square-leg. This is a proper chance for him to secure his 
spot in the side, but after he adds one more and Rahul does likewise, he‚Äôs 
relieved when he tries another flip to one which moves away from him, imparting 
a leading edge which drops just short of the bowler.

97th over: India 346-3 (Rahul 181, Nair 61) Athers reckons this track is too 
flat, and that fair pitches are the single biggest aspect to sustaining Test 
cricket. He wants conditions slightly tilted to the bowlers, and will be 
gratified to know that I agree. Nothing is happening in the middl - well, India 
are proceeding serenely, but nothing out of the ordinary.

96th over: India 343-3 (Rahul 179, Nair 59) Moeen continues, as the 
commentators discuss how flat this track is and how fair they‚Äôve been generally 
through the series. And actually, the same was so in Bangladesh, where the 
tracks really helped the quality of the contests we saw. Three off the over and 
another round of drinks.

94th over: India 337-3 (Rahul 177, Nair 56) On comes Moeen while Stokes plaits 
his arm-hair, and the batsmen milk him with ease for a two and three ones. 
Mortifyingly, hilariously little is happening for England here.

‚ÄúSurely the old Blue Peter Totalizer, which must be lurking in a broom 
cupboard somewhere at Broadcasting House, could be usefully repurposed for 
measuring the Daddy quotient of any given hundred,‚Äù emails Kim Thonger. ‚ÄúIf 
it‚Äôs not to be found you could probably manufacture something similar from egg 
boxes and empty fairy liquid bottles and sticky back plastic from your staff 
canteen and stationery cupboard? I‚Äôm willing to help apply glitter and tinsel.‚Äù

Someone from my primary school was on that because he‚Äôd written in about his 
hobby, keepy-uppy with a balloon, wearing flippers. Wonder if anyone grassed 
his parents to the social.

93rd over: India 332-3 (Rahul 174, Nair 54) Still Stokes picks his nose, 
Dawson replacing Broad. And he‚Äôs soon cursing when one skids on and clips 
Rahul‚Äôs outside edge, rushing away for four. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm amazed by how often England 
have bowled their sixth bowler in this series,‚Äù says Nasser, reminding us once

92nd over: India 326-3 (Rahul 169, Nair 53) The players sup some juice at the 
end of a gently chastening mini-session for England, who dropped a difficult 
catch and generally struggled to make an impression. They‚Äôll know that they‚Äôre 
going to be toiling for quite sometime yet; quiet desperation is the English 
way, and all that. Anyway, Nair flicks a brace into the leg side and then flows 
into a drive that brings up his maiden Test fifty - he seriously enjoys it too, 
sharing the moment with his clubmate. Milestone secured, he‚Äôs back to blocking, 
before some swing - looks like reverse - from Ball dangles the mirage of 
imminent success in English coupons.

91st over: India 320-3 (Rahul 169, Nair 47) So, what‚Äôs England‚Äôs attack at the 
start of the Test summer? There‚Äôs a seamer‚Äôs spot up for grabs, I guess, which 
might go to Mark Wood - or Steven Finn, obviously. Is that even a joke, I don‚Äôt

put down to experience. One off the over.

90th over: India 319-3 (Rahul 169, Nair 46) Nasser agrees that Stokes should 
have the ball; he‚Äôs only bowled nine overs this innings, fewer than anyone but 
Root despite his shamanic, bothamic qualities. Anyway, Ball‚Äôs hitting the pitch 
hard and he catches Rahul on the crease with one that straightens - but on 165, 
he‚Äôs got hours to adjust, safely guiding it where second slip isn‚Äôt for four.

89th over: India 314-3 (Rahul 165, Nair 45) Neither side took a review in the 
first 80 overs, which has got to be unusual, at least. Broad is working his 
buttocks off here, pounding it in outside off as Nair nears a maiden Test 
fifty. Accordingly, he‚Äôs super-watchful, in the way that people who say 
super-anything are super-annoying. One off the over.

It‚Äôs they way they tell ‚Äôem.

88th over: India 313-3 (Rahul 165, Nair 44) Rahul crafts a single from a short 
one and then Nair bumps to cover, bringing up the hunnert partnership. And he 
follows it with a lovely whip to midwicket, which only gets him two but was a 
very fine shot.

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs dawned on me that REM are cricket fans,‚Äù emails Andrew Benton. 
‚Äú‚ÄôConsider this, the hint of the century, consider this, the slip that brought 
me to my knees failed‚Äô‚Äù. Losing my Religion is their batsman‚Äôs anthem. I feel 
rather enlightened. Makes up for the lack of wickets, for a bit at least.‚Äù

Also, Nightswimming was a prophesy about Andrew Flintoff.

87th over: India 309-3 (Rahul 162, Nair 43) Nair tucks a single into the leg 
side to bring up India‚Äôs 300, at they‚Äôll be contemplating a first-innings lead, 
I shouldn‚Äôt wonder. And they‚Äôre four closer to it when Rahul chucks hands at 
one that isn‚Äôt that wide at all, four rushing between slip and gully via 
outside edge; if you‚Äôre going to go, go hard. Broad is absolutely shaking with 
laughter at the hilarity of it all, all the more so as Rahul now has his 
highest score in Tests, and he promptly adds two more just backward of square 
on the off side, then a single. A pair to Nair on top of that makes for an 
expensive over.

‚ÄúRe. Broad churches,‚Äô says Robert Wilson, who is back. ‚ÄúGuy Hornsby (81st 
over). I can take ‚Äòem or leave ‚Äòem. Certainly if they‚Äôre slipping Imran Khan in 
before Wasim Akram. That would, in no way, be an ecumenical matter.‚Äù

86th over: India 299-3 (Rahul 155, Nair 40) Ball charges in and begins with a 
held-back yorker - nicely done - and then hustles through a quicker one that 
has Nair slashing and edging! But, diving to his right, Cook can only push it 
over the bar and it runs away for four. It came very quickly at him, but was a 
chance nonetheless, and he looks pensive thereafter. He then removes himself 
from the cordon with hurt pride  fingers as Ball powers through an aggressive 
over with no reward.

85th over: India 292-3 (Rahul 154, Nair 34) Broad returns so England take the 
new ball and there‚Äôs a bit of movement into the batsman, but Rahul is pretty 
set, so negotiates five deliveries after Nair nurdles a single. The stench of 
imminent wickets is conspicuous by its absence.

more freely so far this session.

82nd over: India 286-3 (Rahul 149, Nair 33) In commentary, they‚Äôre still 
discussing hurled-ballgate - Root was clear he didn‚Äôt do it on purpose, Rahul 
wasn‚Äôt allowing an apology to sub in for a telling. Another quiet over, four 
from it, and Nair is in now.

‚ÄúRe: Robert Wilson,‚Äù emails Guy Hornsby, ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt have to be classics v 
modern. It‚Äôs not a binary choice. I love Dave Eggers, Irvine Welsh & Murakami, 
just as much as I do Dickens, Hemingway and Conan Doyle. We can all like 
Stokes, Kohli, Anderson & Williamson just as much as we revere Gower, Richards, 
Bradman & Imran? There‚Äôs room for mavericks, classicists and, yes, even KP. The 
OBO, like life, is a broad church.‚Äù

Without wanting to speak for Mr Wilson, I think he‚Äôs differentiating between 
quality and not quality - subjectively, of course.

81st over: India 282-3 (Rahul 146, Nair 32) On comes Root to quickly nab a 
crucial wicket, so Nair takes two into the covers then four via reverse-sweep. 
Then, after a single, Root wildly humps the ball in the direction of the 
batsman, marginally out of his ground, apologises twice, then responds to some 
verbals.


‚ÄúA Daddy is 150-190s,‚Äù reckons John Starbuck, ‚Äúa Stepfather is 100-149, a 200+ 
is either a Grandad or Bloody Marvellous. 50+ ought to be a Mummy but in these 
supposedly-equal times probably isn‚Äôt. And you use hyphens mainly for 
adjectives, thus ‚Äòa well-played game‚Äô is different from ‚ÄòWell played!‚Äô‚Äù

Yes, but they‚Äôre appearing all-over the place to show a figure of speech, as 
per all-over, rather than tow words which mean different things when connected 
and when not.

79th over: India 273-3 (Rahul 145, Nair 24) So, some new ball is imminent, if 
England take it, and I wonder if Stokes will be allowed the benefit - I suppose 
not, which‚Äôll teach him for being nifty with the old one. Two from the over.

77th over: India 268-3 (Rahul 143, Nair 21) Stokes hurls himself through 
another over, the second ball of which disappears for four when Rahul opens the 
face horizontally and flicks four over the infield. Lovely shot, followed up by 
a turn into the leg side for two more, a single, and an edged single by Nair. 
Naturally, Stokes giggles before shaking him warmly by the hand.

75th over: India 258-3 (Rahul 135, Nair 19) Stokes gets us going - can he find 
any reverse? He begins with a bouncer, of course he does, and the over cedes 
two when Rahul drives into the off side. Decent start, but not a menacing one.

‚ÄúDaniel, Daniel,‚Äù begins Robert Wilson. ‚ÄúGet back to the cricket, old thing. 
Trainspotting is literature for people who think The Matrix is philosophy. 
Choose McIlvanney, choose Alisdair Gray, even choose Kelman. But don‚Äôt choose 
this dunder-headed, faintly right-wing, tin-eared geek‚Äôs fantasy of a 
drug-habit (junkies are actually amongst the most civic-minded and aspirational 
types you could meet).
That was also the most hyphens I could find in the drawer.‚Äù


Alasdair. Sorry! But, in my defence, you did ask for it. I‚Äôm actually in the 
middle of How Late It Was, How Late - and have been for a long time. I don‚Äôt 
get the fuss, I‚Äôm afraid. Trainspotting has a phenomenal energy that I didn‚Äôt 
find in Lanark either, and it‚Äôs a lot funnier. Oh, and you can tell Irvine 
Welsh that he‚Äôs right-wing.

So, there we go. England remain in the ascendancy, but can they find the edge 
to rustle India? Er, probably not, and while we‚Äôre here, hasn‚Äôt KL Rahul batted 
well? That‚Äôa a rhetorical question, but yes he has.

74th over: India 256-3 (Rahul 133, Nair 19) Last over before tea, and it‚Äôs 
been a decent session for your Englands, Pujara and Kohli hutched and only 76 
scored; make that 80 when Cook brings close fielders in, to short-leg and 
gully, then Rashid drops short and Nair carts him from outside off to the 
midwicket fence. And then Nair picks the googly from the hand, nipping to leg 
and glancing two more to fine leg.

73rd over: India 249-3 (Rahul 132, Nair 13) Moeen replaces Ball as we see a 
collection of nasty-arse throws that Bairsterr has been forced to field, some 
on the bounce and some clattering into palm and fingers. Three from the over 
and bit of turn, but not much else.

72nd over: India 246-3 (Rahul 130, Nair 12) Rashid finds some dip but Rahul 
gets down so quickly that he turns it into a half-volley and punishes it 
through extra cover for four. That was a decent ball, made to look rubbish, and 
a two and a one follow.

71st over: India 239-3 (Rahul 123, Nair 12) Ball tries a slower one but Nair 
plays it well, waiting to open the face and guide it behind. Then another, 
which prompts a hurried single - had Dawson hit with his shy, Rahul was gone - 
so three from the over. England have bowled really well this session, but need 
to convert parsimony to wickets pretty quickly.

KL Rahul‚Äôs epic knock for India makes victory for England a tall order

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/18/india-england-fifth-test-day-three> 
108th over: India 391-4 (Nair 71, Vijay 17) Vijay will fancy opening tomorrow 
morning given a softish ball, runs on the board and runs to be had. 
Accordingly, he‚Äôs circumspect against Moeen but then follows one that drifts 
towards the pads, flicking it around the corner for four before delaying just 
enough so that there is no case for a further over. And because Cook moved a 
man from cover to leg-slip, next ball he takes four more through that very 
zone; India are 86 runs behind. STUMPS.
 
107th over: India 383-4 (Nair 71, Vijay 9) Cheer up Lokesh, give me a smile. 
Probably this over and one more, as Rashid bustles in, Nair taking a single to 
cover before Vijay stretches into a drive for two. The he adds one more, and 
we‚Äôll have a final over before stumps.

106th over: India 379-4 (Nair 70, Vijay 6) Vijay comes down the track and with 
the field up, loft-whips one over midwicket. He doesn‚Äôt get all of it but gets 
enough, clearing the infield for four, the only runs of the over.

2016 <https://twitter.com/englandcricket/status/810444768236945408>  
105th over: India 375-4 (Nair 70, Vijay 2) Mate, it‚Äôs just a number, 
seriously, don‚Äôt be feart of numbers, I mean who hasn‚Äôt got a Test 
double-century? Who even wants one, it‚Äôs an act of rebellion getting out on 
199, believe Kurt Cobain would approve.
 
104th over: India 374-4 (Nair 70, Vijay 1) Well, that escalated quickly. 
Anyway, Vijay, in cap, nurdles his way off the mark, and we‚Äôve got 12 minutes 
of play left today. Poor KL Rahul!
 
103rd over: India 372-4 (Nair 69, Vijay 0) So, a partnership of 161; pretty 
good going, and yet poor KL will be up all night detesting himself. Welcome to 
the world, buddy.
 
No edge, but the impact was fully outside the line. 
 
Rashid‚Äôs first ball at Murali Vijay hits the pad, there‚Äôs a confident appeal, 
rejected, so England have a look.
 
Rashid tosses one wider, Rahul fetches it to take himself there, it bounces 
more than he expects, turns away from him, and he top-edges a dolly. He 
crouches in disbelief; the dressing room are devastated; but he‚Äôs got to go, 
another busted chasing a wide on. Oh man. Brutal, to bat that well for that 
long and leave in a vex.
 
103rd over: India 372-3 (Rahul 199, Nair 69) So confident was Rahul that Nair 
would still be there when he got back that during that review, he stepped off 
the pitch for a drink. Seven overs left after this yin, bowled by Rashid, and 
Rahul nurses himself through the nervous one-nineties by getting a huge stride 
down the pitch and sweeping it to fine leg. One away, and the crowd go for it!

‚ÄúDid Athers have any comment about flat tracks and the need for more for the 
bowlers in, say, the innings where England were compiling 477?‚Äù asks Jen Oram. 
‚ÄúOr is he just contemplating a drop-in pitch to be dropped in when the 
opposition are batting? A Changing of the Pitch ceremony at the end of each 
innings would greatly add to cricketing tradition, with the ringing of the bell 
and 12th men saluting.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs like that. I‚Äôm sure he wants England to win, but I don‚Äôt 
find him a partial commentator - he wants to watch testing cricket, which this 
isn‚Äôt really.
 
Or something like that. 
 
102nd over: India 368-3 (Rahul 195, Nair 69) Nair gets well forward and helps 
a reverse-sweep around the corner for four - he‚Äôs played that beautifully. And 
then, a review! For something! Inside-edge onto the pad, I think.
 
101st over: India 363-3 (Rahul 194, Nair 65) Everything crashed, I‚Äôm afraid, 
but you get my drift,
 
100th over: India 361-3 (Rahul 193, Nair 64) Rahul misses a sweep but flicks 
it with his glove and tells the umpire as much as the ball scuttles away for 
four. Ah ha ha ha ha! He then sashays down the track and strokes a gigantic six 
down the ground!
 
99th over: India 351-3 (Rahul 183, Nair 64) England have to find a way; if 
only they had a wicket-taking bowler fresh and angry. But no, let‚Äôs have some 
more Liam Dawson, because, well. The truth is he‚Äôs actually bowling pretty well 
- and so‚Äôs Moeen at the other end - but there‚Äôs no edge in the middle, no sense 
of danger.
 
98th over: India 350-3 (Rahul 182, Nair 64) Moeen speeds it up a touch and 
Nair flips two behind square-leg. This is a proper chance for him to secure his 
spot in the side, but after he adds one more and Rahul does likewise, he‚Äôs 
relieved when he tries another flip to one which moves away from him, imparting 
a leading edge which drops just short of the bowler.
 
97th over: India 346-3 (Rahul 181, Nair 61) Athers reckons this track is too 
flat, and that fair pitches are the single biggest aspect to sustaining Test 
cricket. He wants conditions slightly tilted to the bowlers, and will be 
gratified to know that I agree. Nothing is happening in the middl - well, India 
are proceeding serenely, but nothing out of the ordinary.

‚Äú1970s Blue Peter hyphen alert‚Äô emails Andrew Benton. ‚ÄúSticky-back plastic or 
sticky back-plastic. What‚Äôs the environmentally-friendly option for the 
millennial child?‚Äù

I‚Äôd happily have seen Peter Duncan attached to some sticky back-plastic. 

 
96th over: India 343-3 (Rahul 179, Nair 59) Moeen continues, as the 
commentators discuss how flat this track is and how fair they‚Äôve been generally 
through the series. And actually, the same was so in Bangladesh, where the 
tracks really helped the quality of the contests we saw. Three off the over and 
another round of drinks.
 
95th over: India 340-3 (Rahul 178, Nair 58) Single off the first ball of 
Dawson‚Äôs latest over, and then he slows one down, which Rahul doesn‚Äôt spot, 
carvingjust over cover. And Dawson follows it up well too, inducing a false 
drive and an inside edge, then an outside edge.

‚ÄúI imagine ‚Äòshorter of breath and one day closer to death‚Äô is exactly how the 
England fielders will be feeling at stumps,‚Äù tweets Justin Horton.
 
94th over: India 337-3 (Rahul 177, Nair 56) On comes Moeen while Stokes plaits 
his arm-hair, and the batsmen milk him with ease for a two and three ones. 
Mortifyingly, hilariously little is happening for England here.

‚ÄúSurely the old Blue Peter Totalizer, which must be lurking in a broom 
cupboard somewhere at Broadcasting House, could be usefully repurposed for 
measuring the Daddy quotient of any given hundred,‚Äù emails Kim Thonger. ‚ÄúIf 
it‚Äôs not to be found you could probably manufacture something similar from egg 
boxes and empty fairy liquid bottles and sticky back plastic from your staff 
canteen and stationery cupboard? I‚Äôm willing to help apply glitter and tinsel.‚Äù

Someone from my primary school was on that because he‚Äôd written in about his 
hobby, keepy-uppy with a balloon, wearing flippers. Wonder if anyone grassed 
his parents to the social.
 
93rd over: India 332-3 (Rahul 174, Nair 54) Still Stokes picks his nose, 
Dawson replacing Broad. And he‚Äôs soon cursing when one skids on and clips 
Rahul‚Äôs outside edge, rushing away for four. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm amazed by how often England 
have bowled their sixth bowler in this series,‚Äù says Nasser, reminding us once 
again that Stokes has only sent down nine overs.

92nd over: India 326-3 (Rahul 169, Nair 53) The players sup some juice at the 
end of a gently chastening mini-session for England, who dropped a difficult 
catch and generally struggled to make an impression. They‚Äôll know that they‚Äôre 
going to be toiling for quite sometime yet; quiet desperation is the English 
way, and all that. Anyway, Nair flicks a brace into the leg side and then flows 
into a drive that brings up his maiden Test fifty - he seriously enjoys it too, 
sharing the moment with his clubmate. Milestone secured, he‚Äôs back to blocking, 
before some swing - looks like reverse - from Ball dangles the mirage of 
imminent success in English coupons.
 
91st over: India 320-3 (Rahul 169, Nair 47) So, what‚Äôs England‚Äôs attack at the 
start of the Test summer? There‚Äôs a seamer‚Äôs spot up for grabs, I guess, which 
might go to Mark Wood - or Steven Finn, obviously. Is that even a joke, I don‚Äôt 
know. But most likely, it‚Äôll stay with Chris Woakes, whose tricky tour will be 
put down to experience. One off the over.
 
90th over: India 319-3 (Rahul 169, Nair 46) Nasser agrees that Stokes should 
have the ball; he‚Äôs only bowled nine overs this innings, fewer than anyone but 
Root despite his shamanic, bothamic qualities. Anyway, Ball‚Äôs hitting the pitch 
hard and he catches Rahul on the crease with one that straightens - but on 165, 
he‚Äôs got hours to adjust, safely guiding it where second slip isn‚Äôt for four.
 
89th over: India 314-3 (Rahul 165, Nair 45) Neither side took a review in the 
first 80 overs, which has got to be unusual, at least. Broad is working his 
buttocks off here, pounding it in outside off as Nair nears a maiden Test 
fifty. Accordingly, he‚Äôs super-watchful, in the way that people who say 
super-anything are super-annoying. One off the over.

It‚Äôs they way they tell ‚Äôem.

88th over: India 313-3 (Rahul 165, Nair 44) Rahul crafts a single from a short 
one and then Nair bumps to cover, bringing up the hunnert partnership. And he 
follows it with a lovely whip to midwicket, which only gets him two but was a 
very fine shot.

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs dawned on me that REM are cricket fans,‚Äù emails Andrew Benton. 
‚Äú‚ÄôConsider this, the hint of the century, consider this, the slip that brought 
me to my knees failed‚Äô‚Äù. Losing my Religion is their batsman‚Äôs anthem. I feel 
rather enlightened. Makes up for the lack of wickets, for a bit at least.‚Äù

Also, Nightswimming was a prophesy about Andrew Flintoff.

87th over: India 309-3 (Rahul 162, Nair 43) Nair tucks a single into the leg 
side to bring up India‚Äôs 300, at they‚Äôll be contemplating a first-innings lead, 
I shouldn‚Äôt wonder. And they‚Äôre four closer to it when Rahul chucks hands at 
one that isn‚Äôt that wide at all, four rushing between slip and gully via 
outside edge; if you‚Äôre going to go, go hard. Broad is absolutely shaking with 
laughter at the hilarity of it all, all the more so as Rahul now has his 
highest score in Tests, and he promptly adds two more just backward of square 
on the off side, then a single. A pair to Nair on top of that makes for an 
expensive over.

‚ÄúRe. Broad churches,‚Äô says Robert Wilson, who is back. ‚ÄúGuy Hornsby (81st 
over). I can take ‚Äòem or leave ‚Äòem. Certainly if they‚Äôre slipping Imran Khan in 
before Wasim Akram. That would, in no way, be an ecumenical matter.‚Äù
 
86th over: India 299-3 (Rahul 155, Nair 40) Ball charges in and begins with a 
held-back yorker - nicely done - and then hustles through a quicker one that 
has Nair slashing and edging! But, diving to his right, Cook can only push it 
over the bar and it runs away for four. It came very quickly at him, but was a 
chance nonetheless, and he looks pensive thereafter. He then removes himself 
from the cordon with hurt pride  fingers as Ball powers through an aggressive 
over with no reward.
 
85th over: India 292-3 (Rahul 154, Nair 34) Broad returns so England take the 
new ball and there‚Äôs a bit of movement into the batsman, but Rahul is pretty 
set, so negotiates five deliveries after Nair nurdles a single. The stench of 
imminent wickets is conspicuous by its absence.
 
84th over: India 291-3 (Rahul 154, Nair 33) Rahul must fancy himself for a 
double now, while Nair will just want something subsubsubsubsubstatial, a can 
of beans or blackeyed peas, some Nescafe and ice. An candy bar, a falling star 
or a reading of Dr Seuss. Maiden from Dawson.
 
83rd over: India 291-3 (Rahul 154, Nair 33) And there‚Äôs the Shirley Crabtree, 
Rahul timing a clip beautifully through the leg side for four; that‚Äôs his 
one-fifty, his second in Tests. And he then adds a single; India have scored 
more freely so far this session.
 
82nd over: India 286-3 (Rahul 149, Nair 33) In commentary, they‚Äôre still 
discussing hurled-ballgate - Root was clear he didn‚Äôt do it on purpose, Rahul 
wasn‚Äôt allowing an apology to sub in for a telling. Another quiet over, four 
from it, and Nair is in now.

‚ÄúRe: Robert Wilson,‚Äù emails Guy Hornsby, ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt have to be classics v 
modern. It‚Äôs not a binary choice. I love Dave Eggers, Irvine Welsh & Murakami, 
just as much as I do Dickens, Hemingway and Conan Doyle. We can all like 
Stokes, Kohli, Anderson & Williamson just as much as we revere Gower, Richards, 
Bradman & Imran? There‚Äôs room for mavericks, classicists and, yes, even KP. The 
OBO, like life, is a broad church.‚Äù

Without wanting to speak for Mr Wilson, I think he‚Äôs differentiating between 
quality and not quality - subjectively, of course.
 
81st over: India 282-3 (Rahul 146, Nair 32) On comes Root to quickly nab a 
crucial wicket, so Nair takes two into the covers then four via reverse-sweep. 
Then, after a single, Root wildly humps the ball in the direction of the 
batsman, marginally out of his ground, apologises twice, then responds to some 
verbals.


‚ÄúA Daddy is 150-190s,‚Äù reckons John Starbuck, ‚Äúa Stepfather is 100-149, a 200+ 
is either a Grandad or Bloody Marvellous. 50+ ought to be a Mummy but in these 
supposedly-equal times probably isn‚Äôt. And you use hyphens mainly for 
adjectives, thus ‚Äòa well-played game‚Äô is different from ‚ÄòWell played!‚Äô‚Äù

Yes, but they‚Äôre appearing all-over the place to show a figure of speech, as 
per all-over, rather than tow words which mean different things when connected 
and when not.
 
80th over: India 275-3 (Rahul 146, Nair 25) Dawson is probing outside off and 
forces Rahul back, but, well, he‚Äôs coping. Two from the over, the second new 
ball is due, and Broad nips off - maybe one more over with the old, then,
 
79th over: India 273-3 (Rahul 145, Nair 24) So, some new ball is imminent, if 
England take it, and I wonder if Stokes will be allowed the benefit - I suppose 
not, which‚Äôll teach him for being nifty with the old one. Two from the over.
 
78th over: India 271-3 (Rahul 144, Nair 23) Dawson has a short-leg - should 
that be hyphenated? I don‚Äôt-know - and a slip. Nair is beginning to look 
settled either way and Rahul is in for a daddy. How many is a daddy, anyway? 
More than 150?
 
77th over: India 268-3 (Rahul 143, Nair 21) Stokes hurls himself through 
another over, the second ball of which disappears for four when Rahul opens the 
face horizontally and flicks four over the infield. Lovely shot, followed up by 
a turn into the leg side for two more, a single, and an edged single by Nair. 
Naturally, Stokes giggles before shaking him warmly by the hand.
 
76th over: India 260-3 (Rahul 135, Nair 19) Dawson, who‚Äôs bowled pretty well, 
has the ball, and Nair and Rahul take a single each - their partnership is now 
49 off 88.
 
75th over: India 258-3 (Rahul 135, Nair 19) Stokes gets us going - can he find 
any reverse? He begins with a bouncer, of course he does, and the over cedes 
two when Rahul drives into the off side. Decent start, but not a menacing one.
 
So, off we go again. 
 
P.S. I hated the Matrix. 
 
‚ÄúDaniel, Daniel,‚Äù begins Robert Wilson. ‚ÄúGet back to the cricket, old thing. 
Trainspotting is literature for people who think The Matrix is philosophy. 
Choose McIlvanney, choose Alisdair Gray, even choose Kelman. But don‚Äôt choose 
this dunder-headed, faintly right-wing, tin-eared geek‚Äôs fantasy of a 
drug-habit (junkies are actually amongst the most civic-minded and aspirational 
types you could meet).
That was also the most hyphens I could find in the drawer.‚Äù


Alasdair. Sorry! But, in my defence, you did ask for it. I‚Äôm actually in the 
middle of How Late It Was, How Late - and have been for a long time. I don‚Äôt 
get the fuss, I‚Äôm afraid. Trainspotting has a phenomenal energy that I didn‚Äôt 
find in Lanark either, and it‚Äôs a lot funnier. Oh, and you can tell Irvine 
Welsh that he‚Äôs right-wing.
 
So, there we go. England remain in the ascendancy, but can they find the edge 
to rustle India? Er, probably not, and while we‚Äôre here, hasn‚Äôt KL Rahul batted 
well? That‚Äôa a rhetorical question, but yes he has.
 
74th over: India 256-3 (Rahul 133, Nair 19) Last over before tea, and it‚Äôs 
been a decent session for your Englands, Pujara and Kohli hutched and only 76 
scored; make that 80 when Cook brings close fielders in, to short-leg and 
gully, then Rashid drops short and Nair carts him from outside off to the 
midwicket fence. And then Nair picks the googly from the hand, nipping to leg 
and glancing two more to fine leg.
 
73rd over: India 249-3 (Rahul 132, Nair 13) Moeen replaces Ball as we see a 
collection of nasty-arse throws that Bairsterr has been forced to field, some 
on the bounce and some clattering into palm and fingers. Three from the over 
and bit of turn, but not much else.
 
72nd over: India 246-3 (Rahul 130, Nair 12) Rashid finds some dip but Rahul 
gets down so quickly that he turns it into a half-volley and punishes it 
through extra cover for four. That was a decent ball, made to look rubbish, and 
a two and a one follow.
 
71st over: India 239-3 (Rahul 123, Nair 12) Ball tries a slower one but Nair 
plays it well, waiting to open the face and guide it behind. Then another, 
which prompts a hurried single - had Dawson hit with his shy, Rahul was gone - 
so three from the over. England have bowled really well this session, but need 
to convert parsimony to wickets pretty quickly.
