 * Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> postponed an 
event in which he was expected to unveil Indiana governor Mike Pence as his 
vice-presidential candidate after a terrorist attack in Nice, France, that has 
left at least 77 people dead. A Republican source had told the Guardian that 
the Republican frontrunner had chosen Pence, the governor of Indiana, to be his 
running mate. 
 * Pence would represent a safe choice who would solidify the Republican base 
and is popular with social conservatives. In order to choose Pence, Trump has 
to make a decision by noon on Friday, the deadline for the Indiana governor to 
drop his bid for re-election. Trump had announced that he will officially 
unveil his vice-presidential choice at 11am on Friday in New York buttweeted 
Thursday night <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/753728269019549696> 
“in light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow’s 
news conference concerning my vice presidential announcement.” 
 * Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told the 
Washington Examiner 
<http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-explains-palins-absence-from-gop-convention-speakers/article/2596490#.V4e9FGvyS5s.twitter>
 that former Alaska governor Sarah Palin will not be speaking at the Republican 
National Convention in Cleveland next week because Alaska is “a long ways 
away.” “She was asked,” Trump told the Washington Examiner in a phone 
interview. “It’s a little bit difficult because of where she is. We love Sarah. 
Little bit difficult because of, you know, it’s a long ways away.” 
 * Speaking of would-be convention speakers, former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow 
has brushed off reports that he was a planned speaker at the upcoming 
Republican National Convention, despite confirmation that he was set to speak 
at the RNC from senior advisers to the Donald Trump campaign this morning. 
“Just got back from the Philippines and I wake up this morning to find out that 
I’m speaking at the Republican National Convention!” Tebow, who became famous 
as much for his devout Christianity as for his short career as the quarterback 
for the long-suffering Denver Broncos. “It’s amazing how fast rumors fly, and 
that’s exactly what it is - a rumor.” 
 * Supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg executed a full U-turn on over 
remarks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/ruth-bader-ginsburg-donald-trump>
 about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that 
ignited controversy on the eve of the GOP convention. Her remarks about Trump 
were “ill-advised”, she said, adding: “I regret making them.” Facebook

Grassroots conservatives alleged that the Republican National Committee pulled 
out from a deal to reform RNC rules at the last minute as a potential “floor 
fight” – a contested vote on the floor – looms over next week’s Republican 
national convention.

Former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli, the leader of a bloc of 
social conservative activists, told reporters on Thursday night that he 
expected multiple minority reports to proposed rules of the Republican party. 
Any minority report, which requires the signatures of one quarter of the rules 
committee, would automatically be debated and voted upon on the floor of the 
convention.

Cuccinelli, who previously led the delegate-counting efforts for Ted Cruz’s 
presidential campaign before the Texas senator dropped out, said “sincere 
efforts were made by RNC and Trump people and coalition of grassroots 
conservatives to come to agreement to make the party run better for the 
grassroots”. However, Cuccinelli added: “This morning after a deal had been 
tentatively reached the RNC pulled out of it.” The 2013 Republican nominee for 
governor of Virginia insisted that he had only decided to speak to reporters 
about it in order to correct what he described as inaccurate reporting on the 
subject.

The prominent conservative activist said that negotiations fell apart on the 
issue of “bonus delegates” for states that held closed presidential primaries, 
open only to registeredRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans>. He said that his alliance of 
activists and the RNC failed to agree on a mathematical formula in back and 
forth negotiations.

Cuccinelli said the negotiations involved his conservatives conceding a number 
of points including any changes to RNC governance, such as a ban on registered 
lobbyists serving on the RNC.

Sean Spicer, the chief strategist for the RNC, disputed Cuccinelli’s version. 
He noted, “negotiating isn’t giving in to what everyone wants. There’s a bigger 
package in play and the RNC wanted to ensure all the sides were represented.” 
The top GOP operative added that the RNC represented GOP activists from across 
the country who had elected its members.

Cleveland <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cleveland> officials have 
expressed concern about the Ohio “open carry” state laws that will allow people 
to take guns to events organized close to the Republican party convention – but 
have not given assurances of how they will police the use of guns and banned 
objects in crowded areas, where the atmosphere is likely to be highly charged.

assets. Photograph: Michael Mathes/AFP/Getty Images 
Guns will not be allowed into the convention itself, which is being held 
inside the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland and policed by the secret service, 
or inside a tight perimeter immediately surrounding the venue.

But in a broad space outside those inner security rings, near the arena, in a 
large area loosely known as the event zone, guns will be allowed in an 
open-carry situation and, with a valid permit, to be carried while concealed.

While guns will be allowed in that zone, toy guns are banned. The city has 
declared a long list of other items that are prohibited from being taken into 
the event zone during the convention, which begins on Monday with the GOP 
readying itself to anointDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as its nominee for the White 
House.

Prohibited items range from glass bottles to lengths of rope and knives, and 
from tennis balls to lasers, gas masks, sledgehammers and drones, according to 
a list issued by the Cleveland authorities. Umbrellas with sharp tips are 
banned. So are pellet guns. But ordinary guns and bullets must be permitted if

Former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow brushed off reports that he was a planned 
speaker at the upcoming Republican National Convention, despite confirmation 
that he was set to speak at the RNC from senior advisers to theDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> campaign this morning:

“Just got back from the Philippines and I wake up this morning to find out 
that I’m speaking at the Republican National Convention!” Tebow, who became 
famous as much for his devout Christianity as for his short career as the 
quarterback for the long-suffering Denver Broncos. “It’s amazing how fast 
rumors fly, and that’s exactly what it is - a rumor.”

“My goal has always been to be able to make a difference in the biggest way 
possible,” Tebow continued. “And if one day that’s in the political realm, then 
that’s what I’ll do. But right now I really believe that’s through my 
foundation... but I love our country and I’ll do anything for America.”

The remarks, which sound scripted, come on the heels of speculation that the 
RNC is currently begging for funds to cover a $6 million budget shortfall.

RNC organizers ask Sheldon Adelson to cover $6 million shortfall

The organizers of the imminent Republican National Convention have penned an 
earnest letter to casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson in the hopes of getting 
Adelson to cover a $6 million shortfall in covering next week’s events,
according to Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/rnc-begs-adelson-for-6-million-to-cover-convention-shortfall-225571>
.

Naming more than two dozen wealthy backers and companies that have bowed out 
of donating more than $8.1 million in pledged funds to cover the convention, 
the Cleveland 2016 host committee cited “negative publicity” aroundDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as the reason for the 
shortfall.

“Over the past couple months, negative publicity around our potential nominee 
resulted in a considerable number of pledges backing out from their 
commitments,” the letter said. Included among the people and groups that have 
reneged on their donations: David Koch, Coca-Cola, FedEx, Pepsi and Visa.

“We would greatly appreciate if you would consider a $6,000,000 contribution 
to the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee to help us cross the finish line,” the 
letter continues. “Your support will allow our community to meet its obligation 
to the RNC, and will ensure our Republican nominee has the best possible 
platform to lay out his conservative case for our nation. Thank you for your 
consideration and please let us know if you need any additional information.”

The letter is dated July 12, six days before the beginning of the convention.

In response to a question asked by Diamond Reynolds, the girlfriend of 
Philando Castile, the 32-year-old fatally shot by Minnesota police last week, 
President Barack Obama said that the duty to reduce violence between police 
officers and suspects is on both law enforcement and minority communities.

“My heart goes out to all the families who have been involved, and I can only 
imagine what you’re going through,” Obama said. “I think that the place to 
start is for everybody to recognize that we need police officers and we need 
those police officers to be embraced by the community. If there are good 
relations between police and those communities, then those communities will be 
safer and police are going to be safer.”

“The more police departments know communities… the more trust is built,” Obama 
continued. “Police departments that are doing the best work are also training 
their officers not just on shooting… not just on the technical aspects of 
police work, but they’re also training those officers on… how we get rid of 
those implicit biases.”

“I think if we’re honest with ourselves, because of the history of our country 
and because of the images we receive as we’re growing up,” Obama continued, 
“oftentimes there’s a presumption that black men are dangerous.”

“It can’t just be all on the police, it’s also got to be on the community, 
it’s got to be on civic leaders, it’s got to be on churches and it’s got to be 
on us.”

President Obama issues statement on events in Nice, France:

On behalf of the American people, I condemn in the strongest terms what 
appears to be a horrific terrorist attack in Nice, France, which killed and 
wounded dozens of innocent civilians. Our thought and prayers are with the 
families and other loved ones of those killed, and we wish a full recovery for 
the many wounded. I have directed my team to be in touch with French officials, 
and we have offered any assistance that they may need to investigate this 
attack and bring those responsible to justice. We stand in solidarity and 
partnership with France, our oldest ally, as they respond to and recover from 
this attack.

On this Bastille Day, we are reminded of the extraordinary resilience and 
democratic values that have made France an inspiration to the entire world, and 
we know that the character of the French Republic will endure long after this 
devastating and tragic loss of life.

Donald Trump postpones running-mate announcement after Nice attack

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has postponed 
an event in which he was expected to unveil Mike Pence as his vice-presidential 
candidate after the tragedy in Nice, France, in which more than 60 people were 
killed.

A Republican source had told the Guardian that the Republican frontrunner had 
chosen Pence, the governor of Indiana, to be his running mate.

Pence would represent a safe choice who would solidify the Republican base and 
is popular with social conservatives.

In order to choose Pence, Trump had to make a decision by noon on Friday, the 
deadline for the Indiana governor to drop his bid for re-election. Indiana law 
prevents a candidate for seeking election to multiple offices.

Trump had announced that he will officially unveil his vice-presidential 
choice at 11am on Friday in New York buttweeted Thursday night 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/753728269019549696> “in light of 
the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow’s news 
conference concerning my vice presidential announcement.”

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment as to 
when the announcement would be rescheduled.

As Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump inch closer to choosing their running mates
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/14/vice-president-picks-trump-clinton-conventions-running-mate>
 ahead of their respective party conventions, the two unshowy figures are 
facing great scrutiny.

Reynolds/EPA 
Tim Kaine, a senator and former governor of Virginia, took the stage with 
Clinton in his home state on Thursday armed with one-liners that sought to 
frame the choice before the American electorate this November.

“Do you want a ‘You’re fired’ president or a ‘You’re hired’ president?” Kaine 
said, invoking Trump’s infamous slogan from The Apprentice.

“Do you want a trash-talker president or a bridge-builder president? Do you 
want a me-first president or a kids-and-families-first president?”

The critiques, made before a packed gymnasium at the Northern Virginia 
Community College, rolled off his tongue as more of a mild-mannered 
disagreement than a scathing takedown.

But Kaine, a centrist Democrat who is well-liked by colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle, wasn’t looking to put on a performance. If chosen by Clinton, 
would instead reinforce her premise of that the Democratic ticket will be one 
of experience and competency over bluster and bravado.

The joint appearance came hours after Trump’s campaign signaled its own 
intention to announce Mike Pence as its vice-presidential pick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/14/donald-trump-picks-mike-pence-running-mate-vice-president>
 – although Trump aides tried to sow doubts ahead of a planned Friday morning 
unveiling.

Pence, like Kaine, is broadly respected by elected officials within his party 
and similarly known for his polite disposition. And as the governor of Indiana 
and a staunch conservative, he is regarded as one of the few options before 
Trump who could bring a sense of legitimacy to a candidacy yet to persuade a 
large swath of skeptical Republicans.

The former chairman of the agency that controls New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> City-area airports conspired 
with a United Airlines lobbyist to get the airline to run direct flights to 
South Carolina so that the executive could more easily visit his vacation home, 
prosecutors said on Thursday.

David Samson – a political mentor to New Jersey’s governor, Chris Christie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chris-christie> – pleaded guilty to a 
corruption charge that he wrongfully used his Port Authority of New York and 
New Jersey post.

The ex-lobbyist, Jamie Fox, was charged with conspiracy to commit bribery. The 
Democrat went on to become Christie’s transportation commissioner after ending 
his lobbying work for United.

Samson and Fox “both should have known better. They both did know better,” US 
attorney Paul Fishman said. “It was an unacceptable abuse of public authority.”

Fishman also announced that United would pay a $2.25m fine for the role its 
officials played in the scheme.

More on Donald Trump’s selection of Indiana governor Mike Pence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence> as his running mate:

Pence. Photograph: John Sommers Ii/Reuters 
The decision seems to represent an attempt to unite the Republican party and 
bring political experience to the businessman’s campaign.

Trump has spent much of the last week in Indiana, grounded by an aircraft 
malfunction to his private jet, and whiled away the days by holding de facto 
auditions with three contenders: Pence, New Jersey governor Chris Christie and 
former House speaker Newt Gingrich.

The three who spoke with Trump in the last week gave speeches that doubled as 
dress rehearsals for the campaign trial, and Pence also met with Trump’s adult 
children Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr, who have assumed leading roles in their 
father’s campaign.

Pence would bring several qualities to the Trump campaign that Republicans 
have found lacking, not least of which experience in government. The 
57-year-old spent 12 years in Congress, including two years in a leadership 
role with the House Republican Conference. He was elected governor of Indiana 
in 2012, and gained a degree of national notoriety thanks to acontroversial 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/31/indiana-religious-anti-gay-law-governor-mike-pence>
, which he signed into law and then wanted revised, after many argued it would 
allow discrimination against LGBT people.

A Trump-Pence ticket could send a message to Republican dissenters who feel 
they cannot support a candidate who has proven inconsistent onguns

 and other social conservative issues. Just before the Indiana primary 
election, the staunchly conservative governor endorsed Ted Cruz, Trump’s 
leading opponent and a far-right senator from Texas.

Pence does not come without baggage to a general election, however, where tens 
of millions more people vote than in the primaries. He isnot very popular

in his home state, nor well known outside it, and though his conservative bona

particularly suburban women.

Grassroots conservatives alleged that the Republican National Committee pulled 
out from a deal to reform RNC rules at the last minute as a potential “floor 
fight” – a contested vote on the floor – looms over next week’s Republican 
national convention.

Former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli, the leader of a bloc of 
social conservative activists, told reporters on Thursday night that he 
expected multiple minority reports to proposed rules of the Republican party. 
Any minority report, which requires the signatures of one quarter of the rules 
committee, would automatically be debated and voted upon on the floor of the 
convention.

Cuccinelli, who previously led the delegate-counting efforts for Ted Cruz’s 
presidential campaign before the Texas senator dropped out, said “sincere 
efforts were made by RNC and Trump people and coalition of grassroots 
conservatives to come to agreement to make the party run better for the 
grassroots”. However, Cuccinelli added: “This morning after a deal had been 
tentatively reached the RNC pulled out of it.” The 2013 Republican nominee for 
governor of Virginia insisted that he had only decided to speak to reporters 
about it in order to correct what he described as inaccurate reporting on the 
subject.

The prominent conservative activist said that negotiations fell apart on the 
issue of “bonus delegates” for states that held closed presidential primaries, 
open only to registeredRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans>. He said that his alliance of 
activists and the RNC failed to agree on a mathematical formula in back and 
forth negotiations.

Cuccinelli said the negotiations involved his conservatives conceding a number 
of points including any changes to RNC governance, such as a ban on registered 
lobbyists serving on the RNC.

Sean Spicer, the chief strategist for the RNC, disputed Cuccinelli’s version. 
He noted, “negotiating isn’t giving in to what everyone wants. There’s a bigger 
package in play and the RNC wanted to ensure all the sides were represented.” 
The top GOP operative added that the RNC represented GOP activists from across 
the country who had elected its members.

Cleveland <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cleveland> officials have 
expressed concern about the Ohio “open carry” state laws that will allow people 
to take guns to events organized close to the Republican party convention – but 
have not given assurances of how they will police the use of guns and banned 
objects in crowded areas, where the atmosphere is likely to be highly charged.

assets. Photograph: Michael Mathes/AFP/Getty Images 
Guns will not be allowed into the convention itself, which is being held 
inside the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland and policed by the secret service, 
or inside a tight perimeter immediately surrounding the venue.

But in a broad space outside those inner security rings, near the arena, in a 
large area loosely known as the event zone, guns will be allowed in an 
open-carry situation and, with a valid permit, to be carried while concealed.

While guns will be allowed in that zone, toy guns are banned. The city has 
declared a long list of other items that are prohibited from being taken into 
the event zone during the convention, which begins on Monday with the GOP 
readying itself to anointDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as its nominee for the White 
House.

Prohibited items range from glass bottles to lengths of rope and knives, and 
from tennis balls to lasers, gas masks, sledgehammers and drones, according to 
a list issued by the Cleveland authorities. Umbrellas with sharp tips are 
banned. So are pellet guns. But ordinary guns and bullets must be permitted if 
legally toted, because of anOhio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ohio> law 
that carrying a firearm is not prohibited.

No state license is required to possess a rifle, shotgun or handgun in Ohio, 
according to the National Rifle Association.

speaker at the upcoming Republican National Convention, despite confirmation 
that he was set to speak at the RNC from senior advisers to theDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> campaign this morning:

“Just got back from the Philippines and I wake up this morning to find out 
that I’m speaking at the Republican National Convention!” Tebow, who became 
famous as much for his devout Christianity as for his short career as the 
quarterback for the long-suffering Denver Broncos. “It’s amazing how fast 
rumors fly, and that’s exactly what it is - a rumor.”

“My goal has always been to be able to make a difference in the biggest way 
possible,” Tebow continued. “And if one day that’s in the political realm, then 
that’s what I’ll do. But right now I really believe that’s through my 
foundation... but I love our country and I’ll do anything for America.”

The remarks, which sound scripted, come on the heels of speculation that the 
RNC is currently begging for funds to cover a $6 million budget shortfall.

The organizers of the imminent Republican National Convention have penned an 
earnest letter to casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson in the hopes of getting 
Adelson to cover a $6 million shortfall in covering next week’s events,
according to Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/rnc-begs-adelson-for-6-million-to-cover-convention-shortfall-225571>
.

Naming more than two dozen wealthy backers and companies that have bowed out 
of donating more than $8.1 million in pledged funds to cover the convention, 
the Cleveland 2016 host committee cited “negative publicity” aroundDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as the reason for the 
shortfall.

“Over the past couple months, negative publicity around our potential nominee 
resulted in a considerable number of pledges backing out from their 
commitments,” the letter said. Included among the people and groups that have 
reneged on their donations: David Koch, Coca-Cola, FedEx, Pepsi and Visa.

“We would greatly appreciate if you would consider a $6,000,000 contribution 
to the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee to help us cross the finish line,” the 
letter continues. “Your support will allow our community to meet its obligation 
to the RNC, and will ensure our Republican nominee has the best possible 
platform to lay out his conservative case for our nation. Thank you for your 
consideration and please let us know if you need any additional information.”

The letter is dated July 12, six days before the beginning of the convention.
 
In response to a question asked by Diamond Reynolds, the girlfriend of 
Philando Castile, the 32-year-old fatally shot by Minnesota police last week, 
President Barack Obama said that the duty to reduce violence between police 
officers and suspects is on both law enforcement and minority communities.

“My heart goes out to all the families who have been involved, and I can only 
imagine what you’re going through,” Obama said. “I think that the place to 
start is for everybody to recognize that we need police officers and we need 
those police officers to be embraced by the community. If there are good 
relations between police and those communities, then those communities will be 
safer and police are going to be safer.”

“The more police departments know communities… the more trust is built,” Obama 
continued. “Police departments that are doing the best work are also training 
their officers not just on shooting… not just on the technical aspects of 
police work, but they’re also training those officers on… how we get rid of 
those implicit biases.”

“I think if we’re honest with ourselves, because of the history of our country 
and because of the images we receive as we’re growing up,” Obama continued, 
“oftentimes there’s a presumption that black men are dangerous.”

“It can’t just be all on the police, it’s also got to be on the community, 
it’s got to be on civic leaders, it’s got to be on churches and it’s got to be 
on us.”
 
President Obama issues statement on events in Nice, France:

On behalf of the American people, I condemn in the strongest terms what 
appears to be a horrific terrorist attack in Nice, France, which killed and 
wounded dozens of innocent civilians. Our thought and prayers are with the 
families and other loved ones of those killed, and we wish a full recovery for 
the many wounded. I have directed my team to be in touch with French officials, 
and we have offered any assistance that they may need to investigate this 
attack and bring those responsible to justice. We stand in solidarity and 
partnership with France, our oldest ally, as they respond to and recover from 
this attack.

On this Bastille Day, we are reminded of the extraordinary resilience and 
democratic values that have made France an inspiration to the entire world, and 
we know that the character of the French Republic will endure long after this 
devastating and tragic loss of life.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has postponed 
an event in which he was expected to unveil Mike Pence as his vice-presidential 
candidate after the tragedy in Nice, France, in which more than 60 people were 
killed.

A Republican source had told the Guardian that the Republican frontrunner had

Pence would represent a safe choice who would solidify the Republican base and 
is popular with social conservatives.

In order to choose Pence, Trump had to make a decision by noon on Friday, the 
deadline for the Indiana governor to drop his bid for re-election. Indiana law 
prevents a candidate for seeking election to multiple offices.

Trump had announced that he will officially unveil his vice-presidential 
choice at 11am on Friday in New York buttweeted Thursday night

As Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump inch closer to choosing their running mates
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/14/vice-president-picks-trump-clinton-conventions-running-mate>
 ahead of their respective party conventions, the two unshowy figures are 
facing great scrutiny.

Reynolds/EPA 
Tim Kaine, a senator and former governor of Virginia, took the stage with 
Clinton in his home state on Thursday armed with one-liners that sought to 
frame the choice before the American electorate this November.

“Do you want a ‘You’re fired’ president or a ‘You’re hired’ president?” Kaine 
said, invoking Trump’s infamous slogan from The Apprentice.

“Do you want a trash-talker president or a bridge-builder president? Do you 
want a me-first president or a kids-and-families-first president?”

The critiques, made before a packed gymnasium at the Northern Virginia 
Community College, rolled off his tongue as more of a mild-mannered 
disagreement than a scathing takedown.

But Kaine, a centrist Democrat who is well-liked by colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle, wasn’t looking to put on a performance. If chosen by Clinton, 
would instead reinforce her premise of that the Democratic ticket will be one 
of experience and competency over bluster and bravado.

The joint appearance came hours after Trump’s campaign signaled its own 
intention to announce Mike Pence as its vice-presidential pick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/14/donald-trump-picks-mike-pence-running-mate-vice-president>
 – although Trump aides tried to sow doubts ahead of a planned Friday morning 
unveiling.

Pence, like Kaine, is broadly respected by elected officials within his party 
and similarly known for his polite disposition. And as the governor of Indiana 
and a staunch conservative, he is regarded as one of the few options before 
Trump who could bring a sense of legitimacy to a candidacy yet to persuade a 
large swath of skeptical Republicans.

Donald Trump has issued a statement, via Twitter, regarding the possible 
terrorist attack

Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. 
When will we learn? It is only getting worse.

The former chairman of the agency that controls New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> City-area airports conspired 
with a United Airlines lobbyist to get the airline to run direct flights to 
South Carolina so that the executive could more easily visit his vacation home, 
prosecutors said on Thursday.

David Samson – a political mentor to New Jersey’s governor, Chris Christie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chris-christie> – pleaded guilty to a 
corruption charge that he wrongfully used his Port Authority of New York and 
New Jersey post.

The ex-lobbyist, Jamie Fox, was charged with conspiracy to commit bribery. The 
Democrat went on to become Christie’s transportation commissioner after ending 
his lobbying work for United.

Samson and Fox “both should have known better. They both did know better,” US 
attorney Paul Fishman said. “It was an unacceptable abuse of public authority.”

Fishman also announced that United would pay a $2.25m fine for the role its 
officials played in the scheme.

More on Donald Trump’s selection of Indiana governor Mike Pence

The decision seems to represent an attempt to unite the Republican party and 
bring political experience to the businessman’s campaign.

Trump has spent much of the last week in Indiana, grounded by an aircraft 
malfunction to his private jet, and whiled away the days by holding de facto 
auditions with three contenders: Pence, New Jersey governor Chris Christie and 
former House speaker Newt Gingrich.

The three who spoke with Trump in the last week gave speeches that doubled as 
dress rehearsals for the campaign trial, and Pence also met with Trump’s adult 
children Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr, who have assumed leading roles in their 
father’s campaign.

Pence would bring several qualities to the Trump campaign that Republicans 
have found lacking, not least of which experience in government. The 
57-year-old spent 12 years in Congress, including two years in a leadership 
role with the House Republican Conference. He was elected governor of Indiana 
in 2012, and gained a degree of national notoriety thanks to acontroversial 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/31/indiana-religious-anti-gay-law-governor-mike-pence>
, which he signed into law and then wanted revised, after many argued it would 
allow discrimination against LGBT people.

A Trump-Pence ticket could send a message to Republican dissenters who feel 
they cannot support a candidate who has proven inconsistent onguns

 and other social conservative issues. Just before the Indiana primary 
election, the staunchly conservative governor endorsed Ted Cruz, Trump’s 
leading opponent and a far-right senator from Texas.

Pence does not come without baggage to a general election, however, where tens 
of millions more people vote than in the primaries. He isnot very popular 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-mike-pence-vice-president-225387> 
in his home state, nor well known outside it, and though his conservative bona 
fides will help unite the party they may push away important swing voters, 
particularly suburban women.
