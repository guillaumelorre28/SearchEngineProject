Dearest Billy, I have a feeling you’re going to be a bit confused when you 
read thisafter seeing the film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/bridget-joness-baby-review-reborn-renee-zellweger-excels-in-fun-romp-heavy-with-expectation>
, as on screen your two possible Dads were Mark Darcy and some other American 
bloke (whose name I can’t remember because I got a bit pissed and slept through 
it), while in this book your two possible dads are Mark Darcy and Daniel 
Cleaver. Well, the thing is, Hugh Grant got a bit sniffy about appearing in 
another film and, by the time I remembered, I had already written 
three-quarters of the book in the course of a drunken weekend. Anyway, as you 
will already know from the last book that Mark actually died three years ago, 
you’re probably not going to be too bothered.Sorry about all this and 
everything, but the money they were offering was irresistible.Love Mum

24 June 10.02am Look out the window and there are literally hundreds of 
pregnant women wandering around. Why am I the only childless person in the 
world? 10.03am Just remembered I am supposed to be godmother to Magda’s 17th 
child today. 1.07pm Car broke down on way to christening. Am going to be 
hideously late. 2.45pm Mark Darcy arrives by helicopter. No one told me he was 
also going to be a godparent. Totes embarrassed but trying to be a grown up. 
Even though I am still writing like a teenager.

Five years earlier 
Soz everyone. Just remembered that not everyone will remember who Mark is. 
Anyway we were having this engagement party when Daniel Cleaver turned up and 
lifted up my skirt to look at my big pants. This probably doesn’t sound that 
funny but trust me on screen everyone would be laughing. Anyway Mark threw a 
wobbly and called off the wedding.


Back to Now! 
The next day or thereabouts 11.54pm OMG. Never thought I’d have sex again but 
Mark and I are shagging like rabbits. 11.55pm Mark has done a runner. Says it’s 
too soon after the divorce.


The day after Back to work at TV station where I do something for Britain Sits 
Up though can’t quite remember what as am still endearingly scatty. Text from 
Daniel: Hi Jones, Would you like to come to book awards tonight? PS I am now 
rewriting Time’s Arrow only with time going forward. This is best gag in book 
and will have Julian Barnes rolling with laughter at the ceremony. 3.25am 
Whoops. I seem to have also just shagged Daniel as well. Blokes are sometimes 
like buses.

4 September Calories 12,894. Sorry, had to put that in for old times’ sake.

8 September 7.01pm Have just realised I am pregnant and I don’t know who the 
dad is. What a bummer. Text Mark. I think I may be having your baby. Text 
Daniel. I think I may be having your baby. 7.02pm. Both text back to say WTF?

9 October 10am Time for scan and both Mark and Daniel turn up. Very funny 
scene when gynaecologist thinks I am surrogate and Mark and Daniel are a gay 
couple. Come to think of it, this probably works better as a scene in the 
screenplay.

November Both Mark and Daniel aren’t talking to me because they are both 
having a mid-life crisis. I am all alone and am going to be a single mother.

13 December 7.03am Maybe Mark and Daniel aren’t having a mid-life after all. 
Sorry I am making this up as fast as I can type and haven’t really thought it 
through. 7.04am More of the same. 7.05am Yet more of the same. 7.06am Still yet 
more of the same.

January Resign from my job. Hooray! Who wants to work?

15 February I seem to have come over all ditzier than usual. Audiences will 
love this. Have put on my big pants back to front!

12 March 11.47am Mummy is having a tizzy about me being an unmarried mum and 
says I can’t come to the village fete which the Queen will be opening later as 
it would embarrass Her Maj. Publisher thrilled I have managed to get a member 
of the royal family into book. Thinks American audiences will love it.

23 March 5.56am Your birthday! Big confusion. First Mark wasn’t going to turn 
up then he did and then Daniel wasn’t going to turn up and then he did and then 
you were almost born in the car but luckily everything ended up all right and 
here you are. 5.57am Mark: “Can I marry you?” Daniel: “Can I fuck you, Jones?” 
ROFL 7.36am That’s about it. Hope you like it, Billy. But even if you don’t, 
you’ll love the royalties.

Digested read, digested: Bridget Jones’s baby boom.
