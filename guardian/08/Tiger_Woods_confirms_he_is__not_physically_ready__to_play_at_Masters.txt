 The former world No1 has been sidelined from competition since August as he 
continues his recovery from back surgeries, and was racing to regain fitness 
for the tournament at Augusta National next weekend, April 7-10.

 “After assessing the present condition of my back, and consulting with my 
medical team, I’ve decided it’s prudent to miss this year’s Masters,” Woods 
said in a statement on his website.

 “I’ve been hitting balls and training daily, but I’m not physically ready. 
I’ve said all along that this time I need to be cautious and do what’s best for 
my long-term health and career.

 “Unfortunately, playing Augusta next week wouldn’t be the right decision,” 
said Woods, a four-times Masters champion.

There has been constant speculation on the tour about Woods’ playing future
