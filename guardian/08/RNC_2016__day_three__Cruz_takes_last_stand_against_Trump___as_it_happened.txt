The third day of the Republican national convention is over and done. Here’s a 
summary of what happened:

 * Ted Cruz did not endorse Donald Trump in a speech to the convention, and he 
was lustily booed by a crowd that had cheered much of his speech to that point. 
 * “Please, don’t stay home in November,” Cruz said. “Stand, and speak, and 
vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust 
to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.” Then he stood 
and waved to thousands booing.

 * Newt Gingrich came out after Cruz and said the crowd has misunderstood, 
that what Cruz said was in effect an endorsement of Trump because Trump was the 
only candidate faithful to the Constitution, see? 
 * A sense of deteriorating order in the arena was expanded by the flickering 
malfunctions of the Q’s jumbotrons as Eric Trump attempted to follow Cruz. 
 * Vice presidential nominee Mike Pence won an enthusiastic, if not quite 
rapturous, reception for a smooth speech that framed the election efficiently 
thus: “It’s change versus status quo.”

 * After Pence’s speech, the last of the evening and on the late side of 
things,Donald Trump came onstage to very strong cheering. And mis-kissed his 
running mate: 
 * The big finale begins tomorrow just after 7pm ET, with Donald Trump, 
preceded by daughter Ivanka. 
 * Early in the night, conservative radio host Laura Ingraham threatened to 
steal the show with attacks on Hillary Clinton and the media and a call on Cruz 
(not by name

) to endorse Trump. 
 * Marco Rubio addressed the crowd by video before the Jumbotrons went out and 
said it was time to unify the party and get behind the nominee. His pixels were 
cheered. 
 * A Trump staffer released a statement inviting blame for the inclusion in 
Melania Trump’s speech Monday of Michelle Obama’s words. Trump said “we all 
make mistakes” and declined to accept her resignation. 
 * The secret service was investigating a Trump aide who said Hillary Clinton 
should be shot for treason. The Trump campaign said the aide did not speak for 
their candidate. 
 * Cleveland officials said a flag burning that turned into a melee resulted 
in the arrest of 18 people, bringing total RNC-related arrests to 23. 
 * A woman at the centre of sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump has
 spoken for the first time

Trump forgives campaign loan as promised

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has made good 
on his promise to forgive more than $47 million in loans he made to his 
campaign during the primary season, reports the AP:

New federal campaign finance reports show the GOP presidential nominee no 
longer is carrying a balance on his loans.

That’s as he raised $21.9 million in contributions, leaving Trump with $20.2 
million in the bank.

Trump’s haul came after a disappointing May, when his campaign finished with 
$1.3 million.

The latest figures show the Republican Party had $21.1 million cash on hand by 
July 1.

The third day of the Republican national convention is over and done. Here’s a 
summary of what happened:

 * Ted Cruz did not endorse Donald Trump in a speech to the convention, and he 
was lustily booed by a crowd that had cheered much of his speech to that point. 
 * “Please, don’t stay home in November,” Cruz said. “Stand, and speak, and 
vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust 
to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.” Then he stood 
and waved to thousands booing.

 * Newt Gingrich came out after Cruz and said the crowd has misunderstood, 
that what Cruz said was in effect an endorsement of Trump because Trump was the 
only candidate faithful to the Constitution, see? 
 * A sense of deteriorating order in the arena was expanded by the flickering 
malfunctions of the Q’s jumbotrons as Eric Trump attempted to follow Cruz. 
 * Vice presidential nominee Mike Pence won an enthusiastic, if not quite 
rapturous, reception for a smooth speech that framed the election efficiently 
thus: “It’s change versus status quo.”

 * After Pence’s speech, the last of the evening and on the late side of 
things,Donald Trump came onstage to very strong cheering. And mis-kissed his 
running mate: 
 * The big finale begins tomorrow just after 7pm ET, with Donald Trump, 
preceded by daughter Ivanka. 
 * Early in the night, conservative radio host Laura Ingraham threatened to 
steal the show with attacks on Hillary Clinton and the media and a call on Cruz 
(not by name 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jul/20/republican-national-convention-day-three-live?page=with:block-5790208fe4b09ac5ee0eece2#block-5790208fe4b09ac5ee0eece2>
) to endorse Trump. 
 * Marco Rubio addressed the crowd by video before the Jumbotrons went out and 
said it was time to unify the party and get behind the nominee. His pixels were 
cheered. 
 * A Trump staffer released a statement inviting blame for the inclusion in 
Melania Trump’s speech Monday of Michelle Obama’s words. Trump said “we all 
make mistakes” and declined to accept her resignation. 
 * The secret service was investigating a Trump aide who said Hillary Clinton 
should be shot for treason. The Trump campaign said the aide did not speak for 
their candidate. 
 * Cleveland officials said a flag burning that turned into a melee resulted 
in the arrest of 18 people, bringing total RNC-related arrests to 23. 
 * A woman at the centre of sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump has
 spoken for the first time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview>
 in detail about her personal experience with the billionaire tycoon who this 
week became the Republican nominee for president.  
Google’s data confirms what everyone in the arena felt: Boos for Cruz was the 
night’s big moment.

Via Google:

 * +1100% spike in searches for Ted Cruz, compared to +450% spike for Mike 
Pence 
 * Top question for Ted Cruz: “Why were people booing Ted Cruz?” and “Why 
didn’t Cruz endorse Trump?” 
 * +560% spike in searches for “booing” 
 * +800% spike for “vote your conscience” 
 * Top states searching for “Ted Cruz booing” - North Dakota, Montana, 
Tennessee, Arkansas, South Carolina  
This from a man who delivered the keynote address at the 2012 convention and 
basically ignored the nominee:

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has made good 
on his promise to forgive more than $47 million in loans he made to his 
campaign during the primary season, reports the AP:

New federal campaign finance reports show the GOP presidential nominee no 
longer is carrying a balance on his loans.

That’s as he raised $21.9 million in contributions, leaving Trump with $20.2 
million in the bank.

Trump’s haul came after a disappointing May, when his campaign finished with 
$1.3 million.

The latest figures show the Republican Party had $21.1 million cash on hand by 
July 1.
 
The motion to adjourn is heard and is adopted. Meet back here at 7.10pm 
tomorrow.

I think we have our answer on the music. The band digs into its most ambitious 
cover yet. Like Rush-ambitious:
