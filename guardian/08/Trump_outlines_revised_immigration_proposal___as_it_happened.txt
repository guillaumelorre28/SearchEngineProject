Trump now calls for equal treatment for all Americans:

As your president, I will be your single greatest champion. I will fight to 
ensure that every single American is treated equal.. we will reject hatred and 
bigotry... as one American people.

That’s the end, he says thank you, the crowd chants Trump.

Trump proposes a commission on radical Islam to included “reformist voices in 
the Islam community who will hopefully work with us.”

He says the commission will develop protocols for police, federal 
investigators and immigration screeners. He calls for a round of applause for 
law enforcement. Great cheering, then a Trump! Trump! Trump! chant.

“We will also keep open Guantánamo Bay and place a new emphasis on human 
intelligence,” he says. “Foreign combatants will be tried in military 
commissions.”

Trump describes 'extreme vetting'

Now Trump describes his plan for a new fortress America:

I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme, extreme vetting. Our country has 
enough problems. We don’t need more.

On Trump’s list of people to be excluded

– sympathizers of terrorist groups

– those who do not believe in our constitution

– those who believe in bigotry or hatred

– those who believe shariah law should supplant US law

– those not expected to “flourish in our country” 

– those who would not embrace American ideals

To put these new procedures in place, Trump explains, we will have to suspend 
immigration from countries “that have a history of exporting terrorism.”

The state department would ID regions where “adequate screenings cannot take 
place.” “There are many such regions,” Trump says.

Note: this post has been updated to correct an item on the list of types 
Trump’s extreme vetting would screen for. The correct entry is “those who 
believe shariah law should supplant US law” not merely “those who support 
shariah law.”

Trump: 'we will work closely with Nato' to fight terror.

Trump says he told everyone “keep the oil, keep the oil, keep the oil” after 
the invasion of Iraq. He wanted to use oil revenues – Iraqi oil revenues – to 
heal wounded veterans, he said.

“In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils. 
Instead, all we got from Iraq and our adventures in the Middle East was death 
destruction and tremendous financial loss.” Troops could have been stationed at 
oil fields and stabilized the country, he says.

Then he says that national building would end under his presidency.

Just to be clear: Trump opposes "nation-building," but supports using US 
troops for coerced natural resource extraction.

He wants an international conference with allies in the Middle East including 
Israel and Jordan and Egypt, and “all others who recognize this ideology of 
death.”

“We will also work closely with Nato,” Trump says. “I had previously said that 
Nato was obsolete... since my comments they have changed their policy and now 
have a new division focused on terrorism.”

Technically true, although the implied cause-and-effect isn’t.

Trump turns to hit Clinton and Obama for “the reckless way in which they 
pulled out” of Iraq. “We should never have made such a sudden withdrawal on a 
time table advertised to our enemies.”

“Who would do this but an incompetent president?” Then he skips back to Libya, 
then to Syria and Egypt.

Trump:

“It is now time for a new approach,” against “our current strategy of nation 
building and regime change.”

Trump repeats the lie that he was an opponent of the Iraq war from the 
beginning; asked by Howard Stern in September 2002 whether he favored the 
invasion of Iraq,Trump said, “Yeah I guess so.

Trump, s-l-o-w-l-y:

It all began in 2009 with what has become known as President... Obama’s... 
American... apology... tour...

Boos.

Trump goes on to hit Obama for his 2009 Cairo speech. He says Obama lacked 
moral courage and “tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights and 
theirs.”

“The failure to establish a new status of forces agreement in Iraq” and the 
scheduling of an Iraqi parliamentary election on an American political 
timetable “surrendered our gains in that country,” Trump says.

“Hillary Clinton’s policies launched Isis onto the world stage,” he says. He 
says she “threw the Middle East into turmoil.”

He says the Clintons made almost $60m when she was secretary of state. He says 
she lacks the judgment, stability, temperament and moral character to lead the 
USA.

Trump lists terror attacks

“Today we begin a conversation about how to make America safe again,” Trump 
says.

He begins with a list of terror attacks going back to the 2013 Boston marathon 
bombing. When he gets to the shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando he falters 
in pronouncing LGBTQ. “LG....B..T.....Q” he says.

Trump includes attacks abroad.

“France is suffering gravely, and the tourism industry is being massively 
affected,” he says. He mentions the Brussels attacks, the Nice attack, the 
Charlie Hebdo attack, and the 26 July Normandy church attack, which he says 
happened “a couple of days ago.”

Giuliani, apparently forgetting where he was, refers to what Trump did “in the 
state of Indiana.”

He attempts a recovery:

“’Scuse me. We’re going there next. We’re going there next. Youngstown Ohio. I 
love Youngstown Ohio!”

Giuliani is cracking the crowd up a bit.

“She has destroyed more emails than I have ever written, but of course I don’t 
do yoga,” he says. Some of Clinton’s emails published by the state department 
were about yoga.

“Enough about her, because we’re not going to have to think about her after 
November goes past,” Giuliani says.

“Donald Trump has the intellect, the stamina and the strength to confront our 
enemies. No one doubts that,” Giuliani says. “And he has the temperament to 
win.”

“She’s running on her experience,” he says of Clinton, and chuckles audibly. 
“If I were her, I’d be running away from my experience!”

Trump now calls for equal treatment for all Americans:

As your president, I will be your single greatest champion. I will fight to 
ensure that every single American is treated equal.. we will reject hatred and 
bigotry... as one American people.

That’s the end, he says thank you, the crowd chants Trump.
 
“Similar to the effort to take down the mafia, this will be the understood 
mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in this country,” Trump 
describes the job of expunging homegrown jihadism.
 
Trump proposes a commission on radical Islam to included “reformist voices in 
the Islam community who will hopefully work with us.”

He says the commission will develop protocols for police, federal 
investigators and immigration screeners. He calls for a round of applause for 
law enforcement. Great cheering, then a Trump! Trump! Trump! chant.

“We will also keep open Guantánamo Bay and place a new emphasis on human 
intelligence,” he says. “Foreign combatants will be tried in military 
commissions.”
 
Trump:

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> wants to 
be America’s Angela Merkel. And you know what a disaster immigration has been 
to the people of Germany... it is a catastrophe.

We have enough problems in our country. We don’t need more.
 
Now Trump describes his plan for a new fortress America:

I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme, extreme vetting. Our country has 
enough problems. We don’t need more.

On Trump’s list of people to be excluded

– sympathizers of terrorist groups

– those who do not believe in our constitution

– those who believe in bigotry or hatred

– those who believe shariah law should supplant US law

– those not expected to “flourish in our country” 

– those who would not embrace American ideals

To put these new procedures in place, Trump explains, we will have to suspend 
immigration from countries “that have a history of exporting terrorism.”

The state department would ID regions where “adequate screenings cannot take 
place.” “There are many such regions,” Trump says.

Note: this post has been updated to correct an item on the list of types 
Trump’s extreme vetting would screen for. The correct entry is “those who 
believe shariah law should supplant US law” not merely “those who support 
shariah law.”
 
Trump says he told everyone “keep the oil, keep the oil, keep the oil” after 
the invasion of Iraq. He wanted to use oil revenues – Iraqi oil revenues – to 
heal wounded veterans, he said.

“In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils. 
Instead, all we got from Iraq and our adventures in the Middle East was death 
destruction and tremendous financial loss.” Troops could have been stationed at 
oil fields and stabilized the country, he says.

Then he says that national building would end under his presidency.

Just to be clear: Trump opposes "nation-building," but supports using US 
troops for coerced natural resource extraction.

"The era of nation building will be brought to a swift and decisive end"

He wants an international conference with allies in the Middle East including 
Israel and Jordan and Egypt, and “all others who recognize this ideology of 
death.”

“We will also work closely with Nato,” Trump says. “I had previously said that 
Nato was obsolete... since my comments they have changed their policy and now 
have a new division focused on terrorism.”

Technically true, although the implied cause-and-effect isn’t.
 
Trump turns to hit Clinton and Obama for “the reckless way in which they 
pulled out” of Iraq. “We should never have made such a sudden withdrawal on a 
time table advertised to our enemies.”

“Who would do this but an incompetent president?” Then he skips back to Libya, 
then to Syria and Egypt.
 
Trump:

“It is now time for a new approach,” against “our current strategy of nation 
building and regime change.”

Trump repeats the lie that he was an opponent of the Iraq war from the 
beginning; asked by Howard Stern in September 2002 whether he favored the 
invasion of Iraq,Trump said, “Yeah I guess so.

”
 
Trump, s-l-o-w-l-y:

It all began in 2009 with what has become known as President... Obama’s... 
American... apology... tour...

Boos.

Trump goes on to hit Obama for his 2009 Cairo speech. He says Obama lacked 
moral courage and “tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights and 
theirs.”

“The failure to establish a new status of forces agreement in Iraq” and the 
scheduling of an Iraqi parliamentary election on an American political 
timetable “surrendered our gains in that country,” Trump says.

“Hillary Clinton’s policies launched Isis onto the world stage,” he says. He 
says she “threw the Middle East into turmoil.”

He says the Clintons made almost $60m when she was secretary of state. He says 
she lacks the judgment, stability, temperament and moral character to lead the 
USA.
 
“We cannot let this evil continue,” Trump says. The line draws applause.

“Thank you,” he says. “Thank you.”

“Today we begin a conversation about how to make America safe again,” Trump 
says.

He begins with a list of terror attacks going back to the 2013 Boston marathon 
bombing. When he gets to the shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando he falters 
in pronouncing LGBTQ. “LG....B..T.....Q” he says.

Trump includes attacks abroad.

“France is suffering gravely, and the tourism industry is being massively 
affected,” he says. He mentions the Brussels attacks, the Nice attack, the 
Charlie Hebdo attack, and the 26 July Normandy church attack, which he says 
happened “a couple of days ago.”
 
Trump running mate Mike Pence now introduces Trump:

You will hear today a broad-shouldered vision to confront our enemies, restore 
our security, and once again have America command the respect of the world.
 
Giuliani, apparently forgetting where he was, refers to what Trump did “in the 
state of Indiana.”

He attempts a recovery:

“’Scuse me. We’re going there next. We’re going there next. Youngstown Ohio. I 
love Youngstown Ohio!”
 
Giuliani is cracking the crowd up a bit.

“She has destroyed more emails than I have ever written, but of course I don’t 
do yoga,” he says. Some of Clinton’s emails published by the state department 
were about yoga.

“Enough about her, because we’re not going to have to think about her after 
November goes past,” Giuliani says.
 
“Donald Trump has the intellect, the stamina and the strength to confront our 
enemies. No one doubts that,” Giuliani says. “And he has the temperament to 
win.”

“She’s running on her experience,” he says of Clinton, and chuckles audibly. 
“If I were her, I’d be running away from my experience!”

The crowd likes the line.
 
Former NYC mayor Rudolph Giuliani appears to introduce Trump.

“Donald is our only hope for change in the way in which we approach radical 
Islamic terrorism,” he says.
 
Biden finishes to big applause. Meanwhile Trump is preparing to take the stage 
in Youngstown, Ohio. Here’s a live stream:
