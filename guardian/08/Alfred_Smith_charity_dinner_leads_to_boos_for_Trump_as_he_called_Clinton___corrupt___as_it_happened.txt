Today in Campaign 2016

To paraphrase Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, in under three weeks 
this will all be over. Feel better now?

Some of today’s key news:

 * Donald Trump was booed for calling Clinton ‘corrupt’ as the normally 
bipartisan Alfred E Smith Catholic fundrasing dinner turned sour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/trump-booed-for-calling-clinton-corrupt-as-bipartisan-dinner-turns-sour>
. Traditionally an opportunity for self-deprecating jabs, the dinner instead 
took on a snarlier tone, with the Republican candidate calling his rival 
corrupt and accusing her of “pretending not to hate Catholics”. 
 * Trump scored a hit, though, with a gag about his wife’s partly plagiarised 
speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-plagiarism-scandal-michelle-obama>
 during the Republican National Convention in July: 
 Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, it’s fantastic. My wife 
Melania gives the exact same speech and people get on her case. I don’t get it.


 * With a nod to his assertion during this week’s debate that Clinton was 
“such a nasty woman” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton>
, Trump shrugged: 
This stuff is all relative. After listening to Hillary rattle on and on and 
on, Idon’t think so badly of Rosie O’Donnell 
<http://www.vox.com/culture/2016/9/27/13072666/donald-trump-rosie-odonnell-feud-debate-explained>
 any more. In fact I’m actually starting to like Rosie a lot.

 * Clinton had some barbs of her own in a speech that was, however, more 
willing to poke fun at herself and her “rigorous nap schedule”. On Trump’s 
reluctance to reveal detailed health records, she mocked: 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> really is as 
healthy as a horse – you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.

 * And on the thorny issue of Trump’s attitude to women, Clinton remarked: 
Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four – maybe a five, if she 
loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.

Elsewhere

 * Trump’s national political director Jim Murphy is “stepping back” from the 
campaign, with less than three weeks to go until 8 November. “I have not 
resigned but for personal reasons have had to take a step back from the 
campaign,” Murphy said in astatement to Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-national-political-director-steps-back-from-campaign-230120#ixzz4NfKvqxnf>
. 
 * Trump says he will accept US election result “if I win” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-us-election-result>
. 
 * Jeff Bezos says Donald Trump’s behavior “erodes democracy” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/20/jeff-bezos-donald-trump-criticism-amazon-blue-origin>
. 
 * Trump loyalists plan own exit poll amid claims of ‘rigged’ election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/citizens-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-roger-stone-rigged-election-claim>
. 
 * And the Republican nominee was accused of sexual misconduct by a 10th woman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser>
.

An interesting observation from Associated Press:

First lady Michelle Obama has emerged as perhaps the most effective Donald 
Trump critic in the Democrats’ lineup, and she’s done it without ever uttering 
two key words:Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.


In her six campaign trail speeches for Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, the first lady has never 
said the Republican nominee’s name. She’s talked about “this candidate” and 
dedicated much of her time to a searing indictment of his words and positions.

But throughout her buzzworthy takedowns, Trump remains the man who shall 
remain nameless.

Bernie Sanders fans might be interested to learn that his brother, Larry 
Sanders, has scored a respectable fourth place in the Witney byelection in the 
UK.

The byelection was prompted by the resignation of David Cameron – remember 
him? – and the Oxfordshire seat was held by the Conservative party.

But fourth was a cheery enough result for Sanders and the Greens, who came 
fifth in last year’s general election in the constituency, and was enough for 
them to leapfrog the anti-EU Ukip.

It looks as if WikiLeaks didn’t enjoy the evening.

That “rigged” line sounds familiar, though.
WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) 
There is no US election. There is power consolidation. Rigged primary, rigged 
media and rigged 'pied piper' candidate drive consolidation.

If Donald Trump’s campaign has been defined by going where no candidate has 
gone before, on Thursday the real estate mogul added a new feather to his cap: 
being roundly booed at a Catholic charity dinner.

The Republican nominee encountered a chilly reception at the Alfred E. Smith 
dinner, an annual Catholic fundraiser in New York City, withHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> also in attendance. 
Presidential candidates have long graced the white-tie affair and roasted 
themselves while throwing in a few jabs at their opponents.

But after earning a few laughs, Trump’s remarks quickly devolved into a 
stinging indictment of Clinton that prompted jeers from the audience.

“Hillary believes it’s vital to deceive the people by having one public policy 
and a totally different policy in private,” Trump said, nodding to the emails 
of her campaign chairman John Podesta that were published by WikiLeaks.

“That’s OK,” Trump responded to the audible boos that followed. “I don’t know 
who they’re angry at, Hillary, you or I?”

“You!” a voice cried out from the crowd.

Trump pressed on, standing at a podium mere feet away from Cardinal Timothy 
Dolan, who served as the evening’s host: “For example, here she is tonight in 
public, pretending not to hate Catholics.”

Trump did bring the house down with a rejoinder poking fun at his wife’s 
dabble with plagiarism during the Republican National Convention in July.

“Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, it’s fantastic,” Trump 
said. “My wife Melania gives the exact same speech, and people get on her case. 
I don’t get it.”

But the barbs he subsequently threw at Clinton, delivered as though the venue 
was a Trump campaign rally, fell flat.

Clinton’s speech, albeit less bitter in its tone, was similarly crafted with a 
series of jokes not far removed from the attack lines she has employed against 
Trump on the stump.

The Democratic nominee needled her opponent over his admiration for Russia, 
remarking of Trump’s refusal to disclose his health records: “Donald Trump 
really is as healthy as a horse – you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around 
on.”

Of his inability to stick to teleprompters, Clinton quipped: “I’m sure it’s 
even harder when you’re translating from the original Russian.”

The former secretary of state also homed in on his behavior toward women. 
“Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four, maybe a five, if she 
loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.

“You know what would be a good number for a woman? 45,” she added, in 
reference to the number marking the next president’s place in US history.

Hillary Clinton, on history:

We’ll either have the first woman president, or the first president who’s 
started a Twitter war with Cher.

Hillary Clinton, on being prepared:

There is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>. Donald wanted me drug-tested 
before last night’s debate - and look, I gotta tell you that Donald thought I 
used some sort of performance-enhancer. Now, actually, I did - it’s called 
preparation.

Hillary Clinton, on the State of Liberty as an object of lust:

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> looks at the 
Statue of Liberty and sees a four. Maybe a five, if she loses the torch and 
tablet and changes her hair.

Hillary Clinton gets back at Donald Trump:

It’s amazing I’m up here after Donald - I didn’t think he’d be okay with a 
peaceful transition of power. And, Donald, after listening to your speech, I 
will also enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.

Speaking at the Alfred Smith memorial dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in New 
York City, former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nomineeHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> follows a deeply 
un-funny set by Donald Trump.

“I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here,” Clinton joked. 
“Usually I charge a lot for speeches like this, but for me, it was kind of 
ironic thinking about a fiery populist, Al Smith.”

“If he were here today and saw how much money we’ve raised for needy children, 
he’d be very proud. And if he saw this magnificent room full of plutocrats 
celebrating his legacy, he’d be very confused.”

To paraphrase Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, in under three weeks 
this will all be over. Feel better now?

Some of today’s key news:

 * Donald Trump was booed for calling Clinton ‘corrupt’ as the normally 
bipartisan Alfred E Smith Catholic fundrasing dinner turned sour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/trump-booed-for-calling-clinton-corrupt-as-bipartisan-dinner-turns-sour>
. Traditionally an opportunity for self-deprecating jabs, the dinner instead 
took on a snarlier tone, with the Republican candidate calling his rival 
corrupt and accusing her of “pretending not to hate Catholics”. 
 * Trump scored a hit, though, with a gag about his wife’s partly plagiarised 
speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-plagiarism-scandal-michelle-obama>
 during the Republican National Convention in July: 
 Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, it’s fantastic. My wife 
Melania gives the exact same speech and people get on her case. I don’t get it.


 * With a nod to his assertion during this week’s debate that Clinton was 
“such a nasty woman” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton>
, Trump shrugged: 
This stuff is all relative. After listening to Hillary rattle on and on and 
on, Idon’t think so badly of Rosie O’Donnell 
<http://www.vox.com/culture/2016/9/27/13072666/donald-trump-rosie-odonnell-feud-debate-explained>
 any more. In fact I’m actually starting to like Rosie a lot.

 * Clinton had some barbs of her own in a speech that was, however, more 
willing to poke fun at herself and her “rigorous nap schedule”. On Trump’s 
reluctance to reveal detailed health records, she mocked: 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> really is as 
healthy as a horse – you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.

 * And on the thorny issue of Trump’s attitude to women, Clinton remarked: 
Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four – maybe a five, if she 
loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.

Elsewhere

 * Trump’s national political director Jim Murphy is “stepping back” from the 
campaign, with less than three weeks to go until 8 November. “I have not 
resigned but for personal reasons have had to take a step back from the 
campaign,” Murphy said in astatement to Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-national-political-director-steps-back-from-campaign-230120#ixzz4NfKvqxnf>
. 
 * Trump says he will accept US election result “if I win” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-us-election-result>
. 
 * Jeff Bezos says Donald Trump’s behavior “erodes democracy” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/20/jeff-bezos-donald-trump-criticism-amazon-blue-origin>

An interesting observation from Associated Press:

First lady Michelle Obama has emerged as perhaps the most effective Donald 
Trump critic in the Democrats’ lineup, and she’s done it without ever uttering 
two key words:Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.


In her six campaign trail speeches for Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, the first lady has never 
said the Republican nominee’s name. She’s talked about “this candidate” and 
dedicated much of her time to a searing indictment of his words and positions.

But throughout her buzzworthy takedowns, Trump remains the man who shall 
remain nameless.

Bernie Sanders fans might be interested to learn that his brother, Larry 
Sanders, has scored a respectable fourth place in the Witney byelection in the 
UK.

The byelection was prompted by the resignation of David Cameron – remember 
him? – and the Oxfordshire seat was held by the Conservative party.

But fourth was a cheery enough result for Sanders and the Greens, who came 
fifth in last year’s general election in the constituency, and was enough for 
them to leapfrog the anti-EU Ukip.

It looks as if WikiLeaks didn’t enjoy the evening.

That “rigged” line sounds familiar, though.
WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) 
There is no US election. There is power consolidation. Rigged primary, rigged 
media and rigged 'pied piper' candidate drive consolidation.

If Donald Trump’s campaign has been defined by going where no candidate has 
gone before, on Thursday the real estate mogul added a new feather to his cap: 
being roundly booed at a Catholic charity dinner.

The Republican nominee encountered a chilly reception at the Alfred E. Smith 
dinner, an annual Catholic fundraiser in New York City, withHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> also in attendance. 
Presidential candidates have long graced the white-tie affair and roasted 
themselves while throwing in a few jabs at their opponents.

But after earning a few laughs, Trump’s remarks quickly devolved into a 
stinging indictment of Clinton that prompted jeers from the audience.

“Hillary believes it’s vital to deceive the people by having one public policy 
and a totally different policy in private,” Trump said, nodding to the emails 
of her campaign chairman John Podesta that were published by WikiLeaks.

“That’s OK,” Trump responded to the audible boos that followed. “I don’t know 
who they’re angry at, Hillary, you or I?”

“You!” a voice cried out from the crowd.

Trump pressed on, standing at a podium mere feet away from Cardinal Timothy 
Dolan, who served as the evening’s host: “For example, here she is tonight in 
public, pretending not to hate Catholics.”

Trump did bring the house down with a rejoinder poking fun at his wife’s 
dabble with plagiarism during the Republican National Convention in July.

“Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, it’s fantastic,” Trump 
said. “My wife Melania gives the exact same speech, and people get on her case. 
I don’t get it.”

But the barbs he subsequently threw at Clinton, delivered as though the venue 
was a Trump campaign rally, fell flat.

Clinton’s speech, albeit less bitter in its tone, was similarly crafted with a 
series of jokes not far removed from the attack lines she has employed against 
Trump on the stump.

The Democratic nominee needled her opponent over his admiration for Russia, 
remarking of Trump’s refusal to disclose his health records: “Donald Trump 
really is as healthy as a horse – you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around 
on.”

Of his inability to stick to teleprompters, Clinton quipped: “I’m sure it’s 
even harder when you’re translating from the original Russian.”

The former secretary of state also homed in on his behavior toward women. 
“Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four, maybe a five, if she 
loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.

“You know what would be a good number for a woman? 45,” she added, in 
reference to the number marking the next president’s place in US history.

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is going 
for the jugular:

“Donald really is as healthy as a horse — you know, the one Vladimir Putin 
rides around on."

Hillary Clinton, on history:

We’ll either have the first woman president, or the first president who’s 
started a Twitter war with Cher.
 
Hillary Clinton, on being prepared:

There is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>. Donald wanted me drug-tested 
before last night’s debate - and look, I gotta tell you that Donald thought I 
used some sort of performance-enhancer. Now, actually, I did - it’s called 
preparation.
 
Hillary Clinton, on the State of Liberty as an object of lust:

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> looks at the 
Statue of Liberty and sees a four. Maybe a five, if she loses the torch and 
tablet and changes her hair.
 
Hillary Clinton gets back at Donald Trump:

It’s amazing I’m up here after Donald - I didn’t think he’d be okay with a 
peaceful transition of power. And, Donald, after listening to your speech, I 
will also enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.
 
Speaking at the Alfred Smith memorial dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in New 
York City, former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nomineeHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> follows a deeply 
un-funny set by Donald Trump.

“I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here,” Clinton joked. 
“Usually I charge a lot for speeches like this, but for me, it was kind of 
ironic thinking about a fiery populist, Al Smith.”

“If he were here today and saw how much money we’ve raised for needy children, 
he’d be very proud. And if he saw this magnificent room full of plutocrats 
celebrating his legacy, he’d be very confused.”
