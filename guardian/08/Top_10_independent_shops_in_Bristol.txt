Rise Music

The Bristol branch of this mini-chain (the others are in Cheltenham and 
Worcester) is what every independent record shop aspires to be. Staff are 
knowledgeable (verging on geeky), curating a huge range of rock, pop, dance, 
jazz, classical, soul, metal and more, on CD and vinyl, plus cult books, movies 
and vintage clothes. This retail mix, and the in-store cafe-bar, encourages 
just hanging out. Rise Music hosts live events too – DJ Shadow and Mumford & 
Sons are just two of the big names to have played here; next on the calender is
Record Store Day <http://www.recordstoreday.co.uk/> (19 April), a celebration 
of independent stores, with live performances and exclusive vinyl releases.

Rag Trade Boutique

Most women in the UK wear just 10% of their wardrobes, reckons Rag Trade, 
whose mission is to help hoarders recycle their redundant clothes piles. Book 
an appointment, bring in your unwanted designer threads, shoes, bags and 
trinkets and if they're up to scratch, Rag Trade will resell them for you. The 
shop takes a cut, and you get either cash or credit to spend in store. The 
result is a quality-controlled, constantly changing treasure trove of 
re-loveable pieces, from Monsoon to Mulberry. Of course, you can just shop 
rather than swap – it's a great way to get a high-end look at high-street 
prices.

Cox and Baloney

Amy Cox and Joney McNamara know how to nose out a fine frock or knick-knack – 
both worked in TV, sourcing props and costumes for programmes such as Skins and 
Lark Rise to Candleford. They've applied these skills to Cox and Baloney, an 
emporium of vintage, limited-edition and reworked clothing and homewares. 
Bespoke lines include 1940's dress patterns made in contemporary fabrics and 
bone china designed using original lithographs from defunct Staffordshire 
factories and printed by thePeoples Republic of Stokes Croft 
<http://www.prsc.org.uk/>, a charity down the road. They also stock loose-leaf 
teas – to buy in-store or sample at its Tea Room next door.

Grape & Grind
 Grape and Grind, Bristol 
When Darren Willis opened Grape & Grind in 2010 he wanted to avoid the "posh 
wine shop" tag that gets attached to many independents. Here, the vibe is 
welcoming and unintimidating. There are high-end wines but also great everyday 
drinkers – and, between them, the staff have tried everything. It is planning 
to install AnEnomatic  <http://www.enomatic.co.uk/>wine dispenser too, so 
customers will be able to try a few. Willis uses a mix of small suppliers, and 
loves unusual varieties. He also stocks specialist teas and coffees, craft 
beers and whiskies made by Signatory, an independent bottler that matures casks 
at Scotland's smallest distillery.

Dreadnought

Small but chock-full, Dreadnought is a secondhand bookstore run by a communist 
bibliophile with a strong sense of community. Owner John Sidwell specialises in 
military and social history (of which there's a healthy selection), but he's 
keen that any casual browser might find something to suit. He shapes his stock 
– currently including Isaiah Berlin's Russian Thinkers, Cormac McCarthy's The 
Road and A Discographical History of Bristol Folk Music – to the interests of 
local customers. Big profits are not the aim, and books are always affordably 
priced, with discounts for students, pensioners and the unwaged.

Bristol Cider Shop

Peter Snowman is a cider snob. His Bristol store stocks only "real" 100%-juice 
cider and perry, all made within 80km of Bristol by small independent 
producers, and sourced direct from the farms. But while the ciders are high-end 
award-winners, there's nothing snooty about the shop: Peter's aim is to 
demystify the drink. So there are always flagons of draft cider on tap for 
tasting, alongside 100-odd bottled varieties. His current favourite is Tyndale 
Gold, from a tiny producer in Gloucestershire: "Really light and fruity with a 
medium-dry finish – just my kind of cider."

Shop

Despite its name, Shop is not that simple. This magpie's nest of secondhand 
vinyl, homewares, furniture and fashion is a non-profit social enterprise 
"vintage lounge and arts venue". It's part bright boutique, full of interesting 
finds ("We love everything in Shop," says director Jayne Marshall. "Our rule 
is: if we don't love it, we don't have it.") and part communal space: the 
top-floor living room serves coffee (free) and cake from a local micro-bakery, 
as well as hosting gigs, workshops and exhibitions. There's also a "Take It and 
Leave It Gallery": you take an artwork you like and donate another in its place.

Opus 13
 Photograph: Michael Lloyd 
Part of the Christmas Steps Arts Quarter – its neighbours include violin 
shops, a bowmaker and a brass and woodwind specialist – Opus 13 specialises in 
all things classical music, except instruments. A haven from the city bustle, 
it stocks a wide range of CDs and sheet music, plus items from musical 
crossword compendiums to Mozart cookie cutters. Aficionados are well-served, 
but owner Ruth is more than happy to advise those with no musical knowledge. 
Her current pick is a new Naxos book called My First Orchestra, in which Tormod 
the Norwegian troll guides children through the instruments.

One purple shopfront, six creative ladies; this little independent gift 
boutique is run by a small co-operative of artists who sell their lovely, 
complementary but very different wares. Items range fromJemima Lumley 
<http://www.jemimalumley.co.uk/>'s silver charms (inspired by Victorian 
mourning jewellery, but far sunnier than that implies), screen prints fromJane 
Ormes <http://www.janeormes.co.uk/> and Chitra Merchant 
<http://www.chitra.co.uk/>, Sinead Finnegan <http://www.sineadfinnegan.com/>'s 
found-fabric embroideries andRobyn Coetzee <http://www.robyncoetzee.co.uk/>'s 
decorative kiln-formed glass. Textile artistKate Tarling 
<http://www.figshop.co.uk/kate/> has just started taking commissions for small, 
hand-stitched portraits of people and pets. Smaller items, such as handmade 
cards and locally published books, are for sale at the front; the back opens 
into an airy gallery.

Reclaimers Reclamation 

With its jumble of bygone signs, sewing machines, mangles, medicine bottles, 
garden statuary and rusty bikes, Reclaimers Reclamation feels more messy museum 
than homewares shop. Entered via a narrow alley off Gloucester Road, it's a den 
of delights for the Ikea-averse house-doer-upper. The store focuses on 
recycling and regenerating furniture and fittings; specialities include kitchen 
worktops fashioned from snooker-table slate, restored fireplaces and pine doors 
glazed to order with original stained glass. It seems like it has everything 
(if you're willing to sort and sift); if not, it can be sourced for you.
