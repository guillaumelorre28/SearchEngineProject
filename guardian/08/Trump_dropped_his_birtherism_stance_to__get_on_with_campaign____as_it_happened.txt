 * As Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> continued 
his attempts to reach out to African American voters, boxing promoter Don King 
used the N-word in introducing him at a church in Cleveland. Speaking at the 
Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership Conference hosted by longtime 
Trump ally Dr Darrell Scott, King used the term seemingly by accident while 
attempting to use “negro” as a replacement. “I told Michael Jackson, I said, 
‘If you are poor, you are a poor negro,’” he said. “I would use the N-word. But 
if you are rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, 
you’re an intellectual negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding 
nigger – I meant negro – you’re a dancing and sliding and gliding negro. So 
dare not alienate because you cannot assimilate.” The use of the racial epithet 
led to awkward laughter from Trump and other audience members. 
 * The Green party may try to “escort” candidate Jill Stein 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jill-stein> into the presidential debates 
in an attempt to get her onstage, a campaign adviser announced on Wednesday. 
Kevin Zeese told the Guardian that Stein, her vice-presidential candidate Ajamu 
Baraka and 100 of her supporters were willing to risk arrest at the debates, 
the first of which will be held at New York’s Hofstra University on Monday. 
“About 300 people have already signed up to protest, 100 are willing to risk 
arrest,” Zeese said.“We hope Jill and Ajamu will not get arrested as we want 
them to respond in live time to the debate but when you are on the frontlines, 
things are not always in our control.” The Commission on Presidential Debates 
announced on Friday that the third-party candidates Stein and Libertarian Gary 
Johnsonhad failed to qualify for the first debate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/gary-johnson-and-jill-stein-not-allowed-in-first-televised-debate>
.

 * In a one-on-one interview 
<http://abc6onyourside.com/news/election/1-on-1-with-donald-trump> with a local 
ABC affiliate before a campaign appearance in Toledo, Ohio, Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump told a reporter that the reason behind his 
reversal on his long-held stance on President Barack Obama’s citizenship was 
that he “wanted to get on with the campaign.” 
 * “This announcement earlier this week with you saying that you believe 
President Obama was in fact born in the United States, after all the years 
where you’ve expressed some doubt, what changed?” asked ABC6 reporter Ben 
Garbarek. 
 * This coming weekend, cast members from Aaron Sorkin walk-and-talk political 
drama <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il-DowDFDo4> The West Wing will campaign 
for Hillary Clinton in Ohio, the biggest instance of liberal showbiz wish 
fulfillment since... well, since The West Wing was on the air in the first

Don King joins Donald Trump for town hall on Fox News

Boxing promoter and convicted manslaughterer Don Kin joined Republican 
presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> on Fox News host Sean 
Hannity’s town hall aimed at winning the hearts of African American voters 
today, a sentence we never thought we’d be typing.

“What I’m asking Donald Trump to do is what Donald Trump volunteered to do, it 
is to change the system,” King, who once kicked a man to death on a stretch of 
road now named after him, said. “It doesn’t matter about, whatever we seem 
right, wrong or indifferent. If the system doesn’t change, it’s going to be the 
same. So I say, why would Donald Trump be different from Obama or any other 
president? Because he will call them out.?

King cited the example of South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who he 
initially called “Lindsey Tucker.”

Would-be Democratic presidential nominee Bernie Sanders may no longer have a 
shot at winning his (newly adopted) party’s nomination, but he has found a new 
role to take on: that of a young-adult nonfiction author.

Sanders’ upcoming book, Our Revolution, will reportedly be adapted for high 
school-age kids,according to CNN 
<http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/21/media/bernie-sanders-young-adult-nonfiction-book/index.html>
.

The book, according to publisher Henry Holt, will be “an inspiring teen guide 
to engaging with and shaping the world - a perfect gift and important read.”

Hillary Clinton’s campaign has responded to Donald Trump’s declaration that 
the only reason he abandoned his never-ending quest to prove that President 
Barack Obama was not born in the United States was that he wanted to “get on 
with the campaign.”

“After spending 5 years championing a conspiracy theory to undermine our first 
African American President,Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> hasn’t actually changed his 
mind,” said campaign spokesperson Jesse Ferguson. “He only gave his 36 second 
press statement last week to try to change the subject - and it didn’t work.”

Donald Trump, on his foundation using charitable donations to settle his legal 
debts:

The foundation is really there. It gives money to that. It’s really been doing 
a good job. I think we put that to sleep just by putting out the last report.

Donald Trump’s endorsement of a nationwide “stop-and-frisk” policy at a town 
hall hosted by acolyte Sean Hannity this afternoon has been well reported, but 
here are a few other moments from the town hall that will likely spark intense 
conversations regarding the candidate’s policies:

On the shooting of an unarmed man in Tulsa, Oklahoma:

HANNITY: I saw it.

TRUMP: And a young policemen shot this man. I don’t get it. I don’t care where 
you’re coming from. There was something really bad going on.

HANNITY: I saw it. He had his hands up.

TRUMP: I don’t know if she choked. He was walking. His hands were high. He was 
walking to the car. He put the hands on the car.Now, maybe she choked. 
Something really bad happened.

On “the race card”:

You know, the one thing I see is that when you start to win, and I’ve watched 
this not just for me, I’ve watched it over the years, when you start to win and 
win and win, they have nothing to say and they can’t stop you, they always 
start using the racist word. It’s a very interesting phenomenon, but the word 
“racist” comes out and that means that you’re winning and that’s their last 
chance, and I don’t think it’s working.

Donald Trump on birtherism change of heart: 'I just wanted to get on with the 
campaign'

In a one-on-one interview 
<http://abc6onyourside.com/news/election/1-on-1-with-donald-trump> with a local 
ABC affiliate before a campaign appearance in Toledo, Ohio, Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump told a reporter that the reason behind his 
reversal on his long-held stance on President Barack Obama’s citizenship was 
that he “wanted to get on with the campaign.”

“This announcement earlier this week with you saying that you believe 
President Obama was in fact born in the United States, after all the years 
where you’ve expressed some doubt, what changed?” asked ABC6 reporter Ben 
Garbarek.

“Well, I just wanted to get on with, I wanted to get on with the campaign,” 
Trump said. “A lot of people were asking me questions. We want to talk about 
jobs. We want to talk about the military. We want to talk about Isis and get 
rid of Isis. We want to talk about bringing jobs back to this area because 
you’ve been decimated so we just wanted to get back on the subject of jobs, 
military, taking care of our vets, et cetera.”

Trump then left the interview for the event.

Trump attempted to resolve the issue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-obama-birth-certificate-clinton>
 last Friday by admitting that Obama was born in the US after years of 
promoting false claims that he was born in Kenya, but continued to falsely 
claim that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was behind the conspiracy 
theory.

Gary Johnson calls 'bullshit' on running mate dropping out of race

Libertarian presidential nominee and former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson 
dropped a colorful bit of languageduring a Facebook Live interview 
<https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t42.9040-29/10000000_1142078282539819_6413390207432785920_n.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InNkIn0%3D&oh=2df96420da3b922264ca49411d31e2dd&oe=57E31599>
 this afternoon, telling a journalist that rumors that his running mate, Bill 
Weld, is on the verge of dropping from the ticket are “bullshit.”

The rumor, started last week by reporter Carl Bernstein, implies that Weld, 
startled by the possibility that the Libertarian ticket could spoil Hillary 
Clinton’s chances of winning the White House and functionally hand the election 
to Republican nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, will soon drop out of the 
race and endorse Clinton.

“That is bullshit,” Johnson told USA Today opinion editor Bill Sternberg, who 
was slightly flummoxed by the language.

“We are on Facebook Live,” Sternberg said.

House Democrats and civil rights experts have warned that tens of thousands of 
African American voters face potential disenfranchisement in November’s 
presidential election, the first since the supreme court struck down key 
provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

Initiative in his offices at Trump Tower in New York. Photograph: Gerald 
Herbert/AP 
Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under 
Law, told a meeting at the US Capitol on Wednesday that it is contesting 
“dozens” of litigations across the country.

“Right now we are fighting in Hancock County, Georgia, where election 
officials have undertaken an effort to ‘clean up’ the registration rolls and 
have purged legitimately registered African Americans from the rolls,” she 
said. “They engage the sheriff’s office in this scheme. The sheriff’s office 
will be deployed to people’s homes and tell you that you are being issued a 
summons to come down and establish your voting eligibility.”
Clarke added: “We filed just last week in Georgia where the secretary of 
state’s office has failed to process more than 42,000 registration forms from 
people who want to vote because of a restrictive practice that requires that 
every letter, every digit, every character on a registration form exactly match 
information contained in the state’s database. And we know those databases are 
riddled with errors and this is a practice that disadvantages African Americans 
and minority voters in particular.”

In 2013, the supreme court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act in a 
5-4 ruling in Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/jun/25/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-live#block-51c9bd00e4b010aecdc44f5d>
. 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/jun/25/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-live#block-51c9bd00e4b010aecdc44f5d>
 Section 4 concerned the formula for determining which states are covered under 
Section 5 of the law requiring “pre-clearance” for changes to voting laws.This 
rendered Section 5 inoperative 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/jun/25/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-live#block-51c9ae40e4b08e8808d8dc29>
 unless Congress came up with a revised version of determining coverage. 
Congress has so far failed to do so; activists blamed Republican leaders for 
inaction.

Clarke noted that Wednesday’s panel discussion was taking part in the Lyndon 
Johnson room, named after the president who signed voting rights into law. She 
warned: “What I can tell you is this: the world has changed in the absence of 
section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Officials at the state and the local level 
have exploited every opportunity they can to institute or maintain 
discriminatory voting practices in the absence of section 5.


“Each day that Congress fails to act, we not only subject African Americans 
and other minority voters to the recurring indignity of voter discrimination 
but taxpayers suffer too. North Carolina has spent nearly $5m defending its 
discriminatory voter suppression law; Texas has spent more than $3.5m defending 
its discriminatory voter ID law. And the price tag increases each day.
“Voter discrimination, if left unchecked, will stand as a stain on our 
democracy. It is bad for taxpayers, it is bad for Americans. It is time for 
Congress to stop turning a blind eye to the resurgence of voter discrimination 
in our country.”

Recent restrictions passed by 14 states include new photo ID requirements, a 
reduction in early voting days and the abolition of same-day registration. 
Voter fraud is often cited as a reason but experts said the problem is 
“minuscule”.

Civil rights stalwart John Lewis, a Democratic Representative from Georgia, 
was in the room when Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. But he said during 
this year’s primaries he came across a couple who had been married for 40 but 
were told to vote at separate polling stations.


“In the past few months and years I’ve traveled across the country and I know 
that there is a deliberate persistent systematic effort to make it harder and 
more difficult for the disabled, student, senior, minority, the poor and rural 
voters to participate in the democratic process. That’s not right, not fair, 
and it’s not just.”


He said it was a “disgrace” that Congress has not acted and call on Clarke’s 
organisation to “file suits all over the place to make it real, make it plain”.

race

According to the latest national poll released by NBC/the Wall Street Journal,

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> leads Republican nominee 
Donald Trump by 7 points nationally, 48% to 41%, a,d leads by 6 points in a

Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson has broken the double digits 
with 10% support, while Green nominee Jill Stein holds at 3%.

Clinton heads into the first presidential debate this coming Monday with only 
slightly weakened margins since the last time the poll was conducted, and with 
an increase in her (still dismal) favorability ratings. Clinton is now viewed 
positively by 37% of voters and negatively by 52%, while views of Trump are 
still deeply, historically negative at 28% positive, 61% negative, a decrease 
in favorability ratings since the beginning of the summer.

The poll, conducted by phone, includes 1,000 registered voters and was between 
16-19 September. Among the 922 respondents deemed “likely voters,” the margin 
for error is 3.23 percentage points.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> today described 
the threat posed by Syrian refugees as not “only a matter of terrorism, but 
also a matter of quality of life”.
 Donald Trump Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters 
The statement marked a new escalation of Trump’s rhetoric warning of the 
danger of admitting into the United States Syrian refugees, whom he has 
repeatedly compared to the Trojan horse.

Trump’s remarks came at a rally in Toledo, Ohio, where the Republican nominee 
once again addressed the issue of terrorism in the aftermath of thebombing 
attacks in New York and New Jersey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/ahmad-khan-rahami-charged-bombings-new-york-new-jersey>
 in the past week.

He linked the attack to the admission of immigrants and refugees from 
overseas. “We’ve admitted tens of thousands with no effective screening plan,” 
Trump claimed, adding: “We have no idea who we are letting in. You’ve seen what 
happened.”

The United States has an extensive refugee screening program 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism>
 for those entering from Syria that takes up to two years. The accused New York 
bomber, Ahmad Khan Rahami, entered the US as a child and is a naturalized 
citizen.

The Republican nominee expanded his argument, bringing in concerns about 
“quality of life”.

Trump claimed: “Altogether, the Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> plan would bring in 
620,000 refugees in the first term. Her plan would cost $400bn in terms of 
lifetime welfare and entitlement costs – think of that.”

Both of these figures have been proven false 
<http://www.factcheck.org/2016/08/trumps-terrorism-speech/> by independent 
fact-checkers.

Trump says Syrian refugees aren't just a terrorist threat, they'd hurt quality 
of life

Donald Trump’s oldest son has defended comparing Syrian refugees to poisoned 
Skittles today,telling the Utah-based Deseret News 
<http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865662960/Donald-Trump-Jr-says-father-running-on-values-held-dear-by-Utahns.html>
 that the failures of refugee programs in Europe are evidence that he is right.

“We’ve seen what’s going on in Europe,” Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> Jr. said. “We can’t be naive 
to that and pretend that’s not happening there. If there’s one death associated 
with it because we messed up and we didn’t do it right, that’s a problem for 
me.”
Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr)

The tweet sparked outrage on social media, with some users posting harrowing 
images of Syrians caught up in the civil war juxtaposed with the word Skittles.

The younger Trump protested that photo he tweeted was not an exact ratio, 
because it “didn’t say numbers of Skittles.”

 * As Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> continued 
his attempts to reach out to African American voters, boxing promoter Don King 
used the N-word in introducing him at a church in Cleveland. Speaking at the 
Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership Conference hosted by longtime 
Trump ally Dr Darrell Scott, King used the term seemingly by accident while 
attempting to use “negro” as a replacement. “I told Michael Jackson, I said, 
‘If you are poor, you are a poor negro,’” he said. “I would use the N-word. But 
if you are rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, 
you’re an intellectual negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding 
nigger – I meant negro – you’re a dancing and sliding and gliding negro. So 
dare not alienate because you cannot assimilate.” The use of the racial epithet 
led to awkward laughter from Trump and other audience members. 
 * The Green party may try to “escort” candidate Jill Stein 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jill-stein> into the presidential debates 
in an attempt to get her onstage, a campaign adviser announced on Wednesday. 
Kevin Zeese told the Guardian that Stein, her vice-presidential candidate Ajamu 
Baraka and 100 of her supporters were willing to risk arrest at the debates, 
the first of which will be held at New York’s Hofstra University on Monday. 
“About 300 people have already signed up to protest, 100 are willing to risk 
arrest,” Zeese said.“We hope Jill and Ajamu will not get arrested as we want 
them to respond in live time to the debate but when you are on the frontlines, 
things are not always in our control.” The Commission on Presidential Debates 
announced on Friday that the third-party candidates Stein and Libertarian Gary 
Johnsonhad failed to qualify for the first debate

Boxing promoter and convicted manslaughterer Don Kin joined Republican 
presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> on Fox News host Sean 
Hannity’s town hall aimed at winning the hearts of African American voters 
today, a sentence we never thought we’d be typing.

“What I’m asking Donald Trump to do is what Donald Trump volunteered to do, it 
is to change the system,” King, who once kicked a man to death on a stretch of 
road now named after him, said. “It doesn’t matter about, whatever we seem 
right, wrong or indifferent. If the system doesn’t change, it’s going to be the 
same. So I say, why would Donald Trump be different from Obama or any other 
president? Because he will call them out.?

King cited the example of South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who he 
initially called “Lindsey Tucker.”
 
Would-be Democratic presidential nominee Bernie Sanders may no longer have a 
shot at winning his (newly adopted) party’s nomination, but he has found a new 
role to take on: that of a young-adult nonfiction author.

Sanders’ upcoming book, Our Revolution, will reportedly be adapted for high 
school-age kids,according to CNN 
<http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/21/media/bernie-sanders-young-adult-nonfiction-book/index.html>
.

The book, according to publisher Henry Holt, will be “an inspiring teen guide 
to engaging with and shaping the world - a perfect gift and important read.”
 
Hillary Clinton’s campaign has responded to Donald Trump’s declaration that 
the only reason he abandoned his never-ending quest to prove that President 
Barack Obama was not born in the United States was that he wanted to “get on 
with the campaign.”

“After spending 5 years championing a conspiracy theory to undermine our first 
African American President,Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> hasn’t actually changed his 
mind,” said campaign spokesperson Jesse Ferguson. “He only gave his 36 second 
press statement last week to try to change the subject - and it didn’t work.”
 
Donald Trump, on his foundation using charitable donations to settle his legal 
debts:

The foundation is really there. It gives money to that. It’s really been doing 
a good job. I think we put that to sleep just by putting out the last report.
 
Donald Trump’s endorsement of a nationwide “stop-and-frisk” policy at a town 
hall hosted by acolyte Sean Hannity this afternoon has been well reported, but 
here are a few other moments from the town hall that will likely spark intense 
conversations regarding the candidate’s policies:

On the shooting of an unarmed man in Tulsa, Oklahoma:

HANNITY: I saw it.

TRUMP: And a young policemen shot this man. I don’t get it. I don’t care where 
you’re coming from. There was something really bad going on.

HANNITY: I saw it. He had his hands up.

TRUMP: I don’t know if she choked. He was walking. His hands were high. He was 
walking to the car. He put the hands on the car.Now, maybe she choked. 
Something really bad happened.

On “the race card”:

You know, the one thing I see is that when you start to win, and I’ve watched 
this not just for me, I’ve watched it over the years, when you start to win and 
win and win, they have nothing to say and they can’t stop you, they always 
start using the racist word. It’s a very interesting phenomenon, but the word 
“racist” comes out and that means that you’re winning and that’s their last 
chance, and I don’t think it’s working.

reversal on his long-held stance on President Barack Obama’s citizenship was 
that he “wanted to get on with the campaign.”

“This announcement earlier this week with you saying that you believe 
President Obama was in fact born in the United States, after all the years 
where you’ve expressed some doubt, what changed?” asked ABC6 reporter Ben 
Garbarek.

“Well, I just wanted to get on with, I wanted to get on with the campaign,” 
Trump said. “A lot of people were asking me questions. We want to talk about 
jobs. We want to talk about the military. We want to talk about Isis and get 
rid of Isis. We want to talk about bringing jobs back to this area because 
you’ve been decimated so we just wanted to get back on the subject of jobs, 
military, taking care of our vets, et cetera.”

Trump then left the interview for the event.

Trump attempted to resolve the issue

 last Friday by admitting that Obama was born in the US after years of 
promoting false claims that he was born in Kenya, but continued to falsely 
claim that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was behind the conspiracy 
theory.
 
Libertarian presidential nominee and former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson 
dropped a colorful bit of languageduring a Facebook Live interview

 this afternoon, telling a journalist that rumors that his running mate, Bill 
Weld, is on the verge of dropping from the ticket are “bullshit.”

The rumor, started last week by reporter Carl Bernstein, implies that Weld, 
startled by the possibility that the Libertarian ticket could spoil Hillary 
Clinton’s chances of winning the White House and functionally hand the election 
to Republican nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, will soon drop out of the 
race and endorse Clinton.

“That is bullshit,” Johnson told USA Today opinion editor Bill Sternberg, who 
was slightly flummoxed by the language.

“We are on Facebook Live,” Sternberg said.
 
House Democrats and civil rights experts have warned that tens of thousands of 
African American voters face potential disenfranchisement in November’s 
presidential election, the first since the supreme court struck down key 
provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under 
Law, told a meeting at the US Capitol on Wednesday that it is contesting 
“dozens” of litigations across the country.

“Right now we are fighting in Hancock County, Georgia, where election 
officials have undertaken an effort to ‘clean up’ the registration rolls and 
have purged legitimately registered African Americans from the rolls,” she 
said. “They engage the sheriff’s office in this scheme. The sheriff’s office 
will be deployed to people’s homes and tell you that you are being issued a 
summons to come down and establish your voting eligibility.”
Clarke added: “We filed just last week in Georgia where the secretary of 
state’s office has failed to process more than 42,000 registration forms from 
people who want to vote because of a restrictive practice that requires that 
every letter, every digit, every character on a registration form exactly match 
information contained in the state’s database. And we know those databases are 
riddled with errors and this is a practice that disadvantages African Americans 
and minority voters in particular.”

In 2013, the supreme court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act in a 
5-4 ruling in Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/jun/25/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-live#block-51c9bd00e4b010aecdc44f5d>
. 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/jun/25/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-live#block-51c9bd00e4b010aecdc44f5d>
 Section 4 concerned the formula for determining which states are covered under 
Section 5 of the law requiring “pre-clearance” for changes to voting laws.This 
rendered Section 5 inoperative 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/jun/25/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-live#block-51c9ae40e4b08e8808d8dc29>
 unless Congress came up with a revised version of determining coverage. 
Congress has so far failed to do so; activists blamed Republican leaders for 
inaction.

Clarke noted that Wednesday’s panel discussion was taking part in the Lyndon 
Johnson room, named after the president who signed voting rights into law. She 
warned: “What I can tell you is this: the world has changed in the absence of 
section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Officials at the state and the local level 
have exploited every opportunity they can to institute or maintain 
discriminatory voting practices in the absence of section 5.


“Each day that Congress fails to act, we not only subject African Americans 
and other minority voters to the recurring indignity of voter discrimination 
but taxpayers suffer too. North Carolina has spent nearly $5m defending its 
discriminatory voter suppression law; Texas has spent more than $3.5m defending 
its discriminatory voter ID law. And the price tag increases each day.
“Voter discrimination, if left unchecked, will stand as a stain on our 
democracy. It is bad for taxpayers, it is bad for Americans. It is time for 
Congress to stop turning a blind eye to the resurgence of voter discrimination 
in our country.”

Recent restrictions passed by 14 states include new photo ID requirements, a 
reduction in early voting days and the abolition of same-day registration. 
Voter fraud is often cited as a reason but experts said the problem is 
“minuscule”.

Civil rights stalwart John Lewis, a Democratic Representative from Georgia, 
was in the room when Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. But he said during 
this year’s primaries he came across a couple who had been married for 40 but 
were told to vote at separate polling stations.


“In the past few months and years I’ve traveled across the country and I know 
that there is a deliberate persistent systematic effort to make it harder and 
more difficult for the disabled, student, senior, minority, the poor and rural 
voters to participate in the democratic process. That’s not right, not fair, 
and it’s not just.”


He said it was a “disgrace” that Congress has not acted and call on Clarke’s 
organisation to “file suits all over the place to make it real, make it plain”.

Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson has broken the double digits 
with 10% support, while Green nominee Jill Stein holds at 3%.

Clinton heads into the first presidential debate this coming Monday with only 
slightly weakened margins since the last time the poll was conducted, and with 
an increase in her (still dismal) favorability ratings. Clinton is now viewed 
positively by 37% of voters and negatively by 52%, while views of Trump are 
still deeply, historically negative at 28% positive, 61% negative, a decrease 
in favorability ratings since the beginning of the summer.

The poll, conducted by phone, includes 1,000 registered voters and was between 
16-19 September. Among the 922 respondents deemed “likely voters,” the margin 
for error is 3.23 percentage points.
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> today described 
the threat posed by Syrian refugees as not “only a matter of terrorism, but 
also a matter of quality of life”.

The statement marked a new escalation of Trump’s rhetoric warning of the 
danger of admitting into the United States Syrian refugees, whom he has 
repeatedly compared to the Trojan horse.

Trump’s remarks came at a rally in Toledo, Ohio, where the Republican nominee 
once again addressed the issue of terrorism in the aftermath of thebombing 
attacks in New York and New Jersey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/ahmad-khan-rahami-charged-bombings-new-york-new-jersey>
 in the past week.

He linked the attack to the admission of immigrants and refugees from 
overseas. “We’ve admitted tens of thousands with no effective screening plan,” 
Trump claimed, adding: “We have no idea who we are letting in. You’ve seen what 
happened.”

The United States has an extensive refugee screening program 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism>
 for those entering from Syria that takes up to two years. The accused New York 
bomber, Ahmad Khan Rahami, entered the US as a child and is a naturalized 
citizen.

The Republican nominee expanded his argument, bringing in concerns about 
“quality of life”.

Trump claimed: “Altogether, the Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> plan would bring in 
620,000 refugees in the first term. Her plan would cost $400bn in terms of 
lifetime welfare and entitlement costs – think of that.”

Both of these figures have been proven false

fact-checkers.

Donald Trump’s oldest son has defended comparing Syrian refugees to poisoned 
Skittles today,telling the Utah-based Deseret News 
<http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865662960/Donald-Trump-Jr-says-father-running-on-values-held-dear-by-Utahns.html>
 that the failures of refugee programs in Europe are evidence that he is right.

“We’ve seen what’s going on in Europe,” Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> Jr. said. “We can’t be naive 
to that and pretend that’s not happening there. If there’s one death associated 
with it because we messed up and we didn’t do it right, that’s a problem for 
me.”

The tweet sparked outrage on social media, with some users posting harrowing 
images of Syrians caught up in the civil war juxtaposed with the word Skittles.

The younger Trump protested that photo he tweeted was not an exact ratio, 
because it “didn’t say numbers of Skittles.”
