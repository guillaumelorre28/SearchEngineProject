. It was a landmark victory for the home side, who had previously beaten only 
Zimbabwe (five times) and a depleted West Indies (twice) in the longest format 
of the game. It was something of a humiliation for England.

At the start of the day Bangladesh, 128 ahead with seven wickets left, were 
favourites to make some history. They set a target of 273 on a devilish track 
but by tea England had cruised to 100 without loss. After the break, though, 
Alastair Cook’s side, tormented by the teenage off-spinner Mehedi Hasan, were 
bowled out for 164, losing 10 wickets in 110 minutes.

Cook has experienced many highs and lows as England captain but here he was 
not altogether surprised by the defeat. England had extricated themselves from 
a tricky situation in Chittagongin the first Test 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/bangladesh-fall-short-as-england-secure-victory-on-final-day-of-first-test>
 but they could not manage a repeat.

“It’s very easy sitting back and saying it’s just Bangladesh,” he said. “But 
on spinning wickets their bowlers are good, they’re experienced – I know one of 
them is only 19 but he is experienced in these conditions and very good. It has 
been really tough but I don’t think this is the toughest defeat I’ve had to 
bear.”

Indeed Cook’s mood was phlegmatic, verging on philosophical. He knows there is 
a long tour ahead in India and that he needs to keep spirits high.

However, he was not quite in the mood to match the immortal words of the 
England rugby captain John Pullin, who led his side to an 18-9 defeat in Dublin 
at the height of the Troubles in 1973. At the dinner afterwards Pullin had to 
speak. “Well, we may not be very good,” he said, “but at least we turned up” – 
which won the hearts of the Irish. Here England have also won a few hearts by 
agreeing to come to Bangladesh as well as spreading even more joy by their 
defeat.

Cook was candid enough afterwards, admitting England’s spinners had been 
outbowled by those of Bangladesh. “In these three days we just haven’t been 
good enough to win a game of cricket. Sometimes you have to remember it’s just 
a game of cricket,” he said.

However, at times on the last day it became a very heated game, with Ben Stokes
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ben-stokes> getting a little too animated 
in his exchanges with the young Bangladesh batsman Sabbir Rahman. Stokes was 
fined 15% of his match fee and received one demerit point; three more of these 
in the next two years and he might be banned.

According to the International Cricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Council: “Stokes ignored the 
repeated requests and instructions of the on-field umpires by continuing to 
verbally engage with Sabbir. The on-field umpires had also advised the England 
captain of Stokes’s actions but the player didn’t comply with the instructions.”

This response to Stokes’s behaviour did not impress Cook greatly. “I do find 
it a little bit frustrating,” he said. “Both Sabbir and Stokesy are very 
competitive cricketers. To me people love it [when they confront one another]; 
that’s what people watch. Sometimes I believe the umpires can get involved too 
quickly and then it blows up even more. It drags the episode out and brings 
more theatre to it than you need.”

Even without this little contretemps there was a wonderful abundance of 
theatre in this series, the best between these two countries. While Bangladesh 
savour their win in Dhaka, Cook will be far more concerned by the frailties of 
his team exposed by the home side than the behaviour of his talismanic 
all-rounder.

England have 10 days to regroup before the first Test in India, which begins 
in Rajkot on 9 November. Between now and then there is a lot of thinking to do 
but no cricket planned beyond the confines of a net.
