Openly encouraging an oracular approach in which readers pose questions to a 
series of poems and identify either themselves or others through the answers 
they obtain, Fable showcases Benito del Pliego’s familiarly deft touch as he 
places puns alongside paradoxes and striking images next to penetrating 
insights in moving explorations of isolation and recollection. Continuing a 
career-long commitment to fostering meaningful interactions between a text and 
its interlocutors—whether readers, accompanying illustrations, or other poems 
in the collection — this Spanish poet highlights the unfamiliar in the familiar 
and makes poetry about the everyday seem anything but ordinary. These poems are 
taken from the collection Fable / Fábula, recently launched at McNally Jackson 
Books in New York.

THE SALMON 

—It’s hard to move forward when you only want to go against the current. 

Later you discover that nothing remains, that the future has countless origins.

Sometimes you feel like a shipwrecked sailor; sometimes you think anyone who 
wants to flee never goes further than herself.

THE SALT 

— Destruction/satisfaction: everything is a question of measurement. 

Suitable in its place, outside itself, exiled. For a fish, hearth. Over 
knowledge, light. Salaciousness, spilled without reason. For anyone who drinks 
it in another skin, delicacy; exhausted love, adversity.

From “nuances” to “nuisance” an “i”, an “i” with only one point: a single 
grain of salt.

THE CLOTHESPINS 

— Not being that which holds, being the clinging itself. Sustaining gives 
form, gives motive.

Metaphor of hunger, metaphor of strangling. 

Anguish remains when loss loses itself, drowned in melancholy’s arms. 

THE SHOES 

—A gap is a place and a shoe is a gap where many directions fit. 

The path you witness today you unwitness tomorrow. And despite all this, your 
toe will be the milestone opposing your heels.

The mouth itself is a shoe emptiness puts on. 

THE SCISSORS 

—Union of two and division of many. 

Those who come together and constantly chafe at each other form a single 
blade. Don’t get between those who love like this: the hunger to kill will show 
you no pity.
