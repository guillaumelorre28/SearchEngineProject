Not long after I finished In the Heat of the Night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/17/in-the-heat-of-the-night-review>, 
I went skiing in Idaho and my son broke his leg. Sitting opposite me in the 
hospital was the then junior senator for New York,Robert F Kennedy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/06/robert-kennedy-assassination-anniversary>
, whose son had broken his leg too. I told him I’d been working on a film about 
a black detective in a southern town. He said it could be an important film. He 
told me timing was everything – in politics, art and life.

It was 1966 and the US was going through traumatic times with the civil rights 
movement <https://www.theguardian.com/world/civil-rights-movement>. Cities were 
being burned down. The Mirisch Company, who were middle men for United Artists, 
had asked me to adaptJohn Ball’s book 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/in-the-heat-of-the-night.html> – even though, 
being from Toronto, I had no connection to the tension on America’s streets.

We reshaped the material, putting the focus on the relationship between Virgil 
Tibbs, the black detective from Philadelphia played by Sidney Poitier, and Bill 
Gillespie, the redneck sheriff played byRod Steiger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/10/guardianobituaries.filmnews1>. 
Poitier refused to film below the Mason-Dixon line, in southern Pennsylvania, 
since he andHarry Belafonte 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2012/jul/03/harry-belafonte-video-interview>
 had recently been harassed by theKu Klux Klan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/26/ku-klux-klan-history-book-white-robes-silver-screens-tom-rice>
 in Mississippi.

In the Heat of the Night review – still a brilliant, feverish drama

So we cut a deal. I found a little town called Sparta in Illinois, near the 
Mississippi river, the most southern location I could find. “If we film there,” 
I said, “you’ve got to give me a weekend inTennessee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tennessee> for the scene in the cotton 
plantation.” When we got to Tennessee, only the Holiday Inn would accept blacks 
and whites together. The local sheriff said: “Keep your people at the hotel. I 
don’t want them around town.”

The atmosphere fired up both actors. They ended up improvising a lot of the 
confession scene at the sheriff’s house, where they bond. We were sitting in 
the car outside, waiting to shoot, but the rain was so heavy on the roof we 
couldn’t record. So we just sat and rehearsed – and the scene got more and more 
intense. I’ll never forget Steiger turning to Poitier and saying: “Don’t get 
smart, black boy!” I didn’t know if Poitier was going to be offended, maybe ask 
Steiger not to say that. But we used it. I really lucked out with that 
rainstorm!

The famous slap, where Tibbs retaliates against a racist landowner, wasn’t 
improvised, though, as has been suggested. I kept telling Poitier that Tibbs 
was a sophisticated detective, not used to being pushed around. I showed him 
how to do the slap. “Don’t hit him on the ear,” I said. “I want you to really 
give him a crack on the fatty side of his cheek.” I told him to practise on me. 
A black man had never slapped a white man back in an American film. We broke 
that taboo.

Young black people in northern cities responded to the film in a much more 
visceral way than the whites did. This was the first time a black actor was 
wearing the fancy suit and being looked up to.

In January 1968, I was given the New York Critics’ Circle award for best 
drama. And who was presenting but Robert F Kennedy? “I told you the timing was 
right,” he said. Six months later,he was dead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2012/nov/14/assassination-robert-kennedy-pictures>
 – just after Martin Luther King’s assassination. I left America afterwards. I 
said to myself: “This is a country where they kill off their heroes. I’ve got 
to get out of here.”

United Artists were concerned. They feared the film might lead to unrest in 
the south, even riots. I said: “Suppose it never plays below the Mason-Dixon 
line? How much do you think we could afford to spend if we just limited the 
distribution?” They said $2m.

I said to production: “How many shooting days will this buy us?” We came up 
with a schedule of 40 days. And Poitier signed on for $200,000, well under his 
usual rate. It was the same year he made To Sir, With Love andGuess Who’s 
Coming to Dinner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/23/sidney-poitier-paved-barack-obama>
. He was theoutstanding black actor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/sidney-poitier-tibbs-best-performance-by-black-actor-angela-bassett>
 in film , one of the biggest stars of the whole industry. The fact that he was 
on board helped tremendously.

We didn’t just get film reviews, we got editorial comment – and all very 
favourable. Ultimately, of course, the film was released throughout the south 
and did reasonably well. It’s just as relevant today. I had hoped our country 
would have made more progress.

My father died just before the 1968 Oscars. I was feeling very disturbed and 
wasn’t sure I’d go. The competition was daunting and I’d no idea if we were 
going to win. Then King was assassinated and the ceremony was postponed. My 
family convinced me to go when it was finally rescheduled. My father would have 
agreed with the movie’s politics, so winning the best film Oscar for such a 
labour of love was a huge moment for me. It still is.
