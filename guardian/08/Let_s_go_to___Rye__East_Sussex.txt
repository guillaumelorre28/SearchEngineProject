Tell me about it
It was probably the jumble of fine Georgian and medieval houses, cobbled 
streets and views of Romney Marsh that drew writers EF Benson and Henry James 
to Rye. Both lived inLamb House <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lamb-house/>, 
the setting for fictional town Tilling in Benson’s Mapp and Lucia books (as 
seen in the recent BBC adaptation). Seafood is the other draw: the town is two 
miles from the sea and perched above the river Rother. Next month the annualRye 
Bay Scallop Week <http://scallop.org.uk/> (21 Feb-1 March) is on, which 
encourages local restaurants to dish up this toothsome mollusc in ever-more 
inventive ways.

I’ll need a drink to wash them down.
On the town’s outskirts, The Globe Inn Marsh <http://globeinnmarshrye.com/> is 
an eccentrically furnished clapboard building with log fires to hunker beside 
while nursing a well-kept pint.The George in Rye 
<http://www.thegeorgeinrye.com/> is a smart hotel with a bar perfect for 
sipping a chilled glass of white.

And if I don’t like scallops?
Freshly flavoured regional Indian food is dished up by chef Dev Biswal at The 
Ambrette <http://www.theambrette.co.uk/rye.php>. Webbe’s at the Fish Café  
<http://www.webbesrestaurants.co.uk/the-fish-cafe/> serves fish from the local 
fleet. And the High Street is packed with tea rooms offering homemade scones 
and sandwiches.

Anywhere to stay under £100?
Jeake’s House <http://www.jeakeshouse.com/> (rooms from £45pp) is a snug, 
richly furnished 16th-century small hotel in the centre of town. For a beach 
vibe,The Gallivant <http://thegallivant.co.uk/> (rooms from £95), down the road 
in Camber, is a restaurant with rooms a scramble away from the dunes.

Anything else I should know? 
Plenty of shopping opportunities including The Vintage Stockroom 
<http://www.vintagestockroom.com/>, a new shop packed with utilitarian 
furniture, industrial bits and Americana. A cluster of antique shops by the 
quay includeGlass Etc <http://www.ryesussex.co.uk/directory/1192/glass-etc/>, 
run by Antiques Roadshow expert Andy McConnell. The George hotel has just opened
The Shop Next Door <http://www.thegeorgeinrye.com/TSND.html> , selling 
hotel-inspired soft furnishings.

Do I need a car?
Not for meandering around town but it would be handy for exploring nearby 
dunes at Camber, Rye Bay and Romney Marsh. Trains run from Rye station to 
Ashford International (21 minutes), which has high-speed trains to London (38 
minutes), then beyond. The number 312 bus will take you from the town centre to 
the nature reserve at Rye Harbour.
