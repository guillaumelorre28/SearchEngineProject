18.3 Ashwin makes room and lofts down the ground, but he’s not caught it 
clean, and Pollard runs around from long-on to intercept, saving two; they run 
two.

18th over Chennai 157-8 (Ashwin 20, Sharma 1) Target 188 McClenaghan sends 
down an unnecessary bouncer, called wide for height, but the next two balls 
yield singles. That’s nowhere near enough for Chennai, so Ashwin slams six over 
mid-on, then, rather unnecessarily, premeditates a lap, beetling towards off 
and alerting the man at point, who beetles off in pursuit and allows just a 
single.

WICKET! Jadeja c Suchith b McClenaghan 19 (Chennai 147-8)

Looking for another maximum, Jadeja slashes outside off, and Suchith, running 
in from the rope, leaps forwards to hold a low catch at point.

18th over Chennai 147-7 (Jadeja 19, Ashwin 12) Target 188 McClenaghan back, 
curtains blowing in the wind - fitting, really, given their status as the 
answer to questions of peace - and Jadeja toes his first ball for six down the 
ground, just beating the leap and backwards dive of Pollard on the fence at 
long-on.

17th over Chennai 141-7 (Jadeja 13, Ashwin 12) Target 188 Malinga’s full and 
straight, funnily enough, his first two balls yielding just singles. But then 
Ashwin lifts over mid-off for four; can he manage another? He cannot, nudging 
around the corner for one, and nor can Jadeja, back-cutting for the same. One 
delivery left, boundaries required - and there’s it is, Ashwin jamming the bat 
down outside off and using the pace to run down to the third man fence. Well, 
Mumbai were 141-4 at the same stage - but with Pollard at the wicket.

16th over Chennai 129-7 (Jadeja 10, Ashwin 2) Target 188 The pressure’s 
relaxed now, but this is still a fine over from Kumar, ceding just eight runs 
and capturing a vital wicket. Both Jadeja and Ashwin know enough about hitting 
to make this close, but there’s not even a hint of that at the moment - oh, and 
here comes Malinga.

WICKET! Bravo run out 20 (Chennai 119-6)

That appears to have morphed into that. Again, Jadeja pushes for two, this 
time to deep square-leg, and running to the danger end, makes it - but Bravo’s 
reticence and concern for his partner causes him a problem. He lingers, looks, 
and Parthiv is alert enough, quick enough and skilled enough to throw down the 
stumps at the bowler’s end. Meanwhile, Pollard sulks, affronted that two was 
even possible.

15th over Chennai 119-5 (Bravo 20, Jadeja 8) Target 188 Pollard’s back, and 
after ceding a single from his first two balls, Jadeja cuts past backward point 
for four. Then, he runs one down to third man, sprinting the first hard enough 
to get back safely; very well done.

WICKET! Du Plessis c Kumar b Suchith 45 (Chennai 110-5)

Seeing no option but to go at Suchith, Du Plessis comes down and clouts one, 
but Suchith has held his nerve, flighting and keeping the pace off. The ball 
goes high, and Kumar runs in to hold.

13th over Chennai 95-4 (Du Plessis 45, Bravo 8) Target 188 Bhaji to continue; 
is it acceptable to call him that, likewise Faf Faf. I mean, they’re two of my 
best mates, but even so. He’s bowling nice and slowly here, teasing the batsmen 
to take him on, but they can’t or won’t - four singles from the over, and it’s 
really hard to see a way for Chennai now. That’s 2/26 for Harbhajan’s spell, 
and time for an altruistic timeout.

12th over Chennai 95-4 (Du Plessis 43, Bravo 6) Target 188 With Raina gone, 
Suchith comes on, and the batsmen can’t get his leggies away to begin with - 
but after three singles and a dot, Bravo whisks four to midwicket. A further 
dot follows in response, and the run rate, now 11.62, looks menacing.

11th over Chennai 88-4 (Du Plessis 41, Bravo 1) Target 188 What an over this 
is, what anover this almost is. Bravo whacks uppishly, and Bhaji, in his 
follow-through, should snaffle the snaffle, moving left - but he thumbs it, and 
leaves the pitch to have his hand seen to. There’s no hole in it.

ENORMOWICKET! Dhoni lbw b Harbhajan 0(Chennai 86-4)

Dhoni gets a first-baller! Harbhajan’s a bit quicker than he’s expecting, he 
plays the sweep, but from middle-and-off, misses, and is plumb. That might just 
be the game - plenty of batting left, but plenty more to do!

WICKET! Raina c & b Harbhajan 25 (Chennai 86-3)

Pressure tells! Aware that he needs to manufacture something, Raina goes at 
Harbhajan, thinks better of it immediately, and, defending, taps a return 
catch. All on Dhoni!

10th over Chennai 86-2 (Du Plessis 40, Raina 24) Target 188 Pollard’s back - 
Sharma’s keeping Suchith back hoping that the left-handed Raina will soon 
depart. Another quietish over - unlike Mumbai, who went hard all the way 
through, Chennai seem to be relying on a big finish.

9th over Chennai 79-2 (Du Plessis 39, Raina 20) Target 188 Faf is first to act 
with urgency, making room to hit over the top, but not getting all of it - 
little enough so that it drops well shy of long-off. They run one, and Raina 
comes down next ball, pounding six over long-on, before a single that allows 
Faf to snap four more through cover. Good over for Mumbai, 13 from it, and the 
pot is boiling. Time for a strategic ad-out!

8th over Chennai 67-2 (Du Plessis 34, Raina 13) Target 188 Pollard on, with 
pressure back on Chennai - they need some boundaries, but need not to lose more 
wickets. With the rate climbing above ten during the over, one of these two 
needs to go, but it’s just five singles scored; even three more like this, and 
it’ll be hard to see a way.

7th over Chennai 61-2 (Du Plessis 32, Raina 9) Target 188 Crucial moment in 
the game: Harbhajan into the attack. Faf works a single into the on-side, then 
a wide yields two, then another single. Bhaji’s enthusiasm and intensity is 
really something, he’s bowling as though he expects a wicket with every 
delivery, and will be relatively satisfied with ceding just seven from his 
first over.

5th over Chennai 46-1 (Hussey 16, Du Plessis 28) Target 188 McClenaghan back, 
to donate Faf some width - he cuts hard, sending four hurtling to third man, 
then picks the next one up from outside off to muscle-pull four over midwicket. 
Two dots follow, but then the final ball is too straight, so summarily banished 
over square-leg. Those curtains aren’t sitting quite so proud anymore, for this 
is a fine start.

4th over Chennai 33-1 (Hussey 15, Du Plessis 16) Target 188 McClenaghan, 
curtains and all, are banished, and Vinay Kumar arrives into the attack. Du 
Plessis nurdles a single into the off-side, and then Hussey wallops six into 
the box that we have have to be shown numerous times a game in order to 
advertise what I believe is a soft drink. Then, after another single, Hussey 
slices to third man, where Malinga, who’s had a horrible tournament in the 
field, has bare time to watch it into his hands - but instead splits them as 
the ball arrives. Oh dear. And this is now a good start.

2nd over: Chennai 19-1 (Hussey 6, Du Plessis 11) Target 188 In comes 
McClenaghan, who’s had a good tournament - but he opens with two wides, then a 
short one on the pads, that MrCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> pulls around the corner for four. 
The bowler is well and truly looked at by his captain, then after a couple 
back-of-a-length, goes fuller - and Faf meets the bounce, lifting six straight 
down the ground, then pulling four off his hip. 17 from the over.

WICKET! Smith lbw b Malinga 0 (Chennai 0-1)

Gosh, how do you keep that out? Well, Dwayne Smith certainly doesn’t know the 
answer, trapped in front by a venomous slingshot shin-high yorker - that’s 
going miles down! You can see the stumps! Smith, on the boundary, indicates 
displeasure. Richard Ill’worth, dear oh dear.

The players are back out, and Malinga has the ball. Between innings, Simmons 
pointed out the need to score when it’s hard, given a relatively slow track - 
will they dare to attack from the off?

That’ll sit fine enough with both sides. Mumbai would’ve lapped this up at the 
start, but fancied themselves for more given how well they started; Chennai 
would’ve planned for less, feared more, and will fancy themselves to chase 
this. Or, put another way, eyes down for a thriller!

WICKET! Pollard c Raina b Bravo 41 (Mumbai 185-6)

Bravo goes wide on the off-side, Pollard heaves again, but top-edges, and 
Raina takes another steepler with expert’s ease.

20th over: Mumbai 185-5 (Pollard 41, Harbhajan 5) Reckoning Harbhajan is 
running whatever, Bravo has Dhoni taking a glove off to sort any run out, 
before sending down a leg-side wide. Oh, and there’s an off-side wide next, 
after which Harbhajan slashes four over point for a one-bounce four; bravo 
seems to have forgotten that he can bat, as evidenced earlier in the 
competition. Crivens, there’s another wide, and then Bhaji picks up a yorker 
which he clips to long-on - Du Plessis runs in, dives forward, and puts down 
the catch with his fingertips, while Pollard ambles down to the business end. 
My days, Pollard is something! Bravo fires into the blockhole, so obviously six 
is flicked flat over long-on!

19th over: Mumbai 171-5 (Pollard 35, Harbhajan 0) Pollard’s on strike - they 
ran on the wicket, a tad surprisingly - and again, Mohit is wide. Obviously, 
he’s then punished with a flat six belted over midwicket, while Dhoni 
approaches the umpire to discuss the extras.

WICKET! Rayudu c Raina b Mohit 10 (Mumbai 164-5)

Two balls of the penultimate over left and Pollard at the non-strikers’ - 
Rayudu has no choice but to go for it, which he does. But a slower one has him 
through the shot early, spooning to long-on, where Raina takes a very handy 
tumbling catch.

19th over: Mumbai 164-4 (Pollard 29, Rayudu 10) Back comes Mohit, beginning 
with a wide, before a single brings Pollard onto strike. Mohit tries a full 
one, fifth-stump line, eliciting a swing and a miss, and then a slower one is 
absolutely caned from outside off to wide long-on, Pollard down on one knee and 
sending it whistling past a fielder barely five yards from it. Spooked, Mohit 
goes even wider, and even Pollard’s eagleacious wingspan can’t connect - that’s 
another wide - but he comes back well, extracting a little more bounce that 
forces a pull to the man at long-on.

18th over: Mumbai 156-4 (Pollard 24, Rayudu 9) Rayudu takes two and one, and 
with Pollard on strike, Bravo goes around the wicket. Another slower ball is 
duly despatched, but it’s all the same to yerman, who clouts six insanely 
higher than the sun over midwicket. He’s glimpsed, he has tasted, fantastical 
places, his soul’s an oasis. A single follows, and then the rare mistake of a 
leg-side full-toss allows Rayudu four more, thinly edged behind. 15 from the 
over, and Mumbai seriously needed that; who though to be saying that twenty 
minutes ago?

17th over: Mumbai 141-4 (Pollard 17, Rayudu 1) Not quite sure it was wise 
sending Pandya in ahead of Rayudu, but I guess if he comes off, fine, and if he 
doesn’t he’ll give it away immediately, as he did. This is superb bowling from 
Nehra, consistently full and around off-stump, and that’s just two from the 
over; does Pollard go for Bravo, or try sticking around to make sure requisite 
hammering occurs a the other end?

First ball of the over, Pandya goes, gets right underneath one and spoons to 
square-leg, where Jadeja arrives to take easily. Suddenly things have changed.

18.5 Single to Nehra. 
 
18.4 Ashwin goes to hoik over midwicket, again doesn’t middle it, only able to 
impart toe, and Rayudu steadies himself to hold.
 
18.3 Ashwin makes room and lofts down the ground, but he’s not caught it 
clean, and Pollard runs around from long-on to intercept, saving two; they run 
two.
 
18.2 Yorker length, Mohit carves to the point fence, and that’s one more. 
 
18.1 Ashwin swings, but can only get one down to long-on. Sharma needs to get 
him back on strike rapidly.
 
18th over Chennai 157-8 (Ashwin 20, Sharma 1) Target 188 McClenaghan sends 
down an unnecessary bouncer, called wide for height, but the next two balls 
yield singles. That’s nowhere near enough for Chennai, so Ashwin slams six over 
mid-on, then, rather unnecessarily, premeditates a lap, beetling towards off 
and alerting the man at point, who beetles off in pursuit and allows just a 
single.
 
Looking for another maximum, Jadeja slashes outside off, and Suchith, running 
in from the rope, leaps forwards to hold a low catch at point.
 
18th over Chennai 147-7 (Jadeja 19, Ashwin 12) Target 188 McClenaghan back, 
curtains blowing in the wind - fitting, really, given their status as the 
answer to questions of peace - and Jadeja toes his first ball for six down the 
ground, just beating the leap and backwards dive of Pollard on the fence at 
long-on.
 
17th over Chennai 141-7 (Jadeja 13, Ashwin 12) Target 188 Malinga’s full and 
straight, funnily enough, his first two balls yielding just singles. But then 
Ashwin lifts over mid-off for four; can he manage another? He cannot, nudging 
around the corner for one, and nor can Jadeja, back-cutting for the same. One 
delivery left, boundaries required - and there’s it is, Ashwin jamming the bat 
down outside off and using the pace to run down to the third man fence. Well, 
Mumbai were 141-4 at the same stage - but with Pollard at the wicket.
 
16th over Chennai 129-7 (Jadeja 10, Ashwin 2) Target 188 The pressure’s 
relaxed now, but this is still a fine over from Kumar, ceding just eight runs 
and capturing a vital wicket. Both Jadeja and Ashwin know enough about hitting 
to make this close, but there’s not even a hint of that at the moment - oh, and 
here comes Malinga.
 
Negi has no choice but to hit out, and he looking to hit over mid-off, can’t 
get under it, and picks out Chand, on for Harbhajan.
 
15th over Chennai 121-6 (Jadeja 10, Negi 0) Target 188 This is still doable, 
but someone has to something spectacular.
 
That appears to have morphed into that. Again, Jadeja pushes for two, this 
time to deep square-leg, and running to the danger end, makes it - but Bravo’s 
reticence and concern for his partner causes him a problem. He lingers, looks, 
and Parthiv is alert enough, quick enough and skilled enough to throw down the 
stumps at the bowler’s end. Meanwhile, Pollard sulks, affronted that two was 
even possible.
 
15th over Chennai 119-5 (Bravo 20, Jadeja 8) Target 188 Pollard’s back, and 
after ceding a single from his first two balls, Jadeja cuts past backward point 
for four. Then, he runs one down to third man, sprinting the first hard enough 
to get back safely; very well done.
 
14th over Chennai 110-5 (Bravo 19, Jadeja 0) Target 188 This is looking too 
much for Chennai now.
 
Seeing no option but to go at Suchith, Du Plessis comes down and clouts one, 
but Suchith has held his nerve, flighting and keeping the pace off. The ball 
goes high, and Kumar runs in to hold.
 
14th over Chennai 110-4 (Du Plessis 45, Bravo 19) Target 188 Chennai have to 
go here, particularly with two overs of Malinga to come, and Bravo mashes 
Suchith’s second ball down the ground into the upper tier. Then, looking to cut 
almost off the bounce, an edge to third man adds four.
 
13th over Chennai 95-4 (Du Plessis 45, Bravo 8) Target 188 Bhaji to continue; 
is it acceptable to call him that, likewise Faf Faf. I mean, they’re two of my 
best mates, but even so. He’s bowling nice and slowly here, teasing the batsmen 
to take him on, but they can’t or won’t - four singles from the over, and it’s 
really hard to see a way for Chennai now. That’s 2/26 for Harbhajan’s spell, 
and time for an altruistic timeout.
 
12th over Chennai 95-4 (Du Plessis 43, Bravo 6) Target 188 With Raina gone, 
Suchith comes on, and the batsmen can’t get his leggies away to begin with - 
but after three singles and a dot, Bravo whisks four to midwicket. A further 
dot follows in response, and the run rate, now 11.62, looks menacing.
 
11th over Chennai 88-4 (Du Plessis 41, Bravo 1) Target 188 What an over this 
is, what anover this almost is. Bravo whacks uppishly, and Bhaji, in his 
follow-through, should snaffle the snaffle, moving left - but he thumbs it, and 
leaves the pitch to have his hand seen to. There’s no hole in it.
 
...flicked away by Bravo. 
 
Hat-trick ball coming up ...
 
Dhoni gets a first-baller! Harbhajan’s a bit quicker than he’s expecting, he 
plays the sweep, but from middle-and-off, misses, and is plumb. That might just 
be the game - plenty of batting left, but plenty more to do!
 
Pressure tells! Aware that he needs to manufacture something, Raina goes at 
Harbhajan, thinks better of it immediately, and, defending, taps a return 
catch. All on Dhoni!
 
10th over Chennai 86-2 (Du Plessis 40, Raina 24) Target 188 Pollard’s back - 
Sharma’s keeping Suchith back hoping that the left-handed Raina will soon 
depart. Another quietish over - unlike Mumbai, who went hard all the way 
through, Chennai seem to be relying on a big finish.
 
9th over Chennai 79-2 (Du Plessis 39, Raina 20) Target 188 Faf is first to act 
with urgency, making room to hit over the top, but not getting all of it - 
little enough so that it drops well shy of long-off. They run one, and Raina 
comes down next ball, pounding six over long-on, before a single that allows 
Faf to snap four more through cover. Good over for Mumbai, 13 from it, and the 
pot is boiling. Time for a strategic ad-out!
 
8th over Chennai 67-2 (Du Plessis 34, Raina 13) Target 188 Pollard on, with 
pressure back on Chennai - they need some boundaries, but need not to lose more 
wickets. With the rate climbing above ten during the over, one of these two 
needs to go, but it’s just five singles scored; even three more like this, and 
it’ll be hard to see a way.
 
7th over Chennai 61-2 (Du Plessis 32, Raina 9) Target 188 Crucial moment in 
the game: Harbhajan into the attack. Faf works a single into the on-side, then 
a wide yields two, then another single. Bhaji’s enthusiasm and intensity is 
really something, he’s bowling as though he expects a wicket with every 
delivery, and will be relatively satisfied with ceding just seven from his 
first over.
 
6th over Chennai 54-2 (Du Plessis 29, Raina 7) Target 188 Gosh, Mumbai needed 
that. But after getting off the mark with a single and finding himself back 
down the other end when Faf nudges to square-leg, Raina anticipates a short one 
and absolutely annihilates it over long-on for six.
 
Hussey advances, wafts at a wide one, edges, and the still steaming Kumar has 
his wicket.
 
5th over Chennai 46-1 (Hussey 16, Du Plessis 28) Target 188 McClenaghan back, 
to donate Faf some width - he cuts hard, sending four hurtling to third man, 
then picks the next one up from outside off to muscle-pull four over midwicket. 
Two dots follow, but then the final ball is too straight, so summarily banished 
over square-leg. Those curtains aren’t sitting quite so proud anymore, for this 
is a fine start.
 
4th over Chennai 33-1 (Hussey 15, Du Plessis 16) Target 188 McClenaghan, 
curtains and all, are banished, and Vinay Kumar arrives into the attack. Du 
Plessis nurdles a single into the off-side, and then Hussey wallops six into 
the box that we have have to be shown numerous times a game in order to 
advertise what I believe is a soft drink. Then, after another single, Hussey 
slices to third man, where Malinga, who’s had a horrible tournament in the 
field, has bare time to watch it into his hands - but instead splits them as 
the ball arrives. Oh dear. And this is now a good start.
 
3rd over Chennai 23-1 (Hussey 8, Du Plessis 13) Target 188 Tight over from 
Malinga, a dot followed by four singles followed by a dot - but Chennai won’t 
mind. That’ll be him done until the death, so it’s time to wade in.
 
2nd over: Chennai 19-1 (Hussey 6, Du Plessis 11) Target 188 In comes 
McClenaghan, who’s had a good tournament - but he opens with two wides, then a 
short one on the pads, that MrCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> pulls around the corner for four. 
The bowler is well and truly looked at by his captain, then after a couple 
back-of-a-length, goes fuller - and Faf meets the bounce, lifting six straight 
down the ground, then pulling four off his hip. 17 from the over.
 
1st over: Chennai 2-1 (Hussey 1, Du Plessis 1) Target 188 Du Plessis off the 
mark first ball, dropping down in front of the stumps, and a misfield at 
short-fine-leg allows Hussey to break his duck from the final ball.
 
Gosh, how do you keep that out? Well, Dwayne Smith certainly doesn’t know the 
answer, trapped in front by a venomous slingshot shin-high yorker - that’s 
going miles down! You can see the stumps! Smith, on the boundary, indicates 
displeasure. Richard Ill’worth, dear oh dear.
 
The players are back out, and Malinga has the ball. Between innings, Simmons 
pointed out the need to score when it’s hard, given a relatively slow track - 
will they dare to attack from the off?
 
That’ll sit fine enough with both sides. Mumbai would’ve lapped this up at the 
start, but fancied themselves for more given how well they started; Chennai 
would’ve planned for less, feared more, and will fancy themselves to chase 
this. Or, put another way, eyes down for a thriller!
 
20th over: Mumbai 185-5 (Harbhajan 6, Suchith 1) 
 
Bravo goes wide on the off-side, Pollard heaves again, but top-edges, and 
Raina takes another steepler with expert’s ease.
 
20th over: Mumbai 185-5 (Pollard 41, Harbhajan 5) Reckoning Harbhajan is 
running whatever, Bravo has Dhoni taking a glove off to sort any run out, 
before sending down a leg-side wide. Oh, and there’s an off-side wide next, 
after which Harbhajan slashes four over point for a one-bounce four; bravo 
seems to have forgotten that he can bat, as evidenced earlier in the 
competition. Crivens, there’s another wide, and then Bhaji picks up a yorker 
which he clips to long-on - Du Plessis runs in, dives forward, and puts down 
the catch with his fingertips, while Pollard ambles down to the business end. 
My days, Pollard is something! Bravo fires into the blockhole, so obviously six 
is flicked flat over long-on!
 
19th over: Mumbai 171-5 (Pollard 35, Harbhajan 0) Pollard’s on strike - they 
ran on the wicket, a tad surprisingly - and again, Mohit is wide. Obviously, 
he’s then punished with a flat six belted over midwicket, while Dhoni 
approaches the umpire to discuss the extras.
 
Two balls of the penultimate over left and Pollard at the non-strikers’ - 
Rayudu has no choice but to go for it, which he does. But a slower one has him 
through the shot early, spooning to long-on, where Raina takes a very handy 
tumbling catch.
 
19th over: Mumbai 164-4 (Pollard 29, Rayudu 10) Back comes Mohit, beginning 
with a wide, before a single brings Pollard onto strike. Mohit tries a full 
one, fifth-stump line, eliciting a swing and a miss, and then a slower one is 
absolutely caned from outside off to wide long-on, Pollard down on one knee and 
sending it whistling past a fielder barely five yards from it. Spooked, Mohit 
goes even wider, and even Pollard’s eagleacious wingspan can’t connect - that’s 
another wide - but he comes back well, extracting a little more bounce that 
forces a pull to the man at long-on.
 
18th over: Mumbai 156-4 (Pollard 24, Rayudu 9) Rayudu takes two and one, and 
with Pollard on strike, Bravo goes around the wicket. Another slower ball is 
duly despatched, but it’s all the same to yerman, who clouts six insanely 
higher than the sun over midwicket. He’s glimpsed, he has tasted, fantastical 
places, his soul’s an oasis. A single follows, and then the rare mistake of a 
leg-side full-toss allows Rayudu four more, thinly edged behind. 15 from the 
over, and Mumbai seriously needed that; who though to be saying that twenty 
minutes ago?
 
17th over: Mumbai 141-4 (Pollard 17, Rayudu 1) Not quite sure it was wise 
sending Pandya in ahead of Rayudu, but I guess if he comes off, fine, and if he 
doesn’t he’ll give it away immediately, as he did. This is superb bowling from 
Nehra, consistently full and around off-stump, and that’s just two from the 
over; does Pollard go for Bravo, or try sticking around to make sure requisite 
hammering occurs a the other end?
 
First ball of the over, Pandya goes, gets right underneath one and spoons to 
square-leg, where Jadeja arrives to take easily. Suddenly things have changed.
