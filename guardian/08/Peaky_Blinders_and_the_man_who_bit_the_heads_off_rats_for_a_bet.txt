Like Steven Knight, the writer of Peaky Blinders (Travel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/29/steven-knight-peaky-blinders-birmingham>
, 30 April), my parents (both born 1905) and I too come from Small Heath. The 
man with the rat sounds like Tommy Tank, who my father said would do almost 
anything for a bet. Allegedly he would ask a publican to catch rats, live, from 
his cellar and put them in a sack. Tommy would bet how many rats’ heads he 
could bite off in a given time. Once he walked from Coventry to Birmingham, 
backwards and with a house brick on his head. In my family, at least, Tommy 
Tank or just Tommy were used to mean bank.

Incidentally, the Peaky Blinders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/peaky-blinders> was not just the name 
of a gang. Railwaymen from Birmingham were called peaky blinders too, according 
to Eric Partridge in his Dictionary of Slang.
