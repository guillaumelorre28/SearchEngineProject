That’s a fourth Championship century of the season for Ryan ten Doeschate, 
too. Great effort from the promoted team’s captain.

That’s the close here at Old Trafford. Light just not good enough to get back 
out. Been off for an hour and lost 28 overs.

Lancs are 102-5, 225 behind. Weather, happily, is much better tomorrow.

Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> have been bowled out for 
390, a lead of 245.

Ryan Sidebottom bowled Jack Leach, offering no shot, to secure his first 
five-for of the season before Adil Rashid had Tim Groenewald stumped.

Gregory finishes with 73 not out, and we have 22 overs left in the day.

Livingstone and Jones have played a wonderfully punchy hand in bringing up 
their 50 partnership from just 81 balls. They don’t seem at all concerned by 
the return of the big guns. It’s 84 for five.

And now Dawid Malan is coming on at the other end (the end which, humorously, 
was referred to as the AJ Bell End by Lancs’ Tom Smith on the radio yesterday). 
Simpson nearly stumped Livingstone in Rayner’s over.

Graham Hardcastle

Breakthrough for Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> on 
the stroke of tea, but it looks like it has come a bit too late. Adil Rashid 
has just trapped Craig Overton lbw in the final over of the session for 38 
having shared 101 with Lewis Gregory for the seventh wicket.

Gregory is 69 not out, a career best score, with Somerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> now 358-7 and leading by 213.

It’s a long way back for Yorkshire from here.

By the way, apologies - it’s tea here at Old Trafford. Light improved 
slightly, and it might be about to bucket it down. Radar suggesting that we are 
right on the edge of a load of rain.

Jeez, and there we were thinking this year was the return of the spinner.

Tavare was Rob Keogh's 28th Championship wicket this season - currently 8 more 
than any other spinner in Division Two

Here at Hove a little late swiping from Jordan and Steve Magoffin took Sussex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sussexccc> up to 229, so their deficit of 77 
was a great deal smaller than looked likely at one stage.

Then Magoffin, with two quick wickets, reduced Worcestershire to one for two 
in the third over, and Sussex were back in it. They have recovered to 33 for 
two right now.

I am following much more meaningful events elsewhere with a great deal of 
interest. If Somerset do manage to pull off a magnificent victory overYorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> it will really spice things up.

But if that is the case Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> 
will have to be very careful about what pitch they prepare for their last game 
against Notts.

I was at Taunton last week and Somerset were marginally fortunate to get away 
with the pitch they prepared for the Warwickshire game. It wasn’t a rank awful 
pitch, and wasn’t dangerous, but it wasn’t a four-day track either, with the 
ball turning square from the start.

I would be awful if Somerset won the championship for the first time in their 
long history and then lost it again for being docked points. Ands there is 
certain to be a liaison officer watching.

Right, the light here at Old Trafford isn’t great and there’s rain on the way, 
so the umpires have requested Steven Finn comes off. Ollie Rayner coming on, 
whichMiddlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> won’t mind at all. 
Livingstone has picked up where Buttler left off, and Lancs are 56 for five.

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> have taken the second 
new ball through Ryan Sidebottom, and Somerset have just gone beyond 300 
courtesy of a Lewis Gregory leg glance.

Gregory, with 44, and Craig Overton, 18 not out, have now added 47 to take the 
score to 304-6.

Not far away from being the last throw of the dice for Yorkshire.

Jos is gone! And it’s taken a quite brilliant catch to dismiss him. 
Roland-Jones is the bowler again, that’s his fourth, and the second strangle 
for Simpson. That’s a genuine leg glance from Buttler, he’s hit it pretty well, 
and Simpson has gone full stretch to his left and plucked it low off the 
ground. Phenomenal catch. Liam Livingstone, I presume. 32 for five.

Little counterattack on here, led by Jos, who hit two beautiful cover drives 
for four off Murtagh. 31 for four.

Time for some Finn.

Jim Allenby has reached a controlled half-century off 90 balls with six fours, 
and theSomerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> lead has gone 
beyond 100 with five wickets still in tact. They are now 257-5, an exact lead 
of 112.

Hang on, make that six down. Allenby trapped lbw by Adil Rashid. 257-6 now. 

There’ll still be some mutterings in the East Stand Long Room no doubt at 
Lancashire’s plight. I can picture it now ‘You can never trusty a Lancastrian!’

Right, I go on the phone for five minutes and we get a double-wicket over, 
which also contains six runs!

Petersen flicks Rojo down to fine-leg for four, and then is strangled down the 
legside next ball. He doesn’t think he’s hit it, and goes off in a right old 
huff.

Then Rojo pitches one up, right up, at Croft and his stumps are splattered. Mr 
Jos Buttler, the England captain, comes in, and flicks his first ball through 
midwicket for 2 to make it 8-4.

So, that would be 11 wickets for 77 runs here today ...

Ryan Sidebottom has struck again, getting Peter Trego caught behind with one 
which angled across the right-hander and he pushed at defensively.

Trego has fallen for a useful 46, ending a 64-run stand with Jim Allenby, as 
Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> slip to 228-5. They lead 
by 83.

Massive.

It’s been a relentless start by Middlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex>, with three maidens. Rojo had 
been causing Hameed some issues with his extremely tight line outside off 
stump, and now he’s got one to just get a touch big, and he’s edged to second 
slip, where Ollie Rayner does not drop them. That’s the second duck of Hameed’s 
first class career.

Procter takes a single and it is one for one. Rain on the way about 4pm, I’m 
told.

I can't tell you hard it is raining in Manchester. I think we should call it a 
night! Until the morning, folks...
 
That’s a fourth Championship century of the season for Ryan ten Doeschate, 
too. Great effort from the promoted team’s captain.
 
That’s the close here at Old Trafford. Light just not good enough to get back 
out. Been off for an hour and lost 28 overs.

Lancs are 102-5, 225 behind. Weather, happily, is much better tomorrow.
 
Now Onions gets Roy at the Riverside and two Currans are batting together! Two 
wickets in two overs for Durham with the new ball.
 
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> on the rack here. 
Andrew Gale has been bowled by Groenewald and they are three down for 47.

 
Ten Doeschate moves Essex to 250 for six, and they pick up a second batting 
point, which is enough to win Division Two and seal promotion. Congrats.

Murtagh returning because the light has improved. Livingstone carted Rayner 
for four in the last over.
 
And now Dawid Malan is coming on at the other end (the end which, humorously, 
was referred to as the AJ Bell End by Lancs’ Tom Smith on the radio yesterday). 
Simpson nearly stumped Livingstone in Rayner’s over.
 
Breakthrough for Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> on 
the stroke of tea, but it looks like it has come a bit too late. Adil Rashid 
has just trapped Craig Overton lbw in the final over of the session for 38 
having shared 101 with Lewis Gregory for the seventh wicket.

Gregory is 69 not out, a career best score, with Somerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> now 358-7 and leading by 213.

It’s a long way back for Yorkshire from here.

We are off for bad light. It’s worse than it was when we went off yesterday. 
57 for five. 13 overs scheduled before tea.
 
Here at Hove a little late swiping from Jordan and Steve Magoffin took Sussex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sussexccc> up to 229, so their deficit of 77 
was a great deal smaller than looked likely at one stage.

Then Magoffin, with two quick wickets, reduced Worcestershire to one for two 
in the third over, and Sussex were back in it. They have recovered to 33 for 
two right now.

I am following much more meaningful events elsewhere with a great deal of 
interest. If Somerset do manage to pull off a magnificent victory overYorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> it will really spice things up.

But if that is the case Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> 
will have to be very careful about what pitch they prepare for their last game 
against Notts.

I was at Taunton last week and Somerset were marginally fortunate to get away 
with the pitch they prepared for the Warwickshire game. It wasn’t a rank awful 
pitch, and wasn’t dangerous, but it wasn’t a four-day track either, with the 
ball turning square from the start.

I would be awful if Somerset won the championship for the first time in their 
long history and then lost it again for being docked points. Ands there is 
certain to be a liaison officer watching.
 
Right, the light here at Old Trafford isn’t great and there’s rain on the way, 
so the umpires have requested Steven Finn comes off. Ollie Rayner coming on, 
whichMiddlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> won’t mind at all. 
Livingstone has picked up where Buttler left off, and Lancs are 56 for five.
 
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> have taken the second 
new ball through Ryan Sidebottom, and Somerset have just gone beyond 300 
courtesy of a Lewis Gregory leg glance.

Gregory, with 44, and Craig Overton, 18 not out, have now added 47 to take the 
score to 304-6.

Not far away from being the last throw of the dice for Yorkshire. 
 
What a catch this is.

Jos is gone! And it’s taken a quite brilliant catch to dismiss him. 
Roland-Jones is the bowler again, that’s his fourth, and the second strangle 
for Simpson. That’s a genuine leg glance from Buttler, he’s hit it pretty well, 
and Simpson has gone full stretch to his left and plucked it low off the 
ground. Phenomenal catch. Liam Livingstone, I presume. 32 for five.
 
Little counterattack on here, led by Jos, who hit two beautiful cover drives 
for four off Murtagh. 31 for four.

Time for some Finn.
 
Jim Allenby has reached a controlled half-century off 90 balls with six fours, 
and theSomerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> lead has gone 
beyond 100 with five wickets still in tact. They are now 257-5, an exact lead 
of 112.

Hang on, make that six down. Allenby trapped lbw by Adil Rashid. 257-6 now. 

There’ll still be some mutterings in the East Stand Long Room no doubt at 
Lancashire’s plight. I can picture it now ‘You can never trusty a Lancastrian!’

Right, I go on the phone for five minutes and we get a double-wicket over, 
which also contains six runs!

Petersen flicks Rojo down to fine-leg for four, and then is strangled down the 
legside next ball. He doesn’t think he’s hit it, and goes off in a right old 
huff.

Then Rojo pitches one up, right up, at Croft and his stumps are splattered. Mr 
Jos Buttler, the England captain, comes in, and flicks his first ball through 
midwicket for 2 to make it 8-4.

So, that would be 11 wickets for 77 runs here today ...

Here’s the Hameed wicket. Some ball.

Ryan Sidebottom has struck again, getting Peter Trego caught behind with one 
which angled across the right-hander and he pushed at defensively.

Trego has fallen for a useful 46, ending a 64-run stand with Jim Allenby, as 
Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> slip to 228-5. They lead 
by 83.
 
Massive.

It’s been a relentless start by Middlesex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex>, with three maidens. Rojo had 
been causing Hameed some issues with his extremely tight line outside off 
stump, and now he’s got one to just get a touch big, and he’s edged to second 
slip, where Ollie Rayner does not drop them. That’s the second duck of Hameed’s 
first class career.

Procter takes a single and it is one for one. Rain on the way about 4pm, I’m 
told.
 
The Lancashire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> youngsters, Rob 
Jones and Haseeb Hameed, have ambled out to have a bat.
