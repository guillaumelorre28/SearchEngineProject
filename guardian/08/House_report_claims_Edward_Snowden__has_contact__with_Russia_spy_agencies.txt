Edward Snowden <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden> “has had 
and continues to have contact” with Russian intelligence services since 
arriving in Moscow three years ago, newly declassified portions of a 
congressional report released on Thursday claim.

The House intelligence committee released the declassified portions to provide 
what the panel’s chairman called “a fuller account of Edward Snowden’s crimes 
and the reckless disregard he has shown for US national security”.

The report is highly critical of Snowden, the former NSA contractor who 
revealed the scale <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files> of the 
NSA’s surveillance program, claiming that he did not attempt to communicate his 
concerns to his supervisors before providing the Guardian with top-secret NSA 
documents.

However, the report’s credibility was immediately condemned by Snowden’s 
lawyer Ben Wizner. He dismissed the report and insisted that Snowden acted to 
inform the public.

“The House committee spent three years and millions of dollars in a failed 
attempt to discredit Edward Snowden, whose actions led to the most significant 
intelligence reforms in a generation,” Wizner said. “The report wholly ignores 
Snowden’s repeated and courageous criticism of Russian surveillance and 
censorship laws. It combines demonstrable falsehoods with deceptive inferences 
to paint an entirely fictional portrait of an American whistleblower.”

The political motivation of the report was called into question in September 
when a four-page executive summary was released on the eve of the premiere of 
Oliver Stone’s biopic on the whistleblower, claiming that Snowden “damaged” 
national security, without providing evidence to support the claim.

Barton Gellman, the three-time Pulitzer prize winner who used Edward Snowden’s 
disclosures in his reporting on the NSA while at the Washington Post,dismantled 
the report’s claims 
<https://tcf.org/content/commentary/house-intelligence-committees-terrible-horrible-bad-snowden-report/>
 when the executive summary was published, calling it “aggressively dishonest” 
and “trifling”.

On Thursday as the declassified portions of the report were published in full, 
Snowden, the former national security whistleblower, pushed back further 
against the accusations in a series of tweets.

“Unsurprising that HPSCI’s report is rifled with obvious falsehoods. The only 
surprise is how accidentally exonerating it is,”Snowden tweeted

After three years of investigation and millions of dollars, they can present 
no evidence of harmful intent, foreign influence, or harm. Wow.

The panel’s top Republican and Democrat joined in castigating Snowden, who in 
2013 revealed US government efforts to hack into the data pipelines used by US 
companies to serve customers overseas. The programs collected the telephone 
metadata records of millions of Americans and examined emails from overseas.

Snowden subsequently fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid 
prosecution, after his disclosures triggered international outrage over the 
reach of US spy operations.

The report pointed to statements in June 2016 by the deputy chairman of the 
defense and security committee in the Russian parliament’s upper house, who 
asserted that “Snowden did share intelligence” with the Russian government.


The Pentagon found 13 undisclosed “high risk” security issues caused by 
Snowden’s disclosure to media outlets, including the Guardian, of tens of 
thousands of the US eavesdropping agency’s most sensitive documents, according 
to the congressional inquiry.


If the Chinese or Russians obtained access to materials related to these 
issues, “American troops will be at greater risk in any future conflict,” the 
report said.

The committee chairman, the Republican congressman Devin Nunes, said it “will 
take a long time to mitigate the damage” Snowden allegedly caused.

The committee’s top Democrat, Adam Schiff of California, said Snowden was not 
a whistleblower as he and his defenders claim. “Most of the material he stole 
had nothing to do with Americans’ privacy, and its compromise has been of great 
value to America’s adversaries and those who mean to do America harm,” Schiff 
said.

But on Twitter <https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/811983058790445057>, 
Snowden added that the report itself admitted that he “purged and abandoned” 
hard drives containing the material, rather than bring them to Russia.

Bottom line: this report's core claims are made without evidence, and are 
often contrary to both common sense and the public record.

Release of the report comes as the intelligence community has accused Russia 
of interfering in the US elections.

Snowden’s supporters have pressed Barack Obama to pardon him 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/edward-snowden-pardon-bernie-sanders-daniel-ellsberg>
 before he leaves office in late January. But the details in the intelligence 
committee’s report, coupled with the intense focus on Russia’s hacking of 
Democratic emails, could doom the push for a pardon.
