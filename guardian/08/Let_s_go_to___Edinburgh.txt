No need to explain why. It’s nearly New Year’s Eve – sorry, Hogmanay
Not just any Hogmanay. This is the culmination of Homecoming Scotland 
<http://www.visitscotland.com/see-do/homecoming-scotland-2014/>, a year-long 
extravaganza, so the party will be bigger and better than ever.

So what’s going on?
The annual torchlight procession is on 30 December. On NYE, the Concert in the 
Gardens is to be headlined by Lily Allen; the World Famous Street Party 
features Mercury winners Young Fathers and Hot Dub Time Machine (playing a song 
a year from 1954); and the Keilidh on the Mound is a modern take on traditional 
music. Fireworks go off on the hour from 9pm, and the midnight display is truly 
spectacular.

Where should I nurse my hangover?
No time for that! Clear your head with a New Year’s Day dip in the Forth, AKA 
theQueensferry Loony Dook 
<http://www.edinburghshogmanay.org/events/the-loony-dook>. Then head to 
Scot:Lands – 11 “worlds” in beautiful buildings and outdoor spaces in the Old 
Town (free but registration essential; all tickets atedinburghshogmanay.org 
<http://www.edinburghshogmanay.org/buy-tickets>).

OK, a hair of the dog, then?
There are loads of newcomers. Try gin at the Summerhall Distillery 
<http://www.pickeringsgin.com/> or Heads & Tales 
<http://www.headsandtalesbar.com/>, whisky at Devil’s Advocate 
<http://devilsadvocateedinburgh.co.uk/>, or cocktails at Blackbird 
<http://theblackbirdedinburgh.co.uk/> ​or Panda & Sons 
<http://pandaandsons.com/>. For something more traditional, try the Abbotsford 
<http://www.theabbotsford.com/index.htm>, a sumptuous Edwardian pub.

I’d better have something to eat …
Aizle <http://aizle.co.uk/> has no menu, just a list of ingredients. You cross 
off things you don’t like, and the chef works his magic. This month’s produce 
includes trout, wild venison and winter truffle (four courses £35).

And staggering back?
Motel One, a German boutique chain, opened its second hotel in Edinburgh this 
year.Motel One Edinburgh-Princes  
<http://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/edinburgh/edinburgh-princes/>has a “royal” 
theme, doubles from £69 – and availability over Hogmanay.

Do I need a car?
There are three National Tourist Routes to Edinburgh (from Fife, Stirling and 
the Borders), which make for a scenic drive. By train, it is 50 minutes from 
Glasgow and about two hours from York, Newcastle, Inverness and Aberdeen. The 
fastest route from London takes less than five hours, or you can take the 
Caledonian Sleeper. There are free night buses in Edinburgh and the Lothians on 
NYE.
