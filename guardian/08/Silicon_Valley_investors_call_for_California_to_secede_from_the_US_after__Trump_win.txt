As Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>’s shock 
election victory reverberated around Silicon Valley late on Tuesday night, some 
high-profile technologists were already calling for California to secede from 
the United States.

The broader west coast is a stronghold for the Democrats, and significantly 
more politically progressive and racially diverse than large swathes of central 
US.California <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california> is also the 
biggest economy in the US and the sixth largest in the world with a gross state 
product of $2.496tn for 2015, according to the IMF.

The campaign for independence – variously dubbed Calexit, Califrexit and 
Caleavefornia – has been regarded as a fringe movement. But support was 
revitalized by influential Uber investor and Hyperloop co-founder Shervin 
Pishevar, in a series of tweets announcing his plans to fund a “legitimate 
campaign for California to become its own nation” – posted even before the full 
results were in.

A few hours later, Hillary Clinton conceded the election to Trump, and 
Pishevar told CNBC that he wasserious about Calexit 
<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/shervin-pishevar-wants-to-help-california-secede-from-the-us.html>
. “It’s the most patriotic thing I can do,” he said, adding that the resulting 
nation would be called New California.

“We can re-enter the union after California becomes a nation. As the sixth 
largest economy in the world, the economic engine of the nation and provider of 
a large percentage of the federal budget, California carries a lot of weight,” 
he said.


Pishevar was supported by others in Silicon Valley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley>. Angel investor Jason 
Calacanis said that California succession would be simple in the wake of both 
Brexit and a Trump win.

If Trump can win, & after the #brexit 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/brexit?src=hash>, California succession would be a 
layup. CA is increasingly more distinct from America.#calexit

Evan Low, a Democrat serving in the California state assembly, said that he’d 
support the introduction of a bill to start the independence process.

In the disastrous case that @realDonaldTrump

Pishevar’s comments add weight to the Yes California campaign, which launched 
in late 2015 calling to create a free, independent California Republic. Led by 
political activist Louis Marinelli, Yes California proposes a 2019 referendum, 
following the model adopted byCatalonia to gain independence from Spain

They said Donald Trump wouldn't happen. They said #Brexit 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash> wouldn't happen. What're you 
going to say if they tell you#Calexit

The proposal illustrates the technology industry’s frustration with Trump over 
his repeated criticisms of Silicon Valley companies. The Republican leader wants
Apple to stop making phones in China

, thinksJeff Bezos bought the Washington Post to exert political power 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/20/jeff-bezos-donald-trump-criticism-amazon-blue-origin>
 and avoid paying taxes, and claimed that Mark Zuckerberg’s push for specialist 
immigration would actuallydecrease opportunities

 for American women and minorities.

Over the summer, 100 tech leaders signed an open letter warning that Trump 
would be “a disaster for innovation

” and many others, including Bezos, havespoken out about his behaviour

.

Trump’s lone public supporter in Silicon Valley was Facebook board member and 
PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel, and even he acknowledged that the country faced 
an enormous challenge. “We’re going to need all hands on deck,” he said in a
statement to USA Today 
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/11/09/peter-thiel-congratulates-trump-we-have-work-do/93532818/>
. “He has an awesomely difficult task, since it is long past time for us to 
face up to our country’s problems.”
