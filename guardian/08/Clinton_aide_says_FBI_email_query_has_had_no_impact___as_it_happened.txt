 * Clinton campaign officials have dismissed a poll suggesting that Donald 
Trump may have taken the lead in the final days before Tuesday’s election, 
insistingthey see no evidence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/donald-trump-polls-lead-hillary-clinton-campaign>
 of a negative impact from Friday’s new FBI email disclosures.

 * House speaker Paul Ryan has repaid Donald Trump for months of acrimony 
<https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/785530928256933888> - including a 
refusal to endorse Ryan - by voting for him. In a continuation of the weird 
Republican quirk this cycle of not naming Trump, Ryan told Fox & Friends that 
he had voted for “our nominee.” 
 * Speaking in Dade City, Florida, former beauty queen Alicia Machado 
introduced Hillary Clinton by describing her interactions with Trump during her 
reign as Miss Universe 1996. “I was only 18 years old - a little girl,” Machado 
said. “There was still so much I didn’t know. Trump was overwhelming. I was 
scared of him. He made fun of me, and I didn’t know how to respond. He told me 
that I looked ugly, and I was massive. He even called me names. He said to me, 
‘Miss Piggy,’ ‘Miss Housekeeping,’ ‘Miss Eating Machine.’ Soon, it became a 
joke. Alicia Machado was the Fat Miss Universe. It was really painful for me. 
He was cruel.”

 * With the presidential election one week away, a handful of Republicans are 
already vowing to oppose any nominee to the supreme court proposed by Hillary 
Clinton should she be elected. At least three Republican senators - Ted Cruz of 
Texas, Richard Burr of North Carolina and John McCain of Arizona - have voiced 
support for indefinitely blocking Clinton from filling the supreme court 
vacancy left by the late justice Antonin Scalia.

 * Hundreds of the world’s most respected economists, including eight Nobel 
laureates, havesigned and published a letter 
<http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/EconomistLetter11012016.pdf> 
urging US voters not to support Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, 
calling Trump a “dangerous, destructive choice” who would doom the country to 
recession, or worse.

 * Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson, who is expected to cruise to reelection 
victory in next week’s election despite fellow Republican Donald Trump’s 
underwater polling numbers in the state,told the Beloit Daily News 
<http://m.beloitdailynews.com/mobile/news/johnson-clinton-could-be-impeached/article_e6451d9c-a03c-11e6-b059-e3910e7e9427.html>
 that Hillary Clinton’s use of private email servers are impeachable offenses.

Cybersecurity firm fails to find links between Donald Trump and Russian bank

Julian Borger

A US cybersecurity firm hired by a Russian bank to investigate allegations of 
a secret line of communication with the Trump Organization said on Tuesday 
there was no evidence so far of substantive contact, email or financial links.


Mandiant, which is owned by the California-based company FireEye, said it 
examined internet server logs presented to the bank by media organisations 
investigating the link.

The online magazine Slate published a story  
<http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html>
on Monday about communication between a server hosting Trump domain addresses 
and a server owned by the Moscow-based Alfa Bank, owned by two oligarchs, 
Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven. Aven worked with Vladimir Putin in city 
government in St Petersburg in the early 1990s.

The Slate story, quoting a range of cybersecurity experts, said the 
communication between the servers suggested it was human rather than robotic, 
and that it was intended to be secret and exclusive.


In a statement, FireEye said it had been presented with a log of the 
communication between the servers over a period of 90 days, listing the 
separate contacts.

“The information presented is inconclusive and is not evidence of substantive 
contact or a direct email or financial link between Alfa Bank and the Trump 
campaign or Organization,” the statement said. “The list presented does not 
contain enough information to show that there has been any actual activity 
opposed to simple DNS lookups, which can come from a variety of sources 
including anti-spam and other security software.”

The statement continued: “As part of the ongoing investigation, Alfa Bank has 
opened its IT systems to Mandiant, which has investigated both remotely and on 
the ground in Moscow. We are continuing our investigation. Nothing we have or 
have found alters our view as described above that there isn’t evidence of 
substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between Alfa Bank and 
the Trump campaign or Organization.”

George P. Bush, the Texas land commissioner better known as the son of Jeb

the only member of the storied political clan to vote forDonald Trump

upcoming election:
Lisa Lerer (@llerer) 
George P. Bush tells @apwillweissert <https://twitter.com/apwillweissert> that 
he's the only Bush to vote the GOP ticket. Both 41 & 43 "potentially" may go 
for Clinton, he says

<https://twitter.com/llerer/status/793619447068188672> 
(“41” and “43” refer to George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, respectively, who 
served as the 41st and 43rd presidents.)

Asked if either could vote for Clinton, Bush told the Associated Press: 
“Potentially. But hard to speculate.”

From Donald Trump’s press pool:

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> finished his 
speech at 6:54 CDT, pausing near the end as his audience erupted in a chant of 
“President Trump! President Trump!”

Pool left at 6:59 in the van, joining Mr. Trump’s motorcade for a ride to the 
airport and a 3-hour flight to Miami, FL.

Tonight’s speech was steady, and lacking in the off-the-cuff departures that 
tend to characterize his rallies. In your pooler’s humble opinion, Trump has 
not stayed this “on message” in any other public rally since the Republican 
National Convention.

Your pooler would bet an expensive lunch that he diverted very little from his 
prepared remarks.

US senator: Hillary Clinton could be impeached if elected

Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson, who is expected to cruise to reelection victory 
in next week’s election despite fellow Republican Donald Trump’s underwater 
polling numbers in the state,told the Beloit Daily News 
<http://m.beloitdailynews.com/mobile/news/johnson-clinton-could-be-impeached/article_e6451d9c-a03c-11e6-b059-e3910e7e9427.html>
 that Hillary Clinton’s use of private email servers are impeachable offenses.

“She purposefully circumvented [the law], this was willful concealment and 
destruction,” Johnson said. “I’m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written. I 
would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both 
laws.”

Johnson referred to two laws regarding the willful destruction or removal from 
proper custody of information relating to the national defense, the punishment 
for which includes fines and the forfeiture of holding elected office.

Johnson dismissed the conclusion by the FBI that Clinton did not break the law.

“That was a corrupt conclusion,” Johnson said.


“Every election is a binary choice, but she has disqualified herself,” Johnson 
said of Clinton. “I would love to be voting for Ronald Reagan, and I’m sure the
Democrats <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> would rather be 
voting for Harry Truman, but the reality is that is not our choice.”

370 prominent economists: Don't vote for Donald Trump

Hundreds of the world’s most respected economists, including eight Nobel 
laureates, havesigned and published a letter 
<http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/EconomistLetter11012016.pdf> 
urging US voters not to support Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, 
calling Trump a “dangerous, destructive choice” who would doom the country to 
recession, or worse.

“Donald Trump is a dangerous, destructive choice for the country,” the letter 
asserts, after listing off more than a dozen reasons for voters to support a 
different candidate. “He misinforms the electorate, degrades trust in public 
institutions with conspiracy theories, and promotes willful delusion over 
engagement with reality. If elected, he poses a unique danger to the 
functioning of democratic and economic institutions, and to the prosperity of 
the country. For these reasons, we strongly recommend that you do not vote for
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.”

The letter’s 370 signatories, which include Oliver Hart of Harvard University, 
one of the two Nobel winners in economics this year, and Paul Romer, the chief 
economist at the World Bank, accuse Trump of, in order:

 * Degrading trust in “vital public institutions that collect and disseminate 
information about the economy,” including the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 * Misleading voters “by asserting that the renegotiation of Nafta or the 
imposition of tariffs on China would substantially increase employment in 
manufacturing.” 
 * Trump “has diverted the policy discussion to options that ignore both the 
reality of technological progress and the benefits of international trade.” 
 * He “has misled the public by asserting that US manufacturing has declined.”

 * Falsely suggesting that “the ‘toughness’ of negotiators primarily drives 
trade deficits.” 
 * Misleading American voters with “false statements about trade agreements 
eroding national income and wealth.” 
 * “Lowering the seriousness” of public discussions of the national debt and 
deficits by suggesting that eliminating “the Environmental Protection Agency or 
the Department of Education would significantly reduce the fiscal deficit.” 
 * “He claims he will eliminate the fiscal deficit, but has proposed a plan 
that would decrease tax revenue by $2.6 to $5.9 trillion over the next decade 
according to the non-partisan Tax Foundation.” 
 * Proposing “a reduction in public saving that is likely to increase” the US 
trade deficit. 
 * Using immigration as “a red herring to mislead voters about issues of 
economic importance.” 
 * Misleading the electorate by declaring that “the US is one of the most 
heavily taxed countries.” 
“His statements reveal a deep ignorance of economics and an inability to 
listen to credible experts,” the letter’s signatories conclude. “He repeats 
fake and misleading economic statistics, and pushes fallacies about the VAT and 
trade competitiveness. He promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories 
over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options.”

Election polls tighten – but turnout is the real key to Clinton v Trump

Mona Chalabi

Polls are often conducted over multiple days, so we’re only just starting to 
measure the effect of the FBI’s decision torelease new details 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation>
 of its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server to lawmakers 
on Friday. According to the ABC/Washington Post trackingpoll 
<http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a102016ElectionTrackingNo10.pdf>
 published on Tuesday (conducted October 27-30), the Democratic candidate has 
now slipped behind Donald Trump, on 45% to her Republican opponent’s 46%. The 
pollingaverage 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html>
 calculated by RealClearPolitics, a much better indication of national 
sentiment, shows Clinton is now leading by just 2 percentage points, down from 
5 percentage points a week ago.

Those numbers are interesting but not necessarily indicative – polling won’t 
neatly translate to votes. Far more important will be theturnout 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/oct/29/voter-turnout-us-election-2016-register>
 - especially since the two leading presidential candidates are soclose in 
terms of unpopularity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity>
. And the candidates know it. A senior adviser to Donald Trump reportedly
revealed 
<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303034-trump-aide-we-have-three-major-voter-suppression>
 last week that “we have three major voter suppression operations under way” 
intended to reduce votes for Clinton among African Americans, white liberals 
and young women.


Even though election day is still a week away, we already have some clues 
about whether turnout is lower among those groups – because more than25m 
<http://www.electproject.org/early_2016> ballots have already been cast under 
the US early voting system. Approximately 125 million to 145 million Americans 
arepredicted 
<https://www.predictit.org/Market/2188/What-will-be-2016-voter-turnout-for-the-presidential-election>
 to vote in the 2016 election, so those early votes represent a significant 
share of the expected total.

Higher turnout than at this time in 2012

Of the 15 states that provide detailed information about those ballots, North 
Carolina, California and nine other states reportmore 
<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/31/us/elections/earlyvoters.html?_r=0>
 early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election. Ohio, Nevada, 
Colorado and Iowa showed a decline in early voting, and those declines were 
small.

Early signs of declining turnout from black voters and young voters

The early results offer mixed news for Clinton. Early votes suggest that young 
voters – who are muchmore likely 
<http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/> 
than older voters to lean Democratic – might be staying at home. In 12 states, 
fewer Americans aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election 
compared with this point in 2012. This could be especially problematic for 
Clinton if this group is indicative of a broader “Bernie or bust 
<https://www.facebook.com/groups/1031867576877207/>” sentiment in which 
supporters of the former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders choose to stay at 
home rather than voting for Clinton.


Young voters aren’t the only demographic group that appears put off. Early 
votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states – especially in 
North Carolina, a state that yields15 of the 270 
<https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html> 
electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests 
Clinton is in aclose contest 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html>
. If Trump’s strategy is indeed to suppress the black vote, that makes a lot of 
sense – those voters could be crucial for Clinton to secure the White House.

Speaking in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Donald Trump predicted “an unprecedented 
constitutional crisis” ifHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> were to be elected 
president.

“The work of government would come to an unbelievably unglorious halt,” Trump 
said, and “she is likely to be investigated for years, likely to be concluded 
with a very large-scale criminal trial.”

The audience chanted “Lock her up!” in response.

“This is a message for any Democratic voter who have already cast their ballot 
for Hillary Clinton and have a severe case of buyer’s remorse,” Trump said, 
referring to a few states - Wisconsin included - where early ballots can be 
reversed before election day. “A lot of stuff has come out since you’ve voted.”

“You can change your vote to Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> - we’ll make America great 
again, okay? She will never make America great.”

Speaking in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> greeted the audience by 
declaring that “in one week, we are going to win the great state of Wisconsin.”

Lauding the state’s governor, Scott Walker, as “one tough cookie,” Trump moved 
swiftly past local flavor for a casual listing of polls (valid or otherwise) 
that show him surging in battleground states.

“We’re on the cusp of something incredible. Historic change that transfers 
power from a failed political establishment,” Trump said.

 * Clinton campaign officials have dismissed a poll suggesting that Donald 
Trump may have taken the lead in the final days before Tuesday’s election, 
insistingthey see no evidence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/donald-trump-polls-lead-hillary-clinton-campaign>
 of a negative impact from Friday’s new FBI email disclosures.

 * House speaker Paul Ryan has repaid Donald Trump for months of acrimony 
<https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/785530928256933888> - including a 
refusal to endorse Ryan - by voting for him. In a continuation of the weird 
Republican quirk this cycle of not naming Trump, Ryan told Fox & Friends that 
he had voted for “our nominee.” 
 * Speaking in Dade City, Florida, former beauty queen Alicia Machado 
introduced Hillary Clinton by describing her interactions with Trump during her 
reign as Miss Universe 1996. “I was only 18 years old - a little girl,” Machado 
said. “There was still so much I didn’t know. Trump was overwhelming. I was 
scared of him. He made fun of me, and I didn’t know how to respond. He told me 
that I looked ugly, and I was massive. He even called me names. He said to me, 
‘Miss Piggy,’ ‘Miss Housekeeping,’ ‘Miss Eating Machine.’ Soon, it became a 
joke. Alicia Machado was the Fat Miss Universe. It was really painful for me. 
He was cruel.”

 * With the presidential election one week away, a handful of Republicans are 
already vowing to oppose any nominee to the supreme court proposed by Hillary 
Clinton should she be elected. At least three Republican senators - Ted Cruz of 
Texas, Richard Burr of North Carolina and John McCain of Arizona - have voiced 
support for indefinitely blocking Clinton from filling the supreme court 
vacancy left by the late justice Antonin Scalia.

 * Hundreds of the world’s most respected economists, including eight Nobel 
laureates, havesigned and published a letter 
<http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/EconomistLetter11012016.pdf> 
urging US voters not to support Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, 
calling Trump a “dangerous, destructive choice” who would doom the country to 
recession, or worse.

victory in next week’s election despite fellow Republican Donald Trump’s 
underwater polling numbers in the state,told the Beloit Daily News

Donald Trump’s campaign responds to the endorsement of Trump by a KKK newspaper
 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/01/the-kkks-official-newspaper-has-endorsed-donald-trump-for-president/?postshare=1941478049345653&tid=ss_tw>
:

The Trump campaign responded with criticism of the article. Mr. Trump and the 
campaign denounces hate in any form. This publication is repulsive and their 
views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind 
our campaign.
 
A US cybersecurity firm hired by a Russian bank to investigate allegations of 
a secret line of communication with the Trump Organization said on Tuesday 
there was no evidence so far of substantive contact, email or financial links.


Mandiant, which is owned by the California-based company FireEye, said it 
examined internet server logs presented to the bank by media organisations 
investigating the link.

The online magazine Slate published a story  
<http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html>
on Monday about communication between a server hosting Trump domain addresses 
and a server owned by the Moscow-based Alfa Bank, owned by two oligarchs, 
Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven. Aven worked with Vladimir Putin in city 
government in St Petersburg in the early 1990s.

The Slate story, quoting a range of cybersecurity experts, said the 
communication between the servers suggested it was human rather than robotic, 
and that it was intended to be secret and exclusive.


In a statement, FireEye said it had been presented with a log of the 
communication between the servers over a period of 90 days, listing the 
separate contacts.

“The information presented is inconclusive and is not evidence of substantive 
contact or a direct email or financial link between Alfa Bank and the Trump 
campaign or Organization,” the statement said. “The list presented does not 
contain enough information to show that there has been any actual activity 
opposed to simple DNS lookups, which can come from a variety of sources 
including anti-spam and other security software.”

The statement continued: “As part of the ongoing investigation, Alfa Bank has 
opened its IT systems to Mandiant, which has investigated both remotely and on 
the ground in Moscow. We are continuing our investigation. Nothing we have or 
have found alters our view as described above that there isn’t evidence of 
substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between Alfa Bank and 
the Trump campaign or Organization.”

George P. Bush, the Texas land commissioner better known as the son of Jeb 
Bush and nephew of George W. Bush, told the Associated Press today that he’s 
the only member of the storied political clan to vote forDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and Mike Pence in the 
upcoming election:
Lisa Lerer (@llerer) 
George P. Bush tells @apwillweissert <https://twitter.com/apwillweissert> that 
he's the only Bush to vote the GOP ticket. Both 41 & 43 "potentially" may go 
for Clinton, he says
 <https://twitter.com/llerer/status/793619447068188672> November 2, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/llerer/status/793619447068188672> 
(“41” and “43” refer to George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, respectively, who 
served as the 41st and 43rd presidents.)

Asked if either could vote for Clinton, Bush told the Associated Press: 
“Potentially. But hard to speculate.”
 
From Donald Trump’s press pool:

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> finished his 
speech at 6:54 CDT, pausing near the end as his audience erupted in a chant of 
“President Trump! President Trump!”

Pool left at 6:59 in the van, joining Mr. Trump’s motorcade for a ride to the 
airport and a 3-hour flight to Miami, FL.

Tonight’s speech was steady, and lacking in the off-the-cuff departures that 
tend to characterize his rallies. In your pooler’s humble opinion, Trump has 
not stayed this “on message” in any other public rally since the Republican 
National Convention.

Your pooler would bet an expensive lunch that he diverted very little from his 
prepared remarks.
 
Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson, who is expected to cruise to reelection victory 
in next week’s election despite fellow Republican Donald Trump’s underwater 
polling numbers in the state,told the Beloit Daily News 
<http://m.beloitdailynews.com/mobile/news/johnson-clinton-could-be-impeached/article_e6451d9c-a03c-11e6-b059-e3910e7e9427.html>
 that Hillary Clinton’s use of private email servers are impeachable offenses.

“She purposefully circumvented [the law], this was willful concealment and 
destruction,” Johnson said. “I’m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written. I 
would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both 
laws.”

Johnson referred to two laws regarding the willful destruction or removal from 
proper custody of information relating to the national defense, the punishment 
for which includes fines and the forfeiture of holding elected office.

Johnson dismissed the conclusion by the FBI that Clinton did not break the law.

“That was a corrupt conclusion,” Johnson said.


“Every election is a binary choice, but she has disqualified herself,” Johnson 
said of Clinton. “I would love to be voting for Ronald Reagan, and I’m sure the
Democrats <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> would rather be 
voting for Harry Truman, but the reality is that is not our choice.”
 
Hundreds of the world’s most respected economists, including eight Nobel 
laureates, havesigned and published a letter 
<http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/EconomistLetter11012016.pdf> 
urging US voters not to support Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, 
calling Trump a “dangerous, destructive choice” who would doom the country to 
recession, or worse.

“Donald Trump is a dangerous, destructive choice for the country,” the letter 
asserts, after listing off more than a dozen reasons for voters to support a 
different candidate. “He misinforms the electorate, degrades trust in public 
institutions with conspiracy theories, and promotes willful delusion over 
engagement with reality. If elected, he poses a unique danger to the 
functioning of democratic and economic institutions, and to the prosperity of 
the country. For these reasons, we strongly recommend that you do not vote for
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.”

The letter’s 370 signatories, which include Oliver Hart of Harvard University, 
one of the two Nobel winners in economics this year, and Paul Romer, the chief 
economist at the World Bank, accuse Trump of, in order:

 * Degrading trust in “vital public institutions that collect and disseminate 
information about the economy,” including the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 * Misleading voters “by asserting that the renegotiation of Nafta or the 
imposition of tariffs on China would substantially increase employment in 
manufacturing.” 
 * Trump “has diverted the policy discussion to options that ignore both the 
reality of technological progress and the benefits of international trade.” 
 * He “has misled the public by asserting that US manufacturing has declined.”

 * Falsely suggesting that “the ‘toughness’ of negotiators primarily drives 
trade deficits.” 
 * Misleading American voters with “false statements about trade agreements 
eroding national income and wealth.” 
 * “Lowering the seriousness” of public discussions of the national debt and 
deficits by suggesting that eliminating “the Environmental Protection Agency or 
the Department of Education would significantly reduce the fiscal deficit.” 
 * “He claims he will eliminate the fiscal deficit, but has proposed a plan 
that would decrease tax revenue by $2.6 to $5.9 trillion over the next decade 
according to the non-partisan Tax Foundation.” 
 * Proposing “a reduction in public saving that is likely to increase” the US 
trade deficit. 
 * Using immigration as “a red herring to mislead voters about issues of 
economic importance.” 
 * Misleading the electorate by declaring that “the US is one of the most 
heavily taxed countries.” 
“His statements reveal a deep ignorance of economics and an inability to 
listen to credible experts,” the letter’s signatories conclude. “He repeats 
fake and misleading economic statistics, and pushes fallacies about the VAT and 
trade competitiveness. He promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories 
over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options.”
 
Polls are often conducted over multiple days, so we’re only just starting to 
measure the effect of the FBI’s decision torelease new details 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation>
 of its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server to lawmakers 
on Friday. According to the ABC/Washington Post trackingpoll 
<http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a102016ElectionTrackingNo10.pdf>
 published on Tuesday (conducted October 27-30), the Democratic candidate has 
now slipped behind Donald Trump, on 45% to her Republican opponent’s 46%. The 
pollingaverage 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html>
 calculated by RealClearPolitics, a much better indication of national 
sentiment, shows Clinton is now leading by just 2 percentage points, down from 
5 percentage points a week ago.

Those numbers are interesting but not necessarily indicative – polling won’t 
neatly translate to votes. Far more important will be theturnout 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/oct/29/voter-turnout-us-election-2016-register>
 - especially since the two leading presidential candidates are soclose in 
terms of unpopularity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity>
. And the candidates know it. A senior adviser to Donald Trump reportedly
revealed 
<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303034-trump-aide-we-have-three-major-voter-suppression>
 last week that “we have three major voter suppression operations under way” 
intended to reduce votes for Clinton among African Americans, white liberals 
and young women.


Even though election day is still a week away, we already have some clues 
about whether turnout is lower among those groups – because more than25m 
<http://www.electproject.org/early_2016> ballots have already been cast under 
the US early voting system. Approximately 125 million to 145 million Americans 
arepredicted 
<https://www.predictit.org/Market/2188/What-will-be-2016-voter-turnout-for-the-presidential-election>
 to vote in the 2016 election, so those early votes represent a significant 
share of the expected total.

Higher turnout than at this time in 2012

Of the 15 states that provide detailed information about those ballots, North 
Carolina, California and nine other states reportmore 
<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/31/us/elections/earlyvoters.html?_r=0>
 early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election. Ohio, Nevada, 
Colorado and Iowa showed a decline in early voting, and those declines were 
small.

Early signs of declining turnout from black voters and young voters

The early results offer mixed news for Clinton. Early votes suggest that young 
voters – who are muchmore likely 
<http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/> 
than older voters to lean Democratic – might be staying at home. In 12 states, 
fewer Americans aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election 
compared with this point in 2012. This could be especially problematic for 
Clinton if this group is indicative of a broader “Bernie or bust 
<https://www.facebook.com/groups/1031867576877207/>” sentiment in which 
supporters of the former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders choose to stay at 
home rather than voting for Clinton.


Young voters aren’t the only demographic group that appears put off. Early 
votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states – especially in 
North Carolina, a state that yields15 of the 270 
<https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html> 
electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests 
Clinton is in aclose contest 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html>
. If Trump’s strategy is indeed to suppress the black vote, that makes a lot of 
sense – those voters could be crucial for Clinton to secure the White House.

Speaking in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Donald Trump predicted “an unprecedented 
constitutional crisis” ifHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> were to be elected 
president.

“The work of government would come to an unbelievably unglorious halt,” Trump 
said, and “she is likely to be investigated for years, likely to be concluded 
with a very large-scale criminal trial.”

The audience chanted “Lock her up!” in response.

“This is a message for any Democratic voter who have already cast their ballot 
for Hillary Clinton and have a severe case of buyer’s remorse,” Trump said, 
referring to a few states - Wisconsin included - where early ballots can be 
reversed before election day. “A lot of stuff has come out since you’ve voted.”

“You can change your vote to Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> - we’ll make America great 
again, okay? She will never make America great.”
 
Speaking in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> greeted the audience by 
declaring that “in one week, we are going to win the great state of Wisconsin.”

Lauding the state’s governor, Scott Walker, as “one tough cookie,” Trump moved 
swiftly past local flavor for a casual listing of polls (valid or otherwise) 
that show him surging in battleground states.

“We’re on the cusp of something incredible. Historic change that transfers 
power from a failed political establishment,” Trump said.
