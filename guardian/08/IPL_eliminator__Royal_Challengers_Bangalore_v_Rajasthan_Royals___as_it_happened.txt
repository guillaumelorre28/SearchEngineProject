So, there we go; a battering for the ages. Mandeep and De Villers marshalled 
Bangalore’s innings with class, composure and enterprise; it really didn’t seem 
like there was much that Rajasthan could do. And then, chasing, they were never 
quite able to get going - the pressure of such a large score told, so too the 
excellence of the bowling, and Chennai will have to play exceptionally well to 
prevent RCB from contesting the final.

19th over: Rajasthan 109-9 (Sharma 7, Kulkarni 3) Target 181 Chahal, who’s 
been excellent, is rewarded with the pleasure of the penultimate over. The 
batsmen take a single each, then, after a dot, Kulkarni hoiks to midwicket - 
looks like four, but Mandeep hurls himself in its pursuit along the fence, 
saving three.

18th over: Rajasthan 105-9 (Sharma 5, Kulkarni 1) Target 181 Starc must be 
bearing up, because here he is bowling an entirely unnecessary fourth over. He 
begins it with four dots, but then an effort ball cedes a leg-side wide, then a 
single, then a dot. Just the 76 required from a full 12 deliveries.

WICKET! Morris c Chahal b Starc 0 (Rajasthan 95-8)

This a thrashing! Starc swings one in, Morris doesn’t know what to do, and 
tap-carves into the hands of mid-off.

16th over: Rajasthan 95-7 (Hooda 8, Morris 0) Target 181 Sure enough, here’s 
Starc, fresh from a stretch and rub during the timeout; missed opportunity for 
an enterprising massage parlour. Hooda forces his second ball over cover for 
two, then clips over mid-on for one more.

WICKET! Binny run out 0 (Rajasthan 92-7)

Weird gear right here! Binny plays his first ball, wanders down like there’s a 
run on when there’s not, turns, and is easily beaten by Chahal’s throw.

WICKET! Faulkner c & b Aravind 4 (Rajasthan 92-6)

Faulkner goes to pull a yorker from outside off, turns it into a half-vollley 
and bottom edges into the boot, and as the ball rears up, interrupts his 
follow-through to leap and lean right. Only he appeals, but that’s out right 
enough, and dis be over.

that’s Faulkner’s eye in. Aravind strays straight, and is duly carted to

WICKET! Rahane c De Villiers b Chahal 42 (Rajasthan 87-5)

Left with little option but to flay, Rahane flays, down on one knee and 
getting right under a flat one with his toe-end. Up goes the ball, point go 
AB’s hands, and that’s that.

13th over: Rajasthan 87-4 (Rahane 42, Hooda 5) Target 181 Rahane’s done his 
best to anchor this chase, but we’re beyond that now - the rate’s 14.55, and if 
the Royals are to have anything other than a hail mary shot, things need to 
happen immediately. But Chahal is bowling with cojones and control, varying his 
flight and giving no easy boundaries.

12th over: Rajasthan 83-4 (Rahane 39, Hooda 4) Target 181 That wicket’s 
rousted Patel - he seems to have put on a yard of pace. But Hooda has both 
power and fibre, thudding through cover towards the fence - but Kohli dives and 
scrabbles to save two, shoveling back to Wiese who completes the manouevre. 
Tactics, I love you.

“As a non-Indian,” emails James Lane, “it’s hard to know which team – if any – 
to support in theIPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl>. Do I cheer for 
Delhi because I’m living here? Or Bangalore because it’s a nice city? I feel a 
completely arbitrary allegiance to Rajasthan, just because they seem to have 
more Australians than the other teams and I remember Shane Warne driving them 
to an amazing title in the first year of the competition. But really, they’re 
all just different colored variations on a theme of Money Money Money. Growing 
up, cricket was divided upon such simple, national lines, so this brave new 
world of franchises feels strange.”

I feel you - and yet, from a distance, the civic pride in the teams seems 
palpable.

WICKET! Nair c Karthik b Patel 12 (Rajasthan 79-4)

The Royals are in trouble now, as many a tabloid editor has said. First ball 
of the over, nondescript swipe as a bouncier, pacier one cramps Nair, and he 
nicks off!

11th over: Rajasthan 79-3 (Rahane 39, Nair 12) Target 181 Nair swipes at 
Wiese’s first ball, and nicks - it goes quickly, but it’s to Karthik’s right, 
and he moves across well, only to be defeated by the pace, palming four behind. 
Wiese maintains equilibrium, though, ceding just four more from the rest of the 
over; with the power that’s to come, it’s time for a bat to be thrown, I’d 
posit.

10th over: Rajasthan 71-3 (Rahane 32, Nair 11) Target 181 It’s actually pretty 
hard to avoid being in with a puncher’s chance in the final couple of overs - 
even 40 required, is doable occasionally, especially given firepower like 
Faulkner, Hooda and Binny. and Aravind is doing his best to force them to use 
it, sending down three consecutive dots to begin with, then after a single, 
another. So Nair looks for a boundary from the final ball, cutting away to the 
point fence, only to find AB sweeping, haring around the rope, diving and 
paddling away to save two. Only three scored.

10th over: Rajasthan 68-3 (Rahane 31, Nair 9) Target 181 Chahal looks better 
this over, tossing up above the eyeline, and after Rahane flips a single to 
fine-leg, the wrongun forces a checked drive out of Nair and the ball dropping 
just shy of mid-off. Then, following a single to each batter, he edges an 
essential boundary - the Royals are hanging in there, but only just.

9th over: Rajasthan 61-3 (Rahane 29, Nair 4) Target 181 Looks like Rajasthan 
are planning to go huge in the final five, rather than satisfy the rate. But 
Nair isn’t going to hang about, wrapping a half-tracker from outside off over 
midwicket for four; can he do a Mandeep?

WICKET! Smith c De Villiers b Wiese 12 (Rajasthan 55-3)

Smith skips down and goes at one outside off that cuts away as he swings. He’s 
looking over cover but slices high - looks droppable, until you see that it’s 
AB underneath.

8th over: Rajasthan 55-2 (Rahane 28, Smith 12) Target 181 Time for Chahal’s 
leg-spin, proper test of nerve for him. Smith is going to target someone, and 
he doesn’t mind fare of this ilk, especially with a required run rate of beyond 
ten in just the eighth over. But this is played sensibly, yielding just five - 
risky tactic, this, not cashing in on nerves and inexperience.

7th over: Rajasthan 50-2 (Rahane 27, Smith 8) Target 181 Wiese into the 
attack, and Rajasthan might look to attack here - or be feart of losing more 
wickets. Looks like the latter, a two and four singles from the first five 
balls, while Starc fiddles with his back - wish an Ashes summer en route, let’s 
hope it’s no big deal, nor that he makes it one. Anyway, back in the middle, 
Rahane glances the final delivery for four, while Starc necks painkillers on 
the boundary. Yes! Strategy!

6th over: Rajasthan 40-2 (Rahane 19, Smith 6) Target 181 With RCB’s foot on 
the throat, they bring their best bowler back to further trample the trachea. 
He’s actually not moving quite as usual, clutching his back, but hits his 
straps more consistently than in his first over. But this is Steven Smith he’s 
bowling too, who, with a boundary needed, sidles away from a fuller one to mash 
over cover for a severely need four.

WICKET! Samson c Karthik b Patel 5 (Rajasthan 33-2)

Patel cramps Samson with a well-directed lifter, who weaves away but can’t 
extract his bat, feathering behind to induce much leaping and shrieking in the 
field. Thus next pair will need to come off, you’d reckon.

4th over: Rajasthan 30-1 (Rahane 16, Samson 4) Target 181 Aravind drops 
fractionally short, of which Rahane is having none - he clumps four over 
midwicket. For the now, one boundary an over isn’t terrible, given a likely 
four or five from the remainder. And that’s what they get here, setting it up 
and setting it up.

contemplated sending himself in here, so he’d have time to build. With RCB all 
wicketed up, Starc takes a blow and Virat introduces Patel’s medium pace , 
presumably planning to sneak in a cheap over while the batsmen contemplate how 
best to play things. But when he strays onto the pads, Rahane glances away 
beautifully for four behind square on the off-side, and seven off the over 
probably suits both parties.

WICKET! Watson c Karthik b Aravind 10 (Rajasthan 14-1)

Final ball of the over and Watson can’t help himself - can’t afford to help 
himself - going hard, cross-batted at a wide one. He bottom-edges behind, and 
Virat does Thundercat eyes.

2nd over: Rajasthan 11-0 (Rahane 4, Watson 10) Target 181 Here’s the returning 
Aravind, and he’s right into it with two dots. Bangalore have decided that back 
of a length is where they need to bowl, bringing the batsmen forward, and 
they’re fidgeting after mustering just three singles from the first five balls. 
And then!

1st over: Rajasthan 11-0 (Rahane 2, Watson 9) Target 181 Starc begins, and 
immediately extracts significant bounce, more than managed by anyone 
previously. But Rahane flashes a single to third man, and then Watson gorges on 
width, muscle-driving off the back foot for four to point. And there’re four 
more! Starc’s short, Watson’s forward then back, and the ball’s spinning to the 
fine-leg fence! Already, this is a great start, can the Royals force it home? 
They can’t, but 11 to begin, and off the danger-man too, will put them right on 
a buzz.

Er, AB de Villiers is good at batting. That was a perfectly paced innings 
under intense pressure, but possible only thanks to Mandeep, who maintained 
momentum while he settled. Hard to see Rajasthan pulling this off, but if they 
can see Starc away, they’ve got some pretty nifty chaps in their line-up.

Bangalore set Rajasthan 181 to win!

20th over: Bangalore 180-4 (Mandeep 54, Sarfaraz 1) Eleven form the final over 
- good effort from Morris, that. But still, that is exceptionally daunting.

20th over: Bangalore 177-3 (Mandeep 53, Karthik 8) Morris with the joy of the 
last over, and he gives Karthik width first ball - it’s the batter’s first 
ball, too - but it makes no difference at all. He smites over cover for six, 
then adds two more.

So, there we go; a battering for the ages. Mandeep and De Villers marshalled 
Bangalore’s innings with class, composure and enterprise; it really didn’t seem 
like there was much that Rajasthan could do. And then, chasing, they were never 
quite able to get going - the pressure of such a large score told, so too the 
excellence of the bowling, and Chennai will have to play exceptionally well to 
prevent RCB from contesting the final.
 
Kulkarni b Chahal 3 (Rajasthan 109 all out)
 
19th over: Rajasthan 109-9 (Sharma 7, Kulkarni 3) Target 181 Chahal, who’s 
been excellent, is rewarded with the pleasure of the penultimate over. The 
batsmen take a single each, then, after a dot, Kulkarni hoiks to midwicket - 
looks like four, but Mandeep hurls himself in its pursuit along the fence, 
saving three.
 
18th over: Rajasthan 105-9 (Sharma 5, Kulkarni 1) Target 181 Starc must be 
bearing up, because here he is bowling an entirely unnecessary fourth over. He 
begins it with four dots, but then an effort ball cedes a leg-side wide, then a 
single, then a dot. Just the 76 required from a full 12 deliveries.
 
17th over: Rajasthan 103-9 (Sharma 5, Kulkarni 0) Target 181 This would be 
anticlimactic, had Bangalore not played so wonderfully well.
 
A nelson emergency, but no one’s around to exorcise or attend. Hooda, who’s 
swiping at everything, as you would, mishits high to the midwicket fence, and 
Starc holds on easily.
 
17th over: Rajasthan 99-8 (Hooda 11, Sharma 1) Target 181 Wiese returns, and 
Hooda almost picks out AB, sweeping on the off-side when he slices high - but 
the ball drops short.
 
16th over: Rajasthan 95-8 (Hooda 8, Sharma 0) Target 181 Who’d have predicted 
Rajasthan to be so thoroughly shut down?
 
This a thrashing! Starc swings one in, Morris doesn’t know what to do, and 
tap-carves into the hands of mid-off.
 
16th over: Rajasthan 95-7 (Hooda 8, Morris 0) Target 181 Sure enough, here’s 
Starc, fresh from a stretch and rub during the timeout; missed opportunity for 
an enterprising massage parlour. Hooda forces his second ball over cover for 
two, then clips over mid-on for one more.
 
15th over: Rajasthan 92-7 (Hooda 5, Morris 0) Target 181 This is going to end 
up a monstrous thrashing. Might be time for Mitch II to toss a few down.
 
Weird gear right here! Binny plays his first ball, wanders down like there’s a 
run on when there’s not, turns, and is easily beaten by Chahal’s throw.
 
Faulkner goes to pull a yorker from outside off, turns it into a half-vollley 
and bottom edges into the boot, and as the ball rears up, interrupts his 
follow-through to leap and lean right. Only he appeals, but that’s out right 
enough, and dis be over.
 
15th over: Rajasthan 92-5 (Hooda 5, Faulkner 4) Target 181 Dot, wide, and 
that’s Faulkner’s eye in. Aravind strays straight, and is duly carted to 
square-leg for four. And what’s this! Aravind appeals for a caught and bowled, 
while everyone else prepares for another ball, because what’s happened is...
 
14th over: Rajasthan 87-5 (Hooda 5, Faulkner 0) Target 181 This requires 
something epochal from Rajasthan now.
 
Left with little option but to flay, Rahane flays, down on one knee and 
getting right under a flat one with his toe-end. Up goes the ball, point go 
AB’s hands, and that’s that.
 
13th over: Rajasthan 87-4 (Rahane 42, Hooda 5) Target 181 Rahane’s done his 
best to anchor this chase, but we’re beyond that now - the rate’s 14.55, and if 
the Royals are to have anything other than a hail mary shot, things need to 
happen immediately. But Chahal is bowling with cojones and control, varying his 
flight and giving no easy boundaries.
 
12th over: Rajasthan 83-4 (Rahane 39, Hooda 4) Target 181 That wicket’s 
rousted Patel - he seems to have put on a yard of pace. But Hooda has both 
power and fibre, thudding through cover towards the fence - but Kohli dives and 
scrabbles to save two, shoveling back to Wiese who completes the manouevre. 
Tactics, I love you.

“As a non-Indian,” emails James Lane, “it’s hard to know which team – if any – 
to support in theIPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl>. Do I cheer for 
Delhi because I’m living here? Or Bangalore because it’s a nice city? I feel a 
completely arbitrary allegiance to Rajasthan, just because they seem to have 
more Australians than the other teams and I remember Shane Warne driving them 
to an amazing title in the first year of the competition. But really, they’re 
all just different colored variations on a theme of Money Money Money. Growing 
up, cricket was divided upon such simple, national lines, so this brave new 
world of franchises feels strange.”

I feel you - and yet, from a distance, the civic pride in the teams seems 
palpable.
 
The Royals are in trouble now, as many a tabloid editor has said. First ball 
of the over, nondescript swipe as a bouncier, pacier one cramps Nair, and he 
nicks off!
 
11th over: Rajasthan 79-3 (Rahane 39, Nair 12) Target 181 Nair swipes at 
Wiese’s first ball, and nicks - it goes quickly, but it’s to Karthik’s right, 
and he moves across well, only to be defeated by the pace, palming four behind. 
Wiese maintains equilibrium, though, ceding just four more from the rest of the 
over; with the power that’s to come, it’s time for a bat to be thrown, I’d 
posit.
 
10th over: Rajasthan 71-3 (Rahane 32, Nair 11) Target 181 It’s actually pretty 
hard to avoid being in with a puncher’s chance in the final couple of overs - 
even 40 required, is doable occasionally, especially given firepower like 
Faulkner, Hooda and Binny. and Aravind is doing his best to force them to use 
it, sending down three consecutive dots to begin with, then after a single, 
another. So Nair looks for a boundary from the final ball, cutting away to the 
point fence, only to find AB sweeping, haring around the rope, diving and 
paddling away to save two. Only three scored.
 
10th over: Rajasthan 68-3 (Rahane 31, Nair 9) Target 181 Chahal looks better 
this over, tossing up above the eyeline, and after Rahane flips a single to 
fine-leg, the wrongun forces a checked drive out of Nair and the ball dropping 
just shy of mid-off. Then, following a single to each batter, he edges an 
essential boundary - the Royals are hanging in there, but only just.
 
9th over: Rajasthan 61-3 (Rahane 29, Nair 4) Target 181 Looks like Rajasthan 
are planning to go huge in the final five, rather than satisfy the rate. But 
Nair isn’t going to hang about, wrapping a half-tracker from outside off over 
midwicket for four; can he do a Mandeep?
 
Smith skips down and goes at one outside off that cuts away as he swings. He’s 
looking over cover but slices high - looks droppable, until you see that it’s 
AB underneath.
 
8th over: Rajasthan 55-2 (Rahane 28, Smith 12) Target 181 Time for Chahal’s 
leg-spin, proper test of nerve for him. Smith is going to target someone, and 
he doesn’t mind fare of this ilk, especially with a required run rate of beyond 
ten in just the eighth over. But this is played sensibly, yielding just five - 
risky tactic, this, not cashing in on nerves and inexperience.
 
7th over: Rajasthan 50-2 (Rahane 27, Smith 8) Target 181 Wiese into the 
attack, and Rajasthan might look to attack here - or be feart of losing more 
wickets. Looks like the latter, a two and four singles from the first five 
balls, while Starc fiddles with his back - wish an Ashes summer en route, let’s 
hope it’s no big deal, nor that he makes it one. Anyway, back in the middle, 
Rahane glances the final delivery for four, while Starc necks painkillers on 
the boundary. Yes! Strategy!
 
6th over: Rajasthan 40-2 (Rahane 19, Smith 6) Target 181 With RCB’s foot on 
the throat, they bring their best bowler back to further trample the trachea. 
He’s actually not moving quite as usual, clutching his back, but hits his 
straps more consistently than in his first over. But this is Steven Smith he’s 
bowling too, who, with a boundary needed, sidles away from a fuller one to mash 
over cover for a severely need four.
 
5th over: Rajasthan 34-2 (Rahane 18, Smith 1) Target 181 Smith off the mark 
right away, and the run rate is now 9.80.
 
Patel cramps Samson with a well-directed lifter, who weaves away but can’t 
extract his bat, feathering behind to induce much leaping and shrieking in the 
field. Thus next pair will need to come off, you’d reckon.
 
5th over: Rajasthan 33-1 (Rahane 18, Samson 5) Target 181 Patel continues, 
bowling a tight line fourth-fifth stump line but inserting an occasional full 
ball to the diet of back-of-a-length stuff.
 
4th over: Rajasthan 30-1 (Rahane 16, Samson 4) Target 181 Aravind drops 
fractionally short, of which Rahane is having none - he clumps four over 
midwicket. For the now, one boundary an over isn’t terrible, given a likely 
four or five from the remainder. And that’s what they get here, setting it up 
and setting it up.
 
3rd over: Rajasthan 21-1 (Rahane 10, Samson 1) Target 181 Hmm, wonder if Smith 
contemplated sending himself in here, so he’d have time to build. With RCB all 
wicketed up, Starc takes a blow and Virat introduces Patel’s medium pace , 
presumably planning to sneak in a cheap over while the batsmen contemplate how 
best to play things. But when he strays onto the pads, Rahane glances away 
beautifully for four behind square on the off-side, and seven off the over 
probably suits both parties.
 
Final ball of the over and Watson can’t help himself - can’t afford to help 
himself - going hard, cross-batted at a wide one. He bottom-edges behind, and 
Virat does Thundercat eyes.
 
2nd over: Rajasthan 11-0 (Rahane 4, Watson 10) Target 181 Here’s the returning 
Aravind, and he’s right into it with two dots. Bangalore have decided that back 
of a length is where they need to bowl, bringing the batsmen forward, and 
they’re fidgeting after mustering just three singles from the first five balls. 
And then!
 
1st over: Rajasthan 11-0 (Rahane 2, Watson 9) Target 181 Starc begins, and 
immediately extracts significant bounce, more than managed by anyone 
previously. But Rahane flashes a single to third man, and then Watson gorges on 
width, muscle-driving off the back foot for four to point. And there’re four 
more! Starc’s short, Watson’s forward then back, and the ball’s spinning to the 
fine-leg fence! Already, this is a great start, can the Royals force it home? 
They can’t, but 11 to begin, and off the danger-man too, will put them right on

The players are middled! Hold onto your hat/hair/syrup!

anything is possible.
 
Er, AB de Villiers is good at batting. That was a perfectly paced innings 
under intense pressure, but possible only thanks to Mandeep, who maintained 
momentum while he settled. Hard to see Rajasthan pulling this off, but if they 
can see Starc away, they’ve got some pretty nifty chaps in their line-up.
 
20th over: Bangalore 180-4 (Mandeep 54, Sarfaraz 1) Eleven form the final over 
- good effort from Morris, that. But still, that is exceptionally daunting.
 
Karthik goes again, trying to pull from outside off but slicing high instead, 
and that’s a simple catch.
 
20th over: Bangalore 177-3 (Mandeep 53, Karthik 8) Morris with the joy of the 
last over, and he gives Karthik width first ball - it’s the batter’s first 
ball, too - but it makes no difference at all. He smites over cover for six, 
then adds two more.
