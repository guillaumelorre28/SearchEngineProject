We need to talk about … luxury repackaging of pop music 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/16/pop-music-bespoke-plaything-wealth-divide>

.

There’s a new Pink Floyd record out, as they used to say in the 1970s. Only 
it’s not a record, a CD, or anything resembling the modest recorded artefacts 
with which that group made their name, but rather a 27-disc cornucopia, 
containing more than 26 hours of music, 42 “items of memorabilia”, five 
reproduction vinyl singles and three feature films.

The photo essay: Travellers’ tales - on the road with the Dale Farm families 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ng-interactive/2016/nov/15/travellers-tales-on-the-road-with-the-dale-farm-families-photo-essay>

witnessing everything from eviction to Holy Communion
