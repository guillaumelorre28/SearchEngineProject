We know we’ve published a summary post, but we don’t want you to miss this, 
either:

Dan writes:


Nigel Farage, interim leader of the UK Independence Party, was also in the 
spin room to defendDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and attack Clinton as a 
threat to democracy.

“What would your warning be to America having heard Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> say she’s for open 
borders?,” he was asked by a reporter during an interview alongside Alabama 
senator Jeff Sessions.

“If you value democracy and if you value being in control of your own destiny 
then you have to reject Hillary Clinton’s ideas. Simple,” said Farage.

Don’t miss this roundup of reaction from Guardian opinion writers. Great first 
lines here:

That banging sound you heard were the last nails being hammered 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-women-comments-groping-apology>
 into the coffin of the Trump campaign.

And

If there was a theme for Trump this evening, it would be aggressive 
desperation.

And 

Trump succeeded, and he succeeded before the first question was even asked.

And, simply: 

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> lost tonight’s 
debate.

The second presidential debate is in the can. Here’s what happened:

 * It was a nasty affair without perhaps being quite so sordid or raw as might 
have been expected, given Donald Trump’s signal beforehand that he would attack 
Hillary Clinton as an enabler of her husband’s sins. 
 * Challenged to defend his recently uncovered hot mic remarks about grabbing 
women, Trump said they amounted to “locker room” talk he was embarrassed by – 
but he denied he had assaulted women, whereas, he said, Bill Clinton had been 
“so abusive to women.” 
 * Clinton did not respond to Trump’s catalog of her husband’s sins, apart to 
say it was inaccurate. “When they go low, you go high,” she said. 
 * Clinton placed Trump’s hot mic remarks in context with others – she listed 
his attack on the Khan family, his “birther” attack on Obama, his attack on a 
disabled reporter and his attack on a federal judge of Mexican descent – to 
paint Trump as an unreformed bully. She said Trump “owes the country an 
apology.” 
 * Trump projected intense hostility for Clinton. He repeatedly called her a 
liar, leered at her, scoffed, said she had accomplished nothing in her career, 
loomed behind her as she spoke with audience members, and told her if he were 
president, “you’d be in jail.” He pointed at her, andsaid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/09/debate-live-fact-check-trump-tape-presidential-election-republican-critics?page=with:block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62#block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62>
, “she has tremendous hate in her heart.” 
 * “I know you’re into big diversion tonight,” Clinton told Trump. “Anything 
to avoid talking about your campaign and its explosion and how Republicans are 
leaving it.” 
 * More than one snap analyst – FWIW – thought Trump had “shored up his base” 
of supporters by attacking Clinton over deleted emails, Benghazi and other 
issues. Few asserted that he had broadened his appeal. 
 * Twice Clinton said that Russia was seeking to influence the election, and 
not on her behalf. 
 * Trump said he disagreed with running mate Mike Pence’s assertion that the 
United States should consider military force to oppose Russian aggression in 
Syria. Pence tweeted congratulations after.

 * Trump also said there’s no Muslim ban plan anymore: “The Muslim ban is 
something that in some form has morphed into extreme vetting.” 
 * A few times, Trump seemed to shock Clinton. He said that Capt. Humayun Khan 
would still be alive if he, Trump, were president. Clinton’s foreign policy 
spokesman replied: Jesse Lehrich (@JesseLehrich) 
hey, @realDonaldTrump <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump> – regarding your 
claim that Captain Khan would be alive if you were president:

go fuck yourself.#debate <https://twitter.com/hashtag/debate?src=hash>
 <https://twitter.com/JesseLehrich/status/785294631382712321> October 10, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/JesseLehrich/status/785294631382712321> 
 * Trump admitted unapologetically that he had applied almost a billion in 
personal losses to not pay federal income tax. “Of course I do.” 
 * Trump staged a media event before the debate with three women who have 
accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or rape and one woman raped as a child 
whose assailant Hillary Clinton defended as a 27-year-old lawyer. 
 * Clinton was asked about a line from a Wikileaks version of a purported paid 
speech in which she describe a president’s need to have separate public and 
private faces. She said she was talking about Abraham Lincoln. 
 * The candidates did not shake hands when they arrived at the town hall. 
Trump had the sniffles. And he complained a lot about the moderators letting 
Clinton talk more than him. A time clock count afterwards showed the time was 
split evenly.

Twitter has announced that this was the most-tweeted debate ever, with data to 
come. Surprising that it beat the first one?

With references to Lewinsky scandal, e-mails, Benghazi, attacking media, Trump

What’s your snap reaction? Trump attacked Clinton aggressively. He was, at 
times, downright nasty. Did he manage to shake Clinton?

Clinton is shaking hands with everyone. Trump is hanging with his family. Now 
Trump moves to mingle with the crowd too.

Here’s how searches for “Hillary Clinton” and “Donald Trump” respectively 
peaked around key moments in the debate, according to the good folks at Google:

 1. Trump: “You’d be in jail”


2. Trump: “It’s just words”

3. Trump on what he respects about Clinton 

4. Trump on the Iraq war 

5. Clinton on religious freedom

We know we’ve published a summary post, but we don’t want you to miss this, 
either:

Dan writes:


Nigel Farage, interim leader of the UK Independence Party, was also in the 
spin room to defendDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and attack Clinton as a 
threat to democracy.

“What would your warning be to America having heard Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> say she’s for open 
borders?,” he was asked by a reporter during an interview alongside Alabama 
senator Jeff Sessions.

“If you value democracy and if you value being in control of your own destiny 
then you have to reject Hillary Clinton’s ideas. Simple,” said Farage.
 
Don’t miss this roundup of reaction from Guardian opinion writers. Great first 
lines here:

That banging sound you heard were the last nails being hammered 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-women-comments-groping-apology>
 into the coffin of the Trump campaign.

And

If there was a theme for Trump this evening, it would be aggressive 
desperation.

And 

Trump succeeded, and he succeeded before the first question was even asked.

And, simply: 

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> lost tonight’s 
debate.

'A Red Bull display of madness': reactions to the Trump-Clinton presidential 
debate

<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-reactions-trump-clinton> 
The second presidential debate is in the can. Here’s what happened:

 * It was a nasty affair without perhaps being quite so sordid or raw as might 
have been expected, given Donald Trump’s signal beforehand that he would attack 
Hillary Clinton as an enabler of her husband’s sins. 
 * Challenged to defend his recently uncovered hot mic remarks about grabbing 
women, Trump said they amounted to “locker room” talk he was embarrassed by – 
but he denied he had assaulted women, whereas, he said, Bill Clinton had been 
“so abusive to women.” 
 * Clinton did not respond to Trump’s catalog of her husband’s sins, apart to 
say it was inaccurate. “When they go low, you go high,” she said. 
 * Clinton placed Trump’s hot mic remarks in context with others – she listed 
his attack on the Khan family, his “birther” attack on Obama, his attack on a 
disabled reporter and his attack on a federal judge of Mexican descent – to 
paint Trump as an unreformed bully. She said Trump “owes the country an 
apology.” 
 * Trump projected intense hostility for Clinton. He repeatedly called her a 
liar, leered at her, scoffed, said she had accomplished nothing in her career, 
loomed behind her as she spoke with audience members, and told her if he were 
president, “you’d be in jail.” He pointed at her, andsaid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/09/debate-live-fact-check-trump-tape-presidential-election-republican-critics?page=with:block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62#block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62>
, “she has tremendous hate in her heart.” 
 * “I know you’re into big diversion tonight,” Clinton told Trump. “Anything 
to avoid talking about your campaign and its explosion and how Republicans are 
leaving it.” 
 * More than one snap analyst – FWIW – thought Trump had “shored up his base” 
of supporters by attacking Clinton over deleted emails, Benghazi and other 
issues. Few asserted that he had broadened his appeal. 
 * Twice Clinton said that Russia was seeking to influence the election, and 
not on her behalf. 
 * Trump said he disagreed with running mate Mike Pence’s assertion that the 
United States should consider military force to oppose Russian aggression in 
Syria. Pence tweeted congratulations after.

 * Trump also said there’s no Muslim ban plan anymore: “The Muslim ban is 
something that in some form has morphed into extreme vetting.” 
 * A few times, Trump seemed to shock Clinton. He said that Capt. Humayun Khan 
would still be alive if he, Trump, were president. Clinton’s foreign policy 
spokesman replied: Jesse Lehrich (@JesseLehrich) 
hey, @realDonaldTrump <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump> – regarding your 
claim that Captain Khan would be alive if you were president:

go fuck yourself.#debate <https://twitter.com/hashtag/debate?src=hash>

<https://twitter.com/JesseLehrich/status/785294631382712321> 
 * Trump admitted unapologetically that he had applied almost a billion in 
personal losses to not pay federal income tax. “Of course I do.” 
 * Trump staged a media event before the debate with three women who have 
accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or rape and one woman raped as a child 
whose assailant Hillary Clinton defended as a 27-year-old lawyer. 
 * Clinton was asked about a line from a Wikileaks version of a purported paid 
speech in which she describe a president’s need to have separate public and 
private faces. She said she was talking about Abraham Lincoln. 
 * The candidates did not shake hands when they arrived at the town hall. 
Trump had the sniffles. And he complained a lot about the moderators letting 
Clinton talk more than him. A time clock count afterwards showed the time was 
split evenly.

What’s your snap reaction? Trump attacked Clinton aggressively. He was, at 
times, downright nasty. Did he manage to shake Clinton?

Clinton is shaking hands with everyone. Trump is hanging with his family. Now 
Trump moves to mingle with the crowd too.
