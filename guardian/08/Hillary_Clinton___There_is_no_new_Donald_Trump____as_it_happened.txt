McCartney, at the Quicken Loans arena in Cleveland, where McCartney is playing 
a show tonight, and which readers may remember as the site of the Republican 
national convention.

Adam Gabbatt

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> doesn’t trust 
the media. He thinks the media is dishonest.

We know this because he constantly sends emails to supporters regarding the 
“dishonest media”.

In the past nine days he’s sent out two alone: on August 9 and on August 15. 
The latter went further. The Trump campaign now has “two opponents”, he said: 
Hillary Clinton and the “very dishonest” media. (He has also repeatedly
criticised photojournalists 
<http://www.poynter.org/2016/donald-trumps-favorite-target-photojournalists/395580/>
 and television cameras for allegedly not showing the crowds at his rallies and
attacked 
<http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/08/politics/donald-trump-cnn-megyn-kelly-comment/> 
individual 
<https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=donald%20trump%20journalist>
reporters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-calls-reporter-ewan-macaskill-a-nasty-nasty-guy-video>
.)
 Dishonest! Photograph: Guardian 
Strange then, that Trump also regularly sends out links to favourable media 
articles. This week he sent those emails on Monday, Tuesday and today, with 
URLs taking readers to right-wing websites but also news organisations like the 
Washington Post – which hebarred from attending his rallies 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/does-it-matter-that-donald-trump-has-banned-us-not-in-the-way-youd-think/2016/06/14/e11aa0c2-324f-11e6-95c0-2a6873031302_story.html>
 in June – and NBC News.

If Trump says the media is not to be trusted, then by definition any positive 
media article written about him is not to be trusted. Including this one, I 
guess.

,confirmed 
<http://www.dailywire.com/news/8441/i-know-trumps-new-campaign-chairman-steve-bannon-ben-shapiro>
 on Wednesday that one of the investors in Breitbart.com is reclusive 
conservative mega-donor Robert Mercer. (Rumorsswirled

<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2016-01-20/what-kind-of-man-spends-millions-to-elect-ted-cruz->
 about Mercer’s investment in the site, but then-executive chairman Steve 
Bannon, who today became the newest hire by Donald Trump’s campaign, refused to 
confirm Mercer’s involvement.)

Mercer is a computer programmer by trade 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hedge-fund-magnaterobert-mercer-emerges-as-a-generous-backer-of-ted-cruz.html?_r=0>

, and has publicly spentmore than $15m 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hedge-fund-magnaterobert-mercer-emerges-as-a-generous-backer-of-ted-cruz.html?_r=0>
 on conservative causes since 2015. He also funds a $36.7m non-profit 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-10-23/the-man-who-outkoched-the-kochs>
, the Mercer Family Foundation, run by his daughter, Rebekah Mercer: it, in 
turn, funnels money into conservative non-profits like the Media Research 
Center (the conservative organization dedicated to exposing liberal bias in 
media), Citizens United (the non-profit behind the US supreme court case that 
upended American campaign finance laws) and the climate-denyingHeartland 
Institute 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/15/leak-exposes-heartland-institute-climate>
 and Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, among others.

Mercer’s donations have gone to less mainstream causes as well, according to a 
report from Bloomberg 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2016-01-20/what-kind-of-man-spends-millions-to-elect-ted-cruz->
, from conferences advocating a return to the gold standard and an activist 
convinced that climate change is a UN plot to “depopulate rural America”.

And Mercer’s cut checks 
<http://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/07/robert-mercer-the-most-important-political-money-man-youve-never-heard-of.html>
 for a veritable who’s-who of conservative darlings, from the Koch brothers’ 
Super Pac to current Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, from foreign policy hawk and 
perennial also-ran John Bolton to Ohio Senator Rob Portman, and from the 
fiscally conservative Club for Growth to the anti-abortion Women Speak Out Pac, 
an offshoot of the anti-abortion Susan B Anthony List. And he and his daughter 
were big, early backers of Senator Ted Cruz’s political ambitions, supporting 
his campaign and an affiliated Super Pac.

Interestingly, as Politico reported last year 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ted-cruz-donor-for-data-119813>, Mercer 
is reportedly an investor in Cambridge Analytics, which uses microtargeting and 
psychographic analysis to help campaigns – like Cruz’s – reach voters that its 
algorithms deem persuadable. Politico reported that “nearly 93 percent of the 
$2.6 million Cambridge Analytica has received in traceable federal payments has 
come from committees to which the Mercers donated generously”.

Microtargeting involves 
<http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/05/politics/voters-microtargeting/> collecting 
or buying a whole host of personally identifiable data – compiled from 
everything from tracking cookies monitoring people’s web habits to purchase 
data (sometime compiled using store discount cards) and responses to online 
surveys and petitions – and matching it with voter data to build detailed 
dossiers on voters to use in online and even mobile advertising. Cruz’s campaign
claimed 
<http://www.npr.org/2016/02/19/467395218/ted-cruz-campaign-takes-voter-micro-targeting-to-next-level>
 in an NPR interview to have 4,000 points of data on every single American 
voter because of Cambridge Analytics; the company told NPR that “hundreds of 
thousands” of Americans had taken their 120-point personality test.

Genius behind taco bowl tweet was Trump family member

OK, which family member had the brilliant idea for the Trump taco bowl tweet? 
Ivanka? Eric? Don Jr? Melania? Barron? Tiffany? Are we missing anyone?

The Huffington Post’s Howard Fineman captures the scene 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-manafort-unhappy-campaign_us_57b490f7e4b0edfa80daabf5?section=>
 in a report on the fall of Manafort:

Manafort had reason to know this from the start ― and reason to know that his 
advice would be ignored.

The taco bowl incident 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-taco-bowl_us_572bf20be4b096e9f090e1c5>
, trivial though it was, is one example. On Cinco de Mayo, Trump happened to be 
eating a taco bowl for lunch at his desk in Trump Tower. Manafort was in the 
office with other aides when a member of the family suggested they tweet a 
picture of Trump enjoying his “Mexican” lunch.

Manafort politely suggested that this might be seen as condescending and 
cautioned against it. The tweet went out. Trump himself was delighted by the 
resulting controversy. “The people who were offended were people we wanted to 
offend,” he later said.

UPDATE: Breitbart has denied that political editor Matthew Boyle is joining 
the Trump campaign.
Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) 
Breitbart's Matt Boyle's not joining Trump campaign. "Absolutely 100% false," 
EIC Alex Marlow tells me.

Clinton: 'there is no new Donald Trump'

Clinton alludes to the deckchair rearrangement on luxury liner Trump and says 
it does not matter:

He can hire and fire whoever he wants from his campaign. They can make him 
read new words from a teleprompter. But he is still the same man who insults 
gold star families, mocks people with disabilities and thinks he knows more 
about Isis than our generals. There is no newDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> – this is it.

Awfully difficult to get Trump to 270 electoral votes when Clinton has big 
leads in states totaling 273 electoral votes.

Clinton seems to be leading. Dems seem to be leading in IL, IN, NH, PA, & WI. 
Good enough for control of the Senate.

Newly minted campaign manager argues there are secret Trump voters not 
reflected in polls

Lauren Gambino

The Guardian’s Lauren Gambino with the pool of reporters tracking Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> today in Manhattan. She spoke 
with Kellyanne Conway, the pollster promoted to campaign manager in the 
overnight Trump campaign shake-up.

“Now we see a number of voters who are not coming clean about their support 
for Donald Trump,” Conway tells Lauren.And don’t call it a shake-up:

“This is an expansion at an incredibly busy time, the last 12-week homestretch 
for the campaign. We look at personnel as more as more. With Paul continuing as 
our chairman and Rick Gates as his deputy, Stephen Bannon and I have been added 
to what I would call the “core four” of that senior team and we’re going to 
divide responsibilities according to our best an highest uses.”


Q: How will she and Bannon work together?

“Steve Bannon and I have tremendous respect for each other as colleagues and 
as friends and we also have the trust of Donald Trump the candidate. You first 
of all have the trust of the candidate and the latitude … We have different 
styles but we have one vision.”

She said she expects to hit the campaign field and TV circuit while Bannon 
mans the HQ at Trump Tower.

Q: Is the race over or just getting started?

“Two or three things we’ve all learned about Donald Trump is No 1: Don’t 
underestimate him. No 2: You know he exceeds expectations and No 3: he also 
exceeds the metrics that are usually at play, meaning he over performed many of 
his polling averages in the primaries and the caucuses. But now we see a number 
of voters who are not coming clean about their support for Donald Trump. I 
can’t find a single hidden Hilary Clinton voter in the country. I’ve been 
looking for him or her. They all seem to be out, proudly saying that their 
voting forHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>.

“In the case of Mr. Trump, the race isn’t over because August is not October 
let alone November.”

Q: How does Manafort fit in on the new team?:

“We would hope and expect Paul continues to do many of things he’s been doing. 
He’s just been doing the job of three or four people. We’re there to help him 
in that regard and he’s there to help us.”

Trump: 'the Democratic party has failed the African American community'

Just before appointing the head of a web site that traffics in racist 
conspiracy theories to run his campaign, Trump made a pitch, in a speech in 
Wisconsin last night, to African American voters.

“It’s time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes,” Trump said:

Good news for Donald Trump in Indiana, which succumbed in 2008 to the charms 
of Barack Obama: a new Monmouth poll has the Republican candidate 11 points 
ahead of rivalHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>. Trump’s running mate, 
Mike Pence, is the current Indiana governor.

The poll contains perhaps better news, though, for Democrats, for whom picking 
up the US senate seat being vacated by the retiring Republican Dan Coats is a 
crucial part of a plan to regain the senate majority.

Democrat Evan Bayh, a former Hoosier governor and senator, is seven points up 
on congressman Todd Young in the poll. Therehaven’t been 
<http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-indiana-senate-young-vs-bayh>
 enough polls to establish a meaningful average in the senate race.
(((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) 
A non-partisan poll from Monmouth has Bayh up 7 in Indiana.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> doesn’t trust 
the media. He thinks the media is dishonest.

We know this because he constantly sends emails to supporters regarding the 
“dishonest media”.

In the past nine days he’s sent out two alone: on August 9 and on August 15. 
The latter went further. The Trump campaign now has “two opponents”, he said: 
Hillary Clinton and the “very dishonest” media. (He has also repeatedly
criticised photojournalists 
<http://www.poynter.org/2016/donald-trumps-favorite-target-photojournalists/395580/>
 and television cameras for allegedly not showing the crowds at his rallies and
attacked

.)
 Dishonest! Photograph: Guardian 
Strange then, that Trump also regularly sends out links to favourable media 
articles. This week he sent those emails on Monday, Tuesday and today, with 
URLs taking readers to right-wing websites but also news organisations like the 
Washington Post – which hebarred from attending his rallies 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/does-it-matter-that-donald-trump-has-banned-us-not-in-the-way-youd-think/2016/06/14/e11aa0c2-324f-11e6-95c0-2a6873031302_story.html>
 in June – and NBC News.

If Trump says the media is not to be trusted, then by definition any positive 
media article written about him is not to be trusted. Including this one, I 
guess.

 on Wednesday that one of the investors in Breitbart.com is reclusive 
conservative mega-donor Robert Mercer. (Rumorsswirled

 about Mercer’s investment in the site, but then-executive chairman Steve 
Bannon, who today became the newest hire by Donald Trump’s campaign, refused to 
confirm Mercer’s involvement.)

Mercer is a computer programmer by trade 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hedge-fund-magnaterobert-mercer-emerges-as-a-generous-backer-of-ted-cruz.html?_r=0>

, and has publicly spentmore than $15m 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/politics/hedge-fund-magnaterobert-mercer-emerges-as-a-generous-backer-of-ted-cruz.html?_r=0>
 on conservative causes since 2015. He also funds a $36.7m non-profit 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-10-23/the-man-who-outkoched-the-kochs>
, the Mercer Family Foundation, run by his daughter, Rebekah Mercer: it, in 
turn, funnels money into conservative non-profits like the Media Research 
Center (the conservative organization dedicated to exposing liberal bias in 
media), Citizens United (the non-profit behind the US supreme court case that 
upended American campaign finance laws) and the climate-denyingHeartland 
Institute 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/15/leak-exposes-heartland-institute-climate>
 and Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, among others.

Mercer’s donations have gone to less mainstream causes as well, according to a 
report from Bloomberg 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2016-01-20/what-kind-of-man-spends-millions-to-elect-ted-cruz->
, from conferences advocating a return to the gold standard and an activist 
convinced that climate change is a UN plot to “depopulate rural America”.

And Mercer’s cut checks 
<http://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/07/robert-mercer-the-most-important-political-money-man-youve-never-heard-of.html>
 for a veritable who’s-who of conservative darlings, from the Koch brothers’ 
Super Pac to current Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, from foreign policy hawk and 
perennial also-ran John Bolton to Ohio Senator Rob Portman, and from the 
fiscally conservative Club for Growth to the anti-abortion Women Speak Out Pac, 
an offshoot of the anti-abortion Susan B Anthony List. And he and his daughter 
were big, early backers of Senator Ted Cruz’s political ambitions, supporting 
his campaign and an affiliated Super Pac.

Interestingly, as Politico reported last year 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ted-cruz-donor-for-data-119813>, Mercer 
is reportedly an investor in Cambridge Analytics, which uses microtargeting and 
psychographic analysis to help campaigns – like Cruz’s – reach voters that its 
algorithms deem persuadable. Politico reported that “nearly 93 percent of the 
$2.6 million Cambridge Analytica has received in traceable federal payments has 
come from committees to which the Mercers donated generously”.

Microtargeting involves 
<http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/05/politics/voters-microtargeting/> collecting 
or buying a whole host of personally identifiable data – compiled from 
everything from tracking cookies monitoring people’s web habits to purchase 
data (sometime compiled using store discount cards) and responses to online 
surveys and petitions – and matching it with voter data to build detailed 
dossiers on voters to use in online and even mobile advertising. Cruz’s campaign
claimed 
<http://www.npr.org/2016/02/19/467395218/ted-cruz-campaign-takes-voter-micro-targeting-to-next-level>
 in an NPR interview to have 4,000 points of data on every single American 
voter because of Cambridge Analytics; the company told NPR that “hundreds of 
thousands” of Americans had taken their 120-point personality test.
 
OK, which family member had the brilliant idea for the Trump taco bowl tweet? 
Ivanka? Eric? Don Jr? Melania? Barron? Tiffany? Are we missing anyone?

The Huffington Post’s Howard Fineman captures the scene 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-manafort-unhappy-campaign_us_57b490f7e4b0edfa80daabf5?section=>
 in a report on the fall of Manafort:

Manafort had reason to know this from the start ― and reason to know that his 
advice would be ignored.

The taco bowl incident 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-taco-bowl_us_572bf20be4b096e9f090e1c5>
, trivial though it was, is one example. On Cinco de Mayo, Trump happened to be 
eating a taco bowl for lunch at his desk in Trump Tower. Manafort was in the 
office with other aides when a member of the family suggested they tweet a 
picture of Trump enjoying his “Mexican” lunch.

Manafort politely suggested that this might be seen as condescending and 
cautioned against it. The tweet went out. Trump himself was delighted by the 
resulting controversy. “The people who were offended were people we wanted to 
offend,” he later said.

Clinton alludes to the deckchair rearrangement on luxury liner Trump and says 
it does not matter:

He can hire and fire whoever he wants from his campaign. They can make him 
read new words from a teleprompter. But he is still the same man who insults 
gold star families, mocks people with disabilities and thinks he knows more 
about Isis than our generals. There is no newDonald Trump

The Guardian’s Lauren Gambino with the pool of reporters tracking Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> today in Manhattan. She spoke 
with Kellyanne Conway, the pollster promoted to campaign manager in the 
overnight Trump campaign shake-up.

“Now we see a number of voters who are not coming clean about their support 
for Donald Trump,” Conway tells Lauren.And don’t call it a shake-up:

“This is an expansion at an incredibly busy time, the last 12-week homestretch 
for the campaign. We look at personnel as more as more. With Paul continuing as 
our chairman and Rick Gates as his deputy, Stephen Bannon and I have been added 
to what I would call the “core four” of that senior team and we’re going to 
divide responsibilities according to our best an highest uses.”


Q: How will she and Bannon work together?

“Steve Bannon and I have tremendous respect for each other as colleagues and 
as friends and we also have the trust of Donald Trump the candidate. You first 
of all have the trust of the candidate and the latitude … We have different 
styles but we have one vision.”

She said she expects to hit the campaign field and TV circuit while Bannon 
mans the HQ at Trump Tower.

Q: Is the race over or just getting started?

“Two or three things we’ve all learned about Donald Trump is No 1: Don’t 
underestimate him. No 2: You know he exceeds expectations and No 3: he also 
exceeds the metrics that are usually at play, meaning he over performed many of 
his polling averages in the primaries and the caucuses. But now we see a number 
of voters who are not coming clean about their support for Donald Trump. I 
can’t find a single hidden Hilary Clinton voter in the country. I’ve been 
looking for him or her. They all seem to be out, proudly saying that their 
voting forHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>.

“In the case of Mr. Trump, the race isn’t over because August is not October 
let alone November.”

Q: How does Manafort fit in on the new team?:

“We would hope and expect Paul continues to do many of things he’s been doing. 
He’s just been doing the job of three or four people. We’re there to help him 
in that regard and he’s there to help us.”
 
Clinton has just taken the stage in Cleveland. Scroll back a couple blocks for 
the live video!
 
Just before appointing the head of a web site that traffics in racist 
conspiracy theories to run his campaign, Trump made a pitch, in a speech in 
Wisconsin last night, to African American voters.

“It’s time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes,” Trump said:

Good news for Donald Trump in Indiana, which succumbed in 2008 to the charms 
of Barack Obama: a new Monmouth poll has the Republican candidate 11 points 
ahead of rivalHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>. Trump’s running mate, 
Mike Pence, is the current Indiana governor.

The poll contains perhaps better news, though, for Democrats, for whom picking 
up the US senate seat being vacated by the retiring Republican Dan Coats is a 
crucial part of a plan to regain the senate majority.

Democrat Evan Bayh, a former Hoosier governor and senator, is seven points up 
on congressman Todd Young in the poll. Therehaven’t been
