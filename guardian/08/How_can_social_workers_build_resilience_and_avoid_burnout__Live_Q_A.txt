“I gained a stone in weight and regularly binged and comfort ate, finding 
there was no time to exercise as I used to. Many members of the team had 
similar experiences. In the end, it all became so overwhelming that I saw a 
psychotherapist for a couple of months prior to resigning. This helped 
crystallise why I was finding it so unbearable: my body was in physical revolt 
against an unrealistic to-do list that I could never catch up on, no matter how 
hard I tried.”

This is one social worker’s description 
<https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/mar/23/overwhelmed-new-social-worker-child-protection-workload>
 of how working in child protection affected their mental and physical health. 
It is a familiar tale: in the Guardian’s Social Lives research, 67% of social 
workers said they had been affected by stress and depression.

To help social workers deal with the stress and trauma of their job, building 
resilience is key. This can help ensure that social workers don’t burn out at 
an early stage of their career, and are able to continue working without 
suffering from work-related stress or mental health problems.

And there is value for this in employers, too; at a time when experienced 
social workers are in short supply, anything that helps people stay in the 
profession has to be considered.

To discuss some of these issues, we’ve put together a panel of experts from 
the social work sector. We’ll be talking about:

 * Strategies social workers can use to build resilience – from time 
management to mindfulness. 
 * The role employers have to play: what they can do to reduce workloads and 
improve morale. 
 * How healthy, resilient, supportive teams of social workers can be built. 
 * The role of managers and supervision. 
Building resilient social workers is everybody’s business
