 * One day after the first quarterly deadline since Hillary Clinton became the 
presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, the former secretary of state’s 
campaign has released its first fundraising numbers: $68.5 million for the 
month of June. Of the total amount raised by Clinton, roughly $40.5 million was 
made on behalf of her own campaign, with an additional $28 million raised for 
the Democratic National Committee and state parties. 
 * Donald Trump used funds from his nonprofit Donald J Trump foundation to buy 
a signed Tim Tebow football helmet for $12,000 at a charity auction, in a 
transaction that possibly violated IRS rules against self-dealing, the 
Washington Postreported 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/01/donald-trump-used-money-donated-for-charity-to-buy-himself-a-tim-tebow-signed-football-helmet/>
. Using nonprofit funds for personal use is generally illegal, although the 
legality of the football helmet transaction is unclear, according to three tax 
law experts interviewed by the Post. 
 * Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, acknowledged on Friday that her 
meeting with Bill Clinton this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/01/loretta-lynch-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-fbi-doj>
 had “cast a shadow” over the justice department’s investigation into Hillary 
Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Lynch 
said she would “fully accept” whatever recommendations were made by the FBI and 
prosecutors, but sought to quell concerns stemming from the encounter withBill 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton>, at an airport in 
Phoenix, reiterating that the justice department process for the email case 
remained wholly independent.

 * Kevin Kellems, a seasoned political operative brought aboard the Trump 
campaign on 20 June to oversee surrogates and coordinate their messaging, 
abruptly resigned from the position after less than two weeks. Kellems was 
director of communications for former vice presidentDick Cheney and worked on 
Newt Gingrich’s 2012 presidential campaign. In his resignation letter, quoted by
 <http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html> the 
New York Times, Kellems said he has “enjoyed meeting some fine and dedicated 
people.” 
 * According to the conservative Daily Caller 
<http://dailycaller.com/2016/07/01/exclusive-hillary-clinton-scheduled-to-meet-with-fbi-on-saturday/?utm_campaign=atdailycaller&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social>
, former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton will meet tomorrow with representatives from the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation. Up for discussion: the investigation into Clinton’s use of a 
private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Citing “a source 
close to the investigation,” the Daily Caller reports that the interview may be 
conducted at Clinton’s home in Washington, DC. The interview is likely “the 
final step” in the FBI’s investigation. Rep. Alan Grayson (@AlanGrayson)

One day after the first quarterly deadline since Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> became the presumptive 
Democratic presidential nominee, the former secretary of state’s campaign has

“More than 1.5 million grassroots donors have stepped up to say you’re 
committed to stoppingDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> - and to breaking the highest 
glass ceiling in America,” Clinton’s campaign stated in a release.

Of the total amount raised by Clinton, roughly $40.5 million was made on 
behalf of her own campaign, with an additional $28 million raised for the 
Democratic National Committee and state parties.

Democratic party releases draft of platform with $15 minimum wage

The Democratic party has released a draft of its national party platform 
<http://demconvention.com/platform/> online this afternoon. The first draft 
<https://demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016-DEMOCRATIC-PARTY-PLATFORM-DRAFT-7.1.16.pdf>
, which will be finalized at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia 
later this month, features a long wishlist of progressive policies, including a 
$15 national minimum wage, equal pay for women, a “multimillionaire surtax,” 
acknowledgment that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is controversial within the 
party and numerous other policy planks.

Luncheon. Photograph: ddp USA/REX/Shutterstock 
Some of the key proposals:

 * “We believe that Americans should earn at least $15 an hour and have the 
right to form or join a union. We applaud the approaches taken by states like 
New York and California. We shouldraise and index the minimum wage, give all 
Americans the ability to join a union regardless of where they work, and create 
new ways for workers to have power in the economy. We also support creating one 
fair wage for all workers by ending the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and 
people with disabilities.” 
 * “We will fight to secure equal pay for women and - after 240 years - finally
enshrine the rights of women in the constitution by passing the Equal Rights 
Amendment. While Donald Trump thinks it is ‘dangerous’ for women to leave the 
home and paid family leave hurts our economy, Democrats will make sure that the 
United States finally enactsnational paid family and medical leave by passing a 
family and medical leave act that would provide at least 12 weeks of paid leave 
to care for a new child or address a personal or family member’s serious health 
issue, and we will fight to allow workers the right to earn at least seven days 
of paid sick leave.” 
 * “Democrats will not hesitate to use and expand existing authorities as well 
asempower regulators to downsize or break apart financial institutions when 
necessary to protect the public and safeguard financial stability, including 
new authorities to go after risky shadow-banking activities. Banks should not 
be able to gamble with taxpayers’ deposits or pose an undue risk to Main 
Street.” 
 * “We will ask those at the top to contribute to our country’s future by 
establishing a multimillionaire surtax to ensure millionaires and billionaires 
pay their fair share.” 
 * “We will only approve new trade agreements if they support American jobs, 
raise wages, and improve our national security ... We should never enter into a 
trade agreement that prevents our government, or other governments, from 
putting in place rules that protect the environment, food safety, or the health 
of American citizens or others around the world.” 
 * “We will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned 
Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions 
of people. We will continue to oppose - and seek to overturn - federal and 
state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion, including by
repealing the Hyde Amendment.” 
 * “On the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), there are a diversity of views in 
the party. Many Democrats are on record stating that the agreement does not 
meet the standards set out in this platform; other Democrats have expressed 
support for the agreement. But all Democrats believe thatany trade agreement 
must protect workers and the environment and not undermine access to 
critically-needed prescription drugs.” 
 * “We will reform mandatory minimum sentences and close private prisons and 
detention centers ... We will invest in training for officers on issues such as 
de-escalation and the appropriate use of force, andencourage better 
police-community relations and the use of smart strategies like police body 
cameras. We will end racial profiling that targets individuals, based solely on 
race, religion, ethnicity, and national origin, which is un-American and 
counterproductive.” 
 * “We reject attempts to impose a religious test to bar immigrants or refugees
 from entering the United States. It is un-American and runs counter to the 
founding principles of this country.” 
 * “Democrats support a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme 
Court’s decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo. We need to end 
secret, unaccountable money in politics by requiring, through executive order 
or legislation, significantly more disclosure and transparency - by outside 
groups, federal contractors, and public corporations to their shareholders.” 
 * “Finally, Democrats will not stand for the divisive and derogatory language 
of Donald Trump. His offensive comments about immigrants and other communities 
have no place in our society. This kind of rhetoric must be rejected.”

Earlier this year, the Guardian sought out Bernie Sanders supporters who said 
they would rather vote for Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/bernie-sanders-supporters-consider-donald-trump-no-hillary-clinton>
. Surveys at the time suggested a small proportion of Sanders fans, 7%, were 
willing to make such a switch.

We decided to go back to 150 of the 500 or so supporters who contacted us to 
see if Britain’s decision to leave the European Union had made them more or 
less likely to favor the Republican Trump over the Democrat Clinton. Our 
thinking was that the economic and political turmoil caused by the success of a 
campaign based on nationalistic, anti-immigration sentiment led by a 
charismatic rightwing leader might have prompted some second thoughts.


Sanders penned an op-ed for the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/opinion/campaign-stops/bernie-sanders-democrats-need-to-wake-up.html>
 this week urging the Democrats to bring struggling working-class disaffected 
voters into the party fold rather than pushing them towards Trump. So what was 
this group of Sanders supporters thinking, post-Brexit?

About 50 responses were received. Some said they were no longer considering 
switching to Trump. About half backed Brexit, half opposed it.

Most of those who were still switching to Trump said they saw the Brexit 
result as vindication of their decision to back the Republican. Except in one 
case, those who opposed Brexit did not feel inspired to change their voting 
behavior in the wake of the UK’s decision.

“[The] outcome only concretes my vote for Trump, because I think in the long 
run it will do us good rather than harm, just like this Brexit vote,” wrote 
Peter Kartachian, a 34-year-old machinist from California. “These Chicken 
Littles who are claiming the world is ending because of this will soon be shown 
to be the empty suits that they are.”

In at least two cases, Brexit has flipped previously unsure voters into the 
Trump column. One New York woman, Janet H, who asked for her surname not to be 
used as she didn’t want her family to know she is backing Trump, said she’d 
been leaning towards the Republican candidate until his racist comments about a 
judge of Mexican origin led her to switch, begrudgingly, to Clinton. “Then 
Brexit happened,” said Janet H.

Former RNC chair: 'America can choose better than Trump'

Yet another Republican éminence grise has come out strongly against Donald 
Trump’s impending presidential nomination - this time, a former chair of the 
Republican National Committee itself.

Marc Racicot, a former governor of Montana and chair of the RNC, has published 
an editorial in the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/americans-can-choose-better-than-trump/2016/06/30/1db143c0-3efc-11e6-84e8-1580c7db5275_story.html?postshare=7411467401251445&tid=ss_tw>
 calling on “a second miracle in Cleveland” to prevent Trump’s accession to the 
party’s nomination, writing that the real estate mogul has “neither the 
aforementioned qualities of principled leadership, nor offered any substantive 
or serious conservative policy proposals” to merit the position.

“After long and careful consideration, I cannot endorse or support [the 
voters’] decision to express their frustration, anger and disappointment by 
selecting Trump as the Republican nominee for president,” Racicot wrote.

Trump, he said, has failed to demonstrate, among other things, “persistent 
seriousness, solemn and honest commitment to the interests of others, 
exhaustive study and detailed proposals, sincerity, humility, empathy, dignity, 
fairness, patience, genuine respect for all of God’s children, durability, 
modesty and the absence of self-interest.”

In addition, Racicot continued, Trump’s inconsistency with the Republican 
platform on a myriad of issues make him unsuitable for the nomination.

“Both, in my humble view, are indispensable preconditions to his selection as 
the Republican candidate for the office of president of the United States,” 
Racicot wrote. “As a result, I cannot endorse or support Trump for president.”

Eternal presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is using his vast email listserv 
to warn his supporters about labels on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in 
US food, kicking off with an email titled simply “Monsanto.”

“The corporate interests are at it again,” Sanders wrote. “Monsanto, 
agribusiness and the bio-tech industry have spent hundreds of millions of 
dollars trying to overturn legislation passed by Vermont, Connecticut, Maine 
and Alaska that calls for the labeling of GMO food. In fact, they are moving 
aggressively now because Vermont’s strong law goes into effect today.”

“This legislation is important because people have a right to know what is in 
the food they and their children eat. The more information we have, the better 
consumers we become. This is not a radical idea. It is why over 60 countries 
around the world have passed GMO labeling laws.”

Most scientific reports have indicated that GMOs are generally safe, both to 
humans and the environment, although Sanders has dismissed studies showing this 
as either too short-sighted or financially backed by agribusiness interests.

House minority leader Nancy Pelosi released a statement this afternoon 
condemning the decision by House Republicans to hold a vote on an amendment, 
rejected by the Senate, that fails to close what her office characterized as 
“the terrorist gun loophole”:

“All across America, families are demanding real action to keep guns out of 
the hands of criminals and suspected terrorists, not a toothless NRA bill that 
will do nothing to keep our communities safe,” Pelosi stated. “The American 
people cannot understand why Republicans want it to be easier for a suspected 
terrorist to buy a lethal weapon than to set foot on a plane. If you’re too 
dangerous to fly in America, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun in America – 
simple as that. But a month after the worst mass shooting in American history, 
House Republicans are once again putting the NRA ahead of their responsibility 
to keep the American people safe.”

Pelosi called the motion, submitted by Texas senator John Cornyn, “just the 
latest evidence that House Republicans have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
the NRA.”

Report: Hillary Clinton to meet with FBI on Saturday

According to the conservative Daily Caller 
<http://dailycaller.com/2016/07/01/exclusive-hillary-clinton-scheduled-to-meet-with-fbi-on-saturday/?utm_campaign=atdailycaller&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social>
, former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton will meet tomorrow with representatives from the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation. Up for discussion: the investigation into Clinton’s use of a 
private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.

Citing “a source close to the investigation,” the Daily Caller reports that 
the interview may be conducted at Clinton’s home in Washington, DC. The 
interview is likely “the final step” in the FBI’s investigation.

Federal officials have already interviewed top Clinton aides, including Cheryl 
Mills and Huma Abedin. It’s not known when the investigation will conclude. 
James Comey, the FBI’s director, has repeatedly said that there is no specific 
timeline for wrapping it up.

Trump is claiming credit for Nato developing an anti-terrorism unit.

“I’m not saying I’m an expert on Nato. Nobody ever asked me about Nato before. 
But I have a lot of common sense, and a lot of business sense.”

Trump has called Nato obsolete. He says he did not mean abandon it. He said he 
might have meant fix it. “It’s a different world. I see things that a lot of 
people don’t.”

Trump: Bill Clinton 'opened up a Pandora's Box'

Trump is on to the Bill Clinton - Loretta Lynch meeting. He questions whether 
the meeting was a coincidence and casts doubt on Lynch’s description of the 
conversation, which she said was about CLinton’s grandkids and golf.

Trump also drops a little news: all of his children and his wife will be 
speaking at the Republican convention.

“You see what happened where Bill Clinton goes into an airplane. He just 
happened to be at the airport,” Trump says.

“It’s not a joke. It’s a serious thing... As you know, Hillary is so guilty... 
how that’s not being pursued properly. I think he really opened it up. He 
opened up a Pandora’s Box and it shows what’s going on with our laws, with our 
government.”

Trump doubts Clinton’s presence at the airport was coincidental. And he wants 
to know how Lynch and Clinton spent their time together – it’s unknown how long 
they met for but it’s been described as a half-hour – what did they talk about?

Trump says he loves his grandchildren, “but if I talk about them for more than 
about nine or ten seconds ... after that, what are you gonna say, right? I love 
em. I love my children. My children are going to speaking at the convention... 
Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, Don... my wife is gonna be speaking at the convention.

“I love golf. But after talking about it for a couple of minutes, it’s hard to 
talk about it.”

Trump predicts unemployment if he loses

“We’re going to have job loss like you’ve never seen, ever before, if I don’t 
win.”

– Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>

Then Trump says he will expand the electoral map, by winning Ohio and 
Pennsylvania, but also, “we may even have a shot at New York and California” 
because “we have tremendous crowds” in those places.

“I think that we have a lot more leeway than anyone else running from the 
Republican party,” Trump says.

Everything he just said flies in the face of everything the polls are 
indicating.A Siena College poll 
<http://www.localsyr.com/news/poll-ethics-reforms-wont-stop-corruption-in-albany>
 in New York published Thursday depicted Clinton up 23 points on Trump in the 
state. But the polls could all be wrong.

Trump is talking about repealing and replacing Obamacare.

“I already talked about the fact that we’re going to save the second 
amendment, right? That’s a biggie.”

Trump says he’ll eliminate regulations, lower taxes and simplify the tax code.

“Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes – we’re lowering your taxes big 
league,” he says.

Or was that “bigly”?

He jokes that he’s getting used to the TelePrompters and he likes them.

“This is a tremendous crowd and we really appreciate it,” he says. 

Trump begins by talking about the delegates selection process in Colorado, 
where delegates were elected at a state convention dominated by Ted Cruz. “All 
of a sudden I didn’t get the delegates,” he says. “The system’s rigged. It’s 
rigged. It’s rigged against the people.”

Trump quotes Fox host Bill O’Reilly as saying that his political movement is 
the “single greatest phenomena” that O’Reilly has seen in his lifetime.

Trump: "Wow, that's a lot of phenomenons you've seen."

 * One day after the first quarterly deadline since Hillary Clinton became the 
presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, the former secretary of state’s 
campaign has released its first fundraising numbers: $68.5 million for the 
month of June. Of the total amount raised by Clinton, roughly $40.5 million was 
made on behalf of her own campaign, with an additional $28 million raised for 
the Democratic National Committee and state parties. 
 * Donald Trump used funds from his nonprofit Donald J Trump foundation to buy 
a signed Tim Tebow football helmet for $12,000 at a charity auction, in a 
transaction that possibly violated IRS rules against self-dealing, the 
Washington Postreported 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/01/donald-trump-used-money-donated-for-charity-to-buy-himself-a-tim-tebow-signed-football-helmet/>
. Using nonprofit funds for personal use is generally illegal, although the 
legality of the football helmet transaction is unclear, according to three tax 
law experts interviewed by the Post. 
 * Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, acknowledged on Friday that her 
meeting with Bill Clinton this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/01/loretta-lynch-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-fbi-doj>
 had “cast a shadow” over the justice department’s investigation into Hillary 
Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Lynch 
said she would “fully accept” whatever recommendations were made by the FBI and 
prosecutors, but sought to quell concerns stemming from the encounter withBill 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton>, at an airport in 
Phoenix, reiterating that the justice department process for the email case 
remained wholly independent.

 * Kevin Kellems, a seasoned political operative brought aboard the Trump 
campaign on 20 June to oversee surrogates and coordinate their messaging, 
abruptly resigned from the position after less than two weeks. Kellems was 
director of communications for former vice presidentDick Cheney and worked on 
Newt Gingrich’s 2012 presidential campaign. In his resignation letter, quoted by
 <http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html> the 
New York Times, Kellems said he has “enjoyed meeting some fine and dedicated 
people.”

<http://dailycaller.com/2016/07/01/exclusive-hillary-clinton-scheduled-to-meet-with-fbi-on-saturday/?utm_campaign=atdailycaller&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social>
, former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton will meet tomorrow with representatives from the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation. Up for discussion: the investigation into Clinton’s use of a 
private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Citing “a source 
close to the investigation,” the Daily Caller reports that the interview may be 
conducted at Clinton’s home in Washington, DC. The interview is likely “the 
final step” in the FBI’s investigation. Rep. Alan Grayson (@AlanGrayson)

Some of the key proposals:

 * “We believe that Americans should earn at least $15 an hour and have the 
right to form or join a union. We applaud the approaches taken by states like 
New York and California. We shouldraise and index the minimum wage, give all 
Americans the ability to join a union regardless of where they work, and create 
new ways for workers to have power in the economy. We also support creating one 
fair wage for all workers by ending the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and 
people with disabilities.” 
 * “We will fight to secure equal pay for women and - after 240 years - finally
enshrine the rights of women in the constitution by passing the Equal Rights 
Amendment. While Donald Trump thinks it is ‘dangerous’ for women to leave the 
home and paid family leave hurts our economy, Democrats will make sure that the 
United States finally enactsnational paid family and medical leave by passing a 
family and medical leave act that would provide at least 12 weeks of paid leave 
to care for a new child or address a personal or family member’s serious health 
issue, and we will fight to allow workers the right to earn at least seven days 
of paid sick leave.” 
 * “Democrats will not hesitate to use and expand existing authorities as well 
asempower regulators to downsize or break apart financial institutions when 
necessary to protect the public and safeguard financial stability, including 
new authorities to go after risky shadow-banking activities. Banks should not 
be able to gamble with taxpayers’ deposits or pose an undue risk to Main 
Street.” 
 * “We will ask those at the top to contribute to our country’s future by 
establishing a multimillionaire surtax to ensure millionaires and billionaires 
pay their fair share.” 
 * “We will only approve new trade agreements if they support American jobs, 
raise wages, and improve our national security ... We should never enter into a 
trade agreement that prevents our government, or other governments, from 
putting in place rules that protect the environment, food safety, or the health 
of American citizens or others around the world.” 
 * “We will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned 
Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions 
of people. We will continue to oppose - and seek to overturn - federal and 
state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion, including by
repealing the Hyde Amendment.” 
 * “On the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), there are a diversity of views in 
the party. Many Democrats are on record stating that the agreement does not 
meet the standards set out in this platform; other Democrats have expressed 
support for the agreement. But all Democrats believe thatany trade agreement 
must protect workers and the environment and not undermine access to 
critically-needed prescription drugs.” 
 * “We will reform mandatory minimum sentences and close private prisons and 
detention centers ... We will invest in training for officers on issues such as 
de-escalation and the appropriate use of force, andencourage better 
police-community relations and the use of smart strategies like police body 
cameras. We will end racial profiling that targets individuals, based solely on 
race, religion, ethnicity, and national origin, which is un-American and 
counterproductive.” 
 * “We reject attempts to impose a religious test to bar immigrants or refugees
 from entering the United States. It is un-American and runs counter to the 
founding principles of this country.” 
 * “Democrats support a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme 
Court’s decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo. We need to end 
secret, unaccountable money in politics by requiring, through executive order 
or legislation, significantly more disclosure and transparency - by outside 
groups, federal contractors, and public corporations to their shareholders.” 
 * “Finally, Democrats will not stand for the divisive and derogatory language 
of Donald Trump. His offensive comments about immigrants and other communities 
have no place in our society. This kind of rhetoric must be rejected.”  
Earlier this year, the Guardian sought out Bernie Sanders supporters who said 
they would rather vote for Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/bernie-sanders-supporters-consider-donald-trump-no-hillary-clinton>
. Surveys at the time suggested a small proportion of Sanders fans, 7%, were 
willing to make such a switch.

We decided to go back to 150 of the 500 or so supporters who contacted us to 
see if Britain’s decision to leave the European Union had made them more or 
less likely to favor the Republican Trump over the Democrat Clinton. Our 
thinking was that the economic and political turmoil caused by the success of a 
campaign based on nationalistic, anti-immigration sentiment led by a 
charismatic rightwing leader might have prompted some second thoughts.


Sanders penned an op-ed for the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/opinion/campaign-stops/bernie-sanders-democrats-need-to-wake-up.html>
 this week urging the Democrats to bring struggling working-class disaffected 
voters into the party fold rather than pushing them towards Trump. So what was 
this group of Sanders supporters thinking, post-Brexit?

About 50 responses were received. Some said they were no longer considering 
switching to Trump. About half backed Brexit, half opposed it.

Most of those who were still switching to Trump said they saw the Brexit 
result as vindication of their decision to back the Republican. Except in one 
case, those who opposed Brexit did not feel inspired to change their voting 
behavior in the wake of the UK’s decision.

“[The] outcome only concretes my vote for Trump, because I think in the long 
run it will do us good rather than harm, just like this Brexit vote,” wrote 
Peter Kartachian, a 34-year-old machinist from California. “These Chicken 
Littles who are claiming the world is ending because of this will soon be shown 
to be the empty suits that they are.”

In at least two cases, Brexit has flipped previously unsure voters into the 
Trump column. One New York woman, Janet H, who asked for her surname not to be 
used as she didn’t want her family to know she is backing Trump, said she’d 
been leaning towards the Republican candidate until his racist comments about a 
judge of Mexican origin led her to switch, begrudgingly, to Clinton. “Then 
Brexit happened,” said Janet H.

The Sanders voters who are backing Trump: has Brexit changed their minds?

Yet another Republican éminence grise has come out strongly against Donald 
Trump’s impending presidential nomination - this time, a former chair of the 
Republican National Committee itself.

Marc Racicot, a former governor of Montana and chair of the RNC, has published 
an editorial in the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/americans-can-choose-better-than-trump/2016/06/30/1db143c0-3efc-11e6-84e8-1580c7db5275_story.html?postshare=7411467401251445&tid=ss_tw>
 calling on “a second miracle in Cleveland” to prevent Trump’s accession to the 
party’s nomination, writing that the real estate mogul has “neither the 
aforementioned qualities of principled leadership, nor offered any substantive 
or serious conservative policy proposals” to merit the position.

“After long and careful consideration, I cannot endorse or support [the 
voters’] decision to express their frustration, anger and disappointment by 
selecting Trump as the Republican nominee for president,” Racicot wrote.

Trump, he said, has failed to demonstrate, among other things, “persistent 
seriousness, solemn and honest commitment to the interests of others, 
exhaustive study and detailed proposals, sincerity, humility, empathy, dignity, 
fairness, patience, genuine respect for all of God’s children, durability, 
modesty and the absence of self-interest.”

In addition, Racicot continued, Trump’s inconsistency with the Republican 
platform on a myriad of issues make him unsuitable for the nomination.

“Both, in my humble view, are indispensable preconditions to his selection as 
the Republican candidate for the office of president of the United States,” 
Racicot wrote. “As a result, I cannot endorse or support Trump for president.”
 
Eternal presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is using his vast email listserv 
to warn his supporters about labels on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in 
US food, kicking off with an email titled simply “Monsanto.”

“The corporate interests are at it again,” Sanders wrote. “Monsanto, 
agribusiness and the bio-tech industry have spent hundreds of millions of 
dollars trying to overturn legislation passed by Vermont, Connecticut, Maine 
and Alaska that calls for the labeling of GMO food. In fact, they are moving 
aggressively now because Vermont’s strong law goes into effect today.”

“This legislation is important because people have a right to know what is in 
the food they and their children eat. The more information we have, the better 
consumers we become. This is not a radical idea. It is why over 60 countries 
around the world have passed GMO labeling laws.”

Most scientific reports have indicated that GMOs are generally safe, both to 
humans and the environment, although Sanders has dismissed studies showing this 
as either too short-sighted or financially backed by agribusiness interests.
 
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi released a statement this afternoon 
condemning the decision by House Republicans to hold a vote on an amendment, 
rejected by the Senate, that fails to close what her office characterized as 
“the terrorist gun loophole”:

“All across America, families are demanding real action to keep guns out of 
the hands of criminals and suspected terrorists, not a toothless NRA bill that 
will do nothing to keep our communities safe,” Pelosi stated. “The American 
people cannot understand why Republicans want it to be easier for a suspected 
terrorist to buy a lethal weapon than to set foot on a plane. If you’re too 
dangerous to fly in America, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun in America – 
simple as that. But a month after the worst mass shooting in American history, 
House Republicans are once again putting the NRA ahead of their responsibility 
to keep the American people safe.”

Pelosi called the motion, submitted by Texas senator John Cornyn, “just the 
latest evidence that House Republicans have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
the NRA.”

According to the conservative Daily Caller 
<http://dailycaller.com/2016/07/01/exclusive-hillary-clinton-scheduled-to-meet-with-fbi-on-saturday/?utm_campaign=atdailycaller&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social>
, former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton will meet tomorrow with representatives from the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation. Up for discussion: the investigation into Clinton’s use of a 
private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.

Citing “a source close to the investigation,” the Daily Caller reports that 
the interview may be conducted at Clinton’s home in Washington, DC. The 
interview is likely “the final step” in the FBI’s investigation.

Federal officials have already interviewed top Clinton aides, including Cheryl 
Mills and Huma Abedin. It’s not known when the investigation will conclude. 
James Comey, the FBI’s director, has repeatedly said that there is no specific 
timeline for wrapping it up.
 
Maria La Ganga is inside the Western conservative summit for the Guardian – 
and reports that the amazing crowd Trump has been boasting about from the stage 
is actually quite sparse:

Trump is claiming credit for Nato developing an anti-terrorism unit.

“I’m not saying I’m an expert on Nato. Nobody ever asked me about Nato before. 
But I have a lot of common sense, and a lot of business sense.”

Trump has called Nato obsolete. He says he did not mean abandon it. He said he 
might have meant fix it. “It’s a different world. I see things that a lot of 
people don’t.”
 
Trump is on to the Bill Clinton - Loretta Lynch meeting. He questions whether 
the meeting was a coincidence and casts doubt on Lynch’s description of the 
conversation, which she said was about CLinton’s grandkids and golf.

Trump also drops a little news: all of his children and his wife will be 
speaking at the Republican convention.

“You see what happened where Bill Clinton goes into an airplane. He just 
happened to be at the airport,” Trump says.

“It’s not a joke. It’s a serious thing... As you know, Hillary is so guilty... 
how that’s not being pursued properly. I think he really opened it up. He 
opened up a Pandora’s Box and it shows what’s going on with our laws, with our 
government.”

Trump doubts Clinton’s presence at the airport was coincidental. And he wants 
to know how Lynch and Clinton spent their time together – it’s unknown how long 
they met for but it’s been described as a half-hour – what did they talk about?

Trump says he loves his grandchildren, “but if I talk about them for more than 
about nine or ten seconds ... after that, what are you gonna say, right? I love 
em. I love my children. My children are going to speaking at the convention... 
Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, Don... my wife is gonna be speaking at the convention.

talk about it.”
 
“We’re going to have job loss like you’ve never seen, ever before, if I don’t 
win.”

Then Trump says he will expand the electoral map, by winning Ohio and 
Pennsylvania, but also, “we may even have a shot at New York and California” 
because “we have tremendous crowds” in those places.

“I think that we have a lot more leeway than anyone else running from the 
Republican party,” Trump says.

Everything he just said flies in the face of everything the polls are 
indicating.A Siena College poll 
<http://www.localsyr.com/news/poll-ethics-reforms-wont-stop-corruption-in-albany>

This is true.

Trump is talking about repealing and replacing Obamacare.

“I already talked about the fact that we’re going to save the second 
amendment, right? That’s a biggie.”

Trump says he’ll eliminate regulations, lower taxes and simplify the tax code.

“Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes – we’re lowering your taxes big 
league,” he says.

Or was that “bigly”?

We definitely heard “big league” that time, after most always hearing “bigly”. 
 
Trump begins: “Oh if I’d have known they had these TelePrompters I would’ve 
used them.”

He jokes that he’s getting used to the TelePrompters and he likes them.

“This is a tremendous crowd and we really appreciate it,” he says. 

Trump begins by talking about the delegates selection process in Colorado, 
where delegates were elected at a state convention dominated by Ted Cruz. “All 
of a sudden I didn’t get the delegates,” he says. “The system’s rigged. It’s 
rigged. It’s rigged against the people.”

Trump quotes Fox host Bill O’Reilly as saying that his political movement is 
the “single greatest phenomena” that O’Reilly has seen in his lifetime.
