In a speech to supporters on Tuesday night, Trump derided Serge Kovaleski 
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/serge_f_kovaleski/index.html>
 – a reporter for the newspaper who has disputedTrump’s claim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/23/donald-trump-accused-of-hate-campaign-after-claiming-thousands-cheered-on-911>
 that “thousands” of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the 9/11 attacks – while 
flailing and twisting his arms.

Kovaleski has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition that affects joint 
movement.

In 2001, he was a journalist at the Washington Post and one of the authors of 
a reportcited by Trump 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/668867262456156160> in defence of 
his 9/11 claim. (The Washington Post has sinceadded a disclaimer 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/09/18/northern-new-jersey-draws-probers-eyes/40f82ea4-e015-4d6e-a87e-93aa433fafdc/>
 to the report, distancing it from the claims.)

The 2001 report said that “law enforcement authorities [in Jersey City] 
detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating 
the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops”.

In the wake of Trump’s insistence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/23/donald-trump-accused-of-hate-campaign-after-claiming-thousands-cheered-on-911>
 that “thousands and thousands of people were cheering” as the World Trade 
Center was destroyed, Kovaleski this week said he did not recall “anyone saying 
there were thousands, or even hundreds, of people celebrating”.

“We did a lot of shoe leather reporting in and around Jersey City and talked 
to a lot of residents and officials for the broader story. Much of that has, 
indeed, faded from memory.

“I do not recall anyone saying there were thousands, or even hundreds, of 
people celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember,” hetold 
CNN 
<http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/23/politics/donald-trump-new-jersey-cheering-september-11/>
.

On Tuesday evening, at a rally in South Carolina, Trump tore into this 
account, telling supporters: “Now the poor guy. You ought to see the guy: ‘Err, 
I don’t know what I said. I don’t remember.’


“He’s going: ‘I don’t remember. Maybe that’s what I said.’”

As he spoke, Trump waved his arms around and held his hand in front of his 
chest in a claw-like position.

“The sad part about it is, it didn’t in the slightest bit jar or surprise me 
that Donald Trump would do something this low-rent, given his track record,”

A spokesperson for the New York Times told Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-mocks-new-york-times-reporter-serge-kovaleski-216219>
: “We think it’s outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our 
reporters.”

Trump has not commented directly on his latest controversy, but on Wednesday 
sentseveral <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/669689398112460800>
