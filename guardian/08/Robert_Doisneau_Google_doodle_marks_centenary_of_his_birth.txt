His photographs once adorned the walls of student residences everywhere but 
now on the centenary of his birth, 14 April, Robert Doisneau, the French 
photographer, is himself the latest subject of Google's homepage, theGoogle 
doodle <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google-doodle>.

Doisneau was born on 14 April 1912 and is best known for the photograph, "The 
Kiss by the Town Hall" in which in a young couple, oblivious to the bustle 
around them kiss. The photograph, which has the Paris town hall in the back 
ground and the tables of a cafe in the foreground, has been reproduced on cards 
and posters.

It was first published in Life magazine in 1950 and Doisneau allowed people to 
think that it was not a staged photograph. One couple, believing they were 
featured kissing in the photograph, sued the photographer. In court, Doisneau 
revealed that it was another couple who he had seen kissing and then asked them 
to model for him. He then took them to a series of locations in Paris. The 
couple who wrongly believed they were in the photograph lost their claim.

Doisneau's speciality was street photos and he avoided fashion or other forms 
of reportage. He was awarded a series of prizes for his work and he died in 
1994.
