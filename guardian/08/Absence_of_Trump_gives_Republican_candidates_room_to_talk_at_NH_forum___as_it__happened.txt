The Voters First presidential forum Is over

Ben Jacobs

 * Speed dating might not be the worst way to meet a future spouse but it’s a 
terrible way to meet a future president.The hurried format made it difficult 
for most candidates to even get through their talking points, let alone say 
anything original. 
 * No Trump, No Attacks. In the absence of Donald Trump, the forum was 
remarkably civil. On the rare occasions that candidates mentioned their 
opponents, it was to praise them. 
 * Follow-ups are important. With a rushed format and less than aggressive 
moderator, candidates could easily ignore most questions. 
 * The RNC has real power this cycle. The peculiar format tonight was only due 
to RNC rules which banned candidates from appearing in “sanctioned debates” if 
they appeared in unsanctioned debates. If two candidates appeared on stage at 
the same time answering questions that would be “unsanctioned.” The result was 
a messy evening that did little to help voters but reaffirmed the kingmaking 
role of the national party.

Jeb's final thoughts

Jeb Lund

I plunked my son in front of the television to try to share the good news, but 
he crawled away from the GOP message, crossed the room, went to the bookshelf 
and grabbed this biography of PG Wodehouse. A European. This is your future, 
America. It’s already over.

The forum has finally ended

Not sure how much voters learned in the rather rushed periods that candidates 
had on stage but one gets the feeling that the debate in Cleveland could be 
quite interesting once Donald Trump shows up.

Fiorina: “We have to have the strongest military on the face of the earth, and 
everyone has to know it.” So essentially the problem our military faces right 
now is brand awareness.

She also just explained that she started as a secretary and went on to become

Margaret Thatcher, the daughter of a grocer. Okay.

 * Speed dating might not be the worst way to meet a future spouse but it’s a 
terrible way to meet a future president.The hurried format made it difficult 
for most candidates to even get through their talking points, let alone say 
anything original. 
 * No Trump, No Attacks. In the absence of Donald Trump, the forum was 
remarkably civil. On the rare occasions that candidates mentioned their 
opponents, it was to praise them. 
 * Follow-ups are important. With a rushed format and less than aggressive 
moderator, candidates could easily ignore most questions. 
 * The RNC has real power this cycle. The peculiar format tonight was only due 
to RNC rules which banned candidates from appearing in “sanctioned debates” if 
they appeared in unsanctioned debates. If two candidates appeared on stage at 
the same time answering questions that would be “unsanctioned.” The result was 
a messy evening that did little to help voters but reaffirmed the kingmaking 
role of the national party.  
I plunked my son in front of the television to try to share the good news, but 
he crawled away from the GOP message, crossed the room, went to the bookshelf 
and grabbed this biography of PG Wodehouse. A European. This is your future, 
America. It’s already over.

Not sure how much voters learned in the rather rushed periods that candidates 
had on stage but one gets the feeling that the debate in Cleveland could be 
quite interesting once Donald Trump shows up.
