Alas, it is not the case that “all citizens in the north of Ireland are 
entitled to an Irish and therefore an EU passport” (Northern Ireland court to 
test Brexit veto bid

, 5 October). People born in Northern Ireland enjoy such an entitlement, but 
those of us who moved here, even if we are long-term residents, do not. Our 
children, if born in Northern Ireland, are entitled to an Irish passport, as 
are those born in Northern Ireland who have long left. These people can look 
forward to retaining their EU citizenship rights post-Brexit. Unless there is a 
change of policy on the part of the Irish government, however, we “blow-ins” 
must remain content with the passport we had in our pocket when we arrived.
