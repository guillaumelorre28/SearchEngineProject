Another day in American political chaos

On the streets of Chicago, scenes of violence and chaos unparalleled in the 
recent history of American political campaigning have unfolded since Donald 
Trump’s campaign announced the postponement of a rally in America’s “Second 
City.”
Scott Bixby (@scottbix) 
This is unbelievable. pic.twitter.com/upV2ewROwL <https://t.co/upV2ewROwL>

<https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/708499144474824705> 
The cancellation of the rally due to “safety concerns” created unruly scenes 
inside the Chicago Pavilion of the University of Illinois and in the street 
outside. Scuffles and fights broke out between Trump supporters, protesters and 
police, and a number of arrests were made, including of at least one reporter. 
As mayhem took place in Chicago, Trump took to the airwaves to tell his side of 
the story, telling MSNBC: “It’s sad when you can’t have a rally. Whatever 
happened to freedom of speech?”

There is a long history of violence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/donald-trump-campaign-claims-violence-rallies>
 at Trump events. In the past week alone, an attack on a non-violent protester 
led to criminal charges against a Trump supporter and Michelle Fields, a 
reporter for conservative website Breitbart News, was allegedly assaulted by 
Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s campaign manager.

Trump has played a role in encouraging this culture of violence. When the 
Republican frontrunner appeared in St. Louis earlier on Friday, an event that 
featured more than 30 arrests, he complained “part of the problem and part of 
the reason it takes so long [to kick protesters out] is nobody wants to hurt 
each other anymore.” Trump added “There used to be consequences. There are none 
anymore. These people are so bad for our country. You have no idea folks, you 
have no idea.”

candidate Donald Trump at the University of Illinois at Chicago would be

The scenes of violence sparked condemnation from Trump’s top rival for the GOP 
nomination, Texas senatorTed Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>
. “A campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment,” said Cruz at a 
press conference. “The predictable consequence of [Trump’s comments] is it 
escalates. Today is unlikely to be the last such instance.”

In a statement, Ohio governor John Kasich echoed this condemnation. “Tonight 
the seeds of division thatDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has been sowing this whole 
campaign finally bore fruit, and it was ugly.”

Political violence on the scale witnessed on Friday is rare in American 
politics. Famously, the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago 
witnessed repeated clashes between the police and anti-war protesters 
culminating in what a federal commission called “a police riot.” But the 
three-way conflict between Trump supporters and protesters with the police 
caught in the middle is something unusual and represents a disturbing trend in 
an election where many of the norms and mores of American politics have already 
gone by the wayside.

In the meantime though, the protesters had outwardly succeeded in their goal 
for the evening. As one, Violet Ornelas, 28, gleefully proclaimed the Guardian: 
“If he can’t even handle Chicago, what makes think he could handle Isis?”

Reporting live from the Chicago Pavilion at the University of Illinois, the 
Guardian’sBen Jacobs, Zach Stafford and Ciara McCarthy write that the scene of 
Donald Trump’s aborted rally is tense.

Pavilion. Photograph: Jonathan Gibby/Getty Images 
Outside, more than a thousand protesters gathered, shutting down the streets. 
Chanting “We are not tired”, they blocked a street intersection and set up a 
microphone and speakers. Police helicopters whirled overhead in an outbreak of 
political violence unprecedented, in Chicago at least, since 1968 Democratic 
National Convention.

Trump, who repeated previous criticisms of protesters at his rally as 
“extremely dangerous and extremely physical”, made the connection himself, 
telling MSNBC: “I think a lot of people said that it was wrong that we were 
really stopped from holding a rally. It didn’t have to be stopped.

“But if we held it people would’ve potentially been hurt and I didn’t want to 
see people hurt. Chicago’s the home of some very very bad rallies. Just look 
back at the conventions here … people were killed.”

At the venue, one protester gleefully mocked Trump. Violet Ornelas, 28, told 
the Guardian: “If he can’t even handle Chicago, what makes think he could 
handle Isis?”

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told Fox News’ 
Sean Hannity that he was glad he canceled his rally in Chicago:

We’re very conscious of the fact that we don’t want anybody to be hurt ... 
Tonight, virtually nobody is even hurt. We made a very good decision ... We 
worked very closely with law enforcement and they gave us some really good 
advice.

Trump also argued that the coverage of the conflicts has been biased against 
him:

It’s a lot easier for people in life to be a liberal democrat. You have a 
double standard like nobody can believe. If conservatives and republicans ever 
did that to a liberal rally, it would be a national disgrace. It would be all 
over every paper for weeks.

Trump further claimed that generally his protesters are the violent ones – not 
his supporters. “In some cases, they are being very violent ... I see it, 
because I’m making a speech. I’m on the platform. I’m able to see it. I see 
some people that are really bad. They’re bad dudes.”

If Trump supporters hit protesters, it’s usually self defense, he added: “When 
the punches are thrown back, it’s always their fault. It’s so unfair.”

Rubio, Cruz address Trump rally violence

Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have now both blamed Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> for the violence that erupted 
at his Chicago rally. Rubio, speaking by phone to Fox’s Megyn Kelly, said:

He most certainly in other events has in the past used some pretty rough 
language in encouraging the crowds ... He bears some responsibility for the 
general tone.

Rubio also cast blame on the anti-Trump protesters, saying, “Clearly, this is 
an orchestrated effort ... It reflects very poorly on this country. I’m very 
sad for this country.” He added: “This is Chicago. Protesters are an industry 
... Chicago is kind of a hub for that.”

Talking to reporters shortly after, Ted Cruz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz> said:

A campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment ... The 
predictable consequence of [Trump’s comments] is it escalates. Today is 
unlikely to be the last such instance.

Cruz added: “We saw earlier today in St Louis over 30 arrested. That’s not how 
our politics should occur.”

He also took the opportunity to also blame the tensions on Obama, saying, 
“We’ve seen for seven years a president who often in times of crisis has sought 
to divide us ... on racial lines, on ethnic lines, on religious lines, on class 
lines. America is better than that. We don’t have to tear each other apart. 
Instead, we can work together.”

Our live coverage of the extraordinary scenes in Chicago has come to a close 
but you can read thefull report here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-rally-called-off-in-chicago-amid-protests-violence-and-chaos>
 by our reporters filing straight from the scene.

Here is a quick summary of the day’s events on the campaign trail:

• Protesters in Chicago have forced the shutdown of a Donald Trump rally 
before it even began. Heated scenes that simmered between anti-Trump 
demonstrators and his supporters at the University of Illinois Chicago Pavilion 
boiled over when the campaignannounced he would not be appearing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-rally-called-off-in-chicago-amid-protests-violence-and-chaos>
, citing safety concerns

• Earlier a Trump rally in St Louis also gave rise to scenes of violence and 
disorder, with police making 32 arrests and at least one person leftbloodied 
and needing an ambulance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/trump-rally-st-louis-violence-racial-slurs>


• Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, had to backtrack after comments at Nancy 
Reagan’s funeral that appeared to gloss over the Reagans’troubling legacy in 
the fight against HIV/Aids 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/hillary-clinton-comments-reagan-aids-crisis-backlash>

• Bernie Sanders received a boost when a judge gave the go-ahead for 
17-year-olds tovote in the Ohio primary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/ohio-17-year-olds-can-vote-primary-bernie-sanders>
 
On the streets of Chicago, scenes of violence and chaos unparalleled in the 
recent history of American political campaigning have unfolded since Donald 
Trump’s campaign announced the postponement of a rally in America’s “Second 
City.”

<https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/708499144474824705> 
The cancellation of the rally due to “safety concerns” created unruly scenes 
inside the Chicago Pavilion of the University of Illinois and in the street 
outside. Scuffles and fights broke out between Trump supporters, protesters and 
police, and a number of arrests were made, including of at least one reporter. 
As mayhem took place in Chicago, Trump took to the airwaves to tell his side of 
the story, telling MSNBC: “It’s sad when you can’t have a rally. Whatever 
happened to freedom of speech?”

There is a long history of violence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/donald-trump-campaign-claims-violence-rallies>
 at Trump events. In the past week alone, an attack on a non-violent protester 
led to criminal charges against a Trump supporter and Michelle Fields, a 
reporter for conservative website Breitbart News, was allegedly assaulted by 
Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s campaign manager.

Trump has played a role in encouraging this culture of violence. When the 
Republican frontrunner appeared in St. Louis earlier on Friday, an event that 
featured more than 30 arrests, he complained “part of the problem and part of 
the reason it takes so long [to kick protesters out] is nobody wants to hurt 
each other anymore.” Trump added “There used to be consequences. There are none 
anymore. These people are so bad for our country. You have no idea folks, you 
have no idea.”

The scenes of violence sparked condemnation from Trump’s top rival for the GOP 
nomination, Texas senatorTed Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz>
. “A campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment,” said Cruz at a 
press conference. “The predictable consequence of [Trump’s comments] is it 
escalates. Today is unlikely to be the last such instance.”

In a statement, Ohio governor John Kasich echoed this condemnation. “Tonight 
the seeds of division thatDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has been sowing this whole 
campaign finally bore fruit, and it was ugly.”

Political violence on the scale witnessed on Friday is rare in American 
politics. Famously, the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago 
witnessed repeated clashes between the police and anti-war protesters 
culminating in what a federal commission called “a police riot.” But the 
three-way conflict between Trump supporters and protesters with the police 
caught in the middle is something unusual and represents a disturbing trend in 
an election where many of the norms and mores of American politics have already 
gone by the wayside.

In the meantime though, the protesters had outwardly succeeded in their goal 
for the evening. As one, Violet Ornelas, 28, gleefully proclaimed the Guardian: 
“If he can’t even handle Chicago, what makes think he could handle Isis?”
 
Onetime presidential candidate and former speaker of the house of 
representatives Newt Gingrich believes that tonight’s events in Chicago are the 
result of fascism - liberal fascism, particularly.

Republican presidential candidate and Ohio governor John Kasich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich> has released a statement 
regarding tonight’s events in Chicago, blaming the unrest on “the seeds of 
division” sown by the Trump campaign:

Reporting live from the Chicago Pavilion at the University of Illinois, the 
Guardian’sBen Jacobs, Zach Stafford and Ciara McCarthy write that the scene of 
Donald Trump’s aborted rally is tense.

Outside, more than a thousand protesters gathered, shutting down the streets. 
Chanting “We are not tired”, they blocked a street intersection and set up a 
microphone and speakers. Police helicopters whirled overhead in an outbreak of 
political violence unprecedented, in Chicago at least, since 1968 Democratic 
National Convention.

Trump, who repeated previous criticisms of protesters at his rally as 
“extremely dangerous and extremely physical”, made the connection himself, 
telling MSNBC: “I think a lot of people said that it was wrong that we were 
really stopped from holding a rally. It didn’t have to be stopped.

“But if we held it people would’ve potentially been hurt and I didn’t want to 
see people hurt. Chicago’s the home of some very very bad rallies. Just look 
back at the conventions here … people were killed.”

At the venue, one protester gleefully mocked Trump. Violet Ornelas, 28, told 
the Guardian: “If he can’t even handle Chicago, what makes think he could 
handle Isis?”

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told Fox News’ 
Sean Hannity that he was glad he canceled his rally in Chicago:

We’re very conscious of the fact that we don’t want anybody to be hurt ... 
Tonight, virtually nobody is even hurt. We made a very good decision ... We 
worked very closely with law enforcement and they gave us some really good 
advice.

Trump also argued that the coverage of the conflicts has been biased against 
him:

It’s a lot easier for people in life to be a liberal democrat. You have a 
double standard like nobody can believe. If conservatives and republicans ever 
did that to a liberal rally, it would be a national disgrace. It would be all 
over every paper for weeks.

Trump further claimed that generally his protesters are the violent ones – not 
his supporters. “In some cases, they are being very violent ... I see it, 
because I’m making a speech. I’m on the platform. I’m able to see it. I see 
some people that are really bad. They’re bad dudes.”

If Trump supporters hit protesters, it’s usually self defense, he added: “When 
the punches are thrown back, it’s always their fault. It’s so unfair.”
