STUMPS - Pakistan 382-8 (Shafiq 100, Yasir 4)

Adam Collins

There was a moment about 40 minutes into the three hour, five minute final 
session when we all had a good laugh. CA popped a statement out saying that day 
five would be free. Admirable sentiment, but come on. Let’s get serious. This 
is finishing tonight. Of course it is. Pakistan are plucky, but notthat plucky. 
Not when they are slashing at everything. Giving it their best, but giving 
chances. Not when Josh Hazlewood is bowling as well as that. Not when having to 
prevail for that long after dark; a time that’s meant to be near-on impossible 
to survive the pink ball. Not a lower order. No. No way. No.

Well, here we are. And in the most dramatic final over - coming after the most 
glorious extra half-hour - Asad Shafiq raised his 10th Test ton. Not with a 
classical stroke, but a slap. It was in keeping with the hours that they had 
been. With Sarfraz early, who as dropped by Smith then cleaned up by Starc. 
With Amir, who looked half a chance to get in a fist fight with the same bowler 
but instead smashed 48 of the best. With Wahab, who tried to repeatedly put 
Australian bowlers on the moon, and nearly got there a couple of times. Stands 
of 47, 92 and 66 respectively. Asad the mainstay.

Of course, he gave his chances. One in particular to Smith who somehow shelled 
it in the cordon; the second time he committed that foul on the night. Unheard 
of with his hands. But there was a sense of destiny about how this was going to 
finish. Equally, there was an inevitability about the final five balls creating
one more thing - Bird finally removing Wahab, Smith finally making amends. Sort 
of.

So we return tomorrow. Pakistan already have their highest fourth innings 
score of all time. They need 108 more. In reality it’s not going to happen. 
Right? Surely. No way. Be serious. No. But hang on. That sounds familiar, 
doesn’t it? Dare to dream, they say. So I will go to bed tonight doing just 
that.

It’s certainly been a pleasure bringing it to you. Don’t miss a minute on the 
live Guardian coverage tomorrow at 12:30pm QLD time when play resumes at the 
Gabba. Until then, here’s your day four match report:

123rd over: Pakistan 382-8 (Shafiq 100, Yasir 4). Yasir leans on the first 
ball he sees, the penultimate of the evening, it’s basically Mark Waugh as he 
times it with ease to the rope. It is Pakistan’s highest fourth innings score. 
Ever. EVER. Thanks again Ric Finlay on the ABC for that. Yasir defends the last 
ball. What a last over. What a session. What a day.They’re coming back tomorrow.
That’s the real news here. Let me take a bloody breath! Back with you, with 
some version of a recap, in just a few minutes. I’m going to clap Shafiq off 
first.

WICKET! Wahab c Smith b Bird 30 (Pakistan 378-8)

Inevitable, wasn’t it? Couldn’t just have the ton and get through to stumps. A 
prod brings the downfall, the captain - earlier a villain for two dropped 
catches - who moves well to his left. Two balls to go on the day as Yasir walks 
out.

WHAT A CENTURY! ASAD SHAFIQ GETS THERE!

A moment to remember, at 10:05pm. Shafiq’s slap to the first Bird delivery of 
this epic fourth day went all the way out to the rope, the two men scampering 
with all their might between the wickets to secure three runs and this mighty, 
unexpected Test ton. His tenth. The Pakistan rooms are going absolutely wild. 
As they should. What a moment.

122nd over: Pakistan 375-7 (Shafiq 97, Wahab 30). Shafiq gets deep in the 
crease and cuts off his stumps, just evading Smith’s outstretched hand! You had 
your chances with him already, Skip. Doubt he’s giving you another now. Over 
and a half to go and Wahab is facing, as the Shafiq shot netted him three. Well 
within a stroke from a ton now. Wahab takes a bit old swing to a ball well 
outside the off-stump. It wasn’t taken by Wade anyway despite the suggestion 
that he may have nicked it. Who knows? I don’t. Back on the front dog to the 
last ball, defending. It’s over. Six balls to go, Jack Bird will bowl it. 
Shafiq on strike on 97. Pakistan need 115 to win with three wickets in hand. 
This is all pretty loose. Let’s see it through.

121st over: Pakistan 372-7 (Shafiq 94, Wahab 30). Have a 50 partnership! And 
Take yourself into the 90s Asad Shafiq, that’s what you do when you can sweep 
Nathan Lyon quite like that. Glorious batting. Could be get to 100 tonight? 
This has been a weird few hours, but I tell you what, we will remember it for a 
long time no matter what happens from here. This is no the highest fourth 
innings score at the Gabba, Ric Finlay informs on ABC. Three more with a punchy 
little paddle isn’t as convincing but it’s runs! Blessed runs! Six away from a 
ton no one could have possibly predicted. He’s on strike. To Nick Maddinson! 
Now into the attack. Okay, I better watch that now.

120th over: Pakistan 361-7 (Shafiq 86, Wahab 29). Hazlewood continues. Boy, 
what a shift from him, it’s his 35th over of the second dig. Still wicketless. 
Still landing them in his little shoebox. A push through the onside from Shafiq 
turns the strike over to Wahab, who is leaving well alone for the remainder of 
the set.

If Robert Wilson sends you a song, you put it in the OBO. “The incomparable 
(and deeply loopy) Yma Sumac. Theperfect music to cover bowlers having a late 
dash in a no-hope match.”
 “The sound of irresponsible zest.” Facebook

119th over: Pakistan 360-7 (Shafiq 85, Wahab 29). Wahab Riaz! Attempts a 
sweep, misses. Mishits a slog, finds two. Combines the two,flogs it waaaaay 
into the crowd!Nine from it. You know what: 130 to win all of a sudden. Geoff 
Lemon is yelling at me for even mentioning this. But I’m determined to suspend 
disbelief. Dare to dream.

118th over: Pakistan 351-7 (Shafiq 84, Wahab 21). Earlier in the over Pakistan 
brought up their350 when Shafiq took Hazlewood through midwicket for a couple. 
Six overs to go. I think.

Not out! The small pocket of Pakistan fans go WILD when S Ravi confirms that 
it is not caught, or lbw, or handled ball, or obstructing the field. That was 
fun.

Review! Hazlewood into the pads of Wahab. The third umpire, with great humour, 
says “review for inside and lbw, I’m not sure which.” Beautiful areas. Stand by.

117th over: Pakistan 348-7 (Shafiq 81, Wahab 21). Wahab absolutely taking the 
piss here, as he should. Sweeps Lyon like a top order player to the rope, then 
slogs him in the direction of the moon, into the stands it lands. They are 
loving it on the balcony, Sarfraz especially. On his feet, having a laugh. 
Anything better than bowlers when they get into this kind of mood with the bat? 
I was clearly hating this 20 minutes ago, but I’m going to embrace it now.

116th over: Pakistan 335-7 (Shafiq 78, Wahab 11). Wahab drives Hazlewood for 
three. Nice way to begin the extra half hour. Asad keeps the strike with a 
single behind square. Looks like Nath Lyon will continue from the other end.

Meanwhile, Robert Bloody McLiam Wilson has dropped me a line! What a delight 
to see your name for the first time this week.

“No one is writing to you?” They are not. 

“Is this about your song of the year?” Maybe. 

“I thought it was ok (and I hate music). But the OBO is a harsh and frosty 
crowd when it comes to such things. You’re best sticking with Phil Collins. Or 
Showaddywaddy (sic?), if you’re feeling the call of courage.”

Taken on notice. Anyone want to give me a song, by the way? I will publish 
just about anything right now.

Robert goes on:
“I hate it when Starc gets a wicket from something shortpitched. Leads him 
astray for another year.Dommage. One of the best just over full-length bowlers 
around.”


What a great guy. I hope to meet him in real life. One day.

115th over: Pakistan 331-7 (Shafiq 77, Wahab 8). Lyon bowls what is, in 
theory, the last over of the day. It doesn’t even matter what happened. Wahab 
takes one, but they’re all playing out to see what the officials are going to 
decide next. Oh, and the decision has been madewe’re going on at the Gabba! 
Scheduled close was 8pm, and will be finishing at 10pm. Which is 11pm on the 
east coast. I don’t count QLD as the east coast due to daylight savings 
sneering. And that they elected 11 One Nation MPs at the 1998 State Election.

114th over: Pakistan 330-7 (Shafiq 77, Wahab 7). Hazlewood is back. What does 
that mean? Does it suggest we’re going to extra half hour an they’ve given 
Smith the nod to that effect? Anyway, let’s just note that Shafiq plays a 
lovely cut to a shortish delivery, times the leather off it. Dots scatter the 
rest of the set. 370 the largest fourth innings total here, England in 2006 
when they still lost by a million. Thanks to Ric Finlay on the ABC commentary 
for that.

113th over: Pakistan 326-7 (Shafiq 73, Wahab 7). Garry Lyon is back into the 
attack, the ornament of the Melbourne Football Club. He provokes an aerial 
flick from Shaqif in the most eventful moment of the over, but it falls just 
short of the substitute fielder. Or does it? Maybe he should have been on the 
march and diving? We’ll never know. Have Australia even deserved the extra half 
hour? I say no. Then again: I’ve been OBOing for many hours today and wouldn’t 
count as a reliable witness at this stage.

112nd over: Pakistan 324-7 (Shafiq 72, Wahab 6). Steven Peter Devereux Smith. 
Your full name, because you’re in trouble. A second straight-forward catch
dropped by the captain. I don’t understand. He doesn’t do that. Just to his 
right. Barely really. Chest height. It was Shafiq who received the chance 
(again), Starc who created it. Sure enough, the next delivery in that general 
fourth stump delivery is left rather than driven at. Steven Peter Devereux 
Smith.

111st over: Pakistan 324-7 (Shafiq 72, Wahab 6). A maiden. The bowlers was 
Bird. So you know where it was. It was outside off, as it always is when he’s 
operating. He’s reliable like that. It’s why he gets a game. He’s the old pair 
of jeans. The batsman is Riaz. He’s stubborn and competitive. So instead of 
slashing, he’s leaving. Five of six times. When he has to play, it’s awkward 
but safe off an edge. It’s purgatory.Cricket

110th over: Pakistan 324-7 (Shafiq 72, Wahab 6). Also, there is the confidence 
that Shafiq has to draw from this for the remainder of the series. Get yourself 
a hundred. It’s Wahab in the first instance, beaten again by Starc with the 
first ball. An unconvincing push gets him one and puts Shafiq back on show. A 
big old edge finishes the over, it’s a genuine one, but not to hand in the 
cordon. That’ll drive Starc and Smith insane in equal measure. There’s no one 
left talking about this game, is there? Let alone writing to me. Don’t worry, I 
get it. I don’t feel rejected. This won’t come up in therapy.

109th over: Pakistan 319-7 (Shafiq 68, Wahab 5). Shafiq again takes a single 
from the first ball, delivered by Bird. Third man the destination. Wahab has to 
wear one in the guts when Bird brings one back. That’s not fun. He persists in 
defence for the remainder of the over, before retaining the strike with a 
single behind point to end the over. No concerns at all from Shafiq in letting 
his bowlers take the bulk of the strike. I’ll reiterate my point from earlier: 
really not for nothing making the Australian bowlers have to get up and do it 
all again tomorrow with another Test Match next week. Reckon he’d do well 
milking some strike here with that in mind. Right?

108th over: Pakistan 317-7 (Shafiq 67, Wahab 4). Starc to Shafiq, who takes a 
single into the legside first ball of the over. Not sure that’s in the manual 
for batting with the bowlers. But not much about this last hour and a half has 
been. Wahab does well enough to keep the quick out, picking up a boundary when 
a low full-toss around the wicket clashes with an edge. The last ball of the 
over is a beaut, beating the edge from around the wicket. Takes special gifts 
to do that from the angle he is delivering from.

A pretty decent game by Mohammad Amir: 4/97, 1/37, 21 & 48 with the bat

107th over: Pakistan 312-7 (Shafiq 66, Wahab 0). Wahab sees off the last 
couple of balls. In order to get the extra half hour they will need another 
wicket in the next eight overs.

WICKET! Amir c Wade b Bird 48 (Pakistan 312-7)

A wonderful hand comes to and when nicking off to Bird with a defensive 
stroke, two short of a maiden Test half-century. Considering the circumstances 
of how Starc was flinging them down when he arrives, and the state of the game, 
it was a particularly fine performance. Well played. And nicely earned by Bird, 
who has persisted in that channel even when they went after him.

106th over: Pakistan 311-6 (Shafiq 65, Amir 48). Starc vs Amir, once again. 
Bit it only lasts a ball to begin, one to third man easy as you’ll see. Shafiq 
sends him back though, an inside edge enabling another single. Amir is on the 
front foot driving to fielders, then under the customary bouncer, then swinging 
for the pickets to end the over. But didn’t make contact. It continues. 4890 is 
the crowd here today. Well down on the week, very healthy overall numbers.

105th over: Pakistan 309-6 (Shafiq 64, Amir 47). Half-chance! Khawaja gets 
some elevation at short cover with just the left hand. It hit some fingers but 
didn’t stick. It’s a great effort, but Shafiq remains. The response is 
emphatic, on the one knee square-driving behind gully. Maybe a cut, Geoff Lemon 
says next to me. Either way, it’s pretty. Seven from that over, bringing their 
partnership to 89. And ten overs to go. They can take half an hour after that, 
but they won’t be afforded it if they remain six down.

104th over: Pakistan 302-6 (Shafiq 58, Amir 46). It is Starc once more. We’re 
23 overs into this second new ball now, for what that is worth. Shafiq, 
amusingly, gives the strike to Amir after taking one down the ground first ball 
of the over. But Amir is past the point where that matters much now, he’s 
comfortable now. Comfortable enough to take Starc though cover to give the 
strike back to Shafiq, who cops an absolute screamer to finish the over. Misses 
the edge then the stumps. There’s still enough of those to encourage a quick 
result tonight.

103rd over: Pakistan 300-6 (Shafiq 57, Amir 45). Wonderful cut shot from Amir 
brings up the Pakistan 300.They’re going at a decent clip here. 38 off the last 
six overs the ABC informs me. With that in mind, I’m somewhat surprised when 
Amir decides to defend the final two deliveries in the conventional fashion.

102nd over: Pakistan 295-6 (Shafiq 56, Amir 41). Throwing the ball around a 
bit here, Smith gives Starc another stint not long after finishing his previous 
shift. Amir enjoys the first delivery, not that wide but carved behind gully 
for a boundary. Have that, he’ll say to the bowler given the words that were 
exchanged last time he was in operation. After attacking the stumps for a bit, 
Starc goes upstairs but Amir bends the knees and gets out of the way. Back on 
the pegs with some generous tail, an inside edge is won but straight onto the 
pads. No real danger there. And because, why the hell not, he has a lash at the 
last ball of the over and it’s over the slips for four more! Thanks for coming.
194 to win.

101st over: Pakistan 287-6 (Shafiq 56, Amir 33). Singles from each of the 
incumbent batsmen to start this new Lyon over, to point for Amir, down the 
ground Shafiq. Amir risks undoing plenty of good work when hacking through 
square leg with no real control. Three more to the score, through. Shafiq’s 
single to square leg gives him another chance before the over is done, cutting 
on this occasion with considerably more precision, the result the same: three 
more. Nine from it for the tourists, the stand 67.

100th over: Pakistan 278-6 (Shafiq 54, Amir 26). Second ball after the drink 
and Amir throws the bat at Hazlewood, getting enough of it to fly over gully 
and register three runs for Pakistan. Only 216 more to win. Maybe that’s 
underpinning this approach? A short ball to end the over is pulled by Shafiq, 
and with perfect timing down to the deep backward square rope. So make that 212.

99th over: Pakistan 271-6 (Shafiq 50, Amir 23). Last over before drinks, and 
it’ll be Lyon. Shafiq is defending then clipping, two through midwicket to 
raise an altogether entertaininghalf-century. 80 balls to get there, with four 
boundaries and that audacious hooked six. He sees out the rest of the over 
through to the breather. 16 more overs and we’re back tomorrow. Ponder that, 
friends. Ponder that.

98th over: Pakistan 269-6 (Shafiq 48, Amir 23). Over gully goes Shafiq, that’s 
the way to annoy a still-wicketless Hazlewood. You get four for boldness like 
that. They thrice take singles into the off-side through the second half of the 
over. Positively productive. Oh, that last one though, that’s more what Bird 
wants, beating Amir’s edge.

97th over: Pakistan 262-6 (Shafiq 42, Amir 22). Nathan Lyon returns, the roar 
does as well. Been such a great part of this Test Match. Could this actually 
change his career? A confidence bowler, now a cult hero. Something worth 
exploring. In the short term, he won’t like that Amir has given it crack at pop 
him in the pool, four scored slogging him in that direction to end an otherwise 
placid over. They’ve put on 42.

Amir sends another one to the boundary! He's now 22*...

96th over: Pakistan 258-6 (Shafiq 42, Amir 18). Oh have that, Shafiq says, 
hooking Hazlewood for six of the best! Sure, he’s been a bit punchy over the 
last few overs, but I didn’t see that coming. A thick old top edge gave it the 
elevation required to clear the rope. It’s certainly one way to go about saving 
a Test. Good on him. Spin to come next from the Vulture Street end, which is 
timely.

95th over: Pakistan 250-6 (Shafiq 34, Amir 18). Pakistan bring up ther 250 
with a really quite stunning off-drive from Amir to complete the Bird over. MCC 
manual, and all that. It comes the ball after Bird snorts one across him, 
missing the off-stump by a handful of centimetres. Earlier in the over it was 
Amir going aerial in the off-side as well. The result may be a foregone 
conclusion here, but the cricket isn’t bad at all, you know.

94th over: Pakistan 244-6 (Shafiq 34, Amir 12). Hazlewood swung around to 
replace Starc after his fearsome stint. To Shafiq, who is good enough to get 
him around the corner for a couple in response to a relatively straight 
delivery. A bouncer follows, sure enough. No issues there. Nor with the 
remainder of the over, in defence throughout. Shafiq was a bit loose early in 
the session, but is in relative control at the moment.

93rd over: Pakistan 242-6 (Shafiq 32, Amir 12). Nice going from Shafiq who 
drives through cover - albeit over the field - for three. Another good stroke 
from Amir later on, cutting behind point for a couple. Looking alright after 
that initial challenge from Starc, he is.

92nd over: Pakistan 237-6 (Shafiq 29, Amir 10). Oh gosh, a bouncer - in theory 
- from Starc to Amir. And it hasjust made it over the stumps. Reminiscent of 
Lydia Greenway losing her stumps to Ellyse Perry last year in near-identical 
circumstances during their Test at Canterbury. Bit annoying that isn’t on 
youtube. Let’s not dwell. A rapid over ends when Starc hits the radarover 152kph
 which is just madness, isn’t it? He has a bit of a chirp at Amir at the end of 
it all when the yorker is dug out, probably just arranging to catch up after 
play. Sure that’s all it is. Maiden, by the way.

Also similar to this, come to think of it. 
 Don’t @ me, Indian fans who are still fuming about this. I’m but the 
messenger. Facebook

91st over: Pakistan 237-6 (Shafiq 29, Amir 10). Bird again. A bit of chat on 
the ABC about whether Starc and Hazlewood are the best opening duo in the world 
at the moment. Obviously Abbott/Philander/Rabada were really something over 
here, with Steyn and Morkel not even available. Meanwhile, Anderson and Broad 
are in the most potent handful England have ever had, certainly when it comes 
to career victims. Doubly so at home. But does this Australian pairing have 
them covered at this moment in time? I reckon they might. The third wheel in 
that, Bird, has the ball now. Amir does well to keep him out early before 
driving with real confidence for another three into the off-side. He bowls a 
straighter line to Shafiq in defence, then manages to bounce over his head so 
far that a wide is called. Not his best over.

90th over: Pakistan 233-6 (Shafiq 29, Amir 7). Fat edge from Shafiq to the 
first ball of Starc’s new set, and it has raced to the rope through the fifth 
slip region. They could probably get away with throwing another couple of 
grippers in there at this stage, to be fair. A sound drive does follow, though, 
but Warner makes a wonderful save at mid-off diving to his right, intercepting 
the ball in mid-air. Mad skillz. By the end of the over it’s Amir back at the 
business end, and he plays a perfectly acceptable drive through cover for 
three. Nice one.

89th over: Pakistan 225-6 (Shafiq 24, Amir 4). It is Jackson Bird for 
Hazlewood, at a far gentler pace than Starc up the other end. Shafiq takes one 
to fine leg, exposing Amir. Perhaps after what happened in the previous over to 
Starc he’s immediately throwing the proverbial kitchen sink at the new bowler, 
heaving over point for a couple. A much better stroke follows to end the over, 
along the carpet through cover for a couple more. More importantly: it’ll be 
his mate facing Starc in the first instance next over, not him.

I love Pakistan’s theory of whoever bats the best as a tailender in the first 
innings gets to bat number 8 in the second.

88th over: Pakistan 220-6 (Shafiq 23, Amir 0). What a great over. That 
wicket-taking delivery a joy to watch on the replay, hooping a long way back 
through the gate. The stuff left-armers dream of. It came the ball after 
slicing him open but not hitting the stumps. It’s a pattern that continues once 
Amir gets his chance. At 150 clicks he beats his opposing number. Blimey, then 
he does it again with the last ball of the set. That’s just too good. A 
sensational over by any measure.

WICKET! Sarfraz b Starc 24 (Pakistan 220-6)

That’s more like it! Contrary to what we speculated about before the 
attack-leader gets another over and makes no mistake. That’s a sensational 
piece of bowling, cannoning into Sarfraz’s middle stump back through the gate. 
Classic fast, full swing. Classic Mitchell Starc. Four to go.

87th over: Pakistan 220-5 (Shafiq 23, Sarfraz 24). Hazlewood continues, 
running away from us here at the Vulture Street End. Again he concedes to fine 
leg to his first ball of the over, Shafiq benefitting from the misfire on this 
occasion. A decent bouncer punctuates an otherwise nondescript over, finished 
with Sarfraz stroking to deep cover for a couple. They’re out on 47 now.

86th over: Pakistan 216-5 (Shafiq 22, Sarfraz 21). Shafiq’s turn to have a 
waft, playing and missing to Starc’s first delivery. Not sure they’re fond of 
dragging this out to a fifth day, you know. Which is a bit daft in the context 
of the series. If they can force the Australians to have another bowl tomorrow 
- deprive them off that day off - it won’t be for absolutely nothing from 
Melbourne. Anyway, after getting exchange singles Shafiq uppercuts over point 
later in the over, reinforcing my earlier point. To be fair, it wasn’t much of 
a ball and a safe enough stroke. A more conventional clip ends the over, two 
taken through midwicket. Pushing hard here the Australian main duo but not 
getting it where they want enough of the time. Chris Rogers on the radio 
suggests that Jack Bird might be given a crack from that end, and he’s usually 
pretty close to the mark with these things.

More WBBL. A couple of brilliant games in Bendigo between the Gades and the 
Canes, both resolved on the final ball. Indeed, today’s fixture went to a super 
over. Here’s the report.

85th over: Pakistan 207-5 (Shafiq 14, Sarfraz 20). Sarfraz again takes a run 
from the first ball of Hazlewood’s over down to fine leg. Shafiq does broadly 
the same to square leg when he gets the chance, after missing a ball sprayed 
down the legside before it. Rare from Big Josh, perhaps a bit shirty after the 
missed chance in his previous set. Back on point, a short ball darts back at 
Sarfraz, getting his gloves out of the way at the last moment. Perhaps that 
shook him up a bit as he responded by flaying at a ball well outside the 
off-stump to end the over, thankfully for him playing and missing. That would 
have been an ugly way to go. Eventful as always.

84th over: Pakistan 205-5 (Shafiq 13, Sarfraz 19). Sure enough plenty of 
replays coming of Smith’s missed chance the previous over, as Starc begins 
after dinner. Looked to hit him on the end of the fingers rather than the palm. 
Can’t recall him ever putting one down back there. Shafiq leaves a couple, 
defends a couple, gets under a bouncer then digs out a yorker. A maiden it is.

83rd over: Pakistan 205-5 (Shafiq 13, Sarfraz 19). Sarfraz grabs a couple off 
Hazlewood down to fine leg first ball of the session. He’s into his 25th over 
and hasn’t picked up a wicket despite being Australia’s best. Frustrating times 
when sitting on 97 Test victims. Deserves a bag every time he has a trundle at 
the moment. And wouldn’t you know it?Steve Smith drops a sitter. Sarfraz giving 
the most conventional chance to second slip. It was coming at a decent speed 
and attempted to take it side-on to the right for reasons that aren’t entirely 
clear. It won’t cost them the Test Match, but it may very well cost them a day 
off.

Meanwhile, a ridiculous performance from Beth Mooney in the WBBL this 
afternoon at the Gabba. Playing for the Heat, she stumped four Scorchers 
batsmen before smashing 67 not out in the chase. Serious player.

More end of year jibber? Of the cricket variety? Five guys have 1000 Test runs 
to date. They are:

Root - 1471 @ 51.
Young Jonny “OBO bae” Bairstow - 1469 @ 61
Cook 1221 @ 42
Kohli 1215 @ 76
Moeen Ali 1034 @ 47
On reflection, this mostly has to do with the fact that England played 17 
Tests this year, doesn’t it? For Australia, Smith has 914 @ 61.

Top of the pops with the ball while we’re at it:

Ashwin 72 (!) @ 23
Herath 54 @ 18 (in eight Tests... freak)
Broad 47 @ 26
Starc 43 @ 21
Yasir 43 @ 37

How about another song in the four minutes before they return. Not that you 
asked, but my favourite of the year. You’re welcome.
 Go home. Baby, it’ll be alright. Put your life into the cold light.

Adam Collins

Me, again. Thanks Geoff. Adam Collins to see you through this long 
two-and-a-half hour session to end day four, and surely end this Test Match. I 
say surely for the lights that are on, the pink ball that is new and the sky 
that is dark. This is the first time since we’ve had Day-Night Tests in 
Australia that the final session is extending the extra 60 (and tonight 90) 
minutes. We’ve seen how hard it is to bat in the final hour when the ball is 
darting around, and Australia will have twice as long as usual. That’s my 
logic, and I’m sticking with it.

Of course, Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com 
<mailto:Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com> - take your best shot. That’s 
@collinsadam <http://www.twitter.com/collinsadam>on the idiot machine. You know 
what, let’s have a song. In the seasonal spirit, I’m going to throw you my 
favourite Christmas song. An unusual winner, but I’m an unusual person.
 “Oh, Santa. It’s been a real hard year.” Facebook

Dinner - Pakistan trail by 287 with five wickets in hand

Australia got everything they needed in that session, with the wickets of 
Azhar, Misbah and Younis. They chipped away and chipped away, and while a few 
runs were scored, the guys with the potential to play long innings were 
eventually squeezed out. Starc, Lyon and Bird got a wicket apiece, as Australia 
conceded 72 in the session for those three wickets. It won’t have hurt Azhar 
and Younis to have made a few though, and to have done so here on the bounciest 
deck they’ll face this tour. On the more placid surfaces at theCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Grounds of Melbourne and Sydney, 
perhaps Pakistan’s batsmen can put up more of a show. That’s it for me, Geoff 
Lemon out until Boxing Day, and Adam Collins will be back shortly to take you 
through the last stanza.

82nd over: Pakistan 203-5 (Shafiq 13, Sarfraz 17)

Way down leg to start with, as is often Starc’s way. It’s also his way to take 
a wicket in his first over. Sarfraz blocks a couple, then squats and reaches 
wide of off stump to drive a bump ball to gully. Can’t help feeling for ball on 
bat, can Sarfraz. Second-last ball, Lyon pulls out a dive to raise himself a 
few more cheers, then the last is targeting the pads, and Sarfraz whips three 
nicely played runs away. He’s scoring quickly again.

81st over: Pakistan 200-5 (Shafiq 13, Sarfraz 14)


Here’s that new ball, in the hand of one Joshua Hazleberger. He’s too wide 
with the first couple of balls and they don’t trouble Shafiq, then he targets 
the stumps bit is blocked out. Two minutes until the dinner break as he bowls 
his fourth ball. The Australians would love to squeeze an extra over in. 
Hazlewood is getting relatively quickly thorugh his over but he still has a 
long run-up. He’s turning quickly, bowling wide once more. Hazlewood might win 
this one... he does. By a matter of eight seconds. Bowls another dot, which 
means Umpire Illingworth has time to get in position, and Starc will get a

80th over: Pakistan 200-5 (Shafiq 13, Sarfraz 14)


It’s not so much happy hour as last drinks, tequila shots, and the bouncers 
are circling. Sarfraz comes fdown the wicket at Bird, kneels, and slog-sweeps 
him towards midwicket. Mistimes the whack and gets three runs through deep 
backward. Shafiq times his shot much more prettily, a flick off the pads that 
does make the rope. Then a single from the last ball and the Pakistan 200 is 
raised.

79th over: Pakistan 192-5 (Shafiq 8, Sarfraz 11)

A lot of fun to watch, is Sarfraz, the Pakistani wicketkeeper with a curious 
resemblance to Mick Molloy. Comes down the wicket to Lyon and drives three runs 
through point, nicely done. Shafiq taps a single, Sarfraz follows suit, both to 
the posh side of the pitch, then Shafiq comes down andgoes whack down the 
ground for four mor runs. Nine from it. Oh yes, new ball’s a-coming.

78th over: Pakistan 183-5 (Shafiq 3, Sarfraz 7)

I suppose Sarfraz figures he might as well make what he can before the new 
ball comes along, with Starc and Hazlewood to wield it. Slaps Bird throug point 
for four, glances him for a single.

77th over: Pakistan 177-5 (Shafiq 3, Sarfraz 1)

Lyon continues his good spell, mixing up his speed and flight and length. The 
first ball so very nearly has Sarfraz: it pitched outside off, then hit the pad 
as he went to sleep. Umpire Gould said that was hitting outside the line, and 
even if the Australians had reviews left, DRS would have showed that the impact 
on pad was umpire’s call. It’s a maiden, despite the best efforts of Sarfraz, 
who plays a shot to each point of the compass but can’t get any one of them 
through.

There was a moment about 40 minutes into the three hour, five minute final 
session when we all had a good laugh. CA popped a statement out saying that day 
five would be free. Admirable sentiment, but come on. Let’s get serious. This 
is finishing tonight. Of course it is. Pakistan are plucky, but notthat plucky. 
Not when they are slashing at everything. Giving it their best, but giving 
chances. Not when Josh Hazlewood is bowling as well as that. Not when having to 
prevail for that long after dark; a time that’s meant to be near-on impossible 
to survive the pink ball. Not a lower order. No. No way. No.

Well, here we are. And in the most dramatic final over - coming after the most 
glorious extra half-hour - Asad Shafiq raised his 10th Test ton. Not with a 
classical stroke, but a slap. It was in keeping with the hours that they had 
been. With Sarfraz early, who as dropped by Smith then cleaned up by Starc. 
With Amir, who looked half a chance to get in a fist fight with the same bowler 
but instead smashed 48 of the best. With Wahab, who tried to repeatedly put 
Australian bowlers on the moon, and nearly got there a couple of times. Stands 
of 47, 92 and 66 respectively. Asad the mainstay.

Of course, he gave his chances. One in particular to Smith who somehow shelled 
it in the cordon; the second time he committed that foul on the night. Unheard 
of with his hands. But there was a sense of destiny about how this was going to 
finish. Equally, there was an inevitability about the final five balls creating
one more thing - Bird finally removing Wahab, Smith finally making amends. Sort 
of.

So we return tomorrow. Pakistan already have their highest fourth innings 
score of all time. They need 108 more. In reality it’s not going to happen. 
Right? Surely. No way. Be serious. No. But hang on. That sounds familiar, 
doesn’t it? Dare to dream, they say. So I will go to bed tonight doing just 
that.

It’s certainly been a pleasure bringing it to you. Don’t miss a minute on the 
live Guardian coverage tomorrow at 12:30pm QLD time when play resumes at the 
Gabba. Until then, here’s your day four match report:


Pakistan frustrate Australia as first Test goes to a fifth day at the Gabba

123rd over: Pakistan 382-8 (Shafiq 100, Yasir 4). Yasir leans on the first 
ball he sees, the penultimate of the evening, it’s basically Mark Waugh as he 
times it with ease to the rope. It is Pakistan’s highest fourth innings score. 
Ever. EVER. Thanks again Ric Finlay on the ABC for that. Yasir defends the last 
ball. What a last over. What a session. What a day.They’re coming back tomorrow.
That’s the real news here. Let me take a bloody breath! Back with you, with 
some version of a recap, in just a few minutes. I’m going to clap Shafiq off 
first.

 
Inevitable, wasn’t it? Couldn’t just have the ton and get through to stumps. A 
prod brings the downfall, the captain - earlier a villain for two dropped 
catches - who moves well to his left. Two balls to go on the day as Yasir walks 
out.
 
A moment to remember, at 10:05pm. Shafiq’s slap to the first Bird delivery of 
this epic fourth day went all the way out to the rope, the two men scampering 
with all their might between the wickets to secure three runs and this mighty, 
unexpected Test ton. His tenth. The Pakistan rooms are going absolutely wild. 
As they should. What a moment.
 
122nd over: Pakistan 375-7 (Shafiq 97, Wahab 30). Shafiq gets deep in the 
crease and cuts off his stumps, just evading Smith’s outstretched hand! You had 
your chances with him already, Skip. Doubt he’s giving you another now. Over 
and a half to go and Wahab is facing, as the Shafiq shot netted him three. Well 
within a stroke from a ton now. Wahab takes a bit old swing to a ball well 
outside the off-stump. It wasn’t taken by Wade anyway despite the suggestion 
that he may have nicked it. Who knows? I don’t. Back on the front dog to the 
last ball, defending. It’s over. Six balls to go, Jack Bird will bowl it. 
Shafiq on strike on 97. Pakistan need 115 to win with three wickets in hand. 
This is all pretty loose. Let’s see it through.
 
121st over: Pakistan 372-7 (Shafiq 94, Wahab 30). Have a 50 partnership! And 
Take yourself into the 90s Asad Shafiq, that’s what you do when you can sweep 
Nathan Lyon quite like that. Glorious batting. Could be get to 100 tonight? 
This has been a weird few hours, but I tell you what, we will remember it for a 
long time no matter what happens from here. This is no the highest fourth 
innings score at the Gabba, Ric Finlay informs on ABC. Three more with a punchy 
little paddle isn’t as convincing but it’s runs! Blessed runs! Six away from a 
ton no one could have possibly predicted. He’s on strike. To Nick Maddinson! 
Now into the attack. Okay, I better watch that now.
 
120th over: Pakistan 361-7 (Shafiq 86, Wahab 29). Hazlewood continues. Boy, 
what a shift from him, it’s his 35th over of the second dig. Still wicketless. 
Still landing them in his little shoebox. A push through the onside from Shafiq 
turns the strike over to Wahab, who is leaving well alone for the remainder of 
the set.

If Robert Wilson sends you a song, you put it in the OBO. “The incomparable 
(and deeply loopy) Yma Sumac. Theperfect music to cover bowlers having a late 
dash in a no-hope match.”
 “The sound of irresponsible zest.”  
119th over: Pakistan 360-7 (Shafiq 85, Wahab 29). Wahab Riaz! Attempts a 
sweep, misses. Mishits a slog, finds two. Combines the two,flogs it waaaaay 
into the crowd!Nine from it. You know what: 130 to win all of a sudden. Geoff 
Lemon is yelling at me for even mentioning this. But I’m determined to suspend 
disbelief. Dare to dream.

Six overs to go. I think.
 
Not out! The small pocket of Pakistan fans go WILD when S Ravi confirms that 
it is not caught, or lbw, or handled ball, or obstructing the field. That was 
fun.
 
Review! Hazlewood into the pads of Wahab. The third umpire, with great humour, 
says “review for inside and lbw, I’m not sure which.” Beautiful areas. Stand by.
 
117th over: Pakistan 348-7 (Shafiq 81, Wahab 21). Wahab absolutely taking the 
piss here, as he should. Sweeps Lyon like a top order player to the rope, then 
slogs him in the direction of the moon, into the stands it lands. They are 
loving it on the balcony, Sarfraz especially. On his feet, having a laugh. 
Anything better than bowlers when they get into this kind of mood with the bat? 
I was clearly hating this 20 minutes ago, but I’m going to embrace it now.
 
116th over: Pakistan 335-7 (Shafiq 78, Wahab 11). Wahab drives Hazlewood for 
three. Nice way to begin the extra half hour. Asad keeps the strike with a 
single behind square. Looks like Nath Lyon will continue from the other end.

Meanwhile, Robert Bloody McLiam Wilson has dropped me a line! What a delight 
to see your name for the first time this week.

“No one is writing to you?” They are not. 

“Is this about your song of the year?” Maybe. 

“I thought it was ok (and I hate music). But the OBO is a harsh and frosty 
crowd when it comes to such things. You’re best sticking with Phil Collins. Or 
Showaddywaddy (sic?), if you’re feeling the call of courage.”

Taken on notice. Anyone want to give me a song, by the way? I will publish 
just about anything right now.

Robert goes on:
“I hate it when Starc gets a wicket from something shortpitched. Leads him 
astray for another year.Dommage. One of the best just over full-length bowlers 
around.”


What a great guy. I hope to meet him in real life. One day. 
 
115th over: Pakistan 331-7 (Shafiq 77, Wahab 8). Lyon bowls what is, in 
theory, the last over of the day. It doesn’t even matter what happened. Wahab 
takes one, but they’re all playing out to see what the officials are going to 
decide next. Oh, and the decision has been madewe’re going on at the Gabba! 
Scheduled close was 8pm, and will be finishing at 10pm. Which is 11pm on the 
east coast. I don’t count QLD as the east coast due to daylight savings 
sneering. And that they elected 11 One Nation MPs at the 1998 State Election.
 
114th over: Pakistan 330-7 (Shafiq 77, Wahab 7). Hazlewood is back. What does 
that mean? Does it suggest we’re going to extra half hour an they’ve given 
Smith the nod to that effect? Anyway, let’s just note that Shafiq plays a 
lovely cut to a shortish delivery, times the leather off it. Dots scatter the 
rest of the set. 370 the largest fourth innings total here, England in 2006 
when they still lost by a million. Thanks to Ric Finlay on the ABC commentary 
for that.
 
113th over: Pakistan 326-7 (Shafiq 73, Wahab 7). Garry Lyon is back into the 
attack, the ornament of the Melbourne Football Club. He provokes an aerial 
flick from Shaqif in the most eventful moment of the over, but it falls just 
short of the substitute fielder. Or does it? Maybe he should have been on the 
march and diving? We’ll never know. Have Australia even deserved the extra half 
hour? I say no. Then again: I’ve been OBOing for many hours today and wouldn’t 
count as a reliable witness at this stage.

Your full name, because you’re in trouble. A second straight-forward catch
dropped by the captain. I don’t understand. He doesn’t do that. Just to his 
right. Barely really. Chest height. It was Shafiq who received the chance 
(again), Starc who created it. Sure enough, the next delivery in that general 
fourth stump delivery is left rather than driven at. Steven Peter Devereux 
Smith.

111st over: Pakistan 324-7 (Shafiq 72, Wahab 6). A maiden. The bowlers was 
Bird. So you know where it was. It was outside off, as it always is when he’s 
operating. He’s reliable like that. It’s why he gets a game. He’s the old pair 
of jeans. The batsman is Riaz. He’s stubborn and competitive. So instead of 
slashing, he’s leaving. Five of six times. When he has to play, it’s awkward 
but safe off an edge. It’s purgatory.Cricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> purgatory.
 
110th over: Pakistan 324-7 (Shafiq 72, Wahab 6). Also, there is the confidence 
that Shafiq has to draw from this for the remainder of the series. Get yourself 
a hundred. It’s Wahab in the first instance, beaten again by Starc with the 
first ball. An unconvincing push gets him one and puts Shafiq back on show. A 
big old edge finishes the over, it’s a genuine one, but not to hand in the 
cordon. That’ll drive Starc and Smith insane in equal measure. There’s no one 
left talking about this game, is there? Let alone writing to me. Don’t worry, I 
get it. I don’t feel rejected. This won’t come up in therapy.
 
109th over: Pakistan 319-7 (Shafiq 68, Wahab 5). Shafiq again takes a single 
from the first ball, delivered by Bird. Third man the destination. Wahab has to 
wear one in the guts when Bird brings one back. That’s not fun. He persists in 
defence for the remainder of the over, before retaining the strike with a 
single behind point to end the over. No concerns at all from Shafiq in letting 
his bowlers take the bulk of the strike. I’ll reiterate my point from earlier: 
really not for nothing making the Australian bowlers have to get up and do it 
all again tomorrow with another Test Match next week. Reckon he’d do well 
milking some strike here with that in mind. Right?
 
108th over: Pakistan 317-7 (Shafiq 67, Wahab 4). Starc to Shafiq, who takes a 
single into the legside first ball of the over. Not sure that’s in the manual 
for batting with the bowlers. But not much about this last hour and a half has 
been. Wahab does well enough to keep the quick out, picking up a boundary when 
a low full-toss around the wicket clashes with an edge. The last ball of the 
over is a beaut, beating the edge from around the wicket. Takes special gifts 
to do that from the angle he is delivering from.

couple of balls. In order to get the extra half hour they will need another 
wicket in the next eight overs.

A wonderful hand comes to and when nicking off to Bird with a defensive 
stroke, two short of a maiden Test half-century. Considering the circumstances 
of how Starc was flinging them down when he arrives, and the state of the game, 
it was a particularly fine performance. Well played. And nicely earned by Bird, 
who has persisted in that channel even when they went after him.
 
106th over: Pakistan 311-6 (Shafiq 65, Amir 48). Starc vs Amir, once again. 
Bit it only lasts a ball to begin, one to third man easy as you’ll see. Shafiq 
sends him back though, an inside edge enabling another single. Amir is on the 
front foot driving to fielders, then under the customary bouncer, then swinging 
for the pickets to end the over. But didn’t make contact. It continues. 4890 is 
the crowd here today. Well down on the week, very healthy overall numbers.
 
105th over: Pakistan 309-6 (Shafiq 64, Amir 47). Half-chance! Khawaja gets 
some elevation at short cover with just the left hand. It hit some fingers but 
didn’t stick. It’s a great effort, but Shafiq remains. The response is 
emphatic, on the one knee square-driving behind gully. Maybe a cut, Geoff Lemon 
says next to me. Either way, it’s pretty. Seven from that over, bringing their 
partnership to 89. And ten overs to go. They can take half an hour after that, 
but they won’t be afforded it if they remain six down.

104th over: Pakistan 302-6 (Shafiq 58, Amir 46). It is Starc once more. We’re 
23 overs into this second new ball now, for what that is worth. Shafiq, 
amusingly, gives the strike to Amir after taking one down the ground first ball 
of the over. But Amir is past the point where that matters much now, he’s 
comfortable now. Comfortable enough to take Starc though cover to give the 
strike back to Shafiq, who cops an absolute screamer to finish the over. Misses 
the edge then the stumps. There’s still enough of those to encourage a quick 
result tonight.
 
103rd over: Pakistan 300-6 (Shafiq 57, Amir 45). Wonderful cut shot from Amir 
brings up the Pakistan 300.They’re going at a decent clip here. 38 off the last 
six overs the ABC informs me. With that in mind, I’m somewhat surprised when 
Amir decides to defend the final two deliveries in the conventional fashion.

102nd over: Pakistan 295-6 (Shafiq 56, Amir 41). Throwing the ball around a 
bit here, Smith gives Starc another stint not long after finishing his previous 
shift. Amir enjoys the first delivery, not that wide but carved behind gully 
for a boundary. Have that, he’ll say to the bowler given the words that were 
exchanged last time he was in operation. After attacking the stumps for a bit, 
Starc goes upstairs but Amir bends the knees and gets out of the way. Back on 
the pegs with some generous tail, an inside edge is won but straight onto the 
pads. No real danger there. And because, why the hell not, he has a lash at the 
last ball of the over and it’s over the slips for four more! Thanks for coming.
194 to win.

101st over: Pakistan 287-6 (Shafiq 56, Amir 33). Singles from each of the 
incumbent batsmen to start this new Lyon over, to point for Amir, down the 
ground Shafiq. Amir risks undoing plenty of good work when hacking through 
square leg with no real control. Three more to the score, through. Shafiq’s 
single to square leg gives him another chance before the over is done, cutting 
on this occasion with considerably more precision, the result the same: three 
more. Nine from it for the tourists, the stand 67.
 
100th over: Pakistan 278-6 (Shafiq 54, Amir 26). Second ball after the drink 
and Amir throws the bat at Hazlewood, getting enough of it to fly over gully 
and register three runs for Pakistan. Only 216 more to win. Maybe that’s 
underpinning this approach? A short ball to end the over is pulled by Shafiq, 
and with perfect timing down to the deep backward square rope. So make that 212.

99th over: Pakistan 271-6 (Shafiq 50, Amir 23). Last over before drinks, and 
it’ll be Lyon. Shafiq is defending then clipping, two through midwicket to 
raise an altogether entertaininghalf-century. 80 balls to get there, with four 
boundaries and that audacious hooked six. He sees out the rest of the over 
through to the breather. 16 more overs and we’re back tomorrow. Ponder that, 
friends. Ponder that.
 
98th over: Pakistan 269-6 (Shafiq 48, Amir 23). Over gully goes Shafiq, that’s 
the way to annoy a still-wicketless Hazlewood. You get four for boldness like 
that. They thrice take singles into the off-side through the second half of the 
over. Positively productive. Oh, that last one though, that’s more what Bird 
wants, beating Amir’s edge.
 
97th over: Pakistan 262-6 (Shafiq 42, Amir 22). Nathan Lyon returns, the roar 
does as well. Been such a great part of this Test Match. Could this actually 
change his career? A confidence bowler, now a cult hero. Something worth 
exploring. In the short term, he won’t like that Amir has given it crack at pop 
him in the pool, four scored slogging him in that direction to end an otherwise 
placid over. They’ve put on 42.

96th over: Pakistan 258-6 (Shafiq 42, Amir 18). Oh have that, Shafiq says, 
hooking Hazlewood for six of the best! Sure, he’s been a bit punchy over the 
last few overs, but I didn’t see that coming. A thick old top edge gave it the 
elevation required to clear the rope. It’s certainly one way to go about saving 
a Test. Good on him. Spin to come next from the Vulture Street end, which is 
timely.
 
95th over: Pakistan 250-6 (Shafiq 34, Amir 18). Pakistan bring up ther 250 
with a really quite stunning off-drive from Amir to complete the Bird over. MCC 
manual, and all that. It comes the ball after Bird snorts one across him, 
missing the off-stump by a handful of centimetres. Earlier in the over it was 
Amir going aerial in the off-side as well. The result may be a foregone 
conclusion here, but the cricket isn’t bad at all, you know.

94th over: Pakistan 244-6 (Shafiq 34, Amir 12). Hazlewood swung around to 
replace Starc after his fearsome stint. To Shafiq, who is good enough to get 
him around the corner for a couple in response to a relatively straight 
delivery. A bouncer follows, sure enough. No issues there. Nor with the 
remainder of the over, in defence throughout. Shafiq was a bit loose early in 
the session, but is in relative control at the moment.

that initial challenge from Starc, he is.

92nd over: Pakistan 237-6 (Shafiq 29, Amir 10). Oh gosh, a bouncer - in theory 
- from Starc to Amir. And it hasjust made it over the stumps. Reminiscent of 
Lydia Greenway losing her stumps to Ellyse Perry last year in near-identical 
circumstances during their Test at Canterbury. Bit annoying that isn’t on 
youtube. Let’s not dwell. A rapid over ends when Starc hits the radarover 152kph
 which is just madness, isn’t it? He has a bit of a chirp at Amir at the end of 
it all when the yorker is dug out, probably just arranging to catch up after 
play. Sure that’s all it is. Maiden, by the way.

Also similar to this, come to think of it. 
 Don’t @ me, Indian fans who are still fuming about this. I’m but the 
messenger.  
91st over: Pakistan 237-6 (Shafiq 29, Amir 10). Bird again. A bit of chat on 
the ABC about whether Starc and Hazlewood are the best opening duo in the world 
at the moment. Obviously Abbott/Philander/Rabada were really something over 
here, with Steyn and Morkel not even available. Meanwhile, Anderson and Broad 
are in the most potent handful England have ever had, certainly when it comes 
to career victims. Doubly so at home. But does this Australian pairing have 
them covered at this moment in time? I reckon they might. The third wheel in 
that, Bird, has the ball now. Amir does well to keep him out early before 
driving with real confidence for another three into the off-side. He bowls a 
straighter line to Shafiq in defence, then manages to bounce over his head so 
far that a wide is called. Not his best over.

90th over: Pakistan 233-6 (Shafiq 29, Amir 7). Fat edge from Shafiq to the 
first ball of Starc’s new set, and it has raced to the rope through the fifth 
slip region. They could probably get away with throwing another couple of 
grippers in there at this stage, to be fair. A sound drive does follow, though, 
but Warner makes a wonderful save at mid-off diving to his right, intercepting 
the ball in mid-air. Mad skillz. By the end of the over it’s Amir back at the 
business end, and he plays a perfectly acceptable drive through cover for 
three. Nice one.

89th over: Pakistan 225-6 (Shafiq 24, Amir 4). It is Jackson Bird for 
Hazlewood, at a far gentler pace than Starc up the other end. Shafiq takes one 
to fine leg, exposing Amir. Perhaps after what happened in the previous over to 
Starc he’s immediately throwing the proverbial kitchen sink at the new bowler, 
heaving over point for a couple. A much better stroke follows to end the over, 
along the carpet through cover for a couple more. More importantly: it’ll be 
his mate facing Starc in the first instance next over, not him.

88th over: Pakistan 220-6 (Shafiq 23, Amir 0). What a great over. That 
wicket-taking delivery a joy to watch on the replay, hooping a long way back 
through the gate. The stuff left-armers dream of. It came the ball after 
slicing him open but not hitting the stumps. It’s a pattern that continues once 
Amir gets his chance. At 150 clicks he beats his opposing number. Blimey, then 
he does it again with the last ball of the set. That’s just too good. A 
sensational over by any measure.
 
That’s more like it! Contrary to what we speculated about before the 
attack-leader gets another over and makes no mistake. That’s a sensational 
piece of bowling, cannoning into Sarfraz’s middle stump back through the gate. 
Classic fast, full swing. Classic Mitchell Starc. Four to go.
 
87th over: Pakistan 220-5 (Shafiq 23, Sarfraz 24). Hazlewood continues, 
running away from us here at the Vulture Street End. Again he concedes to fine 
leg to his first ball of the over, Shafiq benefitting from the misfire on this 
occasion. A decent bouncer punctuates an otherwise nondescript over, finished 
with Sarfraz stroking to deep cover for a couple. They’re out on 47 now.
 
86th over: Pakistan 216-5 (Shafiq 22, Sarfraz 21). Shafiq’s turn to have a 
waft, playing and missing to Starc’s first delivery. Not sure they’re fond of 
dragging this out to a fifth day, you know. Which is a bit daft in the context 
of the series. If they can force the Australians to have another bowl tomorrow 
- deprive them off that day off - it won’t be for absolutely nothing from 
Melbourne. Anyway, after getting exchange singles Shafiq uppercuts over point 
later in the over, reinforcing my earlier point. To be fair, it wasn’t much of 
a ball and a safe enough stroke. A more conventional clip ends the over, two 
taken through midwicket. Pushing hard here the Australian main duo but not 
getting it where they want enough of the time. Chris Rogers on the radio 
suggests that Jack Bird might be given a crack from that end, and he’s usually 
pretty close to the mark with these things.

More WBBL. A couple of brilliant games in Bendigo between the Gades and the 
Canes, both resolved on the final ball. Indeed, today’s fixture went to a super 
over. Here’s the report.

85th over: Pakistan 207-5 (Shafiq 14, Sarfraz 20). Sarfraz again takes a run 
from the first ball of Hazlewood’s over down to fine leg. Shafiq does broadly 
the same to square leg when he gets the chance, after missing a ball sprayed 
down the legside before it. Rare from Big Josh, perhaps a bit shirty after the 
missed chance in his previous set. Back on point, a short ball darts back at 
Sarfraz, getting his gloves out of the way at the last moment. Perhaps that 
shook him up a bit as he responded by flaying at a ball well outside the 
off-stump to end the over, thankfully for him playing and missing. That would 
have been an ugly way to go. Eventful as always.

Can’t recall him ever putting one down back there. Shafiq leaves a couple, 
defends a couple, gets under a bouncer then digs out a yorker. A maiden it is.

83rd over: Pakistan 205-5 (Shafiq 13, Sarfraz 19). Sarfraz grabs a couple off 
Hazlewood down to fine leg first ball of the session. He’s into his 25th over 
and hasn’t picked up a wicket despite being Australia’s best. Frustrating times 
when sitting on 97 Test victims. Deserves a bag every time he has a trundle at 
the moment. And wouldn’t you know it?Steve Smith drops a sitter. Sarfraz giving 
the most conventional chance to second slip. It was coming at a decent speed 
and attempted to take it side-on to the right for reasons that aren’t entirely 
clear. It won’t cost them the Test Match, but it may very well cost them a day 
off.

Meanwhile, a ridiculous performance from Beth Mooney in the WBBL this 
afternoon at the Gabba. Playing for the Heat, she stumped four Scorchers 
batsmen before smashing 67 not out in the chase. Serious player.

More end of year jibber? Of the cricket variety? Five guys have 1000 Test runs 
to date. They are:

Root - 1471 @ 51.
Young Jonny “OBO bae” Bairstow - 1469 @ 61
Cook 1221 @ 42
Kohli 1215 @ 76
Moeen Ali 1034 @ 47
On reflection, this mostly has to do with the fact that England played 17 
Tests this year, doesn’t it? For Australia, Smith has 914 @ 61.

Top of the pops with the ball while we’re at it:

Ashwin 72 (!) @ 23
Herath 54 @ 18 (in eight Tests... freak)
Broad 47 @ 26
Starc 43 @ 21
Yasir 43 @ 37

How about another song in the four minutes before they return. Not that you 
asked, but my favourite of the year. You’re welcome.
 Go home. Baby, it’ll be alright. Put your life into the cold light.  
Me, again. Thanks Geoff. Adam Collins to see you through this long 
two-and-a-half hour session to end day four, and surely end this Test Match. I 
say surely for the lights that are on, the pink ball that is new and the sky 
that is dark. This is the first time since we’ve had Day-Night Tests in 
Australia that the final session is extending the extra 60 (and tonight 90) 
minutes. We’ve seen how hard it is to bat in the final hour when the ball is 
darting around, and Australia will have twice as long as usual. That’s my 
logic, and I’m sticking with it.

Of course, Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com 
<mailto:Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com> - take your best shot. That’s 
@collinsadam <http://www.twitter.com/collinsadam>on the idiot machine. You know 
what, let’s have a song. In the seasonal spirit, I’m going to throw you my 
favourite Christmas song. An unusual winner, but I’m an unusual person.
 “Oh, Santa. It’s been a real hard year.”  
Australia got everything they needed in that session, with the wickets of 
Azhar, Misbah and Younis. They chipped away and chipped away, and while a few 
runs were scored, the guys with the potential to play long innings were 
eventually squeezed out. Starc, Lyon and Bird got a wicket apiece, as Australia 
conceded 72 in the session for those three wickets. It won’t have hurt Azhar 
and Younis to have made a few though, and to have done so here on the bounciest 
deck they’ll face this tour. On the more placid surfaces at theCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Grounds of Melbourne and Sydney, 
perhaps Pakistan’s batsmen can put up more of a show. That’s it for me, Geoff 
Lemon out until Boxing Day, and Adam Collins will be back shortly to take you 
through the last stanza.

 
82nd over: Pakistan 203-5 (Shafiq 13, Sarfraz 17)

Way down leg to start with, as is often Starc’s way. It’s also his way to take 
a wicket in his first over. Sarfraz blocks a couple, then squats and reaches 
wide of off stump to drive a bump ball to gully. Can’t help feeling for ball on 
bat, can Sarfraz. Second-last ball, Lyon pulls out a dive to raise himself a 
few more cheers, then the last is targeting the pads, and Sarfraz whips three 
nicely played runs away. He’s scoring quickly again.

 
81st over: Pakistan 200-5 (Shafiq 13, Sarfraz 14)


Here’s that new ball, in the hand of one Joshua Hazleberger. He’s too wide 
with the first couple of balls and they don’t trouble Shafiq, then he targets 
the stumps bit is blocked out. Two minutes until the dinner break as he bowls 
his fourth ball. The Australians would love to squeeze an extra over in. 
Hazlewood is getting relatively quickly thorugh his over but he still has a 
long run-up. He’s turning quickly, bowling wide once more. Hazlewood might win 
this one... he does. By a matter of eight seconds. Bowls another dot, which 
means Umpire Illingworth has time to get in position, and Starc will get a 
crack at the Pakistan batsmen.


 
80th over: Pakistan 200-5 (Shafiq 13, Sarfraz 14)


It’s not so much happy hour as last drinks, tequila shots, and the bouncers 
are circling. Sarfraz comes fdown the wicket at Bird, kneels, and slog-sweeps 
him towards midwicket. Mistimes the whack and gets three runs through deep 
backward. Shafiq times his shot much more prettily, a flick off the pads that 
does make the rope. Then a single from the last ball and the Pakistan 200 is 
raised.


 
79th over: Pakistan 192-5 (Shafiq 8, Sarfraz 11)

A lot of fun to watch, is Sarfraz, the Pakistani wicketkeeper with a curious 
resemblance to Mick Molloy. Comes down the wicket to Lyon and drives three runs 
through point, nicely done. Shafiq taps a single, Sarfraz follows suit, both to 
the posh side of the pitch, then Shafiq comes down andgoes whack down the 
ground for four mor runs. Nine from it. Oh yes, new ball’s a-coming.

 
78th over: Pakistan 183-5 (Shafiq 3, Sarfraz 7)

I suppose Sarfraz figures he might as well make what he can before the new 
ball comes along, with Starc and Hazlewood to wield it. Slaps Bird throug point 
for four, glances him for a single.

 
77th over: Pakistan 177-5 (Shafiq 3, Sarfraz 1)

Lyon continues his good spell, mixing up his speed and flight and length. The 
first ball so very nearly has Sarfraz: it pitched outside off, then hit the pad 
as he went to sleep. Umpire Gould said that was hitting outside the line, and 
even if the Australians had reviews left, DRS would have showed that the impact 
on pad was umpire’s call. It’s a maiden, despite the best efforts of Sarfraz, 
who plays a shot to each point of the compass but can’t get any one of them 
through.
