The wine critic Jilly Goolden lives with her husband, dogs, horses, peacocks 
and former battery hens (their three children are all grown up) down a lane of 
rhododendrons in the Ashdown Forest in Sussex. Here she provides peaceful 
accommodation for two in a converted 1920s pump house a bit further down the 
lane, and regularly invites up to 14 people to turn up on her Arts and Crafts 
doorstep for an afternoon of non-stop drinking at herWine Room 
<http://www.jillygoolden.com/>.

“Have a sniff,” she says, putting her nose into a glass of chenin blanc and 
going quiet. “Sort of honey… honeydew melon… a little smell of cream… it 
reminds you of lying in bed upstairs and having a tiny waft of someone 
marvellous having made you breakfast downstairs. You get that smell of toast 
and butter… mmm.”

Goolden made her name in the 1980s when she and fellow Food and Drink 
presenter Oz Clarke vied to describe with unfettered precision exactly how this 
or that wine tasted. Best remembered is her gamay (the grape in beaujolais) 
“like trainers on hot tarmac”. At the same time the nation was falling in love 
with all things red, white and rosé.

Today, Goolden readily admits that when you’re drinking wine down the pub: 
“You just drink it, for heaven’s sake. Why not? But you’re probably missing out 
on 50% of what it has to say to you.”

On the course I went on she kicked off with a history of viniculture from 
ancient Egypt to the current boom in India, before demonstrating how to hold a 
sip of wine in your tongue, pursing your lips as if you’re about to whistle, 
then breathing in to pull the air across the wine to the back of your throat – 
where, crucially, you can smell and taste it at the same time, all the while 
“looking like a dog’s bottom”.

I was the only person in the group who was “anatomically challenged in the 
tongue department”, as Goolden kindly put it. “Let me see,” she said, with 
appalled fascination, as my tongue refused to move. “Can you curl up the sides? 
No…”

Over the next four hours we sniffed/slurped/dribbled – it didn’t really feel 
like drinking as such – 12 examples of old- and new-world charm from Austria to 
Australia, plus two glasses of English fizz, with a short break for tea and 
cake – “which is very unfriendly to wine but you have to tough it out”. (It was 
also one of the few mentions of food all afternoon.)

The group sat round a long table on high-backed chairs – two big, forbidding 
spittoons untroubled in the centre – under the steady gaze of Goolden’s 
Spitting Image puppet over in the corner. Among the tasters were artists, 
publishers and three people in the wine business, one the owner of a small 
vineyard. The real Jilly – petite, beady, standing off to one side with her own 
elegant spittoon – was on her mettle: “You’re frightfully technical, Martin. I 
honestly don’t know if they harvest after the equinox.”

 The Pump House guest cottage 
People arrived and left by taxi (East Grinstead station isn’t far away) or 
made a weekend of it. There’s plenty of local accommodation, and a pretty old 
pub, the Hatch, down the road, with a bar wreathed in dried hops, that does 
food. Take a torch for the walk back from the pub if you’re staying at the Pump 
House, which has antique doorways imported from the Hindu Kush, hens wandering 
past the bedroom window and new-laid eggs in the fridge.

What did I learn from the course? Well, nothing about the price of each wine, 
which might have been enlightening. I will never forget, though, that pinot 
noir is the holy grail. That riesling is the class swot. That cabernet 
sauvignon is a grape of easy virtue. And that you shun chardonnay at your 
peril, because it’s the seductive David Beckham of wines, a global star, with 
Victoria as the oak, “acting like a sort of bra, I feel. What it does is it 
picks the fruit up and offers it up, as it were. So you can have a very 
flat-chested chardonnay, but you can give it a little bit of uplift and get it 
up to a B cup, or you could add a bit more toasty oak and wallop it up to maybe 
a C or a D. And then you can go the full extra mile and have a silicone 
implant… In all combinations it is gorgeous. I defy anyone to not love it.”

southerly vineyard, on St Mary’s in the Scilly Isles. Until earlier this year,

classic and a reserve), these have also been incorporated into the fun and 
informal sessions. A the moment, the wine is on sale only in the deli at the
