Few things make Game of Thrones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> fans happier then 
the chance to get our geek on and argue the finer points of George RR Martin's 
world. So it is that I find myself in Northern Ireland's picturesque Ballintoy 
Harbour – used as the landing spot for the windswept Iron Islands in season two 
– waving my hands around and saying: "Well, you know, I actually feel a little 
sorry for Theon Greyjoy: he's generally humiliated at every turn by pretty much 
everyone he knows and now he's just spent an entire season being tortured by a 
nameless sadist. I sort of think the guy deserves a break …"

My fellow Game of Thrones (GoT) fan merely sighs and says, with a shake of the 
head: "He's still an idiot, and a pretty ungrateful one at that."
 Ballintoy Harbour, Northern Ireland 
Ballintoy, a short drive from the Giant's Causeway 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/giants-causeway/> on County Antrim's beautiful 
Causeway Coast, is just one of a number of stops on our bus trip around 
Northern Ireland, organised as part of a joint initiative between theNorthern 
Ireland Tourist Board <http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/> and Northern 
Ireland Screen <http://www.northernirelandscreen.co.uk/> to promote tourism 
within the country.

For just as thousands of Lord of The Rings fans flocked to New Zealand 
<http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-visit/lord-of-the-rings-locations>
 eager to pretend they were leaving the Shire like Frodo or battling the dead 
with Aragorn and Legolas, so the success of GoT has drawn increasing numbers to 
Northern Ireland. Government-backed agency Northern Ireland Screen admits to 
being hopeful the series "will deliver the widest media exposure Northern 
Ireland has received outside of politics and the Troubles".

It could be right. San Francisco-based travel company Viator recently added a 
nine-hour tour of the series' Northern Irish locations 
<http://www.viator.com/tours/Belfast/Private-Tour-%E2%80%98Game-of-Thrones-and-Giants-Causeway-Tour-from-Belfast/d738-5844GOT>
 to its list of trips. My taxi driver from George Best Belfast City Airport 
dwelt at length on how visitors to the city increasingly asked him to "take 
them to where Game of Thrones was made", and locals were eager to talk of how

impressive museum and cultural centre that opened last year, and Game of 
Thrones were gradually changing people's perceptions of their country.
 Dothraki camp at Shillanavogy Valley, near Slemish, County Antrim. 
The GoT bus tour does hammer home just how much spectacular scenery there is 
in Northern Ireland. Hit it on the right day – when the rain has stayed home 
and the usually grey skies are blue – and you'll be rewarded with impossibly 
green fields, sparkling seas and jaw-dropping mountains fromMourne

mountain, supposedly the home of Saint Patrick, which looms over Shillanavogy 
valley (the Dothraki grasslands, where Dany first learns what being a Khaleesi 
means).
 Cushendun, Northern Ireland 
Best of all, however, is the small coastal village of Cushendun, from which 
you can see Scotland's Mull of Kintyre on a clear day. Largely owned by the 
National Trust since 1954, Cushendun, with its golden beach, great pubs and
fantastic self-catering cottages <http://www.antrim.net/>, is the perfect place 
to while away a couple of days. It's also home to some fabulously spooky caves, 
and thus better-known to GoT addicts as the place where dubious Red Priestess, 
Melisandre of Asshai birthed her murderous shadow baby.

It was easy to see why the location scouts chose them. Standing in those 
caves, with the wind whipping through and the water ominously edging in, it was 
easy to believe that we were not in 21st-century Northern Ireland but back in 
Martin's world – that dark, depressing and dangerous place where the only 
certainty is that you win or you die.

There's an exhibition, too …
 Game of Thrones exhibition, Belfast 
Die-hard fans desperate for a fix after tonight's season finale can head to 
Titanic Belfast, where anexhibition of costumes, weaponry and artefacts from 
the show <http://interact.discovernorthernireland.com/gotexhibition> runs until 
17 June. Among the best bits are the chance to sit on the Iron Throne, to 
examine Dany's dragons in model form, and to take part in your very own 
stimulated Battle of Blackwater. Yes, the fiery arrows are included.

It's not just about Northern Ireland

While Northern Ireland accounts for the bulk of Game of Thrones locations, 
it's not the only place where the series is filmed. Croatia, Morocco and 
Iceland also provide otherworldly backdrops to the backstabbing and bribery of 
Westeros and beyond.
