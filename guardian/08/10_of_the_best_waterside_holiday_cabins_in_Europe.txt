Hut in the middle of nowhere, Poland


A listing that reads “hut in the middle of nowhere” can’t help but pique the 
interest, and this one’s description is pretty accurate. Thewooden hut in 
Darżkowo, northern Poland, is a perfect retreat for anyone who wants to be cut 
off from the world for a bit. Though modestly furnished, it has two bedrooms, a 
kitchen and a fireplace, and is on the edge of a small lake. Its owners are a 
city family who “searched, searched and searched” for a place where they could 
“shelter from their troubles”; now, they’ve shared it with the world. It’s not 
the only lonely waterside spot we came across in Poland, though. Right on the 
border with Germany, we found the beautifulcabane en forêt

the Oder river.

A country of 187,888 lakes, Finland isn’t short of places for watery 
exploration. Lake Puruvesi, in the easterly Saimaa region, is a stunning 
setting for an escape. As the name suggests, Puruvesi is known for its 
incredibly clean water, making it an inviting place to swim, as well as go on 
fishing or boat trips. This particular cabin –Lakeside Nightingale – is close 
to a conservation area and the world’s largest wooden church, in nearby 
Kerimäki. It is a newly built two-bedroom villa with a contemporary interior 
designed for relaxation: it’s full of light, with a log fire and a decked 
terrace from which to enjoy the view. Add to this an electric sauna and it’s 
the perfect setup for anyone seeking a Nordic adventure.

It’s hard to write anything about Europe’s lakes without mentioning Slovenia, 
home to the incredibly photogenic Lake Bled. Of course, Bled can get very busy 
during the tourist season, but that doesn’t mean there’s no solace there. This
lakeside cabin, 15 minutes’ walk from the main town, has a private beach, 
making it the perfect spot for anyone who wants to make the most of swimming in 
the cool blue water, which, despite its Alpine surroundings, stays at a 
pleasant temperature from June to September. The cabin has a fully equipped 
kitchen and bathroom, as well as a decking area and bikes that guests can 
borrow for free.

Undoubtedly the most “back to nature” of our selection, Kolarbyn eco-lodge 
forgoes electricity and running water for wooden huts, sheepskin rugs and 
candles. Two minutes’ walk from Skärsjön lake and surrounded by fairytale 
forest, these 12 huts sleep two in traditional charcoal-burner style (Kolarbyn 
produces charcoal using ancient kiln methods). Each hut has a wood fire and 
there are blueberries to pick from the green roof – though there is also a log 
cabin for those who prefer a bit more room and some traditional bedding. Guests 
have to chop their own firewood and cooking is all done on a barbecue. However, 
some timeless luxury can be attained, thanks to a wood-fired floating sauna, 
with room for 10 people, which can be hired. For those keen to explore the 
area, the campsite runs activities including a mindfulness hike, beaver safari 
or wilderness riding expedition.

These four ridiculously quaint, red-painted wooden Nordic cabins are on a 
small bay in Flam, Aurland. With snow-capped peaks coated with deep green pine 
forests all around, holidaying here is like being in a Christmas card. The 
interiors are cosy, wood-panelled spaces, but still have all the mod cons 
expected on a longer self-catering holiday (Wi-Fi, TV, DVD player, washing 
machine). Each cottage has a rowing boat (included in the price) and they are 
suitable for breaks at any time of year – when the days are long and balmy, or 
when the valley is covered in sparkling snow.

Icelandic terrain that surrounds it, woodenVilla Lola is on the furthest inland 
tip of Eyjafjörður , the longest fjord in Iceland. Anyone with a taste for 
design will be instantly attracted to this unique place to stay, and it’s also 
perfectly positioned for hikes up Súlur mountain, horseback tours under the 
midnight sun or a round at the 18-hole golf course. In the winter, there’s 
skiing at a local resort or dog sledding – another magical Arctic experience.

Another unique waterside retreat can be found at the Lima Escape campsite in 
the vastPeneda-Gerês national park 
<http://www.icnf.pt/portal/naturaclas/ordgest/poap/popnpg/popnpg-doc>, known 
for its river valleys, oak forests and undulating geography. As well as casual 
camping (and glamping, thanks to a couple of bell tents), the highlight of the 
site has to be two modernist treehouse cabins (one sleeps two and the other 
four) perched on wooden beams among the trees. The site is in a bend of the 
Lima river, a magical shady spot popular with hikers. The area lends itself to 
high-elevation treks, mountain biking, climbing and horse riding. The nearby 
town of Lindoso has a weekly market on the riverside. In the evenings, there is 
a bar and cafe at the campsite, for those who can tear themselves away from the 
cabin’s peaceful terrace.

If the charcoal huts at Kolarbyn sound a bit too Bear Grylls-y, this cabin 
retreat three hours west in Värmland make a good alternative. There are two 
wood cabins on the site, both traditionally made, both with green roof, cosy 
bedrooms and fully appointed kitchen and facilities. And, of course, there is 
also a sauna. Both sleep four. and one cabin has an outhouse that could 
accommodate two more people. Positioned right on the water, cabins each have 
their own canoe or boat, which can be used to seek out secret picnic spots 
among the network of lakes. Inland, there is dense forest to discover, full of 
wildlife from beavers to elks.

of the most romantic, wasCaru Cabin at Terre et Toi resort in the Dordogne. 
Built by hand and perched on a wooden platform over a private pond, the cabin 
has everything required for a honeymoon-type hideaway: paper lanterns, skylight 
above the bed, wood-burning stove and sun deck. There are a few other glamping 
huts at the site, other guests to socialise and eat with around the wood-fired 
pizza oven, and bikes to hire for a ride to the local village.
