Microsoft’s seemingly getting pretty offended over the whole “iPad Pro is a 
computer thing <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zPYW6Ipgok>”. In its eyes, a 
keyboard does not a PC make, and it’s all starting to get just a little catty.

Microsoft’s latest advert for the Windows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows> 10 PC-in-a-tablet Surface Pro 
4 takes the two arch rival’s tit-for-tat war of words to the next level - 
irritating voice assistants.

It’s Apple’s iPad Pro-powered Siri versus what is meant to be Microsoft’s 
Cortana, having a party of sorts, despite neither sounding quite like they do 
when you’re trying to actually use them. Apparently getting a keyboard is cause 
for celebration, because theiPad <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad> 
Pro is a computer now.

 Apple’s what’s a computer ad. 
Microsoft <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft>, of course, 
disputes the definition of a “computer”, and it all gets a bit passive 
aggressive, in the only way semi-restrained US tech firms know how.

Does this have a faint whiff of Apple’s I’m a Mac, I’m a PC 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac> of the mid-to-late 2000s to anyone 
else?
