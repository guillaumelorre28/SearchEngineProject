Tell me about it… 
Northern Ireland may not be known as a foodie mecca, but head to Belfast this 
weekend and theFood and Drink Show Northern Ireland  
<http://foodanddrinkshowni.com/>will be offering artisan produce, craft ales 
and celebrity chefs. Much of the produce comes from the fertile shores 
surrounding Strangford Lough (or Strangford Loch), around 45 minutes’ drive 
from the city centre, so once you’ve tasted the wares, head out to their 
source. The recently openedPoacher’s Pocket <http://poacherspocketlisbane.com/> 
in Lisbane is a restaurant with a well-stocked farm shop, whileDaft Eddy’s 
<http://dafteddys.co.uk/cgi-bin/mainpage/> on Sketrick Island has a smart 
terrace with views of the water and serves local Portavogie scampi and crab 
claws from the lough. The shop atPheasants’ Hill Farm 
<http://www.www.pheasantshillfarm.com> in Downpatrick sells organic, free-range 
ham and bacon, but call first to make sure it’s open.

No shortage of food then, what about a drink? 
The Dufferin Arms  <https://www.facebook.com/dufferinarms>in Killyleagh serves 
pints of well-kept Guinness in an interior that hasn’t changed for decades: the 
wood-panelled snugs are perfect for hunkering down on a wet afternoon with a 
seafood platter (£29.95 for two) and a bowl of chips.

And when I’m not feasting? 
Watch the Brent geese, recent arrivals from High Arctic Canada, at Castle 
Espie Wetlands <http://www.wwt.org.uk/wetland-centres/castle-espie/>, then 
drive along a string of islands linked by a winding road to the ruins of 
fifth-century Nendrum monastery on Mahee Island.

Anywhere to stay under £100? 
Cowey Cottage <http://www.coweycottage.com/>, a tasteful well-appointed 
self-catering cottage on the Ards peninsula, three miles from Portaferry, is 
surrounded by rolling landscape and converted farm buildings. It sleeps four 
and costs from £395 a week.

Anything else I should know? 
 The village of Kearney near Portaferry has been restored to its original 
state as a fishing village by the National Trust. There’s no fishing these 
days, but it is an atmospheric place to wander around.

Do I need a car? 
A car is preferable for easy exploring, although Ulsterbus  
<http://www.translink.co.uk/Services/Ulsterbus-Service-Page/>service 10A takes 
you from Belfast along the Ards peninsula as far as Portaferry, and the 16E 
goes from Downpatrick to Strangford. A regular ferry sails between Portaferry 
and Strangford.
