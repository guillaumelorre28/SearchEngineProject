It is a question we had pondered for years: just how do you navigate the 
world's biggest arts festival? The mass of artists, performers, day-trippers 
and visitors – never mind residents – can feel overwhelming, and knowing where 
to go to eat, drink and explore can be just as difficult. So we decided to ask 
the most loyal of visitors – the comedians who return to Edinburgh each year – 
to help us through the maze with hints on how to live the Fringe like a 
performer. Here are a few of their top tips.

Best for breakfast – and hangover cure

Snax Café Overlooking the Meadows, Snax Café is known locally as a proper 
greasy spoon and a decent place to head to shake off a heavy Fringe night. As 
double actHorse & Louis <http://horseandlouis.com/> say, "The clientele are 
real people, working people, people who are genuinely looking for chicken curry 
with a side of haggis at 6.30am and who expect, nay demand, that every meal 
comes with chips. The bacon is so thick you could use it as a door stop, and 
the eggs, if hard boiled, would do some damage down a 10-pin lane."
Address 118 Buccleuch Street (0131 662 9009; snaxcafe.com

Best for lunch/brunch


Cheesee Peasee For those looking to chase down a true Edinburgh delight, 
Cheesee Peasee is a mobile food van which serves up gourmet French cheeses in 
and around Edinburgh. Hailing from Lyon, Cédric will slice you a portion of 
savoury delight – the perfect accompaniment to a late-afternoon picnic in the 
park.Eric Lampaert <http://www.ericlampaert.com/> says: "Everyone from miles 
around comes to seek cheese guidance from this Gouda guru and if you impress 
him with his native tongue, he'll (probably) slice you an extra 50g of 
Camembert. Merci beaucoup!"

Best place to escape the crowds

North Berwick Those looking to escape the hectic pace of the Fringe could 
follow in the footsteps ofMark Thomas <http://www.markthomasinfo.co.uk/> and 
cycle to North Berwick. "If you want a temporary escape from the sometimes 
insular world of the Edinburgh Festival," says Thomas, "nothing quite does the 
job like fish and chips by the seaside in North Berwick after a cycle. One of 
my favourite days during any festival was visiting the Highland Games in North 
Berwick. What's not to like? Fairground rides, pipe bands, big things being 
thrown, the sun out, fish and chips, all good in their own right but together…"

Best for a pre-show pint


Under The Stairs Nestled in an alcove under the main street between Bistro 
Square and the Grassmarket, Under The Stairs is a hideaway that serves up 
top-notch food and drink within easy distance of most of the main venues. 
Regular patron Keith Farnan says: "I snuck in the back door of what I thought 
was the kitchen and was greeted by soft armchairs, an array of fine foods and a 
sense of peace that is rarely found in an Edinburgh pub, but that slowly fades 
away into a pleasantly raucous evening."
Address 3a Merchant Street (0131 466 8550; underthestairs.org

Best for a post-show pint/bite

Port O'Leith Edinburgh is not short of fantastic pubs and lively clubs which 
carry on late into the night, but if you takeJim Jefferies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/apr/11/comedy-gold-jim-jeffries-contraband>
's advice, then the Port O'Leith is a good choice for a post-show pint. "I used 
to disappear here when I didn't fancy having a mad night," says Jefferies, "and 
this pub has it all: great atmosphere, great people, the walls and ceiling have 
so much naval history and bits and bobs from all over the world hanging off it 
or stuck to it, and the drinks are reasonably priced – not the £4 that most 
venues charge nowadays for a pint. So yes, check this place out!"
Address 58 Constitution Street (0131 554 3568)

Best place to lay your head

 Zoe Lyons's 'Edinburgh guilty pleasure': The Witchery hotel. 
The Witchery After a long day at the festival, one of the top places to lay 
your head (if you can afford it) would have to be The Witchery on the Royal 
Mile. Set just down from the Castle, the hotel is in the thick of the Fringe 
action, yet it occupies a corner which at night is a little oasis of quiet. The 
hotel also comes with a fantastic restaurant recommended byZoe Lyons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/02/this-weeks-new-live-comedy>, who 
says: "It is my Edinburgh guilty pleasure. Practically underneath the castle, 
it is so beautiful at night with candles on the steps as you descend into the 
Secret Garden dining room. It also looks a bit like it has been built as the 
set of a Dracula movie, with candelabras, drapes and goblet glasses."
Address Castlehill, Royal Mile (0131 225 5613; thewitchery.com
