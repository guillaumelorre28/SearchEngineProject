A number of lines in the robustly applauded speech delivered by Melania Trump 
at the Republican national convention on Monday night appear to have been 
lifted verbatim from a speechMichelle Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michelleobama> delivered at the 2008 
Democratic convention.

“Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values, that you work hard 
for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say 
you’re going to do,” Obamatold the gathering of Democrats in 2008 
<http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93963863>.


“And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them 
on to the next generation. Because we want our children – and all children in 
this nation – to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is 
the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.”

Trump told GOP delegates on Monday: “From a young age, my parents impressed on 
me the values that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is 
your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise.

“That you treat people with respect. They taught and showed me values and 
morals in their daily life. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to 
our son, and we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to 
follow, because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit 
to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to 
work for them.”

to point out that lines Donald Trump’s wife spoke about the necessity of hard 
work and strong family values seemed familiar.

The Trump campaign has denied accusations of plagiarism.

On Tuesday morning, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said it was “just 
absurd” to claim thatMelania Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/melania-trump> had plagiarised the first 
lady.

“There’s no cribbing of Michelle Obama’s speech,” Manafort told CNN, adding 
“there’s no feeling on her part that she did it.” Manafort suggested that she 
was simply using “words that are common words”.

In an initial statement issued at 2am, Jason Miller, the campaign’s senior 
communications adviser and Trump’s speechwriter, had said Melania Trump’s 
speech included “fragments” of others’ speeches that “reflected her own 
thinking”, though did not directly answer accusations of plagiarism.

Miller added that the speech was produced by Melania Trump’s “team”. This runs 
counter to herown statements in an interview with NBC 
<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-news/watch/exclusive-the-trumps-speak-with-matt-lauer-727480899958>
 prior to the speech, in which she claimed to have written the speech herself.

A campaign source suggested to the Guardian that the blame lay with Rick 
Gates, a longtime aide to top Trump strategist Paul Manafort. The source said 
Gates signed off on the speech and edited it.

Manafort is a veteran Republican operative with connections to a number of 
foreign regimes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients>
, including that of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. The 
strategist, who joined the Trump campaign in March to advise on a potential 
delegate fight, soon gained control of the entire campaign andedged out 
campaign manager Corey Lewandowski

Manafort took advantage of his decades of experience as well as the fact that 
he refused to accept a salary from Trump as he moved into the presumptive 
nominee’s orbit. A veteran of campaigns going back to Gerald Ford’s 1976 
re-election effort, Manafort moved to hire longtime advisers and associates 
such as Gates.

Jon Favreau, a White House speechwriter for the Obama administration, pointed 
out that Michelle Obama’s writer used to work for Hillary Clinton:

Sarah Hurwitz, Michelle's head speechwriter, used to be Hillary's. So the 
Trump campaign plagiarized from a Hillary speechwriter.

Plagarism scandals have periodically haunted American politics. Infamously, 
the 1988 presidential campaign of the current vice-president, Joe Biden, was 
ended over allegations that the then senator from Delaware had plagiaried Neil 
Kinnock, the leader of the British Labour party at the time.

In an interview 
<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-news/watch/exclusive-the-trumps-speak-with-matt-lauer-727480899958>
 with Matt Lauer of NBC, Melania Trump said of her speech: “I wrote it with a 
little help as possible.”
