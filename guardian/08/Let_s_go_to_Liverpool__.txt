Tell me about it
It’s not just about football and the Beatles. Liverpool Fashion Week 
<http://www.liverpoolfashionweek.co.uk/>, the largest such event in the UK 
outside London, starts on 13 October and makes a point of being about fashion 
for everyone: tickets to catwalk events are just £10 (under-14s free). And ... 
OK, it is sort of about the Fab Four ... theBeatles Story 
<http://www.beatlesstory.com/> museum has teamed up with LA’s Grammy Museum for 
an exhibition, opening on, called 16 October The British Invasion: How 1960s 
Groups Conquered America. It includes previously unseen photos of the Rolling 
Stones and memorabilia from the likes of Ringo Starr and Lead Belly. And on 7 
November,Transmitting Andy Warhol 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/transmitting-andy-warhol>
, opens at Tate Liverpool (to 8 February).

If all that makes me hungry?Just across the dock, enjoy Venetian small plates 
atSalt House Bacaro <http://www.salthousebacaro.co.uk/>: try delicious pizzette 
with toppings of pulled pork and fontina cheese, or roasted cod with 
caramelised cauliflower. If you’re splashing out,The Art School 
<http://www.theartschoolrestaurant.co.uk/> is a new fine dining restaurant and 
bar from Paul Askew, one of the region’s best-loved chefs. The smart setting 
(in a former Home for Destitute Children dating from 1888) complements dishes 
like seared king scallops with smoked pork loin. The prix-fixe lunch menu – 
three courses for £29 – is great value.

Time for a tipple?
There’s a speakeasy vibe at tiny Jenny’s  <https://www.facebook.com/JennysBar>
Bar on Fenwick Street, with its velvet curtains and plush banquettes. Cocktails 
are tasty – try Jenny’s Daisy (£8).Motel 
<https://www.facebook.com/MotelBarLiverpool> is a new self-styled dive bar on 
Fleet Street, all neon, loud juke box and fun vibe.

Anywhere to stay for under £100?
Sure. Z Liverpool has cool compact en suite rooms at bargain rates – all have 
nice big TVs with Sky Sports and Sky Movies included (doubles from £35,

Do I need a car?
No. All You Need is Love... and a train ticket (two hours, 13 minutes on 
Virgin Trains from London; other networks run from major cities).
