Ten US sailors who were captured by Revolutionary Guards after entering 
Iranian waters have been released, soothing tensions during a week in whichIran 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran> is expected to receive the first wave 
of sanctions relief from the landmark nuclear accords.

The US military <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military> confirmed 
the sailors’ release after the Guards issued a statement claiming they were 
freed into international waters after an apology from Washington.

“We decided to release them after conducting a technical investigation and 
consultations with our national security officials, and also after establishing 
that their trespassing into the waters of the Islamic Republic was 
unintentional and also receiving apology from them,” read the statement 
published on the Fars news agency, which is affiliated to the Guards.

The sailors’ two small navy craft brieflywent missing on Tuesday while 
crossing the Gulf from Kuwait to Bahrain. Pentagon sources later said the 
vessels entered Iranian waters because of technical difficulties.

US sailor apologizes for vessels entering Iranian waters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jan/13/us-sailor-apologizes-iranian-television-video>
On Wednesday, the Pentagon said: “Ten US navy sailors safely returned to US 
custody today, after departing Iran. There are no indications that the sailors 
were harmed during their brief detention.”

“The sailors departed Farsi Island at 8.43am [GMT], aboard the two Riverine 
Command boats that they had been operating when they lost contact with the US 
navy. They were later transferred ashore by US navy aircraft.”


John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said he was pleased that the sailors 
had been returned. “I also want to thank the Iranian authorities for their 
cooperation and quick response,” he told an audience at the National Defense 
University in Washington.

“These are always situations which, as everybody here knows, have the ability, 
if not properly guided, to get out of control. I’m appreciative for the quick 
and appropriate response of the Iranian authorities.”

The sailors had been treated properly, an indication of improved diplomatic 
relations, Kerry said: “I think we can all imagine how a similar situation 
might have played out three or four years ago. In fact, it is clear that today 
this kind of issue was able to be peacefully resolved, and officially resolved, 
and that is a testament to the critical role that diplomacy plays in keeping 
the country safe, secure and strong.”

The sailors received a medical screening on Wednesday morning aboard the 
guided missile cruiser USS Anzio, the Pentagon said. They were then expected to 
be transferred to the aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman, from where they will 
be flown ashore at an unspecified point for reintegration.

The Iranian claim of an apology was ambiguous. It was not clear whether Kerry 
had officially apologised during phone communications with his Iranian 
counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, or whether the apology, if true, had come 
from the sailors themselves.


Kerry thanked Iran for the swift resolution of the incident, tweeting:
John Kerry (@JohnKerry) 
Peaceful and efficient resolution of this issue is a testament to the critical 
role diplomacy plays in keeping our country secure & strong.

The US defence secretary, Ash Carter, said: “I am pleased that 10 US navy 
sailors have departed Iran and are now back in US hands. I want to personally 
thank secretary of state John Kerry for his diplomatic engagement with Iran to 
secure our sailors’ swift return. Around the world, the US navy routinely 
provides assistance to foreign sailors in distress, and we appreciate the 
timely way in which this situation was resolved.”

A direct conversation between the Iranian foreign minster and US counterpart 
would have been unthinkable just five years ago, and Carter’s statement is 
indicative of the improved diplomatic relations between Washington and Tehran.

The Revolutionary Guards’ navy chief and US officials saidmechanical trouble 
with one of the boats caused them to drift into Iranian territorial waters.

The 10 US detainees – nine men and one woman – were held overnight at an 
Iranian base on Farsi Island

Fars said the two American boats were more than a mile inside Iranian waters 
when they were detained. The episode came amidheightened regional tensions

The Revolutionary Guards patrol Iranian waters in the Gulf, especially near 
the strait of Hormuz, a vital passageway through which a fifth of the world’s 
oil passes in tankers.

Iran’s navy has routine professional exchanges with its US and UK 
counterparts, but there have been incidents of heightened tension. In 2007, Iran
captured 15 Royal Navy sailors and marines during a maritime inspection near 
Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/28/politics.iran> and held 
them for 13 days in a disputed episode that drew the world’s attention.

In December, the US accused Revolutionary Guards vessels of firing several 
unguided rockets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/10/us-claims-iran-fired-rockets-close-to-aircraft-carrier-in-strait-of-hormuz>

The swift release of the Americans contradicted speculation that the hardline 
Revolutionary Guards were seeking to sabotage improving relations between Iran 
and the west days before the planned implementation of the nuclear deal reached 
in Vienna in July. It has been established that the US sailors drifted into 
Iranian territorial waters and that the timing of the incident was irrelevant 
to the lifting of sanctions.

The handling of the issue signals a new pattern of behaviour by the Guards, 
which haveused similar circumstances to flex muscles both at home and abroad in 
the past. Adnan Tabatabai, an Iranian analyst, tweeted:

The Revolutionary Guards are controlled directly by Iran’s supreme leader, 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. President Hassan Rouhani’s government has not control 
over the Guards behaviour internally or externally.

In an unusual move, the Guards last week condemned the attack by a group of 
hardliners on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, showing an approach in line with 
that of the Rouhani administration.

Iran is believed to be only days away from implementation day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/john-kerry-iran-nuclear-deal-update>
, when the International Atomic Energy Agency will verify that Tehran has taken 
all the necessary steps under the nuclear accord for the west to lift economic 
sanctions. All nuclear-related sanctions, including an embargo on the imports 
of Iranian oil, will be lifted by the EU. The US will waive them by the order 
of the president. At least $100bn (£74bn) in frozen assets will also be 
released to Iran.

Rouhani is pushing efforts to speed up implementation of the deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/08/iran-president-hassan-rouhani-post-sanctions-era-new-year>
 to bring about tangible relief from sanctions before parliamentary elections 
in February. Hardliners are worried about how such an event would bolster his 
profile just before the election period.

Once Iran <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran> finishes swapping the core 
of a heavy water nuclear reactor at Arak with cement, they will receive an 
influx of cash under the July deal.

However, deep-seated acrimony between Washington and Tehran has hardly ebbed. 
The US is expected to launch a different series of sanctions in response to 
Iran’s recent ballistic missile tests, which are outside the scope of the 
nuclear deal but violate a UN security council prohibition.
