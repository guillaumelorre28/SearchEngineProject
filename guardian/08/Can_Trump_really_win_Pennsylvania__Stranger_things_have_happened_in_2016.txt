For decades, Republican presidential candidates have had the same relationship 
with the state of Pennsylvania that Charlie Brown hadwith a football

With 20 electoral votes, the Keystone state has always been a tempting prize 
to aim for. But since 1988, in a geographically diverse state described by 
Clinton aide James Carville as “Philadelphia on one side, Pittsburgh on the 
other and Alabama in between”, the GOP has seen that prize swept away from its 
sights.

As John Brabender <https://twitter.com/johnbrabender>, a veteran Republican 
consultant in the state, told the Guardian, Pennsylvania is simply tough for 
any Republican to win. He or she would always need to build a “strange 
coalition”, he said, “of blue-collar conservative Democrats that are in the 
western side of the state with moderate college-educated professional women in 
the eastern side of the state”.

Traditionally, western Pennsylvania has been filled with rock-solid union 
Democrats while suburbanPhiladelphia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia> has been filled with loyal 
and middle-class Republicans.

Washington County, for example, is a 95% white industrial area south-west of 
Pittsburgh. It has only been lost by two Democratic presidential candidates in 
the past half-century: George McGovern and Barack Obama.

Chester County is home to many of Philadelphia’s wealthiest suburbs. Obama won 
it in 2008, the first Democrat to do so since Lyndon Johnson, then lost it in 
2012 by just 500 votes. In 1988, George HW Bush won two-thirds of the vote 
there.

Obama’s results in Chester County hint at the cultural and partisan shifts of 
recent years. Accordingly, this year Donald Trump has been running strongly in 
westernPennsylvania <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania>. As 
Brabender pointed out, Trump’s message on trade and immigration reform “plays 
extremely well in the western side of the state”.

Philadelphia on one side, Pittsburgh on the other and Alabama in between
James Carville, on Pennsylvania 
He was echoed by G Terry Madonna 
<http://www.fandm.edu/politics/dr-g-terry-madonna>, a professor at Franklin and 
Marshall College and another experienced Pennsylvania pollster. He told the 
Guardian: “This is the region that Trump has made a special appeal to. He talks 
about manufacturing and trade deals. He wants to bring coal back.”

There were still demographic limitations, Madonna said. “The problem [for 
Trump] is that these are not big counties. You’re talking about 15,000 to 
20,000 votes for one party, 25,000 to 30,000 votes for the other party.”

Rick Santorum, twice a Republican presidential candidate and a two-term US 
senator from Pennsylvania,told the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/03/donald-trump-campaigns-ohio-pennsylvania-democratic-voters>
 in July that Trump would do exceptionally well in the western part of the 
state.

“He’s not an orthodox candidate by any stretch of imagination,” Santorum said, 
“and that allows a lot of folks who have Ds next to their name in south-west 
Pennsylvania to feel like theRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> don’t even like him and 
[say], ‘I’m OK voting for him’.”

Obama ‘did a nice rally’

The real battle in the general election, however, will likely be in 
Philadelphia and its suburbs, in the south-eastern part of the state. Trump and 
Hillary Clinton have staged repeated events in the area in recent weeks, with 
Trump introducinghis childcare plan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-childcare-proposal-paid-maternity-leave>

debut 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/barack-obama-donald-trump-anger-hate>
 on the campaign trail for Clinton at a rally in downtown Philadelphia.

Obama racked up record margins in Philadelphia in 2012, beating Mitt Romney by 
468,000 votes. Clinton’s chances of building a similar margin in a city where 
more than 40% of residents are African American remains open to question.

I’ve always argued that Trump wasn’t getting enough votes for people who 
didn’t want to vote for Clinton
John Brabender 
Ed Rendell, a former mayor of Philadelphia and former governor of 
Pennsylvania, told the Guardian that while Obama “did a nice rally” in the 
city, “he still needs to be in the neighborhoods where African Americans live” 
if he is to increase turnout in the City of Brotherly Love.

Rendell thought, though, that by relitigating the false “birther” claim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-campaign-admits-barack-obama-was-born-in-us>
 that Obama was born in Kenya and thus ineligible for the presidency, Trump had 
enraged many African Americans.

He said: “If Trump was really smart, he would have said, ‘I was really wrong; 
I apologize; the president is an American citizen and a good, loyal American.’ 
His base would have forgiven him and he wouldn’t have enraged African American 
voters.”

Instead, Rendell said, “Trump may have done more in that press conference than 
anything Hillary can do.”

Despite this, Rendell said, Clinton would not carry Philadelphia by 468,000 
votes. He thought Clinton needed to achieve a margin of 375,000 to 400,000 in 
the fifth-largest city in the country.

The suburbs were the prize, he said, adding that he was confident Clinton 
would do well there. Romney, Rendell said, “was a very good suburban Republican 
candidate. He looked the part, was somewhat moderate and had been governor of 
Massachusetts.” The result was that Obama carried those four counties by “only” 
120,000 votes. Rendell thought it was possible Clinton, against the more 
extreme Trump, could double such margins.

Brabender, in contrast, thought Trump was making strides in the suburbs. The 
Republican nominee was doing two things right, he said. First, he was striking 
“more of a scripted tone, more presidential and certainly something that’s more 
in line with what they would expect to see out of a president.” Second, by 
emphasizing issues such as childcare, he was clearly trying to talk to suburban 
voters.

“I’ve always argued that Trump wasn’t getting enough votes for people who 
didn’t want to vote for Clinton.” he said. “And now, for the first time, they 
are starting to look at him as a viable alternative.”

As Madonna noted, however, “Trump is still losing the four suburban 
Philadelphia counties.” “He’s got to win a higher percentage of 
college-educated voters that really predominate in the Philly suburbs,” he 
said. “These are places where the economy is much more diversified.”

In particular, Madonna said, the Republican nominee has a problem with women. 
“In my poll and every poll, and national polls, he’s not doing well with 
women,” he said. “He’s losing women double digits in my state. And he’s losing 
women by double digits in the Philly suburbs.”

In Pennsylvania, Trump faces a major challenge. The Real Clear Politics 
polling averagehas him down by almost seven points 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html>
. However, it may still be a state that is worth the effort.

If Trump wins Pennsylvania, he will severely limit Clinton’s path to 270 
electoral votes. The question is whether, in a state that always requires “a 
strange coalition” for Republicans to win it, Trump can find a formula for 
success. It has already been a strange political year.
