With the news-to-you that that Green party presidential candidate Dr Jill 
Stein wasthe lead singer in a 90s alt-folk-rock band 
<http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/08/02/24418366/which-is-better-jill-steins-90s-folk-band-or-her-chance-of-being-elected-president>
, it would be easy enough to speculate that her time as a musician could have a 
negative effect on her position at the polls.

But the truth is that Stein’s hardly the only presidential contender to try 
her hand at making music. Bill Clinton was, obviously, renowned for his 
saxophonery, Barack Obama has often surprised the world with his musical 
stylings – and evenHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> once sang in public, 
despite admitting that she’s tone deaf.

So the real question is: how does Stein stack up against other presidents and 
would-be presidents? The Guardian pondered this question extensively, and came 
up with this definitive ranking of presidential musicianship.

 President Obama sings Let’s Stay Together. 
In 2012, at the Apollo Theatre, Obama surprised and delighted listeners with a 
soulful – if significantly abbreviated – rendition of Al Green’s Let’s Stay 
Together. Though he made more of an impact, emotionally and politically, whenhe 
sang Amazing Grace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/26/obama-charleston-eulogy-pinckney-amazing-grace>
 in 2015 at the funeral of Clementa Pinckney in Charleston, it was his earlier 
turn at the microphone that was truly unforgettable.

Jill Stein
&lt;a

to the Sun - Somebody&amp;#39;s Sister by Jill Stein &amp;amp; Ken Selcer (aka 
Somebody&amp;#39;s Sister)&lt;/a&gt;  Jill Stein sang lead on this 1999 
Somebody’s Sister album 
Maybe alt-folk-rock isn’t your thing (not everyone was a teenager in the 90s), 
but Stein’s vocals on Somebody’s Sister are distinctlygood. It’s hard to say 
whether it would have sold many copies at the time of its release – late 90s 
pop music had distinctly moved beyond Alanis Morissette, Jewel and Sheryl Crow 
– and the lyrics suggest that Stein and her bandmates were inspired by the 
lyricists of the 60s folk scene. But it’s still very listenable.

 Bill Clinton on the sax. 
Speaking of the 90s, there was no escaping Bill Clinton’s jazz saxophone, 
which he played most memorably on Arsenio Hall’s show in 1992, during his first 
run for president. He was more than passable, and the bands with which he 
played wereoften kinder <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-qhKBCY77A> than they 
would have been had he hopped on stage under other circumstances, but he’s 
definitely better than many of the would-be sax players I went to high school 
with, and he has a sense of musicality.

 John Kerry’s band, the Electras. 
Oh, yes, the 2004 presidential contender (and Purple Heart recipient) had a 
very brief career asa bass player in 1961 
<http://www.mtv.com/news/1485690/john-kerrys-rock-star-past-the-story-of-the-electras/>
 in the New Hampshire-based rock band the Electras. It’s very surf-rock – which 
is, perhaps, a little strange given that the band got together in Concord – and 
it’s hard to say that Kerry was the world’s most creative or technically 
proficient bassist, but it won’t make you run screaming to turn it off.

 Capital Offense does Free Bird. 
One-time Arkansas governor, perennial presidential candidate and erstwhile Fox 
News host Mike Huckabee used to play (including on the campaign trail) with his 
band, Capital Offense. And while the vocalist’s efforts at Free Bird are a bit 
off-key and the selection of the song Free Bird is a bit of a dad-rock cliche, 
Huckabee on bass does a pretty passable cover band sort of job, even if the 
band’s name is a cringe-inducing reference to the death penalty. (He did, in 
fact,carry out the death penalty while governor

 Bernie Sander’s folk music album. 
Maybe spoken-word renditions of folk music classics aren’t your thing – 
though, then, you probably don’t appreciateWilliam Shatner’s work 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lul-Y8vSr0I>, either – but there’s at least 
some sort of market for it. A small one, sure, but a market. But one suspects 
that Sanders went with the spoken word format because his voice leaves a bit to 
be desired.

And if he’s not going to get on the Green party ticket with Stein, there’s 
always the potential that a musical collaboration could be worked out.

 Mitt Romney’s version of America, the Beautiful. 
Mitt Romney <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mittromney> caught a lot of 
flak in 2012 for his rendition of America, the Beautiful, which is arguably one 
of the easiest patriotic songs to sing, but it holds up pretty well in 
retrospect. It’s not that off-key, though it’s unlikely to win any awards, and 
we can all agree that we’re glad he didn’t attempt the national anthem.

 Hillary Clinton sings ‘The Telephone Hour’ from the musical Bye Bye Birdie. 
Hillary Clinton is renowned for playing it safe … but that wasn’t always the 
case. In 1997, while first lady and after admitting that she was a terrible 
singer, she joined Rosie O’Donnell for an abbreviated version ofThe Telephone 
Hour <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS39IHmrbyY> from the musical Bye Bye 
Birdie.

The song, blessedly, is designed to be mostly spoken; Clinton admitted that it 
marked the sole time she was cast in a musical production during her school 
days and she made the cut only because she promised not to actually sing during 
the show.

 ‘Bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran.’ 
The senator’s brief rendition of the Beach Boys tune Barbara Ann made 
headlines in 2007, when McCain suggested that the often-misheard song was 
actually calling for the bombardment of Iran by US warplanes.

Warmongering aside, it also wasn’t very tuneful.

 Donald Trump sings the theme to the television show Green Acres. 
Many Americans have pronounced themselves horrified by the things that come 
out of Donald Trump’s mouth in the course of the 2016 campaign.

Most of them probably haven’t heard him sing the theme song to Green Acres.
