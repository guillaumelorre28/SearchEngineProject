After former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson endorsed Donald Trump
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> on Friday, Trump sang his 
praises.


“Having his support, really, it just adds total credence to what I’m trying to 
do and to what we’re all trying to do,” Trump said at a news conference in West 
Palm Beach, Florida.

But Trump and Carson haven’t always had such a harmonious relationship.

Trump on Carson

13 September 2015: ‘Ben is not a dealmaker at all’

I’m a dealmaker, I’ll make great deals for this country. Ben can’t do that. 
Ben’s a doctor and he’s not a dealmaker.... I think I have been a world-class 
businessman … and I make deals and I’ll bring back jobs and I’ll also bring 
back wealth to our country and I’ll build up our military so that nobody is 
going to mess with us.

But Ben is not a dealmaker at all, and I don’t think would be a very good – I 
don’t think that’s his natural ability at all.

25 October 2015: ‘Carson has never created a job’
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
Ben Carson <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ben-carson> has never created 
a job in his life (well, maybe a nurse). I have created tens of thousands of 
jobs, it's what I do.

5 November 2015: On Carson’s book 

On Twitter, Trump said that Carson’s memoir Gifted Hands was either “a total 
fabrication or, if true, even worse”. He honed in on the portion of the book in 
which Carson wrote: “I had what I only can label a pathological temper – a 
disease – and this sickness controlled me, making me totally irrational.” 
Carson’s book chronicled a point in his life when he almost attacked his mother 
with a hammer and another occasion when he tried to stab a friend with a knife.

The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying 
to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!

6 November 2015: ‘Right temperament to be president? I don’t think so’

When you suffer from pathological disease, you’re not really getting better 
unless you start taking pills and things.

Do you think that’s the right temperament to be president? I don’t think so.

 I don’t think it’s small ball if you have somebody that admits that he 
suffers from pathological disease. You don’t get better. If it’s in your 
stream, it’s in your stream.

12 November 2015: ‘There’s death, and the other thing’

There’s no cure for that ... If you’re a child molester, a sick puppy, you’re 
a child molester, there’s no cure for that. There’s only one cure – we don’t 
want to talk about that cure. That’s the ultimate cure. Well, there’s two, 
there’s death, and the other thing.


And he goes into the bathroom for a couple of hours and now he’s religious. 
And the people of Iowa believe him. Give me a break. Give me a break. It 
doesn’t happen that way. … Some people might not like it. ‘Oh, that’s not 
really nice what you say.’ Don’t be fools. Don’t be fools.


13 November 2015: ‘Violent criminal or pathological liar?’

Following his comments on 12 November, Trump released a short video on 
Instagram that suggested Carson was either a “violent criminal” or a 
“pathological liar”.

11 March 2016: ‘He’s become a friend’

We buried the hatchet – that was political stuff. We move on. It’s politics – 
he understands.




It’s such an honor to have Ben. He’s become a friend.

Carson on Trump:

9 September 2015: On what differentiates him from Trump


The biggest thing is that I realize where my success has come from, and I 
don’t any way deny my faith in God. And I think that probably is a big 
difference between us.

Carson was asked whether he believed Trump’s expressions of faith to be 
sincere.

I haven’t heard it, I haven’t seen it.

13 November 2015: Carson’s adviser, Armstrong Williams, on Trump’s 
pathological disease comments

When I spoke with Dr Carson about this yesterday, how we should respond, you 
know he was so sad about it. He said: ‘Pray for him.’ He feels sorry for him 
because he really likes Mr Trump … To see him just imploding before our very 
eyes - it’s just sad to watch.

27 January 2016: ‘He was very dishonest’

He was very dishonest ... He acts like a politician. Politicians do things 
that are politically expedient. They don’t do things that are right.

One of the reasons that I got into this race is that I’m disgusted with the 
level of dishonesty and the lack of integrity. People have come to accept it 
and say it’s part of the normal process. It’s not part of the normal process, 
and we shouldn’t accept it.

11 March 2016: ‘We buried the hatchet’

Some people said: but he said terrible things about you, how can you support 
him? Well first of all we buried the hatchet. That was political stuff. Donald 
Trump talks a lot about making America great. It’s not just talk, he means it.

There’s two Donald Trumps. There’s the Donald Trump that you see on television 
and who gets out in front of big audiences, and there’s the Donald Trump behind 
the scenes. They’re not the same person. One’s very much an entertainer, and 
one is actually a thinking individual.

There’s a different persona. Some people have gotten the impression that 
Donald Trump is a person who is not malleable. He’s much more cerebral than 
that, and a much more reasonable person than comes across.

I have found in talking with him, that there’s a lot more alignment, 
philosophically and spiritually, than I ever thought that there was.
