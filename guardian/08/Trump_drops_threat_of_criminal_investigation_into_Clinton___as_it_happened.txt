That’s it from the live blog for today. Here’s what happened:

 * Donald Trump gave a wide-ranging interview to the New York Times, after a 
bit of back and forth this morning about whether or not he was going to turn up 
for the interview. 
 * He confirmed he did not favor prosecuting Hillary Clinton, although he did 
not explain what such a hypothetical prosecution might be for. 
 * He said he had an “open mind” about whether or not to withdraw from the 
Paris climate change accords. 
 * The president-elect disavowed the “alt-right”, the collection of far-right 
groups and individuals that have been emboldened by his victory.But he denied 
his key aide Steve Bannon was part of that movement. 
 * Trump played down the prospect of conflicts of interest between his 
businesses and his presidency, saying: “The law’s totally on my side, the 
president can’t have a conflict of interest.” But he admitted he “might have” 
mentioned wind farms near his Scottish golf course to UK politician Nigel 
Farage.

 * The president-elect suggested he was reconsidering his vow to make the 
libel laws stricter. 
 * He suggested his son-in-law Jared Kushner could help make peace between 
Israel and the Palestinians. 
 * Trump said he was considering making former Republican rival Ben Carson 
secretary of housing and urban development. 
 * He has now left Trump Tower and headed to Florida for the Thanksgiving 
holiday.

Priebus on Trump on the Clintons: 'he's moving on'

In an interview set to air Tuesday night on Fox News, incoming White House 
chief of staff Reince Priebus downplays any Trump desire to prosecute Hillary 
Clinton – for what, exactly, again? This entire conversation makes a 
tendentious assumption of criminal wrongdoing on Clinton’s part – saying that 
Trump is looking out the windshield not into the rear-view mirror.

Preibus:

First of all, we don’t know where all the evidence is going to lead but what 
President-elect Trump was saying was that he would rather look forward instead 
of backwards and that his eyes right now are looking through the windshield, 
not the rearview mirror. So, that was the point he was making – and that, look… 
he’s not going to spend his time sitting around thinking about how he’s going 
to prosecute Hillary Clinton, he’s gonna think about the future of America for 
all Americans that are out there. That’s where his focus is and that’s really 
what he’s saying. Now, I’m sure if something comes around, that if some kind of 
you know bomb that we don’t know about you know we’ll have to take a look at it 
but his point is he’s looking forward to leading this country. He’s not looking 
to you know further injure the Clinton’s but he’s got the right attitude about 
America.”

As far as he’s concerned, he’s moving on. Now, there are Congressional 
investigations going on that I assume will continue to go on, but he’s saying 
as far as he’s concerned, it’s time to move forward and heal America and lead.”

Trump tweeted he’s considering retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson as 
secretary of housing and urban development.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to 
know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people!

A week ago, Carson said 
<http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-ben-carson-won-t-be-joining-donald-1479231990-htmlstory.html>
 he would not be joining Trump’s cabinet because he, Carson, has no government 
experience. Carson’s prescription for low-income communities has been a 
tough-love treatment which he says would foster self-reliance. He blames 
poverty in part on ingrained governmental dependence. He has been criticized 
for not accounting for the potential human costs of ending governmental 
assistance.

The Wall Street Journal reports an internal battle in Trumpland over who will 
be the secretary of state nominee:

President-elect Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
is leaning toward asking former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney to be his 
secretary of state, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

The next U.S. president is also likely to name retired Marine Gen. James 
Mattis to serve as secretary of defense in his administration, and South 
Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is the leading candidate to be the next ambassador to 
the United Nations, the people said.

Delaying Mr. Trump’s decision about secretary of state is an internal tug of 
war between supporters of Mr. Romney, and those urging the selection of former 
New York MayorRudy Giuliani. A third group is pressing the president-elect to 
keep searching for candidates.

North Carolina's Republican governor requests recount

“North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory announced on Tuesday he has officially 
requested a recount of votes from the 8 November election with official results 
showing him trailing his Democratic challenger, attorney general Roy Cooper, by 
one-tenth of a point,” Reuters reports:

The gubernatorial race in the ninth largest U.S. state remained undecided two 
weeks after Election Day. Officials with the State Board of Elections were 
continually updating results as they arrived from the state’s 100 counties.

A spokesman for the election board did not immediately respond to a Reuters 
query about when or whether McCrory’s request might be granted.

The election had been widely seen as a referendum on McCrory’s support for a 
state law denying transgender people the right to use the public bathroom 
matching their gender identities, instead forcing them to use those 
corresponding to the gender assigned at birth.

The law led to widespread boycotting of North Carolina by entertainers such as 
Bruce Springsteen and Itzhak Perlman while sports organizations such as the 
National Basketball Association and the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association moved major events out of state.

McCrory’s request came in a letter to the election board dated Friday and made 
public on Tuesday, citing a law entitling him to a recount as long as Cooper’s 
lead is less than 10,000 votes.

As of Tuesday afternoon, Cooper’s lead was 6,311 out of 4.7 million votes cast.

Keane/Reuters 
McCrory’s campaign has questioned the validity of the posted results, saying 
Cooper’s total may be inflated by votes from dead people or felons ineligible 
to cast a ballot.

“With serious concerns of potential voter fraud emerging across the state, it 
is becoming more apparent that a thorough recount is one way the people of 
North Carolina can have confidence in the results, process and system,” McCrory 
said.

Cooper, however, has already claimed victory.

“This is nothing but a last-ditch effort from Governor McCrory to delay and 
deny the results of this election,” Cooper campaign manager Trey Nix said in a 
statement. “Roy Cooper leads by 8,569 votes – a number that is growing daily as 
counties finalize election results. We are confident that a recount will do 
nothing to change the fact that Roy Cooper has won this election.”

The Cooper campaign came to its larger vote margin by citing election 
observers in each county who have tallied numbers not yet uploaded onto the 
election board site.

Obama commutes sentences for 79 inmates

Jamiles Lartey

Barack Obama commuted the sentences of another 79 federal inmates Tuesday, 
bringing the total for his presidency to over 1,000, with the vast majority 
issued just this year.

The commutations, which come less than two months before Obama vacates the 
Oval Office, are part of the Department of Justice’s Clemency 2014 initiative 
aimed at reducing the sentences of nonviolent federal prisoners.

With 1,023 commutations over his two terms, Obama has issued clemency to more 
inmates than the last 11 president’s combined, 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/nov/14/barack-obama-criminal-justice-reform-prison-sentencing-police>
 including to nearly 350 individuals serving life sentences. He has issued an 
additional 70 pardons.

According to the White House, the president is “committed to continuing to 
exercise the clemency power with additional grants of commutations and pardons 
throughout the remainder of his presidency.”

Federal prisoners make up about 10% of those incarcerated nationwide, and are 
the only individuals the president has the authority to grant clemency to.

This is the first time the president has announced a round of commutations 
since the election of Donald Trump. Both president-elect Trump and his
prospective attorney general, Jeff Sessions, have been critical of Obama’s use 
of executive power to grant clemency, 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/nov/18/jeff-sessions-trump-attorney-general-criminal-justice-reform>
 even for long serving non-violent inmates.

In response to a clemency announcement in August, Sessions called Obama 
“reckless” and accused him of “playing a dangerous game to advance his 
political ideology.”

The impending presidential transition may be adding a level of urgency to the 
team of government lawyers tasked with vetting the tens of thousands of 
clemency applications that have been submitted since clemency 2014 was 
announced.

“There is a rising sense of uncertainty about the future of clemency under a 
Trump administration <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration>
,” said Jessica Jackson-Sloan, the National Director of #cut50, which advocates 
clemency as part of an overall mission to cut the US prison population in half. 
“With less than 60 days left before President Obama leaves office, we hope he 
does everything in his power to overturn injustice and leave no deserving 
person behind.”

That’s it from the live blog for today. Here’s what happened:

 * Donald Trump gave a wide-ranging interview to the New York Times, after a 
bit of back and forth this morning about whether or not he was going to turn up 
for the interview. 
 * He confirmed he did not favor prosecuting Hillary Clinton, although he did 
not explain what such a hypothetical prosecution might be for. 
 * He said he had an “open mind” about whether or not to withdraw from the 
Paris climate change accords. 
 * The president-elect disavowed the “alt-right”, the collection of far-right 
groups and individuals that have been emboldened by his victory.But he denied 
his key aide Steve Bannon was part of that movement. 
 * Trump played down the prospect of conflicts of interest between his 
businesses and his presidency, saying: “The law’s totally on my side, the 
president can’t have a conflict of interest.” But he admitted he “might have” 
mentioned wind farms near his Scottish golf course to UK politician Nigel 
Farage.

 * The president-elect suggested he was reconsidering his vow to make the 
libel laws stricter. 
 * He suggested his son-in-law Jared Kushner could help make peace between 
Israel and the Palestinians. 
 * Trump said he was considering making former Republican rival Ben Carson 
secretary of housing and urban development. 
 * He has now left Trump Tower and headed to Florida for the Thanksgiving 
holiday.

In an interview set to air Tuesday night on Fox News, incoming White House 
chief of staff Reince Priebus downplays any Trump desire to prosecute Hillary 
Clinton – for what, exactly, again? This entire conversation makes a 
tendentious assumption of criminal wrongdoing on Clinton’s part – saying that 
Trump is looking out the windshield not into the rear-view mirror.

Preibus:

First of all, we don’t know where all the evidence is going to lead but what 
President-elect Trump was saying was that he would rather look forward instead 
of backwards and that his eyes right now are looking through the windshield, 
not the rearview mirror. So, that was the point he was making – and that, look… 
he’s not going to spend his time sitting around thinking about how he’s going 
to prosecute Hillary Clinton, he’s gonna think about the future of America for 
all Americans that are out there. That’s where his focus is and that’s really 
what he’s saying. Now, I’m sure if something comes around, that if some kind of 
you know bomb that we don’t know about you know we’ll have to take a look at it 
but his point is he’s looking forward to leading this country. He’s not looking 
to you know further injure the Clinton’s but he’s got the right attitude about 
America.”

As far as he’s concerned, he’s moving on. Now, there are Congressional 
investigations going on that I assume will continue to go on, but he’s saying 
as far as he’s concerned, it’s time to move forward and heal America and lead.”
 
Trump tweeted he’s considering retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson as 
secretary of housing and urban development.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to 
know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people!

A week ago, Carson said 
<http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-ben-carson-won-t-be-joining-donald-1479231990-htmlstory.html>
 he would not be joining Trump’s cabinet because he, Carson, has no government 
experience. Carson’s prescription for low-income communities has been a 
tough-love treatment which he says would foster self-reliance. He blames 
poverty in part on ingrained governmental dependence. He has been criticized 
for not accounting for the potential human costs of ending governmental 
assistance.
 
A Trump aide was observed leaving Trump tower holding a framed printing press 
plate of the New York Times’ post-Election issue “Trump Triumphant,” 
“presumably a gift,” the press pool reports.

Ivanka Trump and Reince Priebus have been observed leaving Trump tower, 
separately.

Trump himself was headed via motorcade to the airport for his trip to 
Mar-a-Lago.

The Wall Street Journal reports an internal battle in Trumpland over who will 
be the secretary of state nominee:

President-elect Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
is leaning toward asking former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney to be his 
secretary of state, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

The next U.S. president is also likely to name retired Marine Gen. James 
Mattis to serve as secretary of defense in his administration, and South 
Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is the leading candidate to be the next ambassador to 
the United Nations, the people said.

Delaying Mr. Trump’s decision about secretary of state is an internal tug of 
war between supporters of Mr. Romney, and those urging the selection of former 
New York MayorRudy Giuliani. A third group is pressing the president-elect to 
keep searching for candidates.

one-tenth of a point,” Reuters reports:

The gubernatorial race in the ninth largest U.S. state remained undecided two 
weeks after Election Day. Officials with the State Board of Elections were 
continually updating results as they arrived from the state’s 100 counties.

A spokesman for the election board did not immediately respond to a Reuters 
query about when or whether McCrory’s request might be granted.

The election had been widely seen as a referendum on McCrory’s support for a 
state law denying transgender people the right to use the public bathroom 
matching their gender identities, instead forcing them to use those 
corresponding to the gender assigned at birth.

The law led to widespread boycotting of North Carolina by entertainers such as 
Bruce Springsteen and Itzhak Perlman while sports organizations such as the 
National Basketball Association and the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association moved major events out of state.

McCrory’s request came in a letter to the election board dated Friday and made 
public on Tuesday, citing a law entitling him to a recount as long as Cooper’s 
lead is less than 10,000 votes.

As of Tuesday afternoon, Cooper’s lead was 6,311 out of 4.7 million votes cast.

McCrory’s campaign has questioned the validity of the posted results, saying 
Cooper’s total may be inflated by votes from dead people or felons ineligible 
to cast a ballot.

“With serious concerns of potential voter fraud emerging across the state, it 
is becoming more apparent that a thorough recount is one way the people of 
North Carolina can have confidence in the results, process and system,” McCrory 
said.

Cooper, however, has already claimed victory.

“This is nothing but a last-ditch effort from Governor McCrory to delay and 
deny the results of this election,” Cooper campaign manager Trey Nix said in a 
statement. “Roy Cooper leads by 8,569 votes – a number that is growing daily as 
counties finalize election results. We are confident that a recount will do 
nothing to change the fact that Roy Cooper has won this election.”

The Cooper campaign came to its larger vote margin by citing election 
observers in each county who have tallied numbers not yet uploaded onto the 
election board site.

Barack Obama commuted the sentences of another 79 federal inmates Tuesday, 
bringing the total for his presidency to over 1,000, with the vast majority 
issued just this year.

The commutations, which come less than two months before Obama vacates the 
Oval Office, are part of the Department of Justice’s Clemency 2014 initiative 
aimed at reducing the sentences of nonviolent federal prisoners.

With 1,023 commutations over his two terms, Obama has issued clemency to more 
inmates than the last 11 president’s combined, 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/nov/14/barack-obama-criminal-justice-reform-prison-sentencing-police>
 including to nearly 350 individuals serving life sentences. He has issued an 
additional 70 pardons.

According to the White House, the president is “committed to continuing to 
exercise the clemency power with additional grants of commutations and pardons 
throughout the remainder of his presidency.”

Federal prisoners make up about 10% of those incarcerated nationwide, and are 
the only individuals the president has the authority to grant clemency to.

This is the first time the president has announced a round of commutations 
since the election of Donald Trump. Both president-elect Trump and his
prospective attorney general, Jeff Sessions, have been critical of Obama’s use 
of executive power to grant clemency, 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/nov/18/jeff-sessions-trump-attorney-general-criminal-justice-reform>
 even for long serving non-violent inmates.

In response to a clemency announcement in August, Sessions called Obama 
“reckless” and accused him of “playing a dangerous game to advance his 
political ideology.”

The impending presidential transition may be adding a level of urgency to the 
team of government lawyers tasked with vetting the tens of thousands of 
clemency applications that have been submitted since clemency 2014 was 
announced.

“There is a rising sense of uncertainty about the future of clemency under a 
Trump administration <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration>
,” said Jessica Jackson-Sloan, the National Director of #cut50, which advocates 
clemency as part of an overall mission to cut the US prison population in half. 
“With less than 60 days left before President Obama leaves office, we hope he 
does everything in his power to overturn injustice and leave no deserving 
person behind.”
 
The president is about to present medals of freedom, the nation’s highest 
civilian honor, to 21 individuals “who have made especially meritorious 
contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to 
world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.”

Watch live here:

The following individuals will be awarded the presidential medal of freedom,
