An Egyptian general has been killed by militants near his home in North Sinai, 
the military has said, the second soldier of his rank to be shot dead in as 
many weeks.

Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> claimed responsibility 
for the attack, in which gunmen opened fire on Brig Gen Hesham Mahmoud Abualazm 
from a moving car in Arish city, North Sinai’s provincial capital.

 Abualazm, 47, died instantly. He was on a visit to Arish, where he owned a 
house, and did not serve in Sinai, security sources said.

 Isis claimed responsibility via its news agency, Amaq.

Hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed in an Islamist insurgency led 
by the jihadi groupin the rugged and thinly populated Sinai peninsula 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/08/sinai-magnet-for-terror>.

 Attacks have been stepped up since the military overthrew President Mohamed 
Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt’s oldest Islamist movement, in mid-2013 
following mass protests against his rule.

 A new group calling itself Louwaa al-Thawra, or the Revolution Brigade, 
claimed responsibility for an attack on 22 October in which another general was 
killed in the same way as Abualazm.

 Another senior military officer and a soldier were killed on Saturday in 
North Sinai in a roadside explosion.

 Egyptian authorities said earlier on Friday they had arrested leaders and 
members of Louwaa al-Thawra and another recently emerged militant group, the 
Hasam Movement, and had seized weapons and explosives.

 Authorities also said they had proof the organisations had been set up by the 
brotherhood, which says it is a non-violent movement.

 Judges, police officers and senior officials have increasingly been targeted 
by radical Islamists angered by hefty prison sentences imposed on members of 
the now outlawed group.
