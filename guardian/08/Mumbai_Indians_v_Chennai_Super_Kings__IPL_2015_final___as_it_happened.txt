Right that’s all from me. That was a decent, entertaining match to close out 
the season, even if it wasn’t much of a contest. Congratulations to Mumbai, who 
complete a magnificent turnaround after a pretty damn poor start to the season. 
This was a near-perfect T20 performance: aggressive batting, a consistently 
high run rate, an imposing total and then canny, clever bowling from all.

Cheers for reading, folks. See you in 2016!

Mumbai Indians win the 2015 Indian Premier League

20th over: CSK 161-8 (Jadeja 11, Mohit 21) Vinay Kumar will finish off this 
year’s edition of theIPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl> then. Just the 
63 needed for CSK glory! Jadeja cuts a full toss to cover point for a single, 
then Mohit bunts down the ground for a couple. Vinay drops short and wide, and 
Mohit backs away and carves a massive shot into the stands over point for six. 
Excellent shot that. He has another big mow, gets a leading edge over backward 
point this time and Suchith runs round to stop the boundary. “That’s the 150 up 
for the Super Kings!” cheers the PA. No one else celebrates much. The 
penultimate ball of the season is slogged over extra cover for six more, then 
the final ball is a bit of a farce: a slog in the air, no one bothers to try 
and take the catch and it runs away for four. That’s it!Mumbai win by 41 runs.

19th over: CSK 140-8 (Jadeja 10, Mohit 1) McClenaghan with the penultimate 
over and he picks up his third wicket with Ashwin. I guess the only question 
now is whether or not CSK can avoid being bowled out.

Wicket! Ashwin c Suchith b McClenaghan 2

Full, Ashwin has a slog, the bat wobbles in his hand, he toe ends it straight 
up and when you’re in this kind of good place, those catches don’t go down.

18th over: CSK 137-7 (Jadeja 8, Ashwin 2) Malinga is openly laughing at how 
easy this all is now. Negi has a big mow outside off but can only bottom edge 
the ball into the ground. Ashwin comes to the crease after Negi’s wicket, 
needing to help his side score 69 from 15 balls. Malinga finishes with 2-25; 
This is an annihilation.

17th over: CSK 132-6 (Jadeja 6, Negi 3) Vinay Kumar now. There’s a party 
atmosphere, almost, now and du Plessis’s wicket only adds to it. Jadeja gets 
four with a flick off his ankles to long leg first ball, but who cares? Not 
Matt Hayden and not the producer, as we’re focussing on the former Australian 
opener taking a selfie with Sachin Tendulkar.

Wicket! du Plessis c b Vinay Kumar 1

It’s full and wide from Vinay, Faf has to go for it, but doesn’t get the 
elevation to clear the captain at cover on the edge of the circle.

16th over: CSK 125-5 (du Plessis 1, Negi 2) target 203 Ahh just want the 
batting side wanted: Lasith Malinga. Dhoni pulls out a remarkable shot, sending 
a perfectly serviceable yorker straight back down the ground and into the 
second tier for a ludicrous, enormous six! Dhoni takes a single, then there’s a 
no ball as Malinga’s knee clatters into the stumps at the non-striker’s end in 
his follow through. One more, then Dhoni slugs out to mid on for two. Ah but 
then he goes, outfoxed and bowled and that, you would think, is that.

Wicket! Dhoni b Malinga 18

Mumbai Indians win the 2015 IPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl>. It’s 
a quick yorker, Dhoni, on the sweep, looks to lift it high and deep into the on 
side, but misses. The ball strikes him on the pad and ricochets into leg stump.

15th over: CSK 112-4 (Dhoni 9, Negi 0) target 203 Back comes McClenaghan and 
he gives Bravo one in the slot, which the batsman slaps off the bottom end of 
the bat, down the ground for six. He tries for another big shot when Mitch 
gives him a touch of width, but perishes in doing so. Dhoni hammers four 
through midwicket to make it 10 off the over. Not enough by far: 18.2 an over 
needed now.

14th over: CSK 102-3 (Dhoni 5, Bravo 3) target 203 The final strategic timeout

unconvincing innings comes to an end. Bravo is promoted up the order and flicks 
his first delivery round to long leg for two to bring up the team 100.

Wicket! Raina st Patel b Harbhajan 28

Tossed up, wide of off. It doesn’t turn much but Raina charges, looks to chop 
it down to third man but is done entirely in the flight. Patel whips the bails 
off.

13th over: CSK 98-2 (Dhoni 4, Raina 24) target 203 Pandya got a bit of tap in 
that last over, but it makes sense to get his out of the way now, especially 
given how high the required rate is: touching 15 now. The batsmen continue to 
struggle with their timing and get a pair of twos and a single from the first 
five, before Raina backs away and drives over extra cover for four.

12th over: CSK 89-2 (Dhoni 1, Raina 22) target 203 That last over was the 
first over above the required rate. Three singles from the first three balls, 
then Bhaji drops short a touch and gets pulled hard over mid on for four by 
Smith. But Harbhajan has his revenge next ball! Dhoni gets a single from the 
last.

Plumb, this one. Smith looks to sweep the arm ball, angled into him, and gets 
smacked on the pad dead in front of middle.

11th over: CSK 81-1 (Smith 52, Raina 20) target 203 Smith gives Pandya the 
charge first up and thumps him ferociously out to midwicket for four. He slices 
down to third man for one to bring up the 50 partnership, then Raina hooks 
another short one over fine leg for four more. This is more like it from CSK. 
There’s an LBW appeal – turned down as it pitched just outside leg – but then 
nearly a runout too as Raina takes on Harbhajan at backward point. Luckily for 
Smith, coming in from the non-striker’s end, the throw misses. Smithbrings up 
his 50 with a nice drive through point from the final ball.

9th over: CSK 57-1 (Smith 41, Raina 8) target 203 A short one from Pandya 
takes Raina by surprise and takes the top edge, but it drops short of Simmons 
running in from square leg. They get one, then Smith is beaten all ends up by a 
vicious, quick bouncer. It’s called a no ball on height, wrongly so, but the 
rebowled ball nips back and passes between bat and body and over the stumps. He 
overpitches next and Smith smears it along the ground, through extra cover for 
four. There’s a big LBW appeal a couple of balls later and it looks good to me 
on first viewing. Height I guess may have been an issue.

8th over: CSK 50-1 (Smith 36, Raina 8) target 203 Spin now from Harbhajan. 
Smith pulls out the reverse sweep to a straight one and gets it fine down to 
third man for four. A slog sweep out to deep midwicket brings just the one 
more, before Raina comes charging down the track, mistimes it out to cow corner 
and a good bit of fielding on the boundary keeps them to two. Up and over cover 
next, but again it’s not been timed and it drops into no man’s land. One more. 
Smith gets back on strike and brings up the 50 with a well-placed heave to wide 
long on for four. 12 from the over, but that’s still behind the asking rate.

7th over: CSK 38-1 (Smith 27, Raina 5) target 203 Pandya is into the attack 
and his first ball is swivel pulled off the back foot, at rib height, for four 
to backward square by Smith. That’s the first really convincing shot he’s 
played today. A pair of singles are followed by a pair of dots, then Smith 
knocks the final ball to mid on for one more.

6th over: CSK 31-1 (Smith 21, Raina 4) target 203 Smith goes hard at Vinay, 
looking to hit him over midwicket but getting a big leading edge up and over 
point for a one-bounce four. Three dots follow though and Smith looks to be in 
a bit of a tangle out there, edging one into his own body and seeing it bobble 
along the floor to slip. A single is all that comes from the rest of the over 
and it’s timeout time. 12.3 an over needed from here.

5th over: CSK 26-1 (Smith 16, Raina 4) target 203 It’s a change of ends for 
McClenaghan. As has been the pattern so far, Smith takes a single then Hussey 
swings and misses at a couple. Eventually the veteran does connect, but sends 
it scorching low into the hands of the fielder. He goes for a very painful four 
from nine. Raina is the new man and he’s forced to duck under an excellent 
bouncer. And then a thick edge, straight through the vacant second slip region 
at catchable height for four.

4th over: CSK 21-0 (Smith 15, Hussey 4) target 203 Change of bowling with 
Vinay Kumar coming on. Another awkward, hurried single brings Hussey on strike, 
still on a blob. He swings and misses at a wide one; ah, in fact it’s been 
called a wide outside off, rightly so, just about. Another play and miss 
follows though and he’s zero from five now.Another swing and miss! It’s not 
really moving about, just Hussey can’t get to grips with Vinay’s angles. 
Finally runs off the final ball of the over, carved inches over the man on the 
edge of the circle at cover and away for four.

3rd over: CSK 15-0 (Smith 14, Hussey 0) target 203 A surprise bouncer from 
Malinga doesn’t really get up, but Smith has to react quickly to prevent 
himself from wearing it in the midriff. A sharp single, dropped into the leg 
side, follows, before Hussey steals a leg bye to square leg. The last ball is a 
wide if Smith leaves it, but instead he tries to turn it round to fine leg only 
for the fielder up in the circle to make a fine, fine stop.

2nd over: CSK 12-0 (Smith 12, Hussey 0) target 203 On my other screen, some 
New Zealand bowlers are getting hammered around the park. Here, Mitch 
McClenaghan comes on and beats Smith first up. Three dots, the third thanks an 
excellent diving stop at backward point by Pollard, to start the over, then 
Smith swings hard, gets a “proper” top edge and it flies over the keeper’s head 
for the most ill-deserved six you’re ever going to see. A single back past the 
bowler brings Hussey on strike for the first time today. He looks to clear 
midwicket but is done for pace and doesn’t connect.

1st over: CSK 5-0 (Smith 5, Hussey 0) target 203 I’m backing this one to go 
the distance, but for Mumbai to defend it and win by 16 runs. Malinga has the 
ball and sends down a very low full toss, which Smith blocks out. The batsman 
looks to hit the next ball straight out the ground, but connects with naught 
but late night Kolkata air as Malinga’s very full delivery swings away a touch. 
He gets off the mark fourth ball with a skewed cover drive that speeds away 
from the fielder and races along the turf for four. A single from the last ball.

No team has ever scored 200 in an IPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl> 
final and lost. CSK bat deep, but the Mumbai bowlers will be on a high after 
that excellent innings. It perhaps wasn’t quite as high a total as they would 
have hoped for when Simmons and Rohit were going mad, but it’s still a great 
big total.

On the telly, Mark Butcher is interviewing the guy who got his throat cut in 
season eight of 24.

End of innings

20th over: Mumbai 202-5 (Rayudu 36, Harbhajan 6) It’s a brilliant first half 
of the final over, bowled by Bravo, consisting a dot, a wicket and a single to 
long off. Harbhajan is the new batsman and he clears mid off with a big hard 
slap off a full one outside off that sails away for six. He backs away to leg, 
the bowler follows him and a good yorker clatters into his boot and runs down 
to long leg for four very lucky leg byes. That brings up the 200 and the final 
ball is a dot.

Wicket! Pandya c Raina b Bravo 0

This is a great catch. It’s a low full toss, smacked off the bottom of the bat 
out to deep mid on, and Raina takes a great catch diving forward.

19th over: Mumbai 191-4 (Rayudu 35, Pandya 0) Mohit Sharma is back. Mumbai 
could get 220 here if these last two overs go badly. A single from the first 
ball to Pollard, then Rayudu scampers miles over to off, goes down on his 
knees, falls over and takes a tumble, but still manages to scoop it flat over 
fine leg for six. A dot and another single make it eight from the first four 
balls, then a wicket from the fifth makes this a decent over. Mohit completes 
it with a dot. Well bowled.

I should also point out that at Lord’s, Ben Stokes has just completed the most 
brilliant, 85-ball hundred.Tom Davies has the news

In the slot and Pollard looks to clear extra cover, but the bat twists in his 
hand, the face opens and he screws it straight to Raina in the deep.

18th over: Mumbai 183-3 (Rayudu 28, Pollard 34) Bravo again and Rayudu cuts 
for one first ball. Pollard on strike gives it some tap, but it’s all along the 
ground and straight to the man at long off. Oh and then absurd from Rayudu! 
Bravo is round the wicket, sends down a slower ball, the little man backs away 
and somehow lifts it over cover for a brilliant six. The next ball is a dot, 
but then Rayudu toe ends another slower one straight up. Immediately, his head 
drops in dejection, but the ball slips through Smith’s hands at mid off.

Right that’s all from me. That was a decent, entertaining match to close out 
the season, even if it wasn’t much of a contest. Congratulations to Mumbai, who 
complete a magnificent turnaround after a pretty damn poor start to the season. 
This was a near-perfect T20 performance: aggressive batting, a consistently 
high run rate, an imposing total and then canny, clever bowling from all.

Cheers for reading, folks. See you in 2016!
 
20th over: CSK 161-8 (Jadeja 11, Mohit 21) Vinay Kumar will finish off this 
year’s edition of theIPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl> then. Just the 
63 needed for CSK glory! Jadeja cuts a full toss to cover point for a single, 
then Mohit bunts down the ground for a couple. Vinay drops short and wide, and 
Mohit backs away and carves a massive shot into the stands over point for six. 
Excellent shot that. He has another big mow, gets a leading edge over backward 
point this time and Suchith runs round to stop the boundary. “That’s the 150 up 
for the Super Kings!” cheers the PA. No one else celebrates much. The 
penultimate ball of the season is slogged over extra cover for six more, then 
the final ball is a bit of a farce: a slog in the air, no one bothers to try 
and take the catch and it runs away for four. That’s it!Mumbai win by 41 runs.
 
19th over: CSK 140-8 (Jadeja 10, Mohit 1) McClenaghan with the penultimate 
over and he picks up his third wicket with Ashwin. I guess the only question 
now is whether or not CSK can avoid being bowled out.
 
Full, Ashwin has a slog, the bat wobbles in his hand, he toe ends it straight 
up and when you’re in this kind of good place, those catches don’t go down.
 
18th over: CSK 137-7 (Jadeja 8, Ashwin 2) Malinga is openly laughing at how 
easy this all is now. Negi has a big mow outside off but can only bottom edge 
the ball into the ground. Ashwin comes to the crease after Negi’s wicket, 
needing to help his side score 69 from 15 balls. Malinga finishes with 2-25; 
This is an annihilation.
 
Pushed through a bit quicker, Negi tries to turn the short ball into the on 
side but gets a leading edge, off the shoulder of the bat, to point.
 
17th over: CSK 132-6 (Jadeja 6, Negi 3) Vinay Kumar now. There’s a party 
atmosphere, almost, now and du Plessis’s wicket only adds to it. Jadeja gets 
four with a flick off his ankles to long leg first ball, but who cares? Not 
Matt Hayden and not the producer, as we’re focussing on the former Australian 
opener taking a selfie with Sachin Tendulkar.
 
It’s full and wide from Vinay, Faf has to go for it, but doesn’t get the 
elevation to clear the captain at cover on the edge of the circle.
 
16th over: CSK 125-5 (du Plessis 1, Negi 2) target 203 Ahh just want the 
batting side wanted: Lasith Malinga. Dhoni pulls out a remarkable shot, sending 
a perfectly serviceable yorker straight back down the ground and into the 
second tier for a ludicrous, enormous six! Dhoni takes a single, then there’s a 
no ball as Malinga’s knee clatters into the stumps at the non-striker’s end in 
his follow through. One more, then Dhoni slugs out to mid on for two. Ah but 
then he goes, outfoxed and bowled and that, you would think, is that.
 
Mumbai Indians win the 2015 IPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl>. It’s 
a quick yorker, Dhoni, on the sweep, looks to lift it high and deep into the on 
side, but misses. The ball strikes him on the pad and ricochets into leg stump.
 
15th over: CSK 112-4 (Dhoni 9, Negi 0) target 203 Back comes McClenaghan and 
he gives Bravo one in the slot, which the batsman slaps off the bottom end of 
the bat, down the ground for six. He tries for another big shot when Mitch 
gives him a touch of width, but perishes in doing so. Dhoni hammers four 
through midwicket to make it 10 off the over. Not enough by far: 18.2 an over 
needed now.
 
Bravo throws everything into this, but can only carve it up to third man, 
where Simmons takes it comfortably.
 
14th over: CSK 102-3 (Dhoni 5, Bravo 3) target 203 The final strategic timeout 
of 2015 has been and passed. Oh well. Dhoni takes a single, then Raina’s 
unconvincing innings comes to an end. Bravo is promoted up the order and flicks 
his first delivery round to long leg for two to bring up the team 100.
 
Tossed up, wide of off. It doesn’t turn much but Raina charges, looks to chop 
it down to third man but is done entirely in the flight. Patel whips the bails 
off.
 
13th over: CSK 98-2 (Dhoni 4, Raina 24) target 203 Pandya got a bit of tap in 
that last over, but it makes sense to get his out of the way now, especially 
given how high the required rate is: touching 15 now. The batsmen continue to 
struggle with their timing and get a pair of twos and a single from the first 
five, before Raina backs away and drives over extra cover for four.
 
12th over: CSK 89-2 (Dhoni 1, Raina 22) target 203 That last over was the 
first over above the required rate. Three singles from the first three balls, 
then Bhaji drops short a touch and gets pulled hard over mid on for four by 
Smith. But Harbhajan has his revenge next ball! Dhoni gets a single from the 
last.
 
Plumb, this one. Smith looks to sweep the arm ball, angled into him, and gets 
smacked on the pad dead in front of middle.
 
11th over: CSK 81-1 (Smith 52, Raina 20) target 203 Smith gives Pandya the 
charge first up and thumps him ferociously out to midwicket for four. He slices 
down to third man for one to bring up the 50 partnership, then Raina hooks 
another short one over fine leg for four more. This is more like it from CSK. 
There’s an LBW appeal – turned down as it pitched just outside leg – but then 
nearly a runout too as Raina takes on Harbhajan at backward point. Luckily for 
Smith, coming in from the non-striker’s end, the throw misses. Smithbrings up 
his 50 with a nice drive through point from the final ball.
 
10th over: CSK 67-1 (Smith 43, Raina 16) target 203 Bhaji again and Smith’s 
charmed life continues: he tries the reverse sweep again, top edges and the 
ball drops a foot or two short of the man at fine leg up in the circle. Three 
singles, a wide, and then Raina comes forward and clears mid on with a big hit 
for six.
 
9th over: CSK 57-1 (Smith 41, Raina 8) target 203 A short one from Pandya 
takes Raina by surprise and takes the top edge, but it drops short of Simmons 
running in from square leg. They get one, then Smith is beaten all ends up by a 
vicious, quick bouncer. It’s called a no ball on height, wrongly so, but the 
rebowled ball nips back and passes between bat and body and over the stumps. He 
overpitches next and Smith smears it along the ground, through extra cover for 
four. There’s a big LBW appeal a couple of balls later and it looks good to me 
on first viewing. Height I guess may have been an issue.
 
8th over: CSK 50-1 (Smith 36, Raina 8) target 203 Spin now from Harbhajan. 
Smith pulls out the reverse sweep to a straight one and gets it fine down to 
third man for four. A slog sweep out to deep midwicket brings just the one 
more, before Raina comes charging down the track, mistimes it out to cow corner 
and a good bit of fielding on the boundary keeps them to two. Up and over cover 
next, but again it’s not been timed and it drops into no man’s land. One more. 
Smith gets back on strike and brings up the 50 with a well-placed heave to wide 
long on for four. 12 from the over, but that’s still behind the asking rate.
 
7th over: CSK 38-1 (Smith 27, Raina 5) target 203 Pandya is into the attack 
and his first ball is swivel pulled off the back foot, at rib height, for four 
to backward square by Smith. That’s the first really convincing shot he’s 
played today. A pair of singles are followed by a pair of dots, then Smith 
knocks the final ball to mid on for one more.
 
6th over: CSK 31-1 (Smith 21, Raina 4) target 203 Smith goes hard at Vinay, 
looking to hit him over midwicket but getting a big leading edge up and over 
point for a one-bounce four. Three dots follow though and Smith looks to be in 
a bit of a tangle out there, edging one into his own body and seeing it bobble 
along the floor to slip. A single is all that comes from the rest of the over 
and it’s timeout time. 12.3 an over needed from here.
 
5th over: CSK 26-1 (Smith 16, Raina 4) target 203 It’s a change of ends for 
McClenaghan. As has been the pattern so far, Smith takes a single then Hussey 
swings and misses at a couple. Eventually the veteran does connect, but sends 
it scorching low into the hands of the fielder. He goes for a very painful four 
from nine. Raina is the new man and he’s forced to duck under an excellent 
bouncer. And then a thick edge, straight through the vacant second slip region 
at catchable height for four.
 
Hussey goes on the drive and replays show that it’s been taken very low and 
very nicely at cover!
 
4th over: CSK 21-0 (Smith 15, Hussey 4) target 203 Change of bowling with 
Vinay Kumar coming on. Another awkward, hurried single brings Hussey on strike, 
still on a blob. He swings and misses at a wide one; ah, in fact it’s been 
called a wide outside off, rightly so, just about. Another play and miss 
follows though and he’s zero from five now.Another swing and miss! It’s not 
really moving about, just Hussey can’t get to grips with Vinay’s angles. 
Finally runs off the final ball of the over, carved inches over the man on the 
edge of the circle at cover and away for four.
 
3rd over: CSK 15-0 (Smith 14, Hussey 0) target 203 A surprise bouncer from 
Malinga doesn’t really get up, but Smith has to react quickly to prevent 
himself from wearing it in the midriff. A sharp single, dropped into the leg 
side, follows, before Hussey steals a leg bye to square leg. The last ball is a 
wide if Smith leaves it, but instead he tries to turn it round to fine leg only 
for the fielder up in the circle to make a fine, fine stop.
 
2nd over: CSK 12-0 (Smith 12, Hussey 0) target 203 On my other screen, some 
New Zealand bowlers are getting hammered around the park. Here, Mitch 
McClenaghan comes on and beats Smith first up. Three dots, the third thanks an 
excellent diving stop at backward point by Pollard, to start the over, then 
Smith swings hard, gets a “proper” top edge and it flies over the keeper’s head 
for the most ill-deserved six you’re ever going to see. A single back past the 
bowler brings Hussey on strike for the first time today. He looks to clear 
midwicket but is done for pace and doesn’t connect.
 
1st over: CSK 5-0 (Smith 5, Hussey 0) target 203 I’m backing this one to go 
the distance, but for Mumbai to defend it and win by 16 runs. Malinga has the 
ball and sends down a very low full toss, which Smith blocks out. The batsman 
looks to hit the next ball straight out the ground, but connects with naught 
but late night Kolkata air as Malinga’s very full delivery swings away a touch. 
He gets off the mark fourth ball with a skewed cover drive that speeds away 
from the fielder and races along the turf for four. A single from the last ball.
 
No team has ever scored 200 in an IPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl> 
final and lost. CSK bat deep, but the Mumbai bowlers will be on a high after 
that excellent innings. It perhaps wasn’t quite as high a total as they would 
have hoped for when Simmons and Rohit were going mad, but it’s still a great 
big total.

On the telly, Mark Butcher is interviewing the guy who got his throat cut in 
season eight of 24.
 
20th over: Mumbai 202-5 (Rayudu 36, Harbhajan 6) It’s a brilliant first half 
of the final over, bowled by Bravo, consisting a dot, a wicket and a single to 
long off. Harbhajan is the new batsman and he clears mid off with a big hard 
slap off a full one outside off that sails away for six. He backs away to leg, 
the bowler follows him and a good yorker clatters into his boot and runs down 
to long leg for four very lucky leg byes. That brings up the 200 and the final 
ball is a dot.
 
This is a great catch. It’s a low full toss, smacked off the bottom of the bat 
out to deep mid on, and Raina takes a great catch diving forward.
 
19th over: Mumbai 191-4 (Rayudu 35, Pandya 0) Mohit Sharma is back. Mumbai 
could get 220 here if these last two overs go badly. A single from the first 
ball to Pollard, then Rayudu scampers miles over to off, goes down on his 
knees, falls over and takes a tumble, but still manages to scoop it flat over 
fine leg for six. A dot and another single make it eight from the first four 
balls, then a wicket from the fifth makes this a decent over. Mohit completes 
it with a dot. Well bowled.

I should also point out that at Lord’s, Ben Stokes has just completed the most 
brilliant, 85-ball hundred.Tom Davies has the news 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/may/24/england-new-zealand-first-test-day-four-live>
.
 
In the slot and Pollard looks to clear extra cover, but the bat twists in his 
hand, the face opens and he screws it straight to Raina in the deep.
 
18th over: Mumbai 183-3 (Rayudu 28, Pollard 34) Bravo again and Rayudu cuts 
for one first ball. Pollard on strike gives it some tap, but it’s all along the 
ground and straight to the man at long off. Oh and then absurd from Rayudu! 
Bravo is round the wicket, sends down a slower ball, the little man backs away 
and somehow lifts it over cover for a brilliant six. The next ball is a dot, 
but then Rayudu toe ends another slower one straight up. Immediately, his head 
drops in dejection, but the ball slips through Smith’s hands at mid off.
