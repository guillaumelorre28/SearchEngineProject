Alice on Nick 

What were you hoping for?
A fun, easygoing date and a nice meal.

First impressions?
A nice, intelligent, attractive guy.

What did you talk about?
Uni, Kanye West and our worst dates.

Any awkward moments?
I think we managed to avoid any, and I reassured us both of that regularly.

Good table manners?
10 out of 10.

Best thing about Nick?
Good banter. We are quite similar in some ways.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
I reckon he’d fit in quite easily.

Describe him in three words
Calm, confident, cultured.

What do you think he made of you?
I asked him this. Apparently I’m “bubbly”.

Did you go on somewhere?
We tried to scout out another bar, then called it a night.

And... did you kiss?
When we hugged goodbye, I thought he was going in for one, but apparently not. 
I then confronted the situation head on and we did have a small kiss.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I tried to impress him by eating very spicy prawns, and broke into a sweat.

Marks out of 10?
A strong 7.

Would you meet again?
We have to: Nick has agreed to make all the furniture for my new flat. 
Hopefully another date is on the cards.

A nice meal with somebody I wouldn’t usually go out with.

She’s good at filling silences.

Would you introduce her to your friends? 
I did: as we were leaving the restaurant, we bumped into a friend of mine from 
university.

Funny, talkative, enthusiastic.

What do you think she made of you?
We both knew there wasn’t much there other than a possible friendship.

Nothing much: I had a fun time.

As friends.
