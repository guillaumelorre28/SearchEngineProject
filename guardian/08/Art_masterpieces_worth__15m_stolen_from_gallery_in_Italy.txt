Masterpieces by Rubens and Tintoretto were among 15 artworks stolen to order 
by masked robbers from a museum in Verona, the city’s mayor has said.

Three men dressed in black entered the Castelvecchio museum in northern Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> at the evening change of guard on 
Thursday, tying up and gagging the site’s security officer and a cashier before 
taking the paintings.

Their haul included Portrait of a Lady by Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul 
Rubens and Male Portrait by Venetian artist Tintoretto, as well as works by 
Pisanello, Jacopo Bellini, Giovanni Francesco Caroto and Hans de Jode.

The museum told art investigators the works were worth an estimated €15m 
(£10.5m), adding that it was likely that the job had been masterminded by a 
private collector.

“Someone sent them, they were skilled, they knew exactly where they were 
going,” mayor Flavio Tosi said, adding that 11 of the stolen paintings had been 
masterpieces while others were more minor works.

Council spokesman Roberto Bolis said the museum had 24-hour security, but the 
robbery had been planned so that the thieves arrived after the building emptied 
but before the alarms had been activated. “We don’t yet know if they were 
armed, or whether they took the security officer’s weapon,” he said, adding 
that the guard and cashier were in shock and were being debriefed by 
investigators.

“They tied up the security officer as well and took his keys so they could get 
away in his car,” he said. One of the men watched over the hostages while the 
other two raided the exhibition rooms. “It was only once they were able to 
untie themselves that the alarm was raised,” Bolis added.

Footage from the 48 cameras installed in and around the premises has been 
handed over to police.
