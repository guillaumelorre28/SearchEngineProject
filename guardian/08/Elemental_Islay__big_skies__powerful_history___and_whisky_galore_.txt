My first encounter with Islay was on a sailing adventure in the early 1970s. 
As a student I took off with a couple of crazy friends to explore the west 
coast of Scotland in my dad’s boat. After we heard about a drugs bust on the 
island we thought we had to check the place out! We ended up in a pub inPort 
Ellen <http://www.islayinfo.com/portellen.html> and, after I’d secured a couple 
of bottles of Laphroaig, got back on the boat for an all-nighter.

Islay is elemental: open to the Atlantic with these big, rapidly changing 
skies, it has a powerful atmosphere. The weather is better than on islands 
further north. InSkye <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/isle-of-skye> for 
example, you can be there for weeks and never see the tops of its mountains. 
Islay is fertile, has a wild peninsula called theOa 
<http://www.islayinfo.com/islay_oa_peninsula.html>, and huge areas of peat bog, 
which is vital for whisky production.

The locals, known as Ileachs, have a dignity, fearlessness and openness. This 
is borne of the fact that Islay truly is a pilgrimage site for whisky (and 
ornithology). Through my love of sailing and whisky I’ve visited every Scottish 
island and, for me, Islay is the most welcoming. There’s a French phrase,être 
bien dans sa peau: it means being at ease with oneself, and it’s something the 
people of Islay have.

The Glasgow Malt Riots of 1725 played a major part in Islay’s whisky heritage. 
Glasgow MP Daniel Campbell supported the imposition of a tax on malt and this 
led to his house being gutted by an angry mob. He applied to parliament for 
compensation and was given a grant of about £6,000, with which he bought the 
island of Islay.

His son, also called Daniel, supported the foundation of a distillery in the 
island’s capital, Bowmore, in 1779. He was also behind the model village there, 
built to a geometric plan, which was the first “planned” village in Scotland.

Before legal distilleries opened, there were illicit stills all over the 
island. There were reputed to be 12 illegal sites just around Lagavulin bay. 
Why? Well, there were no police on the island. Lagavulin itself was illegal at 
first, though it celebrates its 200th legitimate anniversary this year. There 
are eight distilleries on the island, an extraordinary concentration. I 
recommend taking in at least two or three, to experience the different tastes 
each one produces.

Bowmore, Port Ellen and Port Charlotte are the main towns, but villages such 
as Bridgend are full of attractive 18th- and 19th-century cottages. I love how 
little new build there is here.

It used to be said that you needed to be a hairy-kneed Scotsman to tolerate 
the pungent, oily, peaty drink that is the classic Islay whisky. The style is 
big on iodine and smoky flavours. A perfect example would be the Lagavulin 16 
years old. If you want to try an Islay whisky that hasn’t been “peated”, go for
Bunnahabhain <http://bunnahabhain.com/> or Bruichladdich 
<https://www.bruichladdich.com/>. They offer a less intense experience.
What makes one whisky different from another? That’s very difficult to answer 
… but their unique character is very precious. It hasn’t always been the case, 
though. In the 1900s, the Glasgow-based agent for Laphroaig was dispensed with 
by its new owner: the agent was a peppery character called Sir Peter Mackie and 
he was furious at getting the chop, so he built his own distillery within 
Lagavulin – only half a mile from his now competitor – and tried to make the 
same product as Laphroaig. It was called Malt Mill, and while it was in 
production until 1962 it never produced anything like the Laphroaig.

The seafood in Islay is incredibly good. Many distillery workers have their 
own boats, so fishing is a second job. TheBowmore Hotel 
<http://bowmorehotel.co.uk/> (doubles from £110 B&B) is a wonderfully eccentric 
place to try fresh seafood; it also serves crocodile steaks and ostrich.The 
Bridgend Hotel <http://bridgend-hotel.com/> (doubles from £130 B&B) is another 
fine place to stay, while thePort Charlotte Hotel 
<http://www.portcharlottehotel.co.uk/>’s dining room offers magnificent sea 
views and a menu that features the island’s excellent lamb and beef. Even in 
tiny Portnahaven, there’s great grub at An Tigh Seinnse (11 Queen Street, 01496 
860224).

 Seafood platter at the Bowmore Hotel, Islay 
Get on a bicycle and enjoy the flat, easy ride from Port Ellen to Kildalton 
Cross – one of the finest surviving Celtic crosses in Scotland. It’s less than 
eight miles, but goes past Laphroaig, Lagavulin and Ardbeg distilleries; Ardbeg 
has a fantastic restaurant. The route takes you through beautiful, primal 
woodland, passing small coves and beaches.


Islay’s influence is remarkable … Finlaggan 
<http://www.islayinfo.com/islay_finlaggan_lords_of_the_isles.html>, a tiny 
island in a loch of the same name, was the seat of the Lords of the Isles. It 
was where they had their council and negotiated contracts with the kings of 
England and Scotland. One of their other power bases was at Dunyvaig Castle, 
which is just opposite Lagavulin distillery.
