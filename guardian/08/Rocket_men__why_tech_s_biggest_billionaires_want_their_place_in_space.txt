The explosion <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyAcCrNm2tk> could be felt 30 
miles away. At 9.07am on 1 September, a SpaceX rocket containing 75,000 gallons 
of liquid oxygen and rocket-grade keroseneignited into a fireball that could be 
seen from orbit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/spacex-explosion-launch-site-florida>
, billowing black smoke into the gray sky around its Cape Canaveral launch pad.

On board was a $200m, 12,000lb communications satellite – part of Facebook CEO 
Mark Zuckerberg’s Internet.org project to deliver broadband access to 
sub-Saharan Africa.

Zuckerberg wrote, with a note of bitterness, on his Facebook page that he was 
“deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX’s launch failure destroyed our 
satellite”. SpaceX founderElon Musk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk> told CNN it was the “most 
difficult and complex failure” the 14-year-old company had ever experienced.

It was also the second dramatic explosion in nine months for SpaceX, following 
a “rapid unscheduled disassembly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/18/spacex-rocket-explodes-while-trying-to-land-on-drone-ship>
” of a booster rocket as it attempted to land after a successful mission to the 
International Space Station.

Later that day, Nasa’s official Twitter account 
<https://mobile.twitter.com/nasa/status/771456438736674816> responded: “Today’s 
@SpaceX <https://mobile.twitter.com/SpaceX> incident – while not a Nasa launch 
– reminds us that spaceflight is challenging.”

They were geeks raised on science fiction and a 60s and 70s vision of space. 
Now they have money to make this a reality
Ashlee Vance, tech author 
Yet despite those challenges, a small band of billionaire technocrats have 
spent the past few years investing hundreds of millions of dollars into space 
ventures. Forget gilded mansions and super yachts; among the tech elite, space 
exploration is the ultimate status symbol.

Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002, is arguably the most visible billionaire in 
the new space race. The apparent inspiration for Robert Downey Jr’sTony Stark 
character 
<https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/true-story-elon-musk-robert-downey-jr-tony-stark-ashlee-vance>
 in Iron Man, Musk has become a god-like figure for engineers, making his 
fortune at PayPal and then as CEO of luxury electric car firm Tesla and clean 
energy company Solar City. Yet it is his galactic ambitions, insiders say, that 
really motivate him. “His passion is settling Mars,” says one.

SpaceX has completed 32 successful launches <http://www.spacex.com/missions> 
since 2006, delivered cargo to the International Space Station and secured more 
than $10bn in contracts with Nasa and other clients. Musk has much grander 
ambitions, though, saying he plans to create a “plan B” for humanity in case 
Earth ultimately fails. He once famously joked that he hoped to die on Mars – 
just not on impact.

The alternative to extinction is to become ‘multi-planetary’

Musk has outlined an ambitious timeline for colonizing the red planet, which 
he said could beginas soon as 2022 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/27/elon-musk-spacex-mars-colony>
. Speaking to the International Astronautical Congress in Mexico in September, 
Musk described a 400-foot-tall rocket that would ferry 100 colonists at a time 
to Mars over a period of decades.

“One [path] is that we stay on Earth forever and then there will be an 
inevitable extinction event,” he told the audience of scientists and engineers. 
“The alternative is to become a spacefaring civilization, and a multi-planetary 
species.”


Ashlee Vance <http://www.ashleevance.com/>, longtime tech journalist and 
author of Elon Musk: Tesla, Space, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, thinks 
these ambitions are driven by a mix of entrepreneurial curiosity, altruism and 
a dash of egotism. “The guys who are rulers of the universe now are the nerds,” 
he says. “They were all geeks raised on science fiction and the vision of space 
we had in the 1960s and 70s. Now they have the money to make this a reality.”

And no one more so than Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his estimated fortune of 
$67bn.Blue Origin <https://www.blueorigin.com/>, which he founded in 2000 and 
kept secret until 2006, has also unveiled plans for its New Glenn launch 
vehicle, a 270ft rocket capable of carrying passengers to Mars. The company has 
made a dozen test launches, including October’s test of thein-flight escape 
system 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/05/milestone-for-blue-origin-as-test-of-emergency-escape-system-declared-success>
 for the unashamedly phallic New Shepard rocket.

Blue Origin landed a small contract with Nasa 
<http://spacenews.com/blue-origin-joins-nasas-suborbital-research-flight-program/>
 to conduct suborbital research missions in June 2015, but has yet to complete 
a commercial flight. In June 2016, Bezos told reportersBlue Origin would begin 
test flights carrying humans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/08/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-humans-in-space>
 next year. He ends many of his emails and tweets with the Blue Origin motto “
Gradatim Ferociter” – “Step by step, ferociously”.

Altruism, or egotism?

At a conference 
<http://www.recode.net/2016/6/1/11826718/jeff-bezos-amazon-full-video-code> in 
June, Bezos compared the new space industry to the early days of the internet – 
likening it to how the fiber optic cable laid for voice communications in the 
1960s and 1970s ultimately paved the way for today’s data-driven economy.

manufacturing plant and launch site at Cape Canaveral. Photograph: Reuters 
“I’m building infrastructure the hard way,” he said. “I’m using my resources 
to put in place heavy lifting infrastructure … so that future generations of 
entrepreneurs can have a solar system as dynamic and interesting and varied as 
what we see on the internet today.”

Bezos is interested in an unlimited future economy where much of our 
manufacturing takes place in space, sparing Earth from pollution. “You go to 
space to save Earth,” Bezos said. “We have sent robotic probes all over the 
solar system. Let me assure you, this is the best planet.”

Bezos and Musk have developed an intense personal rivalry, says Ashlee Vance. 
“As time has gone on and these companies have been successful, ambitions have 
grown. Musk and Bezos used to be cordial, but they’re vicious now.”

In 2013, SpaceX and Blue Origin fought over control of a Nasa launch pad 
<http://www.geekwire.com/2013/blue-origin-loses-protest-nasa-launch-pad-contract/>
 and a patent for landing rockets at sea; Musk won both tussles. When Blue 
Origin tried to block SpaceX from using the launch pad at the Kennedy Space 
Center in Florida, Muskemailed Space News 
<http://spacenews.com/37389musk-calls-out-blue-origin-ula-for-phony-blocking-tactic-on-shuttle-pad/>
 slamming the company and questioning its ability to build a rocket that would 
meet Nasa standards. “We are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the 
flame duct,” Musk wrote.

After a successful Blue Origin test launch and landing in November 2015, Bezos 
used his first ever tweet to boast about “the rarest of beasts – a used rocket 
<https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/669111829205938177>”. Musk replied 
<https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/669194136248041472>: “Not quite ‘rarest’.

Whether driven by a desire to do good or simply to burnish their legacy 
ultimately doesn’t matter, says Hannah Kerner, executive director of theSpace 
Frontier Foundation <https://spacefrontier.org/>, a non-profit that promotes 
human settlement in space. “Altruism and egotism are the same thing,” she says. 
“When people are feeling altruistic, they feel important. The same thing 
happens when they feel like they’re having an impact on society. They want to 
be seen as the ones who made a difference.”

As time has gone on, ambitions have grown. Musk and Bezos used to be cordial, 
but they’re vicious now
Ashlee Vance, tech author 
Spats aside, Musk and Bezos share something else in common: a deep and abiding 
frustration with the state of space exploration. Like many of us, they assumed 
that 40 years after man landed on the Moon, humans would be taking vacation 
cruises into space and establishing colonies on Mars.

The reality, however, was much more down to Earth. Instead of sending humans 
to explore the heavens, Nasa sent unmanned probes to fly by planets. Much of 
its budget went to the InternationalSpace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/space> Station and the space shuttle for 
ferrying supplies and astronauts. The US space program began to look less like 
Star Trek and more like a really expensive interplanetary UPS.

Make space exploration cheaper

The main barrier was cost. Emerging from Earth’s gravitational field and 
punching through the atmosphere is an expensive proposition. Nasa claims the 
average cost of a shuttle launch is around$450m 
<https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/shuttle_faq.html#10>, 
though a 2011 analysis by researchers at the University of Colorado put the 
figure closer to $1.5bn. All told, the 30-year space shuttle program costnearly 
$200bn 
<http://www.space.com/11358-nasa-space-shuttle-program-cost-30-years.html> 
before it was shuttered in July 2011.


To make space a viable destination for private companies and individuals, the 
costs have to be dramatically reduced. Enter Silicon Valley’s billionaire space 
explorers, who hope to disrupt the traditional aerospace industry with 
entrepreneurialism and modern manufacturing techniques.

Musk and Bezos are trying to save tens of millions of dollars by reusing the 
hugely expensive launch vehicles, rather than jettisoning them to burn up in 
the atmosphere. They are right to try and solve that problem, says Dr Sean 
Casey, managing director of theSilicon Valley Space Center <http://reality./>, 
an incubator for new space start-ups. “No one flies a 747 to Europe, lands the 
plane, and then just grinds it up. Those planes last 40 years. The space 
industry is the only one that grinds up its vehicles.”

SpaceX prices its Falcon 9 rocket at around $60m per launch. The larger Falcon 
Heavy, which can reach higher orbits, is priced at $90m. Neither figure 
includes savings gained by re-using them. SpaceX has successfully recovered six 
rockets it fired into orbit, but has yet to send any of them up a second time. 
SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell has said the price of a Falcon 9 launchcould 
drop another 30% 
<http://spacenews.com/spacex-says-reusable-stage-could-cut-prices-by-30-plans-first-falcon-heavy-in-november/>
 when the booster is re-used.

Privately held Blue Origin has not publicly stated what its launches will 
cost, and declined to comment.

Altruism and egotism are the same thing. They want to be seen as the ones who 
made a difference
Hannah Kerner, executive director of the Space Frontier Foundation 
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and British tycoon Richard Branson are taking 
a different approach. In June 2015, Allen’sVulcan Aerospace 
<http://aerospace.vulcan.com/> unveiled the world’s largest plane – the 
Stratolauncher. With a 385 feet (107 meters) wingspan, it can carry 1,000lb 
(454kg) satellites to high altitude and launch them into low Earth orbit. 
Vulcan has not released estimates on what its flights will cost, though a 
spokesperson for the company says it hopes to be fully operational by the end 
of the decade.

Branson’s Virgin Galactic <http://www.virgingalactic.com/> launched in 2004, 
promoting short suborbital flights to civilians in the hopes of creating a 
space tourism industry. More than 700 passengers have already paid around 
$250,000 for advance tickets forVirgin Galactic <http://www.virgingalactic.com/>
’s SpaceShip Two, reportedly including Tom Hanks, Ashton Kutcher and Leonardo 
DiCaprio, though the date of the first commercial flight has not been 
announced. Using the same carrier aircraft, it also plans to deliver small, 
200lb (91kg) satellites. The cost isaround $10m 
<http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/space/blogs/branson-makes-small-satellite-launches-affordable>
, or one-sixth the cost of a SpaceX flight, but it has not announced when 
either service will be available.

Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner – named after Yuri Gagarin, the first man in 
space – has a different approach. In April 2015 he announced $100m investment 
for research into usinglasers to fling tiny robots towards the stars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/12/stephen-hawking-and-yuri-milner-launch-100m-star-voyage>
 at one-fifth the speed of light. The Digital Sky Technologies founder hopes his
Breakthrough Starshot <https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3> 
initiative will develop spacecraft that can reach Alpha Centauri, the closest 
star to our solar system, within 20 years.

If success in the earthbound technology industry is hard to obtain, in space 
it’s literally a long shot. Though the vast majority of SpaceX flights have 
been successful, it’s the disasters that give shareholders pause and makes 
potential passengers nervous. (The company recently completed its investigation 
into the cause of the September launch pad explosion, and says the next Falcon 
9 mission will likely take place next month.)


In space exploration, hyperbole often overtakes reality. George Whitesides, 
CEO of Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Company,told the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/09/virgin-galactic-space-tourism-richard-branson-george-whitesides>
 in 2014 that the company was little more than a marketing organization before 
2010, and now it’s able to design and build its own rockets.

But it is very early days. The 700-odd passengers who coughed up serious coin 
for tickets into suborbit are still waiting, six years after Branson initially 
predicted Virgin Galactic would take flight. As of writing, Blue Origin’s 
rockets have not yet made it into orbit. The Stratolauncher won’t be fully 
operational for several years, and it may take decades before anyone designs a 
system that can propel man-made objects through space fast enough to reach a 
star over a human being’s lifespan, if it happens at all.

Simon “Pete” Worden, former director of Nasa’s Ames Research Center, is known 
as Silicon Valley’s “space guy”. He’s had many extended discussions with Musk 
about his space ambitions, as well as the rest of the space elite. Each has a 
sci-fi geek’s passion for space, he says, but their practical motivations are 
all slightly different.

“For Elon, this is really what he wanted to do with his life. His passion is 
settling Mars. Yuri is driven by questions about life in the universe: Are we 
alone? Is there life elsewhere? Bezos is interested in an unlimited future 
economy where much of our manufacturing takes place in space. And it’s pretty 
clear to me Branson has got stars in his eyes. He likes the idea of sending 
people into space. I don’t think he’s doing Virgin Galactic to make a lot of 
money.”


For ambitious entrepreneurs and would-be world changers, Earth is last year’s 
news. Space is the place they want to be.
