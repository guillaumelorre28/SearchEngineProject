Women dominate this year’s Costa book award shortlists, with Rose Tremain, 
Sarah Perry and Kate Tempest among 14 female writers of the 20 nominated across 
the awards’ five categories.

Three previous Costa winners are in the running for the best novel award: 
Maggie O’Farrell forThis Must Be the Place

, Rose Tremain forThe Gustav Sonata 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/22/the-gustav-sonata-rose-tremain-review>
 and Sebastian Barry forDays Without End 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/28/days-without-end-by-sebastian-barry-review>
. Barry, who won the overall Costa book of the year in 2008 for his novel The 
Secret Scripture, told the Guardian he was excited to be nominated again. “It 
knocks your socks off every time, even in your 60s,” he said, describing how he 
celebrated after getting the call while at a restaurant with his wife. “Winning 
the Costa changed my life. I was able to send my kids to university with that 
prize. To be at the cadet stage again, that is so exciting.”

The fourth contender and only new face on the best novel list is Sarah Perry, 
forThe Essex Serpent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/16/the-essex-serpent-sarah-perry-review-novel>
. Adored by critics and readers alike and a surprise omission from the Booker 
longlist, Perry’s novel follows an adventurous widow who investigates whether 
the folktale serpent has come to life and is haunting the Blackwater estuary. 
Perry, who is currently working on her third book, said she’d celebrate with a 
sherry. “To have a panel of judges consider it one of the four best novels of 
the year is so extraordinary,” she said. “I think it will give me greater 
courage and confidence to carry on writing. I wish I had rigid self-belief 
regardless of outside influence, but when someone enjoys my book, I go: ‘Oh, 
I’ll do another one then!’”

In the first novel category, Susan Beale, an American former competitive 
figure skater, is shortlisted for The Good Guy, along with Kit de Waal forMy 
Name Is Leon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/03/my-name-is-leon-by-kit-de-waal-review>
, and Guinevere Glasfurd forThe Words in My Hand 
<http://www.tworoadsbooks.com/fiction/the-words-in-my-hand-guinevere-glasfurd/>
, a fictionalised retelling of a real romance between a writer and the 
philosopher Descartes. Francis Spufford is also shortlisted for his debut novel
Golden Hill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/30/golden-hill-francis-spufford-review-new-york>
, which marked a well-received departure from his usual nonfiction beat.

Spufford told the Guardian he was “utterly delighted” to be shortlisted. “One 
of my books was written in a Costa [cafe], so I’m getting something back for 
all those black Americanos I bought,” he said. “It is excruciating waiting to 
find out if you’ve won something but I’d much rather be in a state of anguish 
from being on a shortlist, than be in state of tranquility and not on it.”

Libyan writer Hisham Matar is in the running for the Costa biography award for 
his memoir The Return, just a week on from learning he had been pipped to the 
Baillie Gifford nonfiction prize by his friend Philippe Sands. (They had a pact 
to jointly donate their prize money to charity). Matar is joined by music 
writer Sylvia Patterson for her memoirI’m Not With the Band 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/28/im-not-with-band-writers-life-lost-music-sylvia-patterson-review>
; Keggie Carew forDadland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/30/dadland-keggie-carew-review-remarkable-life>
, a biography of her war-hero father; and Tudor historian John Guy – a former 
winner in the same category – forElizabeth: The Forgotten Years 
<http://www.johnguy.co.uk/elizabeth-the-forgotten-years.php>.

The poetry shortlist is entirely female, with rapper and novelist Kate Tempest 
nominated for her collection Let Them Eat Chaos, alongside Alice Oswald, Denise 
Riley and Melissa Lee-Houghton, who is published by independent press Penned in 
the Margins.

Author of the bestselling children’s series Horrid Henry, Francesca Simon is 
shortlisted in the children’s section for her first novel for teens, The 
Monstrous Child. She is joined by Carnegie-shortlisted author Brian Conaghan for
The Bombs That Brought Us Together 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/ng-interactive/2016/apr/15/extract-the-bombs-that-brought-us-together-brian-conaghan>
; Patrice Lawrence for her young adult thriller Orangeboy; and Ross Welford for 
his debut,Time Travelling With a Hamster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/06/time-travelling-hamster-ross-welford-review>
.

The winners of each of the five categories will be awarded £5,000 when they 
are announced on 3 January. Those five winners will then be considered for the 
Costa book of the year, which will see the winner awarded £30,000 at a ceremony 
on 31 January.

The overall award has been won most often by novels – 11 times, since the 
category was introduced in 1985. The 2015 book of the year was the children’s 
book The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge, only the second time that category has 
taken the top prize.

The awards are open only to authors living in the UK and Ireland. This year, 
596 entries were whittled down to the five, four-book shortlists.
