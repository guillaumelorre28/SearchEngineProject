In the last eight years, I have, almost literally, eaten my way around Britain 
for the Guardian’s Travel section. I have writtenaround 80 instalments of its 
best budget eats series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/series/britains-best-budget-eats> which, 
including the venues that did not make the final cut, means I have visited over 
1,000 establishments from Edinburgh to Exeter.

The purpose of the series was to give food-focussed travellers an insight into 
where they could eat well for under £10 a head, away from acclaimed, expensive 
restaurants. The lists were not just about filling your belly cheaply, but also 
about winkling out exceptional places where a holidaying visitor could treat 
themselves, cost-effectively. Value for money and quality were key factors.

As well as taking its toll on me physically (warning: walk everywhere, taste 
don’t eat, bring Zantac), this rolling research has left me with various 
tactics and tips on how to get the biggest gastro bang for your buck. Here are 
my pointers on how to dine memorably at low, low prices and also, in no 
particular order, my choice of Britain’s 10 best budget cafes, restaurants and 
diners.

Seat yourself … and carry your own cutlery

 Park life … take your lunch alfresco and grab a bench for a sit down. 
Photograph: Alamy 
You want to eat well for a tenner? You need to be prepared to rough it a bit. 
Sitting on a park bench or hovering in a doorway with a takeaway is often the 
only way to bring that meal in on budget. Keep a few plastic forks and a small 
packet of wet wipes in your bag. It is the best £1 you will ever spend.

Eat at weird times

Food is expensive at night, so reverse your day. Go big at breakfast, treat 
lunch as your blow-out by eating, say, one main course with wine atNotting 
Hill’s Hereford Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/apr/08/west-london-budget-restaurants-food>
 (£9.50) or two courses circa-£10 atDavid Brown Delicatessen, Whitstable 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/aug/06/top-10-budget-restuarants-north-kent-coast>
. Alternatively, go late afternoon for an early tapas tea atCardiff’s Bar 44  
<https://www.bar44.co.uk/>or a 4pm, £7 pasta dish at Belfast’s Coppi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/may/13/top-10-budget-restaurants-cafes-belfast-northern-ireland>
.

Plan ahead, shop around

For instance, on Norfolk Street in Cambridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/dec/05/cambridge-top-10-budget-restaurants>
, you can chow on boa buns or wonton dumplings at Zhonghua then, a few doors 
down, buy a terrific pastel de nata from the Portuguese-owned Norfolk Street 
Bakery. That is two ace courses for around £8.

Be disciplined, drink tap water

 Tap into this … eschew bottled water (other drinks and side dishes) in a bid 
to save extra money. Photograph: Alamy 
Restaurants <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/restaurants> are not 
stupid. They offer crazy deals at lunch in the hope that you will spend double 
that on drinks and sides. Resist the upsell. Get your beer fix at the local 
bottle shop.

Don’t be intimidated

Guardian online commenters have often moaned at my inclusion of places that 
are “posh” or potentially expensive. But why should that stop you from dropping 
in on a tenner? That superb value £9.50 steak sandwich at Yorkshire’s 
Michelin-starred Pipe & Glass is going to be eaten by somebody. Why not you?

Avoid tourist hotspots …

… such as York, Chester, the Lakes – where a minority of distinguished venues 
are fighting a constant rearguard action against those happy to dole out 
overpriced rubbish to gullible visitors. For different reasons, Birmingham is 
always difficult too. Brum may have five Michelin stars, but there is a dearth 
of good affordable food in the city centre.

Head to… 

… obviously, central London, Manchester, Belfast, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool. 
Big cities with new, fast-growing food scenes and a large number of young 
urban/student customers, usually produce bargains galore.

Trust in curry leaves and mustard seeds

 Dish of discovery … onion rava dosa. Photograph: Alamy 
I rarely encounter a bad south Indian curry house. The necessity in such 
regional cooking to use fresh ingredients and cook from scratch, gives these 
venues a significant edge. Discovering the mighty dosa, coconut chutneys, 
sensitively-spiced sambhars and proper, wholesome daals has, for me personally, 
been the big revelation of the budget eats era.

The friendliest places to eat in the UK are …

Lincoln, Liverpool and Belfast. In Belfast they want to chat that much you 
will struggle to get away. And that matters. Whether spending £3 in a sandwich 
shop or £200 in a restaurant, a warm smile and a keenness to please can 
transform a functional transaction into a pleasure.

The holy guacamole trinity 

I am ambivalent about gourmet fast food but, undeniably, the rise of Tex-Mex 
burrito canteens, finicky burger flippers and authentic Neapolitan wood-fired 
pizza joints, has radically improved the dining landscape for the cash-strapped 
traveller. Pretty much every major city now has one, two or three such outfits 
– all readily Googleable. Use them.

Around £8 for fish and chips seems extortionate, until you taste the Fish

mussels, scallops etc). Awesome.
