As summer days go, they don’t come more British than this. Captured from the 
top ofthe Shard skyscraper <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/the-shard>
, this timelapse video shows dark clouds looming over the capital during this 
year’s summer solstice on 20 June.

But though the first day of summer began with most of the country being 
utterly drenched, things cheered up by the evening. In the video – taken 800ft 
aboveLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/weather/london> and shot over 18 
hours, capturing sunrise at 4.43am and sunset at 9.22pm – the lashings of rain 
finally give way to blue skies.

As the sun sets on the longest day of the year, the city basks in a warm glow. 
There is hope, after all.
