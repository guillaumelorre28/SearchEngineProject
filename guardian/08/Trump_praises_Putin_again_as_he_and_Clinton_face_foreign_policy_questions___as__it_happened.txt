Spencer Ackerman

At NBC News’ commander-in-chief forum, Trump ordered off his familiar campaign 
menu of word salads. Helied about opposing the Iraq war 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP>
, criticized Obama’s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his advocacy of stealing 
Iraq’s oil – a measure he evidently believes would require a minimal force 
presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem 
with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power.

Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the 
current generation of generals and flag officers. While previously Trump had 
said heknew better than the generals 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/>
 about fighting Islamic State, this time he intimated that he’d get “different 
generals” – a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.

He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would be some parts 
of his still-unspecified plan, and some parts of his unspecified generals’ 
unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics for a war in which 5,000 
US troops are currently serving as not wishing to “broadcast” his plans to the 
enemy.

He interrupted a veteran’s question about veterans’ suicide rates after she 
gave the correct number,20 per day 
<http://www.militarytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/07/07/va-suicide-20-daily-research/86788332/>
, so he could give an incorrect one, 22. Trump fumbled through a question about 
redressing sexual assault against female service members – something he once 
tweeted was theinevitable result of mixed service 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288>, a point he 
defended on Wednesday – by arguing the military needed to set up internal 
courts, as if the military does not already have its own well-established 
justice system.


Trump’s reversion to his typical ignorance and certitude obscured a poor 
showing from his opponent.Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> spent her preceding 
half-hour grilling defending herself on her lax handling of classified 
information, a situation that a former Navy lieutenant in the audience 
correctly observed would spell doom for a low-ranking service member.

She acknowledged her vote for the Iraq war was a “mistake” and gestured in the 
direction of the same for her advocacy of the 2011 Libya war, but waved it away 
by pointing out Trump’s support for the same disastrous interventions, a 
baffling decision for a candidate whose central pitch is that Trump is uniquely 
unqualified to be president.

To reassure a progressive veteran in the audience Clinton offered that she 
would treat the use of force as a “last resort”.

“We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again,” Clinton said, as if 
there were not this minute thousands of them there.

Colin Powell's advice to Clinton on using personal email

Although it didn’t directly come up in the forum on Wednesday evening, this is 
intriguing reading: a 2009 email exchange betweenHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and former secretary of 
state Colin Powell in which she asks for – and he gives – advice on using her 
Blackberry in the state department.

The full exchange is here 
<https://medium.com/oversightdems/cummings-releases-full-powell-email-advising-clinton-on-personal-email-use-65904c1ccfa#.lo7sv941t>
, released by Deomcratic Rep. Elijah Cummings via the House oversight 
committee, but here’s a snippet of Powell’s email:

 I didn’t have a BlackBerry. What I did do was have a personal computer that 
was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient.) So I could communicate 
with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State 
Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and 
some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I 
did the same thing on the road in hotels.

Now, the real issue had to do with PDAs, as we called them a few years ago 
before BlackBerry became a noun. And the issue was DS would not allow them into 
the secure spaces, especially up your way. When I asked why not they gave me 
all kinds of nonsense about how they gave out signals and could be read by 
spies, etc. Same reason they tried to keep mobile phones out of the suite. I 
had numerous meetings with them. We even opened one up for them to try to 
explain to me why it was more dangerous than say, a remote control for one of 
the many tvs in the suite. Or something embedded in my shoe heel. They never 
satisfied me and NSA/CIA wouldn’t back off. So, we just went about our business 
and stopped asking. I had an ancient version of a PDA and used it. In general, 
the suite was so sealed that it is hard to get signals in or out wirelessly.

However, there is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry 
and it it government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, 
it may become an official record and subject to the law. Reading about the 
President’s BB rules this morning, it sounds like it won’t be as useful as it 
used to be. Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not 
using systems that captured the data.

Ben Jacobs and Sabrina Siddiqui were watching the forum for Guardian US 
tonight and send this roundup:

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton struck a pointed contrast on deploying ground 
troops to Iraq in the first televised forum of the two presidential nominees on 
Wednesday.

During the town hall, held by NBC News and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of 
America, Clinton pledged that the US was “not putting ground troops into Iraq 
ever again, and we are not putting ground troops into Syria” – while Trump 
disagreed.

The Republican nominee, who has long talked about the importance of “taking 
the oil” in the Middle East, said of Iraq: “We would leave a certain group 
behind and they would take the various sections where they have the oil.”

The United States currently has roughly 5,000 troops deployed in Iraq, mostly 
as official non-combat advisers for the Iraqi military, along with special 
operations forces who conduct and assist in raids against Islamic State. Navy 
and Air Force pilots also participate daily in air attacks on the terrorist 
group.


Trump also furthered his so-called “bromance” with Russian dictator Vladimir 
Putin, whom he repeatedly praised and cast as a better leader than Barack 
Obama. In particular, Trump cited Putin’s 82% approval rating as a sign of the 
Russian leader’s acumen. Russiablacklisted the Levada Center, 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/europe/russia-vladimir-v-putin-levada-center-polling-duma-united-russia.html>
 the country’s leading independent pollster, two days ago as “a foreign agent”.

Trump nonetheless went on to characterize his relationship with Putin as 
mutually beneficial. “If he says great things about me, I’m gonna say great 
things about him,” Trump said. “I think when he calls me brilliant, I’ll take 
the compliment. OK?”

Clinton, by contrast, sought to re-emphasize her foreign policy expertise 
while defending her legacy while serving as Obama’s secretary of state.


“I took responsibility for my decision,” Clinton said of her vote for the Iraq 
War. “My opponent has refused to take responsibility for his support.”

Indeed, Trump falsely stated that he had been against the war all along – a 
claim that went unchallenged by NBC moderatorMatt Lauer. Clinton also pointed 
out there was “no difference” between her position on Libya and that of Trump.

“He’s on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya,” she said.

Claire Phipps here picking up the post-forum baton from Scott Bixby.

There is some bafflement about Trump’s response to a questioner who said his 
daughter had been deterred from joining the armed forces after seeing the 
statistics on sexual assault.

At first, Trump did seem aware that the US military does have its own court 
system:

It’s a massive problem. The numbers are staggering, hard to believe, even. But 
we’re going to have to run it very tight. I at the same time want to keep the 
court system within the military. I don’t think it should be outside of the 
military.

But immediately afterwards, he didn’t seem so sure:

We have to do something about that problem. And the best thing we can do is 
set up a court system within the military. Right now, the court system 
practically doesn’t exist. It takes too long.

And on this tweet from 2013, in which Trump appeared to say that sexual 
assault was an inevitable result of men and women being in the same place:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions. What 
did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?

<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288> 
Trump had this to say:

Well, it is … it is … it is a correct tweet.

Rachael Frederick, the veteran who seemed frustrated by Donald Trump’s false 
correction of her question about suicide among veterans, told Rachel Maddow 
tonight that it “seemed to me like he wanted to blame it on access and mental 
health care” instead of on post-traumatic stress in US military communities.

“We’re going to stigmatize the veterans who are suffering with mental health 
diseases?” she asked incredulously, pointing out that Trump’s answer included 
describing veterans in “tremendous, tremendous pain” who commit suicide.

“I know many vets,” Frederick said, “who live with chronic pain every day, so 
I don’t think that’s the ’cause of veteran suicide.”

At NBC News’ commander-in-chief forum, Trump ordered off his familiar campaign 
menu of word salads. Helied about opposing the Iraq war 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP>
, criticized Obama’s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his advocacy of stealing 
Iraq’s oil – a measure he evidently believes would require a minimal force 
presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem 
with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power.

Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the 
current generation of generals and flag officers. While previously Trump had

 about fighting Islamic State, this time he intimated that he’d get “different 
generals” – a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.

He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would be some parts 
of his still-unspecified plan, and some parts of his unspecified generals’ 
unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics for a war in which 5,000 
US troops are currently serving as not wishing to “broadcast” his plans to the 
enemy.

He interrupted a veteran’s question about veterans’ suicide rates after she 
gave the correct number,20 per day 
<http://www.militarytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/07/07/va-suicide-20-daily-research/86788332/>
, so he could give an incorrect one, 22. Trump fumbled through a question about 
redressing sexual assault against female service members – something he once 
tweeted was theinevitable result of mixed service 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288>, a point he 
defended on Wednesday – by arguing the military needed to set up internal 
courts, as if the military does not already have its own well-established 
justice system.


Trump’s reversion to his typical ignorance and certitude obscured a poor 
showing from his opponent.Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> spent her preceding 
half-hour grilling defending herself on her lax handling of classified 
information, a situation that a former Navy lieutenant in the audience 
correctly observed would spell doom for a low-ranking service member.

She acknowledged her vote for the Iraq war was a “mistake” and gestured in the 
direction of the same for her advocacy of the 2011 Libya war, but waved it away 
by pointing out Trump’s support for the same disastrous interventions, a 
baffling decision for a candidate whose central pitch is that Trump is uniquely 
unqualified to be president.

To reassure a progressive veteran in the audience Clinton offered that she 
would treat the use of force as a “last resort”.

“We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again,” Clinton said, as if 
there were not this minute thousands of them there.
 
Although it didn’t directly come up in the forum on Wednesday evening, this is 
intriguing reading: a 2009 email exchange betweenHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and former secretary of 
state Colin Powell in which she asks for – and he gives – advice on using her 
Blackberry in the state department.

The full exchange is here 
<https://medium.com/oversightdems/cummings-releases-full-powell-email-advising-clinton-on-personal-email-use-65904c1ccfa#.lo7sv941t>
, released by Deomcratic Rep. Elijah Cummings via the House oversight 
committee, but here’s a snippet of Powell’s email:

 I didn’t have a BlackBerry. What I did do was have a personal computer that 
was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient.) So I could communicate 
with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State 
Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and 
some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I 
did the same thing on the road in hotels.

Now, the real issue had to do with PDAs, as we called them a few years ago 
before BlackBerry became a noun. And the issue was DS would not allow them into 
the secure spaces, especially up your way. When I asked why not they gave me 
all kinds of nonsense about how they gave out signals and could be read by 
spies, etc. Same reason they tried to keep mobile phones out of the suite. I 
had numerous meetings with them. We even opened one up for them to try to 
explain to me why it was more dangerous than say, a remote control for one of 
the many tvs in the suite. Or something embedded in my shoe heel. They never 
satisfied me and NSA/CIA wouldn’t back off. So, we just went about our business 
and stopped asking. I had an ancient version of a PDA and used it. In general, 
the suite was so sealed that it is hard to get signals in or out wirelessly.

However, there is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry 
and it it government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, 
it may become an official record and subject to the law. Reading about the 
President’s BB rules this morning, it sounds like it won’t be as useful as it 
used to be. Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not 
using systems that captured the data.
 
For those now wondering when we can watch the two candidates go head to head – 
on the same stage, at the same time, presumably answering something like the 
same questions – here’s the schedule:

 * Monday 26 September, Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY. Moderated by Lester 
Holt, NBC.

 * Sunday 9 October, Washington University, St Louis. Moderated by Martha 
Raddatz, ABC, and Anderson Cooper, CNN. 
 * Wednesday 19 October, University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Moderated by Chris 
Wallace, Fox News.

There’s also a vice-presidential debate between Mike Pence and Tim Kaine:

 * Tuesday 4 October, Longwood University, Virginia. Moderated by Elaine 
Quijano, CBS News.  
Ben Jacobs and Sabrina Siddiqui were watching the forum for Guardian US 
tonight and send this roundup:

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton struck a pointed contrast on deploying ground 
troops to Iraq in the first televised forum of the two presidential nominees on 
Wednesday.

During the town hall, held by NBC News and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of 
America, Clinton pledged that the US was “not putting ground troops into Iraq 
ever again, and we are not putting ground troops into Syria” – while Trump 
disagreed.

The Republican nominee, who has long talked about the importance of “taking 
the oil” in the Middle East, said of Iraq: “We would leave a certain group 
behind and they would take the various sections where they have the oil.”

The United States currently has roughly 5,000 troops deployed in Iraq, mostly 
as official non-combat advisers for the Iraqi military, along with special 
operations forces who conduct and assist in raids against Islamic State. Navy 
and Air Force pilots also participate daily in air attacks on the terrorist 
group.


Trump also furthered his so-called “bromance” with Russian dictator Vladimir 
Putin, whom he repeatedly praised and cast as a better leader than Barack 
Obama. In particular, Trump cited Putin’s 82% approval rating as a sign of the 
Russian leader’s acumen. Russiablacklisted the Levada Center, 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/europe/russia-vladimir-v-putin-levada-center-polling-duma-united-russia.html>
 the country’s leading independent pollster, two days ago as “a foreign agent”.

Trump nonetheless went on to characterize his relationship with Putin as 
mutually beneficial. “If he says great things about me, I’m gonna say great 
things about him,” Trump said. “I think when he calls me brilliant, I’ll take 
the compliment. OK?”

Clinton, by contrast, sought to re-emphasize her foreign policy expertise 
while defending her legacy while serving as Obama’s secretary of state.


“I took responsibility for my decision,” Clinton said of her vote for the Iraq 
War. “My opponent has refused to take responsibility for his support.”

Indeed, Trump falsely stated that he had been against the war all along – a 
claim that went unchallenged by NBC moderatorMatt Lauer. Clinton also pointed 
out there was “no difference” between her position on Libya and that of Trump.

“He’s on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya,” she said.

There is some bafflement about Trump’s response to a questioner who said his 
daughter had been deterred from joining the armed forces after seeing the 
statistics on sexual assault.

At first, Trump did seem aware that the US military does have its own court 
system:

It’s a massive problem. The numbers are staggering, hard to believe, even. But 
we’re going to have to run it very tight. I at the same time want to keep the 
court system within the military. I don’t think it should be outside of the 
military.

But immediately afterwards, he didn’t seem so sure:

We have to do something about that problem. And the best thing we can do is 
set up a court system within the military. Right now, the court system 
practically doesn’t exist. It takes too long.

And on this tweet from 2013, in which Trump appeared to say that sexual 
assault was an inevitable result of men and women being in the same place:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions. What 
did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?

<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288> 
Trump had this to say:

Well, it is … it is … it is a correct tweet.

Has someone ever said to you, ‘smile!’ Isn’t it irritating? Makes you want to 
do the opposite.
 
Rachael Frederick, the veteran who seemed frustrated by Donald Trump’s false 
correction of her question about suicide among veterans, told Rachel Maddow 
tonight that it “seemed to me like he wanted to blame it on access and mental 
health care” instead of on post-traumatic stress in US military communities.

“We’re going to stigmatize the veterans who are suffering with mental health 
diseases?” she asked incredulously, pointing out that Trump’s answer included 
describing veterans in “tremendous, tremendous pain” who commit suicide.

“I know many vets,” Frederick said, “who live with chronic pain every day, so 
I don’t think that’s the ’cause of veteran suicide.”
 
Hillary Clinton has responded to Reince Priebus’ request that she smile more

like veteran suicide and the Libyan civil war:

Actually, that’s just what taking the office of President seriously looks like.
