Christmas is a time for thinking about the fundamental isolation of being 
human, if you are Martin Creed. The artist who made thelights go on and off 
<http://www.martincreed.com/site/words/work-no-227-the-lights-going-on-and-off> 
appears in a succession of Christmassy hats and jumpers in the music video for 
his song It’s You, beside a Christmas tree, with a small dog in his arms, 
accompanied by a serious-looking family and a choir featuring two young women 
dressed as angels. He sings:

It’s you in the front 
And it’s you at the back 
It’s you 
It’s you 
It’s you.


This might be momentarily mistaken for a love song, until you see the infinite 
weariness in Creed’s face. It’s not a lover’s melancholy. It is more like the 
look on Macbeth’s face when he contemplates tomorrow, and tomorrow, and 
tomorrow.

Watch the video for Martin Creed’s Christmas song It’s You 
<https://vimeo.com/186266073> 
Creed’s Christmas song – showing in the window of the Hauser and Wirth gallery 
in London’s West End – is hilarious. The contrast between the seasonal setting 
and angelic choir, and the strange, arty bleakness of Creed’s lyrics and 
deadpan delivery, is a treat. This really would make a great Christmas No 1. 
It’s deliberately weird, artistically weird, rather than just plain weird like
the Jeremy Corbyn Christmas single

 with its strangely totalitarian idolatry of the Labour leader, sounding like a 
carol from North Korea. I’d say Cuba, but the music is better there.

Having recently heard a punk choir at Islington’s Union Chapel turn the Velvet 
Underground’s Sunday Morning into a Christmas carol, I thought that was 
probably the artistic limit of Christmas songs for this year, until I laughed 
out loud at Creed’s unmerry masterpiece. It is a joke about sentimentality. 
Where tackyChristmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> songs 
pile on fake feeling and kitsch emotion, Creed explores how feelgood culture 
works. The harmonies and soft lighting, communal togetherness and apparent 
piety of It’s You all help to create a warmhearted illusion. Only gradually do 
you realise how wrong it all is: he’s depressed, the angels and family all look 
just as isolated in themselves, and the song is not affirmative, it’s grimly 
ironic.

Just as Creed’s sculptural objects are bluntly, crassly real – a ball of 
paper, a lot of balloons – he moves words about with nervous, repetitive 
anxiety. It’s you, it’s you, it’s you.

In the 19th century, Charles Dickens observed a society so selfish and mean 
that he inventedthe ghosts of Christmas past, present and future 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/dec/17/christmas-carol-charles-dickens-classic>
 to scare Scrooge into a love of humanity. Today, perhaps our bloated Christmas 
season deserves the opposite. We inhabit a fake, unreal community of online 
oversharing and warm-hearted TV commercials. When community meanschatting 
online about the latest sentimental ad for supermarket seasonal fare 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/06/john-lewis-youtube-christmas-ad-buster-burberry-sainsburys>
, perhaps what the world needs now is Creed’s anti-carol.

You are not a crowd. You are an individual, and your actual human experience 
is bounded by that. It’s you in the front and at the back. You all around.

Perhaps this is a love song after all, and perhaps it contains hope and faith. 
For it is healthy and dignified to know that you are you. Love can only happen 
between conscious individuals. So can true community. It’s you, it’s you, it’s 
you – out there in the silent night.
