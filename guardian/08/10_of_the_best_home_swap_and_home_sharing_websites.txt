Backpackers’ failsafe Couchsurfing has, in a few short years since its launch 
in 2004, transformed into a global community made up of 12 million members in 
more than 200,000 cities. The site allows you to stay in someone’s home for 
free – sometimes on a couch, sometimes in a spare room, depending on the 
property – and experience their city or country through their eyes by maybe 
learning bit of their language, meeting their friends or visiting their local 
bar.

It would not be an exaggeration to say Airbnb has transformed the way millions 
of people take their trips (since it launched, more than 60 million people have 
stayed in an Airbnb property). Founded in 2008, the community marketplace 
allows people to list, discover and book accommodation around the world – 
online or from a mobile phone.

£2.99-£12.99 a month, depending on how long you want to use the platform for. 
It comes with the added feature of connecting with other travellers who are 
headed in the same direction as you.

 A Wwoof stay in Norway. 
Wwoof stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms 
<http://www.wwoof.org/>. The charity was established in the UK in the 1970s for 
people who want to learn about organic farming and ecological ways of living. 
On the site, users can search for places where they can assist hosts in their 
daily tasks in exchange for food, accommodation and knowledge. Stays include 
crofts, smallholdings, farms, vineyards, breweries, allotments, communities, 
woodlands, back gardens and education centres. Once you’ve paid your annual 
membership fee (£20), no further money changes hands. There are now more than 
50 Wwoof groups worldwide, and members can choose hosts that work in areas 
including cheese-making, lambing, renewable energy, beekeeping, hedge-laying, 
green building and organic veggie growing.

Cuba is the original homestay country, with hosts opening their homes to 
tourists as a way of generating extra income years before the incarnation of 
sites such as Airbnb (partly due to a shortage of hotels, the Cuban government 
has allowed citizens to rent their homes privately since 1997). Staying with a 
family remains one of the best (and cheapest) ways to see Cuba and sample its 
food and customs, while getting to know its people.
