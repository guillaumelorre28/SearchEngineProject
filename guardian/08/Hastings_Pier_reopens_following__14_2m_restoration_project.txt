After being closed for eight years, Hastings Pier has reopened to the public 
following a £14.2m restoration project. The historic pier was shut down for 
safety reasons in 2008 and was then almost completely destroyed by a fire in 
2010.

Thanks to fundraising from a local action group and a contribution from the 
Heritage <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage> Lottery Fund, the 
144-year-old pier, dubbed “the people’s pier”, has been returned to its former 
glory. The Lottery gave £11.4m to support the reconstruction, while 3,000 
shareholders bought a stake in the project at £100 a share.

Now the pier will host open-air film screenings and concerts, with Madness 
billed to headline the planned gala celebration of the completion of the works 
on Saturday 21 May. The Happy Mondays will also play on the pier later this 
year, as will bands the Levellers and Turin Brakes.

The reopening of the pier is being handled in phases. From Wednesday 27 April, 
the bar, restaurant and a traditional funfair in the pier’s pavilion building 
will be open. This will be followed shortly by the opening of a new cafe and 
roof terrace. The Hastings Pier Charity believe the new pier will bring 300,000 
more visitors to the town each year, contributing more than a £1m to the local 
economy.
