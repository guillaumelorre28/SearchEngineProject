 * Two tribes became one this morning as Bernie Sanders appeared side-by-side 
withHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> at a 
joint rally that marked a poignant reconciliation between the once bitter foes 
in the Democratic primary. Amid some of his most passionate supporters in 
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Sanders officially endorsed the former secretary of 
state in her battle against Donald Trump after aseries of policy compromises 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/11/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-democratic-platform-negotiations>
 were hammered out over the weekend. 
 * “I have come here to make it as clear as possible as to why I am endorsing 
Hillary Clinton,” Sanders said to exuberant applause, “and why she must become 
our next president.” Sanders prompted one or two boos from the emotional crowd 
of his supporters when he spelled out the mathematical realities to them once 
and for all, but left no doubt where he now stood. 
 * “Secretary Clinton has won the Democratic nomination,” Sanders said. “I 
congratulate her for that,” he added warmly, putting an arm on Clinton’s 
shoulder. “I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next 
president.” Sanders endorses Clinton for president 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/12/bernie-sanders-endorses-hillary-clinton-video>
 * Sanders’ supporters, it seems, are following his lead: 85% of Sanders 
supporters said they intended to vote for Clinton in the general election, 
according to a survey released last week byPew Research Center 
<http://www.people-press.org/2016/07/07/2016-campaign-strong-interest-widespread-dissatisfaction/>
. Another 9% said they intended to vote for Donald Trump (a trend the Guardian 
noticedamong its readers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/bernie-sanders-supporters-consider-donald-trump-no-hillary-clinton>
) and 6% said they either aren’t sure who they will vote for or will choose 
another candidate in November. 
 * Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> paid 
tribute to the five officers killed in Dallas last week, as he insisted that 
racial discrimination still existed in the US and protesters against police 
violence could not be dismissed as “troublemakers or paranoid”. 
 * “I’m not naive. I have spoken at too many memorials in the course of this 
presidency,” Obama said. “I’ve seen how inadequate words can be at bringing 
about lasting change. I see the inadequacy of my own words.” 
 * US supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, already facing criticism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/12/ruth-bader-ginsburg-donald-trump-election-ethics>
 for herrelatively mild comments 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/us/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-no-fan-of-donald-trump-critiques-latest-term.html?_r=0>
 that she cannot imagine what the country or the court might be like with 
Donald Trump as president, went even further with her critiques of the 
presumptive Republican nominee on Monday. In an interview with CNN legal 
analyst and court biographer Joan Biskupic published on Tuesday, Ginsburg 
called Trump “a faker” whose candidacy she initially thought “funny”. 
 * “He has no consistency about him,” she added. “He says whatever comes into 
his head at the moment. He really has an ego.”She also criticized the media for 
failing to scrutinize Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns and for giving 
him “free publicity”. Facebook

Paul Ryan: 'The good clearly outweighs the things I don't agree with' on 
Donald Trump

“How do you explain to the 1.6 billion Muslims that we trade with, that we 
ally with, that we live next door to, how you endorse”Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, a woman considering voting 
for a Libertarian ticket asks Paul Ryan.

“We do not discriminate against religion,” Ryan says. “When I see those 
principles being violated or compromised, whoever I am doing it, I am going to 
speak out against it.”

“You know I don’t agree with him on that particular policy, but on the other 
92 policies… in the balance of things, the good clearly outweighs the things I 
don’t agree with!”

Jason Hill, a commercial banker, who is reluctantly supporting Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, asks about “perceptions 
around racism and bigotry and other issues.”

“What we strive for in our ideas and our principles are to provide for equal 
opportunities so that people can make the most of their lives,” Ryan says. 
“Those things are what animate our beliefs and our principles.”

“Those are the kinds of things that we feel strongly about, and those are 
inclusive principles - they apply to everybody.”

James West, a Staten Island Republican, who is undecided about voting for 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, asks Paul Ryan 
about post-partisanship being a “realistic goal.”

“As you know, it wasn’t my plan to become speaker of the House,” Ryan says. 
“For the firs time in six years, we got consensus on what we would replace 
Obamacare with… that, to me, was unifying.”

Another audience question, this time from Heather Tarrant, a New York 
Republican, “do you know why we say” Black Lives Matter?”

“Let’s not harden ourselves int our corner so that we stop listening to each 
other,” Ryan says. “At this moment, when fives cops were killed, let’s make 
sure that we surround law enforcement with the support that they deserve.”

“You can’t blame the bad things that a couple cops do on all cops,” Ryan 
continues. “Let’s use two ears, one mouth and listen to the concerns that are 
out there… there are a lot of people in this country who, because of the color 
of their skin, do not feel safe.”

“That’s the kind of dialogue that I hope we can elevate ourselves to.”

Tarrant says that she “appreciates the sentiment,” but that Ryan did not 
answer her question.

Father Michael Duffy, a Catholic priest and registered Republican, asks Paul 
Ryan about immigration.

“I don’t ask somebody for their documentation when they come to ask me for 
help,” Duffy says. “What can we do to make sure that we meet the basic human 
needs of the poor in this country, even if they are here illegally?”

“Number one: You have to secure the border,” Ryan says, so that “the public 
believes that the rule of law is being practiced in this country.”

“You’ve gotta fix a broken legal immigration system,” Ryan continues. “There 
are ways of getting people right with the law so that they can earn their 
place… without rewarding people for cutting in line.”

“But you cannot even get to that if we have no faith in whether we can control 
who comes and goes in this country.”

Mark Hudges, the man who was falsely accused by the Dallas police department 
of being a suspect in the assassination of five law enforcement officers at a 
Black Lives Matter protest last week, asks Ryan: “What are you going to do to 
make sure that guns don’t end up in the hands of people who don’t have some 
sort of mental disorder?”

“There is common ground to be had here,” Paul Ryan says. “We’ve got to get 
early intervention into people with mental illnesses.” Ryan cites a bill 
recently passed that revamps mental-health law.

Jake Tapper, following up, asks Ryan whether he thinks Congress “has done 
enough on that front?”

“No, on the mental-illness part,” Ryan says. “With respect to terrorists... 
you have to remember, right now, if you are a criminal, if you are a terrorist, 
you don’t get a gun. The question is, people slipping through the cracks.”

“Any bureaucrat can put you on this watchlist,” Ryan says, “therefore you have 
no due-process rights.”

“What we don’t wanna do is to pass a law that we know violates a law-abiding 
citizen’s rights.”

Paul Ryan dodges a question from Jake Tapper about whether he would have 
endorsedDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> if he 
weren’t the speaker of the house.

“I do believe that I have certain institutional responsibilities,” Ryan says. 
“I think it’s important if I had not done that, I would have contributed to 
basically cutting our party in half… and I couldn’t do that.”

The first question for House speaker Paul Ryan from the audience comes from 
Zachary Marconi, a Republican student who does not supportDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

“It concerns me when Republican leadership is supporting someone who is openly 
racist,” Marconi says. “How can you morally justify your support?”

“Look at the agenda that we are pursuing - look at the agenda we are pursuing 
in conjunction with our presumptive nominee,” Ryan says. “None of those things, 
Hillary clinton is going to advance.”

“Things have been said that I, too, disagree with,” Ryan says, calling Trump 
the candidate who is “so much more likely” to advocate for a conservative 
legislative agenda.

On the subject of Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, Paul Ryan tells Jake 
Tapper that he will continue to hound the presumptive Democratic presidential 
candidate after the FBI recommended not pursuing charges against her for her 
use of private email servers during her tenure at the State Department.

“I believe that she has gotten preferential treatment throughout much of her 
career, and she holds herself above the law,” Ryan says. “I would say that any 
other person that did something like this… they would be denied that kind of 
information.”

“No one should be above the rules, and no one should be above the law,” Ryan 
continues.

We’re going to interrupt our coverage of Donald Trump’s rally in Indiana to 
join aCNN town hall with Paul Ryan 
<http://go.cnn.com/?stream=cnn&sr=watchHPbutton>, in which Ryan will talk about 
the party’s platform, its plans for the future and about the presumptive 
presidential nominee.

Moderated by Jake Tapper, the town hall will feature questions from voters and 
from Tapper himself on an array of issues.

“I think all of us as leads have an obligation to do what we can to unify 
people in this country,” Ryan says. “Our politics have been bad in Washington 
and around the country, and we are impugning other peoples’ motives.”

“I think have to go back to making politics a contest of ideals,” Ryan 
continues.

“Every once in a while, problems will happen, and we’re gonna take care of 
those problems. And they can be bad problems, but we are going to treat our 
police with respect, okay?”

“Since President Obama became president, almost 5,000 killings in Chicago, and 
nobody talks about it. Well we’re gonna start talking about it, because we have 
to make this a great country,” Trump says. “I was talking about the border, and 
I was talking about the wall - and we will build the wall, I can tell you, I 
can tell you…”

Trump then asks the crowd to chant the name of the entity that will build “the 
wall” (“Mexico!”) and does not return to the subject of crime.

close   Hillary Clinton was endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders. Photograph: ZUMA 
Wire/REX/Shutterstock 
 * Two tribes became one this morning as Bernie Sanders appeared side-by-side 
withHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> at a 
joint rally that marked a poignant reconciliation between the once bitter foes 
in the Democratic primary. Amid some of his most passionate supporters in 
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Sanders officially endorsed the former secretary of 
state in her battle against Donald Trump after aseries of policy compromises 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/11/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-democratic-platform-negotiations>
 were hammered out over the weekend. 
 * “I have come here to make it as clear as possible as to why I am endorsing 
Hillary Clinton,” Sanders said to exuberant applause, “and why she must become 
our next president.” Sanders prompted one or two boos from the emotional crowd 
of his supporters when he spelled out the mathematical realities to them once 
and for all, but left no doubt where he now stood. 
 * “Secretary Clinton has won the Democratic nomination,” Sanders said. “I 
congratulate her for that,” he added warmly, putting an arm on Clinton’s 
shoulder. “I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next 
president.” Sanders endorses Clinton for president 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/12/bernie-sanders-endorses-hillary-clinton-video>
 * Sanders’ supporters, it seems, are following his lead: 85% of Sanders 
supporters said they intended to vote for Clinton in the general election, 
according to a survey released last week byPew Research Center 
<http://www.people-press.org/2016/07/07/2016-campaign-strong-interest-widespread-dissatisfaction/>
. Another 9% said they intended to vote for Donald Trump (a trend the Guardian 
noticedamong its readers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/bernie-sanders-supporters-consider-donald-trump-no-hillary-clinton>
) and 6% said they either aren’t sure who they will vote for or will choose 
another candidate in November. 
 * Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> paid 
tribute to the five officers killed in Dallas last week, as he insisted that 
racial discrimination still existed in the US and protesters against police 
violence could not be dismissed as “troublemakers or paranoid”. 
 * “I’m not naive. I have spoken at too many memorials in the course of this 
presidency,” Obama said. “I’ve seen how inadequate words can be at bringing 
about lasting change. I see the inadequacy of my own words.” 
 * US supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, already facing criticism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/12/ruth-bader-ginsburg-donald-trump-election-ethics>
 for herrelatively mild comments 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/us/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-no-fan-of-donald-trump-critiques-latest-term.html?_r=0>
 that she cannot imagine what the country or the court might be like with 
Donald Trump as president, went even further with her critiques of the 
presumptive Republican nominee on Monday. In an interview with CNN legal 
analyst and court biographer Joan Biskupic published on Tuesday, Ginsburg 
called Trump “a faker” whose candidacy she initially thought “funny”. 
 * “He has no consistency about him,” she added. “He says whatever comes into 
his head at the moment. He really has an ego.”She also criticized the media for 
failing to scrutinize Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns and for giving 
him “free publicity”.  
“How do you explain to the 1.6 billion Muslims that we trade with, that we 
ally with, that we live next door to, how you endorse”Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, a woman considering voting 
for a Libertarian ticket asks Paul Ryan.

“We do not discriminate against religion,” Ryan says. “When I see those 
principles being violated or compromised, whoever I am doing it, I am going to 
speak out against it.”

“You know I don’t agree with him on that particular policy, but on the other 
92 policies… in the balance of things, the good clearly outweighs the things I 
don’t agree with!”
 
Jason Hill, a commercial banker, who is reluctantly supporting Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, asks about “perceptions 
around racism and bigotry and other issues.”

“What we strive for in our ideas and our principles are to provide for equal 
opportunities so that people can make the most of their lives,” Ryan says. 
“Those things are what animate our beliefs and our principles.”

“Those are the kinds of things that we feel strongly about, and those are 
inclusive principles - they apply to everybody.”
 
James West, a Staten Island Republican, who is undecided about voting for 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, asks Paul Ryan 
about post-partisanship being a “realistic goal.”

“As you know, it wasn’t my plan to become speaker of the House,” Ryan says. 
“For the firs time in six years, we got consensus on what we would replace 
Obamacare with… that, to me, was unifying.”
 
I just don’t think we should be talking about dividing at all - I think we 
should be talking about unifying.

Another audience question, this time from Heather Tarrant, a New York 
Republican, “do you know why we say” Black Lives Matter?”

“Let’s not harden ourselves int our corner so that we stop listening to each 
other,” Ryan says. “At this moment, when fives cops were killed, let’s make 
sure that we surround law enforcement with the support that they deserve.”

“You can’t blame the bad things that a couple cops do on all cops,” Ryan 
continues. “Let’s use two ears, one mouth and listen to the concerns that are 
out there… there are a lot of people in this country who, because of the color 
of their skin, do not feel safe.”

“That’s the kind of dialogue that I hope we can elevate ourselves to.”

Tarrant says that she “appreciates the sentiment,” but that Ryan did not 
answer her question.
 
Father Michael Duffy, a Catholic priest and registered Republican, asks Paul 
Ryan about immigration.

“I don’t ask somebody for their documentation when they come to ask me for 
help,” Duffy says. “What can we do to make sure that we meet the basic human 
needs of the poor in this country, even if they are here illegally?”

“Number one: You have to secure the border,” Ryan says, so that “the public 
believes that the rule of law is being practiced in this country.”

“You’ve gotta fix a broken legal immigration system,” Ryan continues. “There 
are ways of getting people right with the law so that they can earn their 
place… without rewarding people for cutting in line.”

“But you cannot even get to that if we have no faith in whether we can control 
who comes and goes in this country.”
 
Mark Hudges, the man who was falsely accused by the Dallas police department 
of being a suspect in the assassination of five law enforcement officers at a 
Black Lives Matter protest last week, asks Ryan: “What are you going to do to 
make sure that guns don’t end up in the hands of people who don’t have some 
sort of mental disorder?”

“There is common ground to be had here,” Paul Ryan says. “We’ve got to get 
early intervention into people with mental illnesses.” Ryan cites a bill 
recently passed that revamps mental-health law.

Jake Tapper, following up, asks Ryan whether he thinks Congress “has done 
enough on that front?”

“No, on the mental-illness part,” Ryan says. “With respect to terrorists... 
you have to remember, right now, if you are a criminal, if you are a terrorist, 
you don’t get a gun. The question is, people slipping through the cracks.”

“Any bureaucrat can put you on this watchlist,” Ryan says, “therefore you have 
no due-process rights.”

“What we don’t wanna do is to pass a law that we know violates a law-abiding 
citizen’s rights.”
 
Paul Ryan dodges a question from Jake Tapper about whether he would have 
endorsedDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> if he 
weren’t the speaker of the house.

“I do believe that I have certain institutional responsibilities,” Ryan says. 
“I think it’s important if I had not done that, I would have contributed to 
basically cutting our party in half… and I couldn’t do that.”
 
“I’m disheartened with you and some of the Republican leadership because you 
haven’t fully gotten behindDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and his candidacy,” asks a 
paralegal from Staten Island.

“It’s important if you believe in core principles, you defend those principles 
no matter what,” Ryan says, of speaking out against Donald Trump. “He won the 
election. We are a bottom-up party, we are not a top-down primary,” Ryan says.
 
The first question for House speaker Paul Ryan from the audience comes from 
Zachary Marconi, a Republican student who does not supportDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

“It concerns me when Republican leadership is supporting someone who is openly 
racist,” Marconi says. “How can you morally justify your support?”

“Look at the agenda that we are pursuing - look at the agenda we are pursuing 
in conjunction with our presumptive nominee,” Ryan says. “None of those things, 
Hillary clinton is going to advance.”

“Things have been said that I, too, disagree with,” Ryan says, calling Trump 
the candidate who is “so much more likely” to advocate for a conservative 
legislative agenda.
 
On the subject of Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, Paul Ryan tells Jake 
Tapper that he will continue to hound the presumptive Democratic presidential 
candidate after the FBI recommended not pursuing charges against her for her 
use of private email servers during her tenure at the State Department.

“I believe that she has gotten preferential treatment throughout much of her 
career, and she holds herself above the law,” Ryan says. “I would say that any 
other person that did something like this… they would be denied that kind of 
information.”

“No one should be above the rules, and no one should be above the law,” Ryan 
continues.
 
We’re going to interrupt our coverage of Donald Trump’s rally in Indiana to 
join aCNN town hall with Paul Ryan 
<http://go.cnn.com/?stream=cnn&sr=watchHPbutton>, in which Ryan will talk about 
the party’s platform, its plans for the future and about the presumptive 
presidential nominee.

Moderated by Jake Tapper, the town hall will feature questions from voters and 
from Tapper himself on an array of issues.

“I think all of us as leads have an obligation to do what we can to unify 
people in this country,” Ryan says. “Our politics have been bad in Washington 
and around the country, and we are impugning other peoples’ motives.”

“I think have to go back to making politics a contest of ideals,” Ryan 
continues.
 
As Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> speaks, Mike 
Pence launches into an anti-Clinton tweetstorm:
Mike Pence (@mike_pence) 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> must 
NEVER become the President of the United States of America!

It would be "extremely careless" to elect Hillary Clinton as the next 
President of the United States.

We will not rest until we elect @realDonaldTrump

States of America!

Unclear what Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
meant here:

Walls don’t have bathrooms and bathrooms are always tough.
 
“Every once in a while, problems will happen, and we’re gonna take care of 
those problems. And they can be bad problems, but we are going to treat our 
police with respect, okay?”

“Since President Obama became president, almost 5,000 killings in Chicago, and 
nobody talks about it. Well we’re gonna start talking about it, because we have 
to make this a great country,” Trump says. “I was talking about the border, and 
I was talking about the wall - and we will build the wall, I can tell you, I 
can tell you…”

Trump then asks the crowd to chant the name of the entity that will build “the 
wall” (“Mexico!”) and does not return to the subject of crime.
