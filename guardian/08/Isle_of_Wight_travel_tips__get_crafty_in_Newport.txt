The Isle of Wight is fast becoming a centre of artistic activity with a 
thriving community of painters, ceramicists and sculptors. Their work can be 
seen at the annual Arts Open Studios – a great opportunity to explore the 
island one workshop at a time – and is showcased all year at the Quay arts 
centre in Newport. This converted 19th-century brewery warehouse complex 
overlooks the river Medina and was refurbished in 1997 by architect Tony 
Fretton. A light, generous space with three galleries, theatre, shop and 
cafe/bar, as well as artists' workshops and studios, it's a great place to get 
the measure of the island's craft makers, whose work is available to buy in the 
shop.
