Close of Day 2 - Pakistan 97-8 trail Australia by 332

Jonathan Howcroft

Midway through the middle session of day two at the Gabba Pakistan had clawed 
their way back into the contest. Starting the day at 288/3 Australia slumped to 
380/9, a collapse distracted by Peter Handscomb’s excellent maiden Test 
century. Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz did the damage with four wickets apiece 
and the contest seemed in the balance.

A 49-run last wicket partnership between Jackson Bird and Nathan Lyon changed 
the day. Pakistan wilted, the Queensland crowd got involved, and in the blink 
of an eye Australia had an imposing total and the prospect of bowling under 
cloud cover and then floodlights.

The home attack seized their opportunity with both hands, putting the ball in 
the right place often enough to force mistakes. There were no miracle balls to 
engineer wickets from nothing but Pakistan batted abysmally, nicking time and 
again deliveries they needn’t have played at.

Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc deserved their three wickets, as did Jackson 
Bird his two. The seven catches between keeper and third slip testify to 
Australia’s safe hands in the field.

Clearly Australia will win this match at a canter, the only consideration now 
is how much remedial work can Pakistan put into their batting order to prevent 
the series petering out in Melbourne.

Thanks for joining us, we’ll do it all again tomorrow afternoon. 
 Australia dominated day two of the first day-night Test in Brisbane.

42nd over: Pakistan 97-8 (Sarfraz 31, Amir 8)

Lyon continuing and Sarfraz plays a rare beautiful shot. A fierce sweep from 
outside off that fizzes behind square on the onside for four. He backs that up 
with another sweep, a paddle this time, that he just works down to fine leg for 
four more. A hard run two makes it 10 from three deliveries. Can Sarfraz keep 
his head? Nope! Charges Lyon, misses but Wade can’t gather and complete the 
stumping. The ball bounced just over the bails on middle stump but ricocheted 
off the keeper’s left hand and away to gully. Not a sitter, but poor keeping at 
international level.

41st over: Pakistan 86-8 (Sarfraz 21, Amir 7)

Bird returns as Smith continues to shuffle his four-man attack. This pair are 
starting to look comfortable at the crease now though and despite a half 
run-out chance there’s not a lot for the crowd to get involved in.

39th over: Pakistan 83-8 (Sarfraz 19, Amir 6)

Starc continuing and his first delivery is a rare edge that flies through the 
cordon uncaught. This was a thick edge between third slip and gully and away 
for four. Otherwise this pair ride out the over well continuing to 
counter-punch when possible. Much too little way too late though.

Dane’s emailed in: “Jonathan - what’s your take on the Pakistani innings?” 

It’s been a shocker Dane. The question is whether this is first Test 
Gabba-shock, as so many touring teams have suffered from in the past, or a more 
chronic issue with their batting order. The big concern is the Younus/Misbah 
axis in the middle order looks nothing like the partnership of recent seasons 
and without that pair anchoring the innings it’s an unthreatening line-up. It 
will take some serious application in Melbourne and Sydney to remedy some

38th over: Pakistan 76-8 (Sarfraz 12, Amir 6)

The crowd goes wild as Nathan Lyon comes on for a twirl. And he feeds off the 
energy with a terrific over full of flight and guile.

37th over: Pakistan 73-8 (Sarfraz 10, Amir 6)

Amir uppercuts Starc for the first boundary in over 100 balls! Only the fifth 
four of the entire innings. The bowler responds with some short stuff and then 
a ripping yorker that Amir does well to jam his bat on and keep out.

36th over: Pakistan 69-8 (Sarfraz 10, Amir 2)

Into the extra half-hour tacked on to the end of the day to accommodate slow 
over rates - and there’s 12 overs still to be bowled!

Amir takes a single from Hazlewood while the crowd distracts itself with some 
jocular interaction with Nathan Lyon. Nice Gary!

Peter Salmon has emailed in a spirit-raising message. “Hi Jonathan, I LOVE 
Pakistan. Still crazy after all these years. Don’t bet against them winning the 
series. Pete.”

I’m not one to gamble Pete, but I reckon you’d get some pretty favourable odds 
right now.

35th over: Pakistan 68-8 (Sarfraz 10, Amir 1)

This has been disciplined, but by no means unplayable bowling from Australia. 
Nothing’s really misbehaved, there’s been a hint of seam and swing but nothing 
prodigious. Pakistan have been the architects of their own downfall, failing to 
come to terms with the conditions. It does not bode well for the series.

WICKET! Yasir c Khawaja b Starc 1 (Pakistan 67-8)

Control C, control V. Line and length for Australia, nick for Pakistan, catch 
in the cordon, batsman walks off shaking his head.

Insert Starc, Yasir Shah and Usman Khawaja into the sentence above and you 
have the latest dismal dismissal.

This has been a dire innings from Pakistan. Wahab tried to work Hazlewood to 
leg but spooned a dolly of a leading edge back to the bowler.

WICKET! Wahab c & b Hazlewood 1 (Pakistan 66-7)

Hazlewood comes back into the hunt for Pakistan’s final four wickets, with 
figures of nine overs two for 14.


Make that ten overs three for 17 as Wahab lobs back a simple caught and bowled 
chance that Hazlewood makes no mistake with.

33rd over: Pakistan 63-6 (Sarfraz 8, Wahab 0)

Sarfraz continues his counterattack, flashing and missing at one Starc 
howitzer before picking up three with a decently timed cut in front of square.

Wahab doesn’t look happy against Starc, struggling to pick up the pace and 
only just getting his blade down in time on a couple of occasions. The big 
lefty’s radar isn’t spot on though and Pakistan’s number eight survives.

32nd over: Pakistan 60-6 (Sarfraz 5, Wahab 0)

Wahab begins Bird’s latest maiden by unfurling two glorious cover drives. 
Unfortunately for him, on neither occasion did his bat get anywhere near the 
ball, and his extravagance only served to highlight the pickle Pakistan have 
found themselves in.

31st over: Pakistan 60-6 (Sarfraz 5, Wahab 0)

Sarfraz is batting to type, which is a man who knows he’s here for a good time 
if not necessarily a long time. He looks to make things happen against Starc 
and gets away with it on a couple of occasions.

30th over: Pakistan 56-6 (Sarfraz 1, Wahab 0)

Bird completes his over for figures of six overs two for five.

Incidentally, Sami waited until exactly his hundredth ball for that brain fade.

Pakistan have lost 5/13 in 11 overs.
Mazher Arshad (@MazherArshad) 
Well well.. Pakistan could be batting again tonight. 56-6 and there is a 
possibility of a follow-on innings.#AusvPak

WICKET! Sami c Wade b Bird 22 (Pakistan 56-6)

Deary me, what is going on!? Bird back into the attack and he strikes in 
unlikely circumstances. Sami, patient for so long, walks across his stumps and 
attempts to work the ball from middle behind square on the leg side. All he 
succeeds in doing is feathering an inside edge to the wicket keeper. Shambles.

29th over: Pakistan 56-5 (Sami 21, Sarfraz 1)

Pakistan have made a right mess of this. They can’t score, they can’t stop 
nicking off, and they’re into their last recognised partnership. Hard to see 
this making five days.

WICKET! Shafiq c Khawaja b Starc 2 (Pakistan 54-5)

Things are going from bad to worse for Pakistan. Another edge, another sharp 
catch in the cordon and it’s five down. Starc, returning after drinks, gets the 
W against his name with a good line and length from over the wicket that the 
right hander plays at unnecessarily and offers a catching opportunity to third 
slip that Khawaja snaffles.

A middle-order rebuilding job now for Pakistan who repel Hazlewood with 
comparative comfort.

If the game swung Pakistan’s way in the early afternoon, since Bird and Lyon’s 
last wicket thrash it’s been all Australia and they are careering away with

WICKET! Misbah c Renshaw b Bird 4 (Pakistan 48-4)

Bird strikes! Hazlewood-McGrath line and length has Misbah fishing and nicking 
to Renshaw at first slip. Poor shot. The ball might have swung a touch away in 
the air but it was a nothing shot in the circumstances. Decent catch by his 
ankles from the big lad.

26th over: Pakistan 48-3 (Sami 17, Misbah 4)

I know it’s a cliche but Hazlewood is McGrath-like at times, hitting the same 
line and length time after time, drawing the error or extracting natural 
variation from the surface that makes him look like a genius. Misbah flirts 
with one that seams away, Sami just withdraws his bat in time from one seaming 
in. Top stuff.

25th over: Pakistan 47-3 (Sami 17, Misbah 3)

Bird bowls a pretty uneventful maiden to Sami but a couple gripped and seamed 
away from the left-hander, which will give the pacemen some encouragement.

As a few of you have pointed out, there is an issue with the scoreboard at the 
top of the page. Despite what you may see there have been 13 wickets so far in 
the match, not zero. People with greater technical skills than I are trying to 
remedy it with the utmost urgency.

24th over: Pakistan 46-3 (Sami 16, Misbah 3)

Sami’s technique against the short ball leaves a lot to be desired and he’s 
struck on the back of the helmet again from a Hazlewood bouncer the batsman 
takes his eye off and allows to crash into him. Second time tonight he’s been 
hit on the head.

It doesn’t phase him though and sees out the over comfortably, nudging a 
tip-and-run single from the final delivery.

23rd over: Pakistan 46-3 (Sami 16, Misbah 3)

Not too much happening out there for Bird with no lateral movement in the air 
or off the seam. He gets one to bounce unexpectedly on Misbah, so high it raps 
him on the knuckle of his top glove. In general though Bird’s line is a touch 
too wide for his body position at delivery, allowing the right-handed batsman 
to leave confidently outside his off stump.

22nd over: Pakistan 46-3 (Sami 16, Misbah 3)

Hazlewood looks dangerous every delivery to Misbah who still looks in shock 
that he’s having to bat so soon after his feet must have been up and digesting 
his Queensland buffet. He eventually opens his account with a controlled drive 
down the ground for three.

21st over: Pakistan 43-3 (Sami 16, Misbah 0)

Misbah’s a wily old fox and he took every second available before facing the 
hat-trick delivery, taking the sting out of the situation and safely getting 
back and across behind a Hazlewood standard.

Jackson Bird replaces Starc from the Vulture Street end for the first time 
this session. He’s not threatening but such is the tension in the middle 
Pakistan cannot break the shackles and block out another maiden.

20th over: Pakistan 43-3 (Sami 16, Misbah 0)

What an over from Josh Hazlewood! Misbah survives the hat-trick ball but a 
double-wicket maiden has ripped this session apart. After battling so patiently 
Pakistan are now under immense pressure.

WICKET! Younus c Wade b Hazlewood 0 (Pakistan 43-3)

First baller for the mighty Younus Khan! Hazlewood immediately on the same 
line and length and Younus leans forward and tickles a skinny edge through to 
Wade.

WICKET! Babar c Smith b Hazlewood 19 (Pakistan 43-2)

Hazlewood replaces Lyon and it takes him just four deliveries to strike. 
Immediately into that fifth stump line on a good length, Babar can’t resist 
playing forward with hard hands to one he shouldn’t and it flies to Smith at 
second slip.

19th over: Pakistan 43-1 (Sami 16, Babar 19)

Starc fuller to begin this over and Sami responds with a punchy checked drive 
straight past the bowler for a confidence boosting four. Shorter stuff follows 
that Sami is happy to evade and deflect.

18th over: Pakistan 39-1 (Sami 12, Babar 19)

Sniff of a chance for Australia as Babar advances purposefully to Lyon but 
gets a thick inside edge that loops well forward of the short square leg. A 
safer single brings Sami onto strike who’s been worryingly becalmed since 
dinner... until now! An agricultural mow across the line comes off a thick edge 
but over the infield towards cow corner and it trickles for a boundary.

“Nice Gary” count for the over (as picked up on stump mic) - 1

17th over: Pakistan 33-1 (Sami 7, Babar 18)

Despite all the conditions indicating there should be swing, everything so far 
for Starc since the interval has been gun barrel straight. It reminds me that 
there remains no scientific proof that overhead conditions influence cricket 
ball movement, butthe effects of confirmation bias 
<http://theconversation.com/why-we-think-the-weather-affects-how-a-cricket-ball-swings-when-it-doesnt-46587>
 can make us think it is so.

Consequently Starc bowls short or back of a length to Sami who dodges ducks 
and defends five deliveries after Babar nudges a single.

16th over: Pakistan 32-1 (Sami 7, Babar 17)

Short delay here while the Pakistan physio attends to Sami’s right hand that 
was struck in Starc’s over. Doesn’t appear to be anything serious, but as we 
saw from Amir yesterday, that physio has magical qualities.

Single from a sedate Lyon over.

“Nice Gary” count for the over (as picked up on stump mic) - 6 - full house!

15th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Sami 7, Babar 16)

Starc’s line and length is a bit awry against this right/left combination, 
despite his action looking fluid and rhythmical. Plenty of Zoolander staring 
going on after his deliveries, but it’s not particularly threatening. More Beep 
Beep Barina than Ferrari.

14th over: Pakistan 29-1 (Sami 5, Babar 16)

Lyon continues around the wicket to Sami who has laboured to four from 42 
deliveries, and his first shot in anger since dinner sees him top edge a sweep 
onto his helmet! More bounce for Lyon than Sami expected but he escapes and 
nurdles a single next ball.

“Nice Gary” count for the over (as picked up on stump mic) - 4.*

*Inlcudes a “Nice Gaz”.

13th over: Pakistan 28-1 (Sami 4, Babar 16)

These might not be perfect batting conditions but Babar Azam has unfurled an 
effortless drive through extra cover that deserves its own Instagram account, 
wellbeing detox juice range and celebrity followers. Babar bats like a man with 
all the time in the world, which is handy when Starc’s zinging down 150kph 
under lights.

Starc bowling a shorter length in response to that Babar drive, time for a pep 
talk from mid-on.

12th over: Pakistan 22-1 (Sami 4, Babar 10)

The haunting cry of “NOYYYYCE GARRAY!” echoes in the Queensland night, which 
can only mean one thing, Nathan Lyon is to share the newish ball with Mitchell 
Starc. The TV commentators are delighted, talking up Lyon’s ability extract 
turn and bounce from the Gabba surface. It wouldn’t have anything to do with 
the desperately slow over rate, nope.

A straightforward maiden is played out by Sami who props forward and dead bats 
six offies from around the wicket.

11th over: Pakistan 22-1 (Sami 4, Babar 10)

Right, we’re back underway, and it’s Mitchell Starc with a newish pink ball 
under lights at the Gabba. Test batting doesn’t get any tougher than this.

The big lefty is on target without threatening carnage. A couple of singles 
ease the Pakistan machine into life.

@JPHowcroft <https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft> TV stations probably don't mind 
slow over rates. 20m of free content & bonus rating points. That's why the ICC

I know it’s impolite to start with a gripe, but the final session tonight is 
scheduled to contain a minimum of 37 overs. It begs the question - what on 
earth has been going on since the start of play for only 51 overs plus an 
innings break to be achieved in two full sessions?

While the MCC’s World Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> 
Committee fiddles on the margins of issues that might effect the game, a 
honking great pustule continues to plague the longest format. Players should be 
incentivised to speed up, with disincentives increasingly stringent. It is 
90-overs minimum in a day and it shouldn’t require a mad dash with spin from 
both ends near the close for the skipper to avoid a fine.

Tea - Pakistan 20-1 in reply to Australia 429

It felt almost inevitable that there would be an early wicket here, what with 
the cloudy skies and the speed and menace of the Australian opening bowling 
pair. There was, just the one though, with the young duo of Babar and Sami 
holding firm until the break. That was just a matter of 10 overs though, and 
there will be up to 37 more to face today. Pakistan must get through to stumps 
without losing more than another one, perhaps two at most, to have any chance 
of drawing close to Australia’s first-innings total. A big ask, but not 
impossible on this pretty decent batting surface if they can get a few hours 
during the sunlight tomorrow.

That’s enough from me - Geoff Lemon waving you farewell, and Jonathan Howcroft 
will handle the pips, the other pips, and the cheerios from here on in.

10th over: Pakistan 20-1 (Sami 3, Babar 9)

Same pattern even as the spinner comes on. Babar gets the poor short ball from 
Lyon and forces a single away. Then Sami gets the better balls, a couple 
turning sharply. The second especially he almost has to fall on to smother. 
Then he gets a bit rattled, sees the next one dropping wide, and tries a mighty 
wallop across the line. Even if he had hit that, it would probably just have 
gone 20 metres up in the air and been caught. Instead, he missed, despite 
Wade’s insistence otherwise from behind the stumps. Sami gets his composure 
back for the last couple of defended balls, and there is the tea break.

9th over: Pakistan 19-1 (Sami 3, Babar 8)

Jackson Bird on for his first foray, and Babar is immediately pushing through 
cover again for a run to get away from the bowling. Sami Aslam has proved much 
more willing to stand there and soak up deliveries, and he starts doing exactly 
that here. Watchful defence is the name, leaving where he can. Finally, from 
the last ball of the over, he gets his second run, then celebrates that with 
this third, after glancing to fine leg.

8th over: Pakistan 16-1 (Sami 1, Babar 7)

At least there’s some good positive stuff from Babar. Doesn’t look totally in 
control but he’s trying to turn the strike over and keep the bowlers from 
having it all their own way. Gets off strike against Hazlewood by squeezing a 
single to leg, then the bowler pings Sami in the helmet. A glancing blow, Hot 
Spot shows, and the batsman continues without medical intervention. Took his 
eyes off the ball there and was struck. He gets off strike next ball with a leg 
bye, then Babar takes a nice sharp single into the covers. That positivity

7th over: Pakistan 13-1 (Sami 1, Babar 5)

Babar is away as well. Gets a very wide and short ball that he chases, 
injudiciously, but manages to flail a couple of runs with the flourished toe of 
the bat. Then he chases the second ball, rather dragging it in the air through 
cover, but safely again and takes a couple more. The single to fine leg, and 
Sami survives the last couple of Starc short balls. Dusk starting to settle 
here in Brisbane. Feels like a wicket could fall any moment.

6th over: Pakistan 8-1 (Sami 1, Babar 0)

“How many lbw appeals must a bowler yell down, before you can give him a 
wicket?” So wrote a Nobel-winning lyricist, or thereabouts, as Hazlewood spends 
most of his over yelling and running backwards down the pitch. If that was the 
point of the game, he would have won it already. But, sadly, Backwards Yell 
Running is only a sport in small Scottish towns on certain festival days. 
Hazlewood pins Sami on the pad but too high, then Babar low down but via an 
inside edge, then Babar with another full ball that is just sliding down leg. 
Umpire Gould makes all three calls correctly, and the Australians resist 
reviewing them all correctly. Sami is off his duck with a single into the 
covers, and there’s a leg bye from the third appeal.

5th over: Pakistan 6-1 (Sami 0, Babar 0)

Babar Azam. Like the catchphrase of an elephant wizard. Another young batsman 
out in the middle, 22 and his partner is 21. His feet are dancing, shuffling in 
the crease as he awaits Starc, making sure he’s alert. But his head is still, 
and he looks comfortable enough in trying circumstances. Evades a couple, 
leaves a couple. Survives the over.

Hazlewood stars as Australia's pace aces send Pakistan packing
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/16/pakistan-australia-gabba-cricket-night> 
Midway through the middle session of day two at the Gabba Pakistan had clawed 
their way back into the contest. Starting the day at 288/3 Australia slumped to 
380/9, a collapse distracted by Peter Handscomb’s excellent maiden Test 
century. Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz did the damage with four wickets apiece 
and the contest seemed in the balance.

A 49-run last wicket partnership between Jackson Bird and Nathan Lyon changed 
the day. Pakistan wilted, the Queensland crowd got involved, and in the blink 
of an eye Australia had an imposing total and the prospect of bowling under 
cloud cover and then floodlights.

The home attack seized their opportunity with both hands, putting the ball in 
the right place often enough to force mistakes. There were no miracle balls to 
engineer wickets from nothing but Pakistan batted abysmally, nicking time and 
again deliveries they needn’t have played at.

Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc deserved their three wickets, as did Jackson 
Bird his two. The seven catches between keeper and third slip testify to 
Australia’s safe hands in the field.

Clearly Australia will win this match at a canter, the only consideration now 
is how much remedial work can Pakistan put into their batting order to prevent 
the series petering out in Melbourne.

Thanks for joining us, we’ll do it all again tomorrow afternoon.

43rd over: Pakistan 97-8 (Sarfraz 31, Amir 8)

Amir blocks out a maiden from Bird to see off the day. 

Despite the extra half-hour and no breaks for rain, only 84 overs (plus the 
two lost to the changeover) were bowled.
 
42nd over: Pakistan 97-8 (Sarfraz 31, Amir 8)

Lyon continuing and Sarfraz plays a rare beautiful shot. A fierce sweep from 
outside off that fizzes behind square on the onside for four. He backs that up 
with another sweep, a paddle this time, that he just works down to fine leg for 
four more. A hard run two makes it 10 from three deliveries. Can Sarfraz keep 
his head? Nope! Charges Lyon, misses but Wade can’t gather and complete the 
stumping. The ball bounced just over the bails on middle stump but ricocheted 
off the keeper’s left hand and away to gully. Not a sitter, but poor keeping at 
international level.
 
41st over: Pakistan 86-8 (Sarfraz 21, Amir 7)

Bird returns as Smith continues to shuffle his four-man attack. This pair are 
starting to look comfortable at the crease now though and despite a half 
run-out chance there’s not a lot for the crowd to get involved in.
 
40th over: Pakistan 84-8 (Sarfraz 20, Amir 6)

Lyon rattling through an over of darts to limit his skipper’s over-rate fine.

39th over: Pakistan 83-8 (Sarfraz 19, Amir 6)

Starc continuing and his first delivery is a rare edge that flies through the 
cordon uncaught. This was a thick edge between third slip and gully and away 
for four. Otherwise this pair ride out the over well continuing to 
counter-punch when possible. Much too little way too late though.

Dane’s emailed in: “Jonathan - what’s your take on the Pakistani innings?” 

It’s been a shocker Dane. The question is whether this is first Test 
Gabba-shock, as so many touring teams have suffered from in the past, or a more 
chronic issue with their batting order. The big concern is the Younus/Misbah 
axis in the middle order looks nothing like the partnership of recent seasons 
and without that pair anchoring the innings it’s an unthreatening line-up. It 
will take some serious application in Melbourne and Sydney to remedy some 
obvious flaws in Australian conditions.
 
38th over: Pakistan 76-8 (Sarfraz 12, Amir 6)

The crowd goes wild as Nathan Lyon comes on for a twirl. And he feeds off the 
energy with a terrific over full of flight and guile.
 
37th over: Pakistan 73-8 (Sarfraz 10, Amir 6)

Amir uppercuts Starc for the first boundary in over 100 balls! Only the fifth 
four of the entire innings. The bowler responds with some short stuff and then 
a ripping yorker that Amir does well to jam his bat on and keep out.

36th over: Pakistan 69-8 (Sarfraz 10, Amir 2)

Into the extra half-hour tacked on to the end of the day to accommodate slow 
over rates - and there’s 12 overs still to be bowled!

Amir takes a single from Hazlewood while the crowd distracts itself with some 
jocular interaction with Nathan Lyon. Nice Gary!

Peter Salmon has emailed in a spirit-raising message. “Hi Jonathan, I LOVE 
Pakistan. Still crazy after all these years. Don’t bet against them winning the 
series. Pete.”

I’m not one to gamble Pete, but I reckon you’d get some pretty favourable odds 
right now.
 
35th over: Pakistan 68-8 (Sarfraz 10, Amir 1)

This has been disciplined, but by no means unplayable bowling from Australia. 
Nothing’s really misbehaved, there’s been a hint of seam and swing but nothing 
prodigious. Pakistan have been the architects of their own downfall, failing to 
come to terms with the conditions. It does not bode well for the series.

Control C, control V. Line and length for Australia, nick for Pakistan, catch

Insert Starc, Yasir Shah and Usman Khawaja into the sentence above and you

34th over: Pakistan 67-7 (Sarfraz 10, Yasir 1)

This has been a dire innings from Pakistan. Wahab tried to work Hazlewood to 
leg but spooned a dolly of a leading edge back to the bowler.

Hazlewood comes back into the hunt for Pakistan’s final four wickets, with 
figures of nine overs two for 14.


Make that ten overs three for 17 as Wahab lobs back a simple caught and bowled 
chance that Hazlewood makes no mistake with.

bowling of Pakistan’s Wahab Riaz. Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images  
33rd over: Pakistan 63-6 (Sarfraz 8, Wahab 0)

Sarfraz continues his counterattack, flashing and missing at one Starc 
howitzer before picking up three with a decently timed cut in front of square.

Wahab doesn’t look happy against Starc, struggling to pick up the pace and 
only just getting his blade down in time on a couple of occasions. The big 
lefty’s radar isn’t spot on though and Pakistan’s number eight survives.
 
32nd over: Pakistan 60-6 (Sarfraz 5, Wahab 0)

Wahab begins Bird’s latest maiden by unfurling two glorious cover drives. 
Unfortunately for him, on neither occasion did his bat get anywhere near the 
ball, and his extravagance only served to highlight the pickle Pakistan have 
found themselves in.
 
31st over: Pakistan 60-6 (Sarfraz 5, Wahab 0)

Sarfraz is batting to type, which is a man who knows he’s here for a good time 
if not necessarily a long time. He looks to make things happen against Starc 
and gets away with it on a couple of occasions.
 
30th over: Pakistan 56-6 (Sarfraz 1, Wahab 0)

Bird completes his over for figures of six overs two for five.

Incidentally, Sami waited until exactly his hundredth ball for that brain fade.

Pakistan have lost 5/13 in 11 overs.

Deary me, what is going on!? Bird back into the attack and he strikes in 
unlikely circumstances. Sami, patient for so long, walks across his stumps and 
attempts to work the ball from middle behind square on the leg side. All he 
succeeds in doing is feathering an inside edge to the wicket keeper. Shambles.

29th over: Pakistan 56-5 (Sami 21, Sarfraz 1)

Pakistan have made a right mess of this. They can’t score, they can’t stop 
nicking off, and they’re into their last recognised partnership. Hard to see 
this making five days.
 
Things are going from bad to worse for Pakistan. Another edge, another sharp 
catch in the cordon and it’s five down. Starc, returning after drinks, gets the 
W against his name with a good line and length from over the wicket that the

A middle-order rebuilding job now for Pakistan who repel Hazlewood with 
comparative comfort.

27th over: Pakistan 48-4 (Sami 17, Shafiq 0)

If the game swung Pakistan’s way in the early afternoon, since Bird and Lyon’s 
last wicket thrash it’s been all Australia and they are careering away with 
this Test match.
 
Bird strikes! Hazlewood-McGrath line and length has Misbah fishing and nicking 
to Renshaw at first slip. Poor shot. The ball might have swung a touch away in 
the air but it was a nothing shot in the circumstances. Decent catch by his 
ankles from the big lad.

26th over: Pakistan 48-3 (Sami 17, Misbah 4)

I know it’s a cliche but Hazlewood is McGrath-like at times, hitting the same 
line and length time after time, drawing the error or extracting natural 
variation from the surface that makes him look like a genius. Misbah flirts 
with one that seams away, Sami just withdraws his bat in time from one seaming 
in. Top stuff.
 
25th over: Pakistan 47-3 (Sami 17, Misbah 3)

Bird bowls a pretty uneventful maiden to Sami but a couple gripped and seamed 
away from the left-hander, which will give the pacemen some encouragement.
 
As a few of you have pointed out, there is an issue with the scoreboard at the 
top of the page. Despite what you may see there have been 13 wickets so far in 
the match, not zero. People with greater technical skills than I are trying to 
remedy it with the utmost urgency.
 
24th over: Pakistan 46-3 (Sami 16, Misbah 3)

Sami’s technique against the short ball leaves a lot to be desired and he’s 
struck on the back of the helmet again from a Hazlewood bouncer the batsman 
takes his eye off and allows to crash into him. Second time tonight he’s been 
hit on the head.

It doesn’t phase him though and sees out the over comfortably, nudging a 
tip-and-run single from the final delivery.

23rd over: Pakistan 46-3 (Sami 16, Misbah 3)

Not too much happening out there for Bird with no lateral movement in the air 
or off the seam. He gets one to bounce unexpectedly on Misbah, so high it raps 
him on the knuckle of his top glove. In general though Bird’s line is a touch 
too wide for his body position at delivery, allowing the right-handed batsman 
to leave confidently outside his off stump.

22nd over: Pakistan 46-3 (Sami 16, Misbah 3)

Hazlewood looks dangerous every delivery to Misbah who still looks in shock 
that he’s having to bat so soon after his feet must have been up and digesting 
his Queensland buffet. He eventually opens his account with a controlled drive 
down the ground for three.

21st over: Pakistan 43-3 (Sami 16, Misbah 0)

Misbah’s a wily old fox and he took every second available before facing the 
hat-trick delivery, taking the sting out of the situation and safely getting 
back and across behind a Hazlewood standard.

Jackson Bird replaces Starc from the Vulture Street end for the first time 
this session. He’s not threatening but such is the tension in the middle 
Pakistan cannot break the shackles and block out another maiden.
 
20th over: Pakistan 43-3 (Sami 16, Misbah 0)

What an over from Josh Hazlewood! Misbah survives the hat-trick ball but a 
double-wicket maiden has ripped this session apart. After battling so patiently 
Pakistan are now under immense pressure.
 
First baller for the mighty Younus Khan! Hazlewood immediately on the same 
line and length and Younus leans forward and tickles a skinny edge through to 
Wade.

Hazlewood replaces Lyon and it takes him just four deliveries to strike. 
Immediately into that fifth stump line on a good length, Babar can’t resist 
playing forward with hard hands to one he shouldn’t and it flies to Smith at 
second slip.

19th over: Pakistan 43-1 (Sami 16, Babar 19)

Starc fuller to begin this over and Sami responds with a punchy checked drive 
straight past the bowler for a confidence boosting four. Shorter stuff follows 
that Sami is happy to evade and deflect.
 
18th over: Pakistan 39-1 (Sami 12, Babar 19)

Sniff of a chance for Australia as Babar advances purposefully to Lyon but 
gets a thick inside edge that loops well forward of the short square leg. A 
safer single brings Sami onto strike who’s been worryingly becalmed since 
dinner... until now! An agricultural mow across the line comes off a thick edge 
but over the infield towards cow corner and it trickles for a boundary.

“Nice Gary” count for the over (as picked up on stump mic) - 1 
 
17th over: Pakistan 33-1 (Sami 7, Babar 18)

Despite all the conditions indicating there should be swing, everything so far 
for Starc since the interval has been gun barrel straight. It reminds me that 
there remains no scientific proof that overhead conditions influence cricket 
ball movement, butthe effects of confirmation bias 
<http://theconversation.com/why-we-think-the-weather-affects-how-a-cricket-ball-swings-when-it-doesnt-46587>
 can make us think it is so.

Consequently Starc bowls short or back of a length to Sami who dodges ducks 
and defends five deliveries after Babar nudges a single.
 
16th over: Pakistan 32-1 (Sami 7, Babar 17)

Short delay here while the Pakistan physio attends to Sami’s right hand that 
was struck in Starc’s over. Doesn’t appear to be anything serious, but as we 
saw from Amir yesterday, that physio has magical qualities.

Single from a sedate Lyon over.

“Nice Gary” count for the over (as picked up on stump mic) - 6 - full house!
 
15th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Sami 7, Babar 16)

Starc’s line and length is a bit awry against this right/left combination, 
despite his action looking fluid and rhythmical. Plenty of Zoolander staring 
going on after his deliveries, but it’s not particularly threatening. More Beep 
Beep Barina than Ferrari.
 
14th over: Pakistan 29-1 (Sami 5, Babar 16)

Lyon continues around the wicket to Sami who has laboured to four from 42 
deliveries, and his first shot in anger since dinner sees him top edge a sweep 
onto his helmet! More bounce for Lyon than Sami expected but he escapes and 
nurdles a single next ball.

“Nice Gary” count for the over (as picked up on stump mic) - 4.*

*Inlcudes a “Nice Gaz”.
 
13th over: Pakistan 28-1 (Sami 4, Babar 16)

These might not be perfect batting conditions but Babar Azam has unfurled an 
effortless drive through extra cover that deserves its own Instagram account, 
wellbeing detox juice range and celebrity followers. Babar bats like a man with 
all the time in the world, which is handy when Starc’s zinging down 150kph 
under lights.

Starc bowling a shorter length in response to that Babar drive, time for a pep 
talk from mid-on.

12th over: Pakistan 22-1 (Sami 4, Babar 10)

The haunting cry of “NOYYYYCE GARRAY!” echoes in the Queensland night, which 
can only mean one thing, Nathan Lyon is to share the newish ball with Mitchell 
Starc. The TV commentators are delighted, talking up Lyon’s ability extract 
turn and bounce from the Gabba surface. It wouldn’t have anything to do with 
the desperately slow over rate, nope.

A straightforward maiden is played out by Sami who props forward and dead bats 
six offies from around the wicket.
 
11th over: Pakistan 22-1 (Sami 4, Babar 10)

Right, we’re back underway, and it’s Mitchell Starc with a newish pink ball 
under lights at the Gabba. Test batting doesn’t get any tougher than this.

The big lefty is on target without threatening carnage. A couple of singles 
ease the Pakistan machine into life.
 
This logic is hard to refute. Glum faced emoji.

I know it’s impolite to start with a gripe, but the final session tonight is 
scheduled to contain a minimum of 37 overs. It begs the question - what on 
earth has been going on since the start of play for only 51 overs plus an 
innings break to be achieved in two full sessions?

While the MCC’s World Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> 
Committee fiddles on the margins of issues that might effect the game, a 
honking great pustule continues to plague the longest format. Players should be 
incentivised to speed up, with disincentives increasingly stringent. It is 
90-overs minimum in a day and it shouldn’t require a mad dash with spin from 
both ends near the close for the skipper to avoid a fine.
 
Thank you very much Geoff. 

A couple of public service announcements to kick us off.

If you can’t wait until the resumption of play to slake your thirst for OBO, 
the Guardian has you covered with England batting against India on the first 
day of the final Test of that particular tour. And Joe Root is batting, so it 
should be fun.

India v England, fifth Test: day one – live!

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/dec/16/india-v-england-fifth-test-day-one-live> 
It felt almost inevitable that there would be an early wicket here, what with 
the cloudy skies and the speed and menace of the Australian opening bowling 
pair. There was, just the one though, with the young duo of Babar and Sami 
holding firm until the break. That was just a matter of 10 overs though, and 
there will be up to 37 more to face today. Pakistan must get through to stumps 
without losing more than another one, perhaps two at most, to have any chance 
of drawing close to Australia’s first-innings total. A big ask, but not 
impossible on this pretty decent batting surface if they can get a few hours 
during the sunlight tomorrow.

That’s enough from me - Geoff Lemon waving you farewell, and Jonathan Howcroft 
will handle the pips, the other pips, and the cheerios from here on in.

10th over: Pakistan 20-1 (Sami 3, Babar 9)

Same pattern even as the spinner comes on. Babar gets the poor short ball from 
Lyon and forces a single away. Then Sami gets the better balls, a couple 
turning sharply. The second especially he almost has to fall on to smother. 
Then he gets a bit rattled, sees the next one dropping wide, and tries a mighty 
wallop across the line. Even if he had hit that, it would probably just have 
gone 20 metres up in the air and been caught. Instead, he missed, despite 
Wade’s insistence otherwise from behind the stumps. Sami gets his composure 
back for the last couple of defended balls, and there is the tea break.

 
9th over: Pakistan 19-1 (Sami 3, Babar 8)

Jackson Bird on for his first foray, and Babar is immediately pushing through 
cover again for a run to get away from the bowling. Sami Aslam has proved much 
more willing to stand there and soak up deliveries, and he starts doing exactly 
that here. Watchful defence is the name, leaving where he can. Finally, from 
the last ball of the over, he gets his second run, then celebrates that with 
this third, after glancing to fine leg.

 
8th over: Pakistan 16-1 (Sami 1, Babar 7)

At least there’s some good positive stuff from Babar. Doesn’t look totally in 
control but he’s trying to turn the strike over and keep the bowlers from 
having it all their own way. Gets off strike against Hazlewood by squeezing a 
single to leg, then the bowler pings Sami in the helmet. A glancing blow, Hot 
Spot shows, and the batsman continues without medical intervention. Took his 
eyes off the ball there and was struck. He gets off strike next ball with a leg 
bye, then Babar takes a nice sharp single into the covers. That positivity 
again.

 
7th over: Pakistan 13-1 (Sami 1, Babar 5)

Babar is away as well. Gets a very wide and short ball that he chases, 
injudiciously, but manages to flail a couple of runs with the flourished toe of 
the bat. Then he chases the second ball, rather dragging it in the air through 
cover, but safely again and takes a couple more. The single to fine leg, and 
Sami survives the last couple of Starc short balls. Dusk starting to settle 
here in Brisbane. Feels like a wicket could fall any moment.

 
6th over: Pakistan 8-1 (Sami 1, Babar 0)

“How many lbw appeals must a bowler yell down, before you can give him a 
wicket?” So wrote a Nobel-winning lyricist, or thereabouts, as Hazlewood spends 
most of his over yelling and running backwards down the pitch. If that was the 
point of the game, he would have won it already. But, sadly, Backwards Yell 
Running is only a sport in small Scottish towns on certain festival days. 
Hazlewood pins Sami on the pad but too high, then Babar low down but via an 
inside edge, then Babar with another full ball that is just sliding down leg. 
Umpire Gould makes all three calls correctly, and the Australians resist 
reviewing them all correctly. Sami is off his duck with a single into the 
covers, and there’s a leg bye from the third appeal.

 
5th over: Pakistan 6-1 (Sami 0, Babar 0)

Babar Azam. Like the catchphrase of an elephant wizard. Another young batsman 
out in the middle, 22 and his partner is 21. His feet are dancing, shuffling in 
the crease as he awaits Starc, making sure he’s alert. But his head is still, 
and he looks comfortable enough in trying circumstances. Evades a couple, 
leaves a couple. Survives the over.
