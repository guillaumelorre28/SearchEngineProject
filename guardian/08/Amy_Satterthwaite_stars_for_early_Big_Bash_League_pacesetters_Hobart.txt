Satterthwaite bowled the final over in both games, holding her nerve in 
each. On Saturday she denied the Renegades the 11 runs they needed to win and 
kept them to five on Sunday to force a super over.

Although Satterthwaite was dismissed for a first ball duck in the extra over, 
Matthew and Erin Burns got them to the target of 13, with the latter smacking a 
four off the last ball.

There was better fortune for Melbourne’s other side, the Stars, as they 
completed a weekend home double over Sydney Sixers, with a six-wicket win on 
Sunday.

Jess Cameron scored 45 and Katie Mack 48 in an unbroken fourth wicket stand 
off 77 off 10 overs, to carry the Stars to their target of 112 with 19 balls to 
spare.

The Sixers’ Ashleigh Gardner completed a good weekend following up her 38 on 
Saturday with 43 on Sunday, but lacked support.
