The world’s largest collection of paper peepshows, depicting events that 
include Napoleon’s 1812 invasion of Moscow and Queen Victoria’s coronation, has 
been gifted to theVictoria and Albert Museum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/v-and-a>.

Private collectors Jacqueline and Jonathan Gestetner donated their collection 
of more than 360 peepshows to the country under thecultural gifts scheme 
<http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/tax-incentives/cultural-gifts-scheme>. 

Catherine Yvard, special collections curator at the National Art Library, part 
of the V&A, said it was thrilled to be the new custodian. “This collection is a 
real treasure trove,” she said. “Peeping into one of these tunnel books is like 
stepping into another world, travelling through time and space.”

When some people think of peepshows, they might think of something slightly 
sleazy, said Yvard. But that is a world away from the items in the Gestetner 
collection, which are mostly pocket-sized stage sets depicting landscapes, 
military parades and historical events.

Paper peepshows originated in Germany and Austria in the 1820s but quickly 
gained popularity in the UK. They would most commonly be sold as souvenirs 
celebrating landmark events or engineering feats, such as the construction of
the Thames tunnel by father and son duo Marc and Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 
1825-43

The cultural gifts scheme was introduced in 2013 to allow people to donate 
outstanding items or works of art to public collections in return for a tax 
reduction. The scheme is administered byArts Council England 
<http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/>, which decides which organisation to give the 
gift to.

Yvard said the V&A’s peepshow collection would be digitised and made 
accessible in the reading rooms of the National Art Library.

The Gestetners said: “We are thrilled that through the cultural gifts scheme 
our collection, charting the origin of the paper peepshow from the 1820s to the 
present day, which has given us immense pleasure over the years, will now join 
the V&A’s collections where it can be enjoyed by many others and used for study 
purposes.”

The oldest paper peepshow in the collection was made in Austria by HF Müller 
circa 1824-25, depicting an idyllic garden leading to a large country house. 
The longest is a handmade peepshow from about 1910, spanning more than 2 metres 
and featuring riflemen on manoeuvre.
