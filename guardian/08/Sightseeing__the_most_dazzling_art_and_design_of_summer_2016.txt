Mona Hatoum

Global politics and domestic life, personal threat and vulnerability are 
consistent themes in Beirut-born Mona Hatoum’s art. The breadth of her artistic 
language, with its references to minimalism and surrealism, the domestic and 
the social, the frightening and the delicate, unfolds in this survey of more 
than 35 years of sculpture and installation.

George Shaw

A teenage George Shaw used to paint in his local wood. Now, as the National 
Gallery’s resident artist, he has been developing new scenes while studying the 
greatest forests in art, from the woods where a friar is hacked to death in
Bellini’s The Assassination of Saint Peter Martyr 
<https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/giovanni-bellini-the-assassination-of-saint-peter-martyr>
 to the English common elegiacally portrayed inGainsborough’s Cornard Wood 
<https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/thomas-gainsborough-cornard-wood-near-sudbury-suffolk>
. Shaw was Turner-nominated for his paintings of rancid contemporary 
landscapes. How will he fare among the masters?

Sunken Cities

Was ancient Egypt an African civilisation or a Mediterranean one? Both, of 
course, but for centuries its art and religion have been viewed as if facing 
inward, separate to the creative fizz of maritime trade that kindled Greek 
genius. This exhibition reveals recent finds from two long-lost Egyptian 
cities, Thonis-Heracleion and Canopus, both trading entrepots at the mouth of 
the Nile. This is not only an archaeological adventure story about divers 
exploring submerged ruins but an explosive new body of evidence about Egypt’s 
dynamic role in the history of Homer’s “wine dark sea”.

At Home in Britain: Designing the House of Tomorrow

Britain is in the depths of a catastrophic housing crisis, yet fresh thinking 
about the home is strangely absent from the debate. To put that right, six 
architects from Britain, the Netherlands and France have been tasked with 
rethinking the traditional British housing templates of cottage, terrace and 
flat. Using the extensiveRiba archives 
<https://www.architecture.com/RIBA/Visitus/Library/Collections/Archives.aspx> 
as a starting point, the architects will explore affordability, communal living 
and housing density in today’s Britain.

Maria Lassnig 

The confessional, bleakly humorous paintings and animations of Austrian artist 
Maria Lassnig, who died in 2014 at the age of 94, deserve a wider audience. 
Following a highly conservative art education in Vienna during the second world 
war, Lassnig went on to make tender and alarming paintings about human 
relationships and the solitude of the female artist. An exemplary, necessary 
artist.

Martin Creed: What You Find 

Martin Creed is at it again. He can be joyous, he can be dirty. The sculptor, 
painter, musician, and performer’s art is always filled with surprises. Minimal 
gestures, bodily functions, dogs, dances, running, counting and other 
repetitive acts are woven through Creed’s affectionate and sometimes all too 
human art.

angular geometries to theGiant’s Causeway visitor centre

borders”, it hopes to overcome geographical and political boundaries through 
its digital collections, too.

Alejandro Aravena 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/13/chilean-architect-alejandro-aravena-wins-2016-pritzker-prize>
, this year’s Biennale promises to shine a light on architecture as a social 
and political, as much as artistic, discipline. “One of the biggest mistakes 
that architects make,” says Aravena, “is they tend to deal with problems that 
only interest other architects.” He will attempt to bulldoze through the 
archispeak and knock the experts out of their ivory towers, focusing on urgent 
urban issues of poverty, pollution, congestion and segregation instead.

Bhupen Khakhar

Magic realism is usually seen as a literary style but it well describes the 
fantastical humanity of Bhupen Khakhar’s paintings. This Indian artist, who 
died in 2003, made no apology for mixing eastern and western inspiration, 
gleefully echoing European artists including Rousseau and Miro, as well as 
having a lot in common with Hockney. In fact, he made no apology for anything 
at all. Homosexuality and nudity proliferate in his painted montages of modern 
India. This may well be one of the summer’s popular hits – Khakhar is a delight.

An elegant, urbane octogenarian, Katz paints like no one else. His language is 
pared down, acute, as alert to art history as it is to the feel of modern life 
and the vagaries of nature and light, faces and figures. Focusing on landscape 
and portraiture, his art brings a spring to the step.

Surreal Encounters: Collecting the Marvellous 

In René Magritte’s Portrait of Edward James, a young man stands with his back 
to us, looking into a mirror. We expect to see his face reflected, but instead 
the mirror contains another image of his dark slicked hair and besuited back. 
James was Magritte’s patron and an enthusiastic collector of surrealist art. 
This exhibition takes a sidelong view of surrealism through the eyes (or the 
backs of heads) of James and three other collectors who helped define it. Can 
you own a dream? Apparently you can.

Mary Heilmann: Looking at Pictures 

Heilmann’s art has been called boorish and ugly, funky and ballsy. Sounds good 
to me. Her works and furniture (is it a painting or is it a chair?) are 
exhilarating collisions of Californian colour and abstract structure, hot and 
cool, formal prat-falls, painterly licks and riffs, with colour to make your

Manifesta 11: What People Do for Money 

Manifesta pops up somewhere different in Europe every two years. The latest, 
in Zurich, will be one of the largest and most complex yet, featuring 
collaborations between artists and local organisations and workers. Catalan 
artist Carles Congost is working with the Zurich fire brigade to produce a 
film, Maurizio Cattelan with a Paralympic athlete, and Teresa Margolles with a 
transsexual sex worker. Meanwhile, novelistMichel Houellebecq  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/michelhouellebecq>has teamed up with a 
doctor to present a meticulous evaluation of his health.

Painter’s Paintings: from Freud to Van Dyck 

When Lucian Freud 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/21/lucien-lucian-freud-obituary>
 died in 2011, he left the National Gallerya strange portrait 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/04/lucian-freud-donates-portrait-nation>
 by the landscape master Corot. It inspired the gallery to research other 
paintings in its collection previously owned by artists, and this exhibition is 
the result. What paintings do painters collect: mirrors to their own work, 
personal inspirations, private obsessions, or ones that just look nice on the 
studio wall? Strong loans will reveal why Matisse owned a Cezanne, why Degas 
was a dedicated collector and more tales of artists under the influence.

Carsten Höller’s Slide at Anish Kapoor’s Orbit

For those in search of pure hedonism with no implied critique of the system 
(its patron is Boris Johnson, after all) Anish Kapoor’s spiralling red Orbit 
tower becomes a giant helter-skelter this summer with the addition of a 178m 
slide by interactive art star Carsten Höller. The London Mayor hopes this will 
help lure in some punters to his very expensive folly, but Kapoor says this 
wrap-around was foisted on him and hopes Boris will be first to the bottom.

Stanley Spencer: Of Angels and Dirt 

British painter Stanley Spencer boasted some famous fans – among them the late 
David Bowie. The Thin White Duke would surely have been booking a return fare 
to Yorkshire for this major Spencer survey, featuring more than 70 works, 
including rarely seen self-portraits, the monumental second world war series 
Shipbuilding on the Clyde and the five paintings that make up his Peace and 
Industry pentaptych, reunited from their private owners.

 Joyous colours, casual fun … David Hockney’s Barry Humphries, 26-28 March 
Photograph: Richard Schmidt/David Hockney 
David Hockney 


In the 1960s, David Hockney found light and freedom in Los Angeles. He gazed 
on its swimming pools 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/feb/10/an-even-bigger-splash-why-david-hockneys-pop-art-poem-lives-on>
 and became this entrancing city’s most famous painter. Hockney’s recent return 
home to paint in Yorkshire was, artistically, a strange experiment; a retreat 
from the modernity he thrives on. Now he is in LA again, the joyous colours and 
casual fun of the portraits in this exhibition suggest he’s enjoying life 
hugely. Some will scoff but only fools mock the Hock.

Georgia O’Keeffe

Sometimes we think we know an artist so well through popular reproductions and 
posters that we stop looking. The American modernist Georgia O’Keeffe was more 
than a painter of sexualised flowers and organic New Mexico mountains. But how 
much more? The first survey in Britain for more than 20 years looks at her 
seven-decade long career, her context and continuing influence.

Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson combines film and song, autobiography and

Visitors, in which friends sing a tender love song in a decayed mansion, an 
all-day, everyday live performance in the gallery by a group of troubadours 
(which had us in tears when we saw it in New York), and a film of the artist 
and his actor mother spitting on one another. Love, tears, saliva: what more 
could anyone want?

Made You Look

The recent death of master photographer Malick Sidibé was mourned by the 
worlds of art and fashion in equal measure – and no wonder. His snapshots of 
post-colonial nightlife in Mali redefined the idea of black beauty and style, 
for men as much a women. Sidibé is an obvious inclusion in this new show, 
curated by Ekow Eshun, exploring the figure of the black Dandy as a powerful 
but vulnerable emblem of radical black politics, not just a sharp dresser.

Facing the World: Self-Portraiture from Rembrandt to Ai Weiwei

Everything changes in art but the passion for self-portraiture. Rembrandt 
might not recogniseAi Weiwei 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei> or Sarah Lucas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/06/sarah-lucas-venice-biennale-interview>
 as fellow students of selfhood, but today’s media-conscious artists are just 
as fixated on their own images as he was 350 years ago. In the Renaissance, 
artists who until then were seen as artisans became famous as creative 
individuals. Their self-portraits were collected as relics of genius, a pull as 
old as a painter looking in the mirror.

William Eggleston 


The great US artist William Eggleston does not so much take photographs as 
bottle atmosphere. Eggleston’s pictures of the American south have so much 
atmosphere you can get drunk on bourbon just by looking at them. If Harper Lee, 
Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers got together to write the ultimate 
southern story collection, they might have produced something like these 
portraits. A cigarette between bony fingers, a white man standing in front of 
his black chauffeur – details are deadly when Eggleston points his camera.
