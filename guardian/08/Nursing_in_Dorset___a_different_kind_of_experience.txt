‘This is the most rewarding job I’ve had’

Tony Coliandris has worked as a ward staff nurse at Bridport Community 
Hospital for four years, and has just begun training as a nurse practitioner. 
He moved down from Cardiff, and now can’t imagine working anywhere else.

“My wife and I trained as nurses together and, after we qualified, took a 
camper van trip around the south west. We knew Bridport from the River Cottage 
TV series, and when we got here we just fell in love with the place.

It stayed in the back of our minds and a few years later, after our second 
child arrived, we decided it was where we wanted to be. We found a place 
surrounded by beautiful countryside and also close to the sea, which I think is 
good for the soul. The people here are so laid back and friendly, and we fitted 
in straight away.

We had been living near Cardiff city centre, and the lifestyle here just 
suited us so much more. We have three girls, aged nine to 15, and it is a great 
place for them to grow up. We have a bit of land to grow our own veg and keep 
goats, chickens and ducks. And for someone like me who loves cycling, mountain 
biking and fishing, it’s perfect.

Bridport Hospital has a lovely feel to it, and there’s a lot of variety here – 
theatres, outpatient services, minor injuries, and so on. I’ve just started 
training as a nurse practitioner, so there are plenty of opportunities for 
career development. We also have community nurses and mental health workers, 
and I don’t think you could pick a better place to do that kind of role than an 
area like this.

I’ve worked in intensive care at an acute hospital and in the private sector 
in London, but this is the most rewarding job I’ve had. The hospital is so 
loved by the community, you know how important it is to people, and that makes 
such a difference. I love coming in to work.”

‘Breathing fresh air every day is beautiful’

Gifty Markey, a consultant nurse for inpatient mental health, joined Dorset 
HealthCare in 2015 after spells working in Bristol, Somerset and London. She 
was drawn in by the chance to tackle her dream job, and found it provided all 
the stimulation she craved – without the daily hassle of city life.

“I worked in a women’s forensic service in London for just over two years. I 
enjoyed the work, but had to travel from Mitcham to Ealing every day and it 
just became a bit of a grind. The travel, the congestion, the expense – it was 
really hard. I would have to leave home very early, and then finish late, just 
to avoid the traffic. It’s not great for family life.

Dorset is a complete contrast. It may not sound like a big deal, but just 
breathing fresh air every day is beautiful. I am based close to the sea, and 
being able to walk along the beach during my lunch break or when I finish work 
is such a luxury.

I came here because being a consultant nurse for acute inpatient mental health 
services has always been my dream job. I’m basically here to ensure we maintain 
quality and support improvements in how we deliver care, and I work with teams 
in nine wards across Poole, Dorchester and Weymouth.

It’s such a great place to be, I feel like I’m on holiday every day.

It is exactly the professional challenge I wanted. Every day is different, 
which gives me a lot of room to grow, and my manager gives me the support and 
flexibility I need. What I particularly love is that, alongside the audit, 
research, training and development side of the role, I still get to use my 
clinical skills on a regular basis. I love nursing, but when you move into a 
management role, there’s always the danger you end up being removed from nurses 
on the front line. That’s not the case here – I can go onto a ward and muck in 
with staff any time I want to, and no one bats an eyelid.

I definitely see myself being here long term. I work very hard, but it’s such 
a great place to be, I feel like I’m on holiday every day.”
