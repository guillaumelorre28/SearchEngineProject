The Fox TV show will be an adaptation of the original 1971 William Peter 
Blatty novel of the same name.

Fox released a trailer for the new show at last week’s Comic-Con 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comic-con-2016>. The show’s creator Jeremy 
Slater, the writer of last year’s lackluster Fantastic Four, and the cast were 
also at Comic-Con to answer fan questions.

Actor Ben Daniels will play Father Marcus Brennan on the show. As a fan of the 
original, he was skeptical about joining the cast but he assured fans at 
Comic-Con: “It’s not a remake of the original movie. It lives in the real 
world.”


The original film adaptation is widely regarded as one of the greatest horror 
films of all time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/exorcist-friedkin-horror>, and it 
has had a significant influence on pop culture. It is one of the 
highest-grossing films in history and was nominated for 10 Academy awards.

While the book and film were based on a true story of a 1949 exorcism in St 
Louis, the TV show follows two priests and a suburban Chicago family who are 
experiencing what they fear is a demonic presence in their home.

The show is set to debut on Fox on 23 September.
