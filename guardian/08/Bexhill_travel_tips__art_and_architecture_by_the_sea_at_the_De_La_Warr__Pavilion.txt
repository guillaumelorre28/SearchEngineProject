Commissioned in the 1930s as an arts centre for the people of Bexhill, the De 
La Warr Pavilion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/aug/06/architecture1>, designed 
by architectsErich Mendelsohn <http://www.erichmendelsohn.com/> and Serge 
Chermayeff, has always felt open and expansive. There are wide terracesto take 
tea on, a spectacular spiral staircase to sweep down and views of the churning 
sea through walls of glass at every turn.

Restored in the 1990s to its former modernist glory, it lives up to its 
forward-thinking architecture with an often cutting-edge programme of events, 
although mainstream comedians and musicians do perform.

Beyond its walls are the shingle beach, a breezy promenade and Bexhill town, a 
treasure trove of vintage and antique shops, including the recently opened Eras 
of Style (erasofstyle.com <http://www.erasofstyle.com/about-us/>) on Terminus 
Road.
