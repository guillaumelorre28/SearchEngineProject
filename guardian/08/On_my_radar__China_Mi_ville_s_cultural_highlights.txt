 ‘Captivating’: Carolyn O’Brien. 
Among her works in progress, alongside those for more familiar instruments, 
composer Carolyn O’Brien lists pieces for tap dancer and mixed surfaces, toy 
piano and “a flock of chirping bird whistles”. Often witty in its fervour and 
strangeness, O’Brien’s captivating work is never laboured or kooky. 
Underpinning it is a disquieting urgency, probing the limits of performance. 
There are several audio files on her website,carolynobrienmusic.com 
<http://carolynobrienmusic.com/>, and to the impatient delight of listeners, 
there is also now a promise that her forthcoming doctoral recital will soon 
join them.

 Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor: ‘combines anger with rare subtlety’. 
Mainstream political discourse right now, not only but particularly in the US, 
seems to be on a race to the bottom, eager to plumb and rehabilitate new depths 
of vileness. The#BlackLivesMatter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/19/blacklivesmatter-birth-civil-rights-movement>
 movement has been one inspiring and salutary dissenting tendency to that and 
it couldn’t have a better analyst. Comradely and sympathetic without losing 
critical edge, Taylor always combines anger and rigour with rare and clear 
subtlety. Her examination of the changing contours of radical race politics is 
bound to be indispensable.

Autobiographies often revolve around specialness, self-aggrandisement 
camouflaged as the opposite. “I was always a weird kid”, and so on. There’s no 
such cloying humblebrag in Samanci’s affecting comic book memoir of her 
everyday youth in Turkey in the 80s and early 90s, of a child’s fascinations – 
with household items, with family and society, with (winningly) Jacques 
Cousteau. The art is simple but never twee – not least because, in occasional 
shocking moments, the horrifying state violence of the time is rendered in 
exactly the same style as the children’s games.

 Crumbs: ‘the team do miracles with their micro budget’. Photograph: BiraBiro 
Films 
While Mad Max: Fury Road hoovers up awards, this is the other great 
post-apocalypse movie of 2015.Crumbs is an Ethiopian-Spanish-Finnish 
co-production, from the melancholy wing of the (newly trendy) tradition of 
Afrofuturism. Afrodystopianism? Afropostfuturism, surely. In an eerie bowling 
hall, a sweet love story commences between the superb leads, Selam Tesfayie and 
Daniel Tadesse. Director Miguel Llansó and the team do miracles with their 
micro budget: a dilapidated spaceship hangs above an Ethiopia of ghost towns, 
discarded tat, peculiar Nazis and a combative Santa Claus.

 ‘Cool rigour and generosity’: Satellites by Caitlín Doherty. 
A tactile and lovely chapbook put out by Tipped Press <http://tippedpress.com/>
. In this thematically linked sequence, Doherty, an outstanding young poet, 
uses our orbital trash, the bric-a-brac of communication tech and a deflating 
space race as a hook for her interrogations. Even a familiar notion is 
reinvigorated: the pathos of the first dog in space is not a subject previously 
untouched, but in her eulogy to Laika, Doherty marries cool rigour and 
generosity without sentimentality, and if you can get to the end without 
tearing up you’re stronger than I.

Animal Money by Michael Cisco 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Animal-Money-Michael-Cisco/dp/1621052125> 
 Michael Cisco: ‘brilliant and demanding’. 
Any new novel by Cisco <http://michaelcisco.blogspot.co.uk/>, one of the key 
figures in the experimental fantastic, is cause for delight.Animal Money, like 
most of his work, is brilliant and demanding and sui generis. Like the sentient 
money it depicts, the book seems to expand and forge on with its own strange 
conspiracies. Simultaneously the strangest high-finance thriller ever and a 
rumination on value theory and the financial shituation (sic), it deserves to 
provoke as much excitement among philosophers of money as it does among 
aficionados of weird fiction.

 Toyen’s Spící (1937) from Museum Kampa. Photograph: Museum Kampa 
There are two days left to get to Prague’s Museum Kampa to see the works of 
the astonishing artist Toyen. A founder of the Czech surrealist group in 1934, 
the erstwhile Marie Čermínová worked across several media, including herself: 
the new name she chose derived from the revolutionary Frenchcitoyen, and with 
it she refused the conventional feminine of the time. Profoundly political, 
erotic and minatory, Toyen’s paintings and pen-and-ink work feel like messages 
smuggled out from bleak dreams or visions we can only half decode.
