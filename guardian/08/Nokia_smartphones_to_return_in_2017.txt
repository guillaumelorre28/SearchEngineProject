Do you pine for the days of your Nokia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nokia> 3210? When phones were simple 
and the Finish company was cutting edge?

That’s the kind of nostalgia that the Nokia brand will be banking on when it 
returns to the smartphone market next year, afterselling out to Microsoft in 
2013

.

A company set up by former Nokia employees called HMD Global has licensed the 
Nokia brand name from Microsoft, struck partnerships with device manufacturer
Foxconn <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/foxconn> and intends to launch 
an Android smartphone in the early part of 2017.

The head of HMD Global, Arto Nummela, said: “Consumers may be carrying 
different smartphones now, but are they really in love and loyal to those 
brands?”

HMD Global will be looking to stir nostalgia in an effort to challenge the big 
and small players of the highly competitive smartphone market, dominated by 
Samsung and Apple, as well as Chinese brands such as Huawei.

Nummela said: “We want to be one of the key competitive players in the 
smartphone business.”

Brand power

That road will be tough from a standing start, but brand power might be an 
edge against lesser-known rivals.

“For a new entrant, having an established brand provides it with an instant 
on-ramp,” said Ben Wood from analysts CCS Insight. “The barriers to entry for 
the Android phone space are low.

“What HMD has is the Nokia brand and management experience. The key to its 
success will be driving scale.”

After the sale of the Nokia phone business to Microsoft in 2014 and the cull 
of the Nokia brand from Microsoft’s Lumia range of smartphones, the consumer 
brand lived on as a maker of feature or so-called dumb phones, mainly for Asia, 
India and eastern Europe.

HMD took over the Nokia feature phone business from Microsoft on Thursday 
following the sale of the business in May

. It has a licensing deal with Nokia giving it sole use of the brand on mobile 
phones and tablets for the next decade. It will pay Nokia royalties for the 
brand and patents, but Nokia has no direct investment in HMD.

Instead, filled with ex-Nokia personnel, and executives from Siemens, Rovio 
and others, HMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund run by 
Jean-Francois Baril, who was once in charge of Nokia’s world-leading supply 
chain management system. Other HMD managers have put in money of their own.

Shipments of Nokia feature phones plunged 40% in 2015 and HMD must reverse 
that decline while trying to break back into the smartphone market, where 
hundreds of vendors compete by selling phones that can be hard to distinguish.

Nummela says his team’s enduring relationships with phone service providers 
and retailers could help HMD quickly convince owners of Nokia feature phones to 
upgrade in markets like India, Indonesia and Russia.

In the UK and other smartphone-dominated markets, Nokia smartphones will have 
to overcome the various contenders for the world number three spot, currently 
held by the rising Huawei.
