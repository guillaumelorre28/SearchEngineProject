“I will not be voting for Clinton,” Steele told a dinner in honor of the 40th 
anniversary of the progressive magazineMother Jones in San Francisco Friday. “I 
will not be voting for Trump either.”

Steele, a former Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, said that Trump has 
“captured that racist underbelly, that frustration, that angry underbelly of 
American life and gave voice to that.”

“I was damn near puking during the debates,” Steele said, adding that he 
believes Trump only represents 30% of the Republican Party.

. That’s not counting the money Lewandowski has made as a hired commentator at 
CNN. Lewandowski, a police academy graduate, was a state-level political 
operative in New Hampshire before he jumped the Trump train. The Huffington Post
points out 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lewandowski-trump-donations_us_580979a2e4b0cdea3d869f0e?r5k>
 that neither Lewandowski nor other highly paid Trump hires have given any cash 
to the effort actually to elect the candidate. 
 * The Clinton campaign has released a new ad featuring Khizr and Ghazala 
Khan, parents of slain Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in a suicide 
bombing attack in Iraq in 2004. One of the sharpest moments of widespread 
bipartisan revulsion at Donald Trump in the campaign came when Trump criticized 
the Khans for their appearance at the Democratic national convention to tell 
their son’s story. Khizr Khan offered Trump his pocket constitution, wondering 
whether he’d ever read it. Trump discounted their story and questioned why 
Ghazala Khan did not address the convention. The Khans are Muslim, as was their 
son.

At a rally in Cleveland this afternoon, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> began her remarks with a 
reprised joke from the previous night’s charity banquet.

“I have now spent 4.5 hours on stage with Donald proving once again I have the 
stamina to be president,” Clinton said, drawing laughs and cheers from the 
1,600 supporters who gathered a college gymnasium in Cleveland.

Directly behind Clinton, a woman wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the words: 
“Nasty Woman”. The phrase has become something of a feminist rallying cry ever 
since Trump leaned into his mic during the third and final debate on Wednesday 
and spit the words, intended as an insult.

Clinton also attacked Trump for his brazen admission that he would keep 
Americans “in suspense” about whether the Republican nominee will concede the 
election should he lose in November. At a Thursday rally, Trump said he would 
accept the legitimacy of the election results – if he won.

“Make no mistake,” Clinton told the crowd, “by doing that he is threatening 
our democracy.”

“Look, if you lose an election – I have lost an election – you don’t feel very 
good the next day,” Clinton continued. “But we know in our country the 
difference between leadership and dictatorship.”

Prior to the rally, Clinton met with two high-profile activists associated 
with the Black Lives Matter movement: Brittany Packnett and DeRay McKesson. 
Over the past 18 months on the trail, Clinton has been confronted by activists 
challenging her past support for drug policies that wrecked black communities.

Today, Clinton credited these honest and at turns frank conversations with 
activists and young leaders for helping to inform her policy agenda to reform 
the criminal justice system and improve relationships between the police and 
communities of color.

“All the advocates and activists who have challenged us to think about these 
issues of race and justice and equality and opportunity in new and powerful 
ways really deserve our appreciation,” Clinton said.

“I am going to do everything I can to lift these issues up because one of my 
hopes for my presidency will be to root out systemic racism and bigotry and 
discrimination in whatever form it takes.”

Report: Hillary Clinton making a play for Utah

As if we needed more evidence that the political world has been turned 
upside-down,Buzzfeed News is reporting 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/the-clinton-campaign-is-making-a-play-for-utah?utm_term=.fnMj4jryLw#.piVM6MbpBY>
 that Hillary Clinton is making a late-game play for Utah - a state so red that 
it hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in more than half a 
century.

Seizing Donald Trump’s anemic support among the state’s largely Mormon 
population - Trump’s coarse rhetoric hasnever played well 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/21/utah-mormon-voters-anti-donald-trump-republican-caucuses>
 with Latter-Day Saints, nor has his pledge to ban followers of politically 
unpopular religions from entering the United States - the Clinton campaign is 
reportedly adding five paid staffers to the state’s office in Salt Lake City, 
and is adding financing to fund in-state advertisements and organization 
efforts.

Clinton, who in August published an op-ed in the Deseret News 
<http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865659843/Exclusive-Hillary-Clinton-What-I-have-in-common-with-Utah-leaders-2-religious-freedom-and-the.html?pg=all>
 emphasizing the importance of religious freedom, likely sees an opportunity in 
the form of insurgent third-party candidate Evan McMullin. McMullin, a former 
CIA officer, a devout Mormon and longtime Republican, has outpolled both 
Clinton and Trump in recent days, turning what would normally be a walk for 
Republican candidates into a three-way race for the state’s six electoral votes:

Mitt Romney won Utah by 50 points in 2012.

“Through the looking glass we go, where the front is always back, and what’s 
left is right, and sometimes wrong is right, night is day and white is black...”

In a 2000 visit to the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, then-tycoon and 
future presidential nominee Donald Trump waxed about how “brilliantly” Adolf 
Hitler came to power in 1930s Germany, according to commentsunearthed by 
Buzzfeed News 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/nathanielmeyersohn/donald-trumps-trip-to-the-holocaust-museum?bftwnews&utm_term=.nfLXZXY2NR#.vqBeaelz5R>
:

In the 1930s, everyone thought that Adolf Hitler was a fringe element who 
could never come to power. And the Center shows this and how he came to power 
so brilliantly, but people thought, if you read history from the Twenties, you 
would say, ‘this could never have happened.’ And it did happen.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center is a Holocaust remembrance museum named after 
Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal.

 that increased Latino turnout won’t affect the final results.

“Nah,” Brewer said, when asked about increased Latino turnout in response to 
Donald Trump’s candidacy. “They don’t get out and vote.’’

Alrighty then.

In a radio segment that aired this afternoon, actress Salma Hayek told a 
Spanish-language radio station that Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> attempted to date her while 
she was in a relationship and, after she rejected his advances, planted a story 
in the National Enquirer tabloid that she was too short for him to be 
interested in romantically.

Pinault. Photograph: Patrick Kovarik/AFP/Getty Images 
“When I met that man, I had a boyfriend, and he tried to become his friend to 
get my home telephone number,” Hayek said,according to a Buzzfeed News 
translation 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/salma-hayek-i-denied-trump-a-date-so-he-planted-a-national-e?utm_term=.kemqVqaNkE#.wkrQNQemkd>
 of the conversation. “He got my number and he would call me to invite me out.”


When she told Trump that she wouldn’t go out with him even if she were single, 
“someone told the National Enquirer,” Hayek said.

“I’m not going to say who, because you know that whatever he wants to come out 
comes out in the National Enquirer,” Hayek, who has endorsed Democratic 
presidential nomineeHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, continued. “It said that 
he wouldn’t go out with me because I was too short.”


“Later, he called and left me a message,” Hayek said. “‘Can you believe this? 
Who would say this? I don’t want people to think this about you.’ He thought 
that I would try to go out with him so people wouldn’t think that’s why he 
wouldn’t go out with me.”

Facebook employees reportedly pushed to remove Donald Trump posts as 'hate 
speech'

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s positions on Muslim immigration 
- that it should be halted until“our country’s representatives can figure out 
what’s going on” 
<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration>
 - prompted some Facebook employees to advocate that some of his postings on 
the social network should be deleted as hate speech, a report claims.

According to the Wall Street Journal 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-employees-pushed-to-remove-trump-posts-as-hate-speech-1477075392>
, the matter eventually hit the desk of Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg, who declared internally that it would be “inappropriate” for 
Facebook to censor the posts, even if they did meet the criteria for hate 
speech:

Issues around Mr. Trump’s posts emerged when he posted on Facebook a link to a 
Dec. 7 campaign statement “on preventing Muslim immigration.” The statement 
called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States 
until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.”

“When we review reports of content that may violate our policies, we take 
context into consideration,” a Facebook spokesperson told the Wall Street 
Journal’s report. “That context can include the value of political discourse. 
Many people are voicing opinions about this particular content and it has 
become an important part of the conversation around who the next US president 
will be. For those reasons, we are carefully reviewing each report and 
surrounding context relating to this content on a case by case basis.”

The Trump campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment on the 
matter.

Poll: Half of Republicans would reject election result if Clinton wins

Only half of likely Republican voters say that they will accept Hillary 
Clinton as their president if the former secretary of state wins in the 
upcoming general election,a new poll from Reuters/Ipsos showed 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-rigging-idUSKCN12L2O2>, 
indicating that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’scontinued 
baseless attacks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/citizens-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-roger-stone-rigged-election-claim>
 on the election as “rigged” has permeated his voters base.

Nearly 70% of Republican voters said that if Clinton wins, it will be due to 
illegal voting or vote rigging. The same percentage of Democrats, meanwhile, 
said that they would accept a Trump victory.

Nearly 80% of Republicans told Reuters that they are concerned about “the 
accuracy of the final vote count,” and only six in ten are confident that their 
votes will be tabulated accurately.

Trump counts himself as one of those who isn’t necessarily sure to support 
Clinton if she is indeed elected, winkingly telling viewers of the third 
presidential debate that “I will keep you in suspense” on whether he would 
concede the election to Clinton.

Speaking in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> wrapped up his speech by 
making numerous promises to those attending the rally:

“We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and even 
actually a little bit bigger,” Trump said. “We’re going to eliminate every 
unnecessary job-killing regulation. We are going to defend religious liberty. 
We’ll be providing school choice - so important - to every low-income child in 
America, and we’re going to be ending Common Core and bringing education local. 
We’re going to support the men and women of law enforcement. We’re going to 
save our second amendment, which is totally under siege, and we will be 
appointing justices to the United States supreme court who will uphold and 
defend the constitution of the United States.”

“Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as 
one people, under one god, saluting one American flag?”

Trump was greeted with a “U-S-A!” chant.

“I will not be voting for Clinton,” Steele told a dinner in honor of the 40th 
anniversary of the progressive magazineMother Jones in San Francisco Friday. “I 
will not be voting for Trump either.”

Steele, a former Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, said that Trump has 
“captured that racist underbelly, that frustration, that angry underbelly of 
American life and gave voice to that.”

“I was damn near puking during the debates,” Steele said, adding that he 
believes Trump only represents 30% of the Republican Party.

Khan, parents of slain Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in a suicide 
bombing attack in Iraq in 2004. One of the sharpest moments of widespread 
bipartisan revulsion at Donald Trump in the campaign came when Trump criticized 
the Khans for their appearance at the Democratic national convention to tell 
their son’s story. Khizr Khan offered Trump his pocket constitution, wondering 
whether he’d ever read it. Trump discounted their story and questioned why 
Ghazala Khan did not address the convention. The Khans are Muslim, as was their 
son.
 
At a rally in Cleveland this afternoon, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> began her remarks with a 
reprised joke from the previous night’s charity banquet.

“I have now spent 4.5 hours on stage with Donald proving once again I have the 
stamina to be president,” Clinton said, drawing laughs and cheers from the 
1,600 supporters who gathered a college gymnasium in Cleveland.

Directly behind Clinton, a woman wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the words: 
“Nasty Woman”. The phrase has become something of a feminist rallying cry ever 
since Trump leaned into his mic during the third and final debate on Wednesday 
and spit the words, intended as an insult.

Clinton also attacked Trump for his brazen admission that he would keep 
Americans “in suspense” about whether the Republican nominee will concede the 
election should he lose in November. At a Thursday rally, Trump said he would 
accept the legitimacy of the election results – if he won.

“Make no mistake,” Clinton told the crowd, “by doing that he is threatening 
our democracy.”

“Look, if you lose an election – I have lost an election – you don’t feel very 
good the next day,” Clinton continued. “But we know in our country the 
difference between leadership and dictatorship.”

Prior to the rally, Clinton met with two high-profile activists associated 
with the Black Lives Matter movement: Brittany Packnett and DeRay McKesson. 
Over the past 18 months on the trail, Clinton has been confronted by activists 
challenging her past support for drug policies that wrecked black communities.

Today, Clinton credited these honest and at turns frank conversations with 
activists and young leaders for helping to inform her policy agenda to reform 
the criminal justice system and improve relationships between the police and 
communities of color.

“All the advocates and activists who have challenged us to think about these 
issues of race and justice and equality and opportunity in new and powerful 
ways really deserve our appreciation,” Clinton said.

“I am going to do everything I can to lift these issues up because one of my 
hopes for my presidency will be to root out systemic racism and bigotry and 
discrimination in whatever form it takes.”
 
As if we needed more evidence that the political world has been turned 
upside-down,Buzzfeed News is reporting 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/the-clinton-campaign-is-making-a-play-for-utah?utm_term=.fnMj4jryLw#.piVM6MbpBY>
 that Hillary Clinton is making a late-game play for Utah - a state so red that 
it hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in more than half a 
century.

Seizing Donald Trump’s anemic support among the state’s largely Mormon 
population - Trump’s coarse rhetoric hasnever played well 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/21/utah-mormon-voters-anti-donald-trump-republican-caucuses>
 with Latter-Day Saints, nor has his pledge to ban followers of politically 
unpopular religions from entering the United States - the Clinton campaign is 
reportedly adding five paid staffers to the state’s office in Salt Lake City, 
and is adding financing to fund in-state advertisements and organization 
efforts.

Clinton, who in August published an op-ed in the Deseret News 
<http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865659843/Exclusive-Hillary-Clinton-What-I-have-in-common-with-Utah-leaders-2-religious-freedom-and-the.html?pg=all>
 emphasizing the importance of religious freedom, likely sees an opportunity in 
the form of insurgent third-party candidate Evan McMullin. McMullin, a former 
CIA officer, a devout Mormon and longtime Republican, has outpolled both 
Clinton and Trump in recent days, turning what would normally be a walk for 
Republican candidates into a three-way race for the state’s six electoral votes:

In a 2000 visit to the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, then-tycoon and 
future presidential nominee Donald Trump waxed about how “brilliantly” Adolf 
Hitler came to power in 1930s Germany, according to commentsunearthed by 
Buzzfeed News 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/nathanielmeyersohn/donald-trumps-trip-to-the-holocaust-museum?bftwnews&utm_term=.nfLXZXY2NR#.vqBeaelz5R>
:

In the 1930s, everyone thought that Adolf Hitler was a fringe element who 
could never come to power. And the Center shows this and how he came to power 
so brilliantly, but people thought, if you read history from the Twenties, you 
would say, ‘this could never have happened.’ And it did happen.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center is a Holocaust remembrance museum named after 
Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal.

Former Arizona governor Jan Brewer isn’t worried about the increasing signs 
that the long-red state may turn for Hillary Clinton in the upcoming general 
election,telling the Boston Globe

 that increased Latino turnout won’t affect the final results.

“Nah,” Brewer said, when asked about increased Latino turnout in response to 
Donald Trump’s candidacy. “They don’t get out and vote.’’

Alrighty then.
 
In a radio segment that aired this afternoon, actress Salma Hayek told a 
Spanish-language radio station that Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> attempted to date her while 
she was in a relationship and, after she rejected his advances, planted a story 
in the National Enquirer tabloid that she was too short for him to be 
interested in romantically.

Pinault. Photograph: Patrick Kovarik/AFP/Getty Images 
“When I met that man, I had a boyfriend, and he tried to become his friend to 
get my home telephone number,” Hayek said,according to a Buzzfeed News 
translation 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/salma-hayek-i-denied-trump-a-date-so-he-planted-a-national-e?utm_term=.kemqVqaNkE#.wkrQNQemkd>
 of the conversation. “He got my number and he would call me to invite me out.”


When she told Trump that she wouldn’t go out with him even if she were single, 
“someone told the National Enquirer,” Hayek said.

“I’m not going to say who, because you know that whatever he wants to come out 
comes out in the National Enquirer,” Hayek, who has endorsed Democratic 
presidential nomineeHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, continued. “It said that 
he wouldn’t go out with me because I was too short.”


“Later, he called and left me a message,” Hayek said. “‘Can you believe this? 
Who would say this? I don’t want people to think this about you.’ He thought 
that I would try to go out with him so people wouldn’t think that’s why he 
wouldn’t go out with me.”
 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s positions on Muslim immigration 
- that it should be halted until“our country’s representatives can figure out 
what’s going on” 
<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration>
 - prompted some Facebook employees to advocate that some of his postings on 
the social network should be deleted as hate speech, a report claims.

According to the Wall Street Journal 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-employees-pushed-to-remove-trump-posts-as-hate-speech-1477075392>
, the matter eventually hit the desk of Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg, who declared internally that it would be “inappropriate” for 
Facebook to censor the posts, even if they did meet the criteria for hate 
speech:

Issues around Mr. Trump’s posts emerged when he posted on Facebook a link to a 
Dec. 7 campaign statement “on preventing Muslim immigration.” The statement 
called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States 
until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.”

“When we review reports of content that may violate our policies, we take 
context into consideration,” a Facebook spokesperson told the Wall Street 
Journal’s report. “That context can include the value of political discourse. 
Many people are voicing opinions about this particular content and it has 
become an important part of the conversation around who the next US president 
will be. For those reasons, we are carefully reviewing each report and 
surrounding context relating to this content on a case by case basis.”

The Trump campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment on the 
matter.
 
Only half of likely Republican voters say that they will accept Hillary 
Clinton as their president if the former secretary of state wins in the 
upcoming general election,a new poll from Reuters/Ipsos showed 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-rigging-idUSKCN12L2O2>, 
indicating that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’scontinued 
baseless attacks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/citizens-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-roger-stone-rigged-election-claim>
 on the election as “rigged” has permeated his voters base.

Nearly 70% of Republican voters said that if Clinton wins, it will be due to 
illegal voting or vote rigging. The same percentage of Democrats, meanwhile, 
said that they would accept a Trump victory.

Nearly 80% of Republicans told Reuters that they are concerned about “the 
accuracy of the final vote count,” and only six in ten are confident that their 
votes will be tabulated accurately.

Trump counts himself as one of those who isn’t necessarily sure to support 
Clinton if she is indeed elected, winkingly telling viewers of the third 
presidential debate that “I will keep you in suspense” on whether he would 
concede the election to Clinton.
