Australia will unleash three debutants in the day-night Test against South 
Africa that starts on Thursday, with Jackson Bird edging Chadd Sayers to grab 
the final berth in the XI, while four Test players will have to switch formats 
before the first Test against Pakistan, having been included in the ODI squad 
for the upcoming series against New Zealand.

Steve Smith named his side for the third Test against the Proteas on 
Wednesday, confirming Bird will be recalled and batsmen Matt Renshaw, Peter 
Handscomb and Nic Maddinson will make their Test debuts. Not since 2011, when 
David Warner, Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson all received their baggy 
greens, has Australia blooded so many debutants in a Test.

“We’ve obviously made a lot of changes,” Smith said of the Test selections. 
“I’m happy with the team that I’ve got. This series has been disappointing the 
way it has gone for us but I’m actually really excited about the young guys 
coming into the group. I’ve almost felt a little shift over the last few days 
in attitude and energy from what the new guys have brought in.”

Australia, facing their first whitewash in a home Test series since 
federation, will have used a total of 19 players in the three-match series. 
South Africa recorded crushing victories in Perth and Hobart.

Earlier on Wednesday, Smith was named in the ODI squad along with Warner, 
Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Matthew Wade. Next month’s three-match series against 
New Zealand, sandwiched between the two three-Test series against South Africa 
and Pakistan, will deliver the latest reminder of the cramped cricket calendar.

Oft-injured paceman Pat Cummins will play his first international game for 
Australia in almost 15 months, while 24-year-old Zimbabwe-born allrounder 
Hilton Cartwright is set to make his ODI debut against the Black Caps.

But national selectors and Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> 
Australia high-performance manager Pat Howard have once again been pitched into 
an awkward juggling act ahead of the first Test against Pakistan, which starts 
on 15 December in Brisbane. Australia face their trans-Tasman rivals at home on 
4, 6 and 9 December. Those one-dayers clash with a Sheffield Shield round 
starting on 5 December. CA has noted a player from the 14-man ODI squad may be 
released to play the Shield round.

The advent of the Big Bash League means those three Shield games will be the 
final chance for Test hopefuls to impress in the whites before Australia face 
Pakistan in Tests at the Gabba, MCG and SCG. That list is headlined by axed 
allrounder Mitch Marsh, South Australia skipper Travis Head and Glenn Maxwell, 
who were all included in the 14-man ODI squad.

Maxwell was overlooked for Australia’s past two one-day tours, while 
allrounder James Faulkner is also back after missing the 5-0 series loss to 
South Africa because of a calf injury. Rounding out the squad are legspinner 
Adam Zampa, opener Aaron Finch and veteran batsman George Bailey. Captain Smith 
and coach Darren Lehmann have both expressed concerns about the helter-skelter 
schedule recently, while CA boss James Sutherland has declared he wants the 
national side to be playing less cricket.

Sutherland last year signed off on an agreement with New Zealand Cricket, 
which coincided with the deal for the inaugural day-night Test, to reinstate a 
regular Chappell-Hadlee series. The agreement was to stage six trans-Tasman ODI 
series in the space of four years, with New Zealand hosting four and Australia 
two. The second series in that deal is on the eve of Australia’s four-Test tour 
of India, complicating their preparations for that challenging assignment.

The schedule is something of a catch-22 for selectors. They were criticised 
for resting Starc and Hazlewood from the trip to South Africa in October, with 
Proteas skipper Faf du Plessis suggesting it was a mistake and gave his side a 
leg up for ensuing Test series.

Australia Test XI: David Warner, Matt Renshaw, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith 
(captain), Peter Handscomb, Nic Maddinson, Matthew Wade, Mitchell Starc, Josh 
Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon, Jackson Bird.
