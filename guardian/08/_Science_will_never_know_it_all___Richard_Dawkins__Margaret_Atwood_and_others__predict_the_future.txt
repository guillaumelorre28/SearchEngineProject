There’s a serious risk of climate catastrophe and it could be soon. Another 
alarmingly plausible possibility during the present century is that weapons of 
mass destruction, which are designed to deter, will be acquired by deluded 
people for whom deterrence has no meaning. Assuming we survive such manmade 
disasters, external peril may be averted by technology growing out of the 
brilliant feat of landing on a comet. The dinosaurs’ world ended when a comet 
or large meteorite unleashed titanic destructive forces. That will eventually 
happen again, and smaller but still dangerous strikes are a perennial danger in 
every century. Telescopes of the future will improve the range of detection, 
increase the warning time, and give engineers the notice they will need to 
intercept the bolide and nudge it into a harmless orbit.

In the world of science, DNA sequencing will become ever faster and cheaper 
and this will revolutionise medicine, taxonomy and my own field of evolution, 
not to mention forensic evidence in courts of law. Embryology and cell biology 
will advance mightily. Novel imaging techniques may enable palaeontologists and 
archeologists to see down into the ground without digging it up. The rendering 
of virtual reality will improve to the point where the distinction from 
external reality may become blurred. I expect unmanned space exploration to 
continue, albeit with economically imposed hiatuses. Out beyond 50 years, 
self-sustaining colonies may be established on Mars. Human travel to other star 
systems lies way beyond 50 years, but radio communication from extraterrestrial 
scientists is an ever-present possibility. However, the intervening light 
centuries will rule out conversation.

Will we still have a liveable planet 50 years from now? Kill the oceans and 
it’s game over for oxygen-breathing mid-range mammals – the oceans make 60 to 
80% of our oxygen. Superheating them and dumping them full of plastic may spell 
our doom. I hope that we’ll be smart enough to avoid this fate. From ideas 
proposed in my fiction, many are equally horrible, but it seems as if the use 
of the blood of young people to rejuvenate rich older people – as posited inThe 
Heart Goes Last 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/14/the-heart-goes-last-margaret-atwood-review>
 – is already in process. I do try to avoid predicting “the future” because 
there are so many variables; thus, so many possible futures. But here’s a safe 
bet: in 25 years I won’t be on the planet, unless of course I get my tentacles 
on some of that rejuvenating blood.

Oxford University and author ofWhat We Cannot Know 
<http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/are-we-at-the-limits-of-knowle-98802>

If I could communicate 100 years into the future and talk to the incumbent 
Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford 
(which I can confidently predict won’t be me, even if some scientists think 
that we are about to cure ageing), I wonder if he/she/it will know it all. Will 
we have answered all the big open questions of science? I think we’ll have 
understood what dark matter is and what is causing the accelerated expansion of 
the universe. But are there questions to which we’ll never know the answer, no 
matter how long we wait? Could we ever know if the universe is infinite? Can we 
find out what happened before the big bang? I predict that science will never 
know it all. It would be terrible if we did. Science is a living, breathing 
subject because of what we don’t know. But might there be things we’ll never 
know? That’s a bit more frightening for a scientist.

Within 10 years, cellphones are going to become our all – ID, passport, entry 
codes – inextricably linked to our identity with all our history carried around 
with us. Governments will be able to access it, and also use it to control us. 
Within 25 years, sex with robots or in virtual space will be normal, and in 
some cases preferred. Especially if the intelligence is designed to suit us, 
which will make us long for the era of hookup culture and Tinder dates when it 
was human connection, even if it wasn’t meaningful connection. We’ll travel in 
virtual reality to places of natural wonder, mostly because those places will 
be devastated by global warming and will then exist only in virtual reality, 
but also because air travel will have become even more unbearably hellish and 
no one will want to undertake it. I do hope we see more civil liberties 
globally. I’d like emancipation for all women 50 years from now, the freedom of 
choice and the information and education for everyone to live their lives as 
they see fit. And I think we can get there, mostly.

I think that the animal rights project will succeed in its mission to see some 
animals granted some of the rights of humans. But more generally, it’s tricky – 
there’s such a multitude of humans. I’m interested in the idea of victimless 
meat: growing meat in vats rather than rearing a whole sentient being just so 
we can eventually eat its muscles. So I predict that we’ll happily eat in-vitro 
meat in 10 years’ time and that within 50 years we’ll have found 
extraterrestrial species. I hope that evidence for intelligent life on other 
planets is found in my lifetime. I could die happy knowing such beings are out 
there!

My fears for the future are that we miss the opportunity to act as a cohesive 
global society to address the environmental challenges we face and end up in a 
situation in which a small population thrives but many struggle in poverty. My 
hope is that instead we face up to the crisis as a cooperative species and 
negotiate a way to share the world’s resources between ourselves and the 
natural world. I do predict, however, that in 50 years’ time the majority of 
our energy will be generated from carbon-free sources.

I worry a lot about the world we’re handing over to young people. I’m a youth 
worker so it’s on my mind a lot. My biggest fear is we’re handing over an 
unfixable world, one where lines in the sand have been drawn and the only way 
to undo all of this is for a revolution. Or for the west to no longer be a 
cultural leader. It’s damn sure on its way to not being an economic one. I 
don’t know what the future looks like. I try to be optimistic, because you have 
to be, especially when you have children. But I feel as if what has happened 
this year will have repercussions for the future that will outlive us all.

As a parent, I think that the greatest challenge is and will always be to 
serve as an interface between a child and a world that often makes very little 
sense. Technology may advance but human behaviour will stay unpredictable and 
often difficult to explain. I find the present tough enough to handle. When I’m 
done with sorting that, I’ll be ready to deal with the next challenge – but 
broadly speaking, things will get better, then worse and then better again.
