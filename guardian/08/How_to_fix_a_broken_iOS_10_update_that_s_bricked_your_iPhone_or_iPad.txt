Some users attempting to update to Apple’s latest iOS 10 on their iPhones and 
iPads havebeen left with inoperable devices 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/14/apples-ios-10-iphone-update-causes-issues-for-some-users>
. There is a fix, but it requires a real computer to do it. Here’s how.


The update might have sent the iPhone or iPad into a boot loop, left it stuck 
showing the Apple logo or in a similar so called “bricked” state. Depending on 
how far through the update process it got, you’ll be able to fix it fast using 
iTunes. Should it need a full restore, if you made a backup using iTunes it 
should be fairly fast; if not, you should do it in a place that has a solid 
Wi-Fi to restore your apps from iCloud, which might take some time if you have 
lots of them installed.

1. Find a computer – Windows PC or Mac – with the latest version of iTunes 
that supports iOS 10
2. Connect your iPhone or iPad to the computer
3. Open iTunes
4. Press and hold the Sleep and Home buttons on the iPhone or iPad until 
recovery mode starts and the screen shows a prompt to plug it into iTunes
5. Check iTunes for a prompt to either update or restore the iPhone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> or iPad
6. Select update to continue with the iOS 10 upgrade (restore will put you 
back on iOS 9)
7. Wait for the phone or tablet to update and continue setup on the device

Should steps above fail to recover your iPhone or iPad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad>, repeat the steps, putting the 
smartphone or tablet into recovery and then select restore rather than update.


If that doesn’t work, you may have to take a trip into an Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> store to get it fixed.

An Apple spokesperson said: “We experienced a brief issue with the software 
update process, affecting a small number of users during the first hour of 
availability. The problem was quickly resolved and we apologise to those 
customers. Anyone who was affected should connect to iTunes to complete the 
update or contact AppleCare for help.” It also pointed affected users to its
customer support page <https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204204>.
