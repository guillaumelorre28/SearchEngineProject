Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> campaigned head to head 
in North Carolina on Thursday, holding competing rallies only 30 miles apart in 
a state where polls show the Republican gaining on the Democrat five days 
before the presidential election.

North Carolina <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina> has a large 
and growing African American population and a growing number of young, white 
and college-educated voters, which means it has long figured in Clinton’s plan 
to win states where Barack Obama lost in 2012. On Thursday evening she tried to 
appeal to those voters in Raleigh, alongside her former rival, Bernie Sanders, 
and the singer Pharrell Williams.

The trio appeared before a raucous crowd of about 5,200 people at an outdoor 
amphitheater, where Sanders drew an especially strong response from the largely 
young crowd, who broke into chants of “Bernie”.

The Democratic nominee largely let her surrogates argue for her, underscoring 
the Vermont senator’s continued popularity among a demographic with which 
Clinton has struggled.

“This is not a personality contest,” Sanders implored voters. “We’re not 
voting for high school president. We’re voting for the most powerful leader in 
the world.”

Sanders told the crowd that Trump represented an unacceptable option, and that 
the “cornerstone” of his campaign was bigotry.

“We are not going back to a bigoted society,” Sanders said. “We’re not going 
to allow Trump or anyone else to divide us up.”
The senator’s remarks returned to familiar themes from his former stump 
speech, from addressing income inequality to reducing the amount of money in 
politics, in a bid to persuade supporters to cast their ballots for Clinton if 
they wished to see his agenda realized.

In contrast, Trump held an outdoor rally in the rural town of Selma in front 
of a crowd estimated at 17,000.

The Republican nominee, continuing to appeal to white conservative voters, 
emphasized his push for a more isolationist foreign policy in a state with a 
heavy military presence.

Trump vowed that he would only “engage in use of military forces when it is 
vital for national security interests of United States”, repeating his calls to 
avoid interventions abroad and to cooperate with regimes such as that of 
Vladimir Putin’s in Russia.

“We will stop trying to build foreign democracies, topple regimes and act 
recklessly to intervene in situations where we have no right to be there, 
folks,” he said, backed by a lineup of veterans, many who wore camouflage “Make 
America Great Again” hats. Trump, who avoided service in the Vietnam war on 
student and medical deferments, called the veterans “so much more brave than 
me”.

“I’m brave in other ways. I am financially brave,” he added.

The stops were the second North Carolina events in a day for both candidates, 
who are tied in the polls there according to averages.

Barack Obama stumped in the state

 on Wednesday for Clinton, and last week Clinton marked her first joint 
campaign appearance with first lady Michelle Obama in Winston-Salem. Trump is 
scheduled to make two more stops in North Carolina before the election, and 
running mate Mike Pence is scheduled to appear as well.

In Raleigh, Clinton told voters that the fabric of US society was at stake in 
the election. “Come January 20, America will have a new president. It will 
either be me or my opponent,” she said.


“The question is what kind of change are we going to see? Are we going to 
build a stronger, fairer, better America or are we going to fear each other and 
fear our future?”

Noting the disparaging comments Trump has made about women, disabled people, 
African Americans, Latinos and Muslims, Clinton borrowed a quote from the first 
lady: “The presidency doesn’t change who you are, it reveals who you are.”

“I think it’s fair to say that my opponent has already revealed who he is,” 
she added.


Trump meanwhile accused the Justice Department of interference in 
investigations into Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of 
state, adding yet another complaint of wrongdoing in the continuing 
controversy. The FBI, which began a new review of emails last week,has been 
riven by leaks and infighting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump>
 since director James Comey sent a letter to Congress notifying them that 
additional emails that may be pertinent had been found. Democrats and 
Republicans expressed surprise and confusion at his letter for its timing, and 
some Democratsaccused the bureau of seeking to interfere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails>
 with the election.

Outside Charlotte, Trump alleged that Clinton had “engaged in far reaching 
criminal conduct and equally far reaching criminal cover up”, although Comey’s 
July conclusion was that she had not committed intentional or criminal 
wrongdoing. Trump then later stated that she had committed “perjury”.

The political fallout from Comey’s letter appears to have helped Trump 
consolidate Republican voters and narrow the gap with Clinton, who had long 
held a steady lead over him. However, the Republican nominee still trails in 
crucial swing states like Pennsylvania and Nevada and faces a difficult 
electoral map.
