It’s very tense here at Taunton, where they’ve taken the extra half an hour. 
Warwickshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> have now lost 
Alex Mellor, Keith Barker and Jeetan Patel.

But a half-century partnership between Rikki Clarke and Chris Wright has 
frustrated theSomerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> bowlers. 
Warwickshire, having been 61 for eight, are now 123 for eight.

Somerset look to be on the verge of a famous win here. Warwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc>, chasing 184, have slumped 
to 34 for five.

Ian Westwood clipped Tim Groenewald straight to square-leg, Jonathan Trott was 
stumped as he stretched forward, Ian Bell was surprised by one that bounced 
more than he thought and was well caught by Trescothick at second slip, Sam 
Hailn was snaffled at leg-slip and just now Matthew Lamb has been bowled by 
Leach for one. Leach has three for three.

Context can be everything when it comes to Championship cricket, and so Nick 
Gubbins’ snail trail at Trent Bridge may well prove to be one of the innings of 
the season. A five-hour innings of 75 will hardly have had the crowd purring 
but from a position of 0-3 it has helped Division One leaders Middlesex back 
into the contest and put them in sight of Nottinghamshire’s 241. He was seventh 
out, two runs shy of a first batting point.

Here at Headingley, Keaton Jennings, the country’s leading run scorer, made 40 
before Steven Patterson’s persistence paid off - an outside edge snaffled by 
wicketkeeper Andrew Hodd to his left from the final ball of the fifth 
consecutive maiden.

The sun is shining, a crowd in excess of 2,500 is creating a decent 
atmosphere, and Scott Borthwick is to 50 once more.Durham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/durham> 138 for two.

The news at Taunton is that Somerset have been bowled out for 211 in the 
second innings, settingWarwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> a very plausible looking 
184 to win. They’re taking an early tea.

Dom Bess, the hero on the opening day, with six for 28 on his championship 
debut, played well again, this time with the bat, before getting a leading edge 
and skying to short midwicket. And last man Jack Leach had his middle stump 
knocked back by Patel, who finished with five for 86.

After lunch the match at Taunton has lurched in the direction of Warwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc>. And it has less to do with 
the suspicious looking pitch than some rather inept Somerset batting.

Trego had added one to his lunchtime score when he played around one and was 
lbw to Patel. Rodgers was bowled by an arm ball from Patel and it was 160 for 
six when Lewis Gregory, sweeping, was lbw, also to Patel.

At this point Ryan Davies hit a full toss from Poysden down the throat of 
Patel (there is only one Patel in the Warwickshire team despite the fact that 
he keeps cropping up) at deep midwicket. And when Roelof van der Merwe played a 
back-foot force with a crooked bat and played onSomerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> were 190 for eight, still just 162

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire>, and more particularly 
Jake Lehmann, are no doubt beginning to rue gifting Keaton Jennings, the 
leading run scorer in Division One, a life on nought. Brought forward by a 
typically challenging Ryan Sidebottom delivery that shaped away to take the 
outside edge, Jennings was spared when the ball flew into Lehmann’s midriff and 
out again.

Durham had only seven runs on the board at that stage and Ryan Sidebottom took 
it like he has taken every missed opportunity over 19 seasons in the 
first-class game - with a chunter or 10 on his way down to fine leg. Jennings 
is still there, unbeaten on 39, in aDurham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/durham> score of 96 for one. Mark Stoneman, 
Surrey-bound next month, was the one to depart, brilliantly caught at second 
slip by a diving Adam Lyth off Jack Brooks.

Trego the Illustrated Cricketer with his collection of tatoos, is just the 
sort of counter-attacking player who could putSomerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> in a good position at Taunton. He 
skipped down the wicket to loft Patel over long-on for six and he’s now just 
pulled Joshua Poysden for another maximum.

At the other end Rodgers has enjoyed some good fortune but shortly before 
lunch he hit Poysden through the off-side for four to reach his fifty. At the 
interval Somerset are 128 for three, with Rodgers on 53 and Trego 30. So they 
lead by 100.

Andrew Hodd sacrificed his wicket in Yorkshire’s quest for five batting points 
when he miscued off Barry McCarthy and spooned a catch to point, and despite 
requiring 16 runs from three overs, they fell short on 392 for seven.

Steve Patterson then followed, guiding one back into the timber via an 
elaborate attempted leave, but Jack Brooks and Rafiq have since ploughed on.
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are 435 for eight half 
an hour before lunch.

Nothing much happened at Taunton for 45 minutes. “The skippers will be shaking 
hands at five o’clock on Friday afternoon,” quipped someone, predicting a tame 
draw.

Then we had a couple of wickets. Marcus Trescothick, expecting a delivery from 
Jeetan Patel to turn wide of his off-stump, and playing with his bat behind his 
pad, was horrified to see the ball go straight on and crash into his wicket.

That was 70 for two and it was 75 for three when James Hildreth, who had 
scored just a single, received one from Chris Wright which jagged back into him 
and kept low. The lbw decision was inevitable.

The ECB liason officer (pitch inspector) Phil Whitticase is here. He hasn’t 
passed judgement yet but he will have noted that Peter Trego, attempting to 
sweep Patel, was struck in the face, while Chris Rodgers has been hit in the 
chest. Generally, though, the pitch has played OK today andSomerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> are 95 for three.

Early breakthrough for Chris Rushworth at Headingley, where Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> nevertheless remain in with a 
sniff of maximum batting points.

Tim Bresnan was the casualty - off-stump removed - yet Azeem Rafiq has taken 
to the task of upping the ante with a couple of clips for four through 
midwicket to leave Yorkshire 375 for six. They need 25 runs from four overs to 
get those five full points.

Welcome to Taunton and the remains of the Somerset versus Warwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> game. We saw 21 wickets 
tumble yesterday on a pitch as green as a college freshman, while both ends of 
the strip showed signs of terminal mange.

The surface, we have been told, had not been used since June, but it looked 
more worn than that on the first day.

The scores – Somerset 95, Warwickshire 123, Somerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> 41 for one – appear to belong to 
the distant days of uncovered pitches.

There was help for the seamers and decent assistance for the spinners from the 
very first ball. Having said that, this was not really a 21-wicket pitch. The 
ball swung under the clouds – Keith Barker, in particular, impressed – and 
there were some absurd strokes played. It will be interesting to hear what the 
ECB liason officer has to say today.

“Why didn’t the batsmen play straight?” the old Warwickshire and England 
biffer John Jameson – who also used to coach locally – asked me over breakfast 
this morning. “The straight boundaries are short, but they’re deep either side 
of the wicket.”

Elsewhere Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire>, on 341 for 
five, are powerfully placed against Durham, while championship rivals Middlesex 
are nine for three after being stunned by a Jake Ball hat-trick in their reply 
to Notts’ 241.

The match here has limped into a third day, with Warwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> 131 for eight, with still 
53 wanted. Clarke and Wright have put on 70. It’s been a top day.
 
It’s very tense here at Taunton, where they’ve taken the extra half an hour. 
Warwickshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> have now lost 
Alex Mellor, Keith Barker and Jeetan Patel.

But a half-century partnership between Rikki Clarke and Chris Wright has 
frustrated theSomerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> bowlers. 
Warwickshire, having been 61 for eight, are now 123 for eight.
 
Somerset look to be on the verge of a famous win here. Warwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc>, chasing 184, have slumped 
to 34 for five.

Ian Westwood clipped Tim Groenewald straight to square-leg, Jonathan Trott was 
stumped as he stretched forward, Ian Bell was surprised by one that bounced 
more than he thought and was well caught by Trescothick at second slip, Sam 
Hailn was snaffled at leg-slip and just now Matthew Lamb has been bowled by 
Leach for one. Leach has three for three.
 
Alex Wakely, his county captain, is unequivocal in his assessment of 
Northamptonshire talent Ben Duckett:
Alex Wakely (@AlexWakely1) 
Ben Duckett has to play for England ASAP. He is that good

Context can be everything when it comes to Championship cricket, and so Nick 
Gubbins’ snail trail at Trent Bridge may well prove to be one of the innings of 
the season. A five-hour innings of 75 will hardly have had the crowd purring 
but from a position of 0-3 it has helped Division One leaders Middlesex back 
into the contest and put them in sight of Nottinghamshire’s 241. He was seventh 
out, two runs shy of a first batting point.

Here at Headingley, Keaton Jennings, the country’s leading run scorer, made 40 
before Steven Patterson’s persistence paid off - an outside edge snaffled by 
wicketkeeper Andrew Hodd to his left from the final ball of the fifth 
consecutive maiden.

The sun is shining, a crowd in excess of 2,500 is creating a decent 
atmosphere, and Scott Borthwick is to 50 once more.Durham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/durham> 138 for two.
 
The news at Taunton is that Somerset have been bowled out for 211 in the 
second innings, settingWarwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> a very plausible looking 
184 to win. They’re taking an early tea.

Dom Bess, the hero on the opening day, with six for 28 on his championship 
debut, played well again, this time with the bat, before getting a leading edge 
and skying to short midwicket. And last man Jack Leach had his middle stump 
knocked back by Patel, who finished with five for 86.
 
After lunch the match at Taunton has lurched in the direction of Warwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc>. And it has less to do with 
the suspicious looking pitch than some rather inept Somerset batting.

Trego had added one to his lunchtime score when he played around one and was 
lbw to Patel. Rodgers was bowled by an arm ball from Patel and it was 160 for 
six when Lewis Gregory, sweeping, was lbw, also to Patel.

At this point Ryan Davies hit a full toss from Poysden down the throat of 
Patel (there is only one Patel in the Warwickshire team despite the fact that 
he keeps cropping up) at deep midwicket. And when Roelof van der Merwe played a 
back-foot force with a crooked bat and played onSomerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> were 190 for eight, still just 162 
ahead. Will we be here tomorrow?
 
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire>, and more particularly 
Jake Lehmann, are no doubt beginning to rue gifting Keaton Jennings, the 
leading run scorer in Division One, a life on nought. Brought forward by a 
typically challenging Ryan Sidebottom delivery that shaped away to take the 
outside edge, Jennings was spared when the ball flew into Lehmann’s midriff and 
out again.

Durham had only seven runs on the board at that stage and Ryan Sidebottom took 
it like he has taken every missed opportunity over 19 seasons in the 
first-class game - with a chunter or 10 on his way down to fine leg. Jennings 
is still there, unbeaten on 39, in aDurham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/durham> score of 96 for one. Mark Stoneman, 
Surrey-bound next month, was the one to depart, brilliantly caught at second 
slip by a diving Adam Lyth off Jack Brooks.
 
Trego the Illustrated Cricketer with his collection of tatoos, is just the 
sort of counter-attacking player who could putSomerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> in a good position at Taunton. He 
skipped down the wicket to loft Patel over long-on for six and he’s now just 
pulled Joshua Poysden for another maximum.

At the other end Rodgers has enjoyed some good fortune but shortly before 
lunch he hit Poysden through the off-side for four to reach his fifty. At the 
interval Somerset are 128 for three, with Rodgers on 53 and Trego 30. So they 
lead by 100.
 
Andrew Hodd sacrificed his wicket in Yorkshire’s quest for five batting points 
when he miscued off Barry McCarthy and spooned a catch to point, and despite 
requiring 16 runs from three overs, they fell short on 392 for seven.

Steve Patterson then followed, guiding one back into the timber via an 
elaborate attempted leave, but Jack Brooks and Rafiq have since ploughed on.
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are 435 for eight half 
an hour before lunch.
 
Nothing much happened at Taunton for 45 minutes. “The skippers will be shaking 
hands at five o’clock on Friday afternoon,” quipped someone, predicting a tame 
draw.

Then we had a couple of wickets. Marcus Trescothick, expecting a delivery from 
Jeetan Patel to turn wide of his off-stump, and playing with his bat behind his 
pad, was horrified to see the ball go straight on and crash into his wicket.

That was 70 for two and it was 75 for three when James Hildreth, who had 
scored just a single, received one from Chris Wright which jagged back into him 
and kept low. The lbw decision was inevitable.

The ECB liason officer (pitch inspector) Phil Whitticase is here. He hasn’t 
passed judgement yet but he will have noted that Peter Trego, attempting to 
sweep Patel, was struck in the face, while Chris Rodgers has been hit in the 
chest. Generally, though, the pitch has played OK today andSomerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> are 95 for three.
 
Early breakthrough for Chris Rushworth at Headingley, where Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> nevertheless remain in with a 
sniff of maximum batting points.

Tim Bresnan was the casualty - off-stump removed - yet Azeem Rafiq has taken 
to the task of upping the ante with a couple of clips for four through 
midwicket to leave Yorkshire 375 for six. They need 25 runs from four overs to 
get those five full points.
 
Welcome to Taunton and the remains of the Somerset versus Warwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> game. We saw 21 wickets 
tumble yesterday on a pitch as green as a college freshman, while both ends of 
the strip showed signs of terminal mange.

The surface, we have been told, had not been used since June, but it looked 
more worn than that on the first day.

The scores – Somerset 95, Warwickshire 123, Somerset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> 41 for one – appear to belong to 
the distant days of uncovered pitches.

There was help for the seamers and decent assistance for the spinners from the 
very first ball. Having said that, this was not really a 21-wicket pitch. The 
ball swung under the clouds – Keith Barker, in particular, impressed – and 
there were some absurd strokes played. It will be interesting to hear what the 
ECB liason officer has to say today.

“Why didn’t the batsmen play straight?” the old Warwickshire and England 
biffer John Jameson – who also used to coach locally – asked me over breakfast 
this morning. “The straight boundaries are short, but they’re deep either side 
of the wicket.”

Elsewhere Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire>, on 341 for 
five, are powerfully placed against Durham, while championship rivals Middlesex 
are nine for three after being stunned by a Jake Ball hat-trick in their reply 
to Notts’ 241.
