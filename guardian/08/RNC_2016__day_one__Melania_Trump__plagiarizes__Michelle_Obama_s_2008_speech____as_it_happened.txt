5.15am BST 05:15  <> 

The first day and night of the 2016 Republican national convention is 
complete. Here’s what we learned:

 * The program reached its dramatic climax with a splashy entrance 
<https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/755237027960848384> by Donald Trump, who 
emerged in a cloud of blue smoke to We Are the Champions by Queen. He said 
“we’re gonna win so big” and introduced his wife, Melania, the next speaker. 
 * There was a moment of major uncertainty on the arena floor in mid-afternoon 
when the presiding officer ignored and spoke over an attempt by delegates 
opposed to Trumpto derail 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/never-trump-republican-convention-roll-call-vote-rule-39>
 a rules adoption process. The movement failed. 
 * The failure of the Anybody but Trump movement complete, it appeared that no 
hurdle remained to Trump’s official nomination on Tuesday. 
 * Monday evening’s program was devoted to national security issues, which 
meant a movie about Benghazi and emotional testimonies by parents who had lost 
children to intoxicated drivers who turned out to be undocumented migrants. 
 * At times the hearty opposition of the arena crowd to illegal immigration 
seemed to tip over into an antipathy toward immigrants more broadly, and from 
there to foreigners or anything falling outside the tightly defined boundaries 
of “USA! USA!” a repeated chant. 
 * “The world outside our borders is a dark place, a scary place,” retired 
Navy Seal Michael Luttrell said to applause. “America is the light.”

 * Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani brought the crowd to its feet with some 
charged lines about race and policing. “When [police] come to save your life, 
they don’t ask if you’re black or white, they just come to save you!” he said. 
 * The program seemed to stretch later than expected, with Melania Trump 
speaking more than an hour before the end, and senator Joni Ernst delivering 
her headliner speech to an emptyish room. 
 * The crowd seemed charmed by Melania, clapping enthusiastically at her 
heavily accented descriptions of how much her husband loves America. But it was 
revealed that she had borrowed lines verbatim from the speech Michelle Obama 
gave to the 2008 convention. (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) 
Melania Trump plagiarized Michelle Obama tonight, and here's the video to

<https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/755251813989904384> 
 * The day began with the Trump campaign disparaging non-attendees. Trump 
campaign chairman Paul Manafort said the Bushes were “part of the past” and 
said Ohio governor John Kasich was “embarrassing his state” by not 
participating in the convention. 
 * Cleveland police reported that two protests of 450-500 people concluded 
“peacefully” and there was just one arrest Monday for misdemeanor obstruction 
and resisting arrest.

That’s it for tonight. See you back here bright and early tomorrow. Thanks for 
all the comments.

Melania Trump borrows lines from Michelle Obama

A number of lines in the robustly applauded speech delivered by Melania Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/melania-trump> at the Republican national 
convention on Monday night appear to have been lifted verbatim from a speech 
Michelle Obama delivered at the 2008 Democratic convention.

Journalist Jarrett Hill 
<https://twitter.com/JarrettHill/status/755242423991709697> was among the first 
to point out that lines Donald Trump’s wife spoke about the necessity of hard 
work and strong family values seemed familiar.

“Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values, that you work hard 
for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say 
you’re going to do,” Obama told the gathering of Democrats in 2008.


“From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard 
for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say 
you’re going to do,” Trump said in 2016.

The resemblances in the speeches go further, as illustrated in the video 
mashup below:

Now Reince Priebus is back out. He recognizes delegate Christine Brooks from 
DC. She makes a motion that the convention adjourns.

The resolution is adopted by voice vote, although a few stalwarts shout “no,” 
apparently wanting to stay all night.

Priebus strikes the gavel in a one-down, three-to-go kind of way.

It’s a wrap. We’re hearing a loud Sweet Caroline cover.

Zinke wraps up. “Montana, I love ya!” he says. California continues to chant 
USA! USA! It’s unclear what’s supposed to happen now. The people left onstage 
leave it, after a pause.

Now they should probably just turn the lights off. But there’s a pause. 
Nothing is happening. Is it over?

No, Paula White, senior pastor of New Destiny Christian center in Florida, 
takes the stage to pray.

Jason Beardsley, former master sergeant with the US special forces, becomes 
the next speaker not to be the last speaker.

“It’s time for us, once again, to choose freedom over tyranny,” he says. 

The Iowa delegation has sat back down, except for two guys. Three delegates 
from West Virginia remain, unless those are other people taking a break in the

Ernst’s speech is painfully echo-y because the Q arena is so increasingly 
empty. She is soldiering on. The Iowa delegation is standing at attention, 
almost literally, and dutifully applauding each applause line.

“Donald Trump will not hesitate to call radical Islamic terrorism by its 
name.” She becomes the fifteenth person to make the charge.

Now they bring out about ten chairs. The last speakers are joined onstage by 
military veterans.

The delegates are streaming out. Those California folks are having a great 
time and sticking around, though. Maybe because they’re on Pacific time and 
simply not tired?

Here’s a pic of the empty seats:

Senator Ernst begins, addressing, extremely optimistically at this hour, 
“millions of my fellow Americans watching around the country.”

Flynn is reacting to the crowd chanting “Lock her up! lock her up!” 

“You know why we’re saying that?” he says. “If I did a tenth of what she did, 
I would be in jail today.”

Then he says, “Crooked Hillary Clinton, leave this race now” and is finally 
applauded.

He says something about the country being founded on Judeo-Christian values 
and being the greatest country in the history of the world. “Now is the time to 
elect fresh, bold leadership.

“We are just beginning,” Flynn says. Is Joni Ernst backstage cursing him? 
There are fewer and fewer spectators waiting around for her.

The first day and night of the 2016 Republican national convention is 
complete. Here’s what we learned:

 * The program reached its dramatic climax with a splashy entrance 
<https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/755237027960848384> by Donald Trump, who 
emerged in a cloud of blue smoke to We Are the Champions by Queen. He said 
“we’re gonna win so big” and introduced his wife, Melania, the next speaker. 
 * There was a moment of major uncertainty on the arena floor in mid-afternoon 
when the presiding officer ignored and spoke over an attempt by delegates 
opposed to Trumpto derail 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/never-trump-republican-convention-roll-call-vote-rule-39>
 a rules adoption process. The movement failed. 
 * The failure of the Anybody but Trump movement complete, it appeared that no 
hurdle remained to Trump’s official nomination on Tuesday. 
 * Monday evening’s program was devoted to national security issues, which 
meant a movie about Benghazi and emotional testimonies by parents who had lost 
children to intoxicated drivers who turned out to be undocumented migrants. 
 * At times the hearty opposition of the arena crowd to illegal immigration 
seemed to tip over into an antipathy toward immigrants more broadly, and from 
there to foreigners or anything falling outside the tightly defined boundaries 
of “USA! USA!” a repeated chant. 
 * “The world outside our borders is a dark place, a scary place,” retired 
Navy Seal Michael Luttrell said to applause. “America is the light.”

 * Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani brought the crowd to its feet with some 
charged lines about race and policing. “When [police] come to save your life, 
they don’t ask if you’re black or white, they just come to save you!” he said. 
 * The program seemed to stretch later than expected, with Melania Trump 
speaking more than an hour before the end, and senator Joni Ernst delivering 
her headliner speech to an emptyish room. 
 * The crowd seemed charmed by Melania, clapping enthusiastically at her 
heavily accented descriptions of how much her husband loves America. But it was 
revealed that she had borrowed lines verbatim from the speech Michelle Obama 
gave to the 2008 convention. (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg)

<https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/755251813989904384> 
 * The day began with the Trump campaign disparaging non-attendees. Trump 
campaign chairman Paul Manafort said the Bushes were “part of the past” and 
said Ohio governor John Kasich was “embarrassing his state” by not 
participating in the convention. 
 * Cleveland police reported that two protests of 450-500 people concluded 
“peacefully” and there was just one arrest Monday for misdemeanor obstruction 
and resisting arrest.

That’s it for tonight. See you back here bright and early tomorrow. Thanks for 
all the comments.
 
A number of lines in the robustly applauded speech delivered by Melania Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/melania-trump> at the Republican national 
convention on Monday night appear to have been lifted verbatim from a speech 
Michelle Obama delivered at the 2008 Democratic convention.

Journalist Jarrett Hill 
<https://twitter.com/JarrettHill/status/755242423991709697> was among the first 
to point out that lines Donald Trump’s wife spoke about the necessity of hard 
work and strong family values seemed familiar.

“Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values, that you work hard 
for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say 
you’re going to do,” Obama told the gathering of Democrats in 2008.


“From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard 
for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say 
you’re going to do,” Trump said in 2016.

The resemblances in the speeches go further, as illustrated in the video 
mashup below:

Now Reince Priebus is back out. He recognizes delegate Christine Brooks from 
DC. She makes a motion that the convention adjourns.

The resolution is adopted by voice vote, although a few stalwarts shout “no,” 
apparently wanting to stay all night.

Priebus strikes the gavel in a one-down, three-to-go kind of way.

It’s a wrap. We’re hearing a loud Sweet Caroline cover. 

 
Zinke wraps up. “Montana, I love ya!” he says. California continues to chant 
USA! USA! It’s unclear what’s supposed to happen now. The people left onstage 
leave it, after a pause.

Now they should probably just turn the lights off. But there’s a pause. 
Nothing is happening. Is it over?

No, Paula White, senior pastor of New Destiny Christian center in Florida, 
takes the stage to pray.
 
Up next is Representative Ryan Zinke, for whom the room is even emptier than 
it was here:

Jason Beardsley, former master sergeant with the US special forces, becomes 
the next speaker not to be the last speaker.

“It’s time for us, once again, to choose freedom over tyranny,” he says. 

The Iowa delegation has sat back down, except for two guys. Three delegates 
from West Virginia remain, unless those are other people taking a break in the 
West Virginia chairs.
 
Ernst’s speech is painfully echo-y because the Q arena is so increasingly 
empty. She is soldiering on. The Iowa delegation is standing at attention, 
almost literally, and dutifully applauding each applause line.

“Donald Trump will not hesitate to call radical Islamic terrorism by its 
name.” She becomes the fifteenth person to make the charge.
 
Now they bring out about ten chairs. The last speakers are joined onstage by 
military veterans.

The delegates are streaming out. Those California folks are having a great 
time and sticking around, though. Maybe because they’re on Pacific time and 
simply not tired?

Here’s a pic of the empty seats:

Senator Ernst begins, addressing, extremely optimistically at this hour, 
“millions of my fellow Americans watching around the country.”
 
Flynn began speaking right when Melania left stage. Now she’s long gone. And 
he’s stiiiill talking. Even the media is leaving, some of them.

And they're out: Donald and Melania's motorcade just zipped by.

Flynn is reacting to the crowd chanting “Lock her up! lock her up!” 

“You know why we’re saying that?” he says. “If I did a tenth of what she did, 
I would be in jail today.”

Then he says, “Crooked Hillary Clinton, leave this race now” and is finally 
applauded.

He says something about the country being founded on Judeo-Christian values 
and being the greatest country in the history of the world. “Now is the time to 
elect fresh, bold leadership.

“We are just beginning,” Flynn says. Is Joni Ernst backstage cursing him? 
There are fewer and fewer spectators waiting around for her.
