The appalling working conditions in the factories of China producing the 
iPhone are mirrored in the African mines where major phone manufacturers source 
their minerals (Your new iPhone features include oppression, inequality – and 
vast profit, 19 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/your-new-iphone-features-oppression-inequality-vast-profit>
). In the Democratic Republic of Congo workers toil for 12 hours a day with 
their bare hands to harvest coltan, a mineral used in smartphones and other 
consumer electronics. The miners who use picks and shovels to extract coltan in 
the sweltering heat are typically paid $5 a day, just above the minimum wage in 
the DRC of $3 a day. Many of the mines use illegal child labour and are 
controlled by militias who have used them to fund years of conflict in the 
country.

But there is a more ethical alternative to the major brands. The Fairphone is 
produced in a factory that ensures health and safety, as well as decent wages. 
It is also made with conflict-free minerals, which is a key starting point in 
avoiding some of the worst abuses of workers. Fairphone has been conceived and 
produced by a social enterprise which has worked hard to deliver transparency 
in both its production and supply chain. As a customer-owned co-operative, we 
are proud to work with Fairphone and be part of a movement working to improve 
conditions in the supply chain for mobile phones.

• News that the government is considering a crackdown on white-collar crime, 
including fraud, money laundering and false accounting, is welcome (Management 
could be prosecuted for failure to prevent fraud by staff, 12 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/12/prosecution-failure-prevent-fraud-by-staff-white-collar-crime>
). But we need to recognise that these economic crimes are often closely linked 
with other corporate crimes, stemming from the same management failures. 
Traidcraft has uncovered evidence of a small number of irresponsible British 
companies getting away with serious crimes including causing deaths, serious 
injuries and widespread pollution through their operations in developing 
countries. If the prime minister is to fulfil her pledge to “get tough on 
irresponsible behaviour by big business”, the government must take steps to 
address both economic and wider corporate crime.

• I was horrified to read that Mark Carney had advocated children spending all 
the UK’s money on Cadbury’s Dairy Milk chocolate (Report, 17 September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/mark-carnage-carney-fields-questions-from-coventry-school-children>
). Is he not aware that Cadbury’s paid no corporation tax last year and 
precious little for several years before that? The Methodist Tax Justice 
Network believes tax dodging is sinful, and has called for a boycott of 
Cadbury’s until they pay their share.
