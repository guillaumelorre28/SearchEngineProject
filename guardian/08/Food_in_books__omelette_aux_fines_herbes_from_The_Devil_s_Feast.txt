The Devil’s Feast, M. J. Carter

---

When I first arrived in the UK, I spent a year interning: stuffing tickets 
into envelopes, formatting scripts, hunting down obscure props, and researching 
everything from translations of Shakespeare throughout Europe, to the contact 
details of every youth theatre company in England. At night, I was tutoring a 
family in west London, and would then head home to write lesson plans for the 
next day. By September 2010, I was completely worn out, and had started to make 
plans to move back to Australia if I couldn’t find paid work in the theatre. 
But, to my immense joy, a few weeks before my self-imposed/rent-imposed 
deadline, I was offered a job at the National Youth Theatre.

That first week is such a blur to me now, but I remember attending the Gala 
Night of Relish, a play about Victorian chef Alexis Soyer. I remember the girl 
who played Queen Victoria, dressed in a full skirt made from colanders and 
spoons. I remember being cheerfully scolded by Ian McKellen, who was auctioning 
off a painting I was holding (I was completely starstruck and could not manage 
to hold the frame straight). And I remember Alexis Soyer. I have thought of him 
often since.

If you wrote him as a character, your audience wouldn’t believe him for a 
moment. A gifted chef, he was born and trained in France before moving to 
England in 1830. He became one of the first ‘celebrity chefs’ in London. He was 
thechef de cuisine at the Reform Club for 13 years; some of his dishes are 
still on the menu. He revolutionised the kitchens during his time there, 
introducing gas hobs, ovens with adjustable temperatures and refrigeration. 
Outside of the kitchen, he wrote books, developed menus for and worked in soup 
kitchens during the Irish famine, worked with Florence Nightingale to improve 
cooking in military hospitals, and invented a simple cooking stove used by all 
British soldiers from the Crimean War into the 1980s. He is unquestionably an 
extraordinary character.

The Devil’s Feast is set in his Reform Club kitchens, following some 
unexplained deaths at the club. Soyer has a central role, alongside Carter’s 
detecting double-act, Blake and Avery. The food in the book is truly 
extraordinary: spiced lobster in crispvol-au-vents, tiny tarts filled with 
almond cream and a dark, brandy-soaked cherry, celery with bone marrow.

In a more ambitious mood, I may have undertaken the challenge of the enormous 
sponge cake made to look like a roast beef with all the trimmings, or the 
terrine with quail and chicken. But this scene in the book is the first where 
Soyer is observed as he cooks and the description was so perfect that, this 
week, it had to be this omelette. You can make this, as Soyer does in the book, 
for a crowd, slicing it up into pieces and serving it with salad and bread. But 
I find it easier to control when it’s made with fewer eggs - I’m much less 
likely to over- or undercook it. So I’d suggest making smaller ones, and giving 
each person their own.

I have had, in my life, more omelettes than I can count. Filled with cheese, 
with spring onions, with sun-dried tomatoes, with salmon, with ham. I have 
patiently pulled ribbons of egg into the centre of the pan, twirling it around 
over a low heat so that the gaps fill with raw eggs. I have flipped and folded, 
and added copious amounts of butter. Nothing has ever lived up to this sort of 
omelette, the kind made in less than a minute, that still oozes inside.

Omelette aux fines herbes

Serves 1 

Ingredients 
3 medium eggs 
Pinch of salt and pepper 
1 tbsp single cream 
1/2 tsp chopped chives 
1/2 tsp chopped tarragon 
1/2 tsp chopped chervil 
1/2 tsp chopped parsley 
1 tbsp unsalted butter

Equipment 
Knife and chopping board
 Small mixing bowl 
Fork 
Omelette pan or non-stick frying pan 
Rubber spatula (if a fork will scratch your pan)

1. Crack the eggs into the bowl and give them a really good whisk with a fork, 
until there are no remaining streaks of yolk or white. Add the cream and whisk 
again. Season with salt and pepper.

2. Place your chopped herbs, your bowl of egg, your fork (or spatula), and a 
plate you want to serve your omelette on close to the hob. This will all be 
over in a matter of seconds, and you don’t want to be dashing around trying to 
find anything.

3. Place your pan over a high heat, and melt the butter in it. Swirl the 
butter around so that the pan is well-greased, but don’t let it brown. Tip the 
eggs in and leave them for a couple of seconds. Then take hold of the handle 
and start moving the pan around vigorously on the hob, as you scrape the 
setting egg from the pan and break up the curds. Keep the pan moving and the 
fork or spatula stirring quickly, until the bottom layer of egg start to look 
set, but the top is still liquid. Sprinkle the herbs over the top.

4. Still over the heat, tip your pan at a 45 degree angle, allowing most of 
the omelette to slip down to one edge. Fold the the thin layer of set egg that 
is left in the top half of the pan over the bulk of the omelette in the bottom 
half. Turn the heat off.

5. Grasp your pan handle in your dominant hand, with your thumb on top of the 
handle and palm below. Hold your plate in the other hand, almost vertically, 
then bring the pan up to meet it. Tip the omelette onto the plate - the set 
underside will become the top.
