A recent report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation 
<https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/we-can-solve-poverty-uk> (JRF) seeks to imagine 
a future without poverty in the UK, highlighting what needs to be done to make 
poverty history by 2030 (without invoking the ghost of bad Christmas singles).

Unsurprisingly, housing is prominent; as well as homelessness, insecure 
housing and problems accessing housing services, the report points out that the 
high cost of housing and childcare is an insurmountable obstacle for many 
people wishing to escape poverty. The organisation goes on to suggest a number 
of ways in which poverty rates could be lowered through housing policy.

£78bn of public spending is linked to dealing with poverty and its consequences

 * Boost the supply of genuinely affordable housing. 
 * Enable young people leaving care to maximise their potential, with proper 
support on housing, employment and training. 
 * Unfreeze working-age benefit levels and increase them in line with rises in 
the cost of essentials such as food, clothing and housing. 
 * Benefits should also account for the extra costs faced by those with a 
disability, longstanding illness or a mental health condition, including those 
associated with housing. 
While it is clear that improvements to the labour and housing markets alone 
will not guarantee shared prosperity for all, the report also warns the rise in 
evictions is increasing poverty: “High rents and evictions from private 
tenancies are a major driver of homelessness in some areas. Increasing the 
supply of genuinely affordable housing to bring down costs across tenures has 
become central to solving poverty in much of the UK.”

In numbers

 * 13 million people in the UK are living in poverty. 
 * £78bn of public spending is linked to dealing with poverty and its 
consequences. 
 * Income poverty among pensioners fell from 40% to 13% in the past 25 years. 
 * Child poverty rates has remained high, at 29% in the same period. 
 * Poverty among working-age adults without dependent children has risen from 
14% to around 20% since 1991. 
The geography of poverty

The evidence suggests that the geography of poverty must be addressed in any 
strategy to tackle it. Some places have been hit badly by de-industrialisation, 
as the collapse of steel in Redcar and worries over Port Talbot show.

The 2008 financial crash hit many of these areas particularly hard, as new 
jobs were created in the south-east and there were few to replace those lost 
elsewhere. These areas often also face poor digital and transport connectivity, 
reduced services, and environmental problems. Low housing supply and high costs 
are also driving up poverty in other parts of the country, such as Oxford and 
the south-east. To combat this, the report says authorities must:

 * Support communities to create solutions led locally. 
 * Set a clear vision at national, regional and local levels, coordinated 
across sectors. 
 * Engage big businesses and spenders in their areas to use their purchasing 
power and networks to engage local businesses and neighbourhoods, driving up 
growth. 
Genuinely affordable housing

Many of the report’s recommendations focus on increasing supply and changing 
planning policy around affordable housing, rather than aiding the market, 
including:

 * Meet the need for affordable housing in England by refocusing existing 
capital investment in housing and by spending an additional £1.1bn a year up to 
2020. At least half of the supply should have rents linked to low earnings in 
an area. 
 * Enable local areas to take a more flexible approach, such as swapping land 
plots, when using greenbelt sites for affordable housing developments. 
 * Reform planning powers to ease the assembly of land for development, and 
allow local authorities to borrow against projected future tax revenues to fund 
infrastructure development. 
 * Ensure right to buy contributes to reducing poverty by requiring sales to 
be replaced on a like-for-like basis where feasible. Greater local discretion 
over the size of the discount and eligibility would help this.

Possible solutions

 The report says social housing providers and local authorities could increase 
stability and security for people in poverty by:

 * Offering stable tenancies across the social and private rented sectors. 
 * Working with local authorities to offer housing to homeless individuals, 
and promote a Housing First programme. 
 * Helping tenants whose circumstances change to switch their tenure status, 
eg from home ownership to shared ownership or renting. 
 * Ensuring any proposals to regenerate estates involve existing residents, 
and link to wider economic development strategies.

The Housing <https://www.theguardian.com/society/housing> First programme, 
which supports homeless people and which is popular in Denmark and piloted in 
parts of England, can be particularly effective. The report says an impressive 
90% of those supported by the programme globally have been kept off the streets.
