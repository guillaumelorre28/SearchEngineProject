Phablet 
Apple iPhone 7 Plus, £719 <http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-7>

Aside from the vast, bright 5.5in screen, this device’s advantage over a 
regular iPhone 7 is the two lenses on its main camera, which enable 
professional-looking “bokeh” depth-of-field effects. No headphone jack but it 
is waterproof – which should avoid some insurance claims.
