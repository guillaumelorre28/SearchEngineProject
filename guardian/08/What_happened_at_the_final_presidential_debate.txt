<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result>
 the election result.“I will look at it at the time,” Trump said. “I will tell 
you at the time. I’ll keep you in suspense.” 
 * “That’s horrifying,” Hillary Clinton replied. “It just shows, you’re not up 
to doing the job. He is denigrating, he is talking down our democracy, and I 
for one am appalled.”

 * At least three Republican senators, among many alarmed voices, immediately 
objected to the Trump line, with Arizona’s Jeff Flakecalling the remarks 
<https://twitter.com/JeffFlake/status/788930879615737856> “beyond the pale”. 
 * The debate was surprisingly policy-oriented, with the candidates staking 
out contrasting positions on abortion, gun laws, Russia and much more. Trump 
allowed that his supreme court would probably overturn Roe v Wade. 
 * Trump rejected questions about women who have accused him of sexual 
assault, branding them fame-seekers and Clinton campaign plants and saying “I 
don’t know those people.” Jill Harth (@jillharth)

<https://twitter.com/guardian> Trump lied and lied again. He says he doesn't 
know any of the women. Well, he definitely knew me. I told the truth

 – he denies responsibility and refuses apology. 
 * “Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,” Clinton said. “I don’t 
think there’s a woman out there who doesn’t know what that feels like.” 
 * Trump interrupted a Clinton answer about social security by muttering, 
“Such a nasty woman.”His favorite interruption was “wrong”. “Wrong.”

 * Clinton turned a question about her emails released by WikiLeaks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-paid-wall-street-speeches>

She called Trump Putin’s “puppet”. 
 * Trump said the only reason Iraq was going into Mosul was because Clinton 
was running for president: “She wanted to look tough.” Clinton said he was 
trapped in conspiratorial thinking. Facebook

For the first time, the madness of Trump's ideas rather than the madness of 
his manner are taking centre stage at tonight's debate.
