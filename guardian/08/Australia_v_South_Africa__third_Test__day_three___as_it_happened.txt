Stumps on day three - South Africa 194-6 lead Australia by 70

Jonathan Howcroft

The third session was always going to shape the narrative of the day, and so 
it proved with Australia jagging four wickets, two at the death, to take a 
commanding position into day four.

All four bowlers performed admirably with Nathan Lyon finally showing the kind 
of form that means he’s now the third most prolific spinner in Australian Test 
history. Mitchell Starc provided the shock factor, Josh Hazlewood forced South 
Africa to play at everything, and Jackson Bird was an excellent foil in a 
series of bowling partnerships.


For the visitors there was only one redeeming story, Stephen Cook’s unbeaten 
81. The opener never looked settled or graceful at the crease, but he battled 
hard, stuck to his task, and he’s given his side a glimmer of hope. He, and 
Quinton de Kock will need to push their lead from 70 to over 150 if a series 
sweep is to be completed. Right now, Australia are heavy favourites to salvage 
the victory their changing of the guard demanded.

We’ll be back to do this all again tomorrow, for how long remains to be seen.

69th over: South Africa 194-6 (Cook 81, De Kock 0)

De Kock has to come out after all and he gets three beauties that drift and 
rip and spit that he can’t get anywhere near.

WICKET! Abbott LBW Lyon 0 (South Africa 194-6)

The pressure ramps up on the nightwatchman with men crowding around the bat 
and the tailender can’t handle Lyon’s off-spinner from around the wicket, 
playing all around one that hits his pad in front of leg stump. Australia 
rampant now.

68th over: South Africa 194-5 (Cook 81, Abbott 0)

Starc continues his marathon spell, but Cook’s up to the task, nudging a pair 
of twos and evading some serious heat from the paceman. Starc’s really given 
his all for his captain this session.

67th over: South Africa 190-5 (Cook 74, Abbott 0)

Kyle Abbott is the nightwatchman and he sees out the over. 

Proper brain fade from Bavuma who not only threw his wicket away but burned 
the last review open to his side with a dreadful call to confirm he both edged 
and gloved Lyon’s delivery.
Russell Jackson (@rustyjacko) 
There's a reason Lyon has 200 Test wickets more than everyone else they want 
to replace him with.

WICKET! Bavuma c Smith b Lyon 21 (South Africa 190-5)

Lyon has done it! But what was Bavuma thinking? He goes for a big sweep with 
four overs remaining, edges it onto his gloves and the ball loops up over Wade 
but Smith has anticipated well to run around and take a smart catch. the game 
tilts further Australia’s way.

66th over: South Africa 187-4 (Cook 74, Bavuma 21)

Starc into the sixth over of his spell, encouraged to stay on an over longer 
than planned perhaps thanks to Bavuma’s aggression in the previous over? No 
further breakthroughs as the day nears its close.

South Africa lead by 63.

65th over: South Africa 183-4 (Cook 73, Bavuma 18)

Lyon recalled to bowl his offies to the right-handed pair from around the 
wicket. The return of spin also means the return of Matthew Wade inches from 
the stump microphone and his booming calls of “Nice Garry!” from every 
delivery, regardless of how nice it actually was. Matthew Wade, the 
wicketkeeper the post-truth era deserves.

64th over: South Africa 181-4 (Cook 72, Bavuma 17)

Bavuma takes a fancy to Starc all of a sudden, square driving uppishly for 
four, and then playing and missing an expansive uppercut. He blocks the third 
delivery but then attempts a full blooded hook at a short one that he top edges 
onto his helmet and over the slips. The fifth is another mistimed pulled 
boundary over the cordon! What an odd over, but great entertainment.

63rd over: South Africa 169-4 (Cook 72, Bavuma 5)

Bird continues to toil but despite maintaining a decent line and length he 
doesn’t look as though he’s going to force a mistake through his own 
brilliance. He’s relying on the ball misbehaving or a false stroke.

Highlight of the over, umpire Kettleborough, the all-seeing eye, calling the 
tightest of no-balls. He is the best in the business.

Seven overs remaining tonight. 
Dan Liebke (@LiebCricket) 
Warner should go off the field for fifteen minutes and see if he can trick Faf 
into declaring. Yes, it might backfire but it's worth a try.

62nd over: South Africa 168-4 (Cook 72, Bavuma 5)

Cook squirts another couple of runs at the less graceful end of the 
Gower-Martin scale of cricketing attractiveness. He really doesn’t look a match 
for the rapid, muscular Starc but it’s terrific fun that he’s hanging on in 
there. Bavuma matches Cook’s two with a much more appealing shot, leaning into 
a cover drive with the form of a man with a tight core.

61st over: South Africa 163-4 (Cook 69, Bavuma 3)

The field has come in much closer and tighter but somehow Cook pierces it with 
a waft just to the left of gully. 175 balls Cook’s been at the crease now, and 
he hasn’t looked ‘in’ for any of them.

60th over: South Africa 156-4 (Cook 64, Bavuma 1)

Starc just gave Bavuma a stare that made him look the spitting image of Basil 
Fawlty. With that charity moustache Starc’s tall angular frame is reminiscent 
of John Cleese, and he looked at the batsman like Fawlty did at Manuel, ‘tache 
bristling, murmuring something unrepeatable. Maiden over.

59th over: South Africa 155-4 (Cook 64, Bavuma 0)

Bird has adjusted to a Hazlewood line and length and it has Cook fencing 
airily, but a return to a straighter line allows the strike to be rotated. The 
pressure has been relentless from all four Australian bowlers since Dinner, 
ramming home their significant first-innings advantage.

58th over: South Africa 154-4 (Cook 64, Bavuma 0)

With a lead of just 30, you fancy South Africa’s chances of salvaging anything 
from this Test disappeared off the Adelaide Oval turf with their skipper. Du 
Plessis a little late to his shot courtesy of Starc’s extra pace, and it was a 
ripping catch from the debutant.

Predictably, Starc now looks unplayable to the new batsman with Bavuma fending 
without guile at a couple that suddenly look to be dancing off the increasingly 
dewy surface.

WICKET! du Plessis c Handscomb b Starc 12 (South Africa 154-4)

Huge moment in the match as du Plessis goes cheaply. He drives at a wide Starc 
half-volley but he can only thick edge it to a diving Handscomb in the gully.

57th over: South Africa 154-3 (Cook 64, du Plessis 12)

Bird targeting the stumps of Cook, drawing the familiar refrain around the 
oval of “lucky he hit that,” my personal favourite waste of the English 
language in a game where the bloke in question is charged with doing just that.

56th over: South Africa 152-3 (Cook 62, du Plessis 12)

Starc returns to the attack to see if his extra pace can unsettle a pair of 
compact right-handers who aren’t looking to unfurl their full range of shots. A 
waiting game this for South Africa who know they can’t afford to lose any more 
wickets under the floodlights.

Du Plessis has his game face on and he’s able to ignore five deliveries but 
still capitalise on the sixth and dispatch an effortless boundary.

55th over: South Africa 148-3 (Cook 62, du Plessis 8)

The players return after drinks with the floodlights now in full effect and 
the sunset a preposterously beautiful indigo. A whole heap of superlatives are 
showered on this venue, and they’re all justified.

Back to the cricket and Cook milks a leg-side four off Bird to keep the 
scoreboard ticking over. The lead creeps up to 24.

54th over: South Africa 144-3 (Cook 58, du Plessis 8)

The expectation that Lyon would just switch ends hasn’t materialised, meaning 
his excellent spell is over. Hazlewood continues his impeccable line and 
length, backed up by some irritating antics in the cordon, with skipper Smith 
throwing down the stumps with the batsman so deep in his crease he almost hits 
his own wicket. The Wade effect?

53rd over: South Africa 141-3 (Cook 55, du Plessis 8)

Jackson Bird comes on for the first time since Dinner, from the Cathedral End. 
He’s on the money, full and straight, and du Plessis is happy to present a 
straight bat and bide his time for four deliveries before attacking the final 
two, the latter of which canters to the extra cover boundary.

South Africa have slowed to a crawl after a positive start to this session, 
the last 10 overs going for just 15 runs. Hazlewood and Lyon have done a 
terrific job.

51st over: South Africa 135-3 (Cook 53, du Plessis 3)

Lyon’s starting to find that drift from around the wicket that makes it curve 
away from the two right-handers before dropping, bouncing and turning in. Eight 
overs one for 16 this spell.

50th over: South Africa 134-3 (Cook 53, du Plessis 3)

Australia are trying to fire up out there, Smith and Wade from behind the 
stumps are full of chirrup, Hazlewood with the ball is aiming for du Plessis’ 
rig and then offering his best death stare (which isn’t very scary). Faf, 
averaging 98 in Australia, smirks like the captain of a series-winning team 
might.

Lyon is edging his way back from the selection precipice with this 
performance, more wickets needed yet#ausvsa

49th over: South Africa 134-2 (Cook 53, du Plessis 3)

The South African skipper walks out to the crease to a chorus of boos. His 
team needs him, with a lead of just 10, and a testing spell under lights to 
survive.

WICKET! Duminy b Lyon 26 (South Africa 131-3)

The pressure finally tells, and Lyon’s deserved that. Duminy plays for spin 
but there is none and he plays across the line, failing to do enough to stop 
his bails from being dislodged.

48th over: South Africa 127-2 (Cook 53, Duminy 22)

You feel like the Australians are slowly constricting this partnership, 
starving it of life. Cook cannot get Hazlewood away, and looks a walking wicket 
to the one that nips back off the seam. But then again, he has for most of his 
130+ ball stay and he continues to occupy the crease.

A pushed two into the covers from Cook puts South Africa in front, with 22 
overs of nighttime batting to come.

Matthew Wade full of throaty cries of “Nice Garry!” as Lyon drops six 
deliveries in the right area that Duminy handles adroitly.

For anyone unaware, Garry is in reference to the Australian rules footballer, 
Garry Lyon. Nicknames, eh?

46th over: South Africa 125-2 (Cook 51, Duminy 22)

Hazlewood continues his probing of Cook’s technique, maintaining his 
outside-off line with the odd one darting in, forcing that deliberate 
exhalation of breath from the cordon that on slow-mo replays makes them look 
like dogs with their heads out of a moving car window.

In answer to my earlier question (40th over) - I give you, Stephen Moore.

45th over: South Africa 125-2 (Cook 51, Duminy 22)

Lyon’s good spell almost reaps its reward with Duminy not reaching the pitch 
of the ball on the drive, almost offering a return chance but it bounces 
fractionally in front of the bowler.

Kevin Pietersen reveals he used to be Hansie Cronje in backyard cricket. 
Unpack that one pop-psychologists.

44th over: South Africa 123-2 (Cook 51, Duminy 20)

Josh Hazlewood into the attack and he begins ploughing that furrow around an 
imaginary fifth stump, making Cook hop about the crease like a murophobic.

Might be unpopular, but I think the TV commentary as been the best it's been 
in years. Talking more cricket. Clear change in direction.

I think a lot of people would agree with this sentiment. No doubt the result 
of the change of senior producer in the winter with Brad McNamara moving on. 
Which, like all Australian cricketing riddles, brings us back to Six and Out.

43rd over: South Africa 123-2 (Cook 51, Duminy 20)

Lyon is starting to look dangerous, getting plenty of bounce from this 
surface. There’s a bold shout for LBW but umpire Kettleborough spotted a tiny 
inside-edge. You just wouldn’t consider DRS with the Yorkshireman officiating, 
he’s never wrong.

42nd over: South Africa 118-2 (Cook 50, Duminy 16)

Starc against Duminy is a good battle. The bowler has the upper hand early in 
the over, especially with a testing bouncer in the twilight. But the batsman 
retaliates, slashing a cut for four to bring the deficit to just two runs.

This Test match is beautifully poised.

41st over: South Africa 118-2 (Cook 50, Duminy 16)

Lyon gets one to turn and bounce on Cook that raises questions about LBW and a 
short-leg catch. The five blokes very close to the action ooh and aah, but 
Warnie, a hundred metres or so away is adamant there was a case for DRS; there 
wasn’t.

Cook brings up his 50 later in the over, the third time he’s passed that mark 
in Test cricket, in his sixth match.

40th over: South Africa 116-2 (Cook 49, Duminy 15)

Duminy is one of those batsmen that makes you think he’s going to score big 
whenever he’s at the crease. He caresses a cover drive from a decent Starc 
delivery that was all timing. It seems cruel a player of such talent has a Test 
average of 33.

And that’s why. A shorter delivery generates a reflex pull that is horribly 
mistimed and lobbed just wide of mid-on. Very very lucky. Starc follows up with 
one touching 150kph. Lovely Test cricket.

Have any cricketers ever played the saxophone?

39th over: South Africa 110-2 (Cook 49, Duminy 9)

Lyon continuing with his work and he’s finding a decent line and length 
without threatening Duminy.

Back to the funky conundrum, how about the boys from Six and Out? Brett Lee 
played bass if I remember correctly, the funkiest of all instruments.

38th over: South Africa 107-2 (Cook 49, Duminy 6)

Starc working through the gears, pushing Cook onto his back foot. The ball, 
now in its 38th over isn’t doing a great deal in the air or off the pitch 
though, despite Starc bending his back. Another maiden.

Question - who is cricket’s funkiest player?

37th over: South Africa 107-2 (Cook 49, Duminy 6)

Nathan Lyon replaces Warner in the attack, and he begins with a rank full toss 
down the leg-side; eurgh. In a four man unit, Australia simply cannot afford 
their only spinner to bowl filth. Luckily for Steve Smith the spinning quarter 
of his attack finds his groove and escapes with a maiden.

36th over: South Africa 107-2 (Cook 49, Duminy 6)

A particularly persistent streaker delays Mitchell Starc’s return to the 
attack. It looked like the Adelaide Oval security had lassoed a feral pig. Is 
that brief notoriety really worth the $5k fine?

Starc’s over is full and straight but there’s not much doing as the shadows 
lengthen and the floodlights take effect.

35th over: South Africa 105-2 (Cook 48, Duminy 5)

FUNKY CAPTAINCY KLAXON! In the funky stakes, this is Bootsy Collins, George 
Clinton and James Brown reforming in a heavenly supergroup. David Warner is 
opening the bowling after Dinner. Yes, that David Warner, the guy with the tear 
in his bowling shoulder who’s bowled just 56 overs in his Test career.

It doesn’t work. Five to Cook from the over.

A quick recap of the match situation:

South Africa are 100-2 in their second innings, trailing Australia by 24 runs.

36 overs are due to be bowled in the final session, which is likely to require 
the extra half hour available to tardy captains. (Forget about the fuss for 
ball tampering, slow over rates are what armchair fans should get tweeting 
angrily about).

Stephen Cook is unbeaten on 43 and just about looks a Test opener. JP Duminy 
is on five and yet to get in. The four Australian bowlers have all bowled 
between six and ten overs each.

It might be dinner time, but Guer Rila is hungry, hungry for knowledge. He 
emails in a question, that, frankly, requires a familiarity with cricket 
statistics that I do not have. If you can help him out, feel free to email or 
tweet me atjonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com 
<mailto:jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com> or @JPHowcroft 
<https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft>.

“Hi Jonathan, SA would seem to need at least the same score in this third 
innings as they got in the first. Any idea of the statistics in this regard? 
How often do teams batting first manage to at least equal their first innings’ 
score in the third innings? What are third innings’ scores relative to first 
innings’ scores?”

Good evening ladies and gentleman. I trust you’re suitably fed and watered and 
ready for the final session of this third day of play, one that promises to 
decisively shape the next day or so.

If that sounds like a glib cliche, just think of the possibilities. South 
Africa bat through unscathed and they take a 70 or so run lead into day four 
against a tiring four-man attack. Alternatively, should Australia bag two or 
more wickets, it’s hard to see anything other than a consolation victory on 
Sunday.

Dinner - South Africa 100 for 2

A nice even number for South Africa, who’ve fought hard today with the bat. 
They’ve all but knocked off the deficit, and will then need to push in front. 
The question is how possible that might be. Batting looked pretty good at times 
this afternoon, but it has certainly seemed to get more difficult as the night 
has worn on, based on what we’ve seen over the first two days of play. One 
difference might be that the Australians will be using a ball that’s 34 overs 
old, so it may not have the swing and seam of the newer projectile, but the 
condition of the pink ball has stayed pretty good throughout each innings of 
this match, as it did last year.

Still plenty of pressure on South Africa, who could easily be rolled for a 
lead of around 100 if they don’t concentrate and persist. Hazlewood and Starc 
bowling dangerously, Lyon not as yet. Plenty of stories, Jonathan Howcroft will 
take you through them in the final session. Geoff Lemon signing off.

 Josh Hazlewood of Australia stands on the boundary during day three of the 
Third Test match between Australia and South Africa at Adelaide Oval.

34th over: South Africa 100-2 (Cook 43, Duminy 5)


Lyon on for an exploratory over before the dinner break, to see if he can 
disrupt the batsmen’s footwork. Duminy faces him out though, no interest in 
scoring, just blocks away, and makes it safely through.

33rd over: South Africa 100-2 (Cook 43, Duminy 5)

No luck for Bird in that over. First a good lbw shout is turned down, beating 
Cook comprehsnsively but probably missing leg stump. Then a big drive is edged 
just wide of second slip. There is no third, Smith maybe gets a fingertip on it 
on the full dive, but it goes for four. Added to two runs from an earlier pull 
shot, that raises the South African hundred and cuts the deficit to 24. Kyle 
Abbot said last night they wanted to get 200 in front.

32nd over: South Africa 94-2 (Cook 37, Duminy 5)

Like he’s playing a game of Statues, Stephen Cook has finally come to life. 
Clips Hazlewood through square for four, then drives him for two, and knocks a 
final run through cover. It’s been a fine hand from Cook.

31st over: South Africa 87-2 (Cook 30, Duminy 5)


Bird has transferred his off-stump line to the left-hander without issue, and 
sits there for the entire over. It has an effect on Duminy, who flashes at the 
last ball but can’t make contact. The slips cordon was in anguish, they were so 
close to the third wicket.

Runs for Test discards Joe Burns and Peter Nevill in the Sheffield Shield 
today, as stumps are drawn on Australia’s east coast.

Starc and Lyon roar Australia to dominance against South Africa
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/26/australia-south-africa-day-three-report> 
The third session was always going to shape the narrative of the day, and so 
it proved with Australia jagging four wickets, two at the death, to take a 
commanding position into day four.

All four bowlers performed admirably with Nathan Lyon finally showing the kind 
of form that means he’s now the third most prolific spinner in Australian Test 
history. Mitchell Starc provided the shock factor, Josh Hazlewood forced South 
Africa to play at everything, and Jackson Bird was an excellent foil in a 
series of bowling partnerships.


For the visitors there was only one redeeming story, Stephen Cook’s unbeaten 
81. The opener never looked settled or graceful at the crease, but he battled 
hard, stuck to his task, and he’s given his side a glimmer of hope. He, and 
Quinton de Kock will need to push their lead from 70 to over 150 if a series 
sweep is to be completed. Right now, Australia are heavy favourites to salvage 
the victory their changing of the guard demanded.

We’ll be back to do this all again tomorrow, for how long remains to be seen.

against South Africa in Adelaide. Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images  
69th over: South Africa 194-6 (Cook 81, De Kock 0)

De Kock has to come out after all and he gets three beauties that drift and 
rip and spit that he can’t get anywhere near.
 
The pressure ramps up on the nightwatchman with men crowding around the bat 
and the tailender can’t handle Lyon’s off-spinner from around the wicket, 
playing all around one that hits his pad in front of leg stump. Australia 
rampant now.
 
68th over: South Africa 194-5 (Cook 81, Abbott 0)

Starc continues his marathon spell, but Cook’s up to the task, nudging a pair 
of twos and evading some serious heat from the paceman. Starc’s really given 
his all for his captain this session.

67th over: South Africa 190-5 (Cook 74, Abbott 0)

Kyle Abbott is the nightwatchman and he sees out the over. 

Proper brain fade from Bavuma who not only threw his wicket away but burned 
the last review open to his side with a dreadful call to confirm he both edged 
and gloved Lyon’s delivery.

There's a reason Lyon has 200 Test wickets more than everyone else they want 
to replace him with.

Lyon has done it! But what was Bavuma thinking? He goes for a big sweep with 
four overs remaining, edges it onto his gloves and the ball loops up over Wade 
but Smith has anticipated well to run around and take a smart catch. the game 
tilts further Australia’s way.

66th over: South Africa 187-4 (Cook 74, Bavuma 21)

Starc into the sixth over of his spell, encouraged to stay on an over longer 
than planned perhaps thanks to Bavuma’s aggression in the previous over? No 
further breakthroughs as the day nears its close.

South Africa lead by 63.

65th over: South Africa 183-4 (Cook 73, Bavuma 18)

Lyon recalled to bowl his offies to the right-handed pair from around the 
wicket. The return of spin also means the return of Matthew Wade inches from 
the stump microphone and his booming calls of “Nice Garry!” from every 
delivery, regardless of how nice it actually was. Matthew Wade, the 
wicketkeeper the post-truth era deserves.
 
64th over: South Africa 181-4 (Cook 72, Bavuma 17)

Bavuma takes a fancy to Starc all of a sudden, square driving uppishly for 
four, and then playing and missing an expansive uppercut. He blocks the third 
delivery but then attempts a full blooded hook at a short one that he top edges 
onto his helmet and over the slips. The fifth is another mistimed pulled 
boundary over the cordon! What an odd over, but great entertainment.
 
63rd over: South Africa 169-4 (Cook 72, Bavuma 5)

Bird continues to toil but despite maintaining a decent line and length he 
doesn’t look as though he’s going to force a mistake through his own 
brilliance. He’s relying on the ball misbehaving or a false stroke.

Highlight of the over, umpire Kettleborough, the all-seeing eye, calling the 
tightest of no-balls. He is the best in the business.

Seven overs remaining tonight. 
Dan Liebke (@LiebCricket) 
Warner should go off the field for fifteen minutes and see if he can trick Faf

<https://twitter.com/LiebCricket/status/802458168408215554>  
62nd over: South Africa 168-4 (Cook 72, Bavuma 5)

Cook squirts another couple of runs at the less graceful end of the 
Gower-Martin scale of cricketing attractiveness. He really doesn’t look a match 
for the rapid, muscular Starc but it’s terrific fun that he’s hanging on in 
there. Bavuma matches Cook’s two with a much more appealing shot, leaning into 
a cover drive with the form of a man with a tight core.
 
61st over: South Africa 163-4 (Cook 69, Bavuma 3)

The field has come in much closer and tighter but somehow Cook pierces it with 
a waft just to the left of gully. 175 balls Cook’s been at the crease now, and 
he hasn’t looked ‘in’ for any of them.

South Africa lead by 39.
 
60th over: South Africa 156-4 (Cook 64, Bavuma 1)

Starc just gave Bavuma a stare that made him look the spitting image of Basil 
Fawlty. With that charity moustache Starc’s tall angular frame is reminiscent 
of John Cleese, and he looked at the batsman like Fawlty did at Manuel, ‘tache 
bristling, murmuring something unrepeatable. Maiden over.

59th over: South Africa 155-4 (Cook 64, Bavuma 0)

Bird has adjusted to a Hazlewood line and length and it has Cook fencing 
airily, but a return to a straighter line allows the strike to be rotated. The 
pressure has been relentless from all four Australian bowlers since Dinner, 
ramming home their significant first-innings advantage.

58th over: South Africa 154-4 (Cook 64, Bavuma 0)

With a lead of just 30, you fancy South Africa’s chances of salvaging anything 
from this Test disappeared off the Adelaide Oval turf with their skipper. Du 
Plessis a little late to his shot courtesy of Starc’s extra pace, and it was a 
ripping catch from the debutant.

Predictably, Starc now looks unplayable to the new batsman with Bavuma fending 
without guile at a couple that suddenly look to be dancing off the increasingly 
dewy surface.
 
Huge moment in the match as du Plessis goes cheaply. He drives at a wide Starc 
half-volley but he can only thick edge it to a diving Handscomb in the gully.
 
57th over: South Africa 154-3 (Cook 64, du Plessis 12)

Bird targeting the stumps of Cook, drawing the familiar refrain around the 
oval of “lucky he hit that,” my personal favourite waste of the English 
language in a game where the bloke in question is charged with doing just that.
 
56th over: South Africa 152-3 (Cook 62, du Plessis 12)

Starc returns to the attack to see if his extra pace can unsettle a pair of 
compact right-handers who aren’t looking to unfurl their full range of shots. A 
waiting game this for South Africa who know they can’t afford to lose any more 
wickets under the floodlights.

Du Plessis has his game face on and he’s able to ignore five deliveries but 
still capitalise on the sixth and dispatch an effortless boundary.
 
55th over: South Africa 148-3 (Cook 62, du Plessis 8)

The players return after drinks with the floodlights now in full effect and 
the sunset a preposterously beautiful indigo. A whole heap of superlatives are 
showered on this venue, and they’re all justified.

Back to the cricket and Cook milks a leg-side four off Bird to keep the 
scoreboard ticking over. The lead creeps up to 24.

54th over: South Africa 144-3 (Cook 58, du Plessis 8)

The expectation that Lyon would just switch ends hasn’t materialised, meaning 
his excellent spell is over. Hazlewood continues his impeccable line and 
length, backed up by some irritating antics in the cordon, with skipper Smith 
throwing down the stumps with the batsman so deep in his crease he almost hits 
his own wicket. The Wade effect?
 The Adelaide Oval is pretty. Photograph: Morne de Klerk/Getty Images  
53rd over: South Africa 141-3 (Cook 55, du Plessis 8)

Jackson Bird comes on for the first time since Dinner, from the Cathedral End. 
He’s on the money, full and straight, and du Plessis is happy to present a 
straight bat and bide his time for four deliveries before attacking the final 
two, the latter of which canters to the extra cover boundary.
 
52nd over: South Africa 137-3 (Cook 55, du Plessis 4)

South Africa have slowed to a crawl after a positive start to this session, 
the last 10 overs going for just 15 runs. Hazlewood and Lyon have done a 
terrific job.

18 more overs to go tonight. 
 
51st over: South Africa 135-3 (Cook 53, du Plessis 3)

Lyon’s starting to find that drift from around the wicket that makes it curve 
away from the two right-handers before dropping, bouncing and turning in. Eight 
overs one for 16 this spell.
 
50th over: South Africa 134-3 (Cook 53, du Plessis 3)

Australia are trying to fire up out there, Smith and Wade from behind the 
stumps are full of chirrup, Hazlewood with the ball is aiming for du Plessis’ 
rig and then offering his best death stare (which isn’t very scary). Faf, 
averaging 98 in Australia, smirks like the captain of a series-winning team 
might.

49th over: South Africa 134-2 (Cook 53, du Plessis 3)

The South African skipper walks out to the crease to a chorus of boos. His 
team needs him, with a lead of just 10, and a testing spell under lights to 
survive.
 
The pressure finally tells, and Lyon’s deserved that. Duminy plays for spin 
but there is none and he plays across the line, failing to do enough to stop 
his bails from being dislodged.

Jason Reed/Reuters  
48th over: South Africa 127-2 (Cook 53, Duminy 22)

You feel like the Australians are slowly constricting this partnership, 
starving it of life. Cook cannot get Hazlewood away, and looks a walking wicket 
to the one that nips back off the seam. But then again, he has for most of his 
130+ ball stay and he continues to occupy the crease.

A pushed two into the covers from Cook puts South Africa in front, with 22 
overs of nighttime batting to come.
 
47th over: South Africa 125-2 (Cook 51, Duminy 22)

Matthew Wade full of throaty cries of “Nice Garry!” as Lyon drops six 
deliveries in the right area that Duminy handles adroitly.

For anyone unaware, Garry is in reference to the Australian rules footballer, 
Garry Lyon. Nicknames, eh?
 
46th over: South Africa 125-2 (Cook 51, Duminy 22)

Hazlewood continues his probing of Cook’s technique, maintaining his 
outside-off line with the odd one darting in, forcing that deliberate 
exhalation of breath from the cordon that on slow-mo replays makes them look 
like dogs with their heads out of a moving car window.

In answer to my earlier question (40th over) - I give you, Stephen Moore. 
 Moore moore moore, how do you like it?  
45th over: South Africa 125-2 (Cook 51, Duminy 22)

Lyon’s good spell almost reaps its reward with Duminy not reaching the pitch 
of the ball on the drive, almost offering a return chance but it bounces 
fractionally in front of the bowler.

Kevin Pietersen reveals he used to be Hansie Cronje in backyard cricket. 
Unpack that one pop-psychologists.
 
44th over: South Africa 123-2 (Cook 51, Duminy 20)

Josh Hazlewood into the attack and he begins ploughing that furrow around an 
imaginary fifth stump, making Cook hop about the crease like a murophobic.
Karen Lyon (@klioness) 
Might be unpopular, but I think the TV commentary as been the best it's been 
in years. Talking more cricket. Clear change in direction.

I think a lot of people would agree with this sentiment. No doubt the result 
of the change of senior producer in the winter with Brad McNamara moving on. 
Which, like all Australian cricketing riddles, brings us back to Six and Out.
 
43rd over: South Africa 123-2 (Cook 51, Duminy 20)

Lyon is starting to look dangerous, getting plenty of bounce from this 
surface. There’s a bold shout for LBW but umpire Kettleborough spotted a tiny 
inside-edge. You just wouldn’t consider DRS with the Yorkshireman officiating, 
he’s never wrong.
 
42nd over: South Africa 118-2 (Cook 50, Duminy 16)

Starc against Duminy is a good battle. The bowler has the upper hand early in 
the over, especially with a testing bouncer in the twilight. But the batsman 
retaliates, slashing a cut for four to bring the deficit to just two runs.

This Test match is beautifully poised. 
 
41st over: South Africa 118-2 (Cook 50, Duminy 16)

Lyon gets one to turn and bounce on Cook that raises questions about LBW and a 
short-leg catch. The five blokes very close to the action ooh and aah, but 
Warnie, a hundred metres or so away is adamant there was a case for DRS; there 
wasn’t.

Cook brings up his 50 later in the over, the third time he’s passed that mark 
in Test cricket, in his sixth match.
 
40th over: South Africa 116-2 (Cook 49, Duminy 15)

Duminy is one of those batsmen that makes you think he’s going to score big 
whenever he’s at the crease. He caresses a cover drive from a decent Starc 
delivery that was all timing. It seems cruel a player of such talent has a Test 
average of 33.

And that’s why. A shorter delivery generates a reflex pull that is horribly 
mistimed and lobbed just wide of mid-on. Very very lucky. Starc follows up with 
one touching 150kph. Lovely Test cricket.

Have any cricketers ever played the saxophone? 
 
39th over: South Africa 110-2 (Cook 49, Duminy 9)

Lyon continuing with his work and he’s finding a decent line and length 
without threatening Duminy.

Back to the funky conundrum, how about the boys from Six and Out? Brett Lee 
played bass if I remember correctly, the funkiest of all instruments.
 
38th over: South Africa 107-2 (Cook 49, Duminy 6)

Starc working through the gears, pushing Cook onto his back foot. The ball, 
now in its 38th over isn’t doing a great deal in the air or off the pitch 
though, despite Starc bending his back. Another maiden.

Question - who is cricket’s funkiest player? 
 Any advance on this bloke? Photograph: Will Burgess/REUTERS  
37th over: South Africa 107-2 (Cook 49, Duminy 6)

Nathan Lyon replaces Warner in the attack, and he begins with a rank full toss 
down the leg-side; eurgh. In a four man unit, Australia simply cannot afford 
their only spinner to bowl filth. Luckily for Steve Smith the spinning quarter 
of his attack finds his groove and escapes with a maiden.
 
36th over: South Africa 107-2 (Cook 49, Duminy 6)

A particularly persistent streaker delays Mitchell Starc’s return to the 
attack. It looked like the Adelaide Oval security had lassoed a feral pig. Is 
that brief notoriety really worth the $5k fine?

Starc’s over is full and straight but there’s not much doing as the shadows 
lengthen and the floodlights take effect.

35th over: South Africa 105-2 (Cook 48, Duminy 5)

FUNKY CAPTAINCY KLAXON! In the funky stakes, this is Bootsy Collins, George 
Clinton and James Brown reforming in a heavenly supergroup. David Warner is 
opening the bowling after Dinner. Yes, that David Warner, the guy with the tear 
in his bowling shoulder who’s bowled just 56 overs in his Test career.

It doesn’t work. Five to Cook from the over.
 Tear the roof off your shoulder tendon.  
A quick recap of the match situation:

South Africa are 100-2 in their second innings, trailing Australia by 24 runs.

36 overs are due to be bowled in the final session, which is likely to require 
the extra half hour available to tardy captains. (Forget about the fuss for 
ball tampering, slow over rates are what armchair fans should get tweeting 
angrily about).

Stephen Cook is unbeaten on 43 and just about looks a Test opener. JP Duminy 
is on five and yet to get in. The four Australian bowlers have all bowled 
between six and ten overs each.

 
It might be dinner time, but Guer Rila is hungry, hungry for knowledge. He 
emails in a question, that, frankly, requires a familiarity with cricket 
statistics that I do not have. If you can help him out, feel free to email or 
tweet me atjonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com

“Hi Jonathan, SA would seem to need at least the same score in this third 
innings as they got in the first. Any idea of the statistics in this regard? 
How often do teams batting first manage to at least equal their first innings’ 
score in the third innings? What are third innings’ scores relative to first 
innings’ scores?”
 
If the Dinner break is too long to satisfy your yearning for over-by-over 
descriptions of live cricket, England are batting on the first day of the third 
Test against India in Mohali. You can follow that here:

Good evening ladies and gentleman. I trust you’re suitably fed and watered and 
ready for the final session of this third day of play, one that promises to 
decisively shape the next day or so.

If that sounds like a glib cliche, just think of the possibilities. South 
Africa bat through unscathed and they take a 70 or so run lead into day four 
against a tiring four-man attack. Alternatively, should Australia bag two or 
more wickets, it’s hard to see anything other than a consolation victory on 
Sunday.
 
A nice even number for South Africa, who’ve fought hard today with the bat. 
They’ve all but knocked off the deficit, and will then need to push in front. 
The question is how possible that might be. Batting looked pretty good at times 
this afternoon, but it has certainly seemed to get more difficult as the night 
has worn on, based on what we’ve seen over the first two days of play. One 
difference might be that the Australians will be using a ball that’s 34 overs 
old, so it may not have the swing and seam of the newer projectile, but the 
condition of the pink ball has stayed pretty good throughout each innings of 
this match, as it did last year.

Still plenty of pressure on South Africa, who could easily be rolled for a 
lead of around 100 if they don’t concentrate and persist. Hazlewood and Starc 
bowling dangerously, Lyon not as yet. Plenty of stories, Jonathan Howcroft will 
take you through them in the final session. Geoff Lemon signing off.

34th over: South Africa 100-2 (Cook 43, Duminy 5)


Lyon on for an exploratory over before the dinner break, to see if he can 
disrupt the batsmen’s footwork. Duminy faces him out though, no interest in 
scoring, just blocks away, and makes it safely through.


 
33rd over: South Africa 100-2 (Cook 43, Duminy 5)

No luck for Bird in that over. First a good lbw shout is turned down, beating 
Cook comprehsnsively but probably missing leg stump. Then a big drive is edged 
just wide of second slip. There is no third, Smith maybe gets a fingertip on it 
on the full dive, but it goes for four. Added to two runs from an earlier pull 
shot, that raises the South African hundred and cuts the deficit to 24. Kyle 
Abbot said last night they wanted to get 200 in front.

 
32nd over: South Africa 94-2 (Cook 37, Duminy 5)

Like he’s playing a game of Statues, Stephen Cook has finally come to life. 
Clips Hazlewood through square for four, then drives him for two, and knocks a 
final run through cover. It’s been a fine hand from Cook.

 
31st over: South Africa 87-2 (Cook 30, Duminy 5)


Bird has transferred his off-stump line to the left-hander without issue, and 
sits there for the entire over. It has an effect on Duminy, who flashes at the 
last ball but can’t make contact. The slips cordon was in anguish, they were so 
close to the third wicket.

Runs for Test discards Joe Burns and Peter Nevill in the Sheffield Shield 
today, as stumps are drawn on Australia’s east coast.
