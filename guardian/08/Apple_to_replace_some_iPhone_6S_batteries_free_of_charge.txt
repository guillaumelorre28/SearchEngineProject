 free of charge after discovering a fault with the 2015 top-end smartphone.


The company has started a free repair programme for iPhone 6S 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone-6s> smartphones manufactured 
between September and October 2015.

Apple said in a support document published on Sunday 
<https://www.apple.com/uk/support/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown/>: “Apple has 
determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut 
down.

“If your iPhone <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> 6s has any 
damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, 
that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some 
cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair.”

Checking whether your iPhone 6S is eligible for the free repair requires a 
trip to anApple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> store or 
authorised service centre. Mobile phone network stores are not part of the 
service programme.

Apple is also offering refunds for those who have already paid to replace 
their batteries for the same issue.

The smartphone maker recently kicked off a repair programme for the so-called 
touch disease affecting the iPhone 6 Plus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/18/apple-iphone-6-plus-touch-disease-flaw>
, which starts as a thin grey line on the display and eventually renders the 
phone’s touchscreen inoperative.

Apple charges £146.44 <http://www.apple.com/uk/support/iphone6plus-multitouch/>
 for affected devices with unbroken screen glass to repair the touchscreen 
issues.
