A French farmer, who has become a local hero for helping African migrants 
cross the border from Italy and giving them shelter, has gone on trial for 
aiding illegal arrivals.

The 37-year-old activist, accused of “helping undocumented foreigners enter, 
move about and reside” inFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>, 
faces up to five years in prison and a €30,000 (£25,500) fine if convicted.

Herrou’s olive farm sits in a valley on the border of Italy, near a popular 
route for migrants trying to slip past border controls.

He has been unapologetic about helping

.

“If we have to break the law to help people, let’s do it!” he told supporters 
outside the Nice court on Wednesday, where a crowd of about 300 people gathered.

“Our role is to help people overcome danger, and the danger is this border,” 
he said, accusing French police of detaining “thousands” of minors and dumping 
them back across the border.

In October, Herrou led a group of activists who occupied a disused holiday 
village belonging to the SNCF state railway company and opened it up to a group 
of migrants.

Police intervened after three days to evacuate the makeshift camp and arrested 
Herrou.

Two months earlier, he was arrested for trying to smuggle eight Eritrean 
migrants by car from Italy into France. That case was later dropped, with 
prosecutors accepting that he acted on humanitarian grounds.

However, he is now accused of being more activist than good samaritan.

Herrou is part of a network of citizens and activists who have resorted to 
semi-clandestine tactics in assisting migrants who are regularly removed by the 
police from trains crossing into France and sent back to Italy.

Outlaws for some, they have been likened by others to the French people who 
helped hide Jews during the second world war.

A university researcher was also prosecuted in October after being caught 
giving a lift to three Eritrean women near Nice, shortly after their arrival 
from Italy.

The ruling in the researcher’s case is expected on Friday. Prosecutors have 
called for a six-month suspended sentence.

In December, a 73-year-old academic was fined €1,500 for a similar 
infringement.
