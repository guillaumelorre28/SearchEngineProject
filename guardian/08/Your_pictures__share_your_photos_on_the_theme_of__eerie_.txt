We’re now running a regular weekly photography assignment in the Observer New 
Review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review?guni=Keyword%20Page:crumb%20nav:Position5:New%20Review>
 and the next theme is ‘eerie.’ Share your photos of what eerie means to you – 
and tell us about your image in the description box.

The closing date is Thursday 27 October at 10 am. We’ll publish our favourites 
in The New Review on Sunday 30 October and in a gallery on the Guardian site.

You can share your ‘eerie’ pictures by clicking on the blue ‘Contribute’ 
button on this article. You can also use theGuardian app 
<http://preview.gutools.co.uk/global/ng-interactive/2014/may/29/-sp-the-guardian-app-for-ios-and-android>
 and search for ‘GuardianWitness assignments’ – and if you add it to the 
homepage – you can keep up with all our assignments.
