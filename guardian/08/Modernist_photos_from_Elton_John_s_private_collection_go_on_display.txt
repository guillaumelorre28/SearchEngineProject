Almost 200 modernist photographs from a vast collection built by Sir Elton 
John after he stopped drinking 26 years ago have gone on display at theTate 
Modern <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tate-modern>.

The singer has about 8,000 works – some of which he hangs in his penthouse in 
Atlanta, Georgia – in a private collection considered one of the finest in the 
world.

The photographs lent to the London gallery are images from the 1920s to the 
50s by some of the most important photographers of the past century, including 
Man Ray, André Kertész and Berenice Abbott.

John explained how his passion for photography was inspired by sobriety after 
leaving rehab. “What drew me to photography was I got sober in 1990. I’d had my 
pictures and photograph taken by a lot of great photographers and never knew 
anything about it as an art form whatsoever,” he said.

He bought his first images, black and white fashion photographs, while staying 
in France with a friend. “I thought these are amazing, I bought maybe 12.”

Since then, John said, photography had taken “over my life in a way … It’s 
been the art form I’ve loved the most ever and I’ve loved all sorts of art 
forms. This is the one I’m most passionate and know most about.”

John uses his 18,000 sq ft apartment in the Buckhead area of Atlanta 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB980200495744327570> as his private gallery, 
displaying the images in gold and silver frames rather than the usual black 
metal.

In his bedroom he hangs Man Ray’s Noire et Blanche, a pair of images – 
positive and negative – currently on loan to Tate. “It hangs above my bed in 
Atlanta. So if I die and it falls off the wall at least I will have been killed 
by a Man Ray,” he joked.

Over the past seven years, the Tate has amassed a photography collection of 
about 3,000 works but it admits that it came far too late to the genre.

Simon Baker, who was appointed curator of photography in 2009, said: “We 
almost completely missed the party, I think they were just tidying up from the 
night before.”

But it could never afford to acquire the works in John’s collection. Prices 
for modernist photography have soared in recent years, with even John admitting 
he would not be able to afford many of the works he currently owns.


The Tate said the exhibition marked the beginning of a long-term relationship 
with John and his partner, David Furnish, who have agreed to loan “important 
works to the nation”. What they are remains to be seen.

The exhibition chronicles a period often referred to as the “coming of age” of 
photography, which produced images that were more challenging, experimental and 
innovative than ever before.

It includes photographs such as Herbert Bayer’s Humanly Impossible 
(Self-Portrait) 
<https://www.moma.org/interactives/objectphoto/objects/83703.html> in which the 
artist looks amazed at having apparently removed a section of his arm.

There is also a group of Man Ray portraits of artists and surrealists 
including Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Max Ernst and André Breton, being 
publicly exhibited together for the first time.

In another room, there are documentary photographs from the great depression 
by Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans.

John said collecting photography had opened his eyes to “one of the most 
important and progressive art forms of the 20th century”.

He said: “I want everyone to go away thinking about the artists behind these 
images and marvel at how they experimented and changed the way we see things 
forever. They were going where no other photographer had gone before. I 
consider them true adventurers and what they did was extraordinary.”
