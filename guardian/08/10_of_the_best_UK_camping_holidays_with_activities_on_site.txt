Barefoot Campsites, Oxfordshire
Campers can start the day with a wild swim at three small riverside sites near 
Oxford which are next to a safe stretch of the Thames. Those who don’t fancy a 
dip can hire canoes, and fishing permits are available. The sites offer 
back-to-basics camping, with no electricity, just gas-fired showers and 
composting toilets. Campfires and barbecues are encouraged. Visitors can take 
their own tents and small campervans, or book a bell tent or log pod.
