A USGA spokesman said: “He has entered the championship, just like all the 
exempt players who have that status for the US Open. The deadline for entries 
to the US Open is this coming Wednesday at 5pm Eastern Time.

“I don’t have the information as to when he entered, but I can confirm he has 
entered the US Open as have all the other players who hold fully exempt status.”

The former world No1 has reportedly been holding lengthy practice sessions and 
was recently caught on camera hitting shots during a clinic at a junior event. 
However the former world No1 said he only played his first holes on Monday.

“I’m definitely a little tired but I feel pretty good,” Woods said. “I haven’t 
been out here playing like this. I hadn’t played any holes until today. I know 
people have said I’ve played holes back at Medalist, but I haven’t. This is 
actually the first time I’ve played holes since Wyndham. It’s been a while.

“I’m just progressing. You saw how I was going at it today, nice and smooth. 
That’s harder than I have been going at it the last month. Just gradually 
progressing. We’re just trying to progress and I’m doing that.”

Woods also registered for the 2014 US Open despite having recently had back 
surgery but later opted not to play.
