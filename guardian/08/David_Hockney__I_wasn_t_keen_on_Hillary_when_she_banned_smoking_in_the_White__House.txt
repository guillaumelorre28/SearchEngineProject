David Hockney <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hockney> laughs, and 
pauses to think. It is one day after Donald Trump was elected the next 
president of the United States, and the world has shifted a little on its axis.

“I don’t suppose it’s going to be that different [with Trump as president],” 
he says, carefully. “That’s my comment.”


“[Politics] is always a pretty shabby game to me, so I keep out of it 
actually. I notice thatHouse of Cards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/house-of-cards> is the same plot as 
The Borgias 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/13/borgias-sky-atlantic-grace-dent>
.” Both television shows, one set in contemporary America, the other in 16th 
century Italy, revolve around power, ambition and corruption.

David Hockney marvels at a new medium, the art of ‘drawing on glass’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2016/nov/12/david-hockney-marvels-at-a-new-medium-the-art-of-drawing-on-glass-video>
One of the world’s greatest and most popular artists is at the National 
Gallery ofVictoria <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria> in 
Australia, surrounded by his characteristically vibrant and colourful work. He 
is dressed nattily in a white cap, fawn suit, dark green vest and loafers. At 
79, he looks a little frail. He had a minor stroke a few years ago and suffers 
serious hearing loss. Every so often, he lets out a rasping smoker’s cough.

Hockney has endured the long flight from his studio in Los Angeles for the 
world premiere of an exhibition that, at his age, might be expected to be a 
retrospective. Instead, it’s called “Current”, and is focused on Hockney’s work 
in the last decade.

It has been a period of extraordinary energy for an artist known for his 
restless curiosity. The exhibition includes hundreds of images Hockney drew on 
iPhone and iPad apps, “a marvellous new medium”. Some are on screens where a 
viewer can see how the drawing was created, line by line. Others are blown up 
into huge pictures.

I just let the politics do what it’s doing. I’m not interested enough. I’m 
interested in other things.

Hockney may be uninterested in politics – although he returns to the subject 
later – because he works so hard and with such discipline. Work is what has 
interested him for 60 years, since his early days as one of the faces of 
swinging ‘60s London, to these days when he rarely leaves home. He works in his 
studio, reads a little, watches television and goes to bed at 9pm.


In Current, he is exploring ideas he has played around with all his life – how 
we look at things, at perspective, and the very place of art in an age of 
photography.

In recent years, he has returned to painting. Featured in the exhibition is 82 
Portraits and 1 Still Life 
<https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/david-hockney-portraits>, hung in a 
dedicated room as a single work. They include portraits of famous friends such 
as Australian performerBarry Humphries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barry-humphries> and American artist John 
Baldessari <http://www.baldessari.org/>, as well as everyday people and family 
members.

The subjects sat on the same chair and the portraits are identical in size. He 
finished each of them in three days – “21 days of exposure”, he says wryly, a 
reference to the difference between painting and photography.

So what do these portraits offer that a photograph cannot?

 “If those were photographs in there, it would be a lot less interesting,” he 
says. “People have been too taken with photography, everybody’s a photographer 
today, aren’t they? Everybody.” Painting, he insists, will be relevant in 20 
years time, “photography less so”.

over the place, but I never did.’ Photograph: Wayne Taylor 
He smiles when he says all this. He will not concede that photography is an 
art form, even a minor one. “Well when [New York curator] Henry Geldzahler was 
asked that question, ‘is it an art?’, his reply was ‘I thought it was a hobby’.”

Hockey is enormously popular right now, and he is revelling in it. Tate 
Britain in London is staging a Hockney retrospective early next year. There’s a 
new “sumo-size” book, A Bigger Book – a massive thing that comes with its own 
stand. It was conceived as a visual autobiography of the artist’s work, from 
his teenage days at the Bradford School of Art to his iPad drawings and 
Yorkshire landscapes. He has also recently co-authored A History of Pictures: 
From the Cave to the Computer Screen, which the Guardian’s Clive James called a 
“magic flight of a book

anti-smoker of them all.’ Photograph: David Hockney/National Gallery of Victoria
Hockney has found it interesting to look back, but he’s not nostalgic.

 “Painters live in the now, there’s only now. But I did start looking back in 
January because we were doing [A Bigger Book]. I’ve spent a lot of time this 
year looking back.

 “You see consistency, I always knew the consistency was there but other 
people didn’t. Other people thought I was all over the place, but I never did. 
I think now you see it very clearly.”

 The consistency, he says, is “about space”. 

 “When people ask me ‘Why are you popular?’, I like to think it might be 
space. I don’t know actually but I know I’m always interested in pictorial 
space, that’s why I’m interested in perspective.”

 For someone so innovative, Hockney is keen to see what happens next. Today, 
everyone is a photographer, and all of us can manipulate images. He thinks the 
mass media is disappearing, and the “star” system with it. Actually, he says, 
he is interested in what’s going on in the world – he has three newspapers 
delivered each day, the Financial Times, the New York Times and the Los Angeles 
Times.

 “But I can see they [newspapers] are dying, really. Their influence is going 
to go – probably that’s something Mr Trump knew about, didn’t he?”

 He’s voted only twice in his life – he is a British citizen who has lived 
much of his adult life in the United States. He noticed around his 
neighbourhood there was more enthusiasm for Democratic presidential candidate 
Bernie Sanders than for Hillary Clinton.

 “I do follow it, yes I do. But I must admit I wasn’t that keen on Hillary 
because when the Clintons were in the White House they banned smoking 
immediately.

 “I said, well that would welcome Hitler a lot more than Churchill. Churchill 
smoked 10 cigars a day for 70 years and lived to be 90, so I don’t know what 
they’re going on about. And Hitler was the biggest anti-smoker of them all, you 
couldn’t smoke in his presence – which is why I notice in Germany there are 
quite a lot of smokers because they can’t demonise smokers there.”

It’s an idiosyncratic reason for a political leaning, but Hockney has been 
smoking since 1954 and takes delight at thumbing his nose at the demonisation 
of his habit. He insisted hisMelbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> hotel room allowed 
smoking. And really, he’s not interested in politics.

 “I’ve only lived in England, France and the United States, and in each of 
these countries you’re very free. So I just let the politics do what it’s 
doing. I’m not interested enough. I’m interested in other things.”

 At the very end of our interview, he offers one last thing. “Is Donald Trump 
going to be worse than George Bush? I don’t know. George Bush killed loads of 
people in Iraq, didn’t he?”

• David Hockney: Current <http://ngv.vic.gov.au/exhibition/david-hockney/> is
