Kent has many attractions for residents and visitors (Kent tops travel guide’s 
list for family holidays

, 17 June). These include the first public memorial to the peace campaigner 
Brian Haw, who died four years ago today.

We recently marked the first anniversary of the peace bench dedicated to 
Brian, which is on the beach close to where he and his siblings attended 
“Sunshine Corner” events when he lived here as a teenager.

Today and every day it provides a great place to enjoy Whitstable’s remarkable 
sunsets, remember Brian’s sacrifices for peace and the right to peaceful 
protest, and reflect on what more we can all do to enact his catchphrase: “Wage 
peace!”
