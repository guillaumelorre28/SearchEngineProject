A sludgy image of the grey Rhine under grey skies, by the German artist 
Andreas Gursky, has sold for $4.3m (£2.7m) at a Christie's auction in New York, 
setting a new world record for a photograph.

The desolate featureless landscape shown in Rhine II is no accident: Gursky 
explained in an interview <http:/vimeo.com/17692722> that it is his favourite 
picture: "It says a lot using the most minimal means … for me it is an 
allegorical picture about the meaning of life and how things are."

In fact the artist carefully digitally removed any intrusive features – dog 
walkers, cyclists, a factory building – until it was bleak enough to satisfy 
him.

Christie's described it as "a dramatic and profound reflection on human 
existence and our relationship to nature on the cusp of the 21st century".

The buyer of the huge glass-mounted 350cm x 200cm (80in x 140in) print is 
unknown, but other Gursky works hang in the collections of major museums 
including Tate Modern and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

The previous record for a photograph was paid for a 1981 print by the American 
Cindy Sherman, who is also the subject of all her own works.

Gursky's prices have steadily been climbing at auction for the past decade: a 
diptych, 99 cent II, sold for £1.7m at a 2007 Sotheby's auction.
