PUBS

Fox and Hounds, Ennerdale, Lake District

A fine stop on the coast-to-coast walk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/may/02/walkingholidays.uk> (Ennerdale 
is the first stop on Wainwright’s famous trail), this pub is also a decent 
pitstop for a pint after a less-ambitious stroll up Grike Fell. After the Fox 
and Hounds closed in 2010, the community came together to buy the pub lease, 
and it nails that winning formula: good beer (all sourced from West Cumbria 
brewers including the local Ennerdale Brewery), locally sourced food and a 
friendly atmosphere.

In the 1980s, the phrase “community-run pub” had all the allure of a parish 
council meeting. The Red Lion started a huge change in perception back then, as 
the first example of a community-owned public house anywhere in the UK, having 
been bought from Whitbread, and is still going strong with a recipe of 
hand-pulled pints, good food and convivial events.

Recently transformed by community ownership into a great social hub inside 
York’s city walls, the Golden Ball story is an inspiration. At the heart of the 
Grade II-listed pub – with a well-preserved Victorian layout and lovely tiled 
bar – is the hand-pulled beer: a broad range of old local favourites (Timothy 
Taylor’s Golden Best, Everards Tiger) and new contenders like local 
micro-brewery Treboom’s Yorkshire Sparkle.

The idea is simple: teach prisoners to cook and serve good food, and 
afterwards, employment, rather than reoffending, beckons. It works. Plus the 
food is excellent and seasonal – confit of sea trout, samphire and sorrel 
followed by elderflower and strawberry panna cotta, for example. The Clink at 
Cardiff (there are others atBrixton

Housed in a magnificent Victorian fire station near the south side of Tower 
Bridge, the Brigade is a social enterprise that gives homeless people a chance 
to learn culinary skills, then apply them. Reviews are impressive – for 
innovative bistro-style dishes such as barbecued sticky partridge, ox burger 
and pineapple carpaccio.

The classic tale of a much-loved local resource saved by the locals themselves 
applies to this fine, vibrant museum in a beautiful park at the centre of the 
Rossendale Valley. At the heart of it is a Victorian natural history 
collection, but temporary exhibitions and an excellent cafe-bar all add to the 
experience.
