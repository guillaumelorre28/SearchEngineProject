Hidden Hut has come a long way since the days when it sold plastic buckets, 
spades and inflatable dolphins. Five years ago, local couple Jemma Glass and 
Simon Stallard took over the cafe overlooking Porthcurnick beach, on the 
Roseland peninsula in southern Cornwall, and transformed it into a showcase for 
the brilliant ingredients produced on this coast.


Simon, a chef by trade, started cooking fish from the bay at casual evening 
barbecues and outdoor suppers. This was so successful that the Hidden Hut’s 
reputation spread, and today getting tickets for one of its now-famous feast 
nights has been compared to hunting down sought-after festival tickets. Advance 
tickets for the feasts (which take place three times a month, from April to the 
end of September) are sold in three seasonal batches online.

In true British style, they go ahead whatever the weather – and on the May 
evening we have tickets for, it is pouring down.

Wrapped up in waterproof jackets, my friend and I, who have driven down from 
Devon for the evening, are greeted warmly at the serving hatch of the hut: 
inside, the team mill about, proffering smiles and hot water bottles.

There is no seating inside the hut, just long wooden tables and chairs out in 
the open. There is no shelter tonight. “Usually we put marquees up,” says 
Jemma. But this evening’s strong southerly breeze has ruled that out. Even so, 
no one has cried off from tonight’s feast of sticky ribs.

Despite the driving rain, all around us we hear corks popping, animated 
chatter and laughter. “It’s a true test of British spirit,” says Simon, 
surveying the guests. Groups of friends, families and couples are huddled 
around tables or reclining in the camping chairs they’ve brought along.

Guests are encouraged to bring whatever creature comforts they like, from 
cushions and rugs to tents. Some diners are getting creative with their 
umbrellas, propping them up to create a makeshift shelter.

 Chefs prepare a different menu for each of the three feast nights per month 
“We’ve had billionaires come, but we also get the fishermen and the local 
postman,” says Jemma.

When it’s time to dish up, people form a queue along the outside serving area 
beside the hut, plates clutched – guests bring their own crockery, cutlery and 
alcohol.

Our plates are handed back, piled high with smoky, sticky barbecued ribs, 
Texan beans, freshly baked cornbread and watercress. Macaroni cheese is the 
vegetarian option.

Rain pours off my jacket as I sit down and tuck into my feast. The Texan beans 
are stand-out, the macaroni cheese comforting, and the homemade barbecue sauce 
has a delicious chilli kick. My friend reports that the barbecue ribs are some 
of the best she has ever tasted. As we’re eating, a chef comes round, offering 
extra buckets of ribs. Jemma darts around making sure everyone has blankets and 
hot water bottles; her baby son is nestled into her chest.

The hut, open from March to October, is a normal cafe by day, doing soups, 
sandwiches, pasties, cakes (baked by Jemma’s mum, Maggie) and hot chocolate.

Feast night tickets cost from £10 for a mussel or octopus feast to £25 for 
lobster and chips (the most popular supper). On lobster night, a fisherman 
sails into the bay to deliver a bucket full of fresh lobsters into the arms of 
the chefs who are firing up the grill. Other feasts might be a south Indian 
vegetable thali with 13 small dishes, inspired by Simon’s travels in India.

Seafood paella featuring local shellfish, monkfish and pollock is another 
staple, along with Moroccan spiced lamb, slow-cooked octopus crisped on the 
grill, and chicken cooked on the wood-fired grill with garlic and tarragon.

The setting is beautiful: the odd brave surfer and local dog walker can be 
seen enjoying the beach and the crashing waves. Along the coast, boats are 
bobbing in Porthscatho harbour.

Simon says: “There have been clear nights when the sun’s just gone down, and 
there are dolphins out in the bay.” We all laugh. We make a promise to come 
back on a sunnier day and, drenched but full, leave the groups of friends still 
laughing and joking under a makeshift cover, clinking mugs.
• The meal was provided by the Hidden Hut (hiddenhut.co.uk

for feast nights in June and July, goes on sale on 2 June at 7pm at
