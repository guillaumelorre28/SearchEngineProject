YHA St Briavels Castle, Gloucestershire 
<http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/st-briavels>
There aren’t many moated Norman castles that you can stay in for less than £20 
a night – but you can here. St Briavels was built as a hunting lodge for King 
John in 1205: explore it on a 45-minute guided tour, get into character with 
the help of the dressing-up box in the chapel or attend a medieval banquet. The 
most atmospheric rooms are at the top of the towers, up a steep, winding 
staircase. The castle is in the middle of the Forest of Dean and Wye Valley, 
eight miles north of Chepstow, and Offa’s Dyke path runs right past.
• Beds from £19, private rooms from £59, sleeps 71

This brand-new boutique hostel opened this week in the former Royal York 
hotel, a grand building dating from 1819. The decor is more bohemian kitsch 
than your average wipe-clean style hostel, the bar serves stone-baked pizzas 
and the location, right in the centre of Brighton, couldn’t be better. All 51 
rooms are en suite, including 18 doubles – the premium doubles have king-size 
beds, sea views and rolltop baths.
• Beds from £14.50, private rooms from £25, sleeps 151

A converted mountain hut at the head of the Ennerdale Valley is the YHA’s most 
remote retreat, accessible only by foot or bike (the nearest road is 2½ miles 
away). Last year’s £260,000 renovation means it is also one of the most 
eco-friendly properties, with thermal insulation, sun pipes, photovoltaic and 
solar panels, a wood-burning stove and LED lights. Walkers have easy access to 
nearby peaks including Great Gable, Pillar, Red Pike and Steeple.
• Beds from £18, private rooms from £43.50, sleeps 16

This cottage is set in five acres of grounds stretching down to the sea, at 
the start/end of the Pembrokeshire coastal path. The communal areas were 
refurbished in 2011 and the kitchen, in particular, is impressively high-spec. 
Large picture windows look out over the beach – if you’re lucky, you might spot 
a seal or a pod of dolphins.
• Beds from £17.50, private rooms from £47, sleeps 34

This recently restored shooting lodge, built in 1817, dominates the southern 
slopes of Swaledale and has fantastic views across the valley. The lodge is 
built around a central courtyard and has a honeymoon suite on the top floor. 
There are five cosy, heated wooden camping pods in the grounds, each with their 
own veranda. It is a 10-minute walk to the nearest pub, the Bridge Inn in 
Grinton, which has log fires and serves local game shot by the landlord and 
puddings made by his mum.
• Beds from £13, private rooms from £29, sleeps 81
