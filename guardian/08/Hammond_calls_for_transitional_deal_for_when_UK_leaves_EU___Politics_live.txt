Q: How long would it last?

Hammond says “quite significant” infrastructure changes might be needed at 
ports, in the UK and in the EU. And new staff might have to be hired. The more 
we go into this, the more we may conclude that the longer we need.

Q: So more than two years?

Hammond says a two-year deal would be “ambitious”.

UPDATE: Earlier I said here that Philip Hammond said a transitional deal might 
last longer than two years. (See 4.34pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584ed126e4b077e9848502ba#block-584ed126e4b077e9848502ba>
 Andrew Tyrie put it to him that two years was unlikely to be sufficient. I 
interpreted that as Tyrie meaning that a two-year transitional period would be 
insufficient, but, listening again to the exchange, it is clear that Tyrie was 
talking about the two-year article 50 period being insufficient. To correct the 
post, I have taken out the bullet point and the headline.

Hammond said that “a longer period” would be necessary. But he was talking 
about a longer period than the article 50 two years, not a longer period than 
two years on top of that.

Tyrie did ask how long a transitional period might last. But Hammond did not 
answer. He said there would have to be compromises between “the political will 
to get things done and to move on and the bureaucratic and/or business desire 
to have the longest period possible to make any change”.

Q: So this will be a key negotiating demand?

Hammond says he would not put it like that. He thinks it will be in the 
interests of both sides to reach an agreement on a transitional deal.

Hammond says he favours a transitional deal for when UK leaves EU to lesson 
disruption

Tyrie asks Hammond if he favours a transitional deal for when the UK leaves 
the EU.

Hammond says that would be “generally helpful” because there would be “less 
risk of disruption”.

So is that a yes, Tyrie asks. Hammond says it is.

Hammond rejects claim that May stopped him announcing extra social care 
spending in autumn statement

Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is giving evidence to the Treasury committee.

He starts by denying the claim in the Times that Theresa May stopped him from 
including a council tax increase to fund social care in the autumn statement. 
(See 9.08am.)

Andrew Tyrie, the committee chair, praises Hammond for publishing a 
distributional impact analysis for the autumn statement in a form that shows 
the cumulative impact of changes. He says George Osborne was reluctant to do 
this.

Tyrie says the charts show that, if you look at all changes since the general 
election, people in the poorest three deciles lose more than anyone apart from 
the richest 10%.

Hammond says that is because the government was elected on a manifesto 
commitment saying welfare spending should be cut.

Afternoon summary

 * Downing Street has said that under-performing councils are partly to blame 
for the social care crisis. (See 12.56pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584e950ce4b04a74f2782b85#block-584e950ce4b04a74f2782b85>
 As an example of the variation in performance, health sources point to figures 
showing that in Sunderland they lost less than one bed each day because of 
delayed discharges, but in Reading 18 beds were blocked every day. Goverment 
sources have also pointed toa Commons briefing paper (pdf)

containing this chart.  Delayed discharge figures. Photograph: Commons library

In the Common the health minister David Mowat has been answering an urgent 
question on care funding. He told MPs that, although money was an issue, 
leadership and best practice were important too.

Conservative former cabinet minister Lord Prior has died, the Press 
Association reports. He was 89.

Jim Prior served for five years in Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet where he was 
regarded as one of the leading “wets” who opposed her monetarist economic 
policies.

Originally appointed employment secretary when she became prime minister in 
1979, he was moved to the post of Northern Ireland secretary two years later.

The move was widely regarded as a sign of her frustration at his refusal to 
press ahead more quickly with her trade union reforms.

May accuses Labour of 'turning a blind eye to antisemitism'

Theresa May gave a speech to a Conservative Friends of Israel lunch today. 
Here isthe full text 
<http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/12/mays-speech-to-the-conservative-friends-of-israel-full-text.html>
 and here are the key points.

 * May accused Labour of “turning a blind eye to antisemitism” in the party. 
Let me be clear: it is unacceptable that there is anti-Semitism in this 
country.

It is even worse that incidents are reportedly on the rise.

And it is disgusting that these twisted views are being found in British 
politics.

Of course, I am talking mainly about the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> Party and their hard-left allies.

In fact, I understand this lunch has a lot to live up to after the 
extraordinary scenes at the Labour Friends of Israel event.

It began, unusually, with Tom Watson giving a full-throated rendition of Am 
Yisrael Hai.

The audience joined in as his baritone voice carried across the hall.

“Am Yisrael Hai – the people of Israel live.” It is a sentiment that everybody 
in this room wholeheartedly agrees with.

But let me say this: no amount of karaoke can make up for turning a blind eye 
to anti-Semitism.

No matter what Labour say – or sing – they cannot ignore what has been 
happening in their party.

Labour, of course, does not accept that it turns a blind eye to antisemitism, 
as it made clearwhen it published the Shami Chakrabarti report into the issue 
in the summer. <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36672022>

 * She confirmed that the government was adopting a formal definition of 
antisemitism. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/12/antisemitism-definition-government-combat-hate-crime-jews-israel>
 * She praised Israel as “a thriving democracy, a beacon of tolerance, an 
engine of enterprise and an example to the rest of the world for overcoming 
adversity and defying disadvantages.” 
 * She said the government was strongly opposed anti-Israel boycotts, 
divestment and sanctions. 
I couldn’t be clearer: the boycotts, divestment and sanctions movement is 
wrong, it is unacceptable, and this party and this government will have no 
truck with those who subscribe to it.

 * She praised Priti Patel, the international development secretary, for 
reviewing the way UK aid is spent in the occupied territories. 
Let me be clear: no British taxpayers’ money will be used to make payments to 
terrorists or their families.

It is right that Priti Patel has called for an examination of aid spending in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territories to ensure that every penny is spent in the 
right places and in the right way.

 * She said Britain remained committed to the two-state solution. 
 * She criticised the building of “new, illegal settlements” in the occupied 
West Bank. 
When talking about global obligations, we must be honest with our friends, 
like Israel, because that is what true friendship is about.

 That is why we have been clear about building new, illegal settlements: it is 
wrong; it is not conducive to peace; and it must stop.

 * She said Britain was proud of the 1917 Balfour declaration which called for 
the creation of Israel. 
On the 2nd of November 1917, the then foreign secretary – a Conservative 
foreign secretary – Arthur James Balfour wrote: “His Majesty’s government view 
with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish 
people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of 
this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may 
prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in 
Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other 
country.”

It is one of the most important letters in history.

It demonstrates Britain’s vital role in creating a homeland for the Jewish 
people.

And it is an anniversary we will be marking with pride.

ICM poll gives Tories 14-pt lead over Labour - and having Balls as Labour lead 
would make little difference

Yesterday Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary and close ally of Jeremy 
Corbyn, predicted thatLabour would improve its standing in the opinion polls in 
2017. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/11/labour-can-close-gap-in-polls-says-diane-abbott>
 “I’m confident we’re going to close the gap in the coming 12 months,” she 
said. “We’ve had a pretty difficult 12 months, partly Jeremy’s enemies in the 
party, partly commentators, but we have the right policies and the right 
leader.”

In theory doing better shouldn’t be hard - because Labour’s current poll 
figures are terrible. Here are the latest Guardian/ICM figures which give the
Conservatives <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> a 14-point 
lead. (Admittedly that’s two points down on the ICM figures from two weeks ago.)

Conservatives: 41% (down 3 points from ICM two weeks ago) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/29/tories-have-16-pt-lead-over-labour-and-highest-vote-share-for-7-years-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-583d3b24e4b049350cc940b0#block-583d3b24e4b049350cc940b0>

Labour: 27% (down 1)

Ukip: 14% (up 2)

Lib Dems: 9% (up 2)

Greens: 3% (down 1)

Conservative lead: 14 points (down 2)

Ukip and the Lib Dems are both up two points over the last fortnight, no doubt 
reflecting the publicity Ukip has had from the election of a new leader, Paul 
Nuttall, and the Lib Dems have had from their byelection victory in Richmond 
Park.

Can anything help Labour? In the light of Ed Balls’ Strictly-inspired 
transformation into a national treasure, andhints from him that he is thinking 
of a political comeback, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/01/labour-condemns-may-for-floating-plan-to-make-schools-deprioritise-illegal-migrant-pupils-politics-live?page=with:block-58401e47e4b015a427f7658d#block-58401e47e4b015a427f7658d>
 ICM also asked people how they would vote if Balls were leader of the Labour 
party, not Jeremy Corbyn. He makes a bit of a difference, but not much. Here 
are the state of the party figures for this scenario.

Conservatives: 41%

Labour: 30% (up 3 from with Corbyn as leader)

Ukip: 12%

Lib Dems: 8%

Greens: 4%

These figures may help to quash suggestions that a new leader alone would help 
to transform Labour’s fortunes, but Balls can take comfort from the results of 
another question asked in this ICM survey. ICM mentioned Balls and three other 
figures no longer active in frontline politics and asked people if their 
opinion of these figures was more favourable now than it was when they were 
“central to British politics” or less favourable. Balls is the only one of the 
four who has improved his image. Sir John Major and Paddy Ashdown have both 
seen their reputations take a hit, and Tony Blair’s has nosedived. Here are the 
net figures.

Ed Balls: +3 (20% more favourable now minus 17% less)

Paddy Ashdown: -10 (7% more now minus 17% less)

John Major: -12 (10% more now minus 22% less)

Tony Blair: -40 (6% more now minus 46%) less

This finding, of course, casts doubt on how valuable Blair will be to those he 
is supporting in the campaign for a soft Brexit.

ICM Unlimited interviewed an online sample of 2,049 adults aged 18+ on 9-11th 
December 2016. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results 
have been weighted to the profile of all GBadults. ICM is a member of the BPC 
and abides by its rules.

UPDATE: Here is the table with the figures (pdf).

Q: How long would it last?

Hammond says “quite significant” infrastructure changes might be needed at 
ports, in the UK and in the EU. And new staff might have to be hired. The more 
we go into this, the more we may conclude that the longer we need.

Q: So more than two years?

Hammond says a two-year deal would be “ambitious”.

UPDATE: Earlier I said here that Philip Hammond said a transitional deal might 
last longer than two years. (See 4.34pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/12/philip-hammond-treasury-social-care-considering-lettting-councils-raise-council-tax-to-fund-social-care-politics-live?page=with:block-584ed126e4b077e9848502ba#block-584ed126e4b077e9848502ba>
 Andrew Tyrie put it to him that two years was unlikely to be sufficient. I 
interpreted that as Tyrie meaning that a two-year transitional period would be 
insufficient, but, listening again to the exchange, it is clear that Tyrie was 
talking about the two-year article 50 period being insufficient. To correct the 
post, I have taken out the bullet point and the headline.

Hammond said that “a longer period” would be necessary. But he was talking 
about a longer period than the article 50 two years, not a longer period than 
two years on top of that.

Tyrie did ask how long a transitional period might last. But Hammond did not 
answer. He said there would have to be compromises between “the political will 
to get things done and to move on and the bureaucratic and/or business desire 
to have the longest period possible to make any change”.
 
Q: So this will be a key negotiating demand?

Hammond says he would not put it like that. He thinks it will be in the 
interests of both sides to reach an agreement on a transitional deal.
 
Tyrie asks Hammond if he favours a transitional deal for when the UK leaves 
the EU.

Hammond says that would be “generally helpful” because there would be “less 
risk of disruption”.

So is that a yes, Tyrie asks. Hammond says it is.
 
Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is giving evidence to the Treasury committee.

He starts by denying the claim in the Times that Theresa May stopped him from 
including a council tax increase to fund social care in the autumn statement. 
(See 9.08am.)

Andrew Tyrie, the committee chair, praises Hammond for publishing a 
distributional impact analysis for the autumn statement in a form that shows 
the cumulative impact of changes. He says George Osborne was reluctant to do 
this.

Tyrie says the charts show that, if you look at all changes since the general 
election, people in the poorest three deciles lose more than anyone apart from 
the richest 10%.

Hammond says that is because the government was elected on a manifesto 
commitment saying welfare spending should be cut.
 
 * Downing Street has said that under-performing councils are partly to blame 
for the social care crisis. (See 12.56pm.)

 As an example of the variation in performance, health sources point to figures

delayed discharges, but in Reading 18 beds were blocked every day. Goverment

Conservative former cabinet minister Lord Prior has died, the Press 
Association reports. He was 89.

Jim Prior served for five years in Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet where he was 
regarded as one of the leading “wets” who opposed her monetarist economic 
policies.

Originally appointed employment secretary when she became prime minister in 
1979, he was moved to the post of Northern Ireland secretary two years later.

The move was widely regarded as a sign of her frustration at his refusal to 
press ahead more quickly with her trade union reforms.

Theresa May gave a speech to a Conservative Friends of Israel lunch today. 
Here isthe full text 
<http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/12/mays-speech-to-the-conservative-friends-of-israel-full-text.html>
 and here are the key points.

 * May accused Labour of “turning a blind eye to antisemitism” in the party. 
Let me be clear: it is unacceptable that there is anti-Semitism in this 
country.

It is even worse that incidents are reportedly on the rise.

And it is disgusting that these twisted views are being found in British 
politics.

Of course, I am talking mainly about the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> Party and their hard-left allies.

In fact, I understand this lunch has a lot to live up to after the 
extraordinary scenes at the Labour Friends of Israel event.

It began, unusually, with Tom Watson giving a full-throated rendition of Am 
Yisrael Hai.

The audience joined in as his baritone voice carried across the hall.

“Am Yisrael Hai – the people of Israel live.” It is a sentiment that everybody 
in this room wholeheartedly agrees with.

But let me say this: no amount of karaoke can make up for turning a blind eye 
to anti-Semitism.

No matter what Labour say – or sing – they cannot ignore what has been 
happening in their party.

Labour, of course, does not accept that it turns a blind eye to antisemitism, 
as it made clearwhen it published the Shami Chakrabarti report into the issue 
in the summer. <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36672022>

 * She confirmed that the government was adopting a formal definition of 
antisemitism. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/12/antisemitism-definition-government-combat-hate-crime-jews-israel>
 * She praised Israel as “a thriving democracy, a beacon of tolerance, an 
engine of enterprise and an example to the rest of the world for overcoming 
adversity and defying disadvantages.” 
 * She said the government was strongly opposed anti-Israel boycotts, 
divestment and sanctions. 
I couldn’t be clearer: the boycotts, divestment and sanctions movement is 
wrong, it is unacceptable, and this party and this government will have no 
truck with those who subscribe to it.

 * She praised Priti Patel, the international development secretary, for 
reviewing the way UK aid is spent in the occupied territories. 
Let me be clear: no British taxpayers’ money will be used to make payments to 
terrorists or their families.

It is right that Priti Patel has called for an examination of aid spending in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territories to ensure that every penny is spent in the 
right places and in the right way.

 * She said Britain remained committed to the two-state solution. 
 * She criticised the building of “new, illegal settlements” in the occupied 
West Bank. 
When talking about global obligations, we must be honest with our friends, 
like Israel, because that is what true friendship is about.

 That is why we have been clear about building new, illegal settlements: it is 
wrong; it is not conducive to peace; and it must stop.

 * She said Britain was proud of the 1917 Balfour declaration which called for 
the creation of Israel. 
On the 2nd of November 1917, the then foreign secretary – a Conservative 
foreign secretary – Arthur James Balfour wrote: “His Majesty’s government view 
with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish 
people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of 
this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may 
prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in 
Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other 
country.”

It is one of the most important letters in history.

It demonstrates Britain’s vital role in creating a homeland for the Jewish 
people.

And it is an anniversary we will be marking with pride.

<https://twitter.com/CFoI/status/808312491226894336>  
Yesterday Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary and close ally of Jeremy 
Corbyn, predicted thatLabour would improve its standing in the opinion polls in 
2017. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/11/labour-can-close-gap-in-polls-says-diane-abbott>
 “I’m confident we’re going to close the gap in the coming 12 months,” she 
said. “We’ve had a pretty difficult 12 months, partly Jeremy’s enemies in the 
party, partly commentators, but we have the right policies and the right 
leader.”

In theory doing better shouldn’t be hard - because Labour’s current poll 
figures are terrible. Here are the latest Guardian/ICM figures which give the
Conservatives <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> a 14-point 
lead. (Admittedly that’s two points down on the ICM figures from two weeks ago.)

Conservatives: 41% (down 3 points from ICM two weeks ago) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/29/tories-have-16-pt-lead-over-labour-and-highest-vote-share-for-7-years-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-583d3b24e4b049350cc940b0#block-583d3b24e4b049350cc940b0>

Labour: 27% (down 1)

Ukip: 14% (up 2)

Lib Dems: 9% (up 2)

Greens: 3% (down 1)

Conservative lead: 14 points (down 2)

Ukip and the Lib Dems are both up two points over the last fortnight, no doubt 
reflecting the publicity Ukip has had from the election of a new leader, Paul 
Nuttall, and the Lib Dems have had from their byelection victory in Richmond 
Park.

Can anything help Labour? In the light of Ed Balls’ Strictly-inspired 
transformation into a national treasure, andhints from him that he is thinking 
of a political comeback, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/01/labour-condemns-may-for-floating-plan-to-make-schools-deprioritise-illegal-migrant-pupils-politics-live?page=with:block-58401e47e4b015a427f7658d#block-58401e47e4b015a427f7658d>
 ICM also asked people how they would vote if Balls were leader of the Labour 
party, not Jeremy Corbyn. He makes a bit of a difference, but not much. Here 
are the state of the party figures for this scenario.

Conservatives: 41%

Labour: 30% (up 3 from with Corbyn as leader)

Ukip: 12%

Lib Dems: 8%

Greens: 4%

These figures may help to quash suggestions that a new leader alone would help 
to transform Labour’s fortunes, but Balls can take comfort from the results of 
another question asked in this ICM survey. ICM mentioned Balls and three other 
figures no longer active in frontline politics and asked people if their 
opinion of these figures was more favourable now than it was when they were 
“central to British politics” or less favourable. Balls is the only one of the 
four who has improved his image. Sir John Major and Paddy Ashdown have both 
seen their reputations take a hit, and Tony Blair’s has nosedived. Here are the 
net figures.

Ed Balls: +3 (20% more favourable now minus 17% less)

Paddy Ashdown: -10 (7% more now minus 17% less)

John Major: -12 (10% more now minus 22% less)

Tony Blair: -40 (6% more now minus 46%) less

This finding, of course, casts doubt on how valuable Blair will be to those he 
is supporting in the campaign for a soft Brexit.

ICM Unlimited interviewed an online sample of 2,049 adults aged 18+ on 9-11th 
December 2016. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results 
have been weighted to the profile of all GBadults. ICM is a member of the BPC 
and abides by its rules.
