From the industrial revolution, to the birth of the computer and the rise of 
acid house,Manchester <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester> has a history 
of creativity and innovation that is recognised worldwide.

But does the city have what it takes to become a global digital leader? Sir 
Howard Bernstein thinks so.

The Manchester council chief executive is highly-regarded across the country 
for the way he led the city’s rebirth over the past 20 years, encouraging the 
private and public sectors to work together.

He has overseen the transformation of the city centre following the IRA bomb 
of 1996 
<http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/new-video-ira-manchester-bomb-10850795>
, the creation ofSportcity <http://sportcity-manchester.com/> for the 2002 
Commonwealth Games, and the redevelopment of theSpinningfields business district
 
<http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/property/changing-face-spinningfields-how-thriving-10095225>
 – allowing Manchester to realistically stake a claim as the country’s second 
city.

Sir Howard said: “Over the past 40 years, I’ve witnessed a dramatic change in 
Manchester’s local economy. But today, the city is on the verge of assuming its 
potential as a global leader in the digital economy.”

According to Tech Nation, Manchester is the largest tech cluster outside 
London –with 51,901 employees in the sector 
<http://technorthhq.com/tech-nation-2016/>. It also has the UK’s second highest 
GVA growth – 92% between 2010 and 2014 – while having a total digital turnover 
at £2.2bn, the fourth highest in the UK.

The city’s civic and business leaders are now intent on ensuring Manchester 
realises its digital potential.

A £4m government grant is to be used to create a tech hub in the city centre. 
The plan, known asProject Forward 
<http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/500113/city_centre_regeneration/7238/project_forward>
, is aimed at nurturing start-ups, fostering collaboration and providing 
mentoring. It is hoped the hub will establish a focal point in the city for 
attracting inward investment from technology businesses while developing and 
retaining the country’s best software engineers and entrepreneurs.

The city has also secured £10m investment after a team from across industry, 
academia and the public sector won a competition to become the UK’s Internet of 
Things (IoT) City Demonstrator 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/manchester-wins-10m-prize-to-become-world-leader-in-smart-city-technology>
.

Manchester council worked with global technology giant Cisco UK, the 
University of Manchester and BT to put forward a proposal that uses technology 
to improve health and social care, energy and environmental management and 
transport.

The win will lead to the creation of a UK IoT Centre of Excellence at 
Manchester Science Partnerships’ city centre campus, which will provide the 
region’s start-ups and SMEs with access to a world-leading open innovation 
programme.

Sir Howard added: “The public and private sector has to work together to 
ensure that every Mancunian business has the opportunity and resources to reach 
its potential.”

Sir Howard has now thrown his weight behind business WiredScore as it launches 
in Manchester. Founded in New York three years ago, this rates and certifies 
buildings in terms of internet connectivity.

It is hoped the rating system will drive up the standard of connectivity in 
Manchester’s buildings, which in turn will help digital economic growth.

Manchester is the first UK city outside London in which WiredScore has 
launched, and the company is already working with some big names including 
Peel, Legal & General and Property Alliance.

Ahead of the launch, WiredScore commissioned YouGov to interview 306 
technology industry workers about their perceptions of Manchester and produced 
a report on how the city can grow into a digital leader.

According to the report, the most important factor for attracting tech 
companies to Manchester is closer links with the city’s universities – who 
could offer incentives such as business accelerators or grants.

Meanwhile, 58% of people interviewed said Manchester’s commercial landlords 
should offer flexible or short-term leases for start-ups, to attract them to 
the city.

The report also found that a local talent pool, the city’s industrial 
heritage, and its commercial real estate prices were key factors in what makes 
Manchester attractive as a tech hub.

WiredScore invited business and tech leaders to discuss the report at a 
roundtable event on Wednesday night.

Antony Whittle, from KPMG, said Manchester needed its own home-grown success 
story to help attract talent. He added: “If Manchester had a tech company that 
came up and took the world by storm, that would be a really useful anchor.”

Martin Bryant is co-founder of SpaceportX – one of a number of places in 
Manchester providing space and assistance for start-ups to flourish – along 
with Rise, The Sharp Project, Innospace and the Landing.

He said Manchester was already attractive to tech talent because it was a 
special city, adding: “There are a few obvious reasons why Manchester is 
already doing well – such as lower costs than London.

“But there is something unique about Manchester, a certain spirit that not 
many other places have. It makes it a different and exciting place to be based.

“I think maybe it’s been guilty of living off its reputation too much in the 
recent past – that there hasn’t been much substance here – but I feel like 
we’ve got good momentum now.”

Bryant also pointed to the work of support organisation Manchester Digital 
<https://www.manchesterdigital.com/>, which has helped foster an active tech 
community in the city and is trying to brand the city as a global tech leader.

He added: “Manchester Digital is running a campaign to attract people to the 
city by circulating testimonies of people who have moved here and thrived. More 
needs to be done to market Manchester as a place where individuals can come and 
thrive.”

William Newton, UK director for WiredScore, said that Manchester was becoming 
central to the UK’s digital evolution.

But he added: “It is essential that developers and landlords in Manchester 
consider the important role of technology in business and provide the 
connectivity that meets the current and future needs of their occupiers.

“Manchester has the potential to be a leading global capital of technology if 
it can demonstrate it’s a future-proofed choice for entrepreneurs and 
investors.”
