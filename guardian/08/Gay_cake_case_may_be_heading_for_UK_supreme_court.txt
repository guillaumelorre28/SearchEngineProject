Northern Ireland’s attorney general has applied for leave to appeal to the 
supreme court in London to review a ruling which found aBelfast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/belfast> bakery guilty of discrimination for 
refusing to bake a pro-gay marriage cake.

The intervention by John Larkin, QC the region’s top law officer, means the 
supreme court may review last month’s decision in the court of appeal in 
Belfast, whichupheld a guilty verdict

 against Ashers Bakery. The Northern Ireland appeal court will hear the 
attorney general’s application next Tuesday.

A spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office confirmed Larkin had used 
powers granted to him via theNorthern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> devolution settlement to seek 
a hearing in the highest court in the UK to reconsider the judgments of both 
the high court and appeal court in the province.

She told the Belfast Telegraph on Wednesday: “I can confirm that an 
application for leave to appeal to the supreme court has been listed for 
hearing on 22 November.”

This is the second time Larkin has intervened in the case. An earlier appeal 
this year wassuspended on a point of law that Larkin raised

.

In October, appeal judges in Belfast upheld a judgment made last year that 
Ashers Bakery had discriminated against a customer on the grounds of sexual 
orientation.
