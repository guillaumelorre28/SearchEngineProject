David Duke: Hillary Clinton 'should be getting the electric chair'

In Louisiana, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke was asked about an article 
on his website that made numerous and repeated references to “CNN Jews” in a 
story about a leaked video that showed Republican presidential nomineeDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> bragging about sexually 
assaulting women.

“Well, lemme tell you something - we have to start talking openly about any 
subject,” Duke said, “and there is a problem in America with a very strong, 
powerful, tribal group that dominates our media and dominates our international 
banking.”

“That’s the reality of it, and if we don’t understand that and face that, then 
we can’t deal with problems. I’m not opposed to all Jews,” Duke insisted, “but 
I’m against Jews or anybody else” whose loyalties lie “outside the United 
States.”

Pressed on what his conspiracism had to do with the religion of reporters, 
Duke doubled down.

“It’s got everything to do with it!” Duke said. “A good example is the fact, 
if you take a look at Trump and the neocons. We have a cabal in this country 
that literally controls the foreign policy in this country,” Duke continued, 
before going on a tirade about Hillary Clinton’s record on Syria.

“The lady should be getting the electric chair, getting charged with treason.”

At the historically black college where the Louisiana senate debate 
<http://www.fox8live.com/story/33592654/the-final-senate-debate-watch-here-live-at-7-pm>
 is currently being held, white supremacist and former imperial wizard of the 
Ku Klux Klan David Duke lashed out at the moderator for asking him about his 
conviction for tax fraud.

“You’re not even giving me a chance!” screamed Duke, when he attempted to 
avoid answering the question. “You’re not even giving me a chance!”

After calming down, Duke eventually addressed the question.

“Yes, the federal government targeted me,” Duke said. “I’ve got the tax form 
that was sent to me, they audited me, and they determined that I overpaid my 
taxes by $6,000! But you don’t know that, they don’t know that!”

Duke continues, saying that anybody who “tells the truth about what’s 
happening to this country” is “gonna be a target of the media, just like Donald 
Trump!”

Back to Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in 
Pensacola:

“We’re all leaders - we’re all leading this together,” Trump said, concluding 
his address. “Just think about what we could accomplish in the first one 
hundred days of a Trump administration.”

“We will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation. We will cancel 
the illegal Obama executive orders,” Trump continued. “We will rebuild our 
military and take care of our great veterans. We are going to provide school 
choice and bring an end to Common Core - bring our education local, We will 
support the great men and women of law enforcement.”

“People can dispute, people can argue, but they love this country,” Trump 
said, in a rare bid for unity. “She’s the candidate of yesterday - we are the 
movement of the future.”

“I’m asking you to dream big,” Trump concluded, “We’re gonna win - we’re gonna 
win.”

Trump’s exit is met with an array of fireworks and a blasting rendition of the 
national anthem.

As Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> campaigns in 
Pensacola, former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and current Republican 
senate candidate David Duke is facing off against his opponents for Louisiana’s 
open US Senate seat.

Despite urging by the moderator for the debate to not devolve into a 
referendum on Duke’s candidacy, the white supremacist has already been attacked 
by multiple other candidates.

“Yeah, I’m the bad guy because I defend the people who made this country 
great,” Duke said sarcastically. “You must respect the people who built this 
great nation and we shouldn’t face mass discrimination. That’s not a bad guy.”

Woman accusing Donald Trump of raping her at 13 cancels plan to go public

Rory Carroll

A woman who is suing Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> for allegedly raping her as a 
child abandoned a plan to speak publicly this afternoon, citing death threats.

The woman, known by the pseudonym Jane Doe, hid from media who were invited to 
her lawyer’s Los Angeles office for a press conference in which she was 
expected to reveal her identity.

candidate Donald Trump of sexual misconduct in 1994, when she was 13 years old.

Instead her attorney, Lisa Bloom, cancelled the event in a brief, apologetic 
statement to a phalanx of cameras.

“Jane Doe has received numerous threats today as have all the Trump accusers 
that I have represented. She has decided she is too afraid to show her face. 
She has been here all day, ready to do it, but unfortunately she is in terrible 
fear. We’re going to have to reschedule. I apologize to all of you who came. I 
have nothing further.”


Hours earlier Bloom, a prominent attorney, stoked such anticipation with the 
announced press conference that her firm’s website crashed. With just six days 
to the election and polls showing a tightening race the stakes could scarcely 
be higher.

The anticlimax was the latest twist to the explosive and so far 
unsubstantiated claim that the Republican presidential nominee raped Doe in 
1994 when she was 13 years old.

Speaking in Pensacola, Florida, an unusually tieless Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> - perhaps ready to cool his 
heels after his third campaign rally of the day - told the assembled audience 
of supporters and journalists that his campaign is a movement “about taking our 
government back.”

“You think Hillary’s gonna restore honesty to government? I don’t think so.”

Trump was greeted with a prolonged “Lock her up!” chant.

Ted Cruz to campaign for Donald Trump

We have apparently been transported to the land of Rand McNally, where they 
wear hats on their feet and hamburgers eat people, because Texas senator Ted 
Cruz has announced that he will campaign on Donald Trump’s behalf in the final 
week of the presidential campaign.

Tomorrow, Cruz will make appearances at two events on behalf of Trump, who 
called Cruz’s wife ugly and suggested that Cruz’s father conspired to 
assassinate John F. Kennedy. Cruz will joinMike Pence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence>, Trump’s running mate, in 
Prole, Iowa, and in Portage, Michigan, tomorrow, news that Pence’s press 
secretary has called “exciting.”
Marc Lotter (@marc_lotter) 
Should be an exciting day Thursday as @tedcruz <https://twitter.com/tedcruz>

After the bruising primary, Cruz punk’d Trump at the Republican national 
convention in July by refusing to endorse him onstage, instead urging 
Republicans to “vote your conscience.”

Cruz later endorsed Trump.

Clinton's 'October surprise' helps Trump in polls – but will it affect 
election day?

Mona Chalabi

The race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appears to be getting even 
closer with just six days left before the election. Anaverage of six different 
polls 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html>
 shows that Clinton is now just 1.7 percentage points ahead of Trump. But 
there’s still a lot of variation – one poll finds that Clinton is three points 
ahead, another finds that she is six pointsbehind Trump. Both surveys were 
conducted after news that the justice department had obtained a warrant to 
investigate an aide to Clinton’s emails, before which her lead was already 
shrinking.

That variation between polls isn’t surprising – it can be explained by the 
fact that different polls speak to different people. For example, the LA Times 
poll which has consistently found that Trump has more national support, 
includes one19-year-old black male 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html>
 respondent who consistently said he’ll vote for the Republican nominee. That 
one individual has a disproportionate impact because of a statistical process 
calledweighting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/01/political-polls-bad-for-democracy-heres-why-video>
 (where one respondent can end up representing hundreds of thousands of voters).

So, are current polls a good reflection of what will happen on election day? 
Historically, the answer is “not bad”, although they will probably be a much 
better indicator by the morning of 8 November rather than now. Clinton’s email 
scandal will probably go down in US political history as an “October surprise 
<http://politicaldictionary.com/words/october-surprise/>”, a last-minute news 
event that can cause a shift in public opinion. Those surprises –which have 
included Lyndon Johnson’s announcement of a halt in the bombing of North 
Vietnam in 1968, and the news of a drunk-driving charge for George W Bush in 
2000 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/october-surprises-dont-necessarily-sway-elections-or-occur-in-october.html>
 – typically don’t affect final outcomes all that much though, as the chart 
below shows. It compares polling a week before from election day and the 
morning of with the final voting outcome.

The only snag is the electoral college system. In 2000, it wasn’t just ABC and 
the Washington Post that predicted a Bush win – polling averages also showed 
the Republicanthree points 
<http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-october-surprises-move-the-polls/>
 ahead of Al Gore. Though both candidates ended up with 48% of the popular 
vote, that’s only after rounding. The actual result was Gore-Bush,48.4%-47.9% 
<http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&year=2000>. Bush 
ultimately became president because the distribution of those votes worked in 
his favour – he collected 271 of the 538 electoral college votes (270 are 
needed to win).

In Louisiana, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke was asked about an article 
on his website that made numerous and repeated references to “CNN Jews” in a 
story about a leaked video that showed Republican presidential nomineeDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> bragging about sexually 
assaulting women.

“Well, lemme tell you something - we have to start talking openly about any 
subject,” Duke said, “and there is a problem in America with a very strong, 
powerful, tribal group that dominates our media and dominates our international 
banking.”

“That’s the reality of it, and if we don’t understand that and face that, then 
we can’t deal with problems. I’m not opposed to all Jews,” Duke insisted, “but 
I’m against Jews or anybody else” whose loyalties lie “outside the United 
States.”

Pressed on what his conspiracism had to do with the religion of reporters, 
Duke doubled down.

“It’s got everything to do with it!” Duke said. “A good example is the fact, 
if you take a look at Trump and the neocons. We have a cabal in this country 
that literally controls the foreign policy in this country,” Duke continued, 
before going on a tirade about Hillary Clinton’s record on Syria.

“The lady should be getting the electric chair, getting charged with treason.”
 
At the historically black college where the Louisiana senate debate 
<http://www.fox8live.com/story/33592654/the-final-senate-debate-watch-here-live-at-7-pm>
 is currently being held, white supremacist and former imperial wizard of the 
Ku Klux Klan David Duke lashed out at the moderator for asking him about his 
conviction for tax fraud.

“You’re not even giving me a chance!” screamed Duke, when he attempted to 
avoid answering the question. “You’re not even giving me a chance!”

After calming down, Duke eventually addressed the question.

“Yes, the federal government targeted me,” Duke said. “I’ve got the tax form 
that was sent to me, they audited me, and they determined that I overpaid my 
taxes by $6,000! But you don’t know that, they don’t know that!”

Duke continues, saying that anybody who “tells the truth about what’s 
happening to this country” is “gonna be a target of the media, just like Donald 
Trump!”
 
Back to Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in 
Pensacola:

“We’re all leaders - we’re all leading this together,” Trump said, concluding 
his address. “Just think about what we could accomplish in the first one 
hundred days of a Trump administration.”

“We will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation. We will cancel 
the illegal Obama executive orders,” Trump continued. “We will rebuild our 
military and take care of our great veterans. We are going to provide school 
choice and bring an end to Common Core - bring our education local, We will 
support the great men and women of law enforcement.”

“People can dispute, people can argue, but they love this country,” Trump 
said, in a rare bid for unity. “She’s the candidate of yesterday - we are the 
movement of the future.”

“I’m asking you to dream big,” Trump concluded, “We’re gonna win - we’re gonna 
win.”

Trump’s exit is met with an array of fireworks and a blasting rendition of the 
national anthem.
 
As Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> campaigns in 
Pensacola, former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and current Republican 
senate candidate David Duke is facing off against his opponents for Louisiana’s 
open US Senate seat.

Despite urging by the moderator for the debate to not devolve into a 
referendum on Duke’s candidacy, the white supremacist has already been attacked 
by multiple other candidates.

“Yeah, I’m the bad guy because I defend the people who made this country 
great,” Duke said sarcastically. “You must respect the people who built this 
great nation and we shouldn’t face mass discrimination. That’s not a bad guy.”
 
A woman who is suing Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> for allegedly raping her as a 
child abandoned a plan to speak publicly this afternoon, citing death threats.

The woman, known by the pseudonym Jane Doe, hid from media who were invited to 
her lawyer’s Los Angeles office for a press conference in which she was 
expected to reveal her identity.

candidate Donald Trump of sexual misconduct in 1994, when she was 13 years old.

Instead her attorney, Lisa Bloom, cancelled the event in a brief, apologetic 
statement to a phalanx of cameras.

“Jane Doe has received numerous threats today as have all the Trump accusers 
that I have represented. She has decided she is too afraid to show her face. 
She has been here all day, ready to do it, but unfortunately she is in terrible 
fear. We’re going to have to reschedule. I apologize to all of you who came. I 
have nothing further.”


Hours earlier Bloom, a prominent attorney, stoked such anticipation with the 
announced press conference that her firm’s website crashed. With just six days 
to the election and polls showing a tightening race the stakes could scarcely 
be higher.

The anticlimax was the latest twist to the explosive and so far 
unsubstantiated claim that the Republican presidential nominee raped Doe in 
1994 when she was 13 years old.

Speaking in Pensacola, Florida, an unusually tieless Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> - perhaps ready to cool his 
heels after his third campaign rally of the day - told the assembled audience 
of supporters and journalists that his campaign is a movement “about taking our 
government back.”

“You think Hillary’s gonna restore honesty to government? I don’t think so.”

Trump was greeted with a prolonged “Lock her up!” chant.
 
Watch it live here:
 
We have apparently been transported to the land of Rand McNally, where they 
wear hats on their feet and hamburgers eat people, because Texas senator Ted 
Cruz has announced that he will campaign on Donald Trump’s behalf in the final 
week of the presidential campaign.

Tomorrow, Cruz will make appearances at two events on behalf of Trump, who 
called Cruz’s wife ugly and suggested that Cruz’s father conspired to 
assassinate John F. Kennedy. Cruz will joinMike Pence

Prole, Iowa, and in Portage, Michigan, tomorrow, news that Pence’s press 
secretary has called “exciting.”

After the bruising primary, Cruz punk’d Trump at the Republican national 
convention in July by refusing to endorse him onstage, instead urging 
Republicans to “vote your conscience.”

Cruz later endorsed Trump.
 
The race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appears to be getting even 
closer with just six days left before the election. Anaverage of six different 
polls 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html>
 shows that Clinton is now just 1.7 percentage points ahead of Trump. But 
there’s still a lot of variation – one poll finds that Clinton is three points 
ahead, another finds that she is six pointsbehind Trump. Both surveys were 
conducted after news that the justice department had obtained a warrant to 
investigate an aide to Clinton’s emails, before which her lead was already 
shrinking.

That variation between polls isn’t surprising – it can be explained by the 
fact that different polls speak to different people. For example, the LA Times 
poll which has consistently found that Trump has more national support, 
includes one19-year-old black male 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html>
 respondent who consistently said he’ll vote for the Republican nominee. That 
one individual has a disproportionate impact because of a statistical process 
calledweighting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/01/political-polls-bad-for-democracy-heres-why-video>
 (where one respondent can end up representing hundreds of thousands of voters).

So, are current polls a good reflection of what will happen on election day? 
Historically, the answer is “not bad”, although they will probably be a much 
better indicator by the morning of 8 November rather than now. Clinton’s email 
scandal will probably go down in US political history as an “October surprise 
<http://politicaldictionary.com/words/october-surprise/>”, a last-minute news 
event that can cause a shift in public opinion. Those surprises –which have 
included Lyndon Johnson’s announcement of a halt in the bombing of North 
Vietnam in 1968, and the news of a drunk-driving charge for George W Bush in 
2000 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/october-surprises-dont-necessarily-sway-elections-or-occur-in-october.html>
 – typically don’t affect final outcomes all that much though, as the chart 
below shows. It compares polling a week before from election day and the 
morning of with the final voting outcome.

The only snag is the electoral college system. In 2000, it wasn’t just ABC and 
the Washington Post that predicted a Bush win – polling averages also showed 
the Republicanthree points 
<http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-october-surprises-move-the-polls/>
 ahead of Al Gore. Though both candidates ended up with 48% of the popular 
vote, that’s only after rounding. The actual result was Gore-Bush,48.4%-47.9% 
<http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&year=2000>. Bush 
ultimately became president because the distribution of those votes worked in 
his favour – he collected 271 of the 538 electoral college votes (270 are 
needed to win).

Clinton's 'October surprise' helps Trump in polls – but will it affect 
election day?
