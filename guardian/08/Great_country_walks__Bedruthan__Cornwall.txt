In a nutshell


Despite Cornwall’s ever-growing popularity, long stretches of this 
exceptionally beautiful coast remain wild and unspoilt, perfect for exploring 
on foot. This route meanders past sandy beaches, a succession of 
picture-postcard coves, dramatic cliffs with distinctive marine flora and even 
a spectacular blowhole. Although it will take you all the way to Harlyn Bay, 
there’s a good bus service to whisk you back to the start if the weather closes 
in or you take too long exploring and need to head home.




Why it’s special


Jutting straight out into the Atlantic, the north Cornwall coast faces the 
full might of the ocean. For much of the year, gales howl, sending huge waves 
crashing against the cliffs. But step out on the right day on any stretch of 
the coast between Newquay and Padstow and you’ll be mesmerised by the colour of 
the sea and brilliance of the sand. Enjoy the beautiful beaches of Mawgan 
Porth, Carnewas and Bedruthan Steps, Porthcothan, Treyarnon Bay, Constantine 
Bay, Mother Ivey’s Bay and Harlyn Bay – among some of the most picturesque 
stretches of coastline that Cornwall has to offer.

This route also treats you to a Cornish classic, the clifftop vista over 
Bedruthan Steps, a dramatic beauty spot, with three distinctive pointed slate 
stacks jutting out along the beach (a word of warning though – don’t head into 
the surf as the rip currents are dangerous). There’s a National Trust visitor 
centre and café here. You’ll also walk round windswept Trevose Head, passing 
the lighthouse on the way.

Don’t be tempted to cut across the neck of Trevose Head or you’ll miss the 
striking geological feature on the western fringe, where the sea has worn away 
the slate beneath the cliff and caused a large patch of ground to collapse 
inland.

Peer over the edge of the chasm and you can listen to the sounds of waves echo 
from its depths. As you descend Trevose Head, check out more stunning views of 
the coast, stretching all the way from Hartland to St Ives. The walk finishes 
in Harlyn Bay, with its sheltered, family-friendly sandy beach, a great place 
to learn to surf.

weather’s kind.
