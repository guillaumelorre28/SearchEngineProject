Pedn Vounder, Penwith, west Cornwall

This dramatic bay is protected by the towering granite outcrop of Logan’s 
Rock. In summer, the sandbars create shallow blue tidal lagoons that warm up in 
the afternoon sun. The water is crystal clear and this is definitely a 
clothing-optional beach. There are views out over to Porthcurno and theMinack 
cliff-top theatre <http://www.minack.com/>. There’s also a wonderful wild 
campsite <http://www.treenfarmcampsite.co.uk/>and lovely café on the cliffs 
above at the hamlet of Treen.

This is the real Land’s End: wild and rugged with great caves. The amount of 
sand comes and goes, according to the winter storms, but there’s a waterfall 
and stream for kids to play in. The real attraction is the amazing Song of the 
Sea eyelet rock arch. First bathe in the shallow rock pool, then snorkel 
through the sea tunnel, admiring the astonishing coralline pink walls while the 
water thunders and booms.

Set among the wild flower covered rocks of the Lizard Peninsula’s breathtaking 
and rugged coastline, popular Kynance Cove was long loved by the Romantic poets 
and painters. Its clear, azure water is perfect for snorkelling and swimming 
and the extraordinary, serpentine-rock towers encourage dare-devil jumpers. At 
low tide, you walk around to the north bay opposite Asparagus Island where 
there are sea caves, rock pools and jumps.

Port Gaverne, near Port Isaac, has something for everyone. There’s a wonderful 
inlet with a small safe beach for children and a rocky peninsula with 
increasingly high ledges for the brave to jump from. Build your confidence, and 
even practise some dives. Strong swimmers can head through the “canyon” and 
enter the huge sea caves to the right.

This is a fantastic wild and remote low-tide sand beach. It’s situated below 
the somewhat eerie GCHQ “listening station”. A favourite approach is along the 
cliff path from Duckpool, two miles to the south - also a wonderful low-tide 
sandy beach with freshwater pool and stream, and ice cream van – perfect for 
families.

bluebells in spring, with a waterfall at the end. This is smuggler’s Cornwall

Hidden on Devon’s wild north coast you will find one of Exmoor’s best secret 
swimming beaches. Nestling beneath wooded cliffs between Watermouth and Combe 
Martin, this deep, double cove has many caves to explore, and two lovely 
secluded shingle beaches offering sheltered swimming. There’s even an island 
lookout to climb.

High moors give way to dizzying drops of 800ft east of Martinhoe, and Woody 
Bay opens up dramatically beneath the trees. Far below, the boulder-strewn 
beach is almost unvisited, save for gulls and guillemots. An ancient cobbled 
track winds down past a limekiln and waterfall. Look carefully and you’ll see 
the remains of the old pier. Look beyond the waterfall and you will find a 
semi-natural rock pool, offering a secret place to plunge and swim.

Prawle Point is a wild and rugged headland with tiny white coves strung along 
the coastline like pearls. This is the best of a trio of wonderful white coves. 
The beach surface is made up of tiny round white beads of quartz, smooth under 
foot. A Bronze Age field ridges line the slopes above. A track leads down the 
cliff-side and you drop on to the beach with the help of a rope. Several 
offshore rock islands make this a fun place to play.
