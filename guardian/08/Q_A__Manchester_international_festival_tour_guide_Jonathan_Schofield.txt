Why get into guided touring?
It’s self-expression. You can take a theme and run with it; Manchester can be 
Marx and Engels [who began writing The Communist Manifesto in the city’s 
Chetham’s Library], it can be a radical city, an artistic city – and when 
you’re engaging an audience, it’s like being an actor with facts.

How has the Mif touring programme evolved?
This year, Mif wanted a walk which would tie in with some of the major themes 
of the festival. I’ve tried to knit together the things that are happening 
within the context of Manchester.

 A hidden Manchester gem: Chetham’s Library. 
You’ve called it Radicals, Pioneers and Rabbit Holes. What’s the narrative 
behind it?
Simply, it’s the fantasy and reality that is Manchester. There’s always been 
escapism involved in the north-west of England: take Lewis Carroll, who came 
from Daresbury near Warrington, or The Smiths. But there’s also Manchester’s 
hard, cruel reality. We’ll be weaving ideas of radicalism and fantasy with the 
industrialised and post-industrialised world – I don’t want to give too much 
away, but and we’ll be going into the dark and scaring the whatnots off you.

And how does the rest of the festival’s programme come into it?
The theme throughout is the despoilation of the planet by the human race. 
Manchester holds up a mirror to the world; we were the first people to 
completely destroy a natural environment. In the space of 50 years, we went 
from somewhere that looked like Ludlow to an industrialised hellhole – but one 
full of humanity and ideas. I’ll be referring directly to Damon Albarn, Moira 
Buffini and Rufus Norris’s wonder.land and The Skriker with Maxine Peake.

Can you tell us your personal favourite stops on the tour?
No way! All I’ll say is: we’ll go up, we’ll down and we’ll go to the river.

Were there any particularly staggering facts or stories you came across while 
researching the tour?
The theme is a north-west-based Alice who falls down a hole and wakes up to an 
industrial maelstrom. The world changes in that moment – and so the staggering 
fact, I suppose, is that before the industrial revolution, we were the least 
populated major county in terms of size and scale. Within 50 years we were more 
populated than Middlesex and London.

What’s the best secret place in Manchester you’ve discovered during your time 
as a tour guide?
For a long time, I had no idea that we had one of Britain’s finest medieval 
structures within the city. It was the library in Chetham’s School of Music. 
People can go in there and put their hand on a Samuel Johnson dictionary or a 
Matthew Paris manuscript. There’s a table that the public can sit around and it 
could be a seat Benjamin Franklin sat in, or Benjamin Disraeli, or William 
Gladstone. That’s a beautiful moment. It’s not like going to something such as 
the Tower of London, which is seen everywhere on pictures and TV; it’s about 
being surprised and delighted.
