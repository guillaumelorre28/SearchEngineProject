The United Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations> has 
temporarily suspended aid deliveries in Nigeria’s north-eastern state of Borno, 
the former stronghold of jihadists Boko Haram, after a humanitarian convoy was 
attacked, the UN children’s agency Unicef said on Thursday.

 Unicef said in a statement that unknown assailants attacked the convoy on 
Thursday as it returned to Maiduguri from delivering aid in Bama, injuring a 
Unicef employee and an International Organization for Migration contractor.

 “The United Nations has temporarily suspended humanitarian assistance 
missions pending review of the security situation,” it said.

Nearly a quarter of a million children in Borno suffer from life-threatening 
malnourishment and around one in five will die if they do not receive 
treatment, Unicef said earlier this month.

Médecins Sans Frontières said on Wednesday that severely malnourished children 
were dying in large numbers in north-eastNigeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria>, where food supplies are close to 
running out.

 By 2014, Boko Haram controlled territory around the size of Belgium in 
north-east Nigeria until most of it was recaptured last year by the Nigerian 
army and troops from neighboring countries.

 More than 15,000 people have been killed and at least 2 million displaced by 
Boko Haram’s insurgency in Nigeria. The group carries out suicide bombings in 
north-east Nigeria and neighboring Cameroon, Niger and Chad.
