It was Osama bin Laden <https://www.theguardian.com/world/osamabinladen> who 
first earned Sudan a place on the US blacklist for state sponsors of terrorism.

The al-Qaida leader had been living in Khartoum for five years when America 
imposed a trade embargo and froze the government‚Äôs assets in the US in 1997.

Nineteen years later, Sudan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan> remains 
on the blacklist alongside only two other states: Iran and Syria. A whole 
generation has grown up knowing nothing else, and while political analysts 
argue over whether sanctions help or hurt the current government, the crippling 
effect on the local population is undeniable.

As part of a debate on Twitter curated by @Sudan_Voices, hundreds of people 
have been sharing their experiences of#SudanUnderSanction 
<https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=sudanundersanction>, showing how the 
restrictions affect their lives.

They report blocked websites and services, difficulty travelling, limited 
scholarships and job opportunities, and a ongoing sense of isolation from the 
rest of the world.

Because of restrictions on trade, local businesses also struggle to import 
goods and make international payments due to bans on foreign money transfers.

These restrictions have been tightened since 2014, when French bank BNP 
Paribas was fined

$8.8bn

 Young people in Sudan also described daily isolation from the global 
community through blocked websites, phone apps and services, having to turn to 
virtual private networks (VPN) and proxies to trick servers about their 
location.

No transfers

People living in Sudan are also barred from online work that requires 
international money transfers for payment, directly restricted under the US 
Office of Foreign Assets Control.

PsychoTheRapist (@Danceremi_) 
@Sudan_Voices <https://twitter.com/Sudan_Voices> No payment from online jobs 
because no bank transfers, and opening a bank account here is useless.

For people who try to make their living online, like Sudanese video blogger 
Muaz Osman, who has 38,718 YouTube subscribers and more than 2.6m views, it is 
almost impossible to make profit from digital content.

engagement, such as Twitter Analytics, are also unavailable to local users.

These restrictions are particularly damaging for local software developers.

Those who try and find a better life abroad say they remain limited by strict 
visa restrictions and limited scholarship opportunities.

As a response, many Sudanese people have called for modernised sanctions, 
which target governing individuals and entities, particularly those that serve 
to profit from Sudan‚Äôs monopolised economy.


The Enough Project,  <http://www.enoughproject.org/>an NGO focused on ending 
genocide and crimes against humanity in Sudan and Congo, recently released a 
report <http://www.enoughproject.org/> proposing a new strategy for targeted 
restrictions that could minimise the negative consequences for average citizens.

They recommend sanctions that more sharply target the military and financial 
assets of those most responsible for the continuing conflict in the nation.

But for those in Sudan, there seems to be only one solution to the 
ever-growing economic strife and isolation - as this user suggests.
