In a nutshell


This is a picturesque, circular walk through the beautiful countryside of the 
Essex-Suffolk border, known as Constable Country after the English romantic 
painterJohn Constable <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/constable>, who 
lived here and was inspired to paint by the tranquil scenery around the river 
Stour.

Crossing water meadows, babbling brooks and meandering along the river, it’s a 
lovely route through a quintessentially English landscape of gentle farmland, 
dotted with charming villages.

Why it’s special


The gentle rolling hills and picturesque meadows in the Dedham Vale Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty and Stour valley have been hugely popular with 
painters for centuries and as you set out along this route you will see why. 
Little seems to have changed since Constable painted here almost 200 years ago 
– you’ll recognise the calm of the countryside depicted in works such asThe 
Haywain. Bridge Cottage at Flatford is now a museum dedicated to Constable’s 
work. Among other artists from the area was Alfred Munnings and his grand 
former home near Dedham is now The Munnings Museum, housing many of his 
paintings, including those of his favourite subjects – horses and horse fairs. 
Although the walk is easy and mostly flat, there are many stiles along the way 
so it’s not suitable for anyone with limited mobility.

Reward yourself


With open fires, wooden floors, comfy sofas and a seasonal menu inspired by 
Italy, theSun Inn <http://www.thesuninndedham.com/> on the High Street in 
Dedham has been a popular watering hole for centuries. There are rooms if you 
want to stay overnight too (thesuninndedham.com).
