The final stretch of New York’s High Line 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2008/oct/27/heritage-newyork> 
opened on Saturday,completing a 15-year project 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/apr/25/new-york-high-line-park> that 
has transformed the once derelict overhead railway into an urban park.

Starting at Gansevoort Street, in the Meatpacking District, the High Line now 
runs as far north as 34th street, finishing where the line once terminated at 
Hudson Yards.

The project began in 1999 when the Friends of the High Line – founded by local 
residents Joshua David and Robert Hammond – fought to protect the line from 
demolition.

Now, each year close to five million people visit the walkway, which is lined 
with trees, grasses and shrubs and has become a site for artistic commissions, 
events and activities ranging from concerts to meditation.

 Visitors to the High Line sit on “conversation benches” as the sun sets over 
New York. 
Since the first sections opened, the project has been heralded as a model 
example of urban redevelopment and the line has contributed to the 
gentrification of Manhattan’s Lower West Side. It has also inspired similar 
projects around the world, such as the Petite Ceinture in Paris and the 
Chapultepec Project in Mexico City.

foreground, looping around the rail terminus. 
Among the features of the final stretch of the High Line – known as the Rail 
Yards section – is the 11th Avenue Bridge, an elevated ‘catwalk’ from which 
visitors can view the park, the cityscape and the Hudson River and the Pershing 
Square Beams; and a children’s play area constructed from the original line’s 
framework of steel beams and girders.

Speaking ahead of the opening ceremony, Mayor de Blasio said: “What was once a 
dilapidated train track has been transformed into a world-renowned park, thanks 
to the dedicated efforts of two neighbourhood residents and a strong 
public-private partnership. The idea – and later the reality – of the High Line 
filled a void in the community by providing free open space for all of its 
residents to enjoy.”
