The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe has asked the thousands of 
“water protectors” gathered in encampments along the Missouri river to “go 
home” after the US Army Corps of Engineersdenied a permit

Archambault thanked the thousands of Native American and environmental 
activists who travelled to North Dakota to help the tribe fight back against 
the pipeline, which they feared would contaminate their water source and 
destroy sacred sites.

But after the “huge victory” of the Army Corps decision, Archambault said: 
“There’s no need for the water protectors or for anyone to be putting ourselves 
in unsafe environments.

“It’s time now,” he said. “It’s time to go home.”

 Dave Archambault: ‘It’s time now … it’s time to go home.’ 
Archambault’s directive was rejected by many long-term water protectors, 
however, as the camps hunkered down amid a fierce blizzard.


“The chairman does not tell us what to do. The chairman is not in charge of 
the camp,” said Ladonna Bravebull Allard. “We stand. We don’t move. We don’t go 
nowhere.”

Allard, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, founded the first of 
several “spiritual camps”, known as Sacred Stone, in April.

“We came to fight a black snake,” she said, referring to the pipeline. “Until 
it’s dead, we stand. That doesn’t mean put it five miles up the river. That 
means kill it dead.”

Many at the camps were suspicious that the permit denial was a “trick” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/05/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock-protest-trump>
 intended to convince activists to leave so that the pipeline construction 
could continue unchallenged. Others feared that the Trump administration would 
reverse the Army Corps’ decision, or that the company would sue.

Though an administrative reversal would be subject to court review, according 
to the tribe’s lawyer, the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, said in 
a statement on Monday that it intended to “complete construction of the 
pipeline without any additional rerouting”.

Archambault argued that it would not attempt to drill without the permit, 
known as an easement, because it would jeopardize the company’s investments.

Xhopakelxhit, who is Nuu Chah Nulth, Coast Salish, and Cree, said that 
opinions in the camp were divided about what to do next, with some wanting to 
stay and fight and others wanting to respect the wishes of the tribal 
leadership.

“He’s trusting bureaucracy and the government,” she said of Archambault. “When 
has the government ever treated Natives fairly?”

Xhopakelxhit also criticized the idea that rerouting the pipeline constituted 
a victory.

“If it’s not good for your people, Dave, then it shouldn’t be good for 
anyone,” she said.

Howaste Wakiya, an enrolled member of the coastal band of the Chumash Nation, 
rejected the idea that Archambault could direct the movement, which has 
garnered support from hundreds of indigenous tribes, as well as climate change 
activists, celebrities, and, this week, hundreds of US veterans.

“It was started in prayer, not in [the chairman’s] office,” he said. 

However individual activists choose to proceed, few will be leaving 
immediately. The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning on Monday 
for much of the state. Several inches of snow and wind gusts of up to 50mph 
were predicted through Tuesday evening.
