Entry to Dreamland <https://www.dreamland.co.uk/> will be free from 18 June, 
after the Margate theme park announced a new plan to attract more visitors – 
just weeksafter entering administration 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-36408268>.

The announcement comes as the seaside attraction celebrates its first 
birthday, following an £18m restoration and a relaunch in June 2015. But 
despite positive press coverage it has been a tough opening year for Dreamland.

The park has struggled to draw enough visitors – 50% fewer than anticipated 
over its first summer season – and in January its operator Sands Heritage was 
given five years to repay £3m debts. On 27 May, administrators were called in, 
though the park will remain open while they look for a new operator.

The new price plan allows free entrance to the park and entertainment at its 
bandstand, and visitors can then either pay per ride (with rides priced 
individually, eg £3 for the dodgems) or purchase a wristband (£8 for those 
under 1.25m tall, £12 for those over) for unlimited rides.

Eddie Kemsley, CEO at Dreamland said: “Dreamland’s management team made this 
decision after all pricing models were trialled during 2015. We received lots 
of customer feedback on pricing and we listened. We believe this new pricing 
model is the best option and will please as many of our guests as possible.”

Dreamland would not comment on its financial situation, but told the Guardian 
that the idea to go free has the full endorsement of its administrators. 
According to Dreamland, over 300,000 guests have visited the park’s paid areas 
since opening.
