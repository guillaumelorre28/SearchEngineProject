Apple is investigating a report from an Australian man who claimed his iPhone 7
 <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone-7> caught fire and destroyed 
his car, the company said on Friday.

Surfer Mat Jones told Channel 7 News  
<http://www.news.com.au/technology/apple-investigating-report-aussie-surfers-iphone-7-ignited-and-burnt-out-his-car/news-story/684a2ca848f41ce30af71225a358d3db>
that he had gone into water off a New South Wales beach and left his new iPhone 
7, bought last week, wrapped in a pair of trousers in his car on the beach.

He said that when he returned from the water he saw smoke billowing out from 
the car. “As I looked into my car you could not see inside the car, like all 
the windows were just black.”

Footage taken from another phone showed the front seats, dashboard and stick 
melted and charred, and Jones said that he felt “pretty much just like a big 
heat wave just came out of the car”.

Eventually the surfer was able to remove what was left of his clothes. “Ash 
was just coming from inside the pants, which then, once you wrapped open the 
pants the phone was just melting inside of it.”

On a video taken to record the damage, Jones points out the phone: “There’s 
the phone, total burnout.”

Jones said that he had not dropped the phone or physically damaged it, as 
happened to a Sydney man who fell off his bike andsuffered burns from an iPhone

. He also said that he had not used a non-Apple charging device.

A spokeswoman for Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> said 
the company was investigating the complaint. “We’re in touch with the customer 
and we’re looking into it,” she said.
