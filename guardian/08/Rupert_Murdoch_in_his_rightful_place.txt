Rupert Murdoch doesn’t have to beg for favours (I never claimed Downing Street 
does what I say,Letters, 20 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/19/rupert-murdoch-i-have-never-asked-for-anything-from-any-prime-minister>
). Every prime minister since Thatcher has made it their business to anticipate 
Murdoch’s every whim. They never forget it’s the Sun wot won it.

• Nice to see that the Guardian has learned an important lesson from the Sun 
newspaper. If a prominent figure likeRupert Murdoch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/rupert-murdoch> has a correction to make, 
then print it in an unobtrusive place like the bottom corner of the letters 
page.

• Whether nor the poppy is a political symbol (FA to appeal after Fifa impose 
£35,000 fine over poppies, 20 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/19/fifa-fines-english-fa-poppies-scotland>
), Fifa’s actions would be more consistent if they also fined FAs for the 
political and religious symbols and songs paraded and sung before every match.

• It’s been a difficult few weeks as a follower of England cricket (Sport, 
20 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/20/england-india-cricket-test-series-defeat>
). One thing has, thankfully, as ever, been reliable: the excellent reporting 
of Vic Marks. Please keep selecting him.

• After reading the Guardian every day for the last six months, I am now in
