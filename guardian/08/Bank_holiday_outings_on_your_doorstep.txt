Those craving fresh air or a stress-free family day out should get the tram to 
Altrincham and amble over toDunham Massey 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-dunhammassey.htm>
, a pretty National Trust estate and adjoining village. You'll find ducks to 
feed, parkland and deer to marvel at and, if you're happy to pay the entry fees 
(adults £10/children £5), an interesting Georgian mansion house and formal 
gardens to explore. For sustenance – and particularly superb traditional cakes 
– head to the quaint ramshackle Lavender Barn Tea Room (Dog Farm, School Lane, 
+44 (0)161 941 2153) or the Swan With Two Nicks (Park Lane, Little Bollington, 
+44 (0)161 928 2914), a cosy pub that serves Dunham Massey Brewery beers (
dunhammasseybrewing.co.uk <http://www.dunhammasseybrewing.co.uk/>). There is 
also good speciality and delicatessen food shopping, locally, at Little Heath 
Farm Shop (littleheathfarmshop.co.uk <http://www.littleheathfarmshop.co.uk/>, 
+44 (0)161 928 0520) and Red House Farm (+44 (0)161 941 3480,redhousefarm.co.uk 
<http://www.redhousefarm.co.uk/>). Both have cute animals on display to keep 
the kids entertained.

 Henleaze Lake. Photograph: Diana Taylor 
If you know someone who is a member of Henleaze Lake's swimming club, 
celebrating its 93rd season this year, be extra nice to them. Waiting lists for 
membership to the club, which gives access to a flooded quarry-turned-lake 
hidden behind suburban houses in chi-chi suburb Henleaze, have been up to five 
years long. It's well worth it for a chance to picnic beneath weeping willows, 
daringly dive from three high boards, or wallow in the cold, weed-fringed water 
with outdoor swimmers of all ages. With no music or barbecues allowed plus 
old-style wooden changing rooms, it's got a delightful 1950s air.

If you don't know a member, the best bet for some alfresco water action is to 
jump on a train to Weston-super-Mare (try Sand Bay, where you can actually 
swim) or Portishead for its modern lido (portisheadopenairpool.org.uk 
<http://www.portisheadopenairpool.org.uk/>), lovely cafe and views over the 
Bristol Channel to Wales (on a clear day).

Glasgow
 Crocodile Rock, Millport. 
A trip to Millport is a trip back in time to a place where a paddle steamer is 
a legitimate form of transport, sweeties are sold by the quarter and holidays 
are taken within a 50-mile radius of your home. Nestled in the Firth of Clyde 
on the Isle of Cumbrae, Millport (millport.org <http://millport.org/>) has been 
a destination for Glaswegians going doon the watter on the bank holiday for 
generations. Attractions include cycle-friendly roads, decent pubs, stunning 
views, crazy golf and a rock painted to look like a crocodile (official name 
Crocodile Rock, obviously). Later in the summer you can take the heritage route 
of the Waverley, the world's last working paddle steamer, from Glasgow and 
back. For now the island can be easily reached with a train from Glasgow 
Central to Largs and then a 10-minute ferry ride. Bikes can be hired and 
ice-creams purchased in the town.
• Caledonian MacBrayne runs ferries from Largs to Cumbrae (adult £4.90 return, 
child £2.45,calmac.co.uk <http://www.calmac.co.uk/destinations/cumbrae.htm>);

Edinburgh
 Inverleith Park. 
The scenes of camaraderie on display among the hordes of sunshine groupies 
that descend upon Princes Street Gardens, the Meadows or Holyrood Park are a 
joy to behold; however, square inches tend to be at a premium on the warmest 
days. No less compelling are the striking panoramic views of the city to be had 
at Inverleith Park, adjacent to the decadent Botanic Gardens in the Stockbridge 
area of town. And there's space in which to revel, lots of it. One of the 
largest urban parks in Scotland, tree-lined walkways and playing fields for a 
variety of sports abound, and a pond rather magnanimously shared by the ducks 
and the swans –it's as good a picnic setting as any.

Newcastle
 Jesmond Dene Park. 
For a Saturday quayside stroll, wander along to the Tyne Bar in the Ouseburn 
Valley for their first Easter Day Market (noon-6pm, Maling St,thetyne.com 
<http://www.thetyne.com/>). For Sunday serenity, slide down to the £6m 
refurbished Jesmond Dene Park for the best suntrap in the city, with new 
landscaping, coffee shop and pets corner, – including a cute, white, one-horned 
pygmy goat we've told the kids is a unicorn (jesmonddene.org.uk 
<http://www.jesmonddene.org.uk/>). Still want more egg action on Monday? Bring 
the brood down to Ponteland Park for the Great Easter Egg Hunt (in aid of 
charity Legacare) with rides, bonnet parade, mad hatters' party and prizes for 
best fancy dress (11am-3pm, West Road, Ponteland,visitnorthumberland.com

Leeds
 Kirkstall Abbey. 
You don't have to travel far from the centre of Leeds to enjoy the beautiful 
outdoors. A 10-minute bus journey or short hop from Headingley train station 
takes you to Kirkstall Abbey, a Cistercian ruin that dates back 850 years and 
provides a stunning backdrop for a picnic. With the Aire running alongside, you 
can enjoy a riverside stroll while soaking in the sunshine and sheer romance of 
the surroundings. Then find shade in the family-friendly Abbey House museum 
over the road, where kids love dressing up and exploring the replica Victorian 
streets, while bigger kids refuel in the cafe with coffee and cake.

London
 Polly the Polish hen, Mudchute Farm. 
Those clever East Enders – pretending to the world that their part of town is 
all bricks, mortar and tough streets so no one notices they've got two of the 
lushest open spaces in the capital. At 32 acres, the Isle of Dogs' Mudchute 
Farm is London's largest city farm and, aside from its 200-plus animals, it 
boasts the glorious Mudchute Kitchen cafe and extraordinary views of Canary 
Wharf. Meanwhile, along the river, the Thames Barrier Park has rightly won 
awards for its playful waves of hedges, fountains to romp in, and Green Dock, 
whose micro-climate hosts an uplifting array of colourful plants and 
butterflies.

Liverpool
 Otterspool Promenade. Photograph: Sue Adair 
The riverside walk that is Otterspool Promenade runs from Aigburth to 
Grassendale in south Liverpool and is a gem for those who don't know the outer 
suburbs of the city.

The three-mile walk along the River Mersey has parkland, a fantastic 
children's play area and free parking; all with views across to the Wirral. The 
prom's wide open space is perfect for kite flying or picnicking, and many 
people use the prom for running, cycling or simply for a long, uninterrupted 
stroll along the river – given a good hour or more you can get within 15 
minutes of the Albert Dock, walking toward the city centre.

Birmingham

Birmingham is a surprisingly green city – often you have to trek across acres 
of lushly landscaped mature parkland in order to get to your own little piece 
of concrete. If you're in the city centre then a trip to the beer garden of the 
Prince of Wales (behind the National Indoor Arena) is a must, a tiny Victorian 
pub that counts Lady Gaga (honest) as a recent convert. If you have kids, or 
just a childish disposition, then the Nature Centre is the sweetest and tiniest 
place to see animals in Brum. Monkeys, owls, otters and meerkats. You can get 
an ice cream too.

Sheffield
 Ladies Spring Woods. 
The Steel City lost its lido in the 1980s during the last age of austerity, 
and it's a long haul to the sea by public transport, but Sheffielders take 
comfort from living in the most densely wooded city in Europe. There are 170 
woodlands with an estimated 2.5m trees, in whose green shade you can while away 
the bank holiday, but if you're up for it, the Round Sheffield Walk is quite a 
challenge. It takes in Sheffield's south-west corner, from Endcliffe Park with 
its swings and busy cafe through Whiteley Woods and the Porter Valley to 
Ringinglow and down the Limb (the boundary between Mercia and Northumbria), 
through Ecclesall Woods – my patch, and you're welcome for a brew – past 
Beauchief Abbey to Gleadless. It's 14 miles, but you can opt out anywhere and 
take a bus home.
