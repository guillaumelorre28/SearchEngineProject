The final analysis

It was a much-improved effort today from the Australians, who let the tail wag 
far more than they should have, but bowled excellently to the top order to have 
South Africa 117-5 before Faf du Plessis dragged the rest along with him as he 
scored a resourceful and stirring century. His undefeated 118 was the highlight 
of his team’s 259-9 declared, while Stephen Cook regained some confidence with 
40 at the top of the order.

The Australian bowlers were led by Josh Hazlewood’s 4-68 off 22 overs, while 
Mitch Starc (2-78 off 23) and Jackson Bird (2-57 off 16) also had their 
moments. Nathan Lyon got a pass mark, and did break through for his first Test 
wicket in yonks, and would you believe it came from a Matthew Wade stumping? 
Surely it’ll be a full moon in Adelaide tonight. Wade also pouched four catches 
in a solid performance with the gloves.

Matt Renshaw and Usman Khawaja will enter tomorrow with a decent measure of 
confidence given the way they handles those 12 overs, and we’ll be here on the 
Guardian OBO to take you through all of the action. Thanks for your company 
today!

I’ll leave you with Australia’s biggest positive:
Charlie Reynolds (@cwjreynolds) 
Good to hear from Channel 9 that surviving the opening 10 overs without losing 
a wicket means Australian cricket is fixed.#AUSvSA

Stumps on day one - Australia get to stumps without loss

12th over: Australia 14-0 (Khawaja 3, Renshaw 8)

And that is stumps on day one. It ended with a piece of evil genius from Faf 
du Plessis, who declared nine down knowing that David Warner was off the ground 
receiving treatment on an injury, which has meant Usman Khawaja needed to open 
with debutant Matt Renshaw. It’s been a nervy little period for both batsmen 
but Renshaw has been superb so far. He’ll enter tomorrow with fewer nerves than 
he might have and has taken part in an aborbing and fun day of Test cricket.

11th over: Australia 14-0 (Khawaja 3, Renshaw 8)

Shamsi gets another go with the penultimate over of the first day and Khawaja 
is nothing less than disciplined in the face of the circumstances and some 
probing spin bowling, but does drive attractively for one to give Renshaw one 
ball of spin to face. He’s not entirely comfortable but survives it.

10th over: Australia 13-0 (Khawaja 2, Renshaw 8)

This is better from Rabada now, who takes the ball away from Renshaw and 
almost draws an outside edge. It moved too much, if anything. It’s a maiden 
from the Proteas speedster and Renshaw does well to hang in there.

9th over: Australia 13-0 (Khawaja 2, Renshaw 8)

Faf is throwing the kitchen sink at them now and introduces Tabraiz Shamsi for 
some left-arm wrist spin. If you haven’t seen him before, imagine a slightly 
less exaggerated Paul ‘Frog in the Blender’ Adams. His opening over has all 
sorts, and Khawaja misses out on punishing a long hop, but it’sinteresting at 
the very least and a maiden.

8th over: Australia 13-0 (Khawaja 2, Renshaw 8)

With Kyle Abbott failing to make inroads Faf throws the ball to Kagiso Rabada, 
who might get three overs in here and put the frighteners into this improvised 
opening pair. One thing I will say about Renshaw is that his wide stance – with 
bat tapped between well-spread legs – is a nice change from the robotic styles 
elsewhere in Australian cricket. It clearly works for him. Rabada’s first over 
reaches no great heights.

7th over: Australia 12-0 (Khawaja 1, Renshaw 8)

Calm down Adelaide, there’s no need for Bronx cheers when Usman Khawaja gets 
the first runs of the bat. What do you want, another collapse? Renshaw is thus 
on strike to Philander and does the job the crowd prematurely saluted him for 
before, glancing well to pick up a boundary and start his account. There’s a 
lovely boyish smile once he’s done haring between the wickets and realises he’s 
passed his first test. A ball later Philander almost kisses the outside edge of 
the bat with an excellent off-cutter but Renshaw recovers by clipping four more 
through square leg. An edge falls just short of second slip but it’s determined 
stuff from Renshaw. He doesn’t look out of place at all.

6th over: Australia 3-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

More drama! The Adelaide crowd are cheering their heads off when Renshaw 
glances two to get off the mark but there’s no bat on it, so Richard 
Kettleborough does a wonderful heel turn and extravagantly signals the leg 
byes, grinning devilishly as the punters turn on him. Renshaw has played the 
most assured zero not out I’ve ever seen. It’s better than Rob Quiney’s debut 
nine and Usman Khawaja’s career-starting 37 combined.

5th over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

Another maiden to Philander. This is...it’s like REAL TEST MATCH BATTING from 
Australia. What is going on? Maybe Warner’s absence is a blessing in disguise.

4th over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

Someone has had a word to Kyle Abbott after his wasted energy an over ago and 
he’s pursuing a stump-to-stump line to Renshaw, even with his high-looping 
bouncers. As ever with the early stages of a Proteas bowling effort, the other 
eye-catching sight is Quinton de Kock writhing in pain after wearing a ball to 
the fingers when it dips late. Renshaw might have got a tickle on the final 
delivery, which strayed down leg, but there’s no contact to pick up his first 
runs at Test level. Maiden.

A counter-attack on Faf’s tactical genius?
Dan Liebke (@LiebCricket) 
Khawaja should now retire hurt. #AUSvSA

3rd over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

Oof, Philander sends an absolute peach past the outside edge of Khawaja here, 
shaping it away beautifully towards a stacked slips cordon. That injudicious 
prod done with, Khawaja then follows the lead of his junior partner and tries 
to leave where possible. It’s a maiden. “If he’s half as good as Matthew Hayden 
Australians will be happy,” says Shane Warne of Matt Renshaw. Really? I think 
this team needs someone averaging more than 25, but I could be wrong.

2nd over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

Renshaw is probably a bundle of nerves her but he’s calm and leaves well as 
Kyle Abbott steams in and pursues a line outside off stump. In actual fact he 
barely has to play at it in this maiden over from Abbott, which never truly 
tests the youngster. Odd. Surely you’d attacking middle stump at this point?

1st over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

Just to add to the drama, Vernon Philander starts with a no ball and although 
it’s wide, Khawaja almost takes a swing at it. It’s a nervy period for Khawaja 
but he negotiates the rest of the over and Renshaw is up next and set to face 
his first delivery in Tests. David Warner looks on from the sheds, utterly 
miffed. What a blunder by the Australian support staff.

DRAMA! South Africa declared so David Warner couldn't open!

Oh this is brilliant skullduggery! David Warner was off the ground receiving 
treatment and the Proteas knew it, so they declared knowing the umpires 
wouldn’t let Warner open the innings. This is chaotic for Australia. Who will 
partner the debutant Renshaw? Another first-gamer in Maddinson or Handscomb? 
Surely not. Faf, you evil genius.

South Africa declare on 259-9!

76th over: South Africa 259-9 (du Plessis 118, Shamsi 18)

Now Shamsi is playing inside-out lofted drives over point, or at least that’s 
where they’re ending up. Starc is furious and makes that schoolboy error of 
sledging the woeful tailender he’s not actually getting out. Wait till you 
castle him, Mitch. Faf du Plessis tops off the carnage by slogging a four 
straight down the ground and then he declares! South Africa will come out and 
have 12 or so overs at a new Australian opening pair. Thus ends a superb and 
undefeated century by Faf du Plessis, who might win a few fans back with this 
attacking declaration.

75th over: South Africa 249-9 (du Plessis 113, Shamsi 13)

Shamsi is having a ball out there at the moment, even if his shots aren’t from 
the text book of any sport. Two ungainly swipes somehow elude mid-on and 
mid-off respectively and pick him up two runs apiece. Chadd Sayers is out on 
the ground to field now, which seems a little harsh the night before the Shield 
game he’ll be jetting off for tomorrow. Hazlewood finishes with a bouncer and a 
big sledge but that’s a ball after Shamsi clattered him for a boundary to leg. 
It’s abssolute filth from Shamsi, but very amusing.

Shamsi has already pissed off Aust here and he's not even faced 20 balls

74th over: South Africa 240-9 (du Plessis 112, Shamsi 5)

There’s a beautiful crimson tinge to the skies as Mitchell Starc sends a 
snorter past du Plessis’ outside edge to start this over, which causes the mind 
to wander (and wonder); how is Matt Renshaw feeling right now? He’s smiling and 
chatting away with Matthew Wade but he must be at least a little nervous about 
the prospect of his first bat in Test cricket, which will come soon. In the 
meantime, Starc roughs up Shamsi with a bouncer to the elbow, which glances his 
arm guard and flies away to the fence at fine leg.

73rd over: South Africa 234-9 (du Plessis 111, Shamsi 5)

The intent here from du Plessis is clear, but Nathan Lyon is a wily bowler and 
does well to tie him down for the first four balls of the over but finally the 
batsman releases the shackles, skipping down the track to the penultimate 
delivery and lofting four over long-off and then a single to retain the strike. 
Lyon looks like he’s just had the jam stolen from his donut.

72nd over: South Africa 229-9 (du Plessis 106, Shamsi 5)

Ha, Shamsi doesn’t have much of an idea what is going on here as Starc slings 
them down from a great height. He’s squared up seemingly before the ball is 
even delivered, jitterbugging and jiving around his crease as he hopes to lay 
bat on it. Somehow he survives, edging short of Smith at slip to finish the 
over and allowing Faf to perhaps have one last bash at Lyon from the other end.

71st over: South Africa 229-9 (du Plessis 106, Shamsi 5)

The debutant Shamsi is out ther now and with a first class average of eight, 
we’re not expecting much of him. Lyon duly brings in a leg slip but Shamsi 
hammers the next delivery over cow to get off the mark in Test cricket with a 
towering boundary. It almost cleared the rope, in fact. “He’s got a great 
energy,” says Mark Nicholas, as though he’s won a competition on the back of a 
cereal box. A little more damningly, Ian Chappell says he’s watched him bowl in 
the nets and that his wrong’un is very easy to pick. The poor bloke hasn’t even 
bowled yet and they’re already consigning him to John Watkins-style 
one-Test-wonder territory.

WICKET! Rabada st Wade b Lyon 1 (South Africa 220-9)

Wade stumps Rabada! Or does he? The square leg umpire calls for a review but 
it can’t save the Protease paceman. He thought he had something back behind the 
line but he doesn’t, so Nathan Lyon finally has his 214th Test wicket after 110 
fruitless overs and Matthew Wade caps a sturdy day behind the stumps with a 
very smart stumping.


Reader Pete Salmon arrives now with the joke on everyone’s lips: “Declaration 
on the cards? I think they probably have enough.”

70th over: South Africa 220-8 (du Plessis 102, Rabada 1)

It’s been a funny kind of bowling performance from Jackson Bird today. His 
first spell wasn’t great, but the one before this was excellent. Now? He’s 
followed a very good wicket-taking over with a pretty ropey one to take us 
through to drinks.

Faf du Plessis brings up his 6th Test hundred

69th over: South Africa 218-8 (du Plessis 101, Rabada 0)

Lyon continues and du Plessis gets down on one knee to sweep two and bring up 
a superb hundred right when his country needed it. It came from 147 deliveries, 
has stretched over 225 minutes and featured 14 boundaries. He’s delighted as he 
raises the bat and well he might given the events of the last week. Rabada 
deals with the rest of the over competently but hopefully we’re in for some 
enterprising batting from the Proteas captain from here.

WICKET! Abbott LBW Bird 17 (South Africa 215-8)

Abbott goes! And Jackson Bird does the trick for Australia, angling it into 
the pads to trap him in front. Abbott conferences with his skipper to consider 
a review but decides against it in the end. He’s on his way and du Plessis, 
currently on 98, has some nervous moments ahead of him.

67th over: South Africa 214-7 (du Plessis 97, Abbott 17)

This is a nice little opportunity for Nathan Lyon, who now returns with two 
well-set batsmen at the crease but also the tail up for grabs if he can get a 
breakthrough. There’s a single for du Plessis and Abbott handles the rest just 
fine.

66th over: South Africa 213-7 (du Plessis 96, Abbott 17)

A few overs before dinner I was not convinced that Faf du Plessis would be 
able to reach 100 here but he looks a Monty the way he’s creaming Halzewood 
through cover to reach the 90s at the start of this over. There’s another a few 
balls later and already the #AshesBantz has begun, and I’m already bored of it. 
This partnership now totals 52 runs from 79 balls faced. Prediction: it could 
have significant impact on the result of this game.
simon hughes (@theanalyst) 
Mitchell Starc, josh hazlewood, and Jackson bird. Sorry but Australia are not 
regaining the Ashes with this attack.#ausvsa

65th over: South Africa 203-7 (du Plessis 87, Abbott 17)

One thing I will say about Matthew Renshaw is that he looks the part as he 
glances around the field from his perch at first slip. He’s only played 12 
first-class games but you could convince me it’s at least 25. As South Africa 
pass the 200 mark and continue to hit threes at will, it’s worth pointing out 
that David Warner is still in pain from that shoulder complaint. It begs the 
question as to why the hell he’s in a position where he keeps having to throw, 
but then I’m not a sports scientist so take my opinion with a large pinch of 
salt. It’s a pretty ordinary over from Bird.

63rd over: South Africa 193-7 (du Plessis 82, Abbott 12)

Jackson Bird’s back now and I wish they’d film his approach to the crease from 
side-on every time he runs in, because it’s a joy to behold. There’s a few 
proppy half-steps to start with, then he sort of slows down right as he’s truly 
taking off, like he’s run out the door but quickly realised he doesn’t have his 
wallet. The bowling itself is tidy enough, certainly more so than Starc’s last 
over. It’s a maiden.

62nd over: South Africa 193-7 (du Plessis 82, Abbott 12)

Australia have just gone into their shell a little bit here. Starc is bowling 
from wide on the crease to Abbott. Isn’t it better just just whang it down on a 
stump-to-stump line? Abbott is looking positively batsmanlike now and drives 
three to long off, giving Warner something to do other than daydream about 
“carDoons” featuring dinosaurs and giant robots. Ooh actually, a ball later 
Warner’s inactivity possibly counts against him when he appears to throw his 
shoulder out trying to prevent a single. He’s grimacing like...well...like 
someone who isn’t watching this on a OLED TV. Faf finishes the over by blazing 
another cut shot to the fence at deep point. That was just dross from Starc.

61st over: South Africa 184-7 (du Plessis 77, Abbott 8)

Clang! Du Plessis gets some width from Hazlewood and clatters another boundary 
left of cover, throwing that kitchen-sink-sized bat of his at the ball and 
reaping the rewards. Abbott’s now cruising to the point that he’s happy to take 
a single off the final delivery of the over.

60th over: South Africa 178-7 (du Plessis 72, Abbott 7)

We’re in a bit of a lull here but it’s allowed du Plessis to get back into the 
swing of things in his unassuming way. He’ll do well to get a hundred from here 
but you couldn’t rule it out. In this Starc over there’s a bit of argy bargy as 
du Plessis completes a run and guess who is involved? Yep, Matthew Wade, 
fulfilling his ‘mongrel’ act quota for the day. Or not quite. He’ll be back 
soon bellowing about whatever is “noice”.

59th over: South Africa 171-7 (du Plessis 68, Abbott 4)

Replays of the final ball of that last Starc over reveal how tricky that one 
was for Abbott, who wasn’t expecting so much bounce and literally got chinned. 
Starc was every bit the ‘Demon’ fast bowler with his wispy moustache and 
thousand yard stare in the aftermath. I wonder whether, like Spofforth, he’ll 
keep running down the hallway well into old age and bowling four ‘overs’ of 
deliveries. Might be a little hazardous for one so big-boned, I guess.

58th over: South Africa 168-7 (du Plessis 65, Abbott 4)

Mitchell Starc is in for the kill too, but Abbott is handling him reasonably 
well to start with, fencing away at the wide ones and keeping the straight ones 
out without discomfort until the final delivery of the over smacks into his 
chin. That was spiteful bowling.

57th over: South Africa 168-7 (du Plessis 65, Abbott 4)

OK, the lights are on, the sun is almost gone and we’re back at it with Josh 
Hazlewood rambling his way in. Kyle Abbott has a few sighters and then burgles 
three runs through mid-wicket with an improvised dab. That was a bit stiff and 
disjointed from Hazlewood first up. He’ll be back on the mark soon, I’m sure.

The Ashes is a year away and already shots have been fired

Anglo-Australian Guardian cartoonist David Squires might break the internet 
here, but having ingested far too many servings of fish ‘n chips in the Old 
Dart and here in Australia, I have to agree with him. Australians just CANNOT 
do a proper batter. We must lift. We simply have to do better. Spots in the 
team are on the line. You need to show something, fish n chip purveyors of 
Australia.
David Squires (@squires_david) 
Australia is shit at fish and chips.

Other things you need to know

Josh Hazlewood has bowled superbly for his 4-36 from 16 overs and looks a sure 
thing to add another five-wicket bag to his collection when night falls. He’s 
been ably assisted by Mitche Starc’s 2-50 off 17 overs, and Jackson Bird, whose 
1-45 off 12 was more impressive than it reads. Nathan Lyon has 0-27 from 11 
luckless, occasionally average overs. I might go grab a drink too, but we’ll be 
back with more cricket in the next half hour or so.

Dinner on day one - South Africa 165-7

56th over: South Africa 165-7 (du Plessis 65, Abbott 1)

That is dinner on day one of the day-night Test in Adelaide, with Kyle Abbott 
surviving the final over before the break to accompany his skipper to the 
sheds. It was a session that didn’t pan out so well for the tourists, who lost 
four wickets as du Plessis stood firm. Gone in this session were Stephen Cook, 
Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock and Vernon Philander, and the Australians will be 
most content with their work.

55th over: South Africa 163-7 (du Plessis 64, Abbott 0)

What a difference a week makes, though I suppose the Australians are yet to 
bat, which is the most pressing problem. But they’re full of energy in the 
field, which is a nice change. Faf is happy to let Abbott have the strike late 
in this Hazlewood over and I’m not sure why, because he’s fencing at the ball 
like a real rube at the moment. Why is Rabada batting below him?

54th over: South Africa 162-7 (du Plessis 63, Abbott 0)

Hmm, Snicko says that Philander edged that but it was desperately hard to see 
anything on the replays. “I’ve never seen a thinner edge on the Snicko 
frequency meter,” says Ian Healy. “A dangerous player removed by technology.” 
It’s just sounding like really crap science fiction now.

Anyway, Kyle Abbott is thrown into the fray now with Mitchell Starc steaming 
in as shadows stretch out across the field and he does well to see off the over.

WICKET! Philander c Wade b Hazlewood 4 (South Africa 161-7)

Philander goes in contentious circumstances! Did he edge that? I couldn’t see 
it on the first few replays but Nigel Llong gave it and after a quick review, 
so did the third umpire. Josh Hazlewood cut the tailender in half with an 
in-ducker and it looked like it glanced Philander’s back leg and that alone on 
the way through to Wade, but he’s gone!

52nd over: South Africa 157-6 (du Plessis 62, Philander 0)

It’s been an unsettling five minutes for the Proteas but Faf du Plessis still 
looks like a man carved from exquisite, flawless granite. He crunches Mitchell 
Starc to the ropes with a classic cover drive and then gets a little lucky with 
a thick edge for four through gully. He’ll need a few more of those to get to 
three figures here, and will want Philander to hang around for a while yet.

51st over: South Africa 149-6 (du Plessis 54, Philander 0)

Whheeyyyyhhh... Vernon Philander is at the crease now and he wouldn’t want to 
leave too many like his second from Hazlewood, which angles back in the same 
direction as the de Kock wicket ball and rushes past the top of the off stump. 
Close call.

WICKET! de Kock c Wade b Hazlewood 24 (South Africa 149-6)

Hazlewood strikes! Well that was completely against the run of play but the 
burly Australian paceman has removed the danger man de Kock, angling it across 
the left-hander to draw another thick edge through to Wade. Where did that come 
from? The Proteas young gun looked a million bucks until that false stroke. 
South Africa bat deep but they’re in a bit of bother here.

50th over: South Africa 147-5 (du Plessis 54, de Kock 22)

“Noice Gaz, noice” drawls Matthew Wade behind the stumps as Nathan Lyon bowls 
now, but he’s referring to the second delivery of the over rather than the 
first, which was a putrid long hop that Quinton de Kock crashed to the boundary 
at deep point. That was the very opposite of noice.

49th over: South Africa 142-5 (du Plessis 54, de Kock 17)

How about Ian Chappell using Our Lord Adam Gilchrists’s name in vain. Is de 
Kock that good yet? He’s pretty good, I guess. 84, 64, 104 and now 17 not out 
for the Proteas keeper in this series. His skipper has the better of this over, 
hammering the returning Josh Hazlewood to the fence with a rasping cut shot. 
That sizzled to the fence.

48th over: South Africa 137-5 (du Plessis 5o, de Kock 16)

Bang! Quinton de Kock gets down the track to Nathan Lyon and goes down town 
with a lofted drive. Is it six bits? The third umpire is consulted and the 
verdict comes down: four. Hit the rope. A moral victory for de Kock though, 
followed by a frustrating one for Nathan Lyon. The latter draws a top edge from 
the former’s slog-sweep but it drops frustratingly short of the man in the 
deep. If Lyon dropped a slice of bread on the ground right now you’d stake your 
house on it landing butter-side down.

47th over: South Africa 130-5 (du Plessis 5o, de Kock 9)

That’s a half-century for Faf du Plessis, who has returned to one of his 
happiest hunting grounds in style, bringing up his minor milestone in 92 
deliveries across 130 minutes. There have been seven boundaries along the way 
and you can bet your Richie Benaud commemorative 50-cent piece that he’s in 
this for the long haul and will relish the opportunity to stick it to the 
haters.

“I’ve got a good feeling about Nathan Lyon here,” says Shane Warne, and Quinny 
de Kock duly plays an absurd slog, which is toed agonisingly short of the man 
at mid-off. Areas, Warnie. I wonder what else SKW has a good feeling about 
tonight. Answers on the back of a envelope.

45th over: South Africa 126-5 (du Plessis 49, de Kock 6)

A misfield from Bird off his own bowling and an aggressive bit of running from 
the Proteas pair generates three runs for du Plessis when a dot ball should 
have been the result. It’s not Bird’s best over, but finishes with Faf driving 
with the hint of a leading edge, so the bowler isn’t completely unhappy with 
his efforts.

The final analysis

It was a much-improved effort today from the Australians, who let the tail wag 
far more than they should have, but bowled excellently to the top order to have 
South Africa 117-5 before Faf du Plessis dragged the rest along with him as he 
scored a resourceful and stirring century. His undefeated 118 was the highlight 
of his team’s 259-9 declared, while Stephen Cook regained some confidence with 
40 at the top of the order.

The Australian bowlers were led by Josh Hazlewood’s 4-68 off 22 overs, while 
Mitch Starc (2-78 off 23) and Jackson Bird (2-57 off 16) also had their 
moments. Nathan Lyon got a pass mark, and did break through for his first Test 
wicket in yonks, and would you believe it came from a Matthew Wade stumping? 
Surely it’ll be a full moon in Adelaide tonight. Wade also pouched four catches 
in a solid performance with the gloves.

Matt Renshaw and Usman Khawaja will enter tomorrow with a decent measure of 
confidence given the way they handles those 12 overs, and we’ll be here on the 
Guardian OBO to take you through all of the action. Thanks for your company 
today!

I’ll leave you with Australia’s biggest positive:

12th over: Australia 14-0 (Khawaja 3, Renshaw 8)

And that is stumps on day one. It ended with a piece of evil genius from Faf 
du Plessis, who declared nine down knowing that David Warner was off the ground 
receiving treatment on an injury, which has meant Usman Khawaja needed to open 
with debutant Matt Renshaw. It’s been a nervy little period for both batsmen 
but Renshaw has been superb so far. He’ll enter tomorrow with fewer nerves than 
he might have and has taken part in an aborbing and fun day of Test cricket.
 
11th over: Australia 14-0 (Khawaja 3, Renshaw 8)

Shamsi gets another go with the penultimate over of the first day and Khawaja 
is nothing less than disciplined in the face of the circumstances and some 
probing spin bowling, but does drive attractively for one to give Renshaw one 
ball of spin to face. He’s not entirely comfortable but survives it.
 
10th over: Australia 13-0 (Khawaja 2, Renshaw 8)

This is better from Rabada now, who takes the ball away from Renshaw and 
almost draws an outside edge. It moved too much, if anything. It’s a maiden 
from the Proteas speedster and Renshaw does well to hang in there.
 
9th over: Australia 13-0 (Khawaja 2, Renshaw 8)

Faf is throwing the kitchen sink at them now and introduces Tabraiz Shamsi for 
some left-arm wrist spin. If you haven’t seen him before, imagine a slightly 
less exaggerated Paul ‘Frog in the Blender’ Adams. His opening over has all 
sorts, and Khawaja misses out on punishing a long hop, but it’sinteresting at 
the very least and a maiden.

Morne de Klerk/Getty Images  
8th over: Australia 13-0 (Khawaja 2, Renshaw 8)

With Kyle Abbott failing to make inroads Faf throws the ball to Kagiso Rabada, 
who might get three overs in here and put the frighteners into this improvised 
opening pair. One thing I will say about Renshaw is that his wide stance – with 
bat tapped between well-spread legs – is a nice change from the robotic styles 
elsewhere in Australian cricket. It clearly works for him. Rabada’s first over 
reaches no great heights.
 
7th over: Australia 12-0 (Khawaja 1, Renshaw 8)

Calm down Adelaide, there’s no need for Bronx cheers when Usman Khawaja gets 
the first runs of the bat. What do you want, another collapse? Renshaw is thus 
on strike to Philander and does the job the crowd prematurely saluted him for 
before, glancing well to pick up a boundary and start his account. There’s a 
lovely boyish smile once he’s done haring between the wickets and realises he’s 
passed his first test. A ball later Philander almost kisses the outside edge of 
the bat with an excellent off-cutter but Renshaw recovers by clipping four more 
through square leg. An edge falls just short of second slip but it’s determined 
stuff from Renshaw. He doesn’t look out of place at all.
 
6th over: Australia 3-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

More drama! The Adelaide crowd are cheering their heads off when Renshaw 
glances two to get off the mark but there’s no bat on it, so Richard 
Kettleborough does a wonderful heel turn and extravagantly signals the leg 
byes, grinning devilishly as the punters turn on him. Renshaw has played the 
most assured zero not out I’ve ever seen. It’s better than Rob Quiney’s debut 
nine and Usman Khawaja’s career-starting 37 combined.
 
5th over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

Another maiden to Philander. This is...it’s like REAL TEST MATCH BATTING from 
Australia. What is going on? Maybe Warner’s absence is a blessing in disguise.
 
4th over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

Someone has had a word to Kyle Abbott after his wasted energy an over ago and 
he’s pursuing a stump-to-stump line to Renshaw, even with his high-looping 
bouncers. As ever with the early stages of a Proteas bowling effort, the other 
eye-catching sight is Quinton de Kock writhing in pain after wearing a ball to 
the fingers when it dips late. Renshaw might have got a tickle on the final 
delivery, which strayed down leg, but there’s no contact to pick up his first 
runs at Test level. Maiden.

A counter-attack on Faf’s tactical genius?

3rd over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

Oof, Philander sends an absolute peach past the outside edge of Khawaja here, 
shaping it away beautifully towards a stacked slips cordon. That injudicious 
prod done with, Khawaja then follows the lead of his junior partner and tries 
to leave where possible. It’s a maiden. “If he’s half as good as Matthew Hayden 
Australians will be happy,” says Shane Warne of Matt Renshaw. Really? I think 
this team needs someone averaging more than 25, but I could be wrong.
 
2nd over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

Renshaw is probably a bundle of nerves her but he’s calm and leaves well as 
Kyle Abbott steams in and pursues a line outside off stump. In actual fact he 
barely has to play at it in this maiden over from Abbott, which never truly 
tests the youngster. Odd. Surely you’d attacking middle stump at this point?
 
1st over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 0, Renshaw 0)

Just to add to the drama, Vernon Philander starts with a no ball and although 
it’s wide, Khawaja almost takes a swing at it. It’s a nervy period for Khawaja 
but he negotiates the rest of the over and Renshaw is up next and set to face 
his first delivery in Tests. David Warner looks on from the sheds, utterly 
miffed. What a blunder by the Australian support staff.

<https://twitter.com/danbrettig/status/801729450987487232>  
Oh this is brilliant skullduggery! David Warner was off the ground receiving 
treatment and the Proteas knew it, so they declared knowing the umpires 
wouldn’t let Warner open the innings. This is chaotic for Australia. Who will 
partner the debutant Renshaw? Another first-gamer in Maddinson or Handscomb? 
Surely not. Faf, you evil genius.
 
76th over: South Africa 259-9 (du Plessis 118, Shamsi 18)

Now Shamsi is playing inside-out lofted drives over point, or at least that’s 
where they’re ending up. Starc is furious and makes that schoolboy error of 
sledging the woeful tailender he’s not actually getting out. Wait till you 
castle him, Mitch. Faf du Plessis tops off the carnage by slogging a four 
straight down the ground and then he declares! South Africa will come out and 
have 12 or so overs at a new Australian opening pair. Thus ends a superb and 
undefeated century by Faf du Plessis, who might win a few fans back with this 
attacking declaration.
 
75th over: South Africa 249-9 (du Plessis 113, Shamsi 13)

Shamsi is having a ball out there at the moment, even if his shots aren’t from 
the text book of any sport. Two ungainly swipes somehow elude mid-on and 
mid-off respectively and pick him up two runs apiece. Chadd Sayers is out on 
the ground to field now, which seems a little harsh the night before the Shield 
game he’ll be jetting off for tomorrow. Hazlewood finishes with a bouncer and a 
big sledge but that’s a ball after Shamsi clattered him for a boundary to leg. 
It’s abssolute filth from Shamsi, but very amusing.
Daniel Brettig (@danbrettig) 
Shamsi has already pissed off Aust here and he's not even faced 20 balls

74th over: South Africa 240-9 (du Plessis 112, Shamsi 5)

There’s a beautiful crimson tinge to the skies as Mitchell Starc sends a 
snorter past du Plessis’ outside edge to start this over, which causes the mind 
to wander (and wonder); how is Matt Renshaw feeling right now? He’s smiling and 
chatting away with Matthew Wade but he must be at least a little nervous about 
the prospect of his first bat in Test cricket, which will come soon. In the 
meantime, Starc roughs up Shamsi with a bouncer to the elbow, which glances his 
arm guard and flies away to the fence at fine leg.
 
73rd over: South Africa 234-9 (du Plessis 111, Shamsi 5)

The intent here from du Plessis is clear, but Nathan Lyon is a wily bowler and 
does well to tie him down for the first four balls of the over but finally the 
batsman releases the shackles, skipping down the track to the penultimate 
delivery and lofting four over long-off and then a single to retain the strike. 
Lyon looks like he’s just had the jam stolen from his donut.
 
72nd over: South Africa 229-9 (du Plessis 106, Shamsi 5)

Ha, Shamsi doesn’t have much of an idea what is going on here as Starc slings 
them down from a great height. He’s squared up seemingly before the ball is 
even delivered, jitterbugging and jiving around his crease as he hopes to lay 
bat on it. Somehow he survives, edging short of Smith at slip to finish the 
over and allowing Faf to perhaps have one last bash at Lyon from the other end.
 
71st over: South Africa 229-9 (du Plessis 106, Shamsi 5)

The debutant Shamsi is out ther now and with a first class average of eight, 
we’re not expecting much of him. Lyon duly brings in a leg slip but Shamsi 
hammers the next delivery over cow to get off the mark in Test cricket with a 
towering boundary. It almost cleared the rope, in fact. “He’s got a great 
energy,” says Mark Nicholas, as though he’s won a competition on the back of a 
cereal box. A little more damningly, Ian Chappell says he’s watched him bowl in 
the nets and that his wrong’un is very easy to pick. The poor bloke hasn’t even 
bowled yet and they’re already consigning him to John Watkins-style 
one-Test-wonder territory.
 
Wade stumps Rabada! Or does he? The square leg umpire calls for a review but 
it can’t save the Protease paceman. He thought he had something back behind the 
line but he doesn’t, so Nathan Lyon finally has his 214th Test wicket after 110 
fruitless overs and Matthew Wade caps a sturdy day behind the stumps with a 
very smart stumping.


Reader Pete Salmon arrives now with the joke on everyone’s lips: “Declaration 
on the cards? I think they probably have enough.”

70th over: South Africa 220-8 (du Plessis 102, Rabada 1)

It’s been a funny kind of bowling performance from Jackson Bird today. His 
first spell wasn’t great, but the one before this was excellent. Now? He’s 
followed a very good wicket-taking over with a pretty ropey one to take us 
through to drinks.

69th over: South Africa 218-8 (du Plessis 101, Rabada 0)

Lyon continues and du Plessis gets down on one knee to sweep two and bring up 
a superb hundred right when his country needed it. It came from 147 deliveries, 
has stretched over 225 minutes and featured 14 boundaries. He’s delighted as he 
raises the bat and well he might given the events of the last week. Rabada 
deals with the rest of the over competently but hopefully we’re in for some 
enterprising batting from the Proteas captain from here.
 
Abbott goes! And Jackson Bird does the trick for Australia, angling it into 
the pads to trap him in front. Abbott conferences with his skipper to consider 
a review but decides against it in the end. He’s on his way and du Plessis, 
currently on 98, has some nervous moments ahead of him.

67th over: South Africa 214-7 (du Plessis 97, Abbott 17)

This is a nice little opportunity for Nathan Lyon, who now returns with two 
well-set batsmen at the crease but also the tail up for grabs if he can get a 
breakthrough. There’s a single for du Plessis and Abbott handles the rest just 
fine.

66th over: South Africa 213-7 (du Plessis 96, Abbott 17)

A few overs before dinner I was not convinced that Faf du Plessis would be 
able to reach 100 here but he looks a Monty the way he’s creaming Halzewood 
through cover to reach the 90s at the start of this over. There’s another a few 
balls later and already the #AshesBantz has begun, and I’m already bored of it. 
This partnership now totals 52 runs from 79 balls faced. Prediction: it could 
have significant impact on the result of this game.

65th over: South Africa 203-7 (du Plessis 87, Abbott 17)

One thing I will say about Matthew Renshaw is that he looks the part as he 
glances around the field from his perch at first slip. He’s only played 12 
first-class games but you could convince me it’s at least 25. As South Africa 
pass the 200 mark and continue to hit threes at will, it’s worth pointing out 
that David Warner is still in pain from that shoulder complaint. It begs the 
question as to why the hell he’s in a position where he keeps having to throw, 
but then I’m not a sports scientist so take my opinion with a large pinch of 
salt. It’s a pretty ordinary over from Bird.

63rd over: South Africa 193-7 (du Plessis 82, Abbott 12)

Jackson Bird’s back now and I wish they’d film his approach to the crease from 
side-on every time he runs in, because it’s a joy to behold. There’s a few 
proppy half-steps to start with, then he sort of slows down right as he’s truly 
taking off, like he’s run out the door but quickly realised he doesn’t have his 
wallet. The bowling itself is tidy enough, certainly more so than Starc’s last 
over. It’s a maiden.

62nd over: South Africa 193-7 (du Plessis 82, Abbott 12)

Australia have just gone into their shell a little bit here. Starc is bowling 
from wide on the crease to Abbott. Isn’t it better just just whang it down on a 
stump-to-stump line? Abbott is looking positively batsmanlike now and drives 
three to long off, giving Warner something to do other than daydream about 
“carDoons” featuring dinosaurs and giant robots. Ooh actually, a ball later 
Warner’s inactivity possibly counts against him when he appears to throw his 
shoulder out trying to prevent a single. He’s grimacing like...well...like 
someone who isn’t watching this on a OLED TV. Faf finishes the over by blazing 
another cut shot to the fence at deep point. That was just dross from Starc.
 
61st over: South Africa 184-7 (du Plessis 77, Abbott 8)

Clang! Du Plessis gets some width from Hazlewood and clatters another boundary 
left of cover, throwing that kitchen-sink-sized bat of his at the ball and 
reaping the rewards. Abbott’s now cruising to the point that he’s happy to take 
a single off the final delivery of the over.
 
60th over: South Africa 178-7 (du Plessis 72, Abbott 7)

We’re in a bit of a lull here but it’s allowed du Plessis to get back into the 
swing of things in his unassuming way. He’ll do well to get a hundred from here 
but you couldn’t rule it out. In this Starc over there’s a bit of argy bargy as 
du Plessis completes a run and guess who is involved? Yep, Matthew Wade, 
fulfilling his ‘mongrel’ act quota for the day. Or not quite. He’ll be back 
soon bellowing about whatever is “noice”.

Replays of the final ball of that last Starc over reveal how tricky that one 
was for Abbott, who wasn’t expecting so much bounce and literally got chinned. 
Starc was every bit the ‘Demon’ fast bowler with his wispy moustache and 
thousand yard stare in the aftermath. I wonder whether, like Spofforth, he’ll 
keep running down the hallway well into old age and bowling four ‘overs’ of 
deliveries. Might be a little hazardous for one so big-boned, I guess.
 
58th over: South Africa 168-7 (du Plessis 65, Abbott 4)

Mitchell Starc is in for the kill too, but Abbott is handling him reasonably 
well to start with, fencing away at the wide ones and keeping the straight ones 
out without discomfort until the final delivery of the over smacks into his 
chin. That was spiteful bowling.

OK, the lights are on, the sun is almost gone and we’re back at it with Josh 
Hazlewood rambling his way in. Kyle Abbott has a few sighters and then burgles 
three runs through mid-wicket with an improvised dab. That was a bit stiff and 
disjointed from Hazlewood first up. He’ll be back on the mark soon, I’m sure.
 
The Ashes is a year away and already shots have been fired

Anglo-Australian Guardian cartoonist David Squires might break the internet 
here, but having ingested far too many servings of fish ‘n chips in the Old 
Dart and here in Australia, I have to agree with him. Australians just CANNOT 
do a proper batter. We must lift. We simply have to do better. Spots in the 
team are on the line. You need to show something, fish n chip purveyors of 
Australia.

Other things you need to know

Josh Hazlewood has bowled superbly for his 4-36 from 16 overs and looks a sure 
thing to add another five-wicket bag to his collection when night falls. He’s 
been ably assisted by Mitche Starc’s 2-50 off 17 overs, and Jackson Bird, whose 
1-45 off 12 was more impressive than it reads. Nathan Lyon has 0-27 from 11 
luckless, occasionally average overs. I might go grab a drink too, but we’ll be 
back with more cricket in the next half hour or so.
 
56th over: South Africa 165-7 (du Plessis 65, Abbott 1)

That is dinner on day one of the day-night Test in Adelaide, with Kyle Abbott 
surviving the final over before the break to accompany his skipper to the 
sheds. It was a session that didn’t pan out so well for the tourists, who lost 
four wickets as du Plessis stood firm. Gone in this session were Stephen Cook, 
Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock and Vernon Philander, and the Australians will be 
most content with their work.
 
55th over: South Africa 163-7 (du Plessis 64, Abbott 0)

What a difference a week makes, though I suppose the Australians are yet to 
bat, which is the most pressing problem. But they’re full of energy in the 
field, which is a nice change. Faf is happy to let Abbott have the strike late 
in this Hazlewood over and I’m not sure why, because he’s fencing at the ball 
like a real rube at the moment. Why is Rabada batting below him?

54th over: South Africa 162-7 (du Plessis 63, Abbott 0)

Hmm, Snicko says that Philander edged that but it was desperately hard to see 
anything on the replays. “I’ve never seen a thinner edge on the Snicko 
frequency meter,” says Ian Healy. “A dangerous player removed by technology.” 
It’s just sounding like really crap science fiction now.

Anyway, Kyle Abbott is thrown into the fray now with Mitchell Starc steaming 
in as shadows stretch out across the field and he does well to see off the over.
 
Philander goes in contentious circumstances! Did he edge that? I couldn’t see 
it on the first few replays but Nigel Llong gave it and after a quick review, 
so did the third umpire. Josh Hazlewood cut the tailender in half with an 
in-ducker and it looked like it glanced Philander’s back leg and that alone on 
the way through to Wade, but he’s gone!

52nd over: South Africa 157-6 (du Plessis 62, Philander 0)

It’s been an unsettling five minutes for the Proteas but Faf du Plessis still 
looks like a man carved from exquisite, flawless granite. He crunches Mitchell 
Starc to the ropes with a classic cover drive and then gets a little lucky with 
a thick edge for four through gully. He’ll need a few more of those to get to 
three figures here, and will want Philander to hang around for a while yet.
 
51st over: South Africa 149-6 (du Plessis 54, Philander 0)

Whheeyyyyhhh... Vernon Philander is at the crease now and he wouldn’t want to 
leave too many like his second from Hazlewood, which angles back in the same 
direction as the de Kock wicket ball and rushes past the top of the off stump. 
Close call.

Hazlewood strikes! Well that was completely against the run of play but the 
burly Australian paceman has removed the danger man de Kock, angling it across 
the left-hander to draw another thick edge through to Wade. Where did that come 
from? The Proteas young gun looked a million bucks until that false stroke. 
South Africa bat deep but they’re in a bit of bother here.

50th over: South Africa 147-5 (du Plessis 54, de Kock 22)

“Noice Gaz, noice” drawls Matthew Wade behind the stumps as Nathan Lyon bowls 
now, but he’s referring to the second delivery of the over rather than the 
first, which was a putrid long hop that Quinton de Kock crashed to the boundary 
at deep point. That was the very opposite of noice.
 
49th over: South Africa 142-5 (du Plessis 54, de Kock 17)

How about Ian Chappell using Our Lord Adam Gilchrists’s name in vain. Is de 
Kock that good yet? He’s pretty good, I guess. 84, 64, 104 and now 17 not out 
for the Proteas keeper in this series. His skipper has the better of this over, 
hammering the returning Josh Hazlewood to the fence with a rasping cut shot. 
That sizzled to the fence.
 
48th over: South Africa 137-5 (du Plessis 5o, de Kock 16)

Bang! Quinton de Kock gets down the track to Nathan Lyon and goes down town 
with a lofted drive. Is it six bits? The third umpire is consulted and the 
verdict comes down: four. Hit the rope. A moral victory for de Kock though, 
followed by a frustrating one for Nathan Lyon. The latter draws a top edge from 
the former’s slog-sweep but it drops frustratingly short of the man in the 
deep. If Lyon dropped a slice of bread on the ground right now you’d stake your 
house on it landing butter-side down.
 
47th over: South Africa 130-5 (du Plessis 5o, de Kock 9)

That’s a half-century for Faf du Plessis, who has returned to one of his 
happiest hunting grounds in style, bringing up his minor milestone in 92 
deliveries across 130 minutes. There have been seven boundaries along the way 
and you can bet your Richie Benaud commemorative 50-cent piece that he’s in 
this for the long haul and will relish the opportunity to stick it to the 
haters.
 
46th over: South Africa 127-5 (du Plessis 49, de Kock 7)

“I’ve got a good feeling about Nathan Lyon here,” says Shane Warne, and Quinny 
de Kock duly plays an absurd slog, which is toed agonisingly short of the man 
at mid-off. Areas, Warnie. I wonder what else SKW has a good feeling about 
tonight. Answers on the back of a envelope.

45th over: South Africa 126-5 (du Plessis 49, de Kock 6)

A misfield from Bird off his own bowling and an aggressive bit of running from 
the Proteas pair generates three runs for du Plessis when a dot ball should 
have been the result. It’s not Bird’s best over, but finishes with Faf driving 
with the hint of a leading edge, so the bowler isn’t completely unhappy with 
his efforts.
