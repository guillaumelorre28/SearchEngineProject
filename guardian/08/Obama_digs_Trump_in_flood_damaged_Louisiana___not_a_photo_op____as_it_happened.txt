 outlined her vision of how the Republican nominee could win in November 
despite consistently trailing in polls, during an interview with Channel 4 in 
the United Kingdom for the documentary President Trump: Can He Really Win? 
Conway insisted that Trump’s support was not reflected in polls because of the
perceived social stigma of supporting the Republican nominee.“Donald Trump 
performs better consistently better in online polling where a human being is 
not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the elections 
… it’s become socially desirable, especially if you’re a college educated 
person in the US, to say that you’re against Donald Trump,” said Conway. 
 * More than half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took with non-governmental 
interests during her tenure as secretary of state were with people who had 
donated money to the Clinton Foundation,the Associated Press reported this 
afternoon 
<http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CAMPAIGN_2016_CLINTON_FOUNDATION?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-08-23-14-35-04>
, an astonishing percentage that underscores previous critiques of Clinton’s 
connection with the organization during her time at the state department. 
 * Of the 154 people from private interests who met with or had scheduled 
telephone conversations with Clinton while she served as secretary of state 
between 2009 and 2013 had donated money to the Clinton Foundation or had 
pledged to do so, giving as much as a combined $156 million to the non-profit. 
Of those, 20 gave more than $1 million to Clinton’s family foundation, which 
was founded during Bill Clinton’s second presidential term with the stated 
mission of “strengthen[ing] the capacity of people throughout the world to meet 
the challenges of global interdependence.”

 * Hillary Clinton will denounce Donald Trump and his team of political 
advisers for their embrace of the “alt-right”, an online movement where white 
supremacy, nationalism, nativism and racism flourish. In a speech in Reno, 
Nevada, on Thursday, Clinton will argue that Trump’s “alt-right” brand is 
wrongfully pushing a dystopian view of America and sowing division in an effort 
to mobilize anxious Americans. According to a campaign aide, Clinton will 
contrast Trump’s “divisive views and dangerous temperament” with a vision of an 
America that is “stronger together”.

 * Andrea Tantaros, the former co-host of the Fox News program The Five, has 
filed a complaint in New York state supreme court that accuses former Fox chief 
Roger Ailes of being a “sexual predator” and names former senator Scott Brown 
and Fox host Bill O’Reilly. “Fox News masquerades as defender of traditional 
family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-fueled, Playboy 
Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny,” the
complaint says 
<http://www.politico.com/media/f/?id=00000156-b7e7-de38-a3df-b7ff973d0002>. 
Ailes took a $40m severance package last month after former host Gretchen 
Carlson, current host Megan Kelly and others accused him of sexual harassment. 
 * Roger Stone, a longtime informal advisor to Donald Trump and even 
longer-time conspiracy theorist, conferred with fellow Trump supporter and 
conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on the latter’s radio program today about 
whether Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who was born in Michigan and raised 
in Saudi Arabia, has undergonefemale genital mutilation

When Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> visited 
the Indian city of Pune, his private jet was so large that he was forced to 
wait on board for nearly an hour while airport staff cobbled together a 
makeshift landing ramp for him to come down to earth.

According to his business partner Atul Chordia, Trump remained jovial despite 
the glitch during his grand entrance in August 2014. “He was joking around with 
the staff – he could have made a scene about it, but he didn’t,” said Chordia 
in a telephone interview. “He was nice, friendly. He was good with everyone.”

A slump in the US market had brought the real estate tycoon east in search of 
new opportunities; that search brought him to Pune, a sleepy city in western
India <https://www.theguardian.com/world/india>.

To welcome Trump, 500 of Pune’s richest and most powerful people attended a 
banquet hosted by Chordia’s Panchshil Realty, the firm that was bringing the 
Trump franchise to India for the first time.

The Bollywood actress and beauty queen Lara Dutta interviewed Trump while a 
phalanx of cameramen from local television stations jostled for room in the 
press stand. Movie stars such as Rishi and Ranbir Kapoor and wealthy Indian 
business families had already bought apartments at Trump Towers Pune, reporters 
were told.

Each 6,000-sq-ft, five-bedroom apartment cost a whopping 150m rupees ($2.2m) – 
around 25% more than similar properties in the surrounding Kalyani Nagar 
neighbourhood, just because of Trump’s name. On subsequent trips to India, 
Trump told reporters that Trump Towers would be “good for India”.


Construction work at Trump Towers Pune is well under way, but two years on 
from that glitzy launch, the project is the subject of two investigations by 
the Pune state government and local police, after discrepancies were found in 
documents related to the land on which the luxury apartment block is being 
built.

Saurabh Rao, the district collector (or top administrative officer) for Pune 
state, told the Guardian: “We are currently in the investigation process. We 
have been conducting an inquiry for the last five or six months.” The results 
of the investigation are due to be published imminently, Rao said.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> does not need 
to apologize for his incendiary remarks about Mexicans and an American-born 
federal judge’s heritage, said Helen Aguirre Ferré, the Republican National 
Committee’s director of Hispanic communications.

Asked whether the Republican presidential nominee owed the Hispanic community 
an apology, Aguirre Ferré was frank. “Don’t wait for an apology – ask for 
solutions to the problems,” she said on the Guardian’sPolitics for Humans 
podcast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2016/aug/23/latino-vote-trump-jose-vargas-helen-ferre-trump-podcast>
.

“He needs to explain his tone and why he used the words he used and what he 
means by that – what are his policies and those ofHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and how his are the ones 
that are really the answer to greater shared prosperity in our great country,” 
said Aguirre Ferré, a veteran journalist and adviser to the presidential 
campaign of former Florida governor Jeb Bush.

Trump launched his campaign more than a year ago by referring to Mexicans as 
rapists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes>
 and criminals. He has promised to build a “big, beautiful” wall along the 
US-Mexico border paid for by Mexico. He tweeted a photo of himself eating a 
taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo with the caption “I love Hispanics!” And he
questioned the judicial fitness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/donald-trump-judge-curiel-university-case-biased-mexican>
 of Indiana-born federal judge Gonzalo Curiel, who presiding over the Trump 
University lawsuit, on the basis that he is of “Mexican heritage”.

Five states and a group of Catholic healthcare providers launched a federal 
lawsuit 
<http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Franciscan-Alliance-et-al-v.-Burwell-et-al-Complaint-FINAL.pdf>
 on Tuesday challenging an Obama administration rule banning discrimination 
against transgender individuals in a healthcare setting.

Reynolds/EPA 
The lawsuit is the latest major addition to a series of challenges 
conservative states are mounting against the administration as the president 
attempts to expand transgender rights through executive action.

On Monday, a federal judge in Texas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/22/obama-transgender-students-public-schools-rules-blocked>
 issued a nationwide injunction against the administration’s requirement for 
all public schools to give transgender students access to the bathrooms 
consistent with their gender identity. Barack Obama announced that policy in 
May and warned that schools failing to comply would risk the loss of millions 
in federal funds. More than 20 states have sincejoined a legal campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/08/states-sue-federal-government-transgender-bathroom-policy>
 to block the requirement.

The rule <https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-18/pdf/2016-11458.pdf>, 
which became final on 18 May, prohibits insurance companies and individual 
healthcare providers from refusing to provide or cover a health service they 
typically offer on the basis that a patient is trans. It does not require 
doctors to perform or insurance companies to cover transition-related 
healthcare services if the service or procedure is not normally offered.

Leading Tuesday’s lawsuit are Texas, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Kansas and Kentucky. 
In their challenge, theyargue <http://www.becketfund.org/franciscanalliance/> 
that the administration’s rule “forces doctors to perform gender transition 
procedures on children”.

“On pain of significant financial liability, the regulation forces doctors to 
perform controversial and sometimes harmful medical procedures ostensibly 
designed to permanently change an individual’s sex – including the sex of 
children,” thelawsuit 
<http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Franciscan-Alliance-et-al-v.-Burwell-et-al-Complaint-FINAL.pdf>
 claims.


Proponents of the rule called these claims “ridiculous” and “full of 
inaccuracies”.

Donald Trump: Room in immigration platform for 'softening'

In an interview airing later tonight on Sean Hannity’s show on Fox News, 
Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> appeared to walk back his 
signature campaign issue - immigration - by telling the conservative pundit 
that there’s room for “softening” his stance on deporting undocumented 
immigrants, so long as they have contributed to American society.

“There certainly can be a softening because we’re not looking to hurt people,” 
Trump said, in response to a question posed by the host in which he was asked 
whether he might be able to accommodate “those people that contribute to 
society.”

But, Trump cautioned, “we are going to follow the laws of this country.”

The stance is a massive reversal of Trump’s previous stance on the issue, in 
which he declared that “deportation squads” would forcefully remove more than 
11 million undocumented immigrants currently estimated to live in the US.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce 
the laws of the land!

The FBI is investigating cyber intrusions targeting reporters of the New York 
Times <https://www.theguardian.com/media/new-york-times> and is looking into 
whether Russian intelligence agencies are responsible for the acts, a US 
official told the Associated Press.

The cyberattacks are believed to have targeted individual reporters, but 
investigators don’t believe the newspaper’s entire network was compromised, 
according to the official, who was briefed on the investigation but was not 
authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.

CNN first reported the FBI’s investigation.

It was not immediately clear how many reporters may have been affected, or how 
many email accounts were targeted.

The news comes as federal authorities continue to investigate a breach of the 
Democratic National Committee that outside cybersecurity experts have 
attributed to Russian intelligence agencies and that led to the posting of 
embarrassing internal emails.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other Democratic entities 
have also been affected. Earlier this month, the House minority leader advised 
fellow Democrats not to allow family members to answer their phones or read 
incoming texts after a mix of personal and official information of Democratic 
members and hundreds of congressional staff – purportedly from a hack of the 
DCCC – was posted online.

Donald Trump is fundraising off of his pledge to “shut down” the Clinton 
Foundation if he is elected president, emailing supporters that the non-profit 
is “the most corrupt enterprise in political history” and vowing its 
destruction, as well as an investigation intoHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>.

“It is now clear that the Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in 
political history,” Trump’s campaign wrote in the email. “We’ve now learned 
that amajority of the non-government people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-news-immigration-hillary-clinton-election-2016?page=with:block-57bca49de4b048662988f76f#block-57bca49de4b048662988f76f>
 she met with as secretary of state gave money to the corrupt Clinton 
Foundation. Friend, it was wrong then, and it is wrong now - and the foundation 
must be shut down immediately.”

What follows is a call-to-action pushing for his supporters to donate to his 
campaign in order to achieve this end.

“Crooked Hillary Clinton is the defender of the corrupt and rigged status quo 
- the Clintons have spent decades as insiders lining their own pockets and 
taking care of donors instead of the American people. Hillary and Bill’s 
pay-to-play racket has already gone on far too long - and with unknown cost to 
the security and safety of our people.”

We missed out on Cher’s introduction of Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> at a fundraiser in 
Provincetown, Massachusetts, by a single day - we’re still reeling - but the 
diva’s comments are still drawing controversy days later after she compared 
Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler and called him a “fucking idiot.”

The remarks, spoken in the Cape Cod vacation destination popular with LGBT 
East Coasters, were well-received by the crowd of mostly gay men in attendance, 
were preceded by a blaring of Cher’s single Woman’s World.

The mother of a British man accused of trying to grab a police officer’s gun 
to shoot Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at a campaign event in 
Las Vegas won approval from a judge on Tuesday tovisit her son in federal 
custody 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-michael-sandford-mother-plea>
 in Nevada.

Lynne Sandford of Dorking, England, wasn’t in court for a hearing at which 
Michael Steven Sandford’s defense attorney, Brenda Weksler, said he was in a 
“delicate mental state”.

In court filings, Weksler has said her client has been on suicide watch. He’s 
being held at a US government detention center west ofLas Vegas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/las-vegas>.

Sandford, who was 20 when he was arrested 18 June, didn’t speak in court. His 
trial is scheduled 3 October.

US magistrate judge Cam Ferenbach characterized the case as unique because of 
Sandford’s age, the nature of the charges and the “context” of the alleged 
offense.

Authorities say Sandford grabbed for a Las Vegas police officer’s gun 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/30/briton-michael-sandford-accused-trying-kill-donald-trump-is-charged-us>
 and later told federal agents that he drove from California to Las Vegas with 
a plan to kill Trump.

Prosecutors say he also said he practiced shooting at a gun range the day 
before Trump’s appearance.

It wasn’t clear if Trump, on stage at the Treasure Island hotel-casino, 
recognized a threat before officers escorted Sandford out of the 1,500-seat 
theater.

Hillary Clinton rubbed elbows and collected checks from some of Hollywood’s 
biggest stars at the Los Angeles home of Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel. 
Leonardo DiCaprio was in fact due to host the fundraising event but a 
scheduling conflict kept the actor in New York longer than expected, according 
to a report inPeople Magazine 
<http://www.people.com/article/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-host-leonardo-dicaprio-hillary-clinton-fundraiser>

Look WHO DID come over for lunch... Wow. #ImWithHer

DiCaprio didn’t want to “leave Hillary hanging”, a source told People, so he 
called his friends Timberlake and Biel and asked if they could host in a pinch. 
The new parents agreed and moved the Tuesday fundraiser to their home.

The glitzy late morning fundraiser drew around 100 guests, including Jennifer 
Aniston, Jamie Foxx and Tobey Maguire. Based on figures provided by the 
campaign, she raised at approximately $3.34m at her the Timberlake-Biel 
fundraiser.

After leaving Los Angeles, Clinton will continue her fundraising pilgrimage, 
heading south for two fundraisers in Laguna Beach before returning upstate to 
attend a final fundraiser in Oakland.

On Monday night, Clinton stopped the by the Los Angeles home of former 
basketball player Magic Johnson and his wife after taping an appearance on 
Jimmy Kimmel Live. Around 500 people attended the event at the Johnson home and 
guests donated $2,700.

Donald Trump’s shifting political and business loyalties are laid bare in a 
new book that challenges his credentials as a conviction politician in often 
lurid detail.


Despite a recent campaign focus on letting “Trump be Trump”, the 431-page 
biography instead charts the career of many Trumps: the showman, the womaniser, 
and a business partner who quickly ditches failing schemes.

The book, the first of several expected on Trump, was compiled by a team of 
two dozen Washington Post journalists, led by Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, 
during a three-month period earlier this year, in which they had some 20 hours 
of interviews with him.

Challenged with evidence that he had changed party affiliation seven times 
between 1999 and 2012, the Republican candidate defended his political 
flip-flopping as a necessary expediency. “I think it had to do more with 
practicality, because if you’re going to run for office, you would have had to 
make friends,” he told the authors.

He declined to say whether he had voted for Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, for whom he once hosted 
a packed penthouse fundraiser and donated campaign contributions six times over 
a decade. “I felt it was an obligation to get along, including with the 
Clintons,” he once said, according to the book titled Trump Revealed: An 
American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money and Power.

But the team of reporters also reveal new accounts of business reversals, 
including interviews with some of the victims of a collapsed Florida property 
scheme who sued after discovering that he had little responsibility for it 
other than receiving income for the use of his name.

Instead, reports the Washington Post book, one of the project’s actual 
developers had pleaded guilty in a separate Wall Street fraud case involving 
mafia crime families. Trump insists he “barely knew” the man.

Trump advisor Roger Stone muses whether Huma Abedin underwent female genital 
mutilation

Roger Stone, a longtime informal advisor to Donald Trump and even longer-time 
conspiracy theorist, conferred with fellow Trump supporter and conspiracy 
theorist Alex Jones on the latter’s radio program today about whether Hillary 
Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who was born in Michigan and raised in Saudi Arabia, 
has undergonefemale genital mutilation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/female-genital-mutilation>:

“I think she’s a Saudi asset,” Stone said of the longtime aide, who began as 
an intern for Clinton more than two decades ago. “The media keeps saying her 
mother’s a prominent feminist. No. Her mother’s a prominent advocate for 
genital mutilation. She has written extensively about genital mutilation.”

“Did Huma have her genitals cut off?” Jones asked offhandedly.

“That I cannot tell you,” Stone responded. “But what I can tell you is-”

“I mean, it’s fair, I don’t mean that to be crass!” Jones offered.

Abedin has been the target of conspiracy theories regarding her racial 
background since Clinton became secretary of state, including that she is a 
hidden fifth columnist for the Muslim Brotherhood. None of these rumors have 
ever been substantiated.

Indiana governor and Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence got a 
haircut, and CNN was ON IT:

The highlight of the livestream: At the haircut’s conclusion (around the 19:40 
mark) the barber asks Mike Pence his name, and Pence responds that he is 
running withDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

The barber’s facial expression upon hearing that news is, perhaps, not what 
Pence was hoping for.

AP: Majority of Clinton's outside meetings were with Clinton Foundation donors

More than half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took with non-governmental 
interests during her tenure as secretary of state were with people who had 
donated money to the Clinton Foundation,the Associated Press reported this 
afternoon 
<http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CAMPAIGN_2016_CLINTON_FOUNDATION?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-08-23-14-35-04>
, an astonishing percentage that underscores previous critiques of Clinton’s 
connection with the organization during her time at the state department.

Of the 154 people from private interests who met with or had scheduled 
telephone conversations with Clinton while she served as secretary of state 
between 2009 and 2013 had donated money to the Clinton Foundation or had 
pledged to do so, giving as much as a combined $156 million to the non-profit. 
Of those, 20 gave more than $1 million to Clinton’s family foundation, which 
was founded during Bill Clinton’s second presidential term with the stated 
mission of “strengthen[ing] the capacity of people throughout the world to meet 
the challenges of global interdependence.”

The meetings, which do not appear to violate the law, nonetheless paint a 
picture of Foggy Bottom as a “pay-to-play” arena for the global elite:

Donors who were granted time with Clinton included an internationally known 
economist who asked for her help as the Bangladesh government pressured him to 
resign from a nonprofit bank he ran; a Wall Street executive who sought 
Clinton’s help with a visa problem and Estee Lauder executives who were listed 
as meeting with Clinton while her department worked with the firm’s corporate 
charity to counter gender-based violence in South Africa.

The figures do not include Clinton’s meeting with the representatives of at 
least 16 foreign governments who had donated as much as $170 million to the 
Clinton Foundation.

 * Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/kellyanne-conway-is-donald-trumps-last-chance-winning>
 outlined her vision of how the Republican nominee could win in November 
despite consistently trailing in polls, during an interview with Channel 4 in 
the United Kingdom for the documentary President Trump: Can He Really Win? 
Conway insisted that Trump’s support was not reflected in polls because of the
perceived social stigma of supporting the Republican nominee.“Donald Trump 
performs better consistently better in online polling where a human being is 
not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the elections 
… it’s become socially desirable, especially if you’re a college educated 
person in the US, to say that you’re against Donald Trump,” said Conway. 
 * More than half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took with non-governmental 
interests during her tenure as secretary of state were with people who had 
donated money to the Clinton Foundation,the Associated Press reported this 
afternoon 
<http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CAMPAIGN_2016_CLINTON_FOUNDATION?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-08-23-14-35-04>
, an astonishing percentage that underscores previous critiques of Clinton’s 
connection with the organization during her time at the state department. 
 * Of the 154 people from private interests who met with or had scheduled 
telephone conversations with Clinton while she served as secretary of state 
between 2009 and 2013 had donated money to the Clinton Foundation or had 
pledged to do so, giving as much as a combined $156 million to the non-profit. 
Of those, 20 gave more than $1 million to Clinton’s family foundation, which 
was founded during Bill Clinton’s second presidential term with the stated 
mission of “strengthen[ing] the capacity of people throughout the world to meet 
the challenges of global interdependence.”

 * Hillary Clinton will denounce Donald Trump and his team of political 
advisers for their embrace of the “alt-right”, an online movement where white 
supremacy, nationalism, nativism and racism flourish. In a speech in Reno, 
Nevada, on Thursday, Clinton will argue that Trump’s “alt-right” brand is 
wrongfully pushing a dystopian view of America and sowing division in an effort 
to mobilize anxious Americans. According to a campaign aide, Clinton will 
contrast Trump’s “divisive views and dangerous temperament” with a vision of an 
America that is “stronger together”.

 * Andrea Tantaros, the former co-host of the Fox News program The Five, has 
filed a complaint in New York state supreme court that accuses former Fox chief 
Roger Ailes of being a “sexual predator” and names former senator Scott Brown 
and Fox host Bill O’Reilly. “Fox News masquerades as defender of traditional 
family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-fueled, Playboy 
Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny,” the
complaint says 
<http://www.politico.com/media/f/?id=00000156-b7e7-de38-a3df-b7ff973d0002>. 
Ailes took a $40m severance package last month after former host Gretchen 
Carlson, current host Megan Kelly and others accused him of sexual harassment. 
 * Roger Stone, a longtime informal advisor to Donald Trump and even 
longer-time conspiracy theorist, conferred with fellow Trump supporter and 
conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on the latter’s radio program today about

When Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> visited 
the Indian city of Pune, his private jet was so large that he was forced to 
wait on board for nearly an hour while airport staff cobbled together a 
makeshift landing ramp for him to come down to earth.

According to his business partner Atul Chordia, Trump remained jovial despite 
the glitch during his grand entrance in August 2014. “He was joking around with 
the staff – he could have made a scene about it, but he didn’t,” said Chordia 
in a telephone interview. “He was nice, friendly. He was good with everyone.”

A slump in the US market had brought the real estate tycoon east in search of 
new opportunities; that search brought him to Pune, a sleepy city in western
India <https://www.theguardian.com/world/india>.

To welcome Trump, 500 of Pune’s richest and most powerful people attended a 
banquet hosted by Chordia’s Panchshil Realty, the firm that was bringing the 
Trump franchise to India for the first time.

The Bollywood actress and beauty queen Lara Dutta interviewed Trump while a 
phalanx of cameramen from local television stations jostled for room in the 
press stand. Movie stars such as Rishi and Ranbir Kapoor and wealthy Indian 
business families had already bought apartments at Trump Towers Pune, reporters 
were told.

Each 6,000-sq-ft, five-bedroom apartment cost a whopping 150m rupees ($2.2m) – 
around 25% more than similar properties in the surrounding Kalyani Nagar 
neighbourhood, just because of Trump’s name. On subsequent trips to India, 
Trump told reporters that Trump Towers would be “good for India”.


Construction work at Trump Towers Pune is well under way, but two years on 
from that glitzy launch, the project is the subject of two investigations by 
the Pune state government and local police, after discrepancies were found in 
documents related to the land on which the luxury apartment block is being 
built.

Saurabh Rao, the district collector (or top administrative officer) for Pune 
state, told the Guardian: “We are currently in the investigation process. We 
have been conducting an inquiry for the last five or six months.” The results 
of the investigation are due to be published imminently, Rao said.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> does not need 
to apologize for his incendiary remarks about Mexicans and an American-born 
federal judge’s heritage, said Helen Aguirre Ferré, the Republican National 
Committee’s director of Hispanic communications.

Asked whether the Republican presidential nominee owed the Hispanic community 
an apology, Aguirre Ferré was frank. “Don’t wait for an apology – ask for 
solutions to the problems,” she said on the Guardian’sPolitics for Humans 
podcast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2016/aug/23/latino-vote-trump-jose-vargas-helen-ferre-trump-podcast>
.

“He needs to explain his tone and why he used the words he used and what he 
means by that – what are his policies and those ofHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and how his are the ones 
that are really the answer to greater shared prosperity in our great country,” 
said Aguirre Ferré, a veteran journalist and adviser to the presidential 
campaign of former Florida governor Jeb Bush.

Trump launched his campaign more than a year ago by referring to Mexicans as 
rapists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes>
 and criminals. He has promised to build a “big, beautiful” wall along the 
US-Mexico border paid for by Mexico. He tweeted a photo of himself eating a 
taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo with the caption “I love Hispanics!” And he
questioned the judicial fitness

Five states and a group of Catholic healthcare providers launched a federal 
lawsuit 
<http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Franciscan-Alliance-et-al-v.-Burwell-et-al-Complaint-FINAL.pdf>
 on Tuesday challenging an Obama administration rule banning discrimination 
against transgender individuals in a healthcare setting.

Reynolds/EPA 
The lawsuit is the latest major addition to a series of challenges 
conservative states are mounting against the administration as the president 
attempts to expand transgender rights through executive action.

On Monday, a federal judge in Texas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/22/obama-transgender-students-public-schools-rules-blocked>
 issued a nationwide injunction against the administration’s requirement for 
all public schools to give transgender students access to the bathrooms 
consistent with their gender identity. Barack Obama announced that policy in 
May and warned that schools failing to comply would risk the loss of millions 
in federal funds. More than 20 states have sincejoined a legal campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/08/states-sue-federal-government-transgender-bathroom-policy>
 to block the requirement.

The rule <https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-18/pdf/2016-11458.pdf>, 
which became final on 18 May, prohibits insurance companies and individual 
healthcare providers from refusing to provide or cover a health service they 
typically offer on the basis that a patient is trans. It does not require 
doctors to perform or insurance companies to cover transition-related 
healthcare services if the service or procedure is not normally offered.

Leading Tuesday’s lawsuit are Texas, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Kansas and Kentucky. 
In their challenge, theyargue <http://www.becketfund.org/franciscanalliance/> 
that the administration’s rule “forces doctors to perform gender transition 
procedures on children”.

“On pain of significant financial liability, the regulation forces doctors to 
perform controversial and sometimes harmful medical procedures ostensibly 
designed to permanently change an individual’s sex – including the sex of 
children,” thelawsuit 
<http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Franciscan-Alliance-et-al-v.-Burwell-et-al-Complaint-FINAL.pdf>
 claims.


Proponents of the rule called these claims “ridiculous” and “full of 
inaccuracies”.
 
In an interview airing later tonight on Sean Hannity’s show on Fox News, 
Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> appeared to walk back his 
signature campaign issue - immigration - by telling the conservative pundit 
that there’s room for “softening” his stance on deporting undocumented 
immigrants, so long as they have contributed to American society.

“There certainly can be a softening because we’re not looking to hurt people,” 
Trump said, in response to a question posed by the host in which he was asked 
whether he might be able to accommodate “those people that contribute to 
society.”

But, Trump cautioned, “we are going to follow the laws of this country.”

The stance is a massive reversal of Trump’s previous stance on the issue, in 
which he declared that “deportation squads” would forcefully remove more than 
11 million undocumented immigrants currently estimated to live in the US.

The FBI is investigating cyber intrusions targeting reporters of the New York 
Times <https://www.theguardian.com/media/new-york-times> and is looking into 
whether Russian intelligence agencies are responsible for the acts, a US 
official told the Associated Press.

The cyberattacks are believed to have targeted individual reporters, but 
investigators don’t believe the newspaper’s entire network was compromised, 
according to the official, who was briefed on the investigation but was not 
authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.

CNN first reported the FBI’s investigation.

It was not immediately clear how many reporters may have been affected, or how 
many email accounts were targeted.

The news comes as federal authorities continue to investigate a breach of the 
Democratic National Committee that outside cybersecurity experts have 
attributed to Russian intelligence agencies and that led to the posting of 
embarrassing internal emails.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other Democratic entities 
have also been affected. Earlier this month, the House minority leader advised 
fellow Democrats not to allow family members to answer their phones or read 
incoming texts after a mix of personal and official information of Democratic 
members and hundreds of congressional staff – purportedly from a hack of the 
DCCC – was posted online.

Donald Trump is fundraising off of his pledge to “shut down” the Clinton 
Foundation if he is elected president, emailing supporters that the non-profit 
is “the most corrupt enterprise in political history” and vowing its 
destruction, as well as an investigation intoHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>.

“It is now clear that the Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in 
political history,” Trump’s campaign wrote in the email. “We’ve now learned 
that amajority of the non-government people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-news-immigration-hillary-clinton-election-2016?page=with:block-57bca49de4b048662988f76f#block-57bca49de4b048662988f76f>
 she met with as secretary of state gave money to the corrupt Clinton 
Foundation. Friend, it was wrong then, and it is wrong now - and the foundation 
must be shut down immediately.”

What follows is a call-to-action pushing for his supporters to donate to his 
campaign in order to achieve this end.

“Crooked Hillary Clinton is the defender of the corrupt and rigged status quo 
- the Clintons have spent decades as insiders lining their own pockets and 
taking care of donors instead of the American people. Hillary and Bill’s 
pay-to-play racket has already gone on far too long - and with unknown cost to 
the security and safety of our people.”

Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler and called him a “fucking idiot.”

The remarks, spoken in the Cape Cod vacation destination popular with LGBT 
East Coasters, were well-received by the crowd of mostly gay men in attendance, 
were preceded by a blaring of Cher’s single Woman’s World.

Lynne Sandford of Dorking, England, wasn’t in court for a hearing at which 
Michael Steven Sandford’s defense attorney, Brenda Weksler, said he was in a 
“delicate mental state”.

In court filings, Weksler has said her client has been on suicide watch. He’s 
being held at a US government detention center west ofLas Vegas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/las-vegas>.

Sandford, who was 20 when he was arrested 18 June, didn’t speak in court. His 
trial is scheduled 3 October.

US magistrate judge Cam Ferenbach characterized the case as unique because of 
Sandford’s age, the nature of the charges and the “context” of the alleged 
offense.

Authorities say Sandford grabbed for a Las Vegas police officer’s gun 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/30/briton-michael-sandford-accused-trying-kill-donald-trump-is-charged-us>
 and later told federal agents that he drove from California to Las Vegas with 
a plan to kill Trump.

Prosecutors say he also said he practiced shooting at a gun range the day 
before Trump’s appearance.

It wasn’t clear if Trump, on stage at the Treasure Island hotel-casino, 
recognized a threat before officers escorted Sandford out of the 1,500-seat 
theater.

DiCaprio didn’t want to “leave Hillary hanging”, a source told People, so he 
called his friends Timberlake and Biel and asked if they could host in a pinch. 
The new parents agreed and moved the Tuesday fundraiser to their home.

The glitzy late morning fundraiser drew around 100 guests, including Jennifer 
Aniston, Jamie Foxx and Tobey Maguire. Based on figures provided by the 
campaign, she raised at approximately $3.34m at her the Timberlake-Biel 
fundraiser.

After leaving Los Angeles, Clinton will continue her fundraising pilgrimage, 
heading south for two fundraisers in Laguna Beach before returning upstate to 
attend a final fundraiser in Oakland.

On Monday night, Clinton stopped the by the Los Angeles home of former 
basketball player Magic Johnson and his wife after taping an appearance on 
Jimmy Kimmel Live. Around 500 people attended the event at the Johnson home and 
guests donated $2,700.

 
Donald Trump’s shifting political and business loyalties are laid bare in a 
new book that challenges his credentials as a conviction politician in often 
lurid detail.


Despite a recent campaign focus on letting “Trump be Trump”, the 431-page 
biography instead charts the career of many Trumps: the showman, the womaniser, 
and a business partner who quickly ditches failing schemes.

The book, the first of several expected on Trump, was compiled by a team of 
two dozen Washington Post journalists, led by Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, 
during a three-month period earlier this year, in which they had some 20 hours 
of interviews with him.

Challenged with evidence that he had changed party affiliation seven times 
between 1999 and 2012, the Republican candidate defended his political 
flip-flopping as a necessary expediency. “I think it had to do more with 
practicality, because if you’re going to run for office, you would have had to 
make friends,” he told the authors.

He declined to say whether he had voted for Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, for whom he once hosted 
a packed penthouse fundraiser and donated campaign contributions six times over 
a decade. “I felt it was an obligation to get along, including with the 
Clintons,” he once said, according to the book titled Trump Revealed: An 
American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money and Power.

But the team of reporters also reveal new accounts of business reversals, 
including interviews with some of the victims of a collapsed Florida property 
scheme who sued after discovering that he had little responsibility for it 
other than receiving income for the use of his name.

Instead, reports the Washington Post book, one of the project’s actual 
developers had pleaded guilty in a separate Wall Street fraud case involving 
mafia crime families. Trump insists he “barely knew” the man.

Roger Stone, a longtime informal advisor to Donald Trump and even longer-time 
conspiracy theorist, conferred with fellow Trump supporter and conspiracy 
theorist Alex Jones on the latter’s radio program today about whether Hillary 
Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who was born in Michigan and raised in Saudi Arabia, 
has undergonefemale genital mutilation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/female-genital-mutilation>:

“I think she’s a Saudi asset,” Stone said of the longtime aide, who began as 
an intern for Clinton more than two decades ago. “The media keeps saying her 
mother’s a prominent feminist. No. Her mother’s a prominent advocate for 
genital mutilation. She has written extensively about genital mutilation.”

“Did Huma have her genitals cut off?” Jones asked offhandedly.

“That I cannot tell you,” Stone responded. “But what I can tell you is-”

“I mean, it’s fair, I don’t mean that to be crass!” Jones offered.

Abedin has been the target of conspiracy theories regarding her racial 
background since Clinton became secretary of state, including that she is a 
hidden fifth columnist for the Muslim Brotherhood. None of these rumors have 
ever been substantiated.
 
Indiana governor and Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence got a 
haircut, and CNN was ON IT:

The highlight of the livestream: At the haircut’s conclusion (around the 19:40 
mark) the barber asks Mike Pence his name, and Pence responds that he is 
running withDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

The barber’s facial expression upon hearing that news is, perhaps, not what 
Pence was hoping for.
 
More than half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took with non-governmental 
interests during her tenure as secretary of state were with people who had 
donated money to the Clinton Foundation,the Associated Press reported this 
afternoon 
<http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CAMPAIGN_2016_CLINTON_FOUNDATION?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-08-23-14-35-04>
, an astonishing percentage that underscores previous critiques of Clinton’s 
connection with the organization during her time at the state department.

Of the 154 people from private interests who met with or had scheduled 
telephone conversations with Clinton while she served as secretary of state 
between 2009 and 2013 had donated money to the Clinton Foundation or had 
pledged to do so, giving as much as a combined $156 million to the non-profit. 
Of those, 20 gave more than $1 million to Clinton’s family foundation, which 
was founded during Bill Clinton’s second presidential term with the stated 
mission of “strengthen[ing] the capacity of people throughout the world to meet 
the challenges of global interdependence.”

The meetings, which do not appear to violate the law, nonetheless paint a 
picture of Foggy Bottom as a “pay-to-play” arena for the global elite:

Donors who were granted time with Clinton included an internationally known 
economist who asked for her help as the Bangladesh government pressured him to 
resign from a nonprofit bank he ran; a Wall Street executive who sought 
Clinton’s help with a visa problem and Estee Lauder executives who were listed 
as meeting with Clinton while her department worked with the firm’s corporate 
charity to counter gender-based violence in South Africa.

The figures do not include Clinton’s meeting with the representatives of at 
least 16 foreign governments who had donated as much as $170 million to the 
Clinton Foundation.
 
According to a White House report, prior to his departure from Baton Rouge 
Metropolitan Airport today, the President will meet with thefamily of Alton 
Sterling as well as the families of deceased and injured officers of the Baton 
Rouge Police Department and East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office.
