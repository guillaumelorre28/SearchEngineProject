West Indian star cricketer Deandra Dottin has been taken to hospital after a 
sickening headclash with teammate Laura Harris whilst fielding.

Playing for the Brisbane Heat during their Women’s Big Bash League encounter 
with the Melbourne Stars, the two collided at pace while attempting to prevent 
a boundary from opposition batsman Meg Lanning.

Dottin was stretchered from the field after the incident and was taken to 
hospital with a suspected concussion, with Harris appeared to fare slightly 
better, receiving medical attention at the ground.

The incident occurred during the 11th over of the Stars’ innings when captain 
Lanning lofted Heat medium-pacer Haidee Birkett over midwicket.

The ball fell between Dottin and Harris just inside the rope and in their 
haste to attempt to prevent a boundary the converging pair collided at high 
speed and clashed heads.

Both suffered heavy falls, with Harris crashing into the picket fence while 
Dottin appeared to land on a team kit bag just in front of the fence.

It’s the second concussion in as many days for the Brisbane Heat in the WBBL 
with Southern Stars fast bowler Holly Ferling sustaining a head knock while 
attempting a boundary catch in their previous match.

Despite the absence of Ferling and the injury to Dottin and Harris the Heat 
won the match by five runs, posting 5-129 from their 20 overs before 
restricting the Stars to 6-124.
