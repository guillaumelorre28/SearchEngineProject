A correspondent writes:- “I was once lucky enough to be taken round Dorchester

 with two friends by Thomas Hardy. He led us down the old High Street and into 
the warehouse at the back of one of the shops where he believed he had 
discovered an Elizabethan theatre, and after that to the tiny thatched cottage 
on the river bank, once the hangman’s house, where, he told us, he used to go 
after dark with the other boys of the town in order to climb on the window-sill 
and peep through the blind - not out of idle curiosity, he explained, but 
because they all felt less terrified of the hangman as a bogy if they saw him 
going to bed like any other ordinary mortal.

“Mr. Hardy also pointed out the spot, I think outside the Black Bear Hotel, 
where he remembered the public hangings taking place. He had never forgotten 
that the hour for the executions was fixed at ten minutes past twelve, in case 
the midday coach should bring a reprieve. To hear him speak of these early 
reminiscences was to gain some insight into the sensitive spirit that suffered 
so acutely all through life at any manifestation of human suffering or human 
cruelty.

“It seemed to please him when he heard that ‘The Return of the Native’ was at 
least one reader’s favourite among his novels, and he pointed out from the end 
of his garden the heather-covered hill in the distance that was the original of 
Rainbarrow in the Egdon Heath of his story.”
