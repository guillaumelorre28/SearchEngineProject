The 26-year-old underwent surgery after clashing heads in the outfield with 
team-mate Laura Harris while trying to stop a boundary against Melbourne Stars 
last week.

Despite being replaced, Dottin is able to regain her place in the Heat side 
should she recover.

Yorkshire captain Winfield had been travelling Australia when she received the 
call to join the Heat.

She averages almost 24 runs in her 18 Twenty20 international matches for 
England with a strike rate of 112.
