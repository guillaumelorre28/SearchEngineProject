Summing up

So, a year that began for England with Ben Stokes flaying South Africa’s 
bowlers all over the park in one of the most astonishing batting assaults of 
our times, on a shirtfront, ends with England being on the receiving end of 
something comparable, from Nair yesterday, also on a shirtfront. The difference 
is that England only drew in Cape Town, whereas they were battered by an 
innings here. This might be interpreted as symbolic of serious and alarming 
decline, though over-reaction would not be wise, not least because India were 
so very good, ruthlessly transformed from the shambles they were in England in 
2014. England are a better side than they were two or three years ago, but 
they’ve clearly stagnated in recent months (and Cook has just admitted as much 
talking to Sky), confused at times in approach and selection, still befuddled 
by the best spinners, and looking tired of mind and body. There’ll be much 
speculation about Alastair Cook’s future now in the days/weeks/maybe months to 
come. “It’s not the place for this kind of discussion,” the captain tells Sky, 
“I need to go away and think about things.”

He and his team will need a good Christmas break, and we hope you have one 
too, after a rollercoaster year of Test cricket. Thanks for all your emails, 
tweets, pedantry and humour. Season’s greetings all. Bye.

Kohli is up now. “It’s evidence of the character that we possess through the 
side,” he says of the second consecutive innings win. “We wanted the youngsters 
to step up, someone like KL and Karun, two not so good Test matches and then 
they step up here. It’s always tricky when you score 477 then concede a deficit 
of 281.” He praises his team’s intensity and the bowlers for hitting the right 
areas. “We’ve worked hard day-in day-out, there’s a lot of mutual respect and 
good friendship, and that’s evident on the field. No one’s playing selfish 
cricket.” This has indeed been a feature of India’s play in this series. And he 
signs off by praising India’s quick bowlers for their pace and their potency.

“No excuses,” says Cook. “India were the better team and deserved to win. It 
was a very good fifth-day wicket, it turned out of the rough, but we got 
ourselves in a good position and didn’t see it out. It’s a game of missed 
opportunities, we keep dropping vital chances and India kept punishing us. It’s 
very tough playing five Tests in six weeks, but no excuses” he admits. And he 
looks tired.

Man of the match award goes to Karun Nair – no surprise there. “It’ll take a 
couple of days to sink in,” he says, shyly. “Hats off to the team for playing 
so well. I’ve been learning each day through the series and trying to make my 
game better.” It looks in pretty handy nick as it is.

Two ways of looking at it, from you the public. Here’s Tom Sloan harrumphing: 
“What a gutless showing from England! Some of the modes of dismissal were 
nothing short of a disgrace. Total embarrassment.” And Robert Taylor with some 
mitigation: “I confess I haven’t been able to watch much of this test (presents 
and work - to pay for the presents - taking priority this week) so please 
educate me if I’m wrong but I do find the attacks on Cook slightly unfair. We 
have lost this series because the Indian spin bowlers have out-bowled ours... 
is that his fault? Would Root as captain have returned significantly better 
from them than 113 overs, 6 maidens, 4 for 472 in this test? Is it Cook’s fault 
that Anderson (our best seam bowler in India last time around) has been injured 
or short on match practice?”

The post-match interviews begin with Ashwin and Jadeja revelling in the 
moment, praising each other generously and honouring the magnitude of the 
achievement. There’s a case for Jadeja to be MOTM here.

After win in SA, England went 5th in the rankings. Will end 2016 there too. 
Despite flirtation with top, it's been Test stagnation at best

The India players are now treating a thrilled crowd to a lap of honour. What a 
happy, well-grooved set of cricketers they now look – they haven’t really 
exhibited any weaknesses in their team all series (except, perhaps, behind the 
stumps). You could even conceivably pick an all-India XI from a combined team 
this time. England just haven’t been able to cope in the end, though we may 
remember that after the first Test the mood was upbeat after a very 
accomplished performance in Rajkot. That was, by a massive distance, as good as 
it was going to get.

Wicket! Ball c Kohli b Jadeja 0, England 207 all out. India win by an innings 
and 75 runs

88th over: England 207 (Buttler 6 not out) Game over. And it’s a seven-wicket 
haul for Jadeja, who starts the over by finding Broad’s outside edge with a 
tantalising turner but it’s along the ground. He doesn’t have to wait long, 
though,to strike – the next ball spits in at the left-hander and is nudged up 
and round the corner to leg-slip. The umpire takes his time to raise the finger 
but Broad – not a natural walker – knows it’s not worth reviewing and trudges 
off. They’re all round the bat for Ball, who’s beaten all ends up by a 
brilliant leg-break first ball andthen dismissed, with a simple edge to Kohli, 
who, appropriately wraps up the series with the catch. Another England 
collapse, another emphatic victory for this imperious India side.

87th over: England 207-8 (Buttler 6, Broad 1) Slightly surprising bowling 
change now, with Mishra replacing Yadav, but he manages to draw a loose shot 
from Buttler – a nudge and miss outside leg-stump – but the batsman is 
otherwise orthodox and defensive in a maiden.

More crazy, unworkable Bolshevik talk, from Matthew Brown: “Regarding Robert 
Spittlehouse’s approach to avoiding the curse of captaincy by avoiding 
captaincy: we could always do something even more radical, and pick a bowler as 
captain. I know, people will just laugh at that one.”

86th over: England 207-8 (Buttler 6, Broad 1) Jadeja replaces Ashwin and keeps 
Broad on the defensive (he can’t really do anything else here), inducing one 
play and miss in another maiden.

85th over: England 207-8 (Buttler 6, Broad 1) Broad thinks he’s got off the 
mark against Yadav with a single off his hips down to fine leg but umpire 
Erasmus rules that he played no shot so sends him back to face more attempted 
legside entrapment, and is almost snared fending one down to fine leg on the up 
but it eludes fielders – Broad does get his first run this time though. Buttler 
is then prevented from farming the strike by ba couple of rasping shorter 
balls. You’ve got to feel for Jadeja and Rahul – eight wickets (at least) and a 
score of 199 respectively yet they’ve surely got no chance whatsoever of the 
man of the match award.

We have 12 overs/49 minutes remaining.

84th over: England 206-8 (Buttler 6, Broad 0) Ashwin attacks at Buttler, who 
mostly plays late and wisely but looks less certain when he attempts to get 
forward at one that gets caught between bat and boot. He can’t keep the strike 
this time though. A maiden.

83rd over: England 206-8 (Buttler 6, Broad 0) Yadav mixes it up a bit, finding 
as much bounce with new ball as he did with old. Buttler clips a single to 
midwicket off the fifth ball, cognisant that he’ll probably have to take most 
of the strike from hereon in. With that in mind, he turns down a suggested 
single from Broad after a tentative nudge off the left-hander’s hips.

This collapse all began with Moeen, of course, about whom Jonathan Gresty 
offered this statistical curio a few overs ago: “Having scored exactly the same 
number of runs in this test as his bowling went for, Moeen being dismissed for 
44 didn’t surprise me. Now we just need Rashid to score the same number of runs 
as he went for and we might just survive....”

82nd over: England 205-8 (Buttler 5, Broad 0) Ashwin enjoys a bowl with the 
new ball, getting some nice swing from it with his arm ball, but also conceding 
four byes with one that drifts down the legside. Buttler dabs a shorter ball 
away on the legside for a single before Ashwin turns one sharply away from 
Broad as part of an lbw set-up: the next ball is duly straighter and hits him 
on the pads, prompting a cheeky review. It’s missing off, however, but it won’t 
fill England with any confidence that they can somehow survive the next hour. 
And that’s drinks.

81st over: England 200-8 (Buttler 4, Broad 0) There’s no way back for England 
now.Kohli decides he will take the new ball, despite the dominance of the 
spinners in recent overs, bringing Yadav back in place of Mishra.And it works! 
Buttler adds a single before Rashid dollies up a simple catch with a leading 
edge.

“Re Robert Spittlehouse’s suggestion of replacing captains with democratic 
voting,” writes Jen Oram in an email entitled “Corbyn cricket”, “isn’t that how 
Admiral Collingwood ran his ship, asking everyone’s opinion before doing 
anything? It sort of worked okay but he got through about 30 overs a day, which 
is slow even by Cook’s standards.” Revolution is a slow, ponderous, dull 
business. And then it collapses in a heap of mutual denunciation. Which might, 
still, arguably be more fun from an English perspective than all this.

80th over: England 199-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 2) That wicketless lightweight 
Ashwin replaces Jadeja, with four close fielders in around the bat, and has 
Rashid in trouble with one that raps pad but is missing and another that jags 
out of the rough in at Rashid’s glove but doesn’t quite carry. Terrific over.

We’re throwing the kitchen sink around now on the selection question: “What 
England should have done is just select 11 batsmen and then tried to score 7, 8 
or 900 in the first innings,” writes Peter Salmon. “I’m not sure having no 
bowlers (except Stoles and, I guess, Mooen) would have made much difference to 
the Indian score, and they could have secured a draw. Perhaps next time.”

79th over: England 199-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 2) Mishra continues, as well he 
might as he’s bowled very well since tea, but Rashid reads him well, flicking 
another single square on the legside in an otherwise defensive over.

78th over: England 198-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 1) Rashid gets off the mark then 
Buttler sees out the over. He wants to get forward to negate the spin but has 
no option but to be defensive. This could be quite the test of his red-ball 
credentials. “Just woken up,” claims Matt Emerson “haven’t checked the score 
yet - what sort of total do you think we need to set India to get them 
nervous...” About 400 should do it Matt. Could be done.

77th over: England 197-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 0) Mishra bowls. England defend. A 
maiden. “All the hallmarks of the second Bangladesh Test; big opening 
partnership then a brainless collapse,” tuts Kevin Wilson. “I know they’re all 
mentally exhausted and probably can’t wait to fly home but that’s not much of 
an excuse.” There is a germ of an excuse though. Seven Tests in two months, 
with practically no warm-up time, is the most exhausting schedule I can ever 
remember. And now there are no Tests for more than six months.

76th over: England 197-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 0) Jadeja seeks to turn the screw, 
rattling through another over with the concession of only a single to Buttler. 
Only four overs to the new ball – will they take it?

75th over: England 196-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 0) India are rampant. Buttler 
nudges Mishra round the corner to get off the mark with a single. Then Mishra
accounts for Dawson, with a googly that’s tossed up in the perfect area and the 
No8 has no answer to it. Bowled neck and crop.

What we need in these rudderless confusing times is some anarcho-syndicalism, 
a rejection of the Cult of the Leader. Here’s Robert Spittlehouse: “In response 
to Andrew Porter’s fears (68th over) about the spread of the England Captain’s 
Batting Curse to even notional or pre-elective captains, we should consider and 
disseminate rival concepts to contain the outbreak. In this spirit, isn’t it 
time to abandon the role of captain all together? The team could become an 
autonomous collective, with simple fielding changes and appeals ratified by a 
simple majority, whereas a two-thirds majority would be required for bowling 
rotations and batting order alterations. Problem solved.”

74th over: England 193-6 (Buttler 0, Dawson 0) It’s going to be 4-0. It’s in 
the bag. Stokes is confounded by a ball from Jadeja that just sticks on him, 
forcing him to mistime a chip to mid-on where Nairtakes an easy catch. Can 
Dawson be the batting hero again on debut? He’s tormented early on when Jadeja 
finds a low edge with some sharp turn but it doesn’t carry to Kohli at slip. 
Let’s change the subject – sort of. Here’s Lee Smith: “Could you please ask 
Will West what kind of dubious Darwinian or Frankenstein chicanery is taking 
place at Chez West in light of the revelation that his hamster has HANDS! Is he 
really Sid from Toy Story?”

73rd over: England 193-5 (Stokes 23, Buttler 0) It’s slightly surprising that 
Kohli keeps Mishra on here, given the chance to really turn the screw, but the 
third spinner’s got his tail up too and Stokes isn’t looking completely 
comfortable against him. He does nudge a single away in front of square on the 
legside though. Buttler plays out the over. England’s two most attacking 
batsmen have a right old rearguard action to pull off here.

72nd over: England 192-5 (Stokes 22, Buttler 0) Is this the decisive moment? 
Moeen goes, trying to hit Jadeja over the top, not connecting properly and 
Ashwin takes a smart catch above his head. Why oh why? There’s nearly another 
wicket, as a bat-pad chance off new man Buttler isn’t quite taken at short leg.

Wicket! Moeen c Ashwin b Jadeja 44, England 192-5

Oh no Mo! Moeen is tempted to hit Jadeja over the top, doesn’t get hold of it 
properly and it’s taken above his head by Ashwin at mid-on.

71st over: England 192-4 (Moeen 44, Stokes 22) Mishra continues to rattle 
through his overs, conceding a Moeen flicked single only from this one. 
Meanwhile, here’s the latest episode of My OBO Family and other Animals: 
“Kimberley Thonger.. Brilliant name, brilliant post,” gauntlet-throws Will 
West. “But taking the field with Chris Drew and his cat will be our Syrian 
hamster Buttercup who, through hanging repeatedly from the roof of her cage 
one- handed has developed a grip and agility to match Jonty Rhodes in his pomp. 
Catches win matches!”

70th over: England 191-4 (Moeen 43, Stokes 22) Chance! Jadeja drifts one into 
Moeen, it brushes bat and pad but the man at short leg is slow to react and 
only parries it onto the ground. Unfazed, Moeen sweeps confidently past the 
same fielder for one. Plenty of variety from Jadeja though, and Stokes swings 
and misses at one that he misreads. Patel misread it too though – it’s four 
byes. Patel might be a sparky batsman but he’s not the complete keeper by any 
means.

69th over: England 186-4 (Moeen 42, Stokes 22) Mishra tosses one up a little 
more and prompts a slightly uncertain leg glance from Moeen that’s in the air 
for a fraction but brings him a single. Stokes then rounds off the over with a 
firm drive down the ground on the half-volley for four.

68th over: England 181-4 (Moeen 41, Stokes 18) Stokes plays Jadeja with 
defensive respect for four balls before having a go off his fifth, and getting 
four with a slightly mistimed on-drive.

67th over: England 177-4 (Moeen 41, Stokes 14) Mishra has a big, energetic 
shout for lbw after spinning one in to Moeen’s pads from around the wicket but 
the trajectory is taking it down the legside. He’ll be encouraged by the manner 
in which he beat Moeen there though. He also indulges in a less throaty appeal 
off the last ball which Moeen sweeps at and misses but it’s outside the line. 
It’s Mishra’s best over thus far though.

66th over: England 177-4 (Moeen 41, Stokes 14) A change at the other end, with 
tormentor-in-chief Ashwin replaced by tormentor-in-chief Jadeja. Moeen plays 
out four balls well enough before driving nicely for three on the offside.

Domestic pet-fight! “May I introduce Willow, my cat, to Dakkers, as the feline 
equivalent of the Carrom ball,” snarls Chris Drew. “Let’s see how long Dakkers 
concentrates on the object in question now.”

65th over: England 174-4 (Moeen 38, Stokes 14) Mishra continues, with fielders 
close in on either side of the wicket. He gets some bounce and turn, but Moeen 
counterattacks well with a firm on-drive in the air that drops safely and runs 
for four. He adds a single before Stokes does likewise. Another neatly timed 
on-drive brings Moeen another one.

They’re on their way back out. England will have to concentrate hard for the 
next two hours, in the manner of Kimberley Thonger’s dog. Kimberley writes: 
“Dakkers, my dachshund puppy, just told me he’s willing to run a course on 
concentration for the England batsmen. It will basically consist of them 
learning to mimic his mindset when he’s yearning for a tasty morsel which is 
unavailable to him. He never once takes his eye off the object in question, and 
can outstare any human. The object and the human represent the ball and the 
bowler, obviously. His charge for this service is a kilo of best fillet steak.” 
Mmmmm.

Tea: England 167-4

64th over: England 167-4 (Moeen 32, Stokes 13) Moeen sweeps assertively but 
uppishly at Ashwin. “Catch it,” yells the bowler, but it’s past Yadav at square 
leg and goes for four. He gets four more with a pleasing cover drive that 
Mishra fails to cut off by the ropes. “Surely we need no more hand wringing 
over the quality of Moeen’s bowling,” writes Stuart Hetherington with timing 
worthy of his subject. “His batting alone must ensure him a place in the test 
team.” And that’s tea. This pair have done well to keep India at bay for the 
past 40 minutes or so, but victory is still eminently within India’s grasp. See 
you in a bit.

63rd over: England 158-4 (Moeen 23, Stokes 13) Tea looms, and so does Mishra, 
by some distance the third spinner in this India lineup, who comes on for a 
twirl in place of Yadav. He’s round the wicket at Moeen, who sweeps into the 
shin of Pujara at leg slip, and then appeals in vain for a bat-pad catch at 
forward short leg, but there was no edge. Vijay then cops a nasty one on the 
wrist at forward short leg from another sweep, but gamely carries on. Moeen 
adds a single before Stokes defends himself with a goalline clearance with his 
left boot against a ball that was trickling towards the stumps.

62nd over: England 157-4 (Moeen 22, Stokes 13) Ashwin goes over the wicket at 
Stokes, having been all over him coming from round the wicket, and it does 
tempt Stokes to have a go, which he does, smacking him firmly to the long-on 
boundary for four. “Re Timwig’s tweet – call me a pedant,” writes confirmed 
pedant Ian Sargeant, “but hasn’t Vaughan’s record stood for 13 calendar years 
already (with 14 just around the corner?”

61st over: England 153-4 (Moeen 22, Stokes 9) Some runs. Moeen adds a single 
off Umesh with a controlled legside pull, and then Stokes gets away with one – 
an edge that zips past Kohli at slip and goes for four. A leg-bye follows 
before Moeen treats us to a rare and genuine fine attacking shot, a lovely 
square cover drive for four. Nasser Hussain in the commentary box tries to 
pierce the English gloom by pointing out that four of their players have scored 
1,000 runs this year before asserting that the team performances haven’t been 
remotely good enough.

60th over: England 143-4 (Moeen 17, Stokes 5) Ashwin sends his carom ball in 
at Moeen but the batsman picks it well and plays it late. The spinner asks all 
sorts of questions again but Moeen answers them adeptly on this occasion, and 
finally manages some strike rotation off the last ball of the over with a firm 
drive to mid-off for one run.

59th over: England 142-4 (Moeen 16, Stokes 5) Yadav has Moeen wafting and 
missing outside off-stump, like he David Gower or something, but Moeen pulls 
the next one confidently across the line for a single. One from the over.

Richard Morris from the Twitters asks: “Root and Bairstow going cheaply - did 
they both miss the chance to become England’s top run scorer in a calendar 
year?” Talking of which…

Given reduction in future Test schedule, Michael Vaughan's record 1481 runs in 
2002 might remain an unbroken record for a calendar year

58th over: England 141-4 (Moeen 15, Stokes 5) Another big appeal from Ashwin, 
as Stokes pushes and misses at one that turns and bounces past his edge, but 
Kohli declines to back him up on this occasion. It’s a maiden, and a good one. 
This is great bowling to watch, at both ends, regardless of one’s allegiances.

57th over: England 141-4 (Moeen 15, Stokes 5) A pace-for-pace replacement, 
with Umesh Yadav on for Ishant Sharma, and the torment continues. He’s able to 
conduct some challenging chin music too, though, and has Stokes jabbing 
uncertainly at a snorter outside off-stump. Stokes adds a single before another 
shorter one prompts an uncertain hook from Moeen that could have landed in any 
of the deep legside fielders posted there for the purpose but bounces short of 
them. They run one. Stokes adds another one on the offside but it’s a very good 
over. And another reminder that England’s seamers have been comprehensively,

56th over: England 138-4 (Moeen 14, Stokes 3) Ashwin goes round the wicket at 
Stokes, all the better to torment him outside off-stump, though Stokes gets off 
the mark with a leisurely clip to the deep midwicket boundary and it’s fielded 
in an old-fashioned foot-out way by Mishra on the ropes. They run three. Moeen 
then slices uncertainly towards Nair at extra-cover but it bounces in front of 
the fielder – predictably encouraging signs for the bowler though.

55th over: England 135-4 (Moeen 14, Stokes 0) Ishant mixes it up to the extent 
that he sends a wide slower one down the offside that completely foxes Patel 
behind the stumps. The keeper fumbles and lets it run through his hands, 
conceding four byes. Ishant continues to find bounce from this shirtfront of a 
surface, though, ensuring that England can enjoy no respite when the ball’s not 
in the hands of Ashwin or Jadeja.

“England have invented a new painless surgery of removing brain from alive 
person’s head,” writes Mahendra Killedar. “And it’s not fluke mind, they 
performed it on 11 of them in Chennai!!”

54th over: England 131-4 (Moeen 14, Stokes 0) Ashwin returns to the attack, 
just to give England the fear that little bit more, and has a big shout for lbw 
with his fifth ball against Stokes, though they decline assistance from their 
new best friend, DRS, which is just as well as it got a thick inside-edge. 
India don’t have an away Test outside Asia until they visit South Africa in 
early 2018, which is going to prompt curmudgeons to mutter “can they do it on a 
wet Wednesday in Stoke?” type sentiments (though you might as well apply the 
point with more force to England’s equivalent tests, which is basically 
anywhere where the ball turns a lot). Nonetheless, it’ll be fascinating to 
watch this side in ‘unfamiliar’ conditions, as they look the most ruthless, 
efficient and intelligent India team for some time.

53rd over: England 130-4 (Moeen 12, Stokes 0) Sharma signals his intentions by 
bringing a short leg in for Bairstow. And thenstrikes by firing the subsequent 
ball in low down the legside but Bairstow gets a leading edge and dollies it up 
for Jadeja to run back well and take the catch just beyond midwicket. They’ve 
changed ends so Moeen faces the next ball, which he cracks away square on the 
offside for one.

Wicket! Bairstow c Jadeja b Sharma 1, England 129-4

Scrap what I said about Bairstow being sensible. Bairstow clips a leading edge 
high towards the legside boundary but it’s not got any sort of distance on it 
and Jadeja does brilliantly to run back and take it.

52nd over: England 129-3 (Moeen 12, Bairstow 1) Jadeja, who now has 22 wickets 
for the series, continues with an oppressive close legside field at Moeen, who 
sweeps confidently for a single nonetheless. Bairstow then gets off the mark

So, a year that began for England with Ben Stokes flaying South Africa’s 
bowlers all over the park in one of the most astonishing batting assaults of 
our times, on a shirtfront, ends with England being on the receiving end of 
something comparable, from Nair yesterday, also on a shirtfront. The difference 
is that England only drew in Cape Town, whereas they were battered by an 
innings here. This might be interpreted as symbolic of serious and alarming 
decline, though over-reaction would not be wise, not least because India were 
so very good, ruthlessly transformed from the shambles they were in England in 
2014. England are a better side than they were two or three years ago, but 
they’ve clearly stagnated in recent months (and Cook has just admitted as much 
talking to Sky), confused at times in approach and selection, still befuddled 
by the best spinners, and looking tired of mind and body. There’ll be much 
speculation about Alastair Cook’s future now in the days/weeks/maybe months to 
come. “It’s not the place for this kind of discussion,” the captain tells Sky, 
“I need to go away and think about things.”

He and his team will need a good Christmas break, and we hope you have one 
too, after a rollercoaster year of Test cricket. Thanks for all your emails, 
tweets, pedantry and humour. Season’s greetings all. Bye.
 
Kohli is up now. “It’s evidence of the character that we possess through the 
side,” he says of the second consecutive innings win. “We wanted the youngsters 
to step up, someone like KL and Karun, two not so good Test matches and then 
they step up here. It’s always tricky when you score 477 then concede a deficit 
of 281.” He praises his team’s intensity and the bowlers for hitting the right 
areas. “We’ve worked hard day-in day-out, there’s a lot of mutual respect and 
good friendship, and that’s evident on the field. No one’s playing selfish 
cricket.” This has indeed been a feature of India’s play in this series. And he 
signs off by praising India’s quick bowlers for their pace and their potency.
 
“No excuses,” says Cook. “India were the better team and deserved to win. It 
was a very good fifth-day wicket, it turned out of the rough, but we got 
ourselves in a good position and didn’t see it out. It’s a game of missed 
opportunities, we keep dropping vital chances and India kept punishing us. It’s 
very tough playing five Tests in six weeks, but no excuses” he admits. And he 
looks tired.
 
Man of the series: Even less of a surprise that it’s Virat Kohli, averaging 
more than 100 in the series. And now here comes Alastair Cook …
 
Man of the match award goes to Karun Nair – no surprise there. “It’ll take a 
couple of days to sink in,” he says, shyly. “Hats off to the team for playing 
so well. I’ve been learning each day through the series and trying to make my 
game better.” It looks in pretty handy nick as it is.

Two ways of looking at it, from you the public. Here’s Tom Sloan harrumphing: 
“What a gutless showing from England! Some of the modes of dismissal were 
nothing short of a disgrace. Total embarrassment.” And Robert Taylor with some 
mitigation: “I confess I haven’t been able to watch much of this test (presents 
and work - to pay for the presents - taking priority this week) so please 
educate me if I’m wrong but I do find the attacks on Cook slightly unfair. We 
have lost this series because the Indian spin bowlers have out-bowled ours... 
is that his fault? Would Root as captain have returned significantly better 
from them than 113 overs, 6 maidens, 4 for 472 in this test? Is it Cook’s fault 
that Anderson (our best seam bowler in India last time around) has been injured 
or short on match practice?”
 
The post-match interviews begin with Ashwin and Jadeja revelling in the 
moment, praising each other generously and honouring the magnitude of the 
achievement. There’s a case for Jadeja to be MOTM here.

After win in SA, England went 5th in the rankings. Will end 2016 there too. 
Despite flirtation with top, it's been Test stagnation at best
 <https://twitter.com/Cricket_Ali/status/811157525282230272> December 20, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/Cricket_Ali/status/811157525282230272>  
The India players are now treating a thrilled crowd to a lap of honour. What a 
happy, well-grooved set of cricketers they now look – they haven’t really 
exhibited any weaknesses in their team all series (except, perhaps, behind the 
stumps). You could even conceivably pick an all-India XI from a combined team 
this time. England just haven’t been able to cope in the end, though we may 
remember that after the first Test the mood was upbeat after a very 
accomplished performance in Rajkot. That was, by a massive distance, as good as 
it was going to get.
 
88th over: England 207 (Buttler 6 not out) Game over. And it’s a seven-wicket 
haul for Jadeja, who starts the over by finding Broad’s outside edge with a 
tantalising turner but it’s along the ground. He doesn’t have to wait long, 
though,to strike – the next ball spits in at the left-hander and is nudged up 
and round the corner to leg-slip. The umpire takes his time to raise the finger 
but Broad – not a natural walker – knows it’s not worth reviewing and trudges 
off. They’re all round the bat for Ball, who’s beaten all ends up by a 
brilliant leg-break first ball andthen dismissed, with a simple edge to Kohli, 
who, appropriately wraps up the series with the catch. Another England 
collapse, another emphatic victory for this imperious India side.

 
Broad edges at one that kicks in at him out of the rough and is taken at leg 
slip. Nearly done.
 
87th over: England 207-8 (Buttler 6, Broad 1) Slightly surprising bowling 
change now, with Mishra replacing Yadav, but he manages to draw a loose shot 
from Buttler – a nudge and miss outside leg-stump – but the batsman is 
otherwise orthodox and defensive in a maiden.

More crazy, unworkable Bolshevik talk, from Matthew Brown: “Regarding Robert 
Spittlehouse’s approach to avoiding the curse of captaincy by avoiding 
captaincy: we could always do something even more radical, and pick a bowler as 
captain. I know, people will just laugh at that one.”
 
86th over: England 207-8 (Buttler 6, Broad 1) Jadeja replaces Ashwin and keeps 
Broad on the defensive (he can’t really do anything else here), inducing one 
play and miss in another maiden.
 
85th over: England 207-8 (Buttler 6, Broad 1) Broad thinks he’s got off the 
mark against Yadav with a single off his hips down to fine leg but umpire 
Erasmus rules that he played no shot so sends him back to face more attempted 
legside entrapment, and is almost snared fending one down to fine leg on the up 
but it eludes fielders – Broad does get his first run this time though. Buttler 
is then prevented from farming the strike by ba couple of rasping shorter 
balls. You’ve got to feel for Jadeja and Rahul – eight wickets (at least) and a 
score of 199 respectively yet they’ve surely got no chance whatsoever of the 
man of the match award.

We have 12 overs/49 minutes remaining.
 
84th over: England 206-8 (Buttler 6, Broad 0) Ashwin attacks at Buttler, who 
mostly plays late and wisely but looks less certain when he attempts to get 
forward at one that gets caught between bat and boot. He can’t keep the strike 
this time though. A maiden.
 
83rd over: England 206-8 (Buttler 6, Broad 0) Yadav mixes it up a bit, finding 
as much bounce with new ball as he did with old. Buttler clips a single to 
midwicket off the fifth ball, cognisant that he’ll probably have to take most 
of the strike from hereon in. With that in mind, he turns down a suggested 
single from Broad after a tentative nudge off the left-hander’s hips.

This collapse all began with Moeen, of course, about whom Jonathan Gresty 
offered this statistical curio a few overs ago: “Having scored exactly the same 
number of runs in this test as his bowling went for, Moeen being dismissed for 
44 didn’t surprise me. Now we just need Rashid to score the same number of runs 
as he went for and we might just survive....”
 
82nd over: England 205-8 (Buttler 5, Broad 0) Ashwin enjoys a bowl with the 
new ball, getting some nice swing from it with his arm ball, but also conceding 
four byes with one that drifts down the legside. Buttler dabs a shorter ball 
away on the legside for a single before Ashwin turns one sharply away from 
Broad as part of an lbw set-up: the next ball is duly straighter and hits him 
on the pads, prompting a cheeky review. It’s missing off, however, but it won’t 
fill England with any confidence that they can somehow survive the next hour. 
And that’s drinks.
 
81st over: England 200-8 (Buttler 4, Broad 0) There’s no way back for England 
now.Kohli decides he will take the new ball, despite the dominance of the 
spinners in recent overs, bringing Yadav back in place of Mishra.And it works! 
Buttler adds a single before Rashid dollies up a simple catch with a leading 
edge.

“Re Robert Spittlehouse’s suggestion of replacing captains with democratic 
voting,” writes Jen Oram in an email entitled “Corbyn cricket”, “isn’t that how 
Admiral Collingwood ran his ship, asking everyone’s opinion before doing 
anything? It sort of worked okay but he got through about 30 overs a day, which 
is slow even by Cook’s standards.” Revolution is a slow, ponderous, dull 
business. And then it collapses in a heap of mutual denunciation. Which might, 
still, arguably be more fun from an English perspective than all this.
 
Kohli gambles on taking the new ball, and wins. Rashid miscues an attempted 
flick to leg and it’s caught in the covers by Jadeja
 
80th over: England 199-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 2) That wicketless lightweight 
Ashwin replaces Jadeja, with four close fielders in around the bat, and has 
Rashid in trouble with one that raps pad but is missing and another that jags 
out of the rough in at Rashid’s glove but doesn’t quite carry. Terrific over.

We’re throwing the kitchen sink around now on the selection question: “What 
England should have done is just select 11 batsmen and then tried to score 7, 8 
or 900 in the first innings,” writes Peter Salmon. “I’m not sure having no 
bowlers (except Stoles and, I guess, Mooen) would have made much difference to 
the Indian score, and they could have secured a draw. Perhaps next time.”
 
79th over: England 199-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 2) Mishra continues, as well he 
might as he’s bowled very well since tea, but Rashid reads him well, flicking 
another single square on the legside in an otherwise defensive over.
 
78th over: England 198-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 1) Rashid gets off the mark then 
Buttler sees out the over. He wants to get forward to negate the spin but has 
no option but to be defensive. This could be quite the test of his red-ball 
credentials. “Just woken up,” claims Matt Emerson “haven’t checked the score 
yet - what sort of total do you think we need to set India to get them 
nervous...” About 400 should do it Matt. Could be done.
 
77th over: England 197-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 0) Mishra bowls. England defend. A 
maiden. “All the hallmarks of the second Bangladesh Test; big opening 
partnership then a brainless collapse,” tuts Kevin Wilson. “I know they’re all 
mentally exhausted and probably can’t wait to fly home but that’s not much of 
an excuse.” There is a germ of an excuse though. Seven Tests in two months, 
with practically no warm-up time, is the most exhausting schedule I can ever 
remember. And now there are no Tests for more than six months.
 
76th over: England 197-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 0) Jadeja seeks to turn the screw, 
rattling through another over with the concession of only a single to Buttler. 
Only four overs to the new ball – will they take it?
 
75th over: England 196-7 (Buttler 3, Rashid 0) India are rampant. Buttler 
nudges Mishra round the corner to get off the mark with a single. Then Mishra
accounts for Dawson, with a googly that’s tossed up in the perfect area and the 
No8 has no answer to it. Bowled neck and crop.

What we need in these rudderless confusing times is some anarcho-syndicalism, 
a rejection of the Cult of the Leader. Here’s Robert Spittlehouse: “In response 
to Andrew Porter’s fears (68th over) about the spread of the England Captain’s 
Batting Curse to even notional or pre-elective captains, we should consider and 
disseminate rival concepts to contain the outbreak. In this spirit, isn’t it 
time to abandon the role of captain all together? The team could become an 
autonomous collective, with simple fielding changes and appeals ratified by a 
simple majority, whereas a two-thirds majority would be required for bowling 
rotations and batting order alterations. Problem solved.”
 
Mishra comes to the party. His googly foxes Dawson, who is bowled through the 
gate for a duck.
 
74th over: England 193-6 (Buttler 0, Dawson 0) It’s going to be 4-0. It’s in 
the bag. Stokes is confounded by a ball from Jadeja that just sticks on him, 
forcing him to mistime a chip to mid-on where Nairtakes an easy catch. Can 
Dawson be the batting hero again on debut? He’s tormented early on when Jadeja 
finds a low edge with some sharp turn but it doesn’t carry to Kohli at slip. 
Let’s change the subject – sort of. Here’s Lee Smith: “Could you please ask 
Will West what kind of dubious Darwinian or Frankenstein chicanery is taking 
place at Chez West in light of the revelation that his hamster has HANDS! Is he 
really Sid from Toy Story?”
 
And another! It’s five for Jadeja– a leading edge from Stokes loops up to Nair 
at mid-on for the easiest of catches.
 
73rd over: England 193-5 (Stokes 23, Buttler 0) It’s slightly surprising that 
Kohli keeps Mishra on here, given the chance to really turn the screw, but the 
third spinner’s got his tail up too and Stokes isn’t looking completely 
comfortable against him. He does nudge a single away in front of square on the 
legside though. Buttler plays out the over. England’s two most attacking 
batsmen have a right old rearguard action to pull off here.
 
72nd over: England 192-5 (Stokes 22, Buttler 0) Is this the decisive moment? 
Moeen goes, trying to hit Jadeja over the top, not connecting properly and 
Ashwin takes a smart catch above his head. Why oh why? There’s nearly another 
wicket, as a bat-pad chance off new man Buttler isn’t quite taken at short leg.
 
Oh no Mo! Moeen is tempted to hit Jadeja over the top, doesn’t get hold of it 
properly and it’s taken above his head by Ashwin at mid-on.
 
71st over: England 192-4 (Moeen 44, Stokes 22) Mishra continues to rattle 
through his overs, conceding a Moeen flicked single only from this one. 
Meanwhile, here’s the latest episode of My OBO Family and other Animals: 
“Kimberley Thonger.. Brilliant name, brilliant post,” gauntlet-throws Will 
West. “But taking the field with Chris Drew and his cat will be our Syrian 
hamster Buttercup who, through hanging repeatedly from the roof of her cage 
one- handed has developed a grip and agility to match Jonty Rhodes in his pomp. 
Catches win matches!”
 
70th over: England 191-4 (Moeen 43, Stokes 22) Chance! Jadeja drifts one into 
Moeen, it brushes bat and pad but the man at short leg is slow to react and 
only parries it onto the ground. Unfazed, Moeen sweeps confidently past the 
same fielder for one. Plenty of variety from Jadeja though, and Stokes swings 
and misses at one that he misreads. Patel misread it too though – it’s four 
byes. Patel might be a sparky batsman but he’s not the complete keeper by any 
means.
 
69th over: England 186-4 (Moeen 42, Stokes 22) Mishra tosses one up a little 
more and prompts a slightly uncertain leg glance from Moeen that’s in the air 
for a fraction but brings him a single. Stokes then rounds off the over with a 
firm drive down the ground on the half-volley for four.
 
68th over: England 181-4 (Moeen 41, Stokes 18) Stokes plays Jadeja with 
defensive respect for four balls before having a go off his fifth, and getting 
four with a slightly mistimed on-drive.

The boundless superstitiousness of the English cricket fan, part 94:
Andrew Porter (@Retropz) 
@tomdaviesE17 <https://twitter.com/tomdaviesE17> Is it just me, or has merely 
the suggestion of the captaincy already cursed Root's batting? Or am I just 
pessimistic?
 <https://twitter.com/Retropz/status/811136511685050369> December 20, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/Retropz/status/811136511685050369>  
67th over: England 177-4 (Moeen 41, Stokes 14) Mishra has a big, energetic 
shout for lbw after spinning one in to Moeen’s pads from around the wicket but 
the trajectory is taking it down the legside. He’ll be encouraged by the manner 
in which he beat Moeen there though. He also indulges in a less throaty appeal 
off the last ball which Moeen sweeps at and misses but it’s outside the line. 
It’s Mishra’s best over thus far though.
 
66th over: England 177-4 (Moeen 41, Stokes 14) A change at the other end, with 
tormentor-in-chief Ashwin replaced by tormentor-in-chief Jadeja. Moeen plays 
out four balls well enough before driving nicely for three on the offside.

Domestic pet-fight! “May I introduce Willow, my cat, to Dakkers, as the feline 
equivalent of the Carrom ball,” snarls Chris Drew. “Let’s see how long Dakkers 
concentrates on the object in question now.”
 
65th over: England 174-4 (Moeen 38, Stokes 14) Mishra continues, with fielders 
close in on either side of the wicket. He gets some bounce and turn, but Moeen 
counterattacks well with a firm on-drive in the air that drops safely and runs 
for four. He adds a single before Stokes does likewise. Another neatly timed 
on-drive brings Moeen another one.
 
They’re on their way back out. England will have to concentrate hard for the 
next two hours, in the manner of Kimberley Thonger’s dog. Kimberley writes: 
“Dakkers, my dachshund puppy, just told me he’s willing to run a course on 
concentration for the England batsmen. It will basically consist of them 
learning to mimic his mindset when he’s yearning for a tasty morsel which is 
unavailable to him. He never once takes his eye off the object in question, and 
can outstare any human. The object and the human represent the ball and the 
bowler, obviously. His charge for this service is a kilo of best fillet steak.” 
Mmmmm.
 
64th over: England 167-4 (Moeen 32, Stokes 13) Moeen sweeps assertively but 
uppishly at Ashwin. “Catch it,” yells the bowler, but it’s past Yadav at square 
leg and goes for four. He gets four more with a pleasing cover drive that 
Mishra fails to cut off by the ropes. “Surely we need no more hand wringing 
over the quality of Moeen’s bowling,” writes Stuart Hetherington with timing 
worthy of his subject. “His batting alone must ensure him a place in the test 
team.” And that’s tea. This pair have done well to keep India at bay for the 
past 40 minutes or so, but victory is still eminently within India’s grasp. See 
you in a bit.

63rd over: England 158-4 (Moeen 23, Stokes 13) Tea looms, and so does Mishra, 
by some distance the third spinner in this India lineup, who comes on for a 
twirl in place of Yadav. He’s round the wicket at Moeen, who sweeps into the 
shin of Pujara at leg slip, and then appeals in vain for a bat-pad catch at 
forward short leg, but there was no edge. Vijay then cops a nasty one on the 
wrist at forward short leg from another sweep, but gamely carries on. Moeen 
adds a single before Stokes defends himself with a goalline clearance with his 
left boot against a ball that was trickling towards the stumps.
 
62nd over: England 157-4 (Moeen 22, Stokes 13) Ashwin goes over the wicket at 
Stokes, having been all over him coming from round the wicket, and it does 
tempt Stokes to have a go, which he does, smacking him firmly to the long-on 
boundary for four. “Re Timwig’s tweet – call me a pedant,” writes confirmed 
pedant Ian Sargeant, “but hasn’t Vaughan’s record stood for 13 calendar years 
already (with 14 just around the corner?”
 
61st over: England 153-4 (Moeen 22, Stokes 9) Some runs. Moeen adds a single 
off Umesh with a controlled legside pull, and then Stokes gets away with one – 
an edge that zips past Kohli at slip and goes for four. A leg-bye follows 
before Moeen treats us to a rare and genuine fine attacking shot, a lovely 
square cover drive for four. Nasser Hussain in the commentary box tries to 
pierce the English gloom by pointing out that four of their players have scored 
1,000 runs this year before asserting that the team performances haven’t been 
remotely good enough.

60th over: England 143-4 (Moeen 17, Stokes 5) Ashwin sends his carom ball in 
at Moeen but the batsman picks it well and plays it late. The spinner asks all 
sorts of questions again but Moeen answers them adeptly on this occasion, and 
finally manages some strike rotation off the last ball of the over with a firm 
drive to mid-off for one run.
 
59th over: England 142-4 (Moeen 16, Stokes 5) Yadav has Moeen wafting and 
missing outside off-stump, like he David Gower or something, but Moeen pulls 
the next one confidently across the line for a single. One from the over.

58th over: England 141-4 (Moeen 15, Stokes 5) Another big appeal from Ashwin, 
as Stokes pushes and misses at one that turns and bounces past his edge, but 
Kohli declines to back him up on this occasion. It’s a maiden, and a good one. 
This is great bowling to watch, at both ends, regardless of one’s allegiances.
 
57th over: England 141-4 (Moeen 15, Stokes 5) A pace-for-pace replacement, 
with Umesh Yadav on for Ishant Sharma, and the torment continues. He’s able to 
conduct some challenging chin music too, though, and has Stokes jabbing 
uncertainly at a snorter outside off-stump. Stokes adds a single before another 
shorter one prompts an uncertain hook from Moeen that could have landed in any 
of the deep legside fielders posted there for the purpose but bounces short of 
them. They run one. Stokes adds another one on the offside but it’s a very good 
over. And another reminder that England’s seamers have been comprehensively, 
emphatically bested by India’s pacemen in this series too.
 
56th over: England 138-4 (Moeen 14, Stokes 3) Ashwin goes round the wicket at 
Stokes, all the better to torment him outside off-stump, though Stokes gets off 
the mark with a leisurely clip to the deep midwicket boundary and it’s fielded 
in an old-fashioned foot-out way by Mishra on the ropes. They run three. Moeen 
then slices uncertainly towards Nair at extra-cover but it bounces in front of 
the fielder – predictably encouraging signs for the bowler though.
 
55th over: England 135-4 (Moeen 14, Stokes 0) Ishant mixes it up to the extent 
that he sends a wide slower one down the offside that completely foxes Patel 
behind the stumps. The keeper fumbles and lets it run through his hands, 
conceding four byes. Ishant continues to find bounce from this shirtfront of a 
surface, though, ensuring that England can enjoy no respite when the ball’s not 
in the hands of Ashwin or Jadeja.

“England have invented a new painless surgery of removing brain from alive 
person’s head,” writes Mahendra Killedar. “And it’s not fluke mind, they 
performed it on 11 of them in Chennai!!”

 
54th over: England 131-4 (Moeen 14, Stokes 0) Ashwin returns to the attack, 
just to give England the fear that little bit more, and has a big shout for lbw 
with his fifth ball against Stokes, though they decline assistance from their 
new best friend, DRS, which is just as well as it got a thick inside-edge. 
India don’t have an away Test outside Asia until they visit South Africa in 
early 2018, which is going to prompt curmudgeons to mutter “can they do it on a 
wet Wednesday in Stoke?” type sentiments (though you might as well apply the 
point with more force to England’s equivalent tests, which is basically 
anywhere where the ball turns a lot). Nonetheless, it’ll be fascinating to 
watch this side in ‘unfamiliar’ conditions, as they look the most ruthless, 
efficient and intelligent India team for some time.
 
53rd over: England 130-4 (Moeen 12, Stokes 0) Sharma signals his intentions by 
bringing a short leg in for Bairstow. And thenstrikes by firing the subsequent 
ball in low down the legside but Bairstow gets a leading edge and dollies it up 
for Jadeja to run back well and take the catch just beyond midwicket. They’ve 
changed ends so Moeen faces the next ball, which he cracks away square on the 
offside for one.

Scrap what I said about Bairstow being sensible. Bairstow clips a leading edge 
high towards the legside boundary but it’s not got any sort of distance on it 
and Jadeja does brilliantly to run back and take it.
 
52nd over: England 129-3 (Moeen 12, Bairstow 1) Jadeja, who now has 22 wickets 
for the series, continues with an oppressive close legside field at Moeen, who 
sweeps confidently for a single nonetheless. Bairstow then gets off the mark 
with a sensible back-foot push to mid-on.
