Winning tip: Boxing Day pilgrimage, North Yorkshire


Blow away the Christmas cobwebs on a picturesque revitalising morning walk in 
the footsteps of 13 monks, who in 1132 walked from Ripon to set up a new 
community by the river Skell. Follow their ancient path toFountains Abbey and 
the Georgian Water Garden 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/fountains-abbey-and-studley-royal-water-garden>
, ending with a carol service and prayers.

London is great to visit on Boxing Day because you can take advantage of the 
reduced traffic and crowds to get around easily and visit more places. Try 
renting a tandem or bike at Gabriel’s Wharf on the South Bank (London Bicycle 
Tour Company <http://www.londonbicycle.com/>) from just £7 for two hours (£20 a 
day) or sign up to the city hire scheme atSantander Cycles 
<https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles> and make trips from £2. No 
need to book, just touch in and away you go.

The great British countryside remains resolutely open over Christmas and the 
National Trust’s 700 miles of coastal walks are bracing and refreshing. The 
two-mile hike alongArnside Knott 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/arnside-and-silverdale> on the 
Lancashire/Cumbria border affords stunning views over Morecambe Bay, while the 
four-and-a-half-mile trek on theWhite Cliffs of Dover 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/the-white-cliffs-of-dover/features/white-cliffs-in-winter>
 guarantees great views and revitalising airs.

The National Lido of Wales <http://www2.rctcbc.gov.uk/en/lido/home.aspx> in 
Pontypridd recently reopened and this year all three outdoor pools will be 
heated to a temperature of 30C on Boxing Day to entice swimmers into the water. 
At £4 for the morning (8am to 12.30pm) it’s a great, original way to burn up 
some Christmas calories and check out the facilities for warmer months.

After a day of being stuck indoors with too much food, and EastEnders, why not 
take a trip back in time on the steam engines of theSevern Valley Railway 
<http://www.svr.co.uk/>? Being in the Midlands it is accessible from many parts 
of the country within a couple of hours. The railway runs special services from 
Boxing Day onwards just for the holiday week. At Bridgnorth you can start 
walking off Christmas with a walk along the river Severn. Or take the Victorian 
Cliff Railway funicular for views over the town and river. Bewdley is similarly 
picturesque but with no funicular, so here you can put off walking no more. 
Then return on the hour-long journey back in time. I’d recommend starting and 
ending in Bewdley or Bridgnorth because Kidderminster can be a bit of a traffic 
nightmare.
• Return from Kidderminster to Bridgnorth adult £19, child £3, family £50 (2 
adults, 4 child),svr.co.uk <http://www.svr.co.uk/CalendarTimetable.aspx>
