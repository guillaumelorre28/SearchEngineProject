trans woman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/06/oakland-fire-ghost-ship-transgender-victims-them-are-us-too>
.

“She was feeling at home,” said her father, Jack Bohlka, adding, “Em was the 
most caring, kind, generous person I’ve ever met in my life.”

She was considering moving to New York City and becoming a teacher and wrote 
poetry that was free verse and often very personal, Bohlka said. “She and I had 
a real passion for social justice issues and literature ... She was always a 
champion for people who were on the margins.”

Bohlka said he plans to establish a fund at a local LGBT center “in memory of 
Em, so that more transgender people will be able to become who they truly are, 
and so that there will be more safe spaces available”.

generous, joyful man whose creativity spilled out into every part of his life. 
Rena Davis, a friend since they were teenagers, wrote on Facebook that 
Bernbaum’s art brought “joy and smiles to people who needed exactly that”.

After years of mutual animosity in high school, she wrote, their friendship

in years to come, how many more enemies will have become friends.”

“He was profound at age 18,” Davis wrote. “He only got better.”

A 2015 graduate of the University of California 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california>, Berkeley, with degrees in 
cognitive science and computer science, Cline lived in Oakland and was a 
musician and athlete growing up.

His former music teacher of 10 years, Amanda Walker, wrote on Facebook that he 
played clarinet for the all-state band and was a volleyball player for his high 
school team near Santa Monica. A friend, Kara O’Connor, wrote in her own post 
that he “was one of the absolute brightest people I’ve ever had the great 
fortune of knowing”.

Mateo Garcia, a friend of Cline’s since elementary school, told the Guardian 
he was “always the classmate or team-mate that lit up the room”.

“He was always able to snap you out of a funk by just saying something or 
doing something goofy.”

Micah Danemayer, 28

Danemayer was known for bringing people together in the music scene and giving 
new musicians opportunities, said a friend, Nihar Bhatt, a DJ and record label 
owner who was outside the fire on Friday night.

“He was always down to book the first show for artists. For many people, he 
just gave them their first platform,” he said, noting that Danemayer had booked 
his first solo show. “In my case, he talked me into it.”

Friends said Danemayer was always humble and didn’t get enough credit for how 
pivotal he was in organizing events and supporting artists.

“Micah was very selfless in providing a platform for others to come and 
showcase their music,” said Tiare Ribeaux, a local curator. “He got very little 
recognition, got no money out of it, but he just kept doing it.”

according to friends and family. Jeremy Bispo, who produced shows with Igaz 
around the Bay Area,told the Chronicle 
<http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Johnny-Igaz-mentor-who-was-all-about-10780553.php>
: “Not only was music a passion, people were a passion. He was all about 
community. All about building a safe space for people to be themselves.”

Igaz grew up locally in the city of Alameda and went to an arts high school in 
San Francisco, the paper reported.

His brother, Paul Igaz, wrote in a Facebook tribute, “He shaped me in many 
areas of life beyond music, but it was in particular his ability to transmit to 
me his love of music – and through music, an appreciation of a culture of 
diversity – that ensures that his soul will live within my soul, and the soul 
of all who know him or his music, eternally.”

Nick Gomez-Hall, 25

Gomez-Hall, from Coronado in southern California, worked at Counterpoint Press 
<http://www.counterpointpress.com/>, a publisher in Berkeley. The company wrote 
on Facebook: “Whether he was recommending new music to listen to (and it was 
always so good), regaling us with tales of the bowling alley, offering his 
beloved truck for a ride if anyone needed it, or sharing his much appreciated 
opinions about a book jacket or manuscript, he made everyone feel like they 
were his friend. He was kind, considerate, hilarious.”

Gomez-Hall studied at Brown University, where community members were mourning 
on Monday and sharing memories of his music. Alocal newspaper 
<https://www.facebook.com/collegehillindependent/?hc_ref=SEARCH&fref=nf> shared 
anarticle he wrote <http://www.theindy.org/a/78> and noted that his band 
Nightmom “served as a kind of way into the Providence music scene a few years 
ago, and we are seeing the impacts of his loss all around PVD today”.

Gregory worked two part-time jobs and was also studying for a degree in 
special education at San Francisco State University, her mother, Kimberly 
Gregory, told theLos Angeles Times 
<http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-oakland-fire-victims-2016-story.html>
.

“She was just a wonderful person with a smile that lit up the room everywhere 
she went,” the mother told the paper. “There was not a harsh bone in that 
girl’s body … If anyone was arguing, she was the first one to pull you aside 
and help you two make up.”

Gregory went to the party with her boyfriend, Alex Vega, who also died in the 
fire.

Sara Hoda, 30


Hoda worked as a teacher at a Montessori school in the Bay Area, and with a 
friend, Carol Crewdson, had helped start a collective house, called the Musick 
Box, as a temporary residence for travelling artists. “She was a principled 
person,” Crewdson wrote on Facebook. “She was compassionate, decent, and 
honorable. She didn’t do drugs and she wasn’t a drinker.”

“She was a teacher and a gardener,” Crewdson wrote. “She loved children and 
earth, and she put those principles in action.”

Angie Green, another friend, posted her own tribute: “I know we have not 
spoken in a while but I think of you often and will always miss you. You were 
one of the kindest and most selfless people I’ve ever met and I wish you could 
have stayed with us longer.”

Travis Hough, 35

A musician with the electronic group Ghost of Lightning, Hough was remembered 
by family and friends from his hometown, Benicia, and from the California art 
world – he was a graduate of the California College of the Arts. A friend from 
high school, Jeanne Geiger, called Hough “such a special member of our unique 
little Benicia music community”, and his friend James Morgan wrote: “Travis was 
always a model of compassion and grace. I have a profound admiration for him 
and the way he lived. He was a free spirit. He will be grievously missed.”

His friends launched a donation fund 
<https://www.gofundme.com/travis-hough-serviceexpenses-fund> for the family, 
writing that he “was a unique, warm, loving soul that this world was blessed to 
know”.

Ara Jo, 29

Jo was a beloved member of the Oakland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oakland> arts community who was known for 
helping lead numerous high-profile events and spaces. At the time of the fire, 
she was serving as an organizer for the East Bay Alternative Book and Zine Fest.

“She was a leader,” said Allegra Rush, Jo’s room-mate who also collaborated 
with her at Sgraffito, an art gallery where Jo was a co-director. “She was an 
amazing curator. She would end up hanging everything herself because she had to 
do it the right way.”

Jo was extremely generous, Rush added. “She always opened up the house and fed 
people.”

Lisa Aurora, co-founder of Naming Gallery in Oakland, said: “Ara did 
everything to connect artists with each other.”

Sarah Carlberg said Jo helped inspire many other artists: “She was a magic 
person who was unabashed in her art and creativity and brought her energy into 
the world unapologetically in a way that made the rest of us feel empowered and 
safe to do the same. She was tireless in her support of other people’s 
projects.”

“She had a really good heart,” said Jenny Yang, a friend and Oakland resident 
who is active in the local DIY art scene. “I just always felt like she was a 
very wise person in the sense of really understanding people and never showing 
negative judgement toward anyone.”

Yang said she would always see Kellogg riding her bike and that she was often 
present at local art events: “I felt like she was this magical person, kind of 
like an angel that arrived. She was always in the background smiling.”

 that Lapine “had a real understanding, just an innate feel for music and 
people”.

Lapine’s friend Amanda Stauffer also shared a tribute on Facebook, writing 
that Lapine had helped her learn how to play guitar and was a great teacher: 
“He gave me lessons, and his patience and enthusiasm for the whole project can 
only be described as saintly in the face of my unwavering lack of discipline.”

Griffin Madden, 23

Madden graduated in 2015 from the University of California, Berkeley with a 
degree in philosophy and Slavic language and literature, according to school 
officials. He also worked for Cal Performances, a university arts organization.

“He was probably the most memorable undergraduate student I’ve had in my years 
of teaching,” Luba Golburt, associate professor at UC Berkeley, told the
Chronicle 
<http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Griffin-Madden-victim-of-Oakland-warehouse-fire-10780649.php>
.

Madden’s girlfriend, Saya Tomioka, posted a tribute on Facebook 
<https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154628448161598&set=a.10150246217956598.344742.562096597&type=3>
, recounting a trip the couple took in 2015 to New York City, during which a 
random photographer took a shot of them kissing. She said she didn’t learn the 
man’s name, but that he showed them “the single beautiful snap shot that he was 
able to capture”.

After the fire, Tomioka asked friends to share her post in hopes of finding 
the image, and eventually the Facebook message reachedphotographer Arken Avan 
<https://www.facebook.com/SayaTomioka/posts/10154628453416598?comment_id=10154642719771598&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D>
, who recovered the photo and posted it on her page.

“I’ve lost you, but I’ve never felt stronger in my life,” she wrote in a 
follow-uptribute 
<https://www.facebook.com/SayaTomioka/posts/10154642812606598:1> to Madden. 
“Through our many years of love and growth, I learned how to be strong from 
you.”

Joseph Matlock, 36 

Matlock, also known as Joey Casio, was a highly respected local electronic 
musician, known for hisindustrial techno sets 
<http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/friends-remember-integral-bay-area-artists-musicians-and-sound-engineers-still-missing-after-ghost-ship-fire/Content?oid=5053356>
. He was scheduled to play at the party the night of the fire.

“He was such a mentor to so many people,” said Nihar Bhatt, a local DJ and 
record label owner who said he was planning on releasing Matlock’s vinyl 
record. Bhatt said the artist was known locally and nationally “as somebody who 
broke rules and had a very distinctive style”.

“He was just really always radical in what he did, from his fashion to his 
style of music to his politics,” Bhatt added. “He deserved a much bigger 
audience than he had, but he never was very concerned about that. He was just 
like, ‘I want to play.’”

“He was just this visionary in so many ways,” added Tiare Ribeaux, a local 
curator. “He was an amazing philosopher. He just saw the world in this light 
that was very unique. And he was an anomaly. There’s no one like him.”

 that his son was interested in illustration, design, photography, painting and 
music.

“He’s done artwork, comics, wrote and illustrated books. He’s ventured into 
sound and music – a little bit of everything.”


McCarty’s girlfriend Grace Lovio 
<http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Jason-McCarty-many-sided-artist-who-was-one-10781928.php>
 said he had worked for an audio-visual company and that he collaborated with 
multiple bands. She told theLos Angeles Times

 that he wrote poetry for her and that the last message he sent her said: “Love 
you a zilliopzazillion.”

Draven McGill, 17

McGill was the youngest victim of the fire. The 17-year-old was a student at 
the Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts and a son of a deputy for the
Alameda County sheriff’s office 
<http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-fire-victim-Draven-McGill-17-10695866.php>
, which has been handling the investigation.

McGill was a junior and a baritone in the school’s choir, the Chronicle 
reported 
<http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-fire-victim-Draven-McGill-17-10695866.php>

love and music he shared with his friends”, officialsannounced 
<https://www.facebook.com/AsawaSOTA/photos/a.272857649391449.76595.207740229236525/1349304385080098/?type=3&theater>
. Students are performing choral pieces that were favorites of McGill as well 
as a new student composition written as a tribute.

 Julian Granados, a friend from school, told the Mercury News 
<http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/06/oakland-fire-victims-draven-mcgill-17-san-francisco-art-student/>

“choir buddies”.

Jennifer Mendiola, 35

Mendiola was on track to receive a doctorate in health psychology from the 
University of California, Merced next year. She hoped to eventually become a 
professor, Ruben Castaneda, a Merced colleague, told theChronicle 
<http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Fire-victim-Jennifer-Mendiola-Doctorate-dancing-10781979.php>
.

“She was always happy, smiling, bright. She was a great academic, always 
working really hard on getting research done. She had a very clear path and 
focus on what she wanted to do.”

Last year, Mendiola co-authored a piece for the Los Angeles Times 
<http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-gonzalez-et-al-latino-vaccination-20151229-story.html>
 about the importance of flu shots for Latinos in California.

Anna Mendiola, her sister-in-law, told the Chronicle that Jennifer had a “goth 
flair”, adding, “Whenever she danced, everyone in the room would stop what they 
were doing and look at her, because she was the most beautiful thing in the 
room.”

other trans women.

“She was wild and free,” said Max Tamola, a longtime friend. “She loved her 
friends more than anything ... She is living on in all of us.”

“Her art is renowned among community,” her friends wrote in a tribute. “As her 
queer family gathers to share memories, a common narrative emerges: Feral 
saving our lives over and over again. For many of her trans community, Feral 
was a guide and sister in a world of small joys and terrible precarity for 
trans women. Feral was truly committed to empowering those that the world deems 
powerless.”

She adopted two rescue dogs shortly after her arrival in Oakland. “She was a 
synthesizer genius with impeccable musical taste,” her former partner, Eliza 
Wicks-Frank,told SFGate

“Right off the bat she would talk to anyone,” Brendan Dreaper, friend and band 
manager, told the local paper. “Especially when she took on her stage persona – 
she had a team of friends who would help her design outfits with a new style 
for every show. If I didn’t know who she was I would have thought Ben was 
playing with a different person every time.”

Jennifer Kiyomi Tanouye, 31

Tanouye was known throughout Oakland for her nail art 
<http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/painting-nails-as-art/Content?oid=4330480>
, often showing up to local parties and painting intricate nail designs on 
people, posting photos with the name “Underground Nail Bar”. She also worked as 
a manager at Shazam, the popular music app.

“I really looked up to her,” said Jenny Yang, who is active in the local DIY 
art scene. “It’s very hard to find other Asian Americans that can relate in the 
way we do in the sense of being really interested in DIY culture, really 
interested in art and music, really interested in social justice.”

As the Oakland art scene received more mainstream attention in recent years, 
Tanouye fought to ensure that longtime DIY artists were included, Yang added: 
“She was like, ‘Hey, I have this whole community of friends that have been here 
forever that are wanting finally to have a stage to perform on.’”

She was also known for her successful work organizing the Mission Creek music 
and arts festival 
<http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/rapid-growth-of-mission-creek-oakland/Content?oid=3324398>
 in Oakland.

Tanouye was the reason the festival survived, said friend Allegra Rush. “She 
could do whatever she wanted to do and it would happen.”

Peter Wadsworth, 38

A Boston native who studied psychology at Harvard University, Wadsworth lived 
at the 31st St warehouse and like many others there was a jack-of-all trades.

 that Wadsworth working on starting a company to make marijuana-infused salsa 
and created replica Egyptian artwork.

“He was a walking catalogue of correct factual knowledge,” friend Swan Vega 
told the paper. “He was like our Dumbledore – our wise wizard. He was a genius. 
He was pure intelligence.

“You could catch Pete in the hall,” she added, “and suddenly realize you have 
been engaging in the most interesting conversation you’ve had in a month, when 
you need to go to work.”

Nicholas Walrath, 31

Walrath, born in Pittsburgh and a graduate of MIT, was a newly minted 
associate at a San Francisco law firm, after stints clerking for two of 
California’s most important courts. Before switching to law studies at New York 
University, he spent a year studying for a PhD in atomic physics at the 
University of Colorado. In a statement, Judge Jon Tigar wrote that Walrath was 
an “exceptional” clerk.

“Nick brought his brilliant intellect, cogent writing skills, curiosity, and 
relentless work ethic to everything he did,” Tigar wrote. “Even more than his 
considerable legal talents, Nick also brought his sterling personality, his 
generosity, his good humor, and his love of life.”

Brandon Chase Wittenauer, 32

Wittenauer, from Hayward, California, was a musician who also went by the 
stage name Nex Iuguolo and was part of a band calledSymbiotix.Fungi 
<https://www.facebook.com/SymbiotixFungi/>. His longtime friend Amanda Fish, 
who met Wittenauer in high school, said that he was part of a tight-knit 
community in the East Bay music scene.


“It was great that he found all these Oakland events. He found similar artists 
and they all encouraged each other,” he said. “He knew everybody in the room. 
He was like Mr Charisma ... Chase made everyone around him feel loved.”

Wittenauer grew up in Santa Maria, California, and became very interested in 
experimental music Fish described as “industrial techno”.

“He was sweet and sincere and charming and he was really curious about the 
universe,” she added. “He was just excited about life. He had tons of energy … 
and he really encouraged you to follow your dreams. He’s going to leave a huge 
hole in our life.”

Wittenauer was one of the most supportive people at local arts events, said 
Tiare Ribeaux, a local curator. “He was always putting other people first and 
always really wanting to see the community thrive.”
