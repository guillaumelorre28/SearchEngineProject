Writing a novel from scratch, which is to say without training, was such an 
unexpected odyssey that I was prompted to recall the discoveries in my new book,
Release the Bats <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/release-the-bats.html> – as 
much to remind myself where the power lay as to pass the keys on to others 
trying their luck. I didn’t read a lot before writing a novel, but I realise 
now that certain books helped set me up. Writing fiction means writing vibrant 
human characters, and luck is with us in terms of research, as we haven’t 
essentially changed since we came down from the trees. So the best grounding 
for a fiction writer must be one that explores human nature with gloves off. 
There’s nothing like literature from ancient Rome bemoaning consumer culture to 
show that nothing is new, or literature from Habsburg Italy telling how to hire 
nuns for sex from the mothers superior of convents to put Fifty Shades in 
perspective. Which is to say that if we haven’t figured ourselves out by now, 
there’s still time: we’re not going anywhere.


 So my choice of books for writers is slanted towards those that expose our 
colours. For balance, I throw in a couple on writing as well.

1. To generate early inspiration and feel part of a club:
Daily Rituals by Mason Currey <http://masoncurrey.com/>
Writing can make you feel like a weirdo if you don’t already – but feeling 
like a weirdo is useless psychology for the job, hence this little book. Mason 
Currey has carefully compiled the daily habits and personal foibles of 161 
great writers, artists, scientists and thinkers, including one who stood on his 
head to cure creative block. By the end of this book, our carpet-glue habit 
looks normal.

2. To know how many rules we’re about to break:
The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr and EB White 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/04/100-best-nonfiction-books-all-time-elements-style-william-strunk-eb-white>
The rules of modern writing have been around for a century, and this tiny 
volume is where they spent all that time. William Strunk Jr, professor of 
English at Cornell University, first printed the book privately for his 
students at the end of the first world war. Although it’s been updated, it 
still smells of chalk and tweed, and still inspires us to do things properly, 
if only via a sense that we might be shouted at if we don’t.

3. To grasp the difference between one character and another:
Distinction by Pierre Bourdieu 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/distinction.html>
This is strictly speaking a sociology text, but don’t be put off by its 
density, its diagrams or its tables: it’s a gold mine. Apparently, no judgment 
of taste is innocent, meaning that everyone is some kind of snob. Here, 
Bourdieu literally maps the kinds of snob we are, from the food we serve our 
friends and the knick-knacks on our dressers to the way we value pregnant women 
and sunsets. Although it’s modelled on the French bourgeoisie, we can still see 
all our colleagues and neighbours – if not ourselves – inside.

4. To worship at a shrine:
The Chambers Dictionary 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/chambers-dictionary.html>
Sure, all the words are online, but the 2.37kg of this physical dictionary are 
a stunning daily reminder of what we’re doing and what our toolbox looks like. 
Thinking isn’t writing, ideas aren’t writing; only writing is writing and we 
should make it exist in reality, which means ultimately not on a screen. Words 
behave differently when they sit in fresh air, and the Chambers rounds them up 
on silky paper. If you’re serious about this, carry the thing around, browse it 
at random. It’s a living zoo for writers, and the battery life is second to 
none.

5. To skip the degree in psychology:
Instant Analysis by David J Lieberman 
<http://www.notable-quotes.com/l/lieberman_david_j.html>
A character’s struggles in a book will always have their psychology. We don’t 
need a PhD in order to write them, we just see the symptoms around us and 
describe them as they appear. But there’s an edge to be gained from looking 
deeper, if only to prevailing simplifications. Lieberman’s book tackles 100 
common complexes (“Why do I do favours for people I don’t even like? 
<https://journeyman.live/2014/05/04/key-points-from-book-instant-analysis/>”) 
in a couple of pages each. Obviously we’ll also see ourselves in there, but 
there’s nothing like naked horror to get the day started.

6. To discover what villains are born knowing:
The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/27/prince-niccolo-machiavelli-tim-parks>
Originally an instruction manual for princes, this realpolitik masterwork 
teaches who should be trusted and how to destroy them if they can’t be. The 
scary thing about The Prince, no doubt responsible for its longevity – 500 
years and counting – is how snugly it fits any level of human powerplay,, from 
an average Thursday night for a courting teen to that lonely, bitter man on the 
wheelie-bin committee.


7. To get over the feeling that modernity is new:
Satyricon by Petronius Arbiter 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/satyricon-373651.html>
Few things can change one’s perspective on human history like seeing how 
familiar and modern this work from Nero’s time is. Better yet, it’s from a 
decadence just like ours, brimming with risky sex, pretentious food and 
self-concern.

 8. In case Brexit didn’t show why pure democracy should be sparingly used:
Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/extraordinary-popular-delusions-and-the-madness-of-crowds-3.html>
No matter the strength of hero or the scale of glory we plan to write about, 
it never hurts to see how bizarre we can be en masse. Written in beautiful 
19th-century prose, this book is a forensic jaunt through history’s strangest 
crazes.

9. For a smell of literary gasoline igniting:
The Black Book by Lawrence Durrell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/15/lawrence-durrell-black-book-review>
It’s one thing to hear of passion and midnight oil, another to see it spilt 
through a book. These were the pages where 24-year-old Lawrence Durrell found 
his true voice – it’s worth reading them just to see what that means. One for 
inspiration.

10. To see what can happen when it all comes together:
Tender Is the Night by F Scott Fitzgerald 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tender-is-the-night-14.html>
Of all the books I could recommend to show writing in full flight, I pick 
Tender because it also comes with the unlikely extra shine of an underdog. The 
Great Gatsby is accepted to be Fitzgerald’s greatest work, but this is secretly 
his best, a connoisseur’s choice. Which, according to Bourdieu, makes us snobs.
