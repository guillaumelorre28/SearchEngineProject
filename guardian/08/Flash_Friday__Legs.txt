moving. Through the small window above the sink the rising sun was bleaching 
the room white. The sound of a garbage truck, a man calling his dog, newspapers 
hitting doorsteps. Her long, bare legs were out in front of her, knees like 
turned down saucers. He loved her legs. Something he’d miss. Their backs on the 
kitchen cabinets, his arm so close to hers. They were tired, but more thirsty. 
A glass of water would change things, she thought, if he would just get up and 
get a glass of water.
