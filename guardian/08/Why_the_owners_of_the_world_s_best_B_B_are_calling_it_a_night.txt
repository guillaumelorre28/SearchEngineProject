Search for bed and breakfast accommodation on the travel website TripAdvisor, 
and you are somewhat spoiled for choice: there are almost one million 
worldwide. “It’s actually 869,687,” says Sue Burrell. “I mean, roughly 
speaking.”

It is a figure she and husband Andrew have good reason to know well – because, 
for 12 months, their own little lodging in the North Yorkshire market town of 
Masham was officially the best of the lot.

Their guesthouse, Millgate <http://www.millgate-masham.co.uk/>, was named No 1 
on the planet in the website’sTravellers’ Choice awards 
<https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/TravelersChoice> in 2015. Not bad for a place 
set up only three years earlier because the kids had moved out and the house – 
a former munitions store built around 1580 – felt empty. And certainly not bad 
when you consider the competition.

“There were places with infinity pools, private butlers, views on to the 
Pacific,” muses Sue. “But, then, in fairness, I do bake a nice scone for 
everyone who comes.”

Now what are the couple, aged 63 and 60, doing? They are quitting at the top 
and going to live on a narrowboat. News of the honour went live at 5am on 21 
January. By 5.08am, the first booking had come in. Then the phone never 
stopped. “I wanted to call my mum to tell her,” remembers Sue. “But literally 
every time I put the phone down, it rang again. Eventually, we had to unplug 
it, just so we could cook breakfast.”

Within 24 hours, the couple – him a former country clothing wholesaler, her a 
one-time mental health nurse – had received 1,457 email enquiries from across 
the world. Within four days, they were booked up for the year.

“We had CNN call, wanting to feature us in a show,” recalls Sue. “They said: 
‘We have 240 million viewers.’ I said: ‘That’s lovely, but we only have three 
bedrooms.’ We didn’t do it.”

They also got a mention on Chris Evans’s Radio 2 breakfast radio show. “He 
didn’t come and stay, though,” notes Sue.

The secret to their success – should you have a room spare you fancy 
converting – seems to depend on who you ask.

Reviewers on TripAdvisor mention vintage beds and powerful showers; foodies 
rave about the breakfast trout, fished fresh by Andrew; and Americans … well, 
they just like the fireplace. “It’s 16th century,” explains Sue. “The wooden 
beams make their day, too.”

As for the couple themselves, they put their achievement down to something 
slightly more obscure: sixth-century Benedictine monks. Their monasteries had a 
philosophy that arriving strangers were to be treated like Jesus himself, as 
though they were the most important person in the world. “And that’s what we 
do,” explains Andrew. “It sounds simple, but you’d be surprised how many places 
don’t.”

Oh, and their other secret is not to worry too much about profits. Most of the 
money Millgate has made has gone on renovations. “And cushions,” says Sue. 
“Andrew gets annoyed because I’ll go to town and arrive home with more. But 
soft furnishings, they’re an investment, aren’t they?”
