If you should have an ex-husband, who first writes, then doesn’t write, then 
writes to the point of absurdity, then refuses to write, refuses to receive 
correspondence from you, refuses to acknowledge you in any way, denies you 
exist, then writes again, angrily this time, then less angrily, then angrily 
again, then leaves off writing altogether, not without a final declaration – he 
has compromised himself by writing to you, you should not expect to hear from 
him – and if each time you are taken in by this, are at the very edge by his 
either not writing or writing, are poised on the side of a cliff, waiting to 
see, wanting to know, which is it: will he not write? will he write? until a 
little time passes without his writing, and you slowly take a step back, and a 
little more time passes, and you take another step back from the cliff that you 
thought would surely claim your life, and another step, and a few more, until 
you find you are on a path walking the other way.
