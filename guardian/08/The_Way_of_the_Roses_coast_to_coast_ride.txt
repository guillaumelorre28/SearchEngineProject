Route notes

One of England's great rides, this painstakingly planned route, completed in 
2010, leads riders from the Irish Sea at Morecambe Bay 171 miles west to the 
North Sea at Bridlington. Taking in car‑free dedicated paths and byways as well 
as cycle lanes and quieter roads, riders pass quickly through Lancashire, over 
the Pennines into Yorkshire.

Terrain and gradients

A bit of everything, including road, cinder track, tarmac, earth and stone. 
Expect hills, particularly near Settle, where you climb to just over 400m 
(1,300ft).

How to get there/away

If you can ride 171 miles, you should be able to make the brief extra bit to 
and from the railway stations at Morecambe and Bridlington at either end. There 
are plenty of stations near and on the route for those attempting the route in 
sections, including those at Settle, York and Driffield.

What to see

You'll see stunning countryside, including the Lune valley, Forest of Bowland, 
Yorkshire Dales, Nidderdale (an area of outstanding natural beauty), the Vale 
of York and the Yorkshire Wolds. For those short on supplies, or merely pining 
for civilisation, the route also passes through historic York, with its 
spectacular cathedral, and the beautiful market town of Ripon.

Accommodation and watering holes

Plenty of both along the route, and it's worth planning and booking ahead for 
such a long ride. Adedicated route website <http://www.wayoftheroses.info> 
contains links to the two dozen-plus stops en route. Pub highlights include the
Craven Arms <http://www.craven-cruckbarn.co.uk> in Appletreewick, the Black Bull
 <http://www.blackbullboroughbridge.co.uk> in Boroughbridge, the Lamb and Lion 
<http://www.lambandlionyork.com> in York, and the Bell in Driffield (Market 
Place, YO25 6AN).Brookhouse Guest House <http://www.brookhouse-clapham.co.uk>, 
directly on the route at Clapham in the Dales, has very comfortable rooms and 
can cook a great meal. Further along,Bewerley Hall Farm  
<http://www.bewerleyhallfarm.co.uk> in Pateley Bridge offers B&B accommodation 
or self‑catering cottages.Highfield Farm <http://www.highfieldfarm.co.uk> in 
Southburn, near Driffield, is also a great place to rest weary legs.
