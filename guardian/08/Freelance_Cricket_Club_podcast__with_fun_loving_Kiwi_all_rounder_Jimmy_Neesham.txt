Jimmy Neesham’s Test career started with a bang. He made a century in his 
first Test match and, during that innings, was stood at the other end as his 
captain, Brendon McCullum became the first New Zealander to score a 
triple-century. In Neesham’s next Test, his first overseas, he also made a 
century too. Easy game, cricket.

Less than a year later, however, he was left out of McCullum’s freewheeling 
side for the 2015 World Cup, which was held in Australia and New Zealand: a 
tournament that swept a nation in a way that cricket never had before. And 
Neesham was lying on his living room floor clutching his injured back. Slowly 
but surely, he has battled back and is now eyeing an international recall by 
playing forDerbyshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/derbyshire> in the T20 
Blast.

Fortunately, Neesham has a sense of humour. He is one of the few cricketers to 
engage with fans humorouslyon Twitter <https://twitter.com/JimmyNeesh> and, 
during that World Cup particularly, he was on magnificent online form. This 
week he chats to us about the internet, his career and as what he would change 
about cricket. He’s just as fun in person, and we hope you enjoy it.
