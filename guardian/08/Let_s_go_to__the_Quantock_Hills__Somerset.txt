Why go now?
To celebrate the 60th anniversary of Somerset’s Quantock Hills being 
designated England’s first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), there are
events at Halsway Manor 
<http://halswaymanor.org.uk/event/quantock-experience-july-2016/>, including 
wildlife walks, cider tasting and ceilidhs (27-30 June). The little-known 
region is a 12-mile ridge between Bridgwater, Taunton and Minehead, made up of 
ancient oak combes, open heathland hilltops and rugged coastline.

What else is there to do?
Fabulous walks among the red deer and wild ponies, foraging for 
whortleberries, including part of theColeridge Way 
<http://www.visit-exmoor.co.uk/coleridge-way/cw-walking-route> and a hike over 
a secret volcano <http://www.visit-exmoor.co.uk/active-secrets#volcano>. Visits 
to the wild gardens atFyne Court <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/fyne-court> 
(the house itself burned down in 1894) andColeridge’s Cottage 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/coleridge-cottage> at Nether Stowey.

Anywhere good to eat?
Clavelshay Barn <http://www.clavelshaybarn.co.uk/> in North Petherton serves 
seasonal British food such as hake with jersey royals, brown shrimps and 
samphire. Tea rooms serving Somerset cream teas abound – Chantry Tea Gardens at 
Kilve has a picturesque setting among the ruins of a medieval chapel.

How about a drink?
According to the Quantock Hills AONB website 
<http://www.quantockhills.com/eat_and_stay>, you are never more than 1.7 miles 
away from a pub (although the whole area is only 12 miles by 4…). One of the 
best is theCarew Arms <http://www.thecarewarms.co.uk> in Crowcombe, an old 
village pub with a flagstone-floored front bar serving local beers. TheFarmers 
Arms <http://www.farmersarmsatcombeflorey.co.uk/> in Combe Florey, just outside 
the AONB, is a thatched pub with up to seven real ales and ciders, plus craft 
beer.
