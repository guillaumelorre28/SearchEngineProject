Walks up back road, holding on to hat, what he calls a skimmer, sees first one 
horse then another. Walks on. Climbs gate, jumps, lands wonky. Heart is huge. 
The lake captivates a loosening rain cloud.

Thinks of twilight, privet hedges and a bookcase falling forward. Wishes for 
something. Raises hem out of the muck. Frayed lining drops, gets caught on a 
thorn, tears. Rain cloud pours down into the lake.

Walks down back road, holding on to hat, what she calls a boater, sees the 
second horse first. White. A white horse standing, looks this way, then turns. 
Gave birth in the meantime. Blood fresh all the way down hind legs, cord hangs. 
A black foal slides about nearby, tiny forehead opening a warm pale star. Heart 
lengthens; cord swings.

 Removes hat and whispers something. Whispers something again. Looks back, 
envies the deluge, moves into the long grass. Lets a van pass by.
