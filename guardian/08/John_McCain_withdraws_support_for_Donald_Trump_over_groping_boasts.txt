The Arizona senator issued a statement declaring it “impossible to continue to 
offer even conditional support” for Trump, in the wake ofleaked video and audio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-tape-quit-republicans-lewd-comments>
 showing Trump boasting about making sexual advances toward women without their 
consent.

“Cindy and I will not vote for Donald Trump,” McCain said in a statement that 
included his wife. “I have never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate 
and we will not vote for Hillary Clinton. We will write in the name of some 
good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president.”

Shortly after McCain released his statement, Trump made a surprise appearance 
outside Trump Tower in New York City. Early on Saturday evening, the 
billionaire emerged from his skyscraper, where he had been in crisis talks and 
debate preparation all day, to greet a group of 100 ardent supporters who had 
been demonstrating outside the building since morning.

Trump shook his fist in the air, waved and pointed, without saying anything. 
He then went quickly back into the building. His appearance raised a huge 
commotion among those gathered on Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan, prompting 
cheers and chants of “Trump for president” and “USA! USA!”

Trump’s sex boasts: ‘When you are a star they let you do anything’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video>
One onlooker, Karen Stecher from Windsor, Canada, said: “It’s ridiculous. I’ve 
seen a crowd react to a star in LA but it wasn’t like this. This is like 
entertainment but it’s scary because of the anger and aggression.”

The appearance came as it emerged Trump had made similarly crude comments 
about his relationships with women in a series of interviews with the US “shock 
jock” Howard Stern. The Republican candidate reportedly bragged about sleeping 
with 24-year-olds, described a woman reaching the age of 35 as “checkout time” 
and described his daughter Ivanka as having “always been very voluptuous”.

On Saturday afternoon Trump’s wife, Melania, released a statement in which she 
said Trump’s comments in conversation with the Access Hollywood presenter Billy 
Bush were offensive but asked the American people to see that her husband had 
“the heart and mind of a leader”.

Reached with a request for comment about the mounting controversy surrounding 
her father’s campaign, Ivanka Trump hung up on the Guardian.

McCain, locked in a tough re-election battle in Arizona, condemned Trump’s 
comments after the release of the 11-year-old Access Hollywood recording on 
Friday but initially stopped short of rescinding his endorsement. As leading 
Republican officials launchedan exodus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-list-of-republicans-reject-support-endorsement>
 from Trump in the 24 hours that followed, he faced quickly mounting pressure.

He missed the chance to show political courage. It’s too late, John McCain. 
The people of Arizona deserve better
Anne Kirkpatrick, McCain opponent 
In his statement on Saturday, he said he had “wanted to support the candidate 
our party nominated” and respect the Republican primary process.

“He was not my choice, but as a past nominee I thought it important I respect 
the fact that Donald Trump won a majority of the delegates by the rules our 
party set. I thought I owed his supporters that deference,” McCain wrote.

McCain’s Senate race could determine whether the Republican party maintains 
its precarious control of the chamber. OtherRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> who disavowed their support 
for Trump on Saturday included Senate candidates Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, 
Rob Portman of Ohio, and Joe Heck of Nevada.

Some Republicans formally called on Trump to step aside and allow his running 
mate, Indiana governorMike Pence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence>, to become the party’s 
standard-bearer with just 30 days left until election day. Such voices included 
John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate.

Democrats swiftly rejected the desertion of Trump by those who had endorsed 
him as political calculation – pointing out that Republicans had stood by the 
former reality TV star even as he disparaged Mexican immigrants, Muslims, 
prisoners of war, the disabled and the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero 
and repeatedly made crude statements about women.

“McCain made it clear a long time ago: he is no longer a straight-talking 
maverick,” Ann Kirkpatrick, the Democratic congresswoman challenging McCain for 
his seat, said in a statement. “He missed the chance to show political courage 
and lead. He failed that test. Now, it’s too late,John McCain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/johnmccain>. The people of Arizona deserve 
better.”

Robert De Niro: ‘I’d like to punch Donald Trump in the face’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/08/robert-de-niro-id-like-to-punch-donald-trump-in-the-face-video>
McCain was the first prominent Republican to criticize Trump’s continued 
insistence thatthe Central Park Five 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york>
, five young African Americans wrongfully convicted of rape in New York City in 
1989, were guilty.

Despite the fact that the men’s convictions were overturned by DNA evidence, 
Trump insisted on Friday that the five, whom he called for to be executed at 
the time, were still guilty,pointing out  
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/06/politics/reality-check-donald-trump-central-park-5/>
to CNN that the youths confessed at the time. Trump did not mention that they 
were beaten by police and that New York City paid a $41m settlement.

On Saturday, Pence seemed to leave the crisis entirely in Trump’s hands. In a 
statement, Pence said: “As a husband and father I was offended by the words and 
actions described by Donald Trump in the 11-year-old video released yesterday.

“I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them. I am grateful that he 
has expressed remorse.”

Pence seemed to suggest that much would depend on Trump’s performance in the 
second presidential debate, scheduled for Sunday in St Louis.

“We pray for his family,” he said, “and look forward to the opportunity he has 
to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.”

Paul Ryan <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/paul-ryan> addressed a crowd at 
a Republican event in Wisconsin, to boos and heckles from Trump supporters. The 
nominee had been invited to attend by the House speaker but in the wake of the 
controversy on Friday, Ryan rescinded this invitation.

On Saturday Ryan took to the stage, saying “there is a bit of an elephant in 
the room”. He then referenced his statement on the issue, in which he said he 
was “sickened” by Trump’s remarks, before making clear “that’s not what we are 
here to talk about today”.

The Clinton campaign remained silent throughout the day. The Democratic 
nominee will address the issue at Sunday’s presidential debate, a campaign 
official told the Guardian, as that forum will provide her with the largest 
possible audience.

The thinking within Clinton’s campaign was to let Trump suffer the 
repercussions of being unendorsed en masse by members of his own party. 
Surrogates for the former secretary of state were also encouraged to temper 
their responses.

Clinton’s team was also certain Trump would remain the Republican nominee, the 
official said, it beingtoo late to remove him from the ballot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/what-happens-if-donald-trump-quits-presidential-race-election-experts>
. The campaign has not yet shifted its resources in light of the leaked video 
and plans to move forward with the same battleground plan.

In Manhattan, Trump’s appearance outside Trump Tower drew enthusiastic 
responses from the nominee’s supporters. One, Joseph Conigliaro, said: “I was 
excited to see him. He came out of nowhere! Everyone was screaming.

 “He made those comments when he was a businessman and a TV star. They mean 
nothing. People say a lot of things in private they wouldn’t say in public 
running for office. It’s freedom of speech. We weren’t paying him. He was in 
business.”

Another supporter, Anne ‎McLain, said: “I felt so excited. I appreciate it. I 
called him Mr President. He’s going to build a wall to look after our national 
security. He loves women. Regardless of what he said in a bar 10 years ago.”
