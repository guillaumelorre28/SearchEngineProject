Maria Callas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/sep/14/mariacallasthegreatest>
, the opera singer who put as much passion into her life as into her art, died 
in her Paris flat yesterday of a heart attack. She was 53. The “divine Callas” 
was the international symbol of prima donnas, as much for her incomparable 
voice as for her tantrums and her long love affair with the Greek ship owner 
Aristotle Onassis.

She had not appeared on stage in the last four years. Friends said her 
obsession with her weight and vigorous dieting have contributed to her sudden 
death. She was plagued by weight problems all her life. At 20, she weighed 15 
stones. In the fifties she had to crash-diet, losing more than four stones in a 
few weeks, so that she could take leading romantic roles.

Her close friend, Lord Harewood, managing director of the English National 
Opera <https://www.theguardian.com/music/opera> Company, yesterday described 
stories of her temperamental outbursts as “exaggerated.” But, he added, “the 
legend will live on. She was a truly great artist. I doubt if we will ever see 
another like her in our time. She was unique. She was much better in person 
than on records. The records do not do her justice.” He said Callas never sang 
in private - “she was an artist for the large stage.”

In Barcelona, soprano Victoria de los Angeles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jan/17/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries>
 burst into tears at the news of Callas’s death. “Something very, very 
important has gone, for the world of music, for art -in spite of all that has 
been said about her

 Maria Callas sings Casta Diva, from Vincenzo Bellini’s Norma 
Maria Callas was the daughter of a Brooklyn Greek-American chemist called 
Kalogeropoulos and began her singing lessons at the age of eight. She was 15 
when her parents divorced. She went toGreece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> with her mother and continued her 
studies at the Athens Conservatoire.

From her debut in the Athens Royal Opera it seemed that despite her 
exceptional voice her weight would preclude her from taking the best operatic 
roles.

Her eventual success was partly due to the encouragement of her husband, 
Italian industrialist Gian Battista Meneghini, whom she left in 1959 after 11 
years.

Her voice, which ranged over three octaves, fascinated music lovers, and she 
was also a dramatic actress of exceptional talent, starring in Pasolini’s Medea 
in 1970.

But her fame grew also through a series of dramatic incidents both on stage 
and in her love affair with Onassis - “the big love in my life.” She lost her 
voice several times and broke down on stage on a number of occasions, once in 
front of the Italian President.

She did not marry Onassis, she once said, because “love is much better when 
you are not married.” She said she bore no ill will to Jackie Kennedy, and took 
the marriage “in her stride.”

But Mr Harold Rosenthal, editor of Opera, the leading opera magazine, said 
yesterday that the ending of the romance and Onassis’s subsequent marriage to 
Jackie Kennedy had affected Callas “psychologically.”

“It had a big effect on her. It was a case of her musical life being subdued 
by her personal life. It was a great tragedy because in the decade 1952-1962 
she more or less single-handed revitalised Italian opera.”

Nevertheless, the red-haired singer kept in the news and retained her 
popularity during her retirement from the stage for eight years until 1973. Her 
brief European tour, when she sang for the public for the last time inParis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris>, was a triumph despite obvious voice 
problems.”

The last image of Maria Callas was given yesterday by her artistic director, 
Michel Glotz, who saw her soon after she collapsed in her bathroom and died in 
her bed. “It was the image ofLa Traviata 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/20/maria-callas-verdi-traviata-review>
 as she played it in 1956 at La Scala,” he said. “Her face has not even one 
wrinkle. She has the air that she is only resting.”
