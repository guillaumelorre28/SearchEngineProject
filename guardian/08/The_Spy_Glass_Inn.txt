Ideally situated on Ventnor esplanade, The Spy Glass has all you need for a 
fine pub drinking and dining experience ... and then you hear the sound of the 
sea. No surprise then that the menu is all about seafood, featuring popular 
dishes such as local crab baguettes (£7.50) and homemade fisherman's pie 
(£9.25). For those with a bit more cash to splash there's the equally popular 
lobster salad (£21.95) and the Captain's Platter (including half lobster at 
£26.50). The range of drinks on offer is solid, with local ales sitting 
alongside bigger names on the bar (average pint £2.90). Constructed in 1834, 
and once a smugglers' haunt, these days the The Spy Glass has an excellent 
reputation and attracts a happy mix of islanders and tourists the world over.
