Saeed Kamali Dehghan

Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, reacted to Trump’s win by saying that it 
would not change the trajectory of his country’s foreign policy and that the 
US’s credibility among the international community had already diminished,
reports Saeed Kamali Dehghan. 

“The US election results will have no impact on the policies of the Islamic 
Republic,” the Iranian cleric said during a Wednesday meeting with his cabinet, 
according to the semi-official Isna news agency. “Because of wrong policies, 
the position of America in the international community and world’s public 
opinion has diminished and [the US’s] growing rift with Europe and the world 
will exacerbate that position.”

The country’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, meanwhile, said that the 
US had to continue respecting last year’s landmark nuclear agreement, whose 
fate rests much in the hands of the new American president. “America has to 
implement the international obligation it accepted under the nuclear deal,” he 
was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency while on an 
official visit to Romania.

Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesman for Iran’s atomic energy agency said that 
Tehran would continue abiding by the nuclear accord despite Trump’s win. Tasnim 
cited Behrouz Kamalvandi as saying that “Iran is prepared for all kind of 
change” and that the country “would continue implementing the Barjam,” Iranian 
acronym of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or the final nuclear 
accord.

Tasnim, which is affiliated to the elite Iranian Revolutionary Guards, saw 
Donald Trump’s win as a vindication for the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah 
Ali Khamenei, who said last week that the American businessman appeared to be 
the one saying the truth about the state of affairs in the US.

Referring to Trump, Khamenei said last week: “What is interesting is that the 
person who spoke more candidly attracted more attention from the people of 
America. Because that man spoke more candidly and more openly, the people of 
America paid more attention to him. The other party [Clinton’s camp] said that 
he is adopting a populist method. Why populist? It is because the people were 
watching him and they saw that what he was saying was correct. They saw it in 
the realities of their life. Human values have been annihilated and trampled 
upon in that country. There is racial discrimination in that country.”

Fouad Izadi, a political analyst sympathetic to the conservative camp in Iran, 
said Trump’s presidency would be better for Iran than that of Clinton’s. “The 
only advantage of having Trump over Clinton in regards to Iran is that he would 
have much more difficulties in bringing together the international community in 
order to make obstacles for Iran,” he told Tasnim.

Analysts such as Izadi think that pressure on Iran in the past was because 
Obama had managed to persuade the US’s European allies to rally behind 
Washington in imposing sanctions on Iran. They think Trump lacks the 
credibility to do so in case the nuclear deal falls apart.

Andrew Sparrow

Jeremy Corbyn MP, leader of the Labour Party in the UK, gave the following 
statement:

 Many in Britain and elsewhere will be understandably shocked by Donald 
Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, the rhetoric around it and 
what the election result means for the rest of the world, as well as America.

Trump’s election is an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and 
an economic system that simply isn’t working for most people. It is one that 
has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards 
for the majority, both in the US and Britain.

This is a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that 
has been seen not to have listened. And the public anger that has propelled
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to office has 
been reflected in political upheavals across the world.

 But some of Trump’s answers to the big questions facing America, and the 
divisive rhetoric around them, are clearly wrong.

 I have no doubt, however, that the decency and common sense of the American 
people will prevail, and we send our solidarity to a nation of migrants, 
innovators and democrats.

After this latest global wake up call, the need for a real alternative to a 
failed economic and political system could not be clearer.

 That alternative must be based on working together, social justice and 
economic renewal, rather than sowing fear and division. And the solutions we 
offer have to improve the lives of everyone, not pit one group of people 
against another.

Americans have made their choice. The urgent necessity is now for us all to 
work across continents to tackle our common global challenges: to secure peace, 
take action on climate change and deliver economic prosperity and justice.

Graeme Wearden

After an initial panic, the financial markets are coming to terms with Donald 
Trump’s shock victory,reports the Guardian’s Graeme Wearden.

Trump’s call for America to “come together as one united people” has provided 
some comfort to shell-shocked investors. They are hoping that the president 
elect, after running such a divisive campaign, may be planning to soften his 
rhetoric.

Britain’s main stock index, the FTSE 100, has recovered from an early-morning 
slump and is now flat.

Losses are expected on Wall Street when trading begins in four hours time. The 
futures market says the Dow will fall by around 300 points, or nearly 2%. 
That’s a significant drop, but not the 800-point plunge we expected when the 
shock results rolled in last night.

The dollar also recovered some ground after Trump pledged to create “the 
strongest economy in the world” and is now down 0.5% against a basket of 
currencies. The Mexican peso has also struggled back off the mat, after hitting 
a record low overnight.

Ultimately, investors had expected Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> to win - so they’re now 
scrambling to work out what Trump’s victory is going to mean for the US 
economy, global trade and geopolitical stability.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index, a financial spread-betting firm, says:

“It is worth remembering that Trump started a “movement”, now he has to turn 
that into a political machine capable of ruling. We won’t know if he can be 
successful until he actually takes office in January.

For now, this is a strange day, politically and financially. We have suffered 
a massive political shock, but the markets are wondering if President Trump is 
less of a threat to America’s economy in office, compared to what he was during

Megan Carpentier

The audience at Clinton’s alma mater, Wellesley College, booed the 
announcement that Trump had won Ohio,reports the Guardian’s Megan Carpentier.

Shortly after midnight, when CNN showed Trump pulling away from Clinton in 
Pennsylvania, a few women shouted “No!” and “Why?” at no one in particular as 
the catering staff packed up the bar and dispatched the remains of the cheese 
plates and buffet sandwiches. More and more women could be seen crying on one 
another’s shoulders, while one group of women (and a couple of male friends) 
gave the middle finger to CNN’s Jake Tapper on the large screen.

Tempestt Morgan – still hoping against hope for a Clinton victory at 12:30am – 
wasn’t actually optimistic about the America into which she’d be entering as a 
college graduate next May. “Even if [Clinton] somehow makes it back from this, 
it’s still sad to see so many people aligned with a candidate like [Trump]” she 
said, referencing his comments about women and people of color.

Her friend, Jekia Brockman, looked around at the women crying – one of whom 
flopped over dramatically as yet another state was said to be leaning Trump – 
and said: “It’s not ‘unbelievable’. It’s completely believable.”

Lauren Gambino

Women in suits, mothers and daughters, hucksters selling “Nasty Women” pins 
and tens of thousands of members of the public came to Manhattan’s largestglass 
ceiling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/glass-ceiling-watch-blog-first-female-president-us-election>
 on Tuesday night, to await the result of a presidential election that many 
hoped would sweep away thehighest gender barrier in US politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/older-voters-hillary-clinton-woman-president>
.

As the night went on and results did not go the Democrats’ way, the mood in 
and around the building grew darker,reports the Guardian’s Lauren Gambino from 
Clinton’s election-night party in New York.

Inside, Clinton was supposed to speak on a stage constructed in the shape of 
the United States, her podium positioned somewhere over Texas, a deep red state 
that would stay that way despite a nationwide increase in the Hispanic vote 
that had fuelled hopes of turning it purple, if not Democratic blue. American 
flags lined the stage. The pledge of allegiance was said, the national anthem 
played.

Thunderous cheers rang off that glass ceiling as newscasters announced that 
Clinton had won Illinois, the state where she was born. States came and went, 
largely as expected: Delaware, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island for 
Clinton, South Carolina, Alabama and more for Trump. But things were 
predictably close in Florida, and as Trump surged back into contention tension 
rose at the Javits.

In the early hours of the morning, not long before the race was called and 
Clinton conceded, campaign chairman John Podesta took the stage to ask 
supporters if they could hang a little while longer.

“I can say we can wait a little longer can’t we?” Podesta said. “They’re still 
counting votes and every vote should count. Several states are too close to 
call, so we’re not going to have anything more to say tonight.”

Supporters made a teary exit. Mothers carried weary daughters out of the glass 
structure that in the end hosted shattered hopes, not broken barriers.

“What just happened,” Gloria Lowell asked, shaking her head. She repeated the 
question. A man turned around and raised his beer.

“We lost,” he said. “We lost and it hurts.” The pair of strangers embraced.

Andrew Sparrow

British Prime Minister Theresa May has released a statement congratulating 
Trump on his victory in the presidential election. She said:

I would like to congratulate Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> on being elected the next 
President of the United States, following a hard-fought campaign.

Britain and the United States have an enduring and special relationship based 
on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise.

We are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and 
defence.

I look forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump, building on these 
ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead.

The mood in the US: readers' react

Sarah Marsh

We’ve been gathering views on the mood in the US. Here, a group of American 
readers tell us what they think.

Susan Hall from Illinois sent in her response, saying: “A long hard fought 
campaign. I am very proud of our new president and vice president. The message 
shared has set the right tone for his presidency. It’s time to now begin the 
hard work and healing of our nation. I understand there are many feeling uneasy 
right now. I think if they keep an open mind and open arms, the US can come 
together like never before. The future is what we decide to make it at this 
point. “

Woody from Washington was similarly excited, declaring it a victory for 
average Americans.

I voted for Obama twice, and really he should go down as one of the worst 
presidents in history. Obamacare is a disaster, our ability to project our 
strength in the world has diminished. We have become more divided as a nation 
under his guidance. Hillary would only have expanded on his failures. We saw 
scandal after scandal when Bill was in the Oval Office. She should have been 
prosecuted for her illegal server and lied under oath. She would have expanded 
immigration causing unrest like we are seeing in Europe at this moment.

The Supreme Court will have several openings and Trump will appoint nominees 
who will preserve our constitution and bill of rights. More than anything I am 
so relieved Hillary didn’t win as I don’t trust her.

Others were much less enthusiastic. 

Anton Prosser from Texas said he felt bad when George W. Bush was elected, but 
he’s never felt afraid until now. 

I’m trans, and I’m worried about what will happen to me in this America now. 
If the courts will see challenges to every bit of equality for LGBT+ Americans. 
I’m scared that if I attempt to legally transition, my marriage could be 
invalidated or my health care taken away if we lose the few protections we 
have. I’m scared to use a bathroom in any public place, because I never know if 
strangers see me as a man or a woman. I’m scared of what could happen to all of 
us.

Here’s an overview of where we are this morning:

 * Donald Trump has won the presidency 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-wins-us-election-news>
 in a stunning upset that surprised pollsters and media alike. 
 * Hillary Clinton called Trump to concede the election shortly after 
Wisconsin was called for the Republican candidate, sealing his victory. 
 * The former secretary of state did not make a concession speech, instead she 
allowed advisor John Podesta to tell the crowd at her party in New York’s 
Javits Center to go home. She’sexpected to make a concession speech this morning
. 
 * In his victory speech, Trump called for unity, praising Clinton for a 
hard-fought campaign and saying “Now it is time for America to heal the wounds 
of division.” 
 * Oakland, New York, Los Angeles and Washington DC have seen anti-Trump 
protests overnight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-live?page=with:block-5822e064e4b0eda0192fdbd2#block-5822e064e4b0eda0192fdbd2>
, burning Trump effigies and smashing a window at the Oakland Tribune. 
 * The Republicans won big all round 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/us-congress-election-results-senate-house-democrats-republicans>
 - maintaining and strengthening its control of the Senate 51-47 after wins in 
Florida, Pennsylvania and Indiana. Congress also remains Republican controlled 
236-191. 
 * Asian stocks and the US dollar dropped after news of a likely Trump win 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/09/financial-markets-set-for-record-falls-after-asian-shares-battered-by-trump-surge>

Donald Trump wins US election: the world reacts – live

Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, reacted to Trump’s win by saying that it 
would not change the trajectory of his country’s foreign policy and that the 
US’s credibility among the international community had already diminished,
reports Saeed Kamali Dehghan. 

“The US election results will have no impact on the policies of the Islamic 
Republic,” the Iranian cleric said during a Wednesday meeting with his cabinet, 
according to the semi-official Isna news agency. “Because of wrong policies, 
the position of America in the international community and world’s public 
opinion has diminished and [the US’s] growing rift with Europe and the world 
will exacerbate that position.”

The country’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, meanwhile, said that the 
US had to continue respecting last year’s landmark nuclear agreement, whose 
fate rests much in the hands of the new American president. “America has to 
implement the international obligation it accepted under the nuclear deal,” he 
was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency while on an 
official visit to Romania.

Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesman for Iran’s atomic energy agency said that 
Tehran would continue abiding by the nuclear accord despite Trump’s win. Tasnim 
cited Behrouz Kamalvandi as saying that “Iran is prepared for all kind of 
change” and that the country “would continue implementing the Barjam,” Iranian 
acronym of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or the final nuclear 
accord.

Tasnim, which is affiliated to the elite Iranian Revolutionary Guards, saw 
Donald Trump’s win as a vindication for the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah 
Ali Khamenei, who said last week that the American businessman appeared to be 
the one saying the truth about the state of affairs in the US.

Referring to Trump, Khamenei said last week: “What is interesting is that the 
person who spoke more candidly attracted more attention from the people of 
America. Because that man spoke more candidly and more openly, the people of 
America paid more attention to him. The other party [Clinton’s camp] said that 
he is adopting a populist method. Why populist? It is because the people were 
watching him and they saw that what he was saying was correct. They saw it in 
the realities of their life. Human values have been annihilated and trampled 
upon in that country. There is racial discrimination in that country.”

Fouad Izadi, a political analyst sympathetic to the conservative camp in Iran, 
said Trump’s presidency would be better for Iran than that of Clinton’s. “The 
only advantage of having Trump over Clinton in regards to Iran is that he would 
have much more difficulties in bringing together the international community in 
order to make obstacles for Iran,” he told Tasnim.

Analysts such as Izadi think that pressure on Iran in the past was because 
Obama had managed to persuade the US’s European allies to rally behind 
Washington in imposing sanctions on Iran. They think Trump lacks the 
credibility to do so in case the nuclear deal falls apart.
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has updated his 
Twitter bio to reflect his new position:
 Trump’s Twitter bio Photograph: Twitter  
Jeremy Corbyn MP, leader of the Labour Party in the UK, gave the following 
statement:

 Many in Britain and elsewhere will be understandably shocked by Donald 
Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, the rhetoric around it and 
what the election result means for the rest of the world, as well as America.

Trump’s election is an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and 
an economic system that simply isn’t working for most people. It is one that 
has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards 
for the majority, both in the US and Britain.

This is a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that 
has been seen not to have listened. And the public anger that has propelled
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to office has 
been reflected in political upheavals across the world.

 But some of Trump’s answers to the big questions facing America, and the 
divisive rhetoric around them, are clearly wrong.

 I have no doubt, however, that the decency and common sense of the American 
people will prevail, and we send our solidarity to a nation of migrants, 
innovators and democrats.

After this latest global wake up call, the need for a real alternative to a 
failed economic and political system could not be clearer.

 That alternative must be based on working together, social justice and 
economic renewal, rather than sowing fear and division. And the solutions we 
offer have to improve the lives of everyone, not pit one group of people 
against another.

Americans have made their choice. The urgent necessity is now for us all to 
work across continents to tackle our common global challenges: to secure peace, 
take action on climate change and deliver economic prosperity and justice.
 
This is the moment CNN’s Van Jones called Trump’s victory a “whitelash” 
against America’s first black president:

After an initial panic, the financial markets are coming to terms with Donald 
Trump’s shock victory,reports the Guardian’s Graeme Wearden.

Trump’s call for America to “come together as one united people” has provided 
some comfort to shell-shocked investors. They are hoping that the president 
elect, after running such a divisive campaign, may be planning to soften his 
rhetoric.

Britain’s main stock index, the FTSE 100, has recovered from an early-morning 
slump and is now flat.

Losses are expected on Wall Street when trading begins in four hours time. The 
futures market says the Dow will fall by around 300 points, or nearly 2%. 
That’s a significant drop, but not the 800-point plunge we expected when the 
shock results rolled in last night.

The dollar also recovered some ground after Trump pledged to create “the 
strongest economy in the world” and is now down 0.5% against a basket of 
currencies. The Mexican peso has also struggled back off the mat, after hitting 
a record low overnight.

Ultimately, investors had expected Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> to win - so they’re now 
scrambling to work out what Trump’s victory is going to mean for the US 
economy, global trade and geopolitical stability.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index, a financial spread-betting firm, says:

“It is worth remembering that Trump started a “movement”, now he has to turn 
that into a political machine capable of ruling. We won’t know if he can be 
successful until he actually takes office in January.

For now, this is a strange day, politically and financially. We have suffered 
a massive political shock, but the markets are wondering if President Trump is 
less of a threat to America’s economy in office, compared to what he was during 
the campaign.”

are developing this evening in California and Oregon:

The audience at Clinton’s alma mater, Wellesley College, booed the 
announcement that Trump had won Ohio,reports the Guardian’s Megan Carpentier.

Shortly after midnight, when CNN showed Trump pulling away from Clinton in 
Pennsylvania, a few women shouted “No!” and “Why?” at no one in particular as 
the catering staff packed up the bar and dispatched the remains of the cheese 
plates and buffet sandwiches. More and more women could be seen crying on one 
another’s shoulders, while one group of women (and a couple of male friends) 
gave the middle finger to CNN’s Jake Tapper on the large screen.

Tempestt Morgan – still hoping against hope for a Clinton victory at 12:30am – 
wasn’t actually optimistic about the America into which she’d be entering as a 
college graduate next May. “Even if [Clinton] somehow makes it back from this, 
it’s still sad to see so many people aligned with a candidate like [Trump]” she 
said, referencing his comments about women and people of color.

Her friend, Jekia Brockman, looked around at the women crying – one of whom 
flopped over dramatically as yet another state was said to be leaning Trump – 
and said: “It’s not ‘unbelievable’. It’s completely believable.”
 
How it all unfolded:
How the 2016 US election night unfolded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/09/how-the-2016-us-election-night-unfolded-trump-clinton-video> 
Women in suits, mothers and daughters, hucksters selling “Nasty Women” pins 
and tens of thousands of members of the public came to Manhattan’s largestglass 
ceiling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/glass-ceiling-watch-blog-first-female-president-us-election>
 on Tuesday night, to await the result of a presidential election that many 
hoped would sweep away thehighest gender barrier in US politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/older-voters-hillary-clinton-woman-president>
.

As the night went on and results did not go the Democrats’ way, the mood in 
and around the building grew darker,reports the Guardian’s Lauren Gambino from 
Clinton’s election-night party in New York.

Inside, Clinton was supposed to speak on a stage constructed in the shape of 
the United States, her podium positioned somewhere over Texas, a deep red state 
that would stay that way despite a nationwide increase in the Hispanic vote 
that had fuelled hopes of turning it purple, if not Democratic blue. American 
flags lined the stage. The pledge of allegiance was said, the national anthem 
played.

Thunderous cheers rang off that glass ceiling as newscasters announced that 
Clinton had won Illinois, the state where she was born. States came and went, 
largely as expected: Delaware, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island for 
Clinton, South Carolina, Alabama and more for Trump. But things were 
predictably close in Florida, and as Trump surged back into contention tension 
rose at the Javits.

In the early hours of the morning, not long before the race was called and 
Clinton conceded, campaign chairman John Podesta took the stage to ask 
supporters if they could hang a little while longer.

“I can say we can wait a little longer can’t we?” Podesta said. “They’re still 
counting votes and every vote should count. Several states are too close to 
call, so we’re not going to have anything more to say tonight.”

Supporters made a teary exit. Mothers carried weary daughters out of the glass 
structure that in the end hosted shattered hopes, not broken barriers.

“What just happened,” Gloria Lowell asked, shaking her head. She repeated the 
question. A man turned around and raised his beer.

“We lost,” he said. “We lost and it hurts.” The pair of strangers embraced.

I look forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump, building on these
