From Glen Torridon, Liathach looks impregnable, with little sign of a way 
upwards; the path that worms up alongside the waterfalls of the Allt an Doire 
Ghairbh is invisible until we’re on it. The vast bulwarks and bastions of rock 
rise into a ceiling of white cloud, their full extent obscured.

We climb unhurriedly, content to wait for the forecasted “cloud free Munros” 
to materialise.

Like its enigmatic counterparts Suilven, Slioch or Stac Pollaidh, Liathach 
looks every bit its age, carrying the furrows of deep time in its vertiginously 
steppedTorridonian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torridonian> sandstone. To 
me, these hills of Wester Ross and Sutherland are not “ordinary” mountains but 
otherworldly artefacts from strange temporal dimensions.

The purple-pink-tinged Precambrian sandstone comprising the bulk of Liathach 
was laid down as long ago as 1,000m years, before multicellular organisms had 
evolved, and has preserved only plankton-like nannofossils. But the very top of 
Spidean a Choire Leith, one of Liathach’s two Munros, is crowned by Cambrian 
pipe rock, its name referring to the fossilised worm burrows found within it. 
You can run your fingers over these dimples and streaks like a biological 
braille, and interact with an epoch 500m years gone by, a world without fish or 
land flora, but where the teeming seabeds hosted an exponential explosion of 
animal life. If these hills are arcane monuments, these are their inscrutable 
hieroglyphics.

The fabled ridge along Liathach’s precipitous spine does not disappoint. I get 
giddy around heights, and have to suppress existential panic on sighting the 
pinnacles of Am Fasarinen – a line of mouldy molars with plunging abysses on 
either side – but a calm head prevails.

A rift does eventually appear in the cloud; it remains dammed against the 
ridge on one side but peels away entirely from the other to reveal the 
geological jumble of the Coulin Forest, a distant Ben Nevis and the soft blue 
arc of Skye. But as we walk back along the Glen Torridon road, it wells up and 
tumbles back over the ridge in foaming crests; the mountain assumes the shape 
and terror of a mega-tsunami as the top overspills and the giant wave begins to 
break.
