George Bailey says being struck on the helmet by a Nathan Coulter-Nile bouncer 
in theIPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl> was “like getting hit in the 
face by a truck”.

Former Australian T20 captain Bailey walked away from the blow unscathed, but 
his Rising Pune Supergiants helmet wasn’t so lucky, padding flying everywhere 
as it was knocked off the veteran’s head.

Bailey top-edged a ball from paceman Coulter-Nile – who made his Australian 
T20 debut under the Tasmanian in 2013 – before it flew into the grille of his 
helmet.

“Those watching on TV got a better picture than I did, because all I sort of 
remember was it was like getting hit in the face by a truck,” Bailey said. “It 
was pretty quick. I was quite glad to have one of the new helmets on.”

Bailey was lucky not to be dismissed by the ball from the Western Australian – 
his helmet falling just to the side of the stumps.

The Tasmanian crawled to eight off 18 deliveries, however it was enough to 
ensure the Supergiants claimed just their fourth victory of the tournament in 
the rain-affected match against Delhi.

Australian legspinner Adam Zampa claimed 3-21 for the Supergiants from his 
four overs, following on from his four-over spell of 6-19 against the Sunrisers 
Hyderabad last week.

Meanwhile Usman Khawaja produced his ninth score double-figure score below 30 
in a row when he was caught for 19. Coulter-Nile finished with figures of 0-21 
from his three overs.
