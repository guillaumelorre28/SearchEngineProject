As part of the Beveridge Revisited series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society-professionals/2014/jul/07/-sp-beveridge-report-revisited-where-now-for-the-welfare-state>
 we are revising Sir William Beveridge’s five giant evils for the 21st century. 
Want has become inequality, disease has become chronic health conditions; 
ignorance is now digital exclusion; and in modern Britain idleness is 
underemployment.


 But the last in the series, and the one evil that does not need updating 
after more than 70 years, is squalor. When Beveridge released the report on 
which the welfare state was based, Britain was plagued by slums and 
overcrowding. Post-war governments set about building houses; but more recently 
housebuilding has spluttered and by all accountsfailed to keep up with demand

.

The consequences are dire. Homelessness has risen for the third year in a row 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/dec/13/homeless-numbers-increase-three-years-england>
. Renters are forced toput up with infestations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2014/apr/08/renters-abandon-government-private-standards>
, cold and damp. Low income residents aresegregated with poor doors

; thousands of familieslive in temporary accomodation

. Benefit claimants arebeing demonised

.

As housing looks set to be one of the biggest 2015 election issues, tweets 
from these campaigners and experts will be ones to watch out for in the coming 
months. It’s certainly not a definitive list; please add your suggestions in 
the comments section.

Mary O’Hara (@maryohara1 <https://twitter.com/maryohara1>)


O’Hara is a social affairs journalist who writes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maryohara> about the impact of austerity 
on people with mental health conditions and other minority groups.


She has recently written Austerity Bites <http://www.austeritybitesuk.com/>, a 
book which dispels the notion that “we’re all in this together” and draws on 
first-person interviews, research and reports to record the true impact of 
austerity on the most vulnerable people.


She tweets about poverty, ill health and injustice, highlighting the real life 
stories of how people and families are coping with cuts.

“Mary O’Hara’s book strips away the rhetoric to reveal the truth. The United 
Kingdom is not the land of fairness, it’s a fearful place, where the heaviest 
burdens fall on the weakest.”


– Simon Duffy, Director of the Centre for Welfare Reform
