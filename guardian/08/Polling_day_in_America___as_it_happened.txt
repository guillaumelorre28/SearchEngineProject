The elections results roll in...

We’re opening up a brand-new liveblog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-live>
 for up-to-the-second updates on tonight’s election results, but before you 
jump to the latest returns, here were some of today’s highlights as tens of 
millions of Americans made their way to the polls:

 * Donald Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit in Nevada state court over the 
Clark County voter registrar’s decision to keep polling locations open “two 
hours beyond the designated closing time” to accommodate those who were forced 
to wait in line for hours to cast early-voting ballots.According to CNN 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/voting-polls-irregularities-election-2016/index.html>
, the Trump campaign’s legal team filed for relief in case “the election of 
presidential electors from the State of Nevada is contested.” 
 * “This action is to preserve the status quo so that, if the election of 
presidential electors from the State of Nevada is contested, the candidates and 
courts may redress egregious violations of Nevada election law perpetrated by 
the Registrar on November 4, 2016,” the lawsuit reads. “The Registrar’s 
violations were not random and neutral in their effect, but very much appear to 
have been intentionally coordinated with Democratic activists in order to skew 
the vote unlawfully in favor of Democratic candidates.” 
 * Hillary Clinton cast her historic vote for president at her home precinct 
in Chappaqua, New York, calling it “the most humbling feeling... because I know 
how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the 
outcome of this election, what it means for our country and I will do the very 
best I can if I’m fortunate enough to win today.”

 * Speaking on Fox & Friends by phone this morning - as is his custom - 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lashed out at pollsters who show 
him narrowly but consistently behind Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, alleging 
that most polls “just put out phony numbers”: 
I do think this, after the debates, I think my numbers really started to go up 
well. And then I did a series over the last two weeks, only of you know, really 
important speeches I think. 20,000, 25,000 people, 31,000 people were showing 
up to these speeches.”

Preliminary exit polling data is out and some of it reinforces the information 
we already had. Many voters have a negative view of the candidates - one in 
five Clinton voters said they chiefly oppose the other candidate, and 27% of 
Trump supporters said the same.

Crucially, turnout rates among Republicans, Democrats and Independents look 
like they’ll be comparable to 2012 based on this very early information. If 
current polling predictions hold true and turnout rates remain relatively 
consistent, that could work in Clinton’s favor.

About 90% Hispanic and on the border with Mexico, the Rio Grande Valley region 
of Texas was never going to be fertile ground for Donald Trump. Still, some of 
his small group of supporters tried to make their voices heardon Tuesday 
afternoon, as a few traded chants and barbs with a bigger group ofHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> backers across a 
busy road in the city of McAllen, Texas.

Sporting a red “Make America Great Again” baseball cap, Adrian Garza arrived 
in an SUV with “Hillary 4 Prison” scrawled in white paint on a window.

“I was born in Mexico, I know what he’s talking about. I was naturalized when 
Bill Clinton was president, I did it correctly,” said the 50-year-old truck 
driver. “I support Trump because I got his message at the beginning - a message 
of something being corrected in immigration. The law has not been enforced the 
way it should.”

Travelling around town, Garza said, his visible support of Trump has led to 
some strangers “yelling at me or even flipping the finger at me. I don’t mind. 
I’d love to talk to every single one of them so I could tell them why Trump is 
the right person.”

Garza said that Trump’s business acumen would help him follow through on his 
pledge to build a gigantic border wall and make Mexico pay for it. “I hope he 
wins. I’m praying that he does because it’s our last shot, like he says. If he 
doesn’t win, I think this country’s going to get worse. More terrorism will 
happen, jobs won’t come back,” he said.

Lalo Martinez wore a T-shirt with an image of Trump and the slogan “WASHINGTON 
DC YOU’RE FIRED”. The 42-year-old, while optimistic on a national level, was 
under no illusions about his favoured candidate’s local prospects. “Down here 
you could be the Pope and you would still lose if you’re Republican,” he said.

UPDATE: 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-results-live?page=with:block-58224dfee4b0199b93894dcc#block-58224dfee4b0199b93894dcc>
 A suit has just been filed with a superior court in North Carolina calling for 
an emergency order to force the state board of election to keep the Durham 
County polling places open until 9pm tonight. Voting has been severely 
disrupted there by a county-wide failure of voting machines, and the Southern 
Coalition for Social Justice that has brought the lawsuit says that polling 
times should be extended to make up for that.

If the suit is successful that could push back the outcome of the North 
Carolina vote which is hotly contested by Clinton and Trump late into the 
evening.

Local news stations are reporting that Colorado’s statewide voter registration 
systems are down. Colorado is a same-day registration state, which means that 
for those who are arriving at their polling stations with the intent to 
register and vote, they are being provided with provisional ballots.

Voting rights experts who are monitoring the election across the country are 
continuing to report a slew of problems, from long lines to faulty technology 
and sporadic reports of intimidation.

I’ve just spoken to Myrna Perez of the Brennan Center for Justice that is part 
of a coalition of groups working to protect the vote today. They run a hotline 
- 866-OUR-VOTE – which has received thousands of complaints from voters running 
into difficulties.

North Carolina, one of the most sensitive swing states that both Clinton and 
Trump have poured resources into winning, has been particularly troubled today 
by voting machines breaking down and electronic polling books seizing up. 
There’s no suggestion of foul play here, but it has complicated an already 
tense election day.

Texas is a story of more willful trouble. The Republican-controlled 
legislatures efforts to introduce one of the strictest forms of photo-ID 
requirements in the country has led to widespread confusion, Perez said.

The coalition has found numerous cases of signs being posted on the walls of 
polling stations that incorrectly inform voters about Texas’ photo-ID criteria.

Many complaints have come in about alleged intimidation of voters outside 
polling stations from a number of states. “We’ve certainly heard from voters 
complaining about this, though it’s going to be very hard to tell how organized 
it was. It’s too early to tell whether it was an individual action or something 
more planned.”

One development that Perez said would have to be reviewed after the dust has 
settled from this election was the proliferation of poll watchers. The 2016 
election cycle, given the degree of suspicion around, had spawned the surreal 
phenomenon of poll watchers observing voters and then poll monitors watching 
them.

“We are creating a culture of multiple layers of people observing each other, 
which produces it’s own challenges. We’ve got to a place where poll watchers 
watch watchers watching watchers.”

From the Guardian’s Sabrina Siddiqui, who is part of Hillary Clinton’s press 
pool tonight:

Clinton’s motorcade departed her home in Chappaqua at 4:48 p.m. en route to 
New York City. Your pooler did not spot Clinton, as we were already loaded in 
the vans and joined the motorcade as it was rolling.

We’re opening up a brand-new liveblog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-live>
 for up-to-the-second updates on tonight’s election results, but before you 
jump to the latest returns, here were some of today’s highlights as tens of 
millions of Americans made their way to the polls:

casting their ballots at a polling station in Chappaqua, New York. Photograph:

 * Donald Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit in Nevada state court over the 
Clark County voter registrar’s decision to keep polling locations open “two 
hours beyond the designated closing time” to accommodate those who were forced 
to wait in line for hours to cast early-voting ballots.According to CNN 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/voting-polls-irregularities-election-2016/index.html>
, the Trump campaign’s legal team filed for relief in case “the election of 
presidential electors from the State of Nevada is contested.” 
 * “This action is to preserve the status quo so that, if the election of 
presidential electors from the State of Nevada is contested, the candidates and 
courts may redress egregious violations of Nevada election law perpetrated by 
the Registrar on November 4, 2016,” the lawsuit reads. “The Registrar’s 
violations were not random and neutral in their effect, but very much appear to 
have been intentionally coordinated with Democratic activists in order to skew 
the vote unlawfully in favor of Democratic candidates.” 
 * Hillary Clinton cast her historic vote for president at her home precinct 
in Chappaqua, New York, calling it “the most humbling feeling... because I know 
how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the 
outcome of this election, what it means for our country and I will do the very 
best I can if I’m fortunate enough to win today.”

 * Speaking on Fox & Friends by phone this morning - as is his custom - 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lashed out at pollsters who show 
him narrowly but consistently behind Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, alleging 
that most polls “just put out phony numbers”: 
I do think this, after the debates, I think my numbers really started to go up 
well. And then I did a series over the last two weeks, only of you know, really 
important speeches I think. 20,000, 25,000 people, 31,000 people were showing 
up to these speeches.”

Preliminary exit polling data is out and some of it reinforces the information 
we already had. Many voters have a negative view of the candidates - one in 
five Clinton voters said they chiefly oppose the other candidate, and 27% of 
Trump supporters said the same.

Crucially, turnout rates among Republicans, Democrats and Independents look 
like they’ll be comparable to 2012 based on this very early information. If 
current polling predictions hold true and turnout rates remain relatively 
consistent, that could work in Clinton’s favor.

 
About 90% Hispanic and on the border with Mexico, the Rio Grande Valley region 
of Texas was never going to be fertile ground for Donald Trump. Still, some of 
his small group of supporters tried to make their voices heardon Tuesday 
afternoon, as a few traded chants and barbs with a bigger group ofHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> backers across a 
busy road in the city of McAllen, Texas.

Sporting a red “Make America Great Again” baseball cap, Adrian Garza arrived 
in an SUV with “Hillary 4 Prison” scrawled in white paint on a window.

“I was born in Mexico, I know what he’s talking about. I was naturalized when 
Bill Clinton was president, I did it correctly,” said the 50-year-old truck 
driver. “I support Trump because I got his message at the beginning - a message 
of something being corrected in immigration. The law has not been enforced the 
way it should.”

Travelling around town, Garza said, his visible support of Trump has led to 
some strangers “yelling at me or even flipping the finger at me. I don’t mind. 
I’d love to talk to every single one of them so I could tell them why Trump is 
the right person.”

Garza said that Trump’s business acumen would help him follow through on his 
pledge to build a gigantic border wall and make Mexico pay for it. “I hope he 
wins. I’m praying that he does because it’s our last shot, like he says. If he 
doesn’t win, I think this country’s going to get worse. More terrorism will 
happen, jobs won’t come back,” he said.

Lalo Martinez wore a T-shirt with an image of Trump and the slogan “WASHINGTON 
DC YOU’RE FIRED”. The 42-year-old, while optimistic on a national level, was 
under no illusions about his favoured candidate’s local prospects. “Down here 
you could be the Pope and you would still lose if you’re Republican,” he said.

 A suit has just been filed with a superior court in North Carolina calling for 
an emergency order to force the state board of election to keep the Durham 
County polling places open until 9pm tonight. Voting has been severely 
disrupted there by a county-wide failure of voting machines, and the Southern 
Coalition for Social Justice that has brought the lawsuit says that polling 
times should be extended to make up for that.

If the suit is successful that could push back the outcome of the North 
Carolina vote which is hotly contested by Clinton and Trump late into the 
evening.

for those who are arriving at their polling stations with the intent to 
register and vote, they are being provided with provisional ballots.

Voting rights experts who are monitoring the election across the country are 
continuing to report a slew of problems, from long lines to faulty technology 
and sporadic reports of intimidation.

I’ve just spoken to Myrna Perez of the Brennan Center for Justice that is part 
of a coalition of groups working to protect the vote today. They run a hotline 
- 866-OUR-VOTE – which has received thousands of complaints from voters running 
into difficulties.

North Carolina, one of the most sensitive swing states that both Clinton and 
Trump have poured resources into winning, has been particularly troubled today 
by voting machines breaking down and electronic polling books seizing up. 
There’s no suggestion of foul play here, but it has complicated an already 
tense election day.

Texas is a story of more willful trouble. The Republican-controlled 
legislatures efforts to introduce one of the strictest forms of photo-ID 
requirements in the country has led to widespread confusion, Perez said.

The coalition has found numerous cases of signs being posted on the walls of 
polling stations that incorrectly inform voters about Texas’ photo-ID criteria.

Many complaints have come in about alleged intimidation of voters outside 
polling stations from a number of states. “We’ve certainly heard from voters 
complaining about this, though it’s going to be very hard to tell how organized 
it was. It’s too early to tell whether it was an individual action or something 
more planned.”

One development that Perez said would have to be reviewed after the dust has 
settled from this election was the proliferation of poll watchers. The 2016 
election cycle, given the degree of suspicion around, had spawned the surreal 
phenomenon of poll watchers observing voters and then poll monitors watching 
them.

“We are creating a culture of multiple layers of people observing each other, 
which produces it’s own challenges. We’ve got to a place where poll watchers 
watch watchers watching watchers.”
