Today in Campaign 2016

 * Hillary Clinton today disparaged her Republican rival as a tool of the 
racist, radical right 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/hillary-clinton-alt-right-racism-speech-donald-trump-nevada>
, a man who foments “paranoia and prejudice” and ushers hate groups into the 
mainstream. Donald Trump is “a man with a long history of racial 
discrimination”, Clinton said during a rally in the flag-festooned student 
center at Truckee Meadows Community College. He is a man “who traffics in dark 
conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far 
reaches of the internet”. Positioning herself as the true representative of a 
tolerant and open-minded United States, Clinton derided the real estate mogul 
as a darling of the “alt-right” and a soulmate of David Duke, a former grand 
wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. 
 * Trump, trailing badly in the polls, has moved aggressively to capture 
non-white voters. The Republican nominee met African American and Latino 
activists at Trump Tower in New York this morning, after moderating his stance 
on immigration and including in his stump speech a sales pitch for African 
American voters: “What do you have to lose? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/what-do-you-have-to-lose-donald-trump-appeals-for-black-vote>
” “We have great relationships and the numbers are going up with the African 
American community rapidly,” Trump said at the meeting, which included retired 
neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate Ben Carson and members of the 
Republican leadership initiative to develop conservative minority leaders. 
 * Trump told host Anderson Cooper that the “softening” of his immigration 
plan does not include a path to legalization - “unless people leave the 
country” and pay back taxes. “No, there’s not a path to legalization unless 
people leave the country,” Trump told Cooper, in remarks set to air at 8pm ET. 
“If they come back in and then they have to start paying taxes, but there is no 
path to legalization unless they leave the country and come back.” 
 * Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN on Tuesday that there 
would be no “touchback” policy in Trump’s future - that is, undocumented 
immigrants leaving the country for their nation of origin before entering the 
United States legally.Trump also doubled down on remarks he made last night, 
calling rival Hillary Clinton a “bigot” who only views African Americans as 
votes to be won. 
 * “She is a bigot,” Trump said. “If you look at what’s happening to the inner 
cities, you look at what’s happening to African Americans and Hispanics in this 
country where she talks all the time. She talking - look at the vets, where she 
said the vets are being treated essentially just fine that it’s 
over-exaggerated what’s happening to the vets not so long ago.”

Trump campaign CEO once charged with domestic violence

Stephen Bannon, the newly appointed CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential 
campaign, was once charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery and 
dissuading a witness, according to court documentsobtained by Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/steve-bannon-domestic-violence-case-police-report-227432>
.

The report, filed in 1996 in Santa Monica, California, says that Bannon pulled 
at the neck and wrist of his then-wife during an argument over the couple’s 
finances, threatening to “take [their twin daughters] and leave.” A police 
officer reported seeing red marks on Bannon’s then-wife’s neck and arm after 
the alleged attack on New Year’s Day.

The New York Post, which also obtained the divorce documents 
<http://nypost.com/2016/08/25/trump-campaign-ceo-accused-in-divorce-papers-of-attacking-wife/>
 in which the attack is alleged, quotes Bannon’s ex-wife as saying: “I took the 
phone to call the police and he grabbed the phone away from me throwing it 
across the room, and breaking it as he [was] screaming that I was a ‘crazy 
f—ing c–t!”

The case was closed after Bannon’s ex-wife failed to appear in court to 
testify to the accusations, although she stated in the couple’s divorce papers 
that Bannon threatened her into not testifying, telling her that she would 
“would have no money [and] no way to support the children” if she did so.

“He also told me that if I went to court he and his attorney would make sure 
that I would be the one who was guilty,” the ex-wife’s divorce papers stated. 
“I was told that I could go anywhere in the world.”

Bannon pleaded “not guilty” to the allegations, and his spokeswoman told 
Politico that “he has a great relationship with the ex-wife.”

Until his selection as Trump’s campaign CEO, Bannon served as the executive 
chair of Breitbart News’ parent company.

Donald Trump on the alt-right: 'I don't even know what that is'

Despite his campaign CEO declaring his media organization the voice of the 
alt-right,Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told 
Anderson Cooper in an interview airing now on CNN that he doesn’t know what the 
term means.

“Nobody even knows what it is - she didn’t even know,” Trump said of opponent 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, whose 
address earlier today castigated him for his relationship with conspiracists 
and internet racists. “I don’t know what Steve said - I can only speak for 
myself.”

On a series of lawsuits from the Justice Department in the 1970s that accused 
his company of discriminating against black tenants, Trump was dismissive, and 
declared that he did not pay a dime in fines for refusing to rent apartments to 
African-Americans.

“We were sued many, many years ago, when I was very young, the federal 
government sued many, many companies,” Trump said. “They found nothing - they 
found absolutely nothing. I settled. I settled with no rewards or nothing.”


“They settled the case and that was the end of it,” Trump said. “It was a long 
time ago, but I don’t believe” that the Trump Organization paid any fines.

Donald Trump: 'You know it’s a process - you can’t take 11 million at one time'

In a conversation with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told the anchor 
that the deportation of the estimated 11m undocumented immigrants currently 
living in the United States is “a process,” but denied that his recent muddying 
of his immigration policy amounts to “legalization.”

“We are gonna build a great wall, the wall is gonna be paid for by Mexico,” 
Trump said, when asked about his immigration policy shift. “We’re gonna have 
tunnel technology ... people will not come into our country illegally - we’re 
gonna fix that.”

The “bad ones,” Trump said, will be deported from the country as his first act 
as president.

“They’re out, they’re out. The police know who they are - I’ve spoken to many 
police. The police know who they are,” Trump said. “We’re going to end 
sanctuary cities.”

“After that, we’re going to see what happens, but we’re going to find people,” 
Trump said. “The first document I will sign will say get the bad ones out of 
this country - get them back to where they came from.”

“You know it’s a process - you can’t take 11 [million] at one time and say 
boom you’re done,” Trump continued. “We know the bad ones - we know where they 
are, who they are, we know the drug cartel people, we know the gangs... those 
people are gone.”

When asked how his newfound embrace of allowing undocumented immigrants to pay 
back taxes stacks against the platform of former rival Jeb Bush, whose stance 
on immigration led Trump to dismiss it as “amnesty,” Trump was dismissive.

“Jeb Bush wasn’t building a wall, Jeb Bush wasn’t making strong borders.”

“First I wanna see what’s going to happen - we;re going to deport many people, 
many, many people,” Trump said. “There is no path to legalization unless they 
leave the country and then they come back.”

“We’re going to see what happens once we strengthen up our border.”

Arizona senator John McCain’s Republican challenger, former state senator 
Kelli Ward, has criticized her opponent as too old for the job.

“John McCain is falling down on the job, he’s gotten weak and he’s gotten old. 
I do want to wish him a happy birthday, he’s going to be 80 on Monday. And I 
want to give him the best birthday present ever, the gift of retirement,” 
former Arizona Ward told MSNBC Chuck Todd,according to the Hill 
<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/293398-mccains-primary-opponent-takes-shot-at-his-age>
.

“I’m a physician, I see the physiological changes that happen in normal aging 
in patients again and again and again over the last 25 years. I do know what 
happens to the body and the mind at the end of life.”

Asked if she felt comfortable diagnosing a man she had never met, Ward said: 
“Diagnosing him as an 80-year-old man? Yes, I do.”

Video: Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of embracing a brand of US 
political conservatism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/hillary-clinton-alt-right-racism-speech-donald-trump-nevada>
 associated with white nationalism and nativism during a Nevada campaign stop 
earlier today.
‘Alt-right’ effectively merged with Trump’s campaign, Clinton says 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/25/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-alt-right-video>
She cited Trump’s decision to bring on Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon 
as his new campaign chief as a sign Trump is strengthening his ties to the 
“alt-right” movement.

Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump’s latest campaign manager, has issued a 
statement in response to Hillary Clinton’s speech on Trump’s connections to the 
so-called “alt-right”:

Today proved to the American public what we have known all along - Hillary 
Clinton has no hope, no vision and no ideas for the future of our country. 
Clinton lied about her emails, she lied about Colin Powell, and today she lied 
about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is talking about issues;Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is talking about Donald 
Trump. Today, she she took a break from her Hillary-in-Hiding Tour, she missed 
another opportunity to talk about education, infrastructure, terrorism, 
healthcare, the economy and energy. We’re living in her head rent-free, and 
that must terrify the political insiders who want to keep things exactly they 
way they are.

Donald Trump continues to muddy immigration stance

In a preview of remarks to be made tonight on CNN’s AC360, Republican 
presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told host Anderson Cooper 
that the “softening” of his immigration plan does not include a path to 
legalization - “unless people leave the country” and pay back taxes.

“No, there’s not a path to legalization unless people leave the country,” 
Trump told Cooper, in remarks set to air at 8pm ET. “If they come back in and 
then they have to start paying taxes, but there is no path to legalization 
unless they leave the country and come back.”

Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN on Tuesday that there would 
be no “touchback” policy in Trump’s future - that is, undocumented immigrants 
leaving the country for their nation of origin before entering the United 
States legally.

Trump also doubled down on remarks he made last night, calling rival Hillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> a “bigot” who 
only views African Americans as votes to be won.

“She is a bigot,” Trump said. “If you look at what’s happening to the inner 
cities, you look at what’s happening to African Americans and Hispanics in this 
country where she talks all the time. She talking - look at the vets, where she 
said the vets are being treated essentially just fine that it’s 
over-exaggerated what’s happening to the vets not so long ago.”

Asked to elaborate - Trump’s definition of bigotry appears to be different 
than Cooper’s - Trump said that Clinton is bigoted because “she is selling them 
down the tubes because she’s not doing anything for those communities. She 
talks a good game. But she doesn’t do anything.”

Asked whether Clinton is personally bigoted, Trump said yes.

“Oh, she is,” Trump said. “Of course she is. Her policies. They’re her 
policies, she comes out with the policies and others that believe like she does 
also but she came out with policies over the years. This is over the years. 
Long time. She’s totally bigoted, there’s no question about that.”

 * Hillary Clinton today disparaged her Republican rival as a tool of the 
racist, radical right 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/hillary-clinton-alt-right-racism-speech-donald-trump-nevada>
, a man who foments “paranoia and prejudice” and ushers hate groups into the 
mainstream. Donald Trump is “a man with a long history of racial 
discrimination”, Clinton said during a rally in the flag-festooned student 
center at Truckee Meadows Community College. He is a man “who traffics in dark 
conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far 
reaches of the internet”. Positioning herself as the true representative of a 
tolerant and open-minded United States, Clinton derided the real estate mogul 
as a darling of the “alt-right” and a soulmate of David Duke, a former grand 
wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. 
 * Trump, trailing badly in the polls, has moved aggressively to capture 
non-white voters. The Republican nominee met African American and Latino 
activists at Trump Tower in New York this morning, after moderating his stance 
on immigration and including in his stump speech a sales pitch for African 
American voters: “What do you have to lose? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/what-do-you-have-to-lose-donald-trump-appeals-for-black-vote>
” “We have great relationships and the numbers are going up with the African 
American community rapidly,” Trump said at the meeting, which included retired 
neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate Ben Carson and members of the 
Republican leadership initiative to develop conservative minority leaders. 
 * Trump told host Anderson Cooper that the “softening” of his immigration 
plan does not include a path to legalization - “unless people leave the 
country” and pay back taxes. “No, there’s not a path to legalization unless 
people leave the country,” Trump told Cooper, in remarks set to air at 8pm ET. 
“If they come back in and then they have to start paying taxes, but there is no 
path to legalization unless they leave the country and come back.” 
 * Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN on Tuesday that there 
would be no “touchback” policy in Trump’s future - that is, undocumented 
immigrants leaving the country for their nation of origin before entering the 
United States legally.Trump also doubled down on remarks he made last night, 
calling rival Hillary Clinton a “bigot” who only views African Americans as 
votes to be won. 
 * “She is a bigot,” Trump said. “If you look at what’s happening to the inner 
cities, you look at what’s happening to African Americans and Hispanics in this 
country where she talks all the time. She talking - look at the vets, where she 
said the vets are being treated essentially just fine that it’s 
over-exaggerated what’s happening to the vets not so long ago.”

Stephen Bannon, the newly appointed CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential 
campaign, was once charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery and 
dissuading a witness, according to court documentsobtained by Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/steve-bannon-domestic-violence-case-police-report-227432>
.

The report, filed in 1996 in Santa Monica, California, says that Bannon pulled 
at the neck and wrist of his then-wife during an argument over the couple’s 
finances, threatening to “take [their twin daughters] and leave.” A police 
officer reported seeing red marks on Bannon’s then-wife’s neck and arm after 
the alleged attack on New Year’s Day.

The New York Post, which also obtained the divorce documents 
<http://nypost.com/2016/08/25/trump-campaign-ceo-accused-in-divorce-papers-of-attacking-wife/>
 in which the attack is alleged, quotes Bannon’s ex-wife as saying: “I took the 
phone to call the police and he grabbed the phone away from me throwing it 
across the room, and breaking it as he [was] screaming that I was a ‘crazy 
f—ing c–t!”

The case was closed after Bannon’s ex-wife failed to appear in court to 
testify to the accusations, although she stated in the couple’s divorce papers 
that Bannon threatened her into not testifying, telling her that she would 
“would have no money [and] no way to support the children” if she did so.

“He also told me that if I went to court he and his attorney would make sure 
that I would be the one who was guilty,” the ex-wife’s divorce papers stated. 
“I was told that I could go anywhere in the world.”

Bannon pleaded “not guilty” to the allegations, and his spokeswoman told 
Politico that “he has a great relationship with the ex-wife.”

Until his selection as Trump’s campaign CEO, Bannon served as the executive 
chair of Breitbart News’ parent company.
 
Despite his campaign CEO declaring his media organization the voice of the 
alt-right,Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told 
Anderson Cooper in an interview airing now on CNN that he doesn’t know what the 
term means.

“Nobody even knows what it is - she didn’t even know,” Trump said of opponent 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, whose 
address earlier today castigated him for his relationship with conspiracists 
and internet racists. “I don’t know what Steve said - I can only speak for 
myself.”

On a series of lawsuits from the Justice Department in the 1970s that accused 
his company of discriminating against black tenants, Trump was dismissive, and 
declared that he did not pay a dime in fines for refusing to rent apartments to 
African-Americans.

“We were sued many, many years ago, when I was very young, the federal 
government sued many, many companies,” Trump said. “They found nothing - they 
found absolutely nothing. I settled. I settled with no rewards or nothing.”


“They settled the case and that was the end of it,” Trump said. “It was a long 
time ago, but I don’t believe” that the Trump Organization paid any fines.
 
Donald Trump: “I think we’re going to do very well with African-Americans.”

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> should 
be in jail. You know it, the director of the FBI knows it - she should be in 
jail.
 
In a conversation with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told the anchor 
that the deportation of the estimated 11m undocumented immigrants currently 
living in the United States is “a process,” but denied that his recent muddying 
of his immigration policy amounts to “legalization.”

“We are gonna build a great wall, the wall is gonna be paid for by Mexico,” 
Trump said, when asked about his immigration policy shift. “We’re gonna have 
tunnel technology ... people will not come into our country illegally - we’re 
gonna fix that.”

The “bad ones,” Trump said, will be deported from the country as his first act 
as president.

“They’re out, they’re out. The police know who they are - I’ve spoken to many 
police. The police know who they are,” Trump said. “We’re going to end 
sanctuary cities.”

“After that, we’re going to see what happens, but we’re going to find people,” 
Trump said. “The first document I will sign will say get the bad ones out of 
this country - get them back to where they came from.”

“You know it’s a process - you can’t take 11 [million] at one time and say 
boom you’re done,” Trump continued. “We know the bad ones - we know where they 
are, who they are, we know the drug cartel people, we know the gangs... those 
people are gone.”

When asked how his newfound embrace of allowing undocumented immigrants to pay 
back taxes stacks against the platform of former rival Jeb Bush, whose stance 
on immigration led Trump to dismiss it as “amnesty,” Trump was dismissive.

“Jeb Bush wasn’t building a wall, Jeb Bush wasn’t making strong borders.”

“First I wanna see what’s going to happen - we;re going to deport many people, 
many, many people,” Trump said. “There is no path to legalization unless they 
leave the country and then they come back.”

“We’re going to see what happens once we strengthen up our border.”
 
Arizona senator John McCain’s Republican challenger, former state senator 
Kelli Ward, has criticized her opponent as too old for the job.

“John McCain is falling down on the job, he’s gotten weak and he’s gotten old. 
I do want to wish him a happy birthday, he’s going to be 80 on Monday. And I 
want to give him the best birthday present ever, the gift of retirement,” 
former Arizona Ward told MSNBC Chuck Todd,according to the Hill 
<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/293398-mccains-primary-opponent-takes-shot-at-his-age>
.

“I’m a physician, I see the physiological changes that happen in normal aging 
in patients again and again and again over the last 25 years. I do know what 
happens to the body and the mind at the end of life.”

Asked if she felt comfortable diagnosing a man she had never met, Ward said: 
“Diagnosing him as an 80-year-old man? Yes, I do.”
 
Video: Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of embracing a brand of US 
political conservatism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/hillary-clinton-alt-right-racism-speech-donald-trump-nevada>
 associated with white nationalism and nativism during a Nevada campaign stop 
earlier today.
‘Alt-right’ effectively merged with Trump’s campaign, Clinton says 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/25/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-alt-right-video>
She cited Trump’s decision to bring on Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon 
as his new campaign chief as a sign Trump is strengthening his ties to the 
“alt-right” movement.
 
Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump’s latest campaign manager, has issued a 
statement in response to Hillary Clinton’s speech on Trump’s connections to the 
so-called “alt-right”:

Today proved to the American public what we have known all along - Hillary 
Clinton has no hope, no vision and no ideas for the future of our country. 
Clinton lied about her emails, she lied about Colin Powell, and today she lied 
about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is talking about issues;Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is talking about Donald 
Trump. Today, she she took a break from her Hillary-in-Hiding Tour, she missed 
another opportunity to talk about education, infrastructure, terrorism, 
healthcare, the economy and energy. We’re living in her head rent-free, and 
that must terrify the political insiders who want to keep things exactly they 
way they are.
 
In a preview of remarks to be made tonight on CNN’s AC360, Republican 
presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told host Anderson Cooper 
that the “softening” of his immigration plan does not include a path to 
legalization - “unless people leave the country” and pay back taxes.

“No, there’s not a path to legalization unless people leave the country,” 
Trump told Cooper, in remarks set to air at 8pm ET. “If they come back in and 
then they have to start paying taxes, but there is no path to legalization 
unless they leave the country and come back.”

Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN on Tuesday that there would 
be no “touchback” policy in Trump’s future - that is, undocumented immigrants 
leaving the country for their nation of origin before entering the United 
States legally.

Trump also doubled down on remarks he made last night, calling rival Hillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> a “bigot” who 
only views African Americans as votes to be won.

“She is a bigot,” Trump said. “If you look at what’s happening to the inner 
cities, you look at what’s happening to African Americans and Hispanics in this 
country where she talks all the time. She talking - look at the vets, where she 
said the vets are being treated essentially just fine that it’s 
over-exaggerated what’s happening to the vets not so long ago.”

Asked to elaborate - Trump’s definition of bigotry appears to be different 
than Cooper’s - Trump said that Clinton is bigoted because “she is selling them 
down the tubes because she’s not doing anything for those communities. She 
talks a good game. But she doesn’t do anything.”

Asked whether Clinton is personally bigoted, Trump said yes.

“Oh, she is,” Trump said. “Of course she is. Her policies. They’re her 
policies, she comes out with the policies and others that believe like she does 
also but she came out with policies over the years. This is over the years. 
Long time. She’s totally bigoted, there’s no question about that.”
