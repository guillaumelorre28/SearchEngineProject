FBI turns over Clinton interview materials to Congress – report

The FBI has turned over material to a Republican-led congressional committee 
investigating Hillary Clinton’s use of private emails while secretary of state, 
the Washington Post reports.

The material is believed to include notes on an interview FBI agents conducted 
with Clinton about her email hygiene. FBI director James Comey told Congress 
earlier this summer that the interview with Clinton was not recorded.

The FBI has handed over a “number of documents” to the House Oversight and 
Government Reform Committee, a spokesmantold 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/08/16/hillary-clinton-interviews-by-fbi-have-been-delivered-to-congress/?postshare=5671471372946414&tid=ss_tw>
 the Post Tuesday afternoon.

The Post quotes a committee spokesman: 

The FBI has turned over a ‘number of documents’ related to their investigation 
of former Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email server. Committee staff 
is currently reviewing the information that is classified SECRET. There are no 
further details at this time.
Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) 
Clinton aide says campaign would prefer to see FBI interview reports released 
to the public in full as opposed to piecemeal.

State polls look good for Clinton

This morning the Washington Post delivered a poll showing Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> leading Donald Trump 
among likely voters in Virginia by 8 points, a margin in line with polling 
averages.

Meanwhile, Monmouth has released a poll of Florida likely voters showing 
Clinton up by 9 points:

BREAKING: Florida likely voters

Polling averages have Clinton ahead 
<http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-florida-presidential-general-election-trump-vs-clinton>
 by only three or four points in Florida.

A Public Policy Polling survey of Texas, meanwhile, finds Trump ahead by only 
six points, in a four-way race. Mitt Romney won the state, which has not voted 
Democratic in a presidential election in 40 years, by 16 points in 2012:

Trump to attend Iowa 'Roast and Ride'

Donald Trump will appear at an event hosted by Iowa senator Joni Ernst later 
this month, in an effort to swing a state where polling averages show a tight
two-point race 
<http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-president-trump-vs-clinton>
.

“The Roast and Ride is a great event to honor our veterans, celebrate the best 
of Iowa, and hear from our Republican candidates and leaders about a better way 
forward for our nation,” Ernst said in a statement. “Iowa will play an 
important role in 2016, and I look forward to rallying together with fellow 
Iowans to hear from this exciting lineup of speakers about ways to ensure 
America is always a strong, stabilizing force around the globe.”

Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks has told The Hollywood Reporter that the 
Times andNY Magazine <https://twitter.com/gabrielsherman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw> 
reports that Roger Ailes is advising Donald Trump are wrong.

He is not advising Mr. Trump or helping with debate prep. They are longtime 
friends, but he has no formal or informal role in the campaign.

Ailes helping with Trump debate prep – report

Donald Trump has said 
<http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-best-for-women> he “would 
be the best for women” if elected president. On the other hand, the New York 
Timesreports 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/us/politics/donald-trump-roger-ailes.html>, 
his campaign has just recruited Roger Ailes, the media maestro whoresigned from 
Fox News 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims>
 last month followingallegations that he sexually harassed numerous subordinates
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-fox-news-ideology-conservative-baby-boomers>
.
Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) 
Important context is that Ailes has been advising Trump privately for months, 
sources close to both say.
 <https://twitter.com/gabrielsherman/status/765587195516289024> August 16, 2016
 <https://twitter.com/gabrielsherman/status/765587195516289024> 
For starters, Ailes is going to help Trump prepare for the debates, the Times 
reports:

Mr. Ailes is aiding Mr. Trump’s team as it turns its attention to the first 
debate withHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>
, the Democratic nominee, on Sept. 26 on Long Island, according to three people 
briefed on the move, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized 
to discuss the matter.

Ailes, a former top aide to Richard Nixon, has helped past presidents prepare 
for debates including Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush.
AmanaFontanella-Khan (@AmanaFK) 
Trump hiring Ailes is no surprise. He helped create conditions for his rise & 
is best man to deliver first-class spin Trump needs to rebound

Josh Holmes is the former chief of staff and campaign manager of the current 
(Republican) senate majority leader.

In the tweet below he refers to the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is “running for president” in 
collusion with the Clintons/Democrats as opposed to against the 
Clintons/Democrats.

The theory imagines a deal between Trump and the Clintons in which the plan 
was for him to win the Republican nomination and then throw the general 
election toHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>
. (Note: The theory rests very shakily on the notion that the conspirators 
would have thought that Donald Trump had a chance at winning the Republican 
presidential nomination.)

How Trump's campaign chief got a strongman elected president of Ukraine

The Guardian’s Luke Harding met Paul Manafort in 2007, a couple years after 
the current Trump campaign chairman had set up “an anonymous office at number 4 
Sophia Street in Kiev” to restore the party of future Ukrainian president 
Viktor Yanukovich to power.

“Close up, Manafort looked every inch the classic Washington lobbyist,” Luke 
writes:

He wore an expensive suit and tie and exuded seriousness. He also bore a faint 
physical resemblance to his client – even their hairstyles were similar. 
(Manafort, I was told later, had instructed Yanukovich to blow-dry his hair. 
Manafort’s camp denies this.)

The American had an interesting story to tell – one which may sound familiar 
to observers of Donald Trump’s campaign – of how his candidate had been almost 
wilfully misunderstood by the west, especially by its media.

The new Yanukovich was nothing like the old one, Manafort suggested. He had 
absorbed the lessons of his previous defeats, was studying English – and was 
even playing tennis with the US ambassador.

“People are still looking at the political system in this country through the 
prism of 2004,” Manafort told me. “That’s not at all the situation here.”

Cleveland last month. Photograph: Brian Snyder / Reuters/Reuters 
But after Yanukovich claimed the presidency in 2010, he “moved quickly to 
consolidate all instruments of power,” Luke writes:

Those who worked with Manafort say that he cannot be blamed for the Ukrainian 
disaster. Oleg Voloshin, a former aide to Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, Yanukovich’s 
2010-12 foreign minister who now works as a political consultant, says Manafort 
urged Yanukovich to press ahead with the EU integration agenda.

Voloshin still has ties with the ex-Party of Regions, which Manafort rebranded 
in 2014 as the Opposition Bloc. (Manafort’s consultancy in Ukraine continued 
until at least parliamentary elections in 2014.)

He suggests that Yanukovich “listened to what Paul said” between 2007-2010, 
but then, once he became president, stopped listening – with catastrophic 
results. [...]

But Manafort’s critics in Kiev are scathing. “He’s an evil genius,” Alex 
Kovzhun, who spent a decade working for [former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia] 
Tymoshenko, beginning in 2001, said. “He doesn’t work statesmen. He works 
dictators and all-round bastards. He sells the unsellable product. If you have 
a dead horse and you need to sell it, you call him.”

“He works bad guys. They pay more, of course.”

Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White 
House. Donald Trump is scheduled to travel today to restive Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, where the policekilling of Sylville Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/milwaukee-curfew-police-shooting-sylville-smith>
 on Saturday has sparked protests. Trump will participate in a town hall hosted 
this evening by Fox News. The Guardian’s Oliver Laughland will be on the scene.

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is 
campaigning in Pennsylvania today. The Guardian’s Sabrina Siddiqui will be with 
the candidate, including at a voter registration event in Philadelphia this 
afternoon.

Blame it on Kaine?

A new Washington Post poll 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/trump-unpopularity-fuels-wide-lead-for-clinton-in-new-virginia-poll/2016/08/15/ea0e1540-6307-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html>
 of Virginia voters holds good news for Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine, the 
commonwealth’s former governor and junior US senator. Clinton is up 14 points 
on Trump among registered voters in the poll, and up eight points among likely 
voters. The second margin is on the button with polling averages. Clinton leads 
Trump by seven points in a four-person race, according to the poll. Virginia is 
theoretically a swing state.

Nevermind Virginia. Last night Kaine had moved on to North Carolina:

<https://twitter.com/thomaskaplan/status/765375957867728896> 
Particularly worrisome for Trump in the poll might be his mere 24-point lead 
among non-college-educated white voters:

Clinton names transition team

Clinton’s campaign on Tuesday named a leadership line-up for her transition 
team, which will prepare the way should she win the November election, Reuters
reports 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-transition-idUSKCN10R11X?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social>
:

Ken Salazar, previously both a secretary of the interior and a Colorado 
senator, will chair the team ... the team will include four co-chairs, 
according to a statement: former National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, former 
Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, president of the Center for American 
Progress Neera Tanden, and Maggie Williams, director of Harvard’s Institute of 
Politics.

The FBI has turned over material to a Republican-led congressional committee 
investigating Hillary Clinton’s use of private emails while secretary of state, 
the Washington Post reports.

The material is believed to include notes on an interview FBI agents conducted 
with Clinton about her email hygiene. FBI director James Comey told Congress 
earlier this summer that the interview with Clinton was not recorded.

The FBI has handed over a “number of documents” to the House Oversight and 
Government Reform Committee, a spokesmantold 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/08/16/hillary-clinton-interviews-by-fbi-have-been-delivered-to-congress/?postshare=5671471372946414&tid=ss_tw>
 the Post Tuesday afternoon.

The Post quotes a committee spokesman: 

The FBI has turned over a ‘number of documents’ related to their investigation 
of former Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email server. Committee staff 
is currently reviewing the information that is classified SECRET. There are no 
further details at this time.

This morning the Washington Post delivered a poll showing Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> leading Donald Trump 
among likely voters in Virginia by 8 points, a margin in line with polling 
averages.

Meanwhile, Monmouth has released a poll of Florida likely voters showing 
Clinton up by 9 points:

Polling averages have Clinton ahead

A Public Policy Polling survey of Texas, meanwhile, finds Trump ahead by only 
six points, in a four-way race. Mitt Romney won the state, which has not voted 
Democratic in a presidential election in 40 years, by 16 points in 2012:

Donald Trump will appear at an event hosted by Iowa senator Joni Ernst later 
this month, in an effort to swing a state where polling averages show a tight
two-point race 
<http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-president-trump-vs-clinton>
.

“The Roast and Ride is a great event to honor our veterans, celebrate the best 
of Iowa, and hear from our Republican candidates and leaders about a better way 
forward for our nation,” Ernst said in a statement. “Iowa will play an 
important role in 2016, and I look forward to rallying together with fellow 
Iowans to hear from this exciting lineup of speakers about ways to ensure 
America is always a strong, stabilizing force around the globe.”

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is

Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks has told The Hollywood Reporter that the 
Times andNY Magazine <https://twitter.com/gabrielsherman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw> 
reports that Roger Ailes is advising Donald Trump are wrong.

THR quotes Hicks as saying of Ailes:

He is not advising Mr. Trump or helping with debate prep. They are longtime 
friends, but he has no formal or informal role in the campaign.

Donald Trump has said 
<http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-best-for-women> he “would

<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/us/politics/donald-trump-roger-ailes.html>, 
his campaign has just recruited Roger Ailes, the media maestro whoresigned from

For starters, Ailes is going to help Trump prepare for the debates, the Times 
reports:

Mr. Ailes is aiding Mr. Trump’s team as it turns its attention to the first 
debate withHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>
, the Democratic nominee, on Sept. 26 on Long Island, according to three people 
briefed on the move, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized 
to discuss the matter.

Ailes, a former top aide to Richard Nixon, has helped past presidents prepare 
for debates including Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush.

Josh Holmes is the former chief of staff and campaign manager of the current 
(Republican) senate majority leader.

In the tweet below he refers to the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is “running for president” in 
collusion with the Clintons/Democrats as opposed to against the 
Clintons/Democrats.

The theory imagines a deal between Trump and the Clintons in which the plan 
was for him to win the Republican nomination and then throw the general 
election toHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>
. (Note: The theory rests very shakily on the notion that the conspirators 
would have thought that Donald Trump had a chance at winning the Republican 
presidential nomination.)

The Guardian’s Luke Harding met Paul Manafort in 2007, a couple years after 
the current Trump campaign chairman had set up “an anonymous office at number 4 
Sophia Street in Kiev” to restore the party of future Ukrainian president 
Viktor Yanukovich to power.

“Close up, Manafort looked every inch the classic Washington lobbyist,” Luke 
writes:

He wore an expensive suit and tie and exuded seriousness. He also bore a faint 
physical resemblance to his client – even their hairstyles were similar. 
(Manafort, I was told later, had instructed Yanukovich to blow-dry his hair. 
Manafort’s camp denies this.)

The American had an interesting story to tell – one which may sound familiar 
to observers of Donald Trump’s campaign – of how his candidate had been almost 
wilfully misunderstood by the west, especially by its media.

The new Yanukovich was nothing like the old one, Manafort suggested. He had 
absorbed the lessons of his previous defeats, was studying English – and was 
even playing tennis with the US ambassador.

“People are still looking at the political system in this country through the 
prism of 2004,” Manafort told me. “That’s not at all the situation here.”

Cleveland last month. Photograph: Brian Snyder / Reuters/Reuters 
But after Yanukovich claimed the presidency in 2010, he “moved quickly to 
consolidate all instruments of power,” Luke writes:

Those who worked with Manafort say that he cannot be blamed for the Ukrainian 
disaster. Oleg Voloshin, a former aide to Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, Yanukovich’s 
2010-12 foreign minister who now works as a political consultant, says Manafort 
urged Yanukovich to press ahead with the EU integration agenda.

Voloshin still has ties with the ex-Party of Regions, which Manafort rebranded 
in 2014 as the Opposition Bloc. (Manafort’s consultancy in Ukraine continued 
until at least parliamentary elections in 2014.)

He suggests that Yanukovich “listened to what Paul said” between 2007-2010, 
but then, once he became president, stopped listening – with catastrophic 
results. [...]

But Manafort’s critics in Kiev are scathing. “He’s an evil genius,” Alex 
Kovzhun, who spent a decade working for [former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia] 
Tymoshenko, beginning in 2001, said. “He doesn’t work statesmen. He works 
dictators and all-round bastards. He sells the unsellable product. If you have 
a dead horse and you need to sell it, you call him.”

“He works bad guys. They pay more, of course.”

Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White 
House. Donald Trump is scheduled to travel today to restive Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, where the policekilling of Sylville Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/milwaukee-curfew-police-shooting-sylville-smith>

Blame it on Kaine?

A new Washington Post poll 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/trump-unpopularity-fuels-wide-lead-for-clinton-in-new-virginia-poll/2016/08/15/ea0e1540-6307-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html>
 of Virginia voters holds good news for Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine, the 
commonwealth’s former governor and junior US senator. Clinton is up 14 points 
on Trump among registered voters in the poll, and up eight points among likely 
voters. The second margin is on the button with polling averages. Clinton leads 
Trump by seven points in a four-person race, according to the poll. Virginia is 
theoretically a swing state.

Nevermind Virginia. Last night Kaine had moved on to North Carolina:
