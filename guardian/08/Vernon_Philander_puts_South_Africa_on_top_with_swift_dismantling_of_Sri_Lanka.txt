South Africa’s pace bowlers put them in charge of the first Test as Sri Lanka 
struggled to 181 for seven on day two in Port Elizabeth, still 105 runs behind 
the hosts’ 286.

Sri Lanka wrapped up South Africa’s first innings swiftly in the morning, 
taking the remaining four wickets for 19 runs with the seamer Suranga Lakmal 
claiming his first five‑wicket haul in Test cricket.

However, Sri Lanka’s batsmen did not capitalise on their bowlers’ good work as 
Vernon Philander and Kyle Abbott struck early to leave them on 22 for three 
after eight overs.

Angelo Mathews offered some resistance with the captain scoring 39, Dinesh 
Chandimal added 28 and Dhananjaya de Silva prevented a complete collapse. De 
Silva was 43 not out when bad light stopped play early.

Mathews’ innings was patient while De Silva, batting at seven, was dropped on 
27 and went on to hit five boundaries in 69 balls.

Sri Lanka have won only one of their past seven Test matches in South Africa 
and face a difficult task to maintain parity, with Philander finishing the day 
with figures of three for 35.
