In 24 hours time, I will be submitting the first draft of my book to the 
publishers. In a purely practical sense, it’s occupied the last year of my 
life, but it’s been on my mind for a long time before that. In drawing together 
100 recipes from over 80 books, I have discarded just as many, set aside for 
future posts here on the blog. I have sampled countless spoonfuls of the same 
few flavours of ice-cream, baked with endless variations of pastry and have 
chewed (quite literally) over oven times and temperatures for fish, pheasant, 
steak, and chicken. I have re-read the books – a welcome task early on in the 
process when it was a break from cooking, and a more difficult one as I turned 
my thoughts and energies to the words that will accompany the recipes.

As well as a bit of all my favourite stories, my book has a fair bit of me in 
it too. Suddenly, it is heading off out into the world for others to read and 
to edit. It is a relief, in many ways, and terrifying in at least a dozen 
others. Mostly, I feel so extraordinarily lucky. A team of talented people will 
turn my electronic documents, and my brilliant friendLean’s 
<http://www.leanandmeadow.com/> photographs, into a book. You will be able to 
read it in autumn 2017, almost a year to the day after I send my first draft 
off.

In the meantime, I am going to figure out what to do next. There will be 
edits, of course, and plenty of time set aside to continue testing and 
re-testing the recipes, until I can make them in my sleep. And there will be 
time to start writing something new.

But first, I am going to have a weekend off. On Saturday morning, I am going 
to lock away my laptop, make the first of many pots of tea, and attack the pile 
of books at the foot of my bed. The idea for my book came, after all, because I 
love to read. I love the smell of new books (and of old ones), the sound of 
crisp pages turning against soft cotton duvets, and the weight of a book in my 
hands. I love escaping into other worlds, coming to know characters as friends, 
and discovering something new about myself. If I can pull myself away from 
them, it will be to make this – the work of mere moments and only a handful of 
ingredients. It’s inauthentic, and lazy. I can’t wait.

Okayu and Cucumber

Serves 1

Ingredients


Okayu
50g sushi rice 
250ml stock (chicken, vegetable or dashi)
1 egg

Cucumber Salad
1 small cucumber
 60ml rice wine vinegar 
1tsp caster sugar 
1/2tsp coarse sea salt 
2tbsp toasted sesame seeds (I used half black sesame seeds)
Soy sauce, to serve

Equipment 
Small saucepan with a lid
Wooden spoon 
Vegetable peeler or mandolin
Kitchen towel 
Mixing bowl

1. Wash the rice three times and then cover with water. Leave to soak for half 
an hour. Preheat your oven to 180C.

2. Drain the rice then add it, and the stock, to a saucepan. Cover with a lid 
and place over a medium heat. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat right down 
and simmer gently for 25 minutes. Keep the lid on the whole time. Once 25 
minutes have passed, turn off the heat and steam for five minutes.

3. Transfer the rice to a heatproof bowl, make a slight well in the rice and 
then crack the egg in. Bake for 10 minutes, until the white is cooked but the 
yolk is still runny.

4. While the egg is cooking, slice the cucumbers thinly using a vegetable 
peeler or mandolin. Pat down with kitchen towel to remove some of their 
moisture. Combine the other salad ingredients (except the sesame seeds) in a 
bowl and swirl around so that the salt and sugar dissolve in the vinegar. Add 
the cucumber ribbons, toss, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve immediately 
with the rice and egg, and some soy sauce, if you like.
