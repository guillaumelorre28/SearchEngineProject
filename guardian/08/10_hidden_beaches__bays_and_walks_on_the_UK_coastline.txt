Penmon Point, near Beaumaris, Anglesey

Tucked away on the eastern tip of Anglesey, Penmon Point makes an ideal lunch 
stop as part of a coastal walk (theIsle of Anglesey Coastal Path 
<http://www.visitanglesey.co.uk/en/about-anglesey/isle-of-anglesey-coastal-path/>
 runs through it). ThePilot House cafe <http://www.pilothousecafe.com> serves 
Welsh cream teas in its garden overlooking Puffin Island (half a mile 
offshore), the Menai Strait and Snowdonia. The Penmon lighthouse nearby sounds 
its melancholy fog bell every 30 seconds, an atmospheric soundtrack to a stroll 
along the award-winning pebble beach with its potential for porpoise and seal 
spotting. A short walk down the toll road (free for pedestrians) leads to the 
13th-centuryPenmon Priory 
<http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/penmonpriory/?lang=en> and holy well 
dedicated to Saint Seiriol, and an Elizabethan dovecote, all ancient, arcane 
and architecturally interesting.

This rocky extremity of the UK (its southernmost point) is reached by a single 
road, then a lonely footpath and comes to an end at the wind-whipped 
lighthouse. Further along, the newly rebuilt lifeboat house sits perilously at 
the base of a 45m cliff. Not a place for conventional seaside pleasures, then, 
more for marvelling at the power of the sea and the geological forces that 
carved the coastline into monumental rocky coves and sheer cliffs (most 
spectacularly at neighbouring Kynance Cove).Polpeor Café on the clifftop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/oct/14/south-cornwall-top10-eats> is 
the place to take in the views while munching a crab salad (or clutching a mug 
of hot chocolate), then pick up a piece of locally quarried, dark-green 
Serpentine at the stone polisher’s shop in the village.

Edgier than its more-visited neighbour, Rye, but no less interesting, Rye 
Harbour is reached by driving down a two-mile road past industrial units and 
boatyards. Still a working harbour, it has its own, small fishing fleet, and 
hearty, fisherman-sized snacks are served at the Bosun’s Bite cafe on the quay. 
Pints of Shepherd Neame ales are pulled at theWilliam the Conqueror

Reserve <http://www.wildrye.info/reserve/>, a short walk away, boasts 150 rare 
or endangered species which nest in the shingle or overwinter in the lagoons. 
All of which is rich subject matter for local artists who show their work in 
the elegant and friendlyAvocet Gallery and Tea Room

 Path leading to Saint Peter-on-the-Wall chapel. Photograph: Alamy 
You have to walk the last half mile to the tiny chapel of St 
Peter-on-the-Wall, at Bradwell-on-Sea on Essex’s Dengie peninsula (turn right 
in front of St Cedd’s church in the village, follow East End Road as far as you 
can, then park). The mini-pilgrimage feels appropriate – the tiny church, built 
in 654 AD, is one of the oldest and most atmospheric places of worship in the 
UK and deserves a little reverence. As does the surrounding lonely shoreline 
and saltmarsh, whose muddy tussocks hop with wading birds and whose beaches are 
composed, in part, of yellow cockleshells. A walk on, south and east along the 
sea wall takes you to the pretty town of Burnham-on-Crouch, once a centre of 
the cockle, whelk and oyster trade, and now famed for sailing activities 
centred on theRoyal Corinthian Yacht Club <http://www.royalcorinthian.co.uk> .

 Tourists viewing seals from boat, Blakeney Point. Photograph: Alamy 
The best way to arrive at Blakeney Point, a sand and shingle spit stretching 
out into the sea from the heart of Blakeney national reserve, is on aboat trip 
from Morston Quay <http://www.beansboattrips.co.uk/>. You not only get a chance 
to see grey seals basking on the sandbanks, but you disembark at the 
distinctive, blue Old Lifeboat House, home to National Trust rangers and a 
visitor centre. From there, you can explore the rare habitat and its 
inhabitants, which range from sandwich terns to otters and yellow-horned 
poppies. The more energetic might opt to walk back to Morston , a worthwhile 
though demanding tramp across four miles of shingle back.
• Nearest train station: Sheringham, then get the CH3 bus to Morston. There is 
restricted access to the western end ofBlakeney Point  
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/blakeney/>from April to mid-August, to protect 
birds nesting on the shingle, and from November to mid-January during the seal 
pupping season.

Seaham, County Durham
 Spa at Seaham Hall 
There was a time when a day out on the Durham coast seemed like a preposterous 
idea: known as the “black coast”, it had coal mines extending four miles out to 
sea and scattering their waste over a large area. The Turning the Tide 
initiative of 1997-2002 saw 1.3m tonnes of spoil removed, the beaches cleaned 
and wildlife returning. The harbour town of Seaham is a good base to explore 
the area and head off on the coastal path or to cycle part of theNorth Sea 
Cycle Route <http://www.northsea-cycle.com/default.asp?id=2&mnu=2&lang=1>which 
goes through Seaham. The more slothful can check intoSeaham Hall 
<http://www.seaham-hall.co.uk/>, a local-stately home-turned-luxury hotel, for 
spa treatments.

 Bass Rock and St Baldred’s Cross from Seacliff. Photograph: Alamy 
At first there, appears to be little to see or do at this wide stretch of sand 
and rock five miles east of North Berwick. Reached by driving down a private 
road (parking £2), then following a path through bushes and trees, the beach 
opens up and is wide, unspoilt and largely unpopulated. But then your attention 
is caught by Bass Rock, a volcanic plug white with gannet droppings rising like 
a massive whaleback from the ocean, and, further along the shoreline, the 
ragged outline of ruinedTantallon Castle 
<http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertyoverview.htm?PropID=PL_284>
 appears unexpectedly around the headland, and a tiny harbour (said to be 
Scotland’s smallest) is revealed, carved out of the rocks in 1890 by the then 
laird.

Artists have never been able to resist the charms of a fishing village, so 
it’s not a surprise that the red, pantiled houses, still-active harbour and 
winding streets of Pittenweem have drawn a resident artistic community. The 
village’s annualArts Festival <http://www.pittenweemartsfestival.co.uk/>, at 
the beginning of August, showcases their work, as does theEast Neuk Open Studios
 <http://www.eastneukopenstudios.org/> trail. Fresh fish is the other 
attraction at Pittenweem, sold at local fishmongers and on the menus of 
restaurants in the (equally attractive) neighbouring villages – most famously 
theAnstruther Fish Bar <http://www.anstrutherfishbar.co.uk/> up the road and 16

 Barnacle geese at Caerlaverock Wetland Centre. Photograph: Alamy 
Every October, 30,000 barnacle geese arrive at centre on the north Solway 
coast having flown 2,000 miles from their Arctic nesting grounds on Svalbard 
island. Rangers take groups of binocular-bearing bird-watchers for “dawn 
flight” trips to witness the geese make their early morning sweep from the 
mudflats where they roost to feeding grounds inland. The clatter and commotion 
of the birds as they begin their flight, followed by the sight of their flypast 
in v-shaped skeins is one of nature’s marvels, and well worth getting up for. 
The 1,400-acre reserve was established by Sir Peter Scott to provide a winter 
home for barnacle geese, but also attracts many other types of wildlife, 
including badgers, whooper swans and natterjack toads.

Everything feels huge at this 700-acre National Trust nature reserve 
overlooking the Duddon estuary in Cumbria. At low tide, giant stretches of sand 
and mudflats are revealed (two miles wide at some point), backed by an enormous 
dune system of sandy mounds tufted with marram grass and interlaced with 
freshwater pools. All of which is the perfect habitat for a variety of 
creatures, including the elusive natterjack toad (look for them in the pools 
beside the car park boardwalk), terns, oystercatchers and numerous butterfly 
and plant species (600 at the last count). The National Trust runs regular 
wildlife events including Mini Beast Safaris and Wildlife Explorer Trails. More
