For a change from Munro bagging, the new Affric Kintail Way (
affrickintailway.com <http://www.affrickintailway.com>) runs 44 miles from 
Drumnadrochit on Loch Ness through Glen Affric to the west coast at Morvich, in 
Kintail. It’s touted as a more rugged hiking/mountain-biking route than the 
nearby Great Glen Way, though the two could be combined to trek coast-to-coast. 
Created this spring,North Coast 500 (northcoast500.com 
<http://www.northcoast500.com/home.aspx>) is a 500-mile driving route skirting 
the north coast from Inverness to the Kyle of Lochalsh on the west coast that 
is attempting to become Scotland’s Route 66. Or go flightseeing over the Isle 
of Skye withSkye Seaplanes (from £129pp, lochlomondseaplanes.com

 Gille Brighde cafe and restaurant 
Eating
Anchor in the tiny bay or drive down a single-track lane to Gille Brighde (The 
Old Schoolhouse, Lower Diabaig, 01445 790245,gille-brighde.com 
<http://www.gille-brighde.com>) in Wester Ross, a year-old rustic restaurant on 
the shore. Squat lobster bisque, local hand-dived scallops with samphire and 
home-cured bacon are on the menu.

The UK’s most northerly Michelin-starred restaurant, at the Albannach hotel 
(01571 844407,thealbannach.co.uk <http://www.thealbannach.co.uk/TOP.html>) in 
Lochinver, now has a young sibling in the same town.The Caberfeidh (Main

serves tapas-style small plates of local shellfish, fish and game including 
Caberfeidh crab cakes, wild venison meatballs and creel-caught langoustines.

On Skye, Glenview, an award-winning restaurant with rooms, has reinvented 
itself as theSkye Pie Cafe (doubles from £85 B&B, skyepiecafe.co.uk 
<http://skyepiecafe.co.uk/>) with walkers’ pies to go: venison and juniper, and 
west coast crab. The old two AA Rosette restaurant’s grub can still be tried at 
asupperclub <http://skyepiecafe.co.uk/supper-club/>, and there’s a new gallery 
stocking co-founder Kirsty’s textile artworks (she has three Shetland sheep and 
is spinning her own wool).

Lake District
 Electric bikes in the Lakes 
See and do
There’s a growing network of electric bikes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2013/nov/16/electric-bicycle-any-good> (
electricbicyclenetwork.com <http://www.electricbicyclenetwork.com/>) for 
touring fellside villages, and you can recharge yourself and your bike’s 
battery at one of the pubs and cafes marked on the route map.GoLakes Travel 
(£10 an hour,golakes.co.uk <http://www.golakes.co.uk/>) rents out open-sided 
electric Twizy cars: they carry two passengers, one in front of the other and 
they can even make it overHardknott pass 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2014/jul/15/in-praise-of-britains-two-most-outrageous-roads-wrynose-and-hardknott-passes>

Recently opened in Keswick is indoor ice-climbing centre King Kong Climbing 
Centre (group lesson £30pp, kingkongclimbingcentre.co.uk

Eating
Newcomer Lake Road Kitchen (Lake Road, Ambleside, 01539 422012, 
lakeroadkitchen.co.uk <http://www.lakeroadkitchen.co.uk/>) is a must, with a 
promise that “if it doesn’t grow in this climate it’s not on our menu”. You’ll 
often see the chef coming in with fresh wild food he’s foraged locally, for 
dishes such as the garden salad with confit dryad saddle, day old duck egg and 
pork sauce, or the aged Herdwick lamb with burned lettuce juice, sheep’s 
yoghurt, young onions, hen-of-the-wood and chickweed. You can’t beatQuince & 
Medlar (13 Castlegate, Cockermouth, 01900 823579, quinceandmedlar.co.uk 
<http://quinceandmedlar.co.uk/>) for homemade vegetarian cuisine in a small and 
cosy setting. Those who enjoy a tipple with their food should tryBistro at the 
Distillery (Bassenthwaite Lake, 01768 788 852, bistroatthedistillery.com 
<http://www.bistroatthedistillery.com/>), where you can wash your dinner down 
with artisan whisky, gin or vodka in a former cattle shed.

And a new “luxury Cumbrian” hotel, a £4.5m reinvention of the Forest Side (
theforestside.com <http://www.theforestside.com/>) is due to open in Grasmere 
in September. It says the menu will feature lots of foraged food, and veg from 
the hotel’s garden.

 Take the train over the Ribblehead viaduct, then cycle back to Settle – mostly 
downhill. Photograph: Alamy 
See and do
A cycle ride beside the Settle‑Carlisle <http://www.settle-carlisle.co.uk/> 
railway may sound like strenuous work, but theOff the Rails cycling centre 
(£40pp inc train fare,offtherailsbikehire.wordpress.com 
<https://offtherailsbikehire.wordpress.com/ribblehead-experience/>) puts people 
on the train at Settle, then meets them at Ribblehead with hybrid or mountain 
bikes and maps. From here you can ride back to Settle downhill through 
limestone valleys and via pubs, on back lanes or off-road. Food courses abound. 
Learn to make your own sausages on butchery courses run by Malhamdale farmer
Chris Wildman (yorkshirechorizo.com <http:>), cheese in Ribblesdale (
ribblesdalecheese.wordpress.com <https://ribblesdalecheese.wordpress.com/>), or 
chocolate at theLittle Chocolate Shop in Leyburn (littlechocolateshop.co.uk 
<http://littlechocolateshop.co.uk/>).

Rainy days
A classic bit of fun in wet weather is to take a trip on a heritage train such 
as theEmbsay to Bolton Abbey Steam Railway (adult from £9, child £5, 
embsayboltonabbeyrailway.org.uk <http://www.embsayboltonabbeyrailway.org.uk/>). 
Passengers can enjoy the ride as the train weaves through tunnels and along 
viaducts. The ales up this way are better than most, so a good option is a 
brewery tour –Theakston <http://www.theakstons.co.uk/> and Black Sheep 
<https://www.blacksheepbrewery.com/> are the obvious names, but a more unusual 
choice is the smallerRichmond Brewery Company (richmondbrewing.co.uk 
<http://www.richmondbrewing.co.uk/>) in the grade II-listed former railway 
station on the edge of the Dales. During and after rain the best thing to do in 
these parts is head outside to view waterfalls – when the whitewater churns 
even more dramatically than usual. TryJanet’s Foss in Malham, Aysgarth Falls in 
Wensleydale or little-visitedCatrigg Force near Stainforth.

Eating
The Bivouac (Druid’s Temple, Masham, 01765 535033, swintonbivouac.co.uk 
<http://www.swintonbivouac.co.uk/>) started as a glamping site and now has a 
great shabby-chic cafe with exposed beams and stone walls. Acoustic sets from 
local folk acts sometimes run in the evenings. For real ale and homemade food 
in a proper pub it’s got to beThe Narrow Boat (36-38 Victoria Street ) near 
Skipton’s canal basin.
