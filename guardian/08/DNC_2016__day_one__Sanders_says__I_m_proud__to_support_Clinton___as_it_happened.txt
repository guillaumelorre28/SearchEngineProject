The first day of the Democratic national convention is tied up with a bow. 
Here’s what happened:

 * Supporters of senator Bernie Sanders started with boos and ended in tears 
as their candidate took the stage and urged them to vote for Hillary Clinton, 
saying she “must become the next president of the United States”. 
 * The big question of the night – can the Democrats unify behind their 
candidate? –appeared unresolved at night’s end, with even core Sanders ally 
Elizabeth Warren facing heckles and chants from Sanders backers. 
 * The roiling emotions in the convention hall added to the suspense of 
Clinton’s anticipated speech Thursday, and what it will mean for the party. It 
appeared possible that the candidate may face waves of booing even as she 
claims the nomination. 
 * But there were highlight moments, notably in a powerfully personal speech 
by first lady Michelle Obama, that pointed to a different possibility – to a 
Democratic party that leaves Philadelphia with new energy and something 
resembling unity. 
 * Significant ice in the hall between the Sanders and (much larger) Clinton 
campswas broken by comedian Sarah Silverman, who advised: “To the ‘Bernie or 
Bust’ people, you’re being ridiculous.” 
 * Another notable speech came from senator Cory Booker, whose optimistic 
refrain “America will rise” pulled the crowd repeatedly to its feet. 
 * Before the marquee speakers took the stage, the convention seemed in danger 
of succumbing to forces of dissent and even scandal. The dissent was embodied 
by pro-Sanders demonstrators in the streets and inside the hall, where they 
interrupted the opening prayer with chanting. The scandal came thanks to the 
star-crossed Democratic national committee, whose chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman 
Schultz, resigned Sunday in fallout from an emails leak that showed top party 
officials arrayed against Sanders. 
 * Hours before the curtain went up, Wasserman Schultz announced she was also 
abdicating her ceremonial convention duties, and would not gavel the event to 
order. 
 * That wasn’t all bad news. It set up a star turn by fill-in-gaveler 
Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, the mayor of Baltimore, who initially forgot to pound 
the gavel and had to run back to the lectern to do so: David Freddoso

Russia denies DNC hack

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday brushed aside accusations 
that Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails, Reuters reports:

“I don’t want to use four-letter words,” Lavrov told reporters, when asked 
whether Russia was responsible for the hacking of emails.

He was speaking at the start of talks with Secretary of State John Kerry on 
the sidelines of a meeting of Southeast Asian nations in Laos.

Sarah Silverman is talking to CNN about her “don’t be ridiculous” moment, in 
which she upbraided Bernie-or-bust supporters. “No it wasn’t scripted at all,” 
she tells Jake Tapper.

She says she loved that Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> “wasn’t for sale.” Al 
Franken, who is there too, reminds the world that 90% of Sanders supporters 
have been polled as saying they will support Clinton.

Silverman accuses Franken of being a “name-dropper” for bringing up Oregon 
senator Jeff Merkley.

“If Sanders can’t convince his own supporters, then who can?” Silverman asks. 

Franken insists “there’s no question” that Sanders made a strong case and 
“tonight went a long long way and I really believe that we’re going to leave 
here united.”

Tapper asks him about his rare foray back into the land of comedy.

“I will do anything for Hillary including be funny,” Franken says.

Reaction to Sanders speech
adam nagourney (@adamnagourney) 
Not sure that Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> could ask for anything 
more than Bernie Sanders than this speech.

feel like the Oscar speech that went on too long.#DNCinPHL

Sanders: 'I am proud to stand with her'

As the end nears of this epic day at the Democratic convention, Sanders wins 
applause and cheers for lines that would have drawn layers of booing seven 
hours ago:

I have known Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> for 25 years. I remember 
her as a great first lady who broke precedent in terms of the role that a first 
lady was supposed to play as she helped lead the fight for universal health 
care. I served with her in the United States Senate and know her as a fierce 
advocate for the rights of children.

Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand 
with her here tonight.

Sanders’ hand gestures here when he enunciated “significant coming together” 
were priceless. He was showing them what needed to happen:

It is no secret that Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and I disagree on a 
number of issues. That’s what this campaign has been about. That’s what 
democracy is about. But I am happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform 
Committee there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns and 
we produced, by far, the most progressive platform in the history of the 
Democratic Party.
Greg Sargent (@ThePlumLineGS) 
This is crucial. Sanders is vouching for the post-primary process, saying it 
produced real results. And he's right.

The first day of the Democratic national convention is tied up with a bow. 
Here’s what happened:

 * Supporters of senator Bernie Sanders started with boos and ended in tears 
as their candidate took the stage and urged them to vote for Hillary Clinton, 
saying she “must become the next president of the United States”. 
 * The big question of the night – can the Democrats unify behind their 
candidate? –appeared unresolved at night’s end, with even core Sanders ally 
Elizabeth Warren facing heckles and chants from Sanders backers. 
 * The roiling emotions in the convention hall added to the suspense of 
Clinton’s anticipated speech Thursday, and what it will mean for the party. It 
appeared possible that the candidate may face waves of booing even as she 
claims the nomination. 
 * But there were highlight moments, notably in a powerfully personal speech 
by first lady Michelle Obama, that pointed to a different possibility – to a 
Democratic party that leaves Philadelphia with new energy and something 
resembling unity. 
 * Significant ice in the hall between the Sanders and (much larger) Clinton 
campswas broken by comedian Sarah Silverman, who advised: “To the ‘Bernie or 
Bust’ people, you’re being ridiculous.” 
 * Another notable speech came from senator Cory Booker, whose optimistic 
refrain “America will rise” pulled the crowd repeatedly to its feet. 
 * Before the marquee speakers took the stage, the convention seemed in danger 
of succumbing to forces of dissent and even scandal. The dissent was embodied 
by pro-Sanders demonstrators in the streets and inside the hall, where they 
interrupted the opening prayer with chanting. The scandal came thanks to the 
star-crossed Democratic national committee, whose chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman 
Schultz, resigned Sunday in fallout from an emails leak that showed top party 
officials arrayed against Sanders. 
 * Hours before the curtain went up, Wasserman Schultz announced she was also 
abdicating her ceremonial convention duties, and would not gavel the event to 
order. 
 * That wasn’t all bad news. It set up a star turn by fill-in-gaveler 
Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, the mayor of Baltimore, who initially forgot to pound 
the gavel and had to run back to the lectern to do so: David Freddoso

Here’s some data on the top trends in search tonight, thanks to the folks at 
Google data. Sanders was searched twice as much as Michelle Obama on Google; 
Paul Simon fell among the top search terms.

Making the list of top trending questions was, “did slaves build the White 
House?” Yes – saved you a click.

Via Google: 


 * Bernie Sanders was 2X more searched than Michelle Obama, the second most 
searched speaker. Elizabeth Warren came in third, followed by Cory Booker and 
Paul Simon. 
 * +650% spike for “Citizens United” following Bernie Sanders’ speech, which 
overtook searches for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which had trended 
throughout the day. 
 * Top 5 trending questions on all of Google in the U.S. 
 * 1. What is Citizens United? 
 * 2. Who built the White House? 
 * 3. Did slaves build the White House? 
 * 4. How old is Bernie Sanders? 
 * 5. What is TPP?  
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday brushed aside accusations 
that Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails, Reuters reports:

“I don’t want to use four-letter words,” Lavrov told reporters, when asked 
whether Russia was responsible for the hacking of emails.

He was speaking at the start of talks with Secretary of State John Kerry on 
the sidelines of a meeting of Southeast Asian nations in Laos.
 
Bernie Sanders <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> has sent 
an email to supporters announcing a new political vehicle. The email reads in 
part:

Our work will continue in the form of a new group called Our Revolution.The 
goal of this organization will be no different from the goal of our campaign: 
we must transform American politics to make our political and economic systems 
once again responsive to the needs of working families.

We cannot do this alone. All of us must be a part of Our Revolution.

Join Our Revolution and help continue our critical work to create a government 
which represents all of us, and not just the 1 percent – a government based on 
the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. Add your 
name here. <https://ourrevolution.com/>
 
Sarah Silverman is talking to CNN about her “don’t be ridiculous” moment, in 
which she upbraided Bernie-or-bust supporters. “No it wasn’t scripted at all,” 
she tells Jake Tapper.

She says she loved that Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> “wasn’t for sale.” Al 
Franken, who is there too, reminds the world that 90% of Sanders supporters 
have been polled as saying they will support Clinton.

Silverman accuses Franken of being a “name-dropper” for bringing up Oregon 
senator Jeff Merkley.

“If Sanders can’t convince his own supporters, then who can?” Silverman asks. 

Franken insists “there’s no question” that Sanders made a strong case and 
“tonight went a long long way and I really believe that we’re going to leave 
here united.”

Tapper asks him about his rare foray back into the land of comedy.

“I will do anything for Hillary including be funny,” Franken says. 
 
Here’s a clip of that Sarah Silverman moment earlier:

I have known Hillary Clinton

her as a great first lady who broke precedent in terms of the role that a first 
lady was supposed to play as she helped lead the fight for universal health 
care. I served with her in the United States Senate and know her as a fierce 
advocate for the rights of children.

Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand
