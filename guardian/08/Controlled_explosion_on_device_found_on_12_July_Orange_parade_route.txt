The Police Service of Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> said a security alert was 
being wound up around the area where the suspicious object was placed at the 
junction of Ormeau Avenue and the Dublin Road earlier on Tuesday.

As thousands of Ulster loyalists prepare for 18 parades across Northern 
Ireland to commemorate the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, the placing of a 
suspect device on the most famous marching route in the region will raise 
tensions in the city.

A PSNI spokesperson said the metal object was dropped from a car. A BBC 
television crew that was preparing to film the main Orange demonstration 
passing by later on Tuesday had to be temporarily evacuated from their vantage 
point for their own safety, the PSNI added.

The device turned out to be a hoax bomb and was destroyed by an army bomb 
disposal robot.

Police have mounted a huge security operation in North Belfast around the most 
contentious parading route in the region – the Crumlin Road/Ardoyne shops 
flashpoint.


Nationalist residents living in Ardoyne object to the sight of Ulster loyalist 
and Orange marchers passing by their community. Loyalists in turn say the 
Crumlin Road is a main arterial route that they have been using for decades to 
enter the city centre on loyalism’s most sacred day.

Three local Orange lodges alongside about 100 supporters are being allowed to 
pass by the nationalist Ardoyne on their way to join the main demonstration in 
Belfast city centre.
