Close of play

20th over: India 60-0 (trail by 417; Rahul 30, Patel 28) 

That’s it for day two in Chennai. It wasn’t the most mesmeric day’s play – the 
highlight was probably Liam Dawson’s patient unbeaten 66 - but the game is well 
poised with three days to play. Thanks for your company, bye!

19th over: India 58-0 (Rahul 29, Patel 27) Ah, Liam Dawson is going to bowl – 
he replaces Rashid for what should be the penultimate over of the day. His 
fourth ball is a nice delivery that beats Rahul’s tentative defensive stroke, 
and he starts with a maiden. He’s had a very good day.

18th over: India 57-0 (Rahul 29, Patel 27) There are three overs remaining, 
and I don’t think we’re going to see Liam Dawson get a bowl tonight. Moeen gets 
one to turn sharply if slowly at Rahul, who is hit on the elbow as he reaches 
forward defensively.

17th over: India 55-0 (Rahul 28, Patel 26) Patel picks the googly from Rashid 
and glides it for three to bring up the fifty partnership. Later in the over he 
splits the field with a delicious extra-cover drive that scoots away for four. 
The Indian batsmen look ominously comfortable, especially when you think that 
the masters, Pujara and Kohli, are still to come.

16th over: India 47-0 (Rahul 27, Patel 19) “It’ll be fine Rob, never fear,” 
says Guy Hornsby. “We’ve got three spinners.”

And thanks to their batting, they’ve got 272 runs to concede before they are 
in debit!

Lord, India are going to be two down at tea on day four, aren’t they.

15th over: India 44-0 (Rahul 26, Patel 17) Adil Rashid, who batted splendidly 
early in the day for his 60, is coming into the attack. He has 22 wickets in 
the series, easily the most by an England bowler. He induces a false stroke 
from Patel, who gets a leading edge towards cover off a nice, flighted delivery.

13th over: India 32-0 (Rahul 19, Patel 12) Rahul slashes a poor delivery from 
Stokes through the man at deep point for four. There are seven overs remaining, 
and England could really use a wicket or two. In truth, they don’t look like 
getting one.

suppose it goes down as a missed chance.

11th over: India 24-0 (Rahul 13, Patel 10) Stokes replaces Broad. His first 
ball is a wide half-volley that is driven deliciously between mid-off and extra 
cover for four by KL Rahul. This already looks like seriously hard work for the 
England bowlers.

9th over: India 16-0 (Rahul 7, Patel 8) Another maiden from Broad to Rahul, 
and that takes us to drinks. It’s all pretty sleepy at the moment. England have 
fairly defensive fields, presumably to keep control of the scoring rate and try 
to take an India win out of the equation.

7th over: India 16-0 (Rahul 7, Patel 8) Rahul throws various sinks at a wide 
delivery from Broad and is lucky not to edge it through to Bairstow. It was 
such a vigorous stroke that he hurt his knee in the process, and there’s a 
break in play while he receives treatment. He looks pretty unconvincing and it 
beaten again by the last ball of the over.

6th over: India 16-0 (Rahul 7, Patel 8) Some good bounce for Ball in that 
over, with KL Rahul forcing one lifting delivery just short of gully. It might 
not be long before Alastair Cook turns to one of his spinners while the ball is 
still hard.

5th over: India 13-0 (Rahul 6, Patel 8) A few technical problems here – 
apologies – but you haven’t missed much. Broad is trying to tempt Rahul into 
something inappropriate outside off stump; Rahul waits for Broad to straighten 
his line and tucks a single off the hip. Patel is then beaten as he tries to 
hook a leg-side bouncer, a short of airy-fairy abandon.

3rd over: India 12-0 (Rahul 4, Patel 7) Patel is an irritating little opener, 
both in his cocksure manner and because of his scoring rate, and he has given 
India a decent start here.

2nd over: India 8-0 (Rahul 3, Patel 5) Jake Ball almost strikes third ball, 
with Patel edging an attempt cut just short of the slips and through for four. 
Root hurt his little finger in his attempt to stop the ball but he hasn’t asked 
for treatment.

1st over: India 2-0 (Rahul 1, Patel 1) Murali Vijay is struggling with a 
shoulder injury, so professional spin-bowling critic Parthiv Patel will open 
the batting. Stuart Broad takes the first over in the absence of Jimmy 
Anderson, and Patel benefits from an overthrow to get off the mark in an 
otherwise uneventful over.

“Cutters, mate,” says Ian Copestake. “Cutters.”

WICKET! England 477 all out (Ball b Mishra 12)

Mishra replaces Jadeja and ends the innings second ball, cleaning Ball up with 
the googly. Liam Dawson ends on 66 not out, a very impressive, level-headed 
performance. England will have around 90 minutes with the new ball. Wickets 
please!

157th over: England 476-9 (Dawson 65, Ball 12) Dawson lifts Ashwin high to 
deep midwicket, where the substitute Axar Patel takes a terrific catch above 
his head before falling backwards onto the rope. It’s given as six, and Ball 
makes it two sixes in the over with a decisive clout over long-on. Shot!

156th over: England 459-9 (Dawson 58, Ball 2) A maiden from Jadeja to Ball. 
Nobody really knows what a good score is on this pitch. The consensus in the 
commentary box is that it’s especially important to strike with the new ball.

155th over: England 459-9 (Dawson 58, Ball 2) Dawson is content to sweep 
Ashwin’s first ball for a single and give the strike to Jake Ball. I’ve never 
been sure about that approach, not even when Steve Waugh did it every second 
innings against England. Two from t’over.

stump.

“Hi,” says Paul Moody. “I’m in kampot ,Cambodia, wondering where next? 
Following ,your wise words as England try and get their former dead rubber 
title back. Re: Jardine and Verity,either would make a partnership seem more 
catchy or steadfast.”

WICKET! England 455-9 (Broad run out 19)

I love the smell of farce in the morning. Broad has been run out after a 
mix-up with Dawson and some excellent work from KL Rahul on the fine-leg 
boundary.

153rd over: England 453-8 (Dawson 55, Broad 17) Ashwin, from around the 
wicket, turns one sharply to hit the pad as Dawson works across the line. 
Marais Erasmus says not out but India are going to review. I think this turned 
too much. Indeed it did, and it bounced too much as well.

152nd over: England 453-8 (Dawson 56, Broad 17) Hello again, my worthy 
children. Ravindra Jadeja is going to start after tea, with Liam Dawson 45 runs 
away from one of Test cricket’s more unlikely fairytales. Make that 44; he has 
just pushed a single into the off side.

TEA

151st over: England 452-8 (Dawson 55, Broad 17) That’s tea. It was a sleepy 
session but a good one for England, who lost just Adil Rashid for a bright 60. 
Liam Dawson made a calm half-century on debut, and England are slowly inching 
towards a position of safety. See you in 15 minutes for the final session!

150th over: England 452-8 (Dawson 55, Broad 17) Jadeja misses a run-out chance 
when Broad is sent back by Dawson. His throw seemed to be on target but it hit 
a footmark and bounced miles over the stumps. Dawson then drives the new bowler 
Ishant for a decidedly pleasant boundary.

149th over: England 448-8 (Dawson 51, Broad 17) Broad misses a vile hack at 
Ashwin, with the ball skidding past leg stump and through Parthiv Patel for 
three byes. Actually they were given as runs, so maybe there was an under-edge; 
yes, the replay shows there was, and that he would have been bowled without the 
deflection. Great shot! Broad, who is here for a good time rather than a long 
time, clouts four over extra cover to move to 17 from 12 balls.

147th over: England 435-8 (Dawson 50, Broad 5) Dawson drives Ashwin for a 
single to reach an impressive, temperatehalf-century on debut. He’s faced 121 
balls and hit four fours. Good lad.

“I slightly worry that Jennings is the new Frank Hayes,” says Ian Forth. 
“Older readers may not recall Frank but he scored an attractive ton on debut 
against the West Indies in, naturally, a losing cause in 1973. Then got just 
122 runs over the course of eight more Tests, admittedly all against the 
powerful West Indies of the time. Hoping I’m wrong and he is in fact the new 
Graham Thorpe.”

I think he looks really promising, though whether he starts the Test series 
next summer I’m not sure – it’s probably him at No3 or Moeen at No5.

146th over: England 430-8 (Dawson 49, Broad 1) Broad misses a mercifully wide 
yorker first ball, which sneaks under his bat but wide of off stump. The days 
of Broad being compared to Sir Garry Sobers are long gone: in Tests this year 
he averages 8.33.

“You mentioned the 100 partnership, which it seems (TMS aver) is now the best 
eighth-wicket for England in India,” says John Starbuck. “Mind you, Dawson & 
Rashid doesn’t ring quite the same as Jardine & Verity. Rather more mundane, 
but maybe a little earthier?” Yes, Jardine & Verity sounds like a cravat shop 
in a Poirot film.

WICKET! England 429-8 (Rashid c Patel b Yadav 60)

Oh dear. Rashid falls one short of his highest Test score, slashing outside 
off stump and edging through to Parthiv Patel. That was a fine innings though.

145th over: England 429-7 (Dawson 49, Rashid 60) Ashwin has switched ends and 
starts around the wicket to Rashid, who glides a couple more to third man. It’s 
been a story of wrist and reward for Rashid, who has played some really lovely 
strokes. England are batting with such comfort on such a benign pitch that both 
these players may never have a better chance to reach a Test hundred.

144th over: England 424-7 (Dawson 47, Rashid 57) The lively Umesh Yadav 
replaces Ashwin, and does nothing that will be remembered in 10 minutes’ time.

“This situation calls for a bit of creative captaincy,” says Kimberley 
Thonger. “Declare on 550 when Dawson and Rashid both have their hundreds. Then, 
pack the infield and bowl underarm from both ends, all day. With this slow 
outfield it will take India three days to reach our total. Voilà, we have a 
draw, which will seem like a victory.” If it wasn’t for those pesky laws of the 
game…

143rd over: England 422-7 (Dawson 47, Rashid 56) Rashid drives Jadeja through 
extra cover to reach a chipper half-century from 141 balls, and then squeezes 
another boundary through point. This is lovely batting. That boundary brings up 
the hundred partnership.

142nd over: England 416-7 (Dawson 47, Rashid 46) Rashid survives a run-out 
referral after a marvellous piece of fielding from Jadeja. Dawson flicked the 
new bowler to Ashwin to mid-on, where Jadeja collected the ball and fired in a 
row for Ashwin to break the stumps. Rashid had been backing up but was able to 
slide his bat in safely.

141st over: England 410-7 (Dawson 46, Rashid 45) England will know they aren’t 
immune from defeat - not with 400, probably not with 500, so there is unlikely 
to be a push for a declaration any time soon. They are scoring fluently enough 
now anyway, particularly Rashid.

“I saw talk among OBOers of Batty being our best spinner, before it turned out 
he was truly stuck in the 1980s and even voted for Thatcher at the last 
referendum,” says Ian Copestake. “Now our latest debut centurion opener is in 
fact a golden duck walking. This is post-truth cricket at its most infuriating.”

140th over: England 410-7 (Dawson 46, Rashid 45)  Poor old Mishra, who has a 
series average of 79, goes round the wicket and induces a false stroke from 
Dawson, a top-edged sweep that lands safely between short fine leg and fine 
leg. Rashid then drives expansively through the covers for three. He plays some 
extremely good-looking strokes.

138th over: England 403-7 (Dawson 43, Rashid 41) Dawson drives Mishra 
comfortably for a single, and then Rashid chips wristily over midwicket for 
four to bring up the 400. Lovely shot. These two have played really well, 
though that observation is accompanied by the thought: what will Virat do on 
here?

“Top of the morning to you, guvnor,” says Ian Copestake. “This pitch is so 
mauve. We don’t know what it’s planning.”A Liam Dawson spin-bowling 
masterclass, that’s what it’s planning, pal.

20th over: India 60-0 (trail by 417; Rahul 30, Patel 28) 

That’s it for day two in Chennai. It wasn’t the most mesmeric day’s play – the 
highlight was probably Liam Dawson’s patient unbeaten 66 - but the game is well 
poised with three days to play. Thanks for your company, bye!
 
19th over: India 58-0 (Rahul 29, Patel 27) Ah, Liam Dawson is going to bowl – 
he replaces Rashid for what should be the penultimate over of the day. His 
fourth ball is a nice delivery that beats Rahul’s tentative defensive stroke, 
and he starts with a maiden. He’s had a very good day.
 
18th over: India 57-0 (Rahul 29, Patel 27) There are three overs remaining, 
and I don’t think we’re going to see Liam Dawson get a bowl tonight. Moeen gets 
one to turn sharply if slowly at Rahul, who is hit on the elbow as he reaches 
forward defensively.
 
17th over: India 55-0 (Rahul 28, Patel 26) Patel picks the googly from Rashid 
and glides it for three to bring up the fifty partnership. Later in the over he 
splits the field with a delicious extra-cover drive that scoots away for four. 
The Indian batsmen look ominously comfortable, especially when you think that 
the masters, Pujara and Kohli, are still to come.

 
16th over: India 47-0 (Rahul 27, Patel 19) “It’ll be fine Rob, never fear,” 
says Guy Hornsby. “We’ve got three spinners.”

And thanks to their batting, they’ve got 272 runs to concede before they are 
in debit!

Lord, India are going to be two down at tea on day four, aren’t they.
 
15th over: India 44-0 (Rahul 26, Patel 17) Adil Rashid, who batted splendidly 
early in the day for his 60, is coming into the attack. He has 22 wickets in 
the series, easily the most by an England bowler. He induces a false stroke 
from Patel, who gets a leading edge towards cover off a nice, flighted delivery.
 
14th over: India 39-0 (Rahul 25, Patel 12) Rahul gives Moeen the charge and 
drives handsomely over mid-off for four.
 
13th over: India 32-0 (Rahul 19, Patel 12) Rahul slashes a poor delivery from 
Stokes through the man at deep point for four. There are seven overs remaining, 
and England could really use a wicket or two. In truth, they don’t look like 
getting one.
 
12th over: India 26-0 (Rahul 14, Patel 11) Patel thick-edges Moeen onto the 
knee of Bairstow, who would have needed preposterous reactions to claim that. I 
suppose it goes down as a missed chance.



 
11th over: India 24-0 (Rahul 13, Patel 10) Stokes replaces Broad. His first 
ball is a wide half-volley that is driven deliciously between mid-off and extra 
cover for four by KL Rahul. This already looks like seriously hard work for the 
England bowlers.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/17/england-cricket-mark-wood-north-south> 
10th over: India 17-0 (Rahul 7, Patel 9) Rahul reverse-sweeps Moeen, with 
Stokes making an excellent stop at slip. That counts as an exciting incident in 
the context of this uneventful session. Moeen almost gets a quicker 63mph 
delivery through Patel with the final ball.
 
9th over: India 16-0 (Rahul 7, Patel 8) Another maiden from Broad to Rahul, 
and that takes us to drinks. It’s all pretty sleepy at the moment. England have 
fairly defensive fields, presumably to keep control of the scoring rate and try 
to take an India win out of the equation.
 
8th over: India 16-0 (Rahul 7, Patel 8) An early bowl for Moeen, who replaces 
Jake Ball (3-0-9-0) and starts with a maiden to Parthiv Patel.
 
7th over: India 16-0 (Rahul 7, Patel 8) Rahul throws various sinks at a wide 
delivery from Broad and is lucky not to edge it through to Bairstow. It was 
such a vigorous stroke that he hurt his knee in the process, and there’s a 
break in play while he receives treatment. He looks pretty unconvincing and it 
beaten again by the last ball of the over.
 
6th over: India 16-0 (Rahul 7, Patel 8) Some good bounce for Ball in that 
over, with KL Rahul forcing one lifting delivery just short of gully. It might 
not be long before Alastair Cook turns to one of his spinners while the ball is 
still hard.
 
5th over: India 13-0 (Rahul 6, Patel 8) A few technical problems here – 
apologies – but you haven’t missed much. Broad is trying to tempt Rahul into 
something inappropriate outside off stump; Rahul waits for Broad to straighten 
his line and tucks a single off the hip. Patel is then beaten as he tries to 
hook a leg-side bouncer, a short of airy-fairy abandon.
 
3rd over: India 12-0 (Rahul 4, Patel 7) Patel is an irritating little opener, 
both in his cocksure manner and because of his scoring rate, and he has given 
India a decent start here.
 
2nd over: India 8-0 (Rahul 3, Patel 5) Jake Ball almost strikes third ball, 
with Patel edging an attempt cut just short of the slips and through for four. 
Root hurt his little finger in his attempt to stop the ball but he hasn’t asked 
for treatment.
 
1st over: India 2-0 (Rahul 1, Patel 1) Murali Vijay is struggling with a 
shoulder injury, so professional spin-bowling critic Parthiv Patel will open 
the batting. Stuart Broad takes the first over in the absence of Jimmy 
Anderson, and Patel benefits from an overthrow to get off the mark in an 
otherwise uneventful over.

“Cutters, mate,” says Ian Copestake. “Cutters.” 
 
Mishra replaces Jadeja and ends the innings second ball, cleaning Ball up with 
the googly. Liam Dawson ends on 66 not out, a very impressive, level-headed 
performance. England will have around 90 minutes with the new ball. Wickets 
please!
 
157th over: England 476-9 (Dawson 65, Ball 12) Dawson lifts Ashwin high to 
deep midwicket, where the substitute Axar Patel takes a terrific catch above 
his head before falling backwards onto the rope. It’s given as six, and Ball 
makes it two sixes in the over with a decisive clout over long-on. Shot! 
 
156th over: England 459-9 (Dawson 58, Ball 2) A maiden from Jadeja to Ball. 
Nobody really knows what a good score is on this pitch. The consensus in the 
commentary box is that it’s especially important to strike with the new ball.
 
155th over: England 459-9 (Dawson 58, Ball 2) Dawson is content to sweep 
Ashwin’s first ball for a single and give the strike to Jake Ball. I’ve never 
been sure about that approach, not even when Steve Waugh did it every second 
innings against England. Two from t’over.
 
154th over: England 456-9 (Dawson 57, Ball 1) Jake Ball is the new batsman, 
and he’s almost the old batsman when he inside-edges Jadeja just wide of leg 
stump.

“Hi,” says Paul Moody. “I’m in kampot ,Cambodia, wondering where next? 
Following ,your wise words as England try and get their former dead rubber 
title back. Re: Jardine and Verity,either would make a partnership seem more 
catchy or steadfast.”


What about Jardine and Dyer

’s Washing Machines?
 
I love the smell of farce in the morning. Broad has been run out after a 
mix-up with Dawson and some excellent work from KL Rahul on the fine-leg 
boundary.
 
153rd over: England 453-8 (Dawson 55, Broad 17) Ashwin, from around the 
wicket, turns one sharply to hit the pad as Dawson works across the line. 
Marais Erasmus says not out but India are going to review. I think this turned 
too much. Indeed it did, and it bounced too much as well.
 
152nd over: England 453-8 (Dawson 56, Broad 17) Hello again, my worthy 
children. Ravindra Jadeja is going to start after tea, with Liam Dawson 45 runs 
away from one of Test cricket’s more unlikely fairytales. Make that 44; he has 
just pushed a single into the off side.
 
151st over: England 452-8 (Dawson 55, Broad 17) That’s tea. It was a sleepy 
session but a good one for England, who lost just Adil Rashid for a bright 60. 
Liam Dawson made a calm half-century on debut, and England are slowly inching 
towards a position of safety. See you in 15 minutes for the final session!
 
150th over: England 452-8 (Dawson 55, Broad 17) Jadeja misses a run-out chance 
when Broad is sent back by Dawson. His throw seemed to be on target but it hit 
a footmark and bounced miles over the stumps. Dawson then drives the new bowler 
Ishant for a decidedly pleasant boundary.
 
149th over: England 448-8 (Dawson 51, Broad 17) Broad misses a vile hack at 
Ashwin, with the ball skidding past leg stump and through Parthiv Patel for 
three byes. Actually they were given as runs, so maybe there was an under-edge; 
yes, the replay shows there was, and that he would have been bowled without the 
deflection. Great shot! Broad, who is here for a good time rather than a long 
time, clouts four over extra cover to move to 17 from 12 balls.
 
148th over: England 440-8 (Dawson 50, Broad 10) Broad half-edges, half-steers 
Umesh to third man for his first boundary.
 
147th over: England 435-8 (Dawson 50, Broad 5) Dawson drives Ashwin for a 
single to reach an impressive, temperatehalf-century on debut. He’s faced 121 
balls and hit four fours. Good lad.

“I slightly worry that Jennings is the new Frank Hayes,” says Ian Forth. 
“Older readers may not recall Frank but he scored an attractive ton on debut 
against the West Indies in, naturally, a losing cause in 1973. Then got just 
122 runs over the course of eight more Tests, admittedly all against the 
powerful West Indies of the time. Hoping I’m wrong and he is in fact the new 
Graham Thorpe.”

I think he looks really promising, though whether he starts the Test series 
next summer I’m not sure – it’s probably him at No3 or Moeen at No5.
 
146th over: England 430-8 (Dawson 49, Broad 1) Broad misses a mercifully wide 
yorker first ball, which sneaks under his bat but wide of off stump. The days 
of Broad being compared to Sir Garry Sobers are long gone: in Tests this year 
he averages 8.33.

“You mentioned the 100 partnership, which it seems (TMS aver) is now the best 
eighth-wicket for England in India,” says John Starbuck. “Mind you, Dawson & 
Rashid doesn’t ring quite the same as Jardine & Verity. Rather more mundane, 
but maybe a little earthier?” Yes, Jardine & Verity sounds like a cravat shop 
in a Poirot film.

 
Oh dear. Rashid falls one short of his highest Test score, slashing outside 
off stump and edging through to Parthiv Patel. That was a fine innings though.
 
145th over: England 429-7 (Dawson 49, Rashid 60) Ashwin has switched ends and 
starts around the wicket to Rashid, who glides a couple more to third man. It’s 
been a story of wrist and reward for Rashid, who has played some really lovely 
strokes. England are batting with such comfort on such a benign pitch that both 
these players may never have a better chance to reach a Test hundred.
 
144th over: England 424-7 (Dawson 47, Rashid 57) The lively Umesh Yadav 
replaces Ashwin, and does nothing that will be remembered in 10 minutes’ time.

“This situation calls for a bit of creative captaincy,” says Kimberley 
Thonger. “Declare on 550 when Dawson and Rashid both have their hundreds. Then, 
pack the infield and bowl underarm from both ends, all day. With this slow 
outfield it will take India three days to reach our total. Voilà, we have a 
draw, which will seem like a victory.” If it wasn’t for those pesky laws of the 
game…
 
143rd over: England 422-7 (Dawson 47, Rashid 56) Rashid drives Jadeja through 
extra cover to reach a chipper half-century from 141 balls, and then squeezes 
another boundary through point. This is lovely batting. That boundary brings up 
the hundred partnership.
 
142nd over: England 416-7 (Dawson 47, Rashid 46) Rashid survives a run-out 
referral after a marvellous piece of fielding from Jadeja. Dawson flicked the 
new bowler to Ashwin to mid-on, where Jadeja collected the ball and fired in a 
row for Ashwin to break the stumps. Rashid had been backing up but was able to 
slide his bat in safely.
 
141st over: England 410-7 (Dawson 46, Rashid 45) England will know they aren’t 
immune from defeat - not with 400, probably not with 500, so there is unlikely 
to be a push for a declaration any time soon. They are scoring fluently enough 
now anyway, particularly Rashid.

“I saw talk among OBOers of Batty being our best spinner, before it turned out 
he was truly stuck in the 1980s and even voted for Thatcher at the last 
referendum,” says Ian Copestake. “Now our latest debut centurion opener is in 
fact a golden duck walking. This is post-truth cricket at its most infuriating.”
 
140th over: England 410-7 (Dawson 46, Rashid 45)  Poor old Mishra, who has a 
series average of 79, goes round the wicket and induces a false stroke from 
Dawson, a top-edged sweep that lands safely between short fine leg and fine 
leg. Rashid then drives expansively through the covers for three. He plays some 
extremely good-looking strokes.
 
139th over: England 404-7 (Dawson 44, Rashid 41) “Exciting news from 
Yorkshire!” says John Starbuck. “It’s Dawn! in a near-cloudless sky! Conditions 
are probably a bit different where you are. And in Chennai.”
 
138th over: England 403-7 (Dawson 43, Rashid 41) Dawson drives Mishra 
comfortably for a single, and then Rashid chips wristily over midwicket for 
four to bring up the 400. Lovely shot. These two have played really well, 
though that observation is accompanied by the thought: what will Virat do on 
here?

“Top of the morning to you, guvnor,” says Ian Copestake. “This pitch is so 
mauve. We don’t know what it’s planning.”A Liam Dawson spin-bowling 
masterclass, that’s what it’s planning, pal.
