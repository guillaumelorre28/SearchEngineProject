The Fruitmarket Gallery

Since it opened in a former fruit and vegetable market behind Waverley railway 
sation in 1974 , the Fruitmarket has become a significant showcase for 
international contemporary art. For those who find what’s on offer a little 
challenging, the bookshop has art and the local area as its focus, and there’s 
a cafe to mull things over, or just enjoy the view from the windows that run 
along one side.

Come armed with coins to drop in slots and bring to life Sweeney Todd and 
other less-gruesome mechanical diversions that are part of a collection of 
childhood toys and games that, though small, is wide in scope – with Blue Peter 
annuals, teddy bears, a miniature butcher’s shop and a 21-room doll’s house. A 
gift shop is stocked with keenly priced novelties – flying dinosaurs, bouncing 
putty, plastic animal sound toys – that will presumably find their way into the 
collection in due course.

Armchair Books 

Despite occupying two linked retail units, this secondhand bookshop is locked 
in a battle between inventory and space. Books are piled so high and packed so 
tight that the only resting place for browsers is a cautious perch atop still 
more stacks. Bibliophiles would do well to keep looking – treasures are 
lurking, with the non-fiction section particularly strong.

Herman Brown vintage clothes shop

In contrast to many vintage clothes shops, here you don’t have to dig through 
piles of musty cast-offs to find the good stuff – that’s done for you before 
items reach the rails. What remains is a compact, careful arrangement, mostly 
for women but with a small section for men, too. Stock is from the recent and 
the distant past, all of good quality and in excellent condition. An inspection 
revealed items from high street brands and small, chic labels.

Modest and slightly shabby in appearance, the defining characteristic in here 
is the tang of whisky in the air. Large quantities sit in the shop’s own casks, 
growing older and more delicious with each passing day. Buy direct from the 
cask or choose from the large range of bottles – a daunting task for the 
novice, but ask nicely and advice will be forthcoming. Unless a trip to one of 
the distilleries is on your itinerary, this is as close to the source as you’re 
likely to get.

It’s easy to hurry past this modest shopfront, unaware that within is 
Scotland’s oldest Italian deli, a huge, high-ceilinged space stacked to the 
rafters with an abundance of cheese, salumi, pasta and wine from the old 
country and elsewhere. Way at the back is a bookshop and cafe that’s open all 
day serving dishes made from their own produce – porridge with set honey, 
though hardly Italian, is a particular treat on a blustery day.

L’Alba D’Oro

A feature of the culinary landscape since the 1970s, this family-run chippy is 
widely regarded as the city’s best. Fish and chips is a simple dish in theory, 
but notoriously hard to perfect – all we ask is that a crisp golden batter 
keeps in the natural moisture of the fish, and that’s what you get here. Things 
can get a little fancy if you’re so inclined, with specials including monkfish, 
sea bass and halibut. There’s even a pudding option – black, white or haggis – 
or you can get back to basics with a chip buttie (£2.25) and a pot of curry 
sauce.

The Mosque Kitchen

Paper plates, plastic cutlery and canteen-style service keep prices way down 
here, which means that, at £5, chicken curry with two vegetables and rice is 
the most expensive dish on the menu. Functional but bustling and lively, the 
Mosque Kitchen is an excellent place to pause for a fortification on a chilly 
day.

When the tide is out, it’s possible to stride out along the causeway into the 
Firth of Forth and head for this little island. It’s just one-third of a mile 
long but dotted with places of interest both natural and manmade: there are the 
remains of a Roman settlement and second world war fortifications – most 
visibly the dragon’s teeth coastal submarine defences alongside the causeway.
