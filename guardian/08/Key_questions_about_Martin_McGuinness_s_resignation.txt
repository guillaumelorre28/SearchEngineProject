Why has nearly 10 years of power-sharing between the old foes of Sinn Féin and 
theDemocratic Unionist party (DUP) <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dup> 
been imperilled?
The irony of this crisis is that it centres not on traditional issues of 
dispute, such as the constitutional status of Northern Ireland or even how the 
power-sharing government deals with the legacy of the Troubles and nearly 4,000 
deaths. Instead, the administration has come crashing down because of the “cash 
for ash” affair.

What is “cash for ash”?
In 2012 the DUP devised a green energy scheme called the renewable heating 
initiative to encourage non-domestic consumers to use green energy such as wood 
pellets to heat farms, businesses and other enterprises.

Why was it such a disaster?
The scheme offered £1.60 for every £1 spent by farmers and other non-domestic 
users if they signed up for the green initiative. It soon became apparent that 
there had been a massive miscalculation of the cost of the scheme, which some 
estimates now reckon will cost the taxpayer close to £500m in lost revenue.

Why did it cause such a political furore?
Opposition parties ranging from the Ulster Unionists to Sinn Féin’s 
nationalist rivals in the Social Democratic and Labour party called for an 
independent inquiry into the fiasco and asked that the first minister, Arlene 
Foster, stand down temporarily while it was held.Sinn Féin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sinn-fein>, the DUP’s sole partner in 
coalition government, came under intense pressure to act.

Will an election clear the air?
If past results are replicated the DUP and Sinn Féin will still end up as the 
two largest parties, but the game-changer might be that the republican party 
emerges bigger than its unionist rival. In that case, a Sinn Féin assembly 
member could be elected for the first time as first minister as the DUP may 
ship votes and lose seats to their Ulster Unionist competitors.

Will an election naturally lead to a new power-sharing/cross-community 
government?
Not necessarily, given the bitterness between Sinn Féin and the DUP. It may 
take a long series of post-election negotiations to rebuild trust and recast a 
new coalition government, which inevitably would involve the two big parties.

Will a collapse of power-sharing and a fresh election destabilise the peace in 
Northern Ireland?
While dissident republicans will rejoice, hoping to inflict some damage at the 
ballot box to Sinn Féin and claiming that the dysfunctional relationship 
between Sinn Féin and the DUP proves Northern Ireland is a failed state, this 
crisis will not fatally undermine the peace process. An overwhelming majority 
of people on all sides inNorthern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> support the peace settlement 
and do not want a resumption of Troubles-style violence.
