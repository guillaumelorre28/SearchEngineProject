Corey Lewandowski, president-elect Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, has 
reportedly resigned from his cushy position at CNN in order to take a job 
within the new administration,according to CNN itself 
<http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/11/media/corey-lewandowski-resigns-cnn/index.html>
.

Lewandowski was hired as a commentator a reported half-million dollar salary 
just three days after he was pushed out of the campaign, following assault 
allegations made by a campaign reporter that were later substantiated by 
videotape.

Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, has long defended the network’s decision to 
hire Lewandowski as a commentator, despite the fact that Lewandowski continued 
to draw payments from the campaign during his tenure at the cable news network.

“I think it’s really important to have voices on CNN who are supportive of the 
Republican nominee,”Zucker told Variety in August.  
<http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/jeff-zucker-cnn-fox-news-1201827824/>“It’s 
hard to find a lot of those. Our competitors tried to hire him too.”

Former House speaker and potential Trump cabinet secretary Newt Gingrich 
reportedly told reporters today that in all likelihood,Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> will not be able to get 
Mexico to “pay for The Wall,” as he told his supporters he would do, but that 
the rhetoric was “a great campaign device.”

“He may not spend much time trying to get Mexico to pay for it,” Gingrich said 
<http://theweek.com/speedreads/661335/newt-gingrich-admits-trump-probably-cant-mexico-pay-wall-but-great-campaign-device>
, of Trump’s proposed 2,000-mile wall along the US Southern border. “But it was 
a great campaign device.”

“He knows how to build big buildings,” though, Gingrich continued, which is 
almost as good. “He knows how to build golf courses. He knows how to build lots 
of stuff. The idea that Trump can’t figure out how to control the southern 
border is just silly.”

Perhaps no other building has shot from irrelevance to epicenter as quickly as 
Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan.

Following Donald J Trump’s shock of a winning campaign, the home of the 
president-elect has drawn to its doorstep the full presidential protection 
apparatus, as well as both sides of a deeply divided nation.

“He’s a male chauvinist, a fucking rapist!” yelled a woman, streaming the 
experience to the world on her phone. “Fuck Trump!”

“’Scuse me! There are kids here,” another woman yelled, looking harried as she 
pushed through the crowd with a stroller, a tiny hand grasping hers.


A circus of protesters, supporters, tourists, gawkers and New Yorkers just 
trying to get where they were going formed in front of Trump’s home by the end 
of the week. Pedestrian traffic rivaled Times Square, as police arbitrarily 
cordoned off corners. Press were kept in a pen.

A uniformed cop adjusting barricades remarked: “This building was never 
important until just a couple days ago.”

The gray-glassed skyscraper on 56th Street and 5th Avenue was, on Monday, just 
a tower of steel built atop Gucci and Tiffany & Company stores. By Wednesday, 
it became the site of protests and pleas, rancor and adulation. The stink of a 
bitter campaign lingered over the building.

“Trump eat shit!” yelled one passerby. Another yelled back, “What about Bill 
Clinton?” his phone raised above the crowd.

Thiel’s involvement in a Trump administration has been the subject of frenzied 
speculation in Silicon Valley, where the businessman was the sole prominent 
advocate for the divisive Republican candidate.


On Wednesday, Thiel told the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html>
 that he would not move to Washington or seek a seat on the supreme court, but 
said: “I’ll try to help the president in any way I can.”


It is not known what role Thiel will play in the transition team. The 
transition team and Thiel’s representatives did not respond to requests for 
further details. But it is likely that he will be expected to help the 
president-elect build bridges with Silicon Valley, a place where Barack Obama is
hugely popular 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/24/barack-obama-mark-zuckerberg-startups-conference>
 and where many people regard Trump with either distrust or outright disdain.


Thiel’s vocal and financial support of Trump made him an outlier in the 
largely socially liberal world of Silicon Valley. While other tech CEOs and 
venture capitalists railed against Trump’s aggressive xenophobia, anti-free 
trade saber-rattling and threats to individual companies such as Apple and 
Amazon, Thiel delivered a keynote address at the Republican national convention 
in July anddonated $1.25m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/17/project-include-y-combinator-donald-trump-peter-thiel>
 to support Trump’s campaign.

“I build companies and I’m supporting people who are building new things, from 
social networks to rocket ships,” he said at the convention. “I’m not a 
politician. But neither isDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>. He is a builder, and it’s 
time to rebuild America.”

Barack Obama laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National 
Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and, referencing the recent elections, told those 
in attendance that Americans are not a people of isolationism, but instead 
unite despite their differences. The US president said the nation’s veterans 
embody “principles that are more enduring than transitory politics.”

Trump: 'I want a country that loves each other'

In his first interview since becoming president-elect, Donald Trump tells the 
Wall Street journal 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-willing-to-keep-parts-of-health-law-1478895339>
 that he wants to preserve important pieces of the president’s health care law 
– the ban on coverage denial for pre-existing conditions and the ability for 
kids up to 26 to stay on parents’ plans.

“I like those very much,” Mr. Trump said in the interview. 


The piece continues:

After a bitter campaign in which he came under criticism for his harsh and 
angry rhetoric, and a postelection period marked byanti-Trump protests 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/anti-trump-protests-turn-violent-in-oregon-1478885999>
 in numerous cities, Mr. Trump said he is placing a high priority on bringing 
the country together.

“I want a country that loves each other,” Mr. Trump said. “I want to stress 
that.” He said the best way to ease tension would be to “bring in jobs.”

Asked whether he thought his rhetoric had gone too far in the campaign, the 
president-elect responded: “No. I won.”

Leading Democrats began their fightback against President-elect Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as they accused him of 
unleashing the “forces of hate and bigotry” and warned that America’s enemies 
were exultant at his election win.

As tens of thousands of Americans plan further protests and acts of dissent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/anti-trump-protests-election-president-new-york-chicago>
 against the election of Trump, Democratic politicians have begun to echo the 
defiance seen on the streets of major cities from New York to Oakland that has 
sparked dozens of arrests.

Thousands were on the streets on Thursday in Denver, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, 
Portland, Oakland and dozens more US cities and although the protests were 
smaller and more muted, there were scattered acts of civil disobedience and 
damage to property.

Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have been measured in their language in 
keeping with the traditions of the post-election period of transition between 
administrations.

But Harry Reid, departing as the most senior Democrat in the Senate, issued a 
blistering statement 
<http://www.reid.senate.gov/press_releases/2016-11-11-reid-statement-on-the-election-of-donald-trump>
 on Friday, warning thatadversaries at home and abroad are jubilant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/islamic-extremists-welcome-donald-trump-victory>
 and calling on Trump to take responsibility for healing the nation.

“The election of Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>
 has emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America,” the veteran Nevada 
senator said. “White nationalists, Vladimir Putin and Isis are celebrating 
Donald Trump’s victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are racked with 
fear.”

This was particularly true for black, Hispanic, Muslim, LGBT and Asian 
Americans, Reid added. “Watching white nationalists celebrate while innocent 
Americans cry tears of fear does not feel like America.”

Corey Lewandowski, president-elect Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, has 
reportedly resigned from his cushy position at CNN in order to take a job 
within the new administration,according to CNN itself 
<http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/11/media/corey-lewandowski-resigns-cnn/index.html>
.

Lewandowski was hired as a commentator a reported half-million dollar salary 
just three days after he was pushed out of the campaign, following assault 
allegations made by a campaign reporter that were later substantiated by 
videotape.

Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, has long defended the network’s decision to 
hire Lewandowski as a commentator, despite the fact that Lewandowski continued 
to draw payments from the campaign during his tenure at the cable news network.

“I think it’s really important to have voices on CNN who are supportive of the 
Republican nominee,”Zucker told Variety in August.  
<http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/jeff-zucker-cnn-fox-news-1201827824/>“It’s 
hard to find a lot of those. Our competitors tried to hire him too.”
 
Former House speaker and potential Trump cabinet secretary Newt Gingrich 
reportedly told reporters today that in all likelihood,Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> will not be able to get 
Mexico to “pay for The Wall,” as he told his supporters he would do, but that 
the rhetoric was “a great campaign device.”

“He may not spend much time trying to get Mexico to pay for it,” Gingrich said 
<http://theweek.com/speedreads/661335/newt-gingrich-admits-trump-probably-cant-mexico-pay-wall-but-great-campaign-device>
, of Trump’s proposed 2,000-mile wall along the US Southern border. “But it was 
a great campaign device.”

“He knows how to build big buildings,” though, Gingrich continued, which is 
almost as good. “He knows how to build golf courses. He knows how to build lots 
of stuff. The idea that Trump can’t figure out how to control the southern 
border is just silly.”

Perhaps no other building has shot from irrelevance to epicenter as quickly as 
Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan.

Following Donald J Trump’s shock of a winning campaign, the home of the 
president-elect has drawn to its doorstep the full presidential protection 
apparatus, as well as both sides of a deeply divided nation.

“He’s a male chauvinist, a fucking rapist!” yelled a woman, streaming the 
experience to the world on her phone. “Fuck Trump!”

“’Scuse me! There are kids here,” another woman yelled, looking harried as she 
pushed through the crowd with a stroller, a tiny hand grasping hers.


A circus of protesters, supporters, tourists, gawkers and New Yorkers just 
trying to get where they were going formed in front of Trump’s home by the end 
of the week. Pedestrian traffic rivaled Times Square, as police arbitrarily 
cordoned off corners. Press were kept in a pen.

A uniformed cop adjusting barricades remarked: “This building was never 
important until just a couple days ago.”

The gray-glassed skyscraper on 56th Street and 5th Avenue was, on Monday, just 
a tower of steel built atop Gucci and Tiffany & Company stores. By Wednesday, 
it became the site of protests and pleas, rancor and adulation. The stink of a 
bitter campaign lingered over the building.

“Trump eat shit!” yelled one passerby. Another yelled back, “What about Bill 
Clinton?” his phone raised above the crowd.

Barack Obama laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National 
Cemetery to mark Veterans Day and, referencing the recent elections, told those 
in attendance that Americans are not a people of isolationism, but instead 
unite despite their differences. The US president said the nation’s veterans 
embody “principles that are more enduring than transitory politics.”

In his first interview since becoming president-elect, Donald Trump tells the 
Wall Street journal 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-willing-to-keep-parts-of-health-law-1478895339>
 that he wants to preserve important pieces of the president’s health care law 
– the ban on coverage denial for pre-existing conditions and the ability for 
kids up to 26 to stay on parents’ plans.

“I like those very much,” Mr. Trump said in the interview. 


The piece continues:

After a bitter campaign in which he came under criticism for his harsh and 
angry rhetoric, and a postelection period marked byanti-Trump protests 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/anti-trump-protests-turn-violent-in-oregon-1478885999>
 in numerous cities, Mr. Trump said he is placing a high priority on bringing 
the country together.

“I want a country that loves each other,” Mr. Trump said. “I want to stress 
that.” He said the best way to ease tension would be to “bring in jobs.”

Asked whether he thought his rhetoric had gone too far in the campaign, the 
president-elect responded: “No. I won.”
 
Leading Democrats began their fightback against President-elect Donald Trump

unleashing the “forces of hate and bigotry” and warned that America’s enemies 
were exultant at his election win.

As tens of thousands of Americans plan further protests and acts of dissent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/anti-trump-protests-election-president-new-york-chicago>
 against the election of Trump, Democratic politicians have begun to echo the 
defiance seen on the streets of major cities from New York to Oakland that has 
sparked dozens of arrests.

Thousands were on the streets on Thursday in Denver, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, 
Portland, Oakland and dozens more US cities and although the protests were 
smaller and more muted, there were scattered acts of civil disobedience and 
damage to property.

Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have been measured in their language in 
keeping with the traditions of the post-election period of transition between 
administrations.

But Harry Reid, departing as the most senior Democrat in the Senate, issued a 
blistering statement 
<http://www.reid.senate.gov/press_releases/2016-11-11-reid-statement-on-the-election-of-donald-trump>
 on Friday, warning thatadversaries at home and abroad are jubilant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/islamic-extremists-welcome-donald-trump-victory>
 and calling on Trump to take responsibility for healing the nation.

“The election of Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>
 has emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America,” the veteran Nevada 
senator said. “White nationalists, Vladimir Putin and Isis are celebrating 
Donald Trump’s victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are racked with 
fear.”

This was particularly true for black, Hispanic, Muslim, LGBT and Asian 
Americans, Reid added. “Watching white nationalists celebrate while innocent 
Americans cry tears of fear does not feel like America.”
