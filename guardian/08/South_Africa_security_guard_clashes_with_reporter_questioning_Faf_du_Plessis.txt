Du Plessis is expected to play the third Test against Australia because a 
hearing won’t take place until the tourists’ legal representative arrives from 
South Africa. It appears unlikely that will happen before the day-night Test 
starts at Adelaide Oval on Thursday.

On Monday, Zunaid Wadee, who looks after the Proteas’ security, was attempting 
to shield Du Plessis from questions regarding the mint controversy when he 
physically clashed with Nine Network reporter Will Crouch.

Wadee shoved, shoulder charged and knocked a microphone from Crouch’s hands. 
He then forcibly shoved Crouch against a glass door as Du Plessis, smiling and 
giving a thumbs up, left the building.

Crouch walked away from the scrap unharmed, while Du Plessis refused to 
comment.

“Disappointed. Such provocative behaviour from reporters. Let a man walk in 
peace. Ask with manners n courtesy and u prob will get a response,” Proteas 
batsman Hashim Amla posted on Twitter.

Du Plessis, who is facing a one-Test ban, is yet to speak since being charged 
by the InternationalCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Council 
after allegedly using a mint to induce swing in the second Test against 
Australia.

Zunaid is a security specialist who regularly travels with the Proteas. He is 
the “chief close protection operative” of Zans & Associates, having also worked 
for the President and CEO of Coca Cola, CEO of Zurich Financial Services, 
Chevron Texaco and Oprah.
