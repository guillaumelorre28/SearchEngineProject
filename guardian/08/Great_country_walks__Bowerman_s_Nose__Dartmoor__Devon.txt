The wind suddenly picked up and the drizzle turned to a squall. All we could 
see ahead were rocky outcrops, slanting rain, a murky void of greyness. It was 
like wading through a dense mist. Then, in the dim morning light, I spied a 
shape, a skinny, black form, coming towards us, quickly, keenly… it grew bigger 
and yet bigger and its long tongue lolled around its strangely smiling mouth. 
It was a big black dog.


This is all true, though it was actually a cute pointing griffon, a hairy 
hound that seemed to love gambolling around in the rain. But it was more than 
apt, as we were half an hour into a wonderful 10-mile circular walk from the 
picture-postcard village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor and only a short distance 
from Hounds Tor, said to have inspiredArthur Conan Doyle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/arthurconandoyle> to pen his most famous 
Holmes story,The Hound of the Baskervilles.

The going at first was easy, down a country lane – we skirted two local pubs 
here, the Old Inn and the Rugglestone Inn – and up along the side of a pretty 
stream. Then came a climb past a hamlet called Bonehill to cross boggy 
grassland to the spot where we met the fluffy dog.

The path cut through damp, dead bracken, then the tamed landscape of Holwell 
Lawn and a pony club field littered with cross-country jumps. It was time for 
coffee and a snack. We were only at around 1,200 feet above sea level, but the 
cloud had momentarily cleared and the temperature dropped. We sought shelter 
behind a drystone wall. There are hundreds of miles of these criss-crossing 
Dartmoor, lumpier and untidier than their Yorkshire equivalents – perhaps they 
need to be sturdier to deal with the extremes of temperature and westerlies 
that blow in from the Atlantic. The first rock formation was Greator Rocks, a 
smallish, spiky affair that reminded me of the plates on a stegosaurus’ back. A 
rainbow appeared from nowhere – Dartmoor weather is delightfully changeable – 
and its arc seemed to plunge into the next outcrop. Ten minutes up a gentle 
incline and we were beneath Hounds Tor. This was much more impressive, with 
groups of stacks, boulders and clefts spread out over a wide area. Just beyond 
these two outcrops were the stone traces of a Saxon village, Hundatora, surely 
behind the name of Hounds Tor.

 Thge Rugglestone Inn, Widecombe-in-the-Moor,: ideal for hearty steaks, and a 
well-earned pint 
The descent led us to a car park and across a road where we reached a grave 
covered in flowers and wreaths, though bereft of a tombstone. It was the grave 
of Kitty Jay, a pauper’s daughter who was in service at the house of a local 
landowner in 1790. She fell pregnant to the son of the household and was cast 
out by the family. The poor woman hanged herself. The good people of the parish 
determined that she was unworthy of burial in consecrated ground. They chose 
the roadside spot, not only as an insult but because it was on the edge of town 
and they thought it prudent if her ghost was kept a good way from living souls.

A beautiful bridleway guided us over a hill, from which there were lovely 
views back down a valley that leads to Widecombe (there’s a road here, 
providing a handy short cut for those who want to limit their walk to a 
five-miler). The path continued by a stand of conifers clad in moss, alive with 
robins, nuthatches and small flocks of starlings, then up on to a great muscle 
of treeless moorland.

Grimspound is, for many, one of the star attractions of Dartmoor. The name 
derives from the Norse god Grim (also known as Odin) but the site, which 
comprises the remains of 24 stone huts, was settled as early as the 14th 
century BC. It’s quite a thought, and the tall stones serve as a gateway to 
Hamel Down, our final stretch of wide-open moorland before descending into 
Widecombe in the Moor and the cosyRugglestone Inn 
<http://www.rugglestoneinn.co.uk/> for hearty steaks, and a well-earned pint of 
local ale.
