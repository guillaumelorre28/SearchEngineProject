The Arts Council’s Beckmann exhibition at the Tate Gallery (until November 7) 
presents one of the few really significant figurative painters of this century. 
Beckmann, a German who died in 1950 at the age of 66, had a disrupted but quite 
successful career. Two world wars, Nazi attacks on all but the most cringing 
art, a lonely decade in Amsterdam followed by emigration to the United States, 
these external events certainly impinged on his work, but they did not inhibit 
it. The opposite would be truer. The complacency of his 1907 self-portrait, 
affronting you as you enter, was quite wiped off him by the First World War. 
The mature painter emerges in his paintings of 1917.

He spoke of “expressing my ego” but he does not fit the Expressionist label. 
In the mid-twenties he was in fact seen as the dominant figure in an 
anti-Expressionist movement, the New Objectivity. This was due partly to the 
directness of his representations and partly to the element of social protest 
people saw in them. But objectivity normally implies some degree of realism, 
and while Beckmann paints scenes that are easily readable as consisting of 
people and things in varying situations, their content is far from obvious and 
requires us to give the fullest rein to our powers of intuitive comprehension. 
Some of his symbols are clear; others become clear through reappearing.Art 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art> can also communicate through 
something logically impossible: a symbol which has definable meaning neither to 
the artist nor to the spectator and yet strikes home with a force that is far 
from meaningless. Beckmann is best described as a symbolical painter.

Once he had established his personal style Beckmann modulated it only through 
a relatively narrow range. The most important outside contribution to it came 
from German late Gothic painting. He adopted its clear outlines, its strong 
verticals and its jagged forms. He stressed its spacelessness, bricking up his 
picture space with form upon form.

This involves him in constructions of an almost Cubist kind, and in other 
respects too there are comparisons to be drawn between his art and Picasso’s. 
There is a Nordic enclosedness about most of Beckmann’s pictures that I found 
more and more oppressive but he can be surprisingly expansive at times. In one 
picture, the splendid “Departure” triptych of 1932-3, he manages both.

Beckmann was not a gay person. But he was tough, in himself as well as in 
appearance. As his diaries show, he was as sceptical of the bad things as the 
good things in life. In spite of all their attention to the dark forces in man, 
I sense in his paintings an insistence on life and warmth. And this, 
miraculously, comes out most strongly in his pictures of the Amsterdam years, 
when he lived as an exile through war and deprivations, suffering from a heart 
complaint (to which he referred as “Perky”) and listening to the bombers 
overhead. I suspect that great art cannot exist without a substructure of 
optimism, and at times Beckmann comes very close to making great pictures.

This exhibition was organised for the Museum of Modern Art, New York, by Peter 
Selz who has also prepared an excellent monograph on the artist. This can be 
bought at the exhibition in paper covers at 32s 6d hard covers £4.
