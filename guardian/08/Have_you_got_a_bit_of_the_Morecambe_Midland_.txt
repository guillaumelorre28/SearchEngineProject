"It rises from the sea like a great white ship, gracefully curved," wrote Lord 
Clonmore <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howard,_8th_Earl_of_Wicklow> in 
theArchitectural Review, when that wonder of Morecambe, the Midland Hotel, 
received its first guests in 1933.

It still does, whiter and cleaner than for years after renovation by Urban 
Splash <http://www.urbansplash.co.uk/>; albeit the developers' hopes of new 
building nearby have theFriends of the Midland 
<http://www.midlandhotel.org/index.html> up in action.

The hotel is now getting ready for its 80th birthday, and hoping that former 
guests or their families and descendants may be able to contribute memories, 
letters or bits and bobs such as writing paper taken from bedroom folders or 
soap from bathrooms, for a commemorative exhibition. There is much to go on. In 
its golden age in the late 1930s, when the Depression and very slow recovery 
kept many wealthy holidaymakers in the UK rather than on the Riviera, streams 
of famous names came and stayed.
 This way to the high jinks. The hotel's entrance. 
Country Life described the sweeping spiral leading to upper floors as "a fairy 
staircase which one would willingly climb until it reached Heaven." The décor 
was in keeping, with sculpture byEric Gill <http://www.ericgill.org.uk/>, 
murals byEric Ravilious 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/apr/30/eric-ravilious-painting-landscape-watercolour>
 and textiles byMartha Dorn

. The architectOliver Hill  
<http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RoyalGoldMedal/175Exhibition/SlippedThrough/OliverHill.aspx>
designed everything down to the towels and doorhandles, whose details 
compensated for what those with memories of florid Victoriana considered the 
'austere' modern style.

The hotel, whose inapposite name comes from the old London Midland and 
Scottish Railway which commissioned it, was also the summer seat of plutocrats 
from Bradford, and in my cub reporter days my newspaper theBradford Telegraph & 
Argus <http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/>opened a summer office there.

Their artistic tastes led to the toning down of Gill's original designs for 
the entrance lounge bas-relief. Entitled 'High Jinks in Paradise' this showed 
discomfortingly large numbers of naked youths and girls prancing around; it was 
changed to the more Bradfordian 'Odysseus welcomed from the Sea by Nausicaa', 
with the princess offering the naked adventurer a set of (no doubt worsted) 
clothes.
 The most modern hotel in the world when it opened in 1933. 
The hotel was admired all over the world, a welcome boost for Morecambe which 
has since been repeated by the restoration and, to a cosy extent, the siting of
Graham Ibbeson <http://www.grahamibbeson.com/>'s Sunshine Dance statue of Eric 
Morecambe nearby. The Midland's general manager Matt Stanaway is now hoping for 
as many mementos as possible: snaps of Coco Chanel, Wallis Simpson or Noel 
Coward, maybe; or menus stashed away with the homegoing buckets and spades. He 
says:

The sort of things we are looking for are photographs, letters and postcards 
from the golden era of the 1930s, as well as other items such as original 
towels, napkins, cutlery and menus. Anything really which former guests might 
have kept for sentimental or nostalgic reasons to celebrate or record their 
time at The Midland.
 
It has always been a fabulous venue for parties, balls and weddings, as well 
as an historic destination for honeymoons and family holidays.  We're just as 
keen to hear from people who have a story or specific memory about 
The Midland which they would like to share.

Anything lent will be returned after the anniversary exhibition, even if it 
shouldn't have been taken in the first place.
