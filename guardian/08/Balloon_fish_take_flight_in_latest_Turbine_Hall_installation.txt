There are inflatable fish toys, lights that go on and then fizzle out, music 
segments ranging from Dvořák to the Beatles, films, snippets of Radio 2 travel 
bulletins, the sound of heavy rain and passing aeroplanes – and all of it might 
occasionally be influenced by a colony of micro-organic yeast.

The artist Philippe Parreno admitted there was an awful lot going on as he 
unveiled his Hyundai commission forTate Modern’s vast Turbine Hall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tate-modern>.

Called Anywhen, the French artist has created a constantly evolving, 
audiovisual, kaleidoscopic exhibition rather than an installation.

On the Turbine Hall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tate-modern-turbine-hall> floor is a 
vast carpet that visitors can lie on to experience sounds and visuals that 
change constantly.

“We have a lot of stuff,” said Parreno. “There may be a pattern after some 
time, but at the moment it is quite random.”

Parreno said visitors might feel as if they were in a park. Who knows what you 
might see or hear? And there was no manual for how people might react to his 
kaleidoscope of things: they could lie down and contemplate memory or the 
environment or they could throw a helium-filled fish into the air.

“There is no authority in the way you look at art here,” said Parreno. “It is 
not like cinema where you have a structure which takes you from one place to 
another.”

Parreno is the latest artist to fill the huge and challenging Turbine Hall 
space. Previous artists include Ai Weiwei, who deposited millions of ceramic 
sunflower seeds,Carsten Höller, who installed slides 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/carsten-holler>, and Doris Salcedo, 
who created an enormous crack in the floor.

Tate Modern’s director, Frances Morris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/16/tate-modern-director-frances-morris-interview>
, said she had thought Turbine Hall commission artists had already fully 
exploited the possibilities of the space. But she added: “It feels to me that 
Philippe Parreno has built and seen through and created something which would 
have been inconceivable when we first thought about the Turbine Hall project in 
2000.”

Morris said it felt like a new space now that the hall was sandwiched between 
the old boiler house and the £260mSwitch House extension 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jun/14/tate-modern-switch-house-review-brain-fizzing-art-pyramid>
.

There is a structure to the many things going in Parreno’s work – but also a 
randomness, with a weather monitor on the roof and a bio reactor containing a 
colony of yeast also influencing what happens.

Parreno himself will add sequences and films over the duration of the 
exhibition. “Six months is quite a long time, lots of time to change things,” 
he said.

Not even the work’s title is set in stone; Parreno was originally calling it 
Thereabouts, adding: “I like both of them, maybe we will change the title in a 
few months.”
