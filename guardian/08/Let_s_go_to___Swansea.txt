New BrewStone <http://brewstone.co.uk/> specialises in wood-fired food (pulled 
pork pizza, slow-roast beef), and the retroGower Kitchen 
<http://gowerkitchen.com/> has an all-day menu of Welsh comfort food.
Grape & Olive <http://swansea.grapeandolive.co.uk/> is at the top of the 
Meridian Tower, the tallest building in Wales, but the food doesn’t quite live 
up to the views – the bargain set lunch (£11 for two courses) is a better bet 
than dinner.

How about a drink?

and its soon-to-open basement gin joint will serve 170 types.The Westbourne
