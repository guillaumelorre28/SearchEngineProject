The first and only vice-presidential debate of 2016 is in the can. Here’s what 
happened:

 * It was punchy, not a bit flat, it moved fast, covered a lot of policy 
ground, and featured Virginia senator Tim Kaine going after Donald Trump’s 
jugular like a bloodthirsty terrier while Indiana governor Mike Pence 
projected, mostly, a demeanor of steely calm and determined focus. 
 * Pence was criticized afterward for failing to defend most any of the 
controversial statements Trump has made, instead pretending that Trump had not 
said those things.

 * Kaine was criticized afterward for interrupting Pence too much. Many of 
those interruptions included a call for Trump to release his tax returns, which 
Kaine mentioned many many times. 
 * Each side accused the other of running a campaign of insults. An “avalanche 
of insults,” Pence called it. 
 * At which Kaine rattled off about 16 insulting things Trump had said and 
accused Trump of having “kind of a personal mount Rushmore” of dictators he 
likes. 
 * “Oh please,” Pence replied. “Did you work on that one a long time? Because 
it had a lot of creative lines.” 
 * “See if you can defend any of them,” Kaine retorted, pointing out that he 
was merely repeating verbatim things Trump had said. issie lapowsky

 * There were fireworks. Kaine said Trump was exactly the “fool or maniac” 
Ronald Reagan had warned about when it came to nuclear weapons. “Senator,” 
Pence replied, “that is even beneath you and Hillary Clinton, and that is 
pretty low.” 
 * Pence denied that Trump had proposed punishing women for abortion, then 
sort of admitted Trump had said that, explaining: “He’s not a polished 
politician.” 
 * Pence also denied that he had called Russian president Vladimir Putin “a 
stronger leader <https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/783490972562882560>” than 
Barack Obama, denied past support forprivatizing social security and denied 
that Trump had called for morenations to get nuclear weapons. 
 * The unflappable Pence did show some frustration with Kaine on “this whole 
Putin thing,” “this Iran thing” and, in an unfortunate choice of words, at one 
point said, “Senator, you whipped out that Mexican thing again.” CSPAN (@cspan)

 * Pence rolled out a Syria policy that Trump hasn’t mentioned, including safe 
zones and a muscular American response if Russia continues its involvement in 
the bombing of civilians. 
 * Kaine successfully tied Trump’s apparent non-payment of taxes to 
non-support for US troops. Pence: “Donald Trump would support our troops.” 
Kaine: “He doesn’t pay taxes.” 
 * Two different world views were on display. Pence: “You’ve got to err on the 
side of the safety of the American people.” Kaine: “By trashing all Syrians? By 
trashing all Muslims?” 
 * “The thought of Donald Trump as commander in chief scares us to death,” 
Kaine said of himself and Clinton. Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) 
Clinton campaign aides say fundamental takeaway from tonight is that Mike Pence
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence> did not show up to defend 
Trump, promoted himself instead.

Fact check: abortion

Alan Yuhas

Pence: ‘Donald Trump and I would just never support legislation that would 
punish a woman for making the heartbreaking decision to terminate a pregnancy’

Kaine is correct that Trump suggested women should be punished for having 
abortions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment>
 – he then recanted the idea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment>
 at the end of a day of flip flopping positions. Unlike Pence, Trump has not 
been pro-life his whole life. In 1999, hesaid 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-evolving-stance-abortion/story?id=38057176>
: “I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for, 
I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject, but still I just believe 
in choice.”

Fact check: the Clinton foundation

Alan Yuhas

Pence: the Associated Press found that more than half of Clinton’s meetings as 
secretary of state were with donors to the Clinton Foundation

The AP story on Clinton’s meetings did not include her meetings with people in 
the US government and from foreign governments 
<http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/09/ap-deletes-clinton-foundation-tweet-227917>
 – who were by a huge margin the people she met with while serving as the top 
diplomat of the United States.

The news agency deleted a tweet about the story – virtually verbatim to what 
Pence said– for lack of context, and AP’s vice president for standards John 
Daniszewski wrotea blog post about the decision 
<https://blog.ap.org/announcements/statement-on-why-ap-deletes-clinton-tweet?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP>

Many have been asking what kind of pin Tim Kaine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tim-kaine> is wearing on his lapel tonight.

Answer: A Blue Star Pin <https://bluestarfam.org/>, worn by the families of 
those who serve in the military, in honor of his son Nat.

Earlier this year, the North Carolina GOP derided Kaine as “shameful” 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nc-gop-tim-kaine-blue-star-pin_us_57998278e4b01180b531bfd6>
 for wearing the Blue Star Pin, which they wrongly thought was a Honduras flag 
pin. (Kaine was a missionary in Honduras in 1980).

Last question: How would you bring the country together if elected?

Kaine: Clinton was first lady, senator and now the nominee. I’m surprised all 
the time by how well people say they worked with her. He names children’s 
health care and care for 9/11 survivors. “She has a track record of working 
across the aisle to make things happen.” He mentions he had two Republican- 
controlled legislatures while governor.

Pence: Thank you thank you. “This is a very challenging time in the life of 
the nation. .. an economy that’s truly struggling... more taxes, regulation, 
Obamacare, war on coal, trade deals that have put American workers in the 
backseat. “The best way we can bring American workers together is through 
change in Washington DC... The American people want to see our people standing 
tall again... and Donald Trump’s entire career has been about building... 
finding a way... to fight forward. WhenDonald Trump

Kaine: Trump wants to punish women for abortion

Quijano: describe your faith life.

Kaine: This question is easy. Irish Catholic, Jesuit, Catholic missionary, 
people should worship as they please. As state governor, he says, he struggled 
with Virginia’s death penalty. He opposed it based on religion. “But I know how 
to take an oath and uphold the law... it was very very difficult to allow an 
execution to go forward... that was a real struggle” but people of faith can’t 
just substitute their own views on everyone.

Pence: Wonderful question. “My Christian faith is at the very heart of who I 
am.” We went to church and had grace. “With my wife at my side, we followed the 
calling into public service.” I have a great deal of respect for senator 
Kaine’s sincere faith. But the sanctimony of life... out of the blue... ancient 
principle... God says... great compassion for the sanctity of life.. 
non-abortion alternatives.. pro-adoption. “What I can’t understand withHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>... to support a 
practice like partial birth abortion... that a child almost born could still 
have their life taken from them is just anathema to me...Clinton wants to 
repeal” ban on tax funds for abortion. Still Pence talking here. “I like to 
spend a little bit of time on my knees every day.”

Kaine: “This is a fundamental question... we really feel that it is not the

Kaine: Trump said he did.

Pence: “He’s not a polished politician.”

Kaine: The gospel of Matthew says, “From the fullness of the heart the mouth 
speaks.” So Trump meant it. And he called Mexicans rapists.

Pence: “Senator, you whipped out that Mexican thing again.”

Kaine: “Can you defend it?”

Pence: “There are criminal aliens that come into this country...”

Pence: Because a society can be judged by how it deals with its most 
vulnerable... I couldn’t be more proud to be standing with a pro-life 
candidate.”

The first and only vice-presidential debate of 2016 is in the can. Here’s what 
happened:

 * It was punchy, not a bit flat, it moved fast, covered a lot of policy 
ground, and featured Virginia senator Tim Kaine going after Donald Trump’s 
jugular like a bloodthirsty terrier while Indiana governor Mike Pence 
projected, mostly, a demeanor of steely calm and determined focus. 
 * Pence was criticized afterward for failing to defend most any of the 
controversial statements Trump has made, instead pretending that Trump had not 
said those things.

 * Kaine was criticized afterward for interrupting Pence too much. Many of 
those interruptions included a call for Trump to release his tax returns, which 
Kaine mentioned many many times. 
 * Each side accused the other of running a campaign of insults. An “avalanche 
of insults,” Pence called it. 
 * At which Kaine rattled off about 16 insulting things Trump had said and 
accused Trump of having “kind of a personal mount Rushmore” of dictators he 
likes. 
 * “Oh please,” Pence replied. “Did you work on that one a long time? Because 
it had a lot of creative lines.” 
 * “See if you can defend any of them,” Kaine retorted, pointing out that he 
was merely repeating verbatim things Trump had said. issie lapowsky

 * There were fireworks. Kaine said Trump was exactly the “fool or maniac” 
Ronald Reagan had warned about when it came to nuclear weapons. “Senator,” 
Pence replied, “that is even beneath you and Hillary Clinton, and that is 
pretty low.” 
 * Pence denied that Trump had proposed punishing women for abortion, then 
sort of admitted Trump had said that, explaining: “He’s not a polished 
politician.” 
 * Pence also denied that he had called Russian president Vladimir Putin “a 
stronger leader <https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/783490972562882560>” than 
Barack Obama, denied past support forprivatizing social security and denied 
that Trump had called for morenations to get nuclear weapons. 
 * The unflappable Pence did show some frustration with Kaine on “this whole 
Putin thing,” “this Iran thing” and, in an unfortunate choice of words, at one 
point said, “Senator, you whipped out that Mexican thing again.” CSPAN (@cspan)

 * Pence rolled out a Syria policy that Trump hasn’t mentioned, including safe 
zones and a muscular American response if Russia continues its involvement in 
the bombing of civilians. 
 * Kaine successfully tied Trump’s apparent non-payment of taxes to 
non-support for US troops. Pence: “Donald Trump would support our troops.” 
Kaine: “He doesn’t pay taxes.” 
 * Two different world views were on display. Pence: “You’ve got to err on the 
side of the safety of the American people.” Kaine: “By trashing all Syrians? By 
trashing all Muslims?” 
 * “The thought of Donald Trump as commander in chief scares us to death,” 
Kaine said of himself and Clinton. Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) 
Clinton campaign aides say fundamental takeaway from tonight is that Mike Pence
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence> did not show up to defend

Pence: ‘Donald Trump and I would just never support legislation that would 
punish a woman for making the heartbreaking decision to terminate a pregnancy’

Kaine is correct that Trump suggested women should be punished for having 
abortions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment>
 – he then recanted the idea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment>
 at the end of a day of flip flopping positions. Unlike Pence, Trump has not 
been pro-life his whole life. In 1999, hesaid 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-evolving-stance-abortion/story?id=38057176>
: “I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for, 
I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject, but still I just believe 
in choice.”
 
Pence: the Associated Press found that more than half of Clinton’s meetings as 
secretary of state were with donors to the Clinton Foundation

The AP story on Clinton’s meetings did not include her meetings with people in 
the US government and from foreign governments 
<http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/09/ap-deletes-clinton-foundation-tweet-227917>
 – who were by a huge margin the people she met with while serving as the top 
diplomat of the United States.

The news agency deleted a tweet about the story – virtually verbatim to what 
Pence said– for lack of context, and AP’s vice president for standards John 
Daniszewski wrotea blog post about the decision

That’s it! It’s done. Who won? Did Kaine rattle Pence? How did Quijano do? 
 
Many have been asking what kind of pin Tim Kaine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tim-kaine> is wearing on his lapel tonight.

Answer: A Blue Star Pin <https://bluestarfam.org/>, worn by the families of 
those who serve in the military, in honor of his son Nat.

Earlier this year, the North Carolina GOP derided Kaine as “shameful” 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nc-gop-tim-kaine-blue-star-pin_us_57998278e4b01180b531bfd6>
 for wearing the Blue Star Pin, which they wrongly thought was a Honduras flag 
pin. (Kaine was a missionary in Honduras in 1980).
 
Last question: How would you bring the country together if elected?

Kaine: Clinton was first lady, senator and now the nominee. I’m surprised all 
the time by how well people say they worked with her. He names children’s 
health care and care for 9/11 survivors. “She has a track record of working 
across the aisle to make things happen.” He mentions he had two Republican- 
controlled legislatures while governor.

Pence: Thank you thank you. “This is a very challenging time in the life of 
the nation. .. an economy that’s truly struggling... more taxes, regulation, 
Obamacare, war on coal, trade deals that have put American workers in the 
backseat. “The best way we can bring American workers together is through 
change in Washington DC... The American people want to see our people standing 
tall again... and Donald Trump’s entire career has been about building... 
finding a way... to fight forward. WhenDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> because president of the 
United States, we’re going to have a stronger America.
 
Quijano: describe your faith life.

Kaine: This question is easy. Irish Catholic, Jesuit, Catholic missionary, 
people should worship as they please. As state governor, he says, he struggled 
with Virginia’s death penalty. He opposed it based on religion. “But I know how 
to take an oath and uphold the law... it was very very difficult to allow an 
execution to go forward... that was a real struggle” but people of faith can’t 
just substitute their own views on everyone.

Pence: Wonderful question. “My Christian faith is at the very heart of who I 
am.” We went to church and had grace. “With my wife at my side, we followed the 
calling into public service.” I have a great deal of respect for senator 
Kaine’s sincere faith. But the sanctimony of life... out of the blue... ancient 
principle... God says... great compassion for the sanctity of life.. 
non-abortion alternatives.. pro-adoption. “What I can’t understand withHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>... to support a 
practice like partial birth abortion... that a child almost born could still 
have their life taken from them is just anathema to me...Clinton wants to 
repeal” ban on tax funds for abortion. Still Pence talking here. “I like to 
spend a little bit of time on my knees every day.”

Kaine: “This is a fundamental question... we really feel that it is not the 
role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else... we support Roe 
v Wade... the constitutional right of American woman to... make their own 
decision about pregnancy. We trust American women to do that. And we don’t 
think that women asDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> said should be punished.. “ 
Pence wants to overturn Roe.. “The very last thing that government should do is 
to make laws that would punish women.” And that “is the

Pence: “Donald Trump and I” don’t favor punishing women for abortion.

Kaine: Trump said he did.

Pence: “He’s not a polished politician.”

Kaine: The gospel of Matthew says, “From the fullness of the heart the mouth 
speaks.” So Trump meant it. And he called Mexicans rapists.

Pence: “Senator, you whipped out that Mexican thing again.”

Kaine: “Can you defend it?”

Pence: “There are criminal aliens that come into this country...”

[talk talk]

Kaine: Why doesn’t Donald Trump trust women to make that choice for themselves?

Pence: Because a society can be judged by how it deals with its most 
vulnerable... I couldn’t be more proud to be standing with a pro-life 
candidate.”
 
The candidates are asked about their faith. The Guardian’s Stephanie 
Kirchgaessner <https://twitter.com/skirchy> has taken a look at their different 
Catholic-inspired visions:
