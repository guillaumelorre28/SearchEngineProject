Hello guzzlers.

If you are now abstaining from alcohol, as many end-of-year over-indulgers do, 
today’s puzzle is for you. Here’s a full whisky bottle. It has a height of 27cm 
and a diameter of 7cm, and contains 750 cubic centimetres of whisky. It has a 
dome-like indentation at the bottom like many bottles have.
 Bottle is full 
You were hoping for a dry January but spectacularly fell off the wagon. You 
can’t remember what happened but now bottle only has 14cm of whisky left in it. 
When you turn the bottle over, it has 19cm of whisky.

 Bottle is not full 
Question: how much whisky is still in the bottle, in cubic centimetres?


[Just in case you have forgotten, the following may be useful: the area of a 
circle is πr2, where r is the radius and π is 3.14 to two decimal places, and 
the volume of a cylinder is πr2 x h, where r is the radius and h is the height.]

I’ll be back at 5pm GMT with the solution. Cheers!

NO SPOILERS PLEASE! It ruins the fun for everyone else. So if you work out the 
answer please don’t add it in the comments. Instead, fee free to discuss issues 
surrounding abstention from alcohol, favourite whiskies or other booze-themed 
mathematical puzzles.

Today’s puzzle was suggested by Bernardo Recamán, a maths educator from 
Colombia. It is believed it was originally devised by the US mathematician 
Robin Hartshorne.
