A man stops and stares at the water for a long time, looking for something. A 
while later, he walks away.

You see him from a distance. You are sitting, watching, you realize, the man 
watching the water. Did he find what he was looking for? You decide to approach 
the water to see if you can find it too, some meaning perhaps, some small 
vision.

When you arrive, are near enough to see the ripples approaching the edge at 
which you stand, you have your answer, or, really, two possibilities: either he 
did not find what he was looking for because it was not there, or he did, and 
he took it away with him.
