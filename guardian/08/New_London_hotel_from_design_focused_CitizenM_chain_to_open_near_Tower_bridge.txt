hotel opposite the Tower of London, on 11 July. The new-build hotel, the 
group’s second in London and eighth internationally, is above Tower Hill 
station and has an eighth-floor terrace bar offering sweeping views of the 
iconic attraction, as well as Tower bridge, the City ofLondon

Shard.

The group, which opened its first property in Amsterdam in 2008, set out to 
challenge the hotel industry by dispensing with traditional features – such as 
check-in desks, overpriced mini bars and an onsite restaurant – offering 
instead small, but hi-tech rooms and large, stylish communal areas at an 
affordable price. Room rates are based on the low-cost airline model: the 
earlier you book, the cheaper the rate. Prices start at £109, room only.

The ground floor features a cocktail bar, self-service check-in terminals – 
where guests pick up their room key – coffee bar, breakfast area (breakfast 
costs extra, at £12.95 in advance or £15.50 on the day), and numerous sofas and 
tables with power points for its predominantly business clientele. But with 
Vitra furniture, a distinctly modern mishmash of antiques and funky 
knick-knacks, and large-scale multimedia and sculptural art installations, it’s 
clearly aimed at the creative, tech and media worlds. Its funky decor and 
friendly, laid-back approach will also appeal to leisure travellers eager to 
keep costs low, but who want something more stylish than a bland budget chain.

As in its other hotels, rooms are a standard size: small but with king-size 
beds, rain showers and an iPad mini that controls lighting, sound, temperature 
and TV, with free Wi-Fi and movies. A third London CitizenM is due to open in 
Shoreditch in September, and will be similar in style, but with a more 
music-inspired decor. The group is also expanding internationally with new 
hotels being built in Paris and New York, while Los Angeles and Seattle 
locations are also being explored.
