Blair Castle, Perthshire (woodland lodges)


Blair Castle in bucolic Perthshire, the seat of the Dukes of Atholl since 
medieval times, wouldn’t look out of place in a Disney film. This 
white-turreted confection owes its good looks to a spot of Victorian 
remodelling. You can’t stay in the castle itself but there’s a campsite (open 
from mid-February to early November), a handful of luxury lodges scattered 
across the estate and, in a secluded spot, close to the pretty granite village 
of Blair Atholl, a meadow of contemporary woodland lodges. Named after the 
rivers on the estate, Errochty, Fender and Tilt sleep four, Tummel and Garry 
six. The lodges are well-kitted-out with an outdoor terrace, views of woodland 
and craggy hills, 40 miles of waymarked trails and a host of ranger-led 
activities.
• 01796 481487, blair-castle.co.uk 
<http://www.athollestateslodges.co.uk/stay_woodland_lodges.cfm>, from £275 for 
a four-night break in a two-bedroom lodge (sleeps 4) or £320 in a three-bedroom 
lodge

Hoddom Castle, Dumfries and Galloway (camping)
 Chill Pod at Hoddom Castle Photograph: /PR 
Hoddom Castle’s homespun homage to glamping is the chill pod, a cross between 
a wooden wigwam and a Gypsy caravan. Each pretty painted pod sleeps four (in a 
double bed and two singles) and has electricity and a small decking area for 
barbecues. Hunkered into this lush, green corner of south-west Scotland, the 
16th-century castle was built to defend the border. Its 19th-century baronial 
extension was stripped away in the 1950s, and today the original tower looms 
uninhabited over the estate. For campers there’s a kitchen, shower block, shop, 
bar and restaurant, plus fishing for salmon in the Annan river, nature walks 
with the ranger and a mountain bike trail in the woods.

Mooch around the round drawing room, marvel at the pistols and swords in the 
armoury then swan down the oval staircase to explore the grounds: the Fountain 
Court’s orangery and terraces, the walled garden and glasshouses. Take a last 
look up at the battlements and turrets – then slope off to pitch your tent. 
This magnificent 18th-century castle, with its dramatic clifftop setting on the 
craggy west coast, was designed by Robert Adams and was once home to the chief 
of Clan Kennedy. Today, the castle and its sprawling estate are owned by the 
National Trust for Scotland. The campsite is just a short stroll from the 
castle and has spectacular views across the Firth of Clyde to Ailsa Craig and 
the moody Mull of Kintyre.

Liberton Tower, near Edinburgh (self-catering)
 Bedroom at Liberton Tower 
Play king of the castle in this 15th-century tower a couple of miles from 
Edinburgh, restored by theCastles of Scotland Preservation Trust 
<http://www.buildingconservation.com/directory/cospt>. Think thick walls, slit 
windows and a listening hole called the “lairds lug”. The original entrance was 
over a drawbridge, but today you climb an external staircase into the Great 
Hall with its wall hangings, heavy oak furniture and roaring fire. Inside, a 
stone staircase links the four floors from the kitchen with its vaulted ceiling 
to the master bedroom which has a grand four-poster. From the twin room there’s 
a ladder up to the stone parapet and spectacular views of Edinburgh.

Dornoch Castle, Sutherland (hotel)

From the 15th-century castle you can gaze across the square to Dornoch’s 
12th-century cathedral. There’s history seeping out of the stonework in this 
picture-postcard little town on the north-east coast, famous for its golf and 
windswept beach – and the castle’s history is a colourful one. Home to the 
Bishop of Caithness and the Earl of Sutherland, it was set alight during a clan 
feud, then turned into a school, a jail, a courthouse, and a hunting lodge 
before becoming a hotel in the mid-20th century. The 24 rooms are split between 
the castle and modern extension – to splash out check into the sumptuous Old 
Courtroom, with its hand-carved four-poster, log fire, soaring ceiling and 
panelled walls.

Saddell Castle, Kintyre (self-catering)

 Saddell Castle bedroom Photograph: /PR 
Build a bonfire on the beach below this romantic 16th-century tower on the 
far-flung Kintyre peninsula then climb up to the battlements and gaze out 
across the Kilbrannan Sound to the Isle of Arran. The Landmark Trust property 
was built in 1508 by the Bishop of Argyll and became a Campbell stronghold for 
400 years. Today, it’s a holiday let sleeping eight, and the stuff of 
fantasies, with highlights such as a 16th-century fireplace in one of the 
bedrooms, discovered during restoration. By day you can explore the ruined 
abbey, go beach-combing, and spot seals and otters along the shore.

Glengorm Castle, Isle of Mull (B&B)

 Terrace flat at Glengorm castle 
The B&B in this magnificent baronial pile on the Isle of Mull is a relaxed 
affair. It has a slightly higgledy-piggledy homely feel despite the grand 
carved staircase, panelled library (where you can enjoy a complimentary dram 
looking out over the sea) and 16th-century oak dining table. But then it is 
still a family home, complete with chattering children. The five rooms are 
old-fashioned and elegant: Cranach is in the tower with a wrought-iron bed, 
Mingary is best for sunsets, Laorin looks out over the Atlantic, Ardmore has a 
feminine four-poster and Tor has views of the walled garden. If you’d like more 
independence there’s a self-catering flat sleeping six on the ground floor, and 
a handful of converted cottages in the grounds.

 Barcaldine Castle. Photograph: Alamy 
Raisins or whisky with your porridge? This mini fairy tale castle on the shore 
of Loch Creran was built in 1609 by “Black” Duncan Campbell and comes with the 
requisite turrets, cavernous stone fireplace, panelling, antlers on the wall – 
and gourmet breakfasts. It’s now a luxurious B&B with five rooms, and you can 
choose between tartan trim and creamy tones. Cosy Argyll has a stone fireplace, 
Airds a white iron bedstead, Barcaldine sturdy mahogany antiques and a roll-top 
bath, Breadalbane a four-poster and, for the best views, Caithness at the top 
of the castle, has antique French furniture strewn with velvet and mohair 
throws. Add Arran Aromatics toiletries, fluffy robes, free Wi-Fi and 
spellbinding views of Glencoe’s rugged peaks.

Fernie Castle, Fife (hotel)
 Inside Fernie Castle 
There are no run-of-the-mill “rooms” at creeper-clad Fernie Castle in Fife, 
once the home of the Earl of Fife and dating back to the 14th century. The 20 
“bed chambers” are categorised as monarch, king, queen, squire and lady – and 
there’s a wallet-busting treehouse suite perched in six giant sycamores with 
fantastical woodland murals, a giant elm bed and freestanding tub. Set in 17 
acres of picturesque woodland with its own lochan, the castle lives up to its 
credentials: the vaulted keep bar dates back to 1530, the dining room has a 
Georgian chandelier, magnificent oils of stags loom over you and you might 
stumble upon a suit of armour in the corridor.

Torrisdale Castle (self-catering)
 Torrisdale Castle 
Checking into the Servants’ Quarters at Torrisdale Castle on the Kintyre 
peninsula is not as shabby as it sounds. This new apartment within the 
19th-century castle has just been revamped. Sleeping six, with private entrance 
and views across the lawn to the sea, it’s not exactly pokey either. The master 
bedroom has a roll-top tub, the shower’s in the old gun room and there’s a 
“secret room” you’ll have to hunt for. Design-wise think Cole & Son and 
Timorous Beasties wallpaper: bright and contemporary with wooden floors, sash 
windows and shutters. While you’re here you can go stalking with the 
gamekeeper, wildlife watching, bring your own canoe to paddle from the private 
beach or walk part of the Kintyre Way, which crosses the estate.
