Medley for Morin Khur 

I
The sound box is made of a horse’s head.
The resonator is horse skin.
The strings and bow are of horsehair.


II
The morin khur is the thoroughbred
of Mongolian violins.
Its call is the call of the stallion to the mare.


III
A call which may no more be gainsaid
than that of jinn to jinn
through jasmine-weighted air.


IV
A call that may no more be gainsaid
than that of blood kin to kin
through a body-strewn central square.


V
A square in which they’ll heap the horses’ heads
by the heaps of horse skin
and the heaps of horsehair.

This week’s poem originally appeared in Paul Muldoon’s 2006 collection Horse 
Latitudes, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview6> 
and is included in his elegantly pared and sparkling newSelected Poems, 
1968–2014 <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/selected-poems-1968-2014.html>, 
published by Faber last month.


 The choice of work in the new volume allows readers an overview which 
emphasises the cohesiveness of Muldoon’s poetic projects. Although all his 
collections combine lyric and narrative writing, the more visible 
juxtapositions of the “Selected” sharpen one’s sense that, despite the poet’s 
formal finesse, linguistic sleight-of-hand and sheer musicality, his reach is 
novelistic. Perhaps “epic” would be the better word, more appropriate in terms 
of the historical interrogations and intertextuality, the torrent of anecdote, 
and, not least, the range of characters and places. This week’s poem might be a 
microcosm of more abundant fusions of lyric and narrative moments.

 Its lyric focus, the “morin khur” of the title, is the two-stringed Mongolian 
viol, informally known as the “horsehead fiddle”. (The words are sometimes 
transliterated through their Cyrillic filter asmorin khuur or morin xuur). As 
Mongolia’s national instrument,the morin khur has a complex and fascinating 
history 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gjuTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=what+does+mongolian+word+khuur+mean?&source=bl&ots=z3aBxUqdEp&sig=xczzPoAfXkmTVAsEiB7Bj_Zm3zc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjO_Kjjms3PAhXrLsAKHVi4CwQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=what%20does%20mongolian%20word%20khuur%20mean%3F&f=false>
, laced with legend and speculation. One theory has it beginning life as the 
ladle that was used for mare’s milk liquor, and boasted a horse’s head carved 
into the handle. Wearing its national costume, it may represent “peace and 
happiness <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morin_khuur>” but there are bloodier 
connotations. The wordkhuur itself may keep etymological company with bows and 
arrows:qor, to which it’s possibly related, means “quiver”.

 Similarly, before medley came to mean mixture, a musical mixture in 
particular, it denoted hand-to-hand combat 
<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=medley>. 
Muldoon’s poem, without moralising, clarifies what Marian Johnston called “the 
complex truth of the relation between art and atrocity” inher review of Horse 
Latitudes <http://www.cprw.com/Johnston/muldoon.htm>. Horses’ bodies have 
always been ingeniously exploited and Muldoon has approached the theme from 
many angles: see Johnston’s comments on the long narrative poem, At the Sign of 
the Black Horse, September 1999, and her note on the uses of horsehair in the 
building works that cost many Irish lives. In the context of the Medley, the 
horses are raw material for musical instrument-making, only to end up as the 
spoils of war in the fifth movement. At this point, the categorisation and 
ordering of body parts begins to recall some of the worst historical war 
crimes. There are many historical levels of resonance: Genghis Khan’s imperial 
predations, Nazi Germany,Stalin’s acts of repression 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinist_repressions_in_Mongolia>, sectarian 
violence in Muldoon’s native Northern Ireland, the invasion of Iraq, and too 
many current 21st-century scenes of horror and desecration.

 Medley for Morin Khur is a cunning weave of fiction (“The sound box is made 
of a horse’s head”) and definition. Metaphor can bridge the gap, though, and 
when it tells us that the instrument’s “call is the call of the stallion to the 
mare” there’s a factual base: the fiddle’s strings were traditionally “male” 
and “female”, one using stallion hair, the other, that of a mare.

 Five triplets, all rhyming abc, are self-contained but sometimes linked by 
anaphora: they blend effects both faintly percussive and melodic. The sounds 
lighten in each little stanza, “-ed” and “-in” sounds being followed by the 
light diminuendo of the “–air” rhymes, the latter like the sustained notes 
which use the whole length of the bow. Other alliterative and repetitive 
effects add internal counterpoint.Rime riche 
<https://www.britannica.com/art/rime-riche> reins in the gallop of “which [or 
that] may no more be gainsaid” in stanzas III and IV, and ceremoniously 
formalises the outer stanzas through their first-line end-words, the singular 
“horse’s head” of I becoming the plural “horses’ heads” in V.

Such patterning suggests a cyclical motion within the peace-to-war, art to 
atrocity, narrative. Overall, though, there’s a progress (or regress) from 
magical and sexual connotations (jinns and jasmine, the animals’ mating call) 
to the outcry “of blood kin to kin” and the ruthless cleanup after the 
slaughter. The process seems inevitable: stanzas III and IV may well warn us 
that human urges to make art and war are deeply rooted and interlocked. The old 
word “gainsaid <http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gainsay>” adds a 
faintly folkloric touch, appropriate to antiquity and intransigence. However 
playful some of its strategies, the poem confronts us with the insoluble and 
reveals the total absence of escape routes from the enmeshed conflict of 
creativity and destructiveness – other than those questionable escape routes of 
art.

 You can hear the elegiac, viola-like tones of the solo morin khur here 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IatOLrjb9GA>, in a virtuoso performance which 
somehow parallels that of the poet, combining gravitas with animation, 
classicism with a subtle hint of horses’ neigh and hoof-beat.
