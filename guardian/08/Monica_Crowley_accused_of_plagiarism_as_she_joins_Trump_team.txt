A book by a close ally of incoming US president Donald Trump has been 
withdrawn by publisher HarperCollins after accusations of plagiarism.

Digital editions of Monica Crowley’s What the (Bleep) Just Happened were 
pulled from sale overnight amid accusations that Trump’s choice for a 
high-profile national security role had plagiarised large parts of her 2012 
text.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Rupert Murdoch-owned publishing house 
glossed over the accusations, saying it had withdrawn the book because it had 
“reached the end of its natural sales cycle”. But it added the title would 
become available at “such time as the author has the opportunity to source and 
revise the material”.

Fifty examples of alleged plagiarism from multiple sources were revealed by 
broadcaster CNN KFile

, including that Crowley had lifted sections on Keynesian economics from the 
website Investopedia; and on torture from a Fox news article. It also showed 
details of “pork-barrel” spending items she had claimed were part of outgoing 
president Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus package, which were said to have come 
from a conservative podiatrist’s website and to date back to 2004. Other 
alleged sources included Wikipedia, Yahoo News and The Wall Street Journal.

A conservative columnist, radio talkshow host and Fox News personality, 
Crowley has been picked by Trump as senior director of strategic communications 
for the National Security Council.


It is not her only brush with plagiarism claims. On Saturday 
<http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/monica-crowley-plagiarism-phd-dissertation-columbia-214612>
, Politico magazine published sections of her PhD dissertation, which it 
alleged had plagiarised a series of academic texts without citation.

When the allegations about What the (Bleep) Just Happened first broke, Crowley 
received support from the president-elect’s office, with a spokesperson 
dismissing the claims as being no more than“a politically motivated attack”

. No further statement has been made.

The book was published by HarperCollins’s conservative imprint Broadside 
Books. It offered a conservative critique of Barack Obama’s policies and sold 
about 20,000 copies, according to Publishers Marketplace.

It is the latest controversy to embroil US publishing, as traditionally 
liberal presses court conservative darlings with offers of lucrative book 
deals. Earlier this month, Simon & Schuster was plunged into a row over its 
decision to pay rightwing personality Milo Yiannopoulos $250,000 (£203,000) for 
his memoir Dangerous, due out in March.

According to Slate.com 
<http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2017/01/how_publishing_houses_weigh_a_decision_like_giving_milo_yiannopoulos_a_book.html>
, the deal was offered after the Brietbart technology editor’s book was turned 
down elsewhere. While Yiannopoulos has claimed the book was cooked up over 
lunch with an editor from Simon & Schuster, Slate reported the provocateur’s 
memoir was rejected because of a perception among publishers that he had failed 
to prove his controversial antics were anything more than headline-grabbing 
stunts. As a result, there were doubts Yiannopoulos could sustain a whole book.

One editor told Slate that Yiannopoulos’s apparent lack of an underpinning and 
coherent philosophy was a problem. “He’s used the cloak of ‘I’m anti-PC’, he 
finds different little phrases to justify his behaviour, but … to pose as a 
provocateur as if it’s a political stance. That’s bullshit.”
