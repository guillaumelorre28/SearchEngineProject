Rock Rose


a remedy for terror

I can’t look down
from this chalky brink.

As I cling, I listen
to the large sea

rummaging for where
the cliffs are soft, or thin.

Holly

a remedy for hatred and jealousy

I’m expert in subtle vexations.
I can stitch a thread of blood.

You see I can’t love.
My dark green heart is good for nothing.

Always trotting out this same old hard-luck story …
Don’t cry or I’ll scratch out your eyes.

Common Centaury


a remedy for those who are too selfless

All summer long
I acquiesce –
a drudgery
of red and pink.

My flowers make
the grasses sing!
I’m only happy
when I’m saying yes.

Wild Balsam


a remedy for impatience

I gave short shrift
to motherhood and flung
my children from me.
Who’d have those tiny shoots
under their feet all day?

I want to think and work.
I want to make of my hamstrung life
a brilliant fever.

Edward Bach <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bach> was a doctor of the 
homeopathic persuasion. His so-called “remedies” originated in the energy 
patterns he believed to correspond between certain plants and the emotional 
disorders affecting human health. He died in 1936, but his 38Bach Flower 
Remedies <http://www.bachflower.org/> are still big business. 

Many have challenged Bach, and doubts have been cast on those who swallow the 
remedies in a serious state of faith. InTrick or Treatment? Alternative 
Medicine on Trial, Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/04/booksonhealth.scienceandnature> 
conduct a thorough investigation of complementary medicine andconclude 
<http://%20http//emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Simon-Singh-Edzard-Ernst-Trick-or-Treatment.pdf>
 that none of the trials of the flower remedies “shows that this approach is 
effective beyond placebo in curing disease or alleviating symptoms”.

 Katharine Towers has transformed what is almost certainly bad science into 
delightful art. The sequence of 14 flower remedies forms the second part of a 
new, three-part collection,The Remedies 
<http://www.picador.com/authors/katharine-towers>, which is shortlisted for 
this year’sTS Eliot prize 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/ts-eliot-prize-for-poetry>. Each poem in the 
sequence is spoken by the plant, imagined as a sufferer from the condition for 
which it is the remedy; a clever application from the homeopathic principle. 
I’ve picked four from the series – Rock Rose, Holly, Common Centaury and Wild 
Balsam – which are placed eighth, ninth, 11th and 14th in the published 
sequence.

 The aphoristic brevity and sharp yet casual tone recall Jo Shapcott’s Rose 
poems, a response to Rilke’s Les Roses sequence. Shapcott, like Towers, used 
the stereotype of flowers as female genitalia to question that very stereotype, 
although not by giving voice to the roses. The wild flowers in Towers’s 
Remedies sequence are not overtly identified as female, but the vocabulary 
drops dainty hints; aspen “enact a delicate hysteria” (Aspen), the rock rose 
“cling (s)” to the threatened cliff. Many of the psychological conditions being 
remedied are emotional disorders conventionally associated with femininity; 
being “too selfless” (Common Centaury) and, arguably, dreaming too much 
(Clematis).

 Being impatient myself, I’ll begin with the final poem in the sequence. Wild 
Balsam – impatiens – gave me a thrill of self-recognition. It also sent me back 
to rereadAnne Stevenson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/02/featuresreviews.guardianreview14>
’s Himalayan Balsam, a botanical investigation both luscious and precise. I 
first met Stevenson’s poem many years ago while living in Belfast, and it 
helped me identify the strange plant growing profusely outside my back gate. 
Together with an apt companion piece, Gillian Clarke’s Balsam, Himalayan Balsam 
can be enjoyed if you visitMaurice Rutherford’s poetry garden of a website 
<http://www.mauricerutherford.com/poems/>.

 In Towers’s Wild Balsam, the gender of the speaker is boldly foregrounded: “I 
gave short shrift / to motherhood and flung / my children from me.” This might 
be the declaration of a shameless infanticide, a Medea character, rather than a 
simply impatient one. The gesture implicit in “flung my children from me” is 
almost heroic in its ruthlessness. It mimes the plant’s behaviour, known as
“explosive dehiscence” 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)#Explosive_dehiscence> – the 
source of its Latin name, impatiens. This fine little monologue is all the more 
disturbing for being voiced by a mother apparently suffering from nothing worse 
than impatience.

 The Rock Rose is unusual in this sequence in being threatened by external 
forces. The “large sea” is distant but potentially devastating, and when it 
enters the cliff at a weak spot,the skinny-stemmed flower 
<http://wildflowerfinder.org.uk/Flowers/R/RockRose(Common)/RockRose(Common).htm>
 will go down with the cliff. As usual, no word is wasted, and all exaggeration 
resisted. The minimalism with which the flower’s “terror” is evoked is apt and 
dignified.

The Remedies by Katharine Towers review – a fanciful talking cure

 Holly’s character suggests the pathology of the abused-turned-abuser, unable 
to give or receive anything except pain. The voice seems strained through a 
sieve of assonantal spitting and hissing. Holly berries traditionally symbolise 
Christ’s blood, but here there’s no image of berries to represent the wounds’ 
potential for redemptive new growth: the idea of red is reduced to a “thread of 
blood”. Jealousy is not merely green, but “dark green”. Its violent potential 
emerges in the last line. The harsh honesty might have been a saving grace, but 
it gives way to the threat of an ancient, particularly savage form of 
retribution.

 By contrast, the “red” of Common Centaury 
<http://www.wildflowerfinder.org.uk/Flowers/C/Centaury(Common)/Centaury(Common).htm>
 has been modified by blue and merges into “pink”, with all its feminine 
associations. The speaker’s mood is unapologetic, even joyful. She may be the 
floral equivalent of the angel in the house, but there are no obvious hidden 
resentments, no airs of aggrieved martyrdom. She would be happy not to be cured 
of her selflessness. Perhaps the poem quietly makes a case against the secular 
tendency to approve of self-centredness and pathologise selflessness. Common 
Centaury and Wild Balsam, in offering extreme models of power relations, 
connote a larger moral conflict between private and public, artistic and social 
responsibility.

 But what of scientific responsibility? The poems 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/15/the-remedies-katharine-towers-review-fanciful-talking-cure>
 aren’t designed to promote or question Edward Bach’s remedies. They might be 
offering an alternative understanding of their own, by taking the psychological 
conditions back into the psyche, and revealing them through the filter of 
botanical characteristics.

 Towers’s flower people are allegorical: they represent difficult emotions and 
are complex, troubled, “silly like us”. They air their feelings and 
self-criticisms plainly and guilelessly as if no one were judging, and only a 
kindly psychotherapist listening. Their seeming candour is guaranteed by verbal 
precision and a sensitively captured colloquial idiom, neither slang nor 
psychobabble. For those made tetchy by poetry prizes, these flower remedies are 
a palatable and refreshing tonic.
