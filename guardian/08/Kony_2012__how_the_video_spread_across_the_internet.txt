A 30-minute video declaring the intention of making Ugandan warlord Joseph 
Kony "famous" has succeeded – and then some – by creating an astounding online 
cascade of interest. The so-called Kony2012 initiative, launched by the 
non-profit group Invisible Children, demands the removal of Ugandan guerrilla 
leader Joseph Rao Kony – and the group insists pressure will be maintained on 
US policymakers to ensure he is removed.

The video has received more than 50m hits on YouTube 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube> since it was uploaded on 
Monday. How did it happen? Think Justin Bieber.
