A federal judge in San Diego has denied Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>’s request for a five-week 
delay to a trial to determine whether the now-defunct Trump University 
defrauded customers.

 US district judge Gonzalo Curiel ruled on Thursday that the trial will begin 
on 28 November, as previously scheduled.

Trump attorney Daniel Petrocelli asked the judge to delay the trial to 2 
January because he must be in Los Angeles on 15 November for another trial. The 
judge in that case rejected a delay.

The Republican presidential candidate has repeatedly criticized Curiel’s 
handling of the case, noting the judge’s Mexican heritage.

Curiel says the class-action lawsuit targeting Trump University is more than 
six years old and Trump’s attorneys did not raise scheduling concerns until 
late August.

The judge also scheduled a hearing to establish jury instructions for 10 
November.

The presidential election takes place on 8 November.
