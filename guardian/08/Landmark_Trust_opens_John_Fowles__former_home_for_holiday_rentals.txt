An 18th-century seaside villa that was the home of acclaimed author John Fowles
 <http://www.fowlesbooks.com/>until his death in 2005 is now available for 
self-catering holiday rentals following an eight-year restoration project by the
Landmark Trust <http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/>. 

Belmont, a Grade II-listed building in Lyme Regis 
<http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/Properties-list/belmont/holiday/>, has been 
restored to its former glory by the historic buildings charity at a cost of 
£1.8m. The Regency building, which sleeps eight, is already fully booked until 
the end of 2016.

John Fowles lived in the villa for almost four decades, from 1968, and much of 
his work was competed there, including his best-known novelThe French 
Lieutenant’s Woman <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFZPSQKjwwc> (also a film), 
which is partly set in Lyme Regis.

 Interior of the renovated Belmont 
Fowles hoped Belmont could be enjoyed by many people in the future, 
particularly other writers. As well as being available for holiday rentals, the 
house will host annual study weeks for creative writing students.

Belmont was also owned by pioneering 18th-century businesswoman Eleanor Coade 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Coade>, who established a successful 
artificial stone business that led to Coade-stone being used in many Regency 
buildings across the UK, including the Royal Naval College, in Greenwich, and 
Buckingham Palace.

Examples of Coade-stone embellishments have been preserved at Belmont, 
including the intricate face of Neptune on the keystone and the urns, freize 
and quoins. With no surviving portraits of Coade, Belmont is considered by the 
trust to be the only substantial monument to her life.

Dr Anna Keay, director of the Landmark Trust, described the “enormous pride” 
of having completed the restoration during the charity’s 50th anniversary year.

“The rejuvenated building is once again a fitting monument to the genius of 
Eleanor Coade,” she said. “Visitors will now be able to stay in her Georgian 
architectural gem and in so doing experience the beauty and peace that inspired 
one of our greatest modern writers, John Fowles.”

The Landmark Trust bought Belmont in 2007. At the time, the building was in 
urgent need of repair. The charity led the restoration process in-house, using 
traditional craft skills to restore and renovate the house.

The bright pink facade matches the original shade from Coade’s time, while the 
fireplace and decoration in the sitting room – where Fowles would write – are 
all original.

A permanent exhibition in the former stables will begin on 9 October, and will 
be open from 2pm-5pm every Friday from 1 April-31 October. The exhibition will 
offer a window into the lives of Coade and Fowles as well as Victorian GP and 
amateur astronomer Dr Richard Bangay, another former resident of the house.

Belmont was built in 1774 and is considered an excellent example of the type 
of seaside villa that emerged during a time when sea bathing and rural holiday 
homes were growing in popularity.

The villa has two double and two single bedrooms, and can be rented at a cost 
of £640 for four nights. It joins a register of 195 other historic buildings 
owned by the Landmark Trust, which are available to let for short breaks.
