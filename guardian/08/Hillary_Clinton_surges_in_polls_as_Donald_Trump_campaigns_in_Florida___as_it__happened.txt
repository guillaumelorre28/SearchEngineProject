 * Donald Trump’s campaign manager has admitted “we are behind,” but the 
candidate himself is not making any such concession. Instead Trump this morning 
is grabbing hold of a “phony polls” conspiracy theory floated on Zero Hedge, a
financial analysis site 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-29/unmasking-the-men-behind-zero-hedge-wall-street-s-renegade-blog>
 that also specializes in screwball politics headlines. The Drudge Report has a 
prominent link this morning to a Zero Hedge piece claiming that Wikileaks has 
revealed a Clinton campaign plot to rig the polls.

 * Senator Elizabeth Warren got a crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire, 
super-charged with this attack on Trump: 
He thinks because he has a mouth full of Tic-Tacs that he can force himself on 
any woman within groping distance. Well, I’ve got news for you,Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>. Women have had it with guys 
like you. And nasty women have especially had it. Get this, Donald. Nasty women 
are tough. Nasty women are smart. And Nasty women vote. And on November 8, we 
nasty women are going to march our nasty feet to cast our nasty votes to get 
you out of our lives forever.
‘Nasty women vote’: Elizabeth Warren takes a swipe at Trump

It was pretty awful.

How bad have things gotten for the Trump campaign in Utah?

Well, in addition to being in a three-way race 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/can-clinton-win-utah-poll-trump-evan-mcmullin-tie>
 for the state’s six electoral votes with Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton and conservative upstart Evan McMullin, the campaign is now 
spending valuable candidate facetime in Salt Lake City by sending vice 
presidential nominee Mike Pence to the state on Wednesday.

Republican VP nominee Mike Pence will be in SLC Wednesday for 3 pm event at

Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton of 'deliberately inciting violence' with 
Donald Duck costumes

Trump campaign spokesperson Jason Miller has accused Hillary Clinton’s 
campaign of inciting violence at Donald Trump’s campaign rally, citing a trio 
of articles from right-leaning publications citing an edited (and, as yet, 
unverified) video from James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas:

Recent revelations surrounding Hillary Clinton’s corrupt campaign further 
illustrate that she will stop at nothing to secure the Presidency. In a totally 
disqualifying act that is a violent threat to our democracy,Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> directly involved herself 
in inciting violence directed at Trump supporters. The Clintons have divided 
our country for far too long. On behalf of the American people, who deserve 
better, the Trump Campaign demands a full and immediate investigation into the 
acts of violence that the Clinton campaign and the DNC have incited on American 
voters.

The articles describe incidents in which Trump is “stalked by operatives in 
Donald Duck costumes.” The idea was a nod to Trump “ducking” the release of his 
tax returns.

Donald Trump: 'I will be your voice'

Speaking in Tampa, Florida, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> vowed to end “rampant 
government corruption” and instead place his emphasis on the struggles of “the 
average man and woman.”

“I see you, I hear you, and I will never ever let you down - I promise,” Trump 
said. “We will never let you down. I will be your voice, and I will fight 
harder than anybody has ever fought for you - and I will win, because I know 
how to win.”

Continuing his riff on Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> being too “corrupt” to be 
allowed to serve as president, Donald Trump told a rapt audience in Tampa, 
Florida, that polls, votes and the news media are all “rigged.”

“Our system is rigged, our system is rigged,” Trump said, of Clinton. “She 
never had a chance of being convicted, even though everybody in this audience - 
and boy do we have a lot of people - everybody here knows that she’s 100% 
guilty.”

“Our country has never reached a lower point than what we’re witnessing,” 
Trump said.

“If you look at her plans for Syria, these are the plans of a child,” Trump 
said, redirecting his ire towards Clinton’s plans for the humanitarian crisis

Telling a rapt audience that his brand of change “only arrives once in a 
lifetime,” Republican presidential nominee asked his supporters to “rise above 
the noise and the clutter” and embrace the most crucial ingredient of the 
American character: “optimism.”

“So let’s try it!” Trump said, before launching into a tirade against “the 
media.”

“They’re trying to fix the election for Crooked Hillary,” Trump continued, 
using an appellation he coined for rival Hillary Clinton. “The best evidence 
that the system is rigged is the fact thatHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, despite her many crimes, 
was even allowed to run for president in the first place.”

Trump’s declaration is met with a “LOCK HER UP” chant, which he applauds.

American Bar Association: Donald Trump is a 'libel bully'

A committee of media lawyers at the largest professional organization for 
attorneys in the United States wrote a report condemning Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump as a “libel bully,”according to the New York 
Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/us/politics/donald-trump-lawsuits-american-bar-association.html?_r=0>
, but was not allowed to publish the report lest Trump prove them right - by 
suing them.

Trump’s numerous threatened and executed lawsuits against journalists and news 
organizations over the years, the American Bar Association’s committee reported 
in a publication titled “Donald J. Trump Is a Libel Bully but Also a Libel Loser
 <http://www.medialaw.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=3470>,” were 
examined in seven speech-related cases brought by Trump and his affiliated 
companies.

The conclusion was blistering.

“Trump’s lawsuits are worthy of a comedy routine, as when Trump sued HBO 
comedian Bill Maher for suckering Trump into sending his birth certificate to 
prove he was not the ‘spawn’ of an orangutan, and Trump hit back with a 
$5-million breach-of-contract lawsuit, only to withdraw it after the Hollywood 
Reporter ridiculed it,” the report stated. “Can anyone say Hustler v. Falwell?”

(That case, which ended up in front of the supreme court, resulted in the 
decision that public figures are allowed to be subjected to parody.)

Trump, the report declared, “is a libel bully. Like most bullies, he’s also a 
loser, to borrow from Trump’s vocabulary.”

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/trump-groping-accusations-new-york-times-rally>
 and against pollsters on Monday, alleging that both were part of a “rigged 
system” trying to undermine his candidacy.


Speaking in a rally in St Augustine, Florida, Trump falsely claimed that 
hacked emails of John Podesta showed that the Clinton campaign chair was 
“rigging the polls by oversampling Democrats”.

The Republican nominee, whose campaign is managed by the pollster Kellyanne 
Conway, called this “a voter suppression technique”. Oversampling is a method 
used by pollsters to get better measurements of specific sub-groups and is 
entirely normal in polling.

The statement followed a tweet from the Republican on Monday morning in which 
heclaimed <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/790534428942622721>: 
“Major story that the Dems are making up phony polls in order to suppress the 
the Trump [sic]. We are going to WIN!”Almost every independent poll 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html>
 has consistently shown a steady lead for Clinton since late July and Conway 
has repeatedly conceded in recent days that Trump is behind.

A new poll from the Sheldon Adelson-owned Las Vegas Review Journal, which 
became thefirst major daily newspaper 
<http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-donald-trump-president>
 to endorse Donald Trump this weekend, shows the Republican nominee trailing 
Democratic rivalby seven points 
<http://www.reviewjournal.com/politics/election-2016/rj-poll-shows-clinton-pulling-away-trump-nevada>
 among likely voters in Nevada, a difficult hill to climb for a candidate whose 
campaign manager still sees Nevada as apossible swing state. 
<https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/790667164730658817>

The poll, conducted after the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas 
last week, shows Clinton with seven-point lead over Trump among likely voters, 
48% to 41%. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson trails at 6%, with 4% of voters 
saying that they are either undecided or are supporting another candidate.

Clinton’s lead has grown by six points in the same poll since late September, 
when the same survey showed the former secretary of state leadingby a single 
point.

Trump campaign spokesperson Jason Miller has accused Hillary Clinton’s 
campaign of inciting violence at Donald Trump’s campaign rally, citing a trio 
of articles from right-leaning publications citing an edited (and, as yet, 
unverified) video from James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas:

Recent revelations surrounding Hillary Clinton’s corrupt campaign further 
illustrate that she will stop at nothing to secure the Presidency. In a totally 
disqualifying act that is a violent threat to our democracy,Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> directly involved herself 
in inciting violence directed at Trump supporters. The Clintons have divided 
our country for far too long. On behalf of the American people, who deserve 
better, the Trump Campaign demands a full and immediate investigation into the 
acts of violence that the Clinton campaign and the DNC have incited on American 
voters.

The articles describe incidents in which Trump is “stalked by operatives in 
Donald Duck costumes.” The idea was a nod to Trump “ducking” the release of his 
tax returns.
 
Donald Trump, on babies:

We’re losing our jobs like a bunch of babies.
 
Speaking in Tampa, Florida, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> vowed to end “rampant 
government corruption” and instead place his emphasis on the struggles of “the 
average man and woman.”

“I see you, I hear you, and I will never ever let you down - I promise,” Trump 
said. “We will never let you down. I will be your voice, and I will fight 
harder than anybody has ever fought for you - and I will win, because I know 
how to win.”
 
Continuing his riff on Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> being too “corrupt” to be 
allowed to serve as president, Donald Trump told a rapt audience in Tampa, 
Florida, that polls, votes and the news media are all “rigged.”

“Our system is rigged, our system is rigged,” Trump said, of Clinton. “She 
never had a chance of being convicted, even though everybody in this audience - 
and boy do we have a lot of people - everybody here knows that she’s 100% 
guilty.”

“Our country has never reached a lower point than what we’re witnessing,” 
Trump said.

“If you look at her plans for Syria, these are the plans of a child,” Trump 
said, redirecting his ire towards Clinton’s plans for the humanitarian crisis 
in Syria.
 
Telling a rapt audience that his brand of change “only arrives once in a 
lifetime,” Republican presidential nominee asked his supporters to “rise above 
the noise and the clutter” and embrace the most crucial ingredient of the 
American character: “optimism.”

“So let’s try it!” Trump said, before launching into a tirade against “the 
media.”

“They’re trying to fix the election for Crooked Hillary,” Trump continued, 
using an appellation he coined for rival Hillary Clinton. “The best evidence 
that the system is rigged is the fact thatHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, despite her many crimes, 
was even allowed to run for president in the first place.”

Trump’s declaration is met with a “LOCK HER UP” chant, which he applauds.
 
Speaking to a raucous and seld-described record-breaking crowd in Tampa, 
Florida, Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> that Florida is his “second

We are now seeing Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> accused of ordering

<https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/790686473548816384>  
A committee of media lawyers at the largest professional organization for 
attorneys in the United States wrote a report condemning Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump as a “libel bully,”according to the New York 
Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/us/politics/donald-trump-lawsuits-american-bar-association.html?_r=0>
, but was not allowed to publish the report lest Trump prove them right - by 
suing them.

Trump’s numerous threatened and executed lawsuits against journalists and news 
organizations over the years, the American Bar Association’s committee reported 
in a publication titled “Donald J. Trump Is a Libel Bully but Also a Libel Loser
 <http://www.medialaw.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=3470>,” were 
examined in seven speech-related cases brought by Trump and his affiliated 
companies.

The conclusion was blistering.

“Trump’s lawsuits are worthy of a comedy routine, as when Trump sued HBO 
comedian Bill Maher for suckering Trump into sending his birth certificate to 
prove he was not the ‘spawn’ of an orangutan, and Trump hit back with a 
$5-million breach-of-contract lawsuit, only to withdraw it after the Hollywood 
Reporter ridiculed it,” the report stated. “Can anyone say Hustler v. Falwell?”

(That case, which ended up in front of the supreme court, resulted in the 
decision that public figures are allowed to be subjected to parody.)

Trump, the report declared, “is a libel bully. Like most bullies, he’s also a 
loser, to borrow from Trump’s vocabulary.”
 
The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs has more on Donald Trump’s insistence that the 
statistical tool of “oversampling” is tantamount to voter suppression (which 
it’s not):

Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric against the media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/trump-groping-accusations-new-york-times-rally>
 and against pollsters on Monday, alleging that both were part of a “rigged 
system” trying to undermine his candidacy.


Speaking in a rally in St Augustine, Florida, Trump falsely claimed that 
hacked emails of John Podesta showed that the Clinton campaign chair was 
“rigging the polls by oversampling Democrats”.

The Republican nominee, whose campaign is managed by the pollster Kellyanne 
Conway, called this “a voter suppression technique”. Oversampling is a method 
used by pollsters to get better measurements of specific sub-groups and is 
entirely normal in polling.

The statement followed a tweet from the Republican on Monday morning in which 
heclaimed <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/790534428942622721>: 
“Major story that the Dems are making up phony polls in order to suppress the
