Women in Morocco <https://www.theguardian.com/world/morocco> have reacted in 
horror after a programme on state television demonstrated how they could use 
makeup to cover up evidence of domestic violence.

The segment in the daily programme Sabahiyat, on Channel 2M, showed a smiling 
makeup artist demonstrating how to mask marks of beating, on a woman with her 
face made up to appear swollen and covered with fake black and blue bruises.

“We hope these beauty tips will help you carry on with your daily life”, the 
host said at the end of the segment, broadcast on 23 November – two days before 
theInternational Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_for_the_Elimination_of_Violence_against_Women>
.

The response was immediate, and outraged. A petition signed by hundreds of 
women demanded an apology and sanctions against the station. One man tweeted 
that the segment had left him speechless.

The channel has since removed the clip from its website, but it has been 
circulated on Twitter:

The channel has also placed a “clarification” on its Facebook page 
<https://www.facebook.com/2m.officiel/posts/10154785779554721>, saying that the 
section was “completely inappropriate and has an editorial error of judgment in 
view of the sensitivity and the gravity of the subject of violence against 
women”.
