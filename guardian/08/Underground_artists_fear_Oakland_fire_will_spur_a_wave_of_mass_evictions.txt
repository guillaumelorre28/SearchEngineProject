The devastating Oakland <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oakland> 
warehouse fire has provoked threats of mass evictions of artist communities and 
low-income residents, raising concerns that real estate developers will exploit 
the tragedy to shutter old buildings and displace vulnerable tenants.

Just days after the fire at the Ghost Ship warehouse

, city officials and community leaders in Oakland and cities across the US have 
begun targeting underground spaces that they say pose similar hazards and 
should be closed.

But artists and housing activists – including in Baltimore, where dozens were 
abruptly evicted 
<http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-bell-foundry-20161205-story.html>
 from an arts building two days after the Oakland fire – said the crackdowns 
are hurtful and unproductive and will disproportionately impact LGBT 
communities and people of color.

“It feels like a double dagger in our gut,” said Sarah Sexton, an 
Oakland-based music booker. “First we lose our friends and then we lose the 
spaces that we’ve bonded with them in.”

The Friday night fire – which ignited in an arts space that was filled with 
wood andlacked basic fire safety mechanisms 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/03/oakland-ghost-ship-warehouse-fire-violations>
 – has already prompted officials in Oakland and surrounding California cities 
to scrutinize other warehouses.

An Oakland barbecue restaurant held a press conference on Wednesday to call on 
the city to investigate a neighboring warehouse. Earlier in the week, a fire 
inspectorvisited a different Oakland warehouse 
<http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Among-Oakland-s-dozens-of-artist-warehouses-is-10712732.php>
, telling a tenant the city was investigating a complaint and taking steps to 
prevent a “terrible tragedy”.

In Richmond, a city just north of Oakland, the mayor Tom Butt wrote an op-ed 
<http://richmondstandard.com/2016/12/richmond-mayor-says-local-teachers-among-oakland-warehouse-fire-victims/>
 raising concerns about an “an unpermitted, unlicensed night club” that he 
called “our own ‘Ghost Ship’”.

Artists said that efforts to improve the safety of underground venues and 
non-traditional housing are important, but argued that launching aggressive 
shutdowns will disrupt already marginalized communities and force some to 
become homeless. The debate comes amid anextraordinary housing crisis in Oakland

“It’s just so insulting that this is happening,” said Lisa Aurora, co-founder 
of Naming Gallery in Oakland. “We need to stand up for the people whose lives 
were taken, who were about creating spaces for people.”

On Monday, Baltimore shut down a building called the Bell Foundry, citing 
safety violations and “deplorable conditions”, forcing many toimmediately vacate
 
<http://www.citypaper.com/blogs/noise/bcpnews-diy-arts-space-bell-foundry-shut-down-by-city-20161205-story.html>
.

Although Baltimore <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/baltimore> officials 
claimed the Oakland fire was not the impetus for the shutdown, affected tenants 
said it seemed obvious the city was using the tragedy as an excuse to clear out 
the property so that it could be redeveloped for a more profitable use.

“They are being opportunistic about that travesty in order to flip a 
building,” said Person Abide, a 29-year-old tenant, adding, “The Bell Foundry 
functions as a place for queers and people of color to find support.”

Abide posted video of the eviction

repeatedly refusing to allow the tenants to re-enter the building to retrieve 
their cat.

These types of evictions are a significant problem in low-income housing 
across Baltimore, not just for arts spaces, added Abide, who was friends with 
one of the Oakland fire victims.

“I don’t have anywhere to live. I don’t make much money and can’t afford 
traditional rent,” said a local activist and evicted resident who goes by the 
name Koala! Largess.

Aran Keating, artistic director of the Baltimore Rock Opera Society, a group 
that occupies the first floor of the Bell Foundry building, said it was wrong 
for the city to claim to be a supporter of the arts but then refuse to find a 
way to work with the pivotal group of artists.

Oakland's housing crisis: 'I’m the last one here. I don’t know if I can stay

“When an arts community is building itself and bootstrapping itself in order 
to make huge impacts on the community, it gets stabbed. It gets pushed down.”

Some of those involved in underground art scenes argued that a wave of 
shutdowns would only further discourage people from speaking out about 
legitimate safety concerns.

For venues putting on community-oriented shows that don’t make a lot of money, 
it can also be difficult to navigate government bureaucracy and in some cases 
financially impossible to transform a building in a way that complies with 
municipal codes, which are often outdated.

Sexton said there were no easy solutions, but suggested the creation of a fund 
to help venues comply with building codes or a non-profit group that can work 
with fire marshals and arts organizations.

Annie Campbell Washington, an Oakland city councilwoman, said city leaders 
were committed to preserving art spaces and their housing.

“Artists in Oakland are so important to our way of life,” she said, but added, 
“Obviously, human life and human safety has to be our number one issue.”
