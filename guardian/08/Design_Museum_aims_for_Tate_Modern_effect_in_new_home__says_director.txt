The new museum in Kensington, central London, will have nearly 9,500 sq metres 
of internal space, three times as much as at its present home in a former 
banana warehouse near Tower Bridge. It also expects to attract more than 
650,000 visitors a year instead of the current 250,000.

Deyan Sudjic, the museum’s director, said the aim was to create “the most 
inspiring, exciting and engaging contemporary design and architecture museum in 
the world”.

He said the intention was to do “what Tate Modern did for contemporary art, 
for design”. He added: “Before Tate Modern was built there was a sense that 
contemporary art was at the periphery of things, on the edge and even seen as 
not relevant to British life. It has changed so much. We can do that with 
design as well.”

Transforming the 1960s-built Commonwealth Institute building on Kensington 
High Street has been a difficult, challenging project and is the main reason 
that the opening is at least two years later than originally planned.

Deputy director Alice Black said at one point the building was entirely on 
stilts as they dug a basement. “When we started taking bits of the building 
away we found it had not been built in the way we expected ... so unfortunately 
it was a little delayed, but I think it is an amazing achievement.”

The old Design Museum will close on 30 June. The lease has been sold by Sir 
Terence Conran, the original driving force behind the museum, to the architect 
Zaha Hadid, who will use it for her archive and for architecture exhibitions.
The money from the sale has been ploughed back into the £83m cost of moving 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/29/terence-conran-design-museum-commonwealth-institute>
. The Heritage Lottery Fund has also given £4.9m and Arts Council England has 
given a capital grant of £3m.

The museum said a display of the permanent collection would be open free of 
charge,instead of the current £13.65 admission <https://designmuseum.org>. 
Highlights of the collection include Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert’s 
British road signs; the Sony TPS-L2 Walkman designed by Nobutoshi Kihara; and 
Mikhail Kalashnikov’s AK47 assault rifle.

At the new museum, one of the first things visitors will see is a six 
metre-long design wall which will contain 200-300 consumer objects chosen by 
the public via the museum’s website.

There will also be exhibitions with an entry charge, the first of which will 
be called Fear and Love: Reactions to a Complex World. It will feature a series 
of newly commissioned installations addressing hopes and doubts about the pace 
and impact of change. There will also be the ninth edition of the annual 
Designs of the Year show.

Details of the new Design <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/design> 
Museum were revealed at Phillips auction house in London where a charity 
auction will be held on 28 April. The museum hopes to raise around £1m through 
the sale of works donated by architects, designers and artists including Jony 
Ive, Ron Arad, Hadid and Antony Gormley.
