At Jean-Georges, a three-star Michelin restaurant in the Trump International 
Hotel in New York, it’s a rich man’s world, and one where the US 
president-elect feels at home. This has also been evident in his appointments 
so far, as the so-called “blue-collar billionaire” looks set to preside over 
the wealthiest administration in modern history.

Trump's conflicts of interest: a visual guide

Trump, a former host of reality TV show The Apprentice, is surrounding himself 
with the 1%: billionaires and millionaires, investment bankers and venture 
capitalists, Wall Street insiders and family fortune heirs, many educated at 
elite schools. It is the most brazen embrace of big money since the 1980s era 
of Ronald Reagan, Tom Wolfe’s Masters of the Universe and Oliver Stone’s Gordon 
Gekko.

“It is a throwback to the ‘greed is good’ mentality,” said Marge Baker, 
executive vice-president of the liberal pressure groupPeople For the American 
Way <http://www.pfaw.org/media-center/spokespeople>. “It’s also alarming that 
the president-elect said he believes what’s good for his business is good for 
America. That’s not how you want the leader of your country to be making 
decisions.”


Baker added: “When you’ve got Wall Street billionaires setting the agenda it’s 
not likely to benefit average Americans. Research shows that the wealthy have 
different priorities and policy priorities, for example on healthcare and the 
minimum wage.”

The Trump cabinet’s emphasis on tax cuts and deregulation is also likely to 
echo the Reagan era. Election rival Hillary Clinton warned during the campaign: 
“Trump is trickledown economics over and over again. I called it trumped-up 
trickledown economics.”

Igor Volsky <https://www.americanprogress.org/about/staff/volsky-igor/bio/>, 
deputy director of a pro-Clinton thinktank, the Center for American Progress 
Action Fund, said: “The same trickledown policies we saw in the 80s [that] 
didn’t help ordinary Americans are going to be put forward again. If you look 
at large parts of the cabinet it does feel like going back in time.”
Trump's cabinet of the wealthy 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/12/trump_cabinet/giv-157261emzbwT14E22/>
The very people who heard Trump’s blunt, populist message about unrigging the 
system would be the ones to suffer its betrayal, Volsky added. “He’s going to 
perpetuate a system that helps the very richest Americans at the cost of 
programmes that help middle and lower-income Americans.”


Andrew Mellon, one of the richest Americans of the early 20th century, served 
as treasury secretary in three administrations. George W Bush’s first cabinet 
was criticised for containing high rollers in 2001. But Trump has taken the mix 
of democracy and plutocracy to a whole new level.

The Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/donald-trump-cabinet-billionaires-millionaires-231831>
 website suggested the new president’s team could be worth $35bn – some have 
made political donations worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The median 
household income in the US is about $55,000.

Trump’s supporters have said they welcome the fact he is a businessman, not a 
politician beholden to special interests, and hope he will run America like an 
efficient corporation. But several members of the administration could face 
accusations of aconflict of interest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/dec/01/donald-trump-business-interests-conflicts>
 – that they are forming policy with at least one eye on their own businesses, 
or those of their cronies.

Neil Sroka, spokesman for the liberal organisation Democracy for America, 
said: “You’ve got a group of entitled, out-of-touch billionaires who are going 
to be bossed around by a bigoted, out-of-touch billionaire. It is beyond 
credibility that they are going to be able to accurately reflect the needs of 
working-class citizens who rely on leaders in Washington to fight for them.”


The appointments were self-serving, Sroka added. “What this rogues’ gallery of 
billionaires that Trump is trotting shows is that he isn’t interested in 
protecting working people. He wants to curry favour with a millionaire and 
billionaire class that he’s always sought the approval of.

“This is a class that dines on lobster steak and caviar every night. They’re 
not figuring out how to put food on the table. They’re figuring out how to make 
a few more millions before they go home at night.”
