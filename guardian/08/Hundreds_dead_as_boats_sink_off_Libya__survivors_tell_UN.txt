At least 240 people are feared to have drowned in the southern Mediterranean, 
bringing the annual total to 4,220 – the highest in the Mediterranean on record.

About 100 people drowned when an inflatable dinghy capsized shortly after 
leaving the Libyan coast on Wednesday, some of the 29 survivors told the UN 
refugee agency. A further 140 are thought to have drowned in a second incident 
in another rubber boat early on Thursday morning. Only two people appear to 
have survived the second tragedy.

The survivors’ testimonies “were all very consistent”, a spokeswoman for the 
UN refugee agency, Carlotta Sami, said in a telephone interview. “They report 
two shipwrecks, both not far from the Libyan shore, and they report the boats 
were in a very bad condition. Many women, pregnant women and children were 
onboard, and they were in the water for hours.”

Though the numbers migrating from Turkey to Greece have dropped drastically 
since March after anagreement between the EU and Turkey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/eu-turkey-refugee-deal-qa>, 
crossings between Libya and Italy are still at near-record levels.Nearly 
160,000 people <http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=105> have 
reached Italy so far this year from Libya, already more than last year’s annual 
total, and within sight of the 2014 record of 170,000.

“If the trends of October continue, then we might see even higher arrivals 
[than in 2014],” said Sami. “Let’s see what happens in November.”

The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said he was “deeply 
saddened by another tragedy”. Many lives could be saved, he said, if European 
countries volunteered to take in more refugees rather than leaving them to make 
the risky boat trip. “The Mediterranean is a deadly stretch of sea for refugees 
and migrants, yet they still see no other option but to risk their lives to 
cross it.”

Military missions from several European countries, including Britain, have 
tried to curb the Libyan smuggling industry by intercepting and destroying the 
smugglers’ repurposed fishing trawlers after they leave Libyan waters.

In response, the smugglers have simply turned to flimsy inflatable boats, 
which can be piloted by refugees themselves, and which are even more dangerous 
than the wooden trawlers. As a result, asylum seekers’ lives have been put at 
even greater risk – this year, roughly one in every 40 attempting to reachItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> by sea have died.

Syrians appear to have stopped using the Libyan route. Most of the migrants 
and refugees this year have fled war and poverty in Nigeria and Sudan, or 
dictatorships in Eritrea and Gambia. Others are migrant workers who tried to 
find jobs inLibya <https://www.theguardian.com/world/libya> but fled after a 
civil war broke out and law and order collapsed.

In this context, many claim the dangerous sea journey is the least worst 
option facing them, due to the dire situation in Libya. “A dead goat doesn’t 
fear the butcher’s knife,” quipped one person in Libyaduring an interview with 
the Guardian last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/17/death-mediterranean-africans-migrant-sea-libya>
.

A day on a refugee rescue ship: 'this job must be done, there must be no 
sinking'

Many are kept in slavery-like conditions by their Libyan employers, while 
others are tortured or extorted, sometimes by the authorities. About 70% say 
they faced some kind of exploitation in Libya, according to research by the 
International Organisation forMigration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration>.

Some European politicians have previously argued that the Mediterranean rescue 
missions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/refugee-rescue-ship-bourbon-argos-eritreans-libya-msf>
, stationed off the Libyan coast, encourage more people to risk the journey. 
But while many more would drown without the presence of the rescue boats, there 
is no evidence that their absence would drive down numbers.

When EU-led rescue missions were suspended in early 2015, more migrants and 
refugeesattempted the journey  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/refugee-rescue-ship-bourbon-argos-eritreans-libya-msf>
than ever before, and more drowned. Guardian interviews at the time suggested 
that both migrants and smugglers were unaware of the existence of the rescue 
missions.
