Summer is here at last it seems, with long evenings, the occasional glimpse of 
the sun between the showers, and the inevitable recommencement of the life and 
death battle with the patch of green outside the window. Yes, summer, the 
season of lawns, those slices of domesticated nature that have come to 
symbolise the march of civilisation, for good or ill.

There was a time when a lawn was just any area of untilled grassland, the 
haunt of shepherds and Thomas Gray's dead, meeting "sun upon the upland lawn 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173564>". In fact, the modern usage of 
the word can be dated back to Gray's lifetime and the change in meaning was 
part of the 18th-century cult of order and of human control of nature. We owe a 
lot of good things to the English Enlightenment; sadly, it also seems to be to 
blame for summer days ruined trying to get the lawnmower to work.

One of the crack troops in this ongoing war is the common (all too common, 
some might say) dandelion. As Stephen Kenneth Kelen is at pains to point out in 
his poemLawn Wars 
<http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/kelen-s-k/lawn-wars-0086034>, these 
weeds are undefeatable, and yet lawn owners feel compelled to do battle with 
them every year. Why can't we just sit back and enjoy their golden exuberance? 
There are days when I find myself in full agreement withGrace Bauer's Against 
Lawn <http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177801> and its "reminder to avoid 
too much taming / of what, even here, wants to be wild."

It is this element of the tame, of nature moulded to the human will, that 
makes the lawn the perfect image of suburban contentment. Ownership of a 
manicured area of grass is one of those things that allow us to "place" people 
in their appropriate social milieu. It's an association that is playfully 
exploited by Louis Simpson in his poemOn the Lawn at the Villa 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171542>, where the respectably 
upper-middle class connotations of the two nouns in the title are ironically 
foregrounded in the opening lines so as to set up something quite unexpected in 
the poem that follows.

Of course lawns are only evil to those tasked with maintaining them; for 
others, especially children, they can be places of delight, grassy playgrounds 
on which they can, like the pupils inThomas Hardy's The High-School Lawn 
<http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/high-school-lawn>, go whirling and laughing 
through the warm summer. As every with Hardy poem, this seemingly simple piece 
is tinged with sadness at human mortality. The central image is revisited by 
Margaret Atwood inThe circle game <http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177288> 
at much greater length, but not necessarily more effectively.

Robert Louis Stevenson's child in The Dumb Soldier 
<http://www.bartleby.com/188/305.html> is involved in a more solitary kind of 
game, and his toy soldier hidden in a hollow in the lawn for a year is a kind 
of gateway into a vision of nature that brings us back to the older meaning of 
lawn. The poem creates a kind of meeting place for the wild and the tame, as 
seen through the keen eye of childhood. This is a lawn as it should be.

If the children in these poems possess lawns as their own private worlds, then 
the old man injoanne burns's dry dock 
<http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/burns-joanne/dry-dock-0179031> claims 
his patch of green as an escape from family, the boredom of retirement, and 
thoughts of his own mortality. It is, however, a battleground of another sort; 
the ambition is to keep it green and his enemies are the climate, the water 
authorities and nosy neighbours. The fight is worth it, though, if the outcome 
is to be "merlin in your suburban dream". A lawn with that kind of magic is one 
we could all learn to live with.

And so this month's challenge is to write poems about lawns. They may be poems 
of love or war, memories of childhood games, or odes to back-garden sunbathing. 
One way or another, please share them here. And just to balance my negative 
opening, here's a short ode to the lawn byEmily Dickinson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/emilydickinson> to finish with:

Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn 
Indicative that suns go down; 
The notice to the startled grass 
That darkness is about to pass.
