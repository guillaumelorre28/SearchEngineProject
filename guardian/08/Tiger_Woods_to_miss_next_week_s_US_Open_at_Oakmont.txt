Tiger Woods <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tigerwoods> has announced that 
he will be giving a miss to next week’s US Open at Oakmont, the second major of 
the season where the former world No1 will be absent.

Woods, who has won the US Open three times and with 14 majors to his name, the 
last of them in 2008 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jun/17/usopengolf.tigerwoods>, is 
exempt from qualifying and registered for his national Open seven weeks ago – 
“simply procedural,” said his agent Mark Steinberg – after two separate back 
surgeries since he last played tournament golf in August.

emails and calls I have received have been incredible. I want to wish Mike 
Davis, Diana Murphy, the USGA, the players and everyone at Oakmont a very 
successful week.
