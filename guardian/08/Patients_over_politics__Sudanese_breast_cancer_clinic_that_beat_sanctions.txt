For many women living in Sudan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan>, 
breast cancer means certain death. Treatment is too expensive or they simply 
feel too embarrassed to seek help.

But until recently, yet another obstacle was seriously hampering efforts to 
cut breast cancer deaths in Sudan. Since the early 1990s, the country has been 
on the US blacklist

for state sponsors of terrorism – imposed for human rights violations and for 
harbouring Osama Bin Laden.

#SudanUnderSanctions: young people describe life on the blacklist

Even the Khartoum Breast Care Centre (KBCC), the Horn of Africa’s first and 
only dedicated breast cancer clinic, has been hit by the sanctions, with a ban 
on international money transfers and the restriction on imports of medical 
equipment and spare parts.

Founded by British-trained Sudanese radiologist Dr Hania Fadl 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/world-cancer-day-meet-the-woman-fighting-disease-and-taboos-in-sudans-only-breast-cancer-clinic-a6853466.html>
, the KBCC offers hi-tech digital mammography screening for a fraction of the 
usual price elsewhere. Since it opened in 2010, it has treated more than 18,000 
patients from across the region and has received widespread acclaim and 
international support.

Using private funds and a $14m donation from the charitable foundation run by 
her ex-husband, Sudanese-British businessmanMo Ibrahim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/01/mo-ibrahim>, Fadl has 
managed its 11-year development from start to finish.

However, the US sanctions meant the centre was unable to buy and maintain 
crucial diagnostic machinery. In February 2014, it decided to begin a year-long 
application process for a US Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) exemption, 
which would make it easier to maintain its General Electric digital mammography 
machine.

During the application process the machine broke down. It ended up being out 
of action for 10 weeks. The clinic was paralysed, with doctors forced to use 
alternative screening methods. “The problem is the poor women. You do 
ultrasounds and biopsies but an ultrasound is not an internationally approved 
screening modality,” Fadl says. “There are patients and I have to do something, 
even if they’ll put me in jail. I can’t let them wait and risk that their 
cancers spread.”

After heavy campaigning and several trips to Washington by Fadl to meet 
members of Congress, Ofac eventually issued a blanket licence exempting all 
medical equipment in Sudan from sanctions.

Ignorance is rife and I really hope and pray that women will come to the 
centre at least for a simple check up
Fatma Abdelmajid, KBCC patient 
The result was a welcome surprise to doctors at the KBCC, who say the move is 
a milestone for Sudanese healthcare in that it has put the needs of patients 
above international politics.


“All of our equipment in the clinic is from a US company, General Electric, as 
are the majority of advanced medical machines in Sudan. For there to be an 
exemption from sanctions, our lives as doctors will be much easier and the 
lives our patients will drastically change,” says Dr David Lawis, medical 
director of the KBCC.

Lawis says access to radiotherapy remains a huge issue, with just two machines 
in the country. One, in Khartoum a hospital, has been broken for about seven 
months. The second is in Madani hospital, two hours’ drive from Khartoum.

Anyone who can afford to pay for treatment abroad usually leaves Sudan to get 
radiotherapy, but the blanket Ofac licence has the potential to change this. 
“People won’t have to leave their country to get the treatment they deserve,” 
says Lawis.

Word of mouth

Other challenges remain, however, and Fadl says the battle to educate and 
inform women about self-examination and the local availability of affordable 
treatment is the next healthcare frontier.


“We did a little survey to ask the women how they heard about us. We found 
that the most effective, at 49%, was word of mouth. We are still a tribal 
community: we trust relatives, friends and neighbours who tell us ‘I went to 
that place and it is good’. We don’t have that culture of research on the 
internet,” says Fadl.

This was the case for 60-year-old Sudanese patient Fatma Abdelmajid, who 
regularly takes a six-hour bus from Atbara in north-east Sudan to Khartoum for 
treatment after a local doctor told her that “one of Atbara’s boys” worked at 
the KBCC clinic.

“The mentality around breast cancer here is absolutely wrong. When you tell 
women in the village that you’ve been diagnosed, they are so disturbed as if 
you’re about to drop dead in front of them. It’s really sad,” says Abdelmajid.

“They tell you, go to a fakeeh [spiritual healer], who will give you herbs and 
spiritual remedies to treat you. Ignorance is rife and I really hope and pray 
that women will come to the centre at least for a simple checkup.”

While the Sudanese health ministry keeps no full records, Lawis says that 
breast cancer accounts for approximately 35% of all cancer cases among Sudanese 
women. An estimated 60% of the 2,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer who die 
each year could have survived if given proper care.

Fadl strongly believes that stories like Abdelmajid’s will help end the taboo 
that often stops women from seeking a diagnosis. “A woman who has the 
experience of being treated should tell her stories, to new patients here at 
the centre and women in their villages. The best thing is to have these 
examples and success stories,” she says.

Fadl, who lives above the centre in Khartoum, patrols the corridors every day, 
greeting patients. “If I just walk downstairs and see the patients, see their 
kindness and deep gratitude, I just can’t help but want to help them. Sudanese 
women deserve everything I do – really and truly. I can’t tell you enough.”
