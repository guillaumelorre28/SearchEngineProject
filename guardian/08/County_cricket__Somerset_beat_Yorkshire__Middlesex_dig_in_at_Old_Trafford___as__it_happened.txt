Malan and Simpson survived until stumps, but it was seriously tough work. 
Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> lead by 140, and have 
six first innings wickets in hand. All four results possible.

 * A win takes Middlesex 20 ahead of Yorkshire and 21 in front of Somerset

 * A draw takes Middlesex 9 ahead of Yorkshire and 8 ahead of Somerset 
 * A Lancashire win takes Middlesex 4 ahead of Yorkshire and 3 ahead of 
Somerset 
Who you backing, folks?

Elsewhere, it looks like they won‚Äôt get back on at the Riverside, where Durham 
are 247 ahead, with two in hand.

Glamorgan are on the ropes against promoted Essex, Gloucestershire are in 
trouble at Northampton, and Wayne Madsen is approaching a ton as Derbyshire set 
the game up against Leicestershire.

Really tough going for Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex>
, this. Simpson has spent 14 balls on 0, while Malan has 10 from 51. Kerrigan 
bowling beautifully.

Somerset beat Yorkshire by 10 wickets!!!

Right, Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> will go into 
the final round leading the Championship. With how many points is anyone‚Äôs 
guess right now.

But.

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> will be second: 204

Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> will be third: 203

Compton is out. It was a fairly painful innings, to be honest. 10 off 46 and

are 39 for three, and this game is right in the balance.

And at Hove Worcestershire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/worcestershire> 
have beaten Sussex by 11 runs in a highly entertaining game. Archer was caught 
at second slip by Daryl Mitchell off Cummins for 16, Danny Briggs was well 
taken by D‚ÄôOliveira at square-leg off the same bowler, with 12 still needed, 
and Cummins finished off the match when he yorked Steve Magoffin‚Äôs middle stump 
first ball. Cummins finished with five for 82, and had match figures of 12 for 
166.

Something heroic has been happening here this afternoon. Phil Salt, driving, 
was caught at mid-off for 17 and when Ollie Robinson was run out for 42, having 
his middle stump thrown out by Brett D‚ÄôOliveira,Sussex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sussexccc> were floundering at 113 for six. 
Their target of 272 looked like a speck on the horizon, down the road by the 
sea.

But then Chris Jordan and David Wiese added 114 in 23 overs. When Jordan was 
seventh out, caught behind off Cummins for 50, his second half-century of the 
mach, Sussex were just 45 short of victory. Jofra Archer has joined Wiese and 
has made a confident start.

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are threatening a 
comeback. Still a long way to go, but the mood on the terraces has been lifted 
markedly by a 94-run stand between unbroken pair Jake Lehmann and Liam 
Plunkett, who have 112 and 50 respectively in a score of 256-7. The hosts lead 
by 11 runs at tea.

Rob Jones has become the youngest batsman to carry his bat for Lancashire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> since Cyril Washbrook in 1935. 
Remarkable.

Lester is bowled by Rayner and Lancs are all out for 259. Middlesex‚Äôs lead is 
68, it‚Äôs tea, and there are 35 overs left in the day.

Every Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> batsman shook 
Jones‚Äôs hand as he left the field.

Finn gets his man! Kerrigan lbw but it looked to me like it might have been 
going down. Anyway, that is Middlesex‚Äôs vital third bowling point, but Lancs 
have a vital second batting point too.

Wow! Rob Jones! That is outstanding. The man was back on the long-on fence, 
and he‚Äôs skipped down and hit it over his head for six. That‚Äôs the second time 
he‚Äôs done that to Rayner today. That was his 276th ball, and he‚Äôs gone 
absolutely gorillas on bringing it up, waving his bat at theLancashire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> balcony. What an effort. It‚Äôs 
240 for eight.

Wicket! Bailey edges Finn to Robson at slip. A stand of 88 ends, and out comes 
Kyle Jarvis. Two more wickets for a third bowling point for Middlesex; 
absolutely vital that they get it, I reckon.

Tom Bailey has 50! He‚Äôs dug in but played a few more shots lately, and reaches 
the milestone off 125 balls with a top edge over the slips off Finn. Jones has 
90, and Lancs are only 101 behind.

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> have reached 200-7, 
and they trail by just 45 now. Surely they can‚Äôt put pressure on, can they?

Jake Lehmann has made his way to 89, sparking a colleague to look up Darren‚Äôs 
statistics in a Yorkshire shirt. Jake‚Äôs old man scored a staggering 26 hundreds 
in 88 first-class matches.

Have a wonderful evening, and we look forward to hearing from you tomorrow!
 
Malan and Simpson survived until stumps, but it was seriously tough work. 
Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> lead by 140, and have 
six first innings wickets in hand. All four results possible.

 * A win takes Middlesex 20 ahead of Yorkshire and 21 in front of Somerset

 * A draw takes Middlesex 9 ahead of Yorkshire and 8 ahead of Somerset 
 * A Lancashire win takes Middlesex 4 ahead of Yorkshire and 3 ahead of 
Somerset 
Who you backing, folks?
 
Elsewhere, it looks like they won‚Äôt get back on at the Riverside, where Durham 
are 247 ahead, with two in hand.

Glamorgan are on the ropes against promoted Essex, Gloucestershire are in 
trouble at Northampton, and Wayne Madsen is approaching a ton as Derbyshire set 
the game up against Leicestershire.
 
Really tough going for Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex>
, this. Simpson has spent 14 balls on 0, while Malan has 10 from 51. Kerrigan 
bowling beautifully.
 
Right, Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> will go into 
the final round leading the Championship. With how many points is anyone‚Äôs 
guess right now.

But.

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> will be second: 204

Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> will be third: 203

Compton is out. It was a fairly painful innings, to be honest. 10 off 46 and 
gone lbw to Kerrigan.Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> 
are 39 for three, and this game is right in the balance.
 
They have bowled Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> out 
for 286, with Jack Leach claiming 6-64. He has just got Liam Plunkett caught at 
slip. There are 19 overs remaining in the day.

 
Sam Robson is gone. Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> 
lead by 104. It was Kerrigan‚Äôs first ball, and he looked to step across and 
hoick him to leg, but has been trapped in front. 36 for two.
 
Five for Scurran!

Get used to this post.
 
Jack Leach has five-for, and Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are nine down. Jack Brooks chips 
an easy return catch. 265-9.

 
Breakthrough for Somerset as Jack Leach takes his fourth wicket of the day, 
with Jake Lehmann lbw sweeping for a superb 116. That has leftYorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> at 263-8, a lead of 18. Former 
housemates Liam Plunkett and Jack Brooks at the crease now.

 
Durham fighting back well after a royal Scurraning.

And at Hove Worcestershire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/worcestershire> 
have beaten Sussex by 11 runs in a highly entertaining game. Archer was caught 
at second slip by Daryl Mitchell off Cummins for 16, Danny Briggs was well 
taken by D‚ÄôOliveira at square-leg off the same bowler, with 12 still needed, 
and Cummins finished off the match when he yorked Steve Magoffin‚Äôs middle stump 
first ball. Cummins finished with five for 82, and had match figures of 12 for 
166.
 
Two in two balls wrapped up an amazing 11-run win for Worcestershire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/worcestershire> at Hove. Look forward to 
reading what Paul has to say. What a game.
 
Kyle Jarvis‚Äôs first over has done the trick as Nick Gubbins edged to second 
slip without scoring. Having not recorded a duck all season, Gubbins has one in 
each of Middlesex‚Äôs last two first innings. Sam Robson struck two boundaries in 
Bailey‚Äôs first over, andMiddlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> 
are 11 for one.
 
Something heroic has been happening here this afternoon. Phil Salt, driving, 
was caught at mid-off for 17 and when Ollie Robinson was run out for 42, having 
his middle stump thrown out by Brett D‚ÄôOliveira,Sussex 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sussexccc> were floundering at 113 for six. 
Their target of 272 looked like a speck on the horizon, down the road by the 
sea.

But then Chris Jordan and David Wiese added 114 in 23 overs. When Jordan was 
seventh out, caught behind off Cummins for 50, his second half-century of the 
mach, Sussex were just 45 short of victory. Jofra Archer has joined Wiese and 
has made a confident start.
 
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are threatening a 
comeback. Still a long way to go, but the mood on the terraces has been lifted 
markedly by a 94-run stand between unbroken pair Jake Lehmann and Liam 
Plunkett, who have 112 and 50 respectively in a score of 256-7. The hosts lead 
by 11 runs at tea.

 
Rob Jones has become the youngest batsman to carry his bat for Lancashire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> since Cyril Washbrook in 1935. 
Remarkable.

Lester is bowled by Rayner and Lancs are all out for 259. Middlesex‚Äôs lead is 
68, it‚Äôs tea, and there are 35 overs left in the day.

Every Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> batsman shook 
Jones‚Äôs hand as he left the field.
 
Finn gets his man! Kerrigan lbw but it looked to me like it might have been 
going down. Anyway, that is Middlesex‚Äôs vital third bowling point, but Lancs 
have a vital second batting point too.
 
Here‚Äôs Rob Jones‚Äôs big moment.

Wow! Rob Jones! That is outstanding. The man was back on the long-on fence, 
and he‚Äôs skipped down and hit it over his head for six. That‚Äôs the second time 
he‚Äôs done that to Rayner today. That was his 276th ball, and he‚Äôs gone 
absolutely gorillas on bringing it up, waving his bat at theLancashire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> balcony. What an effort. It‚Äôs 
240 for eight.
 
Jake Lehmann has reached a fine century off 168 balls with 11x4s. Excellent 
knock and the first ton of the match.Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are now 225-7, trailing by 20. 

 
Kerrigan flicks the hat-trick ball to leg for one. Easy as you like.
 
Two in two! Jarvis fends a Finn snorter straight to gully. One wicket for that 
point, seven runs for Jones‚Äôs ton...
 
Wicket! Bailey edges Finn to Robson at slip. A stand of 88 ends, and out comes 
Kyle Jarvis. Two more wickets for a third bowling point for Middlesex; 
absolutely vital that they get it, I reckon.
 
Tom Bailey has 50! He‚Äôs dug in but played a few more shots lately, and reaches 
the milestone off 125 balls with a top edge over the slips off Finn. Jones has 
90, and Lancs are only 101 behind.
 
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> have reached 200-7, 
and they trail by just 45 now. Surely they can‚Äôt put pressure on, can they?

Jake Lehmann has made his way to 89, sparking a colleague to look up Darren‚Äôs 
statistics in a Yorkshire shirt. Jake‚Äôs old man scored a staggering 26 hundreds 
in 88 first-class matches.
 
Four wickets in seven balls for Sam Curran!
 
Sam Curran!

The new ball has been taken here at Old Trafford. Murtagh has it, and Lancs

Middlesex <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/middlesex> are displaying quite

overs until it‚Äôs available and it‚Äôs 173-6.
