The cost of tourist essentials, such as meals and drinks, were compared to 
rank the destinations in order of value for UK tourists. The Algarve, in 
Portugal, emerged as the cheapest for the first time in five years, following a 
year-on-year drop in prices of over 18%.

Visitors to the Algarve can expect to pay an average of £16.77 for a 
three-course evening meal for two, including wine; £134 less than the 
equivalent meal at the most expensive destination, Jumeirah, Dubai.

The second-cheapest destination is the Bulgarian resort of Sunny Beach, which 
has seen a similar 18% price drop. There you can enjoy a local beer for 60p. 
Cape Town is the third-cheapest destination in the report, which found that a 
cup of coffee or a beer in the South African city costs around 91p.

Not every destination has seen prices plummet. Bali is placed eighth after 
costs increased by nearly 6% over the last year. However, a beer in a bar will 
still only set you back 83p and a 1.5-litre bottle of water costs just 29p. 
Last year Prague came out as the cheapest destination, but rising meal prices 
have pushed overall costs in the Czech capital up by almost 14%.

The strong dollar also makes trips to the US and Caribbean more expensive, 
with prices jumping at resorts such as Orlando, where costs are up 9%.

According to Post Office Travel Money, if sterling continues to hold its 
value, UK holidaymakers will be able to get a lot more for their money at a 
wide choice of destinations. “InEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, the best deals are likely to 
be in Portugal and Bulgaria, where increased competition to attract tourists 
has resulted in lower prices for tourist staples,” said spokesperson Andrew 
Brown.

“Once the exchange rate is factored in, tourists should see their spending 
costs shrink. For those travelling further afield, Cape Town, Bali and Tokyo 
look good bets for the bargain-hunter.”
