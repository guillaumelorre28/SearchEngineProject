Llanthony Priory 
The remains of a beautiful monastery not far from Abergavenny is an 
atmospheric spot for observing the night sky. Some of the ruins were converted

llanthonyprioryhotel.co.uk <http://www.llanthonyprioryhotel.co.uk>, doubles 
from £85 B&B), which also has a bar, possibly once the prior's quarters. Or try 
a nearby Llanthony Treats bunkhouse (01873 890867,llanthonytreats.co.uk

Hay Bluff 
The road over Gospel Pass from Llanthony reaches Hay Bluff, a hill overlooking 
the Wye valley with great views over Powys and Shropshire. After stargazing 
from the summit, carry on to lovely Hay-on-Wye.

situated for looking at the stars (01639 730725,craigynoscastle.com
