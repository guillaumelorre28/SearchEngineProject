In 1994, magistrates from the Italian province of Ancona found the manager of 
a local circus guilty of importing a gorilla into the country. Bobby (variously 
also known as Bongo, Bongo III and Bongo Junior) had been captured as a baby in 
Equatorial Guinea more than a decade earlier and is thought to have been 
brought to Italy soon afterwards as “a chimpanzee”.

Either way – gorilla or chimpanzee – the transportation of Bobby was in direct 
contravention of theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of 
Wild Fauna and Flora <https://www.cites.org/> (CITES), an international 
agreement signed in Washington D.C. in 1973 and eventually ratified by Italy in 
1979. CITES binds parties to pass appropriate national legislation to allow its 
implementation, but it took the Italian Parliament until 1992 to do this (Legge 
7 Febbraio 1992, n. 150 
<http://www.sviluppoeconomico.gov.it/images/stories/commercio_internazionale/cites/Legge_150_1992.pdf>
, if you must know). It was only then that the Italian authorities were in a 
position “to penalize trade in, or possession of, such specimens,” and “to 
provide the confiscation or return to the State of export of such specimens.”

“The Italian Parliament took thirteen years, one month and 22 days to 
translate into Italian the Latin expressionnulla poena sine lege 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nulla_poena_sine_lege>,” quipped professor of 
international law Tullio Scovazzi in theEuropean Environmental Law Review 
<http://www.kluwerlawonline.com/abstract.php?area=Journals&id=EELR1996055>. 

Bobby was confiscated from the circus, but instead of being repatriated to 
Equatorial Guinea ended up under the custodianship of theGiardino Zoologico di 
Roma <http://www.bioparco.it/english/>. There, he lived alongside Romana, a 
female gorilla of a similar age that had been born in captivity in 1980. 
According toa history of gorillas at Rome Zoo 
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044516913000397>, Bobby’s 
new situation resulted in “a considerable improvement both in the physical 
aspect and the behavioural profile.” When the “ape house” finally closed in 
2000 and became a restaurant, Bobby and Romana moved to Bristol Zoo.

When Bobby died in December 2008, his remains were given to the National 
Museum of Scotland <http://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/> in 
Edinburgh. On 9 December, he will return to the public gaze for the first time 
in almost a decade. He is one of over 60 taxidermy specimens to appear inMonkey 
Business 
<http://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/whats-on/monkey-business/>, 
an exhibition that will showcase the diversity of the primate family and 
explore “how primates have evolved and adapted, how they communicate, and the 
tools they have developed to obtain food.” The exhibition “reveals their 
complex social systems and looks at the relationship between primates and 
humans today.”

It is easy to be critical of the events that led to Bobby’s capture more than 
30 years ago and feel sadness for the life he spent among humans rather than 
with other gorillas in the wilds of Equatorial Guinea. But the even sadder 
reality is that he might have been safer in captivity. The possession, hunting, 
sale and consumption of primates in Equatorial Guinea only became illegal in 
2007 and it takes time for a law to result in cultural change. Celebrity 
animals like Bobby that have moved humans have a lot to achieve, even in death, 
revealing the beauty and fragility of the natural world and the value of 
protecting it.

Monkey Business 
<http://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/whats-on/monkey-business/> 
will run from Friday 9 December 2016 to Sunday 23 April 2017 at the National 
Museum of Scotland, Chambers Street, Edinburgh. Admission: £10 adults, £8 
concession, children (age 12-15) £7. Entry is free to National Museums Scotland 
Members and children under 12.
