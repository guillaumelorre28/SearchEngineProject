Banksy spotting

Bristol is the home city of the street artist Banksy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/banksy>. There are organised tours to 
help you spot his creations but it may be just as rewarding (and cheaper) to 
plan a self-guided walk. It's more fun to happen on the murals rather than have 
them pointed out. Don't miss his Mild Mild West creation in bohemian Stokes 
Croft, featuring a teddy bear getting ready to hurl a petrol bomb. On the way, 
you are bound to bump into other less famous but nonetheless vivid work from 
other artists. From Stokes Croft, St Paul's – where many of Bristol's 
African-Caribbean population settled in the 1950s – is a short walk and worth a 
detour.

Walking

Like Rome, Bristol is said to be built on seven hills, so it's a great place 
for energy-burning city hikes. Ashton Court Estate, a country park on the far 
side of the Clifton suspension bridge boasts 850 acres of woods and grassland. 
Deer park, golf courses, horse riding, mountain biking and more. The estate 
also hosts the spectacular international balloon fiesta in August.
• Long Ashton, 0117 963 9174, bristol.gov.uk/ashton-court-estate 
<http://www.bristol.gov.uk/page/leisure-and-culture/ashton-court-estate>. Open 
from 8am, admission free though there is a charge for some events

SS Great Britain

Bristol is a port. Its prosperity is built on sea trade and an ideal place to 
get to grips with the city is the revamped harbourside. Berthed and lovingly 
preserved in the Great Western Dockyard where she was built,Isambard Kingdom 
Brunel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2013/oct/21/photography-isambard-kingdom-brunel>
's magnificent ocean-going steamship is a gleaming embodiment of the city's 
seafaring past. Visitors can stride the decks, explore the luxury first-class 
cabins and peer into the rather more cramped cooks' galley. From April, those 
with a head for heights will be able to climb the mainmast (strapped in a 
harness) and step out on to the mainyard.
• Gas Ferry Road, ssgreatbritain.org <http://www.ssgreatbritain.org/>. Open 
daily 10am-5.30pm (4.30pm in winter), adult £13.75, five-17 years £7

Harbour boat trips

A cheaper option for a flavour of Bristol's maritime past and present is a 
boat trip around the harbour, along the Avon to Brunel's suspension bridge or 
further afield. Jumping on to one of the commuter services that flit around the 
floating harbour (so called because the tidal river has been impounded to allow 
ships to stay afloat) is an excellent way of getting on to the water.
• Cascade Steps (next to Watershed cinema), bristolferry.com 
<http://bristolferry.com/>, 0117 927 3416. Waterbuses run from 10am-6pm, single 
fares from £2.40 adult, £1.90 concs

M Shed

This new museum in a former transit shed on the harbourside runs through the 
story of Bristol from prehistoric times (the city has its own modest dinosaur, 
the Thecodontosaurus) to the slave trade days, and on to the 20th century when 
Concorde was developed here and right up to the present day. From the end of 
May to September, there'll be a Wallace & Gromit exhibition, too.
• Princes Wharf, Wapping Road, mshed.org <http://mshed.org/>. Open Tues-Fri 
10am-5pm, weekends and bank holidays 10am-6pm, admission free

Clifton suspension bridge

No visit to Bristol is complete without a pilgrimage to this breathtaking 
symbol of the city. It was Brunel's first major commission, though it was not 
completed until 1864 – after his death. The bridge spans the Avon gorge, 75m 
above the high tide mark. Crossing free for walkers and cyclists.

Bristol Zoo

One of the UK's most popular zoos is set in five hectares of gardens in 
Clifton and is "home" to gorillas, big cats, penguins and seals. Last year, the 
zoo opened a new satellite site on the edge of the city calledThe Wild Place 
Project <http://www.wildplace.org.uk/>, which features zebras, okapi and 
lemurs. A wolf enclosure opens early next month. For those who prefer their 
animals a little less wild,St Werburghs City Farm <http://www.swcityfarm.co.uk/>
 is a good friendly bet.

Cycling

Bristol was named England's first "cycling city" in 2008 and is home to the 
charity Sustrans, which champions travel by bike, foot or public transport. So, 
not surprisingly, there are a range of cycle routes to explore. Highlights 
include theBristol to Bath cycle path 
<http://www.bristolbathrailwaypath.org.uk/home.shtml> – 9.5 miles one way. But 
there are also shorter, circular routes around the harbour and river. There are 
also good cycle hire shops in the city.

St Nicholas Market

A great deal of fuss was made when the Cabot Circus mall opened in 2008. Much 
more characterful shopping and eating is to be found at St Nicholas Market in 
the city centre. Vintage clothes, jewellery, a record store plus a lovely 
old-fashioned sweet shop. Food stalls and cafes cater to most tastes, plus 
there is Bristol's very ownPieminister pie and mash shop

Theatres and circus

Bristol is blessed with wonderful theatres and other arts spaces. The Bristol 
Old Vic <http://www.bristololdvic.org.uk> is the longest continuously running 
theatre in the UK, while theHippodrome 
<http://www.atgtickets.com/venues/bristol-hippodrome/> has one of the largest

<http://www.tobaccofactorytheatres.com/> theatre is a more recent addition to 
the city's cultural life. TheWatershed <http://www.watershed.co.uk> cinema 
combines movie screenings for children with workshops. Bristol is also a circus
