North Wales has been named among the top places in the world to visit in 2017 
according to Lonely Planet’s annualBest in Travel 
<http://www.lonelyplanet.com/best-in-travel> list. 

Placed fourth on the list of regions to visit, north Wales is the only UK 
destination to be featured in the rankings, which are compiled by a panel of 
the travel publisher’s writers and experts.

North Wales was praised for its host of new adventure attractions, such as 
Surf Snowdonia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/01/surfsnowdonia-surfing-lake-wales-snowdonia>
 in the Conwy Valley, an inland surfing lake described as “the most 
headline-stealing example of the region’s reinvention”.

Other attractions that drew Lonely Planet’s attention are Zip World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/20/worlds-largest-underground-zipline-course-opens-in-wales>
 which has attractions at three locations in north Wales, including the world’s 
fastest and Europe’s longest zip line, the first four-person zip line, and

North Wales is ranked ahead of regions including South Australia, Perak in 
Malaysia and Aysen, Chile.

Topping the list is Choquequirao, Peru 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/peru>, which is expected to see the opening 
of a new cable car next year and is home to a spectacular Inca settlement, 
which Lonely Planet describes as like “exploring Machu Picchu before the hordes 
and mass commerce.”

In second place is Taranaki, New Zealand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/newzealand>, a rarely visited destination 
which has natural assets that have “long been envied”, along with an emerging 
cultural scene thanks to the opening of the Len Lye Centre, New Plymouth’s 
“answer to the Guggenheim”, as well as hosting the Womad world music festival.

The Azores 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/28/the-azores-holiday-guide-portugal-islands>
 archipelago, a mid-Atlantic outpost of Portugal, came third in the rankings, 
praised by Lonely Planet for its blend of “amazing nature and super-cool 
Iberian culture”.

Other categories in the list include the top 10 countries, which this year was 
topped byCanada <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/canada>, and the top 
cities, withBordeaux <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/bordeaux> in first
