Lunchtime summary

 * Jeremy Corbyn has surprised some of his colleagues by calling for a law 
imposing a maximum cap on wages. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/10/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-maximum-wage-law>
He backed the idea when asked about it during a Today programme interview 
largely focused on a big speech on Brexit he is giving this morning.He had 
proposed a wage cap during the Labour leadership election in 2015, 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3208655/Watch-Corbyn-targets-organisation-Britain-vows-cut-ludicrous-salaries-paid-company-bosses.html>
 but it is not an idea that he has pushed as party leader until today. Several 
Labour MPs have said they do not support his proposal - on the World at One 
just now Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said she was 
fully committed to tackling inequality, but declined to say she personally 
thought this was a good idea - and two former Corbyn economics advisers,Richard 
Murphyand Danny Blanchflower, have respectively described the plan as “absurd” 
and “totally idiotic”. (See 11.07pm

 * Corbyn has insisted that Labour is no longer fully committed to EU free 
movement. In extracts from a speech released overnight he said Labour was “not 
wedded to freedom of movement for EU citizens as a point of principle”. (See 
9.45am.) This was seen as a concession to Labour MPs who want the party to 
accept the need for migration controls and it was welcomed overnight byMichael 
Dugher, who in the past has been one of Corbyn’s strongest critics in the party.
Michael Dugher MP (@MichaelDugher) 
Welcome intervention by Jeremy: fair rules, managed migration + policies to 
reduce unskilled EU migration by tackling undercutting are right

 <https://twitter.com/MichaelDugher/status/818704991057825794> 
But, in successive interviews this morning, he suggested that his own personal 
support for free movement remained unchanged. He declined to commit to a target 
for cutting immigration and, when asked what immigration measures Labour would 
support, he focused on plans to stop workplace exploitation and refused to back 
thoseLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs calling for 
quotas for unskilled EU migrants. The Conservatives and Ukip both claimed this 
meant he was not serious about reducing immigration.

 * Corbyn has said he would be prepared to join the striking Southern rail 
workers on a picket line, blaming the government for protecting the company 
despite its poor performance.

 * Martin McGuinness, Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, may announce 
that he is not going to stand for re-election to the Northern Ireland assembly, 
it has emerged. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/10/martin-mcguinness-decision-to-stand-northern-ireland-assembly-election>

elections seem likely. Siobhan Fenton (@SiobhanFenton)

 * Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has said that a Brext deal that 
jeopardised trade between the UK and Germany would be “the heigh of insanity”. 
Taking questions in the Commons he said: 
As you will know very well there is now a big operation going on by UKTI (UK 
Trade & Investment), by British diplomacy to point out the salient facts that 
German investment in this country is responsible for about 344,000 jobs here in 
the UK, UK investment in Germany is responsible for 222,000 jobs. It would be 
the height of insanity to imperil either of those sets of investments.

 * The Office for National Statistics has published figures showing that 
during the last financial year the poorest households gained more in disposable 
income than the richest households. 
<https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2016>
The median UK household disposable income was £26,300 in the financial year 
ending 2016 (2015/16); this was £600 higher than the previous year and £1,000 
higher than the pre-downturn value of £25,400 in 2007/08 (after accounting for 
inflation and household composition).

Median disposable income for the poorest fifth of households rose by £700 
(5.1%) between 2014/15 and 2015/16; in contrast the income of the richest fifth 
of households fell by £1,000 (1.9%) over the same period.

The report also says there has been “a gradual decline in income inequality in 
the last 10 years, with levels similar to those seen in the mid to late 1980s”.

 * Brexit poses a risk to the global financial system and could involve tens 
of thousands of job losses in the City, MPs have been warned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/10/hard-brexit-threatens-global-financial-system-city-chiefs-tell-mps>
.As Jill Treanor reports, Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> Stock Exchange (LSE), warned that 
Brexit could have an impact on “unimaginably large” contracts which are cleared 
through the City and which might need to be transferred to the 27 remaining EU 
member states. The HSBC chairman,Douglas Flint, also giving evidence to the 
Treasury select committee, said that while banks did not want to move 
activities outside London they had to plan for the worst. 
 * More than 2 million people had to wait more than four hours at A&E units 
last year, a sharp rise on the previous year, official NHS figures have shown. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/10/more-than-2m-people-wait-over-four-hours-in-a-and-e-nhs-figures-show>
 * John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said NHS funding levels should 
be checked by the government’s budget watchdog. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/10/john-mcdonnell-calls-for-nhs-funding-audit-as-winter-crisis-deepens>
 * McDonnell has called for plans to close dozens of local tax offices to be 
abandoned following the publication of a report from the National Audit Office 
saying costs of the closure programme have spiralled. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/10/plans-to-close-scores-of-tax-offices-unrealistic-hmrc-nao-report>
 Speaking during a Commons urgent question he said: 
We have warned consistently on this side that the government’s proposals will 
have a detrimental impact on HMRC’s ability to provide advice, and also to 
tackle tax evasion and tax avoidance. The NAO report has confirmed our fears 
... As we predicted, this is an emerging disaster.

Treasury minister Jane Ellison admitted that the costs of the moves were 
likely to be “higher than was first forecast” but she said the government was 
committed to the modernisation programme.

Faisal Islam, Sky’s political editor, has posted some useful background about 
earnings caps on Twitter.
Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) 
No current democracy has a maximum wage law - Switzerland put version to 
referendum (12:1 ratio) in Nov 13, failed:https://t.co/BWH7bufDot

applied it, loads of bankers resigned:https://t.co/58AM9vQ2xd

But Islam is in Peterborough, where Corbyn will be delivering his speech this 
afternoon, and he says he has found support for the Labour leader’s idea.

Owen Smith, who challenged Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> for the Labour leadership 
last summer but who was beaten quite easily, has used Twitter to express his 
doubts about Corbyn’s earnings cap proposal.
Owen Smith (@OwenSmith_MP) 
Corbyn is right to challenge gross inequality in earnings. But comprehensive & 
progressive reform of our tax system is the way to fix it.

<https://twitter.com/OwenSmith_MP/status/818786163171409921> 
The Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP John Mann also has 
his reservations.
John Mann (@JohnMannMP) 
Looks like Jeremy is going to war with the PFA and footballers. In my view the 
important issues are fair taxation and stopping tax evasion

<https://twitter.com/JohnMannMP/status/818764416946728960> 
But Mann says he does support a wages cap within the Labour party.
John Mann (@JohnMannMP) 
Time for a wages cap inside the Parliamentary Labour Party and the trade 
unions. Jeremy has the chance to demonstrate his commitment.

a PLP salary cap of 100,000 would be an appropriate next stage for Jeremy's 
wages cap. Walk the walk etc. A vote winner, me thinks.

Unsurprisingly, Downing Street has said the government will not be taking up 
Jeremy Corbyn’s earnings cap proposal. This is from my colleague Peter Walker.
Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) 
Theresa May not about to take up Corbyn's maximum wage plan, her spokeswoman 
says: "It is not a policy we are pursuing."

Sir Simon Burns, a Conservative, asks if the UK government will take the same 
approach to Russia as the Trump administration. He condemns the hacking of the 
Democrats’ emails. (Burns is a big fan of the Democrats, and Hillary Clinton in 
particular.)

Johnson says the UK thinks the Russians have been involved in many “dirty 
tricks”. But it would be a mistake to “demonise” them and push them into a 
corner, he says.

Liz McInnes, a shadow Foreign Office minister, says Johnson met Donald Trump’s 
adviser Stephen Bannon on Sunday night. She says his Breitbart website is 
racist, misogynistic, and homophobic and it hero worships President Putin. How 
did he and Johnson get on?

Johnson says he is not going to embarrass anyone he met by saying how much he 
did or did not like them.

 * Jeremy Corbyn has surprised some of his colleagues by calling for a law 
imposing a maximum cap on wages. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/10/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-maximum-wage-law>
He backed the idea when asked about it during a Today programme interview 
largely focused on a big speech on Brexit he is giving this morning.He had 
proposed a wage cap during the Labour leadership election in 2015, 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3208655/Watch-Corbyn-targets-organisation-Britain-vows-cut-ludicrous-salaries-paid-company-bosses.html>
 but it is not an idea that he has pushed as party leader until today. Several 
Labour MPs have said they do not support his proposal - on the World at One 
just now Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said she was 
fully committed to tackling inequality, but declined to say she personally 
thought this was a good idea - and two former Corbyn economics advisers,Richard 
Murphyand Danny Blanchflower, have respectively described the plan as “absurd” 
and “totally idiotic”. (See 11.07pm

 * Corbyn has insisted that Labour is no longer fully committed to EU free 
movement. In extracts from a speech released overnight he said Labour was “not 
wedded to freedom of movement for EU citizens as a point of principle”. (See 
9.45am.) This was seen as a concession to Labour MPs who want the party to 
accept the need for migration controls and it was welcomed overnight byMichael 
Dugher, who in the past has been one of Corbyn’s strongest critics in the party.
Michael Dugher MP (@MichaelDugher) 
Welcome intervention by Jeremy: fair rules, managed migration + policies to 
reduce unskilled EU migration by tackling undercutting are right
https://t.co/KiVXfYxav4 <https://t.co/KiVXfYxav4>
 <https://twitter.com/MichaelDugher/status/818704991057825794> January 10, 2017
 <https://twitter.com/MichaelDugher/status/818704991057825794> 
But, in successive interviews this morning, he suggested that his own personal 
support for free movement remained unchanged. He declined to commit to a target 
for cutting immigration and, when asked what immigration measures Labour would 
support, he focused on plans to stop workplace exploitation and refused to back 
thoseLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs calling for 
quotas for unskilled EU migrants. The Conservatives and Ukip both claimed this 
meant he was not serious about reducing immigration.

 * Corbyn has said he would be prepared to join the striking Southern rail 
workers on a picket line, blaming the government for protecting the company 
despite its poor performance.

 * Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has said that a Brext deal that 
jeopardised trade between the UK and Germany would be “the heigh of insanity”. 
Taking questions in the Commons he said: 
As you will know very well there is now a big operation going on by UKTI (UK 
Trade & Investment), by British diplomacy to point out the salient facts that 
German investment in this country is responsible for about 344,000 jobs here in 
the UK, UK investment in Germany is responsible for 222,000 jobs. It would be 
the height of insanity to imperil either of those sets of investments.

 * The Office for National Statistics has published figures showing that 
during the last financial year the poorest households gained more in disposable 
income than the richest households. 
<https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2016>
The median UK household disposable income was £26,300 in the financial year 
ending 2016 (2015/16); this was £600 higher than the previous year and £1,000 
higher than the pre-downturn value of £25,400 in 2007/08 (after accounting for 
inflation and household composition).

Median disposable income for the poorest fifth of households rose by £700 
(5.1%) between 2014/15 and 2015/16; in contrast the income of the richest fifth 
of households fell by £1,000 (1.9%) over the same period.

The report also says there has been “a gradual decline in income inequality in 
the last 10 years, with levels similar to those seen in the mid to late 1980s”.

 * Brexit poses a risk to the global financial system and could involve tens 
of thousands of job losses in the City, MPs have been warned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/10/hard-brexit-threatens-global-financial-system-city-chiefs-tell-mps>
.As Jill Treanor reports, Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> Stock Exchange (LSE), warned that 
Brexit could have an impact on “unimaginably large” contracts which are cleared 
through the City and which might need to be transferred to the 27 remaining EU 
member states. The HSBC chairman,Douglas Flint, also giving evidence to the 
Treasury select committee, said that while banks did not want to move 
activities outside London they had to plan for the worst. 
 * More than 2 million people had to wait more than four hours at A&E units 
last year, a sharp rise on the previous year, official NHS figures have shown. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/10/more-than-2m-people-wait-over-four-hours-in-a-and-e-nhs-figures-show>
 * John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said NHS funding levels should 
be checked by the government’s budget watchdog. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/10/john-mcdonnell-calls-for-nhs-funding-audit-as-winter-crisis-deepens>
 * McDonnell has called for plans to close dozens of local tax offices to be 
abandoned following the publication of a report from the National Audit Office 
saying costs of the closure programme have spiralled. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/10/plans-to-close-scores-of-tax-offices-unrealistic-hmrc-nao-report>
 Speaking during a Commons urgent question he said: 
We have warned consistently on this side that the government’s proposals will 
have a detrimental impact on HMRC’s ability to provide advice, and also to 
tackle tax evasion and tax avoidance. The NAO report has confirmed our fears 
... As we predicted, this is an emerging disaster.

Treasury minister Jane Ellison admitted that the costs of the moves were 
likely to be “higher than was first forecast” but she said the government was 
committed to the modernisation programme.

 
The BBC’s economics editor Kamal Ahmed has written a blog about Jeremy Corbyn 
‘s wages cap proposal. <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38570434>He says in 
1942 the American president Franklin D Roosevelt proposed a 100% tax on 
earnings over $25,000 (£330,000 in today’s money.)
 
Faisal Islam, Sky’s political editor, has posted some useful background about 
earnings caps on Twitter.

Owen Smith, who challenged Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> for the Labour leadership 
last summer but who was beaten quite easily, has used Twitter to express his 
doubts about Corbyn’s earnings cap proposal.
Owen Smith (@OwenSmith_MP) 
Corbyn is right to challenge gross inequality in earnings. But comprehensive & 
progressive reform of our tax system is the way to fix it.

The Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP John Mann also has 
his reservations.
John Mann (@JohnMannMP) 
Looks like Jeremy is going to war with the PFA and footballers. In my view the 
important issues are fair taxation and stopping tax evasion

<https://twitter.com/JohnMannMP/status/818764416946728960> 
But Mann says he does support a wages cap within the Labour party.
John Mann (@JohnMannMP) 
Time for a wages cap inside the Parliamentary Labour Party and the trade 
unions. Jeremy has the chance to demonstrate his commitment.

wages cap. Walk the walk etc. A vote winner, me thinks.

Unsurprisingly, Downing Street has said the government will not be taking up 
Jeremy Corbyn’s earnings cap proposal. This is from my colleague Peter Walker.
Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) 
Theresa May not about to take up Corbyn's maximum wage plan, her spokeswoman 
says: "It is not a policy we are pursuing."

Sir Simon Burns, a Conservative, asks if the UK government will take the same 
approach to Russia as the Trump administration. He condemns the hacking of the 
Democrats’ emails. (Burns is a big fan of the Democrats, and Hillary Clinton in 
particular.)

Johnson says the UK thinks the Russians have been involved in many “dirty 
tricks”. But it would be a mistake to “demonise” them and push them into a 
corner, he says.
 
The Ukip MP Douglas Carswell asks how quickly the UK could sign a free trade 
deal with the US.

Johnson says his enthusiasm for a free trade deal was nothing compared to the 
Americans’.
 
Liz McInnes, a shadow Foreign Office minister, says Johnson met Donald Trump’s 
adviser Stephen Bannon on Sunday night. She says his Breitbart website is 
racist, misogynistic, and homophobic and it hero worships President Putin. How 
did he and Johnson get on?

Johnson says he is not going to embarrass anyone he met by saying how much he 
did or did not like them.
 
In the Commons Boris Johnson is now taking about his meetings with the Trump 
team in the US.

Henry Smith, a Conservative, asks about Johnson’s meeting with Congressional 
leaders.

Johnson says he found “a huge fund of goodwill” for the UK on Capitol Hill. 
They want to do a free trade deal, and do one quickly, he says.
 
Danny Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy 
committee and a former member of Corbyn’s economic advisory committee, 
<http://press.labour.org.uk/post/129975218774/labour-announces-new-economic-advisory-committee>
