Today in Campaign 2016

 * Donald Trump railed against his fellow Republicans on Twitter on Tuesday 
morning, after a week in whichmany in the party have deserted him 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/trump-spiralling-disaster-desertion-wikileaks-russia>
 following the release of a tape of himboasting about groping women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women>
. 
 * The move came as prominent Republicans Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both 
reaffirmed that they were standing by the nominee. Trump described his party – 
which he first joined in 1987 before several years as a Democrat and an 
independent – as disloyal and unable to win, while labeling the House speaker, 
Paul Ryan, the most senior Republican in Congress, “very weak and ineffective”. 
Ryan has been a vocal critic of Trump’s and this week announced he would no 
longer defend Trump or campaign with him, although hestopped short of formally 
unendorsing him 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans>
.

 * Barack Obama assailed Republican nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> on Tuesday over remarks about 
groping women, also criticizing Republicans who continued to support the 
candidate. “You don’t have to be a husband or a father to hear what we heard 
just a few days ago and say that’s not right,” the president said in 
Greensboro, North Carolina, in his first public remarks since the release of a
2005 tape showing Trump bragging about groping and kissing women without their 
consent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video>
. “You just have to be a decent human being to say that’s not right.”

 * Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> used 
the global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on 
Tuesday, enlisting the help of her husband’s former vice-president Al Gore to 
urge America’s voters not to risk sending a “climate change denier” to the 
White House. In a joint address in Miami, Clinton and Gore repeatedly hammered 
the Republican nominee for his stance on climate change and his belief that 
global warming is ahoax initiated by the Chinese 
<https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en>. 
“Climate change is real, it’s urgent, and America can take the lead in the 
world in addressing it,” Clinton said, promising investment in clean energy.

 * The 2016 campaign has jumped the shark. Specifically, the shark from Jaws 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jaws>. In a conversation with Fox News host 
Megyn Kelly, former Arkansas governorMike Huckabee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/mike-huckabee-suspends-campaign-iowa-caucus>
 declared that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may be rough around 
the edges, but when the chips are down, he’s the person you can trust to save 
your life – not unlike Captain Quint in the film Jaws.

<https://twitter.com/Jzokun/status/785708353360060416> 
 * The repercussions were swift following last Friday’s leak of the Access 
Hollywood tape, in which Donald Trump can be heard bragging about sexually 
assaulting women: House speaker Paul Ryantold fellow Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans>
 that he would no longer defend the party’s nominee, while hordes of party 
members distanced themselves from Trump’s comments with some – including 
Senator John McCain – even saying they could no longer vote for Trump. 
Supposedly, things could get even worse for the Republican nominee. 
 * Following the release of the footage by the Washington Post, Bill Pruitt, a 
producer on the first two seasons of The Apprentice, the NBC reality show Trump 
hosted from 2004-2015,tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/billpruitt/status/784872190587998209> that there are “far 
worse” behind-the-scenes tapes of Trump on the program. Emmy award-winning 
producer Chris Nee hasalleged 
<http://theslot.jezebel.com/producer-says-theres-video-of-trump-saying-the-n-word-1787592521>
 that Trump says the n-word in the recordings. Bill Pruitt (@billpruitt) 
As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/theapprentice?src=hash> I assure you: when it 
comes to the#trumptapes <https://twitter.com/hashtag/trumptapes?src=hash> there

 * The BeyHive did not take kindly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/11/beyonce-hillary-clinton-betsy-mccaughey-trump-supporter>
 to Trump surrogate Betsy McCaughey calling Hillary Clinton a hypocrite for 
criticizing Donald Trump’s sexist remarks despite also being a fan ofBeyoncé 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce>. “Hillary Clinton expresses that 
she finds the language on that bus horrific,” said McCaughey on CNN on Monday, 
noting that she herself did not like “rap music”. “But in fact she likes 
language like this: ‘I came to slay bitch, when he fuck me good, I take his ass 
to Red Lobster,’” quoting Beyoncé’s songFormation

Texas congressman Blake Farenthold has swiftly apologized for telling an MSNBC 
anchor that he would have to think about revoking his endorsement of a 
candidate who said that he “really liked raping women.”

Hillary Clinton’s campaign fired back on Tuesday as Wikileaks released a new 
tranche of hacked emails from the account of its chairman John Podesta, dubbing 
the website a “propaganda arm of the Russian government” seeking to help elect 
Republican nomineeDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>
.

The latest batch of more than 2,000 emails, disclosed on Monday, offered a 
glimpse into the inner workings of the Clinton campaign. They included insights 
on multiple fronts, such as a lack of preparedness for Bernie Sanders’ 
insurgent campaign, concerns raised by Chelsea Clinton over potential conflicts 
of interest for the family’s foundation, and efforts by aides on how to best 
frame the former secretary of state’s second bid for the White House.

Last week, Wikileaks published other hacked emails from Podesta’s account, 
which includedalleged excerpts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-paid-wall-street-speeches>
 of Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street. Clinton’s campaign has neither 
confirmed nor denied authenticity of the emails, but in recent days escalated 
its charge that the hack was conducted by Russian state actors.


Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton’s campaign, fired off a tweet storm late 
Monday in which he assailed Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, for 
working on behalf of the Russian government.

“You are no media organization,” Fallon tweeted at Wikileaks. “You are a 
propaganda arm of the Russian government, running interference for their pet 
candidate, Trump.”

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, making his 
first appearance in a one-on-one interview since the release of video 
recordings that showed him bragging about sexually assaulting women and since 
the second presidential debate, petulantly told Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly that “I 
get along with everybody” that that House speaker Paul Ryan had committed a 
craven act of political betrayal by refusing to defend him.

“We’ve been having a problem - we have millions and millions of followers,” 
Trump said, “and Paul Ryan, open borders and amnesty and bad budgets by the 
way, very, very bad budgets... The shackles are some of the establishment 
people the weak and ineffective people within the party.”


“They’re not giving support - they don’t give the kind of support,” Trump 
said, when O’Reilly asked why he was so angry with Republican leadership. “They 
don’t give the support that we really need. Maybe we’ll do better without their 
support.”

When O’Reilly asked if Trump’s “throwing off of the shackles” of cooperating 
with Republicans meant that he would become more outspoken, Trump denied that 
he was outspoken at all.

“I don’t think I’m that outspoken to be honest with you - I think I’ve been 
very nice,” Trump said. “I don’t think so - look, I went to Ivy League schools.”

“I’m just tired of nonsupport - and I don’t really want support.”


Asked how he would address his cratering support among women after release of 
video in which he grabbed about being able to “grab [women] by the pussy” 
without consequence because of his fame, Trump dismissed the remarks as “locker 
room talk.”

“Most people have heard it before, and I’ve had a lot of women come up to me 
and say I’ve heard that before, and I’ve heard a lot worse,” Trump said. “If 
that’s what it takes to lose an election, I think that’d be pretty sad.”

O’Reilly said that his popularity among women has taken a hit, which Trump 
denied.

“I’m not sure I believe it - I’m not sure I believe it,” Trump said. “What 
women want is they want secure borders, they want safety, they want law and 
order, they want a police department that is allowed to so its job, they want 
justice for all,” before going on a tirade aboutHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> creating Isis, which he 
said “I’m sure she was very proud of.”

“To be honest with you, Bill, I get along with people.”

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> used the 
global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on 
Tuesday, enlisting the help of her husband’s former vice-president Al Gore to 
urge America’s voters not to risk sending a “climate change denier” to the 
White House.

In a joint address in Miami, Clinton and Gore repeatedly hammered the 
Republican nominee for his stance on climate change and his belief that global 
warming is ahoax initiated by the Chinese 
<https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en>.

“Climate change is real, it’s urgent, and America can take the lead in the 
world in addressing it,” Clinton said, promising investment in clean energy.

“We can transform our economy, we can rally the world to cut carbon pollutions 
and above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect the planet. Just 
remember what is at stake. My opponent is a guy who denies science, who denies 
climate change every day.”

Yet it was Gore, who lost the 2000 presidential election to George W Bush by 
less than 500 votes 
<http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/31/politics/bush-gore-2000-election-results-studies/>
 in Florida, who delivered the more powerful message about why the climate 
crisis is one of the most serious issues in this campaign, and why he believes 
Clinton is the only candidate who can help solve it.

Closing out his remarks by speaking directly to young voters, President Barack 
Obama urges them to turn out, despite the coarsening of the American political 
process during the 2016 campaign.

“There are a lot of things about our politics that can seem cheap, and 
trivial, and frustrating,” Obama says, “but here’s a chance to reject a 
divisive and mean-spirited politics that would just take us backwards. And 
there’s nothing cheap or trivial about that.”

“That’s real - that is true. And young people, you have a chance to do that, 
so don’t fall for the easy cynicism that says my vote doesn’t matter, or all 
politicians are the same,” Obama continues. “I promise you - your vote matters!”

“If you care about equality, if you supported Bernie in the primaries, you’ve 
got a choice!” Obama says. “When he asks you what you have to lose, you answer 
- you’ve got everything to lose!”

“Send a message for hope! Send a message by voting for Hillary Clinton!” Obama 
closes. “Send a message about who we are as the American people, and make our 
kids proud!”

“Let’s get to work!”

 * Donald Trump railed against his fellow Republicans on Twitter on Tuesday 
morning, after a week in whichmany in the party have deserted him

 following the release of a tape of himboasting about groping women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women>
. 
 * The move came as prominent Republicans Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both 
reaffirmed that they were standing by the nominee. Trump described his party – 
which he first joined in 1987 before several years as a Democrat and an 
independent – as disloyal and unable to win, while labeling the House speaker, 
Paul Ryan, the most senior Republican in Congress, “very weak and ineffective”. 
Ryan has been a vocal critic of Trump’s and this week announced he would no 
longer defend Trump or campaign with him, although hestopped short of formally 
unendorsing him

.

 * Barack Obama assailed Republican nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> on Tuesday over remarks about 
groping women, also criticizing Republicans who continued to support the 
candidate. “You don’t have to be a husband or a father to hear what we heard 
just a few days ago and say that’s not right,” the president said in 
Greensboro, North Carolina, in his first public remarks since the release of a
2005 tape showing Trump bragging about groping and kissing women without their 
consent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video>
. “You just have to be a decent human being to say that’s not right.”

 * Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> used 
the global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on 
Tuesday, enlisting the help of her husband’s former vice-president Al Gore to 
urge America’s voters not to risk sending a “climate change denier” to the 
White House. In a joint address in Miami, Clinton and Gore repeatedly hammered 
the Republican nominee for his stance on climate change and his belief that 
global warming is ahoax initiated by the Chinese 
<https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en>. 
“Climate change is real, it’s urgent, and America can take the lead in the 
world in addressing it,” Clinton said, promising investment in clean energy.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jaws>. In a conversation with Fox News host 
Megyn Kelly, former Arkansas governorMike Huckabee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/mike-huckabee-suspends-campaign-iowa-caucus>
 declared that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may be rough around 
the edges, but when the chips are down, he’s the person you can trust to save 
your life – not unlike Captain Quint in the film Jaws.

assaulting women: House speaker Paul Ryantold fellow Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans>
 that he would no longer defend the party’s nominee, while hordes of party 
members distanced themselves from Trump’s comments with some – including 
Senator John McCain – even saying they could no longer vote for Trump. 
Supposedly, things could get even worse for the Republican nominee.

Hillary Clinton’s campaign fired back on Tuesday as Wikileaks released a new 
tranche of hacked emails from the account of its chairman John Podesta, dubbing 
the website a “propaganda arm of the Russian government” seeking to help elect 
Republican nomineeDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>
.

The latest batch of more than 2,000 emails, disclosed on Monday, offered a 
glimpse into the inner workings of the Clinton campaign. They included insights 
on multiple fronts, such as a lack of preparedness for Bernie Sanders’ 
insurgent campaign, concerns raised by Chelsea Clinton over potential conflicts 
of interest for the family’s foundation, and efforts by aides on how to best 
frame the former secretary of state’s second bid for the White House.

Last week, Wikileaks published other hacked emails from Podesta’s account, 
which includedalleged excerpts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-paid-wall-street-speeches>
 of Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street. Clinton’s campaign has neither 
confirmed nor denied authenticity of the emails, but in recent days escalated 
its charge that the hack was conducted by Russian state actors.


Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton’s campaign, fired off a tweet storm late 
Monday in which he assailed Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, for 
working on behalf of the Russian government.

“You are no media organization,” Fallon tweeted at Wikileaks. “You are a 
propaganda arm of the Russian government, running interference for their pet 
candidate, Trump.”

“That would be bad and I’d consider it.”
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, making his 
first appearance in a one-on-one interview since the release of video 
recordings that showed him bragging about sexually assaulting women and since 
the second presidential debate, petulantly told Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly that “I 
get along with everybody” that that House speaker Paul Ryan had committed a 
craven act of political betrayal by refusing to defend him.

“We’ve been having a problem - we have millions and millions of followers,” 
Trump said, “and Paul Ryan, open borders and amnesty and bad budgets by the 
way, very, very bad budgets... The shackles are some of the establishment 
people the weak and ineffective people within the party.”


“They’re not giving support - they don’t give the kind of support,” Trump 
said, when O’Reilly asked why he was so angry with Republican leadership. “They 
don’t give the support that we really need. Maybe we’ll do better without their 
support.”

When O’Reilly asked if Trump’s “throwing off of the shackles” of cooperating 
with Republicans meant that he would become more outspoken, Trump denied that 
he was outspoken at all.

“I don’t think I’m that outspoken to be honest with you - I think I’ve been 
very nice,” Trump said. “I don’t think so - look, I went to Ivy League schools.”

“I’m just tired of nonsupport - and I don’t really want support.”


Asked how he would address his cratering support among women after release of 
video in which he grabbed about being able to “grab [women] by the pussy” 
without consequence because of his fame, Trump dismissed the remarks as “locker 
room talk.”

“Most people have heard it before, and I’ve had a lot of women come up to me 
and say I’ve heard that before, and I’ve heard a lot worse,” Trump said. “If 
that’s what it takes to lose an election, I think that’d be pretty sad.”

O’Reilly said that his popularity among women has taken a hit, which Trump 
denied.

“I’m not sure I believe it - I’m not sure I believe it,” Trump said. “What 
women want is they want secure borders, they want safety, they want law and 
order, they want a police department that is allowed to so its job, they want 
justice for all,” before going on a tirade aboutHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> creating Isis, which he 
said “I’m sure she was very proud of.”

“To be honest with you, Bill, I get along with people.”
 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> used the 
global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on 
Tuesday, enlisting the help of her husband’s former vice-president Al Gore to 
urge America’s voters not to risk sending a “climate change denier” to the 
White House.

“Climate change is real, it’s urgent, and America can take the lead in the 
world in addressing it,” Clinton said, promising investment in clean energy.

“We can transform our economy, we can rally the world to cut carbon pollutions 
and above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect the planet. Just 
remember what is at stake. My opponent is a guy who denies science, who denies 
climate change every day.”

Yet it was Gore, who lost the 2000 presidential election to George W Bush by 
less than 500 votes 
<http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/31/politics/bush-gore-2000-election-results-studies/>
 in Florida, who delivered the more powerful message about why the climate 
crisis is one of the most serious issues in this campaign, and why he believes 
Clinton is the only candidate who can help solve it.

President Barack Obama, on the stakes of the 2016 election:

Civility is on the ballot! Respect for women is on the ballot! Tolerance is on 
the ballot!Justice is on the ballot! Equality is on the ballot! Democracy is on 
the ballot! If you want to send a message in this election, make it a 
resounding message!
 
Closing out his remarks by speaking directly to young voters, President Barack 
Obama urges them to turn out, despite the coarsening of the American political 
process during the 2016 campaign.

“There are a lot of things about our politics that can seem cheap, and 
trivial, and frustrating,” Obama says, “but here’s a chance to reject a 
divisive and mean-spirited politics that would just take us backwards. And 
there’s nothing cheap or trivial about that.”

“That’s real - that is true. And young people, you have a chance to do that, 
so don’t fall for the easy cynicism that says my vote doesn’t matter, or all 
politicians are the same,” Obama continues. “I promise you - your vote matters!”

“If you care about equality, if you supported Bernie in the primaries, you’ve 
got a choice!” Obama says. “When he asks you what you have to lose, you answer 
- you’ve got everything to lose!”

“Send a message for hope! Send a message by voting for Hillary Clinton!” Obama 
closes. “Send a message about who we are as the American people, and make our 
kids proud!”

“Let’s get to work!”
