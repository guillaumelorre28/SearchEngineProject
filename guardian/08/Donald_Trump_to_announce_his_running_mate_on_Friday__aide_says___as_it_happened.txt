 * Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is suing 
former top aide Sam Nunberg for $10m in back and forth litigation, only days 
before the presumptive GOP nominee will announce his running mate. Nunberg, who
left the campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/02/donald-trump-staffer-fired-sam-nunberg-facebook-posts>
 in August 2015 amid internal conflict, was sued by Trump in arbitration 
proceedings on 28 May over claims that he breached confidentiality. 
 * The Trump campaign is alleging that his client leaked a New York Post story 
<http://pagesix.com/2016/05/19/trump-campaign-staffers-get-into-public-screaming-match/>
 about a public spat between the then campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and 
press secretary Hope Hicks. The two reportedly engaged in a public argument on 
a weekday night in midtown Manhattan, with Hicks screaming: “I’m done with 
you!” The affidavit includes a denial by Nunberg that he provided the New York 
Post with a story about what he described as a “lovers’ quarrel” and describes 
Lewandowski and Hicks engaging in “a sordid and apparently illicit affair”. 
 * Hillary Clinton gave a speech on racial tensions in the US on Wednesday in 
Springfield, Illinois, and told the crowd that Donald Trump threatened American 
democracy. Clinton: Trump campaign a ‘threat to democracy’

 * Evangelical voters, long a key conservative voting bloc 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/21/evangelical-vote-us-elections>
, are rallying behind Donald Trump, according to a survey that found 78% of 
rank-and-file white evangelicals say they plan on voting for the presumptive 
Republican presidential nominee. The survey, conducted by Pew Research Center 
from 15-25 June, found that support for Trump among white evangelicals tops 
even that of 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, including more than one-third 
of the demographic that says they “strongly” support his candidacy.

 * Although that may be put to the test during the convention: The Republican 
party could be poised for a fractious proxy battle overLGBTI rights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/lgbt-rights> after activists on the party 
platform committee announced they had sufficient support to potentially force a 
vote on the convention floor. Republican supporters of more gay-friendly 
policies would use a “minority report” to the GOP platform to try to strip all 
references to LGBTI issues from the party manifesto. It would be replaced with 
a scaled-back, 1,200-word statement of conservative principles. Facebook

Black Republican senator Tim Scott talked openly on Wednesday about “the 
humiliation” of being pulled over by police officers seven times in one year, 
as well as his experiences being subject to extra scrutiny in Washington as an 
African American lawmaker.

Scott, from South Carolina, who is one of just two US senators who are black, 
gave an impassioned floor speech in thewake of last week’s fatal police 
shootings of two black men

.

“While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have however felt the 
pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted,” Scott said. 
“I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that 
comes with feeling like you’re being targeted for nothing more than being just 
yourself.”

“Was I speeding sometimes? Sure,” he added of the times he was stopped by 
police.
“But the vast majority of the time, I was pulled over for nothing more than 
driving a new car in the wrong neighborhood or some other reason just as 
trivial.”

In one instance, Scott said, an officer suggested the car he was driving might 
be stolen. In another, Scott said he was trailed by police across several 
traffic lights only to be pulled over and told he had forgotten to use his turn 
signal on the fourth turn he took.

“I do not know many African American men who do not have a very similar story 
to tell – no matter their profession, no matter their income, no matter their 
disposition in life,” Scott said.

Donald Trump’s chief counsel, Alan Garten, has released a statement regarding 
the candidate’s

As is standard practice for all major businesses, organizations and other 
entities dealing with proprietary information, Mr. Trump requires employees to 
sign and adhere to strict confidentiality agreements. When the agreements are 
not adhered to he will enforce them to the full extent of the law, and Mr. 
Trump’s litigation track record on such matters is outstanding. With regard to 
Mr. Nunberg, this agreement specifically calls for arbitration, and Mr. Nunberg 
is simply looking for free publicity using categorically false claims.

Trump is suing former top aide Sam Nunberg for $10m in arbitration proceedings 
over claims that he breached confidentiality.

The Republican operative, who after leaving Trump’s campaign announced he 
would support Ted Cruz, countersued this morning in New York county supreme 
court, alleging that Trump was trying to silence him as part of a vendetta and 
trying to force proceedings into arbitration to shield “the ridiculous nature 
of the Trump campaign’s irrational and vindictive assault against me”.

In an affidavit obtained by the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/jul/13/donald-trump-samuel-nunberg-affidavit>
, Nunberg alleges the suit “is retaliation for my change of political opinion 
and the free exercise of my first amendment right to abandon my political 
backing of Mr Trump and to endorse and associate with US senator Ted Cruz 
publicly”.

President Barack Obama told reporters this afternoon that “deep divisions” 
along racial lines in the US are making reconciliation between African American 
communities and police increasingly difficult.

“Not only are there very real problems, but there are still deep divisions 
about how to solve these problems,” Obama told reporters at the White House 
after a nearly four-hour meeting with nearly 40 leaders from both black and law 
enforcement communities. “There is no doubt that police departments still feel 
embattled and unjustly accused. And there is no doubt that minority 
communities, communities of color, still feel like it just takes too long to do 
what’s right.”

“There’s still a diversity of views around this table, and that’s by design,” 
Obama continued. “Not everybody agrees on everything.”

The president committed to the roundtable after the assassination of four law 
enforcement officers in Dallas, which followed several high-profile shooting 
deaths of African American men at the hands of police.

We have more on Donald Trump’s apparent plan to announce his running mate this 
coming Friday at an event in New York.

Campaign chair Paul Manafort told reporters in Cleveland that Trump is 
planning to announce his vice presidential choice at an event at Trump Tower in 
New York, stoking the fires of veep-mania that has gripped followers of his 
presidential campaign.

Trump and his senior campaign staff - by which we mean his three eldest 
children - have all met with the presumptive frontrunners for the position in 
recent days, including New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Indiana governorMike 
Pence <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence> and former House speaker 
Newt Gingrich.

“She’s a disgrace to the supreme court,” Trump said. “For her to politicize 
the supreme court, and this is all the more reason why I hope I win. Because 
I’ve got 11 justices that are absolutely incredible justices. Highly respected 
by all, including liberal people frankly. For her to come out and to say the 
kind of things - there’s almost something wrong with her. I don’t think anybody 
has ever seen that before.”

When asked whether he was questioning Ginsburg’s mental state, Trump agreed.

“Yeah, I think I am. I think I am questioning, perhaps, her mental capacity,” 
Trump continued. “For her to do that was either a very dumb mistake - and she’s 
been criticized by people who that would always be on her side ... But 
honestly, for her, for her to have done was an absolute disgrace to the supreme 
court. And she owes the country, our country an apology. And she owes the 
supreme court of the United States an apology. It was disgusting.”

The New York Observer will reportedly no longer publish open letters 
<http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/07/new-york-observer-bans-open-letters-about-trump-campaign-225503>
 about Donald Trump or his candidacy, according to Politico, after the paper’s 
publication of a highly critical open letter from a staff writer put its owner 
in the hot seat.

Columnist and editor-at-large Ryan Holiday published an open letter to his 
father, encouraging him not to vote for Trump,on Medium 
<https://medium.com/extra-extra/dear-dad-please-dont-vote-for-donald-trump-907dfdc74229#.3ahtrimhr>
, but noted in the letter’s introduction that he had originally hoped to 
publish it in the Observer.

“I originally submitted this piece to the New York Observer where I am an 
editor-at-large and a columnist on media and culture,” Holiday wrote in the 
piece’s introduction. “Editorial decided it would no longer accept columns of 
this nature on this topic. I have the utmost respect for the leadership at the 
Observer, but I respectfully disagree with that decision.”

Entertainment writer Dana Schwartz’s “An Open Letter to Jared Kushner, From 
One of Your Jewish Employees 
<http://observer.com/2016/07/an-open-letter-to-jared-kushner-from-one-of-your-jewish-employees/>
” called on Observer owner Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, to explain his 
support of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee after numerous 
instances in which he was seen as courting the support of white supremacists 
and antisemites.

In an interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier this afternoon, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> declared that he’s “not 
looking for an attack dog” in his search for a running mate. “Frankly, I’m 
looking for somebody that really understands what we’re talking about. Because 
I would rather have the whole thing be on policy, and I’ve said that before. 
People think of me as an attackert, but I would rather be talking about policy.”

Granted, Trump said the literal opposite

 * Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is suing 
former top aide Sam Nunberg for $10m in back and forth litigation, only days 
before the presumptive GOP nominee will announce his running mate. Nunberg, who
left the campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/02/donald-trump-staffer-fired-sam-nunberg-facebook-posts>
 in August 2015 amid internal conflict, was sued by Trump in arbitration 
proceedings on 28 May over claims that he breached confidentiality. 
 * The Trump campaign is alleging that his client leaked a New York Post story 
<http://pagesix.com/2016/05/19/trump-campaign-staffers-get-into-public-screaming-match/>
 about a public spat between the then campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and 
press secretary Hope Hicks. The two reportedly engaged in a public argument on 
a weekday night in midtown Manhattan, with Hicks screaming: “I’m done with 
you!” The affidavit includes a denial by Nunberg that he provided the New York 
Post with a story about what he described as a “lovers’ quarrel” and describes 
Lewandowski and Hicks engaging in “a sordid and apparently illicit affair”.

 * Evangelical voters, long a key conservative voting bloc 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/21/evangelical-vote-us-elections>
, are rallying behind Donald Trump, according to a survey that found 78% of 
rank-and-file white evangelicals say they plan on voting for the presumptive 
Republican presidential nominee. The survey, conducted by Pew Research Center 
from 15-25 June, found that support for Trump among white evangelicals tops 
even that of 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, including more than one-third 
of the demographic that says they “strongly” support his candidacy.

 * Although that may be put to the test during the convention: The Republican 
party could be poised for a fractious proxy battle overLGBTI rights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/lgbt-rights> after activists on the party 
platform committee announced they had sufficient support to potentially force a 
vote on the convention floor. Republican supporters of more gay-friendly 
policies would use a “minority report” to the GOP platform to try to strip all 
references to LGBTI issues from the party manifesto. It would be replaced with 
a scaled-back, 1,200-word statement of conservative principles.  
Black Republican senator Tim Scott talked openly on Wednesday about “the 
humiliation” of being pulled over by police officers seven times in one year, 
as well as his experiences being subject to extra scrutiny in Washington as an 
African American lawmaker.

“While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have however felt the 
pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted,” Scott said. 
“I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that 
comes with feeling like you’re being targeted for nothing more than being just 
yourself.”

“Was I speeding sometimes? Sure,” he added of the times he was stopped by 
police.
“But the vast majority of the time, I was pulled over for nothing more than 
driving a new car in the wrong neighborhood or some other reason just as 
trivial.”

In one instance, Scott said, an officer suggested the car he was driving might 
be stolen. In another, Scott said he was trailed by police across several 
traffic lights only to be pulled over and told he had forgotten to use his turn 
signal on the fourth turn he took.

“I do not know many African American men who do not have a very similar story 
to tell – no matter their profession, no matter their income, no matter their 
disposition in life,” Scott said.

Donald Trump’s chief counsel, Alan Garten, has released a statement regarding 
the candidate’s

As is standard practice for all major businesses, organizations and other 
entities dealing with proprietary information, Mr. Trump requires employees to 
sign and adhere to strict confidentiality agreements. When the agreements are 
not adhered to he will enforce them to the full extent of the law, and Mr. 
Trump’s litigation track record on such matters is outstanding. With regard to 
Mr. Nunberg, this agreement specifically calls for arbitration, and Mr. Nunberg 
is simply looking for free publicity using categorically false claims.

Trump is suing former top aide Sam Nunberg for $10m in arbitration proceedings 
over claims that he breached confidentiality.

The Republican operative, who after leaving Trump’s campaign announced he 
would support Ted Cruz, countersued this morning in New York county supreme 
court, alleging that Trump was trying to silence him as part of a vendetta and 
trying to force proceedings into arbitration to shield “the ridiculous nature 
of the Trump campaign’s irrational and vindictive assault against me”.

In an affidavit obtained by the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/jul/13/donald-trump-samuel-nunberg-affidavit>
, Nunberg alleges the suit “is retaliation for my change of political opinion 
and the free exercise of my first amendment right to abandon my political 
backing of Mr Trump and to endorse and associate with US senator Ted Cruz 
publicly”.
 
President Barack Obama told reporters this afternoon that “deep divisions” 
along racial lines in the US are making reconciliation between African American 
communities and police increasingly difficult.

“Not only are there very real problems, but there are still deep divisions 
about how to solve these problems,” Obama told reporters at the White House 
after a nearly four-hour meeting with nearly 40 leaders from both black and law 
enforcement communities. “There is no doubt that police departments still feel 
embattled and unjustly accused. And there is no doubt that minority 
communities, communities of color, still feel like it just takes too long to do 
what’s right.”

“There’s still a diversity of views around this table, and that’s by design,” 
Obama continued. “Not everybody agrees on everything.”

The president committed to the roundtable after the assassination of four law 
enforcement officers in Dallas, which followed several high-profile shooting 
deaths of African American men at the hands of police.
 
We have more on Donald Trump’s apparent plan to announce his running mate this 
coming Friday at an event in New York.

Campaign chair Paul Manafort told reporters in Cleveland that Trump is 
planning to announce his vice presidential choice at an event at Trump Tower in 
New York, stoking the fires of veep-mania that has gripped followers of his 
presidential campaign.

Trump and his senior campaign staff - by which we mean his three eldest 
children - have all met with the presumptive frontrunners for the position in 
recent days, including New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Indiana governorMike 
Pence <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence> and former House speaker 
Newt Gingrich.
 
In an interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier this afternoon, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> questioned the “mental 
capacity” of sitting supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, after the 
justice repeatedly criticized Trump as a “faker.”

“She’s a disgrace to the supreme court,” Trump said. “For her to politicize 
the supreme court, and this is all the more reason why I hope I win. Because 
I’ve got 11 justices that are absolutely incredible justices. Highly respected 
by all, including liberal people frankly. For her to come out and to say the 
kind of things - there’s almost something wrong with her. I don’t think anybody 
has ever seen that before.”

When asked whether he was questioning Ginsburg’s mental state, Trump agreed.

“Yeah, I think I am. I think I am questioning, perhaps, her mental capacity,” 
Trump continued. “For her to do that was either a very dumb mistake - and she’s 
been criticized by people who that would always be on her side ... But 
honestly, for her, for her to have done was an absolute disgrace to the supreme 
court. And she owes the country, our country an apology. And she owes the 
supreme court of the United States an apology. It was disgusting.”
 
The New York Observer will reportedly no longer publish open letters 
<http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/07/new-york-observer-bans-open-letters-about-trump-campaign-225503>
 about Donald Trump or his candidacy, according to Politico, after the paper’s 
publication of a highly critical open letter from a staff writer put its owner 
in the hot seat.

Columnist and editor-at-large Ryan Holiday published an open letter to his 
father, encouraging him not to vote for Trump,on Medium 
<https://medium.com/extra-extra/dear-dad-please-dont-vote-for-donald-trump-907dfdc74229#.3ahtrimhr>
, but noted in the letter’s introduction that he had originally hoped to 
publish it in the Observer.

“I originally submitted this piece to the New York Observer where I am an 
editor-at-large and a columnist on media and culture,” Holiday wrote in the 
piece’s introduction. “Editorial decided it would no longer accept columns of 
this nature on this topic. I have the utmost respect for the leadership at the 
Observer, but I respectfully disagree with that decision.”

Entertainment writer Dana Schwartz’s “An Open Letter to Jared Kushner, From 
One of Your Jewish Employees 
<http://observer.com/2016/07/an-open-letter-to-jared-kushner-from-one-of-your-jewish-employees/>
” called on Observer owner Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, to explain his 
support of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee after numerous 
instances in which he was seen as courting the support of white supremacists 
and antisemites.

In an interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier this afternoon, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> declared that he’s “not 
looking for an attack dog” in his search for a running mate. “Frankly, I’m 
looking for somebody that really understands what we’re talking about. Because 
I would rather have the whole thing be on policy, and I’ve said that before. 
People think of me as an attackert, but I would rather be talking about policy.”

Granted, Trump said the literal opposite

 in a conversation with the Wall Street Journal yesterday, so who knows.
