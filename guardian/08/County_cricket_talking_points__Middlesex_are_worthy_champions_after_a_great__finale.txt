Ball one: county cricket, bloody hell!

Thousands were inside Lord’s, basking in preposterous September heat; hundreds 
of thousands more were sitting at computer screens watching updates click over 
or listening to breathless commentary; 14 men stood in a field as a 15th ran in 
to bowl, seeking a third wicket in his last three deliveries. The flabby, 
outdated, soft County Championship had contrived the tightest, toughest, 
tingliest finish anyone could have hoped for when it lumbered into life in the 
chilly days of spring. It was the most elegant of rebukes to the naysayers; the 
most unanswerable of cases to return to a 16-match, all-play-all, two-divisions 
format as soon as possible; the greatest of games at its greatest. From the 
straw-chewing shepherds who invented this most satisfying waste of a sunny day 
to its noble (the word is not misplaced when one reads the reactions of the 
vanquished when their fates became known) principals today, those of us on the 
outside of the boundary rope offer our gratitude.

Ball two: Chris Rogers bows out gloriously, if not in glory

Somerset were the gooseberry at the Lord’s deathly embrace, a draw enough for 
the Taunton men to spend the next 12 months sipping cider from a Holy Grail 
that has eluded them through history. After James Hildreth had stood and 
delivered a century with a broken ankle and Chris Rogers had done what he does 
to deliver another, spin twins Jack Leach and Dom Bess rolled a desperate
Nottinghamshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nottinghamshire> for 138 and 
the result was never in doubt. There was time for a second and, as it turned 
out, valedictory ton from skipper Rogers (a magnificent servant to the game in 
England and Australia), before Leach and Roelof van der Merwe spun out Notts 
again and 23 points were delivered, the one missing after Somerset’s 
extraordinary Day One collapse crucial in keeping Yorkshire in the race for the 
pennant, 200 miles to the east. Their work concluded with a day to spare, 
Somerset team gathered at their empty ground on Friday, to be joined by fans, 
to share the hopes and fears provoked by the television coverage of the 
exquisite agony of Day Four at Lord’s.

Ball three: James Franklin declares as the pennant travels south

The match at HQ was one for the ages, demonstrating everything, and I mean 
everything, that is good about the game. Nick Gubbins, in the season of his 
life, dug in against a Yorkshire attack potent enough to leave out Liam 
Plunkett, and made 125 when no team-mate could cross 50, getting his team up to 
a competitive 270. That knock’s value was made immediately obvious as Alex 
Lees, Gary Ballance and Andrew Gale failed to register a run between them and 
Tim Bresnan found himself at the crease with Andy Hodd, only playing because a 
keen as mustard Jonny Bairstow was instructed to rest by the ECB. Bresnan 
played the innings of his life, a seven and a half hours 142* with support from 
his wicket-keeper and his all-rounder Azeem Rafiq, securing the vital fifth 
bonus point in the company of No11, Ryan Sidebottom. But Gubbins got a start 
again and found a partner in Dawid Malan, as their runs got Middlesex into a 
position from which James Franklin could negotiate a target with Andrew Gale. 
An hour’s unedifying thrash (best forgotten) set up a final afternoon chase of 
240 in 40 overs, and set Twitter alight with ill-judged comments about how 
Yorkshire would bat comfortably to a victory and the title after Franklin’s 
“foolishness”. The equation looked about right in a match that both teams had 
to keep pushing for the win – and Franklin had extracted a commitment that 
Yorkshire would do exactly that, a promise kept. Toby Roland-Jones, a long-time 
favourite of this column, proved the hero, his hat-trick prompting delirium in 
London and despondency in Taunton. Middlesex went unbeaten over the season and 
had managed to flog a second win out of the flattest pitch in the country in a 
matter of weeks – they are worthy winners.

Ball four: Bears maul sorry Lancashire

While the White Rose was fighting to win Division One, the Red Rose was 
fighting to stay in it, matched up with fellow trapdoor candidates, 
Warwickshire. After Jordan Clark and Tom Bailey had dismissed a home XI in 
which seven batsmen made 16 or more, but none topped Sam Hain’s 52, Steven 
Croft’s decision to exercise his right to bowl first looked a good one. But, 
with Haseeb Hameed’s season-long heroics finally catching up with the 
Bangladesh bound teenager, Lancashire’s batting was no match for Ian Bell’s 
experienced and potent attack, the visitors subsiding to 152 all out. Chasing 
an unlikely 347 in the fourth innings to win,Lancashire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> lasted just 61 overs for a 
pitiful 109 all out to ensure Division One cricket will be played at Edgbaston 
in 2017. Whether the same could be said for Old Trafford depended on events 
just outside Southampton.

Ball five: Hampshire deflated at the Rose Bowl

Recalling Duncan Spencer, the cricketer who lived fast and bowled even faster

After an international season that started with great hopes and finished in 
disappointment, Hampshire skipper, James Vince, made 92 to lift his team to the 
relative comfort of 411 in the first dig. The visitors needed a gutsy 99 not 
out from wicketkeeper, Michael Richardson, to keep the deficit to 50, but Ryan 
Pringle’s offies and Scott Borthwick’s leggies proved too much for Hampshire’s 
strokemakers who never got going second time round and, needing a win, Vince 
could set a target of just 296 in 78 overs against a team who knew they could 
shut up shop if required. On a tricky pitch, Mark Stoneman made 137 and 
Borthwick 88 to bequeath 22 points to Paul Collingwood, a nice leaving present 
as they set off for The Oval.Hampshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> will play in the expanded, 
lopsided Division Two in 2017, ten points their gap to seventh placed 
Lancashire whose collapsing form suggests that big changes are required in the 
winter.
