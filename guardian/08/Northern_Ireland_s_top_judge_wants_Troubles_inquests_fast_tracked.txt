Northern Ireland’s most senior judge has demanded the creation of a special 
unit to deal with a backlog of inquests into some of the most controversial 
killings of the Troubles.

Sir Declan Morgan, the region’s lord chief justice, said the power-sharing 
executive at Stormont should fund the new unit.

No inquests have yet been held into dozens of killings, including the 
shootings of republican terror suspects and civilians by the police and British 
army. There are also cases in which allegations have been made of collusion by 
security forces in loyalist murders, and of British agents operating within the 
republican movement.

Speaking at the start of the new legal term in Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland>, Morgan described the slow 
pace of inquests into these deaths as “hugely disappointing” and said a 
dedicated unit operating over five years was needed to cope with the backlog.

“I therefore call again on the local executive and legislature, and on the UK 
government, to play their part as a matter of urgency. We cannot move on while 
we remain under the shadow of the past. Nor should we. But time is not on our 
side,” he said.

Morgan said if the inquests could not be scheduled within five years then it 
could be decades before they were held.

“It is impossible to see how the issue of legacy can be moved forward 
politically without progress having been made on the new legislation and in the 
absence of a clear assessment of the costs involved in implementing all of the 
elements of a legacy package,” he said.

Victims organisations say there are 57 legacy inquests that need to be held, 
relating to about 100 killings during the Northern Ireland Troubles.
