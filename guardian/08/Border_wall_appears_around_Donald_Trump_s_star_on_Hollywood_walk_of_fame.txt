A border wall appeared around the Trump star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 
Tuesday.


The work was credited to the artist Plastic Jesus. Who paid for it? Your guess 
is as good as ours.

Tourists stopped on Tuesday to snap photos of the six-inch gray wall, topped 
with razor wire and plastered with “keep out” signs. The tiny wall was gone by 
Wednesday morning.


Plastic Jesus is known for posting “No Trump Anytime” signs on street corners 
earlier this year. His website says his art is influenced by news and culture.
