One hundred years ago on 30 December 1916, Grigori Rasputin, the Russian 
mystic who became a confidant of Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, was brutally 
killed. Aftersupposedly  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/15/world.news>being poisoned, shot 
and beaten, he was thrown into the freezing waters of St. Petersburg’s Neva 
River by aristocrats fearful of the influence he wielded over the Romanov court.


The death of the ‘notoriously evil’ monk was reported 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/jan/03/rasputin-killed-russia-1917-archive>
 in the Manchester Guardian on 3 January 1917, while the following day, amidst 
all the news about the war in Europe, it was noted that Russia could nowbreathe 
more freely <https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/12/22/4_Jan_1917.jpg>. 

As more details about the death emerged, the Observer published a detailed 
profile,Grishka Rasuputin: The career of a sanctimonious adventurer 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/12/22/Rasputin_7_jan_17.jpg>, by historian 
Zinovy N. Preev. Mystic or charlatan, he concluded that the Siberian peasant 
was ‘a maker and breaker of cabinet ministers, governor-generals, bishops, and 
other high officers of state and church’.

 Manchester Guardian, 3 January 1917. 
Over the following decades some of the assassins would describe their role in 
Rasputin’s demise. In 1923, the diary ofVladimir Purishkevich 
<http://spartacus-educational.com/RUSpurishkevich.htm> was published with an 
excerpt, ‘How I killed Rasputin 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/12/22/23_Oct_1923.jpg>,’ appearing in the 
Guardian. A few years later, Prince Felix Yusupof described hisrole in the 
affair <https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/12/22/Prince_Y_1_March_1934.jpg> while 
giving evidence during a libel trial. By 1966 he was living in Paris and in a 
(very short)interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/dec/29/archive-rasputin-killer-yussupoff-1966>
 with Guardian writer Peter Lennon, he said he would, if necessary, kill 
Rasputin again.
 Manchester Guardian, 23 October 1923. 
Rasputin first appeared on the pages of the Guardian in 1913. A feature about 
him <https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/12/22/24_January_1914.jpg> from January 
1914 included the fact that ‘Gregory the rake,’ a translation of Rasputin, was 
the nickname given to him on account of his personal habits. It also noted the 
power this ‘crude imposter’ had over ‘fashionable women’.

 Manchester Guardian, 17 May 1914. 
A century after Rasputin’s death, numerous writers have attempted to 
disentangle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/12/rasputin-short-life-review> the 
myths from facts, as well putting forward new theories as to what exactly 
happened in the early hours of 30 January 1916. For example, in 2004 it was 
suggested that MI6 officerOswald Rayner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/21/mi6-first-authorised-history> 
fired the fatal shot that killed Rasputin. The recentbiography 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/06/rasputin-douglas-smith-review-myth-murder-russia-mad-monk-biography-romanovs>
 by Douglas Smith presents a less sensational portrait of the ‘mad monk’.
