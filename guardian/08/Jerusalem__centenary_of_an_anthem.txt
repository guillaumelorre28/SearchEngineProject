One hundred years ago, Hubert Parry 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/e58a0544-2b32-47b2-955c-fa51887ec6c7> wrote 
the music for Jerusalem. On 10 March 1916, the Edwardian composer set words 
originally penned byWilliam Blake <http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/241908> 
to a tune, beginning with the line ‘And did those feet in ancient time.’

Just over two weeks later, the song was performed for the first time by a 
choir of 300 at a Fight for Right meeting at the Queen’s Hall on 28 March 1916.

 Manchester Guardian, 24 March 1916. 
The Fight for Right movement was formed by Sir Francis Younghusband 
<http://rsgs.org/inspiring-people/stories/younghusband/> in 1915 to reinforce 
British resolve during the first world war. It was supported by many well known 
writers and public figures, and music was considered an important part of the 
movement’s meetings. This led toRobert Bridges 
<http://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Bridges>, the poet laureate, asking 
Parry to write ‘music that an audience could take up and join in.’

Jerusalem soon became popular and was adopted by the Women’s Institute as 
their anthem in 1924. The centenary of William Blake’s death in 1927 also saw 
calls for the song to become an English national anthem 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/03/09/11_April_1927.jpg>, something that 
continues to this day. It has long beensung at sporting events 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/shortcuts/2012/jul/16/pass-notes-3211-jerusalem>
, in the 1950s became part of the Last Night of the Proms, and is the hymn of 
the Labour Party.

However, while Hubert Parry is famous for just this single work, he composed 
hugely influential chorales and symphonies.
