Seek out the Saxons

Sutton Hoo <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sutton-hoo/> is a magnet for 
families looking for an improving day out. Any child with a sense of history 
will be mesmerised by the Anglo-Saxon burial ship in the museum, with its 
spears and shield and its opulent Byzantine bowls and spoons. More beguiling 
yet is the ceremonial helmet thought to have belonged to King Raedwald of the 
East Angles, its empty eyesockets gaze at you across 1,500 years of English 
history.
Open daily 10.30am-5pm. A family ticket costs £20.60 

Where bombers flew

More recent history can be found at Parham Airfield Museum 
<http://www.parhamairfieldmuseum.co.uk/>, which evokes the time in the second 
world war when this was a base for the US 390th Bomb Group. An exhibition is 
devoted to the little-known auxiliary units, which would have formed the core 
of British resistance had Britain been invaded.
Open Sundays and bank holiday Mondays, 11am to 5pm, Wednesdays 11am to 4pm, 
admission free.

Go wild for birds

near Saxmundham, where the BBC's Springwatch has been filming this year. You 
may find bitterns making their basso profundo hoot, or you could see otters, 
dragonflies and adders. Go for a yomp on Dunwich Heath to spot warblers and red 
deer, while the Wilderness Reserve is alive with more deer, owls, and 
butterflies.
Open dawn till dusk. Entry to the visitor centre is free. Countryside walks 
and hides cost £8 for adults, £4 for kids, and one child goes free with two 
paying adults. Parking is £4.80 for non-National Trust members



Size up Southwold

Southwold  <http://www.visitsouthwold.co.uk/> has an amazing church, St 
Edmund, King and Martyr. Children are welcome to ring the bell held by the 
medieval figure of Jack-smite-the-clock while you inspect the damage wrought by 
the Suffolk-born iconoclast William "Basher" Dowsing during the civil war: he 
scrubbed the faces from all the finely painted apostles and saints on the rood 
screen. Afterwards you could climb the Southwold lighthouse (a sign saying "not 
suitable for people with vertigo" dissuaded us) or pay 90p for a ferryman to 
row you to Walberswick.

Tales of the Tudors

Most children will love exploring the atmospheric ruins of 12th century 
Framlingham Castle 
<http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/framlingham-castle/>, 
where Mary Tudor was proclaimed queen.
Open daily 10am-6pm. A family ticket costs £17.90

Tide turns for Woodbridge

Make time for Woodbridge, which is not on the coast, but is on the water. The 
tide mill <http://www.woodbridgetidemill.org.uk/> on the banks of the wide, 
slow-flowing river Deben, is well worth a visit. The mill, whose 
five-metre-high oak waterwheel harnessed the power of the tides to produce 
flour and animal feed for more than 800 years, has recently been restored to 
full working order.
Admission, £8 for a family ticket

Cafe society
 East Coast Diner, Woodbridge 
It is easy to get a family-pleasing bite to eat on the Thoroughfare in 
Woodbridge. Don't miss the hotdogs at theEast Coast Diner  
<http://www.eastcoastdiner.co.uk/> or Honey and Harvey, a "modern English 
coffeehouse" where refills – including babyccinos – come free. Everywhere in 
this part of Suffolk there are handsome delis where you can buy local pies, 
perfect sausage rolls, and other makings of a picnic. Try TheBlack Olive 
<http://www.theblackolivedelicatessen.co.uk/> in Southwold or Green Olive 
<http://greenolivewoodbridge.co.uk/> in Woodbridge, or Leo's Deli in 
Framlingham.

Catch a festival

A couple of great festivals take place in Suffolk over the summer. Latitude 
<http://www.latitudefestival.com/>, 17-20 July, in Henham Park near Southwold, 
is an outdoor event with lots of theatre, workshops, woodland craft, and 
performances aimed at kids.The Snape Proms 
<https://tickets.aldeburgh.co.uk/Online/>, at the end of the summer, has 
several gigs that would make a family outing, including a Mary Poppins 
singalong and a concert by the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain.

Grab a brew and some grub

Go to the Sweffling White Horse  <http://www.swefflingwhitehorse.co.uk/> on 
the B1119 between Framlingham and Saxmundham. It is a strange and unusual pub, 
one of few in the country with no bar – though it does serve substantial 
locally made pies that'll keep the kids quiet.
Open Thurs-Mon, from 7pm

Take a ride, then pitch up

Outside the White Horse you'll find a man with a pony-and-trap ready to take 
you on a ride through the quiet country lanes (£15). Nearby isAlde Garden 
<http://aldegarden.co.uk/>, a campsite with a range of accommodation: a low, 
wooden hideout (£75 for two nights), a bell tent (£125), a tipi (£165), and 
a yurt or two (£180). You can also pitch your own tent for £14 a night.
