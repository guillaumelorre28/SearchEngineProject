Mike Pence <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence>, the Republican 
vice-presidential nominee, has emerged unscathed after his plane skidded off 
the runway while landing at LaGuardia airport in New York in heavy rain.

The Boeing 737 carrying Donald Trump’s running mate coming in for a landing 
and went off the runway at about 7:40pm local time (23.40 GMT). The plane was 
stopped by a crushable type of concrete runway that halted the aircraft’s 
movement, the Federal Aviation Administration said. It finally came a 
standstill on an area of grass.

daughter Charlotte, were injured. Flights out of LaGuardia were halted for at

Elizabeth Landers, a CNN producer, was on the plane and described the landing.


“When we landed here we had a pretty hard landing and then we felt the back of 
the plane start to fishtail and you could just feel the plane moving in a way 
that was not straight on the runway like a normal landing would go,” she said.

“The plane continued to proceed down ... then we came to a very, very sort of 
quick and harsh halt on the runway.

Governor Pence came to the back of the plane to make sure everyone was all 
right.

“There is significant damage to the runway. You can see divots where the 
wheels of the plane had been.

“Everyone is fine but definitely a little rattled.


“Judging by what I am seeing it looks like cement has been torn up by the 
wheels of the plane. The plane is off the runway. The plane is in the grass. 
One of the wheels is completely in the grass. In fact the entire plane is in

Trump called Pence to check on him after the incident, the campaign said. 

“Mr Trump did reach out to Gov Pence. He’s glad that everyone on board is 
safe,” a Trump spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said in an emailed statement.

Trump called him from his motorcade while en route to a rally in Geneva, Ohio. 

Earlier in the day photographs published by Reuters showed Trump’s plane 
taxiing on the runway at LaGuardia during heavy rain.
