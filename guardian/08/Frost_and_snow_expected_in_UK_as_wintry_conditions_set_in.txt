winds at Beechbrook Farm near Ashford, Kent, at about 6am on Monday.

The train was not damaged and there were no reported injuries but the line was

cleared debris, Network Rail said.

 in parts of the country.

Emma Sharples, a forecaster for the Met Office, said Britain would wake up to 
frost on Tuesday whileScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> in 
particular would see the first “fairly significant snow” of winter.

“A lot of places will go below freezing, even towns and cities will probably 
be just about hovering between 0C and 1C,” she said.

Going into Wednesday, parts of the north-east and Yorkshire may also see snow 
as a band of rain collides with the cold air, she said.

But the freezing weather is not expected to last, with wet and windy weather 
forecast for Friday and Saturday and temperatures between 10C and 14C.

“We will see a slight change as we go towards the end of the week,” said 
Sharples. “Less cold than it is at the moment, but probably still a little bit 
below average for the time of the year.”
