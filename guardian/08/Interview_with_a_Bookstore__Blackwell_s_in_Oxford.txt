When Benjamin Henry Blackwell opened the doors to Blackwell’s on 1 January 
1879, books were firmly in his blood. His father, Benjamin Harris Blackwell was 
a librarian and had been heavily involved in the Temperance Society. The 
society promoted self-education and encouraged reading as well as religion. 
Originally, after he had spent some years being apprenticed to a local 
bookseller, he had hopes of becoming a librarian like his father, but after 
being turned down for the post of city librarian for Cardiff, he decided to 
open a shop of his own.

What’s your favourite section of the store?

Rebecca MacAlister (Manager): The poetry corner. It is situated in a small 
nook on the first floor and has some of the original bookcases from when the 
shop opened in 1879. It also has the doorway to the “Gaffers Office” in it, 
which was the office of Basil Blackwell, kept in its original state. Basil 
Blackwell took over from his father and for over 60 years he oversaw the growth 
of a bookselling empire.

If you had infinite space what would you add?

Zool Verjee (Sales Development Manager): A bespoke “theatre-style” author 
events space which would mean we could run events without endless moving of 
tables, getting out of chairs, and then putting it all back together again at 
the end of the evening! However, we still manage to hold a yearly theatre 
production (for an eight-week run) every year down in the Norrington room.

What do you do better than any other bookstore?

David Kelly (Sales Manager): An outstanding range and knowledgeable 
booksellers with varied expertise. We have over 125,000 thousand titles in 
stock and Booksellers who have worked here from one day to 47 years! It’s also 
worth mentioning our unbelievable events programme: we hold over 300 events, 
which includes signings, talks, and readings every year.

Who’s your favorite regular?

Rebecca: The philosopher Nigel Warburton has to be one of the shop’s best 
customers. He is often here buying books for friends and family, can be seen 
here running our regular monthly Philosophy in a Bookshop event, and is just 
truly one of our shop’s best friends!

What’s the craziest situation you’ve ever had to deal with in the store?

Rebecca: Last year we had the President of the Dominican Republic drop into 
the shop with his wife and security team. As they were still shopping at the 
time we normally close, a few of us stayed on to continue to serve them. By 8 
pm we were popping out to get food and coffees for him as he was still 
shopping! He did end up spending quite a lot and he and his people were just 
really lovely!

What’s your earliest/best memory about visiting a bookstore as a child?

Nicky James (Customer Service Manager): As a second generation bookseller, 
tidying the Garfield books in my parents’ bookshop in Canberra, Australia at 
the tender age of five.

Zool: Knights Bookshop in Abingdon (doesn’t exist any more sadly) — there 
really was no greater treat than being able to choose a book to buy and taking 
it home in its orange paper bag!

If you weren’t running or working at a bookstore, what would you be doing?

Being Miserable or a hired assassin (the one question we all agreed on!).

What’s been the biggest surprise about running a bookstore?

Every day we are surprised by the wonderful new books and authors in the boxes 
we unpack. Working in a bookshop can be like opening presents on Christmas day!

 * The Opposite of Loneliness by Marina Keegan 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-opposite-of-loneliness.html> (2014). 
James (literature and languages department) recommends: “The Opposite of 
Loneliness is the opening essay of this posthumous collection of writing’s by 
late Yale graduate, Marina Keegan. After being killed in a car accident at the 
age of 22 and a couple of weeks after writing this inspiring essay, Marina’s 
family produced a collection of her works that are hopeful and which call for a 
better future for all of us. Beautifully written and utterly inspiring.” 
 * My Name is Asher Lev by Chaim Potok 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/my-name-is-asher-lev-2.html> (1972). Zool 
recommends: “This is probably the book of which I have bought the most copies 
in my life, as presents for friends. I challenge you to find a more 
heartrending and emotionally compelling book. This is about orthodoxy meeting 
the modern world and what happens when the two conflict.” 
 * To The Wedding by John Berger 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/to-the-wedding.html> (1995). Ray (bookseller) 
recommends: “This is a novel about the coming together of a far flung European 
family to a wedding. The bride to be is HIV positive.No! I hear you groan, too 
depressing. Relax, you’re in the hands of an author who not only has the eye of 
an artist, the heart of a poet and the soul of a angel warrior; Berger’s 
largesse of spirit inspires compassion and hope where you may see none. This 
beautiful, truly magical book is a paean for humanity. Berger is the only 
author I know of that evokes not just awe and respect for his work, but sincere 
love for the man himself.”
