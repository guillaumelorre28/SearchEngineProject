Summing up

In the scheme of things, India are on top, as they were at the close yesterday 
– particularly with Ashwin and Jadeja’s partnership lighting up the closing 
stages of the day for India. But given that most England followers would have 
anticipated waking up to the home side being 250-2 or some such, then Alastair 
Cook’s side deserve great credit for staying in the game, particularly with 
that stunning little passage of play just after tea when a rash shot, a fine 
run-out and a couple of excellent deliveries brought a clatter of vital 
wickets. All England need to do now is wrap up the innings and then bat out of 
their skins, for a very long time, against the best spin attack in the world on 
a pitch likely to turn more and more as the match goes on. What could possibly 
go wrong?

It’s fascinatingly poised nonetheless. Stay on the site for reports, reaction 
and comment, but in the meantime thanks for your company, emails and musings on 
bad cover versions. Bye.

Stumps: India 271-6, trail by 12

84th over: India 271-6 (Ashwin 57, Jadeja 31) Anderson bowls the final over of 
the day, which begins with the limping Ashwin executing a controlled pull off a 
shorter ball down the deep square leg boundary for one. It’s the only scoring 
shot of the over, and the last scoring shot of the day. India close 12 behind, 
after an absorbing, fluctuating day.

83rd over: India 270-6 (Ashwin 56, Jadeja 31) Ashwin nudges a short ball from 
Woakes off his chest for a single – the lack of pace in this pitch is still 
evident with the new ball. A legside trap is then set for Jadeja – it’s all 
pretty telegraphed, as is the subsequent wide bouncer – and the batsman is 
unsnared by it.

82nd over: India 269-6 (Ashwin 55, Jadeja 31) This loss of control will bother 
England: Ashwin reaches his half-century with another fine cover drive for four 
off Anderson, and follows it with an absolutely delicious maker’s-name-showing 
straight drive for another boundary. Neither were particularly bad balls, 
particularly the latter. A single rounds off an expensive over.

81st over: India 260-6 (Ashwin 46, Jadeja 31) Woakes is back to take the new 
ball, but the pattern continues with Ashwin showing good hands to dab away 
late, square on the offside, for one. No sooner had the Sky commentary team 
finished musing on Jadeja’s apparent preference for facing spin, than he 
punches a new-ball seamer exquisitely through the covers for four to bring up a 
really significant 50 partnership, the first such for this pairing. Having 
enjoyed that, he plays an even classier shot, clipping a straight ball to the 
deep midwicket boundary for four more. India will surely get a first-innings 
lead now.

80th over: India 250-6 (Ashwin 45, Jadeja 22) Jadeja pushes Rashid down the 
ground to bring up the 250. A couple of googlies keeps Ashwin honest in what is 
a much-needed tight over. He’s bowled exceedingly well today, though Vinod 
Menon wonders whether he isn’t bowling no-balls when coming from around the 
wicket. “Always outside the return crease,” he contends.

79th over: India 249-6 (Ashwin 45, Jadeja 21) A textbook late cut from Ashwin 
brings four more down to the third man boundary, as the camera hones in once 
more on Stokes’s trademark strained exasper-face. Another square cut off Batty 
brings one more, and England are gagging for the new ball now, surely. You 
can’t help sensing that if you are going to play three spinners, the third 
spinner needs to be in the game more.

78th over: India 243-6 (Ashwin 40, Jadeja 20) Jadeja really does cut loose 
this time – Rashid gives one some air, and the batsman does likewise, swinging 
lustily over the in-field and down the ground for four. Two more backward of 
square on the offside follow, before Jadeja really hits his straps, clobbering 
Rashid right out of the blockhole for SIX. In a match of fine margins, 
partnerships like this and overs like this could prove pivotal.

Bharat Tiwari, meanwhile, has important information on Indian cover versions: 
“Well Mr Raymond Reardon, I cordially invite you to India to acquaint yourself 
with this new age-quaint country. To paraphrase wise old Bilbo Baggins, “We 
Indians don’t know half of the Sitar classics half as well as we should like; 
and we like less than half of the modern drivel half as well as they deserve
.... “Much like the attention some of our middle order showered on the batting, 
or some of the OBO commentary straying wildly off topic. Lifeless, insipid 
covers and Starbucks?? I ask you...”

77th over: India 231-6 (Ashwin 40, Jadeja 8) Batty is back in the attack – 
will this tempt Jadeja out of his shell? Not really, no, though he picks up a 
languid one with a push towards long-on. It’s the only scoring shot of a tidy 
over, Batty’s best of the innings so far, though the bar wasn’t set notably 
high.

76th over: India 230-6 (Ashwin 40, Jadeja 7) Rashid returns promptly to the 
attack, concedes one to Ashwin before tucking Jadeja up competently enough 
until the left-hander cuts expansively for one. As Tim de Lisle reminds us, 
“Rashid has taken 16 Test wickets in India in three weeks. John Emburey managed 
eight in 13 years.”

75th over: India 228-6 (Ashwin 39, Jadeja 6) We still have 10 overs remaining 
so play’s likely to go through to 11.30am GMT, and we should see the new ball, 
if it’s taken. Jadeja takes a single off Anderson’s first ball, before a 
leg-bye follows after Anderson brings one in sharply and awkwardly at Ashwin.

“You’re inspiring me to think that a fey insipid cover of some classic iconic 
punk could be symbolic of our times,” writes Robin Hazlehurst. “How Brexity 
would it be to have a dreamy girly-girly cover of Anarchy in the UK - ‘don’t 
know what I want...’ Or a C&W version of RATM’s ‘Killing in the Name of’ for 
all the Trump voters. Wishy washy anger confectioned by marketers, so 
zeitgeisty for 2016.” Insipid cover versions are what provoked Brexit/Trump in 
the first place – that’s where yer rage of the dispossessed and marginalised 
comes from.

74th over: India 226-6 (Ashwin 39, Jadeja 5) Moeen pushes a faster ball in and 
back at Ashwin, who has to play it away late. He gives the batsman no room at 
all in this over, wicket to wicket while mixing up his flight a little. A very 
decent maiden.

73rd over: India 226-6 (Ashwin 39, Jadeja 5) Ashwin glides Anderson down to 
third man for a single. Jadeja meanwhile continues to go full-on dour 
anchorman, leaving or blocking almost everything. On the subject of 
cutting-edge modern London, Phillip Saunders adds this: “Damn those Romans: 
draining the marsh and taking the mud alongside the Thamesis fluvius.” Yep damn 
those poncey artisan Romans, with their hipster beards, beers, cheeses, 
straight roads and functioning toilets.

72nd over: India 225-6 (Ashwin 38, Jadeja 5) Ashwin unfurls a beautiful cover 
drive, as good as any we’ve seen for a while, hitting Moeen against the spin 
for four, and carves out a quicker delivery square on the offside for one. 
Jadeja is not yet showing the inclination or ability to cut loose and when he 
triest to, he finds a fielder.

71st over: India 220-6 (Ashwin 33, Jadeja 5) Jimmy Anderson gets another burst 
with the old ball (version 2.0), managing a bit of reverse away from the 
left-handed Jadeja, who’s cautious against the England spearhead. It’s a maiden.

“Do Indians do underwhelming cover versions of the great sitar music 
classics?” asks Raymond Reardon, while Nigel Steel reminds us: “In his very 
early days David Bowie (and the Lower Third) covered Chim Chim Cheree.”

70th over: India 220-6 (Ashwin 33, Jadeja 5) Jadeja’s single is the sole piece 
of scoring action from another disciplined over from Moeen. This still feels 
like a partnership of significance though, and one England need to break. 
Meanwhile my co-commentator Tim de Lisle, who knows a thing or two about 
bringing ill-informed music chat to heel, pipes up with some cold hard cricket 
facts: “England spinners in India:Rashid is already in the top ten. Among 
leggies, he’s in the top one

69th over: India 219-6 (Ashwin 33, Jadeja 4) Ashwin appears to be limping – he 
runs very gingerly after a nudge away on the legside off Stokes – and he looks 
in more pain after another quick single from Jadeja. But he carries on, and 
almost plays on, after inside-edging a full delivery. He then gets four from an 
absolute grubber – banged in back off a length but dibbling onto the toe of the 
bat and squirting behind the stumps for four.

Here’s William Hargreaves, again: “Starbuck knows his stuff, no doubt (he 
didn’t sell you that roll, did he?), but there is an overarching subtext, a 
feeling that we are being turned, by marketeers, into the people to whom they 
would like to market. We are being soothed into conveyor belt consumption with 
a background of lift music akin to the tone of the common room in ‘One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo’s Nest’.” I don’t know whether John sold me that roll, having 
never met him, so I’ll have to assume that, yes, it was him. Thanks, John. Can 
I have one of those ‘customer of the day’ type awards and get a free coffee 
later?

68th over: India 211-6 (Ashwin 26, Jadeja 3) Ashwin cuts for one off Moeen, 
who drops a little too short and wide at Jadeja and concedes two via a firm cut 
shot. Would only have been one had the fielding been sharper. Then we have a 
new old ball, the old one having properly split at the seam and deemed unfit 
for further use. A replacement is brought out. Moeen keeps Jadeja on the 
defensive, with Duckett in at short leg and Bairstow blethering away ten to the 
dozen behind the stumps.

Tweet of the session so far? Touché, anyway:
Alan Tyers (@alantyers) 
"He has stuffed the young man on debut there," says Nasser re Kohli running 
out Nair. Can anyone think of another example of such an event?

67th over: India 208-6 (Ashwin 25, Jadeja 1) Ashwin plays his favourite shot 
square on the offside for a single once more off Stokes, who comes round the 
wicket at the left-handed Jadeja. He gets off the mark with a slightly awkward 
chop down to third man for one. Ashwin adds one more when he helps a wider 
legside delivery round the corner, and they call for drinks.

66th over: India 205-6 (Ashwin 23, Jadeja 0) Moeen replaces Rashid, who was 
overdue a break. He doesn’t find the same turn and guile – that’s not what he’s 
there for – but he’s tight enough. There’s even a run-out referral, as the 
batsmen mystifyingly change their minds and decline a single from a drive down 
the ground, and the ball is returned at the stumps, but the non-striker, 
Jadeja, was easily home.

“Relax,” instructs John Starbuck on the subject of insipid John Lewis-ad style 
cover versions. “Poor covers are a feature of every age. In the 1950s there 
were a lot of C & W covers of standards from the 1930s e.g. Slim Whitman - 
yodelling Indian Love Call, Red Sails in the Sunset; in the 1960s plenty of 
similar songs were given the Big Ballad treatment (the Bachelors, Frank 
Ifield); the 1960s-1970s saw plenty of soul covers of C &W (Ray Charles) plus 
loads of reggae treatments of regular pop songs; then Status Quo began 
semi-heavy metal treatments in the same way; after that you get lots of actual 
snippets incorporated into hip-hop. Insipid female covers are just where we’re 
at now. You can say that at least the new Rolling Stones CD is a homage to the 
blues, but then that’s how they started out, so fair enough.The rationalisation 
for many of these is that they’re a return to the roots (Showaddywaddy, Alvin 
Stardust, Atomic Kitten, almost every boy band) when sometimes it’s just 
genuine liking for the songs of their youth, and sometimes pure exploitation of 
known hits.”

Thing is, I hate rockist veneration of white blokes with guitars, and don’t 
mind a disrespectful cover version or two, but this stuff is too lifeless and 
insipid to disrespect a fly. How did we get onto this subject? Aren’t we 
supposed to be discussing cricket?

65th over: India 204-6 (Ashwin 22, Jadeja 0) Stokes tries too hard sometimes 
and he digs one in absurdly short and it jags high and wide down the legside, 
beyond batsman and wicketkeeper for four byes. Then a more disciplined, subtle 
delivery, a tempter outside off-stump that moves just a little off the seam,
snares Kohli. The offside plan has worked. A Kohli-in-2014 dismissal. Now 
England have a left-hander to bowl at at last, with the handy Jadeja in. 
They’re not into the tail yet.

“Cmon now lads,” writes Bharat Tiwari. “There’s gentrification happening right 
on the field!! Indians were nattered at the poorly funded English batting and 
displaced them.

But then, weren’t too chuffed at doing such an unmentionable thing to a guest. 
Hence, the package of free wickets. Stop dragging Old smoke into this..”

Wicket! Kohli c Bairstow b Stokes 62, India 204-6

Got him! Kohli nibbles at a tempter just outside off-stump, edges and Bairstow 
takes. This is, one feels, A Moment.

64th over: India 199-5 (Kohli 62, Ashwin 21) Rashid strays down the legside a 
little and it’s too easy for Kohli to nudge it round the corner for two before 
he drives another wider one to deep extra-cover for a single. Ashwin looks as 
if he’s been in as long as his captain, to be frank, and plays a similar shot 
for the same outcome.

63rd over: India 195-5 (Kohli 59, Ashwin 20) Ashwin dabs Stokes backward of 
square on the offside yet again and takes a single. He gets some movement off 
the seam as he continues to seek to tempt Kohli on the drive, but he’s such an 
intelligent Test cricketer now and he’s on top of it all. A late cut off a 
shorter ball brings him one more.

“Just woke up after a long night involving the dreaded 
beer-followed-by-4am-red-wine sort of night,” writes Peter Salmon, failing to 
explain why he didn’t then just put the cricket on at 4, fire up the OBO and 
see it through to the morning. “There is bacon in the fridge, and I’m super 
hungry. But all others are still asleep. What are the ethics here? How quietly 
can one cook bacon? No greasy spoon here in Hereford, so its just me and my 
conscience. I can’t believe that at 46 I’m still having the same moral dilemmas 
I had at 18.” Simple. A fry-up for the entire household. Wake them all up. The 
cricket’s on after all.

62nd over: India 193-5 (Kohli 58, Ashwin 19) The shackles are really coming 
off again. Kohli turns Rashid behind square on the legside and such is the 
timing of the shot and the pace of the outfield that it’s four in the blink of 
an eye. He then clobbers a loosener through extra-cover, where the fielder gets 
a hand/wrist to it but can only deflect it and it brings two more. Another 
off-cut adds another couple. Rashid’s bowled well but might be due a rest now. 
He’s bowled 20 of this inning’s 62 overs, seven more than the next busiest 
(Woakes).

61st over: India 185-5 (Kohli 50, Ashwin 19) Stokes replaces Woakes – probably 
a wise change – and finds some bounce from just back of a length, but Kohli 
once again is on top of his game and he brings up his 50 with a dab past the 
slips for a single. Ashwin, too, has looked in impeccable touch from the get-go 
and he plays the most effortless of legside clips for four when Stokes slightly 
strays from his offside strategy. This has been an excellent partnership 
already.

“Ah, the ‘gentrification’ and ‘class war’ thing,” resumes William Hargreaves. 
“I left London ten years ago but follow her like a beautiful ex-girlfrirned who 
now dates a banker. Understandable from a financial perspective but saddening 
when it means that her greasy spoons have become homogenised, so to speak.” On 
an even more serious socio-political note, said Generic Chain Outlet was 
playing an insipid fey female singer cover version of Nirvana’s Come As You Are 
that was so fey and insipid it made me want to take a metaphorical baseball bat 
to the entire music industry. Sooner or later, every loud song in every genre 
will have been given the insispid fey acoustic cover treatment, and 
civilisation will finally be at its long-trailed end.

60th over: India 180-5 (Kohli 49, Ashwin 15) Rashid tosses one up a little too 
wide and Ashwin drives easily for one. He’s managing to get the odd one to spit 
up a bit though, and raps Kohli on the glove, but it bounces away harmlessly. 
Another single follows.

59th over: India 178-5 (Kohli 48, Ashwin 14) Woakes hasn’t quite worked out a 
line of attack yet for Ashwin, who dabs a short-ish ball away on the legside 
for one. An attempted yorker keeps Kohli on his toes, but he digs it away well 
enough, though he’s generally trying to tempt the captain on the drive, with an 
offside-heavy field set to counter it. But there isn’t a second slip, and Kohli 
knows it, artfully guiding a late glance in that direction to the boundary for 
four.

58th over: India 173-5 (Kohli 44, Ashwin 13) Ashwin rocks back and cuts Rashid 
in front of square on the offside for a single, but Rashid continues to do 
enough with his lengths and spin to generally keep Kohli on the defensive, 
though he can’t do anything about an excellent late cut from Kohli that brings 
four off the final ball of the over.

57th over: India 168-5 (Kohli 40, Ashwin 12) India cut loose again? Ashwin 
gets four with a deft push square on the offside that beats the field. That gap 
where a gully should be is unplugged, and it costs England four more when 
Ashwin drives in the same direction with the same result later in the over. 
Woakes comes back well though and has an lbw shout after spearing one in at 
Ashwin, but declines to review. The new man in then adds three more with a clip 
through midwicket.

“Game on,” chirps William Hargreaves. “Did you get anything to eat yet? 
Dispensing machine Lion bar at the tea break?” Better than that, just: I 
pottered down the road to Generic Chain Place to get a bacon and egg roll and 
tea, breaking my usual rule of only buying such items from proper old-school 
greasy spoons. But due to gentrification and London’s ongoing class war, no 
such greasy spoons exist in the vicinity. Danny from Withnail and I was right – 
London is a country coming down from its trip, and he said that in (a 
fictional) 1969.

56th over: India 157-5 (Kohli 40, Ashwin 1) Some nice tantalising pace and 
drift from Rashid at his fellow spinner Ashwin, who probably didn’t even have 
his whites, let alone his pads, on 15 minutes ago. No matter, he gets himself 
off the mark with an effortless glance on the legside for one. It’s a fine 
over, arguably a better one than the previous two from which he took wickets. 
This is liquid Test cricket now.

55th over: India 156-5 (Kohli 40, Ashwin 0) What is going off out there? 
Another wicket, this the result of a wicketkeeper fielding at point, gathering 
and throwing down the stumps at the non-striker’s end, though Kohli’s 
nonchalance in setting off and then trotting back left something to be desired. 
Nair might have wanted firmer, wiser direction from his captain there. The new 
man in, Ashwin, plays out the maiden. This is another pairing that England will 
need to separate swiftly, and the way this match has turned on its head since 
tea, who knows, they may have just a half-chance of doing so.

Wicket! Nair run out 4, India 156-5

Brilliant from Jos Buttler. Kohli drives. Buttler stops, smothers and throws 
down the stumps in one movement, and Nair, running back at the non-striker’s 
end, is out of his ground.

54th over: India 156-4 (Kohli 40, Nair 4) Rashid’s wrong’un brings another 
cheap dismissal for Rahane, and another scalp for the leg-spinner. The debutant 
Nair comes in and is kept on his toes by some nice varieties from Rashid, but 
he’s off the mark when he meets a more floated up delivery with a textbook 
cover drive for four.

Wicket! Rahane lbw b Rashid 0, India 152-4

Another? Yes it is! Rahane, a real walking wicket in this series, misreads a 
Rashid googly that nips back at him just a touch, and is absolutely plumb. A 
waste of a review too – that looked out straight away.

53rd over: India 152-3 (Kohli 40, Rahane 0) Given the surprising early 
breakthrough, there’s no real reason to persist with Batty, and Cook doesn’t, 
bringing back Woakes instead. He finds a bit of swing, though still no 
assistance from the pitch in terms of pace, and Kohli is defensive. A 
commendable over though, with variety in angles and movement, until Woakes 
over-reaches himself with the final ball of the over, an attempted inswinger 
that is over-pitched and pushed too far towards the legside – it beats Kohli, 
the keeper and zips to the ropes for four byes.

52nd over: India 148-3 (Kohli 40, Rahane 0) All those colour pieces being 
prepared about how India have given England a lesson in steady Test match 
batting and not giving any wickets away are shredded as Pujara hoiks a poor 
delivery from Rashid into the deep where Woakesclaims the catch. If you’re 
gonna hoik, hoik hard, and Pujara didn’t. The new man in, the out-of-form 
Rahane, plays out the wicket-maiden.

Wicket! Pujara c Woakes b Rashid 51, India 148-3

What a start for England! A couple of loose deliveries starts the over from 
Rashid, the second of which is swung out to deep midwicket where Woakes rushes 
in and scoops it up just before it hits the ground to claim the catch. It needs 
a review, but they’re in little doubt it’s a clean catch.

Tea, India 148-2

51st over: India 148-2 (Pujara 51, Kohli 40) Batty continues with his 
round-the-wicket trajectory at Kohli, who finds it too easy to flick him behind 
square and through a yawning gap for four. The same approach, and ball, brings 
him two more. Out of nowhere, Batty causes Kohli some discomfort with one that 
spits up at his glove and dobs down to where short leg isn’t. And that is tea. 
And my breakfast, hopefully. India’s session in the end, despite England not 
doing too much wrong. See you in a bit.

50th over: India 141-2 (Pujara 50, Kohli 34) As Nasser is pointing out, this 
is a lesson to England in Test match betting against challenging bowling, one 
England’s top order took little heed of yesterday. Kohli is again respectful 
against Rashid, who’s still finding some sharp turn at times, until the over 
ends with a rank legside long hop that’s pulled contemptuously to the boundary 
by the India captain. Kohli thinks it’s tea but the umpire’s having none of it.

49th over: India 137-2 (Pujara 50, Kohli 30) Pujara rocks back, steps aside 
and makes room smartly to cut Batty behind square on the offside for four, and 
similarly deft crease-movement enables him to flick the next ball to midwicket 
for a single that brings up yet another excellent, low-key 50. Batty goes round 
the wicket at Kohli who meets it with a wristy drive for four. And he uses his 
top-hand well next ball to flick another single on the legside.

This tweet, I feel, is slightly harsh on Batty, and rather harsh on me, given 
that I’m nowreally hungry:

48th over: India 127-2 (Pujara 45, Kohli 25) A faintly ridiculous couple of 
lbw shout from Bairstow as Rashid ‘pins’ Kohli in front, but on each occasion 
it’s hit the middle of his bat. It’s a very good over though, with a bit of 
variety in line and air, and Kohli’s taking no chances against him.

47th over: India 127-2 (Pujara 45, Kohli 25) After all this light mockery, 
Gareth Batty is finally getting a bowl. He replaces Stokes and his first ball, 
on a good line and length, is pushed away for a single to bring up the 50 
partnership. A legside pull from Pujara adds another, and Kohli, keen to rotate 
the strike off the new bowler, pushes another quick single. Two more are 
milked, which is clearly going to be the strategy with Batty.

Here’s Colum Farrelly putting the frighteners on me: ‘“I am the only person in 
the entire office at the moment.’No you’re not. I’m here too. And I’m watching 
you...” Damn. Better put those sparkly disco trousers away then.

46th over: India 122-2 (Pujara 43, Kohli 22) “Six bowlers in a Test match?!” 
harrumphs Nasser Hussain in the manner of an 80-year-old trying to fathom out 
how a smartphone works, as the issue of Batty’s deployment is discussed once 
more. Rashid bowls four decent balls before reverting to Bad Adil of yore with 
a filthy short ball down the legside that Pujara clobbers to the square-leg 
boundary for four.

45th over: India 114-2 (Pujara 36, Kohli 21) “What should England’s approach 
be,” Ian Botham in the commentary box is asked. “Declare,” he quips. On they 
plod though, and Stokes almost snares Pujara down the legside with a slanter 
that Pujara appears to tickle through to Bairstow, who spills it as he hits the 
ground. It was a tricky half-chance, but a half-chance nonetheless. A 
purposeful drive to mid-off for a single follows before Stokes whistles a smart 
bouncer past Kohli’s chin. Well bowled, well left, as has often been this 
afternoon’s pattern.

“Good Afternoon Tom.” Good afternoon Mahendra Killedar. “You have new ball 
bowlers & old ball bowlers. But what kind of bowler is this Batty? Oldest Ball 
Bowler? Bowls after 125th over?”

44th over: India 113-2 (Pujara 35, Kohli 21) Control is restored with a decent 
maiden from Rashid, targeting that offside corridor once again but Kohli 
proving resistant to temptation.

On the subject of breakfast,  my mum  John Starbuck writes: “I don’t get it. 
Why wouldn’t you and the other OBO writers not do yourselves a packed lunch for 
use as breakfast? If you tend to have eggs for breakfast, you can do them as a 
sandwich. Same with sausages. No need to worry about offending co-workers as 
there aren’t any about at that time.” That’s true. I am the only person in the 
entire office at the moment. I rule everything.

43rd over: India 113-2 (Pujara 35, Kohli 21) This is a different Pujara-Kohli 
partnership from the one in the last Test, with England at least applying some 
purposeful pressure if not quite putting them in serious trouble. But it 
prompts a slightly panicky single from Kohli who seems to catch Pujara 
off-guard with his call for a single, but the non-striker scurries home. A rare 
couple of boundaries ensue, as Stokes slants one across Pujara from wider on 
the crease and the batsman tucks it down to fine leg for four, before slicing 
one over the slips for four. Frustrating for Stokes, who didn’t really deserve 
that.

42nd over: India 104-2 (Pujara 27, Kohli 20) Rashid continues and keeps Pujara 
honest with a much tighter over, and bamboozles his wicketkeeper, if not the 
batsman, with one that turns sharply and forces Bairstow to parry it to first 
slip. Another maiden.

41st over: India 104-2 (Pujara 27, Kohli 20) Kohli shows his class, again, 
with a damn fine leave from an attempted snorter outside off-stump from Stokes. 
This is clearly the line the England seamers are aiming at though, as Stokes 
sends another testing outswinger past Kohli’s off-stump with his next ball. We 
get a maiden’s worth of this stuff.

close  
In the scheme of things, India are on top, as they were at the close yesterday 
– particularly with Ashwin and Jadeja’s partnership lighting up the closing 
stages of the day for India. But given that most England followers would have 
anticipated waking up to the home side being 250-2 or some such, then Alastair 
Cook’s side deserve great credit for staying in the game, particularly with 
that stunning little passage of play just after tea when a rash shot, a fine 
run-out and a couple of excellent deliveries brought a clatter of vital 
wickets. All England need to do now is wrap up the innings and then bat out of 
their skins, for a very long time, against the best spin attack in the world on 
a pitch likely to turn more and more as the match goes on. What could possibly 
go wrong?

It’s fascinatingly poised nonetheless. Stay on the site for reports, reaction 
and comment, but in the meantime thanks for your company, emails and musings on 
bad cover versions. Bye.
 
84th over: India 271-6 (Ashwin 57, Jadeja 31) Anderson bowls the final over of 
the day, which begins with the limping Ashwin executing a controlled pull off a 
shorter ball down the deep square leg boundary for one. It’s the only scoring 
shot of the over, and the last scoring shot of the day. India close 12 behind, 
after an absorbing, fluctuating day.
 
83rd over: India 270-6 (Ashwin 56, Jadeja 31) Ashwin nudges a short ball from 
Woakes off his chest for a single – the lack of pace in this pitch is still 
evident with the new ball. A legside trap is then set for Jadeja – it’s all 
pretty telegraphed, as is the subsequent wide bouncer – and the batsman is 
unsnared by it.
 
82nd over: India 269-6 (Ashwin 55, Jadeja 31) This loss of control will bother 
England: Ashwin reaches his half-century with another fine cover drive for four 
off Anderson, and follows it with an absolutely delicious maker’s-name-showing 
straight drive for another boundary. Neither were particularly bad balls, 
particularly the latter. A single rounds off an expensive over.
 
81st over: India 260-6 (Ashwin 46, Jadeja 31) Woakes is back to take the new 
ball, but the pattern continues with Ashwin showing good hands to dab away 
late, square on the offside, for one. No sooner had the Sky commentary team 
finished musing on Jadeja’s apparent preference for facing spin, than he 
punches a new-ball seamer exquisitely through the covers for four to bring up a 
really significant 50 partnership, the first such for this pairing. Having 
enjoyed that, he plays an even classier shot, clipping a straight ball to the 
deep midwicket boundary for four more. India will surely get a first-innings 
lead now.
 
80th over: India 250-6 (Ashwin 45, Jadeja 22) Jadeja pushes Rashid down the 
ground to bring up the 250. A couple of googlies keeps Ashwin honest in what is 
a much-needed tight over. He’s bowled exceedingly well today, though Vinod 
Menon wonders whether he isn’t bowling no-balls when coming from around the 
wicket. “Always outside the return crease,” he contends.
 
79th over: India 249-6 (Ashwin 45, Jadeja 21) A textbook late cut from Ashwin 
brings four more down to the third man boundary, as the camera hones in once 
more on Stokes’s trademark strained exasper-face. Another square cut off Batty 
brings one more, and England are gagging for the new ball now, surely. You 
can’t help sensing that if you are going to play three spinners, the third 
spinner needs to be in the game more.
 
78th over: India 243-6 (Ashwin 40, Jadeja 20) Jadeja really does cut loose 
this time – Rashid gives one some air, and the batsman does likewise, swinging 
lustily over the in-field and down the ground for four. Two more backward of 
square on the offside follow, before Jadeja really hits his straps, clobbering 
Rashid right out of the blockhole for SIX. In a match of fine margins, 
partnerships like this and overs like this could prove pivotal.

Bharat Tiwari, meanwhile, has important information on Indian cover versions: 
“Well Mr Raymond Reardon, I cordially invite you to India to acquaint yourself 
with this new age-quaint country. To paraphrase wise old Bilbo Baggins, “We 
Indians don’t know half of the Sitar classics half as well as we should like; 
and we like less than half of the modern drivel half as well as they deserve
.... “Much like the attention some of our middle order showered on the batting, 
or some of the OBO commentary straying wildly off topic. Lifeless, insipid 
covers and Starbucks?? I ask you...”
 
77th over: India 231-6 (Ashwin 40, Jadeja 8) Batty is back in the attack – 
will this tempt Jadeja out of his shell? Not really, no, though he picks up a 
languid one with a push towards long-on. It’s the only scoring shot of a tidy 
over, Batty’s best of the innings so far, though the bar wasn’t set notably 
high.
 
76th over: India 230-6 (Ashwin 40, Jadeja 7) Rashid returns promptly to the 
attack, concedes one to Ashwin before tucking Jadeja up competently enough 
until the left-hander cuts expansively for one. As Tim de Lisle reminds us, 
“Rashid has taken 16 Test wickets in India in three weeks. John Emburey managed 
eight in 13 years.”
 
75th over: India 228-6 (Ashwin 39, Jadeja 6) We still have 10 overs remaining 
so play’s likely to go through to 11.30am GMT, and we should see the new ball, 
if it’s taken. Jadeja takes a single off Anderson’s first ball, before a 
leg-bye follows after Anderson brings one in sharply and awkwardly at Ashwin.

“You’re inspiring me to think that a fey insipid cover of some classic iconic 
punk could be symbolic of our times,” writes Robin Hazlehurst. “How Brexity 
would it be to have a dreamy girly-girly cover of Anarchy in the UK - ‘don’t 
know what I want...’ Or a C&W version of RATM’s ‘Killing in the Name of’ for 
all the Trump voters. Wishy washy anger confectioned by marketers, so 
zeitgeisty for 2016.” Insipid cover versions are what provoked Brexit/Trump in 
the first place – that’s where yer rage of the dispossessed and marginalised 
comes from.
 
74th over: India 226-6 (Ashwin 39, Jadeja 5) Moeen pushes a faster ball in and 
back at Ashwin, who has to play it away late. He gives the batsman no room at 
all in this over, wicket to wicket while mixing up his flight a little. A very 
decent maiden.
 
73rd over: India 226-6 (Ashwin 39, Jadeja 5) Ashwin glides Anderson down to 
third man for a single. Jadeja meanwhile continues to go full-on dour 
anchorman, leaving or blocking almost everything. On the subject of 
cutting-edge modern London, Phillip Saunders adds this: “Damn those Romans: 
draining the marsh and taking the mud alongside the Thamesis fluvius.” Yep damn 
those poncey artisan Romans, with their hipster beards, beers, cheeses, 
straight roads and functioning toilets.
 
72nd over: India 225-6 (Ashwin 38, Jadeja 5) Ashwin unfurls a beautiful cover 
drive, as good as any we’ve seen for a while, hitting Moeen against the spin 
for four, and carves out a quicker delivery square on the offside for one. 
Jadeja is not yet showing the inclination or ability to cut loose and when he 
triest to, he finds a fielder.
 
71st over: India 220-6 (Ashwin 33, Jadeja 5) Jimmy Anderson gets another burst 
with the old ball (version 2.0), managing a bit of reverse away from the 
left-handed Jadeja, who’s cautious against the England spearhead. It’s a maiden.

“Do Indians do underwhelming cover versions of the great sitar music 
classics?” asks Raymond Reardon, while Nigel Steel reminds us: “In his very 
early days David Bowie (and the Lower Third) covered Chim Chim Cheree.”
 
70th over: India 220-6 (Ashwin 33, Jadeja 5) Jadeja’s single is the sole piece 
of scoring action from another disciplined over from Moeen. This still feels 
like a partnership of significance though, and one England need to break. 
Meanwhile my co-commentator Tim de Lisle, who knows a thing or two about 
bringing ill-informed music chat to heel, pipes up with some cold hard cricket 
facts: “England spinners in India:Rashid is already in the top ten. Among 
leggies, he’s in the top one 
<http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?bowling_pacespin=2;class=1;filter=advanced;host=6;team=1;template=results;type=bowling>
.”
 
69th over: India 219-6 (Ashwin 33, Jadeja 4) Ashwin appears to be limping – he 
runs very gingerly after a nudge away on the legside off Stokes – and he looks 
in more pain after another quick single from Jadeja. But he carries on, and 
almost plays on, after inside-edging a full delivery. He then gets four from an 
absolute grubber – banged in back off a length but dibbling onto the toe of the 
bat and squirting behind the stumps for four.

Here’s William Hargreaves, again: “Starbuck knows his stuff, no doubt (he 
didn’t sell you that roll, did he?), but there is an overarching subtext, a 
feeling that we are being turned, by marketeers, into the people to whom they 
would like to market. We are being soothed into conveyor belt consumption with 
a background of lift music akin to the tone of the common room in ‘One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo’s Nest’.” I don’t know whether John sold me that roll, having 
never met him, so I’ll have to assume that, yes, it was him. Thanks, John. Can 
I have one of those ‘customer of the day’ type awards and get a free coffee 
later?
 
68th over: India 211-6 (Ashwin 26, Jadeja 3) Ashwin cuts for one off Moeen, 
who drops a little too short and wide at Jadeja and concedes two via a firm cut 
shot. Would only have been one had the fielding been sharper. Then we have a 
new old ball, the old one having properly split at the seam and deemed unfit 
for further use. A replacement is brought out. Moeen keeps Jadeja on the 
defensive, with Duckett in at short leg and Bairstow blethering away ten to the 
dozen behind the stumps.
 
Tweet of the session so far? Touché, anyway:

"He has stuffed the young man on debut there," says Nasser re Kohli running 
out Nair. Can anyone think of another example of such an event?

<https://twitter.com/alantyers/status/802805233432739840>  
67th over: India 208-6 (Ashwin 25, Jadeja 1) Ashwin plays his favourite shot 
square on the offside for a single once more off Stokes, who comes round the 
wicket at the left-handed Jadeja. He gets off the mark with a slightly awkward 
chop down to third man for one. Ashwin adds one more when he helps a wider 
legside delivery round the corner, and they call for drinks.
 
66th over: India 205-6 (Ashwin 23, Jadeja 0) Moeen replaces Rashid, who was 
overdue a break. He doesn’t find the same turn and guile – that’s not what he’s 
there for – but he’s tight enough. There’s even a run-out referral, as the 
batsmen mystifyingly change their minds and decline a single from a drive down 
the ground, and the ball is returned at the stumps, but the non-striker, 
Jadeja, was easily home.

“Relax,” instructs John Starbuck on the subject of insipid John Lewis-ad style 
cover versions. “Poor covers are a feature of every age. In the 1950s there 
were a lot of C & W covers of standards from the 1930s e.g. Slim Whitman - 
yodelling Indian Love Call, Red Sails in the Sunset; in the 1960s plenty of 
similar songs were given the Big Ballad treatment (the Bachelors, Frank 
Ifield); the 1960s-1970s saw plenty of soul covers of C &W (Ray Charles) plus 
loads of reggae treatments of regular pop songs; then Status Quo began 
semi-heavy metal treatments in the same way; after that you get lots of actual 
snippets incorporated into hip-hop. Insipid female covers are just where we’re 
at now. You can say that at least the new Rolling Stones CD is a homage to the 
blues, but then that’s how they started out, so fair enough.The rationalisation 
for many of these is that they’re a return to the roots (Showaddywaddy, Alvin 
Stardust, Atomic Kitten, almost every boy band) when sometimes it’s just 
genuine liking for the songs of their youth, and sometimes pure exploitation of 
known hits.”

Thing is, I hate rockist veneration of white blokes with guitars, and don’t 
mind a disrespectful cover version or two, but this stuff is too lifeless and 
insipid to disrespect a fly. How did we get onto this subject? Aren’t we 
supposed to be discussing cricket?
 
65th over: India 204-6 (Ashwin 22, Jadeja 0) Stokes tries too hard sometimes 
and he digs one in absurdly short and it jags high and wide down the legside, 
beyond batsman and wicketkeeper for four byes. Then a more disciplined, subtle 
delivery, a tempter outside off-stump that moves just a little off the seam,
snares Kohli. The offside plan has worked. A Kohli-in-2014 dismissal. Now 
England have a left-hander to bowl at at last, with the handy Jadeja in. 
They’re not into the tail yet.

“Cmon now lads,” writes Bharat Tiwari. “There’s gentrification happening right 
on the field!! Indians were nattered at the poorly funded English batting and 
displaced them.

But then, weren’t too chuffed at doing such an unmentionable thing to a guest. 
Hence, the package of free wickets. Stop dragging Old smoke into this..”
 
Got him! Kohli nibbles at a tempter just outside off-stump, edges and Bairstow 
takes. This is, one feels, A Moment.
 
64th over: India 199-5 (Kohli 62, Ashwin 21) Rashid strays down the legside a 
little and it’s too easy for Kohli to nudge it round the corner for two before 
he drives another wider one to deep extra-cover for a single. Ashwin looks as 
if he’s been in as long as his captain, to be frank, and plays a similar shot 
for the same outcome.
 
63rd over: India 195-5 (Kohli 59, Ashwin 20) Ashwin dabs Stokes backward of 
square on the offside yet again and takes a single. He gets some movement off 
the seam as he continues to seek to tempt Kohli on the drive, but he’s such an 
intelligent Test cricketer now and he’s on top of it all. A late cut off a 
shorter ball brings him one more.

“Just woke up after a long night involving the dreaded 
beer-followed-by-4am-red-wine sort of night,” writes Peter Salmon, failing to 
explain why he didn’t then just put the cricket on at 4, fire up the OBO and 
see it through to the morning. “There is bacon in the fridge, and I’m super 
hungry. But all others are still asleep. What are the ethics here? How quietly 
can one cook bacon? No greasy spoon here in Hereford, so its just me and my 
conscience. I can’t believe that at 46 I’m still having the same moral dilemmas 
I had at 18.” Simple. A fry-up for the entire household. Wake them all up. The 
cricket’s on after all.
 
62nd over: India 193-5 (Kohli 58, Ashwin 19) The shackles are really coming 
off again. Kohli turns Rashid behind square on the legside and such is the 
timing of the shot and the pace of the outfield that it’s four in the blink of 
an eye. He then clobbers a loosener through extra-cover, where the fielder gets 
a hand/wrist to it but can only deflect it and it brings two more. Another 
off-cut adds another couple. Rashid’s bowled well but might be due a rest now. 
He’s bowled 20 of this inning’s 62 overs, seven more than the next busiest 
(Woakes).
 
61st over: India 185-5 (Kohli 50, Ashwin 19) Stokes replaces Woakes – probably 
a wise change – and finds some bounce from just back of a length, but Kohli 
once again is on top of his game and he brings up his 50 with a dab past the 
slips for a single. Ashwin, too, has looked in impeccable touch from the get-go 
and he plays the most effortless of legside clips for four when Stokes slightly 
strays from his offside strategy. This has been an excellent partnership 
already.

“Ah, the ‘gentrification’ and ‘class war’ thing,” resumes William Hargreaves. 
“I left London ten years ago but follow her like a beautiful ex-girlfrirned who 
now dates a banker. Understandable from a financial perspective but saddening 
when it means that her greasy spoons have become homogenised, so to speak.” On 
an even more serious socio-political note, said Generic Chain Outlet was 
playing an insipid fey female singer cover version of Nirvana’s Come As You Are 
that was so fey and insipid it made me want to take a metaphorical baseball bat 
to the entire music industry. Sooner or later, every loud song in every genre 
will have been given the insispid fey acoustic cover treatment, and 
civilisation will finally be at its long-trailed end.
 
60th over: India 180-5 (Kohli 49, Ashwin 15) Rashid tosses one up a little too 
wide and Ashwin drives easily for one. He’s managing to get the odd one to spit 
up a bit though, and raps Kohli on the glove, but it bounces away harmlessly. 
Another single follows.
 
59th over: India 178-5 (Kohli 48, Ashwin 14) Woakes hasn’t quite worked out a 
line of attack yet for Ashwin, who dabs a short-ish ball away on the legside 
for one. An attempted yorker keeps Kohli on his toes, but he digs it away well 
enough, though he’s generally trying to tempt the captain on the drive, with an 
offside-heavy field set to counter it. But there isn’t a second slip, and Kohli 
knows it, artfully guiding a late glance in that direction to the boundary for 
four.
 
58th over: India 173-5 (Kohli 44, Ashwin 13) Ashwin rocks back and cuts Rashid 
in front of square on the offside for a single, but Rashid continues to do 
enough with his lengths and spin to generally keep Kohli on the defensive, 
though he can’t do anything about an excellent late cut from Kohli that brings 
four off the final ball of the over.

57th over: India 168-5 (Kohli 40, Ashwin 12) India cut loose again? Ashwin 
gets four with a deft push square on the offside that beats the field. That gap 
where a gully should be is unplugged, and it costs England four more when 
Ashwin drives in the same direction with the same result later in the over. 
Woakes comes back well though and has an lbw shout after spearing one in at 
Ashwin, but declines to review. The new man in then adds three more with a clip 
through midwicket.

“Game on,” chirps William Hargreaves. “Did you get anything to eat yet? 
Dispensing machine Lion bar at the tea break?” Better than that, just: I 
pottered down the road to Generic Chain Place to get a bacon and egg roll and 
tea, breaking my usual rule of only buying such items from proper old-school 
greasy spoons. But due to gentrification and London’s ongoing class war, no 
such greasy spoons exist in the vicinity. Danny from Withnail and I was right – 
London is a country coming down from its trip, and he said that in (a 
fictional) 1969.
 
56th over: India 157-5 (Kohli 40, Ashwin 1) Some nice tantalising pace and 
drift from Rashid at his fellow spinner Ashwin, who probably didn’t even have 
his whites, let alone his pads, on 15 minutes ago. No matter, he gets himself 
off the mark with an effortless glance on the legside for one. It’s a fine 
over, arguably a better one than the previous two from which he took wickets. 
This is liquid Test cricket now.
 
55th over: India 156-5 (Kohli 40, Ashwin 0) What is going off out there? 
Another wicket, this the result of a wicketkeeper fielding at point, gathering 
and throwing down the stumps at the non-striker’s end, though Kohli’s 
nonchalance in setting off and then trotting back left something to be desired. 
Nair might have wanted firmer, wiser direction from his captain there. The new 
man in, Ashwin, plays out the maiden. This is another pairing that England will 
need to separate swiftly, and the way this match has turned on its head since 
tea, who knows, they may have just a half-chance of doing so.
 
Brilliant from Jos Buttler. Kohli drives. Buttler stops, smothers and throws 
down the stumps in one movement, and Nair, running back at the non-striker’s 
end, is out of his ground.
 
54th over: India 156-4 (Kohli 40, Nair 4) Rashid’s wrong’un brings another 
cheap dismissal for Rahane, and another scalp for the leg-spinner. The debutant 
Nair comes in and is kept on his toes by some nice varieties from Rashid, but 
he’s off the mark when he meets a more floated up delivery with a textbook 
cover drive for four.
 
Another? Yes it is! Rahane, a real walking wicket in this series, misreads a 
Rashid googly that nips back at him just a touch, and is absolutely plumb. A 
waste of a review too – that looked out straight away.
 
53rd over: India 152-3 (Kohli 40, Rahane 0) Given the surprising early 
breakthrough, there’s no real reason to persist with Batty, and Cook doesn’t, 
bringing back Woakes instead. He finds a bit of swing, though still no 
assistance from the pitch in terms of pace, and Kohli is defensive. A 
commendable over though, with variety in angles and movement, until Woakes 
over-reaches himself with the final ball of the over, an attempted inswinger 
that is over-pitched and pushed too far towards the legside – it beats Kohli, 
the keeper and zips to the ropes for four byes.
 
52nd over: India 148-3 (Kohli 40, Rahane 0) All those colour pieces being 
prepared about how India have given England a lesson in steady Test match 
batting and not giving any wickets away are shredded as Pujara hoiks a poor 
delivery from Rashid into the deep where Woakesclaims the catch. If you’re 
gonna hoik, hoik hard, and Pujara didn’t. The new man in, the out-of-form 
Rahane, plays out the wicket-maiden.
 
What a start for England! A couple of loose deliveries starts the over from 
Rashid, the second of which is swung out to deep midwicket where Woakes rushes 
in and scoops it up just before it hits the ground to claim the catch. It needs 
a review, but they’re in little doubt it’s a clean catch.
 
Statistical food for thought, as the players return to the field:

This is now the highest partnership in this match. Best England managed was 69 
between Bairstow and Buttler. This is now worth 73#INDvENG

51st over: India 148-2 (Pujara 51, Kohli 40) Batty continues with his 
round-the-wicket trajectory at Kohli, who finds it too easy to flick him behind 
square and through a yawning gap for four. The same approach, and ball, brings 
him two more. Out of nowhere, Batty causes Kohli some discomfort with one that 
spits up at his glove and dobs down to where short leg isn’t. And that is tea. 
And my breakfast, hopefully. India’s session in the end, despite England not 
doing too much wrong. See you in a bit.
 
50th over: India 141-2 (Pujara 50, Kohli 34) As Nasser is pointing out, this 
is a lesson to England in Test match betting against challenging bowling, one 
England’s top order took little heed of yesterday. Kohli is again respectful 
against Rashid, who’s still finding some sharp turn at times, until the over 
ends with a rank legside long hop that’s pulled contemptuously to the boundary 
by the India captain. Kohli thinks it’s tea but the umpire’s having none of it.
 
49th over: India 137-2 (Pujara 50, Kohli 30) Pujara rocks back, steps aside 
and makes room smartly to cut Batty behind square on the offside for four, and 
similarly deft crease-movement enables him to flick the next ball to midwicket 
for a single that brings up yet another excellent, low-key 50. Batty goes round 
the wicket at Kohli who meets it with a wristy drive for four. And he uses his 
top-hand well next ball to flick another single on the legside.

This tweet, I feel, is slightly harsh on Batty, and rather harsh on me, given 
that I’m nowreally hungry:

48th over: India 127-2 (Pujara 45, Kohli 25) A faintly ridiculous couple of 
lbw shout from Bairstow as Rashid ‘pins’ Kohli in front, but on each occasion 
it’s hit the middle of his bat. It’s a very good over though, with a bit of 
variety in line and air, and Kohli’s taking no chances against him.
 
47th over: India 127-2 (Pujara 45, Kohli 25) After all this light mockery, 
Gareth Batty is finally getting a bowl. He replaces Stokes and his first ball, 
on a good line and length, is pushed away for a single to bring up the 50 
partnership. A legside pull from Pujara adds another, and Kohli, keen to rotate 
the strike off the new bowler, pushes another quick single. Two more are 
milked, which is clearly going to be the strategy with Batty.

Here’s Colum Farrelly putting the frighteners on me: ‘“I am the only person in 
the entire office at the moment.’No you’re not. I’m here too. And I’m watching 
you...” Damn. Better put those sparkly disco trousers away then.
 
46th over: India 122-2 (Pujara 43, Kohli 22) “Six bowlers in a Test match?!” 
harrumphs Nasser Hussain in the manner of an 80-year-old trying to fathom out 
how a smartphone works, as the issue of Batty’s deployment is discussed once 
more. Rashid bowls four decent balls before reverting to Bad Adil of yore with 
a filthy short ball down the legside that Pujara clobbers to the square-leg 
boundary for four.
 
45th over: India 114-2 (Pujara 36, Kohli 21) “What should England’s approach 
be,” Ian Botham in the commentary box is asked. “Declare,” he quips. On they 
plod though, and Stokes almost snares Pujara down the legside with a slanter 
that Pujara appears to tickle through to Bairstow, who spills it as he hits the 
ground. It was a tricky half-chance, but a half-chance nonetheless. A 
purposeful drive to mid-off for a single follows before Stokes whistles a smart 
bouncer past Kohli’s chin. Well bowled, well left, as has often been this 
afternoon’s pattern.

“Good Afternoon Tom.” Good afternoon Mahendra Killedar. “You have new ball 
bowlers & old ball bowlers. But what kind of bowler is this Batty? Oldest Ball 
Bowler? Bowls after 125th over?”
 
44th over: India 113-2 (Pujara 35, Kohli 21) Control is restored with a decent 
maiden from Rashid, targeting that offside corridor once again but Kohli 
proving resistant to temptation.

On the subject of breakfast,  my mum  John Starbuck writes: “I don’t get it. 
Why wouldn’t you and the other OBO writers not do yourselves a packed lunch for 
use as breakfast? If you tend to have eggs for breakfast, you can do them as a 
sandwich. Same with sausages. No need to worry about offending co-workers as 
there aren’t any about at that time.” That’s true. I am the only person in the 
entire office at the moment. I rule everything.

 
43rd over: India 113-2 (Pujara 35, Kohli 21) This is a different Pujara-Kohli 
partnership from the one in the last Test, with England at least applying some 
purposeful pressure if not quite putting them in serious trouble. But it 
prompts a slightly panicky single from Kohli who seems to catch Pujara 
off-guard with his call for a single, but the non-striker scurries home. A rare 
couple of boundaries ensue, as Stokes slants one across Pujara from wider on 
the crease and the batsman tucks it down to fine leg for four, before slicing 
one over the slips for four. Frustrating for Stokes, who didn’t really deserve 
that.
 
42nd over: India 104-2 (Pujara 27, Kohli 20) Rashid continues and keeps Pujara 
honest with a much tighter over, and bamboozles his wicketkeeper, if not the 
batsman, with one that turns sharply and forces Bairstow to parry it to first 
slip. Another maiden.
 
41st over: India 104-2 (Pujara 27, Kohli 20) Kohli shows his class, again, 
with a damn fine leave from an attempted snorter outside off-stump from Stokes. 
This is clearly the line the England seamers are aiming at though, as Stokes 
sends another testing outswinger past Kohli’s off-stump with his next ball. We 
get a maiden’s worth of this stuff.
