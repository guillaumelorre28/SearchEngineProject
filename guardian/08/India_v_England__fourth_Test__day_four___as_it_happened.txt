Post-amble

There were actually some moments of close, competitive cricket between those 
two sides today, in the partnerships between Root and Bairstow, and, briefly, 
Bairstow and Stokes, but the fact remains that England are on course for 
another heavy defeat, still requiring 49 to make India bat again. The imperious 
Kohli and false 9 Jayant rubbed salt in the wounds in style in the first part 
of the day before the home side’s always-dominant spinners did their thing once 
again, bolstered by a seamer striking to dismiss a first-innings centurion in 
his first over. Root and Bairstow batted well but it wasn’t enough, isn’t 
enough. India will be 3-0 up before most of our UK-based OBO readers will have 
woken up tomorrow. Thanks for your company and emails, and Andrew Benton gets 
to play us out with this gloomy missive: “Could this be the end of England as 
we know it? Bangladesh was billed as a warm up tour, and the excellent 
preparation of making a mess there has clearly paid dividends in the resulting 
drubbing in India. Now would be a good time for Cook to retire as captain, 
still relatively on a high given the unbelievable India performance, and he’d 
have masses of respect if he did so.”

This will, one suspects, be the dominant talking point of the coming days. In 
the meantime here’s our on-the-whistle match report. Stay on the site for much 
more. Bye, and enjoy the rest of your weekend.

Wicket! (and stumps): Ball c Patel b Ashwin 2, England 182-6

47.3 overs: England 182-6 (Bairstow 50) Ashwin comes round the wicket at Ball, 
and finds some spitting turn outside off-stump, then rounds off the day with 
the dismissal of Ball, who just edges another swift top-spinner behind. An 
appropriately triumphant end to the day for a rampant India.

47th over: England 182-5 (Bairstow 50, Ball 2) Jadeja bowls what England want 
to be the last over of the day, but it isn’t. Ball is on strike, but again 
plays with orthodox defensive correctness until he’s frozen in the headlights 
by a sharply turning leg-break. The batsmen try to waste time as best they can, 
the bowler tries to rush it through with a similar sense of purpose. Ball takes 
a single off the last ball of the over.

46th over: England 181-5 (Bairstow 50, Ball 1) Ashwin tries out his full 
repertoire on Ball, with close catchers in either side of the wicket, but the 
nightwatchman, who batted so well in the first innings, manages to play out 
before getting off the mark with a technically adept push for a single.

45th over: England 180-5 (Bairstow 50, Ball 0) Jadeja tests Bairstow with a 
fuller, quicker ball that he edges along the ground to slip, in a tight maiden 
over. The horns are honking again, there’s an exuberant buzz about the ground,

44th over: England 180-5 (Bairstow 50, Ball 0) Bairstow completes a rugged and 
resilient half-century with a flick off his legs for a single from Ashwin. It’s 
been a bold display after a bracing start, but this potentially handy 
partnership goes no further:Stokes is dismissed after reverse-sweeping onto his 
boot and being taken at second slip. It’s reviwed but it’s the right decision. 
Ball, in as nightwatchman, has to fend off a menacing carom ball straight up 
but survives the over.

Wicket! Stokes c Vijay b Ashwin 18, England 180-5

Stokes is gone. The umpires check whether Stokes connected with his reverse 
sweep shot. It did. He swept it onto his boot, it cannoned up into the air and 
was taken at slip by Vijay. Good decision.

43rd over: England 179-4 (Bairstow 49, Stokes 18) A change of ends for Jadeja 
too now, Bairstow picking up a well-run two off his first ball with a flick 
square on the legside. Jadeja has an energetic lbw shout when Stokes pushes 
forward, prods, misses and is hit on the back pad. But the umpire’s unmoved.

Amid all the doom, gloom and harrumphing, everyone’s pal, Rob Smyth, has a 
sunnier outlook: “Has a team ever played better while being thrashed than 
England in this series?” he chirps, his pint half-full. “It’s probably going to 
end up as a noble 4-0 defeat.” Not sure whether it’s been a great performance 
as a team, but there have been a greater collection of encouraging individual 
performances than one might normally expect in your common-or-garden drubbing.

42nd over: England 176-4 (Bairstow 46, Stokes 18) Stokes is on to anything 
short, and he cracks Ashwin away again on the offside for a single. Bairstow 
plays late off another shorter ball, pushing it to leg for one more. A fuller, 
sharply turning ball vexes Stokes a touch, the batsman driving and missing. 
Looks like people won’t be getting that shopping/self-discovery day in Mumbai 
tomorrow after all. At least not initially.

41st over: England 174-4 (Bairstow 45, Stokes 17) Jayant finds some 
extravagant turn outside off-stump but it’s short enough for Stokes to read. He 
and Bairstow swap ends twice with swift singles before Stokes misjudges a 
reverse sweep attempt, which bounces up off his forearm and over Kohli. He gets 
one for it, and two more follow with a rather more accomplished shot from 
Bairstow. These two are motoring along nicely, in between the scares and 
appeals.

40th over: England 167-4 (Bairstow 40, Stokes 16) An awry umpiring decision is 
again overturned, after Bairstow prods at Ashwin, the ball dobs up and is taken 
by a diving forward short leg. Umpire Oxenford’s finger goes up, Bairstow 
swiftly reviews and is vindicated. He hadn’t come close to hitting it. A two 
and two ones follow.

39th over: England 163-4 (Bairstow 37, Stokes 15) Bairstow sweeps hard at 
Jayant but it’s well cut off at the square leg boundary and they only take one. 
Bairstow then hammers a short ball off the back foot in front of square on the 
offside for four, following it with a slog-sweep for SIX. “That could be a 
maximum … it is,” hollers Nasser Hussain in the commentary box. <Sigh>. A six 
is NOT a “maximum”.

“I have a cunning plan,” whispers Chris Drew, “The ginger ninjas put on a 200 
partnership, then Jos comes in and scores a rapid century, setting up the 
declaration just before tea tomorrow. Adil makes amends by ‘doing a Monty’ and 
England win by 40 odd runs I’ll go for a lie-down now.” Yes, do.

38th over: England 152-4 (Bairstow 36, Stokes 5) Jadeja’s 15-over spell is 
ended, with Ashwin switching ends and coming on in his stead as the shadows 
lengthen over the outfield, almost reaching the square. The world’s No1 spinner 
is over the wicket at Bairstow, who makes an inelegant mess of a reverse-sweep 
attempt, completely missing – Patel fumbles the take too behind the stumps. He 
then adds a single with a legside flick. Ashwin duly switches to round the 
wicket at Stokes, and teases him again with his fuller flighted delivery, which 
the left-hander tends to prod tentatively at. But he sees out the over.

37th over: England 151-4 (Bairstow 35, Stokes 5) Bairstow gets away with it 
again, as a very uncertain attempted pull, feet splayed and deceived by bounce 
and spin, dobs up and just beyond short leg. He adds a single in rather more 
orthodox fashion before another no-ball for overstepping. Stokes wants to be 
assertive, as per, and picks up four, rocking back and cracking a short ball to 
the wide long-on boundary.

36th over: England 145-4 (Bairstow 34, Stokes 1) Jadeja thinks he’s got 
Bairstow with another ripper that Bairstow looks to have edged behind, but the 
batsman survives on DRS because Jadeja’s overstepped, and Bairstow didn’t 
feather it after all. He then adds a single, Stokes gets off the mark straight 
away with another, and England have to steady themselves again here.

Review! Bairstow c Patel b Jadeja?

The ball he’d long threatened with – has Jadeja got his man at last? NO HE 
HASN’T. Because DRS shows he’s overstepped: no ball.

35th over: England 141-4 (Bairstow 32, Stokes 0) Jayant continues. Root turns 
him round the corner for one. Bairstow hoiks him likewise towards the man at 
deep square leg and gets one more. But Jayant looks a bit more threatening in 
this over,and gets his reward, denying Root a hundred once more and deceiving 
him with a quicker ball, pinning him in front. It was an excellent knock from 
the vice-captain but England needed more, and that might be it.

Wicket! Root lbw b Jayant 77, England 141-4

As feared: Jayant pushes one through a bit quicker, it comes back in at Root, 
hits him low on the pad and he walks immediately.

34th over: England 139-3 (Root 76, Bairstow 31) When commentators start 
trumpeting England’s position – the two dropped chances they’ve survived, the 
failed reviews, the handy partnership etc – then their fans start to worry. On 
Root and Bairstow plod though, but the latter is made to look awkward by a 
Jadeja ball that turns sharply (again), brushes thigh and loops to slip, 
prompting an unconvincing, and doomed, appeal.

33rd over: England 138-3 (Root 75, Bairstow 31) Jayant’s not pushing it though 
as quickly as the other two spinners but still manages to concede four byes 
when a slightly wayward ball is missed by both batsman and keeper. Bairstow 
then picks up four with an enjoyably emphatic pull. Two more singles follow. In 
injury news that doesn’t concern England for a change, Shami and Saha are 
definitely out of the next Test.

And they’ll have a drink.

32nd over: England 127-3 (Root 73, Bairstow 26) Singles each for Bairstow and 
Root as Jadeja continues, before Bairstow plays a fine textbook cover drive 
that deserved four but brings only two. “In regard to your request for places 
to go shopping in Mumbai on Monday if England fail to see out Day 4 of the 
Mumbai Test,” writes Raymond Reardon, resuming a line of correspondence that 
had dried up during this partnership, “may I recommend that the England team 
members spend the day shopping atwww.crickstore.com <http://www.crickstore.com/>
 situated in Kondival, Mumbai and also they could make some purchases from the 
Deonar Abittoir to fill their cricket boxes.” Why all this consumerism? Aren’t 
middle-class English people supposed to go all hippy, shun material items and 
discover themselves on trips to India? And the same goes for mere fans.

31st over: England 123-3 (Root 72, Bairstow 23) A change of bowling, but it’s 
spin for spin, batting hero Jayant coming on. He’s round the wicket and slower 
than Ashwin, and almost gets his man straight away, appealing for a catch at 
forward short leg. Umpire Erasmus is having none of it though, and India spend 
so much time deliberating that they run out of time to review. Which is just as 
well as it hadn’t hit the bat. Root picks up four – and his 1,000th run against 
India – by pulling a short ball backward of square to the boundary. An eventful 
over ends with another appeal, this one for lbw, and this oneis reviewed. It 
turned a fraction back into the batsman and looked good for line but was going 
over the top.

30th over: England 116-3 (Root 63, Bairstow 20) Jadeja sends his trademark 
sharp turner past Bairstow’s stranded bat, but the Yorkshireman responds with a 
well played late cut for a single. Two more singles keep the strike rotating, 
before an astutely judged square cut gives Root two more. England are rattling 
along at almost four an over here, which is an achievement of sorts, and almost 
certainly the only approach to take.

29th over: England 111-3 (Root 63, Bairstow 20) Bairstow cuts a shorter ball 
in front of square for a single off Ashwin, who continues to come in from round 
the wicket. Root plays a rasher shot, missing a sweep that loops up off his pad 
just over the man at short leg. It’s good pressure from Ashwin though, although 
Bairstow responds well with a neat late flick for a single. Another risky shot 
follows – a reverse sweep from Root – which bounces before reaching the man at 
backward point.

28th over: England 108-3 (Root 63, Bairstow 18) The 21st consecutive over of 
spin: Bairstow pushes Jadeja off the back foot towards mid-on for a single, and 
Root adds another. This is good strike rotation from England as the ones 
continue. A minor-key triumph for Root is that Jadeja no longer has any close 
catchers in front of the wicket in for him.

27th over: England 105-3 (Root 62, Bairstow 16) Intelligent from Bairstow, who 
scoffs at Root’s request for a quick single and sends him back. But Ashwin’s 
looking a lot more dangerous from round the wicket and even the well-set Root 
misreads a couple. A maiden.

26th over: England 105-3 (Root 62, Bairstow 16) The hundred comes up with a 
nudge round the corner from Bairstow, but Jadeja continues to menace, beating 
Root’s forward prod with another ripper. Root responds with yet another 
front-foot sweep: once more, it’s four. And he keeps the strike with a single 
off the last ball.

25th over: England 99-3 (Root 57, Bairstow 15) Root pulls a shorter Ashwin 
ball in front of square on the legside for one. The bowler then changes tack, 
going round the wicket at Bairstow, and he should have been rewarded for it, as 
Bairstow’s rash reverse sweep isdropped by the sainted holy Kohli at slip. This 
new angle of attack has asked new questions of Bairstow but he sees it out and 
then takes a quick single with an on-drive that brings up the kind of quick 50 
partnership that looked utterly beyond England at tea.

24th over: England 97-3 (Root 56, Bairstow 14) Bairstow’s looking more 
confident in going forward to Jadeja now, but it’s in going back, square 
cutting a shorter ball off the back foot, that he gets a bottom-edged four. Two 
slips and a silly point stay in place, and Bairstow takes a risk with an uppish 
drive off a more flighted delivery that just falls short of mid-off. This is a 
good contest at the moment.

23rd over: England 93-3 (Root 56, Bairstow 10) Bairstow sweeps emphatically at 
Ashwin and picks up one, rather than four, thanks to Nair’s fine fielding in 
the deep. Root then brings up a really very accomplished 50 with a bold reverse 
sweep. That said, if he doesn’t convert this, England are even more doomed than 
they already are. He continues to attack though, and gets forward to drive 
through the offside for four more before a slightly more tenative prod round 
the corner brings a single. Bairstow then rounds off an expensive over with a 
sweep for another one.

22nd over: England 82-3 (Root 47, Bairstow 8) Bairstow, showing signs of 
settling (dare I say it?), clips Jadeja neatly away on the legside and gets 
three as it’s just about cut off on the boundary before Root plays his 
trademark shot of this innings – an assertive front-foot sweep in front of 
square – and gets four more.

21st over: England 75-3 (Root 43, Bairstow 5) I shouldn’t have said Bairstow 
looked more comfortable against Ashwin than Jadeja, as he’s almost bowled 
shouldering arms at one that bounces back in at his raised glove and nearly 
bounces onto the stumps. A swept single follows before an umpire’s referral for 
a stumping against Root, but he’s kept his back foot grounded. Root then rocks 
back and plays a well judged square cut for two. Well read.

20th over: England 72-3 (Root 41, Bairstow 4) Bairstow pushes a shorter Jadeja 
ball square on the legside for a single, before it’s Root’s turn to be 
bamboozled by the left-armer, who rips two consecutive leg-breaks sharply past 
his outside edge. Too good for the batsmen and, at times, the keeper, this 
stuff. Some commentary box chatter about how much better England were here four 
years ago with Swann and Panesar in the lineup, though that rather ignores how 
India have evolved into a much tighter, more focused Test-match side in the 
same period.

19th over: England 71-3 (Root 41, Bairstow 3) Root takes a single, giving 
Bairstow a chance to acclimatise himself against Ashwin, a task for which he 
looks slightly more comfortable, neatly clipping a single away on the legside. 
Two from the over.

Even the stats nerds are trying to jinx England:

18th over: England 69-3 (Root 40, Bairstow 2) Jadeja mercilessly teases 
Bairstow with two more beauties, jagged away past an outstretched bat, 
prompting Bairstow to then take a risk with an uppish drive that bounces just 
agonisingly short of the fielder at extra-cover. He survives the over though. 
Which is about all he can do at the moment.

17th over: England 69-3 (Root 40, Bairstow 2) A missed half-chance for Patel? 
Bairstow bottom edges off his glove and the keeper can’t grab it, but India can 
afford to be sanguine about missed half-chances, while England will have 
sleepless nights about theirs. He adds a single before Root sweeps aggressively 
again, hoiking towards deep midwicket for four. Given the persistent men around 
the bat that’s intelligent as well as assertive cricket from Root.

“Cook should have stood down in 2014 after the 5-0 farce down under,” thunders 
Dave Adams. “He only survived then due to the paucity of alternatives and his 
own refusal to do the decent thing. Nearly three years on, I don’t see a viable 
captain in the current squad, unless we want to ruin our best batsman. That’s a 
terrible reason to persist with the status quo though. Cook looks like he’s had 
enough - needs to be put out of his misery, much like England in this match.” 
Overlooking a decent period of refreshed positive cricket in summer 2015 and 
early 2016 there, Dave. Now, mind, they do look tired in every sense.

16th over: England 64-3 (Root 36, Bairstow 1) A single and four more byes as 
Jadeja continues to tease, torment and tantalise, and Bairstow finally gets off 
the mark, again driving perilously uppishly, at a turning ball on the offside. 
Root looks rather more settled and sweeps emphatically across the line for 
four, but he read it well.

15th over: England 54-3 (Root 30, Bairstow 0) Root meets Ashwin on the full 
again and bunts towards mid-off for a single, then Bairstow flirts with, nay 
snogs passionately, danger as he dabs defensively into his own thigh and it 
comes agonisingly close to bouncing back onto the stumps. He then misses 
completely one that bounces back in at him, as does Patel behind the stumps, 
and it’s four byes. Ashwin utterly on top of the new batsman here.

14th over: England 49-3 (Root 30, Bairstow 0) Can England’s right-handers dig 
them out of this somehow, now the lefties have gone? Jadeja, who’s bowled at 
least as well as Ashwin in this match, continues to find challenging turn and 
accuracy, as well as that crucial pace, and Bairstow’s first four deliveries 
consist of three play-and-misses and one defensive shot. They’re all dots, 
natch.

Some teatime musings: is this the longest sequence of consecutive Tests 
against Asian opposition England have had? By the end of this series, it will 
be 14, starting with Sri Lanka back at the start of the English summer. 
Alarmingly, the standard of performance has been on a downward trajectory, 
although facing India in Mumbai in December is a very different kettle of 
coconuts from Sri Lanka in Durham in May. On that theme, Chris Bates writes in 
from inside the Wankhede Stadium: “It was a great knock by Kohli. Some wags 
amongst the England fans have been sending texts to some sponsor’s app which 
appear on the big screen. Best so far was probably ‘Kohli may be one of the 
best batsman of all time but could he do it on a cold Tuesday night in Stoke. 
Tony Pulis.’ Having fun despite the carnage.”

And that's tea: England 49-3

13.2 overs: England 49-3 (Root 30) “I bet Moeen goes early,” I just mused to 
myself. And he does, slightly misjudging the bounce and nudging behind to Vijay 
at leg-slip. It brings the session to a close, as tea is called. This one will 
be over today now.

“I saw a feature recently 
<http://%20http//www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/testy-memories-the-three-most-important-wickets-in-cricket-history/news-story/089be7f4a9ea5bf75b129b439386c0d2>
 which worked out the most important wicket ever in test cricket in terms of 
consequences,” writes Peter Salmon. “Rashid might be a chance for most 
important drop, as obviously Cook will now resign, Root get the captaincy too 
early and see his career fall to pieces, followed by Stokes as captain for an 
Ashes hammering, and England down to sixth in the rankings? Can’t see another 
scenario at this point.”

On that cheery thought, I’ll nip out for a coffee. See you in a bit.

And another! Mooen tentatively prods Jadeja round the corner, Vijay dives low 
to his right and claims a fine catch.

13th over: England 49-2 (Root 30, Moeen 0) Root continues to play with 
assertive intent: he gets forward and flicks Ashwin down to fine leg for two 
but then faces an appeal for a catch after one loops up to the keeper off his 
pads.Kohli reviews, but there’s nothing remotely like an inside-edge, and not 
much of an lbw shout either, and the batsman survives. He celebrates the 
reprieve by driving a fuller delivery before it bounces through the covers for 
four.

12th over: England 43-2 (Root 24, Moeen 0) A nice, spin-smothering clip from 
Cook off Jadeja brings him a classy four. But then he’s gone! Flummoxed by the 
left-armer again, who drags him across his stumps, pins him in front with a 
quicker ball and claims him as his 100th Test scalp, and prompts a noisy crowd 
to chant his name and honk horns.

“A mention of the Bombay Stores in the 7th over,” writes  the Bombay Stores PR 
department John Starbuck, “leads me to recommend the Bradford version 
www.bombaystores.co.uk <http://www.bombaystores.co.uk/> where you can buy lots 
of colourful clothing gifts for the women and men in your life. Everything’s 
turning Indian now.” This match and series certainly has now, for good.

Wicket! Cook lbw b Jadeja 18, England 43-2

Is Cook out lbw here? Yes he is. He misses one that’s speared into him. The 
finger goes up, Cook sends it upstairs, but Spin vision and ball-tracking 
confirm he’s a goner.

11th over: England 39-1 (Cook 14, Root 24) Root and Cook take a single each 
off Ashwin. Then … a big appeal, as Ashwin brings one in sharply at Root and it 
bounces off his pad into the arms of short leg but it had missed his bat by a 
fair bit. He then pulls a shorter ball firmly for one, and Cook completes 
another to keep the scoreboard ticking over in vain pursuit of safety/dignity.

There were actually some moments of close, competitive cricket between those 
two sides today, in the partnerships between Root and Bairstow, and, briefly, 
Bairstow and Stokes, but the fact remains that England are on course for 
another heavy defeat, still requiring 49 to make India bat again. The imperious 
Kohli and false 9 Jayant rubbed salt in the wounds in style in the first part 
of the day before the home side’s always-dominant spinners did their thing once 
again, bolstered by a seamer striking to dismiss a first-innings centurion in 
his first over. Root and Bairstow batted well but it wasn’t enough, isn’t 
enough. India will be 3-0 up before most of our UK-based OBO readers will have 
woken up tomorrow. Thanks for your company and emails, and Andrew Benton gets 
to play us out with this gloomy missive: “Could this be the end of England as 
we know it? Bangladesh was billed as a warm up tour, and the excellent 
preparation of making a mess there has clearly paid dividends in the resulting 
drubbing in India. Now would be a good time for Cook to retire as captain, 
still relatively on a high given the unbelievable India performance, and he’d 
have masses of respect if he did so.”

This will, one suspects, be the dominant talking point of the coming days. In 
the meantime here’s our on-the-whistle match report. Stay on the site for much 
more. Bye, and enjoy the rest of your weekend.

47.3 overs: England 182-6 (Bairstow 50) Ashwin comes round the wicket at Ball, 
and finds some spitting turn outside off-stump, then rounds off the day with 
the dismissal of Ball, who just edges another swift top-spinner behind. An 
appropriately triumphant end to the day for a rampant India.
 
47th over: England 182-5 (Bairstow 50, Ball 2) Jadeja bowls what England want 
to be the last over of the day, but it isn’t. Ball is on strike, but again 
plays with orthodox defensive correctness until he’s frozen in the headlights 
by a sharply turning leg-break. The batsmen try to waste time as best they can, 
the bowler tries to rush it through with a similar sense of purpose. Ball takes 
a single off the last ball of the over.
 
46th over: England 181-5 (Bairstow 50, Ball 1) Ashwin tries out his full 
repertoire on Ball, with close catchers in either side of the wicket, but the 
nightwatchman, who batted so well in the first innings, manages to play out 
before getting off the mark with a technically adept push for a single.
 
45th over: England 180-5 (Bairstow 50, Ball 0) Jadeja tests Bairstow with a 
fuller, quicker ball that he edges along the ground to slip, in a tight maiden 
over. The horns are honking again, there’s an exuberant buzz about the ground, 
and India’s fans know the series is in the bag.
 
44th over: England 180-5 (Bairstow 50, Ball 0) Bairstow completes a rugged and 
resilient half-century with a flick off his legs for a single from Ashwin. It’s 
been a bold display after a bracing start, but this potentially handy 
partnership goes no further:Stokes is dismissed after reverse-sweeping onto his 
boot and being taken at second slip. It’s reviwed but it’s the right decision. 
Ball, in as nightwatchman, has to fend off a menacing carom ball straight up 
but survives the over.
 
Stokes is gone. The umpires check whether Stokes connected with his reverse 
sweep shot. It did. He swept it onto his boot, it cannoned up into the air and 
was taken at slip by Vijay. Good decision.
 
43rd over: England 179-4 (Bairstow 49, Stokes 18) A change of ends for Jadeja 
too now, Bairstow picking up a well-run two off his first ball with a flick 
square on the legside. Jadeja has an energetic lbw shout when Stokes pushes 
forward, prods, misses and is hit on the back pad. But the umpire’s unmoved.

Amid all the doom, gloom and harrumphing, everyone’s pal, Rob Smyth, has a 
sunnier outlook: “Has a team ever played better while being thrashed than 
England in this series?” he chirps, his pint half-full. “It’s probably going to 
end up as a noble 4-0 defeat.” Not sure whether it’s been a great performance 
as a team, but there have been a greater collection of encouraging individual 
performances than one might normally expect in your common-or-garden drubbing.
 
42nd over: England 176-4 (Bairstow 46, Stokes 18) Stokes is on to anything 
short, and he cracks Ashwin away again on the offside for a single. Bairstow 
plays late off another shorter ball, pushing it to leg for one more. A fuller, 
sharply turning ball vexes Stokes a touch, the batsman driving and missing. 
Looks like people won’t be getting that shopping/self-discovery day in Mumbai 
tomorrow after all. At least not initially.
 
41st over: England 174-4 (Bairstow 45, Stokes 17) Jayant finds some 
extravagant turn outside off-stump but it’s short enough for Stokes to read. He 
and Bairstow swap ends twice with swift singles before Stokes misjudges a 
reverse sweep attempt, which bounces up off his forearm and over Kohli. He gets 
one for it, and two more follow with a rather more accomplished shot from 
Bairstow. These two are motoring along nicely, in between the scares and 
appeals.
 
40th over: England 167-4 (Bairstow 40, Stokes 16) An awry umpiring decision is 
again overturned, after Bairstow prods at Ashwin, the ball dobs up and is taken 
by a diving forward short leg. Umpire Oxenford’s finger goes up, Bairstow 
swiftly reviews and is vindicated. He hadn’t come close to hitting it. A two 
and two ones follow.
 
39th over: England 163-4 (Bairstow 37, Stokes 15) Bairstow sweeps hard at 
Jayant but it’s well cut off at the square leg boundary and they only take one. 
Bairstow then hammers a short ball off the back foot in front of square on the 
offside for four, following it with a slog-sweep for SIX. “That could be a 
maximum … it is,” hollers Nasser Hussain in the commentary box. <Sigh>. A six 
is NOT a “maximum”.

“I have a cunning plan,” whispers Chris Drew, “The ginger ninjas put on a 200 
partnership, then Jos comes in and scores a rapid century, setting up the 
declaration just before tea tomorrow. Adil makes amends by ‘doing a Monty’ and 
England win by 40 odd runs I’ll go for a lie-down now.” Yes, do.
 
38th over: England 152-4 (Bairstow 36, Stokes 5) Jadeja’s 15-over spell is 
ended, with Ashwin switching ends and coming on in his stead as the shadows 
lengthen over the outfield, almost reaching the square. The world’s No1 spinner 
is over the wicket at Bairstow, who makes an inelegant mess of a reverse-sweep 
attempt, completely missing – Patel fumbles the take too behind the stumps. He 
then adds a single with a legside flick. Ashwin duly switches to round the 
wicket at Stokes, and teases him again with his fuller flighted delivery, which 
the left-hander tends to prod tentatively at. But he sees out the over.
 
37th over: England 151-4 (Bairstow 35, Stokes 5) Bairstow gets away with it 
again, as a very uncertain attempted pull, feet splayed and deceived by bounce 
and spin, dobs up and just beyond short leg. He adds a single in rather more 
orthodox fashion before another no-ball for overstepping. Stokes wants to be 
assertive, as per, and picks up four, rocking back and cracking a short ball to 
the wide long-on boundary.
 
36th over: England 145-4 (Bairstow 34, Stokes 1) Jadeja thinks he’s got 
Bairstow with another ripper that Bairstow looks to have edged behind, but the 
batsman survives on DRS because Jadeja’s overstepped, and Bairstow didn’t 
feather it after all. He then adds a single, Stokes gets off the mark straight 
away with another, and England have to steady themselves again here.
 
The ball he’d long threatened with – has Jadeja got his man at last? NO HE 
HASN’T. Because DRS shows he’s overstepped: no ball.
 
35th over: England 141-4 (Bairstow 32, Stokes 0) Jayant continues. Root turns 
him round the corner for one. Bairstow hoiks him likewise towards the man at 
deep square leg and gets one more. But Jayant looks a bit more threatening in 
this over,and gets his reward, denying Root a hundred once more and deceiving 
him with a quicker ball, pinning him in front. It was an excellent knock from 
the vice-captain but England needed more, and that might be it.
 
As feared: Jayant pushes one through a bit quicker, it comes back in at Root, 
hits him low on the pad and he walks immediately.
 
34th over: England 139-3 (Root 76, Bairstow 31) When commentators start 
trumpeting England’s position – the two dropped chances they’ve survived, the 
failed reviews, the handy partnership etc – then their fans start to worry. On 
Root and Bairstow plod though, but the latter is made to look awkward by a 
Jadeja ball that turns sharply (again), brushes thigh and loops to slip, 
prompting an unconvincing, and doomed, appeal.
 
33rd over: England 138-3 (Root 75, Bairstow 31) Jayant’s not pushing it though 
as quickly as the other two spinners but still manages to concede four byes 
when a slightly wayward ball is missed by both batsman and keeper. Bairstow 
then picks up four with an enjoyably emphatic pull. Two more singles follow. In 
injury news that doesn’t concern England for a change, Shami and Saha are 
definitely out of the next Test.

And they’ll have a drink.
 
32nd over: England 127-3 (Root 73, Bairstow 26) Singles each for Bairstow and 
Root as Jadeja continues, before Bairstow plays a fine textbook cover drive 
that deserved four but brings only two. “In regard to your request for places 
to go shopping in Mumbai on Monday if England fail to see out Day 4 of the 
Mumbai Test,” writes Raymond Reardon, resuming a line of correspondence that 
had dried up during this partnership, “may I recommend that the England team 
members spend the day shopping atwww.crickstore.com <http://www.crickstore.com/>
 situated in Kondival, Mumbai and also they could make some purchases from the 
Deonar Abittoir to fill their cricket boxes.” Why all this consumerism? Aren’t 
middle-class English people supposed to go all hippy, shun material items and 
discover themselves on trips to India? And the same goes for mere fans.
 
31st over: England 123-3 (Root 72, Bairstow 23) A change of bowling, but it’s 
spin for spin, batting hero Jayant coming on. He’s round the wicket and slower 
than Ashwin, and almost gets his man straight away, appealing for a catch at 
forward short leg. Umpire Erasmus is having none of it though, and India spend 
so much time deliberating that they run out of time to review. Which is just as 
well as it hadn’t hit the bat. Root picks up four – and his 1,000th run against 
India – by pulling a short ball backward of square to the boundary. An eventful 
over ends with another appeal, this one for lbw, and this oneis reviewed. It 
turned a fraction back into the batsman and looked good for line but was going 
over the top.
 
30th over: England 116-3 (Root 63, Bairstow 20) Jadeja sends his trademark 
sharp turner past Bairstow’s stranded bat, but the Yorkshireman responds with a 
well played late cut for a single. Two more singles keep the strike rotating, 
before an astutely judged square cut gives Root two more. England are rattling 
along at almost four an over here, which is an achievement of sorts, and almost 
certainly the only approach to take.
 
29th over: England 111-3 (Root 63, Bairstow 20) Bairstow cuts a shorter ball 
in front of square for a single off Ashwin, who continues to come in from round 
the wicket. Root plays a rasher shot, missing a sweep that loops up off his pad 
just over the man at short leg. It’s good pressure from Ashwin though, although 
Bairstow responds well with a neat late flick for a single. Another risky shot 
follows – a reverse sweep from Root – which bounces before reaching the man at 
backward point.
 
28th over: England 108-3 (Root 63, Bairstow 18) The 21st consecutive over of 
spin: Bairstow pushes Jadeja off the back foot towards mid-on for a single, and 
Root adds another. This is good strike rotation from England as the ones 
continue. A minor-key triumph for Root is that Jadeja no longer has any close 
catchers in front of the wicket in for him.
 
27th over: England 105-3 (Root 62, Bairstow 16) Intelligent from Bairstow, who 
scoffs at Root’s request for a quick single and sends him back. But Ashwin’s 
looking a lot more dangerous from round the wicket and even the well-set Root 
misreads a couple. A maiden.
 
26th over: England 105-3 (Root 62, Bairstow 16) The hundred comes up with a 
nudge round the corner from Bairstow, but Jadeja continues to menace, beating 
Root’s forward prod with another ripper. Root responds with yet another 
front-foot sweep: once more, it’s four. And he keeps the strike with a single 
off the last ball.
 
25th over: England 99-3 (Root 57, Bairstow 15) Root pulls a shorter Ashwin 
ball in front of square on the legside for one. The bowler then changes tack, 
going round the wicket at Bairstow, and he should have been rewarded for it, as 
Bairstow’s rash reverse sweep isdropped by the sainted holy Kohli at slip. This 
new angle of attack has asked new questions of Bairstow but he sees it out and 
then takes a quick single with an on-drive that brings up the kind of quick 50 
partnership that looked utterly beyond England at tea.
 
24th over: England 97-3 (Root 56, Bairstow 14) Bairstow’s looking more 
confident in going forward to Jadeja now, but it’s in going back, square 
cutting a shorter ball off the back foot, that he gets a bottom-edged four. Two 
slips and a silly point stay in place, and Bairstow takes a risk with an uppish 
drive off a more flighted delivery that just falls short of mid-off. This is a 
good contest at the moment.
 
23rd over: England 93-3 (Root 56, Bairstow 10) Bairstow sweeps emphatically at 
Ashwin and picks up one, rather than four, thanks to Nair’s fine fielding in 
the deep. Root then brings up a really very accomplished 50 with a bold reverse 
sweep. That said, if he doesn’t convert this, England are even more doomed than 
they already are. He continues to attack though, and gets forward to drive 
through the offside for four more before a slightly more tenative prod round 
the corner brings a single. Bairstow then rounds off an expensive over with a 
sweep for another one.
 
22nd over: England 82-3 (Root 47, Bairstow 8) Bairstow, showing signs of 
settling (dare I say it?), clips Jadeja neatly away on the legside and gets 
three as it’s just about cut off on the boundary before Root plays his 
trademark shot of this innings – an assertive front-foot sweep in front of 
square – and gets four more.
 
21st over: England 75-3 (Root 43, Bairstow 5) I shouldn’t have said Bairstow 
looked more comfortable against Ashwin than Jadeja, as he’s almost bowled 
shouldering arms at one that bounces back in at his raised glove and nearly 
bounces onto the stumps. A swept single follows before an umpire’s referral for 
a stumping against Root, but he’s kept his back foot grounded. Root then rocks 
back and plays a well judged square cut for two. Well read.
 
20th over: England 72-3 (Root 41, Bairstow 4) Bairstow pushes a shorter Jadeja 
ball square on the legside for a single, before it’s Root’s turn to be 
bamboozled by the left-armer, who rips two consecutive leg-breaks sharply past 
his outside edge. Too good for the batsmen and, at times, the keeper, this 
stuff. Some commentary box chatter about how much better England were here four 
years ago with Swann and Panesar in the lineup, though that rather ignores how 
India have evolved into a much tighter, more focused Test-match side in the 
same period.
 
19th over: England 71-3 (Root 41, Bairstow 3) Root takes a single, giving 
Bairstow a chance to acclimatise himself against Ashwin, a task for which he 
looks slightly more comfortable, neatly clipping a single away on the legside. 
Two from the over.

Even the stats nerds are trying to jinx England:

18th over: England 69-3 (Root 40, Bairstow 2) Jadeja mercilessly teases 
Bairstow with two more beauties, jagged away past an outstretched bat, 
prompting Bairstow to then take a risk with an uppish drive that bounces just 
agonisingly short of the fielder at extra-cover. He survives the over though. 
Which is about all he can do at the moment.
 
17th over: England 69-3 (Root 40, Bairstow 2) A missed half-chance for Patel? 
Bairstow bottom edges off his glove and the keeper can’t grab it, but India can 
afford to be sanguine about missed half-chances, while England will have 
sleepless nights about theirs. He adds a single before Root sweeps aggressively 
again, hoiking towards deep midwicket for four. Given the persistent men around 
the bat that’s intelligent as well as assertive cricket from Root.

“Cook should have stood down in 2014 after the 5-0 farce down under,” thunders 
Dave Adams. “He only survived then due to the paucity of alternatives and his 
own refusal to do the decent thing. Nearly three years on, I don’t see a viable 
captain in the current squad, unless we want to ruin our best batsman. That’s a 
terrible reason to persist with the status quo though. Cook looks like he’s had 
enough - needs to be put out of his misery, much like England in this match.” 
Overlooking a decent period of refreshed positive cricket in summer 2015 and 
early 2016 there, Dave. Now, mind, they do look tired in every sense.
 
16th over: England 64-3 (Root 36, Bairstow 1) A single and four more byes as 
Jadeja continues to tease, torment and tantalise, and Bairstow finally gets off 
the mark, again driving perilously uppishly, at a turning ball on the offside. 
Root looks rather more settled and sweeps emphatically across the line for 
four, but he read it well.
 
15th over: England 54-3 (Root 30, Bairstow 0) Root meets Ashwin on the full 
again and bunts towards mid-off for a single, then Bairstow flirts with, nay 
snogs passionately, danger as he dabs defensively into his own thigh and it 
comes agonisingly close to bouncing back onto the stumps. He then misses 
completely one that bounces back in at him, as does Patel behind the stumps, 
and it’s four byes. Ashwin utterly on top of the new batsman here.
 
14th over: England 49-3 (Root 30, Bairstow 0) Can England’s right-handers dig 
them out of this somehow, now the lefties have gone? Jadeja, who’s bowled at 
least as well as Ashwin in this match, continues to find challenging turn and 
accuracy, as well as that crucial pace, and Bairstow’s first four deliveries 
consist of three play-and-misses and one defensive shot. They’re all dots, 
natch.
 
The players are on their way back out for the next episode of this 1993 
tribute match.
 
Some teatime musings: is this the longest sequence of consecutive Tests 
against Asian opposition England have had? By the end of this series, it will 
be 14, starting with Sri Lanka back at the start of the English summer. 
Alarmingly, the standard of performance has been on a downward trajectory, 
although facing India in Mumbai in December is a very different kettle of 
coconuts from Sri Lanka in Durham in May. On that theme, Chris Bates writes in 
from inside the Wankhede Stadium: “It was a great knock by Kohli. Some wags 
amongst the England fans have been sending texts to some sponsor’s app which 
appear on the big screen. Best so far was probably ‘Kohli may be one of the 
best batsman of all time but could he do it on a cold Tuesday night in Stoke. 
Tony Pulis.’ Having fun despite the carnage.”
 
13.2 overs: England 49-3 (Root 30) “I bet Moeen goes early,” I just mused to 
myself. And he does, slightly misjudging the bounce and nudging behind to Vijay 
at leg-slip. It brings the session to a close, as tea is called. This one will 
be over today now.

“I saw a feature recently 
<http://%20http//www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/testy-memories-the-three-most-important-wickets-in-cricket-history/news-story/089be7f4a9ea5bf75b129b439386c0d2>
 which worked out the most important wicket ever in test cricket in terms of 
consequences,” writes Peter Salmon. “Rashid might be a chance for most 
important drop, as obviously Cook will now resign, Root get the captaincy too 
early and see his career fall to pieces, followed by Stokes as captain for an 
Ashes hammering, and England down to sixth in the rankings? Can’t see another 
scenario at this point.”

On that cheery thought, I’ll nip out for a coffee. See you in a bit.
 
And another! Mooen tentatively prods Jadeja round the corner, Vijay dives low 
to his right and claims a fine catch.
 
13th over: England 49-2 (Root 30, Moeen 0) Root continues to play with 
assertive intent: he gets forward and flicks Ashwin down to fine leg for two 
but then faces an appeal for a catch after one loops up to the keeper off his 
pads.Kohli reviews, but there’s nothing remotely like an inside-edge, and not 
much of an lbw shout either, and the batsman survives. He celebrates the 
reprieve by driving a fuller delivery before it bounces through the covers for 
four.
 
12th over: England 43-2 (Root 24, Moeen 0) A nice, spin-smothering clip from 
Cook off Jadeja brings him a classy four. But then he’s gone! Flummoxed by the 
left-armer again, who drags him across his stumps, pins him in front with a 
quicker ball and claims him as his 100th Test scalp, and prompts a noisy crowd 
to chant his name and honk horns.

“A mention of the Bombay Stores in the 7th over,” writes  the Bombay Stores PR 
department John Starbuck, “leads me to recommend the Bradford version 
www.bombaystores.co.uk <http://www.bombaystores.co.uk/> where you can buy lots 
of colourful clothing gifts for the women and men in your life. Everything’s 
turning Indian now.” This match and series certainly has now, for good.
 
Is Cook out lbw here? Yes he is. He misses one that’s speared into him. The 
finger goes up, Cook sends it upstairs, but Spin vision and ball-tracking 
confirm he’s a goner.
 
11th over: England 39-1 (Cook 14, Root 24) Root and Cook take a single each 
off Ashwin. Then … a big appeal, as Ashwin brings one in sharply at Root and it 
bounces off his pad into the arms of short leg but it had missed his bat by a 
fair bit. He then pulls a shorter ball firmly for one, and Cook completes 
another to keep the scoreboard ticking over in vain pursuit of safety/dignity.
