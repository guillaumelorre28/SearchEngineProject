The first four pressings of the LP were all in possession of the Beatles. It 
was assumed that No 0000001 belonged toJohn Lennon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/johnlennon>, who Paul McCartney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/09/paul-mccartney-discusses-his-relationship-with-john-lennon-video>
 once said “shouted loudest” for it. But it turns out the drummer has had the 
record all along, and kept it locked away in a London bank vault for more than 
35 years.

Bidding on the record starts at $20,000 (£13,276), but it is estimated to 
fetch up to $60,000. CopyNo 0000005 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/25/beatles-white-album> of the 
album sold at an auction in 2008 for around $30,000.

Starr is also auctioning off many items of jewellery, as well as art, clothes 
and instruments, includingGeorge Harrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/georgeharrison>’s Gretsch Tennessean guitar, 
which is expected to fetch up to $200,000.

Other items, which together take up 55 pages of the auction house’s website 
<http://www.julienslive.com/view-auctions/catalog/id/163/>, include a Roy 
Lichtenstein painting, expected to fetch up to $25,000, and the suit Starr wore 
in the 1964 filmA Hard Day’s Night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-hard-day-s-night>, expected to fetch up to 
$20,000.

the highest prices ever for rock’n’roll memorabilia.

Christie’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/06/bob-dylan-electric-guitar-fender-stratocaster-auction-christies>

the 1965 Newport folk festival, where he shocked folk traditionalists with a 
set of rock songs.

According to Guinness World Records, a Fender Stratocaster sold for a record 
$2.7m at a 2005 charity event in Qatar. The instrument had been signed by Keith 
Richards, Eric Clapton andPaul McCartney
