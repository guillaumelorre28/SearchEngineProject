Jonathan Trott hit 118 off 135 balls as Warwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> posted 283 for six and with 
rain affecting Yorkshire’s innings they never looked like threatening, although 
another 22 runs would have seen them secure a home draw in the next round.

Northamptonshire topped the North Group with Warwickshire second, Yorkshire 
third andWorcestershire claiming fourth after a nine-wicket Duckworth-Lewis 
victory overNottinghamshire at Trent Bridge.

An unbroken second-wicket stand of 130 in 23.3 overs clinched it for the 
visitors as Tom Fell (63no) and Daryl Mitchell (61no) were going well at 138 
for one after 24 overs when rain prevented further play.

Riki Wessels, Samit Patel and Dan Christian all scored half-centuries as the 
hosts scored 284 for eight batting first.

Just seven overs were possible at Old Trafford where the rain-affected draw 
betweenLancashire and Durham cost the visitors a chance of making the last 
eight.

Leicestershire faced only two balls of their reply to hosts Derbyshire’s 260 
for six - in which Neil Broom hit 90 - before the weather prevented any further 
play.

The rain ruined Jason Roy’s chance of a century and dented Surrey’s ambitions 
of quarter-final qualification in the South Group after their match at home to
Glamorganwas abandoned with the England opener 93no off 67 balls and the total 
on 157 for one off 19 overs.
