Every healthcare career has landmark moments, whether it’s delivering your 
first baby, losing a patient in shocking circumstances or being assaulted by 
someone in A&E.


The Guardian’s Healthcare Professionals Network is going to launch a series, 
Blood, sweat and tears 
<https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/series/blood-sweat-and-tears>, 
featuring your accounts of the moments that have been joyous, life-changing, 
difficult or just plain awful.

Is there an incident that has shaped how you carry out your job now? Or has 
there been one patient who changed your view on something, or who was difficult 
to treat for whatever reason? Have you had an encounter with a colleague that 
has stayed with you? Or maybe there was a seemingly mundane incident that 
brought home why you went into the sector and what keeps you there.

We don’t just want to hear from clinicians; whatever your role we’d like to 
read about your most memorable day. If you work as a manager or in an 
administration position, share your stories about how your job enables the 
health service to run.


Everyone’s got a story to tell – so what’s yours? If you decide you’d like 
people to know about a standout moment in your job in healthcare, send a brief 
email outlining what you’d like to write about to sarah.johnson@theguardian.com.

If we like your idea, we’ll get back to you with suggestions and then you can 
go ahead and write. Remember, the piece can be anonymous or written under a 
pseudonym.

Here are some tips for a successful piece:

• It should be around 700 words.
• It should adopt an informal but not overly colloquial style.
• Put some work into your opening paragraph – is it engaging and does it 
describe an unusual experience?
• Think about how your piece might draw the reader in and keep them reading 
until the end. If you get bored reading it, so will everyone else.
• Keep it personal.
• Avoid standing on a soapbox, sounding too emotional and banging on about 
something.
• Avoid jargon and acronyms.
