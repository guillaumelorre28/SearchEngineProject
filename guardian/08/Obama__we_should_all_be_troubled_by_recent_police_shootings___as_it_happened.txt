Today in Campaign 2016
 FBI Director James Comey. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock 
 * FBI director James Comey angrily defended his impartiality before lawmakers 
after explaining why he chose not to prosecute an “unsophisticated”Hillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>. During nearly 
five hours of nonstop grilling by the oversight committee of theHouse of 
Representatives <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives>, 
Comey insisted that recommending charges in the case would have been “celebrity 
hunting” because normally prosecutors require evidence of intent in such cases, 
despite what was possibly unlawful handling of classified emails. 
 * Under the 1917 Espionage Act there is a provision for bringing charges for 
gross negligence without evidence of an intentional breach of the law, he said, 
but only one much more serious case has ever been brought using it. “You know 
what would be a double standard? If she were prosecuted for gross negligence,” 
said Comey. “No reasonable prosecutor would bring the second case in 100 years 
based on gross negligence.”

 * Republican opponents of Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in Congress described 
meetings with the presumptive GOP nominee as awkward and sparred with him, 
while Trump’s supporters raved about his visit to Capitol Hill.

 * South Carolina Rep Mark Sanford mocked Trump afterward for referencing 
Article XII of the Constitution in response to a question about Article I, 
which delineates Congress’s powers. There are only seven articles in the 
Constitution.

 * Texas senator and suspended presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who claimed 
559 delegates in the primary season and who enjoys the loyalty of many more 
delegates bound at first to vote for Donald Trump, has accepted an offer from 
Trump to speak at the Republican convention later this month.

 * Speaking in Warsaw, Poland, President Barack Obama commented on the recent 
shooting deaths of two black men who were killed by police. “We have seen 
tragedies like this too many times,” Obama said. “And that hurts. And that 
should trouble all of us. This is not just a black issue, it’s not just a 
Hispanic issue - this is an American issue, that we should all care about. All 
fair-minded people should be concerned.”

Former House speaker New Gingrich told Fox News this evening that he would 
feel “compelled” to serve as Donald Trump’s running mate if the presumptive 
Republican presidential nominee asks him to take on the roll.

Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. Photograph: Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters 
“If Trump offers the position and is serious about it, which I think he would 
be after our conversations, [my wife] Callista and I would feel compelled to 
serve the country,” Gingrich told Fox News’ On the Record with Greta Van 
Susteren.

“I think that we are at a crossroads in American history, frankly captured in 
part by what happened over the last few days. We’re either going to clean up 
Washington or Washington is going to corrupt the whole country.”

The state department is reopening an internal investigation of possible 
mishandling of classified information byHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and top aides.

Spokesman John Kirby says the emails probe is restarting now that the 
Department of Justice isn’t pursuing a criminal prosecution. The Department of 
State suspended its review in April to avoid interfering withthe FBI’s inquiry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton-email-investigation-no-charges-loretta-lynch>
.

Kirby set no deadline for the investigation’s completion.

Clinton was secretary of state until early 2013. Most of her top advisers left 
shortly thereafter. But Kirby said this week former officials can still face 
“administrative sanctions”. The most serious is loss of security clearances, 
which could complicate Clinton’s naming of a national security team if she 
becomes president.

Beyond the Democratic frontrunner, the probe is most likely examining 
confidants Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan and Huma Abedin.

The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs has more on Donald Trump’s meeting with 
congressional Republicans:

Some House members left the private meetings giving a highly positive account 
of Trump’s comments. Rep Ralph Abraham of Louisiana said his party’s nominee 
talked about “growth, security and prosperity, all the good things” while 
fellow Louisiana congressman and Senate candidate John Fleming said there was 
“a lot of positive energy” and “the entire conference was uniting behind Donald 
Trump”.

In his remarks, Trump reportedly addressed a number of policy issues while 
also harping on what he felt wasunfair media criticism over his praise for 
Saddam Hussein killing terrorists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/donald-trump-antisemitic-clinton-tweet-saddam-hussein-praise>
 in recent days. His grievances were shared by many in the room. Rep Trent 
Franks of Arizona, a self-described “former critic” of Trump complained to 
reporters afterwards that “you missed all the ugly things he said about Saddam 
Hussein but if he says he [Saddam] kills terrorists he’s in love with Saddam 
Hussein. Of all the stupidity and misappropriation of the truth.”

Although Trump received multiple standing ovations, he may not have been the 
most popular member of his family in the room. When Rep Peter King of New York 
said members had their choice who to take a picture with, they flocked towards 
Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. “She’s the star,” King said.

But there were also critics in the room. South Carolina Rep Mark Sanford 
mocked Trump afterward for referencing article XII of the Constitution in 
response to a question about article I, which delineates Congress’s powers. 
There are only seven articles in the Constitution.

President Obama on shootings: 'How would you feel?'

“We have seen tragedies like this too many times,” President Barack Obama 
begins, after landing in Warsaw, Poland. “The Justice Department, I know, has 
opened a civil-rights investigation in Baton Rouge. The governor of Minnesota, 
I understand, is calling for an investigation as well.”

Though Obama says that he cannot comment on the specifics of either case, 
“what I can say is that all of us as Americans should be troubled by these 
shootings, because these are not isolated incidents. They’re symptomatic of a 
broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system.”

“Last year,” Obama continues, “African Americans were shot by police at more 
than twice the rate of whites. African Americans are arrested at twice the rate 
of whites; African Americans defendants are 75% more likely to be charged with 
offenses commanding mandatory minimums.”

“If you add it all up, the African American and Hispanic pop, who make up only 
30% of the general population, make up half of the incarcerated population,” 
Obama says.

“Now, these are facts, and when incidents like this occur, there’s a big chunk 
of our fellow citizens that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, 
they are not being treated the same,” Obama continues. “And that hurts. And 
that should trouble all of us. This is not just a black issue, it’s not just a 
Hispanic issue - this is an American issue, that we should all care about. All 
fair-minded people should be concerned.”

Obama declares that building trust between minority communities and law 
enforcement agencies would benefit both groups.

“Ultimately, if you can rebuild trust between communities and the police 
departments that serve them, that helps us solve crime problems,” Obama says. 
“That will make life easier for police officers. They will have more 
cooperation. They will be safer. They will be more likely to come home. So it 
will be good for crimefighting, and it will avert tragedy.”

“There are people of goodwill on the Republican side and the Democratic side 
who want to get something done here - that too would provide greater assurance 
for people across the country that those in positions of power are willing to 
take action,” Obama says, after acknowledging that Congress is “generally” 
having problems passing legislation.

Obama emphasizes that concern regarding the deaths of minority civilians at 
the hands of law enforcement is not inherently a critique of law enforcement 
officers. “To be concerned about these issues is not to be against law 
enforcement,” Obama says. “There are times when these incidents occur, and you 
see protests and you see vigils, and I get letters, well-meaning letters 
sometimes, from law enforcement officers saying, ‘How come we’re under attack? 
How come not as much emphasis is made when police officers are shot?’” 
Addressing those officers, Obama says that “we know you have a tough job. We 
mourn those in uniform who are protecting us who lose their lives. On a regular 
basis, I have joined with families in front of Capitol Hill to commemorate the 
incredible heroism that they’ve displayed. I’ve hugged family members who’ve 
lose loved ones doing the right thing. I know how much it hurts.”

Obama says that there is “no contradiction” between supporting police 
departments and law enforcement agencies and “also saying that there are 
problems across our criminal justice system - there are biases, conscious and 
unconscious - that have to be rooted out.”

“I repeat: If communities are mistrustful of the police, that makes those law 
enforcement officers who are doing a great job,” Obama says, “it makes those 
jobs harder.”

“The data shows black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents,” 
Obama continues. “This isn’t a matter of us comparing the value of lives - this 
is recognizing that there is a particular burden that is being placed on a 
group of our fellow citizens, and we should care about that. We can’t dismiss 
it. We can’t dismiss it.”

“I actually, genuinely, truly believe that the vast majority of American 
people see this as a problem we should all care about,” Obama concludes. “And I 
would just ask those who question the sincerity or the legitimacy of protests 
and vigils and expressions of outrage who somehow label those expressions of 
outrage as quote-unquote ‘political correctness,’ I just ask folks to step back 
and think, what would happen if this happened to someone in your family? How 
would you feel?”

“To be concerned about these issues is not political correctness - it’s just 
being an American, and wanting to live up to our best and highest ideals, and 
to recognize that we have some tough history and we haven’t gotten though all 
of that history yet.”

An event in Moscow promised to be a rare opportunity to get inside Donald Trump
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>’s foreign policy thinking, 
as one of his advisers arrived in Russia to give a speech on the grand-sounding 
topic of the “future of the world economy”.

In the end, however, Carter Page offered little except confusion and the 
occasional snigger, during a rambling presentation and an evasive 
question-and-answer session.

Page, an investment banker who previously worked in Russia, insisted he was in
Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> on a private visit, although 
he is likely to meet Russian officials when he gives the commencement speech at 
the New Economic School in Moscow on Friday. He refused to comment on whether 
he had any meetings with officials planned.

That was not the only thing he refused to comment on.

Would he advise Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
to remove sanctions on Russia? “I’m not here at all talking about my work 
outside of my academic endeavours. It’s not appropriate time to speak about 
that.” How could relations between Russia and the west be improved? “There’s a 
time and a place to have all discussions, today is not the time and place.”

The question and answer portion of the event at times descended into farce, as 
he even refused to answer the question on whether he was a “good person”, 
saying “I don’t really have any comments on that at this stage”.

Trump's foreign policy adviser will talk about his foreign policy – just not 
today

Leaked remarks from Donald Trump’s closed-door session with congressional 
Republican earlier today seem to indicate that the presumptive presidential 
nominee’s primary goal in meeting with the nearly 200 legislators was to 
convince them to “say great things” about him.

According to the Washington Post, which obtained a detailed summary of the 
hour-long meeting, Trump pressured congressional Republicans to tell anyone who 
would listen that the party is well and truly unified.

“It would great if you could say we had an unbelievable meeting. ‘Trump loves 
us. We love Trump.’ It’s going to be so good. Okay?” Trump reportedly said. 
“Honestly, if we could say it is great, we have a unified party, I’ll tell you 
what, you are going to see a difference immediately. That’s what I’m going to 
say.”

“If when we leave we could just go out and say, ‘We love Trump, he’s going to 
be great.’ I love you, we’re doing great. As a team, we can’t be beaten,” Trump 
continued. “Say great things, because anything you say that’s even a little - 
well you know, they magnify it. Just say it’s great. You gotta say great 
things. Any little negativity that you have, they are going to blow it up 
twentyfold. You’ve got to be positive.”


Trump also said that, if all else failed, Republicans should lie back and 
think of the supreme court.

“Even for the people who don’t like me . . . if you don’t think about anything 
else, think about the United States Supreme Court,” Trump said.

Report: Donald Trump 'unlikely' to select Chris Christie as running mate

In news that will likely send a few half-empty crystal tumblers flying at 
Drumthwacket <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drumthwacket>, the New Jersey 
Star-Ledger is reporting 
<http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/07/trump_insiders_say_christie_vp_vetting_just_for_sh.html#incart_river_index>
 that New Jersey governor Chris Christie is “unlikely” to be selected as 
presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s running mate.

Cardenas/AFP/Getty Images 
Citing two sources close to the Trump campaign, The Star-Ledger reports that 
former House speaker Newt Gingrich is the “likely” choice, although one 
included a caveat: “It’s Trump - I doubt anyone really fully knows what he’s 
going to do.”

The only reason Christie has been vetted for the position at all, one source 
told the Star-Ledger, is that “it would be embarrassing not to be vetted,.”

Christie, who is term-limited as governor, was one of the first major 
Republicans to come out in support of Trump’s candidacy, in remarks that were 
overshadowed by speculation on social media channels that the New Jersey 
governorwas being held hostage

Illinois senator Mark Kirk has lashed out at fellow Republican Donald Trump in 
response to the presumptive presidential nomineecalling him a loser 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/07/07/trump-meets-with-hill-republicans-as-controversy-over-star-of-david-tweet-continues/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_trump-caphill-1035am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory>
 in a closed-door meeting with congressional Republicans.

“I guess the bully side of him,” Kirk, who is locked in a tight battle for 
reelection against Representative Tammy Duckworth,told the Associated Press 
<http://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/kirk-trump-is-a-privileged-bully/>. “We 
haven’t seen a personality like his too much in the Midwest: Eastern, 
privileged, wealthy bully. Our bullies are made of better stuff in Illinois. 
We’re much more practical and polite.”

Kirk, who is widely considered the most vulnerable of sitting Republican 
senators up for reelection this year, announced thathe would not support Trump 
<https://kirkforsenate.com/news/senator-kirk-statement-presidential-race/> for 
president in June after Trump alleged that an American-born federal judge of 
Mexican descent could not impartially preside over a multi-state fraud suit 
against Trump University.

“I have spent my life building bridges and tearing down barriers - not 
building walls,” Kirk said. “Donald Trump’s latest statements, in context with 
past attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me, make it certain that 
I cannot and will not support my party’s nominee for President regardless of 
the political impact on my candidacy or the Republican Party.”

Warning: Confusing Acronym Alert
 Donald Trump. Photograph: John Minchillo/AP 
A group calling itself “LGBTrump” has endorsed Donald Trump’s backtracking on 
North Carolina’s so-called “bathroom bill” that criminalizes the use of 
bathrooms that comport with the stated gender identities of transgender people
in a Breitbart News editorial 
<http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/07/donald-trumps-support-for-n-c-bathroom-law-is-pro-everybody/>
 - but it’s not entirely clear which group using that name is doing the 
endorsing.

Joseph Murray, described in the Breitbart byline as the administrator for 
LGBTrump, wrote in the conservative outlet that the fight for transgender 
equality “is not the same fight of gays and lesbians for equal legal status of 
their same-sex relations,” and that efforts on behalf of mainstream LGBT 
organizations to fight North Carolina’s law are being fought to keep gays and 
lesbians “away from the center of American life.”

Trump, Murray contended, “treats gays and lesbians as just normal Americans, 
who worry about jobs and schools and crime and neighborhood traffic and trade 
and wages. Just the routine, everyday stuff of Americans’ society.”

But Murray’s group <https://www.facebook.com/LGBTrump/> is one of two 
pro-Trump LGBT organizations with the same name -the other 
<https://www.facebook.com/lgbtrump2016/>, created by GOProud founder and former 
Log Cabin Republican Christopher R. Barron, has not mentioned North Carolina’s 
bill.

Trump has been proactive about reaching out to gay and lesbian voters, 
particularly after a mass shooting at an Orlando gay club last month that left 
49 people dead, but reversed his previous condemnation of the North Carolina law
in an interview 
<http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article87877837.html>
 with the Raleigh News & Observer.

Update: Chris Barron, of the non-Murray LGBTrump group, told the Guardian that 
“There is no connection between the two groups. Frankly, I didn’t know his 
Facebook group existed when we launched ours a couple of weeks ago.”

As for his group’s reaction to Trump’s backtracking on North Carolina’s bill, 
Barron called the issue “a distraction.”

“In the wake of Orlando, the reality is that this election shouldn’t be about 
bathrooms or who will bake our wedding cakes - it’s literally a matter of life 
or death for LGBT Americans,” Barron said. “We are being targeted by a global 
movement in the form of radical Islam that seeks to exterminate LGBT people.”

Bernie Sanders' campaign releases 12 platform priorities

The indefatigable campaign of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is still tilting 
at windmills, releasing a list this afternoon of 12 “priority amendments” to 
the largely symbolic Democratic party platform.

The draft of the proposed platform 
<https://demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016-DEMOCRATIC-PARTY-PLATFORM-DRAFT-7.1.16.pdf>
, released last Friday afternoon, is likely the most progressive in the party’s 
modern history, with a proposed $15 national minimum wage, repeal of theHyde 
Amendment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/03/hyde-amendment-abortion-gop-women>
 and breaking up large financial institutions all on the table, but Sanders’ 
campaign apparently has at least a dozen more demands before he officially 
throws in the towel:

 * Trans-Pacific Partnership: The proposed amendment demands that the trade

The state department is reopening an internal investigation of possible 
mishandling of classified information byHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and top aides.

Spokesman John Kirby says the emails probe is restarting now that the 
Department of Justice isn’t pursuing a criminal prosecution. The Department of 
State suspended its review in April to avoid interfering withthe FBI’s inquiry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton-email-investigation-no-charges-loretta-lynch>
.

Kirby set no deadline for the investigation’s completion.

Clinton was secretary of state until early 2013. Most of her top advisers left 
shortly thereafter. But Kirby said this week former officials can still face 
“administrative sanctions”. The most serious is loss of security clearances, 
which could complicate Clinton’s naming of a national security team if she 
becomes president.

Beyond the Democratic frontrunner, the probe is most likely examining 
confidants Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan and Huma Abedin.

The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs has more on Donald Trump’s meeting with 
congressional Republicans:

Some House members left the private meetings giving a highly positive account 
of Trump’s comments. Rep Ralph Abraham of Louisiana said his party’s nominee 
talked about “growth, security and prosperity, all the good things” while 
fellow Louisiana congressman and Senate candidate John Fleming said there was 
“a lot of positive energy” and “the entire conference was uniting behind Donald 
Trump”.

In his remarks, Trump reportedly addressed a number of policy issues while 
also harping on what he felt wasunfair media criticism over his praise for 
Saddam Hussein killing terrorists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/donald-trump-antisemitic-clinton-tweet-saddam-hussein-praise>
 in recent days. His grievances were shared by many in the room. Rep Trent 
Franks of Arizona, a self-described “former critic” of Trump complained to 
reporters afterwards that “you missed all the ugly things he said about Saddam 
Hussein but if he says he [Saddam] kills terrorists he’s in love with Saddam 
Hussein. Of all the stupidity and misappropriation of the truth.”

Although Trump received multiple standing ovations, he may not have been the 
most popular member of his family in the room. When Rep Peter King of New York 
said members had their choice who to take a picture with, they flocked towards 
Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. “She’s the star,” King said.

But there were also critics in the room. South Carolina Rep Mark Sanford 
mocked Trump afterward for referencing article XII of the Constitution in 
response to a question about article I, which delineates Congress’s powers. 
There are only seven articles in the Constitution.

Trump's meeting with congressional Republicans inspires divided response

“We have seen tragedies like this too many times,” President Barack Obama 
begins, after landing in Warsaw, Poland. “The Justice Department, I know, has 
opened a civil-rights investigation in Baton Rouge. The governor of Minnesota, 
I understand, is calling for an investigation as well.”

Though Obama says that he cannot comment on the specifics of either case, 
“what I can say is that all of us as Americans should be troubled by these 
shootings, because these are not isolated incidents. They’re symptomatic of a 
broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system.”

“Last year,” Obama continues, “African Americans were shot by police at more 
than twice the rate of whites. African Americans are arrested at twice the rate 
of whites; African Americans defendants are 75% more likely to be charged with 
offenses commanding mandatory minimums.”

“If you add it all up, the African American and Hispanic pop, who make up only 
30% of the general population, make up half of the incarcerated population,” 
Obama says.

“Now, these are facts, and when incidents like this occur, there’s a big chunk 
of our fellow citizens that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, 
they are not being treated the same,” Obama continues. “And that hurts. And 
that should trouble all of us. This is not just a black issue, it’s not just a 
Hispanic issue - this is an American issue, that we should all care about. All 
fair-minded people should be concerned.”

Obama declares that building trust between minority communities and law 
enforcement agencies would benefit both groups.

“Ultimately, if you can rebuild trust between communities and the police 
departments that serve them, that helps us solve crime problems,” Obama says. 
“That will make life easier for police officers. They will have more 
cooperation. They will be safer. They will be more likely to come home. So it 
will be good for crimefighting, and it will avert tragedy.”

“There are people of goodwill on the Republican side and the Democratic side 
who want to get something done here - that too would provide greater assurance 
for people across the country that those in positions of power are willing to 
take action,” Obama says, after acknowledging that Congress is “generally” 
having problems passing legislation.

Obama emphasizes that concern regarding the deaths of minority civilians at 
the hands of law enforcement is not inherently a critique of law enforcement 
officers. “To be concerned about these issues is not to be against law 
enforcement,” Obama says. “There are times when these incidents occur, and you 
see protests and you see vigils, and I get letters, well-meaning letters 
sometimes, from law enforcement officers saying, ‘How come we’re under attack? 
How come not as much emphasis is made when police officers are shot?’” 
Addressing those officers, Obama says that “we know you have a tough job. We 
mourn those in uniform who are protecting us who lose their lives. On a regular 
basis, I have joined with families in front of Capitol Hill to commemorate the 
incredible heroism that they’ve displayed. I’ve hugged family members who’ve 
lose loved ones doing the right thing. I know how much it hurts.”

Obama says that there is “no contradiction” between supporting police 
departments and law enforcement agencies and “also saying that there are 
problems across our criminal justice system - there are biases, conscious and 
unconscious - that have to be rooted out.”

“I repeat: If communities are mistrustful of the police, that makes those law 
enforcement officers who are doing a great job,” Obama says, “it makes those 
jobs harder.”

“The data shows black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents,” 
Obama continues. “This isn’t a matter of us comparing the value of lives - this 
is recognizing that there is a particular burden that is being placed on a 
group of our fellow citizens, and we should care about that. We can’t dismiss 
it. We can’t dismiss it.”

“I actually, genuinely, truly believe that the vast majority of American 
people see this as a problem we should all care about,” Obama concludes. “And I 
would just ask those who question the sincerity or the legitimacy of protests 
and vigils and expressions of outrage who somehow label those expressions of 
outrage as quote-unquote ‘political correctness,’ I just ask folks to step back 
and think, what would happen if this happened to someone in your family? How 
would you feel?”

“To be concerned about these issues is not political correctness - it’s just 
being an American, and wanting to live up to our best and highest ideals, and 
to recognize that we have some tough history and we haven’t gotten though all 
of that history yet.”
 
After landing in Warsaw, Poland, President Barack Obama is delivering remarks 
regarding the deaths of two black men at the hands of US police officers this 
week:
 
An event in Moscow promised to be a rare opportunity to get inside Donald Trump
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>’s foreign policy thinking, 
as one of his advisers arrived in Russia to give a speech on the grand-sounding 
topic of the “future of the world economy”.

In the end, however, Carter Page offered little except confusion and the 
occasional snigger, during a rambling presentation and an evasive 
question-and-answer session.

Page, an investment banker who previously worked in Russia, insisted he was in
Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> on a private visit, although 
he is likely to meet Russian officials when he gives the commencement speech at 
the New Economic School in Moscow on Friday. He refused to comment on whether 
he had any meetings with officials planned.

That was not the only thing he refused to comment on.

Would he advise Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
to remove sanctions on Russia? “I’m not here at all talking about my work 
outside of my academic endeavours. It’s not appropriate time to speak about 
that.” How could relations between Russia and the west be improved? “There’s a 
time and a place to have all discussions, today is not the time and place.”

The question and answer portion of the event at times descended into farce, as 
he even refused to answer the question on whether he was a “good person”, 
saying “I don’t really have any comments on that at this stage”.

Leaked remarks from Donald Trump’s closed-door session with congressional 
Republican earlier today seem to indicate that the presumptive presidential 
nominee’s primary goal in meeting with the nearly 200 legislators was to 
convince them to “say great things” about him.

According to the Washington Post, which obtained a detailed summary of the 
hour-long meeting, Trump pressured congressional Republicans to tell anyone who 
would listen that the party is well and truly unified.

“It would great if you could say we had an unbelievable meeting. ‘Trump loves 
us. We love Trump.’ It’s going to be so good. Okay?” Trump reportedly said. 
“Honestly, if we could say it is great, we have a unified party, I’ll tell you 
what, you are going to see a difference immediately. That’s what I’m going to 
say.”

“If when we leave we could just go out and say, ‘We love Trump, he’s going to 
be great.’ I love you, we’re doing great. As a team, we can’t be beaten,” Trump 
continued. “Say great things, because anything you say that’s even a little - 
well you know, they magnify it. Just say it’s great. You gotta say great 
things. Any little negativity that you have, they are going to blow it up 
twentyfold. You’ve got to be positive.”


Trump also said that, if all else failed, Republicans should lie back and 
think of the supreme court.

“Even for the people who don’t like me . . . if you don’t think about anything 
else, think about the United States Supreme Court,” Trump said.

 that New Jersey governor Chris Christie is “unlikely” to be selected as 
presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s running mate.

Citing two sources close to the Trump campaign, The Star-Ledger reports that 
former House speaker Newt Gingrich is the “likely” choice, although one 
included a caveat: “It’s Trump - I doubt anyone really fully knows what he’s 
going to do.”

The only reason Christie has been vetted for the position at all, one source 
told the Star-Ledger, is that “it would be embarrassing not to be vetted,.”

Christie, who is term-limited as governor, was one of the first major 
Republicans to come out in support of Trump’s candidacy, in remarks that were 
overshadowed by speculation on social media channels that the New Jersey 
governorwas being held hostage

Illinois senator Mark Kirk has lashed out at fellow Republican Donald Trump in 
response to the presumptive presidential nomineecalling him a loser

 in a closed-door meeting with congressional Republicans.

“I guess the bully side of him,” Kirk, who is locked in a tight battle for 
reelection against Representative Tammy Duckworth,told the Associated Press 
<http://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/kirk-trump-is-a-privileged-bully/>. “We 
haven’t seen a personality like his too much in the Midwest: Eastern, 
privileged, wealthy bully. Our bullies are made of better stuff in Illinois. 
We’re much more practical and polite.”

Kirk, who is widely considered the most vulnerable of sitting Republican 
senators up for reelection this year, announced thathe would not support Trump 
<https://kirkforsenate.com/news/senator-kirk-statement-presidential-race/> for 
president in June after Trump alleged that an American-born federal judge of 
Mexican descent could not impartially preside over a multi-state fraud suit 
against Trump University.

“I have spent my life building bridges and tearing down barriers - not 
building walls,” Kirk said. “Donald Trump’s latest statements, in context with 
past attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me, make it certain that 
I cannot and will not support my party’s nominee for President regardless of 
the political impact on my candidacy or the Republican Party.”

A group calling itself “LGBTrump” has endorsed Donald Trump’s backtracking on 
North Carolina’s so-called “bathroom bill” that criminalizes the use of 
bathrooms that comport with the stated gender identities of transgender people
in a Breitbart News editorial 
<http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/07/donald-trumps-support-for-n-c-bathroom-law-is-pro-everybody/>
 - but it’s not entirely clear which group using that name is doing the 
endorsing.

Joseph Murray, described in the Breitbart byline as the administrator for 
LGBTrump, wrote in the conservative outlet that the fight for transgender 
equality “is not the same fight of gays and lesbians for equal legal status of 
their same-sex relations,” and that efforts on behalf of mainstream LGBT 
organizations to fight North Carolina’s law are being fought to keep gays and 
lesbians “away from the center of American life.”

Trump, Murray contended, “treats gays and lesbians as just normal Americans, 
who worry about jobs and schools and crime and neighborhood traffic and trade 
and wages. Just the routine, everyday stuff of Americans’ society.”

But Murray’s group <https://www.facebook.com/LGBTrump/> is one of two 
pro-Trump LGBT organizations with the same name -the other 
<https://www.facebook.com/lgbtrump2016/>, created by GOProud founder and former 
Log Cabin Republican Christopher R. Barron, has not mentioned North Carolina’s 
bill.

Trump has been proactive about reaching out to gay and lesbian voters, 
particularly after a mass shooting at an Orlando gay club last month that left 
49 people dead, but reversed his previous condemnation of the North Carolina law
in an interview 
<http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article87877837.html>
 with the Raleigh News & Observer.

Update: Chris Barron, of the non-Murray LGBTrump group, told the Guardian that 
“There is no connection between the two groups. Frankly, I didn’t know his 
Facebook group existed when we launched ours a couple of weeks ago.”

As for his group’s reaction to Trump’s backtracking on North Carolina’s bill, 
Barron called the issue “a distraction.”

“In the wake of Orlando, the reality is that this election shouldn’t be about 
bathrooms or who will bake our wedding cakes - it’s literally a matter of life 
or death for LGBT Americans,” Barron said. “We are being targeted by a global 
movement in the form of radical Islam that seeks to exterminate LGBT people.”

 
The indefatigable campaign of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is still tilting 
at windmills, releasing a list this afternoon of 12 “priority amendments” to 
the largely symbolic Democratic party platform.

The draft of the proposed platform 
<https://demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016-DEMOCRATIC-PARTY-PLATFORM-DRAFT-7.1.16.pdf>
, released last Friday afternoon, is likely the most progressive in the party’s 
modern history, with a proposed $15 national minimum wage, repeal of theHyde 
Amendment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/03/hyde-amendment-abortion-gop-women>
 and breaking up large financial institutions all on the table, but Sanders’ 
campaign apparently has at least a dozen more demands before he officially 
throws in the towel:

 * Trans-Pacific Partnership: The proposed amendment demands that the trade 
agreement “must not get a vote in this Congress or in future sessions of 
Congress.” 
 * Minimum wage: A strengthening of existing language to reaffirm the party’s 
belief in a $15 minimum wage. 
 * Fracking: A national ban on the use of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” 
to extract natural gas. 
 * Paid family leave: A proposal creating a national insurance fund run by the 
government to guarantee paid family leave, striking the current proposal to 
mandate paid family leave paid by employers. 
 * Pension cuts: A strengthening of existing language to prevent cuts to paid 
pension benefits. 
 * Criminal justice reform: A strengthening of existing proposals regarding 
police body cameras, racial profiling and a proposal to mandate investigation 
by the Department of Justice into police shootings.

 * Immigration: A proposal to end deportation programs that promote racial 
profiling and make sure that DREAMers are eligible to serve in the uniformed 
services. 
 * Fracking: Including anti-fracking language into alternative-energy 
proposals. 
 * Keystone Pipeline: Encouraging the use of environmental impact studies 
relating to climate change when weighing similar projects. 
 * Fossil fuels: Strengthening language regarding phasing out the use of 
traditional fuels. 
 * Nuclear weapons spending: A proposal to reduce spending on the US nuclear 
arsenal by at least $100 billion over the next decade.
