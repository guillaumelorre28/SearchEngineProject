GreenWood Forest Park, Wales

Set in the foothills of Snowdonia, this family adventure park offers rides, 
boat trips, magicians, face painting and craft making. Pride of place is the 
Green Dragon Rollercoaster, which uses the gravitational weight of visitors 
plunging downhill to pull the empty funicular cabins uphill. Arrive on foot or 
by bike, and you'll be given a free drink, while local school groups who walk 
to the park are given free entry.

The Deep Aquarium, Hull

The huge aquarium housed in Sir Terry Farrel's innovative glass and aluminium

and educational charity. The centre is divided into more than 30 exhibits, from 
shallow tropical seas to the icy depths of the ocean, and is home to more than 
3,500 fish including rays, octopus and 40 kinds of sharks. Green initiatives

Greenheart, Ibiza

Ibiza's flagship ecology and family education centre is run by volunteers at a 
farm, Casita Verde, a few kilometres northwest of San José. You can leave the 
kids in a supervised play school while you stroll around the centre, learning 
the ins and outs of alternative technologies and how to cultivate plants and 
herbs. If that sounds a tad serious for a holiday, you could just chill out 
with a massage at the natural therapy centre or sit drinking a healthy dose of 
Cassita's own organic carob syrup, looking out over the valley.

only, 2pm-6pm. ¤5, bring ID.
