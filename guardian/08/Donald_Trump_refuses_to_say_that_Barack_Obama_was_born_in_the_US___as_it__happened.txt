Today in Campaign 2016

 * Hillary Clinton returned to the presidential campaign trail today, making a 
confident first public appearance sincepneumonia

 forced her to take a four-day rest. Taking to the stage to the sound of I Feel 
Good by James Brown, the Democratic nominee insisted she was fully recovered 
and filled with a new sense of urgency at a critical juncture in American 
politics. “Being on the trail does not encourage reflection,” she told a young 
crowd at the University ofNorth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina>, Greensboro. “It’s 
important to sit with your thoughts every now and again and this helped me to 
reflect on what this campaign is all about.”

 * Donald Trump told TV host Dr Oz he feels “as good today as I did at 30”, 
the 70-year-old Republican presidential nominee releasedthe most detailed 
assessment yet <https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/DJT_Medical_Records_.pdf> of 
his physical condition. Ina taped interview with Dr Oz 
<http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/09/15/donald-trump-health-dr-oz-sot-nr.cnn/video/playlists/donald-trump-health/>
, Trump admitted that at 236lb he is overweight, but said he had bolstered his 
physical condition by giving speeches on the campaign trail. “It’s a lot of 
work,” he said. “You know, when I’m speaking in front of 15, 20,000 people and 
I’m up there using a lot of motion, I guess in its own way it’s a pretty 
healthy act. “A lot of times these rooms are really hot, like saunas, and I 
guess that’s a form of exercise.”

 * Trump attempted to combat widespread criticism of his sketchy economic 
policies by setting out what he presented as a new vision for the country that 
he audaciously claimed would create 25m new jobs in a decade and put the 
American worker first. 
 * Addressing one of the country’s most august economic debating societies, 
the Economic Club of New York, the Republican presidential nominee sought to 
dispel the criticism that has dogged his campaign that his mathematics do not 
add up in balancing tax cuts and new spending. Sticking closely to a 
pre-prepared script – despite an initial malfunctioning of his teleprompter - 
he delivered a speech that was billed in advance by his senior advisers as the 
culmination of his thinking on how to get America back to work. 
 * “American cars will travel the roads,” he said, “American planes will soar 
the skies, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will send new 
skyscrapers into the clouds, American hands will rebuild this nation, and 
American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation.”

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> was 
quick to cite Trump’s refusal to back away from birtherism as evidence that the 
Republican nominee was fanning the flames of racial division.

Addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute at its annual gala in 
Washington on Thursday evening, Clinton condemned Trump for continuing to push 
conspiracy theories surrounding Obama’s birthplace.

“He still wouldn’t say Hawaii. He still wouldn’t say America,” the Democratic 
presidential nominee said. “This man wants to be our next president? When will 
he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?”

Clinton returned to the campaign trail earlier in the day with a rally in 
Greensboro, North Carolina, marking her first public appearance since she made 
public her diagnosis with pneumonia after abruptly leaving a 9/11 memorial on 
Sunday in New York City.

In her remarks before the gathering of prominent Hispanic leaders, Clinton 
reiterated her support for comprehensive immigration reform while decrying 
Trump’s rhetoric against immigrants and Muslims alike.

“There’s no innuendo or dog whistles anymore,” Clinton said of the Republican 
nominee. “It’s all right out there in the open now.”

“We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a 
message that even he can hear.”

Obama spoke before the group just prior to Clinton and similarly urged the 
Hispanic community to stand up against Trump’s bluster.

“I know that there are a lot of folks who had this notion of what the real 
America looks like and somehow it only includes a few of us,” the president 
said. “But who’s going to decide who the real America is?”

“Folks are betting that if they can drive us far enough apart and if they can 
put down enough of us because of where we come from, or what we look like, or 
what religion we practice then that may pay off at the polls.”

“But I’m telling you that’s a bet they’re going to lose,” he added.

Wisconsin governor Scott Walker broke his silence on Thursday over leaked 
documents obtained by Guardian US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/corporate-cash-john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin>
, which revealed his links to a complex network of conservative donors and the 
influence of corporate cash in the election process.

In an interview with Milwaukee’s WTMJ 620, the Republican governor described 
as “baseless” the legal investigation into alleged campaign finance violations 
that produced the 1,500 pages of documents.


“It’s what we often see in media outlets where you get bits and pieces shaped 
to push their agenda,”Walker said 
<http://www.wtmj.com/shows/charlie-sykes/gov-scott-walker-addresses-john-doe-document-leak>
. “The bottom line is we’ve had several courts in this state that have shut 
this down, this baseless investigation down, because it clearly didn’t show 
that what was done that was not lawful there.”


Known as the “John Doe investigation”, several Wisconsin prosecutors launched 
a probe into what they suspected were criminal campaign finance violations by 
the campaign committee of Walker, a former Republican presidential candidate 
who dropped out early in the primary race. The prosecutors claimed Walker’s 
committee operated a coordinated network that involved outside lobby groups, 
thereby allowing unlimited amounts of corporate money to funnel into a 
third-party group closely aligned with his campaign. In July 2015, theWisconsin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/wisconsin>supreme court halted the 
investigation.


In saying prosecutors misunderstood campaign finance law to pick on people and 
groups “wholly innocent of any wrongdoing”, the state’s high court took the 
extraordinary step to order all documents produced as part of the investigation 
to be destroyed and later held under seal – however at least one set survived 
that was leaked to Guardian US.


Walker told the radio station that unspecified people related to the 
investigation who “lose in the court of law, repeatedly” now “want to play this 
out in the court of public opinion – and do so with only bits and pieces, 
without the full story”.


“The bottom line is that people, not only at the supreme court level, but even 
initially at the circuit court level, where a distinguished reserve judge – 
who, as far as we can tell, has no aligned political allegiance with anyone – 
initially shut this down,” Walker said. “And that assertion’s been held many 
times over.”

Donald Trump refuses to say that President Barack Obama was born in the US

In an interview with the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-defiant-as-polls-rise-wont-say-obama-was-born-in-united-states/2016/09/15/48913162-7b61-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html>
, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump defiantly declared that he will 
not publicly reveal whether he still believes that President Barack Obama was 
born outside of the United States.

“I’ll answer that question at the right time,” Trump said. “I just don’t want 
to answer it yet.”

Trump, asked about his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, declaring that it 
was a settled issue that Obama was born a US citizen, Trump said: “It’s okay. 
She’s allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs. I want to 
focus on other things.”

“I don’t talk about it anymore,” Trump said. “The reason I don’t is because 
then everyone is going to be talking about it as opposed to jobs, the military, 
the vets, security.”

Hillary Clinton returned to the presidential campaign trail this afternoon, 
making a confident first public appearance sincepneumonia

 forced her to take a four-day rest.

Taking to the stage to the sound of I Feel Good by James Brown, the Democratic 
nominee insisted she was fully recovered and filled with a new sense of urgency 
at a critical juncture in American politics

“Being on the trail does not encourage reflection,” she told a young crowd at 
the University ofNorth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina>. “It’s important to sit 
with your thoughts every now and again and this helped me to reflect on what 
this campaign is all about.”

Speaking calmly, without the cough that has interrupted recent appearances, 
the former secretary of state appeared rested. As she climbed the steps to the 
podium, she gripped a guard rail carefully.

“For millions of moms and dads, if they get sick there is no backup, they are 
on their own,” she said, turning her experience into a renewed call for better 
provision of healthcare and family leave. “That’s the story for too many people 
in America.”

Earlier Donald Trump, who has pulled level in some recent opinion polls, made 
his most explicit reference yet to his opponent’s health,releasing medical 
records 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-medical-report>
that boasted of his ability to “endure – uninterrupted – the rigors of a 
punishing and unprecedented presidential campaign”.

The physical examination also revealed the 70-year-old Republican to be 
overweight, at 236lbs, but he claimed he had bolstered his physical condition 
by giving speeches on the campaign trail.

Mark Fields, the CEO of Ford Motor Company and latest target of Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump’s ire, has responded to Trump’s allegations 
that the company will “fire all of its employees in the United States” as it 
moved small-car production to Mexico, calling Trump’s comments “unfortunate” 
and inaccurate.

“It’s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts and the 
facts are Ford’s investment in the US and commitment to American jobs has never 
been strong,” Fields told CNN’s Poppy Harlow this afternoon.

“We have created more than 28,000 jobs in the US in the last five years; we’ve 
invested more than $12b,” Fields continued. “We produce more vehicles in the US 
than any other automaker by far, and we employ more hourly workers here in our 
plants, more than any automaker by far. So we are very committed here and those 
are the facts.”

This morning, Trump told the hosts of Fox and Friends that he will implement a 
35% tariff on Ford cars manufactured in Mexico if he is elected president, 
something that Fields dismissed.


Asked if it was true that Ford would be “firing all of its employees” in the 
United States, Fields was adamant that Trump was wrong.

“Absolutely not - zero,” Ford said. “What we announced is that we’ll be moving 
our focus out of Michigan so that we can compete more financially in that 
particular segment but at the same time, and that’s an agreement we have with 
the UAW and what we’ll be doing is we’ll be replacing those products with two 
very exciting new products so not one job will be lost... most of our 
investment is here in the US and that’s the way it’s gonna continue to be.”

Whoever wins the election, Ford concluded, “we [plan to] work for them 
productively.”

Speaking to reporters in Greensboro, North Carolina, in one of her first press 
conferences since announcing her presidential bid more than a year ago, 
Democratic presidential nomineeHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> told reporters that 
although she wished her campaign staff had informed the public about her 
pneumonia more quickly, she did not think “it was a big deal” at the time.

Asked whether she was doing any “soul searching” as polls nationwide tighten 
between her and Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, Clinton asserted that she 
has know that “this was going to be a tight race - I’ve said it from the very 
beginning,” but that “we are in a strong position going into these last weeks.” 
What matters on Election Day, Clinton said, is “who registers to vote and who 
is motivated and mobilized to turn out to vote.”

Clinton responded to a question about whether the fact that running mate Tim 
kaine appeared not to know that she had fallen ill until the rest of the world 
knew, Clinton said that it did not preface a lack of communication in their 
potential relationship as president and vice president.

“My senior staff knew and information was provided to a number of people,” 
Clinton said. “This was an ailment that many people just power through and 
that’s what I thought I would do as well. I didn’t want to stop, I didn’t want 
to quit campaigning, I certainly didn’t want to miss the 9/11 memorial,” she 
continued. “It didn’t work out. So I got the antibiotics up and going, got the 
rest that I needed, and we’re going on from there.”

The Trump campaign has responded to criticism of Donald Trump Jr.’s assertions

 if his father, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, acted like rival 
Hillary Clinton.

“The liberal, dishonest media is so quick to attack one of the Trumps that 
they never let the truth get in the way of a good smear,” said communications 
advisor Jason Miller in a statement. “Don Jr. was clearly referring to capital 
punishment to make the case that the media continues to take words out of 
context in order to serve as the propaganda arm of theHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> campaign - something

Among the readings shared by Trump in his medical statement was his 
testosterone level of 441.6.

For a candidate who has called his opponents “low energy” 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW06MlHVxuQ> or characterized them as “little” 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p_ltuXcOH4>, while praising his own “stamina” 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/donald-trump-medical-details-stamina/>, 
low testosterone could have been damaging. Even if it were just to his ego.

Happily, Trump’s testosterone is fine.

“A normal range is 300 - 800,” said Dr Peter Snyder, medical director of the 
Penn Pituitary Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He said Trump’s 441.6 
level “would be considered normal for any adult male”.

Dr Abraham Morgentaler, author of the book Testosterone for Life 
<https://www.amazon.com/Testosterone-Life-Recharge-Vitality-Overall/dp/0071494804>
, said “450 or so is an average testosterone level in adult men”. Morgentaler 
agreed that Trump’s testosterone level was within normal range.

“He doesn’t have unusually high testosterone nor does he have unusually low 
testosterone.”

Ivanka Trump has responded to Cosmopolitan after the magazine ran a Q&A session
 
<http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a3356886/ivanka-trump-child-care-maternity-leave-policy/>
 with the Republican presidential nominee’s daughter in which she objected to 
the “negativity” of questions about Donald Trump’s past statements on pregnancy 
in the workplace.
Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) 
1/3: Politics aside, I'm working to raise awareness on issues that are of 
critical importance to American women and families.

becoming topics of mainstream conversation & that's a good thing.

In the interview, the younger Trump also laughed when pressed about why her 
proposal for paid parental leave for new parents didn’t apply to same-sex male 
couples, or fathers in general.

Paul Ryan encourages Donald Trump to release tax returns

Another day, another person requesting in vain that Republican presidential 
nomineeDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> release a 
copy of his tax returns, as major-party candidates have done for nearly half a 
century.

House speaker Paul Ryan said during his weekly press briefing 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/video/paul-ryan-says-trump-should-release-his-tax-returns-766001731721>
 that Trump should release his tax returns, but would leaving the timing of 
such a release to the candidate himself.

“Having a business guy as President is not the worst idea in the world.”

comments invoking the use of gas chambers to make a political attack show just 
how insensitive, divisive, and reckless the Trump campaign is. The bottom line 
is this – offensive references to the Holocaust are never acceptable, 
especially from a presidential campaign.

Trump Jr: tax records must remain secret to preserve 'dialogue'

It emerges that Donald Trump Jr’s explanation to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review 
<http://triblive.com/politics/politicalheadlines/11142102-74/trump-lies-pennsylvania>
 that his father can’t release his tax returns “because
that would detract from [his father’s] main message” was not a slip of the 
tongue. It was a talking point.

In a separate interview, with Pittsburgh’s Action News 4, Trump says that the 
tax returns can’t be released because “we don’t need a story with everyone 
questioning everything.”

Trump Jr is asked why the candidate won’t release his tax returns. Here’s his 
reply:

We’ve been told by tax counsel. You’ve got to remember. There’s nothing there. 
But if there is, they’re going to try to create a story. And the media that 
we’ve seen has been Hillary’s number one surrogate. They’ve been attacking us. 
The media’s been her biggest proponent. Because they’re afraid of a Trump 
system that will actually shake up DC...

We don’t need a story where everyone questioning everything. Because you know 
what happens with that. Everyone will take a chance. ‘What about this? What 
about this?’ And it’s just going to change the dialogue. Our dialogue is about 
jobs.

The interviewer also asks how Trump will make good on his promise to bring 
steel manufacturing back to the region. Trump Jr gives an answer about fracking.

An aide cuts the interview off when the reporter asks about the use of Trump 
foundation money for the purchase of a six-foot tall portrait of Trump, a 
purchase uncovered by the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold.

 forced her to take a four-day rest. Taking to the stage to the sound of I Feel 
Good by James Brown, the Democratic nominee insisted she was fully recovered 
and filled with a new sense of urgency at a critical juncture in American 
politics. “Being on the trail does not encourage reflection,” she told a young 
crowd at the University ofNorth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina>, Greensboro. “It’s 
important to sit with your thoughts every now and again and this helped me to 
reflect on what this campaign is all about.”

 * Donald Trump told TV host Dr Oz he feels “as good today as I did at 30”,

, Trump admitted that at 236lb he is overweight, but said he had bolstered his 
physical condition by giving speeches on the campaign trail. “It’s a lot of 
work,” he said. “You know, when I’m speaking in front of 15, 20,000 people and 
I’m up there using a lot of motion, I guess in its own way it’s a pretty 
healthy act. “A lot of times these rooms are really hot, like saunas, and I 
guess that’s a form of exercise.”

 * Trump attempted to combat widespread criticism of his sketchy economic 
policies by setting out what he presented as a new vision for the country that 
he audaciously claimed would create 25m new jobs in a decade and put the 
American worker first. 
 * Addressing one of the country’s most august economic debating societies, 
the Economic Club of New York, the Republican presidential nominee sought to 
dispel the criticism that has dogged his campaign that his mathematics do not 
add up in balancing tax cuts and new spending. Sticking closely to a 
pre-prepared script – despite an initial malfunctioning of his teleprompter - 
he delivered a speech that was billed in advance by his senior advisers as the 
culmination of his thinking on how to get America back to work. 
 * “American cars will travel the roads,” he said, “American planes will soar 
the skies, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will send new 
skyscrapers into the clouds, American hands will rebuild this nation, and 
American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation.”  
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> was 
quick to cite Trump’s refusal to back away from birtherism as evidence that the 
Republican nominee was fanning the flames of racial division.

Addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute at its annual gala in 
Washington on Thursday evening, Clinton condemned Trump for continuing to push 
conspiracy theories surrounding Obama’s birthplace.

“He still wouldn’t say Hawaii. He still wouldn’t say America,” the Democratic 
presidential nominee said. “This man wants to be our next president? When will 
he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?”

Clinton returned to the campaign trail earlier in the day with a rally in 
Greensboro, North Carolina, marking her first public appearance since she made 
public her diagnosis with pneumonia after abruptly leaving a 9/11 memorial on 
Sunday in New York City.

In her remarks before the gathering of prominent Hispanic leaders, Clinton 
reiterated her support for comprehensive immigration reform while decrying 
Trump’s rhetoric against immigrants and Muslims alike.

“There’s no innuendo or dog whistles anymore,” Clinton said of the Republican 
nominee. “It’s all right out there in the open now.”

“We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a 
message that even he can hear.”

Obama spoke before the group just prior to Clinton and similarly urged the 
Hispanic community to stand up against Trump’s bluster.

“I know that there are a lot of folks who had this notion of what the real 
America looks like and somehow it only includes a few of us,” the president 
said. “But who’s going to decide who the real America is?”

“Folks are betting that if they can drive us far enough apart and if they can 
put down enough of us because of where we come from, or what we look like, or 
what religion we practice then that may pay off at the polls.”

“But I’m telling you that’s a bet they’re going to lose,” he added.

Wisconsin governor Scott Walker broke his silence on Thursday over leaked 
documents obtained by Guardian US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/corporate-cash-john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin>
, which revealed his links to a complex network of conservative donors and the 
influence of corporate cash in the election process.

In an interview with Milwaukee’s WTMJ 620, the Republican governor described 
as “baseless” the legal investigation into alleged campaign finance violations 
that produced the 1,500 pages of documents.


“It’s what we often see in media outlets where you get bits and pieces shaped 
to push their agenda,”Walker said 
<http://www.wtmj.com/shows/charlie-sykes/gov-scott-walker-addresses-john-doe-document-leak>
. “The bottom line is we’ve had several courts in this state that have shut 
this down, this baseless investigation down, because it clearly didn’t show 
that what was done that was not lawful there.”


Known as the “John Doe investigation”, several Wisconsin prosecutors launched 
a probe into what they suspected were criminal campaign finance violations by 
the campaign committee of Walker, a former Republican presidential candidate 
who dropped out early in the primary race. The prosecutors claimed Walker’s 
committee operated a coordinated network that involved outside lobby groups, 
thereby allowing unlimited amounts of corporate money to funnel into a 
third-party group closely aligned with his campaign. In July 2015, theWisconsin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/wisconsin>supreme court halted the 
investigation.


In saying prosecutors misunderstood campaign finance law to pick on people and 
groups “wholly innocent of any wrongdoing”, the state’s high court took the 
extraordinary step to order all documents produced as part of the investigation 
to be destroyed and later held under seal – however at least one set survived 
that was leaked to Guardian US.


Walker told the radio station that unspecified people related to the 
investigation who “lose in the court of law, repeatedly” now “want to play this 
out in the court of public opinion – and do so with only bits and pieces, 
without the full story”.


“The bottom line is that people, not only at the supreme court level, but even 
initially at the circuit court level, where a distinguished reserve judge – 
who, as far as we can tell, has no aligned political allegiance with anyone – 
initially shut this down,” Walker said. “And that assertion’s been held many 
times over.”

, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump defiantly declared that he will 
not publicly reveal whether he still believes that President Barack Obama was 
born outside of the United States.

“I’ll answer that question at the right time,” Trump said. “I just don’t want 
to answer it yet.”

Trump, asked about his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, declaring that it 
was a settled issue that Obama was born a US citizen, Trump said: “It’s okay. 
She’s allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs. I want to 
focus on other things.”

“I don’t talk about it anymore,” Trump said. “The reason I don’t is because 
then everyone is going to be talking about it as opposed to jobs, the military, 
the vets, security.”

“Being on the trail does not encourage reflection,” she told a young crowd at 
the University ofNorth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina>. “It’s important to sit 
with your thoughts every now and again and this helped me to reflect on what 
this campaign is all about.”

Speaking calmly, without the cough that has interrupted recent appearances, 
the former secretary of state appeared rested. As she climbed the steps to the 
podium, she gripped a guard rail carefully.

“For millions of moms and dads, if they get sick there is no backup, they are 
on their own,” she said, turning her experience into a renewed call for better 
provision of healthcare and family leave. “That’s the story for too many people 
in America.”

Earlier Donald Trump, who has pulled level in some recent opinion polls, made 
his most explicit reference yet to his opponent’s health,releasing medical 
records 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-medical-report>
that boasted of his ability to “endure – uninterrupted – the rigors of a 
punishing and unprecedented presidential campaign”.

The physical examination also revealed the 70-year-old Republican to be 
overweight, at 236lbs, but he claimed he had bolstered his physical condition 
by giving speeches on the campaign trail.

Mark Fields, the CEO of Ford Motor Company and latest target of Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump’s ire, has responded to Trump’s allegations 
that the company will “fire all of its employees in the United States” as it 
moved small-car production to Mexico, calling Trump’s comments “unfortunate” 
and inaccurate.

“It’s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts and the 
facts are Ford’s investment in the US and commitment to American jobs has never 
been strong,” Fields told CNN’s Poppy Harlow this afternoon.

“We have created more than 28,000 jobs in the US in the last five years; we’ve 
invested more than $12b,” Fields continued. “We produce more vehicles in the US 
than any other automaker by far, and we employ more hourly workers here in our 
plants, more than any automaker by far. So we are very committed here and those 
are the facts.”

This morning, Trump told the hosts of Fox and Friends that he will implement a 
35% tariff on Ford cars manufactured in Mexico if he is elected president, 
something that Fields dismissed.


Asked if it was true that Ford would be “firing all of its employees” in the 
United States, Fields was adamant that Trump was wrong.

“Absolutely not - zero,” Ford said. “What we announced is that we’ll be moving 
our focus out of Michigan so that we can compete more financially in that 
particular segment but at the same time, and that’s an agreement we have with 
the UAW and what we’ll be doing is we’ll be replacing those products with two 
very exciting new products so not one job will be lost... most of our 
investment is here in the US and that’s the way it’s gonna continue to be.”

Whoever wins the election, Ford concluded, “we [plan to] work for them 
productively.”
 
Speaking to reporters in Greensboro, North Carolina, in one of her first press 
conferences since announcing her presidential bid more than a year ago, 
Democratic presidential nomineeHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> told reporters that 
although she wished her campaign staff had informed the public about her 
pneumonia more quickly, she did not think “it was a big deal” at the time.

Asked whether she was doing any “soul searching” as polls nationwide tighten 
between her and Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, Clinton asserted that she 
has know that “this was going to be a tight race - I’ve said it from the very 
beginning,” but that “we are in a strong position going into these last weeks.” 
What matters on Election Day, Clinton said, is “who registers to vote and who 
is motivated and mobilized to turn out to vote.”

Clinton responded to a question about whether the fact that running mate Tim 
kaine appeared not to know that she had fallen ill until the rest of the world 
knew, Clinton said that it did not preface a lack of communication in their 
potential relationship as president and vice president.

“My senior staff knew and information was provided to a number of people,” 
Clinton said. “This was an ailment that many people just power through and 
that’s what I thought I would do as well. I didn’t want to stop, I didn’t want 
to quit campaigning, I certainly didn’t want to miss the 9/11 memorial,” she 
continued. “It didn’t work out. So I got the antibiotics up and going, got the 
rest that I needed, and we’re going on from there.”
 
During an appearance on The Dr Oz Show, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> admitted he could lose some 
weight but said he felt “as good today as I did when I was 30”.
Trump talks stamina on Dr Oz and says he’d ‘like to lose weight’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-weight-stamina-health-video>
On the show, Dr Mehmet Oz concluded that Trump, who weighs 236 pounds, was a 
little overweight for his height. Trump’s campaign also released the results of 
his physical that said he had normal cholesterol and blood pressure.
 
The Trump campaign has responded to criticism of Donald Trump Jr.’s assertions 
that reporters would“be warming up the gas chamber” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-north-carolina-donald-trump-election-live?page=with:block-57daefe3e4b05caf65ecd98c#block-57daefe3e4b05caf65ecd98c>
 if his father, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, acted like rival 
Hillary Clinton.

“The liberal, dishonest media is so quick to attack one of the Trumps that 
they never let the truth get in the way of a good smear,” said communications 
advisor Jason Miller in a statement. “Don Jr. was clearly referring to capital 
punishment to make the case that the media continues to take words out of 
context in order to serve as the propaganda arm of theHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> campaign - something 
that’s only gotten worse as Trump’s poll numbers have improved.”
 
Speaking in Greensboro, North Carolina, Democratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> returned 
to the campaign trail after a bout of pneumonia sidelined her campaign - 
appropriately entering and exiting the stage to the song I Feel Good, by James 
Brown.
 
Among the readings shared by Trump in his medical statement was his 
testosterone level of 441.6.

For a candidate who has called his opponents “low energy” 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW06MlHVxuQ> or characterized them as “little” 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p_ltuXcOH4>, while praising his own “stamina” 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/donald-trump-medical-details-stamina/>, 
low testosterone could have been damaging. Even if it were just to his ego.

Happily, Trump’s testosterone is fine.

“A normal range is 300 - 800,” said Dr Peter Snyder, medical director of the 
Penn Pituitary Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He said Trump’s 441.6 
level “would be considered normal for any adult male”.

Dr Abraham Morgentaler, author of the book Testosterone for Life 
<https://www.amazon.com/Testosterone-Life-Recharge-Vitality-Overall/dp/0071494804>
, said “450 or so is an average testosterone level in adult men”. Morgentaler 
agreed that Trump’s testosterone level was within normal range.

“He doesn’t have unusually high testosterone nor does he have unusually low 
testosterone.”

In the interview, the younger Trump also laughed when pressed about why her 
proposal for paid parental leave for new parents didn’t apply to same-sex male 
couples, or fathers in general.
 
Watch live now:
 
Another day, another person requesting in vain that Republican presidential 
nomineeDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> release a 
copy of his tax returns, as major-party candidates have done for nearly half a 
century.

House speaker Paul Ryan said during his weekly press briefing 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/video/paul-ryan-says-trump-should-release-his-tax-returns-766001731721>
 that Trump should release his tax returns, but would leaving the timing of 
such a release to the candidate himself.

“Having a business guy as President is not the worst idea in the world.”
 
The Hillary Clinton campaign has responded to Donald Trump Jr’s use of gas 
chamber imagery to attack Democrats (read about that here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-north-carolina-donald-trump-election-live?page=with:block-57dac13be4b067ad300880dd#block-57dac13be4b067ad300880dd>
).

Clinton’s statement says, in part:

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> Jr’s recent 
comments invoking the use of gas chambers to make a political attack show just 
how insensitive, divisive, and reckless the Trump campaign is. The bottom line 
is this – offensive references to the Holocaust are never acceptable, 
especially from a presidential campaign.

It emerges that Donald Trump Jr’s explanation to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review 
<http://triblive.com/politics/politicalheadlines/11142102-74/trump-lies-pennsylvania>
 that his father can’t release his tax returns “because
that would detract from [his father’s] main message” was not a slip of the 
tongue. It was a talking point.

In a separate interview, with Pittsburgh’s Action News 4, Trump says that the 
tax returns can’t be released because “we don’t need a story with everyone 
questioning everything.”

Trump Jr is asked why the candidate won’t release his tax returns. Here’s his 
reply:

We’ve been told by tax counsel. You’ve got to remember. There’s nothing there. 
But if there is, they’re going to try to create a story. And the media that 
we’ve seen has been Hillary’s number one surrogate. They’ve been attacking us. 
The media’s been her biggest proponent. Because they’re afraid of a Trump 
system that will actually shake up DC...

We don’t need a story where everyone questioning everything. Because you know 
what happens with that. Everyone will take a chance. ‘What about this? What 
about this?’ And it’s just going to change the dialogue. Our dialogue is about 
jobs.

The interviewer also asks how Trump will make good on his promise to bring 
steel manufacturing back to the region. Trump Jr gives an answer about fracking.

An aide cuts the interview off when the reporter asks about the use of Trump 
foundation money for the purchase of a six-foot tall portrait of Trump, a 
purchase uncovered by the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold.

What’s in the second half of this new Trump minority outreach video? We don’t

Anyone out there able to watch this for more than a minute? Post your best
