Davis Love III <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/davis-love-iii>, the USA 
captain, and his 12 players assembled before practice at Hazeltine on Tuesday 
for their photoshoot with the trophy.

Woods, who is expected to make his playing comeback in a fortnight’s time 
after more than a year out with back problems, positioned himself on the far 
right of the back row next to Jimmy Walker.

The 40-year-old was waved away by the photographer but, perhaps 
misunderstanding, Woods merely swapped sides and moved to the far left next to 
Ryan Moore. He was then ordered to stand on the sidelines by the photographer – 
much to the hilarity of the players.

Woods, not necessarily known for his sense of humour on the course, managed to 
see the funny side with a salute to the photographer and a chuckle to himself.

The former world No1 is scheduled to play for the first time since August 2015 
at the Safeway Open in California 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/tiger-woods-return-golf-injury-layoff>
, which starts on 13 October and then the Turkish Airlines Open in early 
November and the Hero World Challenge, run by his own foundation, in the 
Bahamas a month after that.
