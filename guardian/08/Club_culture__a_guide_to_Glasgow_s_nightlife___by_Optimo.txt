What makes the Glasgow nightlife scene so special?
When you live here for a while you start to understand that there’s something 
running through this city that seems to nourish the unstoppable need to produce 
that all artists have. Things get done, no matter whether there are obstacles 
in the way. That’s why I live here and it’s this energy that has fed into the 
nightlife scene; that’s what makes it special. This – and the decor in the Sub 
Club toilets!

How does partying in Glasgow compare with other cities?
I’d say there’s an intensity to the party scene, which is heightened by the 
short licencing hours that we have. Clubs are generally only open from 11pm 
till 3am – with only occasional extensions till 4am. When people arrive at a 
club at 11pm they’re raring to go because they know it’ll be over in 4 hours. 
Apart from anything though, it’s really hedonistic.

What’s the atmosphere like when you’re out?
There’s a huge party atmosphere in the streets of Glasgow on Friday and 
Saturday nights. There’s always a lot of noise, a lot of flesh, a lot of 
emotion and a lot of bad food; girls walking home together in their bare feet, 
eating chips.

Who are the new DJs and producers to listen out for?
There are many young DJs and producers in the city – and more new ones coming 
along all the time. One of the young team making great tracks isDenis Sulta 
<https://soundcloud.com/denissulta> who is releasing on Glasgow’s Dixon Avenue 
Basement Jams label. Others includeMia Dora <https://soundcloud.com/mia-dora>
(Optimo Trax No12),Nightwave <https://soundcloud.com/nightwave808>, Golden 
Teacher <https://soundcloud.com/goldenteacher>, Jasper James

Pleiades,MWX <https://soundcloud.com/mwxinthemix>, Telford 
<https://soundcloud.com/telford>, General Ludd

Where should you start your night?
If I was to go out for dinner and a drink before a club, I’d head to the 
Finnieston area. It’s buzzing there and you can get a nice bit of fish for your 
tea, even though you have to eat it off a slate and drink your drink out of a 
jam jar. There’s a great bar and venue calledDistill <http://distillbar.co.uk/> 
along Argyle Street where a lot of good DJs have regular slots. Near the top of 
Sauchiehall Street there isChinaski’s <http://chinaskis.com/> pub, and also the 
Berkeley Suite <http://www.berkeleysuite.com/>, which is a tiny, old-fashioned 
gin palace upstairs and a club for about 250 below. Maybe try one of the city’s 
really old pubs such asThe Saracen’s Head <http://www.saracenhead.com/> on 
Gallowgate, which is close to theBarrowland Ballroom 
<http://www.glasgow-barrowland.com/ballroom.htm>. It’s an amazing place, ask 
for a pint of Shammy.

Which club nights are worth checking out?
There are loads of great parties at the minute: there’s the Numbers 
<http://nmbrs.net/> parties at various locations around the city. There’s a 
party by some young lads calledNight of the Jaguar 
<https://www.facebook.com/jaguars.of.the.night> (I’ve played at it myself 
recently) and that’s at theSchool of Art <http://www.theartschool.co.uk/>. 
There’sHighlife <https://www.facebook.com/HighlifeMusicClub> run by Brian 
D’Souza (Auntie Flo) and Esa, Vitamins, Melting Pot, we are doing our own 
Optimo party bi-monthly atSub Club <http://subclub.co.uk/> and there’s what’s 
probably the longest-running party in clubbing history, Subculture, which is at 
Sub Club every Saturday night.

Which club has the most history?
It has to be the Sub Club. Just continuing for that long as an independent 
club and sticking to its guns, regarding what happens there, is remarkable. The 
people behind the club (Mike, Ricky and Barry) are genuinely into music, the 
security are friendly, the sound system is great, the crowd is wild; that’s why 
it’s had such longevity and why it is probably the most important club in the 
city.

How about newer clubs? Which ones are really making an impression?
There’s a great little club on Queen Street called La Cheetah 
<http://www.maxsbar.co.uk/> at Max’s Bar on Queen Street. It’s a basement that 
holds about 200 people and the atmosphere down in there is magic..

 Sub Club, Glasgow’s longest-running club 
Where should you go for something truly alternative?
The Poetry Club <https://www.facebook.com/ThePoetryClubGlasgow>. It is 
literally a poetry club – hosting everything from spoken word performances to 
the more experimental side of music. It functions as an ever-evolving artwork 
and was opened by the artistJim Lambie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2008/oct/17/frieze-jim-lambie>
. Events could be … a Patti Smith poetry session, a noise show, an art auction 
or it may just be an idea someone suggested and that it’s willing to host. But 
it’s a destination venue, off the beaten track a bit. It’s somewhere where 
you’re going to have to know what’s going on before you visit, not somewhere 
you stumble upon.

Can you describe Glasgow’s nightlife scene in three words? 
Eleven till three.
