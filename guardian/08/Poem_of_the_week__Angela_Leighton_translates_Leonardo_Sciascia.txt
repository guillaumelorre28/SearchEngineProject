Hic et Nunc (1)

I am a mutilated statue
at the bottom of clear waters.

Halted in a gesture — and broken.

Only a tremor of things
reflected — trees enskied
and quick flights — can give me
the thrill of time,
a way to change nothing into words.

Hic et Nunc (2)


Stopped dead, I’m locked
in a broken gesture,

an ancient statue at the bottom of a lake.


Look, what I see’s a world reflected,
sky trees, bird flights,
time changing my unchangingness,
and tiny tremors I cannot feel
turning the nothingness into words.


Angela Leighton’s new poetry and prose collection Spills 
<http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781847772251>, closes with 
a series of translations from Leonardo Sciascia’sLa Sicilia, il suo cuore 
(Sicily, Its Heart). Each poem appears in two translations exemplifying 
different approaches: set out on facing pages, the pairs comprise what Leighton 
describes as, first, “a fairly strict rendering, which conveys the sense and 
syntax, line by line, but loses, in the process, the rhythm of poetry” and “a 
free version which takes the original and [is] part interpretation, part 
variation on a theme.” The titles are not numbered in the text.

 The Sicilian writer and politician Leonardo Sciascia 
<https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-Sciascia> produced two 
collections of poetry during his career.La Sicilia, il suo cuore (1952) was a 
response to the suicide of his younger brother four years earlier. Leighton’s 
Note on the Translations gives us a vivid impression of the sulphuric landscape 
of Sciascia’s birthplace, Racalmuto, the mining territory where “the classical 
resonances of the landscape, its antiquity in story, are mingled with … more 
recent connotations of a fiery underworld”. Hic et Nunc makes us particularly 
aware of those “classical resonances”, with its Latin title and vantage-point 
of “a mutilated statue”. Broken, displaced, the statue is a presence so strong 
it addresses us directly, out of the water and across time, an immediate 
paradox being set up by Sciascia’s juxtaposition of the sunken statue and the 
title’s Hic et Nunc (Here and Now).

 “Hic et Nunc” (the tag) has been described as “the imperative motto for the 
satisfaction of desire 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_(H)#hic_et_nunc>”. 

It may also have an almost opposite, theological dimension, and allude to the 
immediate revelation of the divine presence. More loosely, it could describe 
the poet’s response to his/her material and the way language transports the 
past into the present – a meaning perhaps closer to the theological.

 The stricter translation (1) has the lighter texture of the pair, and at 
times seems the nearest in its music to the original. The feminine endings of 
the Italian are picked up by the first three lines, creating an impression of 
wateriness and airiness. The second translation emphasises solidity in its hard 
opening consonants, witha Plathian echo in the first line 
<https://allpoetry.com/Stopped-Dead> that might evoke the cruelly abrupt, or 
insufficiently prepared-for, shutdown of the body in a fatal accident or 
violent act of suicide. The statue is described as “mutilated” in the original 
poem and the first translation, but the emphasis in the second version is on an 
abrupt cessation, almost the paralysis of rigor mortis: “Stopped dead, I’m 
locked/in a broken gesture”.

 The imperative “Look” picks up the stony consonants of “locked” and “lake” 
and contributes to the insistent tone. The literary but graceful “trees 
enskied” is lost, while specific details are gained, such as “bird flights” 
instead of “quick flights”. The qualifier “Only” (“soltanto”) lends fragility 
and evanescence to “only a tremor of things” in the first version, very unlike 
the effect of “what I see’s a world reflected” in (2). The “tremor” itself is 
repositioned in the second version, from line four to line seven, and becomes 
“tiny tremors I cannot feel” – a nice evocation of ripples and also, perhaps, 
delicate, undetectable soundwaves. Both versions avoid the phrase “delirium of 
time” (“delirio di tempo”) but “the thrill of time” has a shiver and shimmer 
omitted from (2).

 Leighton’s free translations may alter the original structures. Here, though, 
the free version is modelled on its partner. This skeletal similarity sharpens 
our awareness of the contrasted textures of the fleshings-out, and the 
differences of vocal style. The voice in (1) seems, on the whole, more 
vulnerable and tentative than the voice in (2).

 While the free version initially proclaims stasis, it concludes with movement 
and mutation, with those “tiny tremors … turning the nothingness into words.” 
Because the noun “nothingness” is chosen over “nothing”, the assertion becomes 
plainer. Interestingly, “nothingness” is closer to the Italian (“il nulla”) 
than the “nothing” of version one, which is open to the negative interpretation 
that maybe nothingat all will be changed into words. Line six introduces 
polyptoton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyptoton> to reinforce the sense of 
process and achievement (“time changing my unchangingness”) and ends on an 
unambiguous note of triumph.

 Leighton’s commentary on the translations concludes: “Between strict and free 
renderings, adherence to sense and adherence to the makings of a poem in 
English, I have tried to catch something of the original, even if only 
‘between’.” This idea of “between-ness” might be in your thoughts as you 
compare the two versions, andlook back at the original
