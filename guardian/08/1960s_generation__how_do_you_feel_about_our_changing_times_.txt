The world has been shaken in recent months, by everything from Britain leaving 
the European Union to Donald Trump becoming the president-elect in the US. So 
how do those who those who lived through the 1960s feel? Do you think the world 
you fought for is changing?


The 1960s and early 1970s were characterised by a sense of hope and optimism. 
Britain had just joined the Common Market and had a sense of unity with Europe. 
The Women’s Liberation movement was fighting for everything from contraception 
and abortion rights, which were won in the UK in 1967 and 1973 in the US, to 
equal pay. There was a sense of non-conformity and individuality. In America 
the Civil Rights Movement was calling for equality for all.


We want to hear from those who fought for any of these movements. Do you feel 
it’s now under threat? Or are you in favour of the changes? How do you feel as 
a 1960s child about Brexit? How do others in Europe feel about how the world 
has changed? Tell us in the form below.
