Today in transition 2016

 * Former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway Conway told the media pool 
at Trump tower that the president-elect is “really enjoying” the transition. 
“He’s just loving this role in transition, he’s a transactional guy, he’s used 
to delivering results and producing, and so at his desk every day, taking the 
counsel of many different people, taking many different phone calls, going 
through paperwork and discussing forming his cabinet and now [inaudible] his 
senior staff,” Conway said. “He’s really enjoying it.” 
 * Retired Army lieutenant general Michael Flynn has been offered the role of 
national security advisor by president-elect Donald Trump,according to the 
Associated Press 
<https://www.apnews.com/7bcfefc7ad934a5c952434f98857f316/The-Latest:-Trump-offers-Flynn-national-security-adviser-job>
, citing a senior Trump transition official. The official did not tell the 
Associated Press whether Flynn had accepted the role or not. 
 * Jason Miller, communications director for the Trump transition team, has 
released this statement in response to reports that theincoming administration 
has been considering a register for Muslims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/17/muslim-americans-donald-trump-hate-crimes-surveillance>
 arriving in the US: 
President-elect Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that 
tracks individuals based on their religion, and to imply otherwise is 
completely false.


The national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism 
activity that was in place during the Bush and Obama administrations gave 
intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our 
country safe, but the president-elect plans on releasing his own vetting 
policies after he is sworn in.

 * President-elect Donald Trump plans to launch a “victory tour” of the states 
that he won in last week’s presidential election in “the next couple of weeks,” 
according to a campaign aide - a sentence we never thought we’d be typing and 
yet here we are! “We’re working on a victory tour now; it will happen in the 
next couple of weeks,” George Gigicos, Trump’s advance team director, told pool 
reporters at Trump Tower this afternoon. The tour, while not fully planned at 
the moment, will ferry the president-elect “obviously to the states that we won 
and the swing states we flipped over.” Facebook

Donald Trump is taking credit for Ford Motor Company not moving a plant from 
Kentucky to Mexico:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me 
that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico

I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it 
to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!

The plant, the Louisville Assembly Plant in Louisville, Kentucky, employs 
roughly 4,500 people and was never put suggested by Ford to be at risk of 
outsourcing in the first place.

In an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Carl Higbie, a spokesman for a 
pro-Trump Super PAC, defended comments he made during a Fox News interview in 
which he said WWII-era Japanese internment camps could serve as a precedent for 
a registry of Muslims in the United States.

“At no point did I ever even mention - it was actually Megyn Kelly, which I 
was actually talking about like immigration reform under Carter when he did the 
Iran thing, and then also under World War II with Japan and other many 
countries do,” Higbie said. “I wasn’t even talking about camps. Megyn brought 
it up and I was shocked.”

“She brought it up, but you did say, further to the New York Times, that it 
would be a precedent for a registry,” Burnett responded.

“It was precedent for - exactly,” Higbie continued. “Here’s thing. I don’t 
actually advocate for any of this. I didn’t bring it up. I was shocked when 
Megyn brought it up. I clarified to the New York Times today, I said, look, you 
know what, this is something that is a huge black mark on our society, and we 
would never want to do it again. But you have to say that ’63 Supreme Court 
decision upholding it was never overturned. Should we overturn it? We should 
take a look at it.”

Barack Obama on fake news: 'We have problems' if we can't tell the difference

Olivia Solon

President Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> has 
spoken out about fake news on Facebook and other media platforms, suggesting 
that it helped undermine the US political process.

“If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not, if we can’t 
discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,” 
he said during apress conference in Germany 
<http://thehill.com/policy/technology/306595-obama-rails-against-fake-news>.


Since the surprise election of Donald Trump as president-elect, Facebook has 
battled accusations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories>
 that it has failed to stem the flow of misinformation on its network and that 
its business model leads to users becoming divided into polarized political 
echo chambers.

Obama said that we live in an age with “so much active misinformation” that is 
“packaged very well” and looks the same whether it’s onFacebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> or on TV.

“If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we 
won’t know what to protect. We won’t know what to fight for. And we can lose so 
much of what we’ve gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and 
market-based economies and prosperity that we’ve come to take for granted,”he 
said

.

These comments come after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg rejected the “crazy 
idea” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-us-election-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump>
 that fake news on the social network swayed voters in the US presidential 
election. That’s in spite of analysis by BuzzFeed that showed thatfake news on 
the site outperformed real news 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook>
 in the run-up to polling day.

Video: President-elect Donald Trump’s team has declared that “President-elect 
Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that tracks individuals 
based on their religion.”

The problem is, there’s video from one year ago showing exactly that.
Donald Trump: we need to track all Muslims in America 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/20/donald-trump-track-muslim-americans-video>
“There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases,” Trump told NBC, saying 
such policies would help America to crack down on illegal immigrants. Asked how 
he would implement such a system, Trump replied: “Good management.”

 that Flynn ran a private consulting firm that offered “all source intelligence 
support” to international clients while he was receiving classified national 
security briefings:

The full extent of Flynn’s overseas business is unclear. In the statement 
released by his lawyer, Flynn said only that his firm– which he described as a 
‘private business intelligence company’ - has unnamed ‘international and 
domestic clients.’ In a brief telephone interview, Kelley, a former Capitol 
Hill staffer, declined to specify the issues that the firm was hired to lobby 
Congress about on behalf of Innova BV, a firm based in Holland and owned by the 
Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. The lobbying disclosure statement filed 
with the Secretary of the Senate on Sept. 30 states only that Flynn’s firm 
‘will advise client on U.S. domestic and foreign policy’ and congressional 
appropriations bills for the State Department.

AP: Retired general Michael Flynn offered national security advisor role

Retired Army lieutenant general Michael Flynn has been offered the role of 
national security advisor by president-elect Donald Trump,according to the 
Associated Press 
<https://www.apnews.com/7bcfefc7ad934a5c952434f98857f316/The-Latest:-Trump-offers-Flynn-national-security-adviser-job>
, citing a senior Trump transition official.

The official did not tell the Associated Press whether Flynn had accepted the 
role or not.

Segar/Reuters 
Flynn, 57, was the only national security figure of his rank to publicly align 
himself with Trump and remained loyal to the businessman throughout his 
campaign.

While other national security experts criticised and denounced the GOP 
nominee, Flynn took part in campaign rallies where he led chants against 
Hillary Clinton, including those that called for her to be locked up. “The 
enemy camp in this case is Hillary Rodham Clinton,” Flynn said in Florida 
during the summer.


The three-star general also delivered what was reported to be a “fiery” speech 
at the Republican national convention, where he lambasted Barack Obama’s “empty 
speeches and his misguided rhetoric”, which he said had “caused the world to 
have no respect for America’s word”, or might.


Flynn, who in 2015 declared himself a registered Democrat, held senior 
positions in the 18th Airborne Corps, at the joint chiefs of staff at the 
Pentagon and at US central command, which runs US military operations in the 
Middle East.

Flynn has since proven himself to be a controversial figure and public 
opponent of Obama’s foreign policy. In his 2016 book, The Field of Fight: How 
We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies, co-authored 
with the historian and former Reagan administration official Michael Ledeen, he 
wrote that he is “not a devotee of so-called political correctness”.


He has come under fire for regularly appearing on Russian state-owned 
television station RT, and once attended a gala hosted by the channel, sitting 
two places away from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. He later said his 
speaker’s bureau had arranged his trip to Russia and that he saw no distinction 
between RT and other news outlets such as CNN and MSNBC.


Flynn was once opposed to waterboarding and other banned extreme interrogation 
techniques, but,according to the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-the-entire-national-security-establishment-has-rejected-trumpexcept-for-this-man/2016/08/15/d5072d96-5e4b-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html>
, in reference to Trump’s previously stated openness to reinstating such 
techniques, he said he “would be reluctant to take options off the table”. 
Asked by al-Jazeera if he would support Trump’s threat to kill the families of 
suspected terrorists, he said: “I would have to see the circumstances of that 
situation.”

In July, Flynn retweeted an antisemitic post by a Trump supporter who mocked 
the Clinton campaign’s blaming of Russian hackers for leaked emails. The tweet, 
by a pseudonymous user, read: “CNN implicated. ‘The USSR is to blame!’ Not 
anymore, Jews. Not anymore.” Flynn later deleted his retweet and apologised, 
saying it was a mistake and that he had meant to link to an article on Clinton 
and the DNC emails.


Flynn also tweeted in February that “fear of Muslims is RATIONAL,” a tweet 
which was never deleted.
General Flynn (@GenFlynn) 
Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no 
questions...https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU <https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU>

Muslims in Trump's America: realities of Islamophobic presidency begin to sink 
in

Fariha Nizam was sleepy and stressed last Thursday morning when she boarded 
the Q43 bus, which cuts throughthe affluent Queens neighborhood where Donald 
Trump was raised 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/donald-trump-jamaica-estates-new-york-election-day>
.

As a Muslim, she was concerned about the newly minted president-elect and his 
campaign promises that targeted Muslims, immigrants and women. But it wasn’t 
until an older white couple began yelling at her, 10 minutes into her weekly 
commute to her internship, that the reality of Trump’s America set in.

“Most of what they were saying was telling me I can’t wear it [the hijab] 
anymore and telling me to take it off,” Nizam, a Bengali American, said.

The 19-year-old student had heard some Islamophobic comments before, but 
hadn’t experienced such aggressive harassment inNew York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> City, where she, like Trump, was 
born and raised. But the stream of verbal abuse forced her to confront a 
reality she had been trying to avoid – that Trump had actually won.

“I didn’t believe it until the moment this incident occurred,” she said of 
Trump’s victory. “I don’t think I absorbed it and felt the reality of it, I 
didn’t. I kept myself distracted all of Wednesday and then Thursday happened 
and then it hits me, this is actually what’s going on and it was not OK.”

Nizam is one of several Muslims around the country who have spoken to the 
Guardian about life since Trump’s victory. Trump won the keys to the White 
House following an incendiary campaign where he proposed a ban on Muslims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting>
, said Muslims “hate” Americans and promised a Muslim registry. Kansas 
secretary of state Kris Kobach,reportedly a key member of Trump’s transition 
team <http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-idUSKBN13B05C>, 
said on Tuesday that the president-elect’s advisers are already considering the 
Muslim registry.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the amount of hate crimes 
reported since election night has been unusually high – as of Tuesday, the 
civil rights organization hadtallied 437 incidents nationwide 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/200-reports-hateful-harassment-intimidation-post-election-splc/story?id=43491050>
.

This is the case even in seemingly Muslim-friendly places like New York City, 
and inMichigan <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michigan>, which has one of 
the largest concentrations of Muslims in the US. Civil rights groups there have 
reported an uptick in harassment – with one calling for a hate crime 
investigation after a Muslim woman in Ann Arbor was allegedly forced to remove 
her hijab by an unknown white man who, according to police, threatened to set 
her on fire with a lighter.


In another reported incident, two men shoved an 18-year-old woman wearing a 
hooded sweatshirt, commented on religion and asked her: “Do you know you’re in 
America?”

In the traditionally liberal city of Ann Arbor, two alleged incidents of 
ethnic intimidation and religious bias in a week is unusual, said Detective Lt 
Matthew Lige of the Ann Arbor police department.

“Certainly Ann Arbor, as a community that prides itself on its diversity, in 
race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, all those type of things,” he said. 
“So, for us to have two incidents that fit in this category is unusual and 
certainly [with] the political climate that we’re in right now, it’s 
concerning.”

Michigan and New York are home to some of the largest concentrations of 
Muslims in the US. But it is impossible to say with certainty how many Muslims 
there are in the country as the Census Bureau does not ask questions about 
faith. Estimates vary from as few as 3 million to as many as 8 million. Within 
that overall demographic, there is huge diversity in terms of geography, 
religious identity and race-cum-ethnicity, which renders any generalizations 
about the “Muslim community” in America perilous.

Is it correct that Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has “never advocated for any 
registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion”?

Here’s what he told NBC News in November last year 
<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-would-certainly-implement-muslim-database>:

Donald Trump “would certainly implement” a database system tracking Muslims in 
the United States, the Republican front-runner told NBC News on Thursday night.

“I would certainly implement that. Absolutely,” Trump said in Newton, Iowa, in 
between campaign town halls.

“There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases,” he added. “We should 
have a lot of systems.”

When asked whether Muslims would be legally obligated to sign into the 
database, Trump responded, “They have to be – they have to be.” Later, Trump 
was repeatedly asked to explain the difference between requiring Muslims to 
enter their information into a database and making Jewish people register in 
Nazi Germany. He responded four times by saying: “You tell me.”

Statement from Trump team on 'Muslim registry'

Jason Miller, communications director for the Trump transition team, has 
released this statement in response to reports that theincoming administration 
has been considering a register for Muslims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/17/muslim-americans-donald-trump-hate-crimes-surveillance>
 arriving in the US:

 President-elect Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that 
tracks individuals based on their religion, and to imply otherwise is 
completely false.


The national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism 
activity that was in place during the Bush and Obama administrations gave 
intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our 
country safe, but the president-elect plans on releasing his own vetting 
policies after he is sworn in.

Barack Obama is the latest figure to speak out about fake news on Facebook and

 * Former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway Conway told the media pool 
at Trump tower that the president-elect is “really enjoying” the transition. 
“He’s just loving this role in transition, he’s a transactional guy, he’s used 
to delivering results and producing, and so at his desk every day, taking the 
counsel of many different people, taking many different phone calls, going 
through paperwork and discussing forming his cabinet and now [inaudible] his 
senior staff,” Conway said. “He’s really enjoying it.”

 arriving in the US: 
President-elect Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that 
tracks individuals based on their religion, and to imply otherwise is 
completely false.


The national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism 
activity that was in place during the Bush and Obama administrations gave 
intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our 
country safe, but the president-elect plans on releasing his own vetting 
policies after he is sworn in.

 * President-elect Donald Trump plans to launch a “victory tour” of the states 
that he won in last week’s presidential election in “the next couple of weeks,” 
according to a campaign aide - a sentence we never thought we’d be typing and 
yet here we are! “We’re working on a victory tour now; it will happen in the 
next couple of weeks,” George Gigicos, Trump’s advance team director, told pool 
reporters at Trump Tower this afternoon. The tour, while not fully planned at 
the moment, will ferry the president-elect “obviously to the states that we won 
and the swing states we flipped over.”

The plant, the Louisville Assembly Plant in Louisville, Kentucky, employs 
roughly 4,500 people and was never put suggested by Ford to be at risk of 
outsourcing in the first place.
 
In an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Carl Higbie, a spokesman for a 
pro-Trump Super PAC, defended comments he made during a Fox News interview in 
which he said WWII-era Japanese internment camps could serve as a precedent for 
a registry of Muslims in the United States.

“At no point did I ever even mention - it was actually Megyn Kelly, which I 
was actually talking about like immigration reform under Carter when he did the 
Iran thing, and then also under World War II with Japan and other many 
countries do,” Higbie said. “I wasn’t even talking about camps. Megyn brought 
it up and I was shocked.”

“She brought it up, but you did say, further to the New York Times, that it 
would be a precedent for a registry,” Burnett responded.

“It was precedent for - exactly,” Higbie continued. “Here’s thing. I don’t 
actually advocate for any of this. I didn’t bring it up. I was shocked when 
Megyn brought it up. I clarified to the New York Times today, I said, look, you 
know what, this is something that is a huge black mark on our society, and we 
would never want to do it again. But you have to say that ’63 Supreme Court 
decision upholding it was never overturned. Should we overturn it? We should 
take a look at it.”

The problem is, there’s video from one year ago showing exactly that.

“There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases,” Trump told NBC, saying

he would implement such a system, Trump replied: “Good management.”

And just minutes after news broke that retired lieutenant general Michael 
Flynn has been offered the role of national security advisor in Donald Trump’s 
administration,Yahoo News reports 
<https://www.yahoo.com/news/michael-flynn-key-trump-aide-sat-in-on-intel-briefings-while-advising-foreign-clients-004512931.html?soc_src=mail&soc_trk=ma>
 that Flynn ran a private consulting firm that offered “all source intelligence 
support” to international clients while he was receiving classified national 
security briefings:

The full extent of Flynn’s overseas business is unclear. In the statement 
released by his lawyer, Flynn said only that his firm– which he described as a 
‘private business intelligence company’ - has unnamed ‘international and 
domestic clients.’ In a brief telephone interview, Kelley, a former Capitol 
Hill staffer, declined to specify the issues that the firm was hired to lobby 
Congress about on behalf of Innova BV, a firm based in Holland and owned by the 
Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. The lobbying disclosure statement filed 
with the Secretary of the Senate on Sept. 30 states only that Flynn’s firm 
‘will advise client on U.S. domestic and foreign policy’ and congressional 
appropriations bills for the State Department.
 
Retired Army lieutenant general Michael Flynn has been offered the role of 
national security advisor by president-elect Donald Trump,according to the 
Associated Press 
<https://www.apnews.com/7bcfefc7ad934a5c952434f98857f316/The-Latest:-Trump-offers-Flynn-national-security-adviser-job>
, citing a senior Trump transition official.

The official did not tell the Associated Press whether Flynn had accepted the 
role or not.

Flynn, 57, was the only national security figure of his rank to publicly align 
himself with Trump and remained loyal to the businessman throughout his 
campaign.

While other national security experts criticised and denounced the GOP 
nominee, Flynn took part in campaign rallies where he led chants against 
Hillary Clinton, including those that called for her to be locked up. “The 
enemy camp in this case is Hillary Rodham Clinton,” Flynn said in Florida 
during the summer.


The three-star general also delivered what was reported to be a “fiery” speech 
at the Republican national convention, where he lambasted Barack Obama’s “empty 
speeches and his misguided rhetoric”, which he said had “caused the world to 
have no respect for America’s word”, or might.


Flynn, who in 2015 declared himself a registered Democrat, held senior 
positions in the 18th Airborne Corps, at the joint chiefs of staff at the 
Pentagon and at US central command, which runs US military operations in the 
Middle East.

Flynn has since proven himself to be a controversial figure and public 
opponent of Obama’s foreign policy. In his 2016 book, The Field of Fight: How 
We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies, co-authored 
with the historian and former Reagan administration official Michael Ledeen, he 
wrote that he is “not a devotee of so-called political correctness”.


He has come under fire for regularly appearing on Russian state-owned 
television station RT, and once attended a gala hosted by the channel, sitting 
two places away from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. He later said his 
speaker’s bureau had arranged his trip to Russia and that he saw no distinction 
between RT and other news outlets such as CNN and MSNBC.


Flynn was once opposed to waterboarding and other banned extreme interrogation 
techniques, but,according to the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-the-entire-national-security-establishment-has-rejected-trumpexcept-for-this-man/2016/08/15/d5072d96-5e4b-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html>
, in reference to Trump’s previously stated openness to reinstating such 
techniques, he said he “would be reluctant to take options off the table”. 
Asked by al-Jazeera if he would support Trump’s threat to kill the families of 
suspected terrorists, he said: “I would have to see the circumstances of that 
situation.”

In July, Flynn retweeted an antisemitic post by a Trump supporter who mocked 
the Clinton campaign’s blaming of Russian hackers for leaked emails. The tweet, 
by a pseudonymous user, read: “CNN implicated. ‘The USSR is to blame!’ Not 
anymore, Jews. Not anymore.” Flynn later deleted his retweet and apologised, 
saying it was a mistake and that he had meant to link to an article on Clinton 
and the DNC emails.


Flynn also tweeted in February that “fear of Muslims is RATIONAL,” a tweet 
which was never deleted.

As a Muslim, she was concerned about the newly minted president-elect and his 
campaign promises that targeted Muslims, immigrants and women. But it wasn’t 
until an older white couple began yelling at her, 10 minutes into her weekly 
commute to her internship, that the reality of Trump’s America set in.

“Most of what they were saying was telling me I can’t wear it [the hijab] 
anymore and telling me to take it off,” Nizam, a Bengali American, said.

The 19-year-old student had heard some Islamophobic comments before, but 
hadn’t experienced such aggressive harassment inNew York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> City, where she, like Trump, was 
born and raised. But the stream of verbal abuse forced her to confront a 
reality she had been trying to avoid – that Trump had actually won.

“I didn’t believe it until the moment this incident occurred,” she said of 
Trump’s victory. “I don’t think I absorbed it and felt the reality of it, I 
didn’t. I kept myself distracted all of Wednesday and then Thursday happened 
and then it hits me, this is actually what’s going on and it was not OK.”

Nizam is one of several Muslims around the country who have spoken to the 
Guardian about life since Trump’s victory. Trump won the keys to the White 
House following an incendiary campaign where he proposed a ban on Muslims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting>
, said Muslims “hate” Americans and promised a Muslim registry. Kansas 
secretary of state Kris Kobach,reportedly a key member of Trump’s transition 
team <http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-idUSKBN13B05C>, 
said on Tuesday that the president-elect’s advisers are already considering the 
Muslim registry.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the amount of hate crimes 
reported since election night has been unusually high – as of Tuesday, the 
civil rights organization hadtallied 437 incidents nationwide 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/200-reports-hateful-harassment-intimidation-post-election-splc/story?id=43491050>
.

This is the case even in seemingly Muslim-friendly places like New York City, 
and inMichigan <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michigan>, which has one of 
the largest concentrations of Muslims in the US. Civil rights groups there have 
reported an uptick in harassment – with one calling for a hate crime 
investigation after a Muslim woman in Ann Arbor was allegedly forced to remove 
her hijab by an unknown white man who, according to police, threatened to set 
her on fire with a lighter.


In another reported incident, two men shoved an 18-year-old woman wearing a 
hooded sweatshirt, commented on religion and asked her: “Do you know you’re in 
America?”

In the traditionally liberal city of Ann Arbor, two alleged incidents of 
ethnic intimidation and religious bias in a week is unusual, said Detective Lt 
Matthew Lige of the Ann Arbor police department.

“Certainly Ann Arbor, as a community that prides itself on its diversity, in 
race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, all those type of things,” he said. 
“So, for us to have two incidents that fit in this category is unusual and 
certainly [with] the political climate that we’re in right now, it’s 
concerning.”

Michigan and New York are home to some of the largest concentrations of 
Muslims in the US. But it is impossible to say with certainty how many Muslims 
there are in the country as the Census Bureau does not ask questions about 
faith. Estimates vary from as few as 3 million to as many as 8 million. Within 
that overall demographic, there is huge diversity in terms of geography, 
religious identity and race-cum-ethnicity, which renders any generalizations 
about the “Muslim community” in America perilous.

Is it correct that Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has “never advocated for any 
registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion”?

Here’s what he told NBC News in November last year 
<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-would-certainly-implement-muslim-database>:

Donald Trump “would certainly implement” a database system tracking Muslims in 
the United States, the Republican front-runner told NBC News on Thursday night.

“I would certainly implement that. Absolutely,” Trump said in Newton, Iowa, in 
between campaign town halls.

“There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases,” he added. “We should 
have a lot of systems.”

When asked whether Muslims would be legally obligated to sign into the 
database, Trump responded, “They have to be – they have to be.” Later, Trump 
was repeatedly asked to explain the difference between requiring Muslims to 
enter their information into a database and making Jewish people register in 
Nazi Germany. He responded four times by saying: “You tell me.”
 
Jason Miller, communications director for the Trump transition team, has 
released this statement in response to reports that theincoming administration 
has been considering a register for Muslims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/17/muslim-americans-donald-trump-hate-crimes-surveillance>
