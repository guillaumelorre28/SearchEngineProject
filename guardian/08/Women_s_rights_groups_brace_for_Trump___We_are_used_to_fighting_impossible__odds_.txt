Women and advocacy groups are preparing for the most serious assault on 
reproductive rights in decades after Hillary Clinton, the first female nominee 
of a major party, lost the presidential election toDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

Trump’s election, in tandem with an undivided Congress under Republican 
control, 33 GOP governors and an open seat on the supreme court with the 
possibility of more appointments, has cast serious uncertainty about the future 
of abortion in the US, advocates say.

“It’s really bad – bad as we’ve ever seen it,” said Donna Crane, the 
vice-president of policy for Naral, a pro-choice advocacy group.

Like many of his policy views, Trump’s stance on women’s reproductive rights 
has shifted throughout his campaign, includingthree contradictory positions on 
abortion in three hours 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/03/donald-trumps-ever-shifting-positions-on-abortion/>
. In an interview on Sunday with CBS’s 60 Minutes, Trump reiterated his vow to 
appoint conservative and pro-life supreme court justices, which could gradually 
restrict abortion access and even lead to overturning Roe v Wade, the 
43-year-old ruling that legalized abortion in the US. (Trump, who appears to 
have anincongruous understanding 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-gay-marriage-abortion-supreme-court/>
 of how the supreme court operates, had previously suggested this would happen “
automatically 
<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/trump-ill-appoint-supreme-court-justices-to-overturn-roe-v-wade-abortion-case.html>
”.)

The prospect of overturning Roe v Wade has set off alarm bells among women’s 
health advocates, who are already fighting to hold the line against an 
avalanche of regulations meant to restrict access to abortions at the state 
level. But experts saying dismantling the precedent would be much more 
difficult than Trump seems to think it will be.

“Roe has withstood the test of time, over 40 years,” said Kelly Baden, interim 
senior director of US policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive 
Rights, noting that US supreme court justices take precedents seriously even 
when they disagree with them. “It has survived anti-choice administrations, 
including ones that have pushed to appoint anti-choice justices to the supreme 
court.”

He has no idea what that actually means, as far as how real people live their 
lives
Amy Hagstrom Miller, Whole Women’s Health 
In the interview, Trump said that if Roe v Wade is overturned, then women 
would “have to go to another state”. Asked if that was acceptable, he replied: 
“Well, we’ll see what happens. It’s got a long way to go.”

This was a time Trump would remember well. New York was one of the first 
states to legalize abortion in 1970, three years before Roe v Wade was decided. 
Women from other states who could afford to travel were able to receive the 
procedure. But low-income women and women of color were disproportionately 
affected.

“This comment tells us that he has no idea what that actually means, as far as 
how real people live their lives,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the CEO of Whole 
Woman’s Health, which was the lead plaintiff in a supreme court case that 
struck down a Texas law that would have closed all but 10 of the state’s 
abortion clinics.

“Women in the Rio Grande Valley couldn’t even make it 200 miles to get to a 
clinic, now he’s suggesting they would have to travel out of state?”

Women attempting to perform their own abortions was also more common 
<https://www.guttmacher.org/about/gpr/2003/03/lessons-roe-will-past-be-prologue>
 and sometimes deadly, and the practice continues today among women with 
limited access to clinics.

Trump has also promised to sign a ban on abortion after 20 weeks’ gestation – 
or several weeks before viability – into law. The bill is based on the 
scientifically unproven argument that after 20 weeks, fetuses can feel pain, 
and it bans abortion before many women learn about severe fetal anomalies.

Hagstrom Miller said that above all she’s concerned about the culture a Trump 
presidency might normalize.

“The violent, hateful language he uses about women and people of color 
terrifies me,” she said. “I’ve seen this in my work: when that kind of language 
and rhetoric lands on the wrong ears it can be an invitation for violence.”

Four states – Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota – have 
laws that wouldautomatically ban abortion

<https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe>
would retain their “pre-Roe bans”, all of which would take effect after the 
ruling.Just seven states 
<https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe> 
have laws in place that would preserve the right of women to access an abortion 
if Roe was struck down.

That Trump would prioritize undermining Roe v Wade is concerning, advocates 
say, and a clear indication of how he plans to appease Republicans in Congress 
and the cultural conservatives who ended up supporting his candidacy over 
Clinton’s.

“Roe exists as long as five justices say it does,” Naral’s Crane said. “When 
five justices no longer agree, it’s Katy bar the door.”

Though Trump’s view on women’s health is hard to pin down, there is no 
wavering forMike Pence <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence>, the 
vice-president elect who is ardently anti-abortion. The Indiana governor was 
the architect of the first bill that blocked federal funds from going to 
Planned Parenthood, a women’s health organization that provides contraception, 
medical services and abortions at hundreds of clinics across the country.

The silver lining is that we have a really powerful organizing tool for 2020

During the course of his campaign, Trump has long threatened to dismantle the 
Affordable Care Act (ACA), which provides access to free birth control and 
annual well-woman examinations. In recent days, however, he has suggested he 
might not repeal it entirely. He has also threatened to defund Planned 
Parenthood, which provides women’s health services at hundreds of clinics 
across the country and to codify the Hyde Amendment, a 40-year provision that 
prevents federal funds from being used to pay for abortions.

In reaction to Trump’s agenda, a “Women’s march on Washington 
<https://www.facebook.com/events/2169332969958991/permalink/2172828586276096/>”

intrauterine devices, commonly known as IUDs, while it is still covered under 
the ACA.

Diane Horvath-Cosper, a reproductive health advocacy fellow at Physicians for 
Reproductive Health, said doctors across the US have reported an uptick in 
patients concerned about losing free access to birth control under aTrump 
administration <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration>.

“I really would hate to see a situation where people are so afraid of losing 
their coverage that they make a health care decision they would not make 
otherwise,” Horvath-Cosper said.

Perhaps hardest to accept is just how different the battles might have been if 
Clinton had won the election. In a historic first, the Democrats approved a 
platform at theDemocratic national convention in Philadelphia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/democrats-convention-day-one-philadelphia-drama>
 that explicitly called for elected officials to overturn the Hyde amendment. 
On that front, advocates will now be fighting to keep Hyde from being codified, 
which would make it much harder to abolish.

“The silver lining is that we have a really powerful organizing tool for 
2020,” said Destiny Lopez, the co-director of All Above All, a network of 
reproductive rights advocates that is leading the push to repeal Hyde.

She added: “The election really brought a daunting challenge to our doorstep 
but we women – low income people, people of color, immigrants – we are used to 
fighting against impossible odds.”
