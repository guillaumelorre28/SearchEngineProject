Australia wins very easily...

A 92 run win for Australia after being 5/78: a heroic turnaround or an 
indictment on the opposition? While the home side deserve huge credit for the 
clinical cricket they played from the 25th over, it’s hard not to feel 
disappointed in Pakistan’s batting display. Here they played themselves into an 
eminently winning position, and ultimately suffered a huge defeat. How that 
positions them, Australia and fans for the remaining four matches is legitimate 
cause for concern.

The match wasn’t without its moments, of course. If you can’t stop to 
appreciate the deftness in Mohammad Amir’s dismissal of David Warner,give it 
away, as they say. It was Amir, Ali and Wasim that largely restricted Australia 
early, and gave Pakistan a better-than-fighting chance to win this game.

But on an uncharacteristically slow Gabba wicket, a mid-90s-esque fightback 
from under-seige Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade restored Australia’s 
innings to something approaching par. Actually, his first fifty was very last 
century, and his last fifty was very new millennium. It’s the best compliment I 
can give it. Finishing at a run-a-ball even hundred, Wade showed his capability 
with the bat; timely ahead of an Indian tour where many continue to question 
his credentials to be ‘on the plane’.

He was well supported by Glenn Maxwell, who enjoyed his best day out in 
Australian colours for a little while. Many will be disappointed by his 
dismissal, but whether Maxwell will is probably a better question.

Having ultimately overachieved, Australia carried that momentum into the 
second innings. Pakistan started carefully and, mathematically at least, 
remained on course with wickets in hand to properly challenge Australia’s 
score. A hamstring injury to Azhar commenced a regular fall of wickets though, 
and their batsmen never appeared to show the combination of power and nous 
required to dominate one day bowling attacks in 2016. Wickets always looked 
inevitable, and Pakistan succumbed well short in the end. Australia shared the 
wickets: Faulker took four, Cummins three, Starc two, Marsh one, and Head was 
economically brilliant – conceding only 28 from his ten overs. Bill Stanlake, 
in his debut, unfortunately fell ill three overs into his spell, and wasn’t 
required again. Here’s hoping he’s offered another shot.

Thanks for sticking with me throughout the second innings, and cheers for your 
thoughts and observations – they’re always welcome, especially during the 
middle overs.

below. See you next time.

Australia 268/9 defeat Pakistan 176 by 92 runs

A quick finish relieves all, I suspect. A few thoughts to follow...

Wicket! Riaz c Starc b Cummins 6 (8)

And there it is. It’s another slower ball, this time from Cummins. Riaz slogs, 
but connects poorly. It’s caught by Starc; Cummins finishes with three wickets.

42nd over: Pakistan 174-9 (Riaz 5, Ali 0)

So Faulkner is coming away with the figures here, but I suspect the main 
conversation will be about Pakistan’s meek resistance. I doubt he’ll get 
another over here, as Smith just misses out on taking one over his head that 
would have given Faulkner five.

Wicket! Amir c Maxwell b Faulkner 8 (10)

Amir had to go, as they say, but couldn’t. He too is duped by a Faulkner 
slower ball and pops one to Maxwell at extra-cover, who moves back to take the 
easy catch. Faulkner has four; one wicket to go.

40th over: Pakistan 163-8 (Amir 2)

It was a skilful over from Faulkner, rewarded with a wicket. The ball prior, 
it should be noted, saw Faulknerspill a very sharp chance off his own bowling. 
I doubt it will bother him given the events of the following ball. The end is 
near here.

Wicket! Azhar c Warner b Faulkner 24

Azhar falls as Faulkner claims another. Batting deep in his crease, he’s 
fooled by one of Faulkner’s multiple slower balls. He attempts to pick-up the 
Tasmanian’s delivery but only finds Warner at deep square, who scurries in to 
take a good catch. It’s a catch that is probably better than it seems, because 
he did all the work before taking it; great speed, great anticipation, great 
balance. Was Azhar’s second innings – given his injury – worth it?

39th over: Pakistan 159-7 (Amir 0, Azhar 22)

Marsh adds respectability to his figures, and his bowling has warranted it. 
Next in is Mohommad Amir, so we can at least expect some fireworks. He starts 
with a huge swish at Marsh, but misses. His smile that followed didn’t – he’s 
great to watch, even when he flops.

Wicket! Wasim c Warner b Marsh 29 (36)

Marsh produces the slower ball and does enough to elicit another mistimed 
hoick out to deep mid-wicket. Warner runs in ten to fifteen metres and takes a 
comfortable catch at hip-height. Marsh clenches his fists in satisfaction; he 
does deserve a wicket.

38th over: Pakistan 157-6 (Wasim 29, Azhar 20)

Faulkner hits his mark straight away. One of his elaborate back-of-the-hand 
slower balls comes out perfectly, causing Wasim to spoon it, almost comically, 
into the offside ring. Despite four men in the vicinity, none were positioned 
well enough to get close. Wry grins ensue. There’s three from the over, as this 
slow, aimless march carries on.

37th over: Pakistan 154-6 (Wasim 28, Azhar 18)

A rare, big over for Pakistan – eleven from this one. I won’t call it a 
comeback, but nice to see some initiative late in the piece. Marsh’s copybook 
is slightly blighted; I’m sure he’ll be fine. Faulkner now back into the attack.

36th over: Pakistan 143-6 (Wasim 19, Azhar 16)

Ten overs for 28 runs, that’s Travis Head’s return after another over 
conceding just two runs. His bowling is clearly preferred to Maxwell’s: an 
indication of his standing ahead of India? He’s done himself great favours to 
support that view tonight.

35th over: Pakistan 141-6 (Wasim 18, Azhar 15)

Getting a little depressing here. Azhar is almost completely incapacitated 
from a running standpoint, and they can’t hit any boundaries. The enormity of 
the likely loss of Azhar from the series is starting to hit home; this, after 
the return home of vice-captain Sarfraz is pretty disastrous. Starc is 
attacking the stumps but can’t get through. There’s just under 130 needed from 
90 deliveries here for Pakistan. The run rate has hoisted itself above eight 
and a half.

34th over: Pakistan 138-6 (Wasim 15, Azhar 15)

It’s all about Azhar here. Smith won’t give him a single, and Azhar is clearly 
in great pain – not just when running, but even as he prods forward to play a 
stroke. Away from Azhar injury-watch, Wasim survives what looked a pretty 
decent shouot for lbw at the conclusion of the over. Australia has no reviews

33rd over: Pakistan 135-6 (Wasim 13, Azhar 14)

After Starc rips through Nawaz we see captain Azhar Ali return to the crease. 
He is clearly injured, and cannot run at anything approaching full pace. It’s a 
hobble, more than anything else. Let’s see how he goes.

Wicket! Nawaz b Starc 1 (9)

A classic Starc wicket. Full, fast, and enough in-dip to beat the swinging 
blade of Nawaz. The batsman did attempt to hit the ball to Fortitude Valley, 
but he was truly beaten.Azhar Ali is back in!

32nd over: Pakistan 133-5 (Wasim 13, Nawaz 1)

It’s Travis Head, what do you expect? Another miserly six from the South 
Australian, with two from it. He just chews up overs before you can blink. He’s 
at less than three an over now – some going when the opposition need nearly 
eight an over.

31st over: Pakistan 130-5 (Wasim 11, Nawaz 3)

Cummins clearly adopts a shorter length to new batsmen and he’s no different 
here. Nawaz eventually gets a single down to third man before Wasim sees out 
the over. It’s looking pretty tough from here for Pakistan.

Wicket! Rizwan c Marsh b Cummins 21 (44)

Straight after drinks! That hurts. Rizwan tried to pull Cummins mightily but 
mistimed it completely. Mitch Marsh at deep midwicket made good ground, 
steadied himself, bobbled his first attempt then grabbed it one hand – 
semi-diving – with the second. It was one of those catches that look great 
because of the initial stuff-up. Marsh smiled knowingly, which is pretty 
endearing to be honest.

30th over: Pakistan 125-4 (Wasim 9, Rizwan 20)

Huge credit to Head here, he is clearly exceptionally difficult to get away. 
The Both batsmen milk a couple to deep point and there’s a leg bye to finish. 
Head is going at three an over; it’s invaluable stuff for Australia. Even as we 
wait for Stanlake to have a chance to bowl again (he spent time off, so he 
needs to wait a while), will we get a chance to see Maxwell?

Cramp update: there’s another one, this time it’s Rizwan. We pause for more 
treatment.

29th over: Pakistan 125-4 (Wasim 9, Rizwan 20)

Bang! Wasim clears the front foot and whacks Cummins straight back over his 
head for six – so straight it clears the sightscreen and lands on that black 
sheeting that extends the colour contrast for batsmen. He top edges a pull shot 
a few balls later before Cummins responds with a few dots. Better from the men 
in dark(er) green.

28th over: Pakistan 116-4 (Wasim 2, Rizwan 18)

Late in the over Rizwan treats us to a mini-festival of lap sweeping. Or is it 
a mere paddle? What is a paddle and what is a lap? Anyway, five runs come from 
the over. Not that many but not too few. Pakistan are still in the contest.

27th over: Pakistan 113-4 (Wasim 1, Rizwan 16)

The run rate approaches 7 an over as Marsh completes another set of bowling 
tightlines. Rizwan does show some initiative late in the over, charging Marsh 
vigorously and slapping him forward of mid-wicket for two. Oh no, Head’s back 
on. Bye.

26th over: Pakistan 109-4 (Wasim 0, Rizwan 13) 

The game breaks open that little bit further. It must be remembered that 
Pakistan are nominally without their captain Azhar, who retired hurt earlier 
tonight; it may as well be five-for. Australia were thirty runs ahead of 
Pakistan at this equivalent position, and they were thought to be struggling. 
It’s hard to see how Pakistan changes this. Then again, funny things can happen 
in Brisbane.

Wicket! Babar c Smith b Cummins 33 (46)

Cummins returns, and so do a flurry of strokes. Unfortunately for Pakistan 
they still don’t yield a hefty number of runs. Babar, attempting yet another 
glide, runs one straight to Steve Smith’s breadbasket at first slip. Cummins 
has his first wicket of the night, as Pakistan’s hopes nosedive that little bit 
further.

25th over: Pakistan 102-3 (Babar 29, Rizwan 10)

Only three off this Marsh over again, and one can just sense the pressure 
building. Runs are mainly arriving via glides to third man and scurried inside 
edges. Babar, the senior partner, will be wanting (needing) to up the ante soon.

24th over: Pakistan 102-3 (Babar 29, Rizwan 10)

Head has bowled five overs for a measly 13 runs, it’s Imad Wasim-esque. As he 
continues to jam the ball from around the wicket into Pakistan blind spots, 
discussion about the relative merits of his bowling as compared to Glenn 
Maxwell’s commences on TV. It’s an interesting one. Head has certainly been 
given first crack here. Any views out there?

23rd over: Pakistan 98-3 (Babar 28, Rizwan 7)

Mitchell Marsh’s lines are so straight that he could run through the narrowest 
corridor of wet paint and emerge from a delivery dry. He’s miserly here in this 
over, as Pakistan appear struggling to find run scoring answers. Clarke et al 
praise their patience, but I think Australia are just defending well.

22nd over: Pakistan 94-3 (Babar 25, Rizwan 6)

Head retains his crampy, leg-stump line and it works. When given his bowling 
notes, I’d be surprised if the word ‘squeeze’ didn’t turn up on at least six 
occasions. Only one from this over and Marsh is back on.

21st over: Pakistan 86-3 (Babar 22, Rizwan 2)

We’re in to full ODI middle-overs cricket now. Mitch Marsh is on, Australia 
have three men out, and Marsh bowls straight and tightly enough to render the 
over a quiet one.

Can anyone help with Paul’s question below? 

Paul (@flataboveashop) 
@sjjperry <https://twitter.com/sjjperry> How many other Aus players have an 
ODI hundred off the last ball? Think Martyn did it around 02/03, but I might've 
imagined that

20th over: Pakistan 91-3 (Babar 23, Rizwan 5)

Maxwell is in under the lid at short-leg to Head, signifying more than 
anything that Australia are after wickets. Head is, speaking of wickets, coming 
around them, angling in to the batsmen in an attempt to cramp them. Both Babar 
and Rizwan are happy to take singles as they come, which is probably a sound 
strategy at this stage. It’s apparent they’ll need to use the majority of the 
fifty overs on offer here to be a chance of chasing these runs down.

19th over: Pakistan 86-3 (Babar 22, Rizwan 2)

Starc’s gone to another level here. The quick smells blood and enacts the 
junior cricket equivalent of ‘at his toes or at his nose’. One ball rises 
markedly past Babar, while another finds the boundary via, not before Babar’s 
leg stump was asking to be hit. Here comes Head.

18th over: Pakistan 81-3 (Babar 18, Rizwan 1)

See my last description of Head’s over and repeat. They’re coming in at about 
88km/hr, and then it’s over. Two from it.

17th over: Pakistan 79-3 (Babar 17, Rizwan 0)

Starc really gave it to Akmal there. Necessary? Probably not. Also not really 
the point though, is it? He just kept yelling at him; he looked quite desperate 
for eye contact to be honest. Aren’t we all? Anyway, Mitch is in on the act now 
after a mixed start. Pakistan, effectively four down, are in trouble.

Wicket! Akmal c Head b Starc 17 (25)

Akmal’s gone! Starc pitches short and Akmal, trying to heave him wide of 
mid-on, strikes the ball high on the splice. It lobs gently to Travis Head who 
takes a soft ‘mark’ above his head, requiring a little leap in the process. 
Easy to say now, but a terrible shot in the circumstances.

16th over: Pakistan 73-2 (Babar 16, Akmal 12)

Travis Head rolls through a 35 second over, conceding two singles. The bowling 
is flat, fast, and darty. It’s also hard to think and write anything before 
it’s over. I will strive.

15th over: Pakistan 71-2 (Babar 15, Akmal 11)

Six from the over here as Akmal starts to find his feet. He gets some luck as 
Akmal throws his hands at a wide Starc delivery; it flies over gully for four. 
He then helps Starc behind square for two. Pakistan need about six an over from 
here so overs like these are helpful.

On Azhar: Mark Taylor speculates that Azhar has torn his hamstring; you’d 
imagine that would end his evening. If it’s tight, will he bat? What if they 
need four off three?

14th over: Pakistan 65-2 (Babar 15, Akmal 5)

A tighter over from Cummins, now subject of discussion about his Indian tour 
chances on TV. Here he retains his back-of-a-length strategy, conceding only 
two from the over.

He should take wickets for his State in first class matches before he’s 
considered for his country, I would have thought.

Separately, if you’ve just joined us and are wondering about the score, to 
repeat,Azhar Ali earlier retired hurt - presumably due to cramp, though we’re 
not sure. I’ll update his status when I have the info.

That’s drinks.

13th over: Pakistan 63-2 (Babar 14, Akmal 4)

A glorious straight-drive for four from Babar greets Faulkner’s first ball. 
They always say an early boundary is best (Why? A boundary at any stage has the 
same mathematical properties). A neat tuck off the hips garners him another 
three, before Akmal then biffs Faulkner over mid-on for four. But we now have a
review!Akmal shuffles across the crease and misses an attempt to flick one 
fine. The umpire says not out, but Matt Wade is adamant as the stump 
microphones catch him saying ‘it definitely pitched in line!’. Akmal waits 
nervously.

It pitched outside leg. The umpire was right. Wade’s conviction was 
convincing, but, well, misguided.

12th over: Pakistan 50-2 (Babar 7, Akmal 0)

Babar produces a graceful checked-drive to pick up three early in Cummins’ 
over, before Akmal takes his tally to eight balls without a run. He’s thrilled 
us in Australia before, can he do it tonight? He really wanders across his 
crease; is an affliction only seen early in his innings or an affect picked up 
in recent years? Please advise.

11th over: Pakistan 47-2 (Babar 4, Akmal 0)

The scales tip a little in Australia’s favour after that one. Faulkner, so far 
the pick of Australia’s bowlers, knocks over Hafeez and confines Pakistan to 
accepting a wicket-maiden. Umar Akmal is the new batsman - always great to 
watch.

Wicket! Hafeez c Wade b Faulkner 4 (7)

That’s two for Faulkner. Hafeez drives ambitiously at a Faulkner delivery that 
offered some width, but was on a pretty decent length, it must be said. He 
succeeds only in providing a healthy edge to a well-balanced Matt Wade, who 
moves smartly to his right to take the catch. Pakistan in a bit of bother now.

10th over: Pakistan 47-1 (Babar 4, Hafeez 4)

A good over for Pakistan, whose two new batsmen reap eight from a wayward 
Cummins over. Babar’s upper cut forward of point the pick of the strokes. 
Australia have bowled better than this, and will hope to tighten up proceedings 
from here.

9th over: Pakistan 39-1 (Babar 0, Hafeez 1)

The over finally ends. There was a wicket, a batsman retiring hurt, and umpire 
Shamsuddin called over after five balls. He quickly realised his error and 
ensured the correct completion of the over, even if everything else has felt a 
little ramshackle.

Azhar Ali retires hurt 12 (27)

9th over: Pakistan 38-1 (Azhar 12, Hafeez 1)

Following his treatment for what appeared to be cramp, Azhar attempts to run 
again. He makes the 22 yards safely, but he’s clearly in great discomfort. With 
a wave of the hand he beckons new batsman, Babar, on to the field. Just like 
thatAzhar leaves the field! It changes the complexion of the game, no doubt.

9th over: Pakistan 38-1 (Azhar 12)

The first one falls! After a ten minute over, Sharjeel attempts to hammer 
Faulkner over mid-on but doesn’tget it at all. He toes it to mid-on, where

8th over: Pakistan 38-0 (Azhar 12, Sharjeel 18)

In the absence of meaningful team context, some intriguing sub-plots remain 
here. Cummins, a player some tip for India, replaces Stanlake and immediately 
has Azhar hopping with a shortish length. The Pakistan captain counter-punches 
with a jab through the onside - it was notionally a front-foot shot, but it 
weight only. He is well back in his crease. He’s then on the ground, evidently 
cramping. So much cramping on both sides today(he says as he swigs a beer in 
his air-conditioned Melbourne home). A good five minutes elapse, with Azhar 
surrounded by an endless procession of medical staff, before Azhar is ready to 
go. It prompts predictable indignation from previously-fit Nine commentators.

7th over: Pakistan 35-0 (Azhar 10, Sharjeel 18)

Faulkner’s now into the attack and it’s fair to say early points are with the 
visitors here. They hover just below five an over but every over without the 
loss of a wicket probably tips the equation in their favour. Having said that, 
this match shows it’s not an easy wicket to ‘get in’ on, so they’ll want to 
make the most of their start. After a single to both batsmen, Sharjeel lofts 
Faulkner wide of mid-on before the Tasmanian beats him outside off. It’s six 
from the over.

6th over: Pakistan 29-0 (Azhar 9, Sharjeel 13)

Sharjeel picks Stanlake up off his hip, pirouetting gracefully as he lifts the 
Australian for six. Mitchelle Starc athletically plucks the ball, one-handed, 
but alas he’s over the rope. A few balls later Stanlake strikes Sharjeel fair 
on the top of crest of the helmet; the ball flies away for a leg bye. The 
batsman appears fine, but it was a hefty blow.

Stanlake then takes an extended breather. He crouches to his haunches, 
breathing deeply. Heat exhaustion? A quick look at Google shows it is 30 
degrees there; who knows. Of course, Stanlake’s BBL form largely triggered his 
selection - he’s bowled three overs now, how he handles a remaining five to 
seven will be interesting to see. For now, he’s left the field looking a little 
worse for wear. Guessing dehydration.

5th over: Pakistan 18-0 (Azhar 6, Sharjeel 6)

Opening batsmen from both sides made labouring starts, perhaps suggesting some 
difficulty in the Gabba wicket. Here Pakistan take five from an 
again-inconsistent Starc over. He’s hitting the high-140 mark, but he’s still 
both sides of the stumps. A great diving save from Cummins at mid on prevents a 
Pakistan boundary.

4th over: Pakistan 13-0 (Azhar 6, Sharjeel 1)

A really subdued start here, it has to be said. Stanlake can’t shift his leg 
stump line to the left-handed Sharjeel, though his swing seems to make it 
difficult for the Pakistan opener to lay bat on ball. Sharjeel eventually gets 
it right for a single to get off the mark after seven deliveries. It’s a 
straight-up mid-90s start to this challenging mid-90s chase. Pakistan are 
measured, assured and risk-free. Australia’s bowlers still searching for 
consistency.

3rd over: Pakistan 11-0 (Azhar 6, Sharjeel 0)

A mixed bag from Starc - a good one, a a short one, a few wide ones, and both 
sides of the wicket. Azhar picks him off through the off-side for a couple of 
two’s, before one absolutely rears from short of a length, rising well over the 
now-cramping Matt Wade, screaming to the boundary. Starc, despite conceding 
four runs for his team, looks literally elated.

On a separate note, the first comment comes in from Newcastle Person: 

‘I like Ian Chappell, but listening to him repeatedly say “Australia is going 
to try to win this with their quickies” is just a little surreal.’

Cheers for that, Newcastle Person. Completely agree.

2nd over: Pakistan 2-0 (Azhar 2, Sharjeel 0)

‘Big’ Billy Stanlake (imaginative, as always) finds some early swing, though 
the line and length are a little wanting. He has a huge gather before releasing 
the ball, his leap reminiscent of Neil Armstrong on the moon. He eventually 
fixes up his line and ties Azhar to the crease deep into the over. Bowling for 
Australia with two first class matches to your name cannot be easy. Stanlake 
completes his over, conceding only one from it. He’ll ‘take it’, as they say.

1st over: Pakistan 1-0 (Azhar 1, Sharjeel 0)

The shadows lengthen over the Gabba arena; Australia commences with two slips 
and a gully as Starc starts with a full length in pursuit of his 
occasionally-deadly movement. He does seem to bowl faster with the white ball. 
Azhar gets one to third man through a thick outside edge and Sharjeel can’t 
exploit two leg-side deliveries from Starc. We’re away. Stanlake from the other 
end!

Sam Perry

Hello and welcome all to this - the good ship OBO - ahead of the second 
innings of this probably forgettable one dayer. That’s not a positive way to 
start is it? My apologies. I will say this though: for all the hoopla about the 
future of one day cricket and its place in an ever-crowded schedule in the 
modern era, that first innings had nearly all the hallmarks of a classic 
mid-90s total. There was a small part of me quietly hoping for an old-school 
chase of just over 200 (let’s say 218) that would ebb and flow throughout. 
Instead, modernity reared its spectacular head in the form of a run-a-ball 
hundred to Matt Wade. Almost everything about his innings wasrearguard, except 
his outstanding score. 100 off 100, a numerical dream.

I’ll be back for the first ball of the innings shortly. Would love to hear 
from you, so please get in touch at sam.perry.freelance@guardian.co.uk or on 
Twitter: @sjjperry. Catch you then.

Pakistan need 269 in 50 overs to win

Well, what an innings from Matthew Wade. He timed the rescue to perfection. 
Stayed patient, played himself in, didn’t waste any of the innings by going too 
early. Then was able to cash in fully late in the piece, and keep his composure 
despite wickets falling at the other end.

Glenn Maxwell was his initial partner in crime, making 60 and forming a 
partnership with Wade of 82. Then Wade had to do most of it on his own, in 
brief combinations with Cummins, Starc and Stanlake.

But what a disappointment for Pakistan. Amir bowled beautifully to start the 
innings, Wasim and Hafeez and Nawaz were tight through the middle, Hasan picked 
up important wickets. But they couldn’t finish the game off! They had Australia 
5-78, then 7-170, and couldn’t bowl them out for a 200-odd score that would 
have made for a fairly straightforward chase.

Instead, Australia recovered to 268, a very solid ODI total even in the modern 
era, and with Pakistan’s batting liable to be suspect on this sort of surface 
and against Australia’s style of fast bowling, it may well be enough. Really, 
it should be enough. It will take a fine performance from Pakistan to take this 
game back, and generally when a team has let a game slip this badly, the 
disappointment of that tends to flow on into a poor performance in their other 
discipline.


We shall see if these gloomy prognostications come to pass, or whether a 
glorious new era of optimism is about to rise shining like the armour of the 
ancients above a peaceful and happy land. Sam Perry will be your guide for that 
adventure; follow him as you have me, and whatever you do, do not look back 
over your shoulder as you leave Hades. Geoff Lemon bidding you a fond farewell.

Australia wins very easily...

A 92 run win for Australia after being 5/78: a heroic turnaround or an 
indictment on the opposition? While the home side deserve huge credit for the 
clinical cricket they played from the 25th over, it’s hard not to feel 
disappointed in Pakistan’s batting display. Here they played themselves into an 
eminently winning position, and ultimately suffered a huge defeat. How that 
positions them, Australia and fans for the remaining four matches is legitimate 
cause for concern.

The match wasn’t without its moments, of course. If you can’t stop to 
appreciate the deftness in Mohammad Amir’s dismissal of David Warner,give it 
away, as they say. It was Amir, Ali and Wasim that largely restricted Australia 
early, and gave Pakistan a better-than-fighting chance to win this game.

But on an uncharacteristically slow Gabba wicket, a mid-90s-esque fightback 
from under-seige Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade restored Australia’s 
innings to something approaching par. Actually, his first fifty was very last 
century, and his last fifty was very new millennium. It’s the best compliment I 
can give it. Finishing at a run-a-ball even hundred, Wade showed his capability 
with the bat; timely ahead of an Indian tour where many continue to question 
his credentials to be ‘on the plane’.

He was well supported by Glenn Maxwell, who enjoyed his best day out in 
Australian colours for a little while. Many will be disappointed by his 
dismissal, but whether Maxwell will is probably a better question.

Having ultimately overachieved, Australia carried that momentum into the 
second innings. Pakistan started carefully and, mathematically at least, 
remained on course with wickets in hand to properly challenge Australia’s 
score. A hamstring injury to Azhar commenced a regular fall of wickets though, 
and their batsmen never appeared to show the combination of power and nous 
required to dominate one day bowling attacks in 2016. Wickets always looked 
inevitable, and Pakistan succumbed well short in the end. Australia shared the 
wickets: Faulker took four, Cummins three, Starc two, Marsh one, and Head was 
economically brilliant – conceding only 28 from his ten overs. Bill Stanlake, 
in his debut, unfortunately fell ill three overs into his spell, and wasn’t 
required again. Here’s hoping he’s offered another shot.

Thanks for sticking with me throughout the second innings, and cheers for your 
thoughts and observations – they’re always welcome, especially during the 
middle overs.

below. See you next time.

Matthew Wade century helps Australia defeat Pakistan in first ODI

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/13/matthew-wade-century-helps-australia-defeat-pakistan-in-first-odi> 
A quick finish relieves all, I suspect. A few thoughts to follow...
 
And there it is. It’s another slower ball, this time from Cummins. Riaz slogs, 
but connects poorly. It’s caught by Starc; Cummins finishes with three wickets.
 
42nd over: Pakistan 174-9 (Riaz 5, Ali 0)

So Faulkner is coming away with the figures here, but I suspect the main 
conversation will be about Pakistan’s meek resistance. I doubt he’ll get 
another over here, as Smith just misses out on taking one over his head that 
would have given Faulkner five.
 
Amir had to go, as they say, but couldn’t. He too is duped by a Faulkner 
slower ball and pops one to Maxwell at extra-cover, who moves back to take the 
easy catch. Faulkner has four; one wicket to go.
 
40th over: Pakistan 163-8 (Amir 2)

It was a skilful over from Faulkner, rewarded with a wicket. The ball prior, 
it should be noted, saw Faulknerspill a very sharp chance off his own bowling. 
I doubt it will bother him given the events of the following ball. The end is 
near here.
 
Azhar falls as Faulkner claims another. Batting deep in his crease, he’s 
fooled by one of Faulkner’s multiple slower balls. He attempts to pick-up the 
Tasmanian’s delivery but only finds Warner at deep square, who scurries in to 
take a good catch. It’s a catch that is probably better than it seems, because 
he did all the work before taking it; great speed, great anticipation, great 
balance. Was Azhar’s second innings – given his injury – worth it?
 
39th over: Pakistan 159-7 (Amir 0, Azhar 22)

Marsh adds respectability to his figures, and his bowling has warranted it. 
Next in is Mohommad Amir, so we can at least expect some fireworks. He starts 
with a huge swish at Marsh, but misses. His smile that followed didn’t – he’s 
great to watch, even when he flops.
 
Marsh produces the slower ball and does enough to elicit another mistimed 
hoick out to deep mid-wicket. Warner runs in ten to fifteen metres and takes a 
comfortable catch at hip-height. Marsh clenches his fists in satisfaction; he 
does deserve a wicket.
 
38th over: Pakistan 157-6 (Wasim 29, Azhar 20)

Faulkner hits his mark straight away. One of his elaborate back-of-the-hand 
slower balls comes out perfectly, causing Wasim to spoon it, almost comically, 
into the offside ring. Despite four men in the vicinity, none were positioned 
well enough to get close. Wry grins ensue. There’s three from the over, as this 
slow, aimless march carries on.
 
37th over: Pakistan 154-6 (Wasim 28, Azhar 18)

A rare, big over for Pakistan – eleven from this one. I won’t call it a 
comeback, but nice to see some initiative late in the piece. Marsh’s copybook 
is slightly blighted; I’m sure he’ll be fine. Faulkner now back into the attack.
 
36th over: Pakistan 143-6 (Wasim 19, Azhar 16)

Ten overs for 28 runs, that’s Travis Head’s return after another over 
conceding just two runs. His bowling is clearly preferred to Maxwell’s: an 
indication of his standing ahead of India? He’s done himself great favours to 
support that view tonight.
 
35th over: Pakistan 141-6 (Wasim 18, Azhar 15)

Getting a little depressing here. Azhar is almost completely incapacitated 
from a running standpoint, and they can’t hit any boundaries. The enormity of 
the likely loss of Azhar from the series is starting to hit home; this, after 
the return home of vice-captain Sarfraz is pretty disastrous. Starc is 
attacking the stumps but can’t get through. There’s just under 130 needed from 
90 deliveries here for Pakistan. The run rate has hoisted itself above eight 
and a half.
 
34th over: Pakistan 138-6 (Wasim 15, Azhar 15)

It’s all about Azhar here. Smith won’t give him a single, and Azhar is clearly 
in great pain – not just when running, but even as he prods forward to play a 
stroke. Away from Azhar injury-watch, Wasim survives what looked a pretty 
decent shouot for lbw at the conclusion of the over. Australia has no reviews 
left, so we plough on.
 
33rd over: Pakistan 135-6 (Wasim 13, Azhar 14)

After Starc rips through Nawaz we see captain Azhar Ali return to the crease. 
He is clearly injured, and cannot run at anything approaching full pace. It’s a 
hobble, more than anything else. Let’s see how he goes.
 
A classic Starc wicket. Full, fast, and enough in-dip to beat the swinging 
blade of Nawaz. The batsman did attempt to hit the ball to Fortitude Valley, 
but he was truly beaten.Azhar Ali is back in!
 
32nd over: Pakistan 133-5 (Wasim 13, Nawaz 1)

It’s Travis Head, what do you expect? Another miserly six from the South 
Australian, with two from it. He just chews up overs before you can blink. He’s 
at less than three an over now – some going when the opposition need nearly 
eight an over.
 
31st over: Pakistan 130-5 (Wasim 11, Nawaz 3)

Cummins clearly adopts a shorter length to new batsmen and he’s no different 
here. Nawaz eventually gets a single down to third man before Wasim sees out 
the over. It’s looking pretty tough from here for Pakistan.
 
Straight after drinks! That hurts. Rizwan tried to pull Cummins mightily but 
mistimed it completely. Mitch Marsh at deep midwicket made good ground, 
steadied himself, bobbled his first attempt then grabbed it one hand – 
semi-diving – with the second. It was one of those catches that look great 
because of the initial stuff-up. Marsh smiled knowingly, which is pretty 
endearing to be honest.

30th over: Pakistan 125-4 (Wasim 9, Rizwan 20)

Huge credit to Head here, he is clearly exceptionally difficult to get away. 
The Both batsmen milk a couple to deep point and there’s a leg bye to finish. 
Head is going at three an over; it’s invaluable stuff for Australia. Even as we 
wait for Stanlake to have a chance to bowl again (he spent time off, so he 
needs to wait a while), will we get a chance to see Maxwell?

Cramp update: there’s another one, this time it’s Rizwan. We pause for more 
treatment.
 
29th over: Pakistan 125-4 (Wasim 9, Rizwan 20)

Bang! Wasim clears the front foot and whacks Cummins straight back over his 
head for six – so straight it clears the sightscreen and lands on that black 
sheeting that extends the colour contrast for batsmen. He top edges a pull shot 
a few balls later before Cummins responds with a few dots. Better from the men 
in dark(er) green.
 
28th over: Pakistan 116-4 (Wasim 2, Rizwan 18)

Late in the over Rizwan treats us to a mini-festival of lap sweeping. Or is it 
a mere paddle? What is a paddle and what is a lap? Anyway, five runs come from 
the over. Not that many but not too few. Pakistan are still in the contest.
 
27th over: Pakistan 113-4 (Wasim 1, Rizwan 16)

The run rate approaches 7 an over as Marsh completes another set of bowling 
tightlines. Rizwan does show some initiative late in the over, charging Marsh 
vigorously and slapping him forward of mid-wicket for two. Oh no, Head’s back 
on. Bye.
 
26th over: Pakistan 109-4 (Wasim 0, Rizwan 13) 

The game breaks open that little bit further. It must be remembered that 
Pakistan are nominally without their captain Azhar, who retired hurt earlier 
tonight; it may as well be five-for. Australia were thirty runs ahead of 
Pakistan at this equivalent position, and they were thought to be struggling. 
It’s hard to see how Pakistan changes this. Then again, funny things can happen 
in Brisbane.
 
Cummins returns, and so do a flurry of strokes. Unfortunately for Pakistan 
they still don’t yield a hefty number of runs. Babar, attempting yet another 
glide, runs one straight to Steve Smith’s breadbasket at first slip. Cummins 
has his first wicket of the night, as Pakistan’s hopes nosedive that little bit 
further.
 
25th over: Pakistan 102-3 (Babar 29, Rizwan 10)

Only three off this Marsh over again, and one can just sense the pressure 
building. Runs are mainly arriving via glides to third man and scurried inside 
edges. Babar, the senior partner, will be wanting (needing) to up the ante soon.
 
24th over: Pakistan 102-3 (Babar 29, Rizwan 10)

Head has bowled five overs for a measly 13 runs, it’s Imad Wasim-esque. As he 
continues to jam the ball from around the wicket into Pakistan blind spots, 
discussion about the relative merits of his bowling as compared to Glenn 
Maxwell’s commences on TV. It’s an interesting one. Head has certainly been 
given first crack here. Any views out there?
 
23rd over: Pakistan 98-3 (Babar 28, Rizwan 7)

Mitchell Marsh’s lines are so straight that he could run through the narrowest 
corridor of wet paint and emerge from a delivery dry. He’s miserly here in this 
over, as Pakistan appear struggling to find run scoring answers. Clarke et al 
praise their patience, but I think Australia are just defending well.
 
22nd over: Pakistan 94-3 (Babar 25, Rizwan 6)

Head retains his crampy, leg-stump line and it works. When given his bowling 
notes, I’d be surprised if the word ‘squeeze’ didn’t turn up on at least six 
occasions. Only one from this over and Marsh is back on.
 
21st over: Pakistan 86-3 (Babar 22, Rizwan 2)

We’re in to full ODI middle-overs cricket now. Mitch Marsh is on, Australia 
have three men out, and Marsh bowls straight and tightly enough to render the 
over a quiet one.

Can anyone help with Paul’s question below? 

Paul (@flataboveashop) 
@sjjperry <https://twitter.com/sjjperry> How many other Aus players have an 
ODI hundred off the last ball? Think Martyn did it around 02/03, but I might've

20th over: Pakistan 91-3 (Babar 23, Rizwan 5)

Maxwell is in under the lid at short-leg to Head, signifying more than 
anything that Australia are after wickets. Head is, speaking of wickets, coming 
around them, angling in to the batsmen in an attempt to cramp them. Both Babar 
and Rizwan are happy to take singles as they come, which is probably a sound 
strategy at this stage. It’s apparent they’ll need to use the majority of the 
fifty overs on offer here to be a chance of chasing these runs down.
 
19th over: Pakistan 86-3 (Babar 22, Rizwan 2)

Starc’s gone to another level here. The quick smells blood and enacts the 
junior cricket equivalent of ‘at his toes or at his nose’. One ball rises 
markedly past Babar, while another finds the boundary via, not before Babar’s 
leg stump was asking to be hit. Here comes Head.
 
18th over: Pakistan 81-3 (Babar 18, Rizwan 1)

See my last description of Head’s over and repeat. They’re coming in at about 
88km/hr, and then it’s over. Two from it.
 
17th over: Pakistan 79-3 (Babar 17, Rizwan 0)

Starc really gave it to Akmal there. Necessary? Probably not. Also not really 
the point though, is it? He just kept yelling at him; he looked quite desperate 
for eye contact to be honest. Aren’t we all? Anyway, Mitch is in on the act now 
after a mixed start. Pakistan, effectively four down, are in trouble.
 
Akmal’s gone! Starc pitches short and Akmal, trying to heave him wide of 
mid-on, strikes the ball high on the splice. It lobs gently to Travis Head who 
takes a soft ‘mark’ above his head, requiring a little leap in the process. 
Easy to say now, but a terrible shot in the circumstances.
 
16th over: Pakistan 73-2 (Babar 16, Akmal 12)

Travis Head rolls through a 35 second over, conceding two singles. The bowling 
is flat, fast, and darty. It’s also hard to think and write anything before 
it’s over. I will strive.
 
15th over: Pakistan 71-2 (Babar 15, Akmal 11)

Six from the over here as Akmal starts to find his feet. He gets some luck as 
Akmal throws his hands at a wide Starc delivery; it flies over gully for four. 
He then helps Starc behind square for two. Pakistan need about six an over from 
here so overs like these are helpful.

On Azhar: Mark Taylor speculates that Azhar has torn his hamstring; you’d 
imagine that would end his evening. If it’s tight, will he bat? What if they 
need four off three?
 
14th over: Pakistan 65-2 (Babar 15, Akmal 5)

A tighter over from Cummins, now subject of discussion about his Indian tour 
chances on TV. Here he retains his back-of-a-length strategy, conceding only 
two from the over.

He should take wickets for his State in first class matches before he’s 
considered for his country, I would have thought.

Separately, if you’ve just joined us and are wondering about the score, to 
repeat,Azhar Ali earlier retired hurt - presumably due to cramp, though we’re 
not sure. I’ll update his status when I have the info.

That’s drinks.
 
13th over: Pakistan 63-2 (Babar 14, Akmal 4)

A glorious straight-drive for four from Babar greets Faulkner’s first ball. 
They always say an early boundary is best (Why? A boundary at any stage has the 
same mathematical properties). A neat tuck off the hips garners him another 
three, before Akmal then biffs Faulkner over mid-on for four. But we now have a
review!Akmal shuffles across the crease and misses an attempt to flick one 
fine. The umpire says not out, but Matt Wade is adamant as the stump 
microphones catch him saying ‘it definitely pitched in line!’. Akmal waits 
nervously.

It pitched outside leg. The umpire was right. Wade’s conviction was 
convincing, but, well, misguided.
 
12th over: Pakistan 50-2 (Babar 7, Akmal 0)

Babar produces a graceful checked-drive to pick up three early in Cummins’ 
over, before Akmal takes his tally to eight balls without a run. He’s thrilled 
us in Australia before, can he do it tonight? He really wanders across his 
crease; is an affliction only seen early in his innings or an affect picked up 
in recent years? Please advise.
 
11th over: Pakistan 47-2 (Babar 4, Akmal 0)

The scales tip a little in Australia’s favour after that one. Faulkner, so far 
the pick of Australia’s bowlers, knocks over Hafeez and confines Pakistan to 
accepting a wicket-maiden. Umar Akmal is the new batsman - always great to 
watch.
 
That’s two for Faulkner. Hafeez drives ambitiously at a Faulkner delivery that 
offered some width, but was on a pretty decent length, it must be said. He 
succeeds only in providing a healthy edge to a well-balanced Matt Wade, who 
moves smartly to his right to take the catch. Pakistan in a bit of bother now.
 
10th over: Pakistan 47-1 (Babar 4, Hafeez 4)

A good over for Pakistan, whose two new batsmen reap eight from a wayward 
Cummins over. Babar’s upper cut forward of point the pick of the strokes. 
Australia have bowled better than this, and will hope to tighten up proceedings 
from here.

9th over: Pakistan 39-1 (Babar 0, Hafeez 1)

The over finally ends. There was a wicket, a batsman retiring hurt, and umpire 
Shamsuddin called over after five balls. He quickly realised his error and 
ensured the correct completion of the over, even if everything else has felt a 
little ramshackle.
 
9th over: Pakistan 38-1 (Azhar 12, Hafeez 1)

Following his treatment for what appeared to be cramp, Azhar attempts to run 
again. He makes the 22 yards safely, but he’s clearly in great discomfort. With 
a wave of the hand he beckons new batsman, Babar, on to the field. Just like 
thatAzhar leaves the field! It changes the complexion of the game, no doubt. 
 
9th over: Pakistan 38-1 (Azhar 12)

The first one falls! After a ten minute over, Sharjeel attempts to hammer 
Faulkner over mid-on but doesn’tget it at all. He toes it to mid-on, where 
Maxwell snaffles an easy catch at head height.
 
8th over: Pakistan 38-0 (Azhar 12, Sharjeel 18)

In the absence of meaningful team context, some intriguing sub-plots remain 
here. Cummins, a player some tip for India, replaces Stanlake and immediately 
has Azhar hopping with a shortish length. The Pakistan captain counter-punches 
with a jab through the onside - it was notionally a front-foot shot, but it 
weight only. He is well back in his crease. He’s then on the ground, evidently 
cramping. So much cramping on both sides today(he says as he swigs a beer in 
his air-conditioned Melbourne home). A good five minutes elapse, with Azhar 
surrounded by an endless procession of medical staff, before Azhar is ready to 
go. It prompts predictable indignation from previously-fit Nine commentators.

7th over: Pakistan 35-0 (Azhar 10, Sharjeel 18)

Faulkner’s now into the attack and it’s fair to say early points are with the 
visitors here. They hover just below five an over but every over without the 
loss of a wicket probably tips the equation in their favour. Having said that, 
this match shows it’s not an easy wicket to ‘get in’ on, so they’ll want to 
make the most of their start. After a single to both batsmen, Sharjeel lofts 
Faulkner wide of mid-on before the Tasmanian beats him outside off. It’s six 
from the over.
 
6th over: Pakistan 29-0 (Azhar 9, Sharjeel 13)

Sharjeel picks Stanlake up off his hip, pirouetting gracefully as he lifts the 
Australian for six. Mitchelle Starc athletically plucks the ball, one-handed, 
but alas he’s over the rope. A few balls later Stanlake strikes Sharjeel fair 
on the top of crest of the helmet; the ball flies away for a leg bye. The 
batsman appears fine, but it was a hefty blow.

Stanlake then takes an extended breather. He crouches to his haunches, 
breathing deeply. Heat exhaustion? A quick look at Google shows it is 30 
degrees there; who knows. Of course, Stanlake’s BBL form largely triggered his 
selection - he’s bowled three overs now, how he handles a remaining five to 
seven will be interesting to see. For now, he’s left the field looking a little 
worse for wear. Guessing dehydration.
 
5th over: Pakistan 18-0 (Azhar 6, Sharjeel 6)

Opening batsmen from both sides made labouring starts, perhaps suggesting some 
difficulty in the Gabba wicket. Here Pakistan take five from an 
again-inconsistent Starc over. He’s hitting the high-140 mark, but he’s still 
both sides of the stumps. A great diving save from Cummins at mid on prevents a 
Pakistan boundary.
 
4th over: Pakistan 13-0 (Azhar 6, Sharjeel 1)

A really subdued start here, it has to be said. Stanlake can’t shift his leg 
stump line to the left-handed Sharjeel, though his swing seems to make it 
difficult for the Pakistan opener to lay bat on ball. Sharjeel eventually gets 
it right for a single to get off the mark after seven deliveries. It’s a 
straight-up mid-90s start to this challenging mid-90s chase. Pakistan are 
measured, assured and risk-free. Australia’s bowlers still searching for 
consistency.
 
3rd over: Pakistan 11-0 (Azhar 6, Sharjeel 0)

A mixed bag from Starc - a good one, a a short one, a few wide ones, and both 
sides of the wicket. Azhar picks him off through the off-side for a couple of 
two’s, before one absolutely rears from short of a length, rising well over the 
now-cramping Matt Wade, screaming to the boundary. Starc, despite conceding 
four runs for his team, looks literally elated.

On a separate note, the first comment comes in from Newcastle Person: 

‘I like Ian Chappell, but listening to him repeatedly say “Australia is going 
to try to win this with their quickies” is just a little surreal.’

Cheers for that, Newcastle Person. Completely agree.
 
2nd over: Pakistan 2-0 (Azhar 2, Sharjeel 0)

‘Big’ Billy Stanlake (imaginative, as always) finds some early swing, though 
the line and length are a little wanting. He has a huge gather before releasing 
the ball, his leap reminiscent of Neil Armstrong on the moon. He eventually 
fixes up his line and ties Azhar to the crease deep into the over. Bowling for 
Australia with two first class matches to your name cannot be easy. Stanlake 
completes his over, conceding only one from it. He’ll ‘take it’, as they say.
 
1st over: Pakistan 1-0 (Azhar 1, Sharjeel 0)

The shadows lengthen over the Gabba arena; Australia commences with two slips 
and a gully as Starc starts with a full length in pursuit of his 
occasionally-deadly movement. He does seem to bowl faster with the white ball. 
Azhar gets one to third man through a thick outside edge and Sharjeel can’t 
exploit two leg-side deliveries from Starc. We’re away. Stanlake from the other 
end!
 
Hello and welcome all to this - the good ship OBO - ahead of the second 
innings of this probably forgettable one dayer. That’s not a positive way to 
start is it? My apologies. I will say this though: for all the hoopla about the 
future of one day cricket and its place in an ever-crowded schedule in the 
modern era, that first innings had nearly all the hallmarks of a classic 
mid-90s total. There was a small part of me quietly hoping for an old-school 
chase of just over 200 (let’s say 218) that would ebb and flow throughout. 
Instead, modernity reared its spectacular head in the form of a run-a-ball 
hundred to Matt Wade. Almost everything about his innings wasrearguard, except 
his outstanding score. 100 off 100, a numerical dream.

I’ll be back for the first ball of the innings shortly. Would love to hear 
from you, so please get in touch at sam.perry.freelance@guardian.co.uk or on 
Twitter: @sjjperry. Catch you then.
 
Well, what an innings from Matthew Wade. He timed the rescue to perfection. 
Stayed patient, played himself in, didn’t waste any of the innings by going too 
early. Then was able to cash in fully late in the piece, and keep his composure 
despite wickets falling at the other end.

Glenn Maxwell was his initial partner in crime, making 60 and forming a 
partnership with Wade of 82. Then Wade had to do most of it on his own, in 
brief combinations with Cummins, Starc and Stanlake.

But what a disappointment for Pakistan. Amir bowled beautifully to start the 
innings, Wasim and Hafeez and Nawaz were tight through the middle, Hasan picked 
up important wickets. But they couldn’t finish the game off! They had Australia 
5-78, then 7-170, and couldn’t bowl them out for a 200-odd score that would 
have made for a fairly straightforward chase.

Instead, Australia recovered to 268, a very solid ODI total even in the modern 
era, and with Pakistan’s batting liable to be suspect on this sort of surface 
and against Australia’s style of fast bowling, it may well be enough. Really, 
it should be enough. It will take a fine performance from Pakistan to take this 
game back, and generally when a team has let a game slip this badly, the 
disappointment of that tends to flow on into a poor performance in their other 
discipline.


We shall see if these gloomy prognostications come to pass, or whether a 
glorious new era of optimism is about to rise shining like the armour of the 
ancients above a peaceful and happy land. Sam Perry will be your guide for that 
adventure; follow him as you have me, and whatever you do, do not look back 
over your shoulder as you leave Hades. Geoff Lemon bidding you a fond farewell.
