A week after patching three serious vulnerabilities in iOS, Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> has released a matching software 
update to fix the same flaws in its computer operating system macOS.

The urgent security update affects the most recent two versions of macOS, El 
Capitan and Yosemite, and blocks weaknesses in Safari and the base operating 
system. It can be downloaded through software update on affected machines.

The vulnerabilities were discovered when an attempt to hack into the iPhone of 
an Arab activistwas discovered by two security consultancies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/25/apple-ios-update-arab-activists-iphone-spyware>
, Lookout Mobile and Citizen Lab. Ahmed Mansour received two suspicious text 
messages in early august, claiming to offer new information about dissidents 
being tortured in the UAE. Mansour forwarded the links to the security 
researchers, who found a hitherto unknown type of spyware: one that could take 
total control of an iPhone running the latest version of iOS simply by the user 
opening the link in Safari.

Apple was informed, and the existence of the weaknesses was kept secret until 
the company was able to put together a patch for its mobile phones. But the 
underlying architecture ofiOS <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ios> and 
macOS is similar enough that the flaws also exist in Apple’s computers.

The company has not explained why it took a week after disclosure to fix its 
desktop operating systems. In theory, the delay left users open to attack, 
since cybercriminals were alerted to the existence of the vulnerability the day 
the iOS patch was released. But in practice, there are no reports of macOS 
malware in the wild that use these vulnerabilities – yet.

Nevertheless, Mac users would be well advised to update their computers sooner 
rather than later.
