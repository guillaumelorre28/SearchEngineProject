Woolacombe beach in Devon has been named by travellers as the UK’s best beach 
for the second year in a row.

The three-mile stretch of sand, which lies between Morte Point and Baggy 
Point, retained the top spot in a list based on TripAdvisor reviews and ratings.

The travel website described Woolacombe as having “rolling, unbroken surf 
which makes it the ideal hotspot for surfers”.

“The sheer length of the beach means that there is no shortage of sand to sit 
down and relax on during the busy summer months.”

One reviewer said they had first visited in 1950, adding: “I am still coming 
here and although there are a lot more people now, it is still possibly one of 
the best beaches in Britain, the clean sand, beach huts for hire, three miles 
to walk the length and fantastic clifftop walks make this a very special place.”

But while a Devon beach emerged on top, it was Cornwall that possessed the 
largest number of beaches named in the UK top 10.

Ranked behind Woolacombe were Weymouth beach in Dorset, St Brelade’s Bay beach 
in Jersey, Rhossili Bay near Swansea and Porthmeor beach in Cornwall.

The best beach in the world title was taken by Grace Bay in the Turks and 
Caicos, the set of islands south-east of the Bahamas.

The 12-mile stretch of sand is fringed with palm trees and surrounded by coral 
reefs, and has turquoise, shallow waters.

“It feels like walking on a soft bed,” said one reviewer, although others 
complained about crowds.

“There are not many places like this one,” said a reviewer from Germany. “It’s 
a paradise! The only disadvantage is that beach is very narrow and there are so 
many people.”
