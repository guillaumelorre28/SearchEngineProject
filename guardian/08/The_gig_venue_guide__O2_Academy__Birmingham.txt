Capacity: 3009, 600 and 250.
Who plays there: Owing to the varying size of its three rooms, the venue can 
handle virtually anything except arena-sized bands. Recent hot shows have 
ranged from Blondie in Academy 1 to Benjamin Booker in the significantly more 
intimate Academy 3. Forthcoming highlights include Gerard Way, Jessie J, 
Machine Head and a double bill of West Midlands heroes the Enemy and the Twang.
Cloakroom:  There’s one for each performing space, charging £1.50 per item, 
although this can be bypassed by using their advance texting offer:
o2priority.co.uk/moments <http://www.o2priority.co.uk/moments> Large bags, 
backpacks, bicycle helmets and allegedly “worrying” fancy dress items have to 
be deposited.
Admission: The regular Propaganda indie-rock club night is £5, while the 
biggest gigs in Academy 1 hover between £35 and £45. Most shows in 2 and 3 are 
priced between £10 and £20.

Bars: Each venue room has its own bars, not surprisingly, but in 1, the two 
long stretches take up virtually half of the wall-space. Service is quite 
swift, even on crowded nights. Selections are completely predictable, including 
Carlsberg, Guinness and Somersby cider. Prices are high, peaking at a 
ridiculous (for Birmingham) £4.80, but special offers can be quite reasonable. 
Unusually, for a venue such as this, tap water is freely available at the bars. 
There’s only one small bar in 3, so consequently service can be quite sluggish, 
even though it’s only a small room.
Food: There’s a hot-dog kiosk and bar snacks, but even the venue’s own website 
urges punters to eat elsewhere beforehand. There are numerous fast food joints 
and several Indian restaurants nearby. Restrictions on consumables are fierce: 
even sweets and chewing gum will be confiscated upon entry.
Toilets: These are of a good size and functionality, with queues unlikely. 
Academy 3 has some funky circular plastic urinals.

Wheelchair access: Arrangements should be made at the point of purchasing 
tickets, as spaces are limited. Carer/assistants will receive a free ticket.

Sound: Given that each room is by its nature a functional box, the sound 
quality isn’t too bad. It’s virtually impossible to go wrong in 3, and it’s 
democratically punchy in the much larger 1, unless you elect to stand right by 
the bar at the side, under the balcony.
Where to sit or stand: In 2 or 3, positioning is down to sightlines rather 
than sonics, as each room has a decent spread of sound. Academy 3 is 
appealingly intimate. In 1, standing on the central square of the dancefloor is 
advised, or up in the balcony, which covers three sides of the space.
Overall: Few folks enjoy being herded into corporate caverns, but to catch 
bands of a certain standing it can be necessary. There are hardly any quirks of 
individuality to expand upon the practical demands of staging, but the O2 
Academy performs well under such conditions. It’s preferable to quaff and nosh 
outside the portals, and time tightly for hitting the set-start at the latest 
possible moment. Rock and dance music weren’t designed for environments that 
are so burdened by rules and regulations: this can be something of an extreme 
dampener. Prominent signs forbid crowd-surfing (among many other things), yet a 
recent Benjamin Booker gig found the crazed New Orleans axeman promptly 
ignoring these instructions. Fortunately, the threat of instant ejection 
doesn’t appear to affect performers.

 Public transport: The venue is very well situated for bus services that run 
along the Bristol and Pershore Roads, but is also only a 10- to 15-minute 
stroll from New Street and Moor Street rail stations. The hike could be longer 
from bus stops servicing other sides of the city, particularly now that all 
central stops have been suspended due to metro construction.
