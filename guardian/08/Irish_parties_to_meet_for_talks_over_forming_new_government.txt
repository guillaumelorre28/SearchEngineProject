Ireland’s two largest political parties have agreed to meet early next week 
for talks on how one might support the other to form a minority government and 
avoid a second general election.

The smaller of the two, Fianna Fáil, on Thursday rejected an offer from the 
Fine Gael party of acting prime ministerEnda Kenny

 for a grand coalition between the historic centre-right rivals.

That leaves a minority government, in which one party abstains in key 
parliamentary votes to allow the other party to govern, as the only realistic 
way to avoid a repeat of the 26 February general election.

But both sides say the details of any such agreement would be crucial in 
determining its viability.

The two parties published a statement saying the talks would “discuss how a 
viable minority government would work”.

Parliament is due to sit on Thursday to attempt for the third time to elect a 
new prime minister.

Kenny’s Fine Gael would be the strong favourite to lead a minority government, 
as it has 50 seats to Fianna Fáil’s 43 in the 158-seat chamber. But both would 
need the support of independent deputies and Fianna Fáil could theoretically 
edge ahead if it secures enough of them.
