The BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, is to take over for the remainder of 
Srinivasan’s tenure until June next year, the board secretary, Anurag Thakur, 
said in Mumbai.

“The BCCI representative to the ICC will be Mr Shashank Manohar. Being the 
board representative in the ICC, he will take over as the ICC chairman,” Thakur 
said after an annual general meeting in which the board decided to address an 
issue regarding conflict of interest.

The former BCCI chief Srinivasan took over as the ICC chairman in June 2014 in 
controversial circumstances after his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, a former 
official at Chennai Super Kings, was indicted in an illegal betting scandal in 
the Indian Premier League and banned for life from cricket.

Srinivasan’s India Cements company owned the Chennai franchise of the 
lucrative Twenty20 competition, which many perceived as a case of conflict of 
interest.

The Super Kings were banned from the IPL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl> in July for two years for their part in 
the scandal.
