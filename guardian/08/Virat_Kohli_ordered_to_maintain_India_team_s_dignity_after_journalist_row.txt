journalist

 during a team practice session.

Kohli apparently acted on the basis of mistaken identity when he lost his cool 
with the reporter after nets as India prepared for their next World Cup match 
against West Indies in Perth.

The poster-boy batsman, who wrongly thought he was speaking to the author of 
an article which upset him, is urged to “maintain the dignity of the team at 
all times” in a press release signed by the BCCI secretary, Anurag Thakur.

It reads: “The BCCI has taken note of the incident that occurred at Perth a 
couple of days ago. The BCCI has been in touch with the Indian team management 
on this issue, and has advised that this kind of incident should not be 
repeated. The BCCI respects the role played by the media in covering and 
popularising the game of cricket, and acknowledges the support of the media, in 
its mission to administer and promote the game of cricket in India.”

India’s governing body has also made it clear officials have spoken directly 
to Kohli about the matter. The statement added: “The player in question has 
been told to maintain the dignity of the Indian team at all times, and avoid 
any such behaviour in the future. The BCCI would like to request the concerned 
parties to move on, and focus on the Indian cricket team’s campaign in the 
ongoing ICC CWC 2015.”

India currently sip top of Pool B after their crushing nine-wicket victory 
over the UAE on Saturday
