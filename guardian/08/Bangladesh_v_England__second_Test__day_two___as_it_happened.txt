You know I still make Bangladesh favourites. They’ve got a decent lead very 
quickly and, despite Mahmadullah’s brain-fade, batting to come that has plenty 
of potential runs in it.

I’m off to  bed  do more work, but do join me again at about 3am GMT tomorrow 
morning for what promises to be a cracker of a fourth day. Cheers for reading 
and apologies for any tweets and emails I couldn’t use. Bye!

Stumps – Bangladesh 152-3

31st over: Bangladesh 152-3 (Imrul 59) Alastair Cook is told he can’t bowl 
Finn in this light, so Zafar returns. I guess this will be the penultimate 
over, although the way he’s taking his time could well make it the last. Imrul 
comes forward to the second ball and looks to defend, but is nutmegged outside 
leg-stump by the low bounce. There’s a sense of panic when he turns back and 
heads towards his crease, but he’s fine. Cook brings in the men from long-on 
and long-off to catching positions and the pressure tells! The very last ball 
of the day brings the wicket England wanted and they’ll be buoyed going into 
tomorrow.Bangladesh lead by 128 with seven wickets in hand.

Wicket! Mahmadullah b Zafar 47

Utterly idiotic from Mahmadullah. He goes for the huge slog-sweep and ruins 
all his hard work by missing a straight one. Down go the stumps on the last 
ball of the day.

30th over: Bangladesh 150-2 (Mahmadullah 46, Imrul 58) On Sky, Mike Atherton 
is talking about playing with his dog, which makes me want to be mates with 
Mike Atherton all the more.

Mahmadullah is playing a fine innings himself here, scurrying and busy, and 
moving to 46 from 54 balls with a clip to midwicket for a well-run two and a 
push to mid-on for one. The 150 comes up and we can start thinking about what 
kind of total Bangladesh will want to defend. Another 120 runs and it’d be a 
corker of a fourth innings.

29th over: Bangladesh 147-2 (Mahmadullah 43, Imrul 58) Another overthrow after 
a pointless shy at the stumps by, I think, Ballance. It looks like he’s been 
exiled to the deep for that one. A googly out the rough takes Imrul by surprise 
and takes the shoulder of the bat, but there’s no catcher in place. Twice the 
batsman sweeps and the second time it works, beating the sweeper Duckett and 
skidding away for Imrul’s eighth boundary.

11.45am BST 11:45  <> 

28th over: Bangladesh 138-2 (Mahmadullah 40, Imrul 52) Into the last over 
then, which Moeen will bowl. Imrul misses a big sweep and is very careful to 
keep his back foot planted in the crease with Bairstow lurking ominously 
behind. Moeen needs to take a wicket to prevent this from being Bangladesh’s 
day, despite that 99-run ninth-wicket stand for England.

Er... it looks like we’re carrying on. Of course we’ve had the minimum overs 
for the day. It’s looking dark out there too.

“Dan,TMS are reminding us that, as the clocks go back tonight, their official

irresponsible TMS guys, eh?” I’m opening up the OBO tomorrow, so I’ve just 
spent Rashid’s over swearing loudly while Barry Glendenning and Gregg Bakowski 
laugh at me.

Imrul moves to a fine 50 with a reverse sweep that goes fine and fine down to 
third man. This has been an excellent innings from the man whom some thought of 
as a jumped-up ODI player before this series.

26th over: Bangladesh 127-2 (Mahmadullah 36, Imrul 46) Woakes is off, Moeen is 
on with just three overs left. Bairstow, who is getting increasingly irritating 
behind the stumps, screams his head off for lbw against Imrul, who dug a full 
ball out with his bat about a foot away from his boot. Cook, unlike Mushfiqur 
this morning, is not impressed enough to call for a review. There’s a better 
shout a couple of balls later when Mahmadullah is hit on the pad from round the 
wicket, but Moeen turns away without appealing himself.

25th over: Bangladesh 124-2 (Mahmadullah 33, Imrul 45) Another call for a 
catch from behind the stumps, but Rashid’s leg-break just looped up off the pad 
with daylight between bat and ball. Two singles from the over drop the run-rate 
below five, which is a victory of sorts for England. The lead is 100.

24th over: Bangladesh 122-2 (Mahmadullah 32, Imrul 44) Two more boundaries: 
Woakes strays on to the ankles, Mahmadullah steps back and across and whips it 
fine for four to bring up the 50 partnership from 61 balls. Fine stuff that 
from the hosts, whose run rate is – incredibly – still around five an over. 
Root, incidentally, is off the field with an upset stomach. Then four balls 
later Woakes puts a half-volley in the slot and Imrul reaches into the coaching 
manual and pulls out the cover drive.

23rd over: Bangladesh 113-2 (Mahmadullah 27, Imrul 40) Nice shot from 
Mahmadullah, going back in his crease and punching against the spin to mid-on 
for just one. You kinda feel he deserved more. Imrul then brings out the 
reverse sweep and Zafar comes round to save a couple with a good slide. The 
Bangladesh batsmen play that shot well, getting across and right on top of the 
ball to smother the spin. A leading edge along the ground and through gully, 
off the googly, brings two more then a clip off the pads lands a foot or so 
short of Buttler at midwicket. “You are kidding me?” says a grumpy Rashid and 
his mood won’t be helped by Imrul thwacking the final ball on the pull, through 
midwicket for four.

22nd over: Bangladesh 104-2 (Mahmadullah 26, Imrul 32) Belatedly, Chris Woakes 
is introduced to the attack and Mahmadullah’s single takes Bangladesh to 100 
with minimal fanfare. Imrul reaches for a full, wide one and Bairstow appeals 
for a catch behind, but I’m not convinced he even believes that one himself 
given his grin. He cashes in with a glorious pull shot, from a waist-high short 
ball and crashed through midwicket with a lovely woody sound for four.

Simon McMahon updates us: “Arrived in Glasgow. Apparently ‘Joe and Casper’ are 
here too. Yeah, me neither. They’re YouTubers apparently. But at least Mrs 
McMahon kept me up to date with the cricket on the way through, asking at one 
point ‘so, do both teams get a go at batting and bowling every day?’ It’s been 
that kind of Test, hasn’t it?”

Sometimes I think I should be a YouTuber. They’ve all got loads of money and I 
see their grinning, shiny faces and nice teeth and bad hair everywhere when I 
get dragged to bookshops by the other half (buy a Kindle, luddites). But I have 
a voice like a constipated Tom Waits, apparently.

21st over: Bangladesh 99-2 (Mahmadullah 25, Imrul 28) Change of bowling as 
Zafar, who looked increasingly confident, takes a break and is replaced by Adil 
Rashid. The leggie played a fine innings with the bat earlier and he turns one 
square out of the rough, albeit well outside leg-stump and almost worth calling 
a wide. Once again Imrul top-edges an attempted slog-sweep and again it lands 
safe, this time around backward square. They take two.

20th over: Bangladesh 96-2 (Mahmadullah 24, Imrul 26) I’d haul Stokes off now, 
given he looks knackered and could well be England’s most effective bowler when 
the ball gets properly old. The covers are being readied, while on the field a 
pair of singles push Bangladesh’s lead to 72. The final ball induces an inside 
edge that thuds into pads when it could so easily have been stumps. Such are 
the fine margins etc.

19th over: Bangladesh 94-2 (Mahmadullah 23, Imrul 25) It’s raining, so not 
sure how much longer this will last – I’d be surprised if we get the 10 
remaining over in. Imrul lives dangerously, top edging a booming slog-sweep but 
the ball falls wide of Moeen at midwicket. It would have been hard for him to 
watch that one in the air. Although there’s little excusing the fielding 
sloppiness that allows a couple of overthrows a few balls later.

18th over: Bangladesh 90-2 (Mahmadullah 20, Imrul 24) Stokes continues after 
drinks and it looks like the clouds have given way a bit – it’s certainly 
brighter there. Imrul drives and it comes off the thick outside edge, going 
through point and slightly in the air rather than booming through cover as he 
intended. The ball before that, Stokes got a bouncer all wrong and it was 
called a wide on height. The final ball is on the opener’s pads and whipped 
hard, square, aerially and safe for two.

“King of the wicketkeeper chat was surely Paul ‘Mad as a badger’ Nixon,” says 
Phil Russell. “His most celebrated comments have had plenty of airings 
previously, but my favourite remains the one where he innocently asks the 
batsman “Do you hold you breath when you play your shots?” Which as a subtle 
way of getting into a batsman head is so much better than the usual ‘come on 
lads, this lot are a bunch of [redacteds]’ nonsense that seems to proliforate 
these days.”

That is actually pretty good.

17th over: Bangladesh 85-2 (Mahmadullah 19, Imrul 21) Despite those two 
wickets, Mahmadullah reckons attack is still the way to go against Zafar and he 
waits for the full ball on middle, then clumps it nicely back over the bowler’s 
head for the 14th boundary of the innings. Imrul hasn’t scored a run since the 
12th over.

Apparently Zafar Ansari also plays the piano. Any excuse for this.

16th over: Bangladesh 81-2 (Mahmadullah 15, Imrul 21) There are ostensibly 12 
overs left today after this one but it is very dark now and rain is forecast 
for around about now. A maiden.

15th over: Bangladesh 81-2 (Mahmadullah 15, Imrul 21) Zafar continues and is 
looking better with every over. That wicket might have given Bangladesh second 
thoughts about trying to dismissively swat him from the attack. A lovely 
drifting ball turns and beats Mahmadullah, who eventually gets four with a very 
lovely sweep from outside off from the last ball. Good bowling and good batting 
in that over.

14th over: Bangladesh 75-2 (Mahmadullah 9, Imrul 21) The new new man 
Mahmadullah (not a typo) is off the mark in style after Stokes takes a wicket 
with the first ball. A swivel-pull dismisses a short ball to fine-leg for four, 
then a lovely crisp cover drive doubles it. The clouds are coming over.

“Hi Dan.” Hi, Derek Walmsley. “I’m not really feeling Bairstow’s lyrical flow 
behind the stumps - bit blood and thunder for my liking. I wonder if you had 
any favourite wicket keeper cheerleaders? Matt Prior was a bit more bright and 
up tempo, and I remember the odd engagingly hysterical laugh from Gilchrist.”

I’m not a fan of any wicketkeeper chat. They’re the cricketing equivalent of 
scrum-halfs and need shutting up promptly.

Wicket! Mominul c Cook b Stokes 1

And there’s a dent in Mominul’s Test average. A good line, just back of a 
length from Stokes and he can’t resist a little prod. Cook goes to his left and 
clings on.

13th over: Bangladesh 66-1 (Mominul 1, Imrul 21) Zafar Ansari’s first Test 
wicket quietens the crowd and brings the 5’3” Mominul Haque to the crease. He’s 
a fine player, with a Test average of 53 and three hundreds, including ones 
against New Zealand and Sri Lanka. I’d imagine Bangladesh will slow things down 
and just look to accumulate now...

Wicket! Tamim c Cook b Zafar 40

Shows what I know. Tamim plays a rare tentative shot and pays the price: 
prodding forward it goes from inside edge, to pad, to Cook at leg-slip.

12th over: Bangladesh 65-0 (Tamim 40, Imrul 21) The batsmen are, 
understandably, watchful against Stokes. His third ball is short, wide rubbish 
angled across Imrul but he’s not tempted. He does pull hard at a straighter 
bouncer but doesn’t get hold of it, the ball tumbling to midwicket for just a 
single. With his final ball he knocks the stumps with his bowling hand, a 
no-ball, and looks to have hurt it a bit; indeed at the end of the over he runs 
off.

Andy Potts responds to the 10th over: “The way Bangladesh are scoring the ball 
will be roughed up in no time. Finn has never really shined as a bowler for 
England. What’s happened to Stuart Broad?”

Broad is being rested for this Test. It’s harsh to say Finn has never shone, 
but he’s never really looked like being the consistently terrifying pace bowler 
we hoped for.

Perhaps a bit earlier than he might have liked, Cook tosses the ball to 
Stokes. Tamim Iqbal has the strike. This could be fun.

11th over: Bangladesh 61-0 (Tamim 38, Imrul 20) Another reverse sweep, another 
boundary to Tamim through the region formerly known as point. Zafir, to his 
credit, asks for a field change and gets it. Nonetheless, I’m about to curl up 
in a shivering ball thinking about what Virat Kohli and co are going to do to 
this attack. Four seamers for India, anyone?

10th over: Bangladesh 56-0 (Tamim 33, Imrul 20) The boundaries are flowing and 
Bangladesh are scoring at an ODI rate. Imrul drops his hands and edges wide of 
the slips and down to the rope at third man to bring up the 50 for Bangladesh. 
A single, then Tamim plays an absolutely brilliant lofted cover drive, hard and 
over the close field for four more. This is cracking stuff.

Andy Potts writes: “I would have had Stokes open the bowling with his figures 
in the first innings to keep it tight and to keep the pressure on, then Ali at 
the other end to make things happen.”

Mo yes, but I think it’s wise to keep Stokes back and let the spinners rough 
up the ball so he can get it reversing. I don’t see Stokes as a new-ball kind 
of bowler.

9th over: Bangladesh 46-0 (Tamim 28, Imrul 15) Down the leg side from Zafir 
and Imrul sweeps hard, but he can only get one as there’s a sweeper coming 
round. Tamim likes the sweep too and, when Zafir tosses one on off-stump he 
reverses it beautifully to pick up four more. He’s 28 from 28 balls now.

8th over: Bangladesh 41-0 (Tamim 24, Imrul 14) “Catch!” is the cry as Imrul 
sweeps hard and in the air out towards square-leg. It goes too fast for Stokes 
out in the deep to pick it up and away the ball goes for four. It was a big ask 
for the Durham man to get to that.

“At what point do we have to ask whether Finn will ever realise his clear 
potential?” asks Elliot Wilson. “It’s during sessions like these, where Finn 
really needs to find lightning in a bottle, that he tends to go missing.”

It’s a fair question. Finn is 27 now and should really be at his peak. I’m 
more worried about Buttler: he’s one of the biggest talents England have had in 
a generation and they can’t waste him as well as Finn. I don’t think the bowler 
is going to make it, going on gut feeling.

7th over: Bangladesh 35-0 (Tamim 23, Imrul 9) Finn is off but it’s Zafir 
Ansari rather than Woakes. Ansari is another one I’m not sure about; yes he was 
the “next cab off the rank”, but that was a year ago and we’ve had an entire 
county season between the Pakistan series in the UAE and now, during which he 
was easily outbowled by Ollie Rayner. He overpitches to Tamim and again that 
bottom hand comes into play, drilling it through extra cover for four. Two 
balls later he flicks one just short of Cook at leg-slip. The camera angle on 
the replay doesn’t show us whether or not it carried but my suspicion is that 
it didn’t.

6th over: Bangladesh 29-0 (Tamim 18, Imrul 8) Now Imrul gets in on the 
boundary game, sweeping very nicely from outside off and behind square for his 
first four and the first off of Moeen. Bangladesh lead in what is now 
essentially a one-innings match.

Speaking of Mo, here’s a good question from Neil Delaney: “Moeen was opening 
the batting last year & the bowling now. There can’t be too many others to do 
this. Sobers?” I don’t think Kallis ever opened the batting did he?

5th over: Bangladesh 24-0 (Tamim 18, Imrul 3) Personally I’d have Woakes on 
for Finn; in fact I’d probably have opened with Woakes. In fact I probably 
wouldn’t have picked Finn, whose first-innings effort can kindly be described 
as anodyne. He twices asks for lbw against Tamim but with curbed enthusiasm, as 
the ball was twice going well down the leg side. Tamim gets his third boundary, 
using his bottom hand and excellent timing to shovel a full ball through extra 
cover. That levels the scores in no time at all.

4th over: Bangladesh 18-0 (Tamim 13, Imrul 3) A thick outside edge from the 
first ball goes to slip, but it was played with soft hands by Imrul and 
dribbled along the ground. After a leg-bye, Tamim plays a nice cut off a wide 
ball but can only get a single to point. When he’s in this kind of nick, Tamim 
is a lovely player to watch.

3rd over: Bangladesh 16-0 (Tamim 12, Imrul 3) Finn gives round the wicket a 
brief go to Imrul Kayes and to little avail. After a single he goes too full to 
Tamim, whose first innings hundred is looking increasingly outstanding. He 
looks good here, too, leaning into that ball and clipping it off his ankles 
with gorgeous timing and through to the midwicket boundary. Another overpitched 
ball is knocked in front of square leg for two more. The lead is down to eight.

2nd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Tamim 6, Imrul 2) It’s Moeen from the other end, 
with two slips in place for the left-handers. Mushfiqur didn’t use his spinners 
especially well as England’s ninth wicket eroded Bangladesh’s lead, so it’ll be 
interesting to see how Cook does. There’s a big shout for lbw when Tamim prods 
forward but he was hit outside the line, as both Moeen and Bairstow point out 
so Cook doesn’t review.

1st over: Bangladesh 7-0 (Tamim 5, Imrul 1) Steven Finn is opening the bowling 
for England and, after a couple of singles, he gets an inside edge from Tamim 
with a ball that rises sharply and clumps via bat into pad. In comes short-leg. 
Tamim gets his first boundary off a short, wide ball that he murders through 
point with a mighty cut. A leg-bye concludes the over.

John Ryan is angry. John Ryan didn’t get up early for this kinda crap. John 
Ryan has not been watching Tests for too long. “Bangladesh’s only hope of ever 
being a competitive test team is if there’s a rule change that allows them to 
have a new ball at the beginning of every over,” he writes. “One of the most 
shambolic few hours of cricket I’ve ever seen.”

Bangladesh will have a mini session to negotiate before tea. In the meantime, 
Simon McMahon writes: “Morning Dan. I don’t know much about Belgian folk music, 
but I am going to Glasgow to see Justin Bieber tonight (escorting teenage 
daughters, that’s all, I’ve not got a ticket myself, you understand). 
Apparently he wants to be areal musician. Well, Justin, I want to play cricket 
like Ben Stokes and write songs like Neil Hannon, but it ain’t gonna happen. 
Anyway, cocktails on me if this Test is tied.”


I hate to say it but Biebs is a talented guy. I even quite like a couple of 
his songs though I couldn’t name any. I got a new guitar yesterday (early 
birthday present, thanks Liz!) and can’t do this.

England lead by 24

82nd over: England 244 (Rashid 44) Taijul continues and beats Finn, before 
ending England’s resistance a couple of balls later. England have a slim lead 
but it’s in the balance.

That’s it. The new ball turns and bounces away from Finn’s bat. He follows it 
and gets the finest edge, which Mushfiqur takes well.

New ball taken

81st over: England 243-9 (Finn 0, Rashid 43) To no great surprise, and as you 
can see from that big chunky text above, Bangladesh take the new ball straight 
away. Their reviews have been topped up too, like a number of lives when you 
get 100 gold coins in the original Super Mario.

Mehedi, over the wicket, has the new ball as well as a slip, short-leg, 
leg-slip and shortish midwicket, and it’s the second of those who snares him 
with an excellent catch, diving to his left. Mehedi has six and England’s fine 
ninth-wicket stand comes to an end on 99.

Wicket! Woakes c Shuvagata b Mehdi 46

Woakes’s fine stand comes to an end. He likes the look of an off-break, on his 
pads, and flicks it round the corner, straight into the hands of leg-slip.

You know I still make Bangladesh favourites. They’ve got a decent lead very 
quickly and, despite Mahmadullah’s brain-fade, batting to come that has plenty 
of potential runs in it.

I’m off to  bed  do more work, but do join me again at about 3am GMT tomorrow 
morning for what promises to be a cracker of a fourth day. Cheers for reading 
and apologies for any tweets and emails I couldn’t use. Bye!

Ben Stokes and Zafar Ansari help England hang on against Bangladesh
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/england-bangladesh-second-test-match-report> 
31st over: Bangladesh 152-3 (Imrul 59) Alastair Cook is told he can’t bowl 
Finn in this light, so Zafar returns. I guess this will be the penultimate 
over, although the way he’s taking his time could well make it the last. Imrul 
comes forward to the second ball and looks to defend, but is nutmegged outside 
leg-stump by the low bounce. There’s a sense of panic when he turns back and 
heads towards his crease, but he’s fine. Cook brings in the men from long-on 
and long-off to catching positions and the pressure tells! The very last ball 
of the day brings the wicket England wanted and they’ll be buoyed going into 
tomorrow.Bangladesh lead by 128 with seven wickets in hand.
 
Utterly idiotic from Mahmadullah. He goes for the huge slog-sweep and ruins 
all his hard work by missing a straight one. Down go the stumps on the last 
ball of the day.
 
30th over: Bangladesh 150-2 (Mahmadullah 46, Imrul 58) On Sky, Mike Atherton 
is talking about playing with his dog, which makes me want to be mates with 
Mike Atherton all the more.

Mahmadullah is playing a fine innings himself here, scurrying and busy, and 
moving to 46 from 54 balls with a clip to midwicket for a well-run two and a 
push to mid-on for one. The 150 comes up and we can start thinking about what 
kind of total Bangladesh will want to defend. Another 120 runs and it’d be a 
corker of a fourth innings.
 
29th over: Bangladesh 147-2 (Mahmadullah 43, Imrul 58) Another overthrow after 
a pointless shy at the stumps by, I think, Ballance. It looks like he’s been 
exiled to the deep for that one. A googly out the rough takes Imrul by surprise 
and takes the shoulder of the bat, but there’s no catcher in place. Twice the 
batsman sweeps and the second time it works, beating the sweeper Duckett and 
skidding away for Imrul’s eighth boundary.
 
28th over: Bangladesh 138-2 (Mahmadullah 40, Imrul 52) Into the last over 
then, which Moeen will bowl. Imrul misses a big sweep and is very careful to 
keep his back foot planted in the crease with Bairstow lurking ominously 
behind. Moeen needs to take a wicket to prevent this from being Bangladesh’s 
day, despite that 99-run ninth-wicket stand for England.

Er... it looks like we’re carrying on. Of course we’ve had the minimum overs 
for the day. It’s looking dark out there too.
 
27th over: Bangladesh 135-2 (Mahmadullah 38, Imrul 51) John Starbuck writes: 
“Dan,TMS are reminding us that, as the clocks go back tonight, their official 
start time will be 03:45 GMT, so why bother going to bed? Those crazy, 
irresponsible TMS guys, eh?” I’m opening up the OBO tomorrow, so I’ve just 
spent Rashid’s over swearing loudly while Barry Glendenning and Gregg Bakowski 
laugh at me.

Imrul moves to a fine 50 with a reverse sweep that goes fine and fine down to 
third man. This has been an excellent innings from the man whom some thought of 
as a jumped-up ODI player before this series.
 
26th over: Bangladesh 127-2 (Mahmadullah 36, Imrul 46) Woakes is off, Moeen is 
on with just three overs left. Bairstow, who is getting increasingly irritating 
behind the stumps, screams his head off for lbw against Imrul, who dug a full 
ball out with his bat about a foot away from his boot. Cook, unlike Mushfiqur 
this morning, is not impressed enough to call for a review. There’s a better 
shout a couple of balls later when Mahmadullah is hit on the pad from round the 
wicket, but Moeen turns away without appealing himself.
 
25th over: Bangladesh 124-2 (Mahmadullah 33, Imrul 45) Another call for a 
catch from behind the stumps, but Rashid’s leg-break just looped up off the pad 
with daylight between bat and ball. Two singles from the over drop the run-rate 
below five, which is a victory of sorts for England. The lead is 100.
 
24th over: Bangladesh 122-2 (Mahmadullah 32, Imrul 44) Two more boundaries: 
Woakes strays on to the ankles, Mahmadullah steps back and across and whips it 
fine for four to bring up the 50 partnership from 61 balls. Fine stuff that 
from the hosts, whose run rate is – incredibly – still around five an over. 
Root, incidentally, is off the field with an upset stomach. Then four balls 
later Woakes puts a half-volley in the slot and Imrul reaches into the coaching 
manual and pulls out the cover drive.

Run-out bowling?
 
23rd over: Bangladesh 113-2 (Mahmadullah 27, Imrul 40) Nice shot from 
Mahmadullah, going back in his crease and punching against the spin to mid-on 
for just one. You kinda feel he deserved more. Imrul then brings out the 
reverse sweep and Zafar comes round to save a couple with a good slide. The 
Bangladesh batsmen play that shot well, getting across and right on top of the 
ball to smother the spin. A leading edge along the ground and through gully, 
off the googly, brings two more then a clip off the pads lands a foot or so 
short of Buttler at midwicket. “You are kidding me?” says a grumpy Rashid and 
his mood won’t be helped by Imrul thwacking the final ball on the pull, through 
midwicket for four.
 
22nd over: Bangladesh 104-2 (Mahmadullah 26, Imrul 32) Belatedly, Chris Woakes 
is introduced to the attack and Mahmadullah’s single takes Bangladesh to 100 
with minimal fanfare. Imrul reaches for a full, wide one and Bairstow appeals 
for a catch behind, but I’m not convinced he even believes that one himself 
given his grin. He cashes in with a glorious pull shot, from a waist-high short 
ball and crashed through midwicket with a lovely woody sound for four.

Simon McMahon updates us: “Arrived in Glasgow. Apparently ‘Joe and Casper’ are 
here too. Yeah, me neither. They’re YouTubers apparently. But at least Mrs 
McMahon kept me up to date with the cricket on the way through, asking at one 
point ‘so, do both teams get a go at batting and bowling every day?’ It’s been 
that kind of Test, hasn’t it?”

Sometimes I think I should be a YouTuber. They’ve all got loads of money and I 
see their grinning, shiny faces and nice teeth and bad hair everywhere when I 
get dragged to bookshops by the other half (buy a Kindle, luddites). But I have 
a voice like a constipated Tom Waits, apparently.
 
21st over: Bangladesh 99-2 (Mahmadullah 25, Imrul 28) Change of bowling as 
Zafar, who looked increasingly confident, takes a break and is replaced by Adil 
Rashid. The leggie played a fine innings with the bat earlier and he turns one 
square out of the rough, albeit well outside leg-stump and almost worth calling 
a wide. Once again Imrul top-edges an attempted slog-sweep and again it lands 
safe, this time around backward square. They take two.
 
20th over: Bangladesh 96-2 (Mahmadullah 24, Imrul 26) I’d haul Stokes off now, 
given he looks knackered and could well be England’s most effective bowler when 
the ball gets properly old. The covers are being readied, while on the field a 
pair of singles push Bangladesh’s lead to 72. The final ball induces an inside 
edge that thuds into pads when it could so easily have been stumps. Such are 
the fine margins etc.
 
19th over: Bangladesh 94-2 (Mahmadullah 23, Imrul 25) It’s raining, so not 
sure how much longer this will last – I’d be surprised if we get the 10 
remaining over in. Imrul lives dangerously, top edging a booming slog-sweep but 
the ball falls wide of Moeen at midwicket. It would have been hard for him to 
watch that one in the air. Although there’s little excusing the fielding 
sloppiness that allows a couple of overthrows a few balls later.
 
18th over: Bangladesh 90-2 (Mahmadullah 20, Imrul 24) Stokes continues after 
drinks and it looks like the clouds have given way a bit – it’s certainly 
brighter there. Imrul drives and it comes off the thick outside edge, going 
through point and slightly in the air rather than booming through cover as he 
intended. The ball before that, Stokes got a bouncer all wrong and it was 
called a wide on height. The final ball is on the opener’s pads and whipped 
hard, square, aerially and safe for two.

“King of the wicketkeeper chat was surely Paul ‘Mad as a badger’ Nixon,” says 
Phil Russell. “His most celebrated comments have had plenty of airings 
previously, but my favourite remains the one where he innocently asks the 
batsman “Do you hold you breath when you play your shots?” Which as a subtle 
way of getting into a batsman head is so much better than the usual ‘come on 
lads, this lot are a bunch of [redacteds]’ nonsense that seems to proliforate 
these days.”

That is actually pretty good.
 
Shameless self-promotion

It’s drinks.
 
17th over: Bangladesh 85-2 (Mahmadullah 19, Imrul 21) Despite those two 
wickets, Mahmadullah reckons attack is still the way to go against Zafar and he 
waits for the full ball on middle, then clumps it nicely back over the bowler’s 
head for the 14th boundary of the innings. Imrul hasn’t scored a run since the 
12th over.

Apparently Zafar Ansari also plays the piano. Any excuse for this.
 
16th over: Bangladesh 81-2 (Mahmadullah 15, Imrul 21) There are ostensibly 12 
overs left today after this one but it is very dark now and rain is forecast 
for around about now. A maiden.
 
15th over: Bangladesh 81-2 (Mahmadullah 15, Imrul 21) Zafar continues and is 
looking better with every over. That wicket might have given Bangladesh second 
thoughts about trying to dismissively swat him from the attack. A lovely 
drifting ball turns and beats Mahmadullah, who eventually gets four with a very 
lovely sweep from outside off from the last ball. Good bowling and good batting 
in that over.
Tim de Lisle (@TimdeLisle) 
@DanLucas86 <https://twitter.com/DanLucas86> Zafar Ansari becomes the first 
person ever to deliver 40,000 words on civil rights and take a Test wicket in 
the same year
 <https://twitter.com/TimdeLisle/status/792299180056346624> October 29, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/TimdeLisle/status/792299180056346624>  
14th over: Bangladesh 75-2 (Mahmadullah 9, Imrul 21) The new new man 
Mahmadullah (not a typo) is off the mark in style after Stokes takes a wicket 
with the first ball. A swivel-pull dismisses a short ball to fine-leg for four, 
then a lovely crisp cover drive doubles it. The clouds are coming over.

“Hi Dan.” Hi, Derek Walmsley. “I’m not really feeling Bairstow’s lyrical flow 
behind the stumps - bit blood and thunder for my liking. I wonder if you had 
any favourite wicket keeper cheerleaders? Matt Prior was a bit more bright and 
up tempo, and I remember the odd engagingly hysterical laugh from Gilchrist.”

I’m not a fan of any wicketkeeper chat. They’re the cricketing equivalent of 
scrum-halfs and need shutting up promptly.
 
And there’s a dent in Mominul’s Test average. A good line, just back of a 
length from Stokes and he can’t resist a little prod. Cook goes to his left and 
clings on.
 
13th over: Bangladesh 66-1 (Mominul 1, Imrul 21) Zafar Ansari’s first Test 
wicket quietens the crowd and brings the 5’3” Mominul Haque to the crease. He’s 
a fine player, with a Test average of 53 and three hundreds, including ones 
against New Zealand and Sri Lanka. I’d imagine Bangladesh will slow things down 
and just look to accumulate now...
 
Shows what I know. Tamim plays a rare tentative shot and pays the price: 
prodding forward it goes from inside edge, to pad, to Cook at leg-slip.
 
12th over: Bangladesh 65-0 (Tamim 40, Imrul 21) The batsmen are, 
understandably, watchful against Stokes. His third ball is short, wide rubbish 
angled across Imrul but he’s not tempted. He does pull hard at a straighter 
bouncer but doesn’t get hold of it, the ball tumbling to midwicket for just a 
single. With his final ball he knocks the stumps with his bowling hand, a 
no-ball, and looks to have hurt it a bit; indeed at the end of the over he runs 
off.

Andy Potts responds to the 10th over: “The way Bangladesh are scoring the ball 
will be roughed up in no time. Finn has never really shined as a bowler for 
England. What’s happened to Stuart Broad?”

Broad is being rested for this Test. It’s harsh to say Finn has never shone, 
but he’s never really looked like being the consistently terrifying pace bowler 
we hoped for.

<https://twitter.com/SaraxCricket/status/792294417046638592>  
Perhaps a bit earlier than he might have liked, Cook tosses the ball to 
Stokes. Tamim Iqbal has the strike. This could be fun.
 
11th over: Bangladesh 61-0 (Tamim 38, Imrul 20) Another reverse sweep, another 
boundary to Tamim through the region formerly known as point. Zafir, to his 
credit, asks for a field change and gets it. Nonetheless, I’m about to curl up 
in a shivering ball thinking about what Virat Kohli and co are going to do to 
this attack. Four seamers for India, anyone?
 
10th over: Bangladesh 56-0 (Tamim 33, Imrul 20) The boundaries are flowing and 
Bangladesh are scoring at an ODI rate. Imrul drops his hands and edges wide of 
the slips and down to the rope at third man to bring up the 50 for Bangladesh. 
A single, then Tamim plays an absolutely brilliant lofted cover drive, hard and 
over the close field for four more. This is cracking stuff.

Andy Potts writes: “I would have had Stokes open the bowling with his figures 
in the first innings to keep it tight and to keep the pressure on, then Ali at 
the other end to make things happen.”

Mo yes, but I think it’s wise to keep Stokes back and let the spinners rough 
up the ball so he can get it reversing. I don’t see Stokes as a new-ball kind 
of bowler.
 
9th over: Bangladesh 46-0 (Tamim 28, Imrul 15) Down the leg side from Zafir 
and Imrul sweeps hard, but he can only get one as there’s a sweeper coming 
round. Tamim likes the sweep too and, when Zafir tosses one on off-stump he 
reverses it beautifully to pick up four more. He’s 28 from 28 balls now.
 
8th over: Bangladesh 41-0 (Tamim 24, Imrul 14) “Catch!” is the cry as Imrul 
sweeps hard and in the air out towards square-leg. It goes too fast for Stokes 
out in the deep to pick it up and away the ball goes for four. It was a big ask 
for the Durham man to get to that.

“At what point do we have to ask whether Finn will ever realise his clear 
potential?” asks Elliot Wilson. “It’s during sessions like these, where Finn 
really needs to find lightning in a bottle, that he tends to go missing.”

It’s a fair question. Finn is 27 now and should really be at his peak. I’m 
more worried about Buttler: he’s one of the biggest talents England have had in 
a generation and they can’t waste him as well as Finn. I don’t think the bowler 
is going to make it, going on gut feeling.
 
7th over: Bangladesh 35-0 (Tamim 23, Imrul 9) Finn is off but it’s Zafir 
Ansari rather than Woakes. Ansari is another one I’m not sure about; yes he was 
the “next cab off the rank”, but that was a year ago and we’ve had an entire 
county season between the Pakistan series in the UAE and now, during which he 
was easily outbowled by Ollie Rayner. He overpitches to Tamim and again that 
bottom hand comes into play, drilling it through extra cover for four. Two 
balls later he flicks one just short of Cook at leg-slip. The camera angle on 
the replay doesn’t show us whether or not it carried but my suspicion is that 
it didn’t.
 
6th over: Bangladesh 29-0 (Tamim 18, Imrul 8) Now Imrul gets in on the 
boundary game, sweeping very nicely from outside off and behind square for his 
first four and the first off of Moeen. Bangladesh lead in what is now 
essentially a one-innings match.

Speaking of Mo, here’s a good question from Neil Delaney: “Moeen was opening 
the batting last year & the bowling now. There can’t be too many others to do 
this. Sobers?” I don’t think Kallis ever opened the batting did he?
 
5th over: Bangladesh 24-0 (Tamim 18, Imrul 3) Personally I’d have Woakes on 
for Finn; in fact I’d probably have opened with Woakes. In fact I probably 
wouldn’t have picked Finn, whose first-innings effort can kindly be described 
as anodyne. He twices asks for lbw against Tamim but with curbed enthusiasm, as 
the ball was twice going well down the leg side. Tamim gets his third boundary, 
using his bottom hand and excellent timing to shovel a full ball through extra 
cover. That levels the scores in no time at all.

“Your guitar hero is Bieber?” Asks Patrick Harvey. “For Shame! Try this instead
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgGvml0cOKA&app=desktop>.”

My guitar hero is David Gilmour. Just look at this.
 
4th over: Bangladesh 18-0 (Tamim 13, Imrul 3) A thick outside edge from the 
first ball goes to slip, but it was played with soft hands by Imrul and 
dribbled along the ground. After a leg-bye, Tamim plays a nice cut off a wide 
ball but can only get a single to point. When he’s in this kind of nick, Tamim 
is a lovely player to watch.

<https://twitter.com/Benedict_B/status/792286922001510400>  
3rd over: Bangladesh 16-0 (Tamim 12, Imrul 3) Finn gives round the wicket a 
brief go to Imrul Kayes and to little avail. After a single he goes too full to 
Tamim, whose first innings hundred is looking increasingly outstanding. He 
looks good here, too, leaning into that ball and clipping it off his ankles 
with gorgeous timing and through to the midwicket boundary. Another overpitched 
ball is knocked in front of square leg for two more. The lead is down to eight.
 
2nd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Tamim 6, Imrul 2) It’s Moeen from the other end, 
with two slips in place for the left-handers. Mushfiqur didn’t use his spinners 
especially well as England’s ninth wicket eroded Bangladesh’s lead, so it’ll be 
interesting to see how Cook does. There’s a big shout for lbw when Tamim prods 
forward but he was hit outside the line, as both Moeen and Bairstow point out 
so Cook doesn’t review.

screaming to get out at his concert.” Arf.
 
1st over: Bangladesh 7-0 (Tamim 5, Imrul 1) Steven Finn is opening the bowling 
for England and, after a couple of singles, he gets an inside edge from Tamim 
with a ball that rises sharply and clumps via bat into pad. In comes short-leg. 
Tamim gets his first boundary off a short, wide ball that he murders through 
point with a mighty cut. A leg-bye concludes the over.
 
They’ve actually taken it early, which I didn’t realise, and now I’ve missed 
my chance to go to Tescos. Vending machine for crisps it it.
 
John Ryan is angry. John Ryan didn’t get up early for this kinda crap. John 
Ryan has not been watching Tests for too long. “Bangladesh’s only hope of ever 
being a competitive test team is if there’s a rule change that allows them to 
have a new ball at the beginning of every over,” he writes. “One of the most 
shambolic few hours of cricket I’ve ever seen.”
 
Bangladesh will have a mini session to negotiate before tea. In the meantime, 
Simon McMahon writes: “Morning Dan. I don’t know much about Belgian folk music, 
but I am going to Glasgow to see Justin Bieber tonight (escorting teenage 
daughters, that’s all, I’ve not got a ticket myself, you understand). 
Apparently he wants to be areal musician. Well, Justin, I want to play cricket 
like Ben Stokes and write songs like Neil Hannon, but it ain’t gonna happen. 
Anyway, cocktails on me if this Test is tied.”


I hate to say it but Biebs is a talented guy. I even quite like a couple of 
his songs though I couldn’t name any. I got a new guitar yesterday (early 
birthday present, thanks Liz!) and can’t do this.
 
82nd over: England 244 (Rashid 44) Taijul continues and beats Finn, before 
ending England’s resistance a couple of balls later. England have a slim lead 
but it’s in the balance.
 
That’s it. The new ball turns and bounces away from Finn’s bat. He follows it 
and gets the finest edge, which Mushfiqur takes well.
 
New ball taken

81st over: England 243-9 (Finn 0, Rashid 43) To no great surprise, and as you 
can see from that big chunky text above, Bangladesh take the new ball straight 
away. Their reviews have been topped up too, like a number of lives when you 
get 100 gold coins in the original Super Mario.

Mehedi, over the wicket, has the new ball as well as a slip, short-leg, 
leg-slip and shortish midwicket, and it’s the second of those who snares him 
with an excellent catch, diving to his left. Mehedi has six and England’s fine 
ninth-wicket stand comes to an end on 99.
 
Woakes’s fine stand comes to an end. He likes the look of an off-break, on his 
pads, and flicks it round the corner, straight into the hands of leg-slip.
