There's rarely a shortage of evening shows – it's sometimes actually harder to 
find a pub where there is no band or musician hard at work. But if nothing 
makes you happier than trying to make yourself heard over someone's shyly 
expressed hopes and dreams, then the open mic nights of Brighton are for you.

Two universities with excellent music facilities and a slew of music schools 
(one of the top 10 sights of the city must be the wannabes queueing up with 
their guitars outside theinstitute of modern music <http://www.bimm.co.uk/> – 
did Kurt Cobain do this?) mean that there is actually a good chance of catching 
something worth seeing; well-known local bands includeRizzle Kicks 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/rizzle-kicks>, British Sea Power 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/british-sea-power> and the Kooks 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/08/kooks-junk-of-the-heart-review>.

The best-known (and usually busiest) nights are at the Brunswick pub in Hove 
on Mondays, the Sidewinder in Kemp Town on Tuesdays, or the Victory in the 
Lanes on Thursdays. And if you're thinking of getting up on stage yourself, a 
few nights – like the White Rabbit in North Laine on Thursday, have a house 
guitar to hand too. Some (the Mucky Duck in Kemp Town, also on Thursdays) even 
give singers a beer.

Stay

Far too many people have fulfilled their lifelong dream of opening a B&B in 
Brighton and some of them should have stuck to accountancy. There are certain 
streets pocked, from top to bottom, with vacancy signs; it is not encouraging. 
Really, a far better way to get a taste of that famously buzzy Brighton 
lifestyle is to rent one of the gorgeous little holiday flats studded around 
the centre of the town. How else can you stock up on bacon and eggs for a 
leisurely breakfast on your seaview balcony, or, better still, an aromatic 
armful of fish and chips from one of the seafront stands? How else will you 
dish up a plateful of bangers and mash after a visit to the Brighton Sausage 
Company (28a Gloucester Road, 01273 676677,brightonsausageco.com 
<http://www.brightonsausageco.com/>)?
 Brighton Holiday Homes 
Luckily there is an incredible wealth of self-catering accommodation. Brighton 
Holiday Homes is one of several companies that specialise in holiday flats and 
offer accommodation that sleeps one, two or 20 people, with views over the sea, 
the Downs, or some nice local shops. They have flats lovingly resculpted by 
local architects, pocket penthouses or expansive regency townhouses. Roundwoods 
(a few miles outside Brighton, to be sure) even has a gigantic treehouse in the 
garden. In short, they have exactly what you need if you want to head down and 
just pretend you live here for a few days.
• Brighton Holiday Homes (01273 624459, brightonholidayhomes.co.uk 
<http://www.brightonholidayhomes.co.uk/>); one week at Roundwoods, sleeps six, 
from £595

Eat

When Daniel Defoe was touring Britain in the 18th century, he described 
Brighton (then Brighthelmstone) as "a poor fishing town, old built, and on the 
edge of the sea". And things just got worse over the next few years as the 
fishing industry started to fall away, leaving the town even more 
poverty-stricken. But then, in the early 19th century, the Prince Regent came 
and fell head over heels in love, sparking a revival and creating a tourist 
rush that would eventually become one of the town's largest industries.

In a nice combo of both trades, Jack Mills, a retired fisherman, and his wife, 
Linda, opened up their traditional smokery on the seafront fishing quarter with 
just over a decade ago. In that short time it has become an essential part of 
the landscape. They have built their own smokehouse, just across from their 
shop beneath the arches, and both tourists and locals can be found queuing up 
along the boardwalk for homemade fish soup or hot mackerel sandwiches. They've 
been picked up by the foodies too – Nigel Slater brought his TV crew down here 
to capture him eating their mackerel pâté. The crab sandwich is a particular 
hit.

Drink

Until recently Brighton was surprisingly short of nice wine bars, but a couple 
of years ago Simon Broad and Sam Devaney, both already in the trade, decided 
they wanted to open a place that specialised in unique vintages from unique 
vineyards. After a few happy trips personally hunting down fine wines in 
Europe, they opened up shop right in the heart of Brighton, in a bright, 
thoughtfully laid-out space in the new quarter built around the award-winning 
Jubilee library.
 Ten Green Bottles 
There are usually a dozen or so wines on the day's menu, from a crisp English 
Nyetimber to the juicy blackberry tones of a Spanish tempranillo. But if none 
of those take your fancy, you can choose from the many others (about 250 or 
more) on the shelves that line the walls. And though most are European, the 
pair are increasingly exploring the New World too. They've also sourced really 
good local cheeses and charcuterie to accompany their wines.

Buy

The centre of Brighton is one huge invitation to burn money, but at one of the 
best-known shops in Brighton – for locals, at least – shopping is a little 
frowned upon, unless you're doing it for the best possible reasons. The 
co-operatively run Infinity Foods first opened its doors in 1971, and now fills 
two generous shop spaces in the North Laine.
 Infinity Foods, Brighton 
The shop specialises in natural and ethical products, sourcing from local 
farms wherever possible, and there is no meat on the premises (I've seen food 
labels with suggested meat combinations scratched out). Recycling is – natch – 
encouraged, and there was a long in-store agony about whether to supply plastic 
bags or not (a recyclable alternative was eventually found). There are some 
good beauty products, delicious organic chocolates and a fantastic on-site 
bakery that turns out an exceptional loaf of sourdough, as well as a 
gluten-free white.

Unwind

A little doll's house of a treasure repository, Brighton Museum is packed to 
the rafters with odd and wonderful artefacts collected from random eccentric 
donors who have almost nothing in common beyond their fondness for a funny 
little town beside the sea.

The result is pleasing and sometimes discombobulating. Depending on which 
direction you walk in, you may find yourself contemplating African textiles, a 
wall of oral history recordings, a moped, or the original founder's collection 
of popular pottery. Upstairs the lovely bewilderment continues, with the 
collection rambling from a rustling Victorian dress through Indonesian water 
puppets through to displays of tattoos and body art.

Housed in the Pavilion grounds in a building that used to be the Prince 
Regent's stables (although a stables the like of which you have never 
imagined), the museum also puts on exhibitions such as the current celebration 
of fashion designer Barbara Hulanicki (Biba and Beyond,  
<http://www.brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/WhatsOn/Pages/BMAGBiba22Sep12to14Apr13.aspx>
 until 14 April). And in the first-floor Brighton history centre you can delve 
much more deeply into local roots.
