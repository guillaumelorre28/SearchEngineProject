Pew national poll sees a four-point race

Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by four points, 41-37, in a four-way race 
for president, according to a newPew Research national poll 
<http://www.people-press.org/2016/08/18/1-voters-general-election-preferences/>
. Polling averages have the (four-way) race going Clinton’s way by 43-37 (RCP 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/?state=nwa>) and 43-36 (HuffPost pollster 
<http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster>). 

MR BREXIT! is notably strong in the Pew poll among whites without a college 
degree, who support him 51-26 over Clinton. Women in the poll support Clinton 
over Trump 49-30 and black voters support her over him 85-2.

Hispanic respondents supported Clinton over Trump 50-26.


A lot of voters on both sides told Pew they’re casting votes against the other 
candidate as opposed to for their own:

Among Trump supporters, 44% say their choice is more a vote for Trump than a 
vote against Clinton, compared with 53% who say their vote is more against 
Clinton than for Trump. Those who support Clinton are slightly more likely to 
say their vote is more for the candidate (53%) than to say their vote is 
against Trump (46%).

Clinton calls for 'bonds of trust' between communities and police

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> spoke at 
her meeting with national law enforcement figures about shootings by police and 
of police, saying that “we must not inflame” the challenges or “stoke even more 
divisiveness.”

A pool report quotes Clinton:

“I think it’s obvious that recent events in Dallas, Baton Rouge, Milwaukee and 
across the country underscore how difficult and important work there is ahead 
of us to repair the bonds of trust and respect between our police officers and 
communities,” she said.

Clinton called the law enforcement leaders in the room “pioneers” in improving 
policing and thanked retiring NYC police commissioner Bill Bratton for his 
“lifetime of service,” the pool report said:

As press was ushered out, a participant asked her if she was going to ever get 
two days off campaigning. “I wish I could take two days off,” Clinton said, but 
added that she “loved” the work. The group is scheduled to discuss law 
enforcement issues for about an hour.

Hillary Clinton is about to leave the campaign trail and hit the fundraising 
circuit. Her meeting today with top law enforcement officers is her last “open” 
event this month, NBC News reports:
Monica Alba (@albamonica) 
After meeting with law enforcement today, HRC has no open events scheduled 
until end of the month. Instead: 15+ fundraisers in MA, CA, NY.

A statue depicting MR BREXIT! has been, not erected exactly, anyway here’s a 
picture from New York City’s Union Square earlier:

In fact such statues went up in five cities and they are the work of the 
anarchist collective INDECLINE, the Washington Postreports 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/08/18/anarchists-unveil-naked-donald-trump-statues-in-several-u-s-cities/?postshare=5111471536575781&tid=ss_tw>
:

The group unveiled a life-size statue of Trump in the nude Thursday morning in 
New York and reported that statues were also unveiled in public spaces in San 
Francisco, Los Angeles, Cleveland and Seattle, as well.

“The Emperor Has No Balls,” as the project is called, arrives several months 
after the groupcovered stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame

Here’s an INDECLINE video showing the statues being made:

Who could have been filling Trump’s head with thoughts of the Brexit precedent 
this morning?

After the Brexit vote in June, Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader and 
exuberant Brexit-er, thanked Steve Bannon, Trump’s new campaign captain, for 
Breitbart’s amazing coverage of the vote. (In addition to running Breitbart at 
the time, Bannon was a radio host.) As Breitbartreported 
<http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/06/24/nigel-farage-massive-thanks-breitbart-sides-pond-brexit-coverage/>
:

UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage told SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon 
on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily that Breitbart News was one of the few bright 
spots in generally dismal media coverage of the Brexit debate.

“I would like to think and hope that right across the globe, what we’ve done 
is to prove that people power — and we need a few good journalists like 
Breitbart, writing and talking about these things — but people powercan beat 
the establishment, if they try hard enough,” said Farage.

Bannon congratulated Farage, UKIP, and the rest of the Leave coalition for a 
hard-won “David versus Goliath” victory that seemed impossible at the outset, 
as portrayed by most U.K. and U.S. media. “It’s just been extraordinary,” said 
Bannon, who is the Executive Chairman of Breitbart News.

“Well, it certainly has been,” Farage agreed. “And can I just say a massive 
thanks to Breitbart, on both sides of the pond? Because you guys have been fair 
with me, and given me a chance to make my arguments. I thank you guys very much 
indeed for that.”

While Trump has reportedly been receiving Bannon’s counsel for some time, he 
apparently wasn’t paying too much attention in late June, when he professed 
ignorance on the Brexit issue but a gut tendency to back Leave.

million in Fl, NC, OH, and PA.

$1.3 M of that is Florida. Does not include cable yet. Will get bigger

First ad buy from Trump is modest. $270k in FL, $72k in OH, $78k in PA. 
Pro-Clinton side already spent $23m in FL, $17m in OH, $6m in PA.

MR BREXIT! once send he would spend a billion dollars on the campaign, later 
said he does not need to spend as much on ads because he gets so much free 
media, and now appears to be embarking on a more orthodox, if flimsily 
executed, campaign strategy.

Obama to travel to China to promote TPP

President Obama will travel to China and Laos September 2-9, 2016, the White 
House has announced.

On the agenda, according to the White House statement: promoting the 
Trans-Pacific Partnership:

This trip will highlight the President’s ongoing commitment to the G-20 as the 
premier forum for international economic cooperation as well as the U.S. 
Rebalance to Asia and the Pacific. [...]

This visit also will support the President’s efforts to expand opportunities 
for American businesses and workers to sell their products in some of the 
world’s fastest-growing markets. Central to this effort is the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership, the high-standards trade agreement that will unlock key markets to 
American exports and cement America’s economic leadership in the Asia-Pacific.

What will MR BREXIT! think of that?

Sanders won't disclose personal finances

Bernie Sanders has a new deadline for filing his personal financial 
disclosure: never.

As a presidential candidate, Sanders requested and received two extensions to 
a personal financial disclosure filing deadline (MR BREXIT! bragged about 
meeting the deadline). Now that Sanders is not a candidate, he has no plans to 
make the disclosure, a spokesman told the Center for Public integrity:


Now that Sanders’ second extension has expired, spokesman Michael Briggs 
confirmed to theCenter for Public Integrity 
<http://www.publicintegrity.org/politics> that the senator won’t file a 
presidential campaign personal financial disclosure after all.

<https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/08/17/20074/how-bernie-sanders-beat-clock-and-avoided-disclosure>

“We were told that since the senator no longer is a candidate there was no 
requirement to file,” Briggs said.

What do you think – should Sanders make the disclosure? Is he hiding 
something? Is it any of our business? Earlier this month heclosed

 on a $575,000 vacation home in Vermont. Is that too much for a populist hero?

The Guardian’s Sabrina Siddiqui reports today on concerns of former Sanders 
supporters that their agenda will be shelved now that Clinton is courting 
Republicans. From the piece:

Her concern, like many Sanders supporters, is whether his radical platform 
taking on Wall Street and corporate interests, and offering free college 
tuition, will be discarded as she courtsRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans>.

Bower is “terrified” of a Trump presidency but voiced concerns with Clinton’s 
balancing act.

“I think she’s saying what she needs to say to pull people from Trump, which 
is a good thing,” she said, “but I don’t know when she’s being sincere and when 
she’s just doing what she needs to in order to get elected.

“I just feel like she’s been in the system for so long, how could she not be 
part of the system?”

For four months, Larry Sabato and his cohorts at the University of Virginia’s 
center for politics have been forecasting a 347-191 electoral college victory 
for Hillary Clinton. This morning they have changed their forecast to 348-190 
for Clinton, sensing a Democratic drift in the second congressional district in 
Nebraska, which is one of two states that splits its electoral votes. Do they 
know what they’re talking about?You be the judge 
<http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-rises-to-348-electoral-votes-trump-drops-to-190/>
. Here’s a bit from their analysis:

We are putting Clinton over the 270-mark in the Electoral College (273 
electoral votes, to be precise) with states we have classified as Likely 
Democratic or Safe Democratic. Clinton had previously been at 269 in those 
categories. To us, this means that Trump has to find a way not just to sweep 
all Republican states and the remaining states classified Leans Democratic (see 
our map, below) but to dislodge at least one Likely or Safe Democratic state. 
Anything can happen over the next dozen weeks, but we wouldn’t recommend 
betting your children’s college funds on a Trump administration.

The Sabato map does not detect any tossup states. That judgment is not unique 
among pros. The map almost exactly resembles FiveThirtyEight’spolls-plus model 
<http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus>
, which bakes in polling numbers with other fundamentals such as economic stats 
and historical data.

Here’s a basic version of the map (but visit Sabato’s site 
<http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-rises-to-348-electoral-votes-trump-drops-to-190/>
 for subtleties and analysis):

If you like electoral college maps but haven’t discovered 270towin.com

 on why Florida is MR BREXIT!’s “best swing state”:

Florida is the only battleground that moved in Trump’s direction after both 
conventions.Seven states 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/polls-clinton-running-table-key-battlegrounds-n629136>
 were surveyed byNBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-ahead-trump-midwest-battlegrounds-n626541>
 before and after. In North Carolina, Trump went from down 6 points to down 9 
points; in Virginia, from down 9 to down 13; in Colorado, from down 8 to down 
14. In Florida, he went from down 7 todown 5 
<https://www.scribd.com/document/321009712/NBC-News-WSJ-Marist-Poll-Florida-Annotated-Questionnaire-August-2016>
.

Down 5 points is obviously not a good place to be, and the last poll to show 
Trump ahead in Florida came out in early July. But it’s one of many data points 
that underscore hisrelativestrength down there.

Which is more predictive of electoral success, crowd size or polling? A debate 
on the question broke out on Fox News. Dana Perino, one of George W Bush’s 
press secretaries, points out that in the very most recent presidential 
election, Republicans were saying the polls were wrong, but they weren’t. To 
say that her voice of reason falls on deaf ears fails to capture the 
mystification that crosses her face:

Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White 
House.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has announced 
on Twitter that he will soon be known as “MR. BREXIT!” It’s unclear what he 
means as he is not an EU member country. Here’s the tweet:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT!

2016 <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/766246213079498752> 
Trump may mean that, as the Brexit vote confounded late-stage polls seeming to 
show momentum in the direction of Remain, he will make fools of pollsters 
currently showing him losing by a lot everywhere. Which polls? You know the 
answer: all of them. (Seriously:all of them

We’re going to wrap up our live blog politics coverage for the day.

Click here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/18/donald-trump-mr-brexit-tweet>
 for today’s Campaign Minute summary – and see you back here tomorrow!
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is scheduled to 
host a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, this evening. This 
afternoon, like Clinton, he met with law enforcement figures:

Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by four points, 41-37, in a four-way race 
for president, according to a newPew Research national poll 
<http://www.people-press.org/2016/08/18/1-voters-general-election-preferences/>
. Polling averages have the (four-way) race going Clinton’s way by 43-37 (RCP 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/?state=nwa>) and 43-36 (HuffPost pollster 
<http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster>). 

MR BREXIT! is notably strong in the Pew poll among whites without a college 
degree, who support him 51-26 over Clinton. Women in the poll support Clinton 
over Trump 49-30 and black voters support her over him 85-2.

Hispanic respondents supported Clinton over Trump 50-26.


A lot of voters on both sides told Pew they’re casting votes against the other 
candidate as opposed to for their own:

Among Trump supporters, 44% say their choice is more a vote for Trump than a 
vote against Clinton, compared with 53% who say their vote is more against 
Clinton than for Trump. Those who support Clinton are slightly more likely to 
say their vote is more for the candidate (53%) than to say their vote is 
against Trump (46%).
 
The Trump TV ad buy is bigger than it first appeared (see earlier

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> spoke at 
her meeting with national law enforcement figures about shootings by police and 
of police, saying that “we must not inflame” the challenges or “stoke even more 
divisiveness.”

A pool report quotes Clinton:

“I think it’s obvious that recent events in Dallas, Baton Rouge, Milwaukee and 
across the country underscore how difficult and important work there is ahead 
of us to repair the bonds of trust and respect between our police officers and 
communities,” she said.

Clinton called the law enforcement leaders in the room “pioneers” in improving 
policing and thanked retiring NYC police commissioner Bill Bratton for his 
“lifetime of service,” the pool report said:

As press was ushered out, a participant asked her if she was going to ever get 
two days off campaigning. “I wish I could take two days off,” Clinton said, but 
added that she “loved” the work. The group is scheduled to discuss law 
enforcement issues for about an hour.

Hillary Clinton is about to leave the campaign trail and hit the fundraising 
circuit. Her meeting today with top law enforcement officers is her last “open” 
event this month, NBC News reports:

After meeting with law enforcement today, HRC has no open events scheduled 
until end of the month. Instead: 15+ fundraisers in MA, CA, NY.

In fact such statues went up in five cities and they are the work of the 
anarchist collective INDECLINE, the Washington Postreports 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/08/18/anarchists-unveil-naked-donald-trump-statues-in-several-u-s-cities/?postshare=5111471536575781&tid=ss_tw>
:

The group unveiled a life-size statue of Trump in the nude Thursday morning in 
New York and reported that statues were also unveiled in public spaces in San 
Francisco, Los Angeles, Cleveland and Seattle, as well.

“The Emperor Has No Balls,” as the project is called, arrives several months 
after the groupcovered stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame

Here’s an INDECLINE video showing the statues being made:
 
Who could have been filling Trump’s head with thoughts of the Brexit precedent 
this morning?

After the Brexit vote in June, Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader and 
exuberant Brexit-er, thanked Steve Bannon, Trump’s new campaign captain, for 
Breitbart’s amazing coverage of the vote. (In addition to running Breitbart at 
the time, Bannon was a radio host.) As Breitbartreported 
<http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/06/24/nigel-farage-massive-thanks-breitbart-sides-pond-brexit-coverage/>
:

UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage told SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon 
on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily that Breitbart News was one of the few bright 
spots in generally dismal media coverage of the Brexit debate.

“I would like to think and hope that right across the globe, what we’ve done 
is to prove that people power — and we need a few good journalists like 
Breitbart, writing and talking about these things — but people powercan beat 
the establishment, if they try hard enough,” said Farage.

Bannon congratulated Farage, UKIP, and the rest of the Leave coalition for a 
hard-won “David versus Goliath” victory that seemed impossible at the outset, 
as portrayed by most U.K. and U.S. media. “It’s just been extraordinary,” said 
Bannon, who is the Executive Chairman of Breitbart News.

“Well, it certainly has been,” Farage agreed. “And can I just say a massive 
thanks to Breitbart, on both sides of the pond? Because you guys have been fair 
with me, and given me a chance to make my arguments. I thank you guys very much 
indeed for that.”

While Trump has reportedly been receiving Bannon’s counsel for some time, he 
apparently wasn’t paying too much attention in late June, when he professed 
ignorance on the Brexit issue but a gut tendency to back Leave.
 
Long-promised TV ad buys by the Trump campaign are finally on the books – but 
the numbers aren’t overwhelming:

UPDATE: the new numbers are bigger:

MR BREXIT! once send he would spend a billion dollars on the campaign, later 
said he does not need to spend as much on ads because he gets so much free 
media, and now appears to be embarking on a more orthodox, if flimsily 
executed, campaign strategy.
 
President Obama will travel to China and Laos September 2-9, 2016, the White 
House has announced.

On the agenda, according to the White House statement: promoting the 
Trans-Pacific Partnership:

This trip will highlight the President’s ongoing commitment to the G-20 as the 
premier forum for international economic cooperation as well as the U.S. 
Rebalance to Asia and the Pacific. [...]

This visit also will support the President’s efforts to expand opportunities 
for American businesses and workers to sell their products in some of the 
world’s fastest-growing markets. Central to this effort is the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership, the high-standards trade agreement that will unlock key markets to 
American exports and cement America’s economic leadership in the Asia-Pacific.

What will MR BREXIT! think of that? 
 
Bernie Sanders has a new deadline for filing his personal financial 
disclosure: never.

As a presidential candidate, Sanders requested and received two extensions to 
a personal financial disclosure filing deadline (MR BREXIT! bragged about 
meeting the deadline). Now that Sanders is not a candidate, he has no plans to 
make the disclosure, a spokesman told the Center for Public integrity:


Now that Sanders’ second extension has expired, spokesman Michael Briggs 
confirmed to theCenter for Public Integrity 
<http://www.publicintegrity.org/politics> that the senator won’t file a 
presidential campaign personal financial disclosure after all.

Click here to read the Center for Public Integrity version of this story. 
<https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/08/17/20074/how-bernie-sanders-beat-clock-and-avoided-disclosure>

“We were told that since the senator no longer is a candidate there was no 
requirement to file,” Briggs said.

What do you think – should Sanders make the disclosure? Is he hiding 
something? Is it any of our business? Earlier this month heclosed

 on a $575,000 vacation home in Vermont. Is that too much for a populist hero?

The Guardian’s Sabrina Siddiqui reports today on concerns of former Sanders 
supporters that their agenda will be shelved now that Clinton is courting 
Republicans. From the piece:

Her concern, like many Sanders supporters, is whether his radical platform 
taking on Wall Street and corporate interests, and offering free college 
tuition, will be discarded as she courtsRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans>.

Bower is “terrified” of a Trump presidency but voiced concerns with Clinton’s 
balancing act.

“I think she’s saying what she needs to say to pull people from Trump, which 
is a good thing,” she said, “but I don’t know when she’s being sincere and when 
she’s just doing what she needs to in order to get elected.

“I just feel like she’s been in the system for so long, how could she not be 
part of the system?”

For four months, Larry Sabato and his cohorts at the University of Virginia’s 
center for politics have been forecasting a 347-191 electoral college victory 
for Hillary Clinton. This morning they have changed their forecast to 348-190 
for Clinton, sensing a Democratic drift in the second congressional district in 
Nebraska, which is one of two states that splits its electoral votes. Do they 
know what they’re talking about?You be the judge 
<http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-rises-to-348-electoral-votes-trump-drops-to-190/>
. Here’s a bit from their analysis:

We are putting Clinton over the 270-mark in the Electoral College (273 
electoral votes, to be precise) with states we have classified as Likely 
Democratic or Safe Democratic. Clinton had previously been at 269 in those 
categories. To us, this means that Trump has to find a way not just to sweep 
all Republican states and the remaining states classified Leans Democratic (see 
our map, below) but to dislodge at least one Likely or Safe Democratic state. 
Anything can happen over the next dozen weeks, but we wouldn’t recommend 
betting your children’s college funds on a Trump administration.

The Sabato map does not detect any tossup states. That judgment is not unique 
among pros. The map almost exactly resembles FiveThirtyEight’spolls-plus model 
<http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus>
, which bakes in polling numbers with other fundamentals such as economic stats 
and historical data.

Here’s a basic version of the map (but visit Sabato’s site 
<http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-rises-to-348-electoral-votes-trump-drops-to-190/>
 for subtleties and analysis):

Update: also read James Hohman in the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2016/08/18/daily-202-why-florida-is-trump-s-best-swing-state/57b50086cd249a2fe363ba26/?postshare=8261471524775146&tid=ss_tw>
 on why Florida is MR BREXIT!’s “best swing state”:

Florida is the only battleground that moved in Trump’s direction after both 
conventions.Seven states 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/polls-clinton-running-table-key-battlegrounds-n629136>
 were surveyed byNBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-ahead-trump-midwest-battlegrounds-n626541>
 before and after. In North Carolina, Trump went from down 6 points to down 9 
points; in Virginia, from down 9 to down 13; in Colorado, from down 8 to down 
14. In Florida, he went from down 7 todown 5 
<https://www.scribd.com/document/321009712/NBC-News-WSJ-Marist-Poll-Florida-Annotated-Questionnaire-August-2016>
.

Down 5 points is obviously not a good place to be, and the last poll to show 
Trump ahead in Florida came out in early July. But it’s one of many data points 
that underscore hisrelativestrength down there.
 
Which is more predictive of electoral success, crowd size or polling? A debate 
on the question broke out on Fox News. Dana Perino, one of George W Bush’s 
press secretaries, points out that in the very most recent presidential 
election, Republicans were saying the polls were wrong, but they weren’t. To 
say that her voice of reason falls on deaf ears fails to capture the 
mystification that crosses her face:

Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White 
House.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has announced 
on Twitter that he will soon be known as “MR. BREXIT!” It’s unclear what he 
means as he is not an EU member country. Here’s the tweet:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT!

Trump may mean that, as the Brexit vote confounded late-stage polls seeming to 
show momentum in the direction of Remain, he will make fools of pollsters 
currently showing him losing by a lot everywhere. Which polls? You know the 
answer: all of them. (Seriously:all of them
