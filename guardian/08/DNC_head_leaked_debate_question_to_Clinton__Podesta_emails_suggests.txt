A new batch of emails leaked by WikiLeaks from the Gmail account of John 
Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, were released on Monday, seeming 
to show Donna Brazile, the interim head of the Democratic National Committee 
and a CNN contributor, giving Clinton a heads up about a likely debate question 
the day before she was due to take onBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> at a primary debate.

Brazile 2 weeks ago: "I never had access to questions and would never have 
shared them with the candidates if I did"

A woman did ask about the Flint water crisis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/flint-water-crisis> at the next debate.

On 11 October, Brazile released a statement – after earlier Podesta emails 
supposedly showed Brazile leaking a CNN town hall question – declaring: “As it 
pertains to theCNN <https://www.theguardian.com/media/cnn> debates, I never had 
access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I 
did.”

A CNN spokeswoman said the network was “completely uncomfortable” with the 
news that Brazile allegedly leaked a debate question to Clinton’s campaign. In 
a statement, Lauren Pratapas said:

On October 14th, CNN accepted Donna Brazile’s resignation as a CNN 
contributor. (Her deal had previously been suspended in July when she became 
the interim head of the DNC.) CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, 
prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of 
a town hall or debate. We are completely uncomfortable with what we have 
learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN 
contributor.

In another message released on Monday, Podesta emails Neera Tanden, the 
president of Center for American Progress, about Clinton’s prospects and 
questions her “instincts” in the campaign.

WikiLeaks has been publishing batches of the leaked emails all month, after 
publishing leaks from the DNC’s emails in October. Podesta and the Clinton 
campaign have refused to confirm the emails are genuine.
