When MP Andy Burnham announced his bid to become Labour’s Manchester mayoral 
candidate, his opinion on the city’s music scene was curiously downbeat. “The 
Manchester of my youth was the most vibrant place when it came to music. We’ve 
maybe lost a little bit of that,” he told the Guardian.

It is a view that many share – not just out-of-touch fortysomething 
politicians. From the film24 Hour Party People 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/05/culture.peterbradshaw> to the 
recentStone Roses’ stadium gigs  
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/19/stone-roses-manchester-etihad-stadium-review-house-party>
in the city, it can feel, certainly from a distance, that Manchester is now 
permanently mired in Madchester nostalgia.

It does not help that few of the stories emanating from modern Manchester are 
of wild sub-cultural creativity. Instead, nationally, the city is perceived 
through regeneration projects such asSpinningfields 
<http://alliedlondon.com/development/spinningfields/> – a kind of toy-town 
Canary Wharf – or the race among the city’s restaurants to bag a Michelin star 
– an example of the kind of establishment validation Manchester once scorned.

Yet, beneath all that glitter, independent, left-field Manchester is thriving. 
The underground club scene is as vibrant as it has been in 20 years and, 
musically, there is a huge diversity of interesting work being made here – from 
the internationally renowned techno label Modern Love or Manc grime MC Bugzy 
Malone to Liz Preston’s gorgeous looped-cello folk. The same is true in other 
fields. As well as headline-grabbing arts developments such asHOME 
<http://homemcr.org/> and the new Whitworth Art Gallery 
<http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/>, several small, artist-run galleries 
and studio-event spaces are giving the arts scene new life. The city’s railway 
arches house an extraordinary concentration of innovative breweries and, even 
among the city centre’s restaurants (where, too often, money talks and 
creativity walks), a hardcore of indies continues to defy the odds and serve 
incredible food.

In short, Manchester’s stubborn DIY spirit is undimmed. This is still a 
creative city. Here is a selection of that activity.

Manchester’s once “alternative” Northern Quarter is increasingly besieged by 
hen dos and identikit bars, but Soup Kitchen remains defiantly left-field. 
Upstairs in the bar, you might find anyone from electro-punks Trash-O-Rama to 
Manchester techno outliers Space Afrika, DJing into the small hours. 
Downstairs, in the grimy basement, there are gigs early doors (anything from 
the latest psych weirdos to alt pop star Jessy Lanza), before the club nights 
kick in. Outside of dancehall and grime party, Swing Ting, expect a rolling 
programme of the sharpest names in US/European house and techno. “Speakers 
hanging from chains, walls blasted with sweat, that small, amazing dance floor. 
It’s my favourite city-centre venue,” says Thomas Ragsdale from the band
Worriedaboutsatan <http://worriedaboutsatan.tumblr.com/> (see playlist below, 
and playingThe Castle <http://thecastlehotel.info/> on 9 August).

mantramcr.co.uk <http://www.mantramcr.co.uk/>), Hidden is, almost literally, 
hidden on the edge of the city centre. A rough-edged, industrial space in an 
off-grid location, it attracts a self-selecting group of dedicated clubbers to 
nights that might include a showcase by sprawlingManc bass collective Levelz 
<https://www.facebook.com/Levelzmcr>, or slots from Berlin-based techno titans 
such as Levon Vincent. “Purpose-built clubs seem so sterile now, whereas on the

struck a chord,” says Homoelectric DJ and promoter Jamie Bull.

It may look like a 1990s cafe-bar but, after dark, Night & Day is – along with 
theRuby Lounge <http://www.therubylounge.com/> – one of the few city-centre 
venues still pushing new local bands. It’s a stalwart indie venue but an 
important one, says Blossoms’ bassist Chaz Salt. “It has served as a live 
stronghold for a hatful of great bands over the past 25 years. We love the fact 
that it’s escaped closure and that, strangely, it used to be a chippy.”

 Merseyside ‘avant noise’ band Barberos at Islington Mill. 
On the city centre’s border with Salford, the Mill is both an important 
complex of creative studios and gallery space. “It’s the mothership of 
Salford’s burgeoning grassroots arts ecology,” says Buy Art Fair’s Thom 
Hetherington, and a late-night-into-next-day rave space, where things get 
seriously strange, both on- and off-stage. “I’ve had brilliant nights here,” 
says Ragsdale, who is also half of electronic duo Worriedaboutsatan. “It’s 
incredibly welcoming and I love how, one week, you can see intense experimental 
hip-hop like Dälek and the next hazy dub techno.”

Blackjack Brewery’s Smithfield is a resolutely old-school boozer – bar 
skittles, dart board, pork pies – with an A1 craft beer selection. “It’s homely 
and DIY but the beer’s progressive. It’s a model for the contemporary pub,” 
says Runaway Brewery owner Mark Welsby. “If you’re unlucky, you might find one 
of our brewers banging out Toto’s Africa on the piano.”

This basement bar is, arguably, the place to get a taste of what is happening 
on Manchester’s beer scene. All of its beers (five cask, four keg) come from 
within a radius of 25 miles of St Anne’s Square, with local heroes such as 
Squawk, First Chop, Track and Beer Nouveau well-represented. “The owners are 
passionate, so expect cask beer in tip-top condition,” says Welsby.

This pizzeria comes correct. Its dough is proved for 24 hours, dressed with 
fine ingredients (San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce, wild broccoli and lardo 
on its white pizzas), and blast-cooked for 60 seconds in an imported clay oven. 
That process produces ethereally light bases persuasively blistered with char. 
Decent spritz cocktails and beers from Manchester’s excellent Cloudwater seal 
the deal. Expect to queue at peak times.

Calm, precise and executed with feeling: that could describe both Yuzu’s 
Japanese food and the cool bebop jazz soundtrack that accompanies it. The 
flavours are as intense as they are fresh in Yuzu’s sashimi, tempura and noodle 
bowls and its legendary “kara-age” fried chicken. “The sashimi’s beautifully 
prepared but the quality of the cooked rice, orgohan, sets Yuzu apart. It’s a 
key ingredient that others often overlook,” says food bloggerHungry Hoss

Simon Shaw’s new-ish El Gato Negro is that rare top-end Manchester restaurant 
that is still an owner-operated indie. Inspired by modern Barcelona tapas 
joints, the food is vibrant and it is a sassy, stylish space (complete with 
ground-floor jamón and gin bar). Try the Josper-grilled onglet with its soft, 
slow-cooked tangle of potatoes and peppers or the lemon baby chicken with 
romesco sauce.

Siam Smiles 
 Photograph: Rebecca Lupton 
Bright, friendly and super-basic, this supermarket cafe serves (probably) the 
best Thai food in Manchester. Go steady with those homemade chilli dipping 
sauces. They take no prisoners. Try thekao moo grob (crispy pork belly with 
jasmine rice) or the Isaan-stylesom tam papaya salad with baby salted crabs. 
“It’s some of the best Thai I’ve eaten outside of Thailand,” says Hungry Hoss.

 Artworks at Paper, inside Mirabel Studios 
Open Saturdays-only, these two consistently fascinating spaces are hidden 
withinMirabel Studios <http://www.mirabelstudios.co.uk/>. Paper is a minuscule 
commercial gallery that focuses on, yes, paper. “That’s the unifying medium but 
it’s endlessly reimagined through painting, drawing or sculpture,” says 
Hetherington. PS Mirabel is an artist-run studio/exhibition space whose themed 
shows, inspired by anything from “concrete” to the industrial north, are 
usually witty, warped good fun.

Burgess fans will enjoy the exhibits, but TIABF also hosts a broad programme 
of talks, book launches, art events and intimate gigs (such as an evening with 
piano maverick Hauschka). “It’s a fitting tribute to one of the city’s 
favourite literary sons,” says Hetherington.

Castlefield Gallery 

A stark, angular space showing spiky modern art, Castlefield nurtures northern 
artists, while maintaining a global outlook. This month, Diagonal Noise, an 
exhibition of existing and site-specific, multi-disciplinary work from several 
Belgian artists, will, as part of the gallery’s Launch Pad series, give way to

Slowly, inner-city Ancoats warehouses are being colonised by the art crowd. 
Hope Mill is home to 120 artist-makers (look out forAwol Studios 
<http://www.awol-studios.co.uk/studios>’ open-day events), as well as 
pioneering commercial galleryComme Ça <http://www.commecaart.com/> and the new 
fringe Hope Mill Theatre. “Hope Mill has previously hostedArt Battle Manchester 
<https://www.facebook.com/ArtBattleManchester>, too,” says Hetherington. 
“That’s a brilliantly energetic live, competitive painting event.”
