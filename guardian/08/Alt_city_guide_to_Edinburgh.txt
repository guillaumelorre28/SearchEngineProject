It is easy to visit Edinburgh and feel you have not got under its skin. During 
the festival you are more likely to meet Oxbridge students doing satirical 
street theatre than locals and, even outside of that jamboree, this 
visitor-oriented city maintains an unreal air. Edinburgh can feel like an 
improbably handsome stage set where, from Michelin-star restaurants to smart 
museums, high-quality leisure activities abound at the expense of less 
commercial, distinctive creativity. Where is the real Edinburgh? Does it even 
exist? Well, yes, if you know where to look.

There are locals who complain that, even in the arts, Edinburgh is too 
complacently bourgeois. Music, they sigh, suffers particularly. But tell that to
hip-hop trio Young Fathers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/30/young-fathers-mercury-music-prize-winners-interview>
, who have railed against what they described to the Guardian as: “A city for 
tourists and rich, middle-class people.” Similarly, a core of small, 
idiosyncratic Edinburgh labels such as Song, By Toad, Gerry Loves Records and 
Firecracker are putting out innovative, off-beam music here, despite a dearth 
of music venues (OTT local noise restrictions are often blamed for that). A 
network of clubs persist, however, supporting a tight-knit local scene that – 
this is Scotland, remember – knows how to party, as veterans of the seasonal 
Nightvision events will tell you.

Finding space to pursue quieter creativity is less problematic, in a city 
where every publican recognises the value of offering not just pints, but 
poetry or theatre nights, too. This is a city of ingrained creativity, 
particularly in the visual arts, and grassroots activity blossoms even in the 
shadows of the big, publicly funded institutions.

And when it comes to food and drink, all those tourists are a boon – a weight 
of numbers that means cutting-edge restaurants and bars generally find an 
audience. In grub and booze, there is always something happening in Edinburgh.

This loud, boisterous box holds just 100 people but it is essential to 
Edinburgh’s underground. It hosts live gigs and club nights and encompasses 
everything from psych-folk to brute techno. “It’s one of the few places that 
still has that anarchic, 1990s basement feel to it,” says Lindsay Todd, whose 
left-field house label, Firecracker, runs a bi-monthly night here. “It’s 
intimate, it has a friendly, knowledgeable crowd, and the guy that runs it, 
Nick Stewart, is really passionate.”

The Dissection Room

A one-time veterinary college, Summerhall is now a creative fulcrum housing 
artists’ studios, galleries, a brewery and a gin distillery. The Dissection 
Room, a gig space mainly used by touring bands, is booked by Summerhall’s team, 
under the ironic bannerNothing Ever Happens Here

The Jazz Bar

Despite its name and its candlelit tables, this basement jazz bar is full of 
musical surprises. “It’s one of my faves,” says DJ Eclair Fifi, an Edinburgh 
native and key member of the LuckyMe collective, a record label and design 
studio. “I love popping in for a malt whisky and not knowing what you’re going 
to get. I’ve seen free jazz there, brass bands, also Moodymann playing live.”

The Mash House 


At this refuge for discerning clubbers and gig-goers, look out for No Strings 
Attached parties, with guests such as Optimo and Andrew Weatherall, and events 
by the roving Braw Gigs, who push experimental music of all stripes. “You can 
maybe fit 300 in there and, these days, the smaller the venue, the better the 
vibe,” says Todd.

The Banshee Labyrinth

Relax. Any blood-curdling screams you hear in “Scotland’s most haunted 
nightclub” will probably come from a thrash metal band or some experimental 
noise act’s malfunctioning hardware. These vaults contain seven rooms wherein 
regular punk and metal nights are accompanied by (free) cult cinema screenings 
and occasional off-the-wall electronic gigs. Says Todd: “It’s a real punky 
dive, and when it goes off, it’s a great little vibe.”

DRINK

Salt Horse

This new, 12-tap craft beer bar and bottle shop has “a stupidly good range of 
local stuff and incredible imports”, according to Patrick Jones of Leith’s 
Pilot Brewery. “It’s £2 corkage if you want to take something through to the 
bar from the shop.” Schooners from £3.

Bramble

This pioneering cocktail spot is now bar royalty, regularly namechecked among 
the world’s best bars. Try the Bramble (gin, lemon juice, sugar syrup, crème de 
mures) and go with the flow, advises Chris Molyneaux, creator of local gin 
Daffy’s: “Take a seat at the bar, trust the staff’s recommendations and you’ll 
experience flavour combinations unlike anywhere else.” Cocktails from £7.

Brass Monkey

Head through the beautiful Victorian galley bar at this student favourite and 
you will find a large back room where, daily at 3pm, they screen films free. 
“It’s like an adult soft-play area,” says Edinburgh papercut artist Boo 
Paterson. “It’s all mattresses. You take your shoes off and everyone lies 
together in a hippy way. There is an Edinburgh that’s quite reserved, but this 
isn’t at all.” Pint from £3.30. There’s also a sister bar (pictured) in Leith.
• 14 Drummond Street, 0131-556 1961, no website. And also at 362 Leith Walk

Devil’s Advocate

What Molyneaux describes as Edinburgh’s cocktail renaissance owes much to 
Stuart McCluskey, owner of bar-bistro the Bon Vivant and this converted 
Victorian pump house. As well as its creative cocktails, Devil’s Advocate also 
celebrates whiskies – not just Scottish single malts, but creations from such 
far-flung corners as Denmark, South Africa and, of course, Japan. Cocktails 
from £7.

Sandy Bell’s

A place of pilgrimage for traditional musicians, Bell’s has hosted nightly 
folk sessions since 1942. “I wouldn’t necessarily buy a ticket for a folk gig,” 
says Boo Paterson, “but the atmosphere here is incredible. You sometimes get 
uptight tourists in – in kagoules, who feel they aren’t part of the scene – but 
they soon start clapping and smiling. It’s a great example of how music can 
transcend language barriers.” Pint from £3.35.

FOOD


Timberyard

In this hip, post-industrial space, the Radford family have created what is 
arguably Edinburgh’s most exciting restaurant, influenced by Nordic cooking and 
the abundant Scottish larder. Son Ben is a whirl of smoking, foraging and 
pickling activity, creating dishes such as beef tartare with cured quail’s egg 
yolk, toasted buckwheat, daikon and shallot. Elsewhere, other Radfords ensure 
that everything from the natural wines to the homemade cocktail syrups are 
on-point. “It’s quite out there for Edinburgh,” says Hilary Sturzaker of 
restaurant consultancyMy Monkfish <http://mymonkfish.com/>: “Whatever is 
on-trend they nail it, without trying too hard.” Four courses, £55.

Indaba

It sounds an improbable mix – Spanish, South African and Scottish tapas – but 
Elaine Mason, co-owner of soup bar Union Of Genius, insists Indaba is a keeper. 
“Everybody I recommend it to looks at me like, what? But it’s outstanding. 
Charlton, who’s South African, runs it with his Spanish wife, Begoña, and they 
dial up the flavours the way I like. Give me those slow-cooked honey and chilli 
ribs, and everything else can wait.” Tapas £4.75-£8.25.

L’Escargot Bleu 

Edinburgh hardly lacks French restaurants, but for Edward Murray, chef at the 
renowned Gardener’s Cottage restaurant, this is the doozy. “Fred Berkmiller is 
an avid Slow Food supporter; he sources impeccably and serves very carefully 
prepared, classic bistro food,” says Ed, who loves the Isle of Barra snail 
gratin with Pernot butter. Mains from £15.90.

Ting Thai Caravan 

If you’re looking for street food in Edinburgh, check the Pitt 
<http://www.thepitt.co.uk/> market in Leith or Stockbridge Market 
<http://www.stockbridgemarket.com/stockbridge.html> and its various spin-offs 
(tips: Harajuku Kitchen, Alplings, Babu Bombay, Orinoco). Alternatively, head 
to this busy, fast-paced Thai street food kitchen – no web presence, cash only, 
communal seating - where the eponymous chef Ting knocks out first-rate jungle 
curries,som tam or nam tok nua beef salads. Co-owner Malcolm Innes recently 
opened the ratedWildmanwood Pizza  <https://www.facebook.com/wildmanwoodpizza/>
(27 Marshall Street).

Smith & Gertrude 

One of those newfangled, casual wine bars, S&G has a long menu of interesting 
wines, many available by the glass, a stash of vinyl you can play on the bar’s 
turntable, and impeccable British and French cheeses and charcuterie. “What 
more could you want?” asks Murray. Plates £3.50-£5.50.

CULTURE


Rhubaba 

This artist-run studio and exhibition/performance space is one of Edinburgh’s 
most interesting hidden gems, according to Julie-Ann Delaney, curator at the
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art 
<https://www.nationalgalleries.org/visit/introduction-118>. Experimental gigs 
and interactive exhibitions rub shoulders with shows encompassing every 
creative medium, from film to ceramics. The gallery is also home to an amateur 
choir who occasionally dip into the work of Iggy Pop.
• 25 Arthur Street, rhubaba.org <http://www.rhubaba.org/>

The Forest 

A non-profit, volunteer-run, vegetarian arts cafe, Forest has bounced around 
Edinburgh for 16 years, defying the odds and acting as a quirky gallery/ 
installation space hosting anything from Tibetan song sessions to political 
film nights. The Forest has also spawned a separate artist studio complex, 
Forest Centre+, with a gallery in Leith for emerging art,Interview Room 11 
<http://ir11.org.uk/>.

The Number Shop 

The exhibition space at the artist-run Number Shop shows unusually adventurous 
contemporary art from 12 in-house artists plus various local and international 
guests. Expect weird and witty, brain-flipping works in anything from video and 
illustration to avant-garde sculpture and installation.

Village Pub Theatre

Held in Leith pub the Village, this monthly pop-up theatre is where some of 
Scotland’s hottest new playwrights try out material. “It shows 10-minute plays 
with homebaking and beer,” says Paterson. “You can leave after one or stay for 
the whole series.”

Saorsa Art Gallery 

Paterson spends hours in this commercial gallery, browsing and talking to its 
owner, Tommy Fitchet. “He’s a brilliant artist who does abstract landscape 
paintings on glass, and he stocks really unusual artists in ceramics and 
sculpture, whose work is totally unlike his own. It’s a very eclectic mix.”
