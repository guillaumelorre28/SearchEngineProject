Today in Campaign 2016

 * Donald Trump scrambled to dig himself out from an avalanche of fresh abuse 
allegations today, after a series of women came forward to dispute his claim 
that his comments about sexual assault were only empty boasts. “There is 
nothing the political establishment will not do, no lie they won’t tell to hold 
their prestige and power at your expense and that’s what’s happening,”he told a 
rally in Florida 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/donald-trump-sexual-assault-hillary-clinton-new-york-times>
. “The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election.” After 
a series of initial denials in capital letters on Twitter and more than an hour 
after his speech was due to start, Trump launched into an hour-long attack on 
the media and female accusers he called “horrible, horrible liars”. “Take a 
look. Look at her. Look at her words. And you tell me what you think. I don’t 
think so,” Trump said of Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine reporterwho 
alleged he had “forced his tongue down my throat”

Trump denies ‘vicious’ sexual misconduct allegations

 * First lady Michelle Obama delivered a devastating rebuke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/michelle-obama-donald-trump-misconduct-frightening>
 to Trump, calling past comments andalleged misconduct by the Republican nominee
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-women-new-sexual-harassment-stories>
 “cruel”, “frightening” and beyond the “basic standards of human decency.”

This is not normal, this is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful, it is 
intolerable, and it doesn’t matter what party you belong to... No woman 
deserves to be treated this way – none of us deserves this kind of abuse.
Michelle Obama’s powerful rebuke to Trump’s ‘predatory behavior’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/13/michelle-obama-speech-donald-trump-sexual-assault-video>
 * To get to the facts of the matter, here is a timeline 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations>
 of the allegations by more than a dozen women, many of which have only been 
made public in recent days. 
 * New Jersey governor Chris Christie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chris-christie> is facing an official 
misconduct complaint stemming from the closure of lanes leading to the George 
Washington Bridge in 2013. A judge signed the summons today, sending the case 
to the Bergen County prosecutor’s office, which will decide whether the case 
will lead to an indictment. The Republican governor appointed the prosecutor. 
 * Hillary Clinton hinted at a possible landslide in the 8 November election, 
exhorting several thousand supporters at a San Francisco fundraiser today to 
help her “have the kind of victory we need” to serve as a “rebuke” to Donald 
Trump. On a day when Trump went on the attack – calling women who haveaccused 
him 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-women-new-sexual-harassment-stories>
 of inappropriate touching and kissing “horrible, horrible liars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/donald-trump-sexual-assault-hillary-clinton-new-york-times>
” – an increasingly confident Clinton encouraged her backers to double down on 
their efforts during the final weeks of the fractious 2016 campaign. 
 * “Everything we care about is at risk,” she said. “If you can help me to 
have the kind of victory we need, that stands as a rebuke of all the bigotry 
and bullying we’ve seen, then together, together we will build the future that 
all of us, particularly the children of our country, deserve to have.”

Speaking to a Linda Ross, a friend of Jessica Leeds, a woman who has accused 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> of physically 
assaulting her onboard an airline flight in 1979, CNN’s Don Lemon revealed 
tonight the moment when Leeds decided to come forward with her allegations.

“We were sitting together on her couch, and I looked right at her and I said, 
‘Oh, my God, Jessica, he just flat out lied right to our faces,’” Ross said, 
regarding the moment in the second presidential debate in which Trump pledged 
that he had never sexually assaulted a woman.

“I mean, that’s how personal it felt,” Ross continued. “He just flat out lied 
to our faces, and we were both shaking. We were so angry... She said, ‘I’ll 
think about it,’ and I went home at the end of the debate. I live two floors 
below her and the next morning, I got an e-mail from her telling me that she 
had sent a letter or an e-mail to the New York Times on Monday.”

Poll: Donald Trump's lead in Texas falls to margin of error

A new poll in the Lone Star State has Republican presidential nominee Donald 
Trump’s lead over Democratic rivalHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> slipping to a mere four 
percentage points, within the margin of error in a state that hasn’t voted for 
a Democratic presidential nominee in four decades.

The WFAA-TV and Texas TEGNA television stations poll 
<http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/texas-news/new-poll-trump-lead-shrinks-in-texas-within-margin-of-error/335896258>
 shows Trump holding a four-point lead over Clinton, 47% to Clinton’s 43% in a 
survey with a four-point margin of error.

“I think to put these numbers in context - it shows that Trump’s position has 
eroded a little bit,” political science professor Matthew Wilson told WFAA. 
“His lead is down to four percentage points according to this poll, but even in 
the wake of some really terrible news for him, he still leads in Texas, which 
shows what a tough nut Texas is to crack for Democratic candidates right now.”

Historically, Texas is one of the most blood-red states in the Union: Mitt 
Romney won Texas by 16% in 2012.

After a day of extraordinary statements – attacking women who have accused him 
of sexual assault, and invoking shocking antisemitic tropes –Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> exercised what might be seen 
as a rare degree of restraint.


Speaking to a Cincinnati arena filled with roughly 15,000 people tonight, he 
merely insulted the state’s Republican governor, mocked Hillary Clinton’s 
health and watched as his supporters treated the press with the same affection 
that lions in the Coliseum treated Christians.

In the first full day after Trump faced a barrage of accusations of groping 
and sexual misconduct from nearly a dozen women, the Republican nominee went on 
the offensive. In a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump insisted that he 
would never have sexually assaulted one woman who came forward – because she 
was unattractive.

“Take a look. Look at her. Look at her words. And you tell me what you think. 
I don’t think so,” Trump said of Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine reporter
who alleged <http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/> 
he had “forced his tongue down my throat”. The Republican nominee also attacked 
the New York Times – which reported the statements of two women who alleged 
Trump groped them.

He threatened to sue the paper and insisted he had eyewitnesses who could 
disprove the New York Times’ reporting. He described the women who alleged 
sexual assault against him as “horrible people, they’re horrible horrible 
liars”. Trump insisted that the press as a whole was “false and slanderous in 
every respect” and said “the depths of their immorality is absolutely 
unlimited”.

The allegations came less than a week after a leaked tape was revealed 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans>
 of Trump bragging about groping women and insisting: “When you are a star they 
let you do anything.”

At the same rally Trump also warned darkly about Clinton meeting “in secret 
with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to 
enrich these global financial powers”.

Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti Defamation League, promptly 
denounced the statement, which harkened back to antisemitic tropes like the
Protocols of the Elders of Zion

Tony Abbott defends Trump’s policies as ‘reasonable enough’ and ‘classic 
conservatism’

Helen Davidson

Tony Abbott <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tony-abbott> has 
described some of Donald Trump’s policies as “classic conservatism” while 
calling others “over the top” after garnering criticism for seemingly giving 
support to the Republican presidential candidate.

The former Australian prime minister urged “Trump haters” not to get “too 
excited” over his comments after he told Paul Murray on Sky News that the vast 
majority of Trump supporters were notdeplorables 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables>
.

“[They are] decent people who want to see change inside their country and 
that’s fair enough,” he said on Thursday night.

“Many of the Trump positions are reasonable enough, and there will be tens if 
not hundreds of millions of Americans who will continue to support some of 
those positions.”


Since tapes surfaced of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, which 
he later denied,several alleged victims have come forward 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/donald-trump-sexual-assault-hillary-clinton-new-york-times>
. The accusations includeclaims from beauty pageant contestants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal>
 that Trump burst into their dressing rooms while they were naked.

Taking to Twitter on Friday morning, Abbott sought to head off the inevitable 
reaction to his comments, but instead prompted further rebuke.

“Before the Trump haters get too excited, some of his views are OTT but 
cutting tax and boosting defence are classic conservatism,” he wrote.

Idaho Statesman endorses Hillary Clinton

A famously right-leaning Idaho newspaper has endorsed Democratic presidential 
nomineeHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, 
acknowledging that while there was “low to medium enthusiasm for Clinton” on 
the paper’s editorial board, none of its members could bring themselves to 
endorse Donald Trump.

Citing issues relevant to Idaho voters ranging from education, immigration and 
rural issues to gun control and health care,the Idaho Statesman 
<http://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/editorials/article108108882.html>, the 
state’s most widely circulated newspaper, criticized Trump as insufficiently 
reliable on conservative issues, or unreliable, period.

On health care, for example, “We are confused by Trump’s approach - one day he 
is going to repeal it, the next he proposes single-payer alternative - but we 
believe Clinton will work to make the improvements that are absolutely needed.”

On more lofty qualifications like communication style and positivity, the 
Statesman’s editorial board compared Trump to a “spoiled child.”

“We live in the real world, with real problems that need real solutions,” the 
board concludes. “We need someone with pragmatic approaches that include 
patience and compassion. We need Hillary Clinton to be the next president.”

Sean Hannity, in his interview with three women who have accused former 
president Bill Clinton of sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape, inferred 
from their anecdotes on his show that they might fear for their lives ifHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> were to be 
elected president.

“There’s been so many things happen to so many people connected to the 
Clintons,” Paula Jones said. “She’s gonna rule the world.”

Fox News personality Sean Hannity, who has functioned as an arm of the Trump 
campaign’s communications strategy since the Republican primaries, held a 
special on his show tonight in which he interviewed a trio of women who have 
accused former president Bill Clinton, husband of Democratic presidential 
nomineeHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, 
of sexual impropriety.

Donald Trump was originally scheduled to appear on the show, but pulled out of 
the appearance after more than a dozen accusations of sexual harassment, 
assault and inappropriate behavior were reported in various media outlets,
including the Guardian US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal>
, surfaced on Wednesday night.

The women - Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey - have long 
alleged that Bill Clinton committed acts of sexual impropriety toward them, 
ranging from sexual harassment to sexual assault to rape, and have made a 
similar appearance on Hannity’s eponymous show in the past.

“Back in 1978, when I was working for BC’s campaign for governor, I was raped 
by Bill Clinton. I was viciously raped,” Broaddrick told Hannity. “And three 
weeks later, at a fundraiser for him... Hillary personally threatened me.”

Clinton has long denied Broaddrick’s claims, and Broaddrick herself submitted 
an affidavit in 1997 denying that Clinton had made “any sexual advances” 
towards her.

Regarding the alleged threat, Broaddrick said that at a fundraiser for her 
husband’s gubernatorial campaign, Hillary Clinton “comes straight to me and 
says to me, big smile, very pleasant voice, says to me, ‘I’m Hillary, it’s so 
nice to meet you. I just want to thank you for everything you do for Bill’s 
campaign.’”

Clinton then allegedly grabbed her arm and pulled her closer, saying in “a 
very angry voice, a very low voice, and she pulls me close to her and she says, 
‘Do you understand everything you do?’”

“I don’t know what she’s capable of.”

Jones, a former Arkansas state employee whose lawsuit over allegations of 
sexual harassment eventually lead to Bill Clinton’s impeachment by the House of 
Representatives, told Hannity that after she was invited to his room at an 
Arkansas hotel, Clinton propositioned her and exposed himself to her.

“And I said, ‘I’m not that kind of girl, and I need to walk by to my desk,’” 
Jones said. Clinton then allegedly told her: “You’re a smart girl - let’s keep 
this between us.’”

Clinton settled Jones’ lawsuit out of court for $850,000 without admission of 
guilt.

Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer aide, has alleged since 1998 
that Bill Clinton had sexually assaulted her in the Oval Office in 1993.

“I headed back out the hall to go back to the door that led into the Oval 
Office, and he took my coffee cup from me and put it on a desk or table, and 
next thing I knew, he had me backed into a corner,” Willey told Hannity. “My 
mind was racing, and I thought, ‘should I slap him, or kick him, or knee him?’”

Willey then says that when Clinton was distracted, she then fled the Oval 
Office.

Report: Donald Trump called deaf Celebrity Apprentice 'retarded,' according to 
staffers

Citing three staffers from the hit reality show The Apprentice that turned 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump into a star,The Daily Beast reports
 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/13/donald-trump-called-deaf-apprentice-marlee-matlin-retarded.html?via=desktop&source=twitter>
 that Trump “had a habit of insulting, mimicking, and demeaning” Oscar-winning 
actress Marlee Matlin, who is deaf.

“[Trump] would often equate that she was mentally retarded,” one staffer, who 
like the others was bound by an ironclad nondisclosure agreement, told The 
Daily Beast.

“[Trump] would make fun of her voice. It actually sounded a lot like what he 
did [to] the New York Times guy,” another staffer told The Daily Beast, in 
reference to an incident in which Trumpmocked a disabled reporter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/26/donald-trump-appears-to-mock-disabled-reporter-video>
 during a rally. “Like, to make it seem like she was mentally not there? [It] 
sounded like he got a real kick out of it. It was really upsetting.”

“In the boardroom, he would talk to her like she was ‘special,’” another 
source said. “He took her deafness as a some kind of [mental] handicap.”

Matlin eventually placed second in the 2011 season of Celebrity Apprentice.

Indian governor and Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence was asked 
about self-image by a journalist quoting an 11-year-old girl, who said that 
when she heard words used by Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, “they make me feel bad about 
myself.”

Pence’s response:

Well, I would say to any one of my kids and any children in this country that 
Donald trump and I are committed to a safer and more prosperous future for 
their family. The weak and feckless foreign policy thatHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> promises to continue has 
literally caused wider areas of the world to spin apart. The rise of terrorist 
threats that have inspired violence here at home, and we’ve seen an erosion of 
law and order in our streets. And we’ve seen opportunities and jobs evaporate 
and even leave Ohio and leave this country. I would say to any of our kids that 
if Donald Trump and I have the chance to serve in the White House that we’re 
going to work every day for a stronger, safer and more prosperous America.

So, in response to a young woman’s questions about Trump’s attitudes toward 
women, Pence responded with foreign policy, law and order, and lost 
manufacturing jobs.

What’re your thoughts?

 * Donald Trump scrambled to dig himself out from an avalanche of fresh abuse 
allegations today, after a series of women came forward to dispute his claim 
that his comments about sexual assault were only empty boasts. “There is 
nothing the political establishment will not do, no lie they won’t tell to hold 
their prestige and power at your expense and that’s what’s happening,”he told a 
rally in Florida 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/donald-trump-sexual-assault-hillary-clinton-new-york-times>
. “The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election.” After 
a series of initial denials in capital letters on Twitter and more than an hour 
after his speech was due to start, Trump launched into an hour-long attack on 
the media and female accusers he called “horrible, horrible liars”. “Take a 
look. Look at her. Look at her words. And you tell me what you think. I don’t 
think so,” Trump said of Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine reporterwho 
alleged he had “forced his tongue down my throat” 
<http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/>.

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-women-new-sexual-harassment-stories>
 “cruel”, “frightening” and beyond the “basic standards of human decency.”

This is not normal, this is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful, it is 
intolerable, and it doesn’t matter what party you belong to... No woman 
deserves to be treated this way – none of us deserves this kind of abuse.

 * To get to the facts of the matter, here is a timeline 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations>
 of the allegations by more than a dozen women, many of which have only been 
made public in recent days. 
 * New Jersey governor Chris Christie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chris-christie> is facing an official 
misconduct complaint stemming from the closure of lanes leading to the George 
Washington Bridge in 2013. A judge signed the summons today, sending the case 
to the Bergen County prosecutor’s office, which will decide whether the case 
will lead to an indictment. The Republican governor appointed the prosecutor. 
 * Hillary Clinton hinted at a possible landslide in the 8 November election, 
exhorting several thousand supporters at a San Francisco fundraiser today to 
help her “have the kind of victory we need” to serve as a “rebuke” to Donald 
Trump. On a day when Trump went on the attack – calling women who haveaccused 
him 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-women-new-sexual-harassment-stories>
 of inappropriate touching and kissing “horrible, horrible liars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/donald-trump-sexual-assault-hillary-clinton-new-york-times>
” – an increasingly confident Clinton encouraged her backers to double down on 
their efforts during the final weeks of the fractious 2016 campaign. 
 * “Everything we care about is at risk,” she said. “If you can help me to 
have the kind of victory we need, that stands as a rebuke of all the bigotry 
and bullying we’ve seen, then together, together we will build the future that 
all of us, particularly the children of our country, deserve to have.”
 
Speaking to a Linda Ross, a friend of Jessica Leeds, a woman who has accused 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> of physically 
assaulting her onboard an airline flight in 1979, CNN’s Don Lemon revealed 
tonight the moment when Leeds decided to come forward with her allegations.

“We were sitting together on her couch, and I looked right at her and I said, 
‘Oh, my God, Jessica, he just flat out lied right to our faces,’” Ross said, 
regarding the moment in the second presidential debate in which Trump pledged 
that he had never sexually assaulted a woman.

“I mean, that’s how personal it felt,” Ross continued. “He just flat out lied 
to our faces, and we were both shaking. We were so angry... She said, ‘I’ll 
think about it,’ and I went home at the end of the debate. I live two floors 
below her and the next morning, I got an e-mail from her telling me that she 
had sent a letter or an e-mail to the New York Times on Monday.”

A new poll in the Lone Star State has Republican presidential nominee Donald 
Trump’s lead over Democratic rivalHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> slipping to a mere four 
percentage points, within the margin of error in a state that hasn’t voted for 
a Democratic presidential nominee in four decades.

The WFAA-TV and Texas TEGNA television stations poll 
<http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/texas-news/new-poll-trump-lead-shrinks-in-texas-within-margin-of-error/335896258>
 shows Trump holding a four-point lead over Clinton, 47% to Clinton’s 43% in a 
survey with a four-point margin of error.

“I think to put these numbers in context - it shows that Trump’s position has 
eroded a little bit,” political science professor Matthew Wilson told WFAA. 
“His lead is down to four percentage points according to this poll, but even in 
the wake of some really terrible news for him, he still leads in Texas, which 
shows what a tough nut Texas is to crack for Democratic candidates right now.”

Historically, Texas is one of the most blood-red states in the Union: Mitt 
Romney won Texas by 16% in 2012.
 
After a day of extraordinary statements – attacking women who have accused him 
of sexual assault, and invoking shocking antisemitic tropes –Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> exercised what might be seen 
as a rare degree of restraint.


Speaking to a Cincinnati arena filled with roughly 15,000 people tonight, he 
merely insulted the state’s Republican governor, mocked Hillary Clinton’s 
health and watched as his supporters treated the press with the same affection 
that lions in the Coliseum treated Christians.

In the first full day after Trump faced a barrage of accusations of groping 
and sexual misconduct from nearly a dozen women, the Republican nominee went on 
the offensive. In a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump insisted that he 
would never have sexually assaulted one woman who came forward – because she 
was unattractive.

“Take a look. Look at her. Look at her words. And you tell me what you think. 
I don’t think so,” Trump said of Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine reporter
who alleged <http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/> 
he had “forced his tongue down my throat”. The Republican nominee also attacked 
the New York Times – which reported the statements of two women who alleged 
Trump groped them.

He threatened to sue the paper and insisted he had eyewitnesses who could 
disprove the New York Times’ reporting. He described the women who alleged 
sexual assault against him as “horrible people, they’re horrible horrible 
liars”. Trump insisted that the press as a whole was “false and slanderous in 
every respect” and said “the depths of their immorality is absolutely 
unlimited”.

The allegations came less than a week after a leaked tape was revealed 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans>
 of Trump bragging about groping women and insisting: “When you are a star they 
let you do anything.”

At the same rally Trump also warned darkly about Clinton meeting “in secret 
with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to 
enrich these global financial powers”.

Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti Defamation League, promptly 
denounced the statement, which harkened back to antisemitic tropes like the
Protocols of the Elders of Zion

Tony Abbott <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tony-abbott> has 
described some of Donald Trump’s policies as “classic conservatism” while 
calling others “over the top” after garnering criticism for seemingly giving 
support to the Republican presidential candidate.

The former Australian prime minister urged “Trump haters” not to get “too 
excited” over his comments after he told Paul Murray on Sky News that the vast 
majority of Trump supporters were notdeplorables 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables>
.

“[They are] decent people who want to see change inside their country and 
that’s fair enough,” he said on Thursday night.

“Many of the Trump positions are reasonable enough, and there will be tens if 
not hundreds of millions of Americans who will continue to support some of 
those positions.”


Since tapes surfaced of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, which 
he later denied,several alleged victims have come forward 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/donald-trump-sexual-assault-hillary-clinton-new-york-times>
. The accusations includeclaims from beauty pageant contestants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal>
 that Trump burst into their dressing rooms while they were naked.

Taking to Twitter on Friday morning, Abbott sought to head off the inevitable 
reaction to his comments, but instead prompted further rebuke.

“Before the Trump haters get too excited, some of his views are OTT but 
cutting tax and boosting defence are classic conservatism,” he wrote.

A famously right-leaning Idaho newspaper has endorsed Democratic presidential 
nomineeHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, 
acknowledging that while there was “low to medium enthusiasm for Clinton” on 
the paper’s editorial board, none of its members could bring themselves to 
endorse Donald Trump.

Citing issues relevant to Idaho voters ranging from education, immigration and 
rural issues to gun control and health care,the Idaho Statesman 
<http://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/editorials/article108108882.html>, the 
state’s most widely circulated newspaper, criticized Trump as insufficiently 
reliable on conservative issues, or unreliable, period.

On health care, for example, “We are confused by Trump’s approach - one day he 
is going to repeal it, the next he proposes single-payer alternative - but we 
believe Clinton will work to make the improvements that are absolutely needed.”

On more lofty qualifications like communication style and positivity, the 
Statesman’s editorial board compared Trump to a “spoiled child.”

“We live in the real world, with real problems that need real solutions,” the 
board concludes. “We need someone with pragmatic approaches that include 
patience and compassion. We need Hillary Clinton to be the next president.”
 
Sean Hannity, in his interview with three women who have accused former 
president Bill Clinton of sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape, inferred 
from their anecdotes on his show that they might fear for their lives ifHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> were to be 
elected president.

“There’s been so many things happen to so many people connected to the 
Clintons,” Paula Jones said. “She’s gonna rule the world.”
 
Fox News personality Sean Hannity, who has functioned as an arm of the Trump 
campaign’s communications strategy since the Republican primaries, held a 
special on his show tonight in which he interviewed a trio of women who have 
accused former president Bill Clinton, husband of Democratic presidential 
nomineeHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, 
of sexual impropriety.

Donald Trump was originally scheduled to appear on the show, but pulled out of 
the appearance after more than a dozen accusations of sexual harassment, 
assault and inappropriate behavior were reported in various media outlets,
including the Guardian US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-dressing-room-2001-rehearsal>
, surfaced on Wednesday night.

The women - Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey - have long 
alleged that Bill Clinton committed acts of sexual impropriety toward them, 
ranging from sexual harassment to sexual assault to rape, and have made a 
similar appearance on Hannity’s eponymous show in the past.

“Back in 1978, when I was working for BC’s campaign for governor, I was raped 
by Bill Clinton. I was viciously raped,” Broaddrick told Hannity. “And three 
weeks later, at a fundraiser for him... Hillary personally threatened me.”

Clinton has long denied Broaddrick’s claims, and Broaddrick herself submitted 
an affidavit in 1997 denying that Clinton had made “any sexual advances” 
towards her.

Regarding the alleged threat, Broaddrick said that at a fundraiser for her 
husband’s gubernatorial campaign, Hillary Clinton “comes straight to me and 
says to me, big smile, very pleasant voice, says to me, ‘I’m Hillary, it’s so 
nice to meet you. I just want to thank you for everything you do for Bill’s 
campaign.’”

Clinton then allegedly grabbed her arm and pulled her closer, saying in “a 
very angry voice, a very low voice, and she pulls me close to her and she says, 
‘Do you understand everything you do?’”

“I don’t know what she’s capable of.”

Jones, a former Arkansas state employee whose lawsuit over allegations of 
sexual harassment eventually lead to Bill Clinton’s impeachment by the House of 
Representatives, told Hannity that after she was invited to his room at an 
Arkansas hotel, Clinton propositioned her and exposed himself to her.

“And I said, ‘I’m not that kind of girl, and I need to walk by to my desk,’” 
Jones said. Clinton then allegedly told her: “You’re a smart girl - let’s keep 
this between us.’”

Clinton settled Jones’ lawsuit out of court for $850,000 without admission of 
guilt.

Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer aide, has alleged since 1998 
that Bill Clinton had sexually assaulted her in the Oval Office in 1993.

“I headed back out the hall to go back to the door that led into the Oval 
Office, and he took my coffee cup from me and put it on a desk or table, and 
next thing I knew, he had me backed into a corner,” Willey told Hannity. “My 
mind was racing, and I thought, ‘should I slap him, or kick him, or knee him?’”

Willey then says that when Clinton was distracted, she then fled the Oval 
Office.
 
Citing three staffers from the hit reality show The Apprentice that turned 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump into a star,The Daily Beast reports
 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/13/donald-trump-called-deaf-apprentice-marlee-matlin-retarded.html?via=desktop&source=twitter>
 that Trump “had a habit of insulting, mimicking, and demeaning” Oscar-winning 
actress Marlee Matlin, who is deaf.

“[Trump] would often equate that she was mentally retarded,” one staffer, who 
like the others was bound by an ironclad nondisclosure agreement, told The 
Daily Beast.

“[Trump] would make fun of her voice. It actually sounded a lot like what he 
did [to] the New York Times guy,” another staffer told The Daily Beast, in 
reference to an incident in which Trumpmocked a disabled reporter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/26/donald-trump-appears-to-mock-disabled-reporter-video>
 during a rally. “Like, to make it seem like she was mentally not there? [It] 
sounded like he got a real kick out of it. It was really upsetting.”

“In the boardroom, he would talk to her like she was ‘special,’” another 
source said. “He took her deafness as a some kind of [mental] handicap.”

Matlin eventually placed second in the 2011 season of Celebrity Apprentice.
 
Indian governor and Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence was asked 
about self-image by a journalist quoting an 11-year-old girl, who said that 
when she heard words used by Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, “they make me feel bad about 
myself.”

Pence’s response:

Well, I would say to any one of my kids and any children in this country that 
Donald trump and I are committed to a safer and more prosperous future for 
their family. The weak and feckless foreign policy thatHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> promises to continue has 
literally caused wider areas of the world to spin apart. The rise of terrorist 
threats that have inspired violence here at home, and we’ve seen an erosion of 
law and order in our streets. And we’ve seen opportunities and jobs evaporate 
and even leave Ohio and leave this country. I would say to any of our kids that 
if Donald Trump and I have the chance to serve in the White House that we’re 
going to work every day for a stronger, safer and more prosperous America.

So, in response to a young woman’s questions about Trump’s attitudes toward 
women, Pence responded with foreign policy, law and order, and lost 
manufacturing jobs.
