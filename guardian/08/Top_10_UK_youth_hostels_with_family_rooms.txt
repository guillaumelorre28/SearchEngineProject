Safestay Holland Park, London

Safestay has a reputation for opening stylish affordable hostels inside 
interesting buildings, but this new one really raises the bar. Within easy 
reach of attractions such as the Natural History Museum and Portobello Market, 
this is a Jacobean mansion dating back to 1605 and has courtyard garden, stone 
mullions, leaded lights and a squat 1950s annexe – OK, you can’t have 
everything. But Safestay has even turned this to its advantage: the somewhat 
unattractive addition is a modernistic home to a lounge, cafe and pool room 
with views of the Grade I-listed main building. This follows the usual pattern: 
dorms have bunkbeds with lockers, curtains and reading lights – all very neat 
and efficient – if there are three of you, take a triple-decker. For the price 
in this location, it is exceptional.
• Dorm bed from £15, four-bed private room from £80, safestay.com

YHA Boggle Hole, Fylingthorpe, Whitby, North Yorkshire: hostel review
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/29/yha-boggle-hole-fylingthorpe-whitby-yorkshire-hostel-review>
The long lane that leads to this hostel drops into an ever-narrower wooded 
valley. Waves can be heard smashing on rocks, maybe the cries of peregrine 
falcons swooping overhead, then the old mill appears, a lovely honey stone 
building far too large for this narrow gorge.Boggle Hole youth hostel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/29/yha-boggle-hole-fylingthorpe-whitby-yorkshire-hostel-review>
 is unusual for its position: at low tide you can fossick for miles along the 
shore – keeping an eye on the tide – as far as the seal colony at Ravenscar to 
the south, or to Robin Hood’s Bay to the north (for Whitby the cliff path is 
safer). The recently refurbished hostel mixes original features such as old 
timbers and brickwork with nautical memorabilia to create a fun look. There’s a 
cosy cafe bar with log-burner and plenty of board games and books.

• Dorm bed from £20, four-bed family room from £79,

After a hike over the central massif of the Lake District there are worse 
places to land than this 200-year-old pile in a prime spot on the shores of 
Wastwater. There’s no Wi-Fi, television or mobile phone coverage, so unexpected 
social encounters are pretty much guaranteed – perhaps in the lounge, with its 
log fire and leather chesterfields. There is also a bar, dining room, 
well-equipped games room and a variety of rooms sleeping four or more. Outside 
there is the lake, of course, plus attractions like Ravenglass and Eskdale 
Railway orGrizedale Forest with its Go Ape  
<http://goape.co.uk/days-out/grizedale>tree-top adventure park. Challenge the 
children to climb Scafell Pike, England’s highest mountain, and try to see 
Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man in one magnificent panorama.

With its cafe-bistro, art gallery, live music and comedy nights, this is a hip 
hostel in a handy location – Northumberland’s border town is less than four 
hours by train from London and handy for sandy beaches, fishing villages and 
castles. Take the Arriva bus 418 to visit Bamburgh castle or kipper-scented 
Craster, or jump on a bike to explore the many coast and countryside routes 
that start from the town. Some en suite family rooms have double beds.

A glamorous take on the budget break, this three-storey hostel in a Regency 
building in central Brighton was once a four-star hotel – so the smart 
bathrooms, bold decor and licensed cafe-bar far exceed what you’d expect at 
this price. A couple of family rooms have double beds, others have bunks and 
all are en suite. The amusements of Brighton pier and eclectic shopping in The 
Lanes are minutes’ walk away, and the South Downs national park is on the 
doorstep.

 A ‘snoozebox’ at YHA Eden Project 
Sleeping in a recycled shipping container may not be everyone’s idea of bliss, 
but these compact heated “snoozeboxes” (with en suite bathroom, aircon and 
television) are cosy, eco-friendly and a short walk from the biome-enclosed 
rainforests of the Eden Project. The reception marquee has a licensed cafe, but 
self-catering facilities are limited to microwaves – though the Eden Kitchen is 
open lunchtime and some evenings. Book tickets for the Eden Project when you 
book your room for discounted unlimited entry.

This 17th-century manor is family-friendly outside as well as in, with wooden 
play equipment, spacious grounds and pet goats. Inside, there’s wood panelling, 
stone floors and cosy wood-burners in the restaurant, bar and library. There’s 
a games room, drying room and excellent facilities for cyclists: with the 
Tissington, Manifold and High Peak trails on the doorstep, this is one of the 
best places in Britain for off-road biking. Chatsworth House and Alton Towers 
aren’t far away.

Arran is known as “Scotland in miniature” for its accessible hills, beaches, 
woodlands and wildlife – all less than two hours from Glasgow. The hostel lies 
at its wilder northern end on the banks of Loch Ranza, overlooking a ruined 
13th-century castle. Walk the Arran Coastal Way or take the Lochranza ferry to 
Kintyre (and walk toSkipness Seafood Cabin <http://skipnessseafoodcabin.co.uk/> 
for lunch). Look out for otters in the bay, red deer in the hills and golden 
eagles in the sky. Unlike English and Welsh YHAs, this simply furnished hostel 
accepts dogs.

You won’t believe the view from this hillside hostel near the northern end of 
the Pembrokeshire Coast Path. It overlooks Blue Flag Poppit Sands, a 
lifeguarded dune-backed beach on the Teifi estuary. Set in five acres of 
grounds, the hostel is reached via 50 steep steps from the car park. It’s 
self-catering only, but there are plenty of cafes in nearby Cardigan (including 
a “pizza tipi <http://www.pizzatipi.co.uk/>” on the quay in summer), where you 
can also join a boat trip to spot dolphins and porpoises in the bay.

A former Victorian hotel frequented by climbers (George Mallory stayed here 
while training for his doomed 1924 Everest attempt) has been transformed by a 
£1.3m refurbishment into a bright and modern hub. You don’t have to be a 
serious walker to enjoy the scenery: even young hikers can manage the lower 
part of the Miners’ Track up Snowdon, which starts outside the door. You’ll 
need six hours to do the summit (seeeryri-npa.gov.uk 
<http://www.eryri-npa.gov.uk/visiting/walking/mountain-walks>), but the less 
active can catch theSnowdon Sherpa
