I’m Alec Saelens and, like many Bristol residents, I’m not originally from 
here, but I’ve grown to call this city in south-west England – named the 
European Green Capital for 2015 – home. I’m part of the Bristol Cable, a new 
citizen media co-operative that investigates uncovered issues and initiatives 
in the city while giving a voice to local people. The production and 
distribution of theBristol <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bristol> Cable’s 
first edition has provided me with an exciting discovery of many aspects of 
this city. My day job as a waiter, the one that pays the rent, isn’t nearly as 
stimulating, but it helps me to get by.

 The Bristol skyline from the mound. Photograph: Alec Saelens 
It’s 3pm and I’m on my regular route to work. Cycling always gives me a new 
insight into the character of different neighbourhoods. I leave my area of 
Easton, an area populated by a mix of people: families who have lived here for 
generations, others from recent waves of immigration, newly arrived young 
graduates seeking cheap rents. At a crossroad that beautifully reflects the 
area, I pass a Sikh gurdwara, a community centre, a mosque, supported housing 
for single mums, and a pub.


Away from Stapleton Road, a local high street lined with delicious Somali 
cafes, I enter the predominantly Afro-Caribbean area of St Pauls. The thriving 
Malcolm X community centre stands aside tall houses that belonged to merchants 
at the height of the slave trade. Up the road I reach the artistic and 
alternative scene of Stokes Croft, with its cafes, squats and art studios. The 
area is definitely struggling to maintain its identity as a hotbed of 
political, cultural and artistic radicalism as corporate redevelopers try to 
move in.


Next, I pass quickly through Broadmead, with its sprawling shopping and 
entertainment venues, and eventually reach the redeveloped Harbourside in the 
city centre – no longer a commercial dockside, but a great place for an evening 
stroll and drink of cider.

 Trinity community and arts centre. Photograph: Alec Saelens 
The Trinity Centre stands out. Housed in a converted church given to the 
community by the Church of England, one can always expect to find a range of 
high quality arts, culture and community events here. From local radical 
histories to all-night dub raves, international acts, markets, anarchist 
bookfairs and over-50s lunches, the Trinity represents a lot of what’s good 
about Bristol: a mix of hedonism and people, with a good dose of grounded 
discussion and action. Along with Trinity, there are many other churches in 
Bristol that now serve purposes other than worship, including Circomedia Circus 
School and St Werburghs Climbing Centre.

 Fitting architectural legacy? ... Colston Tower. Photograph: Alec Saelens 
I nominate Colston Tower, which looms over the centre. Why this particular 
1960s high-rise among all the others? It’s in the name as much as in the 
aesthetic. The block is named after Edward Colston, the Bristol-born merchant 
and MP who acquired his wealth through the trade and exploitation of slaves. 
Perhaps this ugly office block, with the words Colston Tower in massive neon 
letters, is a fitting architectural legacy for a man whose pockets were lined 
by the slave trade.


How clean is the city?

Depends where you are, and at what time! Bristol is generally clean, but if 
you venture out early or are still up in Stokes Croft on a Sunday morning you 
might have to wade through beer cans and cider bottles alongside the Sunday 
churchgoers. A very bizarre scene, no doubt.

 Tagger’s paradise ... Bristol grafitti. Photograph: Alec Saelens 
Made famous by Banksy but certainly not started by him, Bristol’s graffiti 
covers the city head to toe, most of it brilliant street art. If you’re in 
Bristol and you don’t see the tag CNTS everywhere, you haven’t got out enough!


What’s the best way to get around? 

Cycling or walking are far preferable in this medium-sized city. It’s easier 
to weave the fastest and picturesque way through intimate backstreets or 
pedestrian paths. Keen to cultivate its green reputation, Bristol is making 
progress on developing biking infrastructure, though a lot of work remains. I 
don’t envy those waiting for the bus. And as the biggest city in the 
south-west, Bristol attracts a lot of car commuters from surrounding counties. 
Seeing the traffic jams in the morning, you’re constantly reminded that 
automobiles aren’t the most efficient way to get around and that Bristol is one 
of the most highly traffic congested cities in England.


What does your city sound like? 

The melodies of tunnel buskers revisiting Jacque Brel on a gypsy groove, or 
Moussa the kora player serenading the Harbourside. Bristol breeds its own very 
best musicians and promotes them well; the quality is always high, and entrance 
is usually cheap. Venues have weekly nights promoting a wide range of music; 
notorious for pioneering dub culture, there are free parties around if you’re 
prepared to dig.

 Infamous banter ... Tovey’s fishmonger. Photograph: Alec Saelens 
I’m not going to give away my favourite pub, but I will tell you about Tovey’s 
fishmonger, the best fish store in town. With the smell of fresh Cornish fish 
floating down the Stapleton road, it’s not exactly a place you might expect to 
stick about for a conversation – but this gem attracts all sorts, from students 
to your gran to the neighbour you’ve never spoken to. You’re sure to leave with 
good stories as well as produce. It’s set like a stage, with one of the family 
fishmongers standing in the middle of the floor and flanked by fresh fish on 
all sides. Customers are treated to a show of filleting accompanied by talks 
about the latest news, family history, gossip and the best recipes. I’ve lost 
count of the number of times I’ve ended up chatting to people in the queue 
about local happenings for way longer than you should spend in a 
potent-smelling fish shop. Disclaimer: make sure you’re quick on the mark, 
because these gents are infamous for their quips and banter.


What one thing is indispensable for life in your city?

I’m obviously going to say pick up a copy of the Bristol Cable. But for the 
latest on scandals and abuses of power, get the controversial satirical sheet 
the Bristolian. And for intriguing local histories, check out publications and 
events by the Bristol Radical History Group, a lot of which is hosted at Hydra 
Books shop.


Are you optimistic about your city’s future?

 Divided metropolis ... Bristol as seen from the city centre. Photograph: Alec 
Saelens 
Bristol is making a lot of noise on the international stage, and rightly so. 
It has been named European Green Capital for 2015, it has its own local 
currency (the Bristol pound) and an obsession with localism, from independent 
shops to a co-operatively owned ferry service. But I’m worried that many 
Bristolians will not rise with the tide of this much-heralded progress. It’s 
clear that this is a divided metropolis: one stark example is the seven-year 
disparity in life expectancy between different neighbourhoods. In what is an 
all-too-familiar story, rising rent and gentrification are shifting some 
populations further afield. All that said, there’s such great potential for 
Bristol: the challenge is to make sure that the gains are felt by all 
Bristolians.
