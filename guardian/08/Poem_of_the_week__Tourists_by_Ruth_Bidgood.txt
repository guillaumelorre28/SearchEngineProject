Tourists

Warner, setting out eagerly from Bath
at five on a lively morning
for the inspiring rigours of Wales
with obliging C----, equipped himself for adventure
with a rusty but respectable spencer
(good enough for North Wales, he said).
The travellers’ huge pockets bulged with clothes,
maps, and little comforts; their heads were full
of Ossian, whose horrendous glooms
they were gratified to recognise
one evening on the road to Rhaeadr
(though Ossian had not prepared them
for the state of the road, or the shortage
of bedchambers at the ‘Lion’).
Romantic tourists, no doubt, perpetual
outsiders, but willing to love,
and finding much “singular, striking
and indescribable”. They were comic
(embarrassed at being spotted,
with their pedlars’ pockets, by fashionable females),
but worked hard for their exaltations,
plodding twenty-five miles to Machynlleth
north over boggy mountains, or stumbling
two hours across rocks to find a guide
to Dôlbadarn ruins. They were uncomplaining
on Snowdon in a thick mist (they drank milk
gratefully, but longed for brandy), and did not grumble
when, at Aberglaslyn, salmon failed to leap
(only two would even try). Who can say
that at the end of August, leaving Chepstow
for flood-tide at the ferry, they were taking
nothing real away, or that their naive and scholarly wonder
had given nothing in return?

Tourists is a relatively early poem by the now nonagenarian Welsh writer Ruth 
Bidgood 
<http://www.literaturewales.org/writers-of-wales/i/129542/desc/bidgood-ruth/>. 
It was first published in Not Without Homage (1975) and reprinted inNew and 
Selected Poems <https://www.serenbooks.com/author/ruth-bidgood> (2004). Her 
latest collections are Time Being (2009), which won her the Roland Mathias 
prize, and Above the Forests (Cinnamon, 2012).


 Surrounded for much of her writing life by the trees and mountains of 
Abergwesyn <http://www.walesdirectory.co.uk/Towns/Abergwesyn.htm> in Powys, 
Bidgood has been commended by Matthew Jarvis for what he calls an “
anti-Arcadian refusal of pastoral 
<http://poems.com/special_features/prose/essay_jarvis.php>”. She certainly 
writes about her landscape with affection, but it’s the matter-of-fact, gently 
watchful affection of someone in their everyday environment. An accompanying 
fondness for people places her in sharp contrast to another Welsh 
anti-Arcadian, that solitary, romantic singer ofthe chilly pastoral, RS Thomas 
<http://www.spectator.co.uk/2013/04/extraordinary-man-of-the-bald-welsh-hills/>.

 Although the 18th-century Ossian 
<http://www.exclassics.com/ossian/ossintro.htm> fans whom Bidgood welcomes to 
Wales might seem a race apart from today’s jolly families and extreme sports 
enthusiasts, the judgment that there are no good tourists any more is not one 
that can be deduced from the poem: rather, the poem suggests that scorn for 
tourists might be a questionable prejudice. It’s significant, I think, that 
Bidgood categorises the earlier visitors as tourists: a word that, even by the 
1970s, had become derogatory.

 Bidgood’s discursive, non-metrical lines draw impressionistically on material 
in the letters of the Reverend Richard Warner, published in the late 1790s as A 
Walk Through Wales. Warner himself writes self-mockingly about the figure he 
and his friend C---- present as they set off. They have nobly decided to travel 
on foot so as to “catch beauties … which the encumbrance of a carriage or even 
the indulgence of a horse prevents other travellers from enjoying”, with the 
result that luggage has become a bit of an issue. Richard’s “rusty” oldspencer 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_(clothing)> has been specially adapted 
with a pocket that “sweeps from one side to the other” as he walks. C---- has 
had two side-pockets “of considerable dimensions” added to his coat. They are 
sanguine about their appearance until they meet two ladies, one a previous 
acquaintance: perhaps it’s fortunate that the ladies are equally embarrassed to 
have been caught travelling by cart.

 Warner must have been one of the pleasantest of clergymen – honest about his 
human weaknesses, genial, self-forgiving and forgiving of others. He is no mere 
romantic, despite the Ossian reading, but takes a rational interest in history 
and customs. He is fairly stoical in disappointment, but neither underplays the 
displeasures nor overpraises the delights. Bidgood’s narrative laughs with 
rather than at him, judging to a nicety the degree to which she can make fun of 
the happy hikers but leave their dignity intact.

 Her narrative sources are all in the letters. Although the poem is largely 
paraphrase, the only clear quotation being Warner’s somewhat baffled comment, 
“singular, striking and indescribable”, it reflects the Reverend’s style and 
diction. One can imagine his wry smile of assent when the poet remarks drily 
that the couple “worked hard for their exaltations …” The chronological order 
of events is slightly altered, as is the name of the pub where only one bedroom 
could be found: I’d guess that the poem was made from the memory of a loved and 
familiar text, rather than a studious re-reading. Yet, to a large extent, 
Tourists works in the manner of the “found” poem: it takes us as near as 
possible to Warner’s own voice, with only the lightest of ironical, distancing 
movements. The moral and contextual frame is provided by the final, gentle and 
generous, question: “Who can say / that at the end of August, leaving Chepstow 
/ for flood-tide at the ferry, they were taking / nothing real away, or that 
their naive and scholarly wonder / had given nothing in return?”

 As the letters report on a geographical journey, so the poem reports on a 
literary-historical one. Without the poem, I probably wouldn’t ever have known
