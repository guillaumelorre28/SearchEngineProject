The story that made me want to write Peaky Blinders came from my dad. When he 
was about eight he had to deliver a note to the Sheldons, the realPeaky Blinders
 <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/peaky-blinders>. He was terrified of 
them and had to run barefoot through the streets. When the door opened, smoke 
wafted out and there were nine men round a table, immaculately dressed – ties, 
shoes polished, hats, guns – and the table piled with money, but they were 
drinking beer out of jam jars, because they wouldn’t spend money on glasses or 
cups. The image of a little kid looking on made me want to write about that 
whole era.

My mum and dad grew up in Small Heath in Birmingham in the 1920s. Mum was a 
runner for illegal bookmakers when she was nine or 10; they often used 
children, who aroused less suspicion. She used to walk down the street with a 
washing basket and people would wrap their bet – sixpence or whatever – in a 
piece of paper with the horse’s name and their code name on it, and drop it in 
the basket when she walked past, because there would be policemen watching.

The history books are wrong! They say the Peakies had died out by the 1890s 
but they hadn’t. That local Birmingham gang was the Sheldons – which I changed 
to the Shelbys for the programme – and in the 1920s that family was still known 
as the Peaky Blinders.

The Peaky Blinders will always be in Brum, but in the new series the world 
comes to Birmingham. There was a pull towards moving west, to prohibition and 
gangsters and Al Capone, but I’ve gone east instead, and in this series they 
are in business with exiled Russian aristocrats conspiring against the 
Bolsheviks – a plot line that is based on real events in 1924.

 Peaky Blinders depicts a slice of Birmingham’s hidden history 
When my mum was growing up, all you could hear, 24 hours a day, was bang-bang, 
the thump of the steam hammers and the smell and the smoke – the air was green 
sometimes. I wanted to keep all that in the programme but also tell the story 
as it was told to me as a kid, so everything is bigger – the horses are 
massive, the Garrison, a real pub and it’s terrible, but in the memory it is a 
huge saloon. It’s imagining how Birmingham looked then – it was smokey, it was 
dark, it was noisy, a lot of flames. It was like hell.

Some of my family’s old stories were too horrific to put in the programme. 
There was a bloke who used to go around the pubs in Small Heath with a rat in a 
cage. He’d put his head in the cage and fight the rat with his mouth, and kill 
it and people would give him money. It was a hard, hard place.

 looks like the memories of my parents’ Birmingham, even though it’s not quite 
in Brum. We film quite a lot there, it’s our base for the series. There are 
lots of little back streets and original workshops which are still working, so 
it’s an amazing place to visit.

Manchester’s history is cotton and wool. Birmingham’s is iron and steel. 
Manchester makes a lot more noise, but we have a better story to tell. Iron and 
steel are more interesting – from them came factories, mass production, steam 
power … you name it, it started there. They invented the modern world, 
basically.

I’m working on a scheme to build a big film studio in Birmingham, called 
Mercian – from the Anglo-Saxon Midlands kingdom –, with the city council, where 
we can develop large-scale productions. I was up there yesterday having a 
meeting, and some people from Paramount came over. because there is a shortage 
of space in this country, and I want that to happen in Birmingham sooner rather 
than later.

 Soho House, the meeting place of the Lunar Society, or ‘Lunar Men’. 
Photograph: Alamy 
I’d love the story of the Lunar Men, the likes of James Watt, Matthew Boulton 
and Josiah Wedgwood, who met in Soho House in Handsworth every full moon 
(because it was safe to walk home then) to swap ideas on science, technology 
and changing the world. They were sending spies from Germany, France and all 
over to try to find out what they were up to, because everything was being 
invented in the Midlands.Soho House is still going and well worth a visit 
<http://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/soho>.

It’s typical of Brum that the modern world was invented in Handsworth and 
nobody knows about it. I am trying to start a “Make it in Birmingham” campaign, 
to get high-tech industries – film, animation, virtual reality, gaming – all 
into one place, a place where people make things, which is what Birmingham has 
always been.

 Thing of beauty … Spaghetti Junction 
Spaghetti Junction is the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen at night. When 
we madeLocke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/17/locke-review-tom-hardy> [starring 
Tom Hardy], about a man driving from Birmingham to London, I just said to the 
director of photography: “Can we film it so it looks like a painting?” You just 
see all the red lights, white lights and flashing blue lights going over this 
ribbon. It’s gorgeous, and shows that – when looked at it in a certain way – 
something that’s considered to be conventionally ugly is actually beautiful. 
That’s Birmingham.

In the States a lot of Hispanic and black audiences are gravitating towards 
Peaky Blinders.A mate of went into a bar in Santa Monica and sent me a photo of 
four blokes dressed as Peakies – they meet every week for a Peaky Blinders 
evening. In London there are clubs that do Peakies nights – I am loving that 
all this happening. We’re in the early stages of do a clothing range, too, 
called Garrison [the name of the pub in the series], producing clothes in the 
Peaky style.

 The Custard Factory area of Digbeth houses many independent creative 
businesses. Photograph: Newsteam 
If you’re in Brum, go the Digbeth area, adjacent to the city centre. It’s 
transforming before our eyes. It used to be the industrial heart of Birmingham, 
full of Victorian factories, a lot like Tribeca in New York (and was probably 
built in the same era by the same people) and is becoming one of the city’s 
main creative centres. There’s lots going on at theCustard Factory 
<http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/>, which has studio space, boutiques and 
vintage shops, andthe Spotted Dog <http://www.spotteddog.co.uk/> is a great 
Digbeth pub.

If you want an authentic Peaky Blinders-era pub, try the Bartons Arms in Aston 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/21/top-10-craft-beer-pubs-in-birmingham>
. If you want posh, Michelin-starredSimpsons restaurant 
<http://www.simpsonsrestaurant.co.uk/> is hard to beat, and the Hotel du Vin 
<https://www.hotelduvin.com/locations/birmingham/> serves wonderful food and 
wine, too. 

I’m a big Birmingham City supporter and seeing the fans dressed as Peaky 
Blinders is one of my proudest moments.It was the last game of the season and 
we had to draw to avoid relegation, and everyone was dressed as Peakies, and 
then we score in the last minute of injury time and stay up, and everyone is 
crying and everybody’s got their caps on … It was brilliant!

• The third series of Peaky Blinders starts on BBC2 on Thursday 5 May
