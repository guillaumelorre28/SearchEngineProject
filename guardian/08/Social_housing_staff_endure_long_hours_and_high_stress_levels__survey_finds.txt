The vast majority (92%) of social housing professionals regularly work over 
their contracted hours – by an average of six extra hours each week, a survey 
has revealed.

The survey was carried as part of a broader investigation into staff wellbeing 
<http://gu.com/p/49tty/stw> in public services by the Guardian Society 
Professionals Network. Surveys were completed by 3,700 housing, healthcare, 
social care, local government, central government, policing and voluntary 
sector staff and results revealed a widespread working culture of rising 
stress, increased workloads and long hours.


Sixty-five percent of staff said they needed to stay late to keep up with 
their workload, and 37% said their family life suffered as a result. Only 39% 
thought the extra hours helped their career prospects at their organisation. 
Despite the culture of long hours, one in 10 workers relies on a second job to 
make ends meet.

We work with some of the most vulnerable people and supporting them can 
sometimes be particularly stressful

However, conditions for social housing professionals remain better than for 
many staff in other public services. More than 40% took breaks of more than 30 
minutes each day compared to just 24% of colleagues in other services. 
Employees were also less likely to suffer from severe stress: 37% of housing 
professionals felt stressed all or most of the time compared to 53% from other 
public services.

Social housing <https://www.theguardian.com/society/social-housing> emerged as 
one of best sectors for employees with children or caring responsibilities, 
with 57% of respondents saying their department actively supports staff who 
have people to care for at home. The average across all public services for 
this figure was 37%.

Housing <https://www.theguardian.com/society/housing> associations, as 
independent bodies, have been somewhat protected from swingeing department cuts 
in comparison to other public services, but cuts to housing benefit through the 
benefit cap and bedroom tax have severely affected their tenants. Many 
respondents blamed these cuts for an increasing workload and stress levels.

One social housing director said: “When you are so reliant on people who are 
paid welfare benefits, any changes or cuts impact on us. We work with some of 
the most vulnerable people and supporting them can sometimes be particularly 
stressful, especially with such huge cuts to public services that they often 
rely on.”

Respondents cited the emotional toll of working with tenants struggling to 
cope with benefit cuts as a cause of stress.

“Staff working on the frontline dealing with the public are having to cope 
with the hard realities of the austerity agenda and often feel helpless in how 
they can assist. This is not a nice situation,” said one social inclusion 
officer.

Perceived attacks from government and the media also contributed to low 
morale. “Many groups of public sector workers are also spoken about in 
pejorative terms, particularly by the Tories and by the media, which is 
upsetting too,” one governance manager said.
