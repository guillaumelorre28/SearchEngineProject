The fourth and final day of the 2016 Democratic national convention has ended, 
if you don’t count the ongoing balloon-related activity on the floor, where 
dozens of delegates continue to linger.

Here’s what happened: 

 * Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination, becoming 
the first woman to be nominated by a major party for the country’s highest 
office. 
 * Clinton delivered an hourlong speech that was part biography, part 
profession of faith, part political prospectus, part job application and part 
attack on Donald Trump. 
 * “He’s offering empty promises,” Clinton said. “What are we offering? A bold 
agenda to improve the lives of people across our country - to keep you safe, to 
get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve.
The choice is clear.”

 * Clinton: “Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you 
can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” 
 * The night was programmed to highlight the historic nature of Clinton’s 
nomination, with speaker after speaker calling for a first female president. 
However the rest of the country felt, the cheering room agreed that it was 
participating in history. 
 * Clinton ignored attempts by scattered protesters to interrupt her speech, 
and sometimes the crowd helped her by chanting “Hillary! Hillary!” 
 * The show was almost stolen by Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim soldier 
killed into Iraq,who tore into Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/khizr-khan-democratic-convention-constitution-trump>
, his veiled wife standing beside him. “Donald Trump ... Let me ask you, have 
you even read the United States constitution?” Khan asked, pulling a copy from 
his pocket. “I will gladly lend you my copy.” 
 * Introducing her mother, Chelsea Clinton delivered a personal speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/28/chelsea-clinton-introduction-hillary-democratic-convention>
about feeling supported as a child. “That feeling – being valued and loved – 
that’s something my mom wants for every child,” she said. 
 * Sanders congratulated Clinton “on this historic achievement” in a tweet. 
“We are stronger together,” he wrote. 
 * “Great speech,” the president thought: President Obama (@POTUS) 
Great speech. She's tested. She's ready. She never quits. That's why Hillary 
should be our next@POTUS <https://twitter.com/POTUS>. (She'll get the Twitter 
handle, too)

<https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/758867227328163841> 
 * Clinton managed some lighter moments in her attacks on Trump, as when she 
described his convention speech: “He spoke for 70-odd minutes – and I do mean 
odd.” 
 * The Trump campaign replied that the Clinton speech was “an insulting 
collection of cliches and recycled rhetoric.” 
The four days of convening are over. Just more than 100 days left until the 
election now (!). Here’s how the week began:

Some people are wondering whether it would have hurt Trump so much to show a 
little graciousness in deference to the historic quality of Clinton’s win.

The Internet remembers that John McCain congratulated Barack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> in an ad:

Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. So I wanted to stop 
and say, congratulations.”
Ed Demaria (@Eddie_Dynamite) 
When President Obama became first African-American nominee, his opponent CUT 
AN AD congratulating him on the feat!https://t.co/QOYzDXuscN

Back for the last time is convention chairwoman Marcia Fudge. She asks for a 
motion to adjourn. The ayes have it.


“We are adjourned! Thank you Philadelphia.”

That’s it. Now everybody squeezes into the human traffic jam to get to the car 
traffic jam that will take them away, painfully slowly, from this quadrant of 
sports infrastructure in South Philly to the celebratory destinations of their 
choices.

The fourth and final day of the 2016 Democratic national convention has ended, 
if you don’t count the ongoing balloon-related activity on the floor, where 
dozens of delegates continue to linger.

Here’s what happened: 

 * Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination, becoming 
the first woman to be nominated by a major party for the country’s highest 
office. 
 * Clinton delivered an hourlong speech that was part biography, part 
profession of faith, part political prospectus, part job application and part 
attack on Donald Trump. 
 * “He’s offering empty promises,” Clinton said. “What are we offering? A bold 
agenda to improve the lives of people across our country - to keep you safe, to 
get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve.
The choice is clear.”

 * Clinton: “Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you 
can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” 
 * The night was programmed to highlight the historic nature of Clinton’s 
nomination, with speaker after speaker calling for a first female president. 
However the rest of the country felt, the cheering room agreed that it was 
participating in history. 
 * Clinton ignored attempts by scattered protesters to interrupt her speech, 
and sometimes the crowd helped her by chanting “Hillary! Hillary!” 
 * The show was almost stolen by Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim soldier 
killed into Iraq,who tore into Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/khizr-khan-democratic-convention-constitution-trump>
, his veiled wife standing beside him. “Donald Trump ... Let me ask you, have 
you even read the United States constitution?” Khan asked, pulling a copy from 
his pocket. “I will gladly lend you my copy.” 
 * Introducing her mother, Chelsea Clinton delivered a personal speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/28/chelsea-clinton-introduction-hillary-democratic-convention>
about feeling supported as a child. “That feeling – being valued and loved – 
that’s something my mom wants for every child,” she said. 
 * Sanders congratulated Clinton “on this historic achievement” in a tweet. 
“We are stronger together,” he wrote. 
 * “Great speech,” the president thought: President Obama (@POTUS) 
Great speech. She's tested. She's ready. She never quits. That's why Hillary 
should be our next@POTUS <https://twitter.com/POTUS>. (She'll get the Twitter 
handle, too)

<https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/758867227328163841> 
 * Clinton managed some lighter moments in her attacks on Trump, as when she 
described his convention speech: “He spoke for 70-odd minutes – and I do mean 
odd.” 
 * The Trump campaign replied that the Clinton speech was “an insulting 
collection of cliches and recycled rhetoric.” 
The four days of convening are over. Just more than 100 days left until the 
election now (!). Here’s how the week began:

Some people are wondering whether it would have hurt Trump so much to show a 
little graciousness in deference to the historic quality of Clinton’s win.

The Internet remembers that John McCain congratulated Barack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> in an ad:

Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. So I wanted to stop 
and say, congratulations.”

AN AD congratulating him on the feat!https://t.co/QOYzDXuscN

Why this convention is better: It's about loving America. GOP convention was 
about loving Trump. If you didn't love Trump, it offered nada.

Back for the last time is convention chairwoman Marcia Fudge. She asks for a 
motion to adjourn. The ayes have it.


“We are adjourned! Thank you Philadelphia.”

That’s it. Now everybody squeezes into the human traffic jam to get to the car 
traffic jam that will take them away, painfully slowly, from this quadrant of 
sports infrastructure in South Philly to the celebratory destinations of their 
choices.
