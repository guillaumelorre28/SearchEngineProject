I wake at 5.25am. My alarm starts at 5.30am. It plays “Lovely Day 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYi7uEvEEmk>” by Bill Withers. I check 
Facebook. I check Twitter. Then I have a twinge of self-hatred for checking 
Facebook and Twitter. But I am reaching for words, I tell myself.

These are unprecedented times for the author and reader. There are more 
written words flowing between us than at any other time, and I am part of a 
privileged generation who knew what it was like before the internet. I ponder 
this, and check Facebook again.

Poetry is everywhere. It’s in the art of Tracey Emin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/emin>, in the lyrics of Amy Winehouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse>. In the Bond film, Skyfall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/25/skyfall-review>, Judi Dench 
quotes “Ulysses” by Tennyson. And Adele, who sings the theme tune, started her 
journey into lyrics by writing poetry. JK Rowling uses poetry through the 
sorting hat. Maya Angelou was there to laud President Obama with a poem when he 
became president.

Poetry <https://www.theguardian.com/books/poetry> is most called for when we 
“haven’t the words”, at times of joy or sadness, reconciliation or separation. 
If you hear the phrase “It was beyond words”, you can bet it wasn’t.

I’m a morning person. After a shower (I should have meditated), I crunch 
breakfast, slurp tea, feel rested. I begin work with an attempt to write an 
original description of dawn in fewer than 140 characters. It takes between 15 
minutes and three hours each day. This morning it took 90 minutes. I sat by the 
computer at 6.15am and by 7.30am I got it:

A pause between end & applause
To the Valkyries’ delight
A graceful bow from darkness
A standing ovation of light

I pressed send. This summer, in the Royal Albert Hall, I presented a Ten Pieces
Prom with Naomi Wilkinson, Dion Dublin, Dan Starkey and Leah Boleto. Alpesh 
Chauhan conducted the BBC Philarmonic and one of the pieces was “The Ride of 
the Valkyries”.

I am fascinated by that moment, the magical one caught between the end of a 
performance and the beginning of the applause, where there is nothing but 
electricity in the air. It’s like dawn, the pause suspended between the 
certainty of night and the unknowable day ahead. I sit after pressing send. My 
splayed hands hover above the keyboard. An artist doesn’t need to suffer to 
create, but if he doesn’t create he will suffer. The day begins.

My description of dawn goes out as a Tweet and on Facebook. At 8.15am I arrive 
at my favourite cafe in Angel, North London. I continue a script for a BBC 
Radio 4 programme aboutBob Marley <https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobmarley>
. By 11.30 I am being interviewed for a documentary, and then it’s back to 
Hackney for more filming.

I go for lunch with my agent in Soho – a long lunch during which we talk 
projects, gossip and all the good stuff. By 5pm I am back in Angel at the cafe. 
I continue working on a different script until 7pm. I’ll be recording it at the 
BBC next week, for a series calledOrigin Stories.

In the evening I get my book face on and begin De Profundis and Other Writings 
by Oscar Wilde in preparation for my reading ofDe Profundis at Reading prison, 
where he was once an inmate. Other readers include Patti Smith and Maxine Peake.

I think in poetry – free verse mainly – and speak in inadequate sentences. 
Most of us do.

I’ll just check my Facebook page again. I think Matt Haig 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matt-haig> has said something funny about 
depression on Twitter. Oh look a Trump gif. Type: “Matt. That’s funny that is.” 
Press send. Miranda Sawyer’s on a book tour. My mate Sophie Willan is smashing 
Edinburgh. Type “Well done Sophie”. Press Send. Check email.
