Take me there: Jurassic Coast, Dorset


Why go?
When it comes to natural beauty the Dorset coast has always held its own 
against Devon and Cornwall, but it's never quite been able to match the choice 
of cool places to stay. That's set to change this summer with the opening of 
a handful of gorgeous new hangouts. Add to this the return ofBroadchurch, 
filmed around West Bay, later this year, and Dorset looks like one of this 
year's hottest holiday spots.

What to do
Search for the fossils which give the coast its name. Popular spots include 
Charmouth and Lyme Regis: the guided walks run by the Charmouth Heritage Coast 
Centre (charmouth.org/chcc <http://charmouth.org/chcc/>) and Lyme Regis Museum (
lymeregismuseum.co.uk <http://lymeregismuseum.co.uk/>) are great. Bustling 
Bridport's chichi shops, cool cafés, art deco picture house (
electricpalace.org.uk <http://electricpalace.org.uk/>) and Saturday market have 
earned it the nickname Notting Hill on Sea. Catch your supper on a mackerel 
fishing trip from West Bay (westbayfishingtrips.co.uk 
<http://westbayfishingtrips.co.uk/>).

Where to eat
 Try Lyme Bay crab sandwiches and Exe mussels at the famous (and crowded) Hive 
Beach Café <http://www.hivebeachcafe.co.uk/> in Burton Bradstock. The Watch 
House Café <http://watchhousecafe.co.uk/> in West Bay and Rachel's seafood 
shack near the quayside (3 The Mound, West Bay) make excellent alternatives.

Where to stay
A spectacular clifftop location and cool interiors ensure that the Pig on the 
Beach will be as popular as its New Forest namesake when it opens in Studland 
Bay on 11 June (from £139,thepighotel.com <http://www.thepighotel.com/>). In 
Lyme Regis, chef Mark Hix has just opened the Hix Townhouse, a stylish 
eight-bedroom guesthouse in a Georgian townhouse (from £125,hixtownhouse.co.uk 
<http://hixtownhouse.co.uk/>). And in autumn former Groucho Club MD Mary-Lou 
Sturridge opens the Seaside Boarding House overlooking Chesil Beach (

Insider tip 
"The best way of exploring the coast is on the top deck of the Jurassic 
Coaster X53 bus – it's breathtaking," says Julia Pulman of the Jurassic Coast 
World Heritage Team (jurassiccoast.org <http://jurassiccoast.org/>). It runs 
hourly between Lyme Regis and Weymouth in summer.
