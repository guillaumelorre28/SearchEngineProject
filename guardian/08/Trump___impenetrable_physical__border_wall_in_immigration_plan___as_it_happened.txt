 * Top Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
aide Huma Abedin announced this morning that she had separated from her 
husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner, after the publication of newly 
revealed, explicit Twitter messages sent by Weiner to a woman he met online. 
“After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the 
decision to separate from my husband,” Abedin said in a statement. “Anthony and 
I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our 
life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.” 
 * Donald Trump issued a statement on the separation: “I only worry for the 
country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner 
to have such close proximity to highly classified information. Who knows what 
he learned and who he told? It’s just another example of Hillary Clinton’s bad 
judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly 
compromised by this.” 
 * The highly respected pollsters at Monmouth University, who earn an A+ in 
FiveThirtyEight’spollster ratings 
<http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/>, have published a new 
survey 
<http://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_082916/> 
depicting Hillary Clinton as seven points ahead of Donald Trump, 46-39, among 
likely voters in a four-way presidential race. That margin is right in line with
polling averages

.

 * Our strategy for figuring out what Donald Trump’s plan is on immigration is 
to wait and see what he says in his big speech on the topic announced for 
Wednesday. Here’s an episode from this morning that illustrates why.Talk by 
Trump surrogates <https://twitter.com/NoahCRothman/status/770251886570209281> 
about features of a “virtual wall” along the border with Mexico wasreported 
<https://twitter.com/AriMelber/status/770277754784903168?lang=en> by MSNBC as 
another potential shift in Trump’s policy, except now the Trump camp has said 
there’s no shift: Jim Acosta (@Acosta) 
Sr. Trump adv: Reports of "virtual wall" are false. Trump determined to build 
wall, adv says: "It will be an impenetrable physical barrier."

 * Onetime New York City mayor and full-time Donald Trump surrogate Rudy 
Giuliani has condemned onetime child of destiny and fulltime music icon 
Beyoncé’s performance at last night’s MTV Video Music Awards, calling her 
influence on young people “a shame.” When asked by Fox & Friends cohost Ainsley 
Earhardt how he felt about Beyoncé’s15-minute performance 
<https://www.facebook.com/MTV/videos/10153999778031701/>, in which backup 
dancers dressed in white “died” onstage due to stylized gunshots, Giuliani said 
that he had saved more black lives from violence than Beyoncé ever has.

 * White supremacist and onetime Ku Klux Klan imperial wizard David Duke has 
released a robocall encouraging Louisiana voters to cast their votes for his 
senate bid - and for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

Hillary Clinton is taking aim at blood-red Utah in a new campaign 
advertisement, hitting Donald Trump as “unfit and unprepared” to serve as 
president in a state that has been tepid in its response to the Republican 
nominee,according to the Salt Lake Tribune 
<http://www.sltrib.com/home/4292213-155/clinton-hits-trump-in-utah-in>.

The campaign mailer, sent to an unknown number of Utah residents, shows a 
stern-looking woman above a line of dialogue calling Trump’s potential 
administration “alarming”:

You care about your community and the future of the country. That’s why the 
thought ofDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as 
president is so alarming.

In an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, longtime Trump friend and business 
associate Tom Barrack said he did not wantDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to talk about Huma Abedin and 
Anthony Weiner - despite the campaign’s release of a statement critiquing the 
disgraced former congressman as a national security risk.

“Personally, I don’t,” Barrack said. “Because I think it detracts from the 
substance. I understand it, right? In other words, he’s saying, look, I’m here 
- the American people want a leader, they want somebody who stands in the 
middle of that fire and fights and fights to win.”

“So if I have all these issues, I’m going to use them and they can use them on 
me. Bring it on, right? Nobody else does that. Everybody says, I’m not going to 
bring that up because somebody is going to bring it up on me,” Barrack 
continued. “He walks into the fire and says, I’m going to use everything that I 
have. I don’t personally agree with that.”

Trump campaign CEO accused of sexual harassment in '90s lawsuit

Trump campaign CEO Stephen Bannon was accused of workplace sexual harassment 
in a legal dispute during his time as director of a scientific research 
facility that aimed to prepare human for terraforming the planet Mars,according 
to a report from Buzzfeed News 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-campaign-ceo-was-accused-of-sexual-harassment-in-90s-l?utm_term=.wkrQNQemkd#.qswlvldR1G>

The lawsuit, filed in 1994, was the result of alleged comments made by Bannon 
during his tenure as the director of Biosphere 2, a scientific research 
facility in Oracle, Arizona, that was created as a closed system of biomes 
aimed to replicate the Earth.

The suit, filed by former Biosphere 2 director Margret Augustine, accused 
Bannon of disparaging female employees of the facility and making sexualized 
comments towards her personally. Bannon denied the charges at the time, which 
were later dropped, and the Trump campaign released a statement denying the 
charges today:

The Bass Organization sued Ms. Augustine for fraud for embezzling $800,000. 
She then sued two representatives of the Bass Organization having never 
complained about any behavior. Subsequently, she dropped her legal action. Ms 
Augustine was removed as CEO in a corporate restructuring in 1993.

In her complaint, Augustine accused Bannon of “insulting to the plaintiff and 
other females employees of Biosphere 2, and in their presence, and against 
their will, made lewd remarks, told offensive off-color stories, made 
disparaging remarks about females, made sexually suggestive remarks, discussed 
females they had known in a lewd and derogatory fashion and in general acted 
with total indifference to the feelings of the plaintiff and other female 
employees of Biosphere 2.”

aggressive shouting jag with an MSNBC journalist on-air, at one point asking 
the host where her ancestors are from.

In an interview with a Seattle-area radio talk show host, Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump called disgraced former congressman Anthony 
Weiner a “disaster,” callingnews of his separation from wife and Hillary 
Clinton adviser Huma Abedin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-sexting-twitter-scandal>
 a national security risk.

“I said a long time ago she’s married to a guy who is a disaster,” Trump told 
the Dori Monson Show, a conservative afternoon talk-radio program in the 
Seattle area. “I’ve known him for a long time. Here’s a guy - what he’s done 
over the internet is disgusting, and he’s a pervert and just a very sick guy. 
And she is married to him.”

Trump appeared to imply that Abedin’s marriage to Weiner was a lapse in 
judgment, and put national security at risk by virtue of what he described as 
her access to classified information.

“She’s married to a guy that is uncontrolled and uncontrollable. He’s a sick 
person, and you know she has access to classified information,” Trump said. 
“Huma Abedin has access to classified information. How Hillary got away with 
that one, nobody will ever know. But to think that it’s very likely that much 
of this information Anthony Weiner would know about, and I think it’s something 
that was terrible.”

On Weiner, Trump did not hold back.

“He’s a sick person. He’s a sick puppy. And so you know it just happened and 
it’s actually sad in many ways. He’s a very sick guy and I said if you look 
back you’ll see that I said at the beginning the worst thing she can do is 
marry this guy. I’ve known him because he’s a politician, I’ve known him for 
quite a while and I understood that that he had difficulties. And certainly 
when it came out, I don’t know if these people get cured, it doesn’t seem like 
it.”

 * Top Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
aide Huma Abedin announced this morning that she had separated from her 
husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner, after the publication of newly 
revealed, explicit Twitter messages sent by Weiner to a woman he met online. 
“After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the 
decision to separate from my husband,” Abedin said in a statement. “Anthony and 
I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our 
life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.” 
 * Donald Trump issued a statement on the separation: “I only worry for the 
country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner 
to have such close proximity to highly classified information. Who knows what 
he learned and who he told? It’s just another example of Hillary Clinton’s bad 
judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly 
compromised by this.”

Hillary Clinton is taking aim at blood-red Utah in a new campaign 
advertisement, hitting Donald Trump as “unfit and unprepared” to serve as 
president in a state that has been tepid in its response to the Republican 
nominee,according to the Salt Lake Tribune 
<http://www.sltrib.com/home/4292213-155/clinton-hits-trump-in-utah-in>.

The campaign mailer, sent to an unknown number of Utah residents, shows a 
stern-looking woman above a line of dialogue calling Trump’s potential 
administration “alarming”:

You care about your community and the future of the country. That’s why the 
thought ofDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as 
president is so alarming.
 
In an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, longtime Trump friend and business 
associate Tom Barrack said he did not wantDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to talk about Huma Abedin and 
Anthony Weiner - despite the campaign’s release of a statement critiquing the 
disgraced former congressman as a national security risk.

“Personally, I don’t,” Barrack said. “Because I think it detracts from the 
substance. I understand it, right? In other words, he’s saying, look, I’m here 
- the American people want a leader, they want somebody who stands in the 
middle of that fire and fights and fights to win.”

“So if I have all these issues, I’m going to use them and they can use them on 
me. Bring it on, right? Nobody else does that. Everybody says, I’m not going to 
bring that up because somebody is going to bring it up on me,” Barrack 
continued. “He walks into the fire and says, I’m going to use everything that I 
have. I don’t personally agree with that.”

 
Trump campaign CEO Stephen Bannon was accused of workplace sexual harassment 
in a legal dispute during his time as director of a scientific research 
facility that aimed to prepare human for terraforming the planet Mars,according

The lawsuit, filed in 1994, was the result of alleged comments made by Bannon 
during his tenure as the director of Biosphere 2, a scientific research 
facility in Oracle, Arizona, that was created as a closed system of biomes 
aimed to replicate the Earth.

The suit, filed by former Biosphere 2 director Margret Augustine, accused 
Bannon of disparaging female employees of the facility and making sexualized 
comments towards her personally. Bannon denied the charges at the time, which 
were later dropped, and the Trump campaign released a statement denying the 
charges today:

The Bass Organization sued Ms. Augustine for fraud for embezzling $800,000. 
She then sued two representatives of the Bass Organization having never 
complained about any behavior. Subsequently, she dropped her legal action. Ms 
Augustine was removed as CEO in a corporate restructuring in 1993.

In her complaint, Augustine accused Bannon of “insulting to the plaintiff and 
other females employees of Biosphere 2, and in their presence, and against 
their will, made lewd remarks, told offensive off-color stories, made 
disparaging remarks about females, made sexually suggestive remarks, discussed 
females they had known in a lewd and derogatory fashion and in general acted 
with total indifference to the feelings of the plaintiff and other female 
employees of Biosphere 2.”

California gubernatorial candidate, will stump forHillary Clinton

campaign for the Democratic presidential nominee in a meeting with Colorado 
business leaders.

Whitman “discuss Clinton’s plan to create jobs, invest in tech businesses, and 
make it easier for small business owners to succeed,” according to a campaign 
release that trumpets Whitman as a “35-year business veteran” and her 
declaration earlier this year that Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is “unfit to be president.”

In an interview with a Seattle-area radio talk show host, Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump called disgraced former congressman Anthony 
Weiner a “disaster,” callingnews of his separation from wife and Hillary 
Clinton adviser Huma Abedin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-sexting-twitter-scandal>
 a national security risk.

“I said a long time ago she’s married to a guy who is a disaster,” Trump told 
the Dori Monson Show, a conservative afternoon talk-radio program in the 
Seattle area. “I’ve known him for a long time. Here’s a guy - what he’s done 
over the internet is disgusting, and he’s a pervert and just a very sick guy. 
And she is married to him.”

Trump appeared to imply that Abedin’s marriage to Weiner was a lapse in 
judgment, and put national security at risk by virtue of what he described as 
her access to classified information.

“She’s married to a guy that is uncontrolled and uncontrollable. He’s a sick 
person, and you know she has access to classified information,” Trump said. 
“Huma Abedin has access to classified information. How Hillary got away with 
that one, nobody will ever know. But to think that it’s very likely that much 
of this information Anthony Weiner would know about, and I think it’s something 
that was terrible.”

On Weiner, Trump did not hold back.

“He’s a sick person. He’s a sick puppy. And so you know it just happened and 
it’s actually sad in many ways. He’s a very sick guy and I said if you look 
back you’ll see that I said at the beginning the worst thing she can do is 
marry this guy. I’ve known him because he’s a politician, I’ve known him for 
quite a while and I understood that that he had difficulties. And certainly 
when it came out, I don’t know if these people get cured, it doesn’t seem like 
it.”
