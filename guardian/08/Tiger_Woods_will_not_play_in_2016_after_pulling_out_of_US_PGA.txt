“Continuing to make progress, but simply not ready for PGA,” Woods’s agent, 
Mark Steinberg,told the Golf Channel in an email 
<http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golf-central-blog/woods-wds-pga-wont-play-season>
. “Will not play in the 15/16 season and will continue to rehab and work hard 
to then assess when he starts play for the 16/17 season.”

Woods has not played tournament golf since last August and is currently 
attempting to return to competition following back surgery. Four of his 14 
major victories came at the US PGA, with the last of them coming at Southern 
Hills in 2007. His last major win was the 2008 US Open, and his last top-10 
finish in a major was in 2013.

The 40 year-old has admitted that he is not sure when he will return to 
competitive golf. “That’s the overriding question I keep hearing: when are you 
coming back, when are you playing?”he said in May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/16/tiger-woods-return-date-golf-back-surgery>
. “I get it all the time. If I knew, I’d tell you, because it’d be fun to know.”

This year’s US PGA will take place at Baltusrol Golf 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/golf> Club in Springfield, New Jersey from 
28-31 July. It is being played earlier than usual to accommodate the Olympic 
golf tournament, which takes place at the start of August.
