Today in Campaign 2016

 * Donald Trump attempted to finally resolve an issue that is thought to have 
caused him significant damage with minority voters byadmitting that Barack 
Obama was born in the US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-obama-birth-certificate-clinton>
 after years of promoting false claims that the US president was born in Kenya. 
But the Republican presidential candidate continued to falsely claim that his 
Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was behind the conspiracy theory. 
 * Clinton spoke only a few blocks away at the Black Women’s Agenda symposium, 
held at a downtown hotel. Clinton said that “there is no erasing” Trump’s role 
in spreading the “birther” gospel. “For five years he has led the birther 
movement to delegitimize our first black president,” she said. “His campaign 
was founded on this outrageous lie. “He is feeding into the worst impulses, the 
bigotry and bias, that lurks in our country. Barack Obama was born in America, 
plain and simple, and Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.”
 * Speaking in Virginia, first lady Michelle Obama told an audience of college 
students that criticism of her husband’s birthplace have been a constant 
companion since 2008, without mentioning Trump’s name. “There were those who 
questioned and continued to question for the past eight years and to this day 
whether my husband was even born in this country,” she said, alluding to the 
Republican nominee without mentioning him by name.

 * Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party will 
not be allowed to take part in the first televised debate of the race for the 
White House,the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced 
<http://www.debates.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=65&cntnt01origid=27&cntnt01detailtemplate=newspage&cntnt01returnid=80>
 today. Johnson, once a Republican governor of New Mexico, has pinned his hopes 
on taking part in the debates. He and Stein, however, fell well short of the 
15% national polling average required to participate.

 * Donald Trump today named one of the nation’s top anti-abortion activists to 
his campaign coalition, in the clearest signal yet that the presidential 
candidate hasfully embraced Republicans’ typically harsh stance against abortion
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/17/restricting-abortion-republican-controlled-congress>
. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B Anthony List, a group that 
works to elect Republican, anti-abortion women, will chair the loose coalition 
of conservative, anti-abortion rights leaders who are working to elect the 
Republican nominee. Trump’s campaign also announced that he would commit to a 
law banning public funding of abortion.

Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton's secret service detail should disarm, 'Let's 
see what happens to her'

Mere hours after he appeared to put one of the oldest criticisms of his 
presidential campaign to rest with the acknowledgment that President Barack 
Obamawas born in the United States 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/hillary-clinton-responds-trump-second-amendment-violence-election>
, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told supporters that his 
opponent’s Secret Service detail should disarm itself due to what he 
characterized as her opposition to the Second Amendment.

“Take their guns away,” Trump said of Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, his Democratic opponent. 
“Let’s see what happens to her.”

Speaking at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida, Trump criticized Clinton’s 
stance on gun-control issues, characterizing her stance as wanting to “abolish” 
the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects the right to keep 
and bear arms. (This claim has been debunked 
<http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2016/aug/12/chris-collins/clintons-views-do-not-go-against-constitution/>
.)

If Clinton were truly as anti-gun as she claims to be, Trump told the 
audience, her Secret Service detail should disarm itself.

“I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons - they should disarm. I 
think they should disarm immediately, what do you think?” Trump asked the 
raucous crowd.

“Let’s see what happens to her.”

Trump was deeply criticized 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment>
 in August after suggesting at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, that 
gunowners could take the Second Amendment into their own hands if Clinton were 
elected and began nominating Supreme Court justices.

“Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment,” Trump 
said at the time.

“If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the 
second amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know. But I’ll tell you what, 
that will be a horrible day.”

The remarks were seen by many - including the Democratic nominee herself 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/hillary-clinton-responds-trump-second-amendment-violence-election>
 - as hinting at calling for Clinton’s assassination, or that of her judicial 
nominees.

Standard fare as Republican speakers warm up the crowd ahead of Donald Trump’s 
scheduled 6pm appearance. “It’s a honor to be with so many deplorables,” says 
Blaise Ingoglio, chair of Florida’s RNC. Inevitable chants of USA! USA! follow.

He returns to address the crowd in Spanish, and the audience is notably 
quieter. Even a mention of Marco Rubio, the Florida senator and former Trump 
opponent in the primary race who is hugely popular around these parts, raised 
barely a ripple.

But other speakers, conservative commentator AJ Delgado, a senior Trump 
campaign adviser born to Cuban-immigrant parents, and Carlos Curbelo, a 
Republican congressman from South Miami who has until now been lukewarm on his 
support for Trump, got the crowd fired up again, with the now-familiar “Hillary 
lied” narrative.

Cue shouts of “lock her up, lock her up!”Trump is in the house and on stage 
imminently, and the auditorium is now full.

Few of the Trump supporters The Guardian spoke to on their way in to tonight’s 
rally in downtown Miami had much time for today’s developments in the “birther” 
controversy.

“It’s a distraction to what we should be talking about,” said Michael 
Rodriguez, 34, a Cuban-American restaurant worker who lives in Little Havana. 
“This election is about jobs, the economy, immigration and America being strong 
again.”

Janusz Biskupek, 50, of Boca Raton, cut a striking figure in a pristine white 
suit emblazoned with pro-Trump slogans. “Trump is a smart guy. I want my 
president to be respected,” he said. “Obama? He went to Cuba and nobody waited 
on him. We need a stronger president. We needDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.”

The arena at the James L Knight centre, however, was filling up slowly, with 
plenty of room still in the bleachers with Trump scheduled on stage in less 
than half an hour. Perhaps the rival attraction of a Friday night Kanye West 
concert a stone’s thrown away was more of a draw.

The choice for president is “excruciatingly clear”, First Lady Michelle Obama 
said during her campaign trail debut, urging the college audience to support
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> this 
November.

Obama cast the election as a choice between “one of the most qualified people 
who has ever endeavored to become president” and someone who doesn’t “take the 
job seriously”. Ticking off a list of accomplishments of her husband’s 
administration, Obama argued that with the past eight years as a guide, Trump 
is neither prepared nor qualified to be president.

“A candidate is not going to suddenly change when they get into office – it’s 
the opposite,” Obama told the crowd of mostly students and young people at 
George Mason University in Virginia. “In fact, because the minute that 
individual takes that oath, they are under the hottest, harshest light there 
is.”

She referenced her moving speech at the Democratic National Convention, “when 
they go low, we go high,” going after the Republican nominee without mentioning 
his name.

“Being president isn’t anything like reality TV,” she said, drawing loud 
cheers and applause.

Obama recalled the 2008 campaign, reminding the audience that raising 
questions about a president’s experience, qualifications and judgments is all 
part of a very public vetting process to be president.

“And then there were those who questioned and continued to question for the 
past eight years and to this day whether my husband was even born in this 
country,” she said, alluding to the Republican nominee without mentioning him 
by name.

Trump helped fan the flames of birtherism, a conspiracy theory that President 
Obama was not born in the US but in Kenya, and used the issue to help propel 
his political ambitions.

Facing dismal approval ratings among minority voters, Trump admitted on Friday 
morning for the first time that Barack Obama was born in the US.

Obama is a powerful and popular ally for Clinton, especially among young 
voters. New polling shows that millennials, disappointed by their options for 
president have turned toward third-party candidates.

The First Lady’s appearance on a college campus in the battleground state of 
Virginia, the First Lady’s event is part of a broader push by the Clinton 
campaign to win back some of the millennial voters who have strayed in recent 
weeks. Next week, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic 
challenger whose campaign was powered by young people and students, will 
campaign for Clinton in the coming days.

“Elections aren’t just about who votes but who doesn’t vote,” she said, 
imploring the young people in the crowd to support Clinton. She encouraged them 
to fight the urge to want to “hide under the bed” and avoid the election 
altogether. She also addressed a complaint many young people who felt inspired 
by Sander’s underdog campaign have leveled at Clinton.

“I hear folks saying they don’t feel inspired in this election,” Obama said. 
“Well let me tell you, I disagree. I am inspired. Because for eight years, I’ve 
had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job, and here is 
what I absolutely know for sure. Listen to this: Right now we have an 
opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored 
to become president.”

Perhaps above all, the campaign event was a testament to Obama’s enduring 
popularity.

“It is so hard to believe that it is less than 2 months until election and 
that my family is almost at the end of term,” Obama said. The crowd broke into 
a raucous round of chanting: “Four more years” chant. “No,” Obama protested, 
waving her hand at the crowd as the chant continued. “No!”

“I promise you,” she said, “Barack and I will continue to work for you for the 
rest of our lives.”

Donald Trump’s campaign is attempting to prove the false allegation that 
Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign ignited the birther rumors about 
then-opponent Barack Obama’s citizenship with an interview transcript from a 
CNN phoner with Clinton’s former campaign manager.

The transcript falls short of this claim 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf8ZWHqMnJk&feature=youtu.be>:

PATTI SOLIS DOYLE: There was a volunteer coordinator, I believe in late 2007, 
I think in December, one of our volunteer coordinators in one of the counties 
in Iowa. I don’t recall whether they an actual paid staffer, but they did 
forward an e-mail that promoted the conspiracy.

WOLF BLITZER: The birther conspiracy?

DOYLE: Yeah. Hillary made the decision immediately to let that person go. We 
let that person go.

Rush Limbaugh: ‘Are you admitting Trump is not a conservative? Damn right I 
am!’

Bellicose bloviator Rush Limbaugh made a major concession this afternoon, 
telling listeners that Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is not, in fact, a 
conservative.

“Can somebody point to me the conservative on the ballot?” Limbaugh asked his 
listeners this afternoon. 
<http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2016/09/15/we_re_beyond_ideology_folks> 
“‘What do you mean, Rush? Are you admitting Trump is not a conservative?’ Damn 
right I am!” he thundered.

“Folks, when did I ever say that he was? Look, I don’t know how to tell you 
this. Conservatism lost, in the primary, if that’s how you want to look at it. 
We had Cruz; we had Rubio.”

Limbaugh sounded uncharacteristically defeated in the segment, expressing 
frustration with the nomination of Republicans who are not conservative enough.

“Even what we’ve seen now, we haven’t seen anything,” Limbaugh said. “But the 
establishment’s gonna come together to protect themselves regardless of 
ideology. I wish conservatism was on the ballot.”

Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson has reacted to the Commission on 
Presidential Debates’ announcement that onlyHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Donald Trump will be 
invited to the first debate of the general-election campaign with frustration, 
but not with surprise.

“I would say I am surprised that the CPD has chosen to exclude me from the 
first debate, but I’m not,” Johnson said in a statement. “After all, the 
commission is a private organization created 30 years ago by the Republican and 
Democratic parties for the clear purpose of taking control of the only 
nationally-televised presidential debates voters will see. At the time of its 
creation, the leaders of those two parties made no effort to hide the fact that 
they didn’t want any third party intrusions into their shows.”

“The CPD may scoff at a ticket that enjoys ‘only’ 9 or 10% in their 
hand-selected polls, but even 9% represents 13 million voters, more than the 
total population of Ohio and most other states. Yet, the Republicans and 
Democrats are choosing to silence the candidate preferred by those millions of 
Americans.”

“It is unfortunate that the CPD doesn’t believe such a voice should be heard. 
There are more polls and more debates, and we plan to be on the debate stage in 
October.”

Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump to be sole candidates on debate stage

It’s official: Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump will be the only candidates to appear on the 
stage at the first presidential debate of the general-election campaign, after 
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party nominee Jill Stein failed to 
reach the polling threshold necessary to merit an invitation.

The Commission on Presidential Debates released a statement officially 
declaring that Clinton, Trump and their running mates will be the only people 
to appear in the first two debates:

The Board determined that the polling averages called for... are as follows: 
Hillary Clinton (43%), Donald Trump (40.4%), Gary Johnson (8.4%) and Jill Stein 
(3.2%). Accordingly, Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, andDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and his running mate, 
Mike Pence, qualify to participate in the September 26 presidential debate and 
the October 4 vice-presidential debate, respectively. No other candidates 
satisfied the criteria for inclusion.

The composition of the final two presidential debates will be decided upon 
polling in the future.

Ben Carson launches ideas forum

Ben Carson, whose campaign used money raised in the name of the lord to pay 
political consultants for – what? – and who believes that Putin, Khameni and 
Abbas used the pyramids to store guns with which Jews could have prevented the 
Holocaust, or something, has launched an “ideas forum”:

The web site of the person who runs Trump’s campaign thinks it’s funny that 
Trump announces news conferences he doesn’t hold and seems to find Trump’s 
sudden reversal on the question of Barack Obama’s native birth funny, too. 
Harmless at least. Or funny in its harmfulness? And for some reason this 
Breitbart post includes a picture of Harambe the gorilla.

The person who runs this web site is currently running Donald Trump’s 
presidential campaign:

 * Donald Trump attempted to finally resolve an issue that is thought to have 
caused him significant damage with minority voters byadmitting that Barack 
Obama was born in the US 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-obama-birth-certificate-clinton>
 after years of promoting false claims that the US president was born in Kenya. 
But the Republican presidential candidate continued to falsely claim that his 
Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was behind the conspiracy theory. 
 * Clinton spoke only a few blocks away at the Black Women’s Agenda symposium, 
held at a downtown hotel. Clinton said that “there is no erasing” Trump’s role 
in spreading the “birther” gospel. “For five years he has led the birther 
movement to delegitimize our first black president,” she said. “His campaign 
was founded on this outrageous lie. “He is feeding into the worst impulses, the 
bigotry and bias, that lurks in our country. Barack Obama was born in America, 
plain and simple, and Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.”
 * Speaking in Virginia, first lady Michelle Obama told an audience of college 
students that criticism of her husband’s birthplace have been a constant 
companion since 2008, without mentioning Trump’s name. “There were those who 
questioned and continued to question for the past eight years and to this day 
whether my husband was even born in this country,” she said, alluding to the 
Republican nominee without mentioning him by name.

 * Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party will 
not be allowed to take part in the first televised debate of the race for the 
White House,the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced 
<http://www.debates.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=65&cntnt01origid=27&cntnt01detailtemplate=newspage&cntnt01returnid=80>
 today. Johnson, once a Republican governor of New Mexico, has pinned his hopes 
on taking part in the debates. He and Stein, however, fell well short of the 
15% national polling average required to participate.

 * Donald Trump today named one of the nation’s top anti-abortion activists to 
his campaign coalition, in the clearest signal yet that the presidential 
candidate hasfully embraced Republicans’ typically harsh stance against abortion
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/17/restricting-abortion-republican-controlled-congress>
. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B Anthony List, a group that 
works to elect Republican, anti-abortion women, will chair the loose coalition 
of conservative, anti-abortion rights leaders who are working to elect the 
Republican nominee. Trump’s campaign also announced that he would commit to a 
law banning public funding of abortion.  
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> just told a 
Florida audience that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will “take your jobs, Ohio 
- remember, it’s gonna take your jobs, Ohio.”
 
Mere hours after he appeared to put one of the oldest criticisms of his 
presidential campaign to rest with the acknowledgment that President Barack 
Obamawas born in the United States 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/hillary-clinton-responds-trump-second-amendment-violence-election>
, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told supporters that his 
opponent’s Secret Service detail should disarm itself due to what he 
characterized as her opposition to the Second Amendment.

“Take their guns away,” Trump said of Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, his Democratic opponent. 
“Let’s see what happens to her.”

Speaking at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida, Trump criticized Clinton’s 
stance on gun-control issues, characterizing her stance as wanting to “abolish” 
the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects the right to keep 
and bear arms. (This claim has been debunked 
<http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2016/aug/12/chris-collins/clintons-views-do-not-go-against-constitution/>
.)

If Clinton were truly as anti-gun as she claims to be, Trump told the 
audience, her Secret Service detail should disarm itself.

“I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons - they should disarm. I 
think they should disarm immediately, what do you think?” Trump asked the 
raucous crowd.

“Let’s see what happens to her.”

Trump was deeply criticized 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment>
 in August after suggesting at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, that 
gunowners could take the Second Amendment into their own hands if Clinton were 
elected and began nominating Supreme Court justices.

“Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment,” Trump 
said at the time.

“If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the 
second amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know. But I’ll tell you what, 
that will be a horrible day.”

The remarks were seen by many - including the Democratic nominee herself 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/hillary-clinton-responds-trump-second-amendment-violence-election>
 - as hinting at calling for Clinton’s assassination, or that of her judicial 
nominees.
 
Donald Trump, on racism:

The ‘racist word’ - it’s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook, and 
Americans have had enough of it. We get it. We get it.
 
After bragging about how many African American and Latino employees he has, 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> tells the 
audience in Miami, Florida, that he is campaigning “in every part of this 
country for every last vote.”

“While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable - boy, that 
second word is tough, but that is tough,” Trump says. “I call you hardworking 
American patriots who love your family and really, really, really love your 
country.”

Trump’s remarks are met with a U-S-A chant.
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has walked 
onstage in Miami, as a Les Miserables spoof banner - Les Deplorables - shows 
his acolytes launching a revolution.

“Welcome to all of you deplorables!” Trump tells the audience.
 
Standard fare as Republican speakers warm up the crowd ahead of Donald Trump’s 
scheduled 6pm appearance. “It’s a honor to be with so many deplorables,” says 
Blaise Ingoglio, chair of Florida’s RNC. Inevitable chants of USA! USA! follow.

He returns to address the crowd in Spanish, and the audience is notably 
quieter. Even a mention of Marco Rubio, the Florida senator and former Trump 
opponent in the primary race who is hugely popular around these parts, raised 
barely a ripple.

But other speakers, conservative commentator AJ Delgado, a senior Trump 
campaign adviser born to Cuban-immigrant parents, and Carlos Curbelo, a 
Republican congressman from South Miami who has until now been lukewarm on his 
support for Trump, got the crowd fired up again, with the now-familiar “Hillary 
lied” narrative.

Cue shouts of “lock her up, lock her up!”Trump is in the house and on stage 
imminently, and the auditorium is now full.

 
Watch it live here:
 
Few of the Trump supporters The Guardian spoke to on their way in to tonight’s 
rally in downtown Miami had much time for today’s developments in the “birther” 
controversy.

“It’s a distraction to what we should be talking about,” said Michael 
Rodriguez, 34, a Cuban-American restaurant worker who lives in Little Havana. 
“This election is about jobs, the economy, immigration and America being strong 
again.”

Janusz Biskupek, 50, of Boca Raton, cut a striking figure in a pristine white 
suit emblazoned with pro-Trump slogans. “Trump is a smart guy. I want my 
president to be respected,” he said. “Obama? He went to Cuba and nobody waited 
on him. We need a stronger president. We needDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.”

The arena at the James L Knight centre, however, was filling up slowly, with 
plenty of room still in the bleachers with Trump scheduled on stage in less 
than half an hour. Perhaps the rival attraction of a Friday night Kanye West 
concert a stone’s thrown away was more of a draw.
 
The choice for president is “excruciatingly clear”, First Lady Michelle Obama 
said during her campaign trail debut, urging the college audience to support
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> this 
November.

Obama cast the election as a choice between “one of the most qualified people 
who has ever endeavored to become president” and someone who doesn’t “take the 
job seriously”. Ticking off a list of accomplishments of her husband’s 
administration, Obama argued that with the past eight years as a guide, Trump 
is neither prepared nor qualified to be president.

“A candidate is not going to suddenly change when they get into office – it’s 
the opposite,” Obama told the crowd of mostly students and young people at 
George Mason University in Virginia. “In fact, because the minute that 
individual takes that oath, they are under the hottest, harshest light there 
is.”

She referenced her moving speech at the Democratic National Convention, “when 
they go low, we go high,” going after the Republican nominee without mentioning 
his name.

“Being president isn’t anything like reality TV,” she said, drawing loud 
cheers and applause.

Obama recalled the 2008 campaign, reminding the audience that raising 
questions about a president’s experience, qualifications and judgments is all 
part of a very public vetting process to be president.

“And then there were those who questioned and continued to question for the 
past eight years and to this day whether my husband was even born in this 
country,” she said, alluding to the Republican nominee without mentioning him 
by name.

Trump helped fan the flames of birtherism, a conspiracy theory that President 
Obama was not born in the US but in Kenya, and used the issue to help propel 
his political ambitions.

Facing dismal approval ratings among minority voters, Trump admitted on Friday 
morning for the first time that Barack Obama was born in the US.

Obama is a powerful and popular ally for Clinton, especially among young 
voters. New polling shows that millennials, disappointed by their options for 
president have turned toward third-party candidates.

The First Lady’s appearance on a college campus in the battleground state of 
Virginia, the First Lady’s event is part of a broader push by the Clinton 
campaign to win back some of the millennial voters who have strayed in recent 
weeks. Next week, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic 
challenger whose campaign was powered by young people and students, will 
campaign for Clinton in the coming days.

“Elections aren’t just about who votes but who doesn’t vote,” she said, 
imploring the young people in the crowd to support Clinton. She encouraged them 
to fight the urge to want to “hide under the bed” and avoid the election 
altogether. She also addressed a complaint many young people who felt inspired 
by Sander’s underdog campaign have leveled at Clinton.

“I hear folks saying they don’t feel inspired in this election,” Obama said. 
“Well let me tell you, I disagree. I am inspired. Because for eight years, I’ve 
had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job, and here is 
what I absolutely know for sure. Listen to this: Right now we have an 
opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored 
to become president.”

Perhaps above all, the campaign event was a testament to Obama’s enduring 
popularity.

“It is so hard to believe that it is less than 2 months until election and 
that my family is almost at the end of term,” Obama said. The crowd broke into 
a raucous round of chanting: “Four more years” chant. “No,” Obama protested, 
waving her hand at the crowd as the chant continued. “No!”

“I promise you,” she said, “Barack and I will continue to work for you for the 
rest of our lives.”
 
Donald Trump’s campaign is attempting to prove the false allegation that 
Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign ignited the birther rumors about 
then-opponent Barack Obama’s citizenship with an interview transcript from a 
CNN phoner with Clinton’s former campaign manager.

The transcript falls short of this claim

PATTI SOLIS DOYLE: There was a volunteer coordinator, I believe in late 2007, 
I think in December, one of our volunteer coordinators in one of the counties 
in Iowa. I don’t recall whether they an actual paid staffer, but they did 
forward an e-mail that promoted the conspiracy.

WOLF BLITZER: The birther conspiracy?

DOYLE: Yeah. Hillary made the decision immediately to let that person go. We 
let that person go.

The whole thread is worth a gander.
 
Bellicose bloviator Rush Limbaugh made a major concession this afternoon, 
telling listeners that Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is not, in fact, a 
conservative.

“Can somebody point to me the conservative on the ballot?” Limbaugh asked his 
listeners this afternoon. 
<http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2016/09/15/we_re_beyond_ideology_folks> 
“‘What do you mean, Rush? Are you admitting Trump is not a conservative?’ Damn 
right I am!” he thundered.

“Folks, when did I ever say that he was? Look, I don’t know how to tell you 
this. Conservatism lost, in the primary, if that’s how you want to look at it. 
We had Cruz; we had Rubio.”

Limbaugh sounded uncharacteristically defeated in the segment, expressing 
frustration with the nomination of Republicans who are not conservative enough.

“Even what we’ve seen now, we haven’t seen anything,” Limbaugh said. “But the 
establishment’s gonna come together to protect themselves regardless of 
ideology. I wish conservatism was on the ballot.”
 
Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson has reacted to the Commission on 
Presidential Debates’ announcement that onlyHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Donald Trump will be 
invited to the first debate of the general-election campaign with frustration, 
but not with surprise.

“I would say I am surprised that the CPD has chosen to exclude me from the 
first debate, but I’m not,” Johnson said in a statement. “After all, the 
commission is a private organization created 30 years ago by the Republican and 
Democratic parties for the clear purpose of taking control of the only 
nationally-televised presidential debates voters will see. At the time of its 
creation, the leaders of those two parties made no effort to hide the fact that 
they didn’t want any third party intrusions into their shows.”

“The CPD may scoff at a ticket that enjoys ‘only’ 9 or 10% in their 
hand-selected polls, but even 9% represents 13 million voters, more than the 
total population of Ohio and most other states. Yet, the Republicans and 
Democrats are choosing to silence the candidate preferred by those millions of 
Americans.”

“It is unfortunate that the CPD doesn’t believe such a voice should be heard. 
There are more polls and more debates, and we plan to be on the debate stage in 
October.”

 
It’s official: Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump will be the only candidates to appear on the 
stage at the first presidential debate of the general-election campaign, after 
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party nominee Jill Stein failed to 
reach the polling threshold necessary to merit an invitation.

The Commission on Presidential Debates released a statement officially 
declaring that Clinton, Trump and their running mates will be the only people 
to appear in the first two debates:

The Board determined that the polling averages called for... are as follows: 
Hillary Clinton (43%), Donald Trump (40.4%), Gary Johnson (8.4%) and Jill Stein 
(3.2%). Accordingly, Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, andDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and his running mate, 
Mike Pence, qualify to participate in the September 26 presidential debate and 
the October 4 vice-presidential debate, respectively. No other candidates 
satisfied the criteria for inclusion.

The composition of the final two presidential debates will be decided upon 
polling in the future.

Ben Carson, whose campaign used money raised in the name of the lord to pay 
political consultants for – what? – and who believes that Putin, Khameni and 
Abbas used the pyramids to store guns with which Jews could have prevented the 
Holocaust, or something, has launched an “ideas forum”:

The web site of the person who runs Trump’s campaign thinks it’s funny that 
Trump announces news conferences he doesn’t hold and seems to find Trump’s 
sudden reversal on the question of Barack Obama’s native birth funny, too. 
Harmless at least. Or funny in its harmfulness? And for some reason this 
Breitbart post includes a picture of Harambe the gorilla.

The person who runs this web site is currently running Donald Trump’s 
presidential campaign:
