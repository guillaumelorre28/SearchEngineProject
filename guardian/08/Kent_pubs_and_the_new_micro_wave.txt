You will find them in former dog grooming parlours, bakeries, butcher shops: 
tiny little hostelries have been springing up all across eastern Kent. These 
“micropubs” adhere to a few simple rules – no lager, no jukebox, no TV – and 
are almost all housed in spaces no larger than a living room. They sell 
constantly changing real ales at around £3 a pint; there’s no hot food but you 
may find local cheeses, pies and homemade pork scratchings and pickles.

As this micropub scene has burgeoned over the past two years, ale lovers can 
be spotted clutching hand-marked maps and hopping around on a beer-swilling 
tour of these freehouses – all easily linked by public transport. Some are in 
tiny alleys, small villages, or the outer reaches of seaside towns; others are 
just a few steps away from the sea and becoming places of pilgrimage not just 
for beardy Camra types, but for people seeking craft beer and conversation.

Many of these little pubs have a salty seadog air, with nautical decor, others 
are rustically simple, and some embrace “car boot chic”. All celebrate localism 
and Kentish beers.

The first British micropub opened its doors in east Kent after a change in the 
licensing laws in 2005, which made selling alcohol much simpler. TheButcher’s 
Arms <http://www.micropub.co.uk/> near Herne Bay led the way, showing what 
could be done with a small room, an ale-loving landlord and a back-to-basics 
desire for conviviality and community.

Five years later, another micropub opened, and in the past two years there has 
been an explosion of similar watering holes up and down the Kent coast. While 
pubs around them close, these little freehouses survive because they have low 
overheads, rents are cheap and staffing costs small. They don’t pay music 
licenses and they keep shorter opening hours.

Some of the pubs also sell cider, usually from Kent makers such as Biddenden 
or Kentish Pip, and English wines. Many offer beers in small, third-of-a-pint 
glasses so an enthusiast can try a few at each pitstop. And most welcome dogs. 
All abide by two basic rules: keep it small, and keep it simple.

 Martyn Hillier at the Butcher’s Arms 
Now a place of pilgrimage and inspiration, the Butcher’s Arms was established 
by Martyn Hillier in 2005 when he opened for business in the three-metre by 
four-metre front room of a former butcher’s shop. “I am not beholden to the big 
breweries,” says Hillier. “It’s me and the beer producers, and the only people 
I have to listen to are my customers, who tell me what they want to drink. It’s 
so small people have to talk to each other. It has brought the whole village 
back together again, and been copied across the country.”

Alan Ross, a former fish and chip shop owner, has stocked 300 ales since he 
opened The Wheel Alehouse in March 2013. He has decorated the former shop unit 
with a nautical theme. The name, he explains, comes from a joke in Only Fools 
and Horses, where a singer has a speech impediment. “Wheel ale,” he laughs. 
“Get it?” Ross, “the captain”, is joined behind the bar by his dog, Bosun. 
“People tell me they have got what they always wanted – a place to come and 
talk. With proper beer.”

Decorated in kitchenalia, with old cake recipes pasted on one wall, the Bake 
and Ale House is housed in the shop section of a former bakery. Owner Pete 
Williams opened three years ago having initially moved to Kent to open a B&B. 
“I used to manage community centres for local government. This is not really 
different, except there are no under-fives and no teenagers.” He has stocked 
more than 30 beers and his list can include Golden Braid fromHopdaemon 
<http://www.hopdaemon.com/> in Newnham, and Copper Top from Old Dairy 
<http://olddairybrewery.com/the-brewery/> in Tenterden. Pete describes the 
micropub phenomenon as “a really positive thing. It certainly gives people who 
look for different ales a choice, and it provides a community service.”

Ales of the Unexpected, Westbrook

The newest micropub in the Thanet area opened in August 2013 in a former 
fishmongers in Westbrook, opposite the old Seabathing Hospital. Carl Hilliard, 
a former HGV driver, grins when he talks about his career change. A lifelong 
ale lover, he says: “The whole idea is to have people engage in conversation. 
The thing with pubs these days is there are too many unnecessary distractions – 
fruit machines, TV. We’re going back to how pubs were. It’s my social life – I 
love to talk to people and I love real ale. It’s win-win for me.”

The Harbour Arms, as the name suggests, sits on Margate’s old stone harbour, 
having been carved out of two old fishermen’s sheds knocked into one small 
room. With tables spilling outside and one of the best views of any of the 
micropubs, it often has live piano music and a singalong going on. Carole Lane 
opened it in May 2013. “It’s great to have a business where you are socialising 
all the time. I have been surprised by the age range of people who come – it’s 
not just the old woolly jumper brigade.”

brewery Gadds’ and others. There are regular open mic nights, jazz evenings and

This place’s puntastic name is a homage to The Two Ronnies, whose sketch, in 
which Ronnie Barker walks into a hardware store and asks for “fork ’andles”, is 
said to have been inspired by Broadstairs shop Harrington’s. Inside, the 
sawdust-floored pub, the upturned metal bucket lightshades and crossed 
pitchfork handles, hammer the joke home. A quote from an anonymous author 
painted above the door lintel by owner Mike Beaumon could be the micropub 
motto: “Beer is the drink of men who think, and feel no fear or fetter, who do 
not drink to senseless sink, but drink to feel better.”

The Thirty-Nine Steps Alehouse, Broadstairs 

A few streets back from the Broadstairs seafront, this pub in a former pet 
shop was opened by local couple Kevin and Nicola Harding. The alehouse takes 
its name from John Buchan’s 1915 novel, which was written and partly based in 
Broadstairs. It serves a minimum of three real ales, sometimes five, including 
a pale “session” bitter and a slightly stronger “best” bitter.

The Hovelling Boat Inn, Ramsgate

The Hovelling Boat, which recently celebrated its first birthday, was named 
after a pub that existed on the site until 1909. Before Paul Spickett 
(previously in the building trade) converted it, it had been a fancy goods shop 
then lay empty for some time. Again slightly larger than micro, it also offers 
teas, coffees, wine and spirits and has a petanque area out the back. “It’s an 
old new concept,” says Spickett. “We are turning everything back to basics, 
back to the way it was when it was a pub over 100 years ago.”

The Conqueror Alehouse, Ramsgate

Named after a two-funnelled paddle steamer that plied the route from Ramsgate 
to France at the beginning of the 20th century, the Conqueror’s walls are 
covered in black and white photos of the ship and its crew. Colin Aris opened 
his doors, in a former florist’s shop, in March 2010. He usually has three 
Kentish ales on offer but admits he sometimes slip the odd “foreign” ale in for 
variety.
