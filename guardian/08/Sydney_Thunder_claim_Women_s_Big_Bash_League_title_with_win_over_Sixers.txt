Thunder were cruising at 2-99 in the 18th over but lost five quick wickets, 
before Lauren Cheatle and Claire Koski scrambled through for the winning runs 
off an Ellyse Perry wide.

Rachael Haynes top-scored for Thunder with 37 off 50 balls, while Erin Osborne 
was the best of Thunder’s bowlers, with her 3-21 earning her 
player-of-the-final honours.

Sixers carried the momentum of a nine-match winning streak into the final and 
came agonisingly close to making it 10 in a row against Thunder, who finished 
on top of the WBBL ladder.

Sixers’ innings didn’t start well. Skipper Perry fell cheaply – out for eight 
runs from 13 balls – and her side lost wickets regularly in the face of some 
quality bowling.

Batting at No8, Angela Reakes top-scored for Sixers with 23 from 18 balls.

While Osborne was the pick of the Thunder attack, Maisy Gibson (2-21) and Rene 
Farrell (2-22) were also important.

Meanwhile, Melbourne Stars skipper Meg Lanning was named the WBBL player of 
the tournament.

She was the highest scorer of WBBL01, making 560 runs off 492 balls, including 
a high score of 90.
