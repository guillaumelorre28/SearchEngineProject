Backyard, Hoboken, Summer

The sun beating on his brain
And a cat slouching on the woodpile
And flies nauseous with heat

He holds three eternal parameters
The habit of his eye repeats
The shapes he reifies

Let the silence silence its own ache

There is nothing but the plenum of a small red brain


The flies fall suppurant among the sticks
The cat prepares for life

As though the moveable could move
Even the impossible recedes

As though within the clot of brain
Were space or sun to make a world

This week’s poem by Alvin Feinman (1929-2008) 
<https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2008/07/in-memoriam-alvin-feinman-1929-2008/>
 is as packed with ideas as images. It’s as if concepts from organic chemistry 
were compressed into a Dutch genre painting depicting a scuzzy backyard in 
industrial New Jersey. Feinman’s awareness of the systems underlying observable 
phenomena is striking: he selects and deploys his images brilliantly, but the 
poem is often more structuralist than imagist.


 It’s one of a batch of 39 previously unpublished poems written during the 
1950s and now included inCorrupted into Song: The Complete Poems of Alvin 
Feinman <http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10686.html>. It’s a riveting 
collection by a poet who deserves to be better known. The problem is that 
Feinman published very little during his life: there was Preambles and Other 
Poems (OUP, 1964), which was then published with revisions as Poems by 
Princeton in 1990. The rest was a pointed silence.

 All the newly published poems are those of a young man, but they are in no 
way beginner’s pieces. Usefully for the new reader, they clarify some of 
Feinman’s preoccupations and affinities. He was never a Beat or a confessional 
poet: his early mentors were Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens. James Geary, 
editor of the previously unseen section of the book, and one-time student of 
Feinman, recalls that the Brooklyn-born college lecturer came from a long line 
ofLitvak <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Jews> Talmudic scholars. 
When he taught Milton, he approached the work as sacred text.

 Regarding his own poetry, Feinman was deeply humble, and even distrustful. 
The world might have been the problem, rather than the unreliable ways of 
words. The poem preceding Backyard, Hoboken, Summer is called Lament for the 
Coming of Spring, and coins the grimly memorable phrase, “helic hate”. 
Feinman’s “songs” are unconsoling and some seem inconsolable.

 This week’s poem begins: “The sun beating on his brain.” This “beating” may 
be creatively enriching; it’s certainly more benign than helic hate. “Brain” 
occurs three times in the poem, almost like a form of linguistic punctuation 
(there’s no conventional punctuation). Sun, cat, woodpile and flies surround 
this unnervingly exposed brain, the life cycles resembling aYeatsian gyre

 Yeats was important to Feinman. He’s present not only in the copper-fastened 
craft but in the way Feinman turns a beggared space into a repository of the 
more-than-temporal. It’s also possible that Feinman is following up a strand of 
Yeatsian mysticism with the puzzling assertion, “He holds three eternal 
parameters”. Could this be a reference to the Hindu concept ofthe Three Gunas 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu%E1%B9%87a>? 

The same phrase is used by Dr S S Bhatti 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qMhwx6BTwQcC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=what+are+the+three+eternal+parameters?&source=bl&ots=XIjKw2a7PB&sig=i0TeyhJb1LkT5FW4oNSeO6i51UA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiW-5ya-rjOAhUsDsAKHcNGAqsQ6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&q=what%20are%20the%20three%20eternal%20parameters%3F&f=false>
, referring to the three architectural principles of the cosmos, Brahma 
(creation), Vishnu (sustenance) and Mahesh (destruction).

Alvin’s sun, cat, man, woodpile and flies may represent these qualities, or 
partake of their symbolism to some degree: the human brain embodies (“holds”) 
them all.

 But Feinman moves quickly on from his parameters to matters of perception: 
“The habit of his eye repeats / The shapes he reifies.” The possessive pronoun 
here could refer to the cat but more probably refers to the protagonist 
summoned at the poem’s start. We know that the images we see enter the retina 
in two dimensions, but are “translated” into three by the brain. If this is 
what “the habit of his eye” and the “shapes he reifies” allude to, perhaps the 
“eternal parameters” triplicate foreshadows the three dimensions.

 The thought may be structuralist but the sounds are sensuous: we can hear the 
flies buzzing in the word “nauseous”, though it seems a transferred epithet: 
flies vomit as part of their digestive process and it’s not very likely that 
hot weather makes them feel sick. These lines have a dense murmur and dazzle 
like that of the hot backyard.

 The next two lines are isolated and fill the space around them with sombre, 
or at least fatalistic, portent. There’s a striking contrast between “silence” 
(a kind of negative image, a whiteness, with the power of salving “its own 
ache”) and “the plenum of a small red brain”. The blood-suffused brain-colour 
is significant, connecting intelligence to what is “red in tooth and claw”. 
Perhaps, too, because the brain is seen asa plenum 
<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plenum>, the poem is telling us that 
there’s no way out of our own perception. The brain fits flush to the skull. 
Consciousness is basically organic structure and scarily inescapable.

 Decay is inherent in all this sun-bred life. The woodpile declines to 
“sticks”, the flies, since they “fall suppurant”, must have succumbed to swat 
or insecticide or natural death. Meanwhile the cat, stirred from its 
“slouching” doze, is ready for some action. The sensed distinction between 
cosmic, perhaps God-like creation using space and time, and the small mammalian 
attempt, which is the product of illusory mental freedom, and merely 
reproductive, seems to drag the poem back as it heaves itself towards a 
positive conclusion. The penultimate stanza (the most difficult two lines in a 
difficult poem) imagine, I think, free will and limitless action, almost 
conceive them as possibilities. But the optimism is scarred, and will be deeply 
qualified by that repeated “as though”. The glittering fact remains: the poem’s 
sonnet-size contains all the space and sun required for Feinman to shape and 
“make a world”.
