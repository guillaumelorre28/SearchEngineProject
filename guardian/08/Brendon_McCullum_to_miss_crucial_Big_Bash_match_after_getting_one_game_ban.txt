team’s slow over rate.

It means the second-placed Heat will be without their two biggest weapons – 
McCullum and Chris Lynn, who is with the Australian ODI side – for Tuesday’s 
crucial game against the Melbourne Stars.

Queensland Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> chief executive 
Max Walters said it was disappointing to lose the former New Zealand Test 
captain given how well fans have received the Heat’s exciting and attacking 
brand of play.

However, after reviewing the match, the Heat determined there were no grounds 
for an appeal and accepted the penalty.

“It is a shame but we accept those are the competition rules we are playing 
under and reminds us that we can continue to improve in all facets of the 
game,” Walters said.

Joe Burns will step in as captain while McCullum serves his ban, which was 
handed down on Thursday for a second breach of the playing conditions this 
season.

Each member of the Heat team has also been fined $500.

The side initially had to pay $1,000 a player but that was downgraded because 
they didn’t appeal the penalty.

It came after the Heat were six minutes behind the scheduled time to complete 
their 20 overs during Wednesday night’s Gabba loss to the Perth Scorchers, 
which allowed the Scorchers to supplant them atop the BBL ladder.
