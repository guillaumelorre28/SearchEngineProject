Stumps – India lead by 51

141st over: India 451-7 (Kohli 147, Jayant 30) Final over of the day and 
England’s best bowler, Joe Root, is on to see if he can work his magic one more 
time. Kohli chips his first ball out towards mid-on, prompting the most 
optimistic cry of “catch” you’ll hear, then cuts the third out to point for a 
single. Jayant sees off the final three balls and that’s the end of another 
very poor day for England in the field.

It’s been Virat Kohli’s day though: the Indian captain coming to the crease 
when Pujara was out second ball of the day and he is still there, 147 runs 
later at the close and with his team the only one likely to win this match now. 
England can look at dropped catches and wasted reviews and wonder what might 
have been, for all the good that it will do them. Do join us tomorrow to see 
just how bad this can get for Alastair Cook and co.

Cheers for reading. Bye!

Rotated bowlers more! Taken the new ball & have a spinner bowl with it! India 
right back in this game now cos of poor captaincy!https://t.co/Q9uhk5B3z8

140th over: India 450-7 (Kohli 146, Jayant 30) Rashid continues, despite the 
fact he is patently shattered. His length is all over the shop here and he’s 
probably lucky to get away with leaking just four singles, the last of which 
takes India’s lead to 50.

139th over: India 446-7 (Kohli 144, Jayant 28) Four overs to go tonight and I 
can’t imagine England will want to bowl many more before the close with these 
two in this kind of nick: they’ve scored 46 in the last 10 overs. There is a 
huge shout for caught behind off Jayant and Cook begins the signal for a 
review, only to realise he doesn’t have any left and folds his arms instead. 
You’re not getting away with that one Alastair. Unlike Jayant, who actually got 
a massive inside edge down the leg-side. That’s a shame for Bairstow, who took 
it very well. Kohli, for what it’s worth, finds the whole thing hilarious.

138th over: India 445-7 (Kohli 143, Jayant 28) Another over, another boundary, 
2,000 runs as India captain and an average now in the 50s for Virat Kohli: he 
walks down the track and demolishes a full-ish ball over long-on for four more. 
He was dropped on 60-odd.

137th over: India 440-7 (Kohli 138, Jayant 28) England have, to give them due 
credit, bowled far better today than they did yesterday – not that that’s 
saying much. India and Kohli, who takes a single from this over, have batted 
magnificently though while England’s drops have only gone part way towards 
sending this match slipping from their grasp. Jayant drives the final ball of 
the over against the spin and through extra cover, out the middle of the bat 
and away for four more. 76 now, the partnership.

135th over: India 429-7 (Kohli 136, Jayant 19) When it’s India’s day, it’s 
India’s day: the new bowler Moeen does for Jayant with a nicely flighted 
delivery only to see it fly off the inside edge and down to fine leg for four. 
More convincing next up from the batsman, who drives through cover for a couple 
more then chops to backward point for a single. One of Kohli’s runs appears to 
have been reduced to a leg-bye.

134th over: India 422-7 (Kohli 136, Jayant 12) That England’s best bowler in 
this innings has been Joe Root, and that he only got wickets when bringing 
himself on while Cook was off the field, probably tells you that England are 
not going to win this match. India lead by 22.

133rd over: India 420-7 (Kohli 136, Jayant 11) We have 10 overs to squeeze 
into the remaining 34 minutes of the day, so we’ll go into the extra half-hour 
tonight. Strange, really, given how England have underbowled their seamers. 
Four singles off the over – incidentally this is India’s fourth 50-plus 
partnership out of eight; England managed three all innings.

132nd over: India 417-7 (Kohli 134, Jayant 9) First ball of the over Anderson 
wastes England’s final review. Bairstow didn’t look remotely interested in the 
appeal and, as a rule of thumb, you should probably see what Bairstow thinks 
when it comes to reviewing. A single later and Kohli delights in cracking a 
full one off his ankles and through square-leg for four. A deliberate top-edge 
down to third man, which reaches the fielder on the bounce, brings one more.

Review!

Anderson thinks that Jayant has feathered one, pushing at a full-ish ball 
outside off. I can tell you now he hasn’t.

131st over: India 411-7 (Kohli 129, Jayant 8) Chris Woakes, the Henrikh 
Mkhitaryan to Alastair Cook’s José Mourinho, shares the new ball and 
immediately hits Kohli on the pad with a straight one, but the batsman had 
whacked the leather off it. Four more to the man some people actually said 
wasn’t suited to Test cricket, pure timing with a checked drive past mid-off. 
Two off the final ball take India to 411.

New ball taken

130th over: India 405-7 (Kohli 123, Jayant 8) Rashid’s spell comes to an end 
after 28 overs; here’s Jimmy. And, after two deliveries, he gets the new ball! 
He gets a touch of away swing for all of three deliveries, before Kohli knocks 
it from off to deep midwicket for a single. Sky give us a montage of England’s 
missed chances in this innings and then, off the last ball, an inspired Joe Root
drops an absolute dolly off Jayant at second slip.

129th over: India 404-7 (Kohli 122, Jayant 8) Sometimes I do wonder if the 
Indian commentators are a touch sycophantic towards Kohli: “If he had hit that 
you would have to call him a genius” the commentator said in the previous over 
when he missed a pull shot. He just missed the ball. Anyway, he clips past 
midwicket here for the two runs thattake India into the lead.

128th over: India 399-7 (Kohli 119, Jayant 6) Eight runs from the first two 
balls: four to Kohli and four to extras. The first ball bounced sharply and 
beat everything and everyone, then the second, fuller, was driven hard through 
wide mid-on. Oh and then an edge! Kohli chases a wide one and gets a thick edge 
while driving, but the ball flies wide of Stokes and down to third man for 
three. That’sdrinks.

127th over: India 388-7 (Kohli 112, Jayant 6) After Kohli takes a first-ball 
single, Moeen goes round the wicket and the fielders converge around Jayant. 
His defence is solid though. “Get Root on!” suggests Copestake. Whoever, just 
take the new ball.

he nearly gets a wicket from the last ball of it: Jayant’s edge not carrying to 
slip where Stokes saved runs with a good stop, diving to his right.

125th over: India 387-7 (Kohli 111, Jayant 6) Poor Chris Woakes: he gets his 
first bowl in 23 hours and is replaced by Moeen after one over. Kohli picks up 
the only two runs of the over with a drive out to cover. He’s on Nelson, though 
I can’t imagine he’ll feel particularly cursed.

124th over: India 385-7 (Kohli 109, Jayant 6) Narendra Hirwani begins to 
shuffle uncomfortably as Rashid goes into the 26th over of his spell. The final 
ball brings Jayant forward and swoops past the outside edge, but other than 
that it’s a fairly uneventful one.

123rd over: India 385-7 (Kohli 109, Jayant 6) Chris Woakes gets a bowl for the 
first time since 4pm local time yesterday. Slightly confusingly, the scoreboard 
says he is “Replacing Ball”, but he is using the same ball. All clear? Good. 
Jayant gets three with a gloriously timed push back past the bowler, which 
Rashid chases down and reels in. He must be shattered. Woakes is wided on 
height off the last ball and, to rub it in, Kohli guides the extra ball behind 
pointagain for four.

Simon McMahon is back: “The rugby in South Africa that Paul Mitchell is now 
watching looks not too bad either. Mind you, it’s 8 degrees in Scotland today, 
and United are playing Ayr later. I know where I’d rather be.” As a Northampton 
fan, I’d rather you didn’t talk rugby around these parts after last night’s 
b******t.

122nd over: India 376-7 (Kohli 104, Jayant 3) The lesser spotted Chris Woakes 
is warming up. In the meantime Rashid has a huge shout for lbw and persuades 
Alastair Cook to go for the review – with the help of Jonny Bairstow – but no 
dice this time. A failed-review-maiden.

Not out!

It’s definitely pad first and pitched in line with middle and leg. It was a 
leg-break doing too much though and Hawkeye says it was missing off.

Review: Jayant lbw

Given not out, assuming it pitched outside leg as that’s very close otherwise.

Virat Kohli 100*

121st over: India 376-7 (Kohli 104, Jayant 3) There we go, Kohli drives hard 
to cover, where the diving fielder can only parry it and through he goes for 
his 15th Test century. He celebrates wildly and well he might – this has been a 
brilliant innings that has kept England at bay every time they get a sniff of 
an advantage. He has 1,065 Test runs in 2016 at 76 and he adds four more to 
that aggregate by dismissing a wide ball through point for four more.

120th over: India 369-7 (Kohli 99, Jayant 2) Back over the wicket from Rashid 
to Kohli, who clips out to deep midwicket and hares off hoping he’ll have time 
for a second. There’s no way he’s going to take any chances against Buttler’s 
arm though, so on 99 he remains. Jayant gets off the mark with a back-foot 
punch through cover for two so Kohli will be on strike for the next over.

My post-xmas team lunch hangover is not helped by Adil's drop of Kohli 
@DanLucas86 <https://twitter.com/DanLucas86>. We can't really risk a lead of 
50+. The fear is here.

119th over: India 366-7 (Kohli 98, Jayant 0) The all-rounders keep coming: 
Jayant Yadav is the new batsman. Anyone want to nominate a match for featuring 
the most genuine all-rounders? This one must be up there – everyone in the 
India team and, I think, nine of the England team have First Class hundreds 
after all. Another maiden from Ball, who has been the driest of dry bowlers.

118th over: India 366-7 (Kohli 98, Jayant 0) Adil Rashid’s first three spells 
were five overs, five overs and three overs in length. This fourth spell is now 
into its 23rd. I’ll leave out everything I was going to say about him looking 
like a tired net bowler now, because he’s only gone and got his second wicket 
with the penultimate ball! Kohli punches the final ball to midwicket for a 
couple more.

Wicket! Jadeja c Buttler b Rashid 25

Jadeja goes for the big hit but loses control of the bat. Up, up, up it goes 
and Jos Buttler is around from mid-on when it comes down.

116th over: India 361-6 (Kohli 94, Jadeja 24) Up comes the 50 partnership from 
just 66 balls when Kohli cuts behind point for two, with Jennings saving a 
couple with a good dive. We can consider India’s second-session wobble well and 
truly dealt with, I reckon. Kohli adds four more with another cut behind point. 
You have a new ball available if you want it, Alastair.

115th over: India 355-6 (Kohli 88, Jadeja 24) Ball continues with the old ball 
and, though he’s getting a bit of reverse swing out there for the first time in 
the match, it’s not really moving late enough to trouble Jadeja. On the telly, 
the attendance is announced as 19,444, which is great to see.

Rather spookily, as I was writing that last sentence, the following email from 
Simon McMahon appeared: “Ever been to India, Dan? Looks a great place to watch 
cricket. But then, where isn’t a great place to watch cricket?” Alas I have not.

114th over: India 355-6 (Kohli 88, Jadeja 24) Second ball after tea Jennings 
drops a very tough chance, low to his right at short-leg, off Jadeja. No need 
to check whether that one came off the helmet, eh Ravi Ashwin? They take one, 
then Kohli brings up the 350 to great adulation with a drive out to wide mid-on 
for one. Another single, then an imperious pull through midwicket for four to 
finish. Too short, that, Rash.

Tea

113th over: India 348-6 (Kohli 83, Jadeja 22) Something new but it’s Jake, 
rather than new, Ball. His first ball reverses back in and strikes Kohli on the 
pad, prompting a strong appeal, but it looks like he’s got an inside edge on 
that even if Botham isn’t convinced. Two singles from the over and that’s tea, 
withIndia trailing by 52. See you in 15 or so.

112th over: India 346-6 (Kohli 82, Jadeja 21) Er, it’s just been pointed out 
that I might have, in my excitement, said Root was c Bairstow b Root in the 
109th over. Refresh the page and that’s been corrected now. Thanks, mum, for 
pointing that out. Two singles from this over; maybe a quick go with the new 
ball before tea in five minutes?

110th over: India 337-6 (Kohli 80, Jadeja 14) Things have calmed down just a 
touch now, although Kohli still looks animated: he comes forward, opens his 
stance up and then gets down almost on his haunches to just dab into the 
off-side for a single – one of three in the over.

An offer from Paul Mitchell

“I’ll shortly be moving my OBO reading venue to Cape Town stadium where the 
latest world rugby sevens is on today. I find myself with 2 spare tickets, so 
if any OBO-ers are in town and would like them at face value then send me a 
mail.”

Drop me an email if you’re interested and I’ll send your details on, to save 
Paul Mitchell’s email being there for all and sundry to see.

109th over: India 334-6 (Kohli 79, Jadeja 12) A couple of overs ago, Ian 
Copetake wrote: “Talking of Germans, I hope Cook resists a night of the long 
knives and resists removing the FEC from this bowling/dress rehearsal.” And Ian 
– and the rest of us – are in luck as Root carries on into the fourth over of 
his spell. This is his seventh of the innings; Chris Woakes has bowled five.

108th over: India 330-6 (Kohli 77, Jadeja 10) More sweeping from Kohli and he 
gets one off the toe-end of the bat and down to fine-leg for his least elegant 
boundary so far. Just a single from the rest of the over as Jadeja, perhaps 
disgusted by Rashid’s rather filthy leg-stump line, declines to continue the 
fun.

“Morning Dan.” Morning, Simon McMahon. “England have two chances in this 
match, slim and none. And while Kohli’s still batting, slim has left town. 
Anyway, did Derek Smalls buy you a cocktail?” The way this is going now we’re 
looking at a result either way I reckon. And no, I just stuck to tea and fizzy 
water when Harry Shearer bought me lunch last week. Did I mention that happened?

107th over: India 325-6 (Kohli 72, Jadeja 10) Root continues. For some strange 
reason, Jadeja is not overwhelmed by fear and absolutely mullers the second 
ball over midwicket for six. Root then spins one nastily away from the outside 
edge and to slip via Bairstow’s chest; they appeal but it missed the bat by a 
fair old way. Oh and then he nearly gets him with the straight one!

Richard Woods writes on Patel: “He was honestly very unlucky today. A better 
player might have had the chance to play and miss or nearly get bowled. But he 
got out early to a part-time bowler, having contributed little to his team’s 
score and as result, his first ball escape notwithstanding, he lost the 
opportunity for getting a bit of good luck. I would love to see him play pretty 
much the same way in the second innings, and in between times give his yap a 
rest.”

106th over: India 319-6 (Kohli 72, Jadeja 4) Hello, a rare sweep shot from 
Virat Kohli. He looks pretty angry out there, slog sweeping hard off leg-stump 
and getting four then spanking one back at Rashid, whodrops the India captain 
moving to his left! Should have taken that and he nearly makes up for it by 
drifting one past the outside edge. The final ball is short and The Incredible 
Virat thwacks it hard through square-leg on the pull for another boundary. This 
is fun!

105th over: India 311-6 (Kohli 64, Jadeja 4) There hasn’t been a huge amount 
for England fans to cheer in this series, so do get stuck in. Root gets his 
second wicket in four balls and he’s not far away from a third in eight when 
Jadeja clips a clump just over the leaping bowler’s outstretched arm. Instead, 
it’s four runs.

Yes he's out!

That wasn’t even close to the helmet – the ball nestled firmly in Jennings’ 
midriff. Quite what Ashwin was hanging around for I’ve no idea.

Review! Ashwin c Jennings b Root 0

Oh my. Ashwin has flicked this to short-leg, where Jennings has taken a very 
sharp catch. They’re checking to see if it hit the batsman’s helmet though.

104th over: India 307-5 (Kohli 64, Ashwin 0) We should probably give Bairstow 
greater credit for that catch. I initially said Patel pushed at it but that’s 
wrong: he gave himself room and went for a big drive and the keeper barely had 
any time to react.
Nick Hoult (@NHoultCricket) 
Patel...slag off England's spinners and get out to an offie with a bowling 
average of 48.

103rd over: India 305-5 (Kohli 62, Ashwin 0) Cook goes off the field, Joe Root 
takes the captaincy and immediately brings himself into the attack. “Ooh there 
we go, that’s nice” says someone near the stump mic and I dearly hope that was 
Root too, because he’s got Patel with a beauty three balls later. India have 
lost three for 43 and that’s a wicket maiden. All hail Joe Root: he’s better 
than you.

Wicket! Patel c Bairstow b Root 15

Joe Root strikes! It’s a lovely ball, tossed up outside off and Mr Pot 
Stirrer’s luck is out: he drives at it and gets a thin edge through to 
Bairstow, who juggles it and takes a good catch at the second attempt.

102nd over: India 305-4 (Kohli 62, Patel 15) India are within double figures 
now, thanks to a single pushed to cover by Patel, a second nudged into the 
on-side by Kohli, a cut hammered out to point for two by the former and finally 
a flick to square leg for another one. Maybe John Starbuck was right in the 
previous over. Alastair Cook has forgotten the new ball is available, hasn’t he?

101st over: India 300-4 (Kohli 61, Patel 11) A short bit of rubbish from Moeen 
cordially invites Patel into double figures and the batsman gleefully accepts, 
pulling away an ugly shot to the midwicket boundary. He then adds a single to 
take India to 300.

“Good morning,” begins the ever-polite John Starbuck. “As we’re about halfway 
through the game, how do you reckon England’s chances? I know the recent stats 
are on their side, but you’d expect a bit of pace again by now if they are to 
run through India’s tail today.” Very, very slim, I reckon. I’d stick with 
these two for a few more overs yet, given Patel likes pace on the ball and that 
it’s spitting off the pitch, but Ashwin has been a right old pain in the 
backside to get out so far.

100th over: India 294-4 (Kohli 60, Patel 6)  Rashid to continue after drinks 
and Kohli, refreshed and reinvigorated after that break (or perhaps just, you 
know, Virat bloomin’ Kohli) gets into a bit of width and cuts the first ball 
beyond the despairing dive of the fielder coming round to backward point and 
away for four. A single to the very same fielder later, Patel drives through 
cover for a couple more. Rashid then has the big mouth  left-hander in a bit of 
trouble, twice tying him up in knots.

Hot off the presses.
 
141st over: India 451-7 (Kohli 147, Jayant 30) Final over of the day and 
England’s best bowler, Joe Root, is on to see if he can work his magic one more 
time. Kohli chips his first ball out towards mid-on, prompting the most 
optimistic cry of “catch” you’ll hear, then cuts the third out to point for a 
single. Jayant sees off the final three balls and that’s the end of another 
very poor day for England in the field.

It’s been Virat Kohli’s day though: the Indian captain coming to the crease 
when Pujara was out second ball of the day and he is still there, 147 runs 
later at the close and with his team the only one likely to win this match now. 
England can look at dropped catches and wasted reviews and wonder what might 
have been, for all the good that it will do them. Do join us tomorrow to see 
just how bad this can get for Alastair Cook and co.

Cheers for reading. Bye!

141st over: India 450-7 (Kohli 146, Jayant 30) Jayant wants a single off the 
final ball of this, the penultimate over. Ha ha ha ha ha no, says Kohli.
 
140th over: India 450-7 (Kohli 146, Jayant 30) Rashid continues, despite the 
fact he is patently shattered. His length is all over the shop here and he’s 
probably lucky to get away with leaking just four singles, the last of which 
takes India’s lead to 50.
 
139th over: India 446-7 (Kohli 144, Jayant 28) Four overs to go tonight and I 
can’t imagine England will want to bowl many more before the close with these 
two in this kind of nick: they’ve scored 46 in the last 10 overs. There is a 
huge shout for caught behind off Jayant and Cook begins the signal for a 
review, only to realise he doesn’t have any left and folds his arms instead. 
You’re not getting away with that one Alastair. Unlike Jayant, who actually got 
a massive inside edge down the leg-side. That’s a shame for Bairstow, who took 
it very well. Kohli, for what it’s worth, finds the whole thing hilarious.
 
138th over: India 445-7 (Kohli 143, Jayant 28) Another over, another boundary, 
2,000 runs as India captain and an average now in the 50s for Virat Kohli: he 
walks down the track and demolishes a full-ish ball over long-on for four more. 
He was dropped on 60-odd.

137th over: India 440-7 (Kohli 138, Jayant 28) England have, to give them due 
credit, bowled far better today than they did yesterday – not that that’s 
saying much. India and Kohli, who takes a single from this over, have batted 
magnificently though while England’s drops have only gone part way towards 
sending this match slipping from their grasp. Jayant drives the final ball of 
the over against the spin and through extra cover, out the middle of the bat 
and away for four more. 76 now, the partnership.
 
136th over: India 435-7 (Kohli 137, Jayant 24) Rashid is back on for Anderson 
and Yadav creams his third ball through extra-cover for four more – the 27th of 
the day. Six off the over.
 
135th over: India 429-7 (Kohli 136, Jayant 19) When it’s India’s day, it’s 
India’s day: the new bowler Moeen does for Jayant with a nicely flighted 
delivery only to see it fly off the inside edge and down to fine leg for four. 
More convincing next up from the batsman, who drives through cover for a couple 
more then chops to backward point for a single. One of Kohli’s runs appears to 
have been reduced to a leg-bye.
 
134th over: India 422-7 (Kohli 136, Jayant 12) That England’s best bowler in 
this innings has been Joe Root, and that he only got wickets when bringing 
himself on while Cook was off the field, probably tells you that England are 
not going to win this match. India lead by 22.
 
133rd over: India 420-7 (Kohli 136, Jayant 11) We have 10 overs to squeeze 
into the remaining 34 minutes of the day, so we’ll go into the extra half-hour 
tonight. Strange, really, given how England have underbowled their seamers. 
Four singles off the over – incidentally this is India’s fourth 50-plus 
partnership out of eight; England managed three all innings.
 
132nd over: India 417-7 (Kohli 134, Jayant 9) First ball of the over Anderson 
wastes England’s final review. Bairstow didn’t look remotely interested in the 
appeal and, as a rule of thumb, you should probably see what Bairstow thinks 
when it comes to reviewing. A single later and Kohli delights in cracking a 
full one off his ankles and through square-leg for four. A deliberate top-edge 
down to third man, which reaches the fielder on the bounce, brings one more.
 
He hasn’t.
 
Anderson thinks that Jayant has feathered one, pushing at a full-ish ball 
outside off. I can tell you now he hasn’t.
 
131st over: India 411-7 (Kohli 129, Jayant 8) Chris Woakes, the Henrikh 
Mkhitaryan to Alastair Cook’s José Mourinho, shares the new ball and 
immediately hits Kohli on the pad with a straight one, but the batsman had 
whacked the leather off it. Four more to the man some people actually said 
wasn’t suited to Test cricket, pure timing with a checked drive past mid-off. 
Two off the final ball take India to 411.
 
130th over: India 405-7 (Kohli 123, Jayant 8) Rashid’s spell comes to an end 
after 28 overs; here’s Jimmy. And, after two deliveries, he gets the new ball! 
He gets a touch of away swing for all of three deliveries, before Kohli knocks 
it from off to deep midwicket for a single. Sky give us a montage of England’s 
missed chances in this innings and then, off the last ball, an inspired Joe Root
drops an absolute dolly off Jayant at second slip.
 
129th over: India 404-7 (Kohli 122, Jayant 8) Sometimes I do wonder if the 
Indian commentators are a touch sycophantic towards Kohli: “If he had hit that 
you would have to call him a genius” the commentator said in the previous over 
when he missed a pull shot. He just missed the ball. Anyway, he clips past 
midwicket here for the two runs thattake India into the lead.
 
128th over: India 399-7 (Kohli 119, Jayant 6) Eight runs from the first two 
balls: four to Kohli and four to extras. The first ball bounced sharply and 
beat everything and everyone, then the second, fuller, was driven hard through 
wide mid-on. Oh and then an edge! Kohli chases a wide one and gets a thick edge 
while driving, but the ball flies wide of Stokes and down to third man for 
three. That’sdrinks.
 
127th over: India 388-7 (Kohli 112, Jayant 6) After Kohli takes a first-ball 
single, Moeen goes round the wicket and the fielders converge around Jayant. 
His defence is solid though. “Get Root on!” suggests Copestake. Whoever, just 
take the new ball.
 
126th over: India 387-7 (Kohli 111, Jayant 6) Another maiden from Rashid and 
he nearly gets a wicket from the last ball of it: Jayant’s edge not carrying to 
slip where Stokes saved runs with a good stop, diving to his right.
 
125th over: India 387-7 (Kohli 111, Jayant 6) Poor Chris Woakes: he gets his 
first bowl in 23 hours and is replaced by Moeen after one over. Kohli picks up 
the only two runs of the over with a drive out to cover. He’s on Nelson, though 
I can’t imagine he’ll feel particularly cursed.

124th over: India 385-7 (Kohli 109, Jayant 6) Narendra Hirwani begins to 
shuffle uncomfortably as Rashid goes into the 26th over of his spell. The final 
ball brings Jayant forward and swoops past the outside edge, but other than 
that it’s a fairly uneventful one.
 
123rd over: India 385-7 (Kohli 109, Jayant 6) Chris Woakes gets a bowl for the 
first time since 4pm local time yesterday. Slightly confusingly, the scoreboard 
says he is “Replacing Ball”, but he is using the same ball. All clear? Good. 
Jayant gets three with a gloriously timed push back past the bowler, which 
Rashid chases down and reels in. He must be shattered. Woakes is wided on 
height off the last ball and, to rub it in, Kohli guides the extra ball behind 
pointagain for four.

Simon McMahon is back: “The rugby in South Africa that Paul Mitchell is now 
watching looks not too bad either. Mind you, it’s 8 degrees in Scotland today, 
and United are playing Ayr later. I know where I’d rather be.” As a Northampton 
fan, I’d rather you didn’t talk rugby around these parts after last night’s 
b******t.
 
122nd over: India 376-7 (Kohli 104, Jayant 3) The lesser spotted Chris Woakes 
is warming up. In the meantime Rashid has a huge shout for lbw and persuades 
Alastair Cook to go for the review – with the help of Jonny Bairstow – but no 
dice this time. A failed-review-maiden.
 
It’s definitely pad first and pitched in line with middle and leg. It was a 
leg-break doing too much though and Hawkeye says it was missing off.
 
Given not out, assuming it pitched outside leg as that’s very close otherwise.
 
121st over: India 376-7 (Kohli 104, Jayant 3) There we go, Kohli drives hard 
to cover, where the diving fielder can only parry it and through he goes for 
his 15th Test century. He celebrates wildly and well he might – this has been a 
brilliant innings that has kept England at bay every time they get a sniff of 
an advantage. He has 1,065 Test runs in 2016 at 76 and he adds four more to 
that aggregate by dismissing a wide ball through point for four more.

120th over: India 369-7 (Kohli 99, Jayant 2) Back over the wicket from Rashid 
to Kohli, who clips out to deep midwicket and hares off hoping he’ll have time 
for a second. There’s no way he’s going to take any chances against Buttler’s 
arm though, so on 99 he remains. Jayant gets off the mark with a back-foot 
punch through cover for two so Kohli will be on strike for the next over.

119th over: India 366-7 (Kohli 98, Jayant 0) The all-rounders keep coming: 
Jayant Yadav is the new batsman. Anyone want to nominate a match for featuring 
the most genuine all-rounders? This one must be up there – everyone in the 
India team and, I think, nine of the England team have First Class hundreds 
after all. Another maiden from Ball, who has been the driest of dry bowlers.
 
118th over: India 366-7 (Kohli 98, Jayant 0) Adil Rashid’s first three spells 
were five overs, five overs and three overs in length. This fourth spell is now 
into its 23rd. I’ll leave out everything I was going to say about him looking 
like a tired net bowler now, because he’s only gone and got his second wicket 
with the penultimate ball! Kohli punches the final ball to midwicket for a 
couple more.
 
Jadeja goes for the big hit but loses control of the bat. Up, up, up it goes 
and Jos Buttler is around from mid-on when it comes down.
 
117th over: India 363-6 (Kohli 95, Jadeja 25) Virat Kohli passed 4,000 Test 
runs earlier in this innings. 500 of them have now come in this series.
 
116th over: India 361-6 (Kohli 94, Jadeja 24) Up comes the 50 partnership from 
just 66 balls when Kohli cuts behind point for two, with Jennings saving a 
couple with a good dive. We can consider India’s second-session wobble well and 
truly dealt with, I reckon. Kohli adds four more with another cut behind point. 
You have a new ball available if you want it, Alastair.
 
115th over: India 355-6 (Kohli 88, Jadeja 24) Ball continues with the old ball 
and, though he’s getting a bit of reverse swing out there for the first time in 
the match, it’s not really moving late enough to trouble Jadeja. On the telly, 
the attendance is announced as 19,444, which is great to see.

Rather spookily, as I was writing that last sentence, the following email from 
Simon McMahon appeared: “Ever been to India, Dan? Looks a great place to watch 
cricket. But then, where isn’t a great place to watch cricket?” Alas I have not.
 
114th over: India 355-6 (Kohli 88, Jadeja 24) Second ball after tea Jennings 
drops a very tough chance, low to his right at short-leg, off Jadeja. No need 
to check whether that one came off the helmet, eh Ravi Ashwin? They take one, 
then Kohli brings up the 350 to great adulation with a drive out to wide mid-on 
for one. Another single, then an imperious pull through midwicket for four to 
finish. Too short, that, Rash.
 
We’re back. Still no new ball, Rashid with the ball.

113th over: India 348-6 (Kohli 83, Jadeja 22) Something new but it’s Jake, 
rather than new, Ball. His first ball reverses back in and strikes Kohli on the 
pad, prompting a strong appeal, but it looks like he’s got an inside edge on 
that even if Botham isn’t convinced. Two singles from the over and that’s tea, 
withIndia trailing by 52. See you in 15 or so.
 
112th over: India 346-6 (Kohli 82, Jadeja 21) Er, it’s just been pointed out 
that I might have, in my excitement, said Root was c Bairstow b Root in the 
109th over. Refresh the page and that’s been corrected now. Thanks, mum, for 
pointing that out. Two singles from this over; maybe a quick go with the new 
ball before tea in five minutes?
 
111th over: India 344-6 (Kohli 81, Jadeja 20) Joe Root is off, Moeen Ali is 
on, round the wicket to Jadeja and his first ball is clubbed through mid-on for 
four brutal runs. In 33 minutes, England’s lead has gone from 100 down to 56.
 
110th over: India 337-6 (Kohli 80, Jadeja 14) Things have calmed down just a 
touch now, although Kohli still looks animated: he comes forward, opens his 
stance up and then gets down almost on his haunches to just dab into the 
off-side for a single – one of three in the over.

An offer from Paul Mitchell

“I’ll shortly be moving my OBO reading venue to Cape Town stadium where the 
latest world rugby sevens is on today. I find myself with 2 spare tickets, so 
if any OBO-ers are in town and would like them at face value then send me a 
mail.”

Drop me an email if you’re interested and I’ll send your details on, to save 
Paul Mitchell’s email being there for all and sundry to see.
 
109th over: India 334-6 (Kohli 79, Jadeja 12) A couple of overs ago, Ian 
Copetake wrote: “Talking of Germans, I hope Cook resists a night of the long 
knives and resists removing the FEC from this bowling/dress rehearsal.” And Ian 
– and the rest of us – are in luck as Root carries on into the fourth over of 
his spell. This is his seventh of the innings; Chris Woakes has bowled five.
 
108th over: India 330-6 (Kohli 77, Jadeja 10) More sweeping from Kohli and he 
gets one off the toe-end of the bat and down to fine-leg for his least elegant 
boundary so far. Just a single from the rest of the over as Jadeja, perhaps 
disgusted by Rashid’s rather filthy leg-stump line, declines to continue the 
fun.

“Morning Dan.” Morning, Simon McMahon. “England have two chances in this 
match, slim and none. And while Kohli’s still batting, slim has left town. 
Anyway, did Derek Smalls buy you a cocktail?” The way this is going now we’re 
looking at a result either way I reckon. And no, I just stuck to tea and fizzy 
water when Harry Shearer bought me lunch last week. Did I mention that happened?

107th over: India 325-6 (Kohli 72, Jadeja 10) Root continues. For some strange 
reason, Jadeja is not overwhelmed by fear and absolutely mullers the second 
ball over midwicket for six. Root then spins one nastily away from the outside 
edge and to slip via Bairstow’s chest; they appeal but it missed the bat by a 
fair old way. Oh and then he nearly gets him with the straight one!

Richard Woods writes on Patel: “He was honestly very unlucky today. A better 
player might have had the chance to play and miss or nearly get bowled. But he 
got out early to a part-time bowler, having contributed little to his team’s 
score and as result, his first ball escape notwithstanding, he lost the 
opportunity for getting a bit of good luck. I would love to see him play pretty 
much the same way in the second innings, and in between times give his yap a 
rest.”
 
106th over: India 319-6 (Kohli 72, Jadeja 4) Hello, a rare sweep shot from 
Virat Kohli. He looks pretty angry out there, slog sweeping hard off leg-stump 
and getting four then spanking one back at Rashid, whodrops the India captain 
moving to his left! Should have taken that and he nearly makes up for it by 
drifting one past the outside edge. The final ball is short and The Incredible 
Virat thwacks it hard through square-leg on the pull for another boundary. This 
is fun!

105th over: India 311-6 (Kohli 64, Jadeja 4) There hasn’t been a huge amount 
for England fans to cheer in this series, so do get stuck in. Root gets his 
second wicket in four balls and he’s not far away from a third in eight when 
Jadeja clips a clump just over the leaping bowler’s outstretched arm. Instead, 
it’s four runs.

That wasn’t even close to the helmet – the ball nestled firmly in Jennings’ 
midriff. Quite what Ashwin was hanging around for I’ve no idea.
 
Oh my. Ashwin has flicked this to short-leg, where Jennings has taken a very 
sharp catch. They’re checking to see if it hit the batsman’s helmet though.
 
104th over: India 307-5 (Kohli 64, Ashwin 0) We should probably give Bairstow 
greater credit for that catch. I initially said Patel pushed at it but that’s 
wrong: he gave himself room and went for a big drive and the keeper barely had 
any time to react.

Boy, those Germans have a word for everything.
 
103rd over: India 305-5 (Kohli 62, Ashwin 0) Cook goes off the field, Joe Root 
takes the captaincy and immediately brings himself into the attack. “Ooh there 
we go, that’s nice” says someone near the stump mic and I dearly hope that was 
Root too, because he’s got Patel with a beauty three balls later. India have 
lost three for 43 and that’s a wicket maiden. All hail Joe Root: he’s better 
than you.
 
Joe Root strikes! It’s a lovely ball, tossed up outside off and Mr Pot 
Stirrer’s luck is out: he drives at it and gets a thin edge through to 
Bairstow, who juggles it and takes a good catch at the second attempt.

Maqbool/AP  
102nd over: India 305-4 (Kohli 62, Patel 15) India are within double figures 
now, thanks to a single pushed to cover by Patel, a second nudged into the 
on-side by Kohli, a cut hammered out to point for two by the former and finally 
a flick to square leg for another one. Maybe John Starbuck was right in the 
previous over. Alastair Cook has forgotten the new ball is available, hasn’t he?
 
101st over: India 300-4 (Kohli 61, Patel 11) A short bit of rubbish from Moeen 
cordially invites Patel into double figures and the batsman gleefully accepts, 
pulling away an ugly shot to the midwicket boundary. He then adds a single to 
take India to 300.

“Good morning,” begins the ever-polite John Starbuck. “As we’re about halfway 
through the game, how do you reckon England’s chances? I know the recent stats 
are on their side, but you’d expect a bit of pace again by now if they are to 
run through India’s tail today.” Very, very slim, I reckon. I’d stick with 
these two for a few more overs yet, given Patel likes pace on the ball and that 
it’s spitting off the pitch, but Ashwin has been a right old pain in the 
backside to get out so far.
 
100th over: India 294-4 (Kohli 60, Patel 6)  Rashid to continue after drinks 
and Kohli, refreshed and reinvigorated after that break (or perhaps just, you 
know, Virat bloomin’ Kohli) gets into a bit of width and cuts the first ball 
beyond the despairing dive of the fielder coming round to backward point and 
away for four. A single to the very same fielder later, Patel drives through 
cover for a couple more. Rashid then has the big mouth  left-hander in a bit of 
trouble, twice tying him up in knots.
