In repressive states, the role of the artist is unambiguous: to assert the 
individual imagination, the singular power that all dictatorships fear. I 
remember oncetalking to the Czech dissident and writer Ivan Klima 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/02/ivan-klima-interview>, who had 
been subject both to the arbitrary horror of a Nazi concentration camp as a 
child and the long grinding years of Soviet occupation in which he had become a 
“non-person” for two decades, harassed constantly by secret police and unable 
to speak or write in public. He survived by “living in truth”. “I have always 
pursued inner freedom,” he said. “I have never been censored.”

Klima was part of that group of artists and writers who gathered in the Magic 
Lantern theatre in Prague in 1989 to orchestrate the “Velvet Revolution” and 
see their dreams of liberation realised. And how did it feel to experience 
freedom, to have the external world finally correspond with that interior life 
for the first time?

McCabe for the Guardian 
“It is interesting that a man very quickly accepts freedom as a normal thing,” 
Klima said. “Though we had fought for it for so long, after a few weeks or 
months we did not think about it. Rather you start to see things you would like 
to change, things that make you angry, corruption and so forth, environmental 
problems, the obsession with the market…” Habits of protest die hard.

There are, of course, many courageous artists across the world with Klima’s 
stubborn courage.Ai Weiwei  <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei>
is only the best known, but he remains a crucial figure, one irrepressible man 
living in truth who reveals the billion lies attending China’s advance into the 
world. Weiwei used to reject the idea he was a political figure, insisting that 
he was only an artist (as if the two were distinguishable). After his 
imprisonment in 2012, his tone seemed to change. “People are always wondering 
if I am an artist or politician,” he said. “Maybe I’ll just clearly tell you: 
whatever I do is not art. Let’s say it is just objects or materials, movies or 
writing, but not art, OK?”

How do you stick it to the man when the man is a tax-dodging global network of 
information systems run by smart hippies?

In Russia, Pussy Riot <https://www.theguardian.com/music/pussy-riot> have 
acquired something of Weiwei’s power – the power to prove the futility of 
censorship and the integrity of protest. They took their inspiration from the
Voina <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/12/voina-art-terrorism>
, a group which, like all the best art political movements, trailed a 
manifesto. Point one read: “Create the rebirth of heroical behavioural ideals 
of an artist-intellectual… the artist as romantic hero, who prevails over evil. 
Produce lively romantic models in contrast with today’s soulless commercial 
conceptual art.” Voina’s most famous performance was a protest against the 2008 
election of President Medvedev. This “lively romantic” act took place in the 
Moscow Biological Museum, beside a stuffed bear. Five couples from Voina 
undressed and had vigorous sex in the hall. One of the participants, Alexei 
Plutser-Sarno, described the work as the only honest portrait of pre-election 
Russia: “Everybody fucks each other, and the puppy bear” [a nickname for 
Medvedev] “looks on with an unconcealed scorn.”

In the west, where freedoms of speech are, theoretically at least, guaranteed 
in law, the challenge for an artist to make an effective political statement is 
more complex. Where anything goes, where we are flooded daily with millions of 
uncensored images, what honestly gives us pause, or makes a statement? Perhaps 
as a result of this, the art world, that moving spectacle of expos and fairs 
and biennials – Voina’s “soulless commercial conceptual art” – can appear to 
exist in a self-referential bubble. The suddenly hardening political moment, 
however – where across Europe and in the US, liberal certainties feel under 
threat – seems to call for a different kind of artistic engagement. What that 
might look like is still under construction.

Street art and the outlaw sloganeering of Banksy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/banksy> was one effort to test the 
in-house freedoms of the gallery in less permissive spaces. Another, more 
rigorous attempt would be theinspiring project of the American Theaster Gates 
in Chicago’s South Side 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/03/theaster-gates-artist-chicago-dorchester-projects>
. Gates is using the material of his historically blighted neighbourhood, 
repurposed as art, to regenerate entire blocks of that community and connect 
its residents with a radical civil rights past, makingblack lives matter  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement>in bricks and 
mortar. His 2011 collection, In the Event of a Race Riot, coiled a series 
decommissioned fire hoses from the civil rights era in gilt-frame boxes. They 
sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars and Gates ploughed the money directly 
back into community projects.

Other artists pursue different strategies. Protest, which opens later this 
month at the Victoria Miro gallery in London, will dramatise some of them. It 
is a show, in some ways, nostalgic for the dualities of 60s protest (currently 
celebrated in the V&A exhibitionYou Say You Want a Revolution? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/21/san-francisco-exhibition-victoria-albert-revolution-silicon-valley>
). Taking as a starting point the American painter Alice Neel’s prophetic 1936 
painting,Nazis Murder Jews, which depicts a Communist party torchlight parade 
through the streets of New York City, it collects new and recent pieces that 
address in different ways our own disorienting political moment. Work that 
confronts, often obliquely, the struggles aroundmigration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration>, censorship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/censorship>, Black Lives Matter, the rise of 
surveillance <https://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance> and the 
re-emergence, across Europe and in the US, of thepopulist right 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/britain-right-wing-brexit-america-trump>
.

I wanted something that existed outside any system… a living platform for the 
artists to experiment'
Doug Aitken 
Speaking to some of the artists involved in the show in the past week, I found 
a consensus about two things. The first was that, with thephenomenon of Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in America and the threats to 
cohesive democracy in Europe, the need for a politically engaged art has rarely 
been more urgent. The second was that the means to that end are necessarily 
nuanced. It is harder to challenge power if, in a globalised world, you don’t 
know precisely where power lies. How do you stick it to the man, when the man 
in question is not a state or a corporation, but, increasingly a tax-dodging 
global network of information systems run by smart former hippies with untold 
wealth?

Western artists are generally uneasy at being viewed as political in the way 
that Weiwei has come to accept; they see it as a limit on their asserted 
freedom. Michael Elmgreen, one half of the celebrated provocateur duoElmgreen & 
Dragset 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/30/elmgreen-dragset-van-gogh-ear-new-york>
, winced a little when I used the phrase “protest art”. He doesn’t, he said, 
feel comfortable under that banner. “I feel that more political activists like 
Pussy Riot have a different kind of approach. Our statements are more 
influenced by ideas of infiltration.”

Masses of information is coming at us and the speed of it makes the hierarchy 
of what to protest against very slippery
Sarah Sze 
Why not something more direct?

“Take something like Occupy Wall Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/occupy-wall-street>,” he says. “You’re 
making yourself as an otherness, an opponent, you try to fight power in that 
way. Unfortunately, in 99% of cases you lose because you are not strong enough 
to fight an established power structure. So we prefer to go in and try to 
clarify how easily these existing structures could be changed. Show how fragile 
and unstable they are.”

Most famously, with this project in mind, the duo built a replica Prada shop 
in the middle of the howling Texas desert, to suggest even artful capitalism 
would pass.

When showing work in China, some western artists have had a small taste of 
what Ai WeiWei encounters daily.Sarah Sze 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/sarah-sze>, the American sculptor, 
who creates wonderful, unsettling mind maps of consumerist detritus that spill 
across the gallery floor, fell foul of the Chinese censors in Guangzhou. While 
in no way comparing her situation to that of Ai Weiwei, in some ways 
confronting the blunt instrument of censorship gave her work extra force and 
clarity, she suggested.

“Protest requires focus,” she said. “If the Occupy movement could have focused 
around one moment or image – like John and Yoko in a bed – it would have helped 
that movement a lot. My work really reflects the sense, I think, that we have 
masses of information coming at us from sources we don’t know, and the speed of 
that makes the hierarchy of what to protest against very slippery all the time.”

Sze is somewhat wistful for the simple visual protests of her student years. 
“At my American college the entire main campus was filled with shanty towns 
protesting apartheid. A lot of students were kicked out as a result. Those are 
the kinds of things where art can be dangerous to power.”

In our digital age did she feel that any solid act of making becomes a 
political act?

“There’s an incredible longing for stillness,” she said, “in the way that you 
stand in front of a Vermeer and are having a physical conversation with Vermeer 
across time and place. The idea of the hand-made itself can be quite 
conservative. But what seems important to me is how you create a moment where 
you feel the presence of the maker, a live conversation. You see it in the 
growth of live events and talks and happenings. The premium on storytelling. 
Museum attendance rates even have gone through the ceiling.”

That one-to-one connection in itself might suggest a form of protest at the 
way culture and relationships are now mediated – the acceptance that 
conversation and intimacy are structurally eavesdropped by corporations and 
government.

One of the motivations for American Doug Aitken’s ongoing Station to Station 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/25/barbican-station-to-station-art-exhibition-doug-aitken>
 project, which took groups of artists coast to the coast in the States by 
train, making spontaneous 60s-style happenings on the way, was to avoid any 
mediation at all.

“I wanted something that existed outside any system,” he said. “I wanted a 
living platform for the artists to experiment. To be open to what crosses your 
path.”

What were the moments in that journey that he enjoyed most?

“I think of an artist like Ed Ruscha, famous for his painting. His response 
was to make 300 cactus omelettes out in the desert,” he said. “Or a musician 
likeBeck  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/28/station-to-station-film-review>
who said he had always wanted to work with, like, a huge choir of gospel 
singers but he had never been allowed to do it in the commercial sector. So we 
were able to do that in an abandoned drive-in theatre in the middle of the 
desert where the train stopped, and the sound of this vocal was like a huge 
turbine engine, at dusk, and the warm wind blowing and you are in the middle of 
nowhere in America. It feels untethered to any existing system. Those kinds of 
situations are very special.”

 Station to Station, Doug Aitken’s journey through modern creativity. 
Photograph: Doug Aitken 
At a time of political insanity such as that which is unfolding in this 
American election, Aitken suggested it was an artist’s role to create 
alternative visions of society, or just to create for the hell of it. It is an 
honourable tradition. The abstract painter Joan Miró was never a political 
activist in a conventional sense, but he was always his own man. When he was 
asked late in life what he had done to oppose General Franco, he didn’t 
hesitate to reply: “Free and radical things.”

Aitken agreed. “Any worthwhile art is never optional,” he said. “It’s not a 
political strategy. It’s an extension of who you are and how you see the world. 
It’s always non-negotiable.”

fearful.’ Photograph: Getty Images 
The Danish artist Michael Elmgreen has worked in a partnership with the 
Norwegian artist Ingar Dragset since 1995. Their 2012 bronze of a boy on a
rocking horse occupied the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17140952>, as a comment on the 
surrounding statues commemorating war heroes. For the Protest show, they will 
display a replica prison cell, broken up as if by an earthquake, which they 
first showed in São Paulo.

We are living at a time when the freedom to offend - and to protest - is 
widely under threat. Is it ever more important as an artist to make those 
statements?
Fear is a very unfortunate thing for a culture if you want to make it vibrant 
and dynamic. And fear of offence shows you are scared of what happens if people 
express their opinions. That often ends up in a kind of stagnation, with 
everyone holding each other at gunpoint. It also ends up giving men like Nigel 
Farage or Donald Trump their popularity, because people are fed up being told 
what they can or cannot say in public. They vote as a protest, no matter what 
the consequences of it.

The really frightening thing is that the generation now in their 20s, they 
don’t believe things can be better

How do we process these things? Can art create that space?
Art can work with it in a different way than a sensational news way. Art is 
not just some loose information that you get on the internet. You are 
confronted with something physical and hopefully the art statement is a bit 
more nuanced and even profound. We recently did ashow in Israel 
<http://www.tamuseum.org.il/about-the-exhibition/elmgreen-dragset> at the Tel 
Aviv museum. In their main hall, we put a full-scale replica of a section of 
the Berlin Wall. We moved to Berlin soon after the wall came down, so we felt 
we could speak about walls in general and hoped that it would make people think 
about the wall that had been built between Palestine and Israel. We come from 
outside, we don’t live with that conflict. But we could speak about our 
experience of how important it was for us that the Berlin Wall came down

What response did you get?
People were moved by it, I think, especially because we did no finger 
pointing. It was something for them to stand in front of a wall as a single 
person being blocked in their movement. And we were of course also speaking 
about Donald Trump’s idea of building a wall at the Mexican border. It is not 
uncommon to try to solve problems by putting up a physical barrier. But it 
doesn’t often work.

Given the fevered political moment across Europe and in the States, is there 
more of an urgency for artists to have a position?
Absolutely. We have lost our sense of being good citizens, of having a wider 
vision. That sounds quite old school and nostalgic, but it is true. Politics 
has just become economics – how much do I pay in tax, how much do I get? The 
internet has made us very egocentric individuals. We are no longer proud of, 
say, being part of a third generation of steel workers that built a country. We 
call ourselves “working class” or “artist” or “feminist” or “homosexual” in a 
very different way from the way we would have said those things in the 1960s. 
We have lost our sense of belonging.

What are the consequences of that?
We have a very cynical media landscape and the internet fuels that. We don’t 
hear enough: how can we make this in a different way? The really frightening 
thing is that the generation now in their 20s, they don’t believe things can be 
better. That is not only very unusual, it is also super-fucking-dangerous.

How can art help in that?
Press and politicians focus on fear-mongering. People are easy to control if 
they are fearful. That’s how art can make a difference, I think: it can make 
people less fearful.

for the Observer 
Sarah Sze’s intricate installations were described by the New Yorker as 
“changing the potential for sculpture”. She has been awarded a MacArthur 
“genius” grant and represented the US at the 2013 Venice Biennale.

What’s the history of the piece you have made for this Protest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/protest> show?
I originally made a version of the piece for a show in Philadelphia. Every 
day, I kept the front page of theNew York Times and cut out the pictures and 
replaced them with pictures that were vast in terms of time and space – there 
could be an image of the ocean, an image from 500 years ago… I was interested 
in contrasting what was newsworthy with these timeless images. That piece was 
then accepted for a triennial in Guangzhou. When we were shipping it we were 
contacted by the Chinese authorities saying they wanted specific front pages to 
be removed.

What was the problem?
It turned out that every front page I was being asked to remove said something 
about China; it could be just a phrase or something. So I made a new version 
for China. The piece was actually on the floor, like it was protecting the 
floor, spattered with paint and so on. So I took black paint and painted out 
the parts they wanted redacted and then mentioned the fact in the wall note. 
For this show, I have done the opposite. I left in all the pieces I had 
redacted and painted black all the rest of the text.

So it wasn’t conceived as a narrowly political work, but the Chinese censors 
gave it that edge?
Yes. It was amazing to me that the Chinese government actually paid such 
attention. It suggests a belief that art has a major influence on society.

At Columbia. I’ve had to remind students a few times that making art is not 
like going to business or law school

Have we become complacent about these things in the west?
Perhaps. But the powers that be here are more aware that the moment you shut 
something down you make it radical. Those things backfire on politicians.

We are living in quite extreme political times, suddenly. Does that feel like 
something that you feel you need to respond to in a direct way?
Artists respond in different ways. I just gave an artwork to Hillary Clinton’s 
campaign and a lot of artists are doing that. Some of the artworks that have 
been given are demonstrably anti-Trump but you have to be careful making direct 
statements because it can be turned on its head very quickly.

Why did you donate to Clinton?
We’re at a very critical point in the US and I wanted to do anything I could 
to see things move in a better direction. Everyone needs to do something. There 
is this great sense still of: oh, of course that won’t happen, but at each 
point so far it has been predicted very poorly.

Can artists lead that action? Is it a moment where culture needs to assert its 
values?
The conversation is going on certainly. I think campuses got very 
deradicalised in the US in the first 10 years of this century; I don’t know why.

Over here, the money became so absurd for young artists in the public eye that 
it became difficult to see them as radical. I suppose the sense grew that being 
an artist was a career option, and a lucrative one, in the way that it had 
really never been…
Absolutely. I’m a professor at Columbia. I find I’ve had to remind students a 
few times that making art is not like going to business or law school. You are 
not guaranteed an outcome.

 Isaac Julien: ‘It doesn’t help to resort to the clichés of protest.’ 
Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian 
London-born Isaac Julien <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/isaac-julien> 
began to explore the crisis of migration into Europe in 2007 with his prophetic 
film,Western Union: Small Boats, which explored the perilous crossing from 
North Africa. He was speaking from Rio where he is installing his follow-up 
work,10,000 Waves, about the world of the Chinese cockle pickers who drowned on 
Morecambe Bay in 2004. Brazil is the 30th country in which it has been shown.

Does your work always have a journalistic impulse in the beginning? 
Yes, it’s usually connected to something in the real world. I read the news 
all the time, like everyone does, but when you make art you are trying to see 
how to move beyond the headline. How do you make a work that will stand the 
test of time? You need to give some visceral and emotional relationship to the 
story. As soon as I read the cockle-picker story I knew I would make something. 
The problem is how to shape it. It haunts you.

The Ukip stuff is nostalgia… for England to become great again. But that 
“greatness” was intimately connected to empire

Your first film looked at the black artist Langston Hughes and the Harlem 
renaissance that was a forerunner of the civil-rights movement. Is it harder 
for artist activists to find a focus for protest now?
At the moment art is seeking to find the right questions rather than come up 
with answers. And that is an important role. We’re in a much more complex world 
now. As artists it doesn’t help to resort to clichés of protest. Oddly, there 
is a lot of new interest inLooking for Langston. It is partly because of Black 
Lives Matter. As the political culture of Trump has brought about a nostalgia 
for very conservative values, there’s a sort of balancing re-engagement with 
civil rights.

The current situation in Britain seems to be parallelling what happened in the 
1980s with the collapse of a coherent left and the dominance of a xenophobic 
Tory party. The strongest critique of Thatcherism came from writers and 
film-makers. Are we not crying out for something like that?
Culture can provide a place for thinking things through in opposition, which 
is desperately needed at the moment. There is a crisis. I was very influenced 
by the thinking of [the cultural theorist] Stuart Hall. Those people were very 
good at looking at the political scene and providing a language to discuss it.

It makes no sense in many ways for us to think in national terms in art or 
politics or anything else any more - our world is characterised by 
interdependence - but is the “international” artist in danger of becoming 
unmoored in some ways, of losing a connection with the audience?
I wouldn’t say that Western Union: Small Boats was unmoored. I have a 
background in London, but my parents were from the Caribbean, so you have that 
internationalism into your DNA.

Is creating art that has a global range of reference in itself a protest 
against the advance of Little England rhetoric?
I think so. The Ukip stuff is nostalgia. I can understand it. The nostalgia is 
for England to become great again. But that “greatness” was intimately 
connected to empire, you can’t forget that. The OBE is still not the Order of 
British Excellence. It is the Order of the British Empire.

Is the multicultural ideal advanced by Hall and others more under threat than 
ever?
There is always more than one story going on. At the same time as we had 
Brexit, London voted for a mayor with an Indian and Muslim background. There is 
a double movement between the metropolitan idea of England and the reaction 
against that. But it’s not clear which one is winning just now.

 Doug Aitken: ’The Station to Station project was born out of a desire for 
action.’ Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian 
Doug Aitken is an American artist and curator, best known recently for his 
creationStation to Station, which invited a 100 artists from all disciplines – 
including musician Beck and conceptual artist Olafur Eliasson – to take a train 
from coast to coast across America and stop along the way to create a series of 
60s-style “happenings”. He lives, inevitably, in California.

Did you see Station to Station in the tradition of the great American road 
trip of the 50s and 60s?
I did, but the project was born out of a desire for action. It’s really 
interesting how segregated music, art, cinema, books and so on are. WithStation 
to Station, instead of critiquing this, we tried to create something that 
erases the separation, that allowed many artists to be in motion together.

Do you think that fragmentation is a way of controlling those cultural forces?
I’m not sure it’s a conspiracy. Different mediums create infrastructures and 
infrastructures slow down the possibilities for change. It’s funny. When I was 
talking to the gallery about Protest it conjured those ideas of a feminist 
rally in 1978 and people standing out in the cold with placards. The tools we 
have to work with now are so different. The power of an image to transmit an 
idea coherently is so much reduced. Take those seminal images from Vietnam – 
the monk setting himself on fire or the child running from the napalm. Those 
images were disseminated by conventional media. Now there’s a constant river of 
images from millions of iPhones. The question is: what has potency? Technology 
is opening up incredible new possibilities but also dangers, not least a sense 
of the loss of self. It is a twilight that we are living in right now, which is 
very unpredictable and also very stimulating.

I don’t separate social and political work from any other art. The value of 
any art is to forge new questions

On a political level, that twilight sense seems to have led to the rise of 
these populist political leaders who promise control. What do you make of the 
Trump phenomenon?
The whole presidential race in America right now is like an enormous hologram 
projected on the sky. We all look up at it. It is like a cloud that will never 
leave us but it has no meaning or substance.

<https://vimeo.com/79329869> 
At some point soon, though, it might have real meaning for a lot of lives. Do 
we not need to find a direct way to engage with it?
It’s an interesting question and a strange time to ask it. What I see mostly 
is an incredible political apathy. By and large, the political system appears 
so corporate-driven that people have a hard time seeing how they can affect it. 
When you get to that point, real change comes from secession. The most 
interesting projects or groups or actions now don’t exist in opposition in a 
traditional protest way, but as something entirely separate from the 
mainstream, for example, the Slow Food Movement, which is people following 
something they believe in ethically but also taking away the capital that is 
funding the existing system. They are voting with what they purchase or don’t

Can art work in the same way?
I don’t separate social and political work as different from any other art. 
The value of any art is to be curious and to forge new languages and questions. 
The whole landscape has changed. You don’t have to wait for a single critic in 
New York to come to your exhibition or hear your music. We don’t have those 
high peaks of culture and dark valleys of culture – everything is eroded down 
to this kind of universal jungle. We are all our own critics and sponsors now.
