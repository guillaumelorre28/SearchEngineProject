Modern Art in New York when he took the time to deviate and address concerns

“We are going to be all right,” he said, according to Vulture 
<http://www.vulture.com/2016/11/let-tom-hanks-reassure-america-well-be-okay.html>
. “America has been in worse places than we are at right now.” He went on to 
praise the constitution, saying: “That document is going to protect us, over 
and over again, whether or not our neighbors preserve and protect and defend it 
themselves.”

Hanks, who previously referred to Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as “a self-involved gasbag” 
and publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton, spoke about the importance of still 
respecting the US.

“We may move at a slow pace, but we do have the greatest country in the world, 
because we are always moving towards a more perfect union,” he said. “That 
journey never ceases. It never stops. Sometimes, like in a Bruce Springsteen 
song, one step forward, two steps back. But we still, aggregately, move 
forward. We, who are a week into wondering what the hell just happened, will 
continue to move forward. We have to choose to do so. But we will move forward, 
because if we do not move forward, what is to be said about us?”

He also responded to Michael Moore’s suggestion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/14/michael-moore-oprah-winfrey-tom-hanks-us-president-donald-trump-democratic-party>
 that he would make a great Democratic candidate in 2020, saying he wanted to 
“strangle” the documentary film-maker.
