Mourners have paid their respects to the victims of Sunday’s attack on the 
seat of CopticChristianity <https://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity> in 
Egypt, as the Coptic pope sought to heal sectarian frictions amid rising anger 
from a minority that claims it is insufficiently protected.


The attack on St Peter and St Paul church, adjoining Cairo’s St Mark’s 
Cathedral,took place during Sunday morning prayers

 and killed 24 people, most of them women and children, according to an updated 
toll issued by the health ministry on Monday. At least 45 others were injured. 
There has been no claim of responsibility.

President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi named a 22-year-old, Mahmoud Shafik Mohamed 
Mostafa, as the alleged perpetrator of the suicide attack. He said other 
people, including one woman, had been arrested over their alleged involvement.

As mourners crowded into the Virgin Mary and St Athanasius church in Cairo on 
Monday, the Coptic pope, Tawadros II, attempted to focus on the unity of 
Egypt’s grief, denouncing the blast as “not just a disaster for the church but 
a disaster for the whole nation”.

He added: “Those who commit acts such as this do not belong to Egypt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt> at all, even if they are on its land.”

The dead were given a state funeral attended by Sisi, who has also been 
careful to stress the need for unity among Egypt’s Christian and Muslim 
citizens in the wake of the attack.

But for some in the Middle East’s biggest Christian community, those calls are 
far from enough.

Some survivors criticised lax security measures for the mass, which they said 
had not coped with the unusually high numbers of congregants. “There were large 
numbers, so people entered without being searched,” Mina Francis, who was at 
the mass with his mother, told Reuters. His mother was killed.

Scuffles broke out on Monday as protesters accused police of security failures 
and demanded Sisi sack the interior minister. Some chanted: “The people demand 
the fall of the regime,” the rallying cry of the 2011 revolt that ended Hosni 
Mubarak’s 30-year rule.

“People have a volcano of anger inside their chests,” Nora Sedki, a Christian 
government employee who joined a demonstration of several hundred protesters, 
told the Associated Press.

Many Copts feel that in Sisi’s Egypt there is a culture of impunity among 
those who attack Christians, especially in areas such as the town of Minya, 
almost 140 miles south of Cairo.

Attacks on Christians in Minya, including the burning of buildings suspected 
of being used for Christian prayers, have spiked this year. In May, a 
70-year-old woman in the town of Karam was paraded naked through the streets 
after being accused of having an affair with a Muslim man.

A database <http://eshhad.timep.org/database/> compiled by the Tahrir 
Institute for Middle East Policy lists 54 incidents against religious 
minorities in Egypt in 2016. For some in the Coptic community, Sunday’s attack 
– the worst since a suicide bombing in 2011 killed more than 20 people – was 
the latest example of the state merely paying lip service to protecting 
minorities while failing to do so on the ground.

The town of Tahna al-Gabal, close to Minya, briefly became the eye of the 
storm for attacks on Christians on 18 July when 27-year-old Fam Mary Khalaf was 
stabbed to death after he intervened in a street brawl between Muslim locals 
and the family of local clerics.

Khalaf’s mother, who declined to give her full name, discovered her injured 
son. “By the time we got him to the hospital, he was already dead,” she told 
the Guardian this year.

Such attacks have deepened a sense of siege mentality among the Christian 
population. And, while Khalaf’s mother was initially hopeful that her son’s 
killers would receive at least 25 years in prison, others were not convinced 
that justice would be served. No one has yet been tried or convicted for 
Khalaf’s murder.

Aftermath of bomb blast inside Cairo’s Coptic church

“Here, it never happened that the killer of a Christian was given a death 
sentence,” said one member of the community, who declined to be named. “They 
try to reduce the sentence by saying the killer was defending themselves,” he 
added at the time.

Events such as these were testing the relationship between the Coptic 
community and the Egyptian state long before Sunday’s attack. Egyptian 
Christians have traditionally sought both spiritual and political 
representation through the church, which maintains strong ties with the 
government. This has kept conflict resolution away from state institutions such 
as the judiciary.

But some, such as John Bushra, an unofficial spokesman for the bishop of 
Minya, Anba Makarios, and the local secretary general of the pro-government 
Free Egyptians party, dislike the informal reconciliation sessions favoured by 
the state, which unite local religious leaders, victims and their attackers to 
find solutions outside of the judicial system. “These are usually biased 
against the Christian community,” he said.

For some members of the Christian community in Minya, faith in the justice 
system has worn thin after decades of violence. “We don’t go to the police as 
we’ve had bad experiences with them – we don’t trust that there will be 
justice, plus it could attract too much attention to us within the community” 
said Nady Khalil, a Minya resident.

“When the people go to the police, they should put religion aside to solve 
problems,” he said. “From my point of view, that’s not done here.”
