BEST VIEWS

Holme Fell, Hodge Close, Coniston

This lovely, family-friendly fell (only 317 metres) has huge views over 
Coniston Water, out of all proportion to the effort required to the scale the 
summit. You’re very unlikely to see anyone else up here on its heather-clad 
summit and, half way up, there is a delightful lake for a swim. From here, pick 
a path to the summit via the boulders, keeping to the right. On your descent, 
make sure to explore Hodge Close, a remarkable lagoon quarry. The view from the 
edge down into the jade waters is extraordinary and terrifying, and the 
reflection of the caves is said to resemble a skull. The intrepid can descend 
safely to water level to explore the caverns or Parrock Quarry behind.
• South of Skelwith Bridge on A593, turn right signed “Hodge Close only”. 
Continue to the end to find parking and quarry. From the south end, a path 
leads up through woods to the lake and summit. 45 minutes.Map co-ordinates

At the end of the last ice age, 15,000 years ago, vast quantities of meltwater 
waterfalls created dramatic limestone escarpments with spectacular views. 
Gordale Scar is perhaps the most otherwordly, but few people ever approach it 
from above. This route crosses wild meadows, thick with purple orchids, and 
descends to a pretty beck lined with caves and crags. The water suddenly 
disappears through a great hollow as it approaches the lip, but it emerges 
again. You can follow it down via a steep path, before suddenly arriving at the 
top of a dramatic waterfall lookout. Down below is a great circular chasm, 100m 
deep and once a huge cavern which has long-since collapsed.
• The best approach is via the beck from Street Gate, near Malham Tarn, or 
Mastiles Lane Roman camp. Alternatively ascend from Gordale campsite below. 30 
minutes.Map co-ordinates

Swaledale was so remote in the 17th century, the nearest consecrated burial 
ground was over three days’ away, along the valley-top “Corpse Road”. Start by 
following this from Keld then descend down to the spectacular double waterfalls 
at Kidson – perfect for swimming and jumping – before climbing up to the 
wonderfully named Crackpot Hall. Perched high on the edge of the valley by a 
mine, the name comes from the Old Norse wordkráka for crow and Old English pot 
for cave or ravine. In the 1930s, stories were told of untamed children who 
lived there like “spirits of the moors”. Afterwards, continue on to Swinner 
Gill, a deep canyon with pools, caves and lead-mine ruins – great fun for 
scrambling, too. Follow the river down to Muker to picnic in some of the best 
traditional meadows in England, or enjoy lunch at theFarmer’s Arms 
<http://www.farmersarmsmuker.co.uk/>, but save some energy for the return to 
Keld, back on the Corpse Road.

With England’s highest mountain and deepest lake, this a fabulous and dramatic 
valley to explore. Start at the white quartz beach at Overbeck Bridge, where 
there are wonderful views of Scafell Pike towering over the lake and looking 
like something from Tolkien. Passing England’s smallest church, head up the 
Wasdale valley, but bear right at 300m altitude for a spectacular canyon gully 
scramble up the precipitous ravine of Piers Gill. This is a fabulous but 
little-used route up to the Corridor Path at 700 metres (and leads onto Scafell 
Pike if you wish). Descend via Lingmell Gill and refresh yourself at the lively 
Wasdale Head Inn (camping at the National Trust campsite nearby).

Humans first inhabited the Lakes region over 13,000 years ago and while many 
have heard of Castlerigg stone circle, it is but one of hundreds of hidden 
bronze-age “druidical” structures used for astronomy and worship over 4,000 
years ago. Above Eskdale, on Burnmoor, there is a cluster of no fewer than five 
stone circles, all within minutes of each other, among a sea of burial cairns 
and sacred stones. It’s one of the most sacred but least visited spots in the 
Lakes, and leads on to remote Burnmoor Tarn with its haunted “lodge”. The 
scenery on the walk there is stunning and you might spot carnivorous sundew 
plants and butterwort.

Founded in 1156, Jervaulx Abbey was once a great Cistercian monastery but was 
pillaged during the dissolution in the 16th century. These superb ruins are now 
beautifully planted in a semi-wild fashion, surrounded by parkland and ancient 
trees. North Yorkshire abounds with abbey ruins, but Jervaulx feels lost in 
time. Entry by donation. Look out for the impressive old beech tree avenue in 
the car park opposite, and the pleasant tea room in the visitor centre.

Littondale is a lost valley in the heart of the Dales, with a perfect babbling 
trout stream, ancient woodlands and a backdrop of high fells. This venerable 
ivy-clad village inn has changed little in 100 years and, from 1972 to 1975, 
was the original Woolpack Inn from Emmerdale Farm. The lunch menu is built on 
pies, ploughmans (£5.95) and Timothy Taylor beers from the cask and served in a 
jug; stuffed deer heads and fishing tackle adorn the walls. There are six large 
bedrooms: one with a four-poster, cheaper ones with good old-fashioned shared 
bathrooms. Fishing permits for the Skirfare river are included in the price. 
Gamey dinners – a fried grouse starter, say, followed by pork chops and 
Yorkshire curd tart – are served at 7pm sharp.

People flock to Windermere but the serene lakes just to the west are far less 
busy. Esthwaite is warm and large with a long silver gravel beach which gently 
shelves into crystal clear water. Dive in and swim out among the reflections of 
Latterbarrow and Furness fells. There’s easy access from the lane-side car

The river Wharfe is one of the best wild swimming rivers in the Dales, but in 
tiny Appletreewick you can escape the crowds. There’s an idyllic rocky pool in 
the river with a small island and bay, plus rapids upstream and a large shingle 
beach on the far bank downstream. There’s a good rope swing on the far side, 
with grassy banks and a field for picnics. Children can often be seen riding on 
rubber rings down the rapids from Mason’s Campsite upstream. Across the road is 
the eccentricCraven Arms <http://www.craven-cruckbarn.co.uk/>, which is full of 
antiquities, has gas lighting, log fires, stone-flagged floors and a striking 
heather-thatched cruck barn. Upstream is Loup Scar, which is near Burnsall, a 
fantastic stretch of grassy riverside and limestone cliffs to explore. There’s 
a terrifying jump here, into a small, very deep plunge pool.
• Appletreewick rocky pool is two miles off the B6160 between Grassington and 
Bolton Abbey. Opposite the New Inn (the-new-inn-appletreewick.com 
<http://www.the-new-inn-appletreewick.com/>) find a gate and follow the track 
for five minutes down the field to the river.Map co-ordinates
