The alt right certainly enjoyed Trump’s speech tonight. While his return to a 
fire and brimstone approach to immigration reform may not necessarily appeal to 
swing voters, it did cast the attention of those fringe elements on the right 
who have long been drawn to Trump’s campaign.

David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan:

David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) 
Excellent speech by Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> tonight. Deport criminal 
aliens, end catch and release, enforce immigration laws & America First.

one of the godfathers of modern white nationalism in the United States:

Richard Spencer, considered one of the leaders of the alt right 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/racial-realists-are-cheered-by-trumps-latest-strategy/2016/08/20/cd71e858-6636-11e6-96c0-37533479f3f5_story.html>

VDare, an extremist rightwing website that promotes “the racial and cultural 
identity of America”:
Virginia Dare (@vdare) 
In a sane country, everything Trump has proposed tonight so far would be 
regarded as so obviously true it wouldn't even be up for debate.

<https://twitter.com/vdare/status/771170631874469888> 
Trump’s cozy relationship with this ideological fringe has long drawn 
scrutiny. However, with the hire of Steve Bannon, the head of the far right 
wing website Breitbart News two weeks ago to be his campaign manager, it 
brought Trump ties to alt right into forefront ina major speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/hillary-clinton-alt-right-racism-speech-donald-trump-nevada>
 by Hillary Clinton.

Trump wasn’t the only one to have changed his tone after Wednesday afternoon’s 
conciliatory meet-the-press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration>
 alongside Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto.

Speaking to Mexican TV on Wednesday evening, Peña Nieto was rather more 
strident, Reuters reports:

Mexico’s president rebuked Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as a threat to his country 
just hours after painting a positive picture of talks the two held on Wednesday 
to try to defuse tensions over the US presidential hopeful’s anti-Mexican 
campaign rhetoric.

In a late evening television interview, an angry-looking Peña Nieto sought to 
defend himself against a broad swathe of criticism for his decision to invite 
the Republican candidate despite his repeated verbal attacks onMexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico>. 


“His policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not 
prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing,” Peña Nieto said. “That risk, 
that threat, must be confronted. I told him that is not the way to build a 
mutually beneficial relationship for both nations.”

During a joint news conference after their meeting, Trump said he and Peña 
Nieto had not discussed his demand that Mexico pay for the border wall.

But Peña Nieto later contradicted Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration>
, saying he had told the American that Mexico would not foot the bill, and he 
bristled during his television interview when asked why he had not made that 
clear at the news conference.

Reuters also reports, incidentally, that the two men apparently spoke to each 
other in English in their meeting.

Trailing Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
in the polls with fewer than 70 days to the election, Trump and campaign aides 
had recently fuelled expectations of a “softening” of immigration policy, 
prompting speculation about a flip-flop.

Instead Wednesday’s speech, which his campaign billed as a major policy 
address, represented an abrupt reversion to an aggressive tone just hours after 
an unfamiliar conciliatory timbre in Mexico City,where Trump met President 
Enrique Peña Nieto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration>
.

The GOP nominee geed up the crowd in Phoenix with grisly details about murders 
committed by undocumented immigrants. He brought on stage “angel moms” whose 
children had been killed.

He spoke of cancelling an Obama administration programme that gave work 
permits to about 800,000 young immigrants who came to the US as children – a 
stance likely to slam shut any chance of Latino outreach.

Anybody who entered the US illegally was subject to deportation and there 
should be detainers for immigrants who committed any crime, not just felonies, 
he said: “There will be no amnesty.”

Trump also promised ideological tests for would-be visa applicants, a “sunset” 
on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years, and a ban on 
taxpayer funding for cities that don’t deport undocumented immigrants.

Lorella Praeli, national Latino vote director for Hillary for America has this 
to say on what the campaign is calling Trump’s “anti-immigrant hateful speech”:

In his darkest speech yet, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> doubled down on his 
anti-immigrant rhetoric and attempted to divide communities by pitting people 
against each other and demonizing immigrants.

Trump committed to sending a new ‘deportation task force’ into American 
communities, rescinding the president’s executive actions to protectDREAMers 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act> and their families, building a wall 
that he continues to claim will be paid for by Mexico, and made clear that ‘
Operation Wetback 
<http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/11/11/455613993/it-came-up-in-the-debate-here-are-3-things-to-know-about-operation-wetback>
’ was not severe enough.

The only immigrants allowed in the future are those that pass Donald Trump’s 
own test of ‘desirability’.

Donald Trump once again showed us that he will continue his decades-long 
record of divisiveness and campaign of hate by pledging to forcibly remove 
every single undocumented immigrant from our country. He showed us, very 
clearly, what’s at stake in this election by painting a picture of his idea of 
America: one in which immigrants are not welcomed and one in which innocent 
families are torn apart.

One of the new policies outlined by Trump was “ideological certification” of 
immigrants to the US. It’s not entirely clear what that means, but here’s what 
he said in the speech:

Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, 
and this is so important, especially if you get the right people and we will 
get the right people, an ideological certification to make sure that those we 
are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.

There was no pivoting. There was no softening. There was just Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

In Trump’s much heralded immigration speech, the Republican nominee finally 
put to rest any pretense that he would moderate his views for a general 
electorate. “There will be no amnesty,” Trump proclaimed to a cheering crowd.

He seemingly went further than that, making clear that he opposed so-called 
“touchback amnesty”, under which qualifying illegal immigrants could return to 
their home countries to apply for an expedited path to legal status: “Those who 
have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus 
visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be 
established.”


The speech came after Trump had spent weeks hinting at a “softening”. He even 
seemed to indicate in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity last week thathe 
might support a path to legal status 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news>
 for undocumented immigrants, though he quicklybacked off 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/>
 that statement.

There were even signs of a moderate tone earlier Wednesday when Trump met with 
Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration>
 on a surprise visit to Mexico City. At a press conference with Peña Nieto, 
Trump was restrained and talked about illegal immigration as a humanitarian 
crisis.

It’s clear now that the debate is over. There will not be a more moderate 
Trump, there will not be a more compassionate Trump. Instead, the same 
candidate whowarned the day he announced his run 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president>
, “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best … They’re 
bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists” is the one who will 
appear before voters in November.

“They might not know it yet,” Trump said mid-speech, but Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico> would “100%” be paying for the wall 
along the southern US border.


(More on why he didn’t, if he didn’t, bring that up during his meeting with 
Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto just hours earlier – which might have been 
just the moment! –here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration>
.)

Peña Nieto has also been speaking in the last hour or so, and it appears that 
the “thoughtful and substantitive [sic] conversation”Trump described 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-mexico-us-election-livedonald-trump-hillary-clinton-mexico-us-election-live?page=with:block-57c7859be4b0df5f040dc14b#block-57c7859be4b0df5f040dc14b>
 might not have been all that nice after all.

The Mexican president said in a television interview late on Wednesday evening 
that Trump’s policies posed grave threats to Mexico. Peña Nieto said he had 
invited Trump to visit to confront those threats.

It’s not clear how that’s working out.

Associated Press has had a go at fact-checking some of the claims in Trump’s 
speech tonight. It’s pretty long. Here are just a couple:

On people illegally in the US

Trump: “They’re treated better than our vets.”

The facts: People in the country illegally do not have the right to work, vote 
or receive most government benefits. A modest number have been exempted from 
deportation because of an Obama administration action, but most live under the 
risk of being removed from the country.

Veterans are guaranteed government health care and because almost all are 
citizens, the right to vote and other government benefits.

The quality of their care has been criticized by Trump and others, but people 
in the country illegally do not have equivalent rights to health care, except 
for emergency treatment. Public hospitals are required to provide emergency 
medical care regardless of immigration status.

On the number of people in the US illegally

Trump: “Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 
million. They have no idea.”

The facts: The government actually has an idea. The homeland security 
department estimates there are 11.4 million people in the United States 
illegally. Few in the immigration debate challenge that estimate.

The figure comes from an analysis of the most recent census data. The 
government compares the number of people whom the census reports as 
foreign-born with the number of people who have been admitted legally and 
gained citizenship. The most recent estimate dates to January 2012. It roughly 
matches the estimates of demographers from the Pew Foundation, which issues its 
estimates more rapidly than the government.

Experts believe the number of people in the US illegally has been steadily 
declining as Mexicans and others return to their home country and illegal 
border crossings dwindle.

Today in Campaign 2016

Let’s just focus on the key aspects of Donald Trump’s speech:
 Donald Trump. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP 
Donald Trump’s speech on immigration, anticipated by some to be a “softening” 
- as the candidate himself described it - on the issue, instead was a 
retrenchment in some of his most aggressive policies, including ideological 
tests for would-be visa applicants and the creation of a deportation force to 
hunt down undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, and included 
some new ones that have never been mentioned by a mainstream presidential 
candidate in the modern era.

Trump’s proposals included: the construction of a 2,000-mile border wall along 
the US-Mexico border, to be paid for by Mexico; the implementation of new 
restrictions on legal immigration into the US; a “sunset” on visa laws 
requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years; a ban on taxpayer funding 
for cities that don’t deport undocumented immigrants.

The tone of the speech was not dissimilar to that of a Breitbart News article 
on the subject - appropriate, given that Trump campaign operatives revealed to 
reporters after the speech’s commencement that former Breitbart chair Stephen 
Bannon was instrumental in the speech’s crafting.

The tone of the speech outpaces even Trump’s own aggressive rhetoric on 
undocumented immigrants, and effectively puts the lid on any claims that he is 
moving towards the center with less than 70 days to go until the general 
election.

Not all conservatives are pleased, however.

The alt right certainly enjoyed Trump’s speech tonight. While his return to a 
fire and brimstone approach to immigration reform may not necessarily appeal to 
swing voters, it did cast the attention of those fringe elements on the right 
who have long been drawn to Trump’s campaign.

Trump’s cozy relationship with this ideological fringe has long drawn 
scrutiny. However, with the hire of Steve Bannon, the head of the far right

 by Hillary Clinton.
 
Trump wasn’t the only one to have changed his tone after Wednesday afternoon’s 
conciliatory meet-the-press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration>
 alongside Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto.

Speaking to Mexican TV on Wednesday evening, Peña Nieto was rather more 
strident, Reuters reports:

Mexico’s president rebuked Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as a threat to his country 
just hours after painting a positive picture of talks the two held on Wednesday 
to try to defuse tensions over the US presidential hopeful’s anti-Mexican 
campaign rhetoric.

In a late evening television interview, an angry-looking Peña Nieto sought to 
defend himself against a broad swathe of criticism for his decision to invite 
the Republican candidate despite his repeated verbal attacks onMexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico>. 


“His policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not 
prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing,” Peña Nieto said. “That risk, 
that threat, must be confronted. I told him that is not the way to build a 
mutually beneficial relationship for both nations.”

During a joint news conference after their meeting, Trump said he and Peña 
Nieto had not discussed his demand that Mexico pay for the border wall.

But Peña Nieto later contradicted Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration>
, saying he had told the American that Mexico would not foot the bill, and he 
bristled during his television interview when asked why he had not made that 
clear at the news conference.

Reuters also reports, incidentally, that the two men apparently spoke to each 
other in English in their meeting.

Trailing Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
in the polls with fewer than 70 days to the election, Trump and campaign aides 
had recently fuelled expectations of a “softening” of immigration policy, 
prompting speculation about a flip-flop.

Instead Wednesday’s speech, which his campaign billed as a major policy 
address, represented an abrupt reversion to an aggressive tone just hours after 
an unfamiliar conciliatory timbre in Mexico City,where Trump met President 
Enrique Peña Nieto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration>
.

The GOP nominee geed up the crowd in Phoenix with grisly details about murders 
committed by undocumented immigrants. He brought on stage “angel moms” whose 
children had been killed.

He spoke of cancelling an Obama administration programme that gave work 
permits to about 800,000 young immigrants who came to the US as children – a 
stance likely to slam shut any chance of Latino outreach.

Anybody who entered the US illegally was subject to deportation and there 
should be detainers for immigrants who committed any crime, not just felonies, 
he said: “There will be no amnesty.”

Trump also promised ideological tests for would-be visa applicants, a “sunset” 
on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years, and a ban on 
taxpayer funding for cities that don’t deport undocumented immigrants.
 
Lorella Praeli, national Latino vote director for Hillary for America has this 
to say on what the campaign is calling Trump’s “anti-immigrant hateful speech”:

In his darkest speech yet, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> doubled down on his 
anti-immigrant rhetoric and attempted to divide communities by pitting people 
against each other and demonizing immigrants.

Trump committed to sending a new ‘deportation task force’ into American 
communities, rescinding the president’s executive actions to protectDREAMers 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act> and their families, building a wall 
that he continues to claim will be paid for by Mexico, and made clear that ‘
Operation Wetback 
<http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/11/11/455613993/it-came-up-in-the-debate-here-are-3-things-to-know-about-operation-wetback>
’ was not severe enough.

The only immigrants allowed in the future are those that pass Donald Trump’s 
own test of ‘desirability’.

Donald Trump once again showed us that he will continue his decades-long 
record of divisiveness and campaign of hate by pledging to forcibly remove 
every single undocumented immigrant from our country. He showed us, very 
clearly, what’s at stake in this election by painting a picture of his idea of 
America: one in which immigrants are not welcomed and one in which innocent 
families are torn apart.
 
One of the new policies outlined by Trump was “ideological certification” of 
immigrants to the US. It’s not entirely clear what that means, but here’s what 
he said in the speech:

Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, 
and this is so important, especially if you get the right people and we will 
get the right people, an ideological certification to make sure that those we 
are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.

There was no pivoting. There was no softening. There was just Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

In Trump’s much heralded immigration speech, the Republican nominee finally 
put to rest any pretense that he would moderate his views for a general 
electorate. “There will be no amnesty,” Trump proclaimed to a cheering crowd.

He seemingly went further than that, making clear that he opposed so-called 
“touchback amnesty”, under which qualifying illegal immigrants could return to 
their home countries to apply for an expedited path to legal status: “Those who 
have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus 
visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be 
established.”


The speech came after Trump had spent weeks hinting at a “softening”. He even 
seemed to indicate in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity last week thathe 
might support a path to legal status 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news>
 for undocumented immigrants, though he quicklybacked off 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/>
 that statement.

There were even signs of a moderate tone earlier Wednesday when Trump met with 
Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration>
 on a surprise visit to Mexico City. At a press conference with Peña Nieto, 
Trump was restrained and talked about illegal immigration as a humanitarian 
crisis.

It’s clear now that the debate is over. There will not be a more moderate 
Trump, there will not be a more compassionate Trump. Instead, the same 
candidate whowarned the day he announced his run 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president>
, “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best … They’re 
bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists” is the one who will 
appear before voters in November.

 
“They might not know it yet,” Trump said mid-speech, but Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico> would “100%” be paying for the wall 
along the southern US border.


(More on why he didn’t, if he didn’t, bring that up during his meeting with 
Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto just hours earlier – which might have been 
just the moment! –here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration>
.)

Peña Nieto has also been speaking in the last hour or so, and it appears that 
the “thoughtful and substantitive [sic] conversation”Trump described 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-mexico-us-election-livedonald-trump-hillary-clinton-mexico-us-election-live?page=with:block-57c7859be4b0df5f040dc14b#block-57c7859be4b0df5f040dc14b>
 might not have been all that nice after all.

The Mexican president said in a television interview late on Wednesday evening 
that Trump’s policies posed grave threats to Mexico. Peña Nieto said he had 
invited Trump to visit to confront those threats.

It’s not clear how that’s working out.
 
Trump spoke mainly from his teleprompter tonight, but couldn’t resist breaking 
off every now and then to add his own emphases and interjections:

Associated Press has had a go at fact-checking some of the claims in Trump’s 
speech tonight. It’s pretty long. Here are just a couple:

On people illegally in the US

Trump: “They’re treated better than our vets.”

The facts: People in the country illegally do not have the right to work, vote 
or receive most government benefits. A modest number have been exempted from 
deportation because of an Obama administration action, but most live under the 
risk of being removed from the country.

Veterans are guaranteed government health care and because almost all are 
citizens, the right to vote and other government benefits.

The quality of their care has been criticized by Trump and others, but people 
in the country illegally do not have equivalent rights to health care, except 
for emergency treatment. Public hospitals are required to provide emergency 
medical care regardless of immigration status.

On the number of people in the US illegally

Trump: “Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 
million. They have no idea.”

The facts: The government actually has an idea. The homeland security 
department estimates there are 11.4 million people in the United States 
illegally. Few in the immigration debate challenge that estimate.

The figure comes from an analysis of the most recent census data. The 
government compares the number of people whom the census reports as 
foreign-born with the number of people who have been admitted legally and 
gained citizenship. The most recent estimate dates to January 2012. It roughly 
matches the estimates of demographers from the Pew Foundation, which issues its 
estimates more rapidly than the government.

Experts believe the number of people in the US illegally has been steadily 
declining as Mexicans and others return to their home country and illegal 
border crossings dwindle.
 
Let’s just focus on the key aspects of Donald Trump’s speech:

Donald Trump’s speech on immigration, anticipated by some to be a “softening” 
- as the candidate himself described it - on the issue, instead was a 
retrenchment in some of his most aggressive policies, including ideological 
tests for would-be visa applicants and the creation of a deportation force to 
hunt down undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, and included 
some new ones that have never been mentioned by a mainstream presidential 
candidate in the modern era.

Trump’s proposals included: the construction of a 2,000-mile border wall along 
the US-Mexico border, to be paid for by Mexico; the implementation of new 
restrictions on legal immigration into the US; a “sunset” on visa laws 
requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years; a ban on taxpayer funding 
for cities that don’t deport undocumented immigrants.

The tone of the speech was not dissimilar to that of a Breitbart News article 
on the subject - appropriate, given that Trump campaign operatives revealed to 
reporters after the speech’s commencement that former Breitbart chair Stephen 
Bannon was instrumental in the speech’s crafting.

The tone of the speech outpaces even Trump’s own aggressive rhetoric on 
undocumented immigrants, and effectively puts the lid on any claims that he is 
moving towards the center with less than 70 days to go until the general 
election.

Not all conservatives are pleased, however.
