Why Hastings?
Move over Brighton … With a new cookery school, artisan shops, gourmet food 
and modern art, the Sussex seaside town has gone cool. And this summer its 
pier, in the final stages of a £14m renovation, will add film festivals and 
farmers’ markets to the mix.

So what can I do?
A day out in Hastings once meant crazy golf and funiculars. While those 
options remain, visitors can now take seafood cookery lessons atClassroom on 
the Coast <http://www.hastingsflag.org/project/classroom-coast> or take in the 
jet-blackJerwood Gallery 
<http://www.jerwoodgallery.org/whatson/23/beside-the-seaside>, where Beside The 
Seaside, an exhibition by Chantal Joffe, is showing until 12 April.

Any decent shopping?
Not half. Linked by twittens (lanes), the Old Town has recently seen a clump 
of quality boutiques open. Try Shimizu <http://www.shimizuflowers.com/> for 
flowers,Penbuckles <https://www.facebook.com/Penbuckles> deli for cheese, Warp 
& Weft <http://warpandweftstyling.com/> for chic clothes, and Butler’s Emporium 
<http://www.butlersemporium.com/#> for pretty much everything else.
