, Donald Trump’s gastroenterologist implied that he has had access to Hillary 
Clinton’s medical records, and what he has seen of the former secretary of 
state’s medical history is “really not so good”. The admission by Dr. Harold 
Bornstein - a likely violation of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act, if Bornstein is indeed referring to Clinton’s private 
medical records - came as part of a longer interview with MSNBC in which 
Bornstein attempted to play down the four-paragraph letter he penned in 
December that claimed Trump “will be the healthiest individual ever elected to 
the presidency” if he is elected. Facebook

Debbie Wasserman Schultz wins primary

Florida congresswoman and former head of the Democratic National Committee 
Debbie Wasserman Schultz has won her Democratic primary, according to the 
Associated Press, winning 58% of the vote in Florida’s 23rd District with 56% 
of precincts reporting, compared to 43% for law professor Tim Canova.

Canova raised more than $3m after Vermont senator Bernie Sanders called for 
his election following Schultz’s resignation from the chairship of the DNC 
after leaked emails revealed a climate of anti-Sanders sentiment in the upper 
echelons of the DNC.

primary:

Marco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> has launched his 
political comeback with a decisive victory in the Florida primary that sets up 
a battle with Democrats for control of the US Senate in November.


Despite announcing his decision to seek re-election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/marco-rubio-re-election-florida-senate-seat>
 only two months ago, the freshman senator saw off a challenge from 
Trump-supporting real estate developer Carlos Beruff to win the Republican 
nomination by a comfortable 71 percentage points to 19 in Tuesday’s contest.

Previously, Rubio had announced his retirement from politics after losing his 
home state to Trump by some 20 points in the presidential primary election. He 
was persuaded to change his mind as Republican leaders in Washington sensed 
that the senate race in the state could prove pivotal.

On Tuesday night the Associated Press also projected Florida 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida> congressman Patrick Murphy had 
won the Democratic nomination to run for the Senate – by a margin of 59 to 18 
percentage points. It sets up a tight race with Rubio in November, who is now 
narrow favourite to hold the state and could prevent Democrats netting the four 
seats nationwide they may need to swing control of the Senate.

Murphy saw off a lackluster challenge from a once promising leftwing fireband, 
Alan Grayson, who was badly damaged bydomestic abuse allegations 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/alan-grayson-wife-florida-226090> and 
reacted angrily 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/alan-grayson-politico-reporter-226219> 
to probes into his background.

It looked to be a disappointing night overall for the progressive wing of the 
Democratic party, which had also hoped to unseat the former Democratic National 
Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after she was seen to take sides 
against Bernie Sanders in the presidential race.


Sanders endorsed the anti-establishment candidate Tim Canova in the 23rd House 
District around Miami, but he was trailing Wasserman Schulz by some 16 
percentage points by the time of the Senate declarations.

Canova, who did not receive much direct support from Sanders 
<http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/canova-revolution-bernie-sanders-debbie-wasserman-schultz/497807/>
, hinted at a possible concession as soon as the polls closed,telling supporters
 <https://twitter.com/Tim_Canova/status/770759017702580225>: “No matter what 
happens, we should all be proud of what we’ve accomplished in a short period of 
time.”

Trump campaign manager in 2008: Clinton and Obama argued 'whether she should 
let him sit on the back of the bus'

Donald Trump’s new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said that “Hillary and 
Obama were arguing about whether she should let him sit on the back of the bus 
of her presidential ticket” in an appearance on Larry King Live in 2008, a 
comment with racial undertones that the Democratic Coalition Against Trump is 
emphasizing in a video released of the remarks.

Report: Donald Trump considering trip to Mexico

The Washington Post reports 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-considers-last-minute-meeting-in-mexico-with-the-countrys-president/2016/08/30/5a694790-6f12-11e6-9705-23e51a2f424d_story.html?postshare=4941472604369934&tid=ss_tw>
 that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is considering a last-minute 
meeting with Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto tomorrow in Mexico City, 
hours before he is scheduled to deliver a major address on immigration in 
Phoenix aimed at clarifying his increasingly murky stance on the issue.

States. Photograph: STRINGER/Reuters 
Talks on logistics and security for the candidate’s potential visit are still 
ongoing between Trump’s campaign team and the Mexican government. Trump is 
scheduled to appear at fundraisers in California tomorrow morning, as well as 
deliver his immigration address in Phoenix at 6pm local time (9pm ET). The trip 
to Mexico City to meet with Nieto - who has previously invited Trump to debate 
him in Mexico - would occur somewhere in the middle of the day.

The trip was first broached with the US embassy in Mexico City earlier this 
week, a fast-tracking of an international visit by an American presidential 
candidate that is typically planned over the course of weeks, not days.

Trump’s approval ratings among Latino voters are historically bad, and his 
at-this-point theoretical relationship with Nieto’s government is even worse: 
Trump has long pledged to force Mexico to pay for a 2,000-mile border wall 
along the US-Mexico border, a suggestion Nieto responded to coldly.

“No way,” Nieto told CNN 
<http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/07/10/mexican-president-enrique-pena-nieto-trump-wall-sot-gps.cnn>
 earlier this year.

Republican Governor Chris Christie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chris-christie> today vetoed an attempt to 
raise New Jersey’s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour in the next year and to at 
least $15 an hour over the next five.

Christie said raising the minimum wage would burden small businesses and 
described the proposal as the “heavy hand of government”.

Announcing his decision at an event at a market in Pennington, the governor 
said raising pay was the job of business owners.

“All of this sounds great, raising the minimum wage, when you’re spending 
someone else’s money,” he said.

Democrats, who control the statehouse, and liberal groups have put the 
legislation at the center of their agenda. The legislature sent Christie the 
measure in June. Democratic leaders say they will pursue a constitutional 
amendment to raise the minimum wage without the need for Christie’s approval.

“The governor’s actions have only served to temporarily thwart a unified 
effort to raiseNew Jersey <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/new-jersey> 
families and provide a much needed boost to our economy,” said Analilia Mejia, 
director of the left-leaning group NJ Working Families.

Marco Rubio wins Florida senate primary

Republican senator and onetime presidential candidate Marco Rubio has won his 
primary in Florida this evening, and is set to face off against Florida 
congressman Patrick Murphy in the general election.

At the time the Associated Press called the race, Rubio had won 71% of the 
vote to developer Carlos Beruff’s 20%; Murphy had won 59% to congressman Alan 
Grayson’s 18% and Pam Keith’s 15%.

Rubio had originally intended to retire in the event of his race for the White 
House ending unsuccessfully, but his decision in June to re-enter the race 
nearly cleared the field of would-be Republican nominees.

The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs has more on former Texas governor Rick Perry joining 
the cast of Dancing With the Stars:

Rick Perry may have infamously forgotten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/10/rick-perry-forgets-agency-scrap> 
the third government agency he wanted to abolish in 2011 – but he’ll need to 
remember his dancing shoes this fall.


The three-term governor of Texas and two-time failed Republican presidential 
candidate is appearing on the reality show Dancing With The Stars. According to
a report from Entertainment Tonight 
<http://www.etonline.com/news/196777_dancing_with_the_stars_derek_hough_confirms_return_cheryl_burke_set/>
,Perry will join Olympian Ryan Lochte, one-hit rapper Vanilla Ice and former 
NFL star Calvin Johnson on the televised dance competition.

Although the show has been televised for 23 seasons, Perry will be only the 
second former elected official to take his turn twirling on stage.

However, he won’t be the first competitor with close ties to the GOP. Past 
seasons have featured the former House majority leader Tom DeLay, who resigned 
in 2006 after being charged with campaign finance violations, as well as Sarah 
Palin’s daughter Bristol, and Antonio Sabato Jr, a former soap opera actor who 
spoke in support ofDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in Cleveland in July.

In the show’s most recent season Marla Maples, Trump’s ex-wife, finished 10th 
behind former NFL player Doug Flutie and ahead of actor Mischa Barton.

Poll: 31% of Trump supporters support wall along Atlantic Ocean

In the darkest days of this presidential campaign, political reporters have 
come to rely on the good people at Public Policy Polling to answer the 
questions none of us thought to ask: How many people would choose being crushed 
by a giant meteor instead of electing Donald Trump orHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>? Who plans on voting for 
Deez Nuts in the presidential election? Who’s winning, Jill Stein or Harambe?
PublicPolicyPolling (@ppppolls) 
Support for President: Gary Johnson 6%, Harambe 5%, Jill Stein 2%

<https://twitter.com/ppppolls/status/759579980925927424> 
In its latest poll 
<http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/08/clinton-national-lead-steady.html>
, PPP found that in addition to widely supporting Trump’s signature policy 
proposal of building a wall along America’s border with Mexico, nearly one in 
three - 31% - of the Republican presidential nominee’s followers support 
building a wall along the Atlantic Ocean to keep Muslims from entering the 
country from the Middle East.

PPP found that 52% are opposed to that idea.

Donald Trump's doctor: I've seen Hillary Clinton's medical history, and it's 
'not so good'

In an interview with MSNBC 
<http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/trump-s-doctor-softens-on-trump-s-health-754038339539>
, Donald Trump’s gastroenterologist implied that he has had access to Hillary 
Clinton’s medical records, and what he has seen of the former secretary of 
state’s medical history is “really not so good”.

The admission by Dr. Harold Bornstein - a likely violation of the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, if Bornstein is indeed referring 
to Clinton’s private medical records - came as part of a longer interview with 
MSNBC in which Bornstein attempted to play down the four-paragraph letter he 
penned in December that claimed Trump “will be the healthiest individual ever 
elected to the presidency” if he is elected.

That letter, penned in five minutes as he awaited a Trump Organization 
limousine, was the result of a request from Trump himself, Bornstein told MSNBC:

“I guess he called and he said the Clinton organization was going to publish a 
letter on her health, and I know her physician, and I know some of her health 
history, which is really not so good, so I said ‘Why not. I would do that for 
you too,’” Bornstein said.

The letter describing Trump as profoundly healthy was released in response to 
letter released by Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clinton’s personal physician, that 
discussed her own health history.

Sean Hannity went on an extended rant on his radio program today blaming the 
#NeverTrump movement for the Republican presidential nominee’s polling woes, 
telling conservative commentators and politicians like Glenn Beck and Texas 
senator Ted Cruz that ifHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> wins the presidential 
election this November, it will be on their heads.

“You own Hillary Clinton. National Review, you own it. Glenn Beck, you own it. 
Ted Cruz, you own it,” said Hannity, a Trump supporter. “She wins, I’m blaming 
all of you,, you own all of her policies.”

“Well, let me just say to all of you,” Hannity continued, after naming 
numerous members of the Republican party who have disowned Trump. “And that 
includes the commentator class. That includes the Jonah Goldberg class, that 
includes radio talk show hosts. Glenn Beck is like on a - it’s a holy war for 
him at this point. I mean, he’s off the rails attacking me every day. Blaming 
me for Trump. Well, no. I was fair to everybody, Glenn. Whether you want to 
admit it or not. I know I was fair. My conscience is clear. And I, frankly, I’m 
proud to pull the lever forDonald Trump

The pharmaceutical company Mylan is facing more political pressure to confront 
the price hike of EpiPen after 20 US senators, includingElizabeth Warren 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren> and Bernie Sanders, sent 
an open letter on Tuesday to the company criticising its “exorbitantly 
expensive” price hikes.

Reports emerged last week that the company had implemented a series of gradual 
price increases 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/24/epipen-ceo-hiked-prices-heather-bresch-mylan>
 inflating the price of the drug from $56.64 to $317.82, a 461% increase in 
cost since Mylan acquired the rights to EpiPen in 2007. During that same time, 
Heather Bresch, chief executive officer of Mylan, saw her pay rise $2,453,456to

Debbie Wasserman Schultz has won her Democratic primary, according to the 
Associated Press, winning 58% of the vote in Florida’s 23rd District with 56% 
of precincts reporting, compared to 43% for law professor Tim Canova.

Canova raised more than $3m after Vermont senator Bernie Sanders called for 
his election following Schultz’s resignation from the chairship of the DNC 
after leaked emails revealed a climate of anti-Sanders sentiment in the upper 
echelons of the DNC.

Marco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> has launched his 
political comeback with a decisive victory in the Florida primary that sets up 
a battle with Democrats for control of the US Senate in November.


Despite announcing his decision to seek re-election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/marco-rubio-re-election-florida-senate-seat>
 only two months ago, the freshman senator saw off a challenge from 
Trump-supporting real estate developer Carlos Beruff to win the Republican 
nomination by a comfortable 71 percentage points to 19 in Tuesday’s contest.

Previously, Rubio had announced his retirement from politics after losing his 
home state to Trump by some 20 points in the presidential primary election. He 
was persuaded to change his mind as Republican leaders in Washington sensed 
that the senate race in the state could prove pivotal.

On Tuesday night the Associated Press also projected Florida 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida> congressman Patrick Murphy had 
won the Democratic nomination to run for the Senate – by a margin of 59 to 18 
percentage points. It sets up a tight race with Rubio in November, who is now 
narrow favourite to hold the state and could prevent Democrats netting the four 
seats nationwide they may need to swing control of the Senate.

Murphy saw off a lackluster challenge from a once promising leftwing fireband, 
Alan Grayson, who was badly damaged bydomestic abuse allegations 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/alan-grayson-wife-florida-226090> and 
reacted angrily 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/alan-grayson-politico-reporter-226219> 
to probes into his background.

It looked to be a disappointing night overall for the progressive wing of the 
Democratic party, which had also hoped to unseat the former Democratic National 
Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after she was seen to take sides 
against Bernie Sanders in the presidential race.


Sanders endorsed the anti-establishment candidate Tim Canova in the 23rd House 
District around Miami, but he was trailing Wasserman Schulz by some 16 
percentage points by the time of the Senate declarations.

Canova, who did not receive much direct support from Sanders 
<http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/canova-revolution-bernie-sanders-debbie-wasserman-schultz/497807/>
, hinted at a possible concession as soon as the polls closed,telling supporters
 <https://twitter.com/Tim_Canova/status/770759017702580225>: “No matter what 
happens, we should all be proud of what we’ve accomplished in a short period of 
time.”

Donald Trump’s new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said that “Hillary and 
Obama were arguing about whether she should let him sit on the back of the bus 
of her presidential ticket” in an appearance on Larry King Live in 2008, a 
comment with racial undertones that the Democratic Coalition Against Trump is 
emphasizing in a video released of the remarks.

 that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is considering a last-minute 
meeting with Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto tomorrow in Mexico City, 
hours before he is scheduled to deliver a major address on immigration in 
Phoenix aimed at clarifying his increasingly murky stance on the issue.

Talks on logistics and security for the candidate’s potential visit are still 
ongoing between Trump’s campaign team and the Mexican government. Trump is 
scheduled to appear at fundraisers in California tomorrow morning, as well as 
deliver his immigration address in Phoenix at 6pm local time (9pm ET). The trip 
to Mexico City to meet with Nieto - who has previously invited Trump to debate 
him in Mexico - would occur somewhere in the middle of the day.

The trip was first broached with the US embassy in Mexico City earlier this 
week, a fast-tracking of an international visit by an American presidential 
candidate that is typically planned over the course of weeks, not days.

Trump’s approval ratings among Latino voters are historically bad, and his 
at-this-point theoretical relationship with Nieto’s government is even worse: 
Trump has long pledged to force Mexico to pay for a 2,000-mile border wall 
along the US-Mexico border, a suggestion Nieto responded to coldly.

“No way,” Nieto told CNN 
<http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/07/10/mexican-president-enrique-pena-nieto-trump-wall-sot-gps.cnn>
 earlier this year.

Republican Governor Chris Christie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chris-christie> today vetoed an attempt to 
raise New Jersey’s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour in the next year and to at 
least $15 an hour over the next five.

Christie said raising the minimum wage would burden small businesses and 
described the proposal as the “heavy hand of government”.

Announcing his decision at an event at a market in Pennington, the governor 
said raising pay was the job of business owners.

“All of this sounds great, raising the minimum wage, when you’re spending 
someone else’s money,” he said.

Democrats, who control the statehouse, and liberal groups have put the 
legislation at the center of their agenda. The legislature sent Christie the 
measure in June. Democratic leaders say they will pursue a constitutional 
amendment to raise the minimum wage without the need for Christie’s approval.

“The governor’s actions have only served to temporarily thwart a unified 
effort to raiseNew Jersey <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/new-jersey> 
families and provide a much needed boost to our economy,” said Analilia Mejia, 
director of the left-leaning group NJ Working Families.

Republican senator and onetime presidential candidate Marco Rubio has won his 
primary in Florida this evening, and is set to face off against Florida 
congressman Patrick Murphy in the general election.

At the time the Associated Press called the race, Rubio had won 71% of the 
vote to developer Carlos Beruff’s 20%; Murphy had won 59% to congressman Alan 
Grayson’s 18% and Pam Keith’s 15%.

Rubio had originally intended to retire in the event of his race for the White 
House ending unsuccessfully, but his decision in June to re-enter the race 
nearly cleared the field of would-be Republican nominees.

the third government agency he wanted to abolish in 2011 – but he’ll need to 
remember his dancing shoes this fall.


The three-term governor of Texas and two-time failed Republican presidential 
candidate is appearing on the reality show Dancing With The Stars. According to
a report from Entertainment Tonight 
<http://www.etonline.com/news/196777_dancing_with_the_stars_derek_hough_confirms_return_cheryl_burke_set/>
,Perry will join Olympian Ryan Lochte, one-hit rapper Vanilla Ice and former 
NFL star Calvin Johnson on the televised dance competition.

Although the show has been televised for 23 seasons, Perry will be only the 
second former elected official to take his turn twirling on stage.

However, he won’t be the first competitor with close ties to the GOP. Past 
seasons have featured the former House majority leader Tom DeLay, who resigned 
in 2006 after being charged with campaign finance violations, as well as Sarah 
Palin’s daughter Bristol, and Antonio Sabato Jr, a former soap opera actor who 
spoke in support ofDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in Cleveland in July.

In the show’s most recent season Marla Maples, Trump’s ex-wife, finished 10th 
behind former NFL player Doug Flutie and ahead of actor Mischa Barton.

, PPP found that in addition to widely supporting Trump’s signature policy 
proposal of building a wall along America’s border with Mexico, nearly one in 
three - 31% - of the Republican presidential nominee’s followers support 
building a wall along the Atlantic Ocean to keep Muslims from entering the 
country from the Middle East.

PPP found that 52% are opposed to that idea.

penned in December that claimed Trump “will be the healthiest individual ever 
elected to the presidency” if he is elected.

That letter, penned in five minutes as he awaited a Trump Organization 
limousine, was the result of a request from Trump himself, Bornstein told MSNBC:

“I guess he called and he said the Clinton organization was going to publish a 
letter on her health, and I know her physician, and I know some of her health 
history, which is really not so good, so I said ‘Why not. I would do that for 
you too,’” Bornstein said.

The letter describing Trump as profoundly healthy was released in response to 
letter released by Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clinton’s personal physician, that 
discussed her own health history.

The pharmaceutical company Mylan is facing more political pressure to confront 
the price hike of EpiPen after 20 US senators, includingElizabeth Warren 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren> and Bernie Sanders, sent 
an open letter on Tuesday to the company criticising its “exorbitantly 
expensive” price hikes.

Reports emerged last week that the company had implemented a series of gradual 
price increases 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/24/epipen-ceo-hiked-prices-heather-bresch-mylan>
 inflating the price of the drug from $56.64 to $317.82, a 461% increase in 
cost since Mylan acquired the rights to EpiPen in 2007. During that same time, 
Heather Bresch, chief executive officer of Mylan, saw her pay rise $2,453,456to 
$18,931,068 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/mylan-execs-gave-themselves-raises-they-hiked-epipen-prices-n636591?cid=sm_fb>
, a 671% increase. Last week, she sold 100,200 of her shares 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/27/mylan-ceo-sold-stock-epipen-price-hike-heather-bresch>
 in the company for more than $5m.

“The EpiPen auto-injector delivers a life-saving dose of epinephrine to 
patients suffering from anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic shock can lead to serious 
injury or death if untreated; thus, making sure the EpiPen is readily available 
for use is a critical part of life for millions of Americans living with severe

life-saving combination product is in jeopardy for many Americans.

“Mylan’s near monopoly on the epinephrine auto-injector market has allowed you 
to increase prices well beyond those that are justified by any increase in the
