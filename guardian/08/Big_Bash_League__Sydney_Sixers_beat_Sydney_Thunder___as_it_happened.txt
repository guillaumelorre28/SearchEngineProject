Pink Sydney wins by nine wickets

In the battle of the hues, it’s the rose that prevails. Magentlemen. Did it 
easy in the end, Henriques’ 76 from 41 providing the muscle, Hughes with 54 
from 49 providing the structural integrity. But the Greens made life hard for 
themselves by missing a couple of chances to dismiss Henriques, including first 
ball, and couldn’t bring any more pressure to bear on the Pinks’ dicey batting 
order.

The Thunder’s reasonable position at the halfway mark was down to BBL debutant 
Ryan Gibson, who will turn 23 in the next fortnight. When he was flying with 
Eoin Morgan, the Thunder were on for a huge total, but that was a briefly 
passing illlusion. In the end it was down to some fine tail-end batting from 
Cummins and McKay that got them close to a defensible total, but in the end 
that defence fell apart.

Henriques, no surprises, is man of the match. Though I’m impressed they 
thought outside the box and gave that award to Asad Shafiq after the Pakistan 
Test concluded. Good move for a fine performance.

18th over: Sixers 160-1 (Hughes 54, Henriques 76)

With only 10 runs needed, and three overs to bowl, Henriques has found his 
range. Even Russell is punished now, a simple straight bat slog that flies over 
wide long-on for six. A couple of singles, the last of them requiring a dive at 
the non-striker’s end, and from the last ball of the over, the win is theirs.

17th over: Sixers 150-1 (Hughes 52, Henriques 68)

Green has been so tidy, but this is a bad time for him to concede his first 
four of the night. Moises slams him dead straight, second ball, after Hughes 
had taken a single. It’s also a bad time for him to go for his first six, which 
happens next ball as the pressure sees him delivery a full toss, and Henriques 
bends his knees and slogs across the line over wide long-on. While we’re at it, 
it’s probably a bad time for Green to go for his second six, which happens as 
Henriques goes straight again but this time lifts the ball. His 68 have come 
from 38 balls. The partnership is 105

16th over: Sixers 131-1 (Hughes 50, Henriques 51)

Big guns required, with the Sixers so close: Russell comes back on to bowl. 
Brilliant couple of yorkers, then a shorter ball that beats Hughes’ attempted 
glide. Nearly nicked it. Hughes gets a single and his own fifty from the last 
ball of the over, that milestone coming in 44 balls, but there are only three 
runs from the over.

29 needed from 24.

15th over: Sixers 128-1 (Hughes 48, Henriques 50)


Slightly dicey, but Hughes’ skewed drive just clears Russell who has come up 
to mid-on. Four runs, then Hughes cracks a drive into Henriques’ foot at the 
non-striker’s end, meaning they only get a single. Saved, Moises. He celebrates 
with a single of his own that raises his fifty from 31 balls.

14th over: Sixers 120-1 (Hughes 42, Henriques 49)


He’s had his lives, now it’s Moises’ time to shine. Six, as he wallops Cummins 
on the pull shot down over wide long-on.Four, edged away fine through third man.
Four, gone through cover. Two more runs with another pull, then four to close 
the over as Henriques got room to cut and proved he can play that shot too. 
What a contrast for Cummins to how he started. 21 from the over, 20 of those to 
Henriques, and the required rate plummets to about 6.6.

13th over: Sixers 99-1 (Hughes 41, Henriques 29)

And another cock-up! Henriques should have out about 40 times now, this time 
his pull shot hanging in the air over mid-on. Cummins running back called for 
the catch when it should always have belonged to Russell coming up from 
long-on. Russell respected the call, Cummins couldn’t backtrack far enough, and 
can only fingertip the ball away as he lunges back for it. Hughes tells his 
partner to wait at the other end, and swings McKay away for a pair of 
boundaries over the leg side.

12th over: Sixers 89-1 (Hughes 32, Henriques 28)


More garbage from the Thunder. What should have been a 6-run over becomes 10 
runs, as Sandhu at short third man mucks up a simple stop. Hughes played a late 
cut straight to him, but the ball goes through for four. Henriques had a four 
saved by Patterson with a slide at backward point just before that, but they 
still got three in that case.

11th over: Sixers 79-1 (Hughes 26, Henriques 24)

Green is bowling so well. Off-spin from around the wicket, he’s mostly darting 
the ball, but his accuracy and his field placements are enough to esnurre that 
the batsmen can’t get him away. Two dots that Henriques can only slam to cover, 
and he’s frustrated enough to push harder down to lng on, not entirely in 
control. Three more singles follow. Three overs from Green for 13 runs.

10th over: Sixers 75-1 (Hughes 24, Henriques 22)


Lovely bit of skill from Moises Henriques, the Sixers captain, as he watches 
Fawad’s leg-break turn past the off stump, then catches up with it and runs it 
fine through third man for four. Thee singles around that, the boundary helps 
Pink Sydney keep more or less up with the rate.


England lost those last two wickets to Ravindra Jadeja, by the way, to lose 
that Test by an innings and 75 runs. Check our cricket page for all the updates.

8th over: Sixers 63-1 (Hughes 21, Henriques 13)


Spoke too soon. Fawad Ahmed is less convincing, dishing up a wide and a 
long-hop that gets pulled for four. Eight from the over, which is roughly the 
rate that the Sixers are at and what they need through the innings.

6th over: Sixers 51-1 (Hughes 18, Henriques 5)

Should have had two in two, Russell, but McKay makes a shocking effort at the 
catch. Fielding at short fine leg, Henriques gloved the ball on a gentle lob, 
and McKay coming across to his right somehow managed to be too slow, fall over, 
throw one hand out, and be nowhere near the ball. That’s just about the worst 
effort to get to a ball I can remember. Henriques rubs it in by cutting the 
last ball, a rank wide one for four.

WICKET! Roy c Cummins b Russell 27

Show’s over for now, as Andre Russell comes back, sends down a scrambly slower 
ball and Roy can only lift it to mid-on.

5th over: Sixers 41-0 (Hughes 17, Roy 23)

Not to be outdone, Hughes hooks as well and swings away six more! Sandhu the 
victim this time, and that ball goes high over fine leg from the first of the 
over. Hughes gets two from the next ball, then a couple of singles follow.

4th over: Sixers 31-0 (Hughes 8, Roy 22)


Whack! That’s probably the biggest hit of the night. Cummins gives plenty of 
pace and Roy makes use of all of it. it wasn’t that short but Roy was planning 
for the pull shot and gave it the fullest possible swing. Picked the ball up 
and sent it in a very high arc that dropped genuinely towards the back of the 
stand out on the on-side. That came just after pulling four through fine leg.

3rd over: Sixers 20-0 (Hughes 7, Roy 12)

Hi, I’m Jason Roy, have you seen what I can do? That’s pretty special, first a 
drive over mid-on for four, then a kneeling lap shot over fine leg for the 
same. Clint McKay is the bowler, who Ricky Ponting can barely remember playing 
a Test with once many moons ago.

No1 thing I like about BBL: national selector Mark Waugh having no idea who 
any of the players are.

2nd over: Sixers 10-0 (Hughes 6, Roy 3)

Russell also starting well and at pace. Fierce short ball, and a fuller one 
that has Roby charging and missing and by all rights deserving to be bowled, 
but it clears the stumps. A wide and three singles the only product from the 
over, as the Sixers show they’re not wanting to go completely nuts from the 
outset.

1st over: Sixers 6-0 (Hughes 5, Roy 1)

Cummins opens up the bowling. Serious pace straight away. Some good lines as 
well. Just a couple of singles from the first five balls, then hughes nicks a 
lucky four through third man.

Pink Sydney will chase 160 to win

Pretty decent total from Green Sydney in the end - their top order stuttered 
but produced just enough good overs, and their lower order was able to fill in 
the blanks. 160 is a fairly par score for most BBL games - teams would fancy 
their chances of running it down, but it can certainly be defended. The Pinkos 
don’t have a super strong batting line-up, with a lot of all-rounders, so if 
the Greens can subdue Jason Roy and Sam Billings, the English imports, then the 
rest may struggle. Your thoughts?

20th over: Sydney Thunder 159-8 (McKay 14, Sandhu 1)


Great closing over from Clint McKay, who can bat better than you’d expect. I 
remember him being in a partnership of 60-plus runs with James Faulkner, I 
think, in which McKay scored something like 1 run. Should find the details 
later. But he can do it himself when he’s the senior man, and he is here. The 
two singles and the two dots in Abbott’s over are fine, but the inside edge 
through fine leg for four and the length ball bashed over midwicket for six do 
somewhat spoil the gloss.

WICKET! Cummins c Billings b Dwarshuis 30

19th over: Sydney Thunder 147-8 (McKay 3, Sandhu 0)


More hectic batting here: three singles, then Cummins latches onto another 
one, this time on the straight drive fro Dwarshuis, and thumps it waaaaaay down 
the ground dead straight for six more. Can hit. Oh boy. Next ball he tries the 
same shot, and it just hangs enough for long-on and long-off to converage and 
hang onto the catch inside the rope.

18th over: Sydney Thunder 138-7 (Cummins 23, McKay 1)


EVERYBODY KNOWS I’M A MOTHERTRUCKIN’ MONSTER. That really was one from 
Cummins, got down on one knee and absolutely launches Botha into low-earth 
orbit and then back down into the crowd way beyond midwicket. He’d tried it 
earlier in the over and missed completely, the over conceded only a couple of 
singles and a wide to that point, but Cummins finishes it with that beast. 
Kanye bat, they asked? Sure can.


Adil Rashid is out in Chennai, England eight down with 14 overs to survive.

17th over: Sydney Thunder 129-7 (Cummins 16, McKay 0)

Happy days for Dwarshuis, after Cummins crushed him over long-on with a 
powerful pull shot to start the over. Can bat, Cummins. I did the BBC 
commentary of him making 86 not out in a tour game for Australia against 
Northamptonshire in 2015, was the best by a mile. Fifth ball gets the wicket, 
followed by a wide. Nine from the over in total.

WICKET! Gibson c Billings b Dwarshuis 53

If you can keep your head when all about you... That was Gibson today, who 
opened the batting and then had to carry it as his top order teammates fell by 
the wayside. Finally he makes a mistake as he mistimes a pull, and Billings 
leaps forward to claim the lobbed ball low at midwicket.

16th over: Sydney Thunder 120-6 (Gibson 53, Cummins 8)


He’s found the way to beat Botha! A switch-hit from Gibson, he gets it very 
fine through third man and runs it away for four. Three singles as well from 
the over, they’re building up something here. Then Gibson finishes it with a 
couple of twos to midwicket, the first of which brings up his half-century from 
41 balls. It’s been a fine hand in a crumbling innings.

15th over: Sydney Thunder 109-6 (Gibson 44, Cummins 6)

Ryan Gibson is playing a gem here tonight. A few singles from the over, then 
he drives Bollinger’s slower ball through cover for four. Here’s a glimpse from 
the crowd tonight. Meanwhile England is trying to bat out a thriller in 
Chennai, and India is swarming them.Check that OBO here

14th over: Sydney Thunder 102-6 (Gibson 39, Cummins 4)

Abbott should have a tidy over, but there’s an unorthodox boundary. Gibson 
gets a single, Hughes throws at the non-striker’s end and gives up four 
overthrows. Nine from the voer in the end, the Thunder needed that.

Enjoying this description of the game tonight, and the league in general.

13th over: Sydney Thunder 93-6 (Gibson 32, Cummins 2)

Unusual to expect Patrick Cummins to save you with the bat, but he’ll have to 
do some work here. Botha isn’t giving much away, spin still keeping control. 
Six runs from the over, four singles and a brace.

12th over: Sydney Thunder 87-6 (Gibson 28, Cummins 0)

A wide from Bollinger ends an over that involved a fair old comeback. Belted 
by Russell through third man and then midwicket, Bollinger grabbed two wickets 
thereafter. Gibson is still around, he could carry his bat here. The Thunder 
have lost 5 for 15.

WICKET! Green c Hughes b Bollinger 0

Nothing Green can stay. Not even something as radiant as Chris Green. The 
Sixers are excited as he walks out, they bring in a slip, and he duly edges his 
second ball there.

WICKET! Russell c Haddin b Bollinger 9

Massive strike for the Sixers: Russell had just belted two boundaries, and was 
lining up a third by backing away and trying to cut. Got an edge instead, it 
tailed earthwards as it neared Haddin, but he got down low to take it. The 
commentators can now stop losing their minds over Russell’s all-black bat.

11th over: Sydney Thunder 78-4 (Gibson 28, Russell 1)

SOK finishes off a brilliant spell, 1 for 16 from his four overs. Two singles 
from this one, then Gibson chops a ball accidentally between the wicketkeeper’s 
legs for two.

10th over: Sydney Thunder 74-4 (Gibson 25, Russell 0)


A double-wicket maiden to Mennie. In a T20. Where his last over got pounded. 
Anyone care to tell me it’s a funny game?

“Morning OBO!” says Ben Copsey, inviting furore as to whether that was a 
greeting or a statement. “As I go into work I’m wondering about these team 
names - Sydney Sixers? Why not cut out the middle man and just call them ‘the 
cricketmen’ or go really simple with just ‘team’?”

Mostly we just got with Green Sydney and Pink Sydney around here, but we are 
simple people with simple minds.

WICKET! Doran lbw Mennie 0

Think we can call this a comeback over? Anyone? Anyone? Yes? Ok then. Doran 
walks out, tries to work his second ball to leg, and misses it straight in 
front. Max Gawwwwwn.

WICKET! Rohrer c Roy b Mennie 2

Get ready to voice your rendition of ‘whadddddacatch!’ It was pretty spesh. 
Rohrer, left-hander, gets some width from Mennie. Times a late cut very nicely, 
but the flying ball is intercepted by a horizontal Jason Roy, who looms into 
the frame like an Empire spaceship and hauls it in with his tractor beam.

winning runs last year in the final.

WICKET! Morgan c Haddin b Botha 26

“Botha, first ball in the Big Bash as an Australian, and he sends back the 
Irishman who plays for England.” Not bad from Mark Howard. Botha spins a ball 
across the left-handed Morgan, who gets an inside edge as he tries to flip 
through square. Haddin snares it, good take. El Capitan is sunk.

8th over: Sydney Thunder 71-1 (Gibson 23, Morgan 24)


Sean Abbott. Another excellent over. Ties Morgan down for two balls, and all 
that the stand-in captain can do in the end is run a single to third man. 
Gibson gets one through square, and Morgan gets one more.

I’m vaguely remembering a song by OPM.

“Captain Morgan was a pirate dude
Used to jack mother****ers and get real rude
As a real life person he wasn’t much fun
But he sure made a good-ass bottle of rum.”

I cannot remotely warrant that this song and this video are not terrible, but 
here they are. Presented without comment.

7th over: Sydney Thunder 68-1 (Gibson 23, Morgan 24)


Stephen Norman John O’Keefe. He’s the all-cheese diet in the intestinal tract 
of the Thunder innings. He blocks everything up. Captain Henriques has to turn 
to him for some control and he delivers with an over conceding four singles.

6th over: Sydney Thunder 64-1 (Gibson 21, Morgan 22)

Doug Bollinger. Not going to make any puns on the name, that wouldn’t be 
sparkling wit. But I am going to say that the bear makes him look decidedly 
dwarfish. Fits with my theme. A really tall dwarf, mind you. The dwarf Yao 
Ming. But he’d fit in down in the Mines of Moria nonetheless, even if he’d 
spend a lot of his life ducking.


Might be ducking the captain after this over. The first three balls, all 
angled across from left-arm over the wicket, all driven square by Gibson for 
boundaries. Along the ground, splitting the point and cover field, elegant 
shots giving this format a touch of class. Then Morgan gets strike and glances 
yet another four through fine leg. Keep dishing them up there, if you please 
garçon.

5th over: Sydney Thunder 47-1 (Gibson 8, Morgan 18)


How many dudes you know roll like this, how many dudes you know bowl like 
this? Joe Mennie, if any. Joe Mennie, if any.

Hopefully you don’t know many dudes bowling like Mennie Dudes, because this 
over is complete trash. Utter, pure trash. A garbo strike could have seent hem 
back a truck up onto the pitch and tilt it vertical, and we would have been 
left with less trash than Mennie’s over. Basically every ball is just outside 
leg stump. Not enough to be called wide, but enough to be glanced for four. 
Twice. And hit the pad for four leg byes. And be glanced for two.


One ball doesn’t go down leg, which is a relief. That’s the one that Morgan 
walks at like an angry bouncer and slaps down the stairs and out of the 
nightclub into the sightscreen. 22 from the over. I think Morgan’s away.

4th over: Sydney Thunder 25-1 (Gibson 8, Morgan 2)

Plenty of swing for Dwarshuis, he’s getting the ball to hoop around qiute a 
bit. One beats the edge, one hits the pad and goes for a leg bye. But the short 
ball doesn’t have a chance to swing, and Gibson clumps it for four off a 
mis-hit over mid-on.

3rd over: Sydney Thunder 18-1 (Gibson 4, Morgan 1)


O’Keefe is killing it. Five runs and the wicket from that over, hasn’t 
conceded a boundary yet. Did you know they call him “Socky” now? Did you know 
that I’ve lost the will to live? Such is the power of Strayan nicknaming 
progression. English short-form skipper Eoin Morgan comes into the middle. He’d 
go alright in my dwarf script as well. I don’t even know if he’s short, just 
something about the accent makes it seem like he would fit.

WICKET! Patterson c Bollinger b O'Keefe 8

That’s a horrible ball and a horrible dismissal. And Doug Bollinger looking 
like a Guy Ritchie standover man isn’t that much of a picture to look at 
either. A pie outside leg, Patterson kneels to yank it through dine leg, but he 
does so in the air and Doug snares it in his beard.

2nd over: Sydney Thunder 13-0 (Patterson 8, Gibson 0)

Snow Wide and the Seven Dwarshuis. S’no wide, but plenty of leg byes. That’s 
the story of this over, five of them in all, plus four runs when Patterson 
wallops the bowler on the square drive.

1st over: Sydney Thunder 3-0 (Patterson 3, Gibson 0)

Interesting battle: Steve O’Keefe and Kurtis Patterson both on the verge of 
Test selection, wanting to press their cases with strong performances in this 
league. O’Keefe starts well, the left-arm darter opening the bowling and only 
giving up a brace and a single to Patterson, before Gibson can’t score from the 
last.

We apparently have no problem with conflicts of interest in Australia, because 
national selector Mark Waugh is here in his guise as a BBL commentators, but is 
also holding last year’s trophy and being introduced as “the Governor” of the 
Thunder cricket club. Yep, can’t see any problem with that. Nor his assessment 
of West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell. “He’s been in five championship 
winning teams around the world in the last 12 months, so he’s a winner,” says 
Waugh, not mentioning that Russell is under a massive cloud for not informing 
drug testers of his location on multiple locations and may find himself with a 
hefty ban when he has a hearing shortly.

Colour. Movement. Excitement. That’s the order of the day, as the 
eyeball-bleeding uniforms of Sydney and Sydney crash into each other. The 
opening montage for the telecast is about as hard on the eyes, there’ll be a 
few migraines flickering into life around the country as some sort of 
cricket-meets-Tron CGI monstrosity sees flame-wreathed batsmen lobbing napalm 
grenades to be tracked by catchers running back across the green-lined plains 
of virtual space.

A highly convincing young kid named Sarah tells us all about how she’s a 
Sydney Thunder fan and wants to “get the win” over the Sixers, in a 
pre-recorded promo shot that is a tour de force of naturalistic acting.

Get involved

As always, the OBO relies on you. Imagine me in Lord Kitchener pose. Tell me a 
story, sing me a song, pen me a lament for sweet times gone by, talk to me 
about cricket or your feelings or your feelings about cricket or a really sweet 
Russian YouTube video you saw or a way to manufacture homemade fireworks. Get 
involved, up to your wrists. Send me your emails (geoff.lemon@theguardian.com) 
or get me on the tweet machine (@GeoffLemonSport). It’ll be a long cold lonely 
night otherwise. LOL. It’s not cold, I’m in goddamn Brisbane, I’m sweating so 
hard that my skin has become a kind of jelly.

Evening all. What a thriller we had in the Test match at the Gabba. But 
there’s never enough cricket at this time of year, so we’re going to settle in 
tonight for a very different kind of game. Geoff Lemon setting up to be your 
company through the very firstBig Bash League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/big-bash-league> game of the season, with 
Sydney taking on Sydney. Which Sydney is Tyler Durden and which is the unnamed 
Edward Norton? Guess we’ll find out.

close  
In the battle of the hues, it’s the rose that prevails. Magentlemen. Did it 
easy in the end, Henriques’ 76 from 41 providing the muscle, Hughes with 54 
from 49 providing the structural integrity. But the Greens made life hard for 
themselves by missing a couple of chances to dismiss Henriques, including first 
ball, and couldn’t bring any more pressure to bear on the Pinks’ dicey batting 
order.

The Thunder’s reasonable position at the halfway mark was down to BBL debutant 
Ryan Gibson, who will turn 23 in the next fortnight. When he was flying with 
Eoin Morgan, the Thunder were on for a huge total, but that was a briefly 
passing illlusion. In the end it was down to some fine tail-end batting from 
Cummins and McKay that got them close to a defensible total, but in the end 
that defence fell apart.

Henriques, no surprises, is man of the match. Though I’m impressed they 
thought outside the box and gave that award to Asad Shafiq after the Pakistan 
Test concluded. Good move for a fine performance.


Sixers open Big Bash League season with win over Thunder in Sydney

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/20/sixers-open-big-bash-league-season-with-win-over-thunder-in-sydney>
That’s it for tonight, we’ll be back on the OBO with more BBL in the next few 
weeks, and with the Test match from 26 December. Put us in a box and take us 
with you in your pocket, we’re adorable. Geoff Lemon signing off – goodnight.
 
18th over: Sixers 160-1 (Hughes 54, Henriques 76)

With only 10 runs needed, and three overs to bowl, Henriques has found his 
range. Even Russell is punished now, a simple straight bat slog that flies over 
wide long-on for six. A couple of singles, the last of them requiring a dive at 
the non-striker’s end, and from the last ball of the over, the win is theirs.

 
17th over: Sixers 150-1 (Hughes 52, Henriques 68)

Green has been so tidy, but this is a bad time for him to concede his first 
four of the night. Moises slams him dead straight, second ball, after Hughes 
had taken a single. It’s also a bad time for him to go for his first six, which 
happens next ball as the pressure sees him delivery a full toss, and Henriques 
bends his knees and slogs across the line over wide long-on. While we’re at it, 
it’s probably a bad time for Green to go for his second six, which happens as 
Henriques goes straight again but this time lifts the ball. His 68 have come 
from 38 balls. The partnership is 105

 
16th over: Sixers 131-1 (Hughes 50, Henriques 51)

Big guns required, with the Sixers so close: Russell comes back on to bowl. 
Brilliant couple of yorkers, then a shorter ball that beats Hughes’ attempted 
glide. Nearly nicked it. Hughes gets a single and his own fifty from the last 
ball of the over, that milestone coming in 44 balls, but there are only three 
runs from the over.

29 needed from 24. 

 
15th over: Sixers 128-1 (Hughes 48, Henriques 50)


Slightly dicey, but Hughes’ skewed drive just clears Russell who has come up 
to mid-on. Four runs, then Hughes cracks a drive into Henriques’ foot at the 
non-striker’s end, meaning they only get a single. Saved, Moises. He celebrates 
with a single of his own that raises his fifty from 31 balls.


 
14th over: Sixers 120-1 (Hughes 42, Henriques 49)


He’s had his lives, now it’s Moises’ time to shine. Six, as he wallops Cummins 
on the pull shot down over wide long-on.Four, edged away fine through third man.
Four, gone through cover. Two more runs with another pull, then four to close 
the over as Henriques got room to cut and proved he can play that shot too. 
What a contrast for Cummins to how he started. 21 from the over, 20 of those to 
Henriques, and the required rate plummets to about 6.6.

 
13th over: Sixers 99-1 (Hughes 41, Henriques 29)

And another cock-up! Henriques should have out about 40 times now, this time 
his pull shot hanging in the air over mid-on. Cummins running back called for 
the catch when it should always have belonged to Russell coming up from 
long-on. Russell respected the call, Cummins couldn’t backtrack far enough, and 
can only fingertip the ball away as he lunges back for it. Hughes tells his 
partner to wait at the other end, and swings McKay away for a pair of 
boundaries over the leg side.

 
12th over: Sixers 89-1 (Hughes 32, Henriques 28)


More garbage from the Thunder. What should have been a 6-run over becomes 10 
runs, as Sandhu at short third man mucks up a simple stop. Hughes played a late 
cut straight to him, but the ball goes through for four. Henriques had a four 
saved by Patterson with a slide at backward point just before that, but they 
still got three in that case.


 
11th over: Sixers 79-1 (Hughes 26, Henriques 24)

Green is bowling so well. Off-spin from around the wicket, he’s mostly darting 
the ball, but his accuracy and his field placements are enough to esnurre that 
the batsmen can’t get him away. Two dots that Henriques can only slam to cover, 
and he’s frustrated enough to push harder down to lng on, not entirely in 
control. Three more singles follow. Three overs from Green for 13 runs.

 
10th over: Sixers 75-1 (Hughes 24, Henriques 22)


Lovely bit of skill from Moises Henriques, the Sixers captain, as he watches 
Fawad’s leg-break turn past the off stump, then catches up with it and runs it 
fine through third man for four. Thee singles around that, the boundary helps 
Pink Sydney keep more or less up with the rate.


England lost those last two wickets to Ravindra Jadeja, by the way, to lose 
that Test by an innings and 75 runs. Check our cricket page for all the updates.

 
9th over: Sixers 68-1 (Hughes 23, Henriques 16)

Another quite one for Chris Green, five singles as he spears the ball in. 
Something will have to give shortly.

 
8th over: Sixers 63-1 (Hughes 21, Henriques 13)


Spoke too soon. Fawad Ahmed is less convincing, dishing up a wide and a 
long-hop that gets pulled for four. Eight from the over, which is roughly the 
rate that the Sixers are at and what they need through the innings.


 
7th over: Sixers 55-1 (Hughes 20, Henriques 7)

As per the previous innings, spin slows the scoring. Chris Green’s over 
provides only four singles.

 
6th over: Sixers 51-1 (Hughes 18, Henriques 5)

Should have had two in two, Russell, but McKay makes a shocking effort at the 
catch. Fielding at short fine leg, Henriques gloved the ball on a gentle lob, 
and McKay coming across to his right somehow managed to be too slow, fall over, 
throw one hand out, and be nowhere near the ball. That’s just about the worst 
effort to get to a ball I can remember. Henriques rubs it in by cutting the 
last ball, a rank wide one for four.

 
Show’s over for now, as Andre Russell comes back, sends down a scrambly slower 
ball and Roy can only lift it to mid-on.

 
5th over: Sixers 41-0 (Hughes 17, Roy 23)

Not to be outdone, Hughes hooks as well and swings away six more! Sandhu the 
victim this time, and that ball goes high over fine leg from the first of the 
over. Hughes gets two from the next ball, then a couple of singles follow.

 
4th over: Sixers 31-0 (Hughes 8, Roy 22)


Whack! That’s probably the biggest hit of the night. Cummins gives plenty of 
pace and Roy makes use of all of it. it wasn’t that short but Roy was planning 
for the pull shot and gave it the fullest possible swing. Picked the ball up 
and sent it in a very high arc that dropped genuinely towards the back of the 
stand out on the on-side. That came just after pulling four through fine leg.


 
3rd over: Sixers 20-0 (Hughes 7, Roy 12)

Hi, I’m Jason Roy, have you seen what I can do? That’s pretty special, first a 
drive over mid-on for four, then a kneeling lap shot over fine leg for the 
same. Clint McKay is the bowler, who Ricky Ponting can barely remember playing 
a Test with once many moons ago.
Russell Jackson (@rustyjacko) 
No1 thing I like about BBL: national selector Mark Waugh having no idea who 
any of the players are.

<https://twitter.com/rustyjacko/status/811148121765908481>  
2nd over: Sixers 10-0 (Hughes 6, Roy 3)

Russell also starting well and at pace. Fierce short ball, and a fuller one 
that has Roby charging and missing and by all rights deserving to be bowled, 
but it clears the stumps. A wide and three singles the only product from the 
over, as the Sixers show they’re not wanting to go completely nuts from the 
outset.

 
1st over: Sixers 6-0 (Hughes 5, Roy 1)

Cummins opens up the bowling. Serious pace straight away. Some good lines as 
well. Just a couple of singles from the first five balls, then hughes nicks a 
lucky four through third man.

 
Pretty decent total from Green Sydney in the end - their top order stuttered 
but produced just enough good overs, and their lower order was able to fill in 
the blanks. 160 is a fairly par score for most BBL games - teams would fancy 
their chances of running it down, but it can certainly be defended. The Pinkos 
don’t have a super strong batting line-up, with a lot of all-rounders, so if 
the Greens can subdue Jason Roy and Sam Billings, the English imports, then the 
rest may struggle. Your thoughts?

 
20th over: Sydney Thunder 159-8 (McKay 14, Sandhu 1)


Great closing over from Clint McKay, who can bat better than you’d expect. I 
remember him being in a partnership of 60-plus runs with James Faulkner, I 
think, in which McKay scored something like 1 run. Should find the details 
later. But he can do it himself when he’s the senior man, and he is here. The 
two singles and the two dots in Abbott’s over are fine, but the inside edge 
through fine leg for four and the length ball bashed over midwicket for six do 
somewhat spoil the gloss.


 
19th over: Sydney Thunder 147-8 (McKay 3, Sandhu 0)


More hectic batting here: three singles, then Cummins latches onto another 
one, this time on the straight drive fro Dwarshuis, and thumps it waaaaaay down 
the ground dead straight for six more. Can hit. Oh boy. Next ball he tries the 
same shot, and it just hangs enough for long-on and long-off to converage and 
hang onto the catch inside the rope.

 
18th over: Sydney Thunder 138-7 (Cummins 23, McKay 1)


EVERYBODY KNOWS I’M A MOTHERTRUCKIN’ MONSTER. That really was one from 
Cummins, got down on one knee and absolutely launches Botha into low-earth 
orbit and then back down into the crowd way beyond midwicket. He’d tried it 
earlier in the over and missed completely, the over conceded only a couple of 
singles and a wide to that point, but Cummins finishes it with that beast. 
Kanye bat, they asked? Sure can.


Adil Rashid is out in Chennai, England eight down with 14 overs to survive.
 
17th over: Sydney Thunder 129-7 (Cummins 16, McKay 0)

Happy days for Dwarshuis, after Cummins crushed him over long-on with a 
powerful pull shot to start the over. Can bat, Cummins. I did the BBC 
commentary of him making 86 not out in a tour game for Australia against 
Northamptonshire in 2015, was the best by a mile. Fifth ball gets the wicket, 
followed by a wide. Nine from the over in total.

 
If you can keep your head when all about you... That was Gibson today, who 
opened the batting and then had to carry it as his top order teammates fell by 
the wayside. Finally he makes a mistake as he mistimes a pull, and Billings 
leaps forward to claim the lobbed ball low at midwicket.

 
16th over: Sydney Thunder 120-6 (Gibson 53, Cummins 8)


He’s found the way to beat Botha! A switch-hit from Gibson, he gets it very 
fine through third man and runs it away for four. Three singles as well from 
the over, they’re building up something here. Then Gibson finishes it with a 
couple of twos to midwicket, the first of which brings up his half-century from 
41 balls. It’s been a fine hand in a crumbling innings.


 
15th over: Sydney Thunder 109-6 (Gibson 44, Cummins 6)

Ryan Gibson is playing a gem here tonight. A few singles from the over, then 
he drives Bollinger’s slower ball through cover for four. Here’s a glimpse from 
the crowd tonight. Meanwhile England is trying to bat out a thriller in 
Chennai, and India is swarming them.Check that OBO here

14th over: Sydney Thunder 102-6 (Gibson 39, Cummins 4)

Abbott should have a tidy over, but there’s an unorthodox boundary. Gibson 
gets a single, Hughes throws at the non-striker’s end and gives up four 
overthrows. Nine from the voer in the end, the Thunder needed that.

Enjoying this description of the game tonight, and the league in general.

13th over: Sydney Thunder 93-6 (Gibson 32, Cummins 2)

Unusual to expect Patrick Cummins to save you with the bat, but he’ll have to 
do some work here. Botha isn’t giving much away, spin still keeping control. 
Six runs from the over, four singles and a brace.

 
12th over: Sydney Thunder 87-6 (Gibson 28, Cummins 0)

A wide from Bollinger ends an over that involved a fair old comeback. Belted 
by Russell through third man and then midwicket, Bollinger grabbed two wickets 
thereafter. Gibson is still around, he could carry his bat here. The Thunder 
have lost 5 for 15.

 
Nothing Green can stay. Not even something as radiant as Chris Green. The 
Sixers are excited as he walks out, they bring in a slip, and he duly edges his 
second ball there.

 
Massive strike for the Sixers: Russell had just belted two boundaries, and was 
lining up a third by backing away and trying to cut. Got an edge instead, it 
tailed earthwards as it neared Haddin, but he got down low to take it. The 
commentators can now stop losing their minds over Russell’s all-black bat.

 
11th over: Sydney Thunder 78-4 (Gibson 28, Russell 1)

SOK finishes off a brilliant spell, 1 for 16 from his four overs. Two singles 
from this one, then Gibson chops a ball accidentally between the wicketkeeper’s 
legs for two.

 
10th over: Sydney Thunder 74-4 (Gibson 25, Russell 0)


A double-wicket maiden to Mennie. In a T20. Where his last over got pounded. 
Anyone care to tell me it’s a funny game?

“Morning OBO!” says Ben Copsey, inviting furore as to whether that was a 
greeting or a statement. “As I go into work I’m wondering about these team 
names - Sydney Sixers? Why not cut out the middle man and just call them ‘the 
cricketmen’ or go really simple with just ‘team’?”

Mostly we just got with Green Sydney and Pink Sydney around here, but we are 
simple people with simple minds.

 
Think we can call this a comeback over? Anyone? Anyone? Yes? Ok then. Doran 
walks out, tries to work his second ball to leg, and misses it straight in 
front. Max Gawwwwwn.

 
Get ready to voice your rendition of ‘whadddddacatch!’ It was pretty spesh. 
Rohrer, left-hander, gets some width from Mennie. Times a late cut very nicely, 
but the flying ball is intercepted by a horizontal Jason Roy, who looms into 
the frame like an Empire spaceship and hauls it in with his tractor beam.




 
9th over: Sydney Thunder 74-2 (Gibson 25, Rohrer 2)

Botha is able to close out the rest of his over, conceding just three singles 
from it after taking the wicket. Ben Rohrer in, the old stager. who hit the 
winning runs last year in the final.

 
“Botha, first ball in the Big Bash as an Australian, and he sends back the 
Irishman who plays for England.” Not bad from Mark Howard. Botha spins a ball 
across the left-handed Morgan, who gets an inside edge as he tries to flip 
through square. Haddin snares it, good take. El Capitan is sunk.

 
8th over: Sydney Thunder 71-1 (Gibson 23, Morgan 24)


Sean Abbott. Another excellent over. Ties Morgan down for two balls, and all 
that the stand-in captain can do in the end is run a single to third man. 
Gibson gets one through square, and Morgan gets one more.

I’m vaguely remembering a song by OPM.

“Captain Morgan was a pirate dude
Used to jack mother****ers and get real rude
As a real life person he wasn’t much fun
But he sure made a good-ass bottle of rum.”

I cannot remotely warrant that this song and this video are not terrible, but 
here they are. Presented without comment.




 
7th over: Sydney Thunder 68-1 (Gibson 23, Morgan 24)


Stephen Norman John O’Keefe. He’s the all-cheese diet in the intestinal tract 
of the Thunder innings. He blocks everything up. Captain Henriques has to turn 
to him for some control and he delivers with an over conceding four singles.


 
6th over: Sydney Thunder 64-1 (Gibson 21, Morgan 22)

Doug Bollinger. Not going to make any puns on the name, that wouldn’t be 
sparkling wit. But I am going to say that the bear makes him look decidedly 
dwarfish. Fits with my theme. A really tall dwarf, mind you. The dwarf Yao 
Ming. But he’d fit in down in the Mines of Moria nonetheless, even if he’d 
spend a lot of his life ducking.


Might be ducking the captain after this over. The first three balls, all 
angled across from left-arm over the wicket, all driven square by Gibson for 
boundaries. Along the ground, splitting the point and cover field, elegant 
shots giving this format a touch of class. Then Morgan gets strike and glances 
yet another four through fine leg. Keep dishing them up there, if you please 
garçon.

 
5th over: Sydney Thunder 47-1 (Gibson 8, Morgan 18)


How many dudes you know roll like this, how many dudes you know bowl like 
this? Joe Mennie, if any. Joe Mennie, if any.

Hopefully you don’t know many dudes bowling like Mennie Dudes, because this 
over is complete trash. Utter, pure trash. A garbo strike could have seent hem 
back a truck up onto the pitch and tilt it vertical, and we would have been 
left with less trash than Mennie’s over. Basically every ball is just outside 
leg stump. Not enough to be called wide, but enough to be glanced for four. 
Twice. And hit the pad for four leg byes. And be glanced for two.


One ball doesn’t go down leg, which is a relief. That’s the one that Morgan 
walks at like an angry bouncer and slaps down the stairs and out of the 
nightclub into the sightscreen. 22 from the over. I think Morgan’s away.





 
4th over: Sydney Thunder 25-1 (Gibson 8, Morgan 2)

Plenty of swing for Dwarshuis, he’s getting the ball to hoop around qiute a 
bit. One beats the edge, one hits the pad and goes for a leg bye. But the short 
ball doesn’t have a chance to swing, and Gibson clumps it for four off a 
mis-hit over mid-on.

 
3rd over: Sydney Thunder 18-1 (Gibson 4, Morgan 1)


O’Keefe is killing it. Five runs and the wicket from that over, hasn’t 
conceded a boundary yet. Did you know they call him “Socky” now? Did you know 
that I’ve lost the will to live? Such is the power of Strayan nicknaming 
progression. English short-form skipper Eoin Morgan comes into the middle. He’d 
go alright in my dwarf script as well. I don’t even know if he’s short, just 
something about the accent makes it seem like he would fit.


 
That’s a horrible ball and a horrible dismissal. And Doug Bollinger looking 
like a Guy Ritchie standover man isn’t that much of a picture to look at 
either. A pie outside leg, Patterson kneels to yank it through dine leg, but he 
does so in the air and Doug snares it in his beard.





 
2nd over: Sydney Thunder 13-0 (Patterson 8, Gibson 0)

Snow Wide and the Seven Dwarshuis. S’no wide, but plenty of leg byes. That’s 
the story of this over, five of them in all, plus four runs when Patterson 
wallops the bowler on the square drive.

 
1st over: Sydney Thunder 3-0 (Patterson 3, Gibson 0)

Interesting battle: Steve O’Keefe and Kurtis Patterson both on the verge of 
Test selection, wanting to press their cases with strong performances in this 
league. O’Keefe starts well, the left-arm darter opening the bowling and only 
giving up a brace and a single to Patterson, before Gibson can’t score from the 
last.

 
Teams: Shane Watson is out with a calf injury, the Thunder captain.

We apparently have no problem with conflicts of interest in Australia, because 
national selector Mark Waugh is here in his guise as a BBL commentators, but is 
also holding last year’s trophy and being introduced as “the Governor” of the 
Thunder cricket club. Yep, can’t see any problem with that. Nor his assessment 
of West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell. “He’s been in five championship 
winning teams around the world in the last 12 months, so he’s a winner,” says 
Waugh, not mentioning that Russell is under a massive cloud for not informing 
drug testers of his location on multiple locations and may find himself with a 
hefty ban when he has a hearing shortly.
 
Colour. Movement. Excitement. That’s the order of the day, as the 
eyeball-bleeding uniforms of Sydney and Sydney crash into each other. The 
opening montage for the telecast is about as hard on the eyes, there’ll be a 
few migraines flickering into life around the country as some sort of 
cricket-meets-Tron CGI monstrosity sees flame-wreathed batsmen lobbing napalm 
grenades to be tracked by catchers running back across the green-lined plains 
of virtual space.

A highly convincing young kid named Sarah tells us all about how she’s a 
Sydney Thunder fan and wants to “get the win” over the Sixers, in a 
pre-recorded promo shot that is a tour de force of naturalistic acting.

 
As always, the OBO relies on you. Imagine me in Lord Kitchener pose. Tell me a 
story, sing me a song, pen me a lament for sweet times gone by, talk to me 
about cricket or your feelings or your feelings about cricket or a really sweet 
Russian YouTube video you saw or a way to manufacture homemade fireworks. Get 
involved, up to your wrists. Send me your emails (geoff.lemon@theguardian.com) 
or get me on the tweet machine (@GeoffLemonSport). It’ll be a long cold lonely 
night otherwise. LOL. It’s not cold, I’m in goddamn Brisbane, I’m sweating so 
hard that my skin has become a kind of jelly.

 
Evening all. What a thriller we had in the Test match at the Gabba. But 
there’s never enough cricket at this time of year, so we’re going to settle in 
tonight for a very different kind of game. Geoff Lemon setting up to be your 
company through the very firstBig Bash League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/big-bash-league> game of the season, with 
Sydney taking on Sydney. Which Sydney is Tyler Durden and which is the unnamed 
Edward Norton? Guess we’ll find out.

 
Geoff will be here shortly. In the meantime, have a quick read of this here
