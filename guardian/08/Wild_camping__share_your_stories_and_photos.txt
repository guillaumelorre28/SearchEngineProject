There’s something wonderful about camping in the middle of nowhere, miles away 
from other humans. Cycling across Scotland this summer, I had a tent in my 
panniers and no clear idea of where I would be staying one night to the next. 
Followingthe “leave no trace”

principles, I enjoyed some quality alone time in some of Britain’s most 
beautiful countryside.

The news that Loch Lomond and The Trossachs national park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/wild-camping-campers-scotland>
 is limiting camping spots due to concerns that some lochside locations are 
being overrun with litter was met with some dismay by our natural history 
writer Patrick Barkham:

Wild camping has helped Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> 
maintain a healthier culture of enjoying nature than England. My Glaswegian 
mates were urban twentysomethings but they eschewed Ibiza for the equally 
lively (and far cheaper) holiday of fishing, drinking and camping in the 
Highlands. It would be tragic if this was regulated out of existence.

In this spirit, we want your stories and photos of wild camping, wherever you 
are in the world. How easy is it to do in your country? Where have you been, 
and what trips were particularly memorable?
