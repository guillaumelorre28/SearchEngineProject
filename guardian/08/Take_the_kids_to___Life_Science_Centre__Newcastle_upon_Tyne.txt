In a nutshell
Touching exhibits is encouraged at this immersive hub for budding scientists; 
and note the absence of “museum” in its name. The dome-shaped hall is split 
into zones: don a white coat and play with potions in the Experiment Zone, or 
get stuck into magnets, motion and building toys in the Curiosity Zone. Once 
you’ve emerged blinking from the planetarium – currently showing a 30-minute 
exploration of our galaxy and a shorter animation for under-sevens – a circuit 
of the outdoor ice rink (until 21 February) will bring you back to Earth. Visit 
before 17 April to come face to face with more than 40 famous robots, including 
rare replicas and original props from Star Wars, Forbidden Planet and 
Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

Fun fact
Scientists based at the Centre for Life (to which this visitor attraction 
belongs) were the first to successfully clone a human embryo, in 2005.

Best thing about it
The 4D motion ride (minimum height 1.2m), currently showing Mumble’s Wild 
Ride, a chase across Antarctic ice with the Happy Feet penguins. SpongeBob 
SquarePants’ Great Jelly Rescue is coming soon (22 Feb to 31 March).

What about lunch?
Times Square Cafe (open daily) and Life Cafe (weekends and school holidays 
only), serve daily-changing menus. Jacket potatoes from £3.50; quiche and salad 
£3.25.

 The planetarium 
Exit through the gift shop?
The small selection of toys, T-shirts and trinkets is easy to bypass.
