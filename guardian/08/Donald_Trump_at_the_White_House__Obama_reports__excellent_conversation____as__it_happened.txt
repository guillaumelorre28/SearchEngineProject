thousands seen on Wednesday evening

News that British prime minister Theresa May has finally had her phone call 
with Trump has certainly gladdened the hearts of some sections of the UK press:

<https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/796841105178431489> 
Peter Walker reports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/10/concerns-over-special-relationship-allayed-as-may-speaks-to-trump>
 from London:


In the call, Trump made reference to the famously close relationship between 
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher as a hopeful aim for their ties, a Downing 
Street source said.

Trump “alluded to their relationship as a way to underline that he was keen to 
have a good personal working relationship, too,” the source said.

A Downing Street statement added that the prime minister called “to 
congratulate him on his hard-fought election campaign and victory”, and 
confirmed May had been invited to visit the US “as soon as possible”.


“She noted President-elect Trump’s commitment in his acceptance speech to 
uniting people across America, which she said is a task we all need to focus on 
globally,” read one section of the statement, which is as close as May has come 
so far to referring to Trump’s controversial and divisive campaign.

The call came after concerns that the much-vaunted special relationship with 
the US might have suffered an early setback under Trump as he spoke to nine 
other world leaders in the 24 hours after his election win, without May getting 
a call.

Edward Snowden not worried about Putin turning him over to Trump

Spencer Ackerman

Edward Snowden <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden> has said 
he is unafraid of Russian president Vladimir Putin turning him over to the US 
as a favor to President-elect Donald Trump.


The national security whistleblower, speaking during a webchat from Russia 
this afternoon, where he has been stranded sincedisclosing revelations of 
widespread National Security Agency surveillance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files> in 2013, said it would be 
“crazy to dismiss” the prospect of Trump striking a deal with Putin that leads 
to his extradition and trial.

City. Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters 
But he added: “If I was worried about safety, if the security and the future 
of myself was all that I cared about, I would still be in Hawaii.”

Snowden told the webchat hosted by the Dutch privacy-focused search engine 
StartPage he was comfortable with and proud of the choices he had made.


“I think I did the right thing,” he said. “While I can’t predict what the 
future looks like, I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow, I can be 
comfortable with the way I’ve lived to today.”

Trump, who has been complimentary about Putin and Russia in a manner that 
prompted accusations from his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton that he was a 
“puppet”, has in the past mused about having Snowden killed. Trump’s major 
national security ally, the retired general and former Defense Intelligence 
Agency chief Michael Flynn, oversaw ahighly speculative DIA report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/22/pentagon-report-snowden-leaks-national-security>
 that claimed Snowden took from the NSA a larger trove of documents than ever 
confirmed based on what Snowden could access as a contract systems 
administrator.


“Snowden is a spy who has caused great damage in the US. A spy in the old 
days, when our country was respected and strong, would be executed,” Trump
tweeted <https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/457314934473633792> in 2014.

All of that has prompted concern among Snowden’s supporters worldwide that the 
groundwork for an extradition is in place. But Snowden proclaimed himself 
unperturbed.

Another White House transition-team pool report:

Hope Hicks has not responded to any additional emails with questions about the 
president-elect’s status, schedule or whereabouts since changing course and 
saying he was headed back to New York.

If there is any other information that comes in, I will send it immediately, 
but otherwise I won’t have any further pool reports today.

Thanks to you all for bearing with my failed attempts to get more out of the 
transition today.

Howard Dean to run for Democratic National Committee chairmanship

Former Vermont governor and onetime presidential candidate Howard Dean has 
announced via Twitter that he is running to reclaim his old position as chair 
of the Democratic National Committee.
Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) 
The dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy 
and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again.
 <https://twitter.com/GovHowardDean/status/796838538641833990> November 10, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/GovHowardDean/status/796838538641833990> 
Dean, who served as chair from 2005 to 2009, is running to replace interim 
chair Donna Brazile, who has served since July when Rep. Debbie 
Wasserman-Schultz resigned in the wake of a Russian-sponsored hack of DNC 
servers that revealed high-level antipathy towards then-presidential candidate 
Bernie Sanders among the DNC’s leadership.

Video: President-elect Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> appeared before the press to 
answer several questions this afternoon during a visit to Capitol Hill, and 
said that his first priorities once he is inaugurated will be controlling 
immigration, reforming healthcare and creating “big league jobs.”

(Or, possibly, “bigly jobs.” We’ve never been totally sure!)
Trump’s top priorities: immigration, healthcare and jobs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/10/top-priorities-for-donald-trump-video>
Trump was in Washington to meet President Obama and also held discussions with 
key Republican figures including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell.

News that British prime minister Theresa May has finally had her phone call 
with Trump has certainly gladdened the hearts of some sections of the UK press:

<https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/796841105178431489> 
Peter Walker reports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/10/concerns-over-special-relationship-allayed-as-may-speaks-to-trump>
 from London:


In the call, Trump made reference to the famously close relationship between 
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher as a hopeful aim for their ties, a Downing 
Street source said.

Trump “alluded to their relationship as a way to underline that he was keen to 
have a good personal working relationship, too,” the source said.

A Downing Street statement added that the prime minister called “to 
congratulate him on his hard-fought election campaign and victory”, and 
confirmed May had been invited to visit the US “as soon as possible”.


“She noted President-elect Trump’s commitment in his acceptance speech to 
uniting people across America, which she said is a task we all need to focus on 
globally,” read one section of the statement, which is as close as May has come 
so far to referring to Trump’s controversial and divisive campaign.

The call came after concerns that the much-vaunted special relationship with 
the US might have suffered an early setback under Trump as he spoke to nine 
other world leaders in the 24 hours after his election win, without May getting 
a call.
 
Thanks to the magic synchronicity of Twitter, we can confirm that the 
vice-president-elect has spoken to the British foreign secretary, and that the 
“special relationship” remains … special:

Edward Snowden <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden> has said 
he is unafraid of Russian president Vladimir Putin turning him over to the US 
as a favor to President-elect Donald Trump.


The national security whistleblower, speaking during a webchat from Russia 
this afternoon, where he has been stranded sincedisclosing revelations of 
widespread National Security Agency surveillance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files> in 2013, said it would be 
“crazy to dismiss” the prospect of Trump striking a deal with Putin that leads 
to his extradition and trial.

City. Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters 
But he added: “If I was worried about safety, if the security and the future 
of myself was all that I cared about, I would still be in Hawaii.”

Snowden told the webchat hosted by the Dutch privacy-focused search engine 
StartPage he was comfortable with and proud of the choices he had made.


“I think I did the right thing,” he said. “While I can’t predict what the 
future looks like, I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow, I can be 
comfortable with the way I’ve lived to today.”

Trump, who has been complimentary about Putin and Russia in a manner that 
prompted accusations from his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton that he was a 
“puppet”, has in the past mused about having Snowden killed. Trump’s major 
national security ally, the retired general and former Defense Intelligence 
Agency chief Michael Flynn, oversaw ahighly speculative DIA report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/22/pentagon-report-snowden-leaks-national-security>
 that claimed Snowden took from the NSA a larger trove of documents than ever 
confirmed based on what Snowden could access as a contract systems 
administrator.


“Snowden is a spy who has caused great damage in the US. A spy in the old 
days, when our country was respected and strong, would be executed,” Trump
tweeted <https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/457314934473633792> in 2014.

All of that has prompted concern among Snowden’s supporters worldwide that the 
groundwork for an extradition is in place. But Snowden proclaimed himself 
unperturbed.

Another White House transition-team pool report:

Hope Hicks has not responded to any additional emails with questions about the 
president-elect’s status, schedule or whereabouts since changing course and 
saying he was headed back to New York.

If there is any other information that comes in, I will send it immediately, 
but otherwise I won’t have any further pool reports today.

Thanks to you all for bearing with my failed attempts to get more out of the 
transition today.

Former Vermont governor and onetime presidential candidate Howard Dean has 
announced via Twitter that he is running to reclaim his old position as chair 
of the Democratic National Committee.
Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) 
The dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy 
and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again.

Dean, who served as chair from 2005 to 2009, is running to replace interim 
chair Donna Brazile, who has served since July when Rep. Debbie 
Wasserman-Schultz resigned in the wake of a Russian-sponsored hack of DNC 
servers that revealed high-level antipathy towards then-presidential candidate 
Bernie Sanders among the DNC’s leadership.
 
Video: President-elect Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> appeared before the press to 
answer several questions this afternoon during a visit to Capitol Hill, and 
said that his first priorities once he is inaugurated will be controlling 
immigration, reforming healthcare and creating “big league jobs.”

(Or, possibly, “bigly jobs.” We’ve never been totally sure!)

Trump was in Washington to meet President Obama and also held discussions with 
key Republican figures including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell.
