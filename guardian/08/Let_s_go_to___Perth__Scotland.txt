 Townhouse B&B 
Hotels in Perth are generally expensive, but the Townhouse 
<http://www.thetownhouseperth.co.uk/> , a boutique B&B in a Georgian terrace 
overlooking South Inch Park, has comfortable doubles from £80.

Do I need a car?

There are direct trains to Perth from major cities in Scotland, and from 
Newcastle, York and London, including the Caledonian Sleeper, which arrives at 
6am. Perth, which regained city status in 2012, is small enough to be explored 
on foot. More information atvisitscotland.com
