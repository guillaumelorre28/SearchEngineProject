It’s a timber-clad house with open-plan living, pale floorboards and large 
windows giving views across Chichester canal. This building designed by 
London-basedBaca Architects <http://www.baca.uk.com/> has a unique feature – it 
floats.

Completed this month, the amphibious house was developed as a prototype by 
Baca andFloating Homes <http://www.floatinghomes.ltd.uk/>, a manufacturer 
specialising in flood-resilient housing, in response to a competition launched 
last year to find asolution to London’s housing crisis 
<http://www.dezeen.com/2015/09/18/baca-architects-floating-homes-ltd-amphibious-resolve-london-housing-crisis/>
.

The house is intended to be practical, affordable (a two-bed unit will sell 
for £200,000) and equipped to deal with floods, by rising with the water 
levels. Ultimately the company wants to unlock redundant waterways by building 
on “bluespace” sites – manmade docks, canals and marinas – acrossLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>.


“Collectively, bluespace has the potential to deliver as many as 7,500 
floating homes with minimal disruption to existing communities”, says Richard 
Coutts, director at Baca Architects.

Floating architecture has real potential to help ease some of London’s housing 
problems, says Alex De Rijke of dRMM architects, which won a competition to 
design the UK’sfirst floating villages 
<http://www.bdonline.co.uk/drmm-wins-royal-docks-competition-for-floating-village/5069930.article>
 in London Docklands.

“Architecture can only respond to overpopulation by addressing the questions 
of density, economy and speed of construction,” says de Rijke, “The space of 
large rivers in urban areas can offer answers to these questions.”

Architects and city planners across the world are starting to look beyond the 
traditional confines of the city, towards building on water as one of the 
answers to reducing inner-city population density and also developing 
flood-resilient designs. Global damage to cities from flooding could amount to 
$1tn a year by 2050 
<http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/08/19/coastal-cities-at-highest-risk-floods>
 if no action is taken, according to a World Bank report.

Floating architecture is nothing new. Traditional floating villages are common 
in deltas and along the Mekong river in south-east Asia. But integrating 
age-old designs into a modern city is a different matter entirely.


Some cities are further ahead than others. IJBurg 
<http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/local/about-amsterdam/neighbourhoods/ijburg> is a 
collection of floating houses built on six artificial islands on IJ Lake in 
Amsterdam, designed byMarlies Rohmer <http://www.rohmer.nl/>. It was conceived 
to deal with the city’s critical housing shortage problem as well as its 
vulnerability to flooding – more than half of the Netherlands is at or below 
sea level.


The housing is a mix of expensive waterside condos and social housing, with 
about 30% of the community’s 18,000 houses allocated to low-income residents. 
When complete, the development will provide homes for 45,000 residents on 10 
islands.

In Copenhagen, architecture firm Urban Rigger has unveiled floating student 
housing made from end of life shipping containers. Each Urban Rigger has 12 
studio apartments which share a courtyard complete with a BBQ area, bike racks 
and a kayak landing, and is powered in part by solar energy.


Tethered to docks in the city, the first students are due to move at the end 
of the year and will pay around £500-£600 a month. Over the next decade, the 
company plans to build 1,000-1,500 containers in “harbour, canal and river 
intensive cities” across Europe, says founder Kim Loudrup.

It’s about “using infrastructure that’s not being used for anything apart from 
looking nice”, says Loudrop, who admits floating housing is “only part of the 
puzzle” when it comes to solving city housing crises. The beauty is, he says, 
that this kind of housing “can be initialised and utilised immediately; it 
comes in, stays for a period of time and then can move away again.”

Building on water isn’t straightforward, however. The recent collapse of the 
Makoko Floating School in Lagos, one of the most famous examples of floating 
architecture, shows some of the complexities.

The award-winning lagoon structure designed by Nigerian architect Kunlé 
Adeyemi of Dutch studioNLÉ Works <http://www.nleworks.com/> was built to 
provide a school and community centre to a floating slum in the city but 
collapsed in June after heavy rainfall.

 Local residents work to dismantle the Makoko Floating School after it 
collapsed. Composite: Reuters 
Adeyemi says that the building had been decommissioned for months 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jun/10/makoko-floating-school-collapse-lagos-nigeria-slum-water>
 and was only intended as a prototype. But it led to a row as a local 
headmaster, Noah Shemede, raised concerns about the viability of the structure.

There are also environmental concerns. The need for foundations of many 
floating buildings to go deep into the river bed, for example, will have an 
impact on the environment, says Phillip Mills, director of thePolicy Consulting 
Network <http://www.policyconsulting.co.uk/>, and a specialist in water 
construction.


“Foundations or structures within the river could also alter the river bed 
with silt erosion and deposition elsewhere in the river. The same thing already 
happens around bridge piers,” he says.

Building floating structures can also severely alter the flow of a river such 
as the Thames and disrupt transport, a spokesperson from the Port of London 
Authority explains. “What might suit property owners or private developers best 
is not always best for the city. Londoners have said they want to see the 
Thames used predominantly for transport or leisure. Any structures in the 
Thames could impact the flow of the river and create obstacles for watercraft.”

However, Lucy Bullivant <https://soa.syr.edu/live/profiles/192-lucy-bullivant>
, adjunct professor of history and theory of urban design at Syracuse 
University, thinks there are greater environmental consequences building on 
land – such as the tendency to be more car focused – than on rivers. “Floating 
designs will create a good anchor point for plants to help foster biodiversity 
and create habitats for fish and birds.”


Building on bluefield sights can be environmentally friendly, according to 
Mark Junak, director of Floating Homes. He says floating structures such as 
those at Noorderhaven in the Netherlands have recently been subject to
underwater drone surveys 
<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280572471_MONITORING_THE_IMPACTS_OF_FLOATING_STRUCTURES_ON_THE_WATER_QUALITY_AND_ECOLOGY_USING_AN_UNDERWATER_DRONE>
 to observe whether their construction has negatively affected the ecosystem.

According to the research project, the underwater footage “revealed the 
existence of a dynamic and diverse aquatic habitat in the vicinity of these 
structures, showing that floating structures can have a positive effect on the 
aquatic environment”.

 For London architect Carl Turner, who has designed a pre-fabricated, 
open-source amphibious house specifically designed to float on floodwater, 
called the Floating House, climate change means needing to work with water.

“You either protect the house or protect the land,” he says. “Creating 
large-scale flood protection zones is expensive and in itself potentially 
harmful to the environment. Once breached, homes are left defenceless, as 
opposed to floating homes that can simply rise with flood waters.”
