Today in Transition 2016

 * President-elect Donald Trump has settled the multi-state class-action fraud 
lawsuit over the now-defunct Trump University for $25 million, according to New 
York attorney general Eric Schneiderman: 
In 2013, my office sued Donald Trump for swindling thousands of innocent 
Americans out of millions of dollars through a scheme known at Trump 
University. Donald Trump fought us every step of the way, filing baseless 
charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of 
compensation for the victims of his phony university. Today, that all changes. 
Today’s $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal byDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and a major victory for the 
over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.

I am pleased that under the terms of this settlement, every victim will 
receive restitution and that Donald Trump will pay up to $1 million in 
penalties to the State of New York for violating state education laws. The 
victims of Trump University have waited years for today’s result and I am 
pleased that their patience - and persistence - will be rewarded by this $25 
million settlement.

 * Donald Trump announced the nomination of Alabama senator Jeff Sessions as 
attorney general and Kansas congressman Mike Pompeo as director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency, as well as the selection of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn 
to serve as his national security advisor.

 * Sessions, one of Trump’s earliest backers during the Republican primary 
campaign, has served in the Senate since 1997, and served as Alabama’s attorney 
general fortwo years before 
<http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/11/jeff_sessions_us_attorney_gene.html> 
that. The lawmaker has the rare distinction of once being passed over for a 
federal judgeship overracist comments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/17/sessions-flynn-and-pompeo-who-are-the-potential-trump-cabinet-picks->
 he allegedly made. During Sessions’ confirmation hearing in 1986, lawmakers 
heard testimony that Sessions called respected civil rights organizations “
communist inspired 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/17/sessions-flynn-and-pompeo-who-are-the-potential-trump-cabinet-picks->
”. In another set of testimony, a prosecutor told Congress that Sessions had 
said he thought the Ku Klux Klan was “OK until I found out they smoked pot.” 
 * The feisty online campaign to persuade shoppers to boycott Ivanka Trump’s 
fashion products and the retailers that stock them, #GrabYourWallet, appears to 
be biting. Shoes.com dropped the footwear line pedaled by president-elect 
Donald Trump’s elder daughter Ivanka shortly after the election and now 
interior décor specialist Bellacor has dropped the “Trump Home” range of 
chandeliers and other domestic trinkets from its website. 
 * Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren has released a blistering statement 
in response to Trump’s nomination of Sessions to serve as the next attorney 
general: 
 Thirty years ago, a different Republican Senate rejected Senator Sessions’ 
nomination to a federal judgeship. In doing so, that Senate affirmed that there 
can be no compromise with racism; no negotiation with hate. Today, a new 
Republican Senate must decide whether self-interest and political cowardice 
will prevent them from once again doing what is right.

From the long-suffering transition pool:
 Robert Burck, also known as the Naked Cowboy, a pro-Trump supporter, plays 
guitar and sings as anti-Trump demonstrators voice their opposition to Donald 
Trump. Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP 
Naked Cowboy came over and sang a song about trump that included lyrics about 
blue lives mattering and Trump putting thugs in jail. Also about how bad 
Obamacare is. And how Trump Tower is the greatest place on Earth.

He then picked up a tourist, cradled her in his arms, and kissed her. There’s 
not acid strong enough for this to be a hallucination, I assure you.

Perhaps coincidentally, while Naked Cowboy was doing his thing, a motorcade 
left through the garage. No official word on if it is Trump, Pence, or someone 
altogether different. Fox News is reporting it is Trump.

Michael Flynn: from subtle intelligence chief to Muslim-baiting ideologue

Spencer Ackerman

Long before Michael Flynn led a chant demanding the imprisonment of Hillary 
Clinton, and before he came to view an entire religion as responsible for 
terrorism, he issued a public plea for nuance in intelligence.

In 2009, Flynn followed his longtime friend from the elite Joint Special 
Operations Command (JSOC), Stanley McChrystal, to Afghanistan. Their 
partnership had transformed JSOC into an apparatus that collected and 
disseminated intelligence as rapidly as it killed people, and then fed that 
intelligence back into its internal systems toaccelerate the lethal process 
<https://www.wired.com/2011/09/mcchrystal-network/>.

As with JSOC, McChrystal would command the war and Flynn would run its 
intelligence shop. But Flynn soon considered the entire US intelligence 
apparatus in Afghanistan to be focusing on the wrong targets.

The trouble, in Flynn’s estimation, was that US intelligence focused too much 
on the Taliban insurgency. It gave comparatively little emphasis on granular 
data about trends among Afghans themselves, which at the time the coterie of 
counterinsurgents around McChrystal considered decisive. Win the people, the 
thinking went, and the insurgency would lose the base of support necessary to 
survive.

In a rare move for a serving intelligence officer, Flynn took his critique 
public.

“The most salient problems [in Afghanistan] are attitudinal, cultural and 
human,” he wrote in aJanuary 2010 paper 
<https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/fixing-intel-a-blueprint-for-making-intelligence-relevant-in-afghanistan>
 for the Center for a New American Security, at that point the ascendant 
defense thinktank and a job pipeline into the Obama Pentagon. “[M]erely killing 
insurgents usually serves to multiply enemies rather than subtract them.”

Commanders, Flynn and his co-authors wrote, needed information including 
“census data and patrol debriefs; minutes from shuras with local farmers and 
tribal leaders … polling data and atmospherics reports from psychological 
operations and female engagement teams.”

Refocusing on “population-centric information”, the authors wrote, was crucial 
to victory. It would admittedly offer “few clues about where to find 
insurgents”, but it would “provide elements of even greater strategic 
importance – a map for leveraging popular support and marginalizing the 
insurgency itself”.

The 2010 paper, which took many in intelligence circles by surprise, was the 
first time most outside the military had encountered Flynn. It made his career 
in Washington.

Elizabeth Warren lambasts 'compromise with racism' in Sessions nomination

Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren has released a blistering statement in 
response to president-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Alabama senatorJeff 
Sessions <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeff-sessions> to serve as the 
next attorney general:

Instead of embracing the bigotry that fueled his campaign rallies, I urge 
president-elect Trump to reverse his apparent decision to nominate Senator 
Sessions to be attorney general of the United States. If he refuses, then it 
will fall to the Senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation 
and all of its people. Thirty years ago, a different Republican Senate rejected 
Senator Sessions’ nomination to a federal judgeship. In doing so, that Senate 
affirmed that there can be no compromise with racism; no negotiation with hate. 
Today, a new Republican Senate must decide whether self-interest and political 
cowardice will prevent them from once again doing what is right.

From the long-suffering transition pooler Ben Jacobs:

Your supplemental pooler has arrived outside Trump National Golf Club 
Bedminster. He is currently standing in the drainage ditch across the street 
from the main entrance. The property owner has given him permission and at 
least one other reporter permission to do so.

The street, Lammington Road, is lined both ways with bright orange signs from 
the township of Bedminster stating ‘No Standing, Stopping or Parking.’ The 
signs go significantly farther to the west than the east.

Your supplemental pooler now holding in the drainage ditch resting a coffee 
cup on the guard rail as he enjoys an unseasonably mild November day in New 
Jersey and the exhaust fumes from passing traffic.

How did ‘less than stellar’ high school student Jared Kushner get into Harvard?

Daniel Golden

I would like to express my gratitude to Jared Kushner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/jared-kushner-ivanka-trump-transition-team-chris-christie>
 for reviving interest in my 2006 book,The Price of Admission 
<https://www.amazon.com/Price-Admission-Americas-Colleges-Outside/dp/1400097975/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479403171&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+price+of+admission>
. I have never met or spoken with him, and it’s rare in this life to find such 
a selfless benefactor. Of course, I doubt he became Donald Trump’s son-in-law 
andconsigliere 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/us/politics/donald-trump-administration.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0>
 merely to boost my lagging sales, but still, I’m thankful.

My book exposed a grubby secret of American higher education: that the rich 
buy their underachieving children’s way into elite universities with massive, 
tax-deductible donations. It reported that New Jersey real estate developer 
Charles Kushner had pledged $2.5m toHarvard University 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/harvard-university> not long before his 
son Jared was admitted to the prestigious Ivy League school, which at the time 
accepted about one of every nine applicants. (Nowadays, it only takes one out 
of 20.)

I also quoted administrators at Jared’s high school, who described him as a 
less-than-stellar student and expressed dismay at Harvard’s decision.

“There was no way anybody in the administrative office of the school thought 
he would on the merits get into Harvard,’’ a former official at the Frisch 
school in Paramus, New Jersey, told me. “His GPA [grade point average] did not 
warrant it, his SAT scores did not warrant it. We thought, for sure, there was 
no way this was going to happen. Then, lo and behold, Jared was accepted. It 
was a little bit disappointing because there were at the time other kids we 
thought should really get in on the merits, and they did not.’’

Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said in an email on Thursday 
that “the allegation’’ that Charles Kushner’s gift to Harvard was related to 
Jared’s admission “is and always has been false”. His parents, Charles and 
Seryl Kushner, “are enormously generous and have donated over $100m to 
universities, hospitals and other charitable causes. Jared Kushner was an 
excellent student in high school and graduated from Harvard with honours.’’ 
(About 90% of Jared’s 2003 class at Harvard also graduated with honours.)

My Kushner discoveries were an offshoot of my research for a chapter on 
Harvard donors. Somebody had slipped me a document I had long coveted: the 
membership list of Harvard’s Committee on University Resources. The university 
wooed more than 400 of its biggest givers and most promising prospects by 
putting them on this committee and inviting them to campus periodically to be 
wined, dined and subjected to lectures by eminent professors.

My idea was to figure out how many children of these corporate titans, oil 
barons, money managers, lawyers, high-tech consultants and old-money heirs had 
gone to Harvard. A disproportionate tally might suggest that the university 
eased its standards for the offspring of wealthy backers.

I began working through the list, poring over Who’s Who in America and Harvard 
class reunion reports for family information. Charles and Seryl Kushner were 
both on the committee. I had never heard of them, but their joint presence 
struck me as a sign that Harvard’s fundraising machine held the couple in 
especially fond regard.


The clips showed that Charles Kushner’s empire encompassed 25,000 New Jersey 
apartments, along with extensive office, industrial and retail space and 
undeveloped land. Unlike most of his fellow committee members, though, Kushner 
was not a Harvard man. He had graduated from New York University. This 
eliminated the sentimental tug of the alma mater as a reason for him to give to 
Harvard, leaving another likely explanation: his children.

Sure enough, his sons Jared and Joshua had both enrolled there.

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, on Jeff Sessions:

I know Senator Sessions and we work out in the gym, but the fact that he is a 
senator does not absolve him from answering tough questions in the confirmation 
process. Given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to 
immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil 
Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to 
say.

Women’s rights groups brace for Trump: ‘We are used to fighting impossible 
odds’

Lauren Gambino

Women and advocacy groups are preparing for the most serious assault on 
reproductive rights in decades after Hillary Clinton, the first female nominee 
of a major party, lost the presidential election toDonald Trump

Trump’s election, in tandem with an undivided Congress under Republican 
control, 33 GOP governors and an open seat on the supreme court with the 
possibility of more appointments, has cast serious uncertainty about the future 
of abortion in the US, advocates say.

“It’s really bad – bad as we’ve ever seen it,” said Donna Crane, the 
vice-president of policy for Naral, a pro-choice advocacy group.

Like many of his policy views, Trump’s stance on women’s reproductive rights 
has shifted throughout his campaign, includingthree contradictory positions on 
abortion in three hours 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/03/donald-trumps-ever-shifting-positions-on-abortion/>
. In an interview on Sunday with CBS’s 60 Minutes, Trump reiterated his vow to 
appoint conservative and pro-life supreme court justices, which could gradually 
restrict abortion access and even lead to overturning Roe v Wade, the 
43-year-old ruling that legalized abortion in the US. (Trump, who appears to 
have anincongruous understanding 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-gay-marriage-abortion-supreme-court/>
 of how the supreme court operates, had previously suggested this would happen “
automatically 
<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/trump-ill-appoint-supreme-court-justices-to-overturn-roe-v-wade-abortion-case.html>
”.)


The prospect of overturning Roe v Wade has set off alarm bells among women’s 
health advocates, who are already fighting to hold the line against an 
avalanche of regulations meant to restrict access to abortions at the state 
level. But experts saying dismantling the precedent would be much more 
difficult than Trump seems to think it will be.

“Roe has withstood the test of time, over 40 years,” said Kelly Baden, interim 
senior director of US policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive 
Rights, noting that US supreme court justices take precedents seriously even 
when they disagree with them. “It has survived anti-choice administrations, 
including ones that have pushed to appoint anti-choice justices to the supreme 
court.”

In the interview, Trump said that if Roe v Wade is overturned, then women 
would “have to go to another state”. Asked if that was acceptable, he replied: 
“Well, we’ll see what happens. It’s got a long way to go.”

Video: Retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn, who was tapped this morning 
as president-elect Donald Trump’s national security advisor, calling Islam 
“like cancer”:

Full quotation:

Islam is a political ideology. It is a political ideology. It definitely hides 
behind this notion of it being a religion. And I have a very, very tough time 
because I don’t see a lot of people screaming ‘Jesus Christ’ with hatchets or 
machetes or rifles shooting up clubs or hatcheting, literally axing families on 
a train, or like they just killed a couple of police officers with a machete. 
It’s unbelievable. So we have a problem.

It’s like cancer. You know, I’ve gone through cancer in my own life. So it’s 
like cancer. And it’s a like a malignant cancer, though, in this case. It has 
metastasized.

From a written statement submitted to Congress 
<http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/20/us/senator-urges-withdrawal-of-judicial-nomination.html>
 in 1986 by Thomas Figures, a former assistant United States Attorney, about 
Jeff Sessions, then a nominee for a federal district judgeship:

Mr. Sessions called me into his office and indicated he felt I had been unduly 
harsh with the secretary. Mr. Sessions admonished me to ‘be careful what you 
say to white folks.’

Had Mr. Sessions merely urged me to be careful about what I said to ‘folks,’ 
that admonition would have been quite reasonable. But that was not the language 
that he used.

There was a period in our own lifetimes when blacks were regularly admonished 
to be particularly polite or deferential, and a remark of that sort may just 
have slipped out inadvertently.

Oregon senator: Trump's agenda 'a wake-up call for potential abuse of power'

Spencer Ackerman

Much of official Washington is wondering whether Trump will implement the 
agenda that won him the presidency. Some of Trump’s defenders, like tech 
investor Peter Thiel, contend that Trumpshould not be taken literally 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/peter-thiel-defends-donald-trump-muslim-ban-mexico-wall>
.

But the Democratic senator from Oregon shows no signs of interest in that 
discussion. As perhaps the Democratic party’s premier civil libertarian on 
Capitol Hill, his anticipation of theTrump administration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration> starts from the 
perspective that the president-elect will govern as he campaigned: against 
Muslims, against immigrants, for torture, for surveillance. Wyden, from his 
perch on the intelligence committee, is preparing for a four-year battle.

“We’re going to have to make sure now that a political agenda doesn’t replace 
a set of constitutional priorities. That’s the heart of it,” Wyden said in an 
interview with the Guardian this week.


Wyden is one of the few national politicians who can plausibly claim to have 
fought national security abuses and championed civil liberties with equal vigor 
in the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations. He is far more 
comfortable discussing policies or proposals than he is discussing 
personalities, opting to refer to Trump simply as the president-elect.

“You look at some of what the president-elect has to say and it certainly 
ought to be a wake-up call from the standpoint of potential abuse of power,” 
Wyden said.

A quote sticking in Wyden’s mind these days is one Trump issued in July after 
the Democratic National Committee hack, which US intelligence has blamed on 
Russia. Trump, discussing his political opponents, mused: “Honestly, I wish I 
had that power. I’d love to have that power 
<http://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12298664/trump-dnc-hacking-power>.” By 20 
January, it will no longer be hypothetical.

'You can do anything': Trump brags on tape about using fame to get women

She revealed in a Guardian exclusive 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/ivanka-trump-boycott-clothing->
 at the time that his appalling boasting on tape reminded her of being sexually 
harassed by her boss at a Silicon Valley job in her youth.


Coulter was outraged by the Donald but also by Ivanka’s vigorous support of 
her father’s presidential campaign with barely a “tisk”, while at the same time 
promoting her fashion and accessories line with messages of empowerment for the 
independent-minded, stylish working woman.

“I’m elated,” Coulter told the Guardian on Thursday night about Shoes.com and 
Bellacor’s decisions.

The retailers didn’t cite #GrabYourWallet specifically but coincidentally 
contacted supporters of the campaign who had complained to them to explain they 
were dropping the products.

Coulter tweets about her campaign have been viewed more than nine million 
times and the #GrabYourWallet hashtag has been read or spread 200 million times 
in just over a month.

She began by posting a list of retailers that sell items from the Ivanka Trump 
Collection, including the big hitters at the mall, Macy’s, Nordstrom, Nieman 
Marcus and Lord & Taylor, and high profile online names such as Amazon and 
Zappos, urging consumers not only to boycott them but to contact them to 
protest.

With the traditional post-Thanksgiving retail-binge imminent, none of the big 
guys have budged – yet.

“I have plenty of indications that the larger players are paying very close 
attention to this. I’m not surprised that the smaller players would be the 
first to drop the products, however. And I know the message is getting 
through,” said Coulter.

She hopes that even if big retailers don’t want to appear partisan, now that 
Trump is president-elect and his family members are poised to benefit “big 
league”, that they will feel an unpleasant “conflict of interest” in stocking 
Trump products, she said.

#GrabYourWallet has sparked a backlash from some Trump voters who are now keen 
to encourage boycotts of the retailers that boycott Trump.

Meanwhile Coulter is already blue sky thinking about whether #GrabYourWallet 
could grow into a bigger phenomenon as a shopping ethics monitor that rates 
companies by their respect for women and inclusiveness in general.


“It could be measuring how many women or people of color they have in senior 
executive leadership, the ethical dimensions of the products they carry. We 
want to support companies that take the high road,” she said.

Illinois congressman Luis Gutiérrez, on attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions:

If you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the 
closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Senator 
Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man.

No senator has fought harder against the hopes and aspirations of Latinos, 
immigrants, and people of color than Sen. Sessions. He is a staunch opponent of 
legal immigration and someone who has blocked every effort to improve, 
modernize, and humanize our immigration system, which is two or three decades 
out-of-date.

He ran for the Senate because he was deemed by the Senate Judiciary Committee 
as too racist to serve as a federal judge. He is the kind of person who will 
set back law enforcement, civil rights, the courts, and increase America’s mass 
incarceration industry and erase 50 years of progress.

 * President-elect Donald Trump has settled the multi-state class-action fraud 
lawsuit over the now-defunct Trump University for $25 million, according to New 
York attorney general Eric Schneiderman: 
In 2013, my office sued Donald Trump for swindling thousands of innocent 
Americans out of millions of dollars through a scheme known at Trump 
University. Donald Trump fought us every step of the way, filing baseless 
charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of 
compensation for the victims of his phony university. Today, that all changes. 
Today’s $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal byDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and a major victory for the 
over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.

I am pleased that under the terms of this settlement, every victim will 
receive restitution and that Donald Trump will pay up to $1 million in 
penalties to the State of New York for violating state education laws. The 
victims of Trump University have waited years for today’s result and I am 
pleased that their patience - and persistence - will be rewarded by this $25 
million settlement.

 * Donald Trump announced the nomination of Alabama senator Jeff Sessions as 
attorney general and Kansas congressman Mike Pompeo as director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency, as well as the selection of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn 
to serve as his national security advisor.

 * Sessions, one of Trump’s earliest backers during the Republican primary 
campaign, has served in the Senate since 1997, and served as Alabama’s attorney 
general fortwo years before

federal judgeship overracist comments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/17/sessions-flynn-and-pompeo-who-are-the-potential-trump-cabinet-picks->
 he allegedly made. During Sessions’ confirmation hearing in 1986, lawmakers 
heard testimony that Sessions called respected civil rights organizations “
communist inspired 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/17/sessions-flynn-and-pompeo-who-are-the-potential-trump-cabinet-picks->
”. In another set of testimony, a prosecutor told Congress that Sessions had 
said he thought the Ku Klux Klan was “OK until I found out they smoked pot.” 
 * The feisty online campaign to persuade shoppers to boycott Ivanka Trump’s 
fashion products and the retailers that stock them, #GrabYourWallet, appears to 
be biting. Shoes.com dropped the footwear line pedaled by president-elect 
Donald Trump’s elder daughter Ivanka shortly after the election and now 
interior décor specialist Bellacor has dropped the “Trump Home” range of 
chandeliers and other domestic trinkets from its website. 
 * Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren has released a blistering statement 
in response to Trump’s nomination of Sessions to serve as the next attorney 
general: 
 Thirty years ago, a different Republican Senate rejected Senator Sessions’ 
nomination to a federal judgeship. In doing so, that Senate affirmed that there 
can be no compromise with racism; no negotiation with hate. Today, a new 
Republican Senate must decide whether self-interest and political cowardice 
will prevent them from once again doing what is right.

Naked Cowboy came over and sang a song about trump that included lyrics about 
blue lives mattering and Trump putting thugs in jail. Also about how bad 
Obamacare is. And how Trump Tower is the greatest place on Earth.

He then picked up a tourist, cradled her in his arms, and kissed her. There’s 
not acid strong enough for this to be a hallucination, I assure you.

Perhaps coincidentally, while Naked Cowboy was doing his thing, a motorcade 
left through the garage. No official word on if it is Trump, Pence, or someone 
altogether different. Fox News is reporting it is Trump.

Long before Michael Flynn led a chant demanding the imprisonment of Hillary 
Clinton, and before he came to view an entire religion as responsible for 
terrorism, he issued a public plea for nuance in intelligence.

 Ret. Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn. Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images 
In 2009, Flynn followed his longtime friend from the elite Joint Special 
Operations Command (JSOC), Stanley McChrystal, to Afghanistan. Their 
partnership had transformed JSOC into an apparatus that collected and 
disseminated intelligence as rapidly as it killed people, and then fed that 
intelligence back into its internal systems toaccelerate the lethal process 
<https://www.wired.com/2011/09/mcchrystal-network/>.

As with JSOC, McChrystal would command the war and Flynn would run its 
intelligence shop. But Flynn soon considered the entire US intelligence 
apparatus in Afghanistan to be focusing on the wrong targets.

The trouble, in Flynn’s estimation, was that US intelligence focused too much 
on the Taliban insurgency. It gave comparatively little emphasis on granular 
data about trends among Afghans themselves, which at the time the coterie of 
counterinsurgents around McChrystal considered decisive. Win the people, the 
thinking went, and the insurgency would lose the base of support necessary to 
survive.

In a rare move for a serving intelligence officer, Flynn took his critique 
public.

“The most salient problems [in Afghanistan] are attitudinal, cultural and 
human,” he wrote in aJanuary 2010 paper 
<https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/fixing-intel-a-blueprint-for-making-intelligence-relevant-in-afghanistan>
 for the Center for a New American Security, at that point the ascendant 
defense thinktank and a job pipeline into the Obama Pentagon. “[M]erely killing 
insurgents usually serves to multiply enemies rather than subtract them.”

Commanders, Flynn and his co-authors wrote, needed information including 
“census data and patrol debriefs; minutes from shuras with local farmers and 
tribal leaders … polling data and atmospherics reports from psychological 
operations and female engagement teams.”

Refocusing on “population-centric information”, the authors wrote, was crucial 
to victory. It would admittedly offer “few clues about where to find 
insurgents”, but it would “provide elements of even greater strategic 
importance – a map for leveraging popular support and marginalizing the 
insurgency itself”.

The 2010 paper, which took many in intelligence circles by surprise, was the 
first time most outside the military had encountered Flynn. It made his career 
in Washington.

My book exposed a grubby secret of American higher education: that the rich 
buy their underachieving children’s way into elite universities with massive, 
tax-deductible donations. It reported that New Jersey real estate developer 
Charles Kushner had pledged $2.5m toHarvard University 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/harvard-university> not long before his 
son Jared was admitted to the prestigious Ivy League school, which at the time 
accepted about one of every nine applicants. (Nowadays, it only takes one out 
of 20.)

I also quoted administrators at Jared’s high school, who described him as a 
less-than-stellar student and expressed dismay at Harvard’s decision.

“There was no way anybody in the administrative office of the school thought 
he would on the merits get into Harvard,’’ a former official at the Frisch 
school in Paramus, New Jersey, told me. “His GPA [grade point average] did not 
warrant it, his SAT scores did not warrant it. We thought, for sure, there was 
no way this was going to happen. Then, lo and behold, Jared was accepted. It 
was a little bit disappointing because there were at the time other kids we 
thought should really get in on the merits, and they did not.’’

Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said in an email on Thursday 
that “the allegation’’ that Charles Kushner’s gift to Harvard was related to 
Jared’s admission “is and always has been false”. His parents, Charles and 
Seryl Kushner, “are enormously generous and have donated over $100m to 
universities, hospitals and other charitable causes. Jared Kushner was an 
excellent student in high school and graduated from Harvard with honours.’’ 
(About 90% of Jared’s 2003 class at Harvard also graduated with honours.)

My Kushner discoveries were an offshoot of my research for a chapter on 
Harvard donors. Somebody had slipped me a document I had long coveted: the 
membership list of Harvard’s Committee on University Resources. The university 
wooed more than 400 of its biggest givers and most promising prospects by 
putting them on this committee and inviting them to campus periodically to be 
wined, dined and subjected to lectures by eminent professors.

My idea was to figure out how many children of these corporate titans, oil 
barons, money managers, lawyers, high-tech consultants and old-money heirs had 
gone to Harvard. A disproportionate tally might suggest that the university 
eased its standards for the offspring of wealthy backers.

I began working through the list, poring over Who’s Who in America and Harvard 
class reunion reports for family information. Charles and Seryl Kushner were 
both on the committee. I had never heard of them, but their joint presence 
struck me as a sign that Harvard’s fundraising machine held the couple in 
especially fond regard.


The clips showed that Charles Kushner’s empire encompassed 25,000 New Jersey 
apartments, along with extensive office, industrial and retail space and 
undeveloped land. Unlike most of his fellow committee members, though, Kushner 
was not a Harvard man. He had graduated from New York University. This 
eliminated the sentimental tug of the alma mater as a reason for him to give to 
Harvard, leaving another likely explanation: his children.

Sure enough, his sons Jared and Joshua had both enrolled there.

Women and advocacy groups are preparing for the most serious assault on 
reproductive rights in decades after Hillary Clinton, the first female nominee 
of a major party, lost the presidential election toDonald Trump

Trump’s election, in tandem with an undivided Congress under Republican 
control, 33 GOP governors and an open seat on the supreme court with the 
possibility of more appointments, has cast serious uncertainty about the future 
of abortion in the US, advocates say.

“It’s really bad – bad as we’ve ever seen it,” said Donna Crane, the 
vice-president of policy for Naral, a pro-choice advocacy group.

Like many of his policy views, Trump’s stance on women’s reproductive rights 
has shifted throughout his campaign, includingthree contradictory positions on 
abortion in three hours 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/03/donald-trumps-ever-shifting-positions-on-abortion/>
. In an interview on Sunday with CBS’s 60 Minutes, Trump reiterated his vow to 
appoint conservative and pro-life supreme court justices, which could gradually 
restrict abortion access and even lead to overturning Roe v Wade, the 
43-year-old ruling that legalized abortion in the US. (Trump, who appears to 
have anincongruous understanding 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-gay-marriage-abortion-supreme-court/>
 of how the supreme court operates, had previously suggested this would happen “
automatically 
<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/trump-ill-appoint-supreme-court-justices-to-overturn-roe-v-wade-abortion-case.html>
”.)


The prospect of overturning Roe v Wade has set off alarm bells among women’s 
health advocates, who are already fighting to hold the line against an 
avalanche of regulations meant to restrict access to abortions at the state 
level. But experts saying dismantling the precedent would be much more 
difficult than Trump seems to think it will be.

“Roe has withstood the test of time, over 40 years,” said Kelly Baden, interim 
senior director of US policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive 
Rights, noting that US supreme court justices take precedents seriously even 
when they disagree with them. “It has survived anti-choice administrations, 
including ones that have pushed to appoint anti-choice justices to the supreme 
court.”

In the interview, Trump said that if Roe v Wade is overturned, then women 
would “have to go to another state”. Asked if that was acceptable, he replied: 
“Well, we’ll see what happens. It’s got a long way to go.”

odds’

Islam is a political ideology. It is a political ideology. It definitely hides 
behind this notion of it being a religion. And I have a very, very tough time 
because I don’t see a lot of people screaming ‘Jesus Christ’ with hatchets or 
machetes or rifles shooting up clubs or hatcheting, literally axing families on 
a train, or like they just killed a couple of police officers with a machete. 
It’s unbelievable. So we have a problem.

It’s like cancer. You know, I’ve gone through cancer in my own life. So it’s 
like cancer. And it’s a like a malignant cancer, though, in this case. It has 
metastasized.
 
TMZ has gotten exclusive access to film a one-hour special about 
president-elect Donald Trump’s home and life. The president-elect is very 
excited about it.

From a written statement submitted to Congress 
<http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/20/us/senator-urges-withdrawal-of-judicial-nomination.html>
 in 1986 by Thomas Figures, a former assistant United States Attorney, about 
Jeff Sessions, then a nominee for a federal district judgeship:

Mr. Sessions called me into his office and indicated he felt I had been unduly 
harsh with the secretary. Mr. Sessions admonished me to ‘be careful what you 
say to white folks.’

Had Mr. Sessions merely urged me to be careful about what I said to ‘folks,’ 
that admonition would have been quite reasonable. But that was not the language 
that he used.

There was a period in our own lifetimes when blacks were regularly admonished 
to be particularly polite or deferential, and a remark of that sort may just 
have slipped out inadvertently.

Much of official Washington is wondering whether Trump will implement the 
agenda that won him the presidency. Some of Trump’s defenders, like tech 
investor Peter Thiel, contend that Trumpshould not be taken literally 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/peter-thiel-defends-donald-trump-muslim-ban-mexico-wall>
.

But the Democratic senator from Oregon shows no signs of interest in that 
discussion. As perhaps the Democratic party’s premier civil libertarian on 
Capitol Hill, his anticipation of theTrump administration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration> starts from the 
perspective that the president-elect will govern as he campaigned: against 
Muslims, against immigrants, for torture, for surveillance. Wyden, from his 
perch on the intelligence committee, is preparing for a four-year battle.

“We’re going to have to make sure now that a political agenda doesn’t replace 
a set of constitutional priorities. That’s the heart of it,” Wyden said in an 
interview with the Guardian this week.


Wyden is one of the few national politicians who can plausibly claim to have 
fought national security abuses and championed civil liberties with equal vigor 
in the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations. He is far more 
comfortable discussing policies or proposals than he is discussing 
personalities, opting to refer to Trump simply as the president-elect.

“You look at some of what the president-elect has to say and it certainly 
ought to be a wake-up call from the standpoint of potential abuse of power,” 
Wyden said.

A quote sticking in Wyden’s mind these days is one Trump issued in July after 
the Democratic National Committee hack, which US intelligence has blamed on 
Russia. Trump, discussing his political opponents, mused: “Honestly, I wish I 
had that power. I’d love to have that power 
<http://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12298664/trump-dnc-hacking-power>.” By 20 
January, it will no longer be hypothetical.

The feisty online campaign to persuade shoppers to boycott Ivanka Trump’s 
fashion products and the retailers that stock them, #GrabYourWallet, appears to 
be biting.

Shoes.com dropped the footwear line pedaled by president-elect Donald Trump’s 
elder daughter Ivanka shortly after the election and now interior décor 
specialist Bellacor has dropped the “Trump Home” range of chandeliers and other 
domestic trinkets from its website.

Both had been targeted by California businesswoman Shannon Coulter, who 
created #GrabYourWallet on Twitter in October after theDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> “grab them by the pussy” 
audio tape scandal.


'You can do anything': Trump brags on tape about using fame to get women

She revealed in a Guardian exclusive 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/ivanka-trump-boycott-clothing->
 at the time that his appalling boasting on tape reminded her of being sexually 
harassed by her boss at a Silicon Valley job in her youth.


Coulter was outraged by the Donald but also by Ivanka’s vigorous support of 
her father’s presidential campaign with barely a “tisk”, while at the same time 
promoting her fashion and accessories line with messages of empowerment for the 
independent-minded, stylish working woman.

“I’m elated,” Coulter told the Guardian on Thursday night about Shoes.com and 
Bellacor’s decisions.

The retailers didn’t cite #GrabYourWallet specifically but coincidentally 
contacted supporters of the campaign who had complained to them to explain they 
were dropping the products.

Coulter tweets about her campaign have been viewed more than nine million 
times and the #GrabYourWallet hashtag has been read or spread 200 million times 
in just over a month.

She began by posting a list of retailers that sell items from the Ivanka Trump 
Collection, including the big hitters at the mall, Macy’s, Nordstrom, Nieman 
Marcus and Lord & Taylor, and high profile online names such as Amazon and 
Zappos, urging consumers not only to boycott them but to contact them to 
protest.

With the traditional post-Thanksgiving retail-binge imminent, none of the big 
guys have budged – yet.

“I have plenty of indications that the larger players are paying very close 
attention to this. I’m not surprised that the smaller players would be the 
first to drop the products, however. And I know the message is getting 
through,” said Coulter.

She hopes that even if big retailers don’t want to appear partisan, now that 
Trump is president-elect and his family members are poised to benefit “big 
league”, that they will feel an unpleasant “conflict of interest” in stocking 
Trump products, she said.

#GrabYourWallet has sparked a backlash from some Trump voters who are now keen 
to encourage boycotts of the retailers that boycott Trump.

Meanwhile Coulter is already blue sky thinking about whether #GrabYourWallet 
could grow into a bigger phenomenon as a shopping ethics monitor that rates 
companies by their respect for women and inclusiveness in general.


“It could be measuring how many women or people of color they have in senior 
executive leadership, the ethical dimensions of the products they carry. We 
want to support companies that take the high road,” she said.
 
Illinois congressman Luis Gutiérrez, on attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions:

If you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the 
closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Senator 
Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man.

No senator has fought harder against the hopes and aspirations of Latinos, 
immigrants, and people of color than Sen. Sessions. He is a staunch opponent of 
legal immigration and someone who has blocked every effort to improve, 
modernize, and humanize our immigration system, which is two or three decades 
out-of-date.

He ran for the Senate because he was deemed by the Senate Judiciary Committee 
as too racist to serve as a federal judge. He is the kind of person who will 
set back law enforcement, civil rights, the courts, and increase America’s mass 
incarceration industry and erase 50 years of progress.
