Our first few hours aboard Bessie Ellen were hands-on. As storm Katie 
tightened her grip on the Cornish coast, the 112-year-old sailing ship was 
ploughing through high winds, and minutes after casting off we were pulling up 
sails, tacking and steering. Owner and skipper Nikki Alford commanded respect 
while instilling a sense of fun, and within half an hour had turned us eight 
strangers into a crew capable of steering a two-masted wooden ship through a 
storm. In a couple of hours I’d hauled ropes with Anton, who’s in his late 70s, 
and hoisted sails with a father and son from Exeter. We learned how to tack and 
could soon just about name all the sails.

I had joined the tall ship at Fowey for a two-night taster weekend. Apart from 
taking the Seacat from Liverpool to Dublin when I was eight, I had never sailed 
before. We were a mixed bunch, ranging from competent sailors to, well, me. 
Either way, everyone had a role. “I like to get everyone involved,” said Nikki. 
“I want people to feel they’re part of a crew – and learn a thing or two.”

Once the storm passed, Bessie Ellen picked up speed. The clouds lifted and we 
were surrounded by ocean and azure sky. In the choppy waves beneath the bow a 
school of dolphins appeared, jumping in perfect unison. London-based 
twentysomething Kate (another non-sailor) was soon climbing the rigging for a 
better view. Wildlife spotting is part of the fun: seal colonies, basking 
sharks, puffins.

Built in Plymouth in 1904 and expected to last no more than 20 years, Bessie 
Ellen is the last wooden trading ketch still under sail in Britain. At 35 
metres long, and carrying up to 150 tonnes, she spent her early life taking 
bulk cargoes such as clay, peat and salt around the UK and Ireland.

In 2000 Nikki rescued her from a dockyard in Denmark and took her to Plymouth 
for renovation. “Me and a group of friends spent some very happy years working 
on Bessie Ellen,” said Nikki, who fell in love with the boat at the age of 18 
after seeing a photograph of her. “It was one of the best times of my life.”

The ship sails in a range of locations: summer voyages to the Outer Hebrides 
are particularly impressive, and there are plans to offer trips to the Arctic 
archipelago of Svalbard, always with an ever-changing global crew.

After a few hours on the water we docked in the 18th-century harbour of 
Charlestown, near St Austell. Originally built to export copper and import 
coal, it’s a popular setting for films and TV series such as Hornblower and 
Poldark. We drank tea and ginger beer – against seasickness – before heading to 
nearby Silver Mines for the night.

Dinner was served in the 12-bed sleeping area we shared, which became a 
temporary dining room. (Lunches were eaten in the sunshine on deck.) Chef Pete, 
who came as a guest and loved it so much he joined the team, creates beautiful 
meals in the tiny, rocking galley.

“I try and incorporate a local flavour into all my meals,” said Pete. “Mussels 
in Scotland, fish from the markets in Cornwall.” We feasted on risotto made 
with nettles we’d picked on the shore in Fowey, fresh mackerel pate and rhubarb 
and vanilla mousse, and bonded over beer and wine from the honesty bar, and 
whisky brought by one of the guests.

The hold now has 12 built-in bunk beds – simple but comfortable. The 
exhaustion of a day’s sailing combined with the lulling of the waves and the 
murmur of a mystery snorer gave me some of the best nights’ sleep I’d had in 
months.

There was time on the last morning for more exploration of Fowey, inspiration 
for many writers and artists. A footpath led to Pont Pill, where novelist 
Daphne Du Maurier found the wrecked schooner Jane Slade. Its carved figurehead 
inspired her first novel, The Loving Spirit.

Over a Cornish ale in Fowey, Nikki told tales of her earlier life as a ship 
hand – seeing pirates in the Malacca Strait and being arrested in Vietnam after 
police mistook them for spies – tales you don’t hear in luxury yachting 
circles. “I simply love being on the sea,” she said. “It’s such a unique, 
amazing way to explore the world.”

It’s true. Sailing past coves and into historic ports gives a sense of 
Cornwall’s nautical heritage in a way land trips can’t, and there is a definite 
romance to sailing a ship as old and experienced as Bessie Ellen.

“Britain has neglected its sailing past,” she said. “There’s an idea now that 
sailing belongs to a certain kind of world. But it’s fun. It’s tough, gritty, 
an adventure … that’s what people love.”

• The trip was provided by Bessie Ellen Charters (07800 825382, 
bessie-ellen.com <https://bessie-ellen.com>). Three-day taster weekends in 
Cornwall cost from £290pp, including all onboard meals.Longer trips out of 
other UK ports are also available
