Hello Brendan

As well as a novelist, BB was an actor and an artist. Her paintings were 
incredibly vigorous and original. What do you think the relationship was 
between these three different parts of her artistic output?

That is quite a complex question and deserves a longer answer than I can come 
up with in such a short time. There certainly seems to be a relationship 
between her early life as an actress and being a writer - both have to adopt 
personas to get into character and so on, and both have to be able to tell a 
story and capture dramatic and emotional scenes. As for Beryl's paintings, you 
are right they are original - one of the things that is interesting about them 
is that her paintings a rarely simply illustrations of her writing, they are 
dramatic scenes in their own right. One of Beryl's most striking pictures - Did 
You Think I would Leave You Dying When There's Room on my Horse for Two - 
captures the moment when Beryl's mother-in-law tried to shoot her, a scene that 
also figures in The Bottle Factory Outing, but the two representations are 
completely different, have a very different artistic purpose and invoke very 
different responses in the reader/viewer.

JudeTheExplicit <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4775239> asks:

I found a sort of iconoclastic glee at work in Harriet Said (& Master Georgie 
/ Young Adolf etc) which I really enjoyed. I haven’t read Huysmans (where 
should I start?) but he seems to have been similarly iconoclastic. Was it this 
shared trait that attracted you to both?

As for Huysmans, I would start with the decadent classic Against Nature (A 
Rebours), or perhaps Stranded (En Rade), which is a brilliant and unsettling 
blend of decadent and naturalist elements. Another favourite of mine is 
Parisian Sketches (Croquis parisiens). I don't think my attraction to both 
writers is based on any shared elements - though there is a kind of black 
humour running through Huysmans' work - Against Nature is a very funny book - 
which is perhaps analogous to Beryl's. They also share a contrarian attitude to 
conventional platitudes so maybe there is more that links them than I 
previously thought. Stylistically though, they are very different writers.

Just had a question come in from a Twitter follower, Sophie Coulombeau:

‘As a scholar of Hester Thrale’s work,I love Beryl’s According to Queeney. 
Could you tell us a little about how she came to be interested in the Thrale 
family, and why she wanted to write a novel about them?’
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16840088> Guardian contributor

In this Beryl was very much influenced by Colin Haycraft, her publisher. He 
was a Classics scholar who loved Gibbon and Johnson, and could quote from them 
copiously. Beryl read Bowell's journals at Colin's prompting, and over the 
years had become fascinated with the set up of Johnson's menage, and the 
curious three-way relationship between him, Mrs Thrale and Mr Thrale. Beryl 
certainly put some of Colin Haycraft into her portrayal of Johnson, and there 
is something of herself in both Hester and Queeney, representing Beryl at 
different ages.

Did Beryl turn to historical novels because she reached an age where she was 
more nostalgic for her own past?

No, I don't think that's the reason - Beryl first did a 'historical' novel in 
the late 1970s with Young Adolf. You could also argue that An Awfully Big 
Adventure or A Quiet Life or the Dressmaker, being set in the 1940s and 1950s 
were more appropriate vehicles for any feelings of nostalgia she might have 
had, rather than novels set in the far past. She would often say she started 
writing historical novels becuase she had used up her own past, but if you read 
my biography it is clear that isn't true and that she didn't write about many 
experiences which many people would consider important in their lives. From the 
eighties onwards, she couldn't really write about her present day emotional 
life, because she had begun an affair with her publisher, Colin Haycraft. 
Instead she used 'historical' fiction to write about emotional situations and 
the things close to her, but presented it at one remove, through the veil of 
historical characters and a historical situation.

I guess I should ask the question about the Booker prize... I know that Beryl 
Bainbridge <https://www.theguardian.com/books/berylbainbridge> was generally 
very tactful about not winning in public. But did she take it so well in 
private? Was she not particularly bothered? Or did it - to use a notorious 
instance - sting to be stitched up in the year Amsterdam won...

Yes, the not winning aspect of the Booker was a bit galling to her at the end. 
Not that she would have said she deserved it, she was too modest for that, but 
I think deep down she would have liked to have had the public recognition of 
her peers. The money would also have come in handy - although Beryl got a lot 
of critical acclaim, Duckworth was a small independent publisher and sales were 
not particularly large. Consequently her royalties were not as large as they 
might have been had she been hyped and marketed by a larger publishing 
conglomerate - although she herself would never have wanted to be marketed or 
published in that way.

I’m currently reading The Birthday Boys. The descriptions of place are very 
good but I’m assuming Bainbridge wasn’t able to travel to Madeira, South 
Trinidad Island and Antartica? How did she research this novel?

Beryl read a lot of contemporary accounts when she was researching for one of 
her 'historical' novels. Going back to original sources - Johnson's letters, or 
Scott's diaries, gave her a sense of the person and place through their 
language. I accompanied her on a trip to the Royal Geographical institute once 
to do some reasearch for The Birthday Boys, but there was also books from the 
London Library and correspondence with people who were experts in their field, 
such as Mary Hyde for johnson, Michael Barthorp for the Crimea, and so on. I 
think Beryl's attitude was that people in the past are basically the same as 
they are now, all that changes is the particular situation and the language 
that you use to express it, so she would use her own experiences, or those of 
people she knew, and simply transpose them into the historical past.

One of the things that fascinated me about your biography was the difference

Did this disregard for historical truth make her a difficult person to know?

Both I think. Some people found it difficult when Beryl contradicted their 
version of events, but the desire, or the compulsion, to fictionalise was 
obviously at the root of her skill as a novelist. She was an amazingly good 
raconteur, and never wasted a word in telling her stories.

Back in the ‘80s and ‘90s I was reading a lot of Alice Thomas Ellis. Even 
though I knew she and Bainbridge were close, I never read any Bainbridge. I 
don’t know why not and I feel a little shamefaced saying it. (I lovedThe Bottle 
Factory Outing now that I’ve got round to reading it.) I can’t help but be 
fascinated by the relationship between the two women and have a couple of 
questions if you are able to answer them.

What did Bainbridge think of Thomas Ellis’s writing? And did Bainbridge 
believe that Anna Haycraft’s editing role was central to Bainbridge’s 
development as a novelist?

Your question seems to be suggesting that the friendship between the two women 
in The Bottle Factory Outing is a depiction of Beryl's friendship with Alice 
Thomas Ellis (Anna Haycraft), but this is not the case. In the novel Freda was 
based on a friend Beryl knew during the 1970s called Pauline. As for Beryl's 
friendship with Anna it was nothing if not complicated, and a brief outline of 
the way in which the two women's lives intersected at various points over the 
years explains why (for fuller details see either the biography itself or the 
Guardian review of it). In the early 1970s Anna was certainly influential in 
encouraging Beryl in her writing career, though it was her husband Colin who 
did the hand-on editing of the texts. The relationship between the Haycrafts 
and Beryl was a symbiotic one - Duckworth benefitted from Beryl's early 
critical success, and Beryl benefitted as a writer from their joint input and 
encouragement. When Anna started writing novels herself (it is a moot point 
whether Anna would have started writing if it hadn't been for Beryl's example) 
this added another layer of complexity to their relationship, and the fact that 
around the same time Beryl began an affair with Colin obviously muddies the 
water still further. By the time I came on the scene Anna's role as editor was 
a fairly hand-off one - she would read the opening chapter and make comments, 
but then she wouldn't see the book until it was finished. I don't think Beryl 
could read Anna's work neutrally as works of fiction - it would have been 
impossible for her not to see the situation between herself, Anna and Colin 
reflected in the characters and plots of Anna's books.

Two questions:

When translating Huysmans, do you use any of the previous English editions at 
all? Or do you translate straight from the original? Do you know who did the 
Fortune Press translation ofA Rebours; it’s rather odd? I have a copy of the 
[1931] edition bound in vellum and in blue wraps and have never seen one 
anywhere else – do you know anything about it? A bookseller has written ‘1/25?’ 
on the ffe.

With regards to Bainbridge, the range of different subjects covered by her 
novels is mighty impressive: was she a bit of a dilettante; how/why did an 
initial interest evolve into the deeper pursuit necessary to writing a novel on 
the subject?

1. A mixture of both. I produce a version directly from the French so that I 
get something that I think is correct, and then once I have a rough draft I 
will go through other translations to see where we differ as to meaning or 
expression. As for the 1931 edition of Against the Grain its publishing history 
is a bit too involved to go into here. I treat it in more depth on my Huysmans 
site - this page should answer your questions://www.huysmans.org/fortune.htm 
<http://www.huysmans.org/fortune.htm>. Later Fortune Press editions of the book 
are slightly bowdlerised.
2 As far as Beryl's choice of novels was concerned sometimes one thing just 
leads to another. She had worked at the Playhouse and hadn't written about that 
period/experience so that was a partial impetus for An Awfully Big Adventure, 
and during the writing of that novel - which centered around a performance of 
Peter Pan - she found out that one of the last letters Captain Scott had 
written before his death had been to James Barrie, and this piqued her interest 
in the Pole, which she had already been interested in having read The Worst 
Journey in the World. The fact that the Titanic sank in the same year as Scott 
and his men were found frozen in their tent prompted the idea of writing about 
the sinking of the ship in Every Man for Himself. The inspiration for Watson's 
Apology started from an article written by Mervyn Horder, the former owner of 
Duckworth, Beryl's publisher. Her interest in the story's potential was given 
further impetus by Colin Haycraft, who took over the running of Duckworth from 
Horder, as he encouraged her to write a novel about it, and did some 
preliminary research for it. Ultimately though, the reasons why an author 
chooses to write one particular novel rather than another is never entirely 
explainable.

Another question, if I may...

I have not read your biography of Bainbridge (forgive me, I can afford about 
one book a month and we have no public libraries round my way), so I am sure 
this is answered in that, but...

Why did she need an amanuensis?

One reason was that Beryl was not the most technically minded of people and 
she needed help with the various practical and techical aspects of being a 
writer - dealing with a word processor and a computer operating system before 
the universal ease-of-use philosophy of Macs and Windows. There were floppy 
disks to be fiddled with, printers to be maintained, articles to be faxed and 
so on. Another reason was that just before I began working for her she had 
started writing a column for the London Evening Standard, which brought her an 
audience that was many orders larger than the one that knew her as a novelist. 
Consequently she was asked to do more things and received more post and 
telephone messages. My role, at least initially, was to help her get on top of 
the accumulation of demands on her time so that she could concentrate on

Dear Brendan

Many thanks for coming here to join us.

I only read my first Bainbridge (The Bottle Factory Outing) two days ago when 
my copy arrived.

I will confess to finding, as so many others did, both Brenda and Freda to be 
dislikeable: prejudiced, racist fantasists with little or no real humanity in 
them.

And yet people keep saying they represent aspects of Bainbridge’s own life and 
personality.

Having known her, do you feel that, particularly when she was younger, she may 
have suffered from self-loathing or shame? And if not, how do you explain her 
deeply unsympathetic characters in this book?

To me characters in good works of fiction should resemble real people i.e. 
they are flawed human beings, who lead messy emotional lives and do things 
which either at the time or in hindsight they wish they hadn't. I don't think 
this necessarily makes them unlikeable or unsympathetic - as one can tell from 
the many people who have a positive response to the novel. I would say that a 
lot of people identify with Brenda's (or Freda's for that matter) character 
flaws and failings, as they recognise those failings in themselves. Having said 
that, I do think that when Beryl was young she suffered from a self image 
problem - she Was unsatisfied with her physical appearance and felt guilty that 
she didn't love her parents enough or was too hard on them.

Hi Brendan, I very much enjoyed the reading of Beryl Bainbridge’s biography on 
Radio 4. It sounded like a labour of love, and certainly conveyed affection and 
admiration for this wonderfully talented writer.

It’s reasonable to assume that the Bottle Factory Outing, which I found an 
immensely powerful, compelling, brilliantly written and moving book, stems from 
Beryl’s Bainbridge’s own experiences, but how personal do you think it is? That 
is, do you think it goes deeper than being just a basis for the novel, or does 
it explore deep issues close to her heart? How far are one or both of the 
central characters, Freda and Brenda, based on herself, if at all.

Perhaps that’s a stupid question, I realise, and probably impossible to 
answer, but I’d appreciate your opinion on how personal you thought her writing 
was? Thanks.

Those are all good questions and as you say would require longer space than 
can be gone into here. In general I steered clear of trying to use incidents in 
Beryl's novels as proof of, or illustrations of, events from her real life 
because while her experiences certainly fed into her fiction I don't think 
there is a one-to-one relationship between the two. In the novel certain of 
Brenda's life experiences resemble Beryl's, but what is left out of the novel 
would have been just as significant to Beryl at the time, if not more so, than 
what was put in. This has no bearing on the book's quality as a piece of 
fiction, but it would obviously be misleading to try and read her fiction as a 
guide to the events of her life or her state of mind. For example, in the early 
1970s she had come out of a relationship with the painter Don McKinlay which 
certainly affected her deeply on an emotional level, but this is barely touched 
on or gone into in the novel. Also as a single mother at the time, a lot of 
Beryl's life would have been tangled up in trying to balance her own emotional 
life and bringing up three children, but again this aspect of her life is 
completely absent from the book.
As for Freda, she was loosely based on a friend of Beryl's called Pauline, but 
again the parallels cannot be made absolutely explicit - Beryl and Pauline 
never lived together for example, as Brenda and Freda do in the book, and, like 
Beryl, Pauline was also a mother, so again a whole area of Pauline/Freda's life 
is expunged for the sake of the novel's plot line.

lljones  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15106370> asks:

Is it really incomplete? If so, what might Bainbridge have had in mind for 
subsequent scenes?

I’d be surprised if Bainbridge was actually at the Ambassador Hotel on 
6//5/68. But did she perchance drive across America in a camper van in the late 
60’s? It sure feels like she might have.

Yes, The Girl in the Polka Dot Dress was incomplete at the time of Beryl's 
death. Beryl did not map out the final chapter, but had talked of Rose knocking 
Harold's hand as he fired at Wheeler and shooting Kennedy by mistake. However, 
if she had come to write the scene my feeling is that it would most probably 
have ended up differently.
You are right that Beryl wasn't actually at the Ambassador's Hotel on that 
day, but she did drive across America with a man called Harold in a camper van 
in June 1968, though once again the novel should not to be taken as an accurate 
guide to the events of her real life.

Vasco Resende <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16388770> asks:

Taking the hint from Sam’s introductory text, do you find any trace of 
Joris-Karl Huysmans or other decadent writers such as Barbey d’Aurevilly and 
Villiers de l’Isle-Adam in Beryl Bainbridge’s fiction? Her interest in catholic 
memorabilia is known and there is definitely a gothic undertone pervading her 
novels, but other than that do you think Beryl to be an heiress of the French 
decadent movement of the late 19th century?

I'd wish I could say that Beryl had read Huysmans - whose name she always 
pronounced as "Hoosimans" - but she hadn't, so she couldn't have been 
influenced by his work directly, either in its Decadent or its Catholic phase. 
As far as Catholic novelists were concerned she always professed to be an 
admirer of Mauriac's Thérèse and Graham Greene's The End of the Affair.

I’m pleased to say that on Friday 28 October Beryl Bainbridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/berylbainbridge> biographer Brendan King 
will be here to answer questions about the great writer.

Not only did Brendan King have access to Beryl Bainbridge’s extensive archives 
and letters, he also knew his subject well. He worked for her for 23 years and 
as an amaneusis, and, as he recounts in the biography he also helped prepare 
her final (and unfinished) novel,The Girl in the Polka Dot Dress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/29/girl-polkadot-dress-beryl-bainbridge-review>
, for publication after her death.


You can get a flavour of their relationship from this charming piece he wrote  
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/brendan-king-on-the-great-author-dame-beryl-bainbridge/>
for The Telegraph. As for the biography itself, the Evening Standard called it 
“first rate”, The Times “superb” and it wasreviewed equally warmly  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/31/beryl-bainbridge-love-by-all-sorts-of-means-brendan-king-review>
in The Guardian .


So he is a fantastic person to have along to talk about this enduringly 
brilliant and fascinating writer. You may also be intrigued to learn that 
Brendan King is a translator and expert in the French decadent novelist JK 
Husymans and has translated several of his deliciously naughty books for the 
excellent Dedalus publishers. It would be a shame to miss the opportunity to 
ask about that too.


Asking questions is simple - just write a comment below the line. Brendan will 
be here from 1pm on Friday 28 October, but please feel free to get yours in

Hello Brendan

As well as a novelist, BB was an actor and an artist. Her paintings were 
incredibly vigorous and original. What do you think the relationship was 
between these three different parts of her artistic output?

That is quite a complex question and deserves a longer answer than I can come 
up with in such a short time. There certainly seems to be a relationship 
between her early life as an actress and being a writer - both have to adopt 
personas to get into character and so on, and both have to be able to tell a 
story and capture dramatic and emotional scenes. As for Beryl's paintings, you 
are right they are original - one of the things that is interesting about them 
is that her paintings a rarely simply illustrations of her writing, they are 
dramatic scenes in their own right. One of Beryl's most striking pictures - Did 
You Think I would Leave You Dying When There's Room on my Horse for Two - 
captures the moment when Beryl's mother-in-law tried to shoot her, a scene that 
also figures in The Bottle Factory Outing, but the two representations are 
completely different, have a very different artistic purpose and invoke very 
different responses in the reader/viewer.

I found a sort of iconoclastic glee at work in Harriet Said (& Master Georgie

should I start?) but he seems to have been similarly iconoclastic. Was it this 
shared trait that attracted you to both?

As for Huysmans, I would start with the decadent classic Against Nature (A 
Rebours), or perhaps Stranded (En Rade), which is a brilliant and unsettling 
blend of decadent and naturalist elements. Another favourite of mine is 
Parisian Sketches (Croquis parisiens). I don't think my attraction to both 
writers is based on any shared elements - though there is a kind of black 
humour running through Huysmans' work - Against Nature is a very funny book - 
which is perhaps analogous to Beryl's. They also share a contrarian attitude to 
conventional platitudes so maybe there is more that links them than I 
previously thought. Stylistically though, they are very different writers.

Just had a question come in from a Twitter follower, Sophie Coulombeau:

‘As a scholar of Hester Thrale’s work,I love Beryl’s According to Queeney. 
Could you tell us a little about how she came to be interested in the Thrale 
family, and why she wanted to write a novel about them?’

In this Beryl was very much influenced by Colin Haycraft, her publisher. He 
was a Classics scholar who loved Gibbon and Johnson, and could quote from them 
copiously. Beryl read Bowell's journals at Colin's prompting, and over the 
years had become fascinated with the set up of Johnson's menage, and the 
curious three-way relationship between him, Mrs Thrale and Mr Thrale. Beryl 
certainly put some of Colin Haycraft into her portrayal of Johnson, and there 
is something of herself in both Hester and Queeney, representing Beryl at 
different ages.
 
ackwak <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3255127> says:

Did Beryl turn to historical novels because she reached an age where she was 
more nostalgic for her own past?

2016 1:40pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86354295> 
No, I don't think that's the reason - Beryl first did a 'historical' novel in 
the late 1970s with Young Adolf. You could also argue that An Awfully Big 
Adventure or A Quiet Life or the Dressmaker, being set in the 1940s and 1950s 
were more appropriate vehicles for any feelings of nostalgia she might have 
had, rather than novels set in the far past. She would often say she started 
writing historical novels becuase she had used up her own past, but if you read 
my biography it is clear that isn't true and that she didn't write about many 
experiences which many people would consider important in their lives. From the 
eighties onwards, she couldn't really write about her present day emotional 
life, because she had begun an affair with her publisher, Colin Haycraft. 
Instead she used 'historical' fiction to write about emotional situations and 
the things close to her, but presented it at one remove, through the veil of 
historical characters and a historical situation.

I guess I should ask the question about the Booker prize... I know that Beryl 
Bainbridge <https://www.theguardian.com/books/berylbainbridge> was generally 
very tactful about not winning in public. But did she take it so well in 
private? Was she not particularly bothered? Or did it - to use a notorious 
instance - sting to be stitched up in the year Amsterdam won...

Yes, the not winning aspect of the Booker was a bit galling to her at the end. 
Not that she would have said she deserved it, she was too modest for that, but 
I think deep down she would have liked to have had the public recognition of 
her peers. The money would also have come in handy - although Beryl got a lot 
of critical acclaim, Duckworth was a small independent publisher and sales were 
not particularly large. Consequently her royalties were not as large as they 
might have been had she been hyped and marketed by a larger publishing 
conglomerate - although she herself would never have wanted to be marketed or 
published in that way.

Beryl read a lot of contemporary accounts when she was researching for one of 
her 'historical' novels. Going back to original sources - Johnson's letters, or 
Scott's diaries, gave her a sense of the person and place through their 
language. I accompanied her on a trip to the Royal Geographical institute once 
to do some reasearch for The Birthday Boys, but there was also books from the 
London Library and correspondence with people who were experts in their field, 
such as Mary Hyde for johnson, Michael Barthorp for the Crimea, and so on. I 
think Beryl's attitude was that people in the past are basically the same as 
they are now, all that changes is the particular situation and the language 
that you use to express it, so she would use her own experiences, or those of 
people she knew, and simply transpose them into the historical past.

Did this disregard for historical truth make her a difficult person to know?

Both I think. Some people found it difficult when Beryl contradicted their 
version of events, but the desire, or the compulsion, to fictionalise was 
obviously at the root of her skill as a novelist. She was an amazingly good 
raconteur, and never wasted a word in telling her stories.
 
MsCarey  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11071608>asks:

Back in the ‘80s and ‘90s I was reading a lot of Alice Thomas Ellis. Even 
though I knew she and Bainbridge were close, I never read any Bainbridge. I 
don’t know why not and I feel a little shamefaced saying it. (I lovedThe Bottle 
Factory Outing now that I’ve got round to reading it.) I can’t help but be 
fascinated by the relationship between the two women and have a couple of 
questions if you are able to answer them.

What did Bainbridge think of Thomas Ellis’s writing? And did Bainbridge 
believe that Anna Haycraft’s editing role was central to Bainbridge’s 
development as a novelist?

Your question seems to be suggesting that the friendship between the two women 
in The Bottle Factory Outing is a depiction of Beryl's friendship with Alice 
Thomas Ellis (Anna Haycraft), but this is not the case. In the novel Freda was 
based on a friend Beryl knew during the 1970s called Pauline. As for Beryl's 
friendship with Anna it was nothing if not complicated, and a brief outline of 
the way in which the two women's lives intersected at various points over the 
years explains why (for fuller details see either the biography itself or the 
Guardian review of it). In the early 1970s Anna was certainly influential in 
encouraging Beryl in her writing career, though it was her husband Colin who 
did the hand-on editing of the texts. The relationship between the Haycrafts 
and Beryl was a symbiotic one - Duckworth benefitted from Beryl's early 
critical success, and Beryl benefitted as a writer from their joint input and 
encouragement. When Anna started writing novels herself (it is a moot point 
whether Anna would have started writing if it hadn't been for Beryl's example) 
this added another layer of complexity to their relationship, and the fact that 
around the same time Beryl began an affair with Colin obviously muddies the 
water still further. By the time I came on the scene Anna's role as editor was 
a fairly hand-off one - she would read the opening chapter and make comments, 
but then she wouldn't see the book until it was finished. I don't think Beryl 
could read Anna's work neutrally as works of fiction - it would have been 
impossible for her not to see the situation between herself, Anna and Colin 
reflected in the characters and plots of Anna's books.

Two questions:

When translating Huysmans, do you use any of the previous English editions at 
all? Or do you translate straight from the original? Do you know who did the 
Fortune Press translation ofA Rebours; it’s rather odd? I have a copy of the 
[1931] edition bound in vellum and in blue wraps and have never seen one 
anywhere else – do you know anything about it? A bookseller has written ‘1/25?’ 
on the ffe.

With regards to Bainbridge, the range of different subjects covered by her 
novels is mighty impressive: was she a bit of a dilettante; how/why did an 
initial interest evolve into the deeper pursuit necessary to writing a novel on 
the subject?

1. A mixture of both. I produce a version directly from the French so that I 
get something that I think is correct, and then once I have a rough draft I 
will go through other translations to see where we differ as to meaning or 
expression. As for the 1931 edition of Against the Grain its publishing history 
is a bit too involved to go into here. I treat it in more depth on my Huysmans 
site - this page should answer your questions://www.huysmans.org/fortune.htm 
<http://www.huysmans.org/fortune.htm>. Later Fortune Press editions of the book 
are slightly bowdlerised.
2 As far as Beryl's choice of novels was concerned sometimes one thing just 
leads to another. She had worked at the Playhouse and hadn't written about that 
period/experience so that was a partial impetus for An Awfully Big Adventure, 
and during the writing of that novel - which centered around a performance of 
Peter Pan - she found out that one of the last letters Captain Scott had 
written before his death had been to James Barrie, and this piqued her interest 
in the Pole, which she had already been interested in having read The Worst 
Journey in the World. The fact that the Titanic sank in the same year as Scott 
and his men were found frozen in their tent prompted the idea of writing about 
the sinking of the ship in Every Man for Himself. The inspiration for Watson's 
Apology started from an article written by Mervyn Horder, the former owner of 
Duckworth, Beryl's publisher. Her interest in the story's potential was given 
further impetus by Colin Haycraft, who took over the running of Duckworth from 
Horder, as he encouraged her to write a novel about it, and did some 
preliminary research for it. Ultimately though, the reasons why an author 
chooses to write one particular novel rather than another is never entirely 
explainable.
 
palfreyman  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2955975>asks:

Another question, if I may...

I have not read your biography of Bainbridge (forgive me, I can afford about 
one book a month and we have no public libraries round my way), so I am sure 
this is answered in that, but...

Why did she need an amanuensis?

2016 1:03pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86351467> 
One reason was that Beryl was not the most technically minded of people and 
she needed help with the various practical and techical aspects of being a 
writer - dealing with a word processor and a computer operating system before 
the universal ease-of-use philosophy of Macs and Windows. There were floppy 
disks to be fiddled with, printers to be maintained, articles to be faxed and 
so on. Another reason was that just before I began working for her she had 
started writing a column for the London Evening Standard, which brought her an 
audience that was many orders larger than the one that knew her as a novelist. 
Consequently she was asked to do more things and received more post and 
telephone messages. My role, at least initially, was to help her get on top of 
the accumulation of demands on her time so that she could concentrate on 
actually writing novels.

Dear Brendan

Many thanks for coming here to join us.

I only read my first Bainbridge (The Bottle Factory Outing) two days ago when 
my copy arrived.

I will confess to finding, as so many others did, both Brenda and Freda to be 
dislikeable: prejudiced, racist fantasists with little or no real humanity in 
them.

And yet people keep saying they represent aspects of Bainbridge’s own life and 
personality.

Having known her, do you feel that, particularly when she was younger, she may 
have suffered from self-loathing or shame? And if not, how do you explain her 
deeply unsympathetic characters in this book?

To me characters in good works of fiction should resemble real people i.e. 
they are flawed human beings, who lead messy emotional lives and do things 
which either at the time or in hindsight they wish they hadn't. I don't think 
this necessarily makes them unlikeable or unsympathetic - as one can tell from 
the many people who have a positive response to the novel. I would say that a 
lot of people identify with Brenda's (or Freda's for that matter) character 
flaws and failings, as they recognise those failings in themselves. Having said 
that, I do think that when Beryl was young she suffered from a self image 
problem - she Was unsatisfied with her physical appearance and felt guilty that 
she didn't love her parents enough or was too hard on them.

Hi Brendan, I very much enjoyed the reading of Beryl Bainbridge’s biography on 
Radio 4. It sounded like a labour of love, and certainly conveyed affection and 
admiration for this wonderfully talented writer.

It’s reasonable to assume that the Bottle Factory Outing, which I found an 
immensely powerful, compelling, brilliantly written and moving book, stems from 
Beryl’s Bainbridge’s own experiences, but how personal do you think it is? That 
is, do you think it goes deeper than being just a basis for the novel, or does 
it explore deep issues close to her heart? How far are one or both of the 
central characters, Freda and Brenda, based on herself, if at all.

Perhaps that’s a stupid question, I realise, and probably impossible to 
answer, but I’d appreciate your opinion on how personal you thought her writing

Those are all good questions and as you say would require longer space than 
can be gone into here. In general I steered clear of trying to use incidents in 
Beryl's novels as proof of, or illustrations of, events from her real life 
because while her experiences certainly fed into her fiction I don't think 
there is a one-to-one relationship between the two. In the novel certain of 
Brenda's life experiences resemble Beryl's, but what is left out of the novel 
would have been just as significant to Beryl at the time, if not more so, than 
what was put in. This has no bearing on the book's quality as a piece of 
fiction, but it would obviously be misleading to try and read her fiction as a 
guide to the events of her life or her state of mind. For example, in the early 
1970s she had come out of a relationship with the painter Don McKinlay which 
certainly affected her deeply on an emotional level, but this is barely touched 
on or gone into in the novel. Also as a single mother at the time, a lot of 
Beryl's life would have been tangled up in trying to balance her own emotional 
life and bringing up three children, but again this aspect of her life is 
completely absent from the book.
As for Freda, she was loosely based on a friend of Beryl's called Pauline, but 
again the parallels cannot be made absolutely explicit - Beryl and Pauline 
never lived together for example, as Brenda and Freda do in the book, and, like 
Beryl, Pauline was also a mother, so again a whole area of Pauline/Freda's life 
is expunged for the sake of the novel's plot line.
 
lljones  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15106370> asks:

Is it really incomplete? If so, what might Bainbridge have had in mind for 
subsequent scenes?

I’d be surprised if Bainbridge was actually at the Ambassador Hotel on 
6//5/68. But did she perchance drive across America in a camper van in the late 
60’s? It sure feels like she might have.

Yes, The Girl in the Polka Dot Dress was incomplete at the time of Beryl's 
death. Beryl did not map out the final chapter, but had talked of Rose knocking 
Harold's hand as he fired at Wheeler and shooting Kennedy by mistake. However, 
if she had come to write the scene my feeling is that it would most probably 
have ended up differently.
You are right that Beryl wasn't actually at the Ambassador's Hotel on that 
day, but she did drive across America with a man called Harold in a camper van 
in June 1968, though once again the novel should not to be taken as an accurate 
guide to the events of her real life.
 
Vasco Resende <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16388770> asks:

Taking the hint from Sam’s introductory text, do you find any trace of

Villiers de l’Isle-Adam in Beryl Bainbridge’s fiction? Her interest in catholic 
memorabilia is known and there is definitely a gothic undertone pervading her 
novels, but other than that do you think Beryl to be an heiress of the French 
decadent movement of the late 19th century?

I'd wish I could say that Beryl had read Huysmans - whose name she always 
pronounced as "Hoosimans" - but she hadn't, so she couldn't have been 
influenced by his work directly, either in its Decadent or its Catholic phase. 
As far as Catholic novelists were concerned she always professed to be an 
admirer of Mauriac's Thérèse and Graham Greene's The End of the Affair.
 
I’m pleased to say that on Friday 28 October Beryl Bainbridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/berylbainbridge> biographer Brendan King 
will be here to answer questions about the great writer.

Not only did Brendan King have access to Beryl Bainbridge’s extensive archives 
and letters, he also knew his subject well. He worked for her for 23 years and 
as an amaneusis, and, as he recounts in the biography he also helped prepare 
her final (and unfinished) novel,The Girl in the Polka Dot Dress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/29/girl-polkadot-dress-beryl-bainbridge-review>
, for publication after her death.


You can get a flavour of their relationship from this charming piece he wrote  
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/brendan-king-on-the-great-author-dame-beryl-bainbridge/>
for The Telegraph. As for the biography itself, the Evening Standard called it 
“first rate”, The Times “superb” and it wasreviewed equally warmly  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/31/beryl-bainbridge-love-by-all-sorts-of-means-brendan-king-review>
in The Guardian .


So he is a fantastic person to have along to talk about this enduringly 
brilliant and fascinating writer. You may also be intrigued to learn that 
Brendan King is a translator and expert in the French decadent novelist JK 
Husymans and has translated several of his deliciously naughty books for the 
excellent Dedalus publishers. It would be a shame to miss the opportunity to 
ask about that too.


Asking questions is simple - just write a comment below the line. Brendan will 
be here from 1pm on Friday 28 October, but please feel free to get yours in 
early.
