Closing Summary

• Ireland’s general election is on course to produce a hung parliament after 
voters punished the governing coalition after it implemented extensive 
austerity-led policies over the past five years in the wake of the country’s 
economic crash. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/27/ireland-election-likely-hung-parliament-talk-grand-coalition>
Fine Gael, the main party in the outgoing coalition, was set to lose up to 20 
seats as voters wreaked revenge on it and its junior partner, the Irish Labour 
Party.

• Taoiseach Enda Kenny has conceded that the option of re-forming Ireland’s 
coalition government of his party is no longer available. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/feb/27/ireland-general-election-exit-poll-coalition-fine-gael?page=with:block-56d21357e4b0bd5a0524ced3#block-56d21357e4b0bd5a0524ced3>
Ruling out stepping down – at least in the immediate term – he said that he 
had a responsibility as the head of government and would be considering options 
over the next 36 hours for providing a stable government for the country.

• The prospect of a “grand coalition” between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael – the 
two ostensibly christian democratic parties which have taken turns to lead 
successive Irish governments since independence – appears to be on the cards. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/feb/27/ireland-general-election-exit-poll-coalition-fine-gael?page=with:block-56d1d2bbe4b0d38537b1f8b9#block-56d1d2bbe4b0d38537b1f8b9>
The leader of Fianna Fail, which surprised pundits by staging a recovery after 
voters punished it in 2011 after Ireland’s crash, said that his party would be 
“practical” and that it was essential to form a government that was “coherent”.

• Sinn Fein was on course to continue its march in the Republic of Ireland, 
with an expected increase in its representation in the parliament, the Dail, by 
around 50%. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/feb/27/ireland-general-election-exit-poll-coalition-fine-gael?page=with:block-56d19b33e4b074a9f6b35dce#block-56d19b33e4b074a9f6b35dce>
However, the party looked set to miss out on key targets it had set for itself 
in some constituencies due to the apparent reluctance of many voters to give 
their second preference votes to the party that was once umbilically linked to 
the IRA.

• The former Labour leader Eamon Gilmore has said that the heavy losses now 
being suffered by the party are a consequence of necessary but unpopular 
decisions which it had to make after going into coalition five years ago. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/feb/27/ireland-general-election-exit-poll-coalition-fine-gael?page=with:block-56d1baa6e4b0bd5a0524ce1b#block-56d1baa6e4b0bd5a0524ce1b>
However, the results also suggested firm evidence of leftward turn on the part 
of record numbers of the electorate who were opting for a range of left of 
centre candidates.

Henry McDonald

So, is Fianna Fail really about to get into bed with its historic rival, Fine 
Gael? The Guardian’sIreland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> 
correspondent, Henry McDonald, has some possible answers:


Fianna Fail is hostile to the idea of a ‘grand coalition’ with Fine Gael 
because they fear handing over the lead role in the opposition to Sinn Fein.

Party sources told The Guardian tonight that they would prefer to try and form 
a minority government working with a range non-party aligned independent 
deputies in the Dail.

Two leading figures re-elected on the Fianna Fail ticket, John McGuinness and 
Willie O’Dea, have already ruled out breaking the Irish Civil War divide and 
entering government with their old rival Fine Gael.

One possible alternative to that would be either try and cobble together a 
minority coalition or let Fine Gael try the same according to Fianna Fail 
sources. They believe the party could secure up to 46 seats and be within a 
whisker of matching Fine Gael’s overall result.

“It would be madness to hand over the mantle of opposition to Sinn Fein, “ one 
Fianna Fail source said pointing to fresh successes for the party on Saturday 
night including their candidate Jim O’Callaghan who is on course to win a seat 
in Dublin Bay South.

Such an administration would probably last less than a year but would postpone 
the possibility of a second general election within a matter of weeks.

Overall the Fianna Fail performance has been a stunning reversal of fortunes 
for a party that had only 21 seats in the last Dail. Aside from the heavy Fine 
Gael losses, the resurrection of Fianna Fail from its worst ever showing in 
2011 is the story of this election.

Asked if he would be staying on as leader of his party at a time when many 
commentators suggest that the blame for its heavy defeat originates from his 
decision not to call an earlier election, Kenny replied:

No. I have a responsibility as Taoiseach and head of governemnt. While the 
results are coming in we still have a government and you are still in 
government unless you are voted out.

I have a responsibility as head of government to see what action needs to be 
taken to provide the country with a stable government in the future and I will 
considerer that very carefully over the next 36 hours.

Kenny: Re-forming current coalition not possible

Ben Quinn

Taoiseach Enda Kenny <https://www.theguardian.com/world/enda-kenny> has 
conceded that the option of re-forming Ireland’s coalition government of his 
party, Fine Gael, and the Irish Labour Party, is no longer available.

Speaking in the last 20 minutes from his own western constituency of Mayo, 
Kenny was evasive when repeatedly pressed on whether he would not consider 
entering into coalition with his party’s historic rival, Fianna Fail. 
Commentators increasingly believe that ‘Grand Coalition’ of the two is the only 
viable option now after a fractured election result.

“Clearly, my preference of Fine Gael and Labour cannot now be returned so 
obviously arising form that you have to look at all the counts …. to see what 
grouping and what parties are there,” he said in an interview with the Irish 
state broadcaster, RTE.

Sinn Fein now appears to be heading for its best-ever result in the Republic of
Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland>, with a solid third-place 
finish, although it’s a performance that’s not without its disappointments for 
the party.

In the five-seat north west constituency of Donegal, an ambitious strategy of 
seeking to have three members of the Dail (Parliament) elected appears to have 
failed. The party has been fending off suggestions that the strategy could now 
even backfire at the cost of one of its existing seats there.

Ireland’s Taoiseach and leader of the Fine Gael Party, Enda Kenny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/enda-kenny>, has been re-elected in his west 
coast Mayo constituency.

Kenny topped the poll with 13,318 votes, although it was down from the 17,472 
first preference votes he received in 2011, a drop of over 4,000.

However, he now faces major decisions. After presiding over heavy losses for 
his party (many believe that they would have been averted if he had called the 
election in November) there may be pressure on him to make way for another 
face..

There are hints that we may be hearing from him in the next hour, perhaps to 
coincide with Ireland’s main evening nine o’clock news bulletin.

A couple of different images of him arriving at the count earlier are around, 
including this one:

As well as Fianna Fail’s own recovery, Ireland’s Green Party has been staging 
a mini comeback.

After losing all its TDs in 2011, when it took a major hit as the junior 
partners in the government which was led by Fianna Fail, its deputy leader 
Catherine Martin has now been elected in the constituency of Dublin Rathdown.

Ireland’s health minister has strongly hinted that the best course of action 
for his party, Fine Gael, may now to go into opposition:

Leo Varadkar told RTE, the state broadcaster, that the coalition’s larger 
partner may not even end up as the largest party in the country. If so, that 
spot would likely be taken by Fianna Fail, which has undertaken an 
extraordinary comeback after five years in the political wilderness.

He said:

It’s going to be difficult to form a government. It’s not entirely clear if 
Fine Gael will emerge as the largest party in terms of seats.... I don’t 
necessarily think that the obligation to form a government falls on us.

Asked if Fine Gael should now be prepared to think the previously unthinkable 
– going into coalition with its historic rival, Fianna Fail – he replied:

What happens now is that we have to count the votes and see what the 
possibilities are.

Ireland’s governing coalition has suffered perhaps its biggest casualy of the 
day so far now, with the loss of the seat held by Fine Gael MP Alan Shatter, 
the former Justice Minister.

The Guardian’s Henry McDonald reports:

The Irish headline writers will no doubt be using the word SHATTERED when 
referring the loss of a Fine Gael seat in one of its most prosperous redoubts - 
Dublin Rathdown.

They will be referring of course to Alan Shatter, former Fine Gael Justice 
Minister for a time in the last government, who has lost his seat in the 
constituency.

If there was ever an iconic loss in this very bad election for Fine Gael it is 
the failure of Shatter to get re-elected to the Dail. He lost his seat to the 
Green Party which is heading back to the Dail having reduced to zero seats in 
the 2011 election.

The Irish Taoiseach’s closest adviser has said Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> would have to review its “political 
system” once the outcome of its most uncertain election in recent times is 
decided.

Admitting that the chance of another general election was “now very, very 
high,” Mark Mortell said:

The only word I can use right now is deep disappointment.

Asked about the prospect of an historic grand coalition between Fianna Fail 
and Fine Gael , he told the Press Association:

We’re each going to have to consider the situation and we’re going to have to 
talk to the Labour Party too.

What you’ve got here is an extraordinary situation. It is a massive fracturing 
of the political system.

It creates immediately a huge amount of volatility and if you look just across 
intoEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, and what’s happened 
in Spain and Portugal, this does mean we’re going to have a very, very 
interesting couple of weeks ahead of us and very, very demanding ones.

Philip Oltermann

Amid talk of an Irish “grand coalition” between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, 
here’s some insight into the practice in Germany, where such arrangements are 
nothing new. Philip Oltermann, the Guardian’s Berlin Bureay Chief, writes:

There have been three grosse Koalitionen between the conservative Christian 
Democrats and centre-left Social Democrats at national level: 1966-1999, 
2005-2009, and the current government, led by Angela Merkel, with the SPD 
leader Sigmar Gabriel as her deputy.

The problems with this kind of arrangement may be more apparent than the 
advantages: with a broad political consensus in the political centre, 
parliamentary debate is often stifled, opposition made toothless.

In Germany, this is particularly problematic for the left, which often has a 
mathematical majority of votes shared between the SPD, the Left Party and the 
Greens, but cannot make that majority count since the Social Democrats are 
hamstrung by their coalition treaty with the CDU.

The legalisation of gay marriage, effectively put on hold via the two parties’ 
coalition agreement, is just one area where a “grand coalition” can result in 
political stasis.

Yet at times of global turmoil grand coalitions can also be popular. After the 
2013 general election in Germany, a sizeable majority in the polls said a 
coalition between the SPD and the CDU was their favourable outcome, and until 
the refugee crisis knocked the government’s boat in the last few months, 
ratings for the two governing parties were remarkably stable.

• Ireland’s general election is on course to produce a hung parliament after 
voters punished the governing coalition after it implemented extensive 
austerity-led policies over the past five years in the wake of the country’s 
economic crash. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/27/ireland-election-likely-hung-parliament-talk-grand-coalition>
Fine Gael, the main party in the outgoing coalition, was set to lose up to 20 
seats as voters wreaked revenge on it and its junior partner, the Irish Labour 
Party.

• Taoiseach Enda Kenny has conceded that the option of re-forming Ireland’s 
coalition government of his party is no longer available.

Ruling out stepping down – at least in the immediate term – he said that he 
had a responsibility as the head of government and would be considering options 
over the next 36 hours for providing a stable government for the country.

• The prospect of a “grand coalition” between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael – the 
two ostensibly christian democratic parties which have taken turns to lead 
successive Irish governments since independence – appears to be on the cards. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/feb/27/ireland-general-election-exit-poll-coalition-fine-gael?page=with:block-56d1d2bbe4b0d38537b1f8b9#block-56d1d2bbe4b0d38537b1f8b9>
The leader of Fianna Fail, which surprised pundits by staging a recovery after 
voters punished it in 2011 after Ireland’s crash, said that his party would be 
“practical” and that it was essential to form a government that was “coherent”.

• Sinn Fein was on course to continue its march in the Republic of Ireland, 
with an expected increase in its representation in the parliament, the Dail, by 
around 50%. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/feb/27/ireland-general-election-exit-poll-coalition-fine-gael?page=with:block-56d19b33e4b074a9f6b35dce#block-56d19b33e4b074a9f6b35dce>
However, the party looked set to miss out on key targets it had set for itself 
in some constituencies due to the apparent reluctance of many voters to give 
their second preference votes to the party that was once umbilically linked to 
the IRA.

• The former Labour leader Eamon Gilmore has said that the heavy losses now 
being suffered by the party are a consequence of necessary but unpopular 
decisions which it had to make after going into coalition five years ago.

However, the results also suggested firm evidence of leftward turn on the part 
of record numbers of the electorate who were opting for a range of left of 
centre candidates.

At this stage we are going to wrap up our liveblog coverage. Thanks for 
reading. You’ll find updatedreports on our site 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> tonight, along with rolling 
coverage tomorrow and onwards of the complex negotiations to form a new 
government.
 
So, is Fianna Fail really about to get into bed with its historic rival, Fine 
Gael? The Guardian’sIreland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> 
correspondent, Henry McDonald, has some possible answers:


Fianna Fail is hostile to the idea of a ‘grand coalition’ with Fine Gael 
because they fear handing over the lead role in the opposition to Sinn Fein.

Party sources told The Guardian tonight that they would prefer to try and form 
a minority government working with a range non-party aligned independent 
deputies in the Dail.

Two leading figures re-elected on the Fianna Fail ticket, John McGuinness and 
Willie O’Dea, have already ruled out breaking the Irish Civil War divide and 
entering government with their old rival Fine Gael.

One possible alternative to that would be either try and cobble together a 
minority coalition or let Fine Gael try the same according to Fianna Fail 
sources. They believe the party could secure up to 46 seats and be within a 
whisker of matching Fine Gael’s overall result.

“It would be madness to hand over the mantle of opposition to Sinn Fein, “ one 
Fianna Fail source said pointing to fresh successes for the party on Saturday 
night including their candidate Jim O’Callaghan who is on course to win a seat 
in Dublin Bay South.

Such an administration would probably last less than a year but would postpone 
the possibility of a second general election within a matter of weeks.

Overall the Fianna Fail performance has been a stunning reversal of fortunes 
for a party that had only 21 seats in the last Dail. Aside from the heavy Fine 
Gael losses, the resurrection of Fianna Fail from its worst ever showing in 
2011 is the story of this election.
 
Asked if he would be staying on as leader of his party at a time when many 
commentators suggest that the blame for its heavy defeat originates from his 
decision not to call an earlier election, Kenny replied:

No. I have a responsibility as Taoiseach and head of governemnt. While the 
results are coming in we still have a government and you are still in 
government unless you are voted out.

I have a responsibility as head of government to see what action needs to be 
taken to provide the country with a stable government in the future and I will 
considerer that very carefully over the next 36 hours.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny <https://www.theguardian.com/world/enda-kenny> has 
conceded that the option of re-forming Ireland’s coalition government of his 
party, Fine Gael, and the Irish Labour Party, is no longer available.

Speaking in the last 20 minutes from his own western constituency of Mayo, 
Kenny was evasive when repeatedly pressed on whether he would not consider 
entering into coalition with his party’s historic rival, Fianna Fail. 
Commentators increasingly believe that ‘Grand Coalition’ of the two is the only 
viable option now after a fractured election result.

“Clearly, my preference of Fine Gael and Labour cannot now be returned so 
obviously arising form that you have to look at all the counts …. to see what 
grouping and what parties are there,” he said in an interview with the Irish 
state broadcaster, RTE.
 
Sinn Fein now appears to be heading for its best-ever result in the Republic of
Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland>, with a solid third-place 
finish, although it’s a performance that’s not without its disappointments for 
the party.

In the five-seat north west constituency of Donegal, an ambitious strategy of 
seeking to have three members of the Dail (Parliament) elected appears to have 
failed. The party has been fending off suggestions that the strategy could now 
even backfire at the cost of one of its existing seats there.
 
There’s intense pressure on Enda Kenny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/enda-kenny> to indicate his thoughts on a 
possible link-up now between his party, Fine Gael, and Fianna Fail.

This response, tweeted by UTV Ireland’s Yvonne Redmond, doesn’t exactly rule 
out such an outcome:

Ireland’s Taoiseach and leader of the Fine Gael Party, Enda Kenny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/enda-kenny>, has been re-elected in his west 
coast Mayo constituency.

Kenny topped the poll with 13,318 votes, although it was down from the 17,472 
first preference votes he received in 2011, a drop of over 4,000.

However, he now faces major decisions. After presiding over heavy losses for 
his party (many believe that they would have been averted if he had called the 
election in November) there may be pressure on him to make way for another 
face..

There are hints that we may be hearing from him in the next hour, perhaps to 
coincide with Ireland’s main evening nine o’clock news bulletin.

A couple of different images of him arriving at the count earlier are around, 
including this one:

As well as Fianna Fail’s own recovery, Ireland’s Green Party has been staging 
a mini comeback.

After losing all its TDs in 2011, when it took a major hit as the junior 
partners in the government which was led by Fianna Fail, its deputy leader 
Catherine Martin has now been elected in the constituency of Dublin Rathdown.

Ireland’s health minister has strongly hinted that the best course of action 
for his party, Fine Gael, may now to go into opposition:

Leo Varadkar told RTE, the state broadcaster, that the coalition’s larger 
partner may not even end up as the largest party in the country. If so, that 
spot would likely be taken by Fianna Fail, which has undertaken an 
extraordinary comeback after five years in the political wilderness.

He said:

It’s going to be difficult to form a government. It’s not entirely clear if 
Fine Gael will emerge as the largest party in terms of seats.... I don’t 
necessarily think that the obligation to form a government falls on us.

Asked if Fine Gael should now be prepared to think the previously unthinkable 
– going into coalition with its historic rival, Fianna Fail – he replied:

What happens now is that we have to count the votes and see what the 
possibilities are.

Ireland’s governing coalition has suffered perhaps its biggest casualy of the 
day so far now, with the loss of the seat held by Fine Gael MP Alan Shatter, 
the former Justice Minister.

The Guardian’s Henry McDonald reports:

The Irish headline writers will no doubt be using the word SHATTERED when 
referring the loss of a Fine Gael seat in one of its most prosperous redoubts - 
Dublin Rathdown.

They will be referring of course to Alan Shatter, former Fine Gael Justice 
Minister for a time in the last government, who has lost his seat in the 
constituency.

If there was ever an iconic loss in this very bad election for Fine Gael it is 
the failure of Shatter to get re-elected to the Dail. He lost his seat to the 
Green Party which is heading back to the Dail having reduced to zero seats in 
the 2011 election.
 
The Irish Taoiseach’s closest adviser has said Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> would have to review its “political 
system” once the outcome of its most uncertain election in recent times is 
decided.

Admitting that the chance of another general election was “now very, very 
high,” Mark Mortell said:

The only word I can use right now is deep disappointment.

Asked about the prospect of an historic grand coalition between Fianna Fail 
and Fine Gael , he told the Press Association:

We’re each going to have to consider the situation and we’re going to have to 
talk to the Labour Party too.

What you’ve got here is an extraordinary situation. It is a massive fracturing 
of the political system.

It creates immediately a huge amount of volatility and if you look just across 
intoEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, and what’s happened 
in Spain and Portugal, this does mean we’re going to have a very, very 
interesting couple of weeks ahead of us and very, very demanding ones.
 
Amid talk of an Irish “grand coalition” between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, 
here’s some insight into the practice in Germany, where such arrangements are 
nothing new. Philip Oltermann, the Guardian’s Berlin Bureay Chief, writes:

There have been three grosse Koalitionen between the conservative Christian 
Democrats and centre-left Social Democrats at national level: 1966-1999, 
2005-2009, and the current government, led by Angela Merkel, with the SPD 
leader Sigmar Gabriel as her deputy.

The problems with this kind of arrangement may be more apparent than the 
advantages: with a broad political consensus in the political centre, 
parliamentary debate is often stifled, opposition made toothless.

In Germany, this is particularly problematic for the left, which often has a 
mathematical majority of votes shared between the SPD, the Left Party and the 
Greens, but cannot make that majority count since the Social Democrats are 
hamstrung by their coalition treaty with the CDU.

The legalisation of gay marriage, effectively put on hold via the two parties’ 
coalition agreement, is just one area where a “grand coalition” can result in 
political stasis.

Yet at times of global turmoil grand coalitions can also be popular. After the 
2013 general election in Germany, a sizeable majority in the polls said a 
coalition between the SPD and the CDU was their favourable outcome, and until 
the refugee crisis knocked the government’s boat in the last few months, 
ratings for the two governing parties were remarkably stable.
