Tell me about it. Lace up your hiking boots and get stomping through the South 
Downs national park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/aug/23/south-downs-national-park-rangers-guide>
. A new walking festival launches on 27 September (sussexwalkingfestival.org.uk 
<http://sussexwalkingfestival.org.uk/>), with 50 events over two weekends … 
Nordic walking, anyone? The park was declared a Unesco biosphere reserve in 
June (which must mean it’s pretty special) and is rich in ancient woodland and 
rolling farmland – perfect for an early autumn walk.

Sounds like I’ll need a drink. Handily, one of the walks is a breweries tour 
<http://sussexwalkingfestival.org.uk/walks/two-breweries-tour>: sup the wares 
of Long Man Brewery near Eastbourne and stop at thePlough and Harrow at 
Litlington <http://www.ploughandharrowlitlington.co.uk/>. The whole area is a 
pub-lover’s dream: try the 200-year-oldCricketers Arms 
<http://www.cricketersberwick.co.uk/> near Berwick or the Snowdrop Inn 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Snowdrop-Inn/257635217181> in Lewes, with 
its huge range of craft beers.

And a bite to eat? Tuck into a burger or locally farmed rib-eye steak at the 
Pelham Arms <http://www.thepelhamarms.co.uk/> in Lewes, or enjoy stately 
grandeur, fine food and reasonable prices atStanmer House 
<http://www.stanmerhouse.co.uk/>, a Grade-I-listed mansion near Brighton.

Anywhere to stay for under £100? Twytten House <http://www.twyttenhouse.co.uk/>
 is a rather special B&B in Wilmington, which just sneaks in with three doubles 
at £100: one self-contained in the walled garden and the French owner cooks up 
a never-ending breakfast a night. TheGriffin Inn 
<http://www.thegriffininn.co.uk/> in historic Fletching is a good bet (rooms 
from £70), with tasty fodder for tired walkers.

Anything else I should know? Vines love Sussex’s chalky soil, and several 
vineyards are open to visitors, such as the newRathfinny 
<http://www.rathfinnyestate.com/> estate near Alfriston.

Do I need a car? Train’s your best bet. Southern Rail 
<http://www.southernrailway.com/> runs from London to Brighton, Eastbourne, 
Chichester and Lewes – and the buses are good.• See southdowns.gov.uk
