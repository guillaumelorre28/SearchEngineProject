Why go now? 
This historic market town does the festive season well, particularly on the 
second Sunday in December, when it holds its Festival of Christmas (11 December,
beverleyfestivalofchristmas.co.uk 
<http://www.beverleyfestivalofchristmas.co.uk/>), now in its 21st year. Its 
Victorian market has 120 handicraft, gift and food stalls, stall-holders dress 
in period costume, and there are rides and entertainment in streets decked with 
holly and fairy lights.

What else is there to do?
Beverley’s minster was the inspiration for Westminster Abbey, but locals 
prefer St Mary’s church: founded in 1120, it has beautifully carved and painted 
figures, including a rabbit dressed as a pilgrim, said to have inspired the 
white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland. A fun way to see the rest of the town, 
with its medieval gate and two marketplaces, is by following the Elwell Trail, 
22 paintings of local life by artists Fred and Mary Elwell (
nosivad.co.uk/painting-the-town <http://nosivad.co.uk/painting-the-town>). The 
bracing Westwood pastures offer good walking.
 The Potting Shed 
Anywhere good to eat?
Run by brother and sister twins in a former court building, the Westwood 
<https://www.thewestwood.co.uk/> restaurant does a generous two-course lunch 
for £19.95. The less formalPotting Shed pub <http://www.pottingshedbar.com/>, 
new this summer, is rather barn-like but the pizzas and burgers are top-notch.
 The new bar at the King’s Head 
How about a drink?
Loads of choice. Most famous is the dark, rambling White Horse, known far and 
wide asNellie’s <http://www.nellies.co.uk/>, with benches probably as old as 
its gas lights. Real ale lovers rate theChequers Micropub 
<https://www.facebook.com/pg/ChequersMicropub/about/?ref=page_internal>, and 
the revampedKing’s Head <http://kingsheadpubbeverley.com/> has added a great 
cocktail station.

Anywhere to stay under £100 a night?
Cute spots like Number One Beverley <https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/2312028> 
and theGame Bird <http://www.gamebirdbeverley.co.uk/bedandbreakfast> pub are 
sold out for the festival. TheTudor Rose 
<http://www.thetudorrosehotelbeverley.co.uk/> (doubles from £85) is friendly, 
if in need of an update, and close to all the action.
