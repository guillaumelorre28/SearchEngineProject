I agree wholeheartedly with Gary Younge (Racism is a system of oppression, not 
a series of bloopers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/04/racism-gerry-adams-n-word-fetishise-bloopers-cumberbatch>
, 4 May) about the way minor indiscretions are magnified out of all proportion. 
Down the years we have faced some real racists:Mosley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/oswald-mosley>, the National Front, the BNP and 
other fringe groups and elements within the Conservative party and Ukip. Many 
of us have supported organisations to defeat them: the Anti-Nazi League,Rock 
Against Racism <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race> 
and Hope Not Hate. Yes, correct people when they say something that appears 
racist, but reserve our real opposition for more serious opponents.

• Gary Younge may have inadvertently underwritten the credibility of apologies 
“for any offence caused” (as offered by Gerry Adams). There is a hidden 
ambiguity in the use of the word “any”, which implies that in the opinion of 
the speaker people were not justified in taking offence. Even in an era of 
professional offence-takers, the better phrase is: “I apologise to anyone 
I have offended.”
