It may be, as John Barstow says (Britain and Ireland face border bother 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/brexit-will-force-britain-and-ireland-to-consider-border-controls>
, Letters, 17 October), that there is a “prima facie case for a rail tunnel 
between Larne and Stranraer”, but it is almost certainly never going to be 
built. As a result of an inexplicable clause in the 1845 Gauge Act, the 
railways in Britain run on a 4’8.5” gauge, those in Ireland, both north and 
south, on a 5’3” gauge. Given that the economic case could be made, provision 
of gauge change equipment – as between France and Spain – may be a possibility; 
but delays necessitated by such conversion would restrict the usefulness of the 
tunnel and be a hindrance to achieving a viable return on the huge investment 
such a tunnel would demand.
