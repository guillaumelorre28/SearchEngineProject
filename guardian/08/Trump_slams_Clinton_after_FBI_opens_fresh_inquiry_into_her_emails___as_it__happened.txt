“We’re a divided nation but we are fighting to bring us all together, like 
here tonight. There’s love here. There’s love,” Trump says.

“We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We 
will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. God bless 
you.”

With that Trump closes out his rally.

“We have the highest murder in this country in 45 years,” Trump says, very 
falsely.

Trump is distorting an FBI statistic 
<https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2015-crime-statistics>
 into a false claim: in September the agency reported that murders and 
non-negligent manslaughter rose in the US by 10.8% in 2015, the largest 
single-year increase since 1971. That is not the same as saying there are more 
murders in the US than at any point since 1971: 15,696 murders were reported in 
2015, down from 1991 and 1993 highs of 24,703 and 24,526. There were more 
murders in 1971 (17,780) than in 2015.

The murder rate declined 42% from 1993 to 2014, even though the population 
increased by a quarter.

During this week’s debate Trump almost cited the statistic accurately, saying: 
“We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.” The 
FBI figure is a national one, not restricted to cities.

“You don’t hear that from these people,” he adds, gesturing toward the press. 
“They don’t want to talk about it.”

You can read our report on it, from the day of the release and before Trump 
remarked on it, through the link below.

“When I am elected president I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists out 
of this country,” Trump says, without details.

“And yes, we will build the wall. And yes, Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%. 
100%.”

“The cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what we’re talking about,” Trump 
says. Nonpartisan analysts estimate the wall would costat least $25bn 
<http://www.newsweek.com/trump-wall-impractical-impolitic-impossible-459802>. 
The US goods trade deficit with Mexico is about $58bn 
<https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/mexico>, which is offset by the US 
surplus in services of $9.2bn.

“If not for the open border policies of this administration,” Trump says, 
“countless Americans would be alive today.”

The US does not have “open borders”, and Barack Obama has deported more than 
2.5 million people, a record – as Trump himself noted at hte final presidential 
debate.

“Hillary has pledged open borders,” Trump says, “and supports sanctuary 
cities.”

Clinton does not support open borders but does support sanctuary cities and 
reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay 
in the US, and she supports Obama’s executive actions to shield some migrants, 
such as people who were brought to the US as children. Like Obama, she supports 
deportation for people with criminal records.


“We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.”

This is only true if you’re in the wealthiest bracket of American earners. 
Half of Trump’s tax cuts would go to the top 1% of earners, according to the 
Tax Policy Center, and most families below the top 20% of earners would have 
income gains of less than 1%.

Trump doesn’t linger long on the Affordable Care Act though. He leads the 
crowd in a chant of “drain the swamp”, his new catchphrase for taking on 
corruption in Washington.

“Forty-five percent of African American children under the age of six” are in 
poverty, Trump says inaccurately, citing outdated data.

Per Politifact 
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-half-young-black-children-are-ab/>
:

The poverty rates in question were as high as Trump says they were at the 
depths of the Great Recession, but they have since eased, to somewhere between 
20 percent and 37 percent, depending on which income threshold you use. Still, 
the rates for African-American children are disproportionately high, so Trump 
has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of 
poverty in that age group. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.

“Another two million Hispanic Americans have fallen into poverty under the 
Obama administration,” he says, also falsely.

Per the Guardian’s own fact check:

Trump’s use of “two million” is misleading on two points: he starts counting 
from 2008, when George W Bush was still in office – and from right before the 
financial crisis’ peak – and he ignores that the Hispanic population has grown 
dramatically in the eight years since then. Almost 1.4 million Hispanic people 
fell below the poverty line between 2008 and 2009, Censuspoverty numbers show 
<https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.pdf>
, but the number of Hispanic people in poverty has decreased during the 
recovery. In 2015 it fell to 21.4%, down from 25.2% in 2009.


“It will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your heirs,” he 
says, alluding to the so-called “death tax” on inheritance, though the estate 
tax actually only affects wealthy families and not the majority of Americans.

Trump then moves on to saying that he’s “really moving” in the polls, and that 
he’s leading in many of them. This is not true, aselection models

show.

“I don’t know what’s going to happen now,” Trump continues. “So much is at 
stake in this election.”

When we win in November we are going to have honest government once again. 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> destroyed

Clintons’ charitable foundation.

Trump moves on to reminiscing about how, last June, he came down an elevator 
with his wife to announce his presidential campaign. He abruptly segues into 
saying how “we’re going to be the smart country once again,” and saying “we 
never win anymore” abroad.

He correctly says that the White House has admitted healthcare premiums will 
increase by as much as 25% next year, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/03/obamacare-marketplaces-exchanges-insurers-subscribers-competition>
 but then misleadingly says that the true number is twice that. Premiums will 
increase by varying amounts according to each state: some will be quite high, 
as Trump warns, others will be far lower.

Trump then correctly notes that Obama misled Americans  
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/>
about whether they could keep their doctor under the Affordable Care Act.

“Repealing and replacing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons 
we must win on November 8,” Trump says.

Trump addresses FBI inquiry

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> appears on 
stage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He thanks everybody.

“As you’ve heard, earlier today, the FBI after discovering new emails” – the 
crowd cheers – “is reopening their investigation intoHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>.”

This is not technically correct. Comey said the emails are part of a new 
review “pertaining to” the prior investigation.

“Lock her up,” the crowd chants.

“The investigation is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it’s 
everybody’s hope that justice at last can be delivered. In the very brief 
remarks tonight Hillary Clinton tonight tried to politicize this 
investigation,” Trump continues, “by attacking and falsely accusing the FBI 
director of only sending the letter to Republicans.

“Another Clinton lie. As it turns out it was sent to both Republican and 
Democratic leaders.”

Trump says that the FBI “would never have reopened this case at this time 
unless it were a most egregious criminal offense”.

“I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. 
Justice will prevail.”

Trump has suggested for months that the FBI has acted politically 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/25/politics/reality-check-hillary-clinton-fbi-investigation/>
 to hide alleged corruption.

Someone is back at the podium after more than 45 minutes of waiting. It’s not 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, but he praises 
the candidate, who is reportedly en route.

“He’s put his finger on a deeply underappreciated body of people,” the man at 
the podium says. “He is going to be the next president of the United States of 
America.”

Then the man leaves the stage. “Let’s get the next president up here.”

As of 6.45pm PT, Trump has an 18.5% chance of winning the election and Hillary 
Clinton has a 81.5% chance, accordingto FiveThirtyEight’s election model 
<http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/>.

Trump is now an hour and 15 minutes late to his own rally, but reporting 
continues to trickle out from Washington on FBI director James Comey’s decision 
to announce a review into emails of unknown significance.

Officials speaking on condition of anonymity have told the Washington Post 
that he sent a cryptic letter today because of politics within the agency and 
with Congress.

FBI Director James B. Comey decided to inform Congress that he would look 
again into Hillary Clinton’s handling of emails during her time as secretary of 
state for two main reasons — a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern 
that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise 
questions of a coverup.

The rationale, described by officials close to Comey’s decision-making on the 
condition of anonymity, prompted the FBI director to release his brief letter 
to Congress on Friday and upset a presidential race less than two weeks before 
Election Day. It placed Comey again at the center of a highly partisan argument 
over whether the nation’s top law enforcement agency was unfairly influencing 
the campaign.

In a memo explaining his decision to FBI employees soon after he sent his 
letter to Congress, Comey said he felt “an obligation to do so given that I 
testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.”

“Of course, we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, 
but here I feel I also think it would be misleading to the American people were 
we not to supplement the record,” Comey wrote to his employees.
Greg Sargent (@ThePlumLineGS) 
Important new reporting from @SariHorwitz <https://twitter.com/SariHorwitz> 
suggests Comey sent letter because he felt pressure from inside:

Blum talks about John Boehner, the former speaker of the House. Blum brags 
that he voted against Boehner, a veteran Republican leader, for that position.

“I reminded Mr Boehner, in his palatial office, that I do not report to you,” 
Blum says. “I report to the good people of the first district of Iowa!”

The office of the speaker belongs to whomever wins the title. Republican Paul 
Ryan, a close ally of Boehner’s before the former speaker’s retirement, 
currently works there. Blumenthusiastically endorsed

 Ryan, a nine-term representative from Wisconsin.

“My friends, deplorables, the time is now. The time is now or never. The time 
is November 8 or never,” Blum says, before moving on to abysmal monsters. “We 
are staring into the abyss. I’ve been in the belly of the beast for two years. 
We are staring into the abyss.

“I need your help. Will you help me?”

He says he needs the audience to “tell them about Blum”. He begins talking 
about how his father fought in the second world war with a 10th-grade 
education. Trump is nearly an hour late.

A mustachioed man named Jeff addresses the crowd before Trump, who is 
approximately 40 minutes late to the Cedar Rapids rally.

The man is shouting, and praising various Republican candidates. He says that 
voters are going to terrify Democrats. “Make them shiver and shake, cause 
there’s a change a-coming, and I can feel it in the air!”

“What Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
did with those emails, I know it’s politically advantageous, but you know what 
folks, we had a secretary of state put our national security, that’s your 
children, that’s your grandchildren at stake. Folks, I’m a history professor, 
I’m going to tell you right now the history of our country, the history of our 
country, we don’t have a precedent for what’s going on.”

Jeff doesn’t actually say anything about FBI agents’ July conclusions that 
Clinton was “extremely careless”, or that they found no evidence that her 
server had been hacked, though they thought it at risk.

Goetz returns. “I’m glad Jeff got that out of his system.”

A congressman, Rod Blum, appears on stage. “Hello-o-o-o, deplorables!” He says 
he represents Iowans in Washington DC, which he then says is “infested” and “a 
swamp”.

“We are fed up with the lying, we are fed up with the corruption, we are fed 
up with people who go there to serve themselves,” he says.

Still waiting for Donald Trump, Tana Goetz, a former Apprentice contestant, 
comes out onto the stage to pep up the crowd by dismissingHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> “just across the river”.

Then someone holds a moment of prayer for Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and Mike Pence. Then Goetz 
introduces a man to lead the crowd in the pledge of allegiance.

A Cedar Rapids music teacher takes the lead for the national anthem. Goetz 
says that Trump “took a chance on me, a woman, an Iowan, and an entrepreneur”.

“What he showed me was enough to put my successful careers on hold,” she says, 
to campaign for Trump. He’s got a huge heart, she says. “I know this man’s 
heart and it is good. And he genuinely loves people. You can’t live in New York 
City and not love people.”

This last statement is not true.

But Goetz goes on to say that she knows “how much this man loves this 
country”. “He doesn’t need this job.”

“Donald Trump’s gonna win this thing in a landslide. And it’s gonna happen. I 
predicted it and it’s gonna happen.”

She then says the FBI “is re-opening the case”, alluding to the new review 
into a new batch of emails related to Hillary Clinton, and the crowd chants 
“lock her up”.

As we wait for Trump to speak in Iowa, the state has reported its third 
<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2016/10/27/3-suspected-voter-fraud-polk-county/92826426/>
 suspected case of attempted voter fraud in a Donald Trump supporter, according 
to theDes Moines Register. 
<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2016/10/28/voter-fraud-suspect-arrested-des-moines/92892042/>

Terri Lynn Rote, 55, was booked into the Polk County Jail about 3.40pm 
Thursday on a first-degree election misconduct charge, which is a Class D 
felony.

Rote, a registered Republican, reportedly cast an early voting ballot at the 
Polk County Election Office, 120 Second Ave, and another ballot at a county 
satellite voting location in Des Moines, according to a Des Moines police 
report.

It’s the first time in 12 years that Polk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald can 
remember ever having to report potential voter fraud, he said Thursday morning.

The other two suspects are accused of casting mail-in ballots and also voting 
in person, according to police reports. As of Friday morning, neither of those 
suspects had been arrested.

The case is under investigation by Des Moines police.

“I think it shows that our voting system works in Iowa, that we’re able to 
catch it,” Fitzgerald said.

“Tensions are running high on both sides” as election day approaches, the 
county auditor said, but the cases of double voting could also have been simple 
mistakes. “That’s not for me to decide,” he said.

Rote was held in jail on a $5,000 bond, but she had been released as of Friday 
afternoon. Her next court appearance was scheduled for Nov. 7, court records 
show.

Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that voter fraud is rampant 
throughout the electorate, and especially in largely black precincts of 
Philadelphia and Chicago.It is not 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/donald-trump-fact-check-rigged-election-voter>
.

The businessman has also suggested that he would not mind voter fraud 
perpetrated in his favor, saying at a rally last week, “Well, if they’re gonna 
vote for me, we’ll think about it, right?”

Donald Trump is due to speak at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, at 5pm local 
time, just under a two hour drive from Des Moines, whereHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> just held her press 
conference.

 Clinton is on her way back to her New York headquarters, though, while Trump 
will carry on to Golden, Colorado, and Phoenix, Arizona, for campaign stops on 
Saturday. The former secretary of state will make her own stop in the latter 
state, which was not long ago thought to be securely Republican, on Wednesday.

“We’re a divided nation but we are fighting to bring us all together, like 
here tonight. There’s love here. There’s love,” Trump says.

“We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We 
will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. God bless 
you.”

With that Trump closes out his rally.
 
“We have the highest murder in this country in 45 years,” Trump says, very 
falsely.

Trump is distorting an FBI statistic 
<https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2015-crime-statistics>
 into a false claim: in September the agency reported that murders and 
non-negligent manslaughter rose in the US by 10.8% in 2015, the largest 
single-year increase since 1971. That is not the same as saying there are more 
murders in the US than at any point since 1971: 15,696 murders were reported in 
2015, down from 1991 and 1993 highs of 24,703 and 24,526. There were more 
murders in 1971 (17,780) than in 2015.

The murder rate declined 42% from 1993 to 2014, even though the population 
increased by a quarter.

During this week’s debate Trump almost cited the statistic accurately, saying: 
“We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.” The 
FBI figure is a national one, not restricted to cities.

“You don’t hear that from these people,” he adds, gesturing toward the press. 
“They don’t want to talk about it.”

You can read our report on it, from the day of the release and before Trump 
remarked on it, through the link below.

“When I am elected president I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists out 
of this country,” Trump says, without details.

“And yes, we will build the wall. And yes, Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%. 
100%.”

“The cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what we’re talking about,” Trump 
says. Nonpartisan analysts estimate the wall would costat least $25bn 
<http://www.newsweek.com/trump-wall-impractical-impolitic-impossible-459802>. 
The US goods trade deficit with Mexico is about $58bn 
<https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/mexico>, which is offset by the US 
surplus in services of $9.2bn.

“If not for the open border policies of this administration,” Trump says, 
“countless Americans would be alive today.”

The US does not have “open borders”, and Barack Obama has deported more than 
2.5 million people, a record – as Trump himself noted at hte final presidential 
debate.

“Hillary has pledged open borders,” Trump says, “and supports sanctuary 
cities.”

Clinton does not support open borders but does support sanctuary cities and 
reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay 
in the US, and she supports Obama’s executive actions to shield some migrants, 
such as people who were brought to the US as children. Like Obama, she supports 
deportation for people with criminal records.


“We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.”

This is only true if you’re in the wealthiest bracket of American earners. 
Half of Trump’s tax cuts would go to the top 1% of earners, according to the 
Tax Policy Center, and most families below the top 20% of earners would have 
income gains of less than 1%.
 
Trump doesn’t linger long on the Affordable Care Act though. He leads the 
crowd in a chant of “drain the swamp”, his new catchphrase for taking on 
corruption in Washington.

“Forty-five percent of African American children under the age of six” are in 
poverty, Trump says inaccurately, citing outdated data.

Per Politifact 
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-half-young-black-children-are-ab/>
:

The poverty rates in question were as high as Trump says they were at the 
depths of the Great Recession, but they have since eased, to somewhere between 
20 percent and 37 percent, depending on which income threshold you use. Still, 
the rates for African-American children are disproportionately high, so Trump 
has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of 
poverty in that age group. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.

“Another two million Hispanic Americans have fallen into poverty under the 
Obama administration,” he says, also falsely.

Per the Guardian’s own fact check:

Trump’s use of “two million” is misleading on two points: he starts counting 
from 2008, when George W Bush was still in office – and from right before the 
financial crisis’ peak – and he ignores that the Hispanic population has grown 
dramatically in the eight years since then. Almost 1.4 million Hispanic people 
fell below the poverty line between 2008 and 2009, Censuspoverty numbers show 
<https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.pdf>
, but the number of Hispanic people in poverty has decreased during the 
recovery. In 2015 it fell to 21.4%, down from 25.2% in 2009.


“It will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your heirs,” he 
says, alluding to the so-called “death tax” on inheritance, though the estate 
tax actually only affects wealthy families and not the majority of Americans.
 
Trump then moves on to saying that he’s “really moving” in the polls, and that 
he’s leading in many of them. This is not true, aselection models 
<http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/> and poll averages 
 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html>
show.

“I don’t know what’s going to happen now,” Trump continues. “So much is at 
stake in this election.”

When we win in November we are going to have honest government once again. 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> destroyed 
33,000 emails. Destroyed 13 iPhones.”

He then says, without evidence, that Clinton “put her office up for sale” to 
corporations and foreign donors. Hacked emails showconcerns within the campaign 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/us/politics/bill-hillary-clinton-foundation-wikileaks.html>
 that Clinton’s husband, Bill, was too close with various donors, but no one 
has found evidence of a favor returned in exchange for donations to the 
Clintons’ charitable foundation.

Trump moves on to reminiscing about how, last June, he came down an elevator 
with his wife to announce his presidential campaign. He abruptly segues into 
saying how “we’re going to be the smart country once again,” and saying “we 
never win anymore” abroad.

He correctly says that the White House has admitted healthcare premiums will 
increase by as much as 25% next year, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/03/obamacare-marketplaces-exchanges-insurers-subscribers-competition>
 but then misleadingly says that the true number is twice that. Premiums will 
increase by varying amounts according to each state: some will be quite high, 
as Trump warns, others will be far lower.

Trump then correctly notes that Obama misled Americans  
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/>
about whether they could keep their doctor under the Affordable Care Act.

“Repealing and replacing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons 
we must win on November 8,” Trump says.
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> appears on 
stage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He thanks everybody.

“As you’ve heard, earlier today, the FBI after discovering new emails” – the 
crowd cheers – “is reopening their investigation intoHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>.”

This is not technically correct. Comey said the emails are part of a new 
review “pertaining to” the prior investigation.

“Lock her up,” the crowd chants.

“The investigation is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it’s 
everybody’s hope that justice at last can be delivered. In the very brief 
remarks tonight Hillary Clinton tonight tried to politicize this 
investigation,” Trump continues, “by attacking and falsely accusing the FBI 
director of only sending the letter to Republicans.

“Another Clinton lie. As it turns out it was sent to both Republican and 
Democratic leaders.”

Trump says that the FBI “would never have reopened this case at this time 
unless it were a most egregious criminal offense”.

“I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. 
Justice will prevail.”

Trump has suggested for months that the FBI has acted politically 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/25/politics/reality-check-hillary-clinton-fbi-investigation/>
 to hide alleged corruption.
 
Someone is back at the podium after more than 45 minutes of waiting. It’s not 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, but he praises 
the candidate, who is reportedly en route.

“He’s put his finger on a deeply underappreciated body of people,” the man at 
the podium says. “He is going to be the next president of the United States of 
America.”

Then the man leaves the stage. “Let’s get the next president up here.”

As of 6.45pm PT, Trump has an 18.5% chance of winning the election and Hillary 
Clinton has a 81.5% chance, accordingto FiveThirtyEight’s election model 
<http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/>.

Trump is now an hour and 15 minutes late to his own rally, but reporting 
continues to trickle out from Washington on FBI director James Comey’s decision 
to announce a review into emails of unknown significance.

Officials speaking on condition of anonymity have told the Washington Post 
that he sent a cryptic letter today because of politics within the agency and 
with Congress.

FBI Director James B. Comey decided to inform Congress that he would look 
again into Hillary Clinton’s handling of emails during her time as secretary of 
state for two main reasons — a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern 
that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise 
questions of a coverup.

The rationale, described by officials close to Comey’s decision-making on the 
condition of anonymity, prompted the FBI director to release his brief letter 
to Congress on Friday and upset a presidential race less than two weeks before 
Election Day. It placed Comey again at the center of a highly partisan argument 
over whether the nation’s top law enforcement agency was unfairly influencing 
the campaign.

In a memo explaining his decision to FBI employees soon after he sent his 
letter to Congress, Comey said he felt “an obligation to do so given that I 
testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.”

“Of course, we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, 
but here I feel I also think it would be misleading to the American people were 
we not to supplement the record,” Comey wrote to his employees.

Blum talks about John Boehner, the former speaker of the House. Blum brags 
that he voted against Boehner, a veteran Republican leader, for that position.

“I reminded Mr Boehner, in his palatial office, that I do not report to you,” 
Blum says. “I report to the good people of the first district of Iowa!”

The office of the speaker belongs to whomever wins the title. Republican Paul 
Ryan, a close ally of Boehner’s before the former speaker’s retirement, 
currently works there. Blumenthusiastically endorsed 
<https://blum.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-blum-releases-statement-house-speaker-election>
 Ryan, a nine-term representative from Wisconsin.

“My friends, deplorables, the time is now. The time is now or never. The time 
is November 8 or never,” Blum says, before moving on to abysmal monsters. “We 
are staring into the abyss. I’ve been in the belly of the beast for two years. 
We are staring into the abyss.

“I need your help. Will you help me?”

He says he needs the audience to “tell them about Blum”. He begins talking 
about how his father fought in the second world war with a 10th-grade 
education. Trump is nearly an hour late.
 
A mustachioed man named Jeff addresses the crowd before Trump, who is 
approximately 40 minutes late to the Cedar Rapids rally.

The man is shouting, and praising various Republican candidates. He says that 
voters are going to terrify Democrats. “Make them shiver and shake, cause 
there’s a change a-coming, and I can feel it in the air!”

“What Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
did with those emails, I know it’s politically advantageous, but you know what 
folks, we had a secretary of state put our national security, that’s your 
children, that’s your grandchildren at stake. Folks, I’m a history professor, 
I’m going to tell you right now the history of our country, the history of our 
country, we don’t have a precedent for what’s going on.”

Jeff doesn’t actually say anything about FBI agents’ July conclusions that 
Clinton was “extremely careless”, or that they found no evidence that her 
server had been hacked, though they thought it at risk.

Goetz returns. “I’m glad Jeff got that out of his system.”

A congressman, Rod Blum, appears on stage. “Hello-o-o-o, deplorables!” He says 
he represents Iowans in Washington DC, which he then says is “infested” and “a 
swamp”.

“We are fed up with the lying, we are fed up with the corruption, we are fed 
up with people who go there to serve themselves,” he says.
 
Still waiting for Donald Trump, Tana Goetz, a former Apprentice contestant, 
comes out onto the stage to pep up the crowd by dismissingHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> “just across the river”.

Then someone holds a moment of prayer for Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and Mike Pence. Then Goetz 
introduces a man to lead the crowd in the pledge of allegiance.

A Cedar Rapids music teacher takes the lead for the national anthem. Goetz 
says that Trump “took a chance on me, a woman, an Iowan, and an entrepreneur”.

“What he showed me was enough to put my successful careers on hold,” she says, 
to campaign for Trump. He’s got a huge heart, she says. “I know this man’s 
heart and it is good. And he genuinely loves people. You can’t live in New York 
City and not love people.”

This last statement is not true.

But Goetz goes on to say that she knows “how much this man loves this 
country”. “He doesn’t need this job.”

“Donald Trump’s gonna win this thing in a landslide. And it’s gonna happen. I 
predicted it and it’s gonna happen.”

She then says the FBI “is re-opening the case”, alluding to the new review 
into a new batch of emails related to Hillary Clinton, and the crowd chants 
“lock her up”.
 
As we wait for Trump to speak in Iowa, the state has reported its third 
<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2016/10/27/3-suspected-voter-fraud-polk-county/92826426/>
 suspected case of attempted voter fraud in a Donald Trump supporter, according 
to theDes Moines Register. 
<http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2016/10/28/voter-fraud-suspect-arrested-des-moines/92892042/>

Terri Lynn Rote, 55, was booked into the Polk County Jail about 3.40pm 
Thursday on a first-degree election misconduct charge, which is a Class D 
felony.

Rote, a registered Republican, reportedly cast an early voting ballot at the 
Polk County Election Office, 120 Second Ave, and another ballot at a county 
satellite voting location in Des Moines, according to a Des Moines police 
report.

It’s the first time in 12 years that Polk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald can 
remember ever having to report potential voter fraud, he said Thursday morning.

The other two suspects are accused of casting mail-in ballots and also voting 
in person, according to police reports. As of Friday morning, neither of those 
suspects had been arrested.

The case is under investigation by Des Moines police.

“I think it shows that our voting system works in Iowa, that we’re able to 
catch it,” Fitzgerald said.

“Tensions are running high on both sides” as election day approaches, the 
county auditor said, but the cases of double voting could also have been simple 
mistakes. “That’s not for me to decide,” he said.

Rote was held in jail on a $5,000 bond, but she had been released as of Friday 
afternoon. Her next court appearance was scheduled for Nov. 7, court records 
show.

Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that voter fraud is rampant 
throughout the electorate, and especially in largely black precincts of 
Philadelphia and Chicago.It is not 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/donald-trump-fact-check-rigged-election-voter>
.

The businessman has also suggested that he would not mind voter fraud 
perpetrated in his favor, saying at a rally last week, “Well, if they’re gonna 
vote for me, we’ll think about it, right?”

Donald Trump is due to speak at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, at 5pm local 
time, just under a two hour drive from Des Moines, whereHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> just held her press 
conference.

 Clinton is on her way back to her New York headquarters, though, while Trump 
will carry on to Golden, Colorado, and Phoenix, Arizona, for campaign stops on 
Saturday. The former secretary of state will make her own stop in the latter 
state, which was not long ago thought to be securely Republican, on Wednesday.
