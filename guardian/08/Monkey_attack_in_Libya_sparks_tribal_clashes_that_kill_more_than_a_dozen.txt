 The animal pulled off one of the girls’ headscarves, prompting men from the 
Awlad Suleiman tribe to retaliate by killing three people from the Gaddadfa 
tribe as well as the monkey, according to a resident who spoke to Reuters.

 City officials could not be reached to confirm the accounts.

 “There was an escalation on the second and third days with the use of tanks, 
mortars and other heavy weapons,” the resident said. .

 “There are still sporadic clashes and life is completely shut down in the 
areas where there has been fighting.“

 Like other parts of Libya, Sabha has been periodically plagued by conflict 
since the uprising thattoppled Muammar Gaddafi five years ago

 splintered the country into warring factions.

 In the Sabha region, a hub for migrant and arms smuggling in Libya’s often 
neglected south, militia abuses and the deterioration of living conditions have 
been especially acute.

 The Gaddadfa and the Awlad Suleiman represent the most powerful armed 
factions in the region.

 During the latest clashes, which took place in the city centre, initial 
attempts by tribal leaders to calm the fighting and arrange a ceasefire so that 
bodies could be recovered had failed, residents said.

 By Sunday, Sabha Medical Centre had received the bodies of 16 people killed 
in the clashes and some 50 wounded, said a spokesman for the centre.

 “There are women and children among the wounded and some foreigners from 
sub-Saharan African countries among those killed due to indiscriminate 
shelling,” he said.

 The city lies about 660km (410 miles) south of Tripoli.
