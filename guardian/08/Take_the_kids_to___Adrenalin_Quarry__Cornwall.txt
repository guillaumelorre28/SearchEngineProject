In a nutshell

Throw your family off a cliff into the abyss of an abandoned, water-filled 
quarry in one of two ways: fly through the air on a 490-metre zipwire at up to 
40mph, or be slowly winched 50 metres above the lake on a giant swing and then 
plunged downwards. Personally, I’d rather have six fillings done with no 
anaesthetic, but the zip was the perfect treat for my danger-maniac of a 
15-year-old son. “Can I do it too?” piped up my usually timid eight-year-old 
daughter. [Gulp] “Sure!” I said, in my best devil-may-care voice. You can also 
do axe-throwing (erm, hurling axes at tree-stumps) and coasteering, which 
includes a go on The Blob, a sort of giant inflatable catapault for humans.

Fun fact

There is no age restriction for the zipwire (as long as you weigh over 25kg); 
the youngest rider so far was 19 months, the oldest 94.

Best thing about it

The adrenaline rush. Obvs. My grunty teenager was chatty and cheerful for 
almost an hour afterwards.

What about lunch

You can book and cook a barbecue down by the lake with all the gear and food 
(a sausage plus a burger with a bun and slice of cheese; adult £7.50, child 
£4.50) provided, right down to the matches and the mayo. Proper Cornish pasties 
and cakes from the local bakery are also sold on site, along with hot and cold 
drinks.

Exit through the gift shop?

No merchandise on sale. The most they’ll hit you for is an ice-cream.

Value for money

£12.50 for a ride on the zip, £15 for the giant swing (£7.50/£10 for a second 
go). It’s all over in a few minutes, of course, but picnicking on the lawn and 
wild swimming in the lake are free, so you could make a day of it.

Opening times

Daily 10am-6pm (5pm from October to Easter). No need to pre-book for the zip 
or the swing. Just turn up and jump.

Getting there

Easiest by car. Menheniot train station 
<https://www.gwr.com/plan-journey/journey-information/stations-and-routes/menheniot>
 is just a 10-minute (uphill) walk away but trains are infrequent. A limited 
bus service from Liskeard (Monday to Saturday) drops you 20 minutes away.

The verdict

9/10 from both kids. Their only complaint was that it was all over too quickly.
