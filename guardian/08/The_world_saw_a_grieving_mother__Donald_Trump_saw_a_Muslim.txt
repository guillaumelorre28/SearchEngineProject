There are many sinister things in the world. But a mother’s grief isn’t one of 
them. Yet Donald Trump sees dark undercurrents everywhere – including in the
silent homage Ghazala Khan

, the mother of the fallen soldier Humayun Khan, paid to her son.

“If you look at his wife, she was standing there,” he said, referring to her 
appearance at the Democratic national convention

, in which she stood alongside her husband as he delivered a searing critique 
of Donald Trump. “She had nothing to say … Maybe she wasn’t allowed to have 
anything to say. You tell me.”

It shouldn’t be hard to recognize something as universal as grief. Our hearts 
all break in similar ways, no matter our creed or color. Ms Khan said: “When I 
was standing there, all of America felt my pain, without a single word. I don’t 
know how he missed that.” Well, he did because he was blinded by prejudice. 
Where everyone else saw a mother, Trump saw a Muslim – a faith groupTrump wants

Scrutinizing the silence of a grieving mother is an unusual move for a 
would-be president

Had he not been so fixated on her difference – the salwaar kameez she wore, 
the dupatta scarf draped over her head – he might have interpreted her silence 
in a different way. Perhaps the loss of her son had robbed her of words. Or 
maybe she feared she might break down on the national stage if she uttered his 
name. But that’s not how Trump reasoned. Instead, he suggested that she, a 
Muslim woman, hadn’t been allowed to talk.

Ghazala Khan swiftly corrected him. “I cannot walk into a room with pictures 
of Humayun … Walking on to the convention stage, with a huge picture of my son 
behind me, I could hardly control myself. What mother could?Donald Trump

Does he really need to wonder why I did not speak?”

Scrutinizing the silence of a grieving mother is an unusual move for a 
would-be president. So is the conspiratorial suggestion that she might have 
been silenced. But it fits Trump’s playbook. He deliberately paints minorities, 
especially Muslims, as being fundamentally different from other Americans. He 
questions everything about them. Even their grief.

It is politically convenient to do so in the case of the Khan family. Ghazala 
and her husband, Khizr Khan, have emerged as powerful critics of Donald Trump. 
InKhizr Khan’s speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/khizr-khan-democratic-convention-constitution-trump>
, he said “Hillary Clinton was right when she called my son ‘the best of 
America’. If it was up to Donald Trump, he never would have been in America.”


After famously waving his copy of the US constitution, asking if Trump had 
ever read it, Khan reminded Trump that his son laid down his life for his 
country. “You have sacrificed nothing and no one.”

It makes sense for Trump to disarm these outspoken adversaries in the way he 
knows best: painting them as inherently foreign and un-American. But in the 
process, he risks turning into the “foreign” one himself. He has strayed far 
from societal norms, further than many feel comfortable with.


America, like much of the western world, is going through a tumultuous time. 
Political discourse is coarsening. Fears are heightened. People are on edge. 
But that which makes us human – such the ability to feel empathy – has not 
vanished. Ghazala Khan believes that too, asserting: “All of America felt my 
pain.”

If she is right, then Trump might just find himself alone in this bizarre 
battle against a broken-hearted mother and father.
