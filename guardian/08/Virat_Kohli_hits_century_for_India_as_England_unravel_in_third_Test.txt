The tour is unravelling fast for England. In a match they have to win to have 
a chance of squaring the series, Alastair Cook’s weary travellers were still 
fielding at the end of the third day. Already India have a lead of 51; they 
have three wickets left and one of those belongs toVirat Kohli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/virat-kohli>, an insatiable, inspiring 
captain, who finished the day on 147 not out while giving the impression that 
he has no intention of leaving the green baize here early.

Despite the controlled brilliance of Kohli, England had their chances in front 
of a vibrant weekend crowd. At one point India faltered to 307 for six but the 
tourists were not capable of driving their sudden advantage home. A couple of 
catches were dropped, several long hops propelled and at stumps India were 451 
for seven with Kohli still at the helm and fiercely determined to finish off 
England before the final Test in Chennai.

The dismissal of Cheteshwar Pujara to the second ball of the day was one of 
several false dawns for England and, perhaps, a source of some consolation to 
the many thousands who had strode up Marine Drive to the stadium. Pujara, who 
shouldered arms against Jake Ball, is a very fine player but he is not Kohli, 
the man they all want to see.

They would not be disappointed as Kohli and Murali Vijay added 116 together 
and both would register centuries. Yes, the ball was turning on the distinctive 
red soil of south Mumbai – it is a similar colour in South Molton, as it 
happens. No, this seldom caused any inconvenience to batsmen nurtured against 
the turning ball.

Their methods were contrasting; Vijay, if contained for a while, was prepared 
to hit the ball in the air against the spinners then to pop back into his shell 
for a while before delivering another little aerial assault. There were no such 
fripperies from Kohli.

His batting seems to be enhanced by responsibility; a few risks have been 
eliminated; he declines to hit the ball in the air; it is too important to 
ensure that his team retains control so why leave anything to chance? Not that 
he scored slowly. His judgment of length was superb, his footwork swift and 
precise. After a little flurry of boundaries to third man off Ball to establish 
himself, he was seldom kept on strike for an entire over. When a poor ball came 
along, which happened with exasperating regularity, he hit it unerringly and 
elegantly for four.

The first session yielded 101 runs and the wicket of Pujara. Another 101 were 
added in the second, though somehow England managed to take four wickets. Vijay 
contrived to hit a full toss back to Rashid, which was no more than the 
leg-spinner deserved even it was a fortunate dismissal.

Soon Karun Nair’s skittish little innings was ended with a reviewed lbw 
against Moeen Ali. Out came Parthiv Patel, who had been less than complimentary 
about England’s spinners the previous night. Well, he was not dismissed cheaply 
by Moeen or Rashid; Joe Root got him instead.

Root had just taken over the captaincy for an over or two and on the old 
northern (I assume) principle of “If there’s a job to be done, best do it 
yourself” he immediately put himself on to bowl. Patel drove, edged and the 
ball rebounded from Jonny Bairstow’s chest into his gloves.

Then there was a bonus: the cheap dismissal of Ravi Ashwin, who was caught at 
short leg off Root by Keaton Jennings from the middle of the bat, the ball 
lodging obediently in the fielder’s midriff.

In the next over there was, for a millisecond, the prospect of a first-innings 
lead for England. Kohli, on 68, drove hard and presented a tough return catch 
but Rashid could not hold on. The India captain would make no further mistakes.

England could not turn the screw after that flurry of wickets; there were too 
many loose deliveries and Ravindra Jadeja was inclined to attack, which he did 
briefly until he skied a drive off Rashid.

Out came Jayant Yadav, an impostor at No9, who bedded in alongside Kohli with 
fewer extravagances. He was there to offer his captain congratulations for 
another century rather more sedately than an ecstatic crowd revelling in their 
weekend entertainment.

India v England: fourth Test, day three – live!

Cook stuck with Rashid despite the increasing number of short balls – the 
leg-spinner would end up bowling a 28-over spell, something Shane Warne was 
seldom asked to do – but eventually the second new ball was summoned after 129 
overs. On 405 for seven Jimmy Anderson found the edge of Yadav’s bat and Root 
dropped the catch at second slip.

That was the only chance created by the pacemen and soon the spinners were 
back taking their punishment like gentlemen. In just about every India innings 
in this series there has been a mini collapse in the middle order but England 
have never been able to exploit that – too many loose balls, too many spilled 
chances and, on Saturday, too many wasted reviews.

Just before the close England knew that Yadav had edged to the keeper down the 
leg side off Moeen but the umpire, Bruce Oxenford, did not and no review was 
available. It felt like the final straw.

By then the fingers of Moeen and Rashid must have been aching. They have 
bowled 89 overs between for their four wickets – Root’s intervention was rather 
more economical. Cook would have benefited from another spinner turning the 
ball away from the right-handers. But it is fanciful to suggest that the 
presence of Zafar Ansari, now back in England, or Liam Dawson, newly arrived 
from Bangladesh, would have made much difference.

Of the pacemen, Ball, the only fast bowler to have taken a wicket in the 
match, was the most impressive along with the wily Anderson. Chris Woakes for 
all his enthusiasm, was sparingly used and a minimal threat. The blunt and 
unsurprising truth is that in these conditions India are the better side.
