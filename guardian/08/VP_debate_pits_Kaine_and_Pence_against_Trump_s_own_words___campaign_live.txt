 in his absence during the vice-presidential debate as his running mate Mike 
Pence was accused of trying to defend the indefensible. But Democrat Tim Kaine, 
embracing his role as Hillary Clinton’s attack dog, interrupted so aggressively 
that many analysts felt he lost the debate on style to the calm, composed and 
measured Republican Indiana governor. In a focus group conducted by strategist 
Frank Luntz for CBS News in the swing state of Ohio, 22 people said that Pence 
won and only four said Virginia senator Kaine prevailed. When Luntz ran a 
similar group during last week’s presidential debate, Clinton beat Trump 16-6.

, the Latino community flipped the script on a comment made by the Indiana 
governor during Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. “Senator, you whipped out 
that Mexican thing again,” Pence responded to Virginia senator Tim Kaine at one 
point. Kaine brought up Donald Trump’s controversial past statements many times 
during the debate, including when the Republican nominee said that Mexico was 
sending criminals and rapists across the border ina June 2015 speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic>
. He continually asked Indiana governor Mike Pence to defend his running mate’s 
remarks.

 * Donald Trump took credit for his running mate’s performance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/mike-pence-debate-donald-trump-rally>
 in the vice-presidential debate during a rally in Nevada, claiming Mike 
Pence’s success proved Trump has good taste in people. “Mike Pence did an 
incredible job and I’m getting a lot of credit, because that’s really my first 
so-called choice, that’s really my first hire, and I tell you, he’s a good 
one,” said Trump at a rally on Wednesday in Henderson, Nevada. “He was 
phenomenal – he was cool, he was smart – he was meant to be doing what he’s 
doing, and we are very very proud of Governor Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike 
Pence.” 
 * On Sunday, a 200-person flashmob appeared in New York City’s Union Square. 
Wearing brightly coloured suits and T-shirts with slogans like The Future is 
Female, they performed a carefully choreographed, five-minute tribute to 
Hillary Clinton, as Justin Timberlake’s Can’t Stop the Feeling played over 
loudspeaker. The “pantsuit power” flashmob and its resulting video, which was 
released on Tuesday, was orchestrated by film-makers and real-life partners 
Celia Rowlson-Hall and Mia Lidofsky in an attempt to “dance Hillary Clinton 
into the White House”. Over the course of nine days, the couple, who are based 
in Brooklyn, pulled together volunteers from all over North America, organizing 
a 10-camera shoot on a micro-budget and sourcing hundreds of suits from thrift 
stores all over New York.

The Trump campaign has released a statement criticizing the White House for 
the impending enaction of the Paris Agreement intended to address climate 
change, calling the accord - which President Barack Obama today called “the 
best possible shot to save the one planet we’ve got” - a “bad deal” that will 
cost the American economy trillions of dollars.

“It will also impose enormous costs on American households through higher 
electricity prices and higher taxes,” wrote deputy policy director Dan Kowalski.

“As our nation considers these issues, Mr. Trump and Gov. Pence appreciate 
that many scientists are concerned about greenhouse gas emissions. We need 
America’s scientists to continue studying the scientific issues but without 
political agendas getting in the way. We also need to be vigilant to defend the 
interests of the American people in any efforts taken on this front.”

The White House has accused Israel <https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> 
of a betrayal of trust, in an unusually sharp rebuke over its plans to build 
hundreds of new settlement homes deep in the West Bank.

Days after Obama approved a $38bn Israeli military aid package and attended 
former president Shimon Peres’s funeral in Jerusalem, the White House railed at 
the construction of 300 housing units on land “far closer to Jordan than 
Israel”.

Warning that the decision jeopardizes the already distant prospect of Middle 
East peace as well as Israel’s own security, press secretary Josh Earnest said 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s word had been called into question.


“We did receive public assurances from the Israeli government that contradict 
this announcement,” he said.

“I guess when we’re talking about how good friends treat one another, that’s a 
source of serious concern as well.”

The sharper-than-normal comments come as the White House weighs a last-ditch 
effort to get the peace process back on its feet before Obama leaves office in 
January.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, speaking at a campaign rally 
in Reno, Nevada, told an audience of supporters that when in the state, one 
must correctly pronounce the state’s name,

Unfortunately, he insisted on using the incorrect pronunciation.

While discussing meth overdoses in Nevada, Trump segued into a spiel on the 
correct pronunciation of the state’s name, using a long A instead of a short A, 
which is not the preferred pronunciation.

“Meth overdoses in Nevada - Ne-VAH-da - and you know what I said? You know 
what I said? I said when I came out here, I said, ‘nobody says it the other 
way, it has to be Ne-VAH-da, right?”

The audience protested, but Trump apparently did not hear them.

“And if you don’t say it correctly - and it didn’t happen to me, but it 
happened to a friend of mine, he was killed.”

Poll: Eight-in-ten New Yorkers don't want Trump children to run for mayor

Donald Trump’s eldest son may be interested in running the largest city in the 
United States, but the city’s residents feel very differently about the matter, 
according to a new poll.

According to a survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal, 80% of registered 
New York City voters don’t wantDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> Jr. run for mayor, and 81% 
said they felt the same way about sister Ivanka Trump. New York, an 
overwhelmingly Democratic city that nevertheless has elected Republicans to 
serve as two of its past three mayors.

In July, Donald Trump Jr. declared that he would “love to” run for mayor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/donald-trump-jr-new-york-mayor-bill-de-blasio>
.

“I never like to rule anything out,” he said, in response to a question about 
whether he would run against Bill De Blasio, a leading progressive voice and
ally of Hillary Clinton 
<http://www.npr.org/2016/04/19/474788269/why-new-york-mayor-de-blasio-backs-clinton-over-sanders>
, whom he served as campaign manager when she was elected to the US Senate in 
New York in 2000.

“We always like to keep our options open, so if I could do that as a service 
to my country, I would love to do that.”

Donald Trump, never a huge fan of the first amendment of the US constitution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment>
, threatened during a campaign rally in Henderson, Nevada, this afternoon to 
sue political groups running “nasty” advertisements against him.

“I saw today... a commercial where, it was really a nasty commercial, totally 
made up, about me with vets,” Trump said. “There is nobody that loves the vets 
more or respects the vets more. They’re spending hundreds of millions of 
dollars on false commercials, and it’s a disgrace. So what we’ll do, I guess 
we’ll sue them. Let’s sue them.”

Trump may have been referring to a campaign advertisement run by Hillary 
Clinton’s team called Sacrifice, which juxtaposes statements he has made about 
the military with video of veterans watching those statements:

Which part of the commercial could be “totally made up” is unclear, since most 
of the statements are verbatim recordings of Trump’s own statements, but we’ve 
reached out to the Trump campaign to clarify.

 * Donald Trump was put on trial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/vice-presidential-debate-pence-kaine-trump-clinton>
 in his absence during the vice-presidential debate as his running mate Mike 
Pence was accused of trying to defend the indefensible. But Democrat Tim Kaine, 
embracing his role as Hillary Clinton’s attack dog, interrupted so aggressively 
that many analysts felt he lost the debate on style to the calm, composed and 
measured Republican Indiana governor. In a focus group conducted by strategist 
Frank Luntz for CBS News in the swing state of Ohio, 22 people said that Pence 
won and only four said Virginia senator Kaine prevailed. When Luntz ran a 
similar group during last week’s presidential debate, Clinton beat Trump 16-6. 
Vice-presidential debate highlights: Kaine and Pence face-off

 * But Pence didn’t win with everyone: Using #ThatMexicanThing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/that-mexican-thing-mike-pence-vice-presidential-debate>
, the Latino community flipped the script on a comment made by the Indiana 
governor during Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. “Senator, you whipped out 
that Mexican thing again,” Pence responded to Virginia senator Tim Kaine at one 
point. Kaine brought up Donald Trump’s controversial past statements many times 
during the debate, including when the Republican nominee said that Mexico was 
sending criminals and rapists across the border ina June 2015 speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic>
. He continually asked Indiana governor Mike Pence to defend his running mate’s 
remarks.

 * Donald Trump took credit for his running mate’s performance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/mike-pence-debate-donald-trump-rally>
 in the vice-presidential debate during a rally in Nevada, claiming Mike 
Pence’s success proved Trump has good taste in people. “Mike Pence did an 
incredible job and I’m getting a lot of credit, because that’s really my first 
so-called choice, that’s really my first hire, and I tell you, he’s a good 
one,” said Trump at a rally on Wednesday in Henderson, Nevada. “He was 
phenomenal – he was cool, he was smart – he was meant to be doing what he’s 
doing, and we are very very proud of Governor Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike 
Pence.” 
 * On Sunday, a 200-person flashmob appeared in New York City’s Union Square. 
Wearing brightly coloured suits and T-shirts with slogans like The Future is 
Female, they performed a carefully choreographed, five-minute tribute to 
Hillary Clinton, as Justin Timberlake’s Can’t Stop the Feeling played over 
loudspeaker. The “pantsuit power” flashmob and its resulting video, which was 
released on Tuesday, was orchestrated by film-makers and real-life partners 
Celia Rowlson-Hall and Mia Lidofsky in an attempt to “dance Hillary Clinton 
into the White House”. Over the course of nine days, the couple, who are based 
in Brooklyn, pulled together volunteers from all over North America, organizing 
a 10-camera shoot on a micro-budget and sourcing hundreds of suits from thrift 
stores all over New York.
 
In an advertisement directed by Hollywood director Lee Daniels, actors Taraji 
P. Henson, Bryshere Gray, Trai Byers, Jussie Smollett, Tasha Smith, Gabourey 
Sidibe and Grace Byers encourage their fans to vote for the Democratic 
presidential nominee in November.

 
The Trump campaign has released a statement criticizing the White House for 
the impending enaction of the Paris Agreement intended to address climate 
change, calling the accord - which President Barack Obama today called “the 
best possible shot to save the one planet we’ve got” - a “bad deal” that will 
cost the American economy trillions of dollars.

“It will also impose enormous costs on American households through higher 
electricity prices and higher taxes,” wrote deputy policy director Dan Kowalski.

“As our nation considers these issues, Mr. Trump and Gov. Pence appreciate 
that many scientists are concerned about greenhouse gas emissions. We need 
America’s scientists to continue studying the scientific issues but without 
political agendas getting in the way. We also need to be vigilant to defend the 
interests of the American people in any efforts taken on this front.”

The White House has accused Israel <https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> 
of a betrayal of trust, in an unusually sharp rebuke over its plans to build 
hundreds of new settlement homes deep in the West Bank.

Days after Obama approved a $38bn Israeli military aid package and attended 
former president Shimon Peres’s funeral in Jerusalem, the White House railed at 
the construction of 300 housing units on land “far closer to Jordan than 
Israel”.

Warning that the decision jeopardizes the already distant prospect of Middle 
East peace as well as Israel’s own security, press secretary Josh Earnest said 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s word had been called into question.


“We did receive public assurances from the Israeli government that contradict 
this announcement,” he said.

“I guess when we’re talking about how good friends treat one another, that’s a 
source of serious concern as well.”

The sharper-than-normal comments come as the White House weighs a last-ditch 
effort to get the peace process back on its feet before Obama leaves office in 
January.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, speaking at a campaign rally 
in Reno, Nevada, told an audience of supporters that when in the state, one 
must correctly pronounce the state’s name,

Unfortunately, he insisted on using the incorrect pronunciation.

While discussing meth overdoses in Nevada, Trump segued into a spiel on the 
correct pronunciation of the state’s name, using a long A instead of a short A, 
which is not the preferred pronunciation.

“Meth overdoses in Nevada - Ne-VAH-da - and you know what I said? You know 
what I said? I said when I came out here, I said, ‘nobody says it the other 
way, it has to be Ne-VAH-da, right?”

The audience protested, but Trump apparently did not hear them.

“And if you don’t say it correctly - and it didn’t happen to me, but it 
happened to a friend of mine, he was killed.”

Donald Trump’s eldest son may be interested in running the largest city in the 
United States, but the city’s residents feel very differently about the matter, 
according to a new poll.

According to a survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal, 80% of registered 
New York City voters don’t wantDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> Jr. run for mayor, and 81% 
said they felt the same way about sister Ivanka Trump. New York, an 
overwhelmingly Democratic city that nevertheless has elected Republicans to 
serve as two of its past three mayors.

In July, Donald Trump Jr. declared that he would “love to” run for mayor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/donald-trump-jr-new-york-mayor-bill-de-blasio>
.

“I never like to rule anything out,” he said, in response to a question about 
whether he would run against Bill De Blasio, a leading progressive voice and
ally of Hillary Clinton 
<http://www.npr.org/2016/04/19/474788269/why-new-york-mayor-de-blasio-backs-clinton-over-sanders>
, whom he served as campaign manager when she was elected to the US Senate in 
New York in 2000.

“We always like to keep our options open, so if I could do that as a service 
to my country, I would love to do that.”
 
Donald Trump, never a huge fan of the first amendment of the US constitution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment>
, threatened during a campaign rally in Henderson, Nevada, this afternoon to 
sue political groups running “nasty” advertisements against him.

“I saw today... a commercial where, it was really a nasty commercial, totally 
made up, about me with vets,” Trump said. “There is nobody that loves the vets 
more or respects the vets more. They’re spending hundreds of millions of 
dollars on false commercials, and it’s a disgrace. So what we’ll do, I guess 
we’ll sue them. Let’s sue them.”

Trump may have been referring to a campaign advertisement run by Hillary 
Clinton’s team called Sacrifice, which juxtaposes statements he has made about 
the military with video of veterans watching those statements:

Which part of the commercial could be “totally made up” is unclear, since most 
of the statements are verbatim recordings of Trump’s own statements, but we’ve 
reached out to the Trump campaign to clarify.
