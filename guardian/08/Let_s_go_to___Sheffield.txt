What else is there to do in the city?
Eyesore or iconic depending your viewpoint, the Park Hill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/aug/14/park-hill-brutalist-sheffield-estate-controversial-renovation>
 housing estate, is a Brutalist colossus, where former pubThe Scottish Queen 
<http://www.s1artspace.org/programme/park-hill/>, reopened earlier this year as 
a new temporary exhibition space. Its current show, until 24 October, is There 
is no Wealth but Life, an exhibition by printmkerPeter Doig 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/peter-doig>. For browsing, the 
Antiques Quarter <http://sheffieldantiquesquarter.co.uk/> along Abbeydale Road 
has plenty to offer.

Where to eat
There’s great South Indian/Sri Lankan food at Rama’s Bridge 
<http://www.ramasbridge.co.uk/index.php> (190 Crookes). In the centre, charming 
Mama’s and Leonie’s <http://www.mamasandleonies.co.uk/> (111 Norfolk Street) is 
unchanged since 1968. Try its unorthodox but delicious fruit pizza. If you’ve 
had a beer or three in studenty Ecclesall Road and fancy something greasy, a 
beef chilli hotdog (£8.50) from Yankees (at number 418) might suit.

Where to drink
For beer with a dose of industry try the canalside Fat Cat 
<http://www.thefatcat.co.uk/> (23 Alma Street). The Sheffield Tap 
<http://www.sheffieldtap.com/> at the station and the Rising Sun (471 Fulwood 
Road), with its 13-pump bar and mammoth array of beers, are both excellent. For 
a straightforward pub, try Kes author Barry Hines’s old haunt,The Lescar  
<https://www.thelescarhuntersbar.co.uk/>(303 Sharrow Vale Road).

Anywhere to stay for under £100?
The recently opened boutique Brocco on the Park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/11/british-boltholes-brocco-on-the-park-sheffield>
 (0114 266 1233) has doubles from £75. For something more rustic, theNorfolk 
Arms <http://norfolkarms.com/> (0114 230 2197), on the edge of the Peak 
District, has doubles from £85.
