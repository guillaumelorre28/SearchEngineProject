The Guardian Social Care Network is an online community for people working in 
and with the sector. At a time when frontline staff are often denied a voice, 
and public opinion can be negative, the network is a space for professionals to 
remain informed on news and comment while also sharing their own opinions.

We curate views from the sector to bring you insightful commentary and blogs, 
interesting series, in-depth features and social care news. Whatever your 
specific job role or specialist field, we provide relevant articles and useful 
resources.

Join our community <https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/> (for free) 
for exclusive benefits and to receive our weekly newsletter, keeping you up to 
date with whatâ€™s going on in social care.
