Kevin Pietersen <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen> will be 
out of action until November after tearing his calf muscle in the Indian 
Premier League. The former England batsman had faced only one ball in the 
Rising Pune Supergiants’ game against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Friday 
when he retired after hurting his leg taking off for a single.

He called for assistance immediately and was carried from the field. The 
35-year‑old posted a picture of himself in a wheelchair in the dressing room, 
with strapping on his calf, alongside the word “Urgh!” on Facebook soon after 
the incident.
