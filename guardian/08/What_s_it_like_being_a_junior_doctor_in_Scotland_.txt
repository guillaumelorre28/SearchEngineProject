 ‘Fort William is a beautiful place – the scenery is spectacular.’ 
My parents drove me up from Southampton to Aberdeen over a couple of weeks, 
visiting different medical schools. We decided Edinburgh was not only the 
nicest place to live but also had one of the best medical schools in the world.

Initially it was the medical school that attracted me, but after being in 
Scotland for five years you kind of fall in love with the place.

The Highlands is a beautiful place to live but it’s also a challenging place 
to practise medicine. I felt it was a great place for me to increase my 
confidence and learn how to be the best GP I could be.

General practice gives you the continuity that you don’t get from A&E, because 
you are looking after families over time. You also get independence – I can 
live in a small community with 100 people, or I can live in a big city. I can 
also choose any contractual model, whether partnered or salaried.

Medical educators in rural places are really dedicated people. The clinical 
supervisors, educational supervisors and programme directors are really there 
to support you. Fort William is a beautiful place – the scenery is spectacular. 
It’s also a community that is just the right size. It’s small enough that you 
feel part of something – you get to know people and look after families – but 
it’s also big enough that there’s enough going on to keep things interesting.

If you are an outdoor person, then there is plenty to do out here. You can go 
hill-walking, hill-running, kayaking, sailing or mountain climbing. In the 
winter there’s just as much to do with skiing, ice climbing and winter 
mountaineering. The great thing about Fort William is there are activities that 
you can get involved with all year round.

There’s no job like it in the world.

 ‘Scotland was something new, something exciting.’ 
When I was coming to the end of my training at medical school in Brighton and 
thinking about where to apply to work as a doctor, I wasn’t sure where to go 
initially.


My first job in Scotland was in Inverness, so quite different from life in 
London. The mix of working in quite a large hospital but being on the doorstep 
of the wilderness was a really good change – something new, something exciting.

I’d always wanted to work with children and coming to Scotland has given me 
the opportunity to do that in some really interesting locations. I would say to 
anyone that Scotland is a really good place to start your training.

My exposure to various different clinical scenarios has been second to none.

My first job was elderly medicine. I had the most fantastic supervisor, who 
took me under his wing and shaped me into the doctor that I am today. Certainly 
when I speak to friends who have trained in other places, the quality of my 
experiences and my exposure to various different clinical scenarios is second 
to none.

The children’s clinical research facility at Edinburgh’s sick kids is the only 
phase 1 accredited trial centre for children in Scotland, which means we get to 
do lots of groundbreaking trials. The training opportunities I’ve had outside 
of day-to-day work – opportunities for continuing professional development and 
things like that – are really great in Scotland. We are certainly encouraged to 
seek further training and opportunities to develop.

I live across the meadows from the hospital, a beautiful five minute walk to 
work across green space with a massive mountain in the background. It’s these 
kinds of simple pleasures I really like about living here. When I moved to 
Edinburgh I had a whole month of the Fringe Festival, which was absolutely 
fantastic. It was almost like being on holiday, except I went to work in the 
day then carried on enjoying the atmosphere afterwards. At various times in the 
year there’s the Film Festival, Food Festival, Whisky Festival – pretty much 
anything you can think of.

Working for NHS Scotland in general, regardless of specialty, has a really 
unique feel about it. The joined-up nature of services and innumerable 
opportunities available for personal development are really key to Scotland’s 
success in training doctors. When I started off at Inverness, it was only an 
hour on a plane to London – and it was easy to get to any other place in 
Scotland.

I think you’d be hard pressed to find anywhere that gives you a better 
all-round opportunity for work and general life than Scotland. It’s great – 
what more can you ask for?
