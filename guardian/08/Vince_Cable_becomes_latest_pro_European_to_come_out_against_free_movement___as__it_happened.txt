 I flagged up this Politco Europe article  
<http://www.politico.eu/article/why-we-lost-the-brexit-vote-former-uk-prime-minister-david-cameron/>
and said it was by Mats Persson. That’s my mistake. It’s by Daniel Korski, who 
also worked as an adviser to David Cameron on Europe and on other matters. I’m 
sorry. But it’s still a good read.

The Financial Times (subscription) has published a good article by Alex Barker 
this morning relating to Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation. 
<https://www.ft.com/content/0455c2e8-d27c-11e6-9341-7393bb2e1b51> Barker says 
Rogers’ colleagues say he had his “hair on fire” worrying about the prospects 
of Britain getting a transitional deal as it leaves the EU.

Sir Ivan Rogers’ warning to Downing Street, leaked in December, that the EU 
expects a full UK trade deal to take until the early to mid-2020s seemed stark. 
By Brussels standards, however, it was one of the more uncontroversial aspects 
of his advice.

More significant was his assessment that British political imperatives to 
control borders and leave the jurisdiction of European courts required the UK 
to go for a “hard Brexit” deal, leaving the UK outside the customs union and 
the single market. Given this reality, the most valuable outcome of Article 50 
talks would be co-ordinated, orderly transition terms that would allow Britain 
to adjust.

Such a transition would also, in his view, quite well be impossible to agree.

Barker explains the problems around negotiating a transitional deal in some 
detail. But one key difficulty is that the political priorities for the UK and 
for the EU could turn out to be incompatible, he argues.

For the EU-27, any transition must be simpler than a final EU-UK trade deal. 
That means fashioning a transition from existing EU systems: the European Court 
of Justice, EU laws, EU budget contributions and core EU rights such as the 
free movement of people. But any bespoke transition cannot be allowed to look 
better than actual membership.

By contrast, Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay>, 
the UK prime minister, is preparing for an election in 2020. That would 
probably be after Britain leaves — likely to be in 2019 — so potentially in the 
middle of any transitional period. Yet she will have to reconcile the terms of 
any deal with two promises she has made to British voters: to leave the 
jurisdiction of EU courts and to repatriate controls over immigration.

A transition deal would need to be sellable during a British election 
campaign, yet it will involve rights and obligations on which the EU side will 
be least willing to compromise. Here is the rub for both parties.

11.18am GMT 11:18  <> 

Services sector activity jumped to a 17-month high in December as the British 
economy continues to exhibit signs of resilience in the face of Brexit 
uncertainty, the Press Association reports.

The closely watched Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) 
reached 56.2 in December, up from 55.2 in November and above economists’ 
forecasts of 54.7.

A reading above 50 indicates growth. 

The PMI report said the sharp expansion in December rounded off the strongest 
quarter of the year, driven by new business.

Sentiment towards the outlook for the next 12 months also strengthened, 
despite ongoing uncertainty regarding Brexit and European elections, it added.

However, data also signalled that inflationary pressures in the sector 
remained substantial, with prices rising at the strongest rate since April 2011.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: “A buoyant 
service sector adds to signs that the UK economy continues to defy widely-held 
expectations of a Brexit-driven slowdown. The faster growth of services 
activity follows similar news of improvements in the manufacturing and 
construction sectors at the end of 2016.

“At face value, this improvement suggests that the next move by the Bank of 
England <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> is more 
likely to be a rate hike than a cut, but policymakers are clearly concerned 
about the extent to which Brexit-related uncertainty could slow growth this 
year.”

Kezia Dugdale, the Labour leader in Scotland, has used a new year interview 
with the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland to renew her call for the UK to adopt a 
federal structure, with Scotland getting more powers. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/07/scottish-labour-new-federal-state-unite-uk-after-brexit-kezia-dugdale-nicola-sturgeon>
She told the programme:

For me, the big question in 2017 is how we save the Union. I think the United 
Kingdom is in terrible peril because of a gamble the Tories have forced with 
Brexit and the SNP’s obsession with independence. So, 2017 has got to be about 
protecting the Union.

Our country is divided. The way to bring that country back together is by an 
Act of Union to save the Union. Let’s have a federal solution for the United 
Kingdom that offers the solution that we need.

But Dugdale would not say whether this would be a policy adopted by the UK 
Labour party. When pressed on this, she said:

I am arguing for a federal solution for the whole of the United Kingdom ... 
Jeremy Corbyn has already put his support behind a constitutional convention 
for the United Kingdom.

Lord Marland, the Conservative former trade envoy, told the Today programme 
this morning that he did not think Whitehall had the skills set to conduct a 
good Brexit negotiation. (See 9.20am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/05/whitehall-lacks-skills-for-hard-nosed-brexit-negotiation-says-former-trade-envoy-politics-live?page=with:block-586e0469e4b081b2b4eda443#block-586e0469e4b081b2b4eda443>
 LaterMats Persson, who worked as David Cameron’s EU adviser in Number 10, told 
the same programme he disagreed.

My experience is Britain has some of the best civil servants in the world. 
Whitehall does have the skill set to deliver it. I think the UK government is 
actually quite far advanced in its plans, there’s been a bit of unfair 
headlines recently.

I think that of course this is complex, and I’m on the outside now, but there 
certainly are other civil servants in Whitehall on top of their game. This is 
about identifying a deal which involves benefits on both sides, both sides have 
to have something to gain. Britain has some leverage, it’s a massive market.

Persson also said that he thought Cameron could have got more from his EU 
renegotiation if he had given it more time.

It was a deal that was far from meaningless, but could we have got more? 
Maybe. I think played differently, over a longer period of time, we could have 
achieved more reforms, yes.

UPDATE: Earlier I flagged up this Politco Europe article  
<http://www.politico.eu/article/why-we-lost-the-brexit-vote-former-uk-prime-minister-david-cameron/>
and said it was by Persson. That’s my mistake. It’s byDaniel Korski, who also 
worked as an adviser to David Cameron on Europe and on other matters. I’m 
sorry. But it’s still a good read.

The Today programme also interviewed Tom Fletcher, a former UK ambassador to 
Lebanon and a former Number 10 foreign policy adviser, about Sir Tim Barrow. 
Fletcher said Barrow was “bulletproof”.

It’s the toughest negotiation in our life times and I think [Barrow] is up to 
it. I have seen him in Brussels. He knows the corridors, he knows the 
characters.

But actually more importantly I saw him in Moscow where he was incredibly 
resilient as ambassador there, dealing with [Vladimir] Putin in a very testing 
time in our relationship and Tim had a reputation of being bulletproof out 
there.

Fletcher also said that he thought it was unreasonable for people to criticise 
the government for not disclosing its Brexit plan.

I think people feel that the scale of the challenge is enormous. But we’ve got 
a lot of our best people on it. I think people get a bit fed up of some of the 
coverage that says why aren’t we being more public with the plans. Muhammad Ali 
didn’t brief everyone in advance on the Rumble in the Jungle [his boxing 
victory over George Foreman].

My colleague Jessica Elgot wasn’t impressed by Fletcher’s analogy.

On the Today programme Sir Robert Cooper, a former Foreign Office diplomat who 
has also worked for the EU, welcomed Sir Tim Barrow’s appointment. Asked about 
him, Cooper said:

He’s honest, he’s tough, he’s someone how knows Europe very well, although not 
so much the community part. He’s done lots of foreign policy in Europe ... At 
least we’ve got somebody, he may not know all the technical stuff, but he knows 
how Europe works in terms of dealing with people.

But Cooper also said that diplomats were currently hampered by a lack of 
direction over Brexit.

I think at the moment there is a policy vacuum. It’s not surprising. This is a 
gigantic enterprise that’s been taken on and needs a lot of thought. I think at 
the moment probably the atmosphere is difficult because people don’t know where 
they are going. You need to have a sense of direction.

Lord Livingston, the former chief executive of BT and a trade minister in 
David Cameron’s government, was on the Today programme talking about Brexit. He 
said that negotiating a trade deal with the EU would take time.

First of all of course we have to actually sort out what’s broadly going to be 
our relationship with the EU. Are we going to be in the single market? Probably 
not. Are we going to be in the customs union?

Then you can turn your attention to other countries but the trade deal for 
instance with Canada still isn’t fully implemented and that’s about seven years 
on.

You can do quick trade deals, you can do good trade deals, you can do 
wide-ranging trade deals - you just can’t do all three of them at the same time.

Theresa May and her ministers are currently saying that they think Britain 
should be able to negotiate new trade arrangements with the EU within the 
two-year exit process. But many people are saying that is unrealistic andthe 
European commission has indicated that it wants to negotiate Britain’s 
withdrawal from the EU first, before going on to then negotiate a new trade 
deal afterwards.

Whitehall lacks skills for 'hard-nosed' Brexit negotiation, says former trade 
envoy

Yesterday Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> acted 
swiftly to fill the vacancy created by the surprise resignation of Britain’s 
ambassador to the EU. Here’s the Guardian’s version of the story.

Sir Tim Barrow appointed as Britain's EU ambassador

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/sir-tim-barrow-appointed-as-britains-eu-ambassador>
And here is how it starts.

Theresa May has moved swiftly to calm tensions over the resignation of Sir 
Ivan Rogers as Britain’s ambassador to the EU by appointing career diplomatSir 
Tim Barrow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/sir-tim-barrow-profile-he-will-report-back-reliably-on-eu-thinking>
 as his replacement.

The decision means the prime minister has ignored calls to appoint a 
wholehearted Brexiter, in a move that will reassure those in the civil service 
who feared the role would be politicised.

Of course, one of the glories of the British press is that readers never had 
to make do with just one version of reality.Their story on this 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4090310/Theresa-crushes-Brexit-dissenters-appointing-new-EU-ambassador-faced-Putin-blocked-Eurocrat-plans-EU-army.html>
 has a headline in the paper saying “Theresa crushes Brexit dissenters” and it 
says May “quashed a civil service revolt over her Brexit strategy by appointing 
a senior diplomat who faced down the Russians to be the UK’s new man in 
Brussels”. The Mail, of course, is very much in favour of May, but not “Brexit 
dissenters”.

There is quite a lot of reaction around to Barrow’s appointment this morning 
and I will be covering it here. On the Today programmeLord Marland, a former 
trade envoy to David Cameron who now chairs the Commonwealth Enterprise and 
Investment Council, said he did not think Whitehall had the skill set to 
conduct a successful Brexit negotiation. He told the programme:

My fear is that Whitehall as a whole has really not got the skill set to 
deliver a really hard-nosed negotiation and I think we have really got to up 
skill in that area to do it.

There is only one item in the diary for today.


10.30am: Chuka Umunna launches the report from the all-party group on social 
integration. As my colleague Anushka Asthana reports, it proposes a regional 
immigration policy after Brexit under which some parts of Britain would be able 
to clamp down on the numbers of foreign workers while others could maintain an 
open-door policy. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/05/theresa-may-faces-calls-to-implement-regional-immigration-policy>

As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as 
bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to 
post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon.

I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read 
them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere 
and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although 
sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a

 I flagged up this Politco Europe article  
<http://www.politico.eu/article/why-we-lost-the-brexit-vote-former-uk-prime-minister-david-cameron/>
and said it was by Mats Persson. That’s my mistake. It’s by Daniel Korski, who 
also worked as an adviser to David Cameron on Europe and on other matters. I’m 
sorry. But it’s still a good read.
 
The Financial Times (subscription) has published a good article by Alex Barker 
this morning relating to Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation. 
<https://www.ft.com/content/0455c2e8-d27c-11e6-9341-7393bb2e1b51> Barker says 
Rogers’ colleagues say he had his “hair on fire” worrying about the prospects 
of Britain getting a transitional deal as it leaves the EU.

Sir Ivan Rogers’ warning to Downing Street, leaked in December, that the EU 
expects a full UK trade deal to take until the early to mid-2020s seemed stark. 
By Brussels standards, however, it was one of the more uncontroversial aspects 
of his advice.

More significant was his assessment that British political imperatives to 
control borders and leave the jurisdiction of European courts required the UK 
to go for a “hard Brexit” deal, leaving the UK outside the customs union and 
the single market. Given this reality, the most valuable outcome of Article 50 
talks would be co-ordinated, orderly transition terms that would allow Britain 
to adjust.

Such a transition would also, in his view, quite well be impossible to agree.

Barker explains the problems around negotiating a transitional deal in some 
detail. But one key difficulty is that the political priorities for the UK and 
for the EU could turn out to be incompatible, he argues.

For the EU-27, any transition must be simpler than a final EU-UK trade deal. 
That means fashioning a transition from existing EU systems: the European Court 
of Justice, EU laws, EU budget contributions and core EU rights such as the 
free movement of people. But any bespoke transition cannot be allowed to look 
better than actual membership.

By contrast, Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay>, 
the UK prime minister, is preparing for an election in 2020. That would 
probably be after Britain leaves — likely to be in 2019 — so potentially in the 
middle of any transitional period. Yet she will have to reconcile the terms of 
any deal with two promises she has made to British voters: to leave the 
jurisdiction of EU courts and to repatriate controls over immigration.

A transition deal would need to be sellable during a British election 
campaign, yet it will involve rights and obligations on which the EU side will 
be least willing to compromise. Here is the rub for both parties.
 
Services sector activity jumped to a 17-month high in December as the British 
economy continues to exhibit signs of resilience in the face of Brexit 
uncertainty, the Press Association reports.

The closely watched Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) 
reached 56.2 in December, up from 55.2 in November and above economists’ 
forecasts of 54.7.

A reading above 50 indicates growth. 

The PMI report said the sharp expansion in December rounded off the strongest 
quarter of the year, driven by new business.

Sentiment towards the outlook for the next 12 months also strengthened, 
despite ongoing uncertainty regarding Brexit and European elections, it added.

However, data also signalled that inflationary pressures in the sector 
remained substantial, with prices rising at the strongest rate since April 2011.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: “A buoyant 
service sector adds to signs that the UK economy continues to defy widely-held 
expectations of a Brexit-driven slowdown. The faster growth of services 
activity follows similar news of improvements in the manufacturing and 
construction sectors at the end of 2016.

“At face value, this improvement suggests that the next move by the Bank of 
England <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> is more 
likely to be a rate hike than a cut, but policymakers are clearly concerned 
about the extent to which Brexit-related uncertainty could slow growth this 
year.”
 
Kezia Dugdale, the Labour leader in Scotland, has used a new year interview 
with the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland to renew her call for the UK to adopt a 
federal structure, with Scotland getting more powers. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/07/scottish-labour-new-federal-state-unite-uk-after-brexit-kezia-dugdale-nicola-sturgeon>
She told the programme:

For me, the big question in 2017 is how we save the Union. I think the United 
Kingdom is in terrible peril because of a gamble the Tories have forced with 
Brexit and the SNP’s obsession with independence. So, 2017 has got to be about 
protecting the Union.

Our country is divided. The way to bring that country back together is by an 
Act of Union to save the Union. Let’s have a federal solution for the United 
Kingdom that offers the solution that we need.

But Dugdale would not say whether this would be a policy adopted by the UK 
Labour party. When pressed on this, she said:

I am arguing for a federal solution for the whole of the United Kingdom ... 
Jeremy Corbyn has already put his support behind a constitutional convention 
for the United Kingdom.

Lord Marland, the Conservative former trade envoy, told the Today programme 
this morning that he did not think Whitehall had the skills set to conduct a 
good Brexit negotiation. (See 9.20am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/05/whitehall-lacks-skills-for-hard-nosed-brexit-negotiation-says-former-trade-envoy-politics-live?page=with:block-586e0469e4b081b2b4eda443#block-586e0469e4b081b2b4eda443>
 LaterMats Persson, who worked as David Cameron’s EU adviser in Number 10, told 
the same programme he disagreed.

My experience is Britain has some of the best civil servants in the world. 
Whitehall does have the skill set to deliver it. I think the UK government is 
actually quite far advanced in its plans, there’s been a bit of unfair 
headlines recently.

I think that of course this is complex, and I’m on the outside now, but there 
certainly are other civil servants in Whitehall on top of their game. This is 
about identifying a deal which involves benefits on both sides, both sides have 
to have something to gain. Britain has some leverage, it’s a massive market.

Persson also said that he thought Cameron could have got more from his EU 
renegotiation if he had given it more time.

It was a deal that was far from meaningless, but could we have got more? 
Maybe. I think played differently, over a longer period of time, we could have 
achieved more reforms, yes.

UPDATE: Earlier I flagged up this Politco Europe article  
<http://www.politico.eu/article/why-we-lost-the-brexit-vote-former-uk-prime-minister-david-cameron/>
and said it was by Persson. That’s my mistake. It’s byDaniel Korski, who also 
worked as an adviser to David Cameron on Europe and on other matters. I’m 
sorry. But it’s still a good read.
 
The Today programme also interviewed Tom Fletcher, a former UK ambassador to 
Lebanon and a former Number 10 foreign policy adviser, about Sir Tim Barrow. 
Fletcher said Barrow was “bulletproof”.

It’s the toughest negotiation in our life times and I think [Barrow] is up to 
it. I have seen him in Brussels. He knows the corridors, he knows the 
characters.

But actually more importantly I saw him in Moscow where he was incredibly 
resilient as ambassador there, dealing with [Vladimir] Putin in a very testing 
time in our relationship and Tim had a reputation of being bulletproof out 
there.

Fletcher also said that he thought it was unreasonable for people to criticise 
the government for not disclosing its Brexit plan.

I think people feel that the scale of the challenge is enormous. But we’ve got 
a lot of our best people on it. I think people get a bit fed up of some of the 
coverage that says why aren’t we being more public with the plans. Muhammad Ali 
didn’t brief everyone in advance on the Rumble in the Jungle [his boxing 
victory over George Foreman].

My colleague Jessica Elgot wasn’t impressed by Fletcher’s analogy.

On the Today programme Sir Robert Cooper, a former Foreign Office diplomat who 
has also worked for the EU, welcomed Sir Tim Barrow’s appointment. Asked about 
him, Cooper said:

He’s honest, he’s tough, he’s someone how knows Europe very well, although not 
so much the community part. He’s done lots of foreign policy in Europe ... At 
least we’ve got somebody, he may not know all the technical stuff, but he knows 
how Europe works in terms of dealing with people.

But Cooper also said that diplomats were currently hampered by a lack of 
direction over Brexit.

I think at the moment there is a policy vacuum. It’s not surprising. This is a 
gigantic enterprise that’s been taken on and needs a lot of thought. I think at 
the moment probably the atmosphere is difficult because people don’t know where 
they are going. You need to have a sense of direction.
 
Lord Livingston, the former chief executive of BT and a trade minister in 
David Cameron’s government, was on the Today programme talking about Brexit. He 
said that negotiating a trade deal with the EU would take time.

First of all of course we have to actually sort out what’s broadly going to be 
our relationship with the EU. Are we going to be in the single market? Probably 
not. Are we going to be in the customs union?

Then you can turn your attention to other countries but the trade deal for 
instance with Canada still isn’t fully implemented and that’s about seven years 
on.

You can do quick trade deals, you can do good trade deals, you can do 
wide-ranging trade deals - you just can’t do all three of them at the same time.

Theresa May and her ministers are currently saying that they think Britain 
should be able to negotiate new trade arrangements with the EU within the 
two-year exit process. But many people are saying that is unrealistic andthe 
European commission has indicated that it wants to negotiate Britain’s 
withdrawal from the EU first, before going on to then negotiate a new trade 
deal afterwards.

Yesterday Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> acted 
swiftly to fill the vacancy created by the surprise resignation of Britain’s 
ambassador to the EU. Here’s the Guardian’s version of the story.

Sir Tim Barrow appointed as Britain's EU ambassador

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/sir-tim-barrow-appointed-as-britains-eu-ambassador>
And here is how it starts.

Theresa May has moved swiftly to calm tensions over the resignation of Sir 
Ivan Rogers as Britain’s ambassador to the EU by appointing career diplomatSir 
Tim Barrow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/sir-tim-barrow-profile-he-will-report-back-reliably-on-eu-thinking>
 as his replacement.

The decision means the prime minister has ignored calls to appoint a 
wholehearted Brexiter, in a move that will reassure those in the civil service 
who feared the role would be politicised.

Of course, one of the glories of the British press is that readers never had 
to make do with just one version of reality.Their story on this 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4090310/Theresa-crushes-Brexit-dissenters-appointing-new-EU-ambassador-faced-Putin-blocked-Eurocrat-plans-EU-army.html>
 has a headline in the paper saying “Theresa crushes Brexit dissenters” and it 
says May “quashed a civil service revolt over her Brexit strategy by appointing 
a senior diplomat who faced down the Russians to be the UK’s new man in 
Brussels”. The Mail, of course, is very much in favour of May, but not “Brexit 
dissenters”.

There is quite a lot of reaction around to Barrow’s appointment this morning 
and I will be covering it here. On the Today programmeLord Marland, a former 
trade envoy to David Cameron who now chairs the Commonwealth Enterprise and 
Investment Council, said he did not think Whitehall had the skill set to 
conduct a successful Brexit negotiation. He told the programme:

My fear is that Whitehall as a whole has really not got the skill set to 
deliver a really hard-nosed negotiation and I think we have really got to up 
skill in that area to do it.

There is only one item in the diary for today.


10.30am: Chuka Umunna launches the report from the all-party group on social 
integration. As my colleague Anushka Asthana reports, it proposes a regional 
immigration policy after Brexit under which some parts of Britain would be able 
to clamp down on the numbers of foreign workers while others could maintain an 
open-door policy.
