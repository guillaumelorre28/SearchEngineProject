When we picture coastlines protected by the National Trust, we probably 
imagine justly celebrated beauty spots – Robin Hood’s Bay in North Yorkshire, 
the chalk ramparts of the Seven Sisters in East Sussex, or Golden Cap in 
Dorset. But not every section of the 742 miles of seashore in England, Wales 
and Northern Ireland guarded by the National Trust (Scotland has its own 
conservation charity <http://www.nts.org.uk/Home/>) is busy or stereotypically 
striking. I’ve been fortunate enough to travel many of those miles while 
researching a book about our relationship with the coast, and I discovered many 
less-heralded beaches, cliffs and estuaries. Parts of the coast that I assumed 
I already knew well also surprised me. These are some of my new favourite 
places: beautiful, often quiet, occasionally bleak and constantly offering 
unexpected delights.

Most visitors to Northern Ireland take the road north from Belfast to the 
Giant’s Causeway. Turn south-east, however, and the road leads to Strangford 
Lough, Britain’s largest sea lake. A shallow silver mirror of water, the lough 
deepens to the south around an array of tiny round islands, part of a drowned 
drumlin field created during the ice age. Strangford sees few tourists – by the 
glittering waters of Kircubbin there’s a wooden shed that would be an upmarket 
fish shack in Cornwall but here is the Harbour View Car Wash – and so the area 
is tranquil and lovely. It is also paradise for kayaking and canoeing: there is 
a canoe trail around the lough and visitors can camp on Salt Island (canoeni.com
 <http://www.canoeni.com/canoe-trails/strangford-lough/>).

One of the most beautiful beaches in the UK, White Park Bay is now a 
well-known part of Northern Ireland’s coast, yet it is possible to enjoy it in 
peace. It is only a short way east of the Giant’s Causeway, but when I visited 
(in March) it was empty apart from a herd of cattle which had wandered on to 
its glorious white sand. I also enjoyed time alone with the buzzards soaring 
above the rocky cliffs at Fair Head and Murlough Bay (not to be confused with 
Murlough Dunes to the south). The 33-mileCauseway Coast Way 
<http://www.walkni.com/destinations/north-coast-and-antrim> reveals the full 
glories of a coastline which is a match for Cornwall or Pembrokeshire.

Where to stay
The Causeway Hotel <http://www.thecausewayhotel.com/> (doubles from £99

 Hawker’s Hut. Photograph: Alamy 
More than a third of the Cornish coast is protected by the National Trust and 
it is easy to find amazing views, obscure coves and fascinating human histories 
along much of it. There is still plenty of silence, and surprises, on the 
westerly peninsula of Penwith. But the quietest part of the Cornish coast is 
its far north, which also boasts the most strenuous section of theSouth West 
Coast Path <http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/walksdb/145/>. The parish of 
Morwenstow is famed as the home of eccentric Victorian vicar and poet Robert 
Hawker, who made great play of its isolation. (He would receive his copy of the 
Times newspaper three days after it had been published.)On the cliffs, 
signposted from the coast path, is a hut he built 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/article-1356403784588/> out of the timbers of 
wrecked ships, a shrine to the solace he found on this wild, rocky coast.

Where to stay
Robert Hawker’s Old Vicarage <http://rshawker.co.uk/> in Morwenstow is a 
beautiful building and a well-regarded B&B with a self-catering cottage as well 
(B&B £48pp pn, minimum two nights; cottage sleeps 5/6, from £402 a week).

The coast of Durham is probably one of the least-visited in the country. The 
great coal mines that once defined this region 
<http://www.changingcoast.org.uk/local-history/>were still dumping mine 
tailings and waste on the beaches as recently as the 1980s. The last mine 
closed in 1993, leaving a horribly polluted coast. But nature often repairs our 
destructiveness more quickly than we might expect and only a fraction of the 
pollution remains, colouring beach stones an eerie sulphurous yellow. What’s 
left are grand, deserted beaches and a coast path over magnesian limestone 
meadows filled with wild flowers in summer, and into secretive denes – steep 
little valleys. The North Sea can never be turquoise but it can be a surprising 
cobalt blue. East Durham’s economy is still struggling but locals say fish, 
shellfish and seaweed are back in abundance on their once coal-wrecked beaches.

Where to stay
Former colliery towns such as Easington and Horden are not (yet) set up for 
tourism but overlooking the coast just outside the town of Seaham, is a 
five-star boutique hotel,Seaham Hall <http://www.seaham-hall.co.uk/> (doubles 
from £175 B&B,), where Lord Byron got married in 1815. There’s also plenty of 
accommodation in nearby Durham city.

 Plas Newydd stately home. Photograph: Alamy 
Wales’s largest island (Ynys Môn in Welsh) has an intimate and interesting 
coastline. “The Menai Strait is one of the most beautiful stretches of water to 
be found around the coast of Britain,” declared the Welsh painter Kyffin 
Williams, who admired the shimmering shoals of mackerel when he lived by the 
channel that turns Anglesey into an island. By the strait is the romantic 
stately home ofPlas Newydd 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/plas-newydd-house-and-gardens/> with a mural 
by lovelorn artist Rex Whistler. The north coast has tiny coves and wild 
cliffs, particularly east of Cemlyn Bay, where the nuclear power station isn’t 
as much of a blot on the landscape as might be assumed.

Where to stay
There are plenty of old-school camping options at discoveranglesey.com/sleep 
<http://discoveranglesey.com/caravanscamping2>, or try a glamping lodge at 
Wonderfully Wild <http://www.wonderfullywild.co.uk/> near Beaumaris (sleeps 6,

The long, low coast of Essex is more overlooked than most shores, despite a 
wealth of islands. Northey, a triangular-shaped 300 hectares in the Blackwater 
estuary, is the oldest official battle site in Britain (a Saxon earl, 
Byrhtnoth, lost his head to 3,000 Vikings here) and also the site of Britain’s 
first “managed retreat”: in 1991 its sea-banks were breached to allow the sea 
on to former farmland as part of a policy of living with rather than fighting 
coastal change. Today it’s a place of geese, wide skies and salt marsh. You can 
walk to Northey at low tide from the town of Maldon, but check tides and call 
the National Trust office (01621 853142) for permission first. Further north,
Ray Island is another nature reserve 
<http://www.essexwt.org.uk/reserves/ray-island-bonners-saltings> with literary 
links.

Where to stay
It is possible to rent a privately owned holiday home 
<http://www.northeyisland.co.uk/house.htm> here and (almost) have the island to 
yourself (sleeps 10, from £208 a night).

For most of the last century, access to the shingle spit of Orford Ness was 
prohibited under the Official Secrets Act. This inaccessible “almost island” as 
Robert Macfarlane calls it, was an experimental military site, testing 
everything from the production of artificial clouds to triggers on atomic 
weapons. Today these concrete cold war laboratories lie ruined on the 
shoreline, a malevolent symbol of the destructiveness of the 20th century. 
Orford Ness also happens to be the largest vegetated shingle spit in Europe and 
its dry shingle is home to rare plants and seabirds. While most National Trust 
coastline is open to the public, the public can visit the spit only on 
Saturdays from April to June, and Tuesday to Saturday from July to September – 
because of ground-nesting birds, as well as hazardous waste and unexploded 
bombs. Visitors must book a boat crossing from Orford quay and stick to the 
footpaths.

Where to stay
National Trust volunteers engaged in conservation work are occasionally 
allowed to stay on the island. The attractive town of Orford has good 
accommodation, includingthe Wash House Studio B&B 
<http://www.orfordwashhouse.co.uk/> (doubles £95 B&B)and the Crown and the 
Castle <http://crownandcastle.co.uk/> (doubles from £135 B&B, £205 half-board

Fan Bay Deep Shelter, the White Cliffs of Dover, Kent 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/white-cliffs-dover/>

The White Cliffs seem so culturally familiar – Vera Lynn, cross-channel 
ferries and all – that I wasn’t terribly excited about visiting them. But that 
was before I discovered their secrets. Stroll east from the Langdon Cliffs 
visitor centre, and you’ll find a tiny hole in the ground, hidden in shrubbery. 
This summer,Fan Bay Deep Shelter <https://fanbayshelternt.wordpress.com/about/> 
is being opened to the public for the first time: it is a maze of subterranean 
tunnels where up to 180 soldiers sheltered during the second world war, and 
experimental sound mirrors were placed on the cliffs.It is a damp, atmospheric 
place, a portal into our recent history.

To all but lovers of bracing solitude, an uninhabited tidal island of tawny 
sand dunes and a maze of salt marsh doesn’t sound terribly thrilling.Yet Scolt 
is a magical place 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/03/do-we-like-to-be-beside-the-seaside>
: deeply tranquil and one of the wildest spots in southern Britain. The western 
end of the island is one of Norfolk’s best tern colonies, and these 
chalk-winged birds fish by diving into the clean waters off the island. It is a 
difficult place to visit: there are some guided tours and it is possible to 
walk to the island from Burnham Deepdale at low tide. But you need a tide table 
and must check with locals about tide sizes – there is no surefire rule about a 
safe time to cross, no toilets and no refreshments. Try to avoid the nesting 
season (May-July) because the deserted beach is one of the best sites for the 
timid, ground-nesting ringed plover.

Where to stay
Deepdale Farm <http://www.deepdalefarm.co.uk/glamping/> offers glamping in 
yurts, tipis and shepherd huts (from around £30 a night for two, more for 
groups) as well as camping.
