Campsites with food vans

Gwithian Farm, Hayle, Cornwall 
Visiting street food vans have become a regular feature at this feted seaside 
campsite. This year’s line-up includes Mexican street food, wood-fired-pizzas, 
curry, daily hot croissant delivery and “proper” fish and chips. Godrevy Beach 
Cafe, one of Cornwall’s best, lies on the way to the surf.
• £15-£30 for two people, £5 extra adult, £2 extra child. Open 
April-September, 01736 753127,gwithianfarm.co.uk <http://gwithianfarm.co.uk/> 

Thetford Forest Camping and Caravanning Club Site, Norfolk
Local pig and sheep farmers Geoff and Kate run the excellent burger van that 
visits this site on the edge of Thetford’s pine forest. Their flavour combos 
include pork and chilli and Moroccan lamb and mint. Kate delivers fresh eggs, 
bacon and sausages throughout the week, but it’s Saturdays that are not to be 
missed. Geoff returns with a hog roast: big floury buns stuffed with pork and 
crackling. Dessert is sorted too: campers can help themselves from the cherry, 
apple and plum trees.
• From £7.70 to £12.95pp, under-6s free. Open all year, 01953 498455,

Wapsbourne Manor Farm, Uckfield, East Sussex 
A van selling wood-fired pizza greets the frazzled Friday arrivals at this 
popular field and woodland site. Homemade soup with rustic bread is served free 
on Saturday evenings around the communal fire – and a “sing for your soup” 
scheme offers acoustic musicians one night’s free camping in return for an hour 
of music. Sunday morning is coffee and crepe time, and come the evening, the 
paella van arrives, and so it goes on ... Campfire cooking is easy here, too, 
as grills are supplied and the on-site farm shop sells local meats, cheese, 
veggies, ales and, crucially, gin.
• From £10 adults, £5 children, £5 cars (two-night minimum stay weekends).

Campsites with a cafe

Red Bank Farm, Bolton-le-Sands, Morecambe Bay, Lancashire 


With views across Morecambe Bay, Archers, the campsite’s cafe, is the perfect 
spot to enjoy the revered local delicacy, potted shrimps on hot buttered toast. 
Local saltmarsh lamb burgers are made from the farm’s own flock, and chickens 
strutting past the tents provide eggs for big slabs of homemade cake.
• £7 adults, £3 children. Open Easter to October. Archers Cafe open 
9.30am-3pm, closed Mondays. 01524 823196,redbankfarm.co.uk

Guests pitch where they like among the grass-covered dunes then run down on to 
the white sand beach to swim in turquoise waters, with views of the Isle of 
Skye. This is wild camping, but with amenities, thanks to the grass-roofed Barn 
Cafe, which has haddock and chips and vegetable teriyaki on its dinner menu 
(mains £8.95-£18.95).
• Pitches for two plus car or caravan £15.50-£18, wigwams from £34. Open April

A glorious campfire, tent, shepherd hut, bats and badgers kind of place, a 
short cycle ride away from two of the best surfing beaches in Cornwall. The 
beach hut-style cafe is a social hub on sunny days, offering bacon butties, 
pasties and cream teas. As on all good camping trips, wine o’clock comes early 
here. The cafe is licensed – hurrah! – and there’s often a jug of owner Leah’s 
latest cocktail in the fridge. Homemade fruit ice-lollies too.
• From £10-£15 for two adults, £5 children, under-5s free, £25 families. Open

The woodland Beech Cafe has a menu that reflects the campsite’s 
environmentally-friendly ethos: Fairtrade, local, sustainable, seasonal and 
vegetarian. Its generously portioned curries, soups and ploughmans taste 
fantastic too. Campers can hire a tipi or tuck their tent away in a secluded 
glade. Communal fire pits, solar showers and compost loos complete the 
at-one-with-nature vibe.

The smell of freshly baked bread, croissants and buns wafting from the on-site 
bakery wakes campers at Llethyr, on the wildly beautiful Pembrokeshire coast. 
Children will love the farm’s miniature cows and kune kune pigs, while 
grown-ups will like the licensed shop selling local produce. There is a rota of 
fabulous food vans visiting in the evenings, or watch the sunset with a beer 
and one of the bakery’s wood-fired pizzas.

With Hadrian’s Wall and a great stargazing area with International Dark Sky 
Park status on the doorstep, this site is tops. It has also won pretty much 
every accolade possible in the camping world, including best loos. One should 
recognise its Pizza to your Pitch service. Owner Steve Dunwell says: “We 
understand the stress of arriving at a site after a long journey, children 
ragged with hunger and you still have to get your tent up. So now, when folk 
arrive, they order a pizza and we bring it to their pitch.” Happy campers all 
round.

pheasant that can be delivered to pitches on arrival. And baskets of raw 
ingredients can be provided for those who want to cook their own dinner over 
the communal fire.
