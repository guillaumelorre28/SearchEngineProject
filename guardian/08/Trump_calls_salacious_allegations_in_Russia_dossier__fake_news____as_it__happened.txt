Tillerson wants seat 'at that table' for climate talks

Rex Tillerson <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rex-tillerson>, the 
secretary of state nominee, has said the United States is “better served by 
being at that table” of climate change talks “than leaving that table.”

Here’s the exchange:

Senator Tom Udall: In your capacity as CEO of Exxon Mobile, you praised the 
Paris agreement, noting that addressing climate change, I quote “requires broad 
based practical solutions around the world”. Do you personally believe that the 
overall national interests of the United States are better served by staying in 
the Paris agreement if so why, and if not, why not?
Tillerson: “...I think having a seat at the table to address this issue on a 
global basis, it is important. It’s I think, 190 countries or thereabouts have 
signed on to begin to take action. I think we’re better served by being at that 
table than leaving that table.

Explainer: what is in the Trump-Russia dossier John McCain passed to the FBI?

Luke Harding

The big picture

What does the dossier which John McCain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/johnmccain> passed to FBI chief James 
Comey say?


It says Vladimir Putin’s Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> has 
been “cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for at least five years”. 
Moscow’s aim is “to encourage splits and divisions in the western alliance” and 
to upend the “ideals-based international order” set up after the second world 
war. Putin’s preference, according to the report, is for a return to the “Great 
Power” politics of the 19th century, where big states pursue their own 
interests.

The dossier says that Trump was offered “various sweetener business deals” by 
the Kremlin, but turned them down. The Kremlin also supplied Trump with “a 
regular flow of intelligence”, including on the Democrats and other political 
rivals.

Russian spies put together compromising dossiers on both Clinton and Trump, 
the dossier says. The Clinton one was innocuous and mostly included bugged 
conversations.

The Trump material, by contrast, was explosive. It includes lurid details from 
Trump’s visit in 2013 Moscow for the Miss Universe beauty pageant. According to 
the dossier, Trump stayed in the Ritz Carlton hotel, in the same suite used by 
Barack Obama. It says Russia’s FSB spy agency obtained compromising sexual 
material –kompromat – from the hotel suite. “FSB has compromised TRUMP through 
his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to blackmail him,” it says.

Is it true?


No one could quibble with the report’s section on geopolitics. It’s 
undoubtedly true that Putin has sought to weaken western institutions and the 
transatlantic alliance, plus the EU. Over the past 16 years he has sought to 
re-establishRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> as an 
indispensable global player, and to challenge what Moscow sees as unfair US 
hegemony.

The sex claims about Trump are ultimately unknowable and what happened inside 
the Ritz Carlton is a matter of speculation. Trump dismissed the report in its 
entirety at his press conference on Wednesday as “fake news”...

At the Tillerson hearing, meanwhile, the secretary of state nominee does not 
tie a US commitment to Nato allies to membership dues, as Trump has.
Rebecca Berg (@rebeccagberg) 
Tillerson just broke with Trump on NATO — said he thinks Article 5 is binding 
and he would not advise breaking it if allies don't pay dues

New Jersey senator Cory Booker is testifying against Alabama senator Jeff 
Sessions in Sessions’ attorney general confirmation hearings. It’s unusual – 
precedents don’t readily come to mind – for a senator to testify against a

Booker says Sessions hasn’t shown he’s committed to equal rights:

The story of the Trump dossier: secret sources, an airport rendezvous, and 
John McCain

Julian Borger

The extraordinary but unverified documents 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/10/fbi-chief-given-dossier-by-john-mccain-alleging-secret-trump-russia-contacts>
 published on Tuesday on Donald Trump’s ties with Moscow began life as a piece 
of opposition research, which has become as much a part of US politics as yard 
signs and coloured balloons.


There is a small industry of research and investigative firms in Washington, 
typically staffed by a mix of former journalists and security officials, adept 
at finding information about politicians that the politicians would rather stay 
hidden. The firms often do not know who exactly is hiring them; the request 
could come from a law firm acting on behalf of a client from one of the parties.

In this case, the request for opposition research on Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> came from one of his 
Republican opponents in the primary campaign. The research firm then hired one 
of its sub-contractors who it used regularly on all things Russian: a retired 
western European former counter-intelligence official, with a long history of 
dealing with the shadow world of Moscow’s spooks andsiloviki (securocrats).

Rex Tillerson <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rex-tillerson>, the 
secretary of state nominee, has said the United States is “better served by 
being at that table” of climate change talks “than leaving that table.”

Here’s the exchange:

Senator Tom Udall: In your capacity as CEO of Exxon Mobile, you praised the 
Paris agreement, noting that addressing climate change, I quote “requires broad 
based practical solutions around the world”. Do you personally believe that the 
overall national interests of the United States are better served by staying in 
the Paris agreement if so why, and if not, why not?
Tillerson: “...I think having a seat at the table to address this issue on a 
global basis, it is important. It’s I think, 190 countries or thereabouts have 
signed on to begin to take action. I think we’re better served by being at that 
table than leaving that table.

The big picture

What does the dossier which John McCain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/johnmccain> passed to FBI chief James 
Comey say?


It says Vladimir Putin’s Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> has 
been “cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for at least five years”. 
Moscow’s aim is “to encourage splits and divisions in the western alliance” and 
to upend the “ideals-based international order” set up after the second world 
war. Putin’s preference, according to the report, is for a return to the “Great 
Power” politics of the 19th century, where big states pursue their own 
interests.

The dossier says that Trump was offered “various sweetener business deals” by 
the Kremlin, but turned them down. The Kremlin also supplied Trump with “a 
regular flow of intelligence”, including on the Democrats and other political 
rivals.

Russian spies put together compromising dossiers on both Clinton and Trump, 
the dossier says. The Clinton one was innocuous and mostly included bugged 
conversations.

The Trump material, by contrast, was explosive. It includes lurid details from 
Trump’s visit in 2013 Moscow for the Miss Universe beauty pageant. According to 
the dossier, Trump stayed in the Ritz Carlton hotel, in the same suite used by 
Barack Obama. It says Russia’s FSB spy agency obtained compromising sexual 
material –kompromat – from the hotel suite. “FSB has compromised TRUMP through 
his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to blackmail him,” it says.

Is it true?


No one could quibble with the report’s section on geopolitics. It’s 
undoubtedly true that Putin has sought to weaken western institutions and the 
transatlantic alliance, plus the EU. Over the past 16 years he has sought to 
re-establishRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> as an 
indispensable global player, and to challenge what Moscow sees as unfair US 
hegemony.

The sex claims about Trump are ultimately unknowable and what happened inside 
the Ritz Carlton is a matter of speculation. Trump dismissed the report in its 
entirety at his press conference on Wednesday as “fake news”...
