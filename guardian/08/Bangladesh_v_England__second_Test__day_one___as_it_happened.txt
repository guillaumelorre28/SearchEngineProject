Thoughts from Tom van der Gucht: “I remember the 2004-5 England side had, what 
I think Fletcher described as, “Bounce-back-ability” and you’d generally back 
them to return from seemingly buried positions based on a few inspired 
performances from key players such as Trescothick, Strauss, Flintoff, Harmy, 
Hoggy, Jones, KP, Giles, in fact pretty much everyone at one point or other 
pulled the team back from the brink and out of the mire at one point or 
other.Is this team too starting to develop that knack? Or are Bangladesh, 
statistically the weakest test team of all time, just flaky after 15 months out 
of test cricket and England have been a bit flukey? Then again, you’ve got to 
take your chances and all that...”

Day one, stumps: England 50-3, trail Bangladesh by 170 runs

And that’s your lot for the day. The rain has ended our fun for now: England 
will resume tomorrow and relying on Root and Ali to dig them out of a hole. 
Still, quite a day, in which they took nine wickets for 49 runs.

Rain!

12.3 overs: England 50-3 (Root 15, Ali 2) As has looked likely for a while, 
the rain has arrived and the batsmen are off in short order. It doesn’t look 
that hard but you’d imagine that’s it for the day.

12th over: England 50-3 (Root 15, Ali 2) Joe Root is good at cricket. He leans 
back and strokes a beauty of a back-foot push perfectly between long-off and 
the cover sweeper, collecting four. Although he then badly misjudges the length 
of another from Shakib, going back where forwards looked like the bet, and just 
avoids feathering one to the keeper. Another two runs come with some sharp 
running after a shot to mid-wicket.

Alex Henshaw’s been running the numbers: “Gary Ballance’s last 20 innings for 
England - 9,9,1,17,8,28,70,23,43,6,14,23,0,61,6,29,0,1,23, 18”

 Not, it must be said, ideal.

11th over: England 44-3 (Root 9, Ali 2) Mo got England out of a bit of a hole 
with the ball, and now needs to do the same with the bat. He gets off the mark 
with a couple via a thick outside edge, then carefully plays out the rest of 
the over.

WICKET! Ballance c Rahim b Mehedi 9 - England 42-3

Lovely piece of bowling from Mehedi. Ballance lunges forwards, looks like he 
regrets the decision about halfway through the shot, and gets a thin edge 
through to Rahim. In fairness, not a massive amount he did wrong there - an 
excellent delivery.

9th over: England 42-2 (Root 9, Ballance 9) Root strides forward and gets a 
single. Then Ballance goes back, tries a cut, completely misses, it deflects 
off his knee and they get two leg-byes. Some chirp around the bat, too. Lovely 
bit of business.

8th over: England 39-2 (Root 8, Ballance 9) Root goes back to a couple he 
might not have gone back to, and gets a single. Ballance then confidently comes 
down the track and middles a straight drive, denied four runs only by the 
stumps at the non-striker’s.

7th over: England 36-2 (Root 6, Ballance 8) That’s better from Ballance - he 
rocks back and punches one through the leg side off the back foot, and as 
Mehedi tries to adjust his length he goes too far, serving up a shin-high 
full-toss that is sent to around the same spot as the previous one. Mehedi 
comes back well though, beating the outside edge a couple of times, most 
notably with a peach from the last ball that turns past the bat.

6th over: England 28-2 (Root 6, Ballance 0) Wonderful shot from Root - the 
ball is shortish but not a long-hop, and he has the skill to perfectly guide 
the cut behind and past point, to the boundary. No more runs from the over. 
Shakib twirls his hat around his finger.

W00000. Whenever I see an over like that, can't help thinking about Shane

5th over: England 24-2 (Root 2, Ballance 0) Ballance, as has been his way for 
about a year, plays out the over in rather unconvincing fashion.

“England have become your standard Saturday cricket team,” notes Joe Hancock. 
“Three or four players who score all the runs and get all the wickets and the 
rest just field and eat the food at tea.” As long as they pay their subs...

WICKET! Cook lbw Mehedi 14 - England 24-2

Cook is forced back and the ball thunks into his pads: Dharmasena says no to 
the appeal, Rahim takes an age to refer but it’s a good job he does, as it was 
rattling leg stump. Helluva day.

3rd over: England 24-1 (Cook 14, Root 2) Root picks up another single with a 
rather more deliberate shot, then Mehedi drops short and Cook welts a four off 
the back foot, past cover. He then gets another four with an exceptional shot, 
the ball not quite as short but on a similar line, but he whips it in front of 
mid-wicket to the fence. A third four comes, but on the opposite end of the 
convincing scale: this one an uncertain push outside off, that comes off an 
thick outside edge and splits slip and gully. 13 runs from the over.

2nd over: England 11-1 (Cook 2, Root 1) Root gets off the mark first ball, but 
only just - he goes right back to one and gets away with an inside edge just 
backward of square. Quite an over.

WICKET! Duckett c Rahim b Shakib 7 - England 10-1

Shakib is on from the other end, and initially Duckett decides that messing 
around will not do, running down the strip and hammering a six over long-on. A 
bye brings Cook to the strike, he pushes a single through mid-wicket but then 
Duckett plays a much less forthright stroke, uncertainly trying to turn the 
ball past leg slip but only gets an edge through to Rahim.

1st over: England 2-0 (Cook 1, Duckett 1) The first two balls are shortish and 
outside offish, and both are circumspectly cut for singles. Then Mehedi bowls 
the jaffa’s jaffa, ripping past Cook’s outside edge and missing it by a hair. 
The Bangladeshis appeal, but in an unusual turn of events, Dharmasena gets the 
decision correct by turning them down.

And in short order, 13 cricketers are back out for England’s innings. Alastair 
Cook and Ben Ducket to open for England, and it’s spin with the new ball for 
the hosts, Mehedi Hasan getting things started from around the wicket.

Bangladesh all out 220

What a collapse! At about 50 minutes into the afternoon session, Bangladesh 
were 171-1 and going along very nicely indeed, but 22 overs, nine wickets and 
just 49 runs later they’re preparing to field. England have bowled well and 
fielded superbly, catches by Cook and Root close in to the spinners 
particularly special, but a good few of those wickets were rather generously 
handed over.

WICKET! Kamrul c Root b Ali 0

Ali serves up his first ropey delivery in ages, and Taijul uses his bare bat 
to swipe a full-toss in front of mid-wicket for four. Another run comes in less 
convincing/intentional fashion via an inside edge, before Kamrul idly shoves at 
one that goes straight, edges and Root takes a superb catch diving to his left. 
A five-fer for Mo.

62nd over: Bangladesh 215-9 (Taijul 0, Kamrul 0) Taijul, with an aesthetically 
pleasing stickerless bat, plays out a maiden, hitting a few, missing a few. 
Which frankly puts him up on some of his colleagues. The lights are on now, by 
the way - glum out there.

WICKET! Shakib c Bairstow b Woakes 10 - Bangladesh 215-9

Shakib has been largely standing at one end watching, as the great man Tony 
Greig would have it, ‘cornage’ at the other end. And now he gets in on the fun, 
feathering an edge from a widish Woakes ball and Bairstow pouches another.

60th over: Bangladesh 213-8 (Shakib 8, Taijul 0) “Great leveller eh, the game 
of cricket?” writes Krishnan Patel. “The England captain tying the shoelaces of 
an 18 year old kid. A PhD Ansari looking clueless.” Not quite a PhD (yet), but 
the general point taken. New bat Taijul Islam plays out the rest of the over, 
but not in great comfort.

WICKET! Mehedi lbw b Ali 1 - Bangladesh 213-8

Mehedi requires a hand from Cook to tie his laces, and then we can begin. 
Mehedi goes for a big sweep, misses and is thunked on the pad. Umpire 
Dharmasena says no, but they go upstairs. There’s no edge, so the big question 
is whether it pitched outside leg....and it didn’t! It’s going to hit middle 
and leg, and once more Dharmasena is corrected by his pal with the gadgets.
 England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow appeals for LBW. The umpire upstairs 
agreed and Mehedi Hasan Miraz is heading back to the pavilion. Photograph: A.M.

WICKET! Shuvagata c Bairstow b Woakes 6 - Bangladesh 212-7

Another shonky shot gives up a wicket, as Shuvagata tries to flay a wide 
half-volley with minimal footwork, but can only succeed in feathering one - 
perhaps off the toe of his bat - through to Bairstow, who takes a good low 
catch to his right.

58th over: Bangladesh 211-6 (Shakib 7, Shuvagata 6) More Mo, and he gets some 
good tweak. Shuvagata whips one off his knees that hits the short-leg, 
Ballance, on the thigh and briefly pops up, but he can’t take the rebound. 
Technically a chance, but you’d have to be the most sadistic gym teacher to rip 
him for that one. The next ball is more emphatic though, as Shuvagata belts a 
cover drive to the boundary - a little airy, but a fine shot.

Another enthralling day of Test cricket in Bangladesh. But think India would 
have enjoyed it more than anyone else
 <https://twitter.com/timwig_cricket/status/791957331772788736> October 28, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/timwig_cricket/status/791957331772788736>  
Thoughts from Tom van der Gucht: “I remember the 2004-5 England side had, what 
I think Fletcher described as, “Bounce-back-ability” and you’d generally back 
them to return from seemingly buried positions based on a few inspired 
performances from key players such as Trescothick, Strauss, Flintoff, Harmy, 
Hoggy, Jones, KP, Giles, in fact pretty much everyone at one point or other 
pulled the team back from the brink and out of the mire at one point or 
other.Is this team too starting to develop that knack? Or are Bangladesh, 
statistically the weakest test team of all time, just flaky after 15 months out 
of test cricket and England have been a bit flukey? Then again, you’ve got to 
take your chances and all that...”
 
And that’s your lot for the day. The rain has ended our fun for now: England 
will resume tomorrow and relying on Root and Ali to dig them out of a hole. 
Still, quite a day, in which they took nine wickets for 49 runs.
 
Raining hard now. Make plans.

12.3 overs: England 50-3 (Root 15, Ali 2) As has looked likely for a while, 
the rain has arrived and the batsmen are off in short order. It doesn’t look 
that hard but you’d imagine that’s it for the day.
 
12th over: England 50-3 (Root 15, Ali 2) Joe Root is good at cricket. He leans 
back and strokes a beauty of a back-foot push perfectly between long-off and 
the cover sweeper, collecting four. Although he then badly misjudges the length 
of another from Shakib, going back where forwards looked like the bet, and just 
avoids feathering one to the keeper. Another two runs come with some sharp 
running after a shot to mid-wicket.

Alex Henshaw’s been running the numbers: “Gary Ballance’s last 20 innings for 
England - 9,9,1,17,8,28,70,23,43,6,14,23,0,61,6,29,0,1,23, 18”

 Not, it must be said, ideal. 

 
11th over: England 44-3 (Root 9, Ali 2) Mo got England out of a bit of a hole 
with the ball, and now needs to do the same with the bat. He gets off the mark 
with a couple via a thick outside edge, then carefully plays out the rest of 
the over.
 
Lovely piece of bowling from Mehedi. Ballance lunges forwards, looks like he 
regrets the decision about halfway through the shot, and gets a thin edge 
through to Rahim. In fairness, not a massive amount he did wrong there - an 
excellent delivery.

10th over: England 42-2 (Root 9, Ballance 9) A rare thing for this day - an 
uneventful over, as Root plays out a maiden.
 
9th over: England 42-2 (Root 9, Ballance 9) Root strides forward and gets a 
single. Then Ballance goes back, tries a cut, completely misses, it deflects 
off his knee and they get two leg-byes. Some chirp around the bat, too. Lovely 
bit of business.
 
8th over: England 39-2 (Root 8, Ballance 9) Root goes back to a couple he 
might not have gone back to, and gets a single. Ballance then confidently comes 
down the track and middles a straight drive, denied four runs only by the 
stumps at the non-striker’s.
 
7th over: England 36-2 (Root 6, Ballance 8) That’s better from Ballance - he 
rocks back and punches one through the leg side off the back foot, and as 
Mehedi tries to adjust his length he goes too far, serving up a shin-high 
full-toss that is sent to around the same spot as the previous one. Mehedi 
comes back well though, beating the outside edge a couple of times, most 
notably with a peach from the last ball that turns past the bat.
 
6th over: England 28-2 (Root 6, Ballance 0) Wonderful shot from Root - the 
ball is shortish but not a long-hop, and he has the skill to perfectly guide 
the cut behind and past point, to the boundary. No more runs from the over. 
Shakib twirls his hat around his finger.

W00000. Whenever I see an over like that, can't help thinking about Shane 
Watson in Lumley Castle

5th over: England 24-2 (Root 2, Ballance 0) Ballance, as has been his way for 
about a year, plays out the over in rather unconvincing fashion.

“England have become your standard Saturday cricket team,” notes Joe Hancock. 
“Three or four players who score all the runs and get all the wickets and the 
rest just field and eat the food at tea.” As long as they pay their subs...
 
Cook is forced back and the ball thunks into his pads: Dharmasena says no to 
the appeal, Rahim takes an age to refer but it’s a good job he does, as it was 
rattling leg stump. Helluva day.

4th over: England 24-1 (Cook 14, Root 2) Root spends the over trying to figure 
out how to get Shakib off the squre, but doesn’t manage it and that’s a maiden.

3rd over: England 24-1 (Cook 14, Root 2) Root picks up another single with a 
rather more deliberate shot, then Mehedi drops short and Cook welts a four off 
the back foot, past cover. He then gets another four with an exceptional shot, 
the ball not quite as short but on a similar line, but he whips it in front of 
mid-wicket to the fence. A third four comes, but on the opposite end of the 
convincing scale: this one an uncertain push outside off, that comes off an 
thick outside edge and splits slip and gully. 13 runs from the over.
 
2nd over: England 11-1 (Cook 2, Root 1) Root gets off the mark first ball, but 
only just - he goes right back to one and gets away with an inside edge just 
backward of square. Quite an over.
 
Shakib is on from the other end, and initially Duckett decides that messing 
around will not do, running down the strip and hammering a six over long-on. A 
bye brings Cook to the strike, he pushes a single through mid-wicket but then 
Duckett plays a much less forthright stroke, uncertainly trying to turn the 
ball past leg slip but only gets an edge through to Rahim.

1st over: England 2-0 (Cook 1, Duckett 1) The first two balls are shortish and 
outside offish, and both are circumspectly cut for singles. Then Mehedi bowls 
the jaffa’s jaffa, ripping past Cook’s outside edge and missing it by a hair. 
The Bangladeshis appeal, but in an unusual turn of events, Dharmasena gets the 
decision correct by turning them down.
 
And in short order, 13 cricketers are back out for England’s innings. Alastair 
Cook and Ben Ducket to open for England, and it’s spin with the new ball for 
the hosts, Mehedi Hasan getting things started from around the wicket.
 
“All-rounders, eh,” writes Gareth Fitzgerald. “That scorecard suggests we 
should just pack the side with them. Seriously though, all wickets taken by 5,6 
and 8.”
 
What a collapse! At about 50 minutes into the afternoon session, Bangladesh 
were 171-1 and going along very nicely indeed, but 22 overs, nine wickets and 
just 49 runs later they’re preparing to field. England have bowled well and 
fielded superbly, catches by Cook and Root close in to the spinners 
particularly special, but a good few of those wickets were rather generously 
handed over.

Ali serves up his first ropey delivery in ages, and Taijul uses his bare bat 
to swipe a full-toss in front of mid-wicket for four. Another run comes in less 
convincing/intentional fashion via an inside edge, before Kamrul idly shoves at 
one that goes straight, edges and Root takes a superb catch diving to his left. 
A five-fer for Mo.

barely lays a bat on a Woakes over.

62nd over: Bangladesh 215-9 (Taijul 0, Kamrul 0) Taijul, with an aesthetically 
pleasing stickerless bat, plays out a maiden, hitting a few, missing a few. 
Which frankly puts him up on some of his colleagues. The lights are on now, by 
the way - glum out there.
 
61st over: Bangladesh 215-9 (Taijul 0, Kamrul 0) The man with the name of 
great religious harmony Kamrul Islam Rabbi is in. He survives two balls, but 
that’s another fruitful over for England.
 
Shakib has been largely standing at one end watching, as the great man Tony 
Greig would have it, ‘cornage’ at the other end. And now he gets in on the fun, 
feathering an edge from a widish Woakes ball and Bairstow pouches another.
 
60th over: Bangladesh 213-8 (Shakib 8, Taijul 0) “Great leveller eh, the game 
of cricket?” writes Krishnan Patel. “The England captain tying the shoelaces of 
an 18 year old kid. A PhD Ansari looking clueless.” Not quite a PhD (yet), but 
the general point taken. New bat Taijul Islam plays out the rest of the over, 
but not in great comfort.
 
Mehedi requires a hand from Cook to tie his laces, and then we can begin. 
Mehedi goes for a big sweep, misses and is thunked on the pad. Umpire 
Dharmasena says no, but they go upstairs. There’s no edge, so the big question 
is whether it pitched outside leg....and it didn’t! It’s going to hit middle 
and leg, and once more Dharmasena is corrected by his pal with the gadgets.

59th over: Bangladesh 213-7 (Shakib 8, Mehedi 1) Woakes gets one to nip in at 
new batsman Mehedi Hasan, and he squirts a single off an inside edge to get a 
single. Another successful over for England, though.
 
Another shonky shot gives up a wicket, as Shuvagata tries to flay a wide 
half-volley with minimal footwork, but can only succeed in feathering one - 
perhaps off the toe of his bat - through to Bairstow, who takes a good low 
catch to his right.

58th over: Bangladesh 211-6 (Shakib 7, Shuvagata 6) More Mo, and he gets some 
good tweak. Shuvagata whips one off his knees that hits the short-leg, 
Ballance, on the thigh and briefly pops up, but he can’t take the rebound. 
Technically a chance, but you’d have to be the most sadistic gym teacher to rip 
him for that one. The next ball is more emphatic though, as Shuvagata belts a 
cover drive to the boundary - a little airy, but a fine shot.
