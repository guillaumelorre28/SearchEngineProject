Unlike Yorkshire’s innings, Warwickshire’s ended in a rush as Adil Rashid 
snapped a 50 partnership between Rikki Clarke and Keith Barker, his first of 
three wickets in 18 balls.
Sidebottom snatched the other, the pair of them finished with three apiece, and
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> secured a very handy 
looking lead of 78. Clarke was left stranded on 50 not out, only the second 
half-century of the match.

A momentous return to action for 38-year-old Ryan Sidebottom, who has just 
taken his 400th first-class wicket for Yorkshire to dismiss Sam Hain.
Sidebottom’s quadruple hundred have come at a cost of 22.69 runs piece, 
although his statistics since returning from Nottinghamshire in 2011 are even 
more impressive. His second spell has incorporated 237 at 21.02.
Any way up, Warwickshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> 
are 112 for six - Tim Ambrose edged a lifter from Steven Patterson immediately 
after lunch - so Yorkshire have taken some control.
Elsewhere, it is good to see Nick Compton back from a self-imposed break. 
Unfortunately, however, he has been and gone in Middlesex’s 82 for two.

Warwickshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> are four 
wickets down at lunch on day two of an absorbing Championship contest at 
Headingley.
Ian Bell, the visiting captain, gave a look of disdain to the pitch after 
miscuing a Steven Patterson delivery to point. It has been a challenging rather 
than treacherous surface, I would argue. There has been nothing jumping off a 
length to rasp gloves. It has just stopped a little every now and again.
When it has come on to the bat, it has resulted in some lovely stroke play, 
most recently from Sam Hain, who takes lunch unbeaten on 28 in a score of 68-4.

The answer to the previous question was five, and Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> finished up 257 all out, after a 
rather tame end to Patterson’s innings - caught off a leading edge at cover.
But the real drama has come inside the first 10 overs of Warwickshire’s reply. 
Andy Umeed sliced first ball to third slip, Varun Chopra then survived a 
quarter-chance to Jack Leaning at the same position, before succumbing to a 
beauty from Ryan Sidebottom delivered on the perfect left-armer’s arc.
Chopra’s lbw and the departure of Jonathan Trott, who oddly poked a return 
catch to Jack Brooks soon afterwards, left Warwicks 26-3. Brooks has 2-8.

The big question at Headingley is how long Yorkshire’s last-wicket pair of 
Steven Patterson and Ryan Sidebottom can remain together. It was not 
unsurprising that Sidebottom skipped the pre-play footie kickabout this 
morning, looking on from behind one of the goals. After all, it was a football 
related incident that contributed to a stress fracture of the ankle and a 
three-month injury absence.
Yorkshire will resume here on 252-9, a somewhat underwhelming total after 
winning the toss. Number nine Patterson played as well as anyone yesterday, 
addressing each ball on its merits and punishing the chaff. Not to take 
anything away fromWarwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc>, for whom Keith Barker, 
Division One’s leading wicket-taker, and Jeetan Patel were excellent. Wasn’t it 
ever thus?
Elsewhere, leaders Middlesex need to get rid of another of the top-flight’s 
pesky tails. Surrey, with two spinners in their XI again after Zafar Ansar 
recovered from a disc issue in his back, piled up 384-8 on day one. It is a 
healthy position if the pitch becomes as dry as recent ones at Lord’s.
A fascinating affair at Taunton too where unbeaten Durham’s pacemen fired out 
Somerset. Half a dozen wickets for the home spinners, however, mean the 
visitors resume 30 runs in arrears with only three wickets intact.

Unfortunately, however, he has been and gone in Middlesex’s 82 for two.

 
Warwickshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc> are four 
wickets down at lunch on day two of an absorbing Championship contest at 
Headingley.
Ian Bell, the visiting captain, gave a look of disdain to the pitch after 
miscuing a Steven Patterson delivery to point. It has been a challenging rather 
than treacherous surface, I would argue. There has been nothing jumping off a 
length to rasp gloves. It has just stopped a little every now and again.
When it has come on to the bat, it has resulted in some lovely stroke play, 
most recently from Sam Hain, who takes lunch unbeaten on 28 in a score of 68-4.

 
The answer to the previous question was five, and Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> finished up 257 all out, after a 
rather tame end to Patterson’s innings - caught off a leading edge at cover.
But the real drama has come inside the first 10 overs of Warwickshire’s reply. 
Andy Umeed sliced first ball to third slip, Varun Chopra then survived a 
quarter-chance to Jack Leaning at the same position, before succumbing to a 
beauty from Ryan Sidebottom delivered on the perfect left-armer’s arc.
Chopra’s lbw and the departure of Jonathan Trott, who oddly poked a return 
catch to Jack Brooks soon afterwards, left Warwicks 26-3. Brooks has 2-8.

 
The big question at Headingley is how long Yorkshire’s last-wicket pair of 
Steven Patterson and Ryan Sidebottom can remain together. It was not 
unsurprising that Sidebottom skipped the pre-play footie kickabout this 
morning, looking on from behind one of the goals. After all, it was a football 
related incident that contributed to a stress fracture of the ankle and a 
three-month injury absence.
Yorkshire will resume here on 252-9, a somewhat underwhelming total after 
winning the toss. Number nine Patterson played as well as anyone yesterday, 
addressing each ball on its merits and punishing the chaff. Not to take 
anything away fromWarwickshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warwickshireccc>, for whom Keith Barker, 
Division One’s leading wicket-taker, and Jeetan Patel were excellent. Wasn’t it 
ever thus?
Elsewhere, leaders Middlesex need to get rid of another of the top-flight’s 
pesky tails. Surrey, with two spinners in their XI again after Zafar Ansar 
recovered from a disc issue in his back, piled up 384-8 on day one. It is a 
healthy position if the pitch becomes as dry as recent ones at Lord’s.
A fascinating affair at Taunton too where unbeaten Durham’s pacemen fired out 
Somerset. Half a dozen wickets for the home spinners, however, mean the 
visitors resume 30 runs in arrears with only three wickets intact.

 
Morning all, 

Richard will be here soon but, in the meantime, here is his report from 
yesterday:
