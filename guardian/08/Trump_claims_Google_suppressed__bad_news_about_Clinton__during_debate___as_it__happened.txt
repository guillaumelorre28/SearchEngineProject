Today in Campaign 2016

 * Barack Obama suffered a unique political blow today, when the US Congress 
overturned his veto of a bill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/senate-obama-veto-september-11-bill-saudi-arabia>
 that would allow families of the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks
to sue Saudi Arabia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/911-saudi-arabia-bill-congress-vote>
. The overwhelming bipartisan vote in both the Senate and House inflicted the 
first veto override of Obama’s presidency, less than four months before he 
leaves office. The White House issued an unusually scathing response. “I would 
venture to say that this is the single most embarrassing thing that the United 
States Senate has done, possibly, since 1983,” press secretary Josh Earnest 
told reporters. “Ultimately these senators are going to have to answer their 
own conscience and their constituents as they account for their actions today.” 
 * Hillary Clinton turned to the magnetic power of Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-rally>
 today as her battle continued to persuade younger voters to rally to her 
cause. For months, Sanders and Clinton were often irascible rivals, as she 
edged towards the Democratic nomination and he continued to inspire a movement 
of millennials. And on campus in the battleground state of New Hampshire, 
Sanders’ star power was still there for all to see as hundreds of young voters 
formed a line snaking across campus, which left many to make do with a spot in 
an overflow room as he spoke. Sanders makes case for Clinton in New Hampshire

Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson, asked during a televised town 
hall meeting to name a foreign leader he admires, struggled to come up with a 
single one, saying that he was having an “Aleppo moment”.

Johnson and his running mate Bill Weld were being interviewed by MSNBC’s Chris 
Matthews, who posed the question: “Who’s your favorite foreign leader?”


“Anybody,” he added.

Johnson exhaled hard.

“Mine was Shimon Peres 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/shimon-peres-former-israeli-leader-dies>
,” Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts, interjected.

But Matthews pressed Johnson. “You gotta do this. Anywhere. Any continent. 
Canada, Mexico, Europe over there, Asia, South America, Africa – name a foreign 
leader that you respect.”

“I guess I’m having an Aleppo moment,” Johnson said, then quickly said “the 
former president of Mexico”.

President Obama answers questions in CNN town hall

President Barack Obama was on the receiving end of a series of pointed 
questions from military veterans and personal during a CNN town hall at a 
military base in Richmond, Virginia, today, where the president was challenged 
on combat roles for women, controversies regarding the national anthem at 
football games and his refusal to use the term “radical Islamic terrorism.”

The town hall, hosted by CNN’s Jake Tapper, featured questions from armed 
forces community members who have, polling shows,not warmed to the president 
historically 
<http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/22/politics/obama-military-low-approval-rating/>.

An active-duty Marine asked Obama why the “tangible, negative consequences” of 
allowing women to serve in combat roles was “disregarded” in his 
administration’s decision to open up the roles to women.


“I want to make sure our starting assumption is that if you can do the job, 
you should be able to get the job,” Obama responded, saying that the decision 
had not been made just to be “politically correct.”

Asked about the growing trend among some athletes to kneel during the national 
anthem in protest of the treatment of African Americans by police, Obama said 
that while the national anthem is of special importance to those in the 
military, “part of what makes this country special is that we respect people’s 
rights to have a different opinion.”

The mother of a 19-year-old son killed in Iraq asked Obama: “Why do you still 
refuse to use the term ‘Islamic terrorism’?”

Obama responded, has he has before, that he doesn’t want to conflate the 
roughly 1.2 billion Muslims around the world “who are peaceful, who are 
responsible, who in this country are our fellow troops” with those who commit 
acts of terrorism.

Donald Trump’s campaign’s talking points regarding Alicia Machado have been 
obtained by CNN reporter Jim Acosta. Most of the lines, aimed at helping Trump 
surrogates address the controversy caused by Trumpcalling attention to the 
former Miss Universe winner’s weight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton>
, involve Hillary Clinton’s husband and his personal life in the 1990s.

The talking points, verbatim:

 * These are totally baseless and unsubstantiated claims by Ms. Machado, who 
has lobbed a vicious and contradictory smear campaign in order to gain 
notoriety at the expense of Mr. Trump’s name and reputation. 
 * Hillary Clinton will continue to use these false distractions like Ms. 
Machado and Mark Cuban to easily deceive the biased media, but will have no 
impact on Mr. Trump or the voters who are concerned with real issues. 
 * Mr. Trump has spent his career promoting women his campaign manager is a 
strong and impressive woman. This is a desperate smear campaign by the Clintons.
 * Mr. Trump has never treated women the way Hillary Clinton and her husband 
did when they actively worked to destroy Bill Clinton’s accusers. 
 * If we’re going to dredge up what people have said about candidates in 
decades past, why isn’t the media letting people hear from these women? 
 * Hillary Clinton bullied and smeared women like Paula Jones, Gennifer 
Flowers and Monica Lewinsky. 
 * Why are we not hearing from Monica Lewinsky, who started an anti-bullying 
foundation because of how she was treated by the Clinton machine? 
 * The Clintons are now trying to bully Mr. Trump and his supporters, whom the 
Clintons have publicly demeaned as “deplorable.” 
 * Hillary Clinton trying to present herself as some sort of feminist champion 
is a joke. Facebook

Donald Trump opens his speech by declaring that Google’s search engine was 
suppressing critical information about Hillary Clinton during the presidential 
debate, apparently citinga Breitbart report 
<http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/09/13/hillary-google-bias-confirmed-experiment/>
 that quoteda Russian state news agency 
<https://sputniknews.com/us/20160912/1045214398/google-clinton-manipulation-election.html>
 in making the claim, which iseasily debunked 
<https://twitter.com/NYTnickc/status/781292033398964224>.

“Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>,” Trump said.

This adds the suppression of negative Google results to a litany of supposed 
conspiracies to keep Trump from being seen as the winner of Monday night’s 
debate, including adefective microphone 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/27/politics/donald-trump-microphone-presidential-debate/>
, ahand-signaling system 
<http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/09/breaking-poker-pro-agrees-hillary-sending-hand-signals-debate-moderator-holt/>
 between Clinton and moderator Lester Holt, and crooked scientific polling that 
showed Clinton beating Trump by double digits when unscientific internet polls 
showed him crushing her.

Speaking in Wisconsin, Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> of calling every one of 
America’s citizens - “including our police” - racist and bigoted because she 
said that all people struggle with “implicit biases.”

“I said to myself, ‘Did she really say that?’ She said it,” Trump said, of the 
moment Clinton said in Monday night’s presidential debate that all people have 
implicit biases that they must fight. “It’s a bad thing, she said. Maybe 
Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself. After all, she’s the 
one who described young African-American men as super predators. And they have 
not been happy with her for a long time.

“How can she lead this country, when she thinks that America is full of 
racists, deplorables and irredeemables?”

Creator of racist 'Pepe the Frog' meme voting for Hillary Clinton

In an exclusive interview with Esquire 
<http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a49057/pepe-frog-creator-voting-hillary/?src=socialflowTW>
, the creator of a cartoon frog that has been coopted by the alt-right movement 
declared that he plans on voting for Hillary Clinton, despite the image’s 
popularity among a segment of Donald Trump’s supporters.
Deplorable AMERICAN! (@TheTrumpLady) 
I'm a racist, islamophobic. deplorable for voting Trump. Oh, well, Pepe! We 
must be doing something right!pic.twitter.com/DnJfxkG90E 
<https://t.co/DnJfxkG90E>
 <https://twitter.com/TheTrumpLady/status/777470995510669312> September 18, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/TheTrumpLady/status/777470995510669312> 
“I’m voting for Hillary for sure. I was a big fan of Bernie, but that fizzled 
out, so I’m all Hillary 2016,” said Matt Furie, who spoke with Esquire on the 
day that the Pepe the Frog meme was declared a hate-symbol by the 
Anti-Defamation League.

While Furie hasn’t made a cartoon for Clinton, he is open to the idea.

“Someone sent me a clip of Hillary addressing Pepe and the affiliation with 
white nationalists, and someone in the crowd yelled ‘Pepe!’” Furie said. “So 
that for me is just very strange that on either side - Trump or Clinton - had 
to sit down at a meeting and decide what are we going to do with this Pepe 
thing? It’s funny that it’s become part of the national debate. It’s really 
weird.”

Asked how he would grade the debate moderation skills of NBC anchor Lester 
Holt, who moderated the first presidential debate on Monday,Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told Bill O’Reilly that 
although he initially thought Holt was fair, he would give his performance a 
“C.”

“I thought he was fine, I wasn’t thinking about it, but when I reviewed it and 
I saw the commentary,” Trump said, “I realized he was much much tougher on me 
than he was on Hillary.”

“After reviewing it and after seeing the way he badgered - and even the 
questions I got,” Trump continued, “he hits me with the birther question, of 
course, and he likes to correct things on which I was actually right.”

O’Reilly, culture-warrior that he is, asked Trump about San Francisco 49ers 
quarterback Colin Kaepernick and what he would do if he owned the football 
team. (Trump once owned the New Jersey Generals, a franchise of the United 
States Football League, which played for three seasons before folding.)

“I don’t know what he said about me, but I think what he’s doing is 
disgraceful,” Trump said. “He’s making a tremendous amount of money, he’s 
leading the American dream, he’s trying to make a point but I don’t think he’s 
making it the correct way.”

Trump avoided telling O’Reilly that he would fire Kaepernick, despite being 
goaded to do so by the host.

“Let’s keep the headlines down to a minimum.”

Donald Trump: 'They wanted to fire her for putting on so much weight'

Speaking on Fox News tonight, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told host Bill O’Reilly that 
the possibility that he doesn’t pay federal taxes is “the kind of thinking” 
that Americans need, before telling O’Reilly that former Miss Universe Alicia 
Machado was almost fired for “putting on so much weight,” but that he saved her 
job.

“I hardly know this person,” Trump said of Machado, the Venezuelan beauty queen
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton>
 who Trump called things like “Miss Piggy” and “an eating machine.”

“This is a person 20 years ago, she wasn’t a successful - you know, I sold the 
Miss Universe for a tremendous price about six months go, it worked out great,” 
Trump continued. “She was the first one under my ownership, she did not do 
well, she had a lot of difficulties. The company itself wanted to fire her - I 
wanted to save her job.”

Trump said that although he had almost no interaction with Machado, he moved 
to prevent her from the Miss Universe company - then owned by him - from 
“firing” her as Miss Universe.

“I had nothing to do with this person, but they wanted to fire her, I saved 
her job,” Trump said. “And you know what happened? I got nothing out of it.”

“They wanted to fire her for putting on so much weight,” Trump continued. “I 
said ‘don’t do that, let her try and lose the weight.’”

The notion that Machado’s weight shouldn’t impact her job performance as Miss 
Universe did not occur to Trump, who continued: “I mean, it’s a beauty contest 
- these girls know what they’re getting into.”

“This is what you get for helping somebody.”

The pool report from Donald Trump’s press plane reveals two things.

One: Trump is almost at the venue in crucial Waukesha County, Wisconsin, to 
deliver remarks to a crowd of supporters.

Two: The press plane has been dubbed “First Amendment One.”

First Amendment One touched down just as the door to the Trump plane opened at 
6:18 CDT. His plane was wheels up at 5:07 and First Amendment One was wheels up 
at 5:09. His Motorcade was rolling to event at 6:22 while pool is still being 
swept on the tarmac. No word on if he will delay his remarks for his traveling 
press to cover them. This is suboptimal.

Donald Trump in 2013: Kim Kardashian 'has gotten a little bit large'

In an undated video interview obtained by Vanity Fair 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/09/kim-kardashian-donald-trump-body-shaming?mbid=social_twitter>
, Republican nominee Donald Trump is seen telling an interviewer that reality 
star Kim Kardashian West “has gotten a little bit large,” the latest in a 
series of gaffes in which the presidential candidate has made comments 
regarding the size and weight of women.

Only one day after Trump targeted a former Miss Universe pageant winner for 
gaining“a massive amount of weight,” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton>
 the video - apparently from 2013, when Kardashian West was pregnant with her 
first child - surfaced on YouTube, showing Trump speaking to HLN’s Showbiz 
Tonight about Kardashian West creating a baby registry.

“She’s a nice person,” Trump said. “I’ve known her over the years. She’s 
really a nice person. She’s gotten a little bit large. I would say this, I 
don’t think you should dress like you weigh 120 pounds.”

In what has been billed as the most-watched debate in presidential history 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra>
, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton made Trump’s remarks to Machado a 
centerpiece of their first televised clash,citing the name-calling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends>
 – in particular, Trump calling her “Miss Housekeeping” in reference to her 
Latina origins – as a prime example of her opponent’s demeaning views about 
women.

 * Barack Obama suffered a unique political blow today, when the US Congress 
overturned his veto of a bill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/senate-obama-veto-september-11-bill-saudi-arabia>
 that would allow families of the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks
to sue Saudi Arabia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/911-saudi-arabia-bill-congress-vote>
. The overwhelming bipartisan vote in both the Senate and House inflicted the 
first veto override of Obama’s presidency, less than four months before he 
leaves office. The White House issued an unusually scathing response. “I would 
venture to say that this is the single most embarrassing thing that the United 
States Senate has done, possibly, since 1983,” press secretary Josh Earnest 
told reporters. “Ultimately these senators are going to have to answer their 
own conscience and their constituents as they account for their actions today.” 
 * Hillary Clinton turned to the magnetic power of Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-rally>
 today as her battle continued to persuade younger voters to rally to her 
cause. For months, Sanders and Clinton were often irascible rivals, as she 
edged towards the Democratic nomination and he continued to inspire a movement 
of millennials. And on campus in the battleground state of New Hampshire, 
Sanders’ star power was still there for all to see as hundreds of young voters 
formed a line snaking across campus, which left many to make do with a spot in 
an overflow room as he spoke. Sanders makes case for Clinton in New Hampshire

Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson, asked during a televised town 
hall meeting to name a foreign leader he admires, struggled to come up with a 
single one, saying that he was having an “Aleppo moment”.

Johnson and his running mate Bill Weld were being interviewed by MSNBC’s Chris 
Matthews, who posed the question: “Who’s your favorite foreign leader?”


“Anybody,” he added.

Johnson exhaled hard.

“Mine was Shimon Peres 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/shimon-peres-former-israeli-leader-dies>
,” Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts, interjected.

But Matthews pressed Johnson. “You gotta do this. Anywhere. Any continent. 
Canada, Mexico, Europe over there, Asia, South America, Africa – name a foreign 
leader that you respect.”

“I guess I’m having an Aleppo moment,” Johnson said, then quickly said “the 
former president of Mexico”.

President Barack Obama was on the receiving end of a series of pointed 
questions from military veterans and personal during a CNN town hall at a 
military base in Richmond, Virginia, today, where the president was challenged 
on combat roles for women, controversies regarding the national anthem at 
football games and his refusal to use the term “radical Islamic terrorism.”

The town hall, hosted by CNN’s Jake Tapper, featured questions from armed 
forces community members who have, polling shows,not warmed to the president 
historically 
<http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/22/politics/obama-military-low-approval-rating/>.

An active-duty Marine asked Obama why the “tangible, negative consequences” of 
allowing women to serve in combat roles was “disregarded” in his 
administration’s decision to open up the roles to women.


“I want to make sure our starting assumption is that if you can do the job, 
you should be able to get the job,” Obama responded, saying that the decision 
had not been made just to be “politically correct.”

Asked about the growing trend among some athletes to kneel during the national 
anthem in protest of the treatment of African Americans by police, Obama said 
that while the national anthem is of special importance to those in the 
military, “part of what makes this country special is that we respect people’s 
rights to have a different opinion.”

The mother of a 19-year-old son killed in Iraq asked Obama: “Why do you still 
refuse to use the term ‘Islamic terrorism’?”

Obama responded, has he has before, that he doesn’t want to conflate the 
roughly 1.2 billion Muslims around the world “who are peaceful, who are 
responsible, who in this country are our fellow troops” with those who commit 
acts of terrorism.
 
Donald Trump’s campaign’s talking points regarding Alicia Machado have been 
obtained by CNN reporter Jim Acosta. Most of the lines, aimed at helping Trump 
surrogates address the controversy caused by Trumpcalling attention to the 
former Miss Universe winner’s weight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton>
, involve Hillary Clinton’s husband and his personal life in the 1990s.

The talking points, verbatim:

 * These are totally baseless and unsubstantiated claims by Ms. Machado, who 
has lobbed a vicious and contradictory smear campaign in order to gain 
notoriety at the expense of Mr. Trump’s name and reputation. 
 * Hillary Clinton will continue to use these false distractions like Ms. 
Machado and Mark Cuban to easily deceive the biased media, but will have no 
impact on Mr. Trump or the voters who are concerned with real issues. 
 * Mr. Trump has spent his career promoting women his campaign manager is a 
strong and impressive woman. This is a desperate smear campaign by the Clintons.
 * Mr. Trump has never treated women the way Hillary Clinton and her husband 
did when they actively worked to destroy Bill Clinton’s accusers. 
 * If we’re going to dredge up what people have said about candidates in 
decades past, why isn’t the media letting people hear from these women? 
 * Hillary Clinton bullied and smeared women like Paula Jones, Gennifer 
Flowers and Monica Lewinsky. 
 * Why are we not hearing from Monica Lewinsky, who started an anti-bullying 
foundation because of how she was treated by the Clinton machine? 
 * The Clintons are now trying to bully Mr. Trump and his supporters, whom the 
Clintons have publicly demeaned as “deplorable.” 
 * Hillary Clinton trying to present herself as some sort of feminist champion 
is a joke.

Speaking to the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay Republican organization, former 
Republican presidential candidate andDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> surrogate Newt Gingrich told 
the audience that “You are not supposed to gain 60 pounds the year you are Miss 
Universe,” in reference to Alicia Machado, the Venezuelan beauty queen who 
Trump called “Miss Piggy” and told newscasters gained “a massive amount of 
weight” while she was serving as Miss Universe.

The audience, composed largely of gay men, laughed.

Donald Trump opens his speech by declaring that Google’s search engine was 
suppressing critical information about Hillary Clinton during the presidential 
debate, apparently citinga Breitbart report 
<http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/09/13/hillary-google-bias-confirmed-experiment/>
 that quoteda Russian state news agency 
<https://sputniknews.com/us/20160912/1045214398/google-clinton-manipulation-election.html>
 in making the claim, which iseasily debunked 
<https://twitter.com/NYTnickc/status/781292033398964224>.

“Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>,” Trump said.

This adds the suppression of negative Google results to a litany of supposed 
conspiracies to keep Trump from being seen as the winner of Monday night’s 
debate, including adefective microphone 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/27/politics/donald-trump-microphone-presidential-debate/>
, ahand-signaling system 
<http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/09/breaking-poker-pro-agrees-hillary-sending-hand-signals-debate-moderator-holt/>
 between Clinton and moderator Lester Holt, and crooked scientific polling that 
showed Clinton beating Trump by double digits when unscientific internet polls 
showed him crushing her.
 
Speaking in Wisconsin, Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> of calling every one of 
America’s citizens - “including our police” - racist and bigoted because she 
said that all people struggle with “implicit biases.”

“I said to myself, ‘Did she really say that?’ She said it,” Trump said, of the 
moment Clinton said in Monday night’s presidential debate that all people have 
implicit biases that they must fight. “It’s a bad thing, she said. Maybe 
Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself. After all, she’s the 
one who described young African-American men as super predators. And they have 
not been happy with her for a long time.

“How can she lead this country, when she thinks that America is full of 
racists, deplorables and irredeemables?”
 
Watch it live here:
 
In an exclusive interview with Esquire 
<http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a49057/pepe-frog-creator-voting-hillary/?src=socialflowTW>
, the creator of a cartoon frog that has been coopted by the alt-right movement 
declared that he plans on voting for Hillary Clinton, despite the image’s 
popularity among a segment of Donald Trump’s supporters.
Deplorable AMERICAN! (@TheTrumpLady) 
I'm a racist, islamophobic. deplorable for voting Trump. Oh, well, Pepe! We 
must be doing something right!pic.twitter.com/DnJfxkG90E

“I’m voting for Hillary for sure. I was a big fan of Bernie, but that fizzled 
out, so I’m all Hillary 2016,” said Matt Furie, who spoke with Esquire on the 
day that the Pepe the Frog meme was declared a hate-symbol by the 
Anti-Defamation League.

While Furie hasn’t made a cartoon for Clinton, he is open to the idea.

“Someone sent me a clip of Hillary addressing Pepe and the affiliation with 
white nationalists, and someone in the crowd yelled ‘Pepe!’” Furie said. “So 
that for me is just very strange that on either side - Trump or Clinton - had 
to sit down at a meeting and decide what are we going to do with this Pepe 
thing? It’s funny that it’s become part of the national debate. It’s really 
weird.”
 
Asked how he would grade the debate moderation skills of NBC anchor Lester 
Holt, who moderated the first presidential debate on Monday,Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told Bill O’Reilly that 
although he initially thought Holt was fair, he would give his performance a 
“C.”

“I thought he was fine, I wasn’t thinking about it, but when I reviewed it and 
I saw the commentary,” Trump said, “I realized he was much much tougher on me 
than he was on Hillary.”

“After reviewing it and after seeing the way he badgered - and even the 
questions I got,” Trump continued, “he hits me with the birther question, of 
course, and he likes to correct things on which I was actually right.”

O’Reilly, culture-warrior that he is, asked Trump about San Francisco 49ers 
quarterback Colin Kaepernick and what he would do if he owned the football 
team. (Trump once owned the New Jersey Generals, a franchise of the United 
States Football League, which played for three seasons before folding.)

“I don’t know what he said about me, but I think what he’s doing is 
disgraceful,” Trump said. “He’s making a tremendous amount of money, he’s 
leading the American dream, he’s trying to make a point but I don’t think he’s 
making it the correct way.”

Trump avoided telling O’Reilly that he would fire Kaepernick, despite being 
goaded to do so by the host.

“Let’s keep the headlines down to a minimum.”
 
Speaking on Fox News tonight, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told host Bill O’Reilly that 
the possibility that he doesn’t pay federal taxes is “the kind of thinking” 
that Americans need, before telling O’Reilly that former Miss Universe Alicia 
Machado was almost fired for “putting on so much weight,” but that he saved her 
job.

“I hardly know this person,” Trump said of Machado, the Venezuelan beauty queen
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton>
 who Trump called things like “Miss Piggy” and “an eating machine.”

“This is a person 20 years ago, she wasn’t a successful - you know, I sold the 
Miss Universe for a tremendous price about six months go, it worked out great,” 
Trump continued. “She was the first one under my ownership, she did not do 
well, she had a lot of difficulties. The company itself wanted to fire her - I 
wanted to save her job.”

Trump said that although he had almost no interaction with Machado, he moved 
to prevent her from the Miss Universe company - then owned by him - from 
“firing” her as Miss Universe.

“I had nothing to do with this person, but they wanted to fire her, I saved 
her job,” Trump said. “And you know what happened? I got nothing out of it.”

“They wanted to fire her for putting on so much weight,” Trump continued. “I 
said ‘don’t do that, let her try and lose the weight.’”

The notion that Machado’s weight shouldn’t impact her job performance as Miss 
Universe did not occur to Trump, who continued: “I mean, it’s a beauty contest 
- these girls know what they’re getting into.”

“This is what you get for helping somebody.”

The pool report from Donald Trump’s press plane reveals two things.

One: Trump is almost at the venue in crucial Waukesha County, Wisconsin, to 
deliver remarks to a crowd of supporters.

Two: The press plane has been dubbed “First Amendment One.”

First Amendment One touched down just as the door to the Trump plane opened at 
6:18 CDT. His plane was wheels up at 5:07 and First Amendment One was wheels up 
at 5:09. His Motorcade was rolling to event at 6:22 while pool is still being 
swept on the tarmac. No word on if he will delay his remarks for his traveling 
press to cover them. This is suboptimal.
 
In an undated video interview obtained by Vanity Fair 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/09/kim-kardashian-donald-trump-body-shaming?mbid=social_twitter>
, Republican nominee Donald Trump is seen telling an interviewer that reality 
star Kim Kardashian West “has gotten a little bit large,” the latest in a 
series of gaffes in which the presidential candidate has made comments 
regarding the size and weight of women.

Only one day after Trump targeted a former Miss Universe pageant winner for 
gaining“a massive amount of weight,” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton>
 the video - apparently from 2013, when Kardashian West was pregnant with her 
first child - surfaced on YouTube, showing Trump speaking to HLN’s Showbiz 
Tonight about Kardashian West creating a baby registry.

“She’s a nice person,” Trump said. “I’ve known her over the years. She’s 
really a nice person. She’s gotten a little bit large. I would say this, I 
don’t think you should dress like you weigh 120 pounds.”

In what has been billed as the most-watched debate in presidential history 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra>
, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton made Trump’s remarks to Machado a 
centerpiece of their first televised clash,citing the name-calling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends>
 – in particular, Trump calling her “Miss Housekeeping” in reference to her 
Latina origins – as a prime example of her opponent’s demeaning views about 
women.
