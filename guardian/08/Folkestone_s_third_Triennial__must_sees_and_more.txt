Folkestone’s first Triennial, in 2008 hinged on the appeal of public art in 
locations visitors might not otherwise have explored. So the event, brainchild 
of local millionaire Roger de Haan, sawTracey Emin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/emin>’s tiny bronze castings of baby 
clothes scattered across town from railing to kerb, whileNathan Coley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/sep/23/nathan-coley-kosovo-sculpture-beacon>
’s illuminated text,Heaven Is A Place Where Nothing Ever Happens 
<https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Heaven+Is+A+Place+Where+Nothing+Ever+Happens&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=BXH3U7ntHKnG0QWbhoCQAg&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg&biw=1824&bih=1030#facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=E5EWOQUFbcdsaM%253A%3BNgn3MtN-TlBdFM%3Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fc1.staticflickr.com%252F5%252F4150%252F5079857609_17979ee352_z.jpg%3Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.flickr.com%252Fphotos%252Faustraliancentreforcontemporaryart%252F5079857609%252F%3B640%3B480>
, lit up scruffy Tontine Street.

It was hailed as a success, and highlighted what a scenic – if a little 
fatigued – place the town was. By the start of the second show in 2011, 
however, developments were really afoot: the HS1 high-speed rail link had 
arrived, shortening the journey time from London from 90 to 55 minutes; Mark 
Sargeant’s harbour restaurant,Rocksalt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/26/rocksalt-folkestone-kent-restaurant-review>
, had opened, giving tourists an upmarket dining option; and a new selection of 
works includedCornelia Parker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/cornelia-parker>’s life-size 
Folkestone Mermaid 
<http://www.artfund.org/what-we-do/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/12012/the-folkestone-mermaid-cornelia-parker>
, at the tip of the Stade, the cobbled fishermen’s quarter.

So, with the third Triennial opening, how is Folkestone doing in 2014? Some 
might say the town’s fortunes rely too heavily on art, or on the new cafes, 
shops and restaurants on its hilly streets, but there are also significant 
civic developments this year. Most prominent is the reinvention byMuf Architects
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/28/muf-ruskin-square-croydon-review>
 of the long-dilapidatedPayers Park, a steeply sloping site in the heart of the 
Creative Quarter.

And overlooking the sea at the top of the Road of Remembrance, near Mark 
Wallinger <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/mark-wallinger>’s powerful 
memorialFolk Stones <http://folkestoneartworks.co.uk/artists/mark-wallinger/> 
(from the first Triennial), a shiny newcentenary arch 
<http://www.folkestonetouristinformation.co.uk/Folkestone-Tourist-Information/WW1-Centenary-Prince-Harry-Memorial-Arch-Folkestone.html>
 was unveiled earlier this month. Commemorating the millions who passed through 
the town on the way to the Western Front during the first world war, it’s an 
ultra-modern steel structure, balancing Folkestone’s past while keeping its 
eyes firmly on the future. It’s already wildly popular.

 Jyll Bradley’s Green/Light sculpture in a disused gasworks 
Wear comfy footwear, because seeing the 21 artworks, which include pieces by 
Yoko Ono 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/13/yoko-ono-guggenheim-bilbao-conceptual-influence>
, requires several miles of walking. The official route (which also lists works 
in situ from earlier Triennials) begins at the station: here the railway bridge 
has been transformed by local artists groupStrange Cargo

plaques adorning the brickwork.

 Rocksalt restaurant 
El Cortador (elcortadorfolkestone.com <http://elcortadorfolkestone.com/>, 41 
Old High Street) offers well-priced tapas (from £2 each), including creamy fish 
croquettes, and a generous plate of serrano ham and manchego cheese for just 
£4.50. Elsewhere in the Creative Quarter, opt for a contemporary meal at the 
Ampersand Design Cafe (ampersanddesigncafe.co.uk 
<http://ampersanddesigncafe.co.uk/>, 46 Tontine Street), Italian at Bloom’s 
(2-4 Old High Street) or veggie at cosyBeano’s Cafe (43 Old High Street).

Need sustenance on the Leas seafront promenade? Sisters Abi and Aimi Lauder, 
new arrivals from south London, have just opened chic bistro-cum-vintage shop
Follies (133 Sandgate Road), with charcuterie and Lebanese lamb on the menu.

For fine dining, the aforementioned Rocksalt (1 Back Street, 
rocksaltfolkestone.co.uk <http://rocksaltfolkestone.co.uk/>) offers commanding 
harbour views, a lovely terrace and imaginative fish dishes. If the restaurant 
is full, try the upstairs bar for cute bowls of cockles or dressed crab. Next 
door, theSmokehouse (thesmokehousefolkestone.co.uk 
<http://thesmokehousefolkestone.co.uk/>, 1 Back St) fries good fish and chips; 
cheaper options are seafood huts such asBob’s on the Stade.

Cool down with La Casa del Bello Gelato (12 Cheriton Place), which has been 
churning out artisan ice-cream in flavours such as orange and carrot and panna 
cotta for a dozen years.

 Googies, worth searching for. Photograph: Dan Desborough 
First, a coffee. Googies (googies.co.uk <http://googies.co.uk/>, 15 Rendezvous 
Street) is a cafe-cum-cocktail bar with arty vibe and first-rate beans. Its 
gourmet burgers and espresso martinis are pretty good, too. But to taste coffee 
from a real brewing master, Thomas Burrows atManifest (46 Old High Street) is 
unbeatable: his smooth filter is made using Square Mile beans, and even tastier 
are his coffee colas, which he concocts using all manner of botanicals.

Fancy something a little stronger? Try the two micropubs: The Firkin, a former 
hairdresser’s (firkinalehouse.co.uk <http://www.firkinalehouse.co.uk/>, 18 
Cheriton Place), or new arrivalKipp’s (11 Old High Street), which serves potent 
ciders from Canterbury along with gentler ales. Nearby, you’ll find the town’s 
oldest boozer, theBritish Lion (8 The Bayle), which dates back to the 15th 
century, whileThe Pullman (9 Church Street) has just reopened with a stylish, 
candle-lit interior.
