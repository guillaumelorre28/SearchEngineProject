Marshmallows toasting on an open fire beneath a star-filled sky, kayaks, 
hammocks, mosquito bites, first kisses. Who doesn’t love camp? Nostalgic adults 
can now rejoice: it’s not just for kids anymore.

Adult camps are a booming business in the US as stressed adults head for the 
hills to unleash their inner child. On a hot but breezy Friday morning in June, 
it was easy to recognize fellow campers in midtown Manhattan. As most New 
Yorkers hurried to work, campers – clutching their pillows and sleeping bags – 
sported a sheepish smile. “Are you going to camp?” said one as we looked for 
the bus that would take us toCamp Bonfire <http://campbonfire.com/> in 
Pennsylvania.

Camp Bonfire was started by Jacob Winterstein and Ben Camp last year and is 
held atLake Owego camp for boys <http://www.lakeowego.com/>, where the two met 
as children. This year, about 170 people attended the camp’s second sold-out 
session, paying between $449 and $499 each.

With adults searching for new ways to achieve work-life balance and make 
friends, adult camps have become a million-dollar industry. This year, weeks 
before kids across the nation finished off the school year, adults got first 
dibs on cabins and campgrounds in the hopes of reliving some of their happy 
childhood memories.

cabins. Photograph: Paul Gargagliano for the Guardian 
While there are many activities such as card-printing, jewelry-making, 
canoeing, archery, rock climbing, kickball and so on, the campers are allowed 
to do whatever they like. The camp’s slogan, reiterated over and over during 
the weekend, is: “You’re a grown-ass adult. Do what you like.”

“You want to lay in a hammock and read a book for six hours? OK, but other 
people might glare at you,” said Winterstein, to laughter from the campers.

The only thing you cannot do at Camp Bonfire is be on your phone. That is, 
unless you are in the designated technology area, which is located in a far 
corner of the campground in a space used for most of the year as the shooting 
range. Surprisingly few people took advantage of the tech zone, perhaps because 
we were encouraged to shame anyone using their phone outside the area by 
trilling our best phone-ringing impression.

 ‘We want this to be a place that’s welcoming to people of all ages. We want 
this to be a camp that we can grow old into,’ said Jacob Winterstein, one of 
the co-founders of Camp Bonfire. Photograph: Paul Gargagliano for the Guardian 
Camp Bonfire started as a place to go with friends and friends of friends, but 
word has quickly spread beyond Philadelphia, where both Winterstein and Camp 
live. This year, campers came from as far as Houston, Nashville and Cleveland.


“We are trying to figure out if it’s a fad or if it’s something that will be 
around for a while, where people could come to for the next 30 years,” said 
Camp, noting that they are hoping to expand Camp Bonfire along the eastern 
seaboard.

“We want this to be a place that’s welcoming to people of all ages,” added 
Winterstein, pointing out that campers range in age from early 20s to mid-70s. 
“We want this to be a camp that we can grow old into.”

Adam Tishauer, founder and head camper of Camp No Counselors 
<https://www.campnocounselors.com/>, appeared on Shark Tank, the US version of 
Dragons’ Den, in May in the hopes of raising funds to expand his camp. Serving 
the “sharks” with s’mores – a typical camp snack – Tishauer stood before them 
and asked for $300,000 investment in exchange for 7.5% of his business.

At this camp, mornings start with bloody marys and mimosas. “Play like a kid. 
Party like a grown up. All the camp classics but with a twist ... an open bar,” 
according to Instagram and Facebook ads for the camp.

Charging $478 per person, four camps grossed $160,000 last year. This year, 
Camp No Counselors expanded to organize weekends in Boston, Austin, Chicago, 
Los Angeles, Nashville, New York, San Francisco, Miami and more. At the time of 
Tishauer’s pitch, the camp planned 11 weekend camps with 1,800 people, whose 
average age was 30. It had grossed $730,000 so far and was expected to reach 
$800,000, with $165,000 in profit.

Tishauer wants to do 30 camps next year and projects profits will reach 
$800,000. His valuation of his adult camp business is $4m. Despite noting that 
Camp No Counselors is a “brilliant idea” and self-sustaining business, no 
sharks bit.

“It sucks. There’s a lot of insects. You get eaten alive,” said Kevin O’Leary, 
one of the sharks who used to be a camp counselor and described himself as 
“masterful canoeist”.

“Today, I like a mint on my pillow when I go to bed. I don’t want to be 
anywhere near a camp. I don’t know why these people would do this,” he said.

Another shark, Daymond John, pointed out that overnight activities with 
alcohol can be a liability.

A New York Observer 
<http://observer.com/2016/06/i-went-to-a-booze-filled-adult-summer-camp-it-was-crazier-than-i-expected/>
 reporter who attended a weekend at Camp No Counselors this year reported on an 
impromptu 60-person drinking game involving flipping cups. At Camp Throwback, 
another adult camp near Dayton, Ohio, or at Camp Bonfire, campers are more 
likely to break into song than start a drinking-game tournament.

While there is no day-long open bar at Camp Bonfire, some cocktails and beers 
were available both evenings courtesy ofBrooklyn Brewery

. As anyone who has ever watched a movie about camp will know, there are often 
rivalries between camps.

 ‘You don’t have to unleash the inner child. Adults have the ability to play as 
they are and who they are, they just don’t always have the opportunity,’ said 
Ben Camp, one of the co-founders of Camp Bonfire. Photograph: Paul Gargagliano 
for the Guardian 
“They are doing their thing,” Camp said when asked about Camp No Counselors 
business model. “I wouldn’t want to go to that camp. I want to go to this camp.”


That seems to be the consensus among other campers as well. “Who wants to have 
a weekend free of drunk assholes?” Winterstein and Camp asked on Friday. All 
hands went up.

It’s nice to be doing something that is “not centered around alcohol”, said 
Karine Semple, 29, who pointed out that many weekend activities like going out 
and brunch include drinks. “We live for the weekend. I love being outside with 
other people.”

Semple, who works as a senior health analytics consultant, flew in all the way 
from Houston to attend the camp. Earlier this year, she made a list of things 
to do by herself before turning 30: go on a yoga retreat, travel to Europe, 
spend the weekend at an adult camp. Semple did not really “do” camps as a 
child. She lived in Scotland until she was 10, at which point her family moved 
to Texas.

“It’s truly a camp experience in every way,” she said, noting that she had 
“not been surrounded by such a diverse group of people in a long time”.

Leora, 41, skipped her college reunion to attend Camp Bonfire for a second 
time this year.

“It’s nice to come back. You don’t get nervous when you don’t know anyone,” 
she said. This year, her many activities included freestyle rap session with 
Winterstein and archery. “I tried to do different things this year. I tried to 
push myself. I felt more empowered this time around.”

While not as brave as she was when she was younger, Hattie Johnson, 25, tried 
out the high ropes – where other campers pull you up in the air and then let 
you swing over the trees.

“I went to camp as a kid and it was one of the best parts of my childhood and 
I wanted to experience that again,” said Johnson, who flew in from Nashville, 
where she works as a logistics analyst.

Another challenge she faced that weekend? Surviving without her phone. 

“Telling time gets tricky,” she says laughing, pointing at her bare wrist. “At 
the same time, it was nice to be disconnected and not worry about work.”

One camper admitted to checking her phone late at night inside her cabin. 
Afraid that the glow of her phone would give her away despite the low 
brightness setting, she zipped herself completely inside her sleeping bag.

At Camp Throwback, phones are allowed and according to Brittany Gibbons, 
camp’s founder, most people use them in “really light social settings”.

“They are Instagramming pictures of where they are going or taking videos. 
It’s great advertisement on our end but its also lasting memories for them,” 
she said. “I haven’t caught anybody working.”

But Camp Bonfire wants to keep it old-school and its campers seem happy. Being 
without a phone “was amazing”, says Semple, on the bus back to New York as the 
weekend came to an end.

“I have a few messages but none of them were urgent. It’s a good reminder that 
there are more instances when I do not need my phone,” she explained, noting 
that phones are often used as a crutch in social situations. “If everyone 
around you is on the phone, you want to be on the phone, too.”
