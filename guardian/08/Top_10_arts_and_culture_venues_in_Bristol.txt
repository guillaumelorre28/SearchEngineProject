Upfest

Street art is by definition ephemeral. It may appear one day and be gone the 
next – before it can even be Instagrammed. Bristol is considered by many the 
street art capital of Europe. Walk down Nelson Street or Stokes Croft and you 
can see why, with pieces the size of five-storey buildings created with the 
blessing of city authorities. If you want pieces of street art on your walls at 
home without reaching for the spray cans, go to the Upfest gallery (which also 
organises an annualstreet art festival in Bedminster and Southville 
<http://visitbristol.co.uk/things-to-do/upfest-bristol-2013-p1484003>, though 
this year it is taking a much-needed year off).

Antlers

This nomadic art gallery has cropped up in various locations across Bristol 
over recent years, from a shopping centre to an old Edwardian toilet (see 
below). Its only permanent place is online. Antlers' newest physical space, 
opening later this month, is within the imposing brick walls of a former gas 
purifying station in Hotwells, overlooking a small inlet of theFloating Harbour 
<http://www.bristolfloatingharbour.org.uk/>. Its new temporary headquarters 
will have a private viewing room and office, a shop for Antlers artists' work, 
and a large exhibition and function room.

The Architecture Centre

Bristol's elected mayor, George Ferguson, is an architect, who specialised in 
transforming old buildings into one with a new use. In a former sail workshop, 
the Architecture Centre aims to make the discipline more accessible, 
championing better buildings and better places through exhibitions and talks. 
Intricate scale models of several London 2012 Olympic venues were on display 
recently. Urban wanderings is a series of guided walks (£6/£4) run by 
volunteers and looking at modern housing developments around the harbour, and 
buildings in the historic Redcliffe area.

Centrespace

Hidden down a narrow alley that was the inspiration for a scene in the Wallace 
& Gromit film The Wrong Trousers, the Centrespace co-operative has been 
offering artists, designers and craftspeople studio space for more than 20 
years in the heart of the old city. The downstairs exhibition area is its 
public-facing side, with recent highlights including the work of a prosthetic 
limb manufacturer, and memories on display written on luggage labels hung on a 
washing line. Every December studio members themselves take over the gallery.

Cube

Friends and supporters of the Cube helped secure the long-term future of this 
cinema and arts venue last year by raising £185,000 to buy the freehold. Even 
Bristol-born artist Banksy helped out indirectly – after an anonymous 
benefactor donated a piece that was subsequently auctioned at Bonhams. This 
not-for-profit co-operative defies easy definition, with a small army of 
volunteers and an infectious DIY ethos. Costa book of the year winnerNathan 
Filer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/28/costa-book-award-nathan-filer> 
takes part in a monthly night of literary variety and cabaret. Don't leave

Edwardian Cloakroom

This former toilet has been closed since 2001 and retains many original 
features, including an elaborately tiled porcelain floor. Turned into a 
human-size bird box last year by artistLouis Masai Michel 
<http://louismasaimichel.blogspot.co.uk/>, it has also been used as a shop and 
a mindreader's lair. Artists can now hire it rent-free from Bristol city 
council for exhibitions or events open to the public. The new project is a 
legacy of the former Capacity scheme, which turned Bristol's disused spaces 
into affordable creative places. Not just an arts space, this is a unique 
chance to explore the unusual building's architecture and history.

Bristol Folk House

From pottery to life drawing, language lessons to jive dancing, you can find 
almost anything to make you a more interesting person at the Folk House. 
Regular art exhibitions and music are what make this place work so well, with 
an intimate venue primarily for folk gigs. It is also one of the venues for the
Bristol International Jazz and Blues Festival 
<http://www.bristoljazzandbluesfest.com/>. Eat some of the best and 
least-appreciated food in Bristol in the attached cafe, where a recent 
refurbishment incorporates old programmes as table covers.

The Georgian House Museum

It's difficult to avoid Bristol's connection to the slave trade. The city's 
largest concert venue,Colston Hall <http://www.colstonhall.org/>, is named 
after the city's most prominent slave trader,Edward Colston 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Colston> – although it's debatable whether 
it's actually named after the road rather than the man. What is now the 
Georgian House Museum was built in 1790 as a family home for George Pinney, a 
wealthy plantation owner and sugar merchant, and is a remarkably well-preserved 
slice of time as well as being a salutary reminder of where much of Bristol's 
wealth came from.

In the heart of Stokes Croft, an ever-changing street art canvas and the best 
place in Bristol for people watching, Here Gallery displays artwork by local 
and international artists, primarily printmaking and illustration. It also has 
one of the most eclectic bookshops in the city – matched only by the one at the
Arnolfini <http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/> gallery, stocking everything from 
gorgeous illustrated children's books to niche magazines from around the world.

Spike Island

Spike Island, the area, is hemmed in by water, with the Floating Harbour on 
one side and the New Cut on the other. Spike Island, the venue, is home to a 
gallery, cafe and working space for artists, designers and creative businesses 
in fields from fine art fabrication to film production. The current exhibition 
is byCevdet Erek <http://cevdeterek.com/> from Istanbul. There are also regular 
artist talks and studio visits. For the first time last year, Spike Island took 
over an off-site venue in the harbourside area, which hosted a spill-over of the
Bloomberg New Contemporaries <http://www.newcontemporaries.org.uk/>exhibition.
