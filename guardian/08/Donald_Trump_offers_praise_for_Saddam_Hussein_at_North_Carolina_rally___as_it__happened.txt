Today in Campaign 2016

 * The threat of criminal charges hanging over Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> was finally lifted by the 
FBI this morning – just hours before the presumptive Democratic nominee for 
president was due to begin campaigning with Barack Obama for the first time 
this election cycle. At a press conference in Washington,FBI director James 
Comey announced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-email-fbi-full-statement-director-james-comey>
 the end of the year-long investigation into whether Clinton’s use of a private 
email server while secretary of state warranted prosecution under laws designed 
to protect classified government data. 
 * Though highly critical of the “extremely careless” way in which emails were 
handled, Comey said theFBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> would not 
be recommending that prosecutors seek charges in the case. “Although there is 
evidence of potential violations of the statutes … our judgment is that no 
reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,” said Comey.

 * For the curious, here’s Comey’s full statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-email-fbi-full-statement-director-james-comey>
. 
 * Clinton, for her part, flew above the fray, appearing with President Barack 
Obama at a campaign event in Charlotte, North Carolina. By the time their 
shared limousine, nicknamed “the beast”, reached the Charlotte Convention 
Center, the former secretary of state was basking in the kind of unabashed 
praise that would have been impossible for Obama to deliver while a possible 
indictment was still hanging over her. 
 * “My faith in Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has always been 
rewarded,” said the president in a speech that was part campaign endorsement, 
part character testimony. “I have had a front row seat to her judgement,” he 
added, without a hint of irony. Trump’s name produced a predictable response 
from the crowd of Clinton supporters, prompting the president to call: “Don’t 
boo – vote!” 
 * A Jewish employee of a newspaper owned by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s 
son-in-law,wrote an open letter to Kushner 
<http://observer.com/2016/07/an-open-letter-to-jared-kushner-from-one-of-your-jewish-employees/>
 accusing him of “tacit approval” for a culture of antisemitic hatred 
surrounding Trump and challenging Kushner to do something to break it up. Dana 
Schwartz, anentertainment writer <http://observer.com/author/dana-schwartz/> at 
the Observer, wrote “An Open Letter to Jared Kushner, From One of Your Jewish 
Employees 
<http://observer.com/2016/07/an-open-letter-to-jared-kushner-from-one-of-your-jewish-employees/>
” today. The Observer is a New York City-based paper that Kushner, the 
billionaire scion of a real estate family, bought in 2006. 
 * Schwartz wrote that she became a target of antisemitic hate speech after 
she took issue with a Trump tweet posted Saturday that included an image that 
House speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday called “antisemitic”. Schwartz challenges 
Kushner as a fellow Jewish member of the media to face what is happening in the 
barely concealed underbelly of his father-in-law’s campaign.
Goodbye to a weird, ugly and absurd US election primary season

Iconic blonde bombshell and immortal gift to the American songbook Dolly 
Parton wrote what may be the most colorful refusal to endorse a presidential 
candidate on Facebook this afternoon, after inaccurate rumors that she had 
endorsedHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
spread on social media.

Parton, known for penning some of the most indelible singles in the English 
language and being the most successful female country artist of all time, among 
other accomplishments, told the New York Times that “Hillary might make as good 
a president as anybody ever has,” which some construed as an endorsement.

Since it’s late on the East Coast, here Parton is singing “Jolene”:

After clearing the indictment hurdle, presumptive Democratic presidential 
nomineeHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
has notched another political victory today: an increase in her double-digit 
lead over presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

According to a poll released this evening from Reuters/Ipsos 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKCN0ZL2S6>, Clinton 
has a 13-point lead over Trump, with 46% of likely voters telling pollsters 
that they support her candidacy, compared to a dismal 33% saying that they back 
Trump. A full 22% told pollsters that they would not support either candidate 
in November, instead not voting or pulling the lever for a third-party 
candidate.

Trump’s level of support among likely voters is roughly 10 points below what 
2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney received at the same point in the campaign 
four years ago.

For those who missed it, the Guardian’s Dan Roberts reported live from 
Charlotte, North Carolina, where President Barack Obama appeared on the 
campaign trail withHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> for the first time.

Nothing makes for a quicker getaway after a narrow brush with the law than Air 
Force One.


Hillary Clinton spent Tuesday morning in Washington being chastised by an 
unexpectedly stern director of the FBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps>
, but a few hours later she was flying free – cleared at least of the threat of 
criminal charges and heading to her first campaign rally alongside the 
commander-in-chief, with only political storms on the horizon.

Their arrival in North Carolina was not without its awkward moments. Add 
together the standard presidential motorcade and the already long convoy of a 
presidential candidate, and you reach a cumbersome 28-vehicle snake that nearly 
tied itself in a knot drivingon the way out of the airport.

But by the time their shared limousine, nicknamed “the beast”, reached the 
Charlotte Convention Center, the former secretary of state was basking in the 
kind of unabashed praise that would have been impossible for Obama to deliver 
whilea possible indictment was still hanging over her.

“My faith in Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has always been 
rewarded,” said the president in a speech that was part campaign endorsement, 
part character testimony. “I have had a front row seat to her judgement,” he 
added, without a hint of irony.

It was hard to tell whether the beaming Clinton was happier about the 
compliments or that Obama never once mentioned an email scandal that the FBI 
had found to beworse than almost anyone imagined

Donald Trump, speaking in North Carolina, just praised deposed Iraqi dictator 
Saddam Hussein as a killer of terrorists, noting that Hussein “didn’t read them 
the rights” before executing them.

“Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, right? He was a bad guy. Really bad guy,” Trump 
begins. “But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so 
good. They didn’t read them the rights, they didn’t talk. They were a 
terrorists - it was over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism.”

Hussein was labelled a major sponsor of terrorism by the American government 
for decades, a status that was a major plank in the rationale to invade Iraq in 
2003.

Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton of bribing attorney general

“It’s a bribe!” Donald Trump says, of statements Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has made in the past 
about possibly extending attorney general Loretta Lynch’s tenure into her 
administration.

“He knew that the FBI was going to do this, because it would’ve been very 
uncomfortable for him to campaign with her, actually, if they didn’t take a 
pass on Crooked Hillary,” Trump says ofBarack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama>.

“We need somebody with a tough temperament,” Trump says, juxtaposing himself 
with the president. “Whether it’s on trade, whether it’s on military, whether 
it’s on the border, the last person these other countries want to see as 
president... is Donald J. Trump! The last person.”

After accusing Hillary Clinton

Enron-style purge of her emails,” Trump declares that “that alone disqualifies 
her, and again, Bernie Sanders talked about bad, bad judgement, but he’s not

“I always knew, and I always see, and it’s so sad, that our system is, in

 * The threat of criminal charges hanging over Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> was finally lifted by the 
FBI this morning – just hours before the presumptive Democratic nominee for 
president was due to begin campaigning with Barack Obama for the first time 
this election cycle. At a press conference in Washington,FBI director James 
Comey announced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-email-fbi-full-statement-director-james-comey>
 the end of the year-long investigation into whether Clinton’s use of a private 
email server while secretary of state warranted prosecution under laws designed 
to protect classified government data. 
 * Though highly critical of the “extremely careless” way in which emails were 
handled, Comey said theFBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> would not 
be recommending that prosecutors seek charges in the case. “Although there is 
evidence of potential violations of the statutes … our judgment is that no 
reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,” said Comey.

 * For the curious, here’s Comey’s full statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-email-fbi-full-statement-director-james-comey>
. 
 * Clinton, for her part, flew above the fray, appearing with President Barack 
Obama at a campaign event in Charlotte, North Carolina. By the time their 
shared limousine, nicknamed “the beast”, reached the Charlotte Convention 
Center, the former secretary of state was basking in the kind of unabashed 
praise that would have been impossible for Obama to deliver while a possible 
indictment was still hanging over her. 
 * “My faith in Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has always been 
rewarded,” said the president in a speech that was part campaign endorsement, 
part character testimony. “I have had a front row seat to her judgement,” he 
added, without a hint of irony. Trump’s name produced a predictable response 
from the crowd of Clinton supporters, prompting the president to call: “Don’t 
boo – vote!” 
 * A Jewish employee of a newspaper owned by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s 
son-in-law,wrote an open letter to Kushner 
<http://observer.com/2016/07/an-open-letter-to-jared-kushner-from-one-of-your-jewish-employees/>
 accusing him of “tacit approval” for a culture of antisemitic hatred 
surrounding Trump and challenging Kushner to do something to break it up. Dana 
Schwartz, anentertainment writer <http://observer.com/author/dana-schwartz/> at 
the Observer, wrote “An Open Letter to Jared Kushner, From One of Your Jewish 
Employees 
<http://observer.com/2016/07/an-open-letter-to-jared-kushner-from-one-of-your-jewish-employees/>
” today. The Observer is a New York City-based paper that Kushner, the 
billionaire scion of a real estate family, bought in 2006. 
 * Schwartz wrote that she became a target of antisemitic hate speech after 
she took issue with a Trump tweet posted Saturday that included an image that 
House speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday called “antisemitic”. Schwartz challenges 
Kushner as a fellow Jewish member of the media to face what is happening in the 
barely concealed underbelly of his father-in-law’s campaign.
Goodbye to a weird, ugly and absurd US election primary season 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/05/us-election-2016-primary-season-donald-trump-video> 
When told of Trump’s comments on Saddam Hussein, House speaker Paul Ryan told 
Fox News’ Megyn Kelly that Hussein “was one of the 20th century’s most evil 
people.”
 
Iconic blonde bombshell and immortal gift to the American songbook Dolly 
Parton wrote what may be the most colorful refusal to endorse a presidential 
candidate on Facebook this afternoon, after inaccurate rumors that she had 
endorsedHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
spread on social media.

Parton, known for penning some of the most indelible singles in the English 
language and being the most successful female country artist of all time, among 
other accomplishments, told the New York Times that “Hillary might make as good 
a president as anybody ever has,” which some construed as an endorsement.

Since it’s late on the East Coast, here Parton is singing “Jolene”:
 
After clearing the indictment hurdle, presumptive Democratic presidential 
nomineeHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
has notched another political victory today: an increase in her double-digit 
lead over presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

According to a poll released this evening from Reuters/Ipsos 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKCN0ZL2S6>, Clinton 
has a 13-point lead over Trump, with 46% of likely voters telling pollsters 
that they support her candidacy, compared to a dismal 33% saying that they back 
Trump. A full 22% told pollsters that they would not support either candidate 
in November, instead not voting or pulling the lever for a third-party 
candidate.

Trump’s level of support among likely voters is roughly 10 points below what 
2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney received at the same point in the campaign 
four years ago.

commander-in-chief, with only political storms on the horizon.

together the standard presidential motorcade and the already long convoy of a 
presidential candidate, and you reach a cumbersome 28-vehicle snake that nearly 
tied itself in a knot drivingon the way out of the airport.

But by the time their shared limousine, nicknamed “the beast”, reached the 
Charlotte Convention Center, the former secretary of state was basking in the 
kind of unabashed praise that would have been impossible for Obama to deliver 
whilea possible indictment was still hanging over her.

“My faith in Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has always been 
rewarded,” said the president in a speech that was part campaign endorsement, 
part character testimony. “I have had a front row seat to her judgement,” he 
added, without a hint of irony.

It was hard to tell whether the beaming Clinton was happier about the 
compliments or that Obama never once mentioned an email scandal that the FBI 
had found to beworse than almost anyone imagined

Donald Trump finishes his rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, after declaring 
that he will make America great again.
 
Donald Trump, speaking in North Carolina, just praised deposed Iraqi dictator 
Saddam Hussein as a killer of terrorists, noting that Hussein “didn’t read them 
the rights” before executing them.

“Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, right? He was a bad guy. Really bad guy,” Trump 
begins. “But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so 
good. They didn’t read them the rights, they didn’t talk. They were a 
terrorists - it was over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism.”

Hussein was labelled a major sponsor of terrorism by the American government 
for decades, a status that was a major plank in the rationale to invade Iraq in 
2003.
 
“It’s a bribe!” Donald Trump says, of statements Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has made in the past 
about possibly extending attorney general Loretta Lynch’s tenure into her 
administration.

“He knew that the FBI was going to do this, because it would’ve been very 
uncomfortable for him to campaign with her, actually, if they didn’t take a 
pass on Crooked Hillary,” Trump says ofBarack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama>.

“We need somebody with a tough temperament,” Trump says, juxtaposing himself 
with the president. “Whether it’s on trade, whether it’s on military, whether 
it’s on the border, the last person these other countries want to see as 
president... is Donald J. Trump! The last person.”
 
After accusing Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> of conducting “an 
Enron-style purge of her emails,” Trump declares that “that alone disqualifies 
her, and again, Bernie Sanders talked about bad, bad judgement, but he’s not 
happy tonight, folks, but you know what, I have a feeling that they’re gonna 
have a lot of people marching on Philadelphia.”

“I always knew, and I always see, and it’s so sad, that our system is, in 
fact, rigged,” Trump says.
