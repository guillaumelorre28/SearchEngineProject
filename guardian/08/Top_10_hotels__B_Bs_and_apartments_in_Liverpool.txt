Hard Days Night

Behind the Fab-Four paraphernalia, this Beatles-themed bolthole is an assured 
addition to Liverpool's "Beatles Quarter" (and only two minutes from the 
Cavern). Rooms – not all on the huge side – feature excellent audio-visual 
systems (piping out tunes by the Beatles 24/7, should you desire), and the 
Lennon suite is complete with shimmering white baby grand piano: a nod to the 
Imagine. The hotel's bars are sleek and clubby – all wingback armchairs and 
clinking cocktails –and its restaurant, Blakes, serves perky takes on British 
classics.

Hope Street Hotel

The city's first boutique-style hotel, and still the one to beat. Cool, 
contemporary rooms combine modern tech with organic chic: all brick walls, warm 
wood and gleaming drench showers. Most rooms enjoy terrific views over the 
city's rooftops – some to the luminous stained glass lantern of theCatholic 
Cathedral <http://www.liverpoolmetrocathedral.org.uk/>. Beds are plump with 
fine linens, and REN toiletries are at hand for a pampering session in the 
bathroom. Chef Paul Askew presides over the cooking in the excellent London 
Carriage Works restaurant, consistently one of the best places to dine in the 
city.

Radisson Blu

Not all chain hotels have a touch of the airport lounge about them. For its 
Liverpool offering, Radisson Blu ratchets up the drama. The rooms are arranged 
around a soaring central atrium, and the hotel offers one of the city's most 
impressive entrances. Tucked away in the quieter Commercial District, this 
hotel's a good bet for a good night's sleep – yet only 10 minutes' walk from 
the city centre. Rooms are spacious and bed sizes are generous. The hotel's 
White Room bar is in an old lockkeeper's cottage: retained when all around it 
was razed and rebuilt. The hotel's restaurant,Filini 
<http://www.radissonblu.co.uk/hotel-liverpool/dining>, is lovingly bonkers: 
decent Italian grub served against a riotously conceived backdrop of owls and 
orchids.

Racquet Club

Creaky floorboards, mismatched antique furnishings and unstuffy service sets 
the Racquet Club apart. Once a private gentlemen's club, the hotel is a 
refreshing antidote to the clinical stylings of some of the city's self-styled 
urban hotels. The rooms (of which there are eight) have individual charm, the 
artwork is local, and guests can use the hotel's gym and squash courts (should 
you be travelling with a racquet). The hotel's Ziba Restaurant uses produce 
from the organic farm owned by the hoteliers and its bar has one of the city's 
best selections of single malts.

Hotel Indigo

Strident, vibrantly designed rooms are the centrepiece to this addition to the 
Commercial District's hotels: think sherbet-coloured throws and Day-Glo soft 
furnishings. It works – if colour's your thing. Rainfall showers add a spa-feel 
to bathrooms, iPod docks keep you entertained (assuming you have an iPod or 
iPhone) in your room. Marco Pierre White's Steakhouse serves steak pies and 
super-sized fish and chips in the sorbet-coloured restaurant. There's no 
separate bar to speak of, save for a small scattering of tables at reception, 
but for ease of access to the waterfront, this place is hard to beat.

Posh Pads Casartelli 

Stylish city living with a glittery Liverpool touch: there are huge beds, 
sleek marble-lined bathrooms and wraparound balconies in the penthouse 
apartments. Independently owned, and with more soft furnishings than John 
Lewis, Posh Pads offers the city's only five-star apartments, but still works 
out more affordable than a couple of nights in a four-star hotel if you're 
travelling with friends. The building dates back to the 18th century but inside 
it's all huge plasma TVs, iPod docks, free Wi-Fi and multi-room stereos. Great 
if you're planning on sampling the (nearby) nightlife.

The Nadler

In the heart of the city's Ropewalks district – bar and club central – The 
Nadler (previously known as Base2Stay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/sep/18/liverpool-hotel-base2stay>) 
offers self-catering rooms and apartments, with mini kitchens, HDTVs with free 
music and games, and a cool, monochromatic colour palette. Rooms range from 
terrific-value studios (some on split levels) to the swish Garden Suite, with 
private rooftop patio. You're in the thick of Liverpool's boisterous nightlife 
zone but triple glazing keeps most of the noise at bay. Good for the shops and 
restaurants ofLiverpool ONE <http://www.liverpool-one.com/>, too.

BridgeStreet at Liverpool ONE
 Bridgestreet at Liverpool One 
This is part of the successful Liverpool ONE complex, and the apartments are 
well-placed for shopping sprees: restaurants, department stores and 
entertainment venues are practically on your doorstep. That said, by night, all 
is quiet – bars and clubs are close by, but at a remove enough to allow for a 
decent kip. The apartments are fitted with full kitchens, dining area and 
lounge and bedrooms are cosy, if not overly spacious. What BridgeStreet may 
lack in atmosphere it amply makes up for in good value, especially if 
travelling with friends.

Malmaison
 Malmaison Liverpool 
Oddly, this is the only decent hotel along the waterfront. A typically dark 
and brooding Malmaison conceit: the Mal looks like a Gotham city citadel, 
looming over the inky waters of the city's docklands. Inside, a huge open 
fireplace makes for a stunning focal point, the buzzy bar and brasserie offer 
enough creature comforts for those evenings when the Mersey mist settles and a 
trip to town seems like too much of an ordeal. Bedrooms are smallish but 
luxuriously stuffed with pillows, throws and springy mattresses, and bathrooms 
feature Arran Aromatics toiletries. Most rooms enjoy views of the Mersey.

Ibis Styles
 Ibis Styles liverpool 
One of the better three-star hotels that have sprung up all over the city 
recently, the Ibis sticks to its winning formula of fuss-free accommodation, 
close to the city's sights and attractions. It's Ibis, basically, but with 
added design points. So, expect funky reception areas, energetically coloured 
bars and public spaces, and a youngish, sociable crowd. Think Premier Inn meets 
60 Minute Makeover. That said, rooms are reassuringly calm, with big beds and 
decent bathrooms.
