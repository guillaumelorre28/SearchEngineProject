Ben Jacobs is digging into the Sanders donor list:
Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
Mark Ruffalo has given 7 different donations to Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> totaling $825
 <https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/621413306096422912> July 15, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/621413306096422912> 
And looking at some congressional filings, too:
Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
By my count, 7 congressional campaigns have out raised Bobby Jindal so far.

“There is no way for the Republican party to keep Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> out of the debates now,” 
writes Ben Jacobs, upon news that Trump had filed a personal financial 
disclosure with the Federal Election Commission – the last step needed to 
secure his presence on the debate stage.

Ben writes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/15/donald-trump-net-worth-10-billion-fec-election?CMP=edit_2221>
:

In a statement, Trump’s campaign announced in all capital letters that the 
real estate mogul’s “net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS” – more than 
previously reported. It went on to note that, not including “dividends, 
interest, capital gains, rents and royalties”, Trump’s income in 2014 was 
$362m. This suggests his wealth exceeds the total worth of 2012 GOP nominee 
Mitt Romney, who was attacked for his wealth throughout the campaign.

The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs has disappeared into Jeb Bush’s second-quarter FEC 
filing <http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00579458/1015075/>. We’re 
receiving intermittent communiqués:

Former Michigan Senator Spencer Abraham is a max donor to Jeb Bush 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeb-bush>

Jeb Bush has given $388,720.15 to his campaign per filings.
Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
Both George H.W. Bush and George W. have given $2700 to Jeb Bush. H.W. 
described as "retired" while W. is "former President of the US"

Still the black sheep:
Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
Three of Jeb's siblings have given $2700 to his campaign. The only one who 
hasn't is Neil.

In what will be heartbreaking to lifelong Dolphins fan Marco Rubio, Don Shula 
gave $2700 to Jeb

NY Jets owner Woody Johnson maxed out to Jeb as well

The Guardian’s Paul Lewis (@paullewis <https://twitter.com/paullewis>) has a 
look throughthe Sanders filing and finds evidence of “broad, grassroots support.
” Paul writes:

For true comparisons, we’ll have to wait for all candidates required to file 
by this deadline to submit their documents. Butthe submission from Bernie 
Sanders 
<http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/256/201507159000148256/201507159000148256.pdf> 
shows a level of broad, grassroots support that, measured as a ratio of small 
to large donors, it will be hard for others (Clinton included) to rival. More 
than three-quarters of his haul - totalling just under $10.5m - came from 
donors who gave less than $200 in the two months since he announced his White 
House run.

His campaign - keen to spin the case that his campaign is spurred by 
grassroots backers rather than big-money donors - released a statement saying 
more than 284,000 individual donors gave an average contribution of just over 
$35 each. Or as Sanders put it: “Our campaign is a strong grassroots movement 
supported by middle-class Americans from working families, not billionaires 
trying to buy elections.”

Jeb Bush <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeb-bush>, by comparison, raised 
just $368,023 from small donors.

Records show <http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00577130/1015044/> that 
Bernie 2016 has anot-too-shabby cash-on-hand figure, either: $12,161,737.67. 
That’s more than Bush, although the former Florida governor has deliberately 
encouraged supporters to direct their donations to his preferred Super Pac, 
Right to Rise USA.

Sanders appears to eclipse Clinton for small-donor support

Bernie Sanders, the Democratic runner-up at this stage, has filed as well. His 
funding look to be truly driven bysmall-donor support. Here’s Ken Vogel of 
Politico:
Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) 
.@BernieSanders <https://twitter.com/BernieSanders> also transferred $1.5M 
from his Senate campaign, which is more than@GovernorPerry 
<https://twitter.com/GovernorPerry> raised overall.

<https://twitter.com/kenvogel/status/621395267187814400> Kenneth P. Vogel 
(@kenvogel) 
Bernie likely raised a far greater % of his $ from small donations than 
Hillary. 91% of her DONATIONS were >$100, not 91% of her TTL raised.

Jeb Bush to reveal names of cash 'bundlers'

The Jeb Bush <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeb-bush> campaign will 
disclose the names of its workhorse fundraisers, so-called “bundlers” 
responsible for building and harvesting networks of donors – families, friends, 
contacts – each of which donor can contribute a maximum of $2,700 to the 
campaign in the primary cycle and the same amount in the general.

The Clinton campaign has promised to reveal its bundlers, too. Bush is the 
first Republican candidate to vow to do so. In 2012, the Barack Obama campaign 
revealed the names of its bundlers but the Mitt Romney campaign released only 
an incomplete list.

The Washington Post reports 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/15/jeb-bush-to-release-names-of-campaign-bundlers-joining-hillary-clinton/>
:

Bush aides said Wednesday that he will release a list of bundlers who have 
helped raise donations for his campaign by Oct. 15, when campaigns must file 
reports about their fundraising and spending during the third quarter of the 
year with the Federal Election Commission.

“Governor Bush is committed to transparency,” said spokeswoman Kristy Campbell.

UPDATE: Rubio spox @AlexConant <https://twitter.com/AlexConant> says Rubio 
will comply with law but NOT release bundler names.

Donald Trump dominates GOP discussion

As we wait for further campaign finance disclosures, we’ve collected five 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> headlines you 
may have missed.

Some analysts see Trump as a big problem for the GOP. Others see him as 
ultimately helping Bush. Many marvel at Trump’s remarkable survey in popularity 
among core Republican voters. “Really? Donald Trump?”, this last group marvels.

Really, Donald Trump. Read these five stories:

In Iowa, Jeb Bush finds himself on Trump-friendly terrain 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-iowa-jeb-bush-finds-himself-on-trump-friendly-terrain/2015/07/14/98ab001c-2a48-11e5-a5ea-cf74396e59ec_story.html?postshare=3751436919746378>

Jeff Jorgensen, who chairs the local party, said that’s because Trump “has 
something that touches the Average Joe out there. And for someone in his 
position, you’d think that’s hard to do, but he’s done it,” he said.

And Bush?

“Two words: Establishment Republican,” Jorgensen said. “Given his family 
history, he’s anathema to most people around here. . . .

How Trump may ultimately help Bush 
<http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-america/newsdesk/trump-jeb-bush-walker-split-vote-20150715>

But Trump’s ascent could inadvertently help Bush, both by providing him a foil 
in the immigration debate, and also by dividing the populist conservative 
voters who are least likely to ever support an establishment favorite like the 
former Florida governor.

Listening to Donald Trump swear and talk politics on his private plane 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/12/listening-to-donald-trump-swear-and-talk-politics-on-his-private-plane/>

Trump was most animated when analyzing the way the news media covered him and 
dishing with aides about the articles they had printed out. He was less excited 
discussing the process of presidential politics. When asked about the coming 
debate, set for Aug. 6 in Cleveland, he shrugged and said, “Whatever.” When 
asked about calls for him to tone down his fiery pitch, he shrugged again.

How Donald Trump Destroyed the Republican Party’s Best-Laid Plans 
<http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/07/how-trump-destroyed-the-gops-best-laid-plans.html>

To see just how badly Trump has screwed up the intentions of the party elders, 
consider the results of a new WashingtonPost poll 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/07/15/trumps-popularity-spikes-among-republicans/>
. Since his inflammatory comments describing immigrants as criminals, Trump’s 
favorable rating among Republicans has surged:

Trump’s popularity spikes among Republicans 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/07/15/trumps-popularity-spikes-among-republicans/>

Nearly six in 10 -- 57 percent -- Republicans now have a favorable view of 
Trump, compared to 40 percent who have an unfavorable one. That marks a 
complete reversal from alate-May Post-ABC poll,  
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/polling/may-2015-washington-postabc-news-national/2015/06/02/77b8a2dc-0915-11e5-951e-8e15090d64ae_page.html>
in which 65 percent of Republicans saw Trump unfavorably.

Lincoln Chafee, the former senator and Rhode Island governor, and former 
Republican running for president as a Democrat, was out in front of the pack 
with his FEC filing, and in no other sense whatsoever.

Chafee raised less than $30,000 in his first quarter as a candidate, Politico 
noted 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/lincoln-chafee-2016-fundraising-120014.html>
 Monday.

But Chafee has also loaned his campaign $364,000, so it still exists. He is 
independently wealthy and running on a platform of the US adopting the metric 
system.
 Chafee pictured with his sole donor. Just kidding – she did not contribute.

Republicans <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> have developed 
doubts about Citizens United v FEC, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that opened 
the way for unlimited political spending by corporations.

Now some in the GOP fear that Super Pacs and other outside spending groups 
coulddistort the nominating process by keeping certain candidates with narrow 
but deep support in the race artificially long, Kenneth P Vogel and Tarini Parti
of Politico report 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/revenge-of-citizens-united-120115.html?hp=t3_r>
:

Concerns are mounting among top donors and party elites that an influx of huge 
checks into the GOP primary will hurt the party’s chances of retaking the White 
House. Long-shot candidates propped up by super PACs and other big-money groups 
will be able to linger for months throwing damaging barbs at establishment 
favorites who offer a better chance of victory, the thinking goes.

<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/revenge-of-citizens-united-120115.html#ixzz3fyvxxCAF>
. And then read Nick Confessore in the New York Times onhow Super Pacs have 
altered the campaign finance landscape:

Without super PACs, four Republicans — Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Ben 
Carson — would have raised roughly the same amount of money, between $10 
million and $12 million during the second quarter of 2015. A fifth, Rand Paul, 
would be close behind, while several others, includingRick Perry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rick-perry>, would be trailing.

Instead, the field has rapidly separated into three distinct financial tiers. 
Mr. Bush has raised about $114 million with the help of a super PAC. Mr. Cruz, 
Mr. Rubio and their super PACs occupy the next-highest tier, with each having 
raised more than $40 million.

. It’s nothing to do with FEC filing day. We’re trusting in your ecumenicalism 
here:

From the outset of the campaign, any hope that Clinton might unveil a more 
freewheeling style in keeping with the more unplugged sensibilities of today’s 
political and media culture lasted for all of, well, never. Signs of apparent 
spontaneity and whimsy have been nonexistent — she has been largely steadfast 
in avoiding interviews, with a campaign team that can convey a heavy-handed 
preoccupation with control. Conversations I have had with officials tend to be 
vigilantly ground-ruled. In June, I visited Clinton’s Brooklyn Heights 
headquarters to interview Robby Mook, her 35-year-old campaign manager. The 
meeting had been arranged through Jesse Ferguson, a campaign press minder, who 
in advance of my arrival sent me an email that said the following: ‘‘The ground 
rules we’ve had with others in our office is that the office itself is OTR,’’ 
meaning off the record. ‘‘I don’t want to get into a contest of people tweeting 
pic from our office to show they were there.’’

O'Malley reports unofficial $2m figure

Martin O’Malley, the Democratic former governor of Maryland, has told 
supporters that he raised $2m in the first month of his campaign, the 
Washington Postreports 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/15/omalley-raised-2-million-during-first-month-of-presidential-campaign-he-tells-donors/?postshare=3931436977470530>
:

The conference call with O’Malley and aides was described by three donors who 
participated. They requested anonymity to more freely discuss the call, in 
which O’Malley also provided an update on other aspects of his long-shot 
campaign.
 $2m: It’s a start Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA 
That would leave O’Malley nipping around the ankles of Democratic frontrunner 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, whose 
campaign has unofficially reported raising $45m in checks of $2,700 or less for 
her campaign. Bernie Sanders, the senator for Vermont also challenging Clinton, 
has reported raising $15m since April.

We’re not going to be hearing from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie today on 
the FEC filings front – he officially joined the race too late, 30 June, to 
embarrass himself with release second-quarter numbers.

Let’s pick up on some other news out of Christie-land, then. The 
poll-challenged governor has just picked up a decent endorsement,from Maryland 
governor Larry Hogan, the Baltimore Sun reports 
<http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/ph-ac-cn-christie-annapolis-announcement-0716-20150715-story.html>
:

“He has done a great job as governor of New Jersey,” Hogan said. “I’m 
extremely excited about the prospect ofChris Christie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chris-christie> as President of the United 
States.”

Ben Jacobs is digging into the Sanders donor list:
Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
Mark Ruffalo has given 7 different donations to Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> totaling $825
 <https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/621413306096422912> July 15, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/621413306096422912> 
And looking at some congressional filings, too:
Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
By my count, 7 congressional campaigns have out raised Bobby Jindal so far.

<https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/621410733255856128>  
“There is no way for the Republican party to keep Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> out of the debates now,” 
writes Ben Jacobs, upon news that Trump had filed a personal financial 
disclosure with the Federal Election Commission – the last step needed to 
secure his presence on the debate stage.

Ben writes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/15/donald-trump-net-worth-10-billion-fec-election?CMP=edit_2221>
:

In a statement, Trump’s campaign announced in all capital letters that the 
real estate mogul’s “net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS” – more than 
previously reported. It went on to note that, not including “dividends, 
interest, capital gains, rents and royalties”, Trump’s income in 2014 was 
$362m. This suggests his wealth exceeds the total worth of 2012 GOP nominee 
Mitt Romney, who was attacked for his wealth throughout the campaign.

The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs has disappeared into Jeb Bush’s second-quarter FEC 
filing <http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00579458/1015075/>. We’re 
receiving intermittent communiqués:

Former Michigan Senator Spencer Abraham is a max donor to Jeb Bush 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeb-bush>

Jeb Bush has given $388,720.15 to his campaign per filings.
Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
Both George H.W. Bush and George W. have given $2700 to Jeb Bush. H.W. 
described as "retired" while W. is "former President of the US"

Still the black sheep:
Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) 
Three of Jeb's siblings have given $2700 to his campaign. The only one who 
hasn't is Neil.

<https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/621407950498721792> 
In what will be heartbreaking to lifelong Dolphins fan Marco Rubio, Don Shula 
gave $2700 to Jeb

NY Jets owner Woody Johnson maxed out to Jeb as well 
 
The Guardian’s Paul Lewis (@paullewis <https://twitter.com/paullewis>) has a 
look throughthe Sanders filing and finds evidence of “broad, grassroots support.
” Paul writes:

For true comparisons, we’ll have to wait for all candidates required to file 
by this deadline to submit their documents. Butthe submission from Bernie 
Sanders 
<http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/256/201507159000148256/201507159000148256.pdf> 
shows a level of broad, grassroots support that, measured as a ratio of small 
to large donors, it will be hard for others (Clinton included) to rival. More 
than three-quarters of his haul - totalling just under $10.5m - came from 
donors who gave less than $200 in the two months since he announced his White 
House run.

His campaign - keen to spin the case that his campaign is spurred by 
grassroots backers rather than big-money donors - released a statement saying 
more than 284,000 individual donors gave an average contribution of just over 
$35 each. Or as Sanders put it: “Our campaign is a strong grassroots movement 
supported by middle-class Americans from working families, not billionaires 
trying to buy elections.”

Jeb Bush <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeb-bush>, by comparison, raised 
just $368,023 from small donors.

Records show <http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00577130/1015044/> that 
Bernie 2016 has anot-too-shabby cash-on-hand figure, either: $12,161,737.67. 
That’s more than Bush, although the former Florida governor has deliberately 
encouraged supporters to direct their donations to his preferred Super Pac, 
Right to Rise USA.
 
Bernie Sanders, the Democratic runner-up at this stage, has filed as well. His 
funding look to be truly driven bysmall-donor support. Here’s Ken Vogel of 
Politico:
Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) 
.@BernieSanders <https://twitter.com/BernieSanders> also transferred $1.5M 
from his Senate campaign, which is more than@GovernorPerry 
<https://twitter.com/GovernorPerry> raised overall.

Bernie likely raised a far greater % of his $ from small donations than 
Hillary. 91% of her DONATIONS were >$100, not 91% of her TTL raised.

On Singer’s heft: One Lunch. $500,000. The Power of Paul Singer, Republican 
Rainmaker 
<http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/one-lunch-500-000-the-power-of-paul-singer-republican-rainmaker-20150715>

A single Manhattan lunch this spring offers a small window into why hedge-fund 
billionaire Paul Singer has become one of the most powerful and sought-after 
donors in Republican politics.
 
The Jeb Bush <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeb-bush> campaign will 
disclose the names of its workhorse fundraisers, so-called “bundlers” 
responsible for building and harvesting networks of donors – families, friends, 
contacts – each of which donor can contribute a maximum of $2,700 to the 
campaign in the primary cycle and the same amount in the general.

The Clinton campaign has promised to reveal its bundlers, too. Bush is the 
first Republican candidate to vow to do so. In 2012, the Barack Obama campaign 
revealed the names of its bundlers but the Mitt Romney campaign released only 
an incomplete list.

The Washington Post reports 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/15/jeb-bush-to-release-names-of-campaign-bundlers-joining-hillary-clinton/>
:

Bush aides said Wednesday that he will release a list of bundlers who have 
helped raise donations for his campaign by Oct. 15, when campaigns must file 
reports about their fundraising and spending during the third quarter of the 
year with the Federal Election Commission.

“Governor Bush is committed to transparency,” said spokeswoman Kristy Campbell.
Nick Confessore (@nickconfessore) 
UPDATE: Rubio spox @AlexConant <https://twitter.com/AlexConant> says Rubio 
will comply with law but NOT release bundler names.

As we wait for further campaign finance disclosures, we’ve collected five 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> headlines you 
may have missed.

Some analysts see Trump as a big problem for the GOP. Others see him as 
ultimately helping Bush. Many marvel at Trump’s remarkable survey in popularity 
among core Republican voters. “Really? Donald Trump?”, this last group marvels.

Really, Donald Trump. Read these five stories:

In Iowa, Jeb Bush finds himself on Trump-friendly terrain 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-iowa-jeb-bush-finds-himself-on-trump-friendly-terrain/2015/07/14/98ab001c-2a48-11e5-a5ea-cf74396e59ec_story.html?postshare=3751436919746378>

Jeff Jorgensen, who chairs the local party, said that’s because Trump “has 
something that touches the Average Joe out there. And for someone in his 
position, you’d think that’s hard to do, but he’s done it,” he said.

And Bush?

“Two words: Establishment Republican,” Jorgensen said. “Given his family 
history, he’s anathema to most people around here. . . .

How Trump may ultimately help Bush 
<http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-america/newsdesk/trump-jeb-bush-walker-split-vote-20150715>

But Trump’s ascent could inadvertently help Bush, both by providing him a foil 
in the immigration debate, and also by dividing the populist conservative 
voters who are least likely to ever support an establishment favorite like the 
former Florida governor.

Listening to Donald Trump swear and talk politics on his private plane 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/12/listening-to-donald-trump-swear-and-talk-politics-on-his-private-plane/>

Trump was most animated when analyzing the way the news media covered him and 
dishing with aides about the articles they had printed out. He was less excited 
discussing the process of presidential politics. When asked about the coming 
debate, set for Aug. 6 in Cleveland, he shrugged and said, “Whatever.” When 
asked about calls for him to tone down his fiery pitch, he shrugged again.

How Donald Trump Destroyed the Republican Party’s Best-Laid Plans 
<http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/07/how-trump-destroyed-the-gops-best-laid-plans.html>

To see just how badly Trump has screwed up the intentions of the party elders, 
consider the results of a new WashingtonPost poll 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/07/15/trumps-popularity-spikes-among-republicans/>
. Since his inflammatory comments describing immigrants as criminals, Trump’s 
favorable rating among Republicans has surged:

Trump’s popularity spikes among Republicans 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/07/15/trumps-popularity-spikes-among-republicans/>

Nearly six in 10 -- 57 percent -- Republicans now have a favorable view of 
Trump, compared to 40 percent who have an unfavorable one. That marks a 
complete reversal from alate-May Post-ABC poll,  
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/polling/may-2015-washington-postabc-news-national/2015/06/02/77b8a2dc-0915-11e5-951e-8e15090d64ae_page.html>
in which 65 percent of Republicans saw Trump unfavorably.
 
Lincoln Chafee, the former senator and Rhode Island governor, and former 
Republican running for president as a Democrat, was out in front of the pack 
with his FEC filing, and in no other sense whatsoever.

Chafee raised less than $30,000 in his first quarter as a candidate, Politico 
noted 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/lincoln-chafee-2016-fundraising-120014.html>
 Monday.

But Chafee has also loaned his campaign $364,000, so it still exists. He is 
independently wealthy and running on a platform of the US adopting the metric 
system.

Republicans <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> have developed 
doubts about Citizens United v FEC, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that opened 
the way for unlimited political spending by corporations.

Now some in the GOP fear that Super Pacs and other outside spending groups 
coulddistort the nominating process by keeping certain candidates with narrow 
but deep support in the race artificially long, Kenneth P Vogel and Tarini Parti
of Politico report 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/revenge-of-citizens-united-120115.html?hp=t3_r>
:

Concerns are mounting among top donors and party elites that an influx of huge 
checks into the GOP primary will hurt the party’s chances of retaking the White 
House. Long-shot candidates propped up by super PACs and other big-money groups 
will be able to linger for months throwing damaging barbs at establishment 
favorites who offer a better chance of victory, the thinking goes.

. And then read Nick Confessore in the New York Times onhow Super Pacs have 
altered the campaign finance landscape:

Without super PACs, four Republicans — Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Ben 
Carson — would have raised roughly the same amount of money, between $10 
million and $12 million during the second quarter of 2015. A fifth, Rand Paul, 
would be close behind, while several others, includingRick Perry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rick-perry>, would be trailing.

Instead, the field has rapidly separated into three distinct financial tiers. 
Mr. Bush has raised about $114 million with the help of a super PAC. Mr. Cruz, 
Mr. Rubio and their super PACs occupy the next-highest tier, with each having 
raised more than $40 million.

You can read Mark Leibovich’s profile for the NY Times of Hillary Clinton here 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/magazine/re-re-re-reintroducing-hillary-clinton.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0>
. It’s nothing to do with FEC filing day. We’re trusting in your ecumenicalism 
here:

From the outset of the campaign, any hope that Clinton might unveil a more 
freewheeling style in keeping with the more unplugged sensibilities of today’s 
political and media culture lasted for all of, well, never. Signs of apparent 
spontaneity and whimsy have been nonexistent — she has been largely steadfast 
in avoiding interviews, with a campaign team that can convey a heavy-handed 
preoccupation with control. Conversations I have had with officials tend to be 
vigilantly ground-ruled. In June, I visited Clinton’s Brooklyn Heights 
headquarters to interview Robby Mook, her 35-year-old campaign manager. The 
meeting had been arranged through Jesse Ferguson, a campaign press minder, who 
in advance of my arrival sent me an email that said the following: ‘‘The ground 
rules we’ve had with others in our office is that the office itself is OTR,’’ 
meaning off the record. ‘‘I don’t want to get into a contest of people tweeting 
pic from our office to show they were there.’’

Martin O’Malley, the Democratic former governor of Maryland, has told 
supporters that he raised $2m in the first month of his campaign, the 
Washington Postreports 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/15/omalley-raised-2-million-during-first-month-of-presidential-campaign-he-tells-donors/?postshare=3931436977470530>
:

The conference call with O’Malley and aides was described by three donors who 
participated. They requested anonymity to more freely discuss the call, in 
which O’Malley also provided an update on other aspects of his long-shot 
campaign.

That would leave O’Malley nipping around the ankles of Democratic frontrunner 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, whose 
campaign has unofficially reported raising $45m in checks of $2,700 or less for 
her campaign. Bernie Sanders, the senator for Vermont also challenging Clinton, 
has reported raising $15m since April.

We’re not going to be hearing from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie today on 
the FEC filings front – he officially joined the race too late, 30 June, to 
embarrass himself with release second-quarter numbers.

Let’s pick up on some other news out of Christie-land, then. The 
poll-challenged governor has just picked up a decent endorsement,from Maryland 
governor Larry Hogan, the Baltimore Sun reports
