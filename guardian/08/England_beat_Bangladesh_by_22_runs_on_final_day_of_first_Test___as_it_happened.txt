In a match like this, there should really be three people on the podium. Gold 
would go to Stokes, of course; silver to Sabbir Rahman, who made a magnificent 
game of it on his Test debut, and bronze to Jonny Bairstow, who scored 47 and 
52 and took some superb catches behind the stumps in the heat. He and Stokes 
(103) each made more runs than England’s entire top four (96). The old line 
about having an allrounder being like having an extra man may need to be 
revised.

Over on Twitter, Tim Passey has a question, possibly rhetorical. “@TimdeLisle 
‘what a shame’? How much more @guardian can you get? Good job @englandcricket” 
Yes, very good job, and a fair cop about The Guardian. And yet, still a shame, 
in my book: a Bangladesh victory would have resounded around the cricket world. 
But it will come another day. And this match at least goes down as the 
narrowest of their 72 Test defeats.

If we were German, we would have a word for the slight sadness you feel when a 
gripping game is over – even, perhaps especially, if your team has won. The 
stream of emails has mysteriously dried up. Even John Starbuck may have slipped 
back to bed. Thanks for reading, and see you for the second Test on Friday. In 
the meantime, here’s the match report.

Bangladesh fall short as England secure victory on final day of first Test

And the man of the match is... Stokes. If it hadn’t been, we would have had to 
call for a review. He was the only player to make 100 runs in the match, and 
the only Englishman to take six wickets, but it’s less about stats and more 
about seizing the moment. When Bangladesh looked like taking a lead, he wrapped 
up their first innings. When England looked like collapsing, he propped them 
up. And when those last two wickets were needed this morning, he got them in 
the space of three balls. He seems an even better player, calmer and more 
collected, since he was made vice-captain of the one-day team the other day – 
which wouldn’t have happened if Eoin Morgan hadn’t pulled out of the tour. Is 
that the law of unintended consequences, or chaos theory?

An email from Rishabh Maheshwari. “Remember Andrew Flintoff’s superhuman 
performance in that epic Test in the Test series that people still can’t stop 
talking about.” Would that be Edgbaston 2005, by any chance? “Ben Stokes has 
similar batting and bowling figures to Freddie in that revered Test. So has 
Stokes finally stepped into Flintoff’s shoes???” Well, there are definite 
similarities – dynamism, charisma, brute strength and skill. But this feels 
like a syndrome we have seen before. For years, every new England allrounder 
was hailed (the technical term) as the new Botham. And it was never quite true, 
or fair. “Undergraduates are like decimals,” an Oxford don once said, “they 
recur.” Cricketers, I would say, are more like fractions: they don’t.

Last night, it felt as if it was all over bar the reviewing, and so it proved. 
This game of a thousand reviews ended with two more, both favouring England. 
The final tally, according to our friends at Cricinfo, is 26.

“Well done Tim,” says the indefatigable John Starbuck. “You probably now have 
your own record as the shortest last-day OBO writer and a victory to boot. 
Looking forward to the next one.” Thanks, but it doesn’t feel good. When you 
write about the game, a part of you turns to neutrality, and as much as I Root 
for England, I was willing Bangladesh on. Sabbir Rahman did so, so well and 
there he is, left high and dry, a nearly man rather than a history-maker.

What a shame that his faith in Taijul was misplaced in the end, while Alistair 
Cook’s lack of faith in his spinners was vindicated. But let’s put that more 
positively: Cook’s boundless faith in his seamers was repaid.

Headingley 1998,” writes Jenny Thompson. “I remember Alec Stewart joking to the 
crowd that the reason we’d turned up in such large numbers on the last day was 
because it was free entry and Yorkshire people love getting their money’s

further.”

All over! Shafiul lbw b Stokes 0 (263 all out)

England have won by 22 runs. What a shame. But what a Test. And what an 
all-round performance by Ben Stokes, who took the game by the scruff not once 
but twice. He deserves this denouement after the battering he suffered at the 
end of the World T20 final.

Wicket?!

Dharmasena has given the new batsman, Shafiul Islam, out, lbw to Stokes – is 
that it? The DRS will decide.

That was soooooo close – clipping just enough of leg stump. A great decision 
to review by England. And yes, the umpire was Dharmasena. Once again, England 
are favourites.

Review!

Well, we had to have one... It’s for lbw against Taijul, who was given not out 
against Stokes. The new ball has been taken, so each team has a pair of reviews 
to play with.

81st over: Bangladesh 262-8 (Sabbir 64, Taijul 16) target 286 Cook spreads the 
field to offer Sabbir the single, and off Broad’s third ball he takes it. But 
Taijul seems calm, and clips a single himself. The auto-correct on my screen is 
determined to call him Tail. Good old Grauniad. (Which it wants to call 
Graunad.)

“Good morning,” says John Starbuck. “Let’s hope they can wrap this up within 
the hour, so I and probably many others can go back to bed for a bit. It’s not 
often I follow cricket at this time, probably only for an Ashes tour before, 
but they need to make it worth our while. Any stats yet on England mucking it 
up in similar situations?”

80th over: Bangladesh 261-8 (Sabbir 63, Taijul 15) target 286 Sabbir trusts 
Taijul enough to give him four balls to face – and Taijul immediately repays 
him with a four! He hooks at a bouncer from Ben Stokes and gets a top edge for 
four, over Jonny Bairstow’s head. Taijul then plays and misses, but he 
survives. Trust, eh: does Cook trust his spinners? It seems not. Broad to 
continue, with the new ball due but not taken.

79th over: Bangladesh 256-8 (Sabbir 62, Taijul 11) target 286 Broad opens the 
bowling, and Sabbir takes a comfy two, pushed into the covers, and a streaky 
single, off the inside edge. That’s three of the 33 Bangladesh need. Sabbir has 
played like an old pro, not a debutant.

Have we been here before? Not in Bangladesh, which only joined the Test fray 
in 2000. But Ian Forth sees a parallel just before that. “England’s Test vs 
South Africa at Headingley in 1998 bears a spooky resemblance to this match. 
Chasing 219, South Africa were 185-8, needing 34 runs with two wickets in hand 
on the fifth morning. It all ended swiftly in front of a huge, success-starved 
crowd in Leeds. Allan Donald was caught behind off Angus Fraser, then Makhaya 
Ntini was sawn off by umpire Javed Akhtar, with a decision that Barry Richards 
described as ‘yet another that would have missed a second set of stumps’. I 
somehow doubt we’ll see a repeat of twitchy-fingered officialdom today.” And if 
we do, there’s always the Decision Review System, which, like Bangladesh, is 
having the match of its life.

Preamble

This is going to be brief, but then how long does it take to make history? 
Bangladesh need just 33 more runs for their first Test victory against England, 
and only their eighth in all (against 71 defeats). A couple of lusty blows from 
Sabbir Rahman, and the odd ball shooting along the deck past Jonny Bairstow, 
could make that target look tiny.

And yet England are still favourites, because Sabbir has only two tailenders 
for company, and the youngest Test nation is quite old-fashioned when it comes 
to the tail, and about four of the bowlers are seasoned match-winners who have 
the scent of victory in their nostrils. It should only take an hour, but cometh 
the hour, on the whole, cometh the Broad. And Gareth Batty, in his comeback 
Test, is a five-for waiting to happen, if only he can remind Alistair Cook that 
he exists.

Join us at 5am BST. The very definition of early doors.

In a match like this, there should really be three people on the podium. Gold 
would go to Stokes, of course; silver to Sabbir Rahman, who made a magnificent 
game of it on his Test debut, and bronze to Jonny Bairstow, who scored 47 and 
52 and took some superb catches behind the stumps in the heat. He and Stokes 
(103) each made more runs than England’s entire top four (96). The old line 
about having an allrounder being like having an extra man may need to be 
revised.

Over on Twitter, Tim Passey has a question, possibly rhetorical. “@TimdeLisle 
‘what a shame’? How much more @guardian can you get? Good job @englandcricket” 
Yes, very good job, and a fair cop about The Guardian. And yet, still a shame, 
in my book: a Bangladesh victory would have resounded around the cricket world. 
But it will come another day. And this match at least goes down as the 
narrowest of their 72 Test defeats.

If we were German, we would have a word for the slight sadness you feel when a 
gripping game is over – even, perhaps especially, if your team has won. The 
stream of emails has mysteriously dried up. Even John Starbuck may have slipped 
back to bed. Thanks for reading, and see you for the second Test on Friday. In 
the meantime, here’s the match report.

Bangladesh fall short as England secure victory on final day of first Test

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/bangladesh-fall-short-as-england-secure-victory-on-final-day-of-first-test> 
And the man of the match is... Stokes. If it hadn’t been, we would have had to 
call for a review. He was the only player to make 100 runs in the match, and 
the only Englishman to take six wickets, but it’s less about stats and more 
about seizing the moment. When Bangladesh looked like taking a lead, he wrapped 
up their first innings. When England looked like collapsing, he propped them 
up. And when those last two wickets were needed this morning, he got them in 
the space of three balls. He seems an even better player, calmer and more 
collected, since he was made vice-captain of the one-day team the other day – 
which wouldn’t have happened if Eoin Morgan hadn’t pulled out of the tour. Is 
that the law of unintended consequences, or chaos theory?
 
An email from Rishabh Maheshwari. “Remember Andrew Flintoff’s superhuman 
performance in that epic Test in the Test series that people still can’t stop 
talking about.” Would that be Edgbaston 2005, by any chance? “Ben Stokes has 
similar batting and bowling figures to Freddie in that revered Test. So has 
Stokes finally stepped into Flintoff’s shoes???” Well, there are definite 
similarities – dynamism, charisma, brute strength and skill. But this feels 
like a syndrome we have seen before. For years, every new England allrounder 
was hailed (the technical term) as the new Botham. And it was never quite true, 
or fair. “Undergraduates are like decimals,” an Oxford don once said, “they 
recur.” Cricketers, I would say, are more like fractions: they don’t.
 
Last night, it felt as if it was all over bar the reviewing, and so it proved. 
This game of a thousand reviews ended with two more, both favouring England. 
The final tally, according to our friends at Cricinfo, is 26.
 
“Well done Tim,” says the indefatigable John Starbuck. “You probably now have 
your own record as the shortest last-day OBO writer and a victory to boot. 
Looking forward to the next one.” Thanks, but it doesn’t feel good. When you 
write about the game, a part of you turns to neutrality, and as much as I Root 
for England, I was willing Bangladesh on. Sabbir Rahman did so, so well and 
there he is, left high and dry, a nearly man rather than a history-maker.

What a shame that his faith in Taijul was misplaced in the end, while Alistair 
Cook’s lack of faith in his spinners was vindicated. But let’s put that more 
positively: Cook’s boundless faith in his seamers was repaid.
 
An email from someone who was there when England did this 18 years ago. “Re: 
Headingley 1998,” writes Jenny Thompson. “I remember Alec Stewart joking to the 
crowd that the reason we’d turned up in such large numbers on the last day was 
because it was free entry and Yorkshire people love getting their money’s 
worth! Being from the other side of the Pennines, I couldn’t possibly comment 
further.”
 
England have won by 22 runs. What a shame. But what a Test. And what an 
all-round performance by Ben Stokes, who took the game by the scruff not once 
but twice. He deserves this denouement after the battering he suffered at the 
end of the World T20 final.
 
Dharmasena has given the new batsman, Shafiul Islam, out, lbw to Stokes – is 
that it? The DRS will decide.
 
That was soooooo close – clipping just enough of leg stump. A great decision 
to review by England. And yes, the umpire was Dharmasena. Once again, England 
are favourites.
 
Taijul lbw b Stokes 16 (263-9)
 
Well, we had to have one... It’s for lbw against Taijul, who was given not out 
against Stokes. The new ball has been taken, so each team has a pair of reviews 
to play with.
 
81st over: Bangladesh 262-8 (Sabbir 64, Taijul 16) target 286 Cook spreads the 
field to offer Sabbir the single, and off Broad’s third ball he takes it. But 
Taijul seems calm, and clips a single himself. The auto-correct on my screen is 
determined to call him Tail. Good old Grauniad. (Which it wants to call 
Graunad.)

“Good morning,” says John Starbuck. “Let’s hope they can wrap this up within 
the hour, so I and probably many others can go back to bed for a bit. It’s not 
often I follow cricket at this time, probably only for an Ashes tour before, 
but they need to make it worth our while. Any stats yet on England mucking it 
up in similar situations?”
 
80th over: Bangladesh 261-8 (Sabbir 63, Taijul 15) target 286 Sabbir trusts 
Taijul enough to give him four balls to face – and Taijul immediately repays 
him with a four! He hooks at a bouncer from Ben Stokes and gets a top edge for 
four, over Jonny Bairstow’s head. Taijul then plays and misses, but he 
survives. Trust, eh: does Cook trust his spinners? It seems not. Broad to 
continue, with the new ball due but not taken.
 
79th over: Bangladesh 256-8 (Sabbir 62, Taijul 11) target 286 Broad opens the 
bowling, and Sabbir takes a comfy two, pushed into the covers, and a streaky 
single, off the inside edge. That’s three of the 33 Bangladesh need. Sabbir has 
played like an old pro, not a debutant.
 
Have we been here before? Not in Bangladesh, which only joined the Test fray 
in 2000. But Ian Forth sees a parallel just before that. “England’s Test vs 
South Africa at Headingley in 1998 bears a spooky resemblance to this match. 
Chasing 219, South Africa were 185-8, needing 34 runs with two wickets in hand 
on the fifth morning. It all ended swiftly in front of a huge, success-starved 
crowd in Leeds. Allan Donald was caught behind off Angus Fraser, then Makhaya 
Ntini was sawn off by umpire Javed Akhtar, with a decision that Barry Richards 
described as ‘yet another that would have missed a second set of stumps’. I 
somehow doubt we’ll see a repeat of twitchy-fingered officialdom today.” And if 
we do, there’s always the Decision Review System, which, like Bangladesh, is 
having the match of its life.
 
This is going to be brief, but then how long does it take to make history? 
Bangladesh need just 33 more runs for their first Test victory against England, 
and only their eighth in all (against 71 defeats). A couple of lusty blows from 
Sabbir Rahman, and the odd ball shooting along the deck past Jonny Bairstow, 
could make that target look tiny.

And yet England are still favourites, because Sabbir has only two tailenders 
for company, and the youngest Test nation is quite old-fashioned when it comes 
to the tail, and about four of the bowlers are seasoned match-winners who have 
the scent of victory in their nostrils. It should only take an hour, but cometh 
the hour, on the whole, cometh the Broad. And Gareth Batty, in his comeback 
Test, is a five-for waiting to happen, if only he can remind Alistair Cook that 
he exists.

Join us at 5am BST. The very definition of early doors.
 
Tim will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s Vic Marks on the dramatic
