This large National Trust-owned villa looks more hacienda than seaside 
cottage. Overlooking Portland harbour, it was built in a frenzy of inter-war 
glamour in 1935. Now Grade II-listed, it has parquet flooring, jewel-coloured 
bathrooms and art-deco furniture, and makes a dazzling holiday base. Take 
day-trips along theJurassic coast <http://jurassiccoast.org/> and enjoy evening 
cocktails on the terrace.

The Bolthole, Combpyne

This simple cabin in the garden of the owners’ home has smart but homely decor 
with 1950s influences (Formica tables, Ercol chairs, vintage posters) and 
21st-century frills (kingsize bed, White Company towels, Ren toiletries). The 
courtyard offers a sunny dining spot, but you’re a 10-minute drive from Hix 
Oyster & Fish House in Lyme Regis and River Cottage HQ in Axminster.

Ideal for one, more cosy if you bring a friend, this space is so compact that 
the bed is the fold-down type. What it lacks in size it makes up for in style, 
however. Furnishings include mid-century pieces by Arne Jacobsen, Robin Day and 
Gerrit Rietveld, and original artwork. The bathroom is stocked with Ren 
products and the welcome hamper has homemade granola and eggs from the owner’s 
chickens.

For panoramic views, Coastguard Cottage is the next best thing to standing on 
Durdle Door with a pair of binoculars. Part of a clifftop terrace (the approach 
is a long, rough track unsuitable for low-slung cars), it comes with some 
quirks (such as harvested rainwater), but comfortable interiors offer a haven 
after a day walking, cycling, swimming or fossil-hunting.

Perfect for large parties, this early 19th-century house has a traditional 
exterior that belies its contents. Bespoke wallpaper and lighting, plus vintage 
and modern pieces, make a show-stopping mix, while a sleek indoor pool adds 
some tranquillity. Outside there’s a natural swimming pond and 14 acres of 
gardens with riverbank. TheHive Beach Café <http://www.hivebeachcafe.co.uk/> is 
just down the road.
