David on James 

What were you hoping for? 
A first chat that wasn’t stilted Tinder fare.

First impressions? 
Charming, warm and pretty easy on the eye.

What did you talk about? 
Family, Christmas, our plans for the future, and the queen herself: JK Rowling.

Any awkward moments? 
He doesn’t drink coffee, which was quite the reveal, but by that point in the 
evening, he’d built up enough good karma.

Good table manners? 
Totally.

Best thing about James? 
Damn, that man’s a conversationalist.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
There are friends I’m sure he’d get along with.

Describe him in three words 
Erudite, pleasant, groomed (in a good way).

What do you think he made of you? 
I don’t think I set his world alight. Which is fine. Nobody is meant for 
everyone.

Did you go on somewhere? 
We called it a night after dessert.

And... did you kiss? 
Only on the cheek.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? 
Nothing. It was a pretty solid night.

Marks out of 10? 
6.

Would you meet again? 
He’s a great guy, but I think we’d be better off as friends. I look forward to 
receiving his press releases.
