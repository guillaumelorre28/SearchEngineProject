This account of Ernest Shackleton's 1914 expedition to the South Pole is aimed 
at children, but its clever, evocative pages will suck in many an adult, too. 
The cover – adorned with whales, boats and vignettes of the explorers and their 
dogs – gives a clue as to its ingenious storytelling and attention to detail. 
Inside, William Grill eschews panels for wonderfully immersive spreads. The 
neat, unsentimental writing partners maps, cheerful and colourful pencil 
sketches and meticulous illustrations that capture the day-to-day life of the 
expedition. Grill shows the dog races Shackleton used to keep spirits up, the 
lines on which clothes were hung, the jobs of individual men and the vast array 
of supplies the team took – you wouldn't think great pyramids of barrels, an 
assortment of canoes, ropes, skis, spades and a bicycle would be compelling, 
but his enthusiasm is infectious. Jubilant crowds, vast waves, the stark 
geometry of South Georgia and flapping whale tails jostle for the reader's 
attention in a book that captures the rewards and trials of polar exploration 
in great style.
