The charity sector has been coined a vibrant, exhilarating place to work 
<https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/feb/17/why-i-moved-from-private-to-voluntary-sector>
 full ofopportunities and the flexibility 
<https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/feb/16/live-discussion-charity-career-change>
 to shape your organisation and career. It is therefore no surprise that 
graduates and experienced professionals alike are eager to start or move their 
careers into the world of charity.

However, despite hearing that charities are keen for cross-sector 
collaboration and in need of external expertise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/feb/18/charity-recruitment-needs-to-break-mould>
, many are finding it tough to get a foothold in the sector.

To help, we gathered together a group of voluntary sector experts including 
chief executives, HR directors, recruitment consultants, academics and former 
graduates who are now employed by charities. The panelshared their advice and 
tips 
<https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/feb/16/live-discussion-charity-career-change>
 on what you need to know before applying for a job in the voluntary sector.

1. Specific skills are not essential

Helen Giles: for entry level jobs you don't need specific skills 
Employers look for people with the right core competences – the right level of 
cognitive abilities, analytical and critical reasoning, personal organisation 
skills, self-directed learning and development and most importantly the ability 
to mange your emotions and positive relations with others.

Matthew Jackson: at senior level, cross-sector skills are the most valuable
Candidates must demonstrate an awareness of the issues facing charities, but 
also have the expertise to drive the organisation forward.

Rachel Whale: there are a handful of essential, key skills
I think there are some classic competencies all organisations would look for 
regardless of sector – team work, good communication, problem solving and self 
awareness.

Helen Giles: charities want you to demonstrate your skills – not your CV 
writing
Most charities will expect you to do more than submit a CV – you need to 
demonstrate either on an application form or in a structured covering letter 
how your previous experience and achievements match each of the criteria the 
job advert specifies.

2. Graduate schemes are a great introduction to the sector

Carla Miller: large charities often have graduate schemes
Graduate schemes can be a fantastic introduction to the sector. It is worth 
thinking about what charities you would like to work for and keeping an eye out 
on their jobs pages. You'll be able to see what sort of roles are out there and 
what skills and experience are required.

Helen Giles: graduate schemes are a great starting point
Schemes like Charityworks <http://www.charity-works.co.uk/> are great if you 
can get a place – and many larger organisations including housing associations 
run graduate training programmes.

3. Small organisations vs. large organisations

Helen Giles: there are pros and cons for each
In a small charity employees tend to cover a multitude of different roles and 
tasks as there are no specialists. In larger charities there is far more 
segregation of roles so you would need to know which area you want to get into 
– for example, service delivery, fundraising, finance or development. If you 
know what area you want to go into – you will need to show this on your 
application and demonstrate your potential in this area.

Rachel Whale: think about transferable skills between the two
Working for a smaller charity provides you with the chance to develop a 
broader range of skills – my advice would be to think about your transferable 
skills and experience for a move into a larger organisation.

4. There are opportunities outside of the Big Smoke

Matthew Jackson: when it comes to the right candidate, location is irrelevant 
All charities are aware of the importance of getting the right people on board 
and location will become less of an issue.

Alice Fuller: local charities have a lot to offer
Look for local charities or find a charity where you can work remotely – there 
are a few out there.

Matthew Jackson: micro-volunteering is an increasingly valuable asset
If remote working and micro-volunteering is going to be a way in which a 
candidate is looking to develop career links within the sector then I would 
strongly suggest targeting one organisation you would like to work with.

5. Immerse yourself in the charity sector

Alison Naftalin: contact charities directly
However, make sure you have done your research about the cause – we often get 
emails saying how much someone would like to work for us and I can see they've 
copied and pasted standard text or even mentioned campaigns that were not ours. 
Be specific and cater your applications to each organisation.

Alice Fuller: approach an insider
Find someone who is in the job you want or think you might want and ask them 
to go for a coffee. You could find out how they got the job and about their 
career path.

Alice Fuller: become a trustee first
For graduates and professionals with less experience look out for small 
charities – the latter often find it hard to recruit trustees. Even if you only 
have a few years experience in another sector, you will be in demand.

For senior professionals I'd suggest applying for a trustee role on one of the 
bigger charities who are always looking for people from outside the sector.
