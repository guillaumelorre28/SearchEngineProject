The measure was approved by voice vote on Friday. 

Passage of the legislation puts Congress on a collision course with Barack 
Obama on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the attacks.

The Senate passed the bill in May by voice vote despite vehement objections 
from Saudi Arabia, a key US ally in the Middle East.

Fifteen of the 19 hijackers from 9/11 were Saudi nationals. 

The White House has signaled that Obama would veto the legislation over 
concerns about exposing Americans overseas to legal risks.

The Obama administration

citizens can take the Saudis to court, then a foreign country could in turn sue 
the United States.
