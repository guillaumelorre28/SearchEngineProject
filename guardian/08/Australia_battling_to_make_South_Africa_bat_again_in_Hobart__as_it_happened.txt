STUMPS. Australia 121-2 (Khawaja 56, Smith 18). Trail by 120 runs.

In a day where the visitors went the better part of the first session without 
losing a wicket, that wasn’t a bad fightback from the Australians as the 
afternoon wore on. During the final session in particular all batsmen were put 
under enormous pressure by quicks Rabada and Abbott through a marathon stint 
between the two, but only one wicket fell, that of Warner (45). And even that 
came in bizarre circumstances, Abbott’s delivery ricocheting off his thigh and 
arm before landing on the stumps.

Khawaja’s half century came from 91 balls. He was routinely beaten outside the 
off-stump - as too were Warner and then Smith - but held his nerve before 
capitalising on some loose deliveries towards the end of play. That end came 
prematurely on the basis of bad light, seven overs lost. So we’ll be back again 
at 10am for another long day at Hobart tomorrow.

A long day where Australia will have plenty of work still yet to do knocking 
off the 120 runs of deficit that still remain, in an innings where Adam Voges 
may well be batting for his career. In short: be sure to tune in, and follow 
every over with us here at the Guardian. Thanks for your company. Have a good 
night.

That’s it. Stumps. The umpires have called it off. I’ll gather my thoughts for 
a final wrap in just a jiffy.

I wish I could make a Mount Wellington reference. But truth told, I can’t see 
it through the clouds. There are patches of blue sky either side of Bellerive, 
but to get back on now is a tough ask. Would require a lot of wind in a hurry. 
Three of the four umpires gathered in the middle having a chat, so either way 
we’ll know pretty soon.

Aus have knocked off half the deficit, with the loss of only two wickets. Two 
days to go. Game not over yet.

36th over: Australia 121-2 (Khawaja 56, Smith 18) Ooooh yeah, Khawaja cover 
driving on the up and doing it with style. You get four runs when doing that. 
Granted, it came the ball after he was beaten outside the off-stump. Oh and now
they’re off for bad light.Let me go outside for a tic and see if I can make a 
prediction about the likelihood of them returning. For what little that is 
worth. Stand by.

35th over: Australia 116-2 (Khawaja 51, Smith 18) Just a single from Khawaja 
in response to a relatively quiet Maharaj over. Just doing a job to give the 
quicks a rest here, the spinner. Fourth ump Mick Martel is out there to take a 
light reading. The Australians would relish the chance to get out of there and 
into the showers a fraction earlier than scheduled.

34th over: Australia 115-2 (Khawaja 50, Smith 18) Vernon Philander is angry. 
Okay? Got it? Understand? Okay. He demonstrates this with some more annoyed 
stares after Khawaja dispatches a long hop through cover point to begin the 
over. Later in the set he took a second, this time behind point. It was full 
and swinging, but he did enough. Then a single to mid-on to end the over brought
Khawaja’s half-century! Nicely played in rugged circumstances. 91 balls to get 
there. Good going from the Australian number three. Has to get to stumps though.

33rd over: Australia 106-2 (Khawaja 41, Smith 18) Chris Rogers makes a fair 
point about the importance of the current two sticking it out: “If I was Adam 
Voges I’d be praying they get through four more overs so he has the benefit of 
a nightwatchman ahead of him, with his career pretty much on the line.”

They get through Maharaj’s first over after drinks easily enough, Smith 
pumping him over midwicket when dropping short. Remember it was Smith who in 
Perth exposed Voges by getting out when set late in the day. Will he look after

As they take a drink, let’s whip through some comments. 

Chris Drew asks if Kettleborough is the best umpire in the world? There’s 
certainly a consensus forming around that given his freakishly good record in 
the heavily scrutinised DRS era. Doesn’t hurt that he’s opposite Umpire Dar 
this week, who is having a shocker of late.

Ian Forth emails in with an OLED TV gag and Warner being able to watch it 
tonight without needing to worry about batting tomorrow. Gee we’ve got some 
milage out of the Warner TV advert, haven’t we?

Ian adds, in reference to Rabada’s efforts this afternoon: “Interesting 
subject – best spells that did not yield a wicket.” That it is. “I remember one 
from Anderson to Hussey and Haddin at Brisbane, 3rd day, 2010. They both went 
on to get massive tons as well.”

Any to add?

32nd over: Australia 102-2 (Khawaja 41, Smith 14) A couple to the more set of 
the two men Khawaja, timing nicely through midwicket to a full delivery on the 
stumps. Philander repeats his angry fast bowler bit from the previous over, who 
throws this time around at Khawaja’s stumps. No harm in that. What a great 
contest this is.

31st over: Australia 98-2 (Khawaja 39, Smith 13) Maharaj is on with his left 
arm tweakers from the River End to replace Abbott. He races through his over, 
broken up by Khawaja who revels in the change of pace by advancing down the 
pitch to clobber over long-on. Fair enough, too, after what he has been forced 
to endure out there so far this afternoon. And believe it or not, there is a 
stat about his success with that very tactic. What a world.
The Cricket Prof. (@CricProf) 
Khawaja has an outstanding success rate coming down the pitch in Test cricket. 
101-1 (51 balls).#AusvSA <https://twitter.com/hashtag/AusvSA?src=hash>

30th over: Australia 93-2 (Khawaja 35, Smith 12) Tough yards for the 
Australians when Vernon Philander is the man relieving Rabada from underneath 
us here at the Members/Church Street End. As noted below, the attack leader 
came very close to breaking through immediately. A bit frustrated, he collected 
the ball in his follow through to complete the over and did the old 
pretend-to-throw-at-the-batsmen’s-stumps routine on Smith. As Bill Lawry would 
say, the tension the drama the buzz the crowd (well, sort of) the atmosphere!
Dan Liebke (@LiebCricket) 
Seriously, it's a matter of record how often umpires get LBWs wrong. A smart 
team should factor that into DRS decisions.#AUSvSA

NOT OUT! Umpires call, Kettleborough gets it right again. What a gun. It was 
clipping the bails in an umpires call kinda way. Good referral, albeit one that 
took a lot of convincing, du Plessis using every one of his 15 seconds to 
determine whether he was going upstairs.

29th over: Australia 91-2 (Khawaja 34, Smith 11) Abbott into the ninth over of 
his own spell, and has dropped off just a tad. Reckon that might be his last 
one, confirmed in all likelihood by a stray delivery onto Smith’s pads to end 
the over. The home captain makes no mistake in putting it away.

28th over: Australia 86-2 (Khawaja 33, Smith 7) “Rabada will bowl far lesser 
spells and take many wickets,” is ABC caller Gerard Whateley’s assessment of 
the nine over stint that has probably just concluded if body language is 
anything to do by. Without a wicket. Sure enough, his final set is just as 
magnificent as the eight that came before it, concluding with yet another 
legcutter that beats the Australian captain by a significant margin. Smith did 
strike a boundary through point earlier in the over, however, meaning that 
Australia have passed their first innings total! You little beauty! Beneath the 
Southern Cross I stand!
Anthony Bieniak (@Bienie) 
Game situation aside, this is test cricket at its best. Contest between bat 
and ball, tension on every over.

27th over: Australia 82-2 (Khawaja 33, Smith 3) This pair benefitted from a 
brief rain delay, but they are the only two who have been used since the final 
session commenced 65 minutes ago. And why would you change them? Abbott starts 
his set with a delivery that goes underground. Didn’t see that coming a couple 
of hours ago. He then successfully beats Khawaja twice in a row; that’s six 
play/misses in three overs if I recall correctly. And I usually do. You’ll 
rarely see better fast bowling anywhere than these two at the moment. They 
deserve better. Admirable from Khawaja to not lose his nerve in response.

26th over: Australia 82-2 (Khawaja 33, Smith 3) Rabada is just superb, beating 
Smith with a ball moving away from him off the seam. Yet another unplayable. 
Australia were stiff on Saturday, but they’re experiencing some luck today. Oh, 
and he does it again later in the over! The old-fashioned carbon copy. Hard to 
criticise the Australian captain there. Is Rabadaalready the best quick in the 
world? Look, probably not. But he’s in the frame. And will be soon.

25th over: Australia 82-2 (Khawaja 33, Smith 3) Smith off the mark with a 
lovely clip straight of midwicket, he’ll take three. Abbott is enthused from 
his fortunate second wicket, bending the back and beating Khawaja. It’s been a 
mighty spell from the River End since Tea. Imagine these blokes in Adelaide 
next week underlights with a pink ball. Could be ugly (uglier).

Speaking of which, here’s the Warner dismissal from side on.

facing Rabada. And he very nearly follows Warner into the shed when trying to 
force off the back foot with limited footwork at a time when leaving the ball 
should be the priority if they want to have any chance of eliminating this 
deficit. He’s more comfortable when Rabada is straighter, patting away the 
remainder of the over.

That's why you don't play a shot like Warner's first innings, the game is hard 
enough without making it harder for yourself#ausvsa

WICKET! Warner b Abbott 45 (Australia 2-79)

Oh what a mess! He tries to take a nondescript Abbott delivery off his hip, it 
strikes the thigh pad, balloons into his arm, and somehow lands on the 
woodwork. Warner is gutted. Goodness me. And that ends the23rd over.

22nd over: Australia 77-1 (Warner 44, Khawaja 32) Rabada continues his over 
from the Church Street End. The first ball back is a good’un, forcing Khawaja 
to take his hands off the bat as it arrives earlier than he anticipates. Next 
up: a delightful delivery thatagain beats the bat. How often in the 45 minutes 
since Tea has that happened? Around the wicket the right armer is tailing away 
from a left-hand bat. Utter class. Reminiscent of Flintoff v Gilchrist in the 
2005 Ashes come to think of it.

Stumps are back in. Yet the fourth ump still has his umbrella out. Give it a 
spell, mate. He’s literally the only human in this cricket ground with a brolly 
out. Anyway, the players are on. Good news.

The TV commentary use the rain break to run through their classic catches. Cue 
a camera looking at Mark Waugh, with his 1999 gem at Hobart, turning that 
pulsating Test Match, included in the selection. What times to be a 15 year 
old. And Bill Lawry’s call as well: “Phwoooooar what a catch!”
 “Clean as a whistle!”

Rain delay. Australia 77-1 (Warner 44, Khawaja 32)

So light that the South Africans are walking from the field rather than the 
jog you normally expect when people don’t want to get wet. Just the hessian 
cover down at this stage. Don’t expect we’ll be off for long.

21st over: Australia 76-1 (Warner 43, Khawaja 32) After being made to look a 
bit daft by Abbott’s supreme spell here in his previous over, Warner gets back 
on top with a push through cover to begin the over. And after a couple of good 
leaves, turns him into the onside for a single. Much better over Warner. 
Persevere then prosper. Reluctant to say this, but looking pretty dark out 
here. Rain coming?

20th over: Australia 71-1 (Warner 38, Khawaja 32) That’s better, Usman. Leans 
into a cover drive when Rabada is too full, as he did at will twelve months ago 
when he was making tons for laughs no matter what colour the ball or format of 
the game. The replay reinforces what a pretty stroke it is. Go on, take a look.

19th over: Australia 67-1 (Warner 38, Khawaja 28) Abbott’s turn to make 
Warner’s life difficult, as he already has a couple of times since tea. Hitting 
the seam, he beats the opener’s outside edge with consecutive deliveries. No 
luck here for the bowler. South Africa will be desperate to strike here while 
so on top.

This is brilliant Test cricket. Two of Aus's top lefthanders slogging it out v 
a quality RSA attack on a helpful pitch. Wonderful spectacle.

18th over: Australia 64-1 (Warner 36, Khawaja 27) Another eventful Rabada 
over. He once again squares up Warner with a delightful off-cutter delivered 
from around the wicket. He’s good enough to repeat the serve a couple of balls 
later. Utterly unplayable. Way too good. Forced to play due to the angle, but 
jagging away from the edge after pitching. Warner collects three when driving 
past point as Rabada slightly overpitches. Khawaja gets on behind square to the 
last ball when he does again, keeping the strike.

Rabada is fun to watch. Not so fun to face.

17th over: Australia 60-1 (Warner 33, Khawaja 26) Beaten! Warner done off the 
track again to start Abbott’s. He is trying to drive the ball from a good 
length and is lucky not to edge to the waiting ‘keeper and cordon. He’s away 
from danger with a push to midwicket, Khawaja seeing off the rest of the over. 
Without wanting to mozz him, he’s looking quite good since the break.

16th over: Australia 59-1 (Warner 32, Khawaja 26) Just as he did in the 
previous set Khawaja turns the strike over to the first Rabada ball, clipping 
fine. Warner does likewise when driving as he marches down the track. The 
consensus around the place is that it is getting better to bat by the session, 
and Khawaja illustrates this by leaving relatively easily through the rest of 
the over, including a bouncer to finish it.

15th over: Australia 57-1 (Warner 31, Khawaja 25) Abbott continues from the 
River End with a few and a conventional gully in position. He’s in the right 
area immediately, Khawaja taking one to cover but the South Africans will be 
encouraged if he keeps looking to score in that region. Warner content enough 
to see the over through. Plenty of noise out there, they can sense the pressure 
this Australian team are under no doubt.

Chris Rogers again, on ABC radio: “I am liking this from Davey Warner. 
Sometimes he is the kind of guy who gets to 20 or 30 quickly and then settles

close  
In a day where the visitors went the better part of the first session without 
losing a wicket, that wasn’t a bad fightback from the Australians as the 
afternoon wore on. During the final session in particular all batsmen were put 
under enormous pressure by quicks Rabada and Abbott through a marathon stint 
between the two, but only one wicket fell, that of Warner (45). And even that 
came in bizarre circumstances, Abbott’s delivery ricocheting off his thigh and 
arm before landing on the stumps.

Khawaja’s half century came from 91 balls. He was routinely beaten outside the 
off-stump - as too were Warner and then Smith - but held his nerve before 
capitalising on some loose deliveries towards the end of play. That end came 
prematurely on the basis of bad light, seven overs lost. So we’ll be back again 
at 10am for another long day at Hobart tomorrow.

A long day where Australia will have plenty of work still yet to do knocking 
off the 120 runs of deficit that still remain, in an innings where Adam Voges 
may well be batting for his career. In short: be sure to tune in, and follow 
every over with us here at the Guardian. Thanks for your company. Have a good 
night.
 
That’s it. Stumps. The umpires have called it off. I’ll gather my thoughts for 
a final wrap in just a jiffy.
 
I wish I could make a Mount Wellington reference. But truth told, I can’t see 
it through the clouds. There are patches of blue sky either side of Bellerive, 
but to get back on now is a tough ask. Would require a lot of wind in a hurry. 
Three of the four umpires gathered in the middle having a chat, so either way 
we’ll know pretty soon.
Ric Finlay (@RicFinlay) 
Aus have knocked off half the deficit, with the loss of only two wickets. Two 
days to go. Game not over yet.
 <https://twitter.com/RicFinlay/status/798055995620499456> November 14, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/RicFinlay/status/798055995620499456>  
36th over: Australia 121-2 (Khawaja 56, Smith 18) Ooooh yeah, Khawaja cover 
driving on the up and doing it with style. You get four runs when doing that. 
Granted, it came the ball after he was beaten outside the off-stump. Oh and now
they’re off for bad light.Let me go outside for a tic and see if I can make a 
prediction about the likelihood of them returning. For what little that is 
worth. Stand by.
 
35th over: Australia 116-2 (Khawaja 51, Smith 18) Just a single from Khawaja 
in response to a relatively quiet Maharaj over. Just doing a job to give the 
quicks a rest here, the spinner. Fourth ump Mick Martel is out there to take a 
light reading. The Australians would relish the chance to get out of there and 
into the showers a fraction earlier than scheduled.
 
34th over: Australia 115-2 (Khawaja 50, Smith 18) Vernon Philander is angry. 
Okay? Got it? Understand? Okay. He demonstrates this with some more annoyed 
stares after Khawaja dispatches a long hop through cover point to begin the 
over. Later in the set he took a second, this time behind point. It was full 
and swinging, but he did enough. Then a single to mid-on to end the over brought
Khawaja’s half-century! Nicely played in rugged circumstances. 91 balls to get 
there. Good going from the Australian number three. Has to get to stumps though.
 
33rd over: Australia 106-2 (Khawaja 41, Smith 18) Chris Rogers makes a fair 
point about the importance of the current two sticking it out: “If I was Adam 
Voges I’d be praying they get through four more overs so he has the benefit of 
a nightwatchman ahead of him, with his career pretty much on the line.”

They get through Maharaj’s first over after drinks easily enough, Smith 
pumping him over midwicket when dropping short. Remember it was Smith who in 
Perth exposed Voges by getting out when set late in the day. Will he look after 
him today?
 
As they take a drink, let’s whip through some comments. 

Chris Drew asks if Kettleborough is the best umpire in the world? There’s 
certainly a consensus forming around that given his freakishly good record in 
the heavily scrutinised DRS era. Doesn’t hurt that he’s opposite Umpire Dar 
this week, who is having a shocker of late.

Ian Forth emails in with an OLED TV gag and Warner being able to watch it 
tonight without needing to worry about batting tomorrow. Gee we’ve got some 
milage out of the Warner TV advert, haven’t we?

Ian adds, in reference to Rabada’s efforts this afternoon: “Interesting 
subject – best spells that did not yield a wicket.” That it is. “I remember one 
from Anderson to Hussey and Haddin at Brisbane, 3rd day, 2010. They both went 
on to get massive tons as well.”

Any to add? 
 
32nd over: Australia 102-2 (Khawaja 41, Smith 14) A couple to the more set of 
the two men Khawaja, timing nicely through midwicket to a full delivery on the 
stumps. Philander repeats his angry fast bowler bit from the previous over, who 
throws this time around at Khawaja’s stumps. No harm in that. What a great 
contest this is.
 
31st over: Australia 98-2 (Khawaja 39, Smith 13) Maharaj is on with his left 
arm tweakers from the River End to replace Abbott. He races through his over, 
broken up by Khawaja who revels in the change of pace by advancing down the 
pitch to clobber over long-on. Fair enough, too, after what he has been forced 
to endure out there so far this afternoon. And believe it or not, there is a 
stat about his success with that very tactic. What a world.
The Cricket Prof. (@CricProf) 
Khawaja has an outstanding success rate coming down the pitch in Test cricket. 
101-1 (51 balls).#AusvSA <https://twitter.com/hashtag/AusvSA?src=hash>

<https://twitter.com/CricProf/status/798050011422429184>  
30th over: Australia 93-2 (Khawaja 35, Smith 12) Tough yards for the 
Australians when Vernon Philander is the man relieving Rabada from underneath 
us here at the Members/Church Street End. As noted below, the attack leader 
came very close to breaking through immediately. A bit frustrated, he collected 
the ball in his follow through to complete the over and did the old 
pretend-to-throw-at-the-batsmen’s-stumps routine on Smith. As Bill Lawry would 
say, the tension the drama the buzz the crowd (well, sort of) the atmosphere!
Dan Liebke (@LiebCricket) 
Seriously, it's a matter of record how often umpires get LBWs wrong. A smart 
team should factor that into DRS decisions.#AUSvSA

NOT OUT! Umpires call, Kettleborough gets it right again. What a gun. It was 
clipping the bails in an umpires call kinda way. Good referral, albeit one that 
took a lot of convincing, du Plessis using every one of his 15 seconds to 
determine whether he was going upstairs.
 
Review! Has Philander picked up Khawaja leg before? We’ll find out in a tic. 
 
29th over: Australia 91-2 (Khawaja 34, Smith 11) Abbott into the ninth over of 
his own spell, and has dropped off just a tad. Reckon that might be his last 
one, confirmed in all likelihood by a stray delivery onto Smith’s pads to end 
the over. The home captain makes no mistake in putting it away.
 
28th over: Australia 86-2 (Khawaja 33, Smith 7) “Rabada will bowl far lesser 
spells and take many wickets,” is ABC caller Gerard Whateley’s assessment of 
the nine over stint that has probably just concluded if body language is 
anything to do by. Without a wicket. Sure enough, his final set is just as 
magnificent as the eight that came before it, concluding with yet another 
legcutter that beats the Australian captain by a significant margin. Smith did 
strike a boundary through point earlier in the over, however, meaning that 
Australia have passed their first innings total! You little beauty! Beneath the 
Southern Cross I stand!
Anthony Bieniak (@Bienie) 
Game situation aside, this is test cricket at its best. Contest between bat 
and ball, tension on every over.

<https://twitter.com/Bienie/status/798046280593215488>  
27th over: Australia 82-2 (Khawaja 33, Smith 3) This pair benefitted from a 
brief rain delay, but they are the only two who have been used since the final 
session commenced 65 minutes ago. And why would you change them? Abbott starts 
his set with a delivery that goes underground. Didn’t see that coming a couple 
of hours ago. He then successfully beats Khawaja twice in a row; that’s six 
play/misses in three overs if I recall correctly. And I usually do. You’ll 
rarely see better fast bowling anywhere than these two at the moment. They 
deserve better. Admirable from Khawaja to not lose his nerve in response.
 
26th over: Australia 82-2 (Khawaja 33, Smith 3) Rabada is just superb, beating 
Smith with a ball moving away from him off the seam. Yet another unplayable. 
Australia were stiff on Saturday, but they’re experiencing some luck today. Oh, 
and he does it again later in the over! The old-fashioned carbon copy. Hard to 
criticise the Australian captain there. Is Rabadaalready the best quick in the 
world? Look, probably not. But he’s in the frame. And will be soon.

25th over: Australia 82-2 (Khawaja 33, Smith 3) Smith off the mark with a 
lovely clip straight of midwicket, he’ll take three. Abbott is enthused from 
his fortunate second wicket, bending the back and beating Khawaja. It’s been a 
mighty spell from the River End since Tea. Imagine these blokes in Adelaide 
next week underlights with a pink ball. Could be ugly (uglier).

Speaking of which, here’s the Warner dismissal from side on.

24th over: Australia 79-2 (Khawaja 33, Smith 0) The captain charges out past 
his deputy making that unpleasant trudge from the field. But it is Khawaja 
facing Rabada. And he very nearly follows Warner into the shed when trying to 
force off the back foot with limited footwork at a time when leaving the ball 
should be the priority if they want to have any chance of eliminating this 
deficit. He’s more comfortable when Rabada is straighter, patting away the 
remainder of the over.
Daniel Brettig (@danbrettig) 
That's why you don't play a shot like Warner's first innings, the game is hard 
enough without making it harder for yourself#ausvsa

<https://twitter.com/danbrettig/status/798040940229210112>  
Oh what a mess! He tries to take a nondescript Abbott delivery off his hip, it 
strikes the thigh pad, balloons into his arm, and somehow lands on the 
woodwork. Warner is gutted. Goodness me. And that ends the23rd over. 
 
22nd over: Australia 77-1 (Warner 44, Khawaja 32) Rabada continues his over 
from the Church Street End. The first ball back is a good’un, forcing Khawaja 
to take his hands off the bat as it arrives earlier than he anticipates. Next 
up: a delightful delivery thatagain beats the bat. How often in the 45 minutes 
since Tea has that happened? Around the wicket the right armer is tailing away 
from a left-hand bat. Utter class. Reminiscent of Flintoff v Gilchrist in the 
2005 Ashes come to think of it.
 
Stumps are back in. Yet the fourth ump still has his umbrella out. Give it a 
spell, mate. He’s literally the only human in this cricket ground with a brolly 
out. Anyway, the players are on. Good news.
 
The TV commentary use the rain break to run through their classic catches. Cue 
a camera looking at Mark Waugh, with his 1999 gem at Hobart, turning that 
pulsating Test Match, included in the selection. What times to be a 15 year 
old. And Bill Lawry’s call as well: “Phwoooooar what a catch!”
 “Clean as a whistle!”  
So light that the South Africans are walking from the field rather than the 
jog you normally expect when people don’t want to get wet. Just the hessian 
cover down at this stage. Don’t expect we’ll be off for long.
 
21st over: Australia 76-1 (Warner 43, Khawaja 32) After being made to look a 
bit daft by Abbott’s supreme spell here in his previous over, Warner gets back 
on top with a push through cover to begin the over. And after a couple of good 
leaves, turns him into the onside for a single. Much better over Warner. 
Persevere then prosper. Reluctant to say this, but looking pretty dark out 
here. Rain coming?
 
20th over: Australia 71-1 (Warner 38, Khawaja 32) That’s better, Usman. Leans 
into a cover drive when Rabada is too full, as he did at will twelve months ago 
when he was making tons for laughs no matter what colour the ball or format of 
the game. The replay reinforces what a pretty stroke it is. Go on, take a look.

19th over: Australia 67-1 (Warner 38, Khawaja 28) Abbott’s turn to make 
Warner’s life difficult, as he already has a couple of times since tea. Hitting 
the seam, he beats the opener’s outside edge with consecutive deliveries. No 
luck here for the bowler. South Africa will be desperate to strike here while 
so on top.

This is brilliant Test cricket. Two of Aus's top lefthanders slogging it out v 
a quality RSA attack on a helpful pitch. Wonderful spectacle.

18th over: Australia 64-1 (Warner 36, Khawaja 27) Another eventful Rabada 
over. He once again squares up Warner with a delightful off-cutter delivered 
from around the wicket. He’s good enough to repeat the serve a couple of balls 
later. Utterly unplayable. Way too good. Forced to play due to the angle, but 
jagging away from the edge after pitching. Warner collects three when driving 
past point as Rabada slightly overpitches. Khawaja gets on behind square to the 
last ball when he does again, keeping the strike.
Neroli Meadows (@Neroli_M_FOX) 
Rabada is fun to watch. Not so fun to face.

17th over: Australia 60-1 (Warner 33, Khawaja 26) Beaten! Warner done off the 
track again to start Abbott’s. He is trying to drive the ball from a good 
length and is lucky not to edge to the waiting ‘keeper and cordon. He’s away 
from danger with a push to midwicket, Khawaja seeing off the rest of the over. 
Without wanting to mozz him, he’s looking quite good since the break.
 
16th over: Australia 59-1 (Warner 32, Khawaja 26) Just as he did in the 
previous set Khawaja turns the strike over to the first Rabada ball, clipping 
fine. Warner does likewise when driving as he marches down the track. The 
consensus around the place is that it is getting better to bat by the session, 
and Khawaja illustrates this by leaving relatively easily through the rest of 
the over, including a bouncer to finish it.
 
15th over: Australia 57-1 (Warner 31, Khawaja 25) Abbott continues from the 
River End with a few and a conventional gully in position. He’s in the right 
area immediately, Khawaja taking one to cover but the South Africans will be 
encouraged if he keeps looking to score in that region. Warner content enough 
to see the over through. Plenty of noise out there, they can sense the pressure 
this Australian team are under no doubt.

Chris Rogers again, on ABC radio: “I am liking this from Davey Warner. 
Sometimes he is the kind of guy who gets to 20 or 30 quickly and then settles 
into his innings. It looks like he has has settled down a little.”
