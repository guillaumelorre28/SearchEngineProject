Doris, 90, is prodding at a colourful image of a beach ball projected on to 
the table in front of her. She sends it wheeling off towards Don, who sweeps at 
it, bouncing it back. William taps at the image while Cathy watches intently, 
occasionally reaching out a hand. Doris giggles, Don grins, Cathy smiles 
gently. William is concentrating hard.

This is significant. All four are “difficult” or “withdrawn” residents with 
dementia at Care UK’sOak House 
<http://www.careuk.com/care-homes/oak-house-slough> care home in Slough, 
Berkshire. They are playing with aTovertafel <http://activecues.com/en/> (Magic 
Table), a series of interactive light games specifically designed for people 
with mid- to late-stage dementia, which has newly arrived in the UK.

The staff are smiling too. “It’s nice to see engagement and eyes lighting up,” 
says care home manager Julie Bignell. “Doris can be very difficult and she’s 
having a lovely time. And it’s hard to persuade Don to sit down. Now he is, and 
he is really animated playing with that ball.”

“William gets very angry and aggressive,” says his care worker, “so to get him 
to sit calmly for this long is great.”


It gives me goosebumps when I see residents with grandchildren they’ve been 
unable to communicate with playing together.
John Ramsay 
The game changes, bringing flowers floating across the table. Lily strokes one 
of them and it grows into a huge bright bloom. She starts talking about 
flowers. Then goldfish come swimming along and Lily makes them appear to swim 
up her arm. “My mother would love this,” she says. “Where can I get one? Can I 
put down a deposit?”


Tovertafel was developed in the Netherlands and has taken the region by storm. 
Launched only in March 2015, there are already 500 Tovertafels installed in 
care homes in the Benelux countries. It got its name from someone with dementia 
who announced when trying it that “this is a magic table”.

The game has been brought to the UK by John Ramsay, who gave up his job as a 
corporate lawyer to do this. His father was diagnosed with early-onset dementia 
when he was 12. “Towards the end,” Ramsay says, “there was nothing I could do 
to engage him – nothing. Having Tovertafel, something we could do together, 
would have made such a difference to me as well as to him. It gives me 
goosebumps when I see residents with grandchildren they’ve been unable to 
communicate with playing together.”

Tovertafel was developed by PhD student Hester Le Riche, who wanted to create 
something to stimulate activity – physical, mental and social – in people with 
later stage dementia. Few products are designed for them and they mostly become 
very passive. Some care homes do have sensory rooms but they require one-on-one 
supervision, and many residents find them too much and won’t go in.

Le Riche wanted to make something that would be in the care home’s main area, 
that could be done in groups and that required no special supervision. She soon 
settled on light as the perfect medium: energising, attention-grabbing, clean 
and completely safe.

After spending many months in care homes (“which sometimes almost made me 
cry”), following overworked staff (“who often didn’t even have time to talk to 
residents”), and sitting for hours beside people with dementia, Le Riche tried 
out all sorts of different images and activities. “The residents designed the 
games in the end,” she says, “we just watched, listened and laughed with them.”

When you have dementia, you are constantly losing abilities, so it is 
important to be proud of what you can do
Hester Le Riche 
Tovertafel now consists of a portable white box hung from a hook in the 
ceiling projecting interactive images on to any surface below. “It does not 
require initiative,” she says. “It invites reaction.”

Le Riche read the literature on the neuropathology of dementia and on the 
science of play, establishing that people in the later stages of the disease 
can still experience three primary outcomes of play: sensation, relaxation and 
reminiscence. Tovertafel’s eight different games (with more on the way) are 
specifically designed to elicit all three.


“You can’t go wrong,” Le Riche says. “If nobody touches the beach ball, it 
bounces off the edge of the projection area. If minds wander, there is always 
something to come back to. When you have dementia, you are constantly losing 
abilities, so it is important to be proud of what you can do.”

Le Riche and Ramsay have recently launched a version of Tovertafel for people 
with learning disabilities. The hardware is identical but the games are 
different – more intense, more directly educational. And from next spring there 
will be a set of games, also expertly designed, for children with autism. Le 
Riche is excited about this. At one test session, she says, there was a child 
who was never able to play with other kids because, “whatever he got hold of he 
threw. You can’t throw light so Tovertafel allowed him to play with other 
children for the first time.”

“Everyone has a right to play,” Ramsay adds, “we all need a bit of fun.”
