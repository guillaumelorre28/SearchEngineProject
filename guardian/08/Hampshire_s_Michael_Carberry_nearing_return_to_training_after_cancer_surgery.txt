The former England batsman Michael Carberry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-carberry> could be set for a return 
to training just six months after being diagnosed with cancer.

Hampshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hampshire> announced in July that 
the 36-year-old had a cancerous tumour, forcing him to miss the second half of 
last season. But following a successful operation, Carberry is making good 
progress as he targets a return to cricket.

“Carbs is doing really well after a successful operation. He looked a lot 
better when I saw him before Christmas,”Hampshire’s director of cricket, Giles 
White, told the Southern Daily Echo 
<http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/15011154.CRICKET__Carberry_close_to_returning_after_cancer_op/?commentSort=score>
.

“He was looking to start practising again in the new year so hopefully he’ll 
be in the nets soon. It’s now about working back to full fitness. We’ll support 
him in any way we can.”
