Peaceful and rustic, this site is run by and for families. Facilities are

Port Ban Holiday Park, Kilberry
This seaside camping and caravanning park in a remote setting on the west 
coast of Kintyre has stunning views of the Paps of Jura, a great beach with 
rock pools old and young to explore, and the chance of seeing otters. The site 
has a small shop, cafe and launderette, while foodies will love the nearby
Kilberry Inn <http://www.kilberryinn.com/>. Visit Kilmartin Glen, the Crinan 
canal, and Knapdale – where beavers have been introduced. Evening beach 
campfires are a regular occurrence. For shops I visited Tarbert (about 15 miles 
away, with its beautiful harbour). A wonderful safe place for the kids.

Glenbrittle campsite, Isle of Skye
In a grand situation below the spiky rock of the Black Cuillin, Britain's most 
fearsome peaks, Glenbrittle provides well-spaced grassy pitches at the edge of 
a bay looking across to the Small Isles. It's wild and peaceful, with no frills 
but plenty of hot water, and you'll get to test your tent against the wind 
which often funnels on or off shore. A 15-minute drive away,the Old Inn at 
Carbost <http://www.theoldinnskye.co.uk/index.php?id=1>correct is a proper pub 
and wild swimming can be had within minutes at the Fairy Pools or around the 
corner in Talisker Bay. Yes, thatTalisker 
<http://www.malts.com/taliskerwhisky/index.html>; keep a dram for after. 
Downsides: two showers will sometimes be too few; whenever the wind drops after 
early June there'll be midge; and it's so temptingly close, you might feel the 
need to scare yourself on the Cullin ridge. (Open April to Sept inclusive). 
From Sligachan take the road to Uig, turn off left to Carbost, then take the 
Glenbrittle Road.

Sango Sands Oasis, Durness
In the highlands and islands, you are likely to have a beach to yourself. Wild 
camping spots abound [wild camping is broadly legal in Scotland 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/jul/09/illegal-wild-camping>], but when 
you want facilities, Sango Sands Oasis will not disappoint. Just head as far 
north and west as you can go on the mainland well away from the pressures of 
modern life and you are there. It's a grassy clifftop with amazing views. It 
even caters for those who don't like to pay – it's free out of season! 
Facilities remain open, the only drawback being the lack of hot water. The 
northern Highlands are on your doorstep, as are sandy beaches, dramatic cliffs 
and sea caves. The nearby beautiful Durness Estuary can be crossed by ferry to 
give you access to the wilderness area of Cape Wrath. John Lennon spent many 
family holidays in Durness during his formative teenage years.
