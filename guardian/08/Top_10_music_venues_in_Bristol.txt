Lakota 

Lakota has weathered the tide of closures that swept Clockwork, Native and the 
Croft away, as if its thick coat of graffiti might have pickled it like a gaudy 
preservative. The mean-looking building conceals a busy warren built around one 
tall, central atrium, which packs to the galleries two or three nights a week. 
It is still one of the vital organs of Bristol's clubbing scene, posting a 
schedule of house, hardcore and techno DJs and representing the local passions 
for drum and bass, dub and dub-step. At 25 years old, Lakota feels almost 
respectable, although anyone who has witnessed the spectacularly unruly 
psy-trance night "Tribe of Frog" would be hard pressed to use that word.

The Old Duke

The venerable grandee whose likeness swings on the pub sign is none other than 
Sir Duke himself, a fitting figurehead for Bristol's foremost jazz bar. It's 
been there for decades; the posters that plaster the ceiling date from a time 
long before jazz backed into the margins. And yet every night, without rest, 
the stage creaks under another band, and the two lamplit rooms heave with 
people. Its greatest success has been avoiding the tendency other good jazz 
bars have to become unapproachable and sneery, and it shares a street with two 
more of the nicest pubs in central Bristol: the King William Ale House and the
Famous Royal Navy Volunteer <http://www.navyvolunteer.co.uk/>.

The Louisiana

At the corner of a Georgian terrace and belted with a covered iron balcony, 
the Louis' would look more at home up the hill in Clifton than at the eastern 
tip of Spike Island in the docklands. The exterior is almost smugly 
picturesque, and the interior justly boasts the venue's proven skill in booking 
indie acts on the brink of stardom. Emerging bands are increasingly willing to 
dogleg their tours via the Louis' despite its poky stage and meagre capacity, 
and many serious fans from London or the north will make the trip here for the 
chance to stand in spitting distance of the next big thing.

Cosies

There is something uniquely Bristolian about Cosies, which ranks among the 
most laid-back nightclubs in Britain. The word nightclub is used loosely here: 
Cosies styles itself – extremely misleadingly – as a wine bar, and maintains a 
convincing aura of sophistication during daylight hours. At night, however, it 
is a wriggling jungle of dreadlocks and cider, where distinguished reggae DJs 
thud the foundations of Portland Square. Despite its dancefloor being a 
claustrophobic underground cavern, Cosies is true to its name. The wooden pews 
and low brick ceiling offer a snug, cottage-like welcome, and there are two 
barrelled stone dens at the front where smokers of every leaning can make 
themselves at home.

Thekla

Once a German ocean-going timber vessel, the Thekla sailed to Bristol in the 
1980s and was recommissioned as a cabaret theatre by a couple of eccentrics. 
Nowadays, the lineup is perhaps less subversive and bizarre than it was, but 
Thekla remains the biggest and best of Bristol's floating venues – her metal 
hull acting as a unique, if acoustically challenging, chamber for noisy gigs. 
Despite several renovations, the experience of going to Thekla is somehow 
improved by the nagging concern that she might spring a leak at any moment, 
plunging the band and crowd into a photogenic rock'n'roll catastrophe. There's 
a wide wooden deck from which to survey the lights of the floating harbour 
before going below again into her rattling belly.

Mr Wolf's
 Photograph: Jon Kent 
This narrow and unprepossessing joint contents itself with booking unrenowned 
but capable bands three nights a week. These are followed by unrenowned but 
capable DJs, who keep the two rooms in good spirits much later than any of the 
bigger, glossier bars in the city centre. It would be unusual to go there with 
the intention of seeing anyone in particular, but even so, new acts receive a 
cheerier response at Mr Wolf's than anywhere else, and the general warmth of 
the atmosphere – along with the inexplicable provision of cheap noodles late 
into the night – make it a wise choice for anyone who wants to be absolutely 
certain of having a nice time.

The Fleece

The Fleece is a utilitarian cuboid with a gleefully unfashionable calendar. 
This is not to say that prominent and promising musicians don't find their way 
here – it's a sizeable and reputable place in an excellent location – but it is 
rather like an intersection of opposing escalators, at which bright-eyed 
freshmen meet their predecessors on the descent from greatness. In the same 
non-exclusive vein, the Fleece is also the Bristol stopover for a surprising 
number of tribute bands, whose consistent popularity is testament to their 
curious brand of talent and to the venue's lack of snobbery.

The Canteen
 The Canteen, Bristol 
Presided over by a work by Bristol street artist Banksy, the Canteen splits 
opinion. Critics consider it the storefront of gentrification in Stokes Croft, 
which roughly coincided with its appearance in 2009, while its advocates argue 
that it has effectively amplified the local sense of community and provided a 
platform for that community to express itself. Either way, the simple 
glass-fronted venue is popular, and its roster of excellent free gigs has an 
international character involving jazz, reggae, blues, folk and sundry 
combinations thereof. The kitchen is similarly cosmopolitan, whose 
embarrassingly good food (trout rillettes with pickled cucumber, lemon polenta 
with rosemary) does it no favours with the detractors.

The Golden Lion

Gloucester Road is the pride of Bristol, having maintained its singular 
variety of independent businesses and local colour in the face of the general 
standardisation of high streets nationwide. At the Horfield end, near the 
prison and a bit too far for most students, the Golden Lion channels the local 
jollity into its numerous gigs, which vary from local funk and swing bands to 
grizzled balladeers making their rounds of the West Country. Distinguishable by 
the lopsided mural daubed across its face like a birthmark, its enormous 
popularity is down to the liveliness and genuine goodwill of its loyal 
clientele. It is, in other words, what so many pub venues would like to be.

St George's
 St George's, Bristol 
Underneath Cabot Tower on Brandon Hill, this decommissioned church functions 
primarily as a classical concert hall, rivalling the larger and better-know
Colston Hall <http://www.colstonhall.org/> on the other side of Park Street. 
But more and more prominent folk singers and respected travelling bands are 
ending up here, presumably to take advantage of the neo-classical acoustics and 
the imposing mood of hushed reverence. With its whitewashed interior and quiet 
setting, it induces a particular sense of uncluttered ceremony in its 
audiences, making it is easily the best of the more decorous Bristol venues, 
and one which is largely unknown to non-locals.
