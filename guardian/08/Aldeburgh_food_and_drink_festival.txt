Aldeburgh Food and Drink Festival <http://www.aldeburghfoodanddrink.co.uk>, 
Aldeburgh, Suffolk

• Saturday 24 and Sunday 25 September 2011 (fringe until 8 October)

The main event actually takes place a short drive from Aldeburgh, up the River 
Ald's estuary atSnape Maltings <http://www.snapemaltings.co.uk> (which is also 
home to Benjamin Britten's famous concert hall).

With over 90 exhibitors, you'll be able to sample delicacies from local 
producers including farms, smokehouses and brewers, and pick up culinary skills 
at demonstrations and workshops hosted by renowned foodies such asFergus 
Henderson <http://www.stjohnrestaurant.com/>, Valentine Warner 
<http://www.valentinewarner.com/> and the Guardian's own Matthew Fort 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthewfort>.

Meanwhile, there'll be fringe happenings dotted around East Suffolk throughout 
the fortnight from Saturday 24 September until Saturday 8 October, many 
continuing the educational bent of the festival. Master the art of sourdough 
bread baking at Orford's Pump house Bakery, learn about edible hedging and "the 
forgotten fruits" or enjoy an evening of local fish and chips where you meet 
the fisherman and the spud grower before the feast.

Conference <http://www.aldeburghfoodanddrink.co.uk/conference/>. This year's 
topics are "The Threat to the Sea: Pollution and Over-Exploitation", and "The
