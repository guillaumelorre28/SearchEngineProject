Today in Campaign 2016
 Donald Trump Photograph: Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images 
 * Donald Trump said today that Hillary Clinton’s plan for Syria would “lead 
to world war three 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-syria-world-war-three>
” because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed 
Russia. In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, the Republican 
presidential nominee said defeating Islamic State was a higher priority than 
persuading than Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to step down, playing down a 
long-held goal of US policy. Trump questioned how his Democratic opponent would 
negotiate with Russia’s president Vladimir Putin after having demonized him; 
blamed Barack Obama for a downturn in US relations with the Philippines under 
its new president, Rodrigo Duterte; bemoaned a lack of Republican unity behind 
his candidacy and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders 
supported him. 
 * “If we had party unity, we couldn’t lose this election to Hillary Clinton,” 
Trump said.

 * As they go to the polls in a historic presidential election, more than six 
in 10 Americans say neither major political party represents their views any 
longer, a survey has found. Dissatisfaction with both Democrats and Republicans 
has risen sharply since 1990, when less than half held that neither reflected 
their opinions, according to research by thePublic Religion Research Institute 
(PRRI) <http://www.prri.org/>.

 * A former aide to Republican governor Chris Christie reiterated today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/bridgegate-traffic-problems-email-bridget-kelly-chris-christie>
 that a now-infamous email she sent saying “time for some traffic problems” 
near the George Washington bridge in 2013 referred to a traffic study, not a 
political retaliation plot.

 * Trump implied today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/donald-trump-says-he-would-love-to-beat-up-joe-mr-tough-guy-biden>
 that he would be willing to fight the sitting vice-president Joe Biden behind 
a barn. Speaking at a rally in Tallahassee, Florida, almost precisely two weeks 
to the minute to when polls close there on election day, Trump said of a fist 
fight between the two: “I’d love that.” The 70-year-old Republican nominee for 
president also labeled the vice-president “Mr Tough Guy” and said of beating up 
the 73-year-old Biden: “Some things in life you could really love doing.”

Megyn Kelly and Newt Gingrich spar over sexual assault

Fox News host Megyn Kelly and former House speaker Newt Gingrich engaged in an 
aggressive argument tonight over lingering questions regarding Donald Trump’s 
treatment of women and how it might affect him in the coming presidential 
election, with Gingrich accusing Kelly of bias against Trump and Kelly urging 
Gingrich to “take your anger issues and spend some time working on them.”

“I’m sick and tired of people like you using language that’s inflammatory 
that’s not true!” Gingrich shouted. “I think that is exactly the bias that 
people are upset by!”

“I think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes, sir,” Kelly 
deadpanned.

“What I said is, if Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is a sexual predator, then 
it’s a big story. What we saw on that tape was Trump himself saying that he 
likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will,” Kelly 
continued, referring to a 2005 tape that showed Trump bragging about being able 
to sexually assault women with impunity because of his fame. “Then we saw ten 
women come forward after he actually denied doing it at a debate, to say ‘that 
was untrue, he did it to me; he did it to me; he did it to me.’ We saw it with 
reporters, people who had worked with him, people from Apprentice, and so on 
and so forth. He denies it it all, which is his right - we don’t know what the 
truth is.”

“My point to you is, as a media story, we don’t get to say the ten women are 
lying,” Kelly continued. “We have to cover that story, sir.”

Gingrich dismissed Kelly’s assertion, and decried the amount of focus paid on 
Trump’s sexual assault accusations.

“You are fascinated with sex, and you don’t care about public policy!” 
Gingrich responded. “And that’s what I get out of watching you tonight.”

“I’m not fascinated by sex, but I am fascinated by protection of women and 
understanding what we’re getting in the Oval Office,” Kelly retorted. “It’s not 
about me - it’s about the women and men of America, and the poll numbers show 
us that the women of America, in particular, are very concerned about these 
allegations.”

The former speaker of the House of Representatives responded by “daring” Kelly 
to call former president Bill Clinton a “sexual predator,” which Kelly ignored.

“We’re gonna have to leave it at that, and you can take your anger issues and 
spend some time working on them, Mister Speaker,” Kelly concluded.

“And you too,” Gingrich responded meekly.

The Trump campaign swiftly responded, deeming Gingrich’s appearance a success:

Scott Adams, the author behind the once-popular Dilbert cartoons, has 
published a blog post 
<http://blog.dilbert.com/post/152115888936/the-crook-versus-the-monster> in 
which he offers his qualified support of Donald Trump, but vows to assist in 
his assassination if Trump “does anything that looks even slightly Hitler-ish 
in office.”

In a post titled “The Crook Versus the Monster,” Adams argues that the public 
conception of Trump as a “monster” are misguided, but that if they prove 
accurate, Adams vows to “join the resistance movement and help kill him.”

Calling it an “easy promise to make,” Adams continues: “I hope my fellow 
citizens would use their Second Amendment rights to rise up and help me kill 
any Hitler-type person who rose to the top job in this country, no matter who 
it is.”

What could be a more suitable ending to this awful campaign than a fistfight 
betweenDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> and Joe 
Biden?
 Donald Trump. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters 
Republican nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> implied today that he would 
be willing to fight sitting vice-president Joe Biden behind a barn.

Speaking at a rally in Tallahassee, Florida 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida>, almost precisely two weeks to 
the minute to when polls close there on election day, Trump said of a fist 
fight between the two: “I’d love that.”

The 70-year-old Republican nominee for president also labeled the 
vice-president “Mr Tough Guy” and said of beating up the 73-year-old Biden, 
“Some things in life you could really love doing.”

The comments came after Biden said of Trump on Saturday: “The press always 
asks me, don’t I wish I was debating him? No, I wish we were in high school and 
I could take him behind the gym. That’s what I wish.”

Biden made the comments in reference to a lewd 2005 tape recording of Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women>
, unearthed in early October, where the Republican nominee bragged about being 
able to grab women by the genitalia without their consent.

On Monday, Biden clarified his remarks in 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/politics/joe-biden-fight-donald-trump-2016-election/>
 a rally, saying he meant “If I were in high school ... I want to make it clear 
I understand what assault is. I’m not in high school. If I were in high 
school.” The septuagenarian graduated from the Archmere Academy in Claymont, 
Delaware, in 1961.

As they go to the polls in a historic presidential election, more than six in 
10 Americans say neither major political party represents their views any 
longer, a survey has found.


Dissatisfaction with both Democrats and Republicans has risen sharply since 
1990, when less than half held that neither reflected their opinions, according 
to research by thePublic Religion Research Institute (PRRI) 
<http://www.prri.org/>.

The seventh annual 2016 American Values Survey 
<http://www.prri.org/research/divide-americas-future-1950-2050/> was carried 
out throughout September among a random sample of 2,010 adults in all 50 states.

Both party establishments have been rattled by the outsider challenges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/23/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-lead-two-headed-insurgency-against-establishment>
 of Donald Trump, who was successful in winning his party’s nomination, and 
Bernie Sanders, who was not. In a year that seems ripe for third-party 
candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party are 
seeking to capitalise but have fallen back in the polls in recent weeks.


Sixty-one per cent of survey respondents say neither political party reflects 
their opinions today, while 38% disagree. Nearly eight in 10 (77%) independents 
and a majority (54%) ofRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> took this position, while 
less than half (46%) of Democrats agree. There was virtually no variation 
across class or race.

Both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Republican standard 
bearer Trump continue to suffer historically low favourability ratings, with 
less than half of the public viewing each candidate positively (41% v 33%). 
Clinton is viewed less favourably than the Democratic party (49%), but Trump’s 
low rating is more consistent with the Republican party’s own favourability 
(36%).

The discontent with parties and candidates extends to the electoral process 
itself, which Trump claims is rigged against him. Less than half the public 
(43%) say they have a great deal of confidence that their vote will be counted 
accurately, while 38% have some confidence and 17% have hardly any confidence.

Most Americans do not feel represented by Democrats or Republicans – survey

 * Donald Trump said today that Hillary Clinton’s plan for Syria would “lead 
to world war three 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-syria-world-war-three>
” because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed 
Russia. In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, the Republican 
presidential nominee said defeating Islamic State was a higher priority than 
persuading than Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to step down, playing down a 
long-held goal of US policy. Trump questioned how his Democratic opponent would 
negotiate with Russia’s president Vladimir Putin after having demonized him; 
blamed Barack Obama for a downturn in US relations with the Philippines under 
its new president, Rodrigo Duterte; bemoaned a lack of Republican unity behind 
his candidacy and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders 
supported him. 
 * “If we had party unity, we couldn’t lose this election to Hillary Clinton,” 
Trump said.

 * As they go to the polls in a historic presidential election, more than six 
in 10 Americans say neither major political party represents their views any 
longer, a survey has found. Dissatisfaction with both Democrats and Republicans 
has risen sharply since 1990, when less than half held that neither reflected 
their opinions, according to research by thePublic Religion Research Institute 
(PRRI) <http://www.prri.org/>.

 * A former aide to Republican governor Chris Christie reiterated today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/bridgegate-traffic-problems-email-bridget-kelly-chris-christie>
 that a now-infamous email she sent saying “time for some traffic problems” 
near the George Washington bridge in 2013 referred to a traffic study, not a 
political retaliation plot.

 * Trump implied today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/donald-trump-says-he-would-love-to-beat-up-joe-mr-tough-guy-biden>
 that he would be willing to fight the sitting vice-president Joe Biden behind 
a barn. Speaking at a rally in Tallahassee, Florida, almost precisely two weeks 
to the minute to when polls close there on election day, Trump said of a fist 
fight between the two: “I’d love that.” The 70-year-old Republican nominee for 
president also labeled the vice-president “Mr Tough Guy” and said of beating up 
the 73-year-old Biden: “Some things in life you could really love doing.”  
Fox News host Megyn Kelly and former House speaker Newt Gingrich engaged in an 
aggressive argument tonight over lingering questions regarding Donald Trump’s 
treatment of women and how it might affect him in the coming presidential 
election, with Gingrich accusing Kelly of bias against Trump and Kelly urging 
Gingrich to “take your anger issues and spend some time working on them.”

“I’m sick and tired of people like you using language that’s inflammatory 
that’s not true!” Gingrich shouted. “I think that is exactly the bias that 
people are upset by!”

“I think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes, sir,” Kelly 
deadpanned.

“What I said is, if Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is a sexual predator, then 
it’s a big story. What we saw on that tape was Trump himself saying that he 
likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will,” Kelly 
continued, referring to a 2005 tape that showed Trump bragging about being able 
to sexually assault women with impunity because of his fame. “Then we saw ten 
women come forward after he actually denied doing it at a debate, to say ‘that 
was untrue, he did it to me; he did it to me; he did it to me.’ We saw it with 
reporters, people who had worked with him, people from Apprentice, and so on 
and so forth. He denies it it all, which is his right - we don’t know what the 
truth is.”

“My point to you is, as a media story, we don’t get to say the ten women are 
lying,” Kelly continued. “We have to cover that story, sir.”

Gingrich dismissed Kelly’s assertion, and decried the amount of focus paid on 
Trump’s sexual assault accusations.

“You are fascinated with sex, and you don’t care about public policy!” 
Gingrich responded. “And that’s what I get out of watching you tonight.”

“I’m not fascinated by sex, but I am fascinated by protection of women and 
understanding what we’re getting in the Oval Office,” Kelly retorted. “It’s not 
about me - it’s about the women and men of America, and the poll numbers show 
us that the women of America, in particular, are very concerned about these 
allegations.”

The former speaker of the House of Representatives responded by “daring” Kelly 
to call former president Bill Clinton a “sexual predator,” which Kelly ignored.

“We’re gonna have to leave it at that, and you can take your anger issues and 
spend some time working on them, Mister Speaker,” Kelly concluded.

“And you too,” Gingrich responded meekly.

The Trump campaign swiftly responded, deeming Gingrich’s appearance a success:

Scott Adams, the author behind the once-popular Dilbert cartoons, has 
published a blog post 
<http://blog.dilbert.com/post/152115888936/the-crook-versus-the-monster> in 
which he offers his qualified support of Donald Trump, but vows to assist in 
his assassination if Trump “does anything that looks even slightly Hitler-ish 
in office.”

In a post titled “The Crook Versus the Monster,” Adams argues that the public 
conception of Trump as a “monster” are misguided, but that if they prove 
accurate, Adams vows to “join the resistance movement and help kill him.”

Calling it an “easy promise to make,” Adams continues: “I hope my fellow 
citizens would use their Second Amendment rights to rise up and help me kill 
any Hitler-type person who rose to the top job in this country, no matter who 
it is.”

Republican nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> implied today that he would 
be willing to fight sitting vice-president Joe Biden behind a barn.

Speaking at a rally in Tallahassee, Florida 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida>, almost precisely two weeks to 
the minute to when polls close there on election day, Trump said of a fist 
fight between the two: “I’d love that.”

The 70-year-old Republican nominee for president also labeled the 
vice-president “Mr Tough Guy” and said of beating up the 73-year-old Biden, 
“Some things in life you could really love doing.”

The comments came after Biden said of Trump on Saturday: “The press always 
asks me, don’t I wish I was debating him? No, I wish we were in high school and 
I could take him behind the gym. That’s what I wish.”

Biden made the comments in reference to a lewd 2005 tape recording of Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women>
, unearthed in early October, where the Republican nominee bragged about being 
able to grab women by the genitalia without their consent.

On Monday, Biden clarified his remarks in 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/politics/joe-biden-fight-donald-trump-2016-election/>
 a rally, saying he meant “If I were in high school ... I want to make it clear 
I understand what assault is. I’m not in high school. If I were in high 
school.” The septuagenarian graduated from the Archmere Academy in Claymont, 
Delaware, in 1961.

This is literally on the US citizenship test:
 
As they go to the polls in a historic presidential election, more than six in 
10 Americans say neither major political party represents their views any 
longer, a survey has found.


Dissatisfaction with both Democrats and Republicans has risen sharply since 
1990, when less than half held that neither reflected their opinions, according 
to research by thePublic Religion Research Institute (PRRI) 
<http://www.prri.org/>.

The seventh annual 2016 American Values Survey 
<http://www.prri.org/research/divide-americas-future-1950-2050/> was carried 
out throughout September among a random sample of 2,010 adults in all 50 states.

Both party establishments have been rattled by the outsider challenges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/23/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-lead-two-headed-insurgency-against-establishment>
 of Donald Trump, who was successful in winning his party’s nomination, and 
Bernie Sanders, who was not. In a year that seems ripe for third-party 
candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party are 
seeking to capitalise but have fallen back in the polls in recent weeks.


Sixty-one per cent of survey respondents say neither political party reflects 
their opinions today, while 38% disagree. Nearly eight in 10 (77%) independents 
and a majority (54%) ofRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> took this position, while 
less than half (46%) of Democrats agree. There was virtually no variation 
across class or race.

Both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Republican standard 
bearer Trump continue to suffer historically low favourability ratings, with 
less than half of the public viewing each candidate positively (41% v 33%). 
Clinton is viewed less favourably than the Democratic party (49%), but Trump’s 
low rating is more consistent with the Republican party’s own favourability 
(36%).

The discontent with parties and candidates extends to the electoral process 
itself, which Trump claims is rigged against him. Less than half the public 
(43%) say they have a great deal of confidence that their vote will be counted 
accurately, while 38% have some confidence and 17% have hardly any confidence.
