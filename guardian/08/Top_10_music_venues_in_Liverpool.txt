East Village Arts Club (Evac)

Seel Street's granddaddy of live music has always been the squat structure 
that is three-quarters of the way up the hill, known by various generations as 
the Barfly, the Masque, and now East Village Arts Club. The spiritual home of 
[DJ] Yousef's evergreen club night Circus (and its little brother Chibuku), 
Evac was given a new lease of life when it was refurbished and reopened in 
2013. The venue's banked and red-draped main room (the Theatre) hosts the 
majority of its live shows and when it's swarming with bodies it is arguably 
the best room in Liverpool for watching live music.

The Kazimier
 Kazimier, Liverpool 
"Impossible is nothing" should be the mantra of the team behind The Kazimier, 
the most inventive collective of musicians, artists, performers and madcap 
creatives the city has seen for some time. Having overseen the venue's 
transformation from dubious footballers' hangout in the 1990s to one of the 
country's most talked-about live music venues, the team has also helped breathe 
new life in to the previously undesirable area around Wolstenholme Square. 
Promoters queue up to host their shows at "The Kaz", hoping that a bit of its 
creative magic rubs off; but it's The Kazimier's own flamboyant special events 
(built around performances from in-house bands Dogshow and The Kazimier Krunk 
Band) that showcase this unique theatre-cum-club-cum-speakeasy at its 
jaw-dropping best.

Sound Food and Drink

A former cafe on the edge of the Ropewalks, Sound was born from the ashes of 
Le Bateau, a club that ran a mean line in alternative and indie music for 
nocturnal revellers who wanted to dance to Joy Division. Not to be deterred 
when Le Bateau shut down, the team behind its most popular night, Liquidation, 
moved a couple of doors along Duke Street to open Sound, and have given the 
thoroughfare's usual soundtrack a much-needed shot in the arm. The in-house DJs 
are among the city's more trusted noiseniks, and it complements its offerings 
by cramming a variety of live acts on to the stage throughout the week.

The Caledonia

In the area that was once the playground of The Scaffold 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scaffold>, Allen Ginsberg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/allen-ginsberg> and Deaf School's art rock 
crowd, The Cali's recent booming trade has been built on its reputation for 
live jazz, rockabillly and good time music on pretty much every night of the 
week. Though just outside of L8, the Catharine Street boozer is still seen 
(alongside The Grapes) as upholding the area's tradition for rootsy live music. 
Always cosy and stocked with good beer, The Cali's living room-esque warmth is 
at its most welcoming when regularsThe Loose Moose String Band 
<https://www.facebook.com/loosemoosestringband> are in full flow (alternate 
Sundays).
• 22 Caledonia Street, 0151 708 0235, thecaledonialiverpool.com

Fri-Sat midnight-1am

The Shipping Forecast
 Shipping Forecast, Liverpool Photograph: Shipping Forecast 
Slater Street's dirty little secret, the Shipping Forecast is the antithesis 
to the seething stag- and hen-do circus in which it finds itself mired, but 
manages to maintain a discreet distance thanks to a selective door policy. 
Exuding the same retro-chic charm as the chain's other outlets (Leeds' A Nation 
of Shopkeepers <http://www.anationofshopkeepers.com/> and Sheffield's Bungalows 
and Bears <http://www.bungalowsandbears.com/>), "The Ship" is rarely quiet; now 
operating over three floors, the bar and new mezzanine level are taken care of 
by good booze, food and DJs, while downstairs the Hold hosts a jam-packed 
calendar of live gigs and club nights, with Abandon Silence the jewel in its 
crown.

Studio2 Parr Street/The Attic
 Parr Street, The Attic, Liverpool 
The Parr Street Studios complex shouldn't have room to fit two bustling bars 
alongside its boutique hotel and Grammy-award-winning studio (Coldplay, Elbow, 
er … Barry Manilow) – somehow it manages to do so, and with a panache that 
befits the studio's formidable reputation. Studio2 is an exact replica of the 
gorgeously wood-panelled Studio 1 live room next door, except with a 
well-stocked bar and weekly jazz and acoustic nights. Upstairs, the Attic 
caters for the late-night bar dweller who wants a good playlist of soul, funk 
and indie to while away the hours to, hidden from the bright lights and harsh 
sounds of the city centre.
• Studio 2, 33-45 Parr Street, 0151 707 3727, studio2liverpool.com 
<http://studio2liverpool.com/>. Open Tues 7pm-2am, Fri-Sun 5pm-2am. The Attic,

Tues-Thurs 5pm-midnight, Fri-Sat 12.30pm-3am, Sun midday-midnight

Maguire's Pizza Bar
 Maguires, Liverpool 
Rough, ready and rad, Maguire's is fast becoming the DIY hangout of choice for 
the hyphenated punk brigade (post-punk, indie-punk, blues-punk, math-punk, 
goth-punk, post-post-punk, etc). You won't find chintzy lampshades and 
post-naff decor adorning these walls though: instead, Maguire's opts for a 
no-nonsense approach, and shows that running a successful bar needn't be a 
complicated operation (open door, serve beer, rock). The back room is reserved 
for live shows and has everything it needs and nothing more: a PA, the merest 
hint of a stage, and enough space for a moshpit. The pizza's pretty nifty too, 
in case you were wondering.
• 77 Renshaw Street, 07535 090636, Facebook page 
<https://www.facebook.com/MaguiresPizzaBar>. Open Mon 4pm-10pm, Weds-Thurs 
4pm-10pm, Fri-Sun 4pm-midnight

The Dovedale Towers
 Dovedale, Liverpool 
Couched in its mismatched grandeur of bare mahogany and white-tiled walls, 
"The Dovey" brings a certain polished sheen to that very scouse institution of 
going down the pub expecting to see "a turn" on, by engaging with the city's 
vibrant music scene. The Penny Lane boozer's Thursday night Dovedale Social 
events have seen some of the best local musicians entertaining the south 
Liverpool natives (fromthe Tea Street Band 
<https://www.facebook.com/TeaStreetBand> to precocious youngster Dominic Dunn 
<https://www.facebook.com/Dominic.Dunn22>), thus offering a robust alternative 
to those who sometimes find the Ropewalks a little too familiar. The hearty 
selection of pies and beers does no harm either.
• 60 Penny Lane, 0151 4750642, no website. Open Mon-Fri midday-11pm, Sat-Sun 
11am-11pm

Philharmonic Hall
 Philharmonic, Liverpool 
Hope Street's venerable art deco concert hall is one of the city's more 
memorable buildings, the fawn-coloured bricks lending the turreted venue an air 
of nobility as it gazes serenely down the hill towards the centre of town. It 
is home to the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra but consistently proves 
that it's capable of going beyond orchestral manoeuvres: recent years have seen
Bobby Womack <https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobby-womack>, Rufus Wainwright 
<http://www.rufuswainwright.com/> and Rodriguez 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/sep/03/sixto-rodriguez-sugar-man-returns>
 revelling in its delicious acoustics. Pre-show, there's always the chance to 
engage in a bit more opulence by nipping over the road to thePhilharmonic 
Dining Rooms 
<http://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/thephilharmonicdiningroomsliverpool/> for a 
pint, where, legend has it, Hitler once stopped for a toilet break.

HAUS
 HAUS, Liverpool 
If the Baltic Triangle is the future hub of the city, then Greenland Street 
could easily be its Seel Street. The city's former industrial heartland pulses 
to a new beat nowadays, and HAUS is helping to lead the revolution. Run by 
Waxxx – a team of promoters and DJs specialising in house, garage and techno 
club nights, with the occasional foray into publishing – the roomy warehouse 
space hosts a variety of events, with an emphasis on reappropriating late-night 
rave culture. Either that or they just want to put on a great party. As a warm 
up toGottwood's underground electronic music festival 
<http://www.gottwood.co.uk/> in the woods, Waxxx is teaming up with Red Bull 
Music Academy 
<http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/events/rbma-x-gottwood-liverpool> to bring 
a weighty lineup of house and techno artists to HAUS, as well as all manner of 
woodland props.
