It’s great when art and sport come together. As an artist, I felt part of 
London 2012: whena print I made was selected to represent Team GB in the 
Paralympics 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/london-2012-olympic-and-paralympic-games-posters>
, I felt very proud – and I screamed my head off when [track athlete] David 
Weir won gold. Rio may not be as close to my studio as the Stratford Olympic 
park, but I’ll be willing Team GB on. And my print will be telling everyone: 
“True love always wins.”

This was a curious commission, given the constraints that surround the Olympic 
symbol – namely, the fact that you’re not actually allowed to use it. Well, 
maybe you can’t make direct reference to the rings, but fine art is all about 
being oblique, so I decided to take the Olympic torch and turn it into an ice 
cream.

I like the notion of the Cultural Olympiad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/cultural-olympiad>. Artists tend to be a 
bunch of non-sporty dweebs so it’s nice to be involved somehow. I did one or 
two things for the London Games. I think I designed some mugs or something.

The Olympics is one of those things you just end up watching. I’m never 
enthusiastic to start with, but then I get hooked. The other week, I was 
watching that documentary about Danny Boyle’s opening ceremony and it took me 
back: 2012 was a big year for me too, as I hada huge show at the Hayward 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/05/david-shrigley-brain-activity-review>
. But time goes past like an egg yolk down a plughole.

I’ve been working on hand-cut collages for a year now. It’s just been me 
sitting there in my studio, quietly working away with my scissors, enjoying the 
first time I’ve had to myself since finishingFifty Shades of Grey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey>. I needed something 
meditative. I wanted to be creative and answer to no one else.

Although there are elements that link this print to my old work, it’s really 
about my new life in California. The guy on the rock could be in Rio, but the 
photo was actually taken in the Joshua Tree national park. I went camping there 
and took pictures of various rocks while out on walks or drives. It’s a very 
spiritual place, Joshua Tree. It feels very wild and at the same time very 
still, which I really like, or really need – or really needed after Fifty. That 
silence.

I hike to my new studio in the California hills. That sounds so romantic, I 
know, and it is. So there are lots of natural elements in this picture, 
vegetation and trees and things. The balloons are the Brazilian flag, of 
course, and I thought a big rock could be a solid foundation for someone 
wanting to fulfil their dreams.

There will always be a place for the Olympics: that time to stop and watch 
people achieve incredible feats. I became quite obsessed with the swimming last 
time round.

Ever since I was a child, I have loved the Olympics, especially in the evening 
when the lights of the stadium shimmer off their perfect superhero bodies, all 
glowing with sweat. The text in my print is a literal description of watching 
athletes do their thing from the vantage point of your sofa. Of course, the 
words could also describe group sex – or a nightclub, say, that has a safe 
space for behaviour not permitted in everyday life. Bodies rubbing up against 
each other, hot, sticky and sweaty.

Rio <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rio-2016> is going to be a bitterweet 
experience. The world is so fucked up right now and Brazil seems like a 
microcosm of that, with all the politics and the health risks that are being 
reported. I saw an article the other day about how they have beenfinding dead 
bodies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/jun/30/body-parts-wash-up-on-olympic-games-beach-in-rio-video>
 and raw sewage in the water where people are going to be swimming. Wow! It 
makes you think: how is this even going to work?

I built this in my studio, using salvaged material, round mirrors, ropes and 
balls. It’s meant to suggest a place of action, the residue of performances, 
exercises or games. I think of my photographic works and installations as “head 
spaces” – physical representations of psychological states. They may seem 
peripheral, but they’re a metaphor for something within us.
