London is one of the world’s most welcoming cities when it comes to LGBTQ 
visitors. From cosy gay pubs to mind-boggling drag shows and representation in 
most of the major galleries and arts spaces, there is enough LGBTQ culture to 
keep you occupied day and night.

Despite being “cleaned up” by developers in recent years, Soho remains 
London’s gay nucleus. Its main drag, Brewer Street to Old Compton Street, still 
boasts a few sex shops, such as Prowler, and bars like the iconicG-A-Y, 
<https://www.facebook.com/G-A-Y-148376865200372/timeline/> not to mention a 
number of cafes that double as cruising grounds. Soho is quaint, if only in the 
sense thatMolly Moggs 
<https://www.facebook.com/Molly-Moggs-148111715224427/timeline/> is one of the 
few places you’ll see a drag queen get totally ignored, but it is also 
thrilling, with gay saunas such asSweatbox <http://www.sweatboxsoho.com/> just 
a stone’s throw from more upmarket spots like the Oscar Wilde-themed bar, the
Green Carnation <http://www.greencarnationlondon.com/>.

London has seen gay clubbing events spread out from the centre over the last 
decade. Hackney, for example, is taking on increasing importance as a new kind 
of gaybourhood: where LGBT establishments aren’t ghettoised but dispersed among 
other businesses. In the basement of one of Hackney’s trendiest hotels (Ace 
Hotel, Shoreditch <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/21/hotels>) is 
the club nightHard Cock Life  
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/sep/04/hard-cock-life-the-gay-club-night-turning-the-tables-on-rap-prejudice>
 – a mostly-male hip-hop night. Also in Hackney, the National Trust property
Sutton House <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sutton-house/> is the venue for 
an immersive, LGBT-friendly cinema eventAmy Grimehouse 
<http://www.amygrimehouse.com/>, and just down the road, dingy club Vogue 
Fabrics <http://vfdalston.com/>hosts both straight and gay club nights 
throughout the week.

Admittedly, London’s gay bars have been facing difficult times of late. 
Beloved LGBT venues such as The Joiners Arms in Shoreditch and the Black Cap in 
Camden have closed due to soaring rents (both were in prime real estate 
locations) and stringent changes in local council policies. Yet, as new 
ventures and activities for LGBT communities pop up each month, often in what 
are traditionally heteronormative venues, it is becoming clear that there’s 
more to be enjoyed in gay London than ever before.

 Hot, hot, hot … John Sizzle, co-founder of The Glory, Haggerston, east London 
A glittering jewel has finally been placed atop the rusted crown of east 
London: gay pubThe Glory,  <http://www.theglory.co/>which was recently opened 
by two of the founding members of Gay Bingo, legendary drag queens Jonny Woo 
and John Sizzle. Here you can find entertainment on almost every night of the 
week. Faggy-Okay is its Thursday night karaoke phenomenon, hosted by the divine 
Ginger Johnson. Freaky Fridays is when it opens up, or rather permits thee to 
descend … to the HOLE: a black basement of undiluted comic queer terrorism and 
dancing with no holds barred!

 Showstopper … Sink the Pink 
If you want a drag blow out, there’s only one place to go: Sink the Pink 
<http://www.sinkthepink.co.uk/>, about to celebrate its sixth birthday. There 
are few drag nights operating on this scale (and scales would make a rather 
appropriate outfit one feels) – think catwalks and dance shows galore, every 
third Saturday of the month. Afterwards, we all go to Metropolis, a 
pole-dancing club – over three floors – subject to a transvestite takeover 
until 5am.

What I’d really recommend is finding all these floozies (that is, the queens 
themselves) on Facebook. Hunt out and harass:A Man to Pet

 Party in the Dalston Superstore club. Photograph: Alamy 
I maintain that London’s LGBT scene is as vibrant as ever. The after-hours 
counterpart to G-A-Y (G-A-Y Late) has quickly replaced the Joiners Arms as 
London’s trashy gay bar of choice, where everyone is invited. Plus, the drinks 
at G-A-Y are particularly cheap from Sunday to Thursday.

I have a long-term soft spot for the bar, cafe and club Dalston Superstore 
<http://dalstonsuperstore.com/> in east London, which has always set a high 
benchmark for good DJs and live music – from Berlin’s Planning to Rock to Texas 
drag export Christeene. It has served as a truly welcoming queer space for gay 
people, straight people, trans people and just about everyone else since it 
opened in 2009. You can even dance on the bar.

When it comes to spaces for queer girls, Pitch Slap! 
<https://www.facebook.com/groups/pitchslaplondon/> is a current favourite. 
Dalston Superstore’s “weekly lez off”Clam Jam 
<https://www.facebook.com/clam.jam.37?fref=ts&__mref=message_bubble> is 
excellent for meeting people, and Holla! at the Hoxton pubthe Macbeth  
<http://www.themacbeth.co.uk/>is also worth a punt. However, hidden Soho gem 
Boi Box <https://www.facebook.com/boibox> is my top tip, with its small family 
of drag kings putting on riotous monthly performances at She Bar.

If you’re looking for a cute gay pub to have a quiet drink, there are a few 
nice old-fashioned spots outside the city centre.The George and Dragon in 
Greenwich <http://www.georgedragon.com/>is a stereotypically English pub with a 
big gay cabaret twist. TheRichmond Arms 
<https://www.facebook.com/Richmond-Arms-145378148813502/timeline/> in Richmond 
is friendly, and theKing William IV <http://www.kingwilliamhampstead.co.uk/> in 
Hampstead – one of the oldest gay bars in the city – attracts regulars and 
tourists, with a really delicious creperie next door if you’re feeling hungry.

 Party at Fire, Vauxhall 
Vauxhall has, for some time now, been a destination for gay clubbing that goes 
on and on … and on. A venue calledFire <http://www.firelondon.net/> is just 
about the closest London clubbing gets to Berlin. It has always been a 
favourite spot for guys who prefer to wear their T-shirt tucked into their 
waistband than on their actual person. Just around the corner, longstanding 
club nightHorse Meat Disco  
<https://www.facebook.com/Horse-Meat-Disco-128638804936/timeline/>never fails 
to play anything short of brilliant disco and house music. And, if you feel 
like venturing even further south,Bootylicious 
<http://bootylicious-club.co.uk/index.php> at the Electric in Brixton is a 
great feelgood night where people of all backgrounds can express themselves.

 Club Kali at the Dome, Kentish Town 
Off the grid a bit, are Club Kali  <http://clubkali.com/>at the Dome in 
Kentish Town andResistance Gallery <http://www.resistancegallery.com/> in 
Bethnal Green. The former is really popular among London’s LGBTQ Asian 
community. The latter is an arts space that is also an unruly party venue – 
check out the night Transisters, which describes itself as “trans queer 
sexually diverse hot pot for the polygendered liberated party people club 
night”. I’m sold on that. Also at Resistance Gallery is the club night Debbie, 
which only has one rule: no music plays that doesn’t have a female vocal.

Finally, no clubbing guide would be complete without a mention of East Bloc 
<https://twitter.com/eastbloc1>, near Old Street tube station, with its 
pounding music, dark corners and doors open until daylight – this is where all 
good nights go to end.

 The BFI on London’s South Bank hosts an annual LGBT film festival, Flare 
London’s queer arts scene and cultural spectrum has grown rapidly in recent 
years, with newly-formed events and spaces celebrating the panoply of 
sexuality, gender diversity and LGBT people of colour. Esteemed institutions 
such as the ICA and Tate Modern curate and programme queer content, and outside 
of this many independent festivals, art collectives, smaller galleries and 
individuals are taking it upon themselves to create space for queer political 
voices.

The BFI Flare <http://www.bfi.org.uk/flare>, “Britain’s longest running and 
most popular LGBT film festival”, celebrated its 28th edition this year. Flare 
offers an extensive programme – one that I think values emerging filmmakers as 
highly as regular festival luminaries. The introductions to films and director 
Q&As provide a more intimate layer to the film going experience – for a taste, 
check out Desiree Akhavan and Carol Morley’s Q&As from this year on theBFI 
Player 
<http://player.bfi.org.uk/collections/bfi-flare-london-lgbt-film-festival-presents/bfi-flare-presents/>
.

Club des Femmes  <http://www.clubdesfemmes.com/>is a more off-the-map queer, 
feminist collective that curates film screenings and events. Expect 
transgressive films, critical re-examinings of mainstream structures, an 
enthusiastic audience and intimate dialogues with filmmakers. It’s also 
definitely worth checking outFringe! Queer Art and Festival 
<http://fringefilmfest.com/>, east London’s grassroots answer to Flare, which 
takes place annually, in November. The weekend festival puts critically 
acclaimed arthouse features alongside films from the margins, including erotica 
and experimental works. It’s expansive, with workshops, performances and party 
events that support new and local talent. It’s also very accessible: with free 
events and diverse representation in its programming.

If you’re looking for queer representation in London’s galleries, look no 
further thanArcadia Missa <http://www.arcadiamissa.com/index.php/am--artists/>, 
a Peckham-based enterprise with a dedicated focus on “contemporary art with 
intent”. Similarly,LimaZulu <http://www.limazulu.co.uk/>, a non-commercial 
gallery in Tottenham Hale, provides a platform for a number of queer and 
gender-queer artists.
