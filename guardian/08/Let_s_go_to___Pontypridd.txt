Why go now?

For a free swim at the National Lido of Wales 
<http://www2.rctcbc.gov.uk/en/lido/home.aspx>, the country’s only lido, which 
is opening from 25 March to 10 April (then reopening for the summer). The £6.3m 
restoration project has transformed the 1927 lido, while retaining original 
features such as turnstiles and wooden changing cubicles. There are three 
heated pools – including an activity pool with stand-up paddleboarding and 
zorbing – plus an adventure play area, waterside cafe and heritage museum.

What else is there to do?

Anywhere good to eat?

The Prince’s <http://www.princesbakery.com/>, a restaurant and bakery 
established in 1948, has an art deco interior and is still run by the same 
family; try the retro corned beef wedge or the bargain afternoon tea (£9.95 or 
£14.95 with prosecco).

How about a drink?

The Bunch of Grapes <http://bunchofgrapes.org.uk> serves its own Otley Brewing 
Company <http://www.otleybrewing.co.uk/> beers, plus other cask and keg craft 
beers, ciders and spirits. It also does fantastic food, using homegrown 
vegetables and meat from within a 30-mile radius, such as Blaengwawr lamb with 
hay-roasted lamb belly goujons and stout sauce.
