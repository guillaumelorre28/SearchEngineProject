There’s a certain type of person who is snobby about package holidays. I am 
not one of those people. Bargains excite me, so naturally I love a package 
holiday, and go on at least two a year, usually from Teletext holidays, a 
website with which I have been having an obsessive affair for several years 
now. Granted, there’s nothing particularly edgy or intrepid about a taking a 
Thomas Cook flight, hopping on an airport transfer bus, and washing down an 
all-you-can-eat buffet with a pina colada, followed by a fag on a sun lounger. 
But my god, it is cheap.

Budget airlines and accommodation websites such as Airbnb have transformed the 
way we travel. As a result, the humble package holiday, which revolutionised 
foreign travel for millions of Brits in the 1960s and 70s, has become somewhat 
unfashionable and seen as, to use a horrible word,“common”. There’s certainly a 
class element to these negative perceptions. The sort of people who rent 
cottages in Cornwall or large houses in the south of France are always asking 
me, in a slightly snide way, when I’m off on another one of my Teletext jaunts. 
But more fool them. Two weeks on a Greek island for £150 including flights? 
Don’t mind if I do.

 Rhiannon snapped up a two-week package to Malia, Crete, for about £150. 
Growing up, we never went on holiday. We just didn’t have the money, and my 
brother is autistic so doesn’t travel well. Every summer, all my friends would 
go on package holidays to Spain and would come back bronzed and with 
brightly-coloured hair braids, speaking with worldly authority about paella and 
knowing all the words to Whigfield. As a result, holiday brochures were like 
crack to me. I used to get them from travel agents on the high street and hoard 
them at home, spending hours flicking through them as I selected my perfect 
package holiday (always in the hotel with the most extensive and elaborate 
waterslide system).


Then, when I was 12, my dreams came true – a holiday to Cyprus with my dad, 
courtesy of the trauma wrought by parental separation. I went parasailing, 
discovered pineapple juice, killed it (or imagined I did) on the karaoke and, 
most amazingly, got the boat to Egypt to see Tutankhamun’s death mask and the 
Pyramids. It must have been then that the thought struck me: holiday packages 
can be an incredible – and affordable - way to get around. A few years after 
Cyprus, I went to Zante with my mum and, despite having to wear a sarong the 
whole time due to an unfortunate case of ringworm, fell in love with Greece. 
That was it; I was hooked.

 Rhiannon on holiday in Paros, Greece 
I accept that the rooms are sometimes a bit naff, but a package holiday is 
really what you make it. And the deals are often so cheap they cost less than 
the flight alone would be if booked separately. At secondary school, my friend 
Amy would go on about four package holidays a year, and it was she who 
introduced me to the websiteIcelolly.com <https://www.icelolly.com/> and the 
glorious institution that is Teletext Holidays. With the latter, you had to sit 
in front of the television, waiting for the page of neon texted deals to change 
until the one you fancied appeared. Sensibly, Teletext Holidays then moved 
online, but a lot of people are unaware that it still exists, let alone that it 
is as bargainous as it always was.

A couple of years ago, my boyfriend and I wanted to go to Greece, so snapped 
up a two-week package to Malia in Crete for about £150 for flights, transfers 
and hotel. The hotel was appalling, there were stains on the sheets, and the 
constant pumping of drum and bass from the club next door meant we couldn’t get 
any sleep. Malia, with its very own branch of revolving dancefloor nostalgia 
emporium Reflex, was definitely not our scene (though it should be stated that 
the old town is beautiful and the shots are free), but we didn’t care because 
we were off island-hopping. We explained to hotel owner Giorgio (who didn’t 
give a toss what we did as long as he still got paid) that we would be back him 
in two weeks, and we set sail for Paros, Antiparos, and Santorini.

A package deal was also how we got to Cuba earlier this year on a shoestring 
budget. Yes, the all-inclusive hotel was like something from the series Mad 
Men, the 70s years (the “entertainment” included making a monkey ride a goat 
like a horse) but because we incorporated Havana, Cienfuegos, Trinidad and 
Topes de Collantes into our visit, we were able to experience this fascinating 
country at a time when demand is extremely high and the cost of flights 
prohibitive.


I should also add that sunlounger holidays are not the only kind on offer on 
sites like Teletext. Last year, we did four days’ half-board in a hotel in a 
Tuscan spa town. Though we were the youngest guests at the place by decades, 
the restaurant produced sensational food, seven courses of which we were 
expected to eat every night. They were some of the best meals of my life. Not 
bad on a budget.

Who knows where I’ll go next? A Teletext holiday is often a last-minute 
decision … I see they’ve got two weeks at the beach in Mexico later this month 
for £660. I’m already wondering how far it is from Chichen Itza ...

Icelolly.com <https://www.icelolly.com/>
This holiday comparison website used to be a simple search engine, but is now 
a slick operation that claims to allow you to compare over 80 million holidays. 
It currently has winter sun deals in the Algarve starting at £69pp, though I 
would avoid their American city breaks unless you have a fondness for airport 
hotels.

Teletext holidays <http://www.teletextholidays.co.uk/>
Not the most up-to-date site, but the sheer range of bargains makes this a 
favourite, and they are always extremely helpful on the phone when booking. 
Best for beachy getaways and short European breaks, as well as some incredible 
last-minute deals. I’ve been using them for years and they haven’t done me 
wrong yet.

On the beach <https://www.onthebeach.co.uk>
This independent website doesn’t build package beach holidays for you, but it 
does allow you to essentially build your own by searching for cheap flights, 
hotels/apartments and transfers all in one place. It price-checks every month 
against high street travel agents, and claims it can sell holidays for up to 
50% cheaper than its competitors.

Lowcostholidays <http://www.lowcostholidays.com/>
Another budget favourite, with a mix of beach, city and exotic holidays to 
choose from, and allowing you to mix and match your flights, resulting in a 
self-built package with times and dates to suit.

Olympic Holidays <http://www.olympicholidays.com/>
This specialist in Greece and Cyprus also offers package holidays to other 
locations, including Malta, Turkey, Bulgaria, Spain, Gambia and Goa. I find it 
particularly useful when looking to visit Greek islands without airports: a 
short ferry ride from package mecca Skiathos, for example, is wonderfully 
tranquil Skopelos, which was a particularly memorable.
