Why now?
To be scared silly. The spooky, 500-year-old Priestgate Vaults 
<http://www.vivacity-peterborough.com/museums-and-heritage/priestgatevaults/> 
under Peterborough Museum opened for regular tours for the first time on 24 
October in time for Halloween (£4). Other ghoulish fun at the museum includes 
candlelit ghost hunts, gory stories and horror nights, and there are ghost 
walks around the city centre.

What else is there to do?
Peterborough’s Norman cathedral rivals those of Ely and Durham, but has far 
fewer visitors. The best way to explore is ona tower tour 
<http://www.peterborough-cathedral.org.uk/home/visiting/book-a-cathedral-tour/tower-tours.aspx>
 (£15, 28 and 31 October). Theheritage trail 
<http://www.visitpeterborough.com/PeterboroughHeritage.aspx> is a short walking 
route linking the cathedral with other historic buildings, including the 
guildhall and the town hall. The 1930s Westgate shopping arcade was refurbished 
this summer. Further afield, ride a steam train on theNene Valley Railway 
<http://www.nvr.org.uk/> – special events include a steampunk murder mystery 
<http://www.steampunkstamford.co.uk/> for Halloween – or visit Burghley House 
<http://www.burghley.co.uk/>, an Elizabethan house with gardens by Capability 
Brown.
