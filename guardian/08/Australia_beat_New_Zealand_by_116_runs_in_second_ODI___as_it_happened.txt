Australia regain the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy

Man of the match is David Warner after his big ton this afternoon. “It was a 
fantastic wicket, it always is here at Manuka,” he says to Mark Nicholas. “The 
other day I played a bit of a lazy stroke but today I knuckled down and it was 
a good wicket to do it on.”

It was his sixth ODI ton this year. “It was the format that I thought wasn’t 
my greatest,” he reflects. Well, it is right now.

Kane Williamson, Black Caps skipper, is next up. “The perfect performance 
really,” he observes of Australia. True enough. He acknowledges that sending 
Australia in probably wasn’t a great call.

Last of all, Steve Smith who agrees it was a top performance from his side, 
thrilled with his batsmen. “I was going to bat,” he says of the Williamson 
decision at the toss. When talking about his bowlers he’s especially happy with 
Cummins performance, who he believes took confidence from his final spell on 
Sunday.

WICKET! AUSTRALIA WIN BY 116 RUNS! Watling c Warner b Faulkner 17 (New Zealand 
all out 262)

That’ll do it. The man who made the match-winning ton takes the catch at 
cover, to a top edge won by the bowler Faulkner to get him a second wicket. A 
good comeback from him after a challenging start this evening. And with that, 
Australia have won back the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. Back with the presentation 
and some final thoughts in a couple of minutes.

47th over: New Zealand 262-9 (Watling 17, Boult 2) Target 379. Can Hazlewood 
finish this off? He deserves a third. Urgh, he can’t. This is grim. Please let 
this not go the distance.

46th over: New Zealand 255-9 (Watling 11, Boult 1) Target 379. It’ll be 
4-for-41 for Cummins, unable to remove Boult despite his best efforts. 
Block-hole bouncers, well-executed slower balls; but all kept out, one way or 
another. He even gets a single to the last ball, retaining the strike. Fair 
play to him. No one in Australia is tweeting about this game anymore. We’re the 
only people left. You, dear reader, and me. You and me.
 Just us.

WICKET! Henry c Faulkner b Cummins 7 (New Zealand 254-9)

Henry’s had a crack at putting it over midwicket and it is an admirable 
effort, but it can’t get it beyond James Faulkner patrolling the boundary out 
there. Nicely taken. A fourth to Cummins. Thrilled for him. He gets five balls 
at Trent Boult for a five-for. On the evidence of watching this (lovely) man 
bat over the years, I’m backing the bowler.

45th over: New Zealand 254-8 (Watling 11, Henry 7) Target 379. Don’t judge me 
for this being quick. There’s a wicket to deal with in the future. This is like 
Back to the Future and I have a copy of Gray’s Sports Almanac. Starc kept 
bowling yorkers and they kept avoiding the stumps. That’s the main take out,

44th over: New Zealand 250-8 (Watling 10, Henry 4) Target 379. Slogs and 
inside edges and plays and misses. All told, Cummins unlucky not to have his 
fourth and even fifth. He has an over to go, so provided Starc doesn’t finish 
it off himself a five-for is still on the shelf for him and that really would 
be an excellent story.

Casting forward, this might be significant leading into the Pakistan Test 
series. Having watched Yasir close up in England this winter I can assure you 
he’s an absolute treat.

advised two days rest by the docs,wont play the warm up game.

Henry. Dot. Single. Dot. Dot. Single. Dot. Was it as good for you as it was for 
me? Time to make it stop, fellas. Two in a hurry. Thanks. 9173 people at Manuka

42nd over: New Zealand 244-8 (Watling 8, Henry 0) Target 379. Almost feels a 
waste to write a post on one ball alone? It’s nearly a chop on, Watling getting 
on it very late. Anyway, let’s make it worth your while. This song came up 
today on twitter due to the fact that I came to the office this morning on the 
back of a motor bike. Well, it was a motor scooter. But anyway. Sydney? Back of 
a bike? Looking for Alibrandi? Yeah, worked better in my head than it did on 
twitter. Have this anyway.
 I am Pia Miranda in that comparison, in case you were wondering. Facebook

WICKET! Southee c Bailey b Cummins 2 (New Zealand 243-8)

It is going to be a huge win for Australia very soon here. Pat Cummins has a 
third, a return he has deserved with some solid fast bowling in conditions 
where it isn’t always easy to bowl quick. On this occasion Southee is trying to 
pull, but he can’t get into position in time, a top edge to midwicket the 
outcome. Pace and bounce.

WICKET! Santner b Starc 2 (New Zealand 236-7)

Oh yeah, that’s Mitchell Starc 101. Santner tries to make room to the wrong 
delivery, an on-target yorker. So it’s the very familiar clatter of stumps that 
Starc generates basically much every time he plays for Australia, regardless of 
format or any other variable.

40th over: New Zealand 234-6 (Santner 1, Watling 1) Target 379. Cummins much 
better tonight. The first ball to Watling is a bouncer on his helmet badge. 
Scary-quick. A single each all they’re able to find in the successful over. 
Final power play begins now, meaning a fifth man can be stationed outside the 
ring. And New Zealand require 15 an over to win. Draw your own conclusions.

WICKET! Williamson c Warner b Cummins 81 (New Zealand 232-6)

Cummins’ slower ball gets him a second wicket. Effective on Sunday towards the 
end, and again here in Canberra winning an error from Williamson, who finally 
gives it away after a long shift tonight in a chase they were never really in. 
Warner takes the catch at cover. He tried to flay it over the ring from 
slightly short of a length, but went straight to the afternoon’s century-maker.

39th over: New Zealand 232-5 (Williamson 80, Santner 0) Target 379. Before the 
wicket Bailey jumped high at short cover but can’t reach the Williamson lofted 
drive, running away for four. This inspires a flourish from Michael Clarke on 
the TV saying that George Bailey has the smallest hands going around, “kiddie 
hand.” He’s pretty keen on it as his colleagues guffaw in the background. After 
the wicket Starc tries to skittle the new man Santner with an inswinging 
yorker, but it is just off target and a wide. Alas, a successful over for 
Australia. Can they finish them off in a hurry here?

WICKET! de Grandhomme c Wade b Starc 12. (New Zealand 229-5)

Starc just does enough from around the wicket, off the seam, to win de 
Grandhomme’s edge. They go through the motions a bit, but it was a very good 
catch from Wade moving a decent stretch to his right.

38th over: New Zealand 222-4 (Williamson 75, de Grandhomme 10) Target 379. 
Maybe strike that last comment. Williamson is still having a dip, up for the 
task of padding Faulkner over his shoulder to the rope for four. Then smashing 
him next ball across the line. Pretty much off the front foot too. That’s 
bloody hard to pull off. 13 from it, one of their better overs tonight.

37th over: New Zealand 209-4 (Williamson 62, de Grandhomme 10) Target 379. 
Cummins back on and it’s a tidy over too, making it hard for Williamson to get 
off strike early in the over close to his body. Both batsmen find twos, but 
only to third man. Easy for all involved. This runs the risk of being a pretty 
ordinary finish. You know the type.

36th over: New Zealand 204-4 (Williamson 59, de Grandhomme 8) Target 379. 
Looked like it was going to be another rubbish over, Williamson twice picking 
out fieldsman in the ring. But when he got off strike, de Grandhomme saw fit to 
get off the mark with a line drive over midwicket. Two more spill to third man 
when he’s forced to play closer to his body to end the over. Oh, and that’sthe 
200 up. Which only leaves 179 in 14 overs. Only.

35th over: New Zealand 195-4 (Williamson 58, de Grandhomme 0) Target 379. 
Hazlewood still has the ability to get something from this track, hitting the 
seam and beating de Grandhomme outside the off-stump. Next up: he’s bringing 
one back. He’s such a gun. Two wickets already tonight, would be surprised he 
doesn’t end up with another couple before he’s done. Oh! Beaten again outside 
off-stump to end the over; that looked like swing more than seam. Gifted 
cricketer. One from it, meaning the Kiwis need in excess of two runs a ball.

Goop/OBO crossover. Not going to miss that. Thanks, Charlie.

WICKET! Munro c Marsh b Faulkner 11 (New Zealand 191-4)

Miscued high in the beautiful Canberra night sky, Mitch Marsh makes no mistake 
running around from the long-on rope to complete the catch, Munro’s brief stay 
and any vague hope that the Black Caps may have had from here. Slower ball I 
fancy. Much like Cummins’ late scalps on Sunday, wicket will do Faulkner’s 
confidence the world of good.

33rd over: New Zealand 190-3 (Williamson 53, Munro 11) Target 379. They’ll 
have a drink following this Hazlewood over. Only five from it, including a 
boundary that’s through about third slip. Four dots in the over more to the 
point. Fine bowling from Hazlewood, but a bit underwhelming from the visitors 
at this stage. It’s now 11 an over they need with 17 left.

Another of these. I promise the last.

32nd over: New Zealand 185-3 (Williamson 52, Munro 7) Target 379. Munro 
doesn’t have time to play himself in, nor play and miss as he did to the 
penultimate Faulkner delivery. But he made up for it with style, launching the 
final ball over long-off for six of the best. He barely followed through there 
- that’s wonderful timing, not a short straight boundary at Manuka either.

Meanwhile in India... fair bit going on here.

WICKET! Neesham c Starc b Hazlewood 74 (New Zealand 177-3)

Just when it was worth doing few equations Jimmy has thrown it away. It was a 
fine hand from the all-rounder, especially after copping that bad blow to the 
arm, but he badly mistimes the final ball of the Hazlewood over, taken by Starc 
inside the ring at midoff when taking to flog it through midwicket. After eight 
runs came from the over too including another blistering Neesham pull. Ah well. 
For those keeping a scorecard (surely no one uses the OBO for that, but if they 
do), the stand was worth 125.

30th over: New Zealand 169-2 (Williamson 50, Neesham 67) Target 379. A lot of 
faith shown in Travis Head tonight. He’s just skipped through his seventh over, 
and six of those haven’t included boundaries. Indeed, he’s conceded just the 
one across the two spells. The five singles here are around the wagon wheel, 
the penultimate getting Williamsonto fifty. Far from the best he’s played for 
his country, but he’s still there. 57 balls to the milestone. They need 210 
from 20 overs. Which, you know, isn’t completely out of the ordinary in the T20 
game. I know I’m grasping a bit, but while these two are there, etc etc.
The Cricket Prof. (@CricProf) 
Williamson has not scored a single run through cover in this innings. His 
favourite area has been mid on where he's scored 12 runs#AUSvNZ

29th over: New Zealand 164-2 (Williamson 48, Neesham 64) Target 379. Remember 
the other night when my wifi dropped out and I swore at my modem and said my 
therapist would be angry at me about that? Well, this time my wifi dropped out 
and I didn’t lose it. I think that’s called ‘growth’. Meanwhile, Starc’s over 
went for five while I was getting the show back on the road. No boundaries, no 
dramas. Good return to the attack from the talisman.

28th over: New Zealand 158-2 (Williamson 44, Neesham 62) Target 379. Neesham 
will be grateful for Head’s reintroduction after the blow the previous over. 
The part-time offie was very effective in his first stint, but sheds nine from 
his first over back including a Nesham pull shot through midwicket. Well hit. 
He’s got a ton on the shelf here. Oh, and this is now his highest ODI score, 
neglected to mention that when he past 57 in the previous over. Now need more 
than ten an over, the required rate just ticking over.

27th over: New Zealand 149-2 (Williamson 40, Neesham 57) Target 379. It’s a 
different game when Starc has it. Neesham was happy enough taking Marsh on, but 
when Starc hits him on the elbow/forearm with 147kph he immediately calls for 
medical assistance. To be fair to the man, he’s barely grimaced. He must be in 
serious pain, that’s hit him flush, as they say. And here Neesham is, sucking a 
bit of water back as the physio does his thing trying to see if he can 
continue. Starc, predictably, sledged him after the incident. It’s what they 
do. I think he told him that he’s shit, if I can lip-read. I’m sure he’ll be 
grateful for your thoughts. It’s quite a lengthy delay, but he’s going to stay 
out there with his arm sporting a compression bandage and plenty of tape. 💪🏼

26th over: New Zealand 147-2 (Williamson 39, Neesham 56) Target 379. Boom, 
boom! Neesham hasfifty after stroking Marsh on the up for a really nice cover 
boundary, then pulling him over deep backward square leg taking on Finch back 
there and clearing him! Six runs. Impressive batting from everyone’s favourite 
twitter cricketer. The half-century took 60 balls to gather. Has to go on with 
it, and big time. Huge time. You know what I mean.

Russ Jackson has popped his head in (now without wisdom teeth) on the twitter 
debate to reinforce that Deano needs to be in our Nobody Likes Us XI. And we 
have a bid for Greg Dyer > Timmy Z. The latter can bowl leggies too, so maybe 
that works.

25th over: New Zealand 134-2 (Williamson 38, Neesham 44) Target 379. Just what 
the captain wanted, no boundaries off Starc upon coming back into the attack. 
Four from it as Neesham has to watch Starc very carefully as he tails back into 
his stumps from over the wicket. At nearly 150kph as well. Half way there, the 
Black Caps livin’ on the proverbial prayer.

David Warner's imperious century helps Australia to ODI win over New Zealand

Man of the match is David Warner after his big ton this afternoon. “It was a 
fantastic wicket, it always is here at Manuka,” he says to Mark Nicholas. “The 
other day I played a bit of a lazy stroke but today I knuckled down and it was 
a good wicket to do it on.”

It was his sixth ODI ton this year. “It was the format that I thought wasn’t 
my greatest,” he reflects. Well, it is right now.

Kane Williamson, Black Caps skipper, is next up. “The perfect performance 
really,” he observes of Australia. True enough. He acknowledges that sending 
Australia in probably wasn’t a great call.

Last of all, Steve Smith who agrees it was a top performance from his side, 
thrilled with his batsmen. “I was going to bat,” he says of the Williamson 
decision at the toss. When talking about his bowlers he’s especially happy with 
Cummins performance, who he believes took confidence from his final spell on 
Sunday.

That’ll do it. The man who made the match-winning ton takes the catch at 
cover, to a top edge won by the bowler Faulkner to get him a second wicket. A 
good comeback from him after a challenging start this evening. And with that, 
Australia have won back the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. Back with the presentation 
and some final thoughts in a couple of minutes.
 
47th over: New Zealand 262-9 (Watling 17, Boult 2) Target 379. Can Hazlewood 
finish this off? He deserves a third. Urgh, he can’t. This is grim. Please let 
this not go the distance.
 
46th over: New Zealand 255-9 (Watling 11, Boult 1) Target 379. It’ll be 
4-for-41 for Cummins, unable to remove Boult despite his best efforts. 
Block-hole bouncers, well-executed slower balls; but all kept out, one way or 
another. He even gets a single to the last ball, retaining the strike. Fair 
play to him. No one in Australia is tweeting about this game anymore. We’re the 
only people left. You, dear reader, and me. You and me.
 Just us.  
Henry’s had a crack at putting it over midwicket and it is an admirable 
effort, but it can’t get it beyond James Faulkner patrolling the boundary out 
there. Nicely taken. A fourth to Cummins. Thrilled for him. He gets five balls 
at Trent Boult for a five-for. On the evidence of watching this (lovely) man 
bat over the years, I’m backing the bowler.
 
45th over: New Zealand 254-8 (Watling 11, Henry 7) Target 379. Don’t judge me 
for this being quick. There’s a wicket to deal with in the future. This is like 
Back to the Future and I have a copy of Gray’s Sports Almanac. Starc kept 
bowling yorkers and they kept avoiding the stumps. That’s the main take out, 
the over worth four.
 
44th over: New Zealand 250-8 (Watling 10, Henry 4) Target 379. Slogs and 
inside edges and plays and misses. All told, Cummins unlucky not to have his 
fourth and even fifth. He has an over to go, so provided Starc doesn’t finish 
it off himself a five-for is still on the shelf for him and that really would 
be an excellent story.

Casting forward, this might be significant leading into the Pakistan Test 
series. Having watched Yasir close up in England this winter I can assure you 
he’s an absolute treat.

43rd over: New Zealand 246-8 (Watling 9, Henry 1) Target 379. Starc. Watling. 
Henry. Dot. Single. Dot. Dot. Single. Dot. Was it as good for you as it was for 
me? Time to make it stop, fellas. Two in a hurry. Thanks. 9173 people at Manuka 
tonight. Probably a fraction down, but there was rain about earlier.
 
42nd over: New Zealand 244-8 (Watling 8, Henry 0) Target 379. Almost feels a 
waste to write a post on one ball alone? It’s nearly a chop on, Watling getting 
on it very late. Anyway, let’s make it worth your while. This song came up 
today on twitter due to the fact that I came to the office this morning on the 
back of a motor bike. Well, it was a motor scooter. But anyway. Sydney? Back of 
a bike? Looking for Alibrandi? Yeah, worked better in my head than it did on 
twitter. Have this anyway.
 I am Pia Miranda in that comparison, in case you were wondering.  
It is going to be a huge win for Australia very soon here. Pat Cummins has a 
third, a return he has deserved with some solid fast bowling in conditions 
where it isn’t always easy to bowl quick. On this occasion Southee is trying to 
pull, but he can’t get into position in time, a top edge to midwicket the 
outcome. Pace and bounce.
 
41st over: New Zealand 238-7 (Watling 2, Southee 2) Target 379. To the last 
ball of the Starc over Southee is off the mark with a flick of the wrists that 
would have also seen his stumps removed had he not made contact. We’re not far 
away now.
 
Oh yeah, that’s Mitchell Starc 101. Santner tries to make room to the wrong 
delivery, an on-target yorker. So it’s the very familiar clatter of stumps that 
Starc generates basically much every time he plays for Australia, regardless of 
format or any other variable.
 
40th over: New Zealand 234-6 (Santner 1, Watling 1) Target 379. Cummins much 
better tonight. The first ball to Watling is a bouncer on his helmet badge. 
Scary-quick. A single each all they’re able to find in the successful over. 
Final power play begins now, meaning a fifth man can be stationed outside the 
ring. And New Zealand require 15 an over to win. Draw your own conclusions.
 
Cummins’ slower ball gets him a second wicket. Effective on Sunday towards the 
end, and again here in Canberra winning an error from Williamson, who finally 
gives it away after a long shift tonight in a chase they were never really in. 
Warner takes the catch at cover. He tried to flay it over the ring from 
slightly short of a length, but went straight to the afternoon’s century-maker.
 
39th over: New Zealand 232-5 (Williamson 80, Santner 0) Target 379. Before the 
wicket Bailey jumped high at short cover but can’t reach the Williamson lofted 
drive, running away for four. This inspires a flourish from Michael Clarke on 
the TV saying that George Bailey has the smallest hands going around, “kiddie 
hand.” He’s pretty keen on it as his colleagues guffaw in the background. After 
the wicket Starc tries to skittle the new man Santner with an inswinging 
yorker, but it is just off target and a wide. Alas, a successful over for 
Australia. Can they finish them off in a hurry here?

 
Starc just does enough from around the wicket, off the seam, to win de 
Grandhomme’s edge. They go through the motions a bit, but it was a very good 
catch from Wade moving a decent stretch to his right.
 
38th over: New Zealand 222-4 (Williamson 75, de Grandhomme 10) Target 379. 
Maybe strike that last comment. Williamson is still having a dip, up for the 
task of padding Faulkner over his shoulder to the rope for four. Then smashing 
him next ball across the line. Pretty much off the front foot too. That’s 
bloody hard to pull off. 13 from it, one of their better overs tonight.
 
37th over: New Zealand 209-4 (Williamson 62, de Grandhomme 10) Target 379. 
Cummins back on and it’s a tidy over too, making it hard for Williamson to get 
off strike early in the over close to his body. Both batsmen find twos, but 
only to third man. Easy for all involved. This runs the risk of being a pretty 
ordinary finish. You know the type.
 
36th over: New Zealand 204-4 (Williamson 59, de Grandhomme 8) Target 379. 
Looked like it was going to be another rubbish over, Williamson twice picking 
out fieldsman in the ring. But when he got off strike, de Grandhomme saw fit to 
get off the mark with a line drive over midwicket. Two more spill to third man 
when he’s forced to play closer to his body to end the over. Oh, and that’sthe 
200 up. Which only leaves 179 in 14 overs. Only.
 
35th over: New Zealand 195-4 (Williamson 58, de Grandhomme 0) Target 379. 
Hazlewood still has the ability to get something from this track, hitting the 
seam and beating de Grandhomme outside the off-stump. Next up: he’s bringing 
one back. He’s such a gun. Two wickets already tonight, would be surprised he 
doesn’t end up with another couple before he’s done. Oh! Beaten again outside 
off-stump to end the over; that looked like swing more than seam. Gifted 
cricketer. One from it, meaning the Kiwis need in excess of two runs a ball.

Goop/OBO crossover. Not going to miss that. Thanks, Charlie.

Miscued high in the beautiful Canberra night sky, Mitch Marsh makes no mistake 
running around from the long-on rope to complete the catch, Munro’s brief stay 
and any vague hope that the Black Caps may have had from here. Slower ball I 
fancy. Much like Cummins’ late scalps on Sunday, wicket will do Faulkner’s 
confidence the world of good.
 
33rd over: New Zealand 190-3 (Williamson 53, Munro 11) Target 379. They’ll 
have a drink following this Hazlewood over. Only five from it, including a 
boundary that’s through about third slip. Four dots in the over more to the 
point. Fine bowling from Hazlewood, but a bit underwhelming from the visitors 
at this stage. It’s now 11 an over they need with 17 left.

Another of these. I promise the last.

32nd over: New Zealand 185-3 (Williamson 52, Munro 7) Target 379. Munro 
doesn’t have time to play himself in, nor play and miss as he did to the 
penultimate Faulkner delivery. But he made up for it with style, launching the 
final ball over long-off for six of the best. He barely followed through there 
- that’s wonderful timing, not a short straight boundary at Manuka either.

Meanwhile in India... fair bit going on here.

Just when it was worth doing few equations Jimmy has thrown it away. It was a 
fine hand from the all-rounder, especially after copping that bad blow to the 
arm, but he badly mistimes the final ball of the Hazlewood over, taken by Starc 
inside the ring at midoff when taking to flog it through midwicket. After eight 
runs came from the over too including another blistering Neesham pull. Ah well. 
For those keeping a scorecard (surely no one uses the OBO for that, but if they 
do), the stand was worth 125.
 
30th over: New Zealand 169-2 (Williamson 50, Neesham 67) Target 379. A lot of 
faith shown in Travis Head tonight. He’s just skipped through his seventh over, 
and six of those haven’t included boundaries. Indeed, he’s conceded just the 
one across the two spells. The five singles here are around the wagon wheel, 
the penultimate getting Williamsonto fifty. Far from the best he’s played for 
his country, but he’s still there. 57 balls to the milestone. They need 210 
from 20 overs. Which, you know, isn’t completely out of the ordinary in the T20 
game. I know I’m grasping a bit, but while these two are there, etc etc.

29th over: New Zealand 164-2 (Williamson 48, Neesham 64) Target 379. Remember 
the other night when my wifi dropped out and I swore at my modem and said my 
therapist would be angry at me about that? Well, this time my wifi dropped out 
and I didn’t lose it. I think that’s called ‘growth’. Meanwhile, Starc’s over 
went for five while I was getting the show back on the road. No boundaries, no 
dramas. Good return to the attack from the talisman.
 
28th over: New Zealand 158-2 (Williamson 44, Neesham 62) Target 379. Neesham 
will be grateful for Head’s reintroduction after the blow the previous over. 
The part-time offie was very effective in his first stint, but sheds nine from 
his first over back including a Nesham pull shot through midwicket. Well hit. 
He’s got a ton on the shelf here. Oh, and this is now his highest ODI score, 
neglected to mention that when he past 57 in the previous over. Now need more 
than ten an over, the required rate just ticking over.
 
27th over: New Zealand 149-2 (Williamson 40, Neesham 57) Target 379. It’s a 
different game when Starc has it. Neesham was happy enough taking Marsh on, but 
when Starc hits him on the elbow/forearm with 147kph he immediately calls for 
medical assistance. To be fair to the man, he’s barely grimaced. He must be in 
serious pain, that’s hit him flush, as they say. And here Neesham is, sucking a 
bit of water back as the physio does his thing trying to see if he can 
continue. Starc, predictably, sledged him after the incident. It’s what they 
do. I think he told him that he’s shit, if I can lip-read. I’m sure he’ll be 
grateful for your thoughts. It’s quite a lengthy delay, but he’s going to stay 
out there with his arm sporting a compression bandage and plenty of tape. 💪🏼
 
26th over: New Zealand 147-2 (Williamson 39, Neesham 56) Target 379. Boom, 
boom! Neesham hasfifty after stroking Marsh on the up for a really nice cover 
boundary, then pulling him over deep backward square leg taking on Finch back 
there and clearing him! Six runs. Impressive batting from everyone’s favourite 
twitter cricketer. The half-century took 60 balls to gather. Has to go on with 
it, and big time. Huge time. You know what I mean.

Russ Jackson has popped his head in (now without wisdom teeth) on the twitter 
debate to reinforce that Deano needs to be in our Nobody Likes Us XI. And we 
have a bid for Greg Dyer > Timmy Z. The latter can bowl leggies too, so maybe 
that works.
 
25th over: New Zealand 134-2 (Williamson 38, Neesham 44) Target 379. Just what 
the captain wanted, no boundaries off Starc upon coming back into the attack. 
Four from it as Neesham has to watch Starc very carefully as he tails back into 
his stumps from over the wicket. At nearly 150kph as well. Half way there, the 
Black Caps livin’ on the proverbial prayer.
