Standing next to a thin belt of rattling trees that represents the only line 
of green in vast stretches of orange desert, 70-year-old Hamud El-Nour 
Hamdallah recalls a time when this area in Sudan’s River Nile state was dense 
forest. If you had not found Goz El Halg village by nightfall, you would have 
to wait until morning to find your way out.

But decades of drought and deforestation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/21/sudan-civil-war-climate-change>
 have allowed sand to roll through the desert and swallow homes and farmland. 
Hamdallah and his community now go to bed not knowing if they will make it out 
of their homes the next day.

“It’s especially scary when the house is covered [in sand] at night and you 
can only wait in the dark until morning to dig your way out,” by shovelling 
through sand or using a tractor to wade through it, he said.

The sand can even pour into homes through windows and doors or collapse 
buildings.

“We have been almost buried in sand,” said Hamdallah.

Research from a Sudanese government climate programme 
<http://adaptation-undp.org/projects/sudan-national-adaptation-programme-action-napa>
 launched a decade ago shows that the boundary between desert and semi-desert 
has shifted 50-200km southward since the 1930s.

In many villages like Goz El Halg, whose name derives from the encroaching 
‘gezan’, or dunes, the desert has finally engulfed places that used to have so 
much wood it drew people to live there and spurred a boat-building industry.

Hamdallah is one of many elders who have had to move villages three times as 
the sand took over. A previous village lying a few hundred metres away is now 
barely visible, with some houses reduced to brick outlines in the sand.

The village now serves as a playground for children, who play hide and seek 
behind steep orange dunes, some of which tower above the height of the houses 
that once stood there.

“I don’t like what has happened to the old village,” said 14-year-old Ruwaya 
Ferra, a student at the local school.

The children here are taught about the importance of conserving trees and 
water to stop history from repeating itself. Small gangs of shy girls know all 
the words to jaunty songs about protecting trees, because they sing them once a 
week or more at school.

Teachers stress the importance of protecting the environment, starting with 
the plants sheltered in small rockeries in the otherwise barren school yard, 
and pen poems about shooing goats away from the precious patches of green.

“Don’t cut a leaf off a tree because we don’t want drought and desert to come 
to us,” said Ferra, repeating one of the mantras drummed into new generations.

But tree-cutting for charcoal and land degradation due to mismanagement are 
not the only factors at play inSudan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan>. 
People here started feeling the effects of global warming in the 1980s, with 
temperatures of over 50C making summers unbearable and winters uncomfortable, 
erratic rains ruining harvests and floods or droughts turning arable land into 
dust or gravel.

 Ismail El Gizouli, a Sudanese climate change negotiator and member of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said:“Since the 1970s, we 
[the world] aremoving very fast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/14/it-was-too-hot-even-to-leave-home-stories-from-the-worlds-hottest-year>
 towards disaster, towards the end of the earth. So this is why we have to move 
very quickly now [to cut greenhouse gas emissions].”

In Sudan, decades of conflict, international sanctions against President Omar 
al-Bashir’s government and the loss of most of the country’s oil and forests in 
2011 with South Sudan’s secession have exacerbated the effects of climate 
change.

“The problem is caused by the big emitters [of greenhouse gases] but we are 
the first who are affected because our backbone is very weak, our 
infrastructure very weak,” said Gizouli.

While developed countries can absorb weather shocks, Sudan’s ability to 
respond to droughts and floods is as poor as its people, two-thirds of whom are 
farmers.

Currently Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> only attracts 5% 
of the world’s climate-related funding, despite suffering disproportionately 
from the impacts of global warming.

“This is why people are attacking the rich countries. They want to live in 
luxury – let us therefore die,” said Gizouli, who is pushing richer countries 
for money for more projects to adapt to climate change.

In Sudan, the Forests National Corporation started reserving areas in the 
1980s, and a decade later the Sudan National Adaptation Programme of Action 
started planting belts of trees to protect fields and homes. Aid from Canada, 
the UK and the United Nations Development Programme is being spent on 
rehabilitation and irrigation projects in desert villages.

In River Nile state, government officials say that around 8,000 trees have 
been planted over the past two years and that, as farmers’ crop yields 
increase, communities are turning to tree nurseries and swapping charcoal for 
butane gas.

But it will take significant investment to scale up climate adaptation 
projects to stop heat, sandstorms and floods from sweeping away homes and 
fertile top soils.

In Goz El Halg, Hamdallah and other elders come daily to water and bolster 
another 2.5km-long greenbelt planted five years ago with water from a well 
powered by a solar-pump that has eased reliance on the rain.

These trees are the last line of desert defence standing between the burial or 
survival of a village that has already lost half of its residents to El Damer, 
the state capital around two hours’ drive away in a 4x4 through mostly empty 
desert.

But Hamdallah believes that the people that stayed are better off than those 
who ended up in Sudan’s increasingly overstretched and under-resourced urban 
areas.

“I’m delighted about these trees because they protect us,” he said, surveying 
the still-growing trees through a pair of oversized shades as he mulls whether 
or not he will move again in his lifetime. “I don’t think so. They have saved 
us from the sands, I think.”
