We lined up in the cold, not noticing the cold, waiting for the doors to open. 
When they did, it was chins and boots and elbows, no queues, we just fought our 
way in. Lamplight and decorations had transformed the schoolroom from a prison 
into a banqueting hall. The long trestle-tables were patterned with food; 
fly-cake, brown buns, ham-sandwiches.

I’m heading out of London tomorrow. I’m off to Laurie Lee country: to the 
Cotswolds, where I hope to walk for hours, write recipes in the garden, drink 
an indecent amount of tea, and have at least one pub lunch. I found myself, 
while booking my coach ticket a couple of days ago, referring to this weekend 
away as “going home”. It’s not, of course, but lately I have been struggling to 
define where ‘home’ is. The room I live in at the moment is the spare room at 
the house I am working in. My kitchen things and most of my clothes and books 
are still in storage in Liverpool. I haven’t been in my parents’ houses, where 
I grew up, since 2014. So, for now, the wonderful house in the Cotswolds,where 
I spend Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/little-library-cafe/2015/dec/24/food-in-books-crystallised-ginger-from-the-adventure-of-the-christmas-pudding-by-agatha-christie>
 and holidays and long weekends, is a home to return to.

London is vast, and wonderful, but on days when I have been squashed against a 
door on the tube, or battled crowds in a market, I long for some wide-open 
space. If I am bound to London, I will head for Epping Forest, or Hackney 
Marshes, or to Hampstead Heath. But I feel very lucky to be able to spend a 
couple of hours on a coach, and arrive in the green of the Cotswolds.

Laurie Lee’s Gloucestershire is a beautiful part of the world. The deep 
valleys, the fields of buttercups, the apple trees, the twisted brambles 
covered in blackberries. It is so different from the chocolate-box, 
dry-stone-wall picture of the Cotswolds I always imagined. I can’t wait to be 
there again.

* A note on the recipe: it is based on the one from St John’s, purveyors of 
the best Eccles cakes I have ever eaten and uses flaky puff pastry, rather than 
one with suet. It may not be quite as traditional as the fly-cakes Lee speaks 
of, but it is glorious.

Eccles cakes

Makes 6

Ingredients 
Pastry 
(make a double batch if you think you’ll use it - it freezes really well) 
65g unsalted butter (cold from the fridge and chopped into small cubes) 
250g strong white bread flour
 Pinch salt 
125ml water 
190g block of unsalted butter (cold from the fridge)
 Filling 
25g unsalted butter 
50g dark brown sugar 
100g currants
 1tsp allspice
 Generous grating of nutmeg
 For the top
 1 egg white
 Caster sugar

Equipment 
Bowl 
Cling film 
Rolling pin 
Greaseproof paper 
Small saucepan
 Wooden spoon 
10cm diameter plate, to use as a guide 
Knife 
Pastry brush 
Baking tray

1. Rub the smaller amount of butter into the flour and salt until it resembles 
breadcrumbs. Dribble the water in, bit by bit, until the dough comes together 
into a firm ball. Shape the dough into a rough cube, wrap it in cling film and 
put it in the fridge for an hour. Don’t scrimp on the resting time - the butter 
in this dough needs to be very cold and firm before it is rolled out.

2. Roll the dough out to about 8mm thick. Put the larger block of butter 
between two pieces of greaseproof paper and bash it with a rolling pin into a 
rectangle less than half the size of the pastry rectangle. Lay the butter in 
the middle of the pastry, and fold the pastry edges in and seal them on top of 
the butter, overlapping where necessary and ensuring that there are no gaps. 
The major rule with puff pastry is that you need to avoid any leaking butter, 
so be gentle with the pastry and make sure the butter is really firm after each 
rest period, or it will spill out. Wrap the butter filled dough in cling film 
and return to the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

3. If you have warm hands (like me) and you’re overcautious (like me), stick 
your hands in a bowl of iced water for a minute before this next step. Take the 
pastry from the fridge, flour your bench and rolling pin, place the pastry on 
the bench with the short edge parallel to you and roll it out until it is about 
60cm long. Try to avoid making it wider if you can. Next, fold the top quarter 
of the pastry into the middle, then bring the bottom quarter up to meet it in 
the middle. Fold the whole lot in half though the middle. You should have 
created four layers of pastry. Wrap it in cling film and rest again, for 
another thirty minutes.

4. After 30 minutes, repeat the step above. Place the pastry in front of you, 
with the opening between the folds on the right hand side, and roll it out 
perpendicular to the edge of the bench. Fold and return to the fridge for 
another 30 minutes.

5. While the pastry is chilling, prepare the filling. Melt the butter and 
sugar together in the saucepan, then stir the currants and spices through. 
Allow to cool completely, in the fridge if necessary.

6. Roll and fold the pastry one more time, then rest for a final 30 minutes. 
Preheat the oven to 210C. When the pastry is chilled, roll it out to 8mm thick. 
Cut 10cm rounds of pastry. Put just more than a tablespoon of the filling in 
the middle of each, then press round the edges of the pastry disc until they’re 
thinner than the centre. Pull the sides of the pastry up over the filling, then 
seal the pastry together with your fingertips. Turn the Eccles cake over and 
roll the base around a little on the bench until it is smooth. Transfer to a 
lined baking tray. Repeat with the rest of the pastry.

7. Make three slashes (for the Holy Trinity) in the top of each cake with a 
serrated knife. Whisk the egg white until slightly foamy, then paint it onto 
each Eccles cake with the pastry brush. Sprinkle the top of each with some 
caster sugar.

8. Bake for 15 - 20 minutes until golden brown and flaky. Serve either hot or 
cold, with a hard cheese.
