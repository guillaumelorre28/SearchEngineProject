The nonpartisan commission that organizes the presidential debates has drawn 
from a pool of deep experience in selecting hosts for this year’s three 
scheduled meetings between Donald Trump andHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>.


While none of the moderators named on Friday has hosted a general-election 
presidential debate before, all four moderated primary debates this year.

The Commission on Presidential Debates additionally named a moderator for this 
year’s single vice-presidential debate, CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano. 
She has never hosted a debate.

Moderating can be thankless work. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican 
presidential nominee,criticized Candy Crowley of CNN 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/candy-crowley-republicans-benghazi-interjection>
 after she spot-checked his claim on a debate stage in New York that Barack 
Obama had failed to refer to the 2012 Benghazi attacks as a “terror” attack. 
“She obviously thought it was her job to play a more active role in the debate 
than was agreed upon by the two candidates,” Romney latersaid 
<http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/27/romney-breaks-silence-on-candy-crowleys-debate-interference/#ixzz4J6pPe2vK>
.

More recently, Trump complained for months about Fox News host Megyn Kelly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fox-anchor-megyn-kelly-meets-donald-trump>
, who asked him during the first Republican primary debate last August about 
his views on women, quoting his own words back to him, which Trump claimed was 
unfair.


Who are the moderators? 

Let’s not overlook the break-glass-in-case-of-emergency backup moderator for 
these debates, C-Span’s Steve Scully. In fact, let’s start with him. Scully is 
C-Span’s senior executive producer, White House and political editor.

Scully, who has a reputation for being irreproachably even-handed, was born in 
Pennsylvania, served on the board of White House Correspondents’ Association, 
and has worked for over three decades at C-Span.

He has been hailed by comedian John Oliver as the most patient man on 
television:

Holt, a popular figure in his own newsroom and beyond, rose to the anchor 
chair of NBC’s flagship evening news program after former host Brian Williams 
was suspended last year for misrepresenting a story. Claims for Williams’ 
indispensability were undercut when the ratings climbed under Holt. He 
moderated a Democratic primary debate in January.

Vice-presidential debate moderator Martha Raddatz steals the show, in 2012 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/12/vice-presidential-debate-martha-raddatz-video>
Raddatz, a specialist in military affairs, has perhaps the most debate hosting 
experience of the bunch, having moderated the 2012 vice-presidential debate and 
two 2016 primary debates, one for each party. Purveyors of conspiracy theories 
(ieBreitbart 
<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/06/martha-raddatz/>) 
complained in 2012 that Raddatz’s impartiality was subverted by the fact that 
Barack Obama had attended Raddatz’s wedding – 25 years ago, before Obama was an 
elected anything.

Conservative id-keeper Matt Drudge is keeping up that line this morning:

More than the other moderators, Cooper’s star power transcends his work as a 
news host. He also had a syndicated talkshow, Anderson Live, he did a voiceover 
on Broadway, he’s the author of a bestselling memoir and he has avocal fanbase

A decorated journalist currently parked at Fox News with three Emmys and the 
Dupont-Columbia Silver Baton award to his credit. A must-watch for Sunday show 
aficionados on Fox, and a former moderator of Meet the Press. His reputation 
for even-handedness is perhaps bolstered by his former voter registration as a 
Democrat.

A veteran of the White House, Pentagon and supreme court beats and a former 
CNN talent, Quijano anchors politics coverage on CBSN, the live-streaming 
digital version of CBS News. She grew up in a Chicago suburb, majored in 
engineering and “lucked into a broadcast journalism career”, she tells an 
interviewer in the Filipinas Magazine clip above.
