In a nutshell 
Like a hi-tech hall of mirrors combined with a science museum, the six-storey 
Camera Obscura and World of Illusions is a celebration of visual trickery, 
packed with optical illusions, holograms and interactive exhibits that are – 
for all their educational value – simply funny. Lose yourself in the mirror 
maze; get shrunk by giant children in the big-small room; and stagger through 
the vortex tunnel (but take seriously the motion-sickness warning).

Fun fact 
The Camera Obscura itself is like a 19th-century webcam, projecting live 
images of Edinburgh through a pinhole camera in the roof on to a viewing table 
(or your hands).

 Honey, I shrank... 
Best thing(s) about it 
Your phone will be full of wacky photos – although the exhibit offering your 
child’s severed head on a salad plate may upset the grandparents. This may be 
an ideal rainy-day attraction, but it’s also great in fine weather: the 
360-degree views from the roof terrace (telescopes included) should be seen in 
all their glory.

 Tunnel vision... 
What about lunch?
There’s no on-site cafe, but a hand stamp lets you come and go all day. Camera 
Obscura visitors get discounts at certain cafes on the Royal Mile. Failing 
those,Hula <http://www.hulajuicebar.co.uk/>, a few minutes away on Grassmarket 
is a wholesome and child-friendly lunch spot, serving bagels, wraps and soups 
all day.

Exit through the gift shop? 
Yes (via musical steps), but you wouldn’t want to miss it. Sneak in without 
the kids to get a head start on Christmas shopping, from joke-store stocking 
fillers to hi-tech science toys.

Getting there 
It’s a 15-20 minute uphill walk from Waverley station. Keep your off-peak 
train ticket to get one child in for free under Scotrail’sKids Go Free 
<https://www.scotrail.co.uk/offers/kids-go-free/kids-go-free-deals> scheme.

Value for money? 
Yes - by Edinburgh standards. There’s enough here to keep you giggling for 
three to four hours. Adult £13.95, child £9.95.

Opening times 
Open every day except 25 December. 9am-9pm July-August; 9.30am-7pm 
September-October; 10am-6pm November-March; 9.30-7pm April-June; extended
