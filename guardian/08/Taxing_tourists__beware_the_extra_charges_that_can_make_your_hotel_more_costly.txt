You may have budgeted for your next overseas city break away, but you could 
still be in for a shock if your hotel charges city tax. The tax can add up to 
£12 a night to the cost of a double room, and you may only be presented with 
the bill when it’s time to check out.


City tax is charged on hotel stays across many European cities including 
Paris, Berlin, Rome, Amsterdam and Barcelona, and in some more far-flung 
destinations, such as Dubai and America. Rates and charging structures vary, 
but can go up to £6 per person per night.

Bob Atkinson from TravelSupermarket.com says in some cities you can expect to 
pay on a per person, per night basis, while in others, such as Berlin, 
Amsterdam and Cologne, city tax is charged at a flat rate of 5% of your hotel 
room bill. You may have to pay for your children too – in Berlin, for instance, 
their stay is taxed, while in Italy there are usually exemptions for the 
under-14s or under-16s.

Paris is relatively cheap, says Atkinson, with charges from 20 cents to €1.50 
(£1.30) per person per night, based on hotel location and star rating. In 
contrast, in Rome you can pay up to €7 per person per night, he says, which 
works out at more than £80 for two people if you’re staying for a week.

It’s generally hotels that charge city tax, according to Atkinson, as “small 
private accommodation tends to be exempt and stays at Airbnb seem to avoid it 
in some places, although Paris is one city where it must be collected”. Once 
again, there are quirks in the system: in some places, including Cologne and 
Berlin, business travellers are exempt from the tax, and in Italy children 
under 14, (or 16 in some places), can be exempt.


In some cities payments go to supporting the local tourist industry and 
developing it, such as in Cologne

While you may think this is a sneaky way for hotels to boost their coffers, 
the money doesn’t go directly into their pockets, although where it goes varies 
too. “In some cities payments go to supporting the local tourist industry and 
developing it, for example, in Cologne,” says Atkinson. But in Italy the tax is 
used to “raise revenue for hard-pressed government departments”.


In the Catalonia region of Spain where city tax has been in operation since 
2012, it has raised a total of €126m, which has been split between the Catalan 
Tourism Agency, local tourism boards and town halls.


Since July, the Spanish government has charged a new “tourist tax” on hotel 
stays in the Balearic Islands, which include Mallorca, Ibiza, Formentera and 
Menorca. It’s charged at a rate of up to €2 per person per night, depending on 
the type of accommodation, and is collected by the hotel. The upper rate 
applies to four- and five-star hotels; you may only pay €1 a night if you’re 
staying in a basic holiday apartment.

As city tax isn’t an issue in the UK, holidaymakers heading abroad may easily 
be confused about whether it has already been included in their holiday price 
if they’ve booked a package deal, or whether they need to save some money to 
cover this. Sean Tipton from ABTA, the group representing travel agents, says 
the basic rule is that “any locally collected taxes, which includes city tax, 
won’t be included as part of your package”.

This means it is up to you to cover the cost on arrival or departure at your 
hotel, which could be a shock if you haven’t read the notes with your booking.

Budget flight company Jet2.com confirms that the tax isn’t included in its 
city breaks packages and should be paid locally at the hotel. It says it warns 
customers upfront: “We notify customers when they book, and they have to tick a 
box to say that they’ve read this.” Details are also contained in Jet2’s terms 
and conditions.

Both Thomson and First Choice also say city tax (if levied at your 
destination) isn’t included in package prices, adding, “we advise customers 
they are chargeable on arrival rather than included in the package price”.

If you’re booking accommodation independently, check you read the hotel’s 
website carefully, including details of any city tax charges. While these 
should all be listed – sites such as Booking.com put details alongside the room 
listing – it can be possible to spot the room rate, think you’ve got a bargain 
and forget to factor in the extra costs. In most cases you can pay any tax due 
on departure, by cash or card.

While city tax isn’t an issue in the UK, Camden council did propose a form of 
a tourist tax last year to help with street cleaning, in the wake of government 
cuts. Camden was suggesting a £1 a night tax on hotel stays in central London, 
but imposing such changes would mean new legislation being brought in. A 
council spokesperson says that for now, “the idea remains an idea and it has 
not been adopted or dismissed”.
