Somerset <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset> are now top of the table 
with 226 points having beaten Nottinghamshire in three days, however they will 
rue the fact they missed out on a fifth batting point in their first innings 
which would have made Yorkshire’s task harder. The players will gather at 
Taunton on Friday to watch proceedings at Lord’s.

Middlesex, who have banked five points in the match so far, are second with 
218 andYorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire>, who have 
claimed seven, are third with 211. There are three possible scenarios from the 
match: a result (which is worth 16 further points to the winning side), a draw 
(which is worth five further points to each side) or a tie (which is worth 
eight further points to each side).

A draw would not be enough for either side at Lord’s, so they must both go for 
the win in order for the victorious side to clinch the 16 points on offer to 
overtake Somerset.

A tie would put Middlesex level with Somerset on points although, under 
tie-breaker rules, Somerset would still then win the Championship as they would 
have won more games this season (six) than Middlesex (five).
