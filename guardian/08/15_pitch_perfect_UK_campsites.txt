Farrs Meadow, Dorset 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/west-country/dorset/1547-farrs-meadow>

Few sites can match Farrs Meadow for ingenuity and peace. Quirky touches 
include upcycled horsebox showers and cattle troughs converted into washing-up 
sinks. There’s a separate paddock for campervans, and accommodation in a yurt, 
a vintage Dandy camper and a converted stable. It has wild swimming in the 
Stour river, and is a 10-minute walk from one of the National Trust’s tiniest 
properties, the Vine Inn in Pamphill, and half an hour from one of its biggest, 
the 8,500-acre Kingston Lacy estate.
• Pitch for two £25, then £10/£5 per extra adult/child, yurts (sleep 4) £100, 
stable £130 (sleeps 4), May-September, 07913 838726,farrsmeadow.co.uk

Embers Camping Beaulieu, New Forest 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/new-forest/hampshire/548-embers-camping-beaulieu>

As the name suggests, it’s all about campfires at Embers Camping Beaulieu, 
where every pitch comes with its own firepit. Campfire cooking is an essential 
part of the “purist” camping experience the site aims to offer, along with 
acres of space, no electrical hook-ups, and a tents-only policy. On a farm 
beside the tranquil Beaulieu river, Embers has pitches scattered among the 
trees and lawns, and beyond it lie cycling or walking trails in the New Forest, 
plus the chocolate-box village of Beaulieu, the National Motor Museum, and 
Beaulieu Abbey.
• Adults from £20 a night, children 4-16 £5, open July-September, 0845 257

The Fire Pit Camp, Norfolk 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/east-anglia/norfolk/552-the-fire-pit-camp>


On the leafy fringes of the village of Wendling, the Fire Pit is a 
family-friendly camping paradise, usually scented with campfire smoke. The 
large, car-free meadow is home to 420 saplings planted by the Woodland Trust 
and just 10 spacious pitches. The centrepiece is the Wren’s Nest, a two-level 
glamping dome sleeping eight, made from locally harvested hazel wood and 
recycled materials. The campsite hosts a food festival on 6 and 7 June.
• Adult £15, child £7, Wren’s Nest £130 for up to four people, £12 per extra 
person (sleeps 8), open all year, 07717 315199,thefirepitcamp.co.uk

Ninham Country Holidays, Isle of Wight 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/south-england/isle-of-wight/1581-ninham-country-holidays>

Given its nickname as “the garden isle” it’s appropriate that the Isle of 
Wight can boast such a green and well-groomed campsite. The camping areas are 
spread across two fields, one large with a stylish softwood-clad ablutions 
block, the other slightly smaller; but both sets of campers get to use the 
heated swimming pool. The mature woodland and rolling countryside of Ninham’s 
sprawling 120 acres have a fabulous network of footpaths and cycle routes 
leading directly from the campsite, and it’s less than a mile from the seafront 
resort of Shanklin.
• Adults from £6.50, children from £3.55, pitch from £3.60, open

Ocean Pitch, Devon 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/south-west-england/devon/1246-ocean-pitch-campsite>

Only a short strip of meadow and the sandy descent to the beach separate Ocean 
Pitch from the waves of Croyde Bay, north of Bideford. Its uninterrupted beach 
views mean surfers can keep an eye on the sea from their tent and race down 
with their board when the surf’s up. The wetsuit-averse will like the fact the 
site is on the coastal path, so it’s an easy ramble to quieter, neighbouring 
beaches.
• Adults from £13, children half price, cars £3, open 17 June-6 September, 
07581 024348,oceanpitch.co.uk <http://www.oceanpitch.co.uk/>

Tehidy, Cornwall 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/south-west-england/cornwall/1201-tehidy-holiday-park>

This family-run campsite near Redruth, with its red phone box and 
old-fashioned Roskilly’s ice-cream sign, is quaint without being twee. There’s 
an array of pitches for campers and caravanners, and a carefully maintained 
feel, from the neatly trimmed grass to the well-stocked shop in the old 
blacksmith’s forge. The brand-new insulated wigwams are equipped with mod cons 
such as fridge, microwave and kettle. The sands and hidden coves of St Ives are 
a woodland walk away, through Tehidy country park.
• Pitch for two from £14 then £4pp, wigwams from £50, open March to end of 
October, 01209 216489,tehidy.co.uk <http://www.tehidy.co.uk/>

Cashel, Loch Lomond 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/scotland/central-scotland/1381-cashel-camping-in-the-forest-site>

Located right on the loch’s “bonnie banks”, this campsite couldn’t be any 
closer to the water without being in it. Despite the fact that there are more 
than 160 camping spaces on the site, it’s not hard to find a pitch with 
unobstructed loch views. Facilities include very powerful showers, and a small 
shop selling groceries and pre-hike cups of coffee. Scaling nearby Ben Lomond 
is a must, for far-reaching views across the rest of Scotland’s first national 
park.
• Pitch for two adults from £13.50 or £17 for family of four, open 
March-October, 0845 130 8224,campingintheforest.co.uk

Twitey’s Tipis, Warwickshire 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/cotswolds/warwickshire/971-twiteys-tipis-and-camping-meadows>

This is a back-to-basics campsite with a relaxed approach and acres of 
car-free space. Upon arrival, guests are presented with a wheelbarrow to help 
move their kit and can choose from 15 flat, mown pitches spread between two 
wildflower meadows. There are tipis to rent, furnished with lanterns and 
kitchen utensils, table and chairs, and logs for a sunset campfire. The site is 
four miles from Stratford-upon-Avon, and there’s lovely countryside to be 
enjoyed along Shakespeare’s Way, a walking route that replicates the 146 miles 
the playwright regularly travelled to and from London.
• Pitch for four from £25 then £5pp, tipis sleeping four from £195 for two 
nights, open all year round, 07725 944204,twiteystipis.co.uk

The Sunny Field, Kent 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/south-east-england/kent/1469-the-sunny-field>

It is little more than a year since Sasha and Philip bought eight grassy acres 
on the Kent Downs, yet already their rural campsite is much-loved. Surrounded 
by ancient trees sheltering the wildflower meadow from the outside world, this 
peaceful enclave is blessed with lovely light. Facilities are basic (portable 
loos and standing taps), but there are campfires at each pitch and dogs are 
welcome. It’s a short stroll downhill to a hot shower in the couple’s 
farmhouse, and the city of Canterbury is a 15-minute drive away.

• Pitch for two £25, then £10/£5 for each extra adult/child, two-night 
minimum, open all year round, 01233 750024,thesunnyfield.co.uk

The Meadows, Cornwall 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/south-west-england/cornwall/1083-the-meadows>

The Meadows’ adults-only policy means tranquillity reigns supreme at this 
campsite in the heart of the Pentewan valley, south of St Austell. A few dozen 
tents and campervans can pitch up right beside the stream that leads to the 
Little Winnick river, or guests can opt to stay in one of two retro-chic 
vintage caravans. A shop sells newlaid eggs from the Meadows’ own flock of 
chickens, and homemade wild garlic pesto – and it also runs a handy book-swap 
service. It’s a 20-minute walk to Pentewan beach, and just a little longer to 
the Lost Gardens of Heligan.
• Pitch for two from £10 then £4pp, caravans for two from £300 a week or £200 
for a weekend, open May-September, 01726 844383,themeadowspentewanvalley.co.uk

The Ceridwen Centre, Carmarthenshire 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/wales/mid-wales/carmarthenshire/940-the-ceridwen-centre>


In 40 acres of lush west Wales farmland, the Ceridwen Centre has just five 
stunning camping pitches in the fabled Teifi Valley, straddling Ceredigion and 
Carmarthenshire. The farm has a wealth of environment-friendly features, 
including solar water heating, a biomass boiler and solar electricity. Glamping 
guests can choose from three handcrafted Welsh yurts, an “eco-pod” for two and 
a 19th-century Romany Gypsy caravan. The centre also hosts workshops, retreats 
and courses.
• Tents from £5 per stay plus £7.50pp (under-threes free), yurt/eco-pod from 
£130/£132 for two nights, caravan from £185 for two nights, open all year,

Camping at Ynysfaen, Brecon Beacons 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/wales/brecon-beacons/547-camping-at-ynysfaen>

Just outside the charming Brecon village of Trecastle lies the refreshingly 
no-frills Ynysfaen campsite. The tents-only five acres beside the babbling Usk 
river makes a great base camp for exploring the Brecon Beacons and Black 
Mountains, and at night the stargazing is unbeatable, as the site is part of the
Brecon Beacons Dark Skies Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/aug/21/brecon-beacons-dark-sky-reserve>
. The Usk reservoir, a mile away, claims to be the darkest place within it. One 
cosy shepherd’s hut for two can also be hired.
• £10pp, shepherd’s hut (sleeps two) £140 for a weekend or £450 a week, open 
late March-October, 01874 636436,campingatynysfaen.co.uk

Underhill Farm, Shropshire 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/central-england/shropshire/1462-underhill-farm>

Despite its yurts, tipi and small cabin, Underhill Farm in rural Shropshire 
doesn’t call itself a glamping site. The focus here is on back-to-basics, 
eco-friendly camping, with almost everything made from recycled materials. Wild 
grass meadows, a copse and a small apple orchard surround a barn space that 
hosts workshops on making use of materials found on the doorstep – willow, clay 
for pottery, and wool for weaving. There are just five tent pitches, with 
campfires permitted in certain areas. Walks nearby could take in limestone 
cliffs for climbing and caving, or the famous Offa’s Dyke footpath.
• £15 per tent for up to four people, barn (sleeps 10) £60 a night, open May 
to the end of the summer holidays, 07773 046111,underhillfarm.org

Eskdale, Lake District 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/lake-district/cumbria/566-eskdale>

Tucked away down a narrow country lane, the Eskdale Camping and Caravanning 
Club site is in one of the Lake District’s most secluded pockets, with eight 
acres of flat, well-maintained, tree-backed grassland and generous pitches 
bordered by a small stream. It’s ideally placed for climbing Scafell Pike. The 
Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway is also right on the doorstep. It may be part of 
the colossal Camping and Caravanning Club, but Eskdale has a cosy atmosphere.
• From £7.70pp, open March-mid January, 01946 723253,

Walkmill, Northumberland 
<https://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/england/north-east-england/northumberland/1648-walkmill-campsite>

Pinned in a meander of the weaving Coquet river, Walkmill’s waterside pitches 
have vast amounts of space, shared only with the sheep that graze here. A short 
stroll away in a caravan and campervan area, facilities include a proper 
bathroom alongside a mobile home that serves as an information centre. It’s two 
miles downstream to the beaches of the Northumberland coast, and on the way 
there’s the impressive cross-shaped keep ofWarkworth Castle 
<http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/warkworth-castle-and-hermitage/>
, one of the strongest fortresses in England.
• Adults £6.50, children £2.50, open May to end of October, 01665 710155,
