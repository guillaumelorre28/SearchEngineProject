The internet of shopping is finally here: magic-like buttons that when pressed 
have goods delivered to your door, without any need to log on to a website or 
get out your credit card. The branded Dash buttons are Amazon’s latest offering 
to make it easier to shop, so I bought a load of them to find out whether it’s 
the retail revolution we didn’t even know we were looking for.

There is no Dash button for ordering Dash buttons, so I looked though the 40 
or so available and found eight for things I would normally buy. They’re £5 
each, so I spent £40 for this convenience, but with the promise £5 would be 
taken off the first purchase made with each button making them free in the long 
run.

A box of boxes turned up the next day. Each Dash button comes in a small 
cardboard box. Unpacking them and setting them up was straightforward if a 
little tedious. For each one you have to do a little song and dance with the
Amazon <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon> app.

the Guardian 
Select the option to set up a new Dash, tell it the password to your Wi-Fi 
network, select the product and quantity and then hit save. The delivery and 
payment information is pulled from your Amazon one-click order settings; 
there’s no way to set per-item delivery locations.

It doesn’t take too long to set one up, but doing eight in one go got old 
really fast. Once activated though, that’s you done. In future all you have to 
do is hit the button – although that proved to be too easy.

Thankfully when you have pushed the button 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu3FTEmN-eg> you get until evening that day to 
cancel the order. When you’ve made an order a notification pops up from the 
Amazon app on the device you set up the Dash buttons with, but you can and 
probably should activate that notification on every device you own.
 Push the button and wait for the green flash to tell you it’s been 
successfully ordered. 
The first time the notification saved my bacon was when I installed the Dash 
buttons. They come with a sticky strip on the back and a small black hanging 
bracket that you can attach to a hook or similar. I chose to stick them in 
place out the way, next to where I’d normally store whatever it was. In the 
bathroom cabinet for toothbrush heads and Listerine, under the sink for bin 
bags, cleaning fluid, that kind of thing.

By the time I’d managed to stick them in place I’d already ordered a set of 
new toothbrush heads by accident, and very nearly some toilet roll and washing 
tablets, none of which I needed. A couple of taps in the app and the order was 
cancelled.

 Were any of them ordered by accident? Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian
I felt good about the installation. They were stuck out the way, inconspicuous 
and convenient and everything was fine. That was, until they started ordering 
stuff on their own. It turns out that the adhesive on the back of the Dash 
buttons doesn’t like sticking to unpainted MDF surfaces within cupboards.

The one I had stuck next to the stocks of shower gel, moisturiser and other 
bits fell off almost immediately within the cupboard, landing as it fell to the 
shelf surface below on an upstanding bottle of nail varnish ordering some 
foundation in the process. The first I knew of it was an order notification.

poster strip. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian 
Presuming it was my fault I simply stuck it back in place with a bit more 
gusto, which lasted for about an hour before another ping and another tube of 
foundation to be cancelled. This was starting to get tedious.

The Rimmel button was just the start of a trend. Over the next few days all 
but two of the buttons dropped off various metal, paint and wooden surfaces, 
some ordering products, others just making a nasty clang in the middle of the 
night and waking me up.

In the end I took the nuclear option and stripped the adhesive gel off the 
back of the Dash buttons, which doesn’t take long if you pull hard enough, and 
replaced them with poster mounting strips, which did the trick.

Once finally, safely attached to the walls it was a couple of weeks before I 
actually pushed any of the buttons on purpose. Then the toilet roll and 
mouthwash began to run out, so it was finally time to put them into action.

Pressing the button was simple. Getting the delivery, however, was not. The 
trouble is that when setting up the toilet roll button the only option was for 
an order of 45 rolls. Normally I’d buy eight at a time; our family doesn’t go 
through toilet paper that quickly.

In order to receive a package the size of 45 rolls I had to order it the day 
before I knew I would be at home to receive it. So I got up on Friday morning, 
hit both the Andrex and Listerine buttons and gleefully waited for them arrive 
on Saturday, my very first internet of things purchases.

That’s when the second round of trouble started. When I hit the button we were 
down to three rolls. But while the 1L of mouthwash arrived on Saturday as 
expected – in a big box, of course – the toilet roll did not. By Sunday morning 
with two toilet rolls left, the order was still “preparing for dispatch” so I 
hit cancel, consoling myself that at least Tesco would provide.

 OK, but where are the toilet rolls? Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian 
Unfortunately Amazon said I couldn’t cancel because it was already on its way, 
but on Monday it was still “dispatching”, so I tried cancelling again, to no 
avail. By Monday evening we were already a good chunk into our last toilet 
roll, with visions of having to resort to kitchen roll or yesterday’s Guardian. 
To make matters worse I was off on holiday on Wednesday and was starting to 
have visions of 45 toilet rolls stuck outside my front door like a giant advert 
to burglars.

Thankfully it arrived sometime on Tuesday. I came home to find it wedged 
behind a bin – luckily it didn’t rain – meaning we’ll be stocked until February 
at least. It was not the best first order experience. Subsequent orders for 
toothbrush heads, Dettol, dishwasher tablets were less painful, primarily 
because I got most of them delivered when one of the family was home for some 
other reason. But it certainly wasn’t a case of simply hit it and forget it.

You can get deliveries sent to an Amazon locker if there are any within 
striking distance, but not everything can fit in one - there’s no way the 
toilet rolls would have. And by the time you’ve gone out to a locker to pick up 
some Listerine you might just as well have gone to the supermarket.

Washing tablets, like toilet roll, presented a scale problem. While the 
tablets arrived on time, they arrived in serious quantity: 180 tabs across six 
boxes, which at a rate of about one or two a week, is going to last me at least 
18 months and feels like I’ve turned my house into a warehouse full of them. 
The Rimmel button, for a product that would fit through the letter box, has 
still never been intentionally pressed.

Amazon pitched the Dash buttons as a way of avoiding the need to fill up your 
house with large stocks of the boring things in life, but when the order 
quantities are vast, the next day delivery fails or you simply don’t have 
someone there everyday to receive deliveries, they’re more trouble than they’re 
worth.

Perhaps if you’re part of the metropolitan elite and your serviced apartment 
comes with a concierge, or you work from home or someone is always in, the 
brain-free push of the Dash button is a great idea. But the convenience of 
pushing a button is outweighed by the hassle for me.

I’ll be keeping some of them for smaller items - they are great for toothbrush 
heads and bin liners – and getting them delivered to work but the Andrex button 
and any others for heavy goods are going: it’s just easier to go to a 
supermarket and pick them up, or order them in a big weekly online grocery shop.

The novelty of Amazon dash buttons wore off even faster than the adhesive 
backing.
