Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, has set the 
stage for a potential clash with China, saying it should be barred from 
artificial islands it has built in theSouth China Sea

Tillerson said China’s control and construction of artificial islands in 
waters claimed by neighbouring 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/17/philippines-to-set-aside-south-china-sea-tribunal-ruling-to-avoid-imposing-on-beijing>
 countries was “akin to Russia’s taking of Crimea”.

China claims sovereignty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/jul/12/south-china-sea-dispute-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-hague-court-ruling>
 over almost the entire South China Sea, building seven artificial islands on 
reefs and rocks and outfitting them withmilitary-length airstrips and 
anti-aircraft guns

.

“We’re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the 
island-building stops and, second, your access to those islands also is not 
going to be allowed,” Tillerson said duringhis confirmation hearing

 to become America’s top diplomat. “They are taking territory or control or 
declaring control of territories that are not rightfully China’s.”

The statements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/11/rex-tillerson-confirmation-hearing-trump-russia>
 are sure to worry China, which has taken an extremely rigid stance on 
challenges to its sovereignty claims. Last year, an international tribunal 
ruled much of China’s territorial claims were invalid, but had little effect and
the Chinese government ignored the verdict

.

“[Chinese president] Xi Jinping will not be seen as weak and soft in the face 
of pressure from the United States, so I really do worry about an early crisis 
withChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china>,” said Bonnie Glaser senior 
adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “China 
is not going to allow the United States to deny it access to what it sees as 
its own territory.”

Nevertheless, in its first response to Tillerson’s comments, China’s foreign 
ministry stressed the importance of mutual respect and cooperation with the US. 
China-US relations are based on “non-confrontation, non-conflict, mutual 
benefit and win-win cooperation,” spokesman Lu Kang Lu said at a daily briefing.

The “situation has cooled down [in the South China Sea], and we hope 
non-regional countries can respect this consensus that is in the fundamental 
interest of the whole world,” Lu said.

His comments presented China’s control over the area as a forgone conclusion, 
and indeed it would be difficult for the US to change the facts on the ground 
without a military confrontation. Experts say China is waiting until Trump 
assumes the presidency and begins shaping policy before reacting too forcefully.

“China has been restrained in the face of all the tweets and rhetoric because 
they hope they can put the US-China relationship on an even keel,” Glaser said. 
“The Chinese have not given up on that, but at some point Xi Jinping may have 
to because being seen as weak would damage his ability to consolidate power.”

This year is crucial for Xi as his first term winds down. A critical Communist 
party meeting at the end of the year will involve a cabinet shuffle and will 
likely determine who succeeds Xi, with leaders locked in a power struggle to 
appoint their allies.

While Tillerson did not elaborate on how the US would bar China from islands 
in the South China Sea, experts agreed it would have to involve some form of 
military deployment.

“Blocking China’s access, presumably with US warships, would precipitate a 
crisis, a military clash,” said Ashley Townshend, a fellow at the University of 
Sydney’s United States studies centre.

“It is also illegal under the same rules the US is conducting all of its 
current policy in the South China Sea.”

Under Barack Obama, the US maintained a neutral stance on sovereignty claims, 
not recognising any ownership and often sailing warships through the South 
China Sea in what it called freedom of navigation exercises.

“Tillerson, like Trump, is shaping up to taking a much more hawkish stance 
with China on the South China Sea and indeed more broadly,” Townshend added.

But a more assertive stance on what China sees as its territorial integrity is 
likely to cause more tension, with Xi saying ina speech last year 
<http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2016-07/06/content_25989430.htm>: “No 
foreign country should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit of damage to our 
sovereignty, security and development interests.”

Tillerson also slammed China for failing to reign in North Korea’s nuclear 
program, describing China as having “complete control over what sustains the 
government of North Korea.”

“We cannot continue to accept empty promises, like the ones China has made 
made to pressure North Korea to reform only to shy away from enforcement,” 
Tillerson said. “Looking the other way when trust is broken only encourages 
more bad behavior. It must end.”

The boisterous language on both the South China Sea and North Korea is 
unlikely to force China to act, and may even hamper efforts of Trump’s 
administration to encourage cooperation in other areas.

“I can’t think of a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue that doesn’t 
involve China and the US working together,” Townshend said. “But publicly 
calling out China is not the best strategy if you are trying to induce them to 
cooperate.”
