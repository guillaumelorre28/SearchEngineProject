Seventeen years after Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall established his River 
Cottage HQ on the Devon-Dorset border, there’s been a slow but subtle change in 
the way Dorset is perceived by foodies and chefs. “Dorset has gone from being a 
sleepy county to a place where people and chefs are gravitating,” says James 
Golding, chef-director ofThe Pig on The Beach, which opened in Studland last 
summer to great acclaim

The next big thing to hit Dorset’s shores will be the Seaside Boarding House 
<http://theseasideboardinghouse.com/>, which is scheduled to open in 
mid-February. The eight rooms will cost £200 B&B; the menu is still under 
wraps, but “will offer something for everyone, from a picnic hamper for the 
beach, to a casual lunch to a more formal dinner”. At Burton Bradstock and 
overlooking Lyme Bay, it has already been dubbed “the Groucho on the Sea” as 
it’s the latest venture by Mary-Lou Sturridge and her business partner Anthony 
Mackintosh, who founded the members-only Groucho Club in Soho, London, in 1985.

“When I moved here six years ago, there was nowhere to go for a really good 
meal,” says Sturridge. “That’s no longer the case. We’re lucky to live in such 
a wild county with lots of smallholders and are blessed with produce.”

Here’s our pick of the best eating the county has to offer:

The Hive Beach cafe, Burton Bradstock

Diners can enjoy exquisite seafood at this cafe overlooking the pebble beach 
and sea at Chesil bank. Spider crabs caught from the beach below, brown crabs 
from Lyme Bay, legendary crab sandwiches and hand-dived scallops are served 
year round, while during summer sun-seekers can grab a local Craig’s Farm Dairy 
ice-cream sundae at the Beach Hut. The menu changes daily to reflect the 
fishermen’s catch. In the winter, the seafront terrace is closed off with side 
screens to create a cosier spot from which to view the Jurassic Coast.
• From £10.95 for grilled Cornish coast sardines to £24.50 for line-caught

The Grade II-listed hotel, with a shabby-chic interior and a courtyard 
decorated with fairy lights, offers a varied menu in its main restaurant. As 
well as local seafood such as pan-fried Lyme Bay tandoori scallops with 
chickpea and yoghurt (£9.50), there’s spice-crusted rump of Dorset lamb, 
spinach and coconut milk potatoes and a moilee-tomato sauce for £19. There’s 
also a more relaxed pizza and cider house,The Stable <http://stablepizza.com/>, 
at the back of the Bull: the Ford Farm four-cheese special includes Dorset 
blue, smoked red, goat’s milk cheddar and Wookey Hole aged cheddar (£10). 
Bridport’s cultural scene has also come alive in the last few years, with the 
revival of music and arts at theElectric Palace 
<http://www.electricpalace.org.uk/> – described by Ian Gillan from Deep Purple 
as the best small venue in the UK – and a monthly antiques and vintage market.

possible – fish fingers with chips and mushy peas and simple grilled fish on 
the bone served with hollandaise sauce in this light and airy restaurant with 
relaxing coastal views. The whole Lyme Bay crab (£14.50) is popular, and 
there’s a wide variety of oysters, such as Brownsea Island or Portland Pearls 
at £2.25 each. Fish House Suppers for groups of 10 or more are priced at £45pp 
per person, and Hix also hosts and organises festivals, such as theLyme Regis

The charmingly styled hotel restaurant features fish direct from Poole Bay, 
and ingredients sourced by a team of local foragers and from the impressive 
walled kitchen garden. Dorset Crab on toast with pennywort salad and pickled 
daisies (£8.50), or home smoked pork belly (from its own smoking shed) with 
Dorset olives, Isle of Wight tomatoes and spring onion (£16) are among the 
tempting items on a menu that focuses on fish and pork. The hotel is set on the 
beautiful Studland coastline overlooking King Harry Rocks and Poole Harbour 
and, if it’s not warm enough to dine lingeringly beside the elegant lawn, then 
there are cosy fireside seats in the bar that are just as inviting for a 
post-prandial cocktail.
