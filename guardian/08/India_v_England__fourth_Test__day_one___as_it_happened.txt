So, England are in the ascendancy. Runs on the board, plenty of batting in the 
middle and to come, and a pitch that is going to become increasingly vicious. 
Of course, they might still get rolled in the morning and then be flayed by 
Kohli, but in the meantime, they’re looking good.

Oh, and the boy Keaton Jennings, scored a century on debut. But how many Nice 
and Spicy Nik Naks can he eat in one sitting?

94th over: England 288-5 (Stokes 25, Buttler 18) Jadeja will bowl the last 
over the day, and some kicking turn fires the ball at Stokes, but he’s well 
outside off stump and takes it on the body. He’s defended really well since his 
earlier roasting, and Kohli sends a man back for the final delivery, then 
Jadeja aborts his run-up, but Stokes is equanimous in defence and that’s the 
end of a fantastic day.

93rd over: England 288-5 (Stokes 25, Buttler 18) Ashwin returns, but with a 
tired loosener, and Buttler, for all his earlier confusion, does not miss out, 
slamming four through the covers. Two singles follow, and England are nearly 
there.

“These people mentioning the Jennings books need to think High Art rather than 
children’s literature,” says Fran Mason. “Alastair Cook in his interviews has 
himself revealed that Jennings is ‘Keats’. Yes, it’s just a shortened form of 
Keaton, but a century on debut is both a thing of truth and a thing of beauty 
(even if it’s scratched together) because as the lad himself said ‘Beauty is 
truth, truth beauty – that is all /Ye know on earth and all ye need to know’. 
As an aside, he was also clearly talking about cricket in the last part.”

Jennings is high art. I am now in a frightful bate.

92nd over: England 282-5 (Stokes 24, Buttler 13) Ashwin is warming up as 
Jayant sees Buttler coming down, dropping short - Buttler bumps to leg and they 
run one. Stokes then cuts a further single, and Buttler does the same, using 
his feet again to take the ball on the full and prevent it spinning.

91st over: England 279-5 (Stokes 23, Buttler 11) And to rub it in, Stokes 
flicks four to fine leg when Jadeja strays; Kohli looks to still be considering 
the wasted review. this has been a good 20 minutes for England.

REVIEW! NOT OUT!

Impact was umpire’s call, just on the edge of the line. It was hitting the 
stumps, but that wasn’t enough - Stokes was saved by his stride.

91st over: England 274-5 (Stokes 19, Buttler 10) The third umpire fingers the 
new ball as Jadeja hurries in again, and after Buttler hustles one to 
midwicket, there’s an appeal when Stokes takes one on the pad. Then again next 
ball, and this time Jadeja is convinced. No one else is, but so beseeching is 
he that Kohli goes upstairs.

90th over: England 274-5 (Stokes 19, Buttler 10) A quiet over, which will 
please England greatly. It’s not long till we see Ashwin back, I shouldn’t 
wonder, perhaps with the new ball. 15 or so minutes left in the day.

89th over: England 272-5 (Stokes 18, Buttler 9) I wonder if England are still 
happy with their four seamers. My guess is they are - they’ll bowl dry, rotated 
from one end, with whichever of spinners is bowling well looking to take 
wickets at the other. Buttler is on strike to Jadeja, not something he’ll want 
to continue - he’s looked much more in tune with himself against Jayant. And 
there’s another edge, earning two to fine leg, and slowly, England are reaching 
the point at which a defendable total is almost unavoidable.

87th over: England 268-5 (Stokes 17, Buttler 6) Jadeja comes on for Ashwin, 
presumably with that new ball in mind, and after Stokes nabs a single through 
mid on, Buttler edges four. Then Jadeja, bowling around, sends down a fuller 
one and Buttler goes back then leaves - a phenomenal amount of misjudgment 
packed into about a third of a second. He gets away with it.

86th over: England 263-5 (Stokes 16, Buttler 2) Jayant draws Stokes forward 
and he edges to gully - again, the ball drops agonisingly, triumphantly short; 
Kohli gets Pandey a helmet and brings him even further forward. Stokes then 
cuts for one, and two more singles follow; perhaps England are through the 
worst of it.

85th over: England 260-5 (Stokes 14, Buttler 1) Stokes picks Ashwin’s length 
and checks his pull, edging into his midriff and sending Patel scurrying 
forwards seeking a catch. He chides himself for not seeing the shot through, 
because he was there early enough to deliver it. All set for him to get himself 
out playing it at the wrong time.

84th over: England 259-5 (Stokes 13, Buttler 1) Buttler edges one that drops 
just short of leg slip so tries coming down the track - Jayant is wise to it, 
dropping shorter. But there’s a sign, with the penultimate ball of the over, 
that he’s starting to feel comfortable - he brings his bat inside the line and 
allows the spin to do its thing in the meantime. Maiden.

83rd over: England 259-5 (Stokes 13, Buttler 1) “He’s a good team man,” says 
Botham of Stokes. “Always there if they’re playing golf.” Case closed, m’lud. 
There is nothing better than tales of sportsmen playing golf, but back out in 
the middle, Stokes miscues four and is then completely done when Ashwin 
javelins one in flat that grips and phlegms to slip.

82nd over: England 255-5 (Stokes 9, Buttler 1) Paul Reiffel is fine, say 
Cricinfo - CT scan clear, precautionary rest advised. Stokes gets two with an 
edge, then a single, and Jayant looks like he’s bowling with Oddball of Whizzer 
and Chips fame - Buttler currently looks like Butthead, without the laughs. 
He’s almost done by the final delivery, inside edging into his pad.

“I wonder if Boycs will have as much of a go at YJB as he did at Moeen?” 
tweets Guy Hornsby. “Both risky shots on this wicket@DanielHarris 
<https://twitter.com/DanielHarris> Oh, ENGLAND. #rhubarb 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/rhubarb?src=hash>”.

In a way it’s hard to be vex with either, though Moeen might have recalibrated 
his mind against Ashwin, not tried to hit a six over against the spin. Bairstow 
might also have tried to stay in, especially given the doing Stokes is in the 
middle of. Or, put another way, I really don’t know, perhaps because it’s 
unknowable.

81st over: England 249-5 (Stokes 5, Buttler 0) I’d like to know what Ashwin 
has for this spell - I think it’s, er, 3-9. Yes, really. And nearly another, 
when one rips past Buttler’s bat. England need another 100, reckons Beefy. Er, 
ok then.

WICKET! Bairstow c Umesh Yadav b Ashwin 14 (England 249-5)

What a half-hour this has been for India! Bairstow premeditates a sweep, the 
ball is too full, and he top-edges to deep backward square. He looks somewhat 
disappointed with his behaviours.

80th over: England 249-4 (Bairstow 14, Stokes 5) Three singles off the over, 
but the last ball turns and bounces past Stokes’ outside-edge - again. India 
review, but only because their larder is replenished next over. Not sure 
“tactical review” is the right term for it, though.

Bob O’Hara emails in with bad news for Kim Thonger and civilisation at large.


“Dear Bob O’Hara,

We rejected the petition you supported – ‘Require Keaton Jennings’ opening 
partners to change their surname to Darbishire’.

It’s offensive, nonsense, a joke, or an advert.

We only reject petitions that don’t meet the petition standards:


Thanks,


The Petitions team
UK Government and Parliament”.

I don’t even recognise this country anymore.

79th over: England 246-4 (Bairstow 12, Stokes 4) So, should Bairstow try and 
face Ashwin as much as possible, or should he protect his wicket as the man in 
form? Stokes gets himself off strike, second ball of the over, and then 
Bairstow adds a single of his own. Drinks.

78th over: England 244-4 (Bairstow 11, Stokes 3) Jayant returns, and things 
don’t get easier for Stokes, who plays more deliberately at one that turns away 
from him nonetheless. At the moment, he looks like a hippo trying to thread a 
needle. But he gets down the other end via cut, and then Bairstow, who still 
looks in nick, comes down the track and finds himself short, so closes the face 
with serious expertise, earning the first boundary in a while.

77th over: England 239-4 (Bairstow 7, Stokes 2) A single to Bairstow from the 
first ball of the over gives Ashwin five at Stokes, and he completely befuddles 
him with an arm ball, flicked with the forefinger, that’s quicker and flatter. 
Stokes plays for the spin and it scootsjust past off stump, as Kohli and Patel, 
who did read it, giggle with mirth and frustration.

76th over: England 237-4 (Bairstow 6, Stokes 1) Bairstow’s beard looks 
especially peculiar in combination with the strap on his helmet; he’d be a good 
Guess Who character. And his fellow ginger ninja would too - MB Games failed to 
anticipate the growing prevalence of body art.

75th over: England 236-4 (Bairstow 5, Stokes 1) Bairstow is allowing himself 
as much time as possible to see what’s going on, looking to play back whenever 
he can. He takes two through midwicket, then a single to square leg, but all 
that does is give Ashwin a go at his buddy and again, he goes from wide of the 
crease and conjures one past the outside edge. Stokes is getting an absolute 
shoeing here, but is still here.

74th over: England 233-4 (Bairstow 2, Stokes 1) India have put the thumbscrews 
on England here, and given two attacking batsmen, something is going to give; 
probably the aforementioned thumbs. One off the over, to Bairstow, who goes 
back and shoves into the leg side.

73rd over: England 232-4 (Bairstow 1, Stokes 1) Bairstow sweeps nicely to open 
his account, but then Stokes is diddled by an absolute beauty that Ashwin 
brings in from wide of the crease that turns away across the face of the bat. 
Far, far too good. And then another, on leg and turning square; Stokes can only 
laugh as Ashwin is forced to curtail his celebration on account of being too 
good once again.

72nd over: England 231-4 (Bairstow 0, Stokes 1) England cannot afford to lose 
too many more tonight. If they get rustled f0r anything below 350, they’re in 
big trouble.

“  Now I am safely at work I thought you might be interested in this as it is 
an eye watering version of Smells like Teen Spirit, but you can hear the 
words,” emails John Tumbridge.

Nah, that ruins the fun. I remember reading the inlay of the cassette trying 
to allocate the various lyrics in the paragraph we were given, waiting for my 
Walkman batteries to run low, before accidentally disturbing the plastic cover 
on the sheet music in HMV.

71st over: England 231-4 (Bairstow 0, Stokes 1) Suddenly, 400 looks a nice 
total again, with both set batsmen gone. Stokes turns to midwicket to get off 
the mark first ball, and the crowd are up, the Indians are up, and what a 
session of cricket we have to elevate our otherwise tedious existences. What an 
over that was;what an over.

WICKET! Jennings c Pujara b Ashwin 112 (England 230-4)

The height of subcontinental cricket, the height of England, the height of 
Ravi Ashwin! This is a lovely ball, fired at off stump, bringing Jennings 
forward, and drawing the edge that flew to the gully that had only just been 
sent in.
 Keaton Jennings edges the ball into the hands of India’s Cheteshwar Pujara.

71st over: England 230-3 (Jennings 112, Bairstow 0) On the one hand, Moeen was 
taking the attack to India with England in a good position; on the other, might 
he have had a look at Ashwin, or treated him differently from Jadeja and Jayant?

WICKET! Moeen Ali c Nair b Ashwin 50 (England 230-3)

I doubt anyone even needs to be furnished with detail here, but for the sake 
of process, here is it. Ashwin returns to the attack because he has to, Moeen 
tries another slog-sweep, imparts every millimetre of his top edge, and Nair 
holds a dolly at midwicket. Moeen, Moeen, Moeen, Moeeeeeheeeeheeen....

70th over: England 230-2 (Jennings 112, Moeen 50) Jennings swishes at a wide 
one, it takes some rough and ends up at slip, and then Moeen, who took a single 
from the first ball of the over, glides another into the covers and celebrates 
another fifty. He is always a pleasure to watch, whether performing cricket or 
comedy.

69th over: England 227-2 (Jennings 111, Moeen 48) Or should it be 
Sangawardene-style? Anyway. Kohli and Jadeja have a meeting, forced to rethink 
things for the first time in a fair few days’ play.

68th over: England 225-2 (Jennings 110, Moeen 47) Jennings takes a single 
could be the title of a book but is in fact what just happened, so Jayant goes 
around the wicket and Moeen gathers him from outside off to hump a slog-sweep 
to the midwicket fence. And there’s another! In the air this time, one bounce 
and over the fence. England are batting like a sub-continental team here: work 
hard through the day, cash-in in the final session, Kumhela-style.

A correction from David Green: “Unless the sentence were ‘Nasser, a dab hand 
at running his partner out in his time....’”.

67th over: England 216-2 (Jennings 109, Moeen 39) Single to Moeen, behind 
square on the off side, then one to Jennings, miscuing a drive that was meant 
to go over mid-on and ends up at deep square.

“Wikipedia appears to have been ‘moderated’,” emails Nick in Cambodia. 
“Jennings’ height varied from ‘6ft - 1in’ to ‘As tall as the Burj Khalifa’ ... 
and now the height category has gone. Was fun while it lasted.”

I wonder how old Rabbie Walpole is getting on.

66th over: England 214-2 (Jennings 108, Moeen 38) Jennings has such an array 
of shots; Jayant’s first ball is greeted with another sweep, but this one is 
struck powerfully and in front of square - “it can leave you thinking you’re a 
fielder short,” says Nasser, referencing the dab and reverses that we’ve 
already seen. “Dab”, not a word anyone ever expected to see in the same 
sentence as “Nasser”.

So, England are in the ascendancy. Runs on the board, plenty of batting in the 
middle and to come, and a pitch that is going to become increasingly vicious. 
Of course, they might still get rolled in the morning and then be flayed by 
Kohli, but in the meantime, they’re looking good.

Oh, and the boy Keaton Jennings, scored a century on debut. But how many Nice 
and Spicy Nik Naks can he eat in one sitting?

over the day, and some kicking turn fires the ball at Stokes, but he’s well 
outside off stump and takes it on the body. He’s defended really well since his 
earlier roasting, and Kohli sends a man back for the final delivery, then 
Jadeja aborts his run-up, but Stokes is equanimous in defence and that’s the 
end of a fantastic day.
 
93rd over: England 288-5 (Stokes 25, Buttler 18) Ashwin returns, but with a 
tired loosener, and Buttler, for all his earlier confusion, does not miss out, 
slamming four through the covers. Two singles follow, and England are nearly 
there.

“These people mentioning the Jennings books need to think High Art rather than 
children’s literature,” says Fran Mason. “Alastair Cook in his interviews has 
himself revealed that Jennings is ‘Keats’. Yes, it’s just a shortened form of 
Keaton, but a century on debut is both a thing of truth and a thing of beauty 
(even if it’s scratched together) because as the lad himself said ‘Beauty is 
truth, truth beauty – that is all /Ye know on earth and all ye need to know’. 
As an aside, he was also clearly talking about cricket in the last part.”

Jennings is high art. I am now in a frightful bate. 
 
92nd over: England 282-5 (Stokes 24, Buttler 13) Ashwin is warming up as 
Jayant sees Buttler coming down, dropping short - Buttler bumps to leg and they 
run one. Stokes then cuts a further single, and Buttler does the same, using 
his feet again to take the ball on the full and prevent it spinning.
 
91st over: England 279-5 (Stokes 23, Buttler 11) And to rub it in, Stokes 
flicks four to fine leg when Jadeja strays; Kohli looks to still be considering 
the wasted review. this has been a good 20 minutes for England.
 
Impact was umpire’s call, just on the edge of the line. It was hitting the 
stumps, but that wasn’t enough - Stokes was saved by his stride.
 
91st over: England 274-5 (Stokes 19, Buttler 10) The third umpire fingers the 
new ball as Jadeja hurries in again, and after Buttler hustles one to 
midwicket, there’s an appeal when Stokes takes one on the pad. Then again next 
ball, and this time Jadeja is convinced. No one else is, but so beseeching is 
he that Kohli goes upstairs.
 
90th over: England 274-5 (Stokes 19, Buttler 10) A quiet over, which will 
please England greatly. It’s not long till we see Ashwin back, I shouldn’t 
wonder, perhaps with the new ball. 15 or so minutes left in the day.
 
89th over: England 272-5 (Stokes 18, Buttler 9) I wonder if England are still 
happy with their four seamers. My guess is they are - they’ll bowl dry, rotated 
from one end, with whichever of spinners is bowling well looking to take 
wickets at the other. Buttler is on strike to Jadeja, not something he’ll want 
to continue - he’s looked much more in tune with himself against Jayant. And 
there’s another edge, earning two to fine leg, and slowly, England are reaching 
the point at which a defendable total is almost unavoidable.
 
88th over: England 270-5 (Stokes 18, Buttler 7) Stokes takes a single, then 
Buttler does the same - his feet are starting to move.

87th over: England 268-5 (Stokes 17, Buttler 6) Jadeja comes on for Ashwin, 
presumably with that new ball in mind, and after Stokes nabs a single through 
mid on, Buttler edges four. Then Jadeja, bowling around, sends down a fuller 
one and Buttler goes back then leaves - a phenomenal amount of misjudgment 
packed into about a third of a second. He gets away with it.
 
86th over: England 263-5 (Stokes 16, Buttler 2) Jayant draws Stokes forward 
and he edges to gully - again, the ball drops agonisingly, triumphantly short; 
Kohli gets Pandey a helmet and brings him even further forward. Stokes then 
cuts for one, and two more singles follow; perhaps England are through the 
worst of it.
 
85th over: England 260-5 (Stokes 14, Buttler 1) Stokes picks Ashwin’s length 
and checks his pull, edging into his midriff and sending Patel scurrying 
forwards seeking a catch. He chides himself for not seeing the shot through, 
because he was there early enough to deliver it. All set for him to get himself 
out playing it at the wrong time.
 
84th over: England 259-5 (Stokes 13, Buttler 1) Buttler edges one that drops 
just short of leg slip so tries coming down the track - Jayant is wise to it, 
dropping shorter. But there’s a sign, with the penultimate ball of the over, 
that he’s starting to feel comfortable - he brings his bat inside the line and 
allows the spin to do its thing in the meantime. Maiden.
 
83rd over: England 259-5 (Stokes 13, Buttler 1) “He’s a good team man,” says 
Botham of Stokes. “Always there if they’re playing golf.” Case closed, m’lud. 
There is nothing better than tales of sportsmen playing golf, but back out in 
the middle, Stokes miscues four and is then completely done when Ashwin 
javelins one in flat that grips and phlegms to slip.
 
82nd over: England 255-5 (Stokes 9, Buttler 1) Paul Reiffel is fine, say 
Cricinfo - CT scan clear, precautionary rest advised. Stokes gets two with an 
edge, then a single, and Jayant looks like he’s bowling with Oddball of Whizzer 
and Chips fame - Buttler currently looks like Butthead, without the laughs. 
He’s almost done by the final delivery, inside edging into his pad.

“I wonder if Boycs will have as much of a go at YJB as he did at Moeen?” 
tweets Guy Hornsby. “Both risky shots on this wicket@DanielHarris 
<https://twitter.com/DanielHarris> Oh, ENGLAND. #rhubarb 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/rhubarb?src=hash>”.

In a way it’s hard to be vex with either, though Moeen might have recalibrated 
his mind against Ashwin, not tried to hit a six over against the spin. Bairstow 
might also have tried to stay in, especially given the doing Stokes is in the 
middle of. Or, put another way, I really don’t know, perhaps because it’s 
unknowable.
 
81st over: England 249-5 (Stokes 5, Buttler 0) I’d like to know what Ashwin 
has for this spell - I think it’s, er, 3-9. Yes, really. And nearly another, 
when one rips past Buttler’s bat. England need another 100, reckons Beefy. Er, 
ok then.
 
What a half-hour this has been for India! Bairstow premeditates a sweep, the 
ball is too full, and he top-edges to deep backward square. He looks somewhat 
disappointed with his behaviours.

80th over: England 249-4 (Bairstow 14, Stokes 5) Three singles off the over, 
but the last ball turns and bounces past Stokes’ outside-edge - again. India 
review, but only because their larder is replenished next over. Not sure 
“tactical review” is the right term for it, though.

79th over: England 246-4 (Bairstow 12, Stokes 4) So, should Bairstow try and 
face Ashwin as much as possible, or should he protect his wicket as the man in 
form? Stokes gets himself off strike, second ball of the over, and then 
Bairstow adds a single of his own. Drinks.
 
78th over: England 244-4 (Bairstow 11, Stokes 3) Jayant returns, and things 
don’t get easier for Stokes, who plays more deliberately at one that turns away 
from him nonetheless. At the moment, he looks like a hippo trying to thread a 
needle. But he gets down the other end via cut, and then Bairstow, who still 
looks in nick, comes down the track and finds himself short, so closes the face 
with serious expertise, earning the first boundary in a while.
 
77th over: England 239-4 (Bairstow 7, Stokes 2) A single to Bairstow from the 
first ball of the over gives Ashwin five at Stokes, and he completely befuddles 
him with an arm ball, flicked with the forefinger, that’s quicker and flatter. 
Stokes plays for the spin and it scootsjust past off stump, as Kohli and Patel, 
who did read it, giggle with mirth and frustration.
 
76th over: England 237-4 (Bairstow 6, Stokes 1) Bairstow’s beard looks 
especially peculiar in combination with the strap on his helmet; he’d be a good 
Guess Who character. And his fellow ginger ninja would too - MB Games failed to 
anticipate the growing prevalence of body art.
 
75th over: England 236-4 (Bairstow 5, Stokes 1) Bairstow is allowing himself 
as much time as possible to see what’s going on, looking to play back whenever 
he can. He takes two through midwicket, then a single to square leg, but all 
that does is give Ashwin a go at his buddy and again, he goes from wide of the 
crease and conjures one past the outside edge. Stokes is getting an absolute 
shoeing here, but is still here.

74th over: England 233-4 (Bairstow 2, Stokes 1) India have put the thumbscrews 
on England here, and given two attacking batsmen, something is going to give; 
probably the aforementioned thumbs. One off the over, to Bairstow, who goes 
back and shoves into the leg side.
 
73rd over: England 232-4 (Bairstow 1, Stokes 1) Bairstow sweeps nicely to open 
his account, but then Stokes is diddled by an absolute beauty that Ashwin 
brings in from wide of the crease that turns away across the face of the bat. 
Far, far too good. And then another, on leg and turning square; Stokes can only 
laugh as Ashwin is forced to curtail his celebration on account of being too 
good once again.
 
72nd over: England 231-4 (Bairstow 0, Stokes 1) England cannot afford to lose 
too many more tonight. If they get rustled f0r anything below 350, they’re in 
big trouble.

“  Now I am safely at work I thought you might be interested in this as it is 
an eye watering version of Smells like Teen Spirit, but you can hear the 
words,” emails John Tumbridge.

Nah, that ruins the fun. I remember reading the inlay of the cassette trying 
to allocate the various lyrics in the paragraph we were given, waiting for my 
Walkman batteries to run low, before accidentally disturbing the plastic cover 
on the sheet music in HMV.
 
71st over: England 231-4 (Bairstow 0, Stokes 1) Suddenly, 400 looks a nice 
total again, with both set batsmen gone. Stokes turns to midwicket to get off 
the mark first ball, and the crowd are up, the Indians are up, and what a 
session of cricket we have to elevate our otherwise tedious existences. What an 
over that was;what an over.
 
The height of subcontinental cricket, the height of England, the height of 
Ravi Ashwin! This is a lovely ball, fired at off stump, bringing Jennings 
forward, and drawing the edge that flew to the gully that had only just been 
sent in.

71st over: England 230-3 (Jennings 112, Bairstow 0) On the one hand, Moeen was 
taking the attack to India with England in a good position; on the other, might 
he have had a look at Ashwin, or treated him differently from Jadeja and Jayant?
 
I doubt anyone even needs to be furnished with detail here, but for the sake 
of process, here is it. Ashwin returns to the attack because he has to, Moeen 
tries another slog-sweep, imparts every millimetre of his top edge, and Nair 
holds a dolly at midwicket. Moeen, Moeen, Moeen, Moeeeeeheeeeheeen....
 
70th over: England 230-2 (Jennings 112, Moeen 50) Jennings swishes at a wide 
one, it takes some rough and ends up at slip, and then Moeen, who took a single 
from the first ball of the over, glides another into the covers and celebrates 
another fifty. He is always a pleasure to watch, whether performing cricket or 
comedy.
 
69th over: England 227-2 (Jennings 111, Moeen 48) Or should it be 
Sangawardene-style? Anyway. Kohli and Jadeja have a meeting, forced to rethink 
things for the first time in a fair few days’ play.
 
68th over: England 225-2 (Jennings 110, Moeen 47) Jennings takes a single 
could be the title of a book but is in fact what just happened, so Jayant goes 
around the wicket and Moeen gathers him from outside off to hump a slog-sweep 
to the midwicket fence. And there’s another! In the air this time, one bounce 
and over the fence. England are batting like a sub-continental team here: work 
hard through the day, cash-in in the final session, Kumhela-style.

A correction from David Green: “Unless the sentence were ‘Nasser, a dab hand 
at running his partner out in his time....’”.
 
67th over: England 216-2 (Jennings 109, Moeen 39) Single to Moeen, behind 
square on the off side, then one to Jennings, miscuing a drive that was meant 
to go over mid-on and ends up at deep square.

“Wikipedia appears to have been ‘moderated’,” emails Nick in Cambodia. 
“Jennings’ height varied from ‘6ft - 1in’ to ‘As tall as the Burj Khalifa’ ... 
and now the height category has gone. Was fun while it lasted.”

I wonder how old Rabbie Walpole is getting on. 
 
66th over: England 214-2 (Jennings 108, Moeen 38) Jennings has such an array 
of shots; Jayant’s first ball is greeted with another sweep, but this one is 
struck powerfully and in front of square - “it can leave you thinking you’re a 
fielder short,” says Nasser, referencing the dab and reverses that we’ve 
already seen. “Dab”, not a word anyone ever expected to see in the same 
sentence as “Nasser”.
