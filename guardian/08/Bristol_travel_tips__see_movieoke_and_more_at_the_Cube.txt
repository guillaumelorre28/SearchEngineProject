There are three good independent cinemas in Bristol: a dockside arthouse 
called the Watershed (watershed.co.uk <http://www.watershed.co.uk/>); a rare 
family local called the Orpheus (scottcinemas.co.uk 
<http://www.scottcinemas.co.uk/>); and the Cube, which is the hardest to 
classify, and all the better for that. The innocuous brick shack that houses it 
prepares you neither for the warmth of its atmosphere nor the ambition of its 
programming, which spills over from second-run features into unsung foreign 
documentaries, orchestral improvisation, live music and live film re-enactments 
(movieoke <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movieoke>).

Local film-makers are represented, causes are supported in the listings and 
discussed in the bar, and its cult films programme, rather than a string of 
tired slashers, is an expansive roster of excavated gems curated by Clifton 
video rental shop 20th Century Flicks (3 Richmond Terrace,
20thcenturyflicks.co.uk <http://20thcenturyflicks.co.uk/>), an institution in 
its own right. Open since 1998, the Cube is a slow-burning landmark that was 
there before many of Stokes Croft's more vociferous hippy initiatives, and will 
probably outlast them.
