In a nutshell
All the tales ever told are said to boil down to seven basic plots, but 
there’s another reason the National Centre for Children’s Books is named Seven 
Stories: it is housed in a seven-storey converted Victorian flour mill in the 
arty Ouseburn Valley district. Three floors are colourful galleries devoted to 
children’s storytelling and picture-book illustration and current shows include 
a celebration of theillustrator and author Michael Foreman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2015/jul/19/michael-foreman-painting-with-rainbows-in-pictures>
 and a global exploration of nursery rhymes. The cosy attic hosts daily 
storytelling sessions; the basement studio invites young storytellers to draw, 
dress up and play, and cushion-strewn reading corners are dotted throughout.

Fun fact
Michael Morpurgo <https://www.theguardian.com/books/michaelmorpurgo> recently 
donated his entire archive to the museum; an exhibition dedicated to his 
poignant storytelling will open next year.

Best thing about it
“Illustrating Harry Potter 
<http://www.sevenstories.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/433/illustrating-harry-potter>
” (on the sixth floor until mid-April 2016) is dedicated to Jim Kay, who won 
the jackpot when he was commissioned to illustrate Bloomsbury Publishing’s new 
editions of JK Rowling’s novels. Video footage, drawings and original final 
artworks explain how he re-imagined beloved characters and locations.
