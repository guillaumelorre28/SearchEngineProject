The prime minister wants you to spend your holidays in the north of England 
this year. David Cameron haslaunched a £1m PR campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/28/visit-north-england-david-cameron-easter-holidays-floods>
 to persuade British families to help the flood-hit areas put the winter’s 
devastation behind them by visiting during the Easter holidays. Our north of 
England editor points out some of the best places to take your tourist pounds.

Todmorden


Often overlooked in favour of its bohemian neighbour, Hebden Bridge, Todmorden 
in the Calder Valley is a lovely place to visit. My favourite spot is up on the 
moors at what may well be Britain’s highest inland beach.Gaddings Dam 
<http://www.gaddingsdam.org.uk/index.html> is a decommissioned reservoir 
perched up on the hillside, popular with triathletes in training and hardy 
locals alike. At some point a job lot of sand was dumped in the corner, 
creating what some wags have dubbed the Yorkshire Riviera. It’s a 15-minute 
scramble uphill to reach the dam and there’s a decent pub at the bottom, the 
Shepherd’s Rest.

Glenridding


This charming little village on the shores of Ullswater has been flooded four 
times in the past two months and deserves a break – and lots of visitors. 
You’ll cycle through it if you’re brave enough to tackle the fearsome Kirkstone 
Pass, and it’s a popular starting point for walkers climbing Helvellyn via 
Striding Edge. It’s the base for the Ullswater steamers too. There’s plenty to 
do: despite being badly affected by the floods, the Sailing Centre is reopening 
soon and is nowtaking bookings <http://www.glenriddingsailingcentre.co.uk/> and 
afternoon tea at the Inn on the Lake is a treat any time of year.

Whalley


This beautiful Lancashire village on the outskirts of the Trough of Bowland 
has much to recommend, including a really top-notch butty shop, CJs, which 
serves the most delicious little beef pies. Whalley’s most famous sight is 
Whalley Abbey, whose ruins date back to the 14th century, when it was a 
Cistercian abbey, but the village is also the meeting point for the North and 
South Lancashire Cycleways, two circular routes covering 260 miles of 
outstanding scenery. Not far away is Whitewell, home of the Inn at Whitewell, 
famed for its cooking and appearance in Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s The Trip.

Ramsbottom

The poshest town in Bury, Ramsbottom was flooded on Boxing Day when the river 
Irwell got over-excited and burst its banks. The best way to get there is via 
the East Lancashire Railway, a heritage line which recently welcomed back the 
revamped Flying Scotsman. Rammy is known for its gastronomy, with the Eagle and 
Child pub a particular favourite. Last year Jay Raynerraved about the Spanish 
cooking at Levanter

Lancaster


This attractive Georgian city was flooded in the first December floods, with 
tens of thousands of residents left without power for the best part of three 
days. There are many excellent pubs in Lancaster, including the canalside Water 
Witch, theTap House <https://twitter.com/taphouselancs> and the Sun Inn. Take a 
trip up to Williamson park, which has a butterfly house and some excellent 
playgrounds. Climb up the steps to the Ashton memorial, a 50-metre green 
dome-topped folly sometimes called Lancaster’s Taj Mahal – it was commissioned 
by a wealthy industrialist as a symbol of his love for his late wife. On a 
clear day you can not only get a cracking view of Morecambe but also right 
across the bay to the Lakeland hills.
