Route notes

A stunningly beautiful route that passes through two national parks and some 
of the most exhilarating scenery in the country.

Terrain and gradients

A mixture of traffic-free paths and minor roads – 42 miles is traffic-free, 
including the first 20 miles out of Glasgow. Be prepared for hill climbs; one 
section takes you over the Pass of Drumochter, at 460m the highest point on the 
national cycle network in Scotland.

How to get there/away

The route starts near the centre of Glasgow, and ends in the centre of 
Inverness. Both are well served by rail. You can reverse the route.

What to see

It would be hard to imagine a more beautiful UK long-distance ride. If two 
national parks – including Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, and the stunning 
Cairngorms – weren't enough, the route also takes you past six lochs, numerous 
castles and over the Glen Ogle viaduct.

Accommodation and watering holes

The two major cities on the route make finding places to stay at the beginning 
and end of the route straightforward. But even in the wilderness of the 
Highlands there are small towns and villages offering a wide range of places to 
stay. As some sections are quite remote, make sure to plan before you set off.

From Glasgow to Inverness, a popular overnight stop is Callander, around 50 
miles (80km) from the beginning of the route, offering all sorts of B&Bs, 
hotels, guesthouses, campsites and pubs.

Pitlochry is around 115 miles (185km) along the route and also offers many 
options, among themPitlochry Backpackers 
<http://www.pitlochrybackpackershotel.com>, with good facilities for cyclists 
and ample opportunity to share travelling stories with other riders.

Aviemore, after 175 miles (281km), is a hub for outdoor activities. Ardlogie 
Guest House <http://www.ardlogie.co.uk> here is a great pick, not least for the 
hearty breakfast.
