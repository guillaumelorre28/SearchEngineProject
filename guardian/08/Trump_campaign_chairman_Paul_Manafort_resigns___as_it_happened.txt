Bannon on GOP leadership: 'cunts'

In an internal email to a Breitbart reporter in 2014, site Svengali Steve 
Bannon, the newly minted Trump campaign CEO, called the Republican 
congressional leadership “cunts,” the Daily Beastreveals 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/19/donald-trump-s-new-chief-steve-bannon-called-republican-leaders-c-ts.html>
:

“Leadership are all cunts,” he wrote. “We should just go buck wild.”

Then he wrote, “Let the grassroots turn on the hate because that’s the ONLY 
thing that will make them do their duty.”

Doesn’t seem off-brand for Trump at all.

Obama to visit Louisiana

Barack Obama will visit the flooding in Louisiana that Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> just saw on Tuesday, the 
White House has announced.

In a statement, the White House said that homeland security director Jeh 
Johnson had visited the area and briefed the president, and that officials had 
been working to determine “an appropriate time” for a presidential visit.

Here’s part of the statement: 


The President today directed his team to coordinate with Louisiana officials 
to determine an appropriate time for him to visit, and together they have 
determined that the President will visit Baton Rouge, Louisiana on Tuesday, 
August 23rd. Additional details will be announced in the coming days. The 
President is mindful of the impact that his travel has on first responders and 
wants to ensure that his presence does not interfere with ongoing recovery 
efforts. He is also eager to get a first-hand look at the impact of the 
devastating floods, hear from more officials about the response, including how 
the federal government can assist and tell the people ofLouisiana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana> that the American people will 
be with them as they rebuild their community and come back stronger than ever.

It’s not happy hour yet – is it? – but if you’re in Midtown, only 90 minutes 
remain until Trump Bar in the eponymous tower will start serving $5 draughts. 
What’s the scene like? Would you believe mildly paranoiac?

Joshua David Stein dropped in for a visit earlier this week for the Guardian:


On Wednesday, after news of yet another campaign shakeup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway>
, I wondered if his supporters had started to see the beginning of the end. So 
I headed to Trump Bar, a rare refuge of Trumpism in liberal Manhattan, to find 
out if they were drowning their sorrows. [...]

I asked Andy about the bad news surrounding his candidate this week, but 
before Andy could respond, his friend appeared. “Look man,” he told me, “I’m 
just trying to show him a good time. We’re not here to talk. Tell him ‘no 
comment’.” “No comment,” said Andy. Trump supporters appeared to follow the 
same media strategy as their candidate: don’t answer questions you don’t like –
shut them out

Trump in Louisiana: 'just here to help'

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> struck a somber 
tone as he toured the flood damage in Louisiana — but still managed to get in a 
jab at President Barack Obama, reports the Associated Press:

In brief remarks in Ascension Parish, Trump made an appeal for more aid to the 
area and said he was “just here to help.”

Trump was also there to strike a contrast to Obama, who is on vacation and has 
not visited the area.

When a woman told Trump she was happy he wasn’t off playing golf, Trump 
replied: “Somebody is, somebody is that shouldn’t be.”

Trump later added that “nobody understands how bad it is.”

The White House has said Obama has received regular updates about the flooding 
and the federal response during his vacation.

He is due back in Washington on Sunday.

What I learned by reading only Breitbart

Adam Gabbatt

The Guardian’s Adam Gabbatt, claiming not to have been previously a regular 
Breitbart reader, immersed himself in the site for two days to see what all the 
fuss is about. Here’s part of his report:

To gain clarity following yet another Trump campaign shakeup, I read Breitbart 
exclusively for two days, eschewing all other news sources. (The Guardian 
included. Apart from its soccer coverage.)

It offered an insight into not just the popularity of Breitbart – the site 
boasted31 million unique visitors 
<http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/08/07/blow-breitbart-news-sets-traffic-records-july-192-million-pageviews-31-million-uniques-89-million-visits/>
 in July – but also how it appeals to its readers. And it’s not as 
straightforward as you might imagine.

The first thing you notice when visiting Breitbart is its idiosyncratic 
presentation. Every headline is in capitals. It implies a sense of significance 
and dire urgency.

It screams at you. “THIS IS IMPORTANT,” is the effect. “THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.” 
“THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS COUNTRY GOING TO HELL IN A HANDCART.”

The last of those points is an example of how well Breitbart knows its 
audience.

This doomsday approach makes it seem like Breitbart readers want to feel that 
everything is rotten. They want to feel irate. They want to feel that disaster 
is impending – unless their guys can fix it.

Former Romney finance chair backs Clinton

Sabrina Siddiqui

Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Mitt Romney’s former finance chair 
on Friday, marking the latest defection among Republicans from nomineeDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, writes Guardian 
politics reporter Sabrina Siddiqui:

David Nierenberg, who led Romney’s finance efforts during the 2012 election, 
said he was convinced Trump’s “character, temperament, and behavior” was 
disqualifying for any individual seeking the highest office in the nation.

“Trump is the most dangerous major party presidential candidate in my 
lifetime, maybe in American history,” Nierenberg wrote inan op-ed 
<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/19/ive-been-a-republican-since-1980-but-im-voting-for-hillary-clinton-commentary.html>
 for CNBC.com.

“I don’t think he’s fit to be our president. He speaks positively about 
foreign dictators and acts like one himself.”

Earlier this month, Meg Whitman, another former Romney finance chair, also 
threw her support behind Clinton.

Romney has himself ranked among Trump’s most vociferous critics and delivered 
a high-profile speech against the real estate mogul in March, despite 
celebrating his endorsement while running for president in 2012. The former 
Massachusetts governor has said he will vote for neither Trump nor Clinton in 
November.

Nierenberg said he would cast his vote for Republicans down the ballot, but 
felt compelled to support Clinton for the presidency – praising her as “a 
steady hand on the tiller.”

“We cannot afford the risk of a man whose temperament and behavior are 
erratic,” he added of Trump.

Clinton camp accuses Trump of 'bromance' with Putin

Paul Manafort’s ties to “pro-Kremlin elements” are “just the beginning of 
Donald Trump’s “odd bromance” with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Trump 
campaign manager Robby Mook says in a statement.

The Clinton camp has produced a video to illustrate what it depicts as 
parallel messaging by Trump and Putin.

Here’s the statement, which also calls on Trump to “come clean on his own 
business dealings with Russian interests”:

Paul Manafort’s resignation is a clear admission that the disturbing 
connections between Donald Trump’s team and pro-Kremlin elements in Russia and 
Ukraine are untenable. But this is not the end of the story. It’s just the 
beginning. You can get rid of Manafort, but that doesn’t end the odd bromance 
Trump has with Putin. Trump still has to answer serious questions hovering over 
his campaign given his propensity to parrot Putin’s talking points, the roster 
of advisers like Carter Page and Mike Flynn with deep ties to Russia, the 
recent Russian government hacking and disclosure of Democratic Party records, 
and reports that Breitbart published articles advocating pro-Kremlin positions 
on Ukraine. It’s also time forDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to come clean on his own 
business dealings with Russian interests, given recent news reports about his 
web of deep financial connections to business groups with Kremlin ties.”

Here’s the video, “Why do Trump and Putin sound so much alike?”:

Clinton: Louisiana 'can't afford any distractions'

Here’s Hillary Clinton’s play against Trump’s Louisiana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana> trip today.

Clinton has posted a message on Facebook saying that she has just spoken with 
the state governor and advising that the “relief effort can’t afford any 
distractions.” The statement echoes messaging fromthe governor

 himself yesterday, discouraging the president from visiting and warning Trump 
against a mere “photo-op” drop-in.

We’re going to wrap up our live blog politics coverage for the day. Thanks for 
a great week.

 for today’s Campaign Minute summary – and see you back here soon!
 
In an internal email to a Breitbart reporter in 2014, site Svengali Steve 
Bannon, the newly minted Trump campaign CEO, called the Republican 
congressional leadership “cunts,” the Daily Beastreveals 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/19/donald-trump-s-new-chief-steve-bannon-called-republican-leaders-c-ts.html>
:

“Leadership are all cunts,” he wrote. “We should just go buck wild.”

Then he wrote, “Let the grassroots turn on the hate because that’s the ONLY 
thing that will make them do their duty.”

Doesn’t seem off-brand for Trump at all. 
 
Barack Obama will visit the flooding in Louisiana that Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> just saw on Tuesday, the 
White House has announced.

In a statement, the White House said that homeland security director Jeh 
Johnson had visited the area and briefed the president, and that officials had 
been working to determine “an appropriate time” for a presidential visit.

Here’s part of the statement: 


The President today directed his team to coordinate with Louisiana officials 
to determine an appropriate time for him to visit, and together they have 
determined that the President will visit Baton Rouge, Louisiana on Tuesday, 
August 23rd. Additional details will be announced in the coming days. The 
President is mindful of the impact that his travel has on first responders and 
wants to ensure that his presence does not interfere with ongoing recovery 
efforts. He is also eager to get a first-hand look at the impact of the 
devastating floods, hear from more officials about the response, including how 
the federal government can assist and tell the people ofLouisiana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana> that the American people will 
be with them as they rebuild their community and come back stronger than ever.

The poll was conducted over August 14-18:

Clinton also led a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that asked people to choose 
between Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of 
the Green Party. Some 41 percent supported Clinton and 34 percent supported 
Trump. Among alternative-party candidates, Johnson came in third with 7 percent 
and about 2 percent supported Stein.

What’s the scene like? Would you believe mildly paranoiac?

Joshua David Stein dropped in for a visit earlier this week for the Guardian:


On Wednesday, after news of yet another campaign shakeup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway>
, I wondered if his supporters had started to see the beginning of the end. So 
I headed to Trump Bar, a rare refuge of Trumpism in liberal Manhattan, to find 
out if they were drowning their sorrows. [...]

I asked Andy about the bad news surrounding his candidate this week, but 
before Andy could respond, his friend appeared. “Look man,” he told me, “I’m 
just trying to show him a good time. We’re not here to talk. Tell him ‘no 
comment’.” “No comment,” said Andy. Trump supporters appeared to follow the 
same media strategy as their candidate: don’t answer questions you don’t like –
shut them out

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> struck a somber 
tone as he toured the flood damage in Louisiana — but still managed to get in a 
jab at President Barack Obama, reports the Associated Press:

In brief remarks in Ascension Parish, Trump made an appeal for more aid to the 
area and said he was “just here to help.”

Trump was also there to strike a contrast to Obama, who is on vacation and has 
not visited the area.

When a woman told Trump she was happy he wasn’t off playing golf, Trump 
replied: “Somebody is, somebody is that shouldn’t be.”

Trump later added that “nobody understands how bad it is.”

The White House has said Obama has received regular updates about the flooding 
and the federal response during his vacation.

He is due back in Washington on Sunday.

The Guardian’s Adam Gabbatt, claiming not to have been previously a regular 
Breitbart reader, immersed himself in the site for two days to see what all the 
fuss is about. Here’s part of his report:

To gain clarity following yet another Trump campaign shakeup, I read Breitbart 
exclusively for two days, eschewing all other news sources. (The Guardian 
included. Apart from its soccer coverage.)

It offered an insight into not just the popularity of Breitbart – the site 
boasted31 million unique visitors 
<http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/08/07/blow-breitbart-news-sets-traffic-records-july-192-million-pageviews-31-million-uniques-89-million-visits/>
 in July – but also how it appeals to its readers. And it’s not as 
straightforward as you might imagine.

The first thing you notice when visiting Breitbart is its idiosyncratic 
presentation. Every headline is in capitals. It implies a sense of significance 
and dire urgency.

It screams at you. “THIS IS IMPORTANT,” is the effect. “THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.” 
“THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS COUNTRY GOING TO HELL IN A HANDCART.”

The last of those points is an example of how well Breitbart knows its 
audience.

This doomsday approach makes it seem like Breitbart readers want to feel that 
everything is rotten. They want to feel irate. They want to feel that disaster 
is impending – unless their guys can fix it.

Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Mitt Romney’s former finance chair 
on Friday, marking the latest defection among Republicans from nomineeDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, writes Guardian 
politics reporter Sabrina Siddiqui:

David Nierenberg, who led Romney’s finance efforts during the 2012 election, 
said he was convinced Trump’s “character, temperament, and behavior” was 
disqualifying for any individual seeking the highest office in the nation.

“Trump is the most dangerous major party presidential candidate in my 
lifetime, maybe in American history,” Nierenberg wrote inan op-ed 
<http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/19/ive-been-a-republican-since-1980-but-im-voting-for-hillary-clinton-commentary.html>
 for CNBC.com.

“I don’t think he’s fit to be our president. He speaks positively about 
foreign dictators and acts like one himself.”

looks on, Thursday, 6 December, 2007. Photograph: LM Otero/AP 
Earlier this month, Meg Whitman, another former Romney finance chair, also 
threw her support behind Clinton.

Romney has himself ranked among Trump’s most vociferous critics and delivered 
a high-profile speech against the real estate mogul in March, despite 
celebrating his endorsement while running for president in 2012. The former 
Massachusetts governor has said he will vote for neither Trump nor Clinton in 
November.

Nierenberg said he would cast his vote for Republicans down the ballot, but 
felt compelled to support Clinton for the presidency – praising her as “a 
steady hand on the tiller.”

“We cannot afford the risk of a man whose temperament and behavior are 
erratic,” he added of Trump.
 
Paul Manafort’s ties to “pro-Kremlin elements” are “just the beginning of 
Donald Trump’s “odd bromance” with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Trump 
campaign manager Robby Mook says in a statement.

The Clinton camp has produced a video to illustrate what it depicts as 
parallel messaging by Trump and Putin.

Here’s the statement, which also calls on Trump to “come clean on his own 
business dealings with Russian interests”:

Paul Manafort’s resignation is a clear admission that the disturbing 
connections between Donald Trump’s team and pro-Kremlin elements in Russia and 
Ukraine are untenable. But this is not the end of the story. It’s just the 
beginning. You can get rid of Manafort, but that doesn’t end the odd bromance 
Trump has with Putin. Trump still has to answer serious questions hovering over 
his campaign given his propensity to parrot Putin’s talking points, the roster 
of advisers like Carter Page and Mike Flynn with deep ties to Russia, the 
recent Russian government hacking and disclosure of Democratic Party records, 
and reports that Breitbart published articles advocating pro-Kremlin positions 
on Ukraine. It’s also time forDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to come clean on his own 
business dealings with Russian interests, given recent news reports about his 
web of deep financial connections to business groups with Kremlin ties.”

Here’s the video, “Why do Trump and Putin sound so much alike?”:
