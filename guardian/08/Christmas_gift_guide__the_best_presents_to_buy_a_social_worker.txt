Desk organiser

For those social workers lucky enough to have their own desk, any type of 
storage or organiser would not go amiss this Christmas. Shops like Ikea and 
John Lewis have a range of basic desk tidies, but more creative options can be 
found on sites such as Etsy, like thesewooden blocks

(Personalised) posh stationery

Treat the social worker in your life to a more glamorous notebook for all 
their appointments, reminders and thoughts in 2017. There are thousands to 
choose from, but if you head over to sites such asPapier 
<https://www.papier.com/stationery/notebooks>, Ohhdeer 
<http://ohhdeer.com/stationery> or Chroma 
<http://www.chromastationery.co.uk/shop> you’ll find a range of beautiful, 
ornate stationery, some of which can be personalised.


Clare in the Community calendar

And to help your special social worker organise their time – as well as their 
desk – next year, how about thisClare in the Community calendar 
<http://www.clareinthecommunity.co.uk/index.php>? Cartoonist Harry Venning, 
whoseweekly cartoon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/series/clareinthecommunity> is a 
SocietyGuardian staple, has put together 12 humorous illustrations that will 
hopefully cheer up anyone on the more trying days.

Tea subscription ...

We’ve recommended this before, but it’s still true that social workers love a 
good cuppa. This year, how about going gourmet with the tea selection? Sign up 
your special social worker to a tea subscription, such asBruu tea 
<http://www.bruutea.co.uk/>, Blue Bird Tea Co. 
<http://bluebirdteaco.com/uk_en/shop/tea-gifts/tea-subscription.html> and 
Eteaket <http://www.eteaket.co.uk/>, that can be delivered to their desk (or 
the one they use the most) on a monthly basis.

... and a new mug

Don’t forget to give them something to drink all that tea from. There are so 
many social worker-themed mugs out there, but this one –I’m a social worker, 
what’s your superpower? 
<https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/226427805/im-a-social-worker-mug-hand-lettered?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=social%20worker&ref=sr_gallery_12>
 – is a particular favourite. We also love thesecolourful loose-leaf teapots 
<https://www.whittard.co.uk/_all?searchterm=stump#b>, perfect for all the fancy 
tea you’ll be drinking.

Cake, cake, cake

And for something to munch on while you’re at it, it has to be cake. Why not 
buy a baking cookbook or two, or sign up for a day of baking classes? If you’re 
in London,Bread Ahead <http://www.boroughmarket.org.uk/traders/bread-ahead> or 
Konditor & Cook <http://www.konditorandcook.com/> are highly-rated, but there 
are schools dotted all around the country.

Afternoon tea

In fact, why not combine the two and book an upmarket afternoon tea for your 
beloved social worker? For all the posh cake and tea he or she could ever want,
Bettys <https://www.bettys.co.uk/> is an absolute classic.

Chill pills


We love the idea of administering “chill pills

” in times of great stress. Sadly, this jar does not actually come with any 
sweets, but it does give some inspiration for a lovely homemade gift; save a 
leftover jam jar, sneak a sticker from the stationery cupboard and fill with 
their favourite pick ’n’ mix.

Lunchbox

For those on a budget (especially after any Christmas extravagances), taking 
in your own lunch is a surefire way to save money. But leave the grimy 
Tupperware at home and take in your sandwiches and fruit in any one ofthese 
colourful lunch bags or boxes

Really long books

How about some long books to while away all the hours spent in transit? If 
they’ve already read War and Peace, Infinite Jest and Don Quixote, you could 
always turn to the appropriately-titled In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust 
– at 4,215 pages it’s sure to get your social care worker through a number of 
tortuous journeys. All these big books might get a bit heavy though, so aKindle 
<http://www.johnlewis.com/browse/electricals/ereaders/kindle-ereaders/_/N-5aie?rdr=1&s_kwcid=1dx43700012692260950&tmad=c&tmcampid=1&gclid=COHrv4PS7tACFeqT7QodnzMF2A&gclsrc=aw.ds>
 or other e-reader might be in order, or an audiobook subscription (browse the 
year’s best buys 
<http://www.toptenreviews.com/services/entertainment/best-audiobook-services/>).

Power bank

All social workers could do without the onset of panic when their phone starts 
to run out of battery in the middle of a day full of meetings and appointments. 
Beat any low-battery anxiety with a power bank. TheZendure A2

Artwork

We’re sure not many social workers will want a constant reminder of their work 
at home, but some cheery and motivational artwork would be welcomed in any drab 
council building. We like thisprint 
<https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/287309891/a-truly-great-social-worker-art-print?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=social%20worker&amp;ref=sc_gallery_2&amp;plkey=b0c67d321a646eb229a67a5f9af62279e2692131:287309891>
. Amagnetic lightbox 
<http://www.notonthehighstreet.com/lisaangeljewellery/product/a6-magnetic-light-box-with-letters-and-emojis>
 would also serve well to spread cheery and motivational messages around the 
office.

A donation

We know that social workers can’t be everywhere all the time, so why not make 
a donation in their name to a charity – such asMind 
<http://www.mind.org.uk/?gclid=CMyP1-fK7tACFcK87Qodrz0CjA> or the Samaritans 
<http://www.samaritans.org/> – that will support vulnerable people when they 
can’t.
