Logistics can be tricky for any such large event, so if you’re planning to 
attend, here are some suggestions for what to bring and what you need to know:


What to bring

Posters or flags: both will be allowed, but flags cannot have poles and 
posters cannot have wooden sign posts, according tothe march FAQ 
<https://www.womensmarch.com/faq/>. If you’re making your own sign, guides like 
this one from i-D 
<https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-taking-part-in-the-womens-march-on-washington>
 recommend using foam core instead of poster board. The Amplifier Foundation 
has chosena selection of five posters 
<http://theamplifierfoundation.org/experiments/womens-march/> that you can 
print and bring with you. A number will be distributed for free.


A small bag or clear backpack: be warned, there are size restrictions and bags 
may be subject to search. Transparent backpacks can be no larger than 17in by 
12in by 6in, and small bags, purses or totes cannot exceed 8in by 6in by 4in.


Food: every participant is allowed to have one 12in by 12in by 6in plastic or 
gallon bag for meals. The FAQ also mentions food trucks, and DC of course has 
plenty of restaurants.


Your phone: for all your photography needs, live tweeting and, most 
importantly, keeping in contact with those with whom you travelled. A portable 
battery charger may not be a bad idea either.


A breast pump, if you need it: there are plans for lactation areas, though 
more information will be updated later on, the FAQ reads.


Other necessities: wallet, water, tissues, medications, bandages, sunscreen, 
snacks, hand sanitizer, sunglasses, hand warmers, a camera, and anything else 
you may need for a day outside.


Other people: the march “is for any person, regardless of gender or gender 
identity, who believes women’s rights are human rights”, according to the 
official website, which notes that “the decision to bring your children is a 
personal one”. The site also has information on accessibility for those with 
disabilities.


What not to bring

The FAQ says not to bring “anything that can be construed” – by law 
enforcement – “as a weapon”. The DC government has alsocompiled a list of 
security restrictions for public events during inauguration week 
<http://inauguration.dc.gov/page/know-you-go>.

What to wear

Warm clothing or layers: DC can get cold in the winter, so you’ll want to 
bring a hat, gloves or mittens, scarves and a coat. TheWashington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/01/13/trumps-inauguration-could-be-the-warmest-on-record-but-it-also-might-rain/?utm_term=.93b10e51d905>
 reports however that Saturday could be warmer than usual for the time of the 
year, with rain a possibility.

Comfortable shoes: you’ll probably be doing a lot of standing or walking, plus 
you’ll want warm, dry feet no matter the weather. The March begins at 10am and 
while details of the route have not yet been publicized, it could last until 
5pm, according to theNew York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/10/us/politics/womens-march-guide.html>
.


Clothing with pockets: with limitations on bag sizes, it may be easier to stow 
necessities in jacket or pant pockets.


Coordinated clothing: organizers haven’t specified a color to wear to unify 
the group, but you’re welcome to plan something with your group.


A pink Pussyhat: the Pussyhat Project <https://www.pussyhatproject.com/> hopes 
to outfit marchers with handmade, cat-eared hats in all shades of pink to 
create a “unique collective visual statement”, according to their site.

How to stay safe

Know the city: Monica Hopkins-Maxwell, executive director of the American 
Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia, emphasized that attendees 
should make a plan ahead of time when going to any demonstration. That includes 
having meeting points in case you get disconnected from your group and 
understanding the basic layout of the city.

A website established by local DC government advises on street closures and 
getting around <http://inauguration.dc.gov/page/getting-around-city> during the 
chaos of inauguration weekend.

Know what safety means to you: Hopkins-Maxwell recommends knowing what feels 
safe to you. “Safety is along a spectrum, right?” she asks. “What are you 
willing to engage in? What are you not willing to engage in?”

Know your rights: The ACLU will pass out pamphlets about knowing your rights 
when demonstrating in DC 
<https://www.acludc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/aclu_8.5_x_11_trifold_v21.pdf>
, compiled withBlack Lives Matter DC <http://www.blacklivesmatterdmv.org/>, 
Law4BlackLives-DC <http://www.law4blacklivesdc.com/> and a number of other 
groups. Hopkins-Maxwell highlighted a few tips for interacting with police 
officers, including memorizing their badge numbers, which should be in plain 
view, specifying that you would like to remain silent, and knowing that you can 
ask if you are free to leave.

Know when not to engage: Should counter-protests occur, Hopkins-Maxwell 
recommended not engaging. If you are concerned about surveillance, she 
recommended using FaceTime or an app like Signal for communication, or using a 
temporary phone.

Though such precautions are an important step, Hopkins-Maxwell said she was 
not expecting any incidents. “In safety planning, you arm yourself with 
knowledge in case you need to use it and hope you don’t have to,” she said.

The website for the Women’s March said organizers are not expecting any 
arrests. The protest is permitted and city agencies have been involved in 
planning. A private security firm has been hired, trained marshals will be 
there to help and there will be legal observers too.
