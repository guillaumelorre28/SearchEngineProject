“Go Trump!” “Lock her up! Lock her up!” The chants could be heard echoing down 
East 56th Street in the heart of Manhattan just across the street from the 
polling place whereDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, reality TV star turned 
political insurgent, had just cast his vote.

Globalisation backlash enters new phase with Trump win

Even in Manhattan, the moneyed bastion of liberal America, the war of words 
unleashed by Trump and his supporters was unavoidable as election day finally 
arrived in the United States. It was to be a suitable portent of the 
agonizingly tense night of results that was to come.

The demand that Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> should be put not into 
the White House but into penal custody was coming from a small group of 
hard-hatted construction workers. They were gathered, in a microcosm of the 
2016 presidential race, over the road and across the class divide from a 
counter group of anti-Trump protesters.

Among the builders was Mike Mastriano, 41, a plumber from Long Island. “I’m 
proud to be an American and I can finally vote for a Republican I can believe 
in,” he said.

“I’m a union construction worker and the illegal immigration is destroying the 
union construction trade in New York. My wife is Dominican and she’s voting for 
Trump. The whole family is. They don’t want to be lumped in with illegal 
immigrants.”

As Mastriano spoke, a passerby said: “I agree with everything he says and I’m 
a woman!”

At the end of a presidential campaign that has tested the stamina not only of 
the two main candidates but also of the American people, election day drew to a 
close with nerves jangling on both sides of the electoral divide. From the 
start of the night, when the results began coming in, liberals and 
conservatives, the progressive coasts and the traditional heartlands alike were 
left writhing from the exquisite pain of prolonged uncertainty.

Only one thing was sure:the most important political decision that America had 
made in living memory would not reveal itself quickly to a nation on 
tenterhooks.

The results roll in

The first projections were called by Associated Press soon after 7pm on the 
east coast, leading to faux gasps of excitement in television newsrooms across 
Midtown Manhattan. Vermont had gone to Clinton, Kentucky to Trump, to the 
surprise of no one. Vermont has voted solidly Democratic in every presidential 
election since 1988 and Kentucky similarly Republican since 1996.

No surprises continued at 7.30pm when West Virginia was called for Trump – 
only to be expected given the Republican candidate’s promise to put coalminers 
back to work amid the ravages of the mining industry. After 8pm Clinton locked 
down the eastern liberal states of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, 
Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and in a quick seesaw movement Trump then 
immediately replied by locking up at 9pm the Republican states of the south and 
midwest, painting a straight red line up the geographic center of the country 
from Texas to North Dakota.

But while early state projections went entirely according to pattern, as the 
evening progressed it became clear that predictions of a nail-bitingly close 
night had come to pass. By 9.30pm the seven most important swing states were 
still too close to call, including four especially crucial states: Florida, 
Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

Even Virginia and Georgia, previously considered comfortable wins for Clinton 
and Trump respectively, were trapped in the uncertain camp. The fog had only 
thickened with the addition of Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and Utah to the list 
of too close to call.

Then at 10.20pm a double shock was delivered to the nation. The first was 
Ohio, a quintessential swing state that finally swung for Trump. To add to the 
gathering storm swirling around Democratic heads, Ohio has voted with the 
eventual presidential winner in every cycle since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.

But then quickly, before American liberals could slide too far into 
depression, Virginia was called for Clinton. The home of Clinton’s running mate 
Tim Kaine, it is also a microcosm of the demographic changes in the country 
that theDemocrats <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> have 
increasingly depended upon in forging a pathway to the White House, with a 
booming left-leaning tech corridor in northern Virginia.

Trump pulls ahead 

For hours, Florida continued to tantalize the nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/florida-us-election-2016-trump-clinton-tied-polls>
, with all eyes turned in particular to the Democratic stronghold of Broward 
County, where Clinton was needing to draw strong support if she was to make up 
a state-wide deficit to her Republican rival of some 140,000 votes. But it 
wasn’t to be enough; the AP called Florida for Trump just before 11pm.

By then, it was clear that the Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> were having a successful 
night, even while Clinton shored up her tally with the west coast states, 
including California’s 55 electoral votes.

Earlier in the day, a succession of problems had been reported over access to 
the polls. In North Carolina, one of the most hotly contested states in the 
nation, Democratic organizers managed to persuade judges to order the local 
authorities to keep polling stations open longer than expected in Durham County 
following mechanical faults in voting machines throughout the area earlier in 
the day.

How the 2016 US election night unfolded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/09/how-the-2016-us-election-night-unfolded-trump-clinton-video>
Durham County leans heavily Democratic and was seen as a crucial target for 
Clinton within a crucial swing state, but North Carolina, too, went to Trump 
just after 11pm.



There had also been reports of intimidation outside the polls in Arizona, 
Florida, Georgia and Ohio. In Florida, a group of people of unspecified 
political affiliation were said to have been menacing would-be voters outside a 
polling place in Broward County. Some voters actually turned back before 
participating in the race.

Among the voters in Floridawas Eddie Cruz, a 39-year-old law enforcement 
officer, who brought his daughter Grace, eight, to the polls in Coral Springs 
on her day off from school “as an education”.

“Her and I will be having a conversation after,” said Cruz, who wouldn’t 
reveal who he voted for but said it was “for the lesser of two evils” after 
fact-checking the candidates.

Early voting returns released by election officials on Monday showed that 
about half of the state’s eligible voters, 6.42 million of a 12.86m registered 
electorate, had already cast a ballot, and that 976,000 of them were from 
generally Democratic-leaning Latino voters, about a third of whom had never 
voted before, according to analysis by University of Florida political science 
professor Dan Smith.

Vivian Rodriguez, president of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Florida, 
said: “The Florida Hispanic vote is going to make history in the 2016 election 
cycle, not only by sending the first woman president to the White House, but 
also for many other candidates … Trump is the reason Latinos are coming out to 
vote.”

Clinton’s path looks bleak

But by 11pm EST it was clear that the Democrats were having a very bad night 
indeed, as the Republicans not only kept the House but held on to Senate seats 
against all polling predictions – with the exception of Nevada – drastically 
narrowing any path the Democrats had to recapture the upper house of Congress.

At 11.15, Trump had reached 222 electoral college votes – 16 more than Mitt 
Romney’s 2012 total against Barack Obama. As the vote tightened, three states 
emerged as key fulcrums on which the election teetered: Michigan, Pennsylvania, 
and Wisconsin.

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/my-year-with-donald-trump-campaign-2016-election>
In Michigan, a slim Trump lead dwindled to just 20,000 votes by 11.30pm. In 
Pennsylvania, the margin was even tighter, with both candidates briefly taking 
and losing the lead, separated at one point by just 2,000 votes. Clinton 
supporters began to be despondent. Some began leaving her New York victory 
party in tears.

Markets began to drop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/09/financial-markets-set-for-record-falls-after-asian-shares-battered-by-trump-surge>
. The Standard & Poor’s futures dropped 121 points in three and a half hours. 
The Mexican peso dropped 4% against the dollar. Japan’s Nikkei dropped more 
than 1,000 points. The Dow Jones futures market dropped 850 points, further 
than it did after 9/11. Canada’s immigration servicewebsite crashed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/canadas-immigration-website-crashes-as-donald-trumps-us-election-lead-grows>
 under the weight of traffic.

Clinton’s path to victory got narrower and narrower. By midnight, there was 
only one way for the former secretary of state to stop Trump: win Pennsylvania, 
Nevada, Wisconsin and Michigan.

A brief ray of hope came at 12.20pm when Clinton won the swing state of 
Nevada. Still lagging in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, she took the lead in New 
Hampshire by just 18 votes. But Trump edged inexorably towards victory.

As the result seem inevitable, the crowd at the Trump victory party grew 
rowdier. “Make American Great Again” hats appeared on everyone’s head as 
impatient chants of “Call It, Call It” interspersed with people chanting “na na 
na na, na, na, na, na, hey hey goodbye”.

A new chapter begins

Around 2am the writing was on the wall. Clinton’s campaign chair, John 
Podesta, arrived alone at the Clinton election-night party at New York’s Javits 
Center to tell the audience to go home.

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/nov/09/president-victory-speech-annotated>
“We can wait a little longer, can’t we,” Podesta said. “We’re not going to 
have anything more to say tonight.”

Just a few minutes later, the AP called the race for Donald Trump. Soon after, 
Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump to concede the race.

Back at the Trump party, when the televisions, tuned to Fox News, finally 
announced the results the room erupted in cheers. After holding in their 
excitement impatiently for hours, it all came pouring out. Men hugged each 
other, couples embraced, and Pax Dickinson, an ardent high-profile Trump 
supporter with a history of sexism, triumphantly flipped off reporters.

Just before 3am, introduced by his new vice president-elect, Mike Pence, Trump 
took the stage at the ballroom party at the Hilton hotel. “Hillary has worked 
long and hard, and we owe her a debt of gratitude,” Trump began, opening a 
speech that was surprisingly magnanimous by his standards. “Now it is time for 
America to heal the wounds of division.”

He pledged “to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all 
Americans.”

“For those who have chosen not to support me in the past,” the man who just 
became the 45th president of the United States said, “I’m reaching out to you 
for your help so we can unify our great country.”

Trump thanked his loyal campaign surrogates, singling out former New York 
mayor Rudy Giuliani for particular praise, and also thanked the Secret Service. 
“We’re going to do a job where hopefully you are going to be so proud of your 
president,” he said. “I love this country. Thank you.”

As he left the stage the Rolling Stones’ song You Can’t Always Get What You 
Want blared loudly throughout the room. A new chapter in American politics had 
begun.
