Five of the six artists competing for the 2016 Jarman award for moving image 
art <http://flamin.filmlondon.org.uk/jarmanaward>are women, exploring subjects 
as diverse as Alzheimer’s disease and Arab pop culture.

Sophia Al Maria, Cécile B Evans, Shona Illingworth, Rachel Maclean and Heather 
Phillipson have been shortlisted alongside Mikhail Karikis for the £10,000 art 
prize, which is named after English film-makerDerek Jarman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/derek-jarman>, who died in 1994.

Now in its ninth year, the award honours UK artists working with film, video 
and moving image in all its forms and keeping Jarman’s “spirit of 
experimentation, imagination and innovation” alive. The work of this year’s 
nominees spans short films, animations, YouTube collages and multi-screen 
installations.

Al Maria’s work explores the complexity and contradiction of modern life in 
the Middle East. In wildly different ways, Evans and Illingworth investigate 
ideas of human emotion and memory. Maclean is a creative scavenger of found 
sound for the screen. Karikis, whose work currently features in theWhitstable 
Bienniale <http://www.whitstablebiennale.com/project/aint-got-no-fear/>, uses 
the voice as a sculpture material, while Phillipson houses her video art in 
giant feet and dogs that she makes herself.

The shortlist “represents a riotous explosion of colour, sound, skill and 
distinctive imagery, but beyond the visuals are also some very serious, 
thought-provoking messages,” said Adrian Wootton, Film London chief executive. 
“As well as serving to shock, startle and entertain, great art has the power to 
cut to the very heart of contemporary culture.”

The Jarman prize jury has a reputation for talent-spotting: former 
shortlistees Elizabeth Price, Laure Prouvost and Duncan Campbell went on to win 
the Turner art prize. This year’s winner will be announced on 28 November at 
the Whitechapel Gallery, whose director Iwona Blazwick is one of the six judges.

As well as the £10,000 prize money, all six shortlisted artists will be 
commissioned to produce new work for Channel 4’s short film seriesRandom Acts 
<http://randomacts.channel4.com/> and their art will tour 11 galleries around 
the UK. Whatever the result of the main award, a woman is guaranteed to win the 
Jules Wright prize. Named afterthe late theatre director 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/26/jules-wright> and founder of the 
Wapping Project, it honours the achievement of a female creative technician, 
this year in the field of film editing.
