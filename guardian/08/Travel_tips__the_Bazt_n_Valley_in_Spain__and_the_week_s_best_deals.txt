Take me there

Why go? In the foothills of the Spanish Pyrenees, just north of Pamplona, this 
valley is a stronghold for Basque culture and cuisine. Forget the over-priced 
Michelin-starred restaurants of San Sebastian and the Basque coastline, here 
you can dine on top-class Navarrese cuisine in rustic inns for less than €25 a 
head. The valley is at its most beautiful in the autumn when the forests turn 
golden and the handsome stone-built villages celebrate the harvest with fiestas 
dating back to pagan times.

What to do Sections of the Camino de Santiago 
<http://www.santiago-compostela.net/> pilgrim’s way cut through the Baztán 
Valley and there are dozens of shorter routes to explore, including the old 
smuggler’s path that links the caves at Urdax, Sara and Zugarramurdi (once a 
site for witchcraft), and the hike up to the waterfall at Xorroxin. Look out 
for fiestas, such as the mushroom festival of Elgorriaga (first Sunday of 
October), and the ancient Joaldunak carnival where the villagers of Zubieta and 
Ituren parade through the streets in sheepskins, pointy hats and cowbells (end 
of January). Take a day trip to Pamplona, where Hemingway watched the running 
of the bulls, or the genteel seaside resort of San Sebastian, both of which are 
less than an hour’s drive away.

Where to eat Baztán is famous for its walnuts, figs, mushrooms and cheese, all 
of which can be found on the menu at Donamaria’ko Benta, a riverside 
restaurant-with-rooms (donamariako.com <http://www.donamariako.com/>).

Where to stay You can sign up for guided walks, Spanish lessons and 
gastronomic visits at Georgina Howard’s mountainside farmhouse (ensuite B&B 
with kitchen access from €80 per night, half-board house-party weeks from £725,
pyreneanexperience.com <http://www.pyreneanexperience.com/>).

Insider tip “The Molino de Amaiur is a watermill where you can watch corn 
being ground to make talos, the local version of tortillas,” says Georgina 
Howard. “Try them with chistorra [spicy sausage] and cheese, washed down with 
dry cider” (amaiurkoerrota.com <http://amaiurkoerrota.com/>).
