As America gears up for another presidential election, the field is so crowded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/03/lincoln-chafee-campaign-resume-guardian>
 that the key question is not who’s running, but who isn’t?


So far 15 Republicans <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> are 
seeking the nomination, with five Democrats aiming to succeed Barack Obama.

Democrats – declared

Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/apr/12/hillary-clintons-campaign-resume-as-seen-by-the-guardian>

Odds of winning party nomination: 1/6
Age: 67

 * The undisputed Democratic frontrunner lost the 2008 nomination to Obama but 
this time is streets ahead of all her party rivals. 
 * To appease skeptics on the left, she has taken progressive stances on a 
host of issues, including immigration, gay marriage, criminal justice, voting 
rights and campaign finance. 
 * Republicans believe her prior experience as Obama’s secretary of state 
could be a potential weakness, as many Americans continue to disapprove of the 
current administration’s foreign policy. 
Martin O’Malley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/may/30/martin-omalleys-campaign-resume-as-seen-by-the-guardian>

Odds: 20/1
Age: 52

 * Served two terms as governor of Maryland, where he built a progressive 
record that included legalizing same-sex marriage, abolishing the death 
penalty, decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana, passing 
comprehensive gun control, and providing in-state college tuition to some 
undocumented immigrants. 
 * Served two terms as the mayor of Baltimore, something that has dogged him 
at the start of his campaign, with urban decay affecting large parts of the 
city and contributing to riots between police and the African American 
community. 
Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/apr/30/bernie-sanders-socialist-president-resume>

Odds: 9/1
Age: 73

 * Independent senator from Vermont who is standing as a Democrat and looking 
to challenge Clinton from the left. 
 * A superstar in progressive circles, known for taking on Wall Street, and a 
self-identified “socialist” – something extremely rare in US politics. 
Lincoln Chafee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/03/lincoln-chafee-campaign-resume-guardian>

Odds: 100/1
Age: 62

as an independent.

Jim Webb 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jul/02/jim-webb-presidential-campaign-resume-guardian>

Jeb Bush 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/15/jeb-bush-campaign-resume-guardian>


Odds: 7/4
Age: 62

 * His biggest obstacle is his last name – although he has been fiercely 
defensive of his brother and father, both former presidents. 
 * A former governor of Florida, he is unpopular among conservatives for 
taking moderate positions on immigration and education. 
 * A fundraising powerhouse, the superPAC backing him has raised over $100 
million already. 
Marco Rubio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/apr/13/marco-rubio-campaign-resume-guardian>

Odds: 7/2
Age: 44

 * A first-term senator from Florida, many believe Rubio – young, charismatic 
and the most gifted speaker in the GOP field – has the best shot at defeating 
Clinton. 
 * Born to Cuban immigrants, Rubio’s campaign is built in large part on his 
personal story as the son of a bartender and a hotel maid who rose from modest 
means to national prominence – an American success story. 
Rand Paul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/apr/07/rand-paul-campaign-resume-revealed>

Odds: 10/1
Age: 52

Ron Paul.

surveillance, he forced a temporary expiration of the Patriot Act this month. 
 * Establishment Republicans have tried to derail his campaign by portraying 
him as too “isolationist” on foreign policy. 
Ted Cruz

Age: 44

 * One of the most divisive figures in US politics, the first-term senator 
from Texas is perhaps best known for leading the nation into the 2013 
government shutdown over Obamacare.

immigration reform. 
 * Base is largely evangelical and he is a hardliner on most social issues, 
such as gay marriage and abortion. 
Lindsey Graham

 * Launched his second bid for president despite being indicted last year by a 
grand jury for abusing his power as governor. Perry has denied any wrongdoing.

Odds: 40/1
