Why go now?

With the film Jurassic World <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-world> 
opening last week, the UK’s own Jurassic Coast is an obvious place to visit. 
The 95-mile stretch between Exmouth in Devon and Studland in Dorset is crying 
out “it’s-about-time-you-came-and-saurus!”. T-rexs are thin on the ground, but
Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre <http://www.charmouth.org/chcc/> boasts a 
life-size cast of themost complete dinosaur skeleton ever found in the UK  
<http://www.charmouth.org/chcc/rocks-and-fossils/local-fossils/scelidosaurus#!Scelidosaurus_harrisonii_>
– a plant-eater called a scelidosaurus (whichdisappointingly looks a bit like a 
run-over cat <http://www.devon-online.com/towns/charmouth/Welcome.asp>). 
Charmouth beach is considered the best and safest place for fossil hunting, but 
visitors need to follow strict rules about collecting fossils – donot pack your 
pneumatic drill.Dorset County Museum <http://www.dorsetcountymuseum.org/> in 
Dorchester boasts the world’s biggest bite – a terrifying pliosaur skull. To 
see dinosaur footprints, plod to theSwanage Museum and Heritage Centre 
<http://www.swanagemuseum.co.uk/visitor_info.html>. Lyme Regis Museum 
<http://www.lymeregismuseum.co.uk/> has fossils aplenty and runs fossil-hunting 
walks.

Anywhere to stay under £100 a night? 


Bargain rooms are available at the new Hix Townhouse 
<http://hixtownhouse.co.uk/rates.htm> in Lyme Regis, as two rooms have not yet 
been made over by famous chef Mark Hix. These cost £85 and £95, rather than 
£120-£165 for the revamped ones. At the other end of the coast, theB+B Weymouth 
<http://www.bb-weymouth.com/index.php> costs £70 a night for minimalist rooms.
