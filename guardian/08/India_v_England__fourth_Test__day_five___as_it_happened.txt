Right then, that’s that - again. India have played another brilliant Test, 
Ashwin and Kohli in particular but Vijay and Jayant too. India are developing 
into a brilliant side with brilliant attitude and a brilliant attitude, which 
is brilliant for cricket; enjoy them!

I wonder about his one below; it’s certainly true in some ways, but fatigue 
plays a part too. I’d expect them to have learnt for next time, even it doesn’t 
manifest in Chennai. But the point also ties in with what Kohli said about 
method.

balls in a row. Eng don't have faith in way go about business

It was Kohli, but the point remains.

Ah, a quick stop-press: Ian Ward asks Alastair Cook about staying on as 
captain. He says he is, but references a post-series debrief and isn’t 
emphatic, shall we say.

India have worked very hard on their defence, says Kohli, and because England 
weren’t as confident, they were looking to dominate to accumulate quickly. So, 
plug the boundaries and wait. “We get a couple of wickets and it’s going to 
crumble down pretty quickly,” is his damning conclusion, kicking his opponents 
while they’re down.

Kohli is running out of words to describe Ashwin, who he credits with 60% of 
his team’s success. He knows his bowling and his batting and any team would 
love to have him.

It was a test of patience on this wicket, and because England had a spinner 
less, the two they did have got injured, and the quicks lost confidence on 
account of not being picked, which India sensed and went after them hard.

Virat says that during the lap of honour, he said to Ashwin that last time 
England were in India, they effectively lost the series at the Wankhede. They 
knew the match was over when they got such a monumental first innings lead, but 
he was slightly concerned when England got to 400 in their first innings.

England batted better in this game than in any other on tour, Virat is having 
a series that you dream of, as a player and captain, clearly one of the best of 
the generation and very hard to bowl at in these conditions. He can’t help but 
come back to the missed chances, and is disappointed as 195 is, in a theory, a 
decent third innings total.

He’s asked about the extra seamer and says that it’s a problem of not having 
games between Tests to see how four seamers looks. He also says that it’s the 
seamers who’ve given England control, and perhaps bowling first, four seamers 
would’ve helped. But England “haven’t had enough to get over line”; er, they 
haven’t had enough to get near the line.

He thought 400 was a good score, though perhaps should’ve been 450, and 
laments missed chances at 300-6 in general, specifically those which reprieved 
Virat and Jayant. He congratulates India and says England haven’t been good

Kumble, praising Jayant’s knock. It’s pointed out to him that Ashwin now has 
five variations - the offy, the side-spinner, the floater, the carrom ball and 
the top-spinner, and he says that yerman is always working, expected the carrom 
to be useful today, and most important is the celver set-up work. This could be 
India’s greatest-ever Test side, he concludes.

Ashwin’s figures of 12-167 are the best ever taken by a spinner at the 
Wankhede. He is so, so good, but, equally significantly and as a symbol of this 
Indian side, looks primed to improve too.

This is an absolute caning of a pasting of a humiliation for England, a 
kicking for the ages.They won a great toss, thought they’d struggled to a fair 
total on a raging bunsen, saw India stroll past it as they toiled, then 
crumbled in memorable, classical, typical - but always unique style. This 
morning’s behaviour was supine in the extreme.

55th over England 195-9 (Buttler 6, Anderson 2) Needle out in the middle, 
Kohli jawing at Anderson, others joining in, and Marais Erasmus calming them 
down. Oh, India are enjoying this, and why wouldn’t they? In comes Jadeja and 
naturally, Anderson unfurls the reverse-sweep but doesn’t get enough of it - 
there’s a muted appeal - so he glances the next ball to the leg side and they 
run a single. Buttler then tries the reverse and loops it up, just over the men 
behind the wicket.

WICKET! Rashid c KL Rahul b Ashwin 2 (England 193-9)

Another fifer for Ashwin! Another collapse for England! Rashid has had enough 
of playing the patience game, so flicks one straight to midwicket. Risible, 
hilarious, tragic and pathetic all mixed.

53rd over England 191-8 (Buttler 5, Rashid 1) Jadeja is a very useful bowler 
and almost takes a cee and bee when Rashid drives just past him, but really 
we’re just waiting for more Ashwin; he’s been perfect this morning, even by his 
standards. Two from the over.

WICKET! Woakes b Ashwin 0 (England 189-8)

Oh woe is Woakes. Ashwin tosses one up outside off, and as is only natural for 
a tailender on 0 against a bowler so fearsomely grooved, Woakes tries an 
expansive drive against the spin. Mystifyingly, he misses and is bowled through 
the gate in classic off-spinner style. Toodleo and ten in the match for Ashwin.

52nd over England 189-7 (Buttler 3, Woakes 0) Buttler charges and Ashwin sees 
him coming so sends down another carrom - somehow, Buttler backhands for two, 
then gets another single.

50th over England 185-7 (Buttler 0, Woakes 0) In commentary, they reckon 
Bairstow should’ve spotted the carrom, but he couldn’t have guessed how much 
it’d turn. Anyway, England are in a spot here.

REVIEW! WAS IT GOING DOWN! NO IT WASN'T! Bairstow lbw b Ashwin 51 (England 
185-7)

Ashwin has been so, so good this  morning  Test  series  lifetime. Carrom ball 
again, pitching on the seam, and Bairstow doesn’t get close to picking it, 
forced backwards and unable to get out of the way.

50th over England 185-6 (Bairstow 51, Buttler 0) Bairstow’s beaten again, this 
time by Ashwin, who pitches outside off. But he manages to get his hands out of 
the road, only to be diddled again by a carrom ball aimed at leg stump; it 
yields two byes. Next, a very confident appeal for a catch behind; no bat in 
that; but then another, Bairstow squared on the back foot! AND THIS TIME IT’S 
GIVEN OUT!

49th over England 183-6 (Bairstow 51, Buttler 0) Here comes Jadeja from the 
other end, twizzling the ball in his fingers, and shouts loudly when his second 
delivery thwacks Bairstow’s pad. But it pitched outside leg, so when the umpire 
says no, that’s the end of the matter - India are straight out of reviews. 
Jadeja, though, keeps at it, screaming one past the bat at Bairstow goes back; 
a single follows.

Athers reckons it’s a good thing that Ball went last night, so Buttler can

Yurrrrrrrrrrssss! Yassssssss! We get a “last evening” from Athers, discussing

“Does Jimmy, with this ill-timed wisdom (on deficiencies in Kohli’s 
technique), win the ‘Most Outrageous Comment of the Series’ award, pipping puny 
Parthiv?” asks Anand Viswanathan “(not the chess guy)”.

On which point, check out the devastation here:

And these were the aforementioned comments:

“I’m not sure he’s changed. I just think any technical deficiencies he’s got 
aren’t in play out here. The wickets just take that out of the equation.

“We had success against him in England, but the pace of the pitches over here 
just take any flaws he has out of the equation. There’s not that pace in the 
wicket to get the nicks, like we did against him in England with a bit more 
movement. Pitches like this suit him down to the ground.

“When that’s not there, he’s very much suited to playing in these conditions. 
He’s a very good player of spin and if you’re not bang on the money and don’t 
take your chances, he’ll punish you. We tried to stay patient against him, but 
he just waits and waits and waits. He just played really well.”

It’s tricky, this: Anderson clearly wants to answer the question honestly, and 
probably knows that so doing made him look a bit silly. He is at once biased 
and an authority, able to be both right and wrong. I guess we’ll see the summer 
after next.

“Not sure if this is mathematics of any sort but if England (Buttler) bat all 
day then his double hundred saves English pride,” emails Ian Copestake. “The 
only source of English joy is indeed to see something of Buttler from the start 
without any expectation that he can do anything other than get out soon or be 
miraculous.”

We’ve not seen much miraculosity from Buttler with the “red ball”. But he is

Of course, it is also possible that Jonathan Bairstow and Joseph Buttler bat 
long enough to earn England a draw and accordant series defeat; they may also 
bat long enough to set India a target, which they are bowled out trying to 
reach. I am bound to detail these eventualities; I am not unwell.

Preamble

Does anyone know what board mathematics is? I remember being told as a kid 
that somehow, it made simple sums not add up to what they do in normal 
mathematics; this may, of course, be nonsense.

But even if England had board mathematics in their favour, it’s unlikely 
they’d be able to contrive an equation that leads to anything but a hammering 
off this team in the conditions. It’s true that they could have won the toss in 
Vizag and Stuart Broad might not have got injured, likewise, they might have 
balanced their attack and XI better. But, more likely than not, they’d still be 
behind.

This is a good India side that might just become something better than that. 
They have as imposing a personality as cricket has seen in recent times, they 
know what to do, and they’re going to do it again today, taking an unassailable 
3-0 lead in the series. They’ve earned it.

Right then, that’s that - again. India have played another brilliant Test, 
Ashwin and Kohli in particular but Vijay and Jayant too. India are developing 
into a brilliant side with brilliant attitude and a brilliant attitude, which 
is brilliant for cricket; enjoy them!
 
I wonder about his one below; it’s certainly true in some ways, but fatigue 
plays a part too. I’d expect them to have learnt for next time, even it doesn’t 
manifest in Chennai. But the point also ties in with what Kohli said about 
method.
 Tim (@timwig_cricket) 
Most depresisng thing for England: they've got worse with every Test in India. 
No real signs of any improvement

Ashwin: application difference between the sides. They have hardly blocked 6 
balls in a row. Eng don't have faith in way go about business

It was Kohli, but the point remains. 
 Peter Miller (@TheCricketGeek) 
Hope this series does something to get rid of some of the toss myths that 
float around. England have won 3 out 4 and are 3-0. Best team wins

Ah, a quick stop-press: Ian Ward asks Alastair Cook about staying on as 
captain. He says he is, but references a post-series debrief and isn’t 
emphatic, shall we say.
 
India have worked very hard on their defence, says Kohli, and because England 
weren’t as confident, they were looking to dominate to accumulate quickly. So, 
plug the boundaries and wait. “We get a couple of wickets and it’s going to 
crumble down pretty quickly,” is his damning conclusion, kicking his opponents 
while they’re down.
 
Kohli is running out of words to describe Ashwin, who he credits with 60% of 
his team’s success. He knows his bowling and his batting and any team would 
love to have him.
 
It was a test of patience on this wicket, and because England had a spinner 
less, the two they did have got injured, and the quicks lost confidence on 
account of not being picked, which India sensed and went after them hard.
 
“The series win is probably the sweetest of all that we’ve won in the last 14, 
15 months,” says Kohli.
 
Virat says that during the lap of honour, he said to Ashwin that last time 
England were in India, they effectively lost the series at the Wankhede. They 
knew the match was over when they got such a monumental first innings lead, but 
he was slightly concerned when England got to 400 in their first innings.
 
England batted better in this game than in any other on tour, Virat is having 
a series that you dream of, as a player and captain, clearly one of the best of 
the generation and very hard to bowl at in these conditions. He can’t help but 
come back to the missed chances, and is disappointed as 195 is, in a theory, a 
decent third innings total.
 
He’s asked about the extra seamer and says that it’s a problem of not having 
games between Tests to see how four seamers looks. He also says that it’s the 
seamers who’ve given England control, and perhaps bowling first, four seamers 
would’ve helped. But England “haven’t had enough to get over line”; er, they 
haven’t had enough to get near the line.
 
He thought 400 was a good score, though perhaps should’ve been 450, and 
laments missed chances at 300-6 in general, specifically those which reprieved 
Virat and Jayant. He congratulates India and says England haven’t been good 
enough to match them.
 
“Alastair, this must have been a frustrating game for you...”
 
Ravi Ashwin is man of the match, for his silly bowling. 
 
“The difference between these two sides is immeasurable,” reckons Nick Knight. 
Er, roughly about an innings and 36 runs, I’d guesstimate.
 
“That’s a defeat by an innings and 36 runs, after England won the toss, batted 
first and scored 400 runs,” reminds Nabakrishna Hazarika.

Thanks, Nabakrishna Hazarika!
 
Both Ashwin and Murali Vijay are looking forward to Chennai. More news as I 
get it.
 
Last time England were here, India collapsed mentally, says Ashwin. He had to 
wait for a surface with bounce to exhibit his topspinner, as otherwise it sits 
there and can be hit.
 
“In the four Test matches we have played we have lost three tosses,” says Anil 
Kumble, praising Jayant’s knock. It’s pointed out to him that Ashwin now has 
five variations - the offy, the side-spinner, the floater, the carrom ball and 
the top-spinner, and he says that yerman is always working, expected the carrom 
to be useful today, and most important is the celver set-up work. This could be 
India’s greatest-ever Test side, he concludes.
 
India are enjoying themselves a lap of honour. 
 
Ashwin’s figures of 12-167 are the best ever taken by a spinner at the 
Wankhede. He is so, so good, but, equally significantly and as a symbol of this 
Indian side, looks primed to improve too.
 
This is an absolute caning of a pasting of a humiliation for England, a 
kicking for the ages.They won a great toss, thought they’d struggled to a fair 
total on a raging bunsen, saw India stroll past it as they toiled, then 
crumbled in memorable, classical, typical - but always unique style. This 
morning’s behaviour was supine in the extreme.
 
Ashwin took 4-6 in four overs this morning. A fair effort. 
 
Anderson flicks to mid on. 
 
55th over England 195-9 (Buttler 6, Anderson 2) Needle out in the middle, 
Kohli jawing at Anderson, others joining in, and Marais Erasmus calming them 
down. Oh, India are enjoying this, and why wouldn’t they? In comes Jadeja and 
naturally, Anderson unfurls the reverse-sweep but doesn’t get enough of it - 
there’s a muted appeal - so he glances the next ball to the leg side and they 
run a single. Buttler then tries the reverse and loops it up, just over the men 
behind the wicket.
 
54th over England 194-9 (Buttler 6, Anderson 1) England! Ashwin!
 
Another fifer for Ashwin! Another collapse for England! Rashid has had enough 
of playing the patience game, so flicks one straight to midwicket. Risible, 
hilarious, tragic and pathetic all mixed.
 
54th over England 193-8 (Buttler 6, Rashid 2) Ashwin has been bowling 
top-spinners this morning, Kumble-style - or, put another way, he can get a 
lot, lot better!

 <https://twitter.com/ESPNcricinfo/status/808164800656093184>  
53rd over England 191-8 (Buttler 5, Rashid 1) Jadeja is a very useful bowler 
and almost takes a cee and bee when Rashid drives just past him, but really 
we’re just waiting for more Ashwin; he’s been perfect this morning, even by his 
standards. Two from the over.
 
52nd over England 189-8 (Buttler 4, Rashid 0) England need 42 to avoid an 
innings defeat.
 
Oh woe is Woakes. Ashwin tosses one up outside off, and as is only natural for 
a tailender on 0 against a bowler so fearsomely grooved, Woakes tries an 
expansive drive against the spin. Mystifyingly, he misses and is bowled through 
the gate in classic off-spinner style. Toodleo and ten in the match for Ashwin.
 
52nd over England 189-7 (Buttler 3, Woakes 0) Buttler charges and Ashwin sees 
him coming so sends down another carrom - somehow, Buttler backhands for two, 
then gets another single.
 
51st over England 186-7 (Buttler 1, Woakes 0) Jadeja rushes through another 
over, with Buttler getting off the mark to backaward square.
 
50th over England 185-7 (Buttler 0, Woakes 0) In commentary, they reckon 
Bairstow should’ve spotted the carrom, but he couldn’t have guessed how much 
it’d turn. Anyway, England are in a spot here.
 
Ashwin has been so, so good this  morning  Test  series  lifetime. Carrom ball 
again, pitching on the seam, and Bairstow doesn’t get close to picking it, 
forced backwards and unable to get out of the way.
 
50th over England 185-6 (Bairstow 51, Buttler 0) Bairstow’s beaten again, this 
time by Ashwin, who pitches outside off. But he manages to get his hands out of 
the road, only to be diddled again by a carrom ball aimed at leg stump; it 
yields two byes. Next, a very confident appeal for a catch behind; no bat in 
that; but then another, Bairstow squared on the back foot! AND THIS TIME IT’S 
GIVEN OUT!
 
49th over England 183-6 (Bairstow 51, Buttler 0) Here comes Jadeja from the 
other end, twizzling the ball in his fingers, and shouts loudly when his second 
delivery thwacks Bairstow’s pad. But it pitched outside leg, so when the umpire 
says no, that’s the end of the matter - India are straight out of reviews. 
Jadeja, though, keeps at it, screaming one past the bat at Bairstow goes back; 
a single follows.
 
48th over England 182-6 (Bairstow 50, Buttler 0) Buttler defends Ashwin’s 
first ball, plays late as the second turns well past the bat, and defends the 
third. Wicket maiden.
 
Ashwin will finish his over from last evening. 
 
The horns are blaring as Buttler takes guard; can England make it to lunch?
 
Athers reckons it’s a good thing that Ball went last night, so Buttler can 
play himself in on a fresher surface.
 
Here come the fielding side!
 
Exactly.

<https://twitter.com/bbctms/status/808157611040313346>  
They’re not going to be saved by the rain. The Wankhede looks absolutely 
beautiful this morning.
 
Athers doesn’t think that England can do it. 
 
109: number of seconds it took Sky to mention Botham at Headingley.
 
“Does Jimmy, with this ill-timed wisdom (on deficiencies in Kohli’s 
technique), win the ‘Most Outrageous Comment of the Series’ award, pipping puny 
Parthiv?” asks Anand Viswanathan “(not the chess guy)”.

On which point, check out the devastation here:

And these were the aforementioned comments:

“I’m not sure he’s changed. I just think any technical deficiencies he’s got 
aren’t in play out here. The wickets just take that out of the equation.

“We had success against him in England, but the pace of the pitches over here 
just take any flaws he has out of the equation. There’s not that pace in the 
wicket to get the nicks, like we did against him in England with a bit more 
movement. Pitches like this suit him down to the ground.

“When that’s not there, he’s very much suited to playing in these conditions. 
He’s a very good player of spin and if you’re not bang on the money and don’t 
take your chances, he’ll punish you. We tried to stay patient against him, but 
he just waits and waits and waits. He just played really well.”

It’s tricky, this: Anderson clearly wants to answer the question honestly, and 
probably knows that so doing made him look a bit silly. He is at once biased 
and an authority, able to be both right and wrong. I guess we’ll see the summer 
after next.
 
“Not sure if this is mathematics of any sort but if England (Buttler) bat all 
day then his double hundred saves English pride,” emails Ian Copestake. “The 
only source of English joy is indeed to see something of Buttler from the start 
without any expectation that he can do anything other than get out soon or be 
miraculous.”

We’ve not seen much miraculosity from Buttler with the “red ball”. But he is 
capable...
 
Of course, it is also possible that Jonathan Bairstow and Joseph Buttler bat 
long enough to earn England a draw and accordant series defeat; they may also 
bat long enough to set India a target, which they are bowled out trying to 
reach. I am bound to detail these eventualities; I am not unwell.
 
Does anyone know what board mathematics is? I remember being told as a kid 
that somehow, it made simple sums not add up to what they do in normal 
mathematics; this may, of course, be nonsense.

But even if England had board mathematics in their favour, it’s unlikely 
they’d be able to contrive an equation that leads to anything but a hammering 
off this team in the conditions. It’s true that they could have won the toss in 
Vizag and Stuart Broad might not have got injured, likewise, they might have 
balanced their attack and XI better. But, more likely than not, they’d still be 
behind.

This is a good India side that might just become something better than that. 
They have as imposing a personality as cricket has seen in recent times, they 
know what to do, and they’re going to do it again today, taking an unassailable 
3-0 lead in the series. They’ve earned it.
 
Daniel will be here shortly. In the meantime, why not relive yesterday’s 
action with Vic Marks’ report, which begins with the words “The end is nigh”?
