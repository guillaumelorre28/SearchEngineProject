The nights are drawing in. Autumn evenings are getting duskier, mistier, 
cooler. Early mornings are darker. Soon we’ll be living large parts of our 
lives under a nocturnal cloak.

As the dark deepens it unleashes imagination and stories of ghosts and 
witches; dreams and nightmares populate the night. Autumn is the time when they 
creep out of the lengthening shadows, ready for Halloween. As the world gets 
darker it also gets more interesting. That is what many artists find, anyway.

 Night thoughts … Louise Bourgeois, Insomnia, 2000. Photograph: Christopher 
Burke/ © The Easton Foundation 
A timely exhibition at the Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne, called Towards Night
 <http://www.townereastbourne.org.uk/exhibition/towards-night/>, surveys “the 
nocturnal” in art from the Romantic nights of Caspar David Friedrich and JMW 
Turner, through the dreamlike nights of Edvard Munch and Marc Chagall, to night 
scenes and thoughts by the likes of Louise Bourgeois and Peter Doig.

In Doig’s painting Echo Lake 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/doig-echo-lake-t07467>, which features in 
the show, a shadowy forest is reflected in dark water, with a strip of luminous 
shore bisecting the picture horizontally. Darkness is the realm of possibility 
and danger, folklore, fear and desire. A policeman stands on the edge of the 
lake, looking into the dark.

It is no coincidence that many of the artists listed above are from northern 
latitudes, where winter nights can be long and dark. Doig himself was born in 
Scotland and spent a lot of his youth in Canada. Friedrich, from northern 
Germany, and Munch, from Norway, are artists whose imaginations turn towards 
magnetic north, even towardsthe Arctic itself 
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_David_Friedrich#/media/File%3ACaspar_David_Friedrich_-_Das_Eismeer_-_Hamburger_Kunsthalle_-_02.jpg>
 – and towards the night. In his 1893 paintingVampire 
<http://www.edvardmunch.org/vampire.jsp>, for instance, Munch fleshes out one 
of the darkest of all night terrors.

The night and its strangeness are the north’s great gift to European art. 
Mediterranean art is sunny; it loves light. From thepure blue skies 
<https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/raphael-the-mond-crucifixion> of 
Italian Renaissance paintings tothe sunshine of Cézanne 
<https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/paul-cezanne-hillside-in-provence>
, glorious daylight fills the Mediterranean eye.

The night is full of terrors, from witches to loneliness, yet it is a 
labyrinth of mystery and beauty

It took northern European artists to reveal the wonder of darkness. Geertgen 
tot Sint Jans’s paintingThe Nativity at Night 
<https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/geertgen-tot-sint-jans-the-nativity-at-night>
, a very early Dutch masterpiece from about 1490, uses the inky darkness that 
surrounds Mary and her child to set off their illuminated holiness. This moving 
idea, of the nativity in the dark as a glowing moment of fragile humanity 
pitched against the shadows, would still be a powerful Dutch themein the age of 
Rembrandt <http://web.sbu.edu/theology/bychkov/rembrandt_nativity.html>.

Yet northern artists were also driven to look beyond the consoling 
hearthlight, into night’s most dreadful depths. The German Renaissance artist 
Hans Baldung Grien was obsessed withdepicting witches 
<http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/336235> at their midnight 
sabbaths. Centuries later in his paintingThe Night 
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_(painting)#/media/File%3AMax_Beckmann%2C_1918-19%2C_The_Night_(Die_Nacht)%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_133_x_154_cm%2C_Kunstsammlung_Nordrhein-Westfalen%2C_Düsseldorf.jpg>
, the German expressionist Max Beckmann unveils a Weimar Berlin night of 
madness and depravity.

Vincent van Gogh, a northern artist who found himself in the south of France, 
painted one of the eeriest of all night-life scenes after he fell out with a 
cafe owner. He told the owner he was going to get revenge by setting up his 
easel in his cafe and portraying its sleazy atmosphere. The night drinkers and 
prostitutes enjoyed Van Gogh’s portrayal of their haunt, watching him paint it 
as a kind of performance art. The result isThe Night Café 
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Caf%C3%A9#/media/File%3ALe_café_de_nuit_(The_Night_Café)_by_Vincent_van_Gogh.jpeg>
, with its lurid green and red tones and sense of futility and desolation. 
Edward Hopper captures that same nocturnal desolation in his small-hours 
painting Nighthawks.

The night is full of terrors, from witches to loneliness, yet it is a 
labyrinth of mystery and beauty. The strangest and most marvellous art 
experience I have had this year involved going into total darkness equipped 
only with a torch. After clambering over slippery, sharp surfaces and through 
narrow, claustrophobic apertures, we finally reached a pitch-black gallery 
where spotlights were turned on to reveal the art. This was not an installation 
at Tate Modern buta cave in the Pyrenees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2010/aug/11/cave-paintings-rock-art>
. Here, deep underground, ice age artists drew bison and ibex with charcoal 
13,000 years ago. Why did the ice age artists explore such deep, dark places? 
Why is the oldest art in the world shrouded in permanent night? It has to be 
that our imaginations crave darkness. Only in the dark can we forget the banal 
distraction of daylit reality and enter a visionary realm of dreams. Art is a 
creature of the night.
