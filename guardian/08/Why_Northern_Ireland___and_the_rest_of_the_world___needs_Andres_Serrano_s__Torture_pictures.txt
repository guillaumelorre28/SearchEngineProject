There are two reasons that Northern Ireland is a particularly pungent place 
for Andres Serrano to show his Torture pictures, currentlyon view at Void in 
Derry <http://www.derryvoid.com/>. One is the violent history of the Troubles. 
The other is the Christian imagery that haunts the artist.

In Serrano’s notorious image Piss Christ 
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piss_Christ#/media/File%3APiss_Christ_by_Serrano_Andres_(1987).jpg>
, a crucifix is suspended in a tank of orange urine. When it was made in 1987, 
Northern Ireland was in the midst of something that resembled a civil war. 
Protestants fought Catholics and the IRA fought the British army. Altogether,
3,600 people were killed in the Troubles <http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/troubles>
 between 1968 and 1998, when the Good Friday agreement began today’s peace.

 Transcending any one cause or crime … Untitled XII. 
Since 1998, political violence has become a lot rarer in Northern Ireland, but 
the horrors of terror and torture have scarcely vanished from the world. 
Serrano started staging photographs about modern torture when he was 
commissioned tocreate a cover on this theme for the New York Times Magazine in 
2005 <http://www.a-political.org/projects/andres-serrano/torture/>. His image 
of a facehidden by a horrific black hood 
<http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2005/06/09/magazine/12cover.1.html> 
illustrated an essay about the torture of prisoners by US personnel atAbu Ghraib
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/20/usa.iraq> prison in Iraq. In 
2015 he returned to this disturbing subject in a series of pictures made with 
survivors of torture. The participants in Serrano’s Torture series have been 
tortured in real life. Courageously, they allow him to recreate their 
sufferings by posing in baroque staged versions of their ordeal.

Among the participants are some of Northern Ireland’s “hooded men”. In 1971, 
as the Irish Times and others have reported, as British panic over the crisis 
in Northern Ireland grew,14 men were taken to a British army site 
<http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/the-torture-centre-northern-ireland-s-hooded-men-1.2296152>
 on an old airfield at Ballykelly in County Derry. They were made to wear hoods 
and, the survivors claim, subjected to systematic torture.

“Sometimes the hood would be lifted and there was this figure in silhouette 
firing questions and abuse – telling you your wife had done filthy, terrible 
things and your kids were in care,”Liam Shannon 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-25139360>, one of the hooded 
men, told the Irish Times. “I was sure they were going to kill me anyway, so I 
just said, ‘Aye, dead on.’” These experiences are restaged in Serrano’s 
pictures, with the participation of some of the hooded men themselves.

Serrano’s pictures at Derry’s Void gallery are not just echoes of a troubled 
past but acts of witness in a dispute that is far from over. The men 
interrogated by the British army in 1971 are campaigning to have their 
treatment recognised as torture at the European court of human rights. In April 
this year, their lawyers accused Theresa Villiers, then the Northern Ireland 
secretary, ofdeliberately holding back documents that could help them 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-35980913>. Amnesty International 
has called for their case to be reopened 
<http://www.amnesty.eu/en/news/press-releases/eu/torture/uk-ireland-landmark-hooded-men-torture-case-should-be-re-opened-0811/#.WA3qMut4WrU>
. Clearly Serrano still has the nose for trouble that he did whenhe created

Yet his images of hooded torture victims transcend any one cause or crime. The 
hoods make these frail human bodies look anonymous and universal. Helpless and 
naked before the camera, theyresemble saints in baroque paintings 
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_St._Peter_(Caravaggio)#/media/File%3AMartirio_di_San_Pietro_September_2015-1a.jpg>
. Serrano’s depiction of a suffering that extends from Derry in 1971 to the 
political dungeons of today is both a call for justice and a compassionate 
portrayal of the human plight – our tragic embodiment, born to suffer, born to 
die.

As for the Troubles, they are not over in the minds of people from all sides 
and communities who saw and suffered them. Now that Brexit has transformed 
every aspect of British nationhood, some fear thatNorthern Ireland’s peace 
process may even be in danger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/oct/20/bands-of-brothers-could-brexit-bring-the-troubles-back-to-northern-ireland-video>
. Could those hooded ghosts come back?
