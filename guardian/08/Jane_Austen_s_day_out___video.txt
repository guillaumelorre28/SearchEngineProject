Fierce divisions have broken out among the Guardian books team as to whether 
this video, bringing a statue of Jane Austen to life, is delightful or naff. 
Either way, it has amassed quite a following since it was launched on Facebook 
by Bathâ€™s Jane Austen Centre <http://www.janeausten.co.uk/> on Monday. It 
certainly raises the profile of the two cast members, Martin Salter, whose day 
job is meeting and greeting tourists at the centre, and tour guide Lauren 
Thompson, whose day out as Jane takes her through the Georgian streets of the 
heritage city and beyond. What the statue makes of its makeover is unknown.
