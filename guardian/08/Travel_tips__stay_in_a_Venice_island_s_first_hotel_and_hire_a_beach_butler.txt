Take me there: Murano, Venice

The first hotel has opened on the Venetian island of Murano, the heart of the 
city's glass-making industry. LaGare Hotel Venezia was built in a glass furnace 
dating back to the 14th century. There are 118 bedrooms, and a restaurant and 
bar opening on to a courtyard, which serves some of the best Bellinis around. 
Look out for lamps and chandeliers designed by Venini, Murano's famous glass 
maker, and take a private tour of the glassworks. With its canals and narrow 
streets, Murano offers a peaceful and atmospheric escape from crowded St Mark's 
Square, which can be reached on a complimentary speedboat shuttle. From €196 
per night (lagarehotelvenezia.com <http://www.lagarehotelvenezia.com/en/>)

It's a good time to...hire a beach butler

All it takes is a couple of weeks of warm weather and suddenly we think we're 
in California. How else to explain the news that Blackpool has introduced its 
first "beach butler"? It sounds like the sort of thing you're more likely to 
come across in Santa Monica or the Maldives, but Tiffany's Hotel on Blackpool 
Promenade has started offering the service – whereby a hotel staff member will 
bring guests cool drinks and sandwiches at prearranged times as they sit on the 
beach – as a response to the recent heatwave (tiffanyshotel.co.uk 
<http://tiffanyshotel.co.uk/>).

A fancier version of this service is on offer this summer courtesy of the 
Grand Hotel in Brighton. Guests opting for the new Butler on the Beach package 
can sit back and relax while the butler sets up deck chairs, parasols and an 
iPod dock, and then tuck into a selection of either lobster and chips, a 
seafood platter or traditional afternoon tea, served with a bottle of 
champagne (from £200 per couple,devere-hotels.co.uk/the-grand 
<http://www.devere-hotels.co.uk/hotel-lodges/locations/the-grand.html>). 
The butler is then on hand to fill up your glass with Pimm's, offer cold towels 
and come to the rescue with sun cream – or perhaps an umbrella. This is 
Brighton, not Santa Barbara, after all.
