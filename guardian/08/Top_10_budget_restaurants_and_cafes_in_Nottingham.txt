Junkyard

Somewhat hidden on Bridlesmith Walk, this superlative craft-beer outlet also 
serves unusually good bar food. A brunch ofhuevos rancheros and pancakes is a 
good start before an assault on its IPAs, as, later, might be shared 
charcuterie and cheese boards or small plates such as short rib in Baltic 
porter gravy or mac’n’cheese balls with arrabiata sauce. The best value is in 
its larger plates and, particularly, in taking them away, as you get 25% off. I 
lingered over a half of Cloudwater’s excellent spring 2015 IPA (£2.24, Junkyard 
has 15 keg lines), while the kitchen rustled up my Cuban sandwich: a serious 
stack of ham, salami and roast pork, topped with Swiss cheese, dill pickles and 
French’s mustard, served on (for once) genuinely lactic, grilled sourdough. It 
was £8.80 well spent.

Every city needs an Edin Gondzic. At his deli-cafe (15 Broad Street) and 
latterly Edin’s Kitchen, the Bosnian restaurateur has repeatedly proven it is 
possible to deliver tasty, homemade food at knock-down prices. This eccentric 
space – its every available surface covered in junk shop bric-a-brac – serves 
glossy pastries, salads and sandwiches, as well as a global grab-bag of mains 
at around £7. For instance, gnocchi in a blue cheese sauce or Lincolnshire 
sausages with a spicy lentil and coriander stew. Everything’s a quid or so 
cheaper to takeaway, or you can opt for Edin’s set two-course £8.95 menu (£7.50 
until 5pm). My slow-cooked spiced lamb tagine had serious depth of flavour and 
came with remarkably buttery, almond-threaded couscous. Edin’s has an 
affordable wine selection and stocks beers from local breweriesCastle Rock

Opposite St Mary’s Church amid the handsome architecture of Nottingham’s Lace 
Market, the Kean’s Head pub is a nice change from the glitzier bars in the area 
and a great place to eat. The bar serves sandwiches, snack items (including 
Hartland’s renowned pork pies) and platters, as well as more hearty grub, 
including pub classics and various filling and flavoursome hashes served on 
doorsteps of fresh bread. This is fresh, well-seasoned, scratch-cooked stuff, 
yet none of the dishes tops £10. Owned by local brewery Castle Rock, this 
spruce one-room pub is also one of Nottingham’s best cask and craft beer bars 
(pint from £3).

Yamas is a contemporary Greek restaurant: there are no plate-smashing antics; 
the music, a soundtrack of bouzouki-led folk, is discreet and laid-back; and 
designer rustic art and wooden carvings decorate an otherwise simple space. All 
the action happens on the plate, in a variety of tapas and meze which, between 
midday and 4pm, Wednesday to Saturday, cost £6.95 for three. Portions are very 
generous and the food, while not boasting much in the way of finesse, delivers 
big, robust flavours. A herby sausage (loukanika), sliced and fried in onions, 
had a rather chewy texture, like an overdone Frankfurter, but was curiously 
moreish. Thestifado beef casserole, its tomato sauce fragrant with cinnamon and 
mined with tiny black peppercorns, is like meeting a friend’s jovial Greek 
uncle: it is a stocky, bustling, back-slapping pleasure.

200 Degrees

This wood-panelled room, at one time the Flying Horse Inn, is now Nottingham’s 
de facto third-wave coffee hub – the high-street face of a local,small-batch 
coffee-roaster <http://200degs.com/>. As well as a highly creditable flat white 
(coffee from £1.70), it is also a good place to pick up filled croissants, 
quiches and offbeat soups and salads, all prepared on site each morning. The 
sandwiches are not huge (for the money, £4.95), but this is a matter of quality 
over quantity. These innovatively filled flatbreads and sangers – BBQ pulled 
chicken, tomato, smoked cheddar; cauliflower cheese with chilli and spinach – 
certainly deliver on flavour. My braised beef baguette with mustard and 
emmental actually made effective use of one of food’s most egregious 
ingredients, red and yellow peppers. Fried to a sweet, melting fruitiness, they 
were a genuinely welcome addition. Who knew that was even possible?

Oscar and Rosie’s at Das Kino

With its table tennis, graffiti-spattered photo booth and air of faded 
grandeur, the Das Kino bar is clearly trying to recreate a little East Berlin 
in central Nottingham. The food, however, is more New York than Neukölln. Oscar 
and Rosie’s has thin-crust, stone-baked pizzas topped with high-quality 
ingredients, from (terrific) ham hock to butternut squash, and they have names 
such as Meat Sweats and Boom Chicken Wah-Wah. Personally, I prefer a Neapolitan 
slice (simple, wood-fired, classic ingredients), but this was nonetheless 
thoroughly enjoyable pie. Until 4pm, you can bag yourself a lunch-sized 9in 
pizza for £5 (£7 weekends), as well as various mac’n’cheese dishes and daily 
one-pot specials. Moving into the evening, a couple could eat here, splitting a 
14in pizza and a big salad with a couple of small beers, for just over £20. 
Alternatively, take away and eat as you walk.

It is a steep ascent up Derby Road to this real ale pub, but it’s worth the 
exertion – for two reasons. The Hand and Heart is built into a sandstone cave, 
hewn from the rocky slope it sits on, and it also does a solid line in 
affordable pub grub. It serves hot rolls (fish fingers and homemade tartare 
sauce, pulled pork and honey mustard etc), cheeseboards and snack items all day 
and, until 4pm, a set lunch that includes main courses at £7.95. The Hand and 
Heart’s rare, sweet’n’smoky bavette steak, served with a decent garnish of 
leaves and pickled radish, has to be one of Nottingham’s best bargains. The 
chips are an abrupt challenge to accepted wisdom, too: they are bought-in and 
fried on-site and – utterly crisp without, perfectly fluffy within – are miles 
better than most pubs’ attempts at homemade, triple-cooked chips. The pub’s 
eight real ales are well looked after (pint from £2.70), if a little 
traditional for today’s young, thrusting craft cavaliers.

This is Christian outreach work that even Richard Dawkins would struggle to 
quibble with. The Malt Cross is a one-time Victorian music hall – a partial 
glass atrium full of wrought-iron period detail – that has been refurbished by 
a Christian charity and is now run as a cafe-bar and arts centre. Its profits 
fund the upkeep of the building and the group’s street pastors, who offer 
assistance to distressed late-night revellers. Militant atheists may bridle at 
the subtext to all this, but you would have to look hard to discern any 
Christian messaging at Malt Cross. There may be a dedicated prayer room 
somewhere, but to most people this will simply look like a beautiful old 
building, which serves superb craft and cask beers (pint from £3.30), and great 
hulking piles of smoked meats – as sandwiches and salads. A super-soft brioche 
bun stacked with melting, hickory-smoked brisket necessitated a mopping up 
operation that required several napkins. Elsewhere, the menu includes several 
trad-pub dishes, a burger, fish and chips, bubble and squeak, at just under £10.

 A meal in a bun – the fajita burger Photograph: PR 
Among burger fanatics, there are many purists for whom maximum beefiness is 
the ultimate goal. These people eat their burgers with minimal toppings and can 
tell you, in detail, the correct ratio of fat to lean meat and the precise 
blend of chuck, brisket, sirloin or short rib that will produce the finest 
all-beef burger. Annie’s American owner, Anmarie Spaziano, takes a more 
freewheeling approach. She makes what she describes as “authentic Rhode 
Island-style burgers” (85% beef, 15% pork, distinctively seasoned with smoked 
paprika), and is not afraid of outlandish toppings, from seafood sauce and king 
prawns to square Scottish sausage. I was a little sceptical, but my “German” – 
a well-charred and moist burger, topped with sauerkraut and American mustard – 
was highly persuasive. Little wonder this homage to rural US diners has been 
such a hit. Please note, not all of the Annie’s menu comes in below this 
series’ £10-a-head cut-off. There’s a choice of 10 burger and hotdog meals for 
under £10. Incidentally, if you love “dude food” and are a little short on 
cash, you may want to check out the £6.95, express lunch dishes at Red’s True 
Barbecue (11 Queen Street,truebarbecue.com <http://truebarbecue.com/nottingham/>

George’s Tradition

If you’re hankering after great fish and chips in Nottingham, it can involve a 
bit of a hike. Five miles out of the centre, in Wollaton, is the 
multi-award-winningCod’s Scallops <http://www.codsscallops.com/>. George’s 
Tradition – about three miles from the centre, in West Bridgford – may not 
enjoy quite the same glittering rep but it knocks out a reliably good fish 
supper and is actually more convenient – particularly if you are visiting Trent 
Bridge for the cricket or Nottingham Forest’s City Ground (they are 15 minutes 
away on foot). The menu at George’s, a small regional chain, takes in homemade 
pies, fishcakes and sustainably caught cod and haddock served in an admirably 
clean, light batter with genuine chip-shop chips. That is, chips that are a 
little chewy and caramelised at the edges, rather than shatteringly crisp, and 
that taste readily of freshly harvested potato. The tartare sauce, however, a 
sweet indistinct gloop, needs work. A good tartare, chunky with capers and 
gherkins, is a simple thing to produce and can transform good fish and chips, 
which these undoubtedly are, into a truly outstanding meal.
