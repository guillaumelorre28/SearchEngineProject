Green Rooms is the brainchild of Nick Hartwright, co-founder of the Mill Co 
Project 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/06/arts-hotel-creative-space-housing-cuts>
, another social enterprise that offers affordable workspace and exhibition 
space.

Hartwright worked with Kurt Bredenbeck, the man behind the Hoxton Hotel, in 
order to bring his idea to life. The hotel also had support from Haringey 
council and received £9m in funding from the mayor of London’sHigh Street Fund 
<https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/regeneration/high-streets/high-street-fund>
.

“There are thousands of hotels in London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> but there is a real shortage of 
affordable hotel accommodation that doesn’t compromise on quality,” said 
Hartwright.

“We are confident that artists, creatives, style enthusiasts and the wider 
local community will love staying and working at Green Rooms. It’s going to be 
an exciting, inclusive and accessible creative environment.”
