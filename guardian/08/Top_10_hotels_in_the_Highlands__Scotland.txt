Glenfinnan House Hotel


A Victorian mansion with lawns down to Loch Shiel and the Glenfinnan Monument 
over the water. There’s no shortbread-tin twee or tartan carpet here; instead a 
warm welcome from the MacFarlanes and managers, the Gibsons, and an atmospheric 
bar (with music on Thursdays). Try smoked venison or kippers for breakfast 
before heading out to explore the Glenfinnan area on foot, or by boat – on a 
loch cruise (highlandcruises.co.uk <http://highlandcruises.co.uk/>) or for the 
more energetic, a kayak, (rockhopperscotland.co.uk 
<http://www.rockhopperscotland.co.uk/>). Great for kids and quintessentially 
Scottish.

The Ceilidh Place, Ullapool

What started out in the 1970s as a coffee shop and exhibition space in a boat 
shed, has spread along a row of cottages and now comprises a restaurant, 
bookshop, cafe-bar (and performance) area with bedrooms upstairs. The bar and 
restaurant go all day, from famously good breakfasts to a dinner menu (last 
orders 9pm). A bunkhouse across the road offers cheaper accommodation. Live 
music and events are on throughout the year, though you can simply sit in the 
cosy downstairs parlour or, if you’re a hotel guest, in the lounge upstairs 
with its honesty bar – or maybe even on the terrace overlooking Ullapool where 
the boats come in.

This small but perfectly conceived and formed hotel at the corner of 
north-west Scotland has been in the Mackay family for generations. Fiona and 
Robbie have transformed a solid old house into a cool spot where in summer the 
light lingers forever. Wood and slate; discreet but efficient service; comfy 
beds in calm, stylish rooms. There’s no bar or restaurant so eat at theSango 
Sands Oasis pub <http://sangosands.com/restaurant-and-bar-for-food/>. As well 
as the adjacent bunkhouse, it now has two fabulous new eco-cottages at Lade, 
9km east, overlooking Loch Eriboll. Go treat yourself in splendid isolation.

On the town’s main street, in the middle of the Black Isle, a peninsula, 
surrounded on three sides by water – the Cromarty Firth to the north, the 
Beauly Firth to the south, and Moray Firth to the east, this very individual 
hotel has a restaurant, reasonable rooms and a bar notable for an extraordinary 
bottled ales and whisky collection. Anne Anderson manages a perhaps unfeasibly 
long daily-changing menu (smokes the venison, makes the black pudding and just 
about everything else) in the atmospheric bar and dining room. It’s a find!

This contemporary, comfortable roadside hotel at the southern tip of Loch Ness 
on the road to Fort William, is unquestionably the best in the area. 
Refurbished and very effectively run, and with an award-winning restaurant,
Station Road <https://www.thelovat.com/dining/restaurant>, offering a 
five-course menu and brasserie serving local, seasonal produce, such as 
slow-cooked Highland beef cheek, smoked potato, haggis ravioli, Scottish roots 
and shoulder of Black Isle lamb. Good looks and smart service in the heart of 
the Great Glen.

A former fishing lodge, Justin and Lucy Swabey’s mountain-facing hideaway has 
spectacular views to the Grey Corries and Aonach Mor. Loch Ness, Inverness, the 
Isle of Skye and Ben Nevis are all within easy reach, while Fort William – with 
the Lochaber area, designated the “Outdoor Capital of the UK” – is a short 
drive away. It does a lovely set dinner (£28pp) and the rooms (no kids under 
seven) are simple and cosy. There are two turf-roofed self-catering chalets in 
the grounds of the lodge. Great walks begin here.
• Doubles from £43 B&B (open April-October, closed Sundays and Mondays);

Centre <http://www.lochness.com/home.aspx>, is this functional roadhouse hotel 
– quite the best in the area and with a notable restaurant that’s invariably 
full (it’s advisable to book). The estimable Judy Fish fromthe Applecross Inn 
<http://www.applecross.uk.com/inn/> has a hand in this and supplies the 
langoustines, while the fresh fish hails from Mallaig. There’s a separate bar 
menu and a beer garden out the back.

Linnhe at the foot of Ben Nevis, Lime Tree is a working studio for artistDavid 
Wilson <http://www.artfortwilliam.co.uk/>, and a gallery hosting his paintings. 
Most of the nine rooms, decorated with David’s art, overlook the loch. The 
award-winning restaurant offers the likes of west-coast mussels, Ardnamurchan 
venison and Scottish hake.

Chris and Cathryn Field’s cosily furnished hotel is set in a line of 
whitewashed cottages on the seafront, where the magnificent Torridon mountains 
meet the western seas. You’ll find spectacular walking trails and deserted 
beaches – home for seals, otters and sea eagles. There are two restaurants: the 
main one offers a fixed price four-course meal, while the Shieldaig Bar and 
Coastal Kitchen is for less formal dining; both offer fantastic local food and 
there’s live music at weekends. A good spot at the heart of a Highland village 
in one ofScotland’s last great wildernesses

route – and packed lunches. Or explore on two wheels: there are mountain bike
