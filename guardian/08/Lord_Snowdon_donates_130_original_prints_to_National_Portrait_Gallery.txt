Haunting portrait photographs, including a swan-necked David Bowie 
photographed in 1978, the playwright Nell Dunn looking startlingly like a 
long-lost Bowie twin, and Vita Sackville-West, the writer, gardener and former 
lover of Virginia Woolf who was still formidable in the year before her death 
in 1962, have been donated to theNational Portrait Gallery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/national-portrait-gallery> by the 
society photographer Lord Snowdon.

The gift of 130 original prints, including photographs of his former in-laws 
from the years he was married to Princess Margaret, is one of the largest ever 
to the gallery.

Other portraits gifted to the gallery feature actors John Hurt and Alan Bates, 
writers Kingsley Amis and Graham Greene, musicians Yehudi Menuhin and George 
Melly and artist Barbara Hepworth.

Several of the portraits will be exhibited for the first time in a free 
exhibition on his life and work opening at the gallery in September. The 
exhibition was already being curated from works that Snowdon donated last year.

The director of the NPG, Sandy Nairne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/12/national-portrait-gallery-director-sandy-nairne-leave-early-2015>
, said: "These are wonderful portrait images of some most creative and engaging 
contributors to Britain in the second half of the 20th century."

â€¢ Snowdon: A Life In View will run at the National Portrait Gallery, London, 
from 26 September 2014 to 21 June 2015.
