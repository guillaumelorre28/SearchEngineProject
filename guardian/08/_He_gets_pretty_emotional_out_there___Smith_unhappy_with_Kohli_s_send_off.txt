Australian captain Steve Smith has fired back at Virat Kohli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/virat-kohli>, suggesting the Indian 
superstar’s animated send-off at Adelaide Oval was just not cricket. Kohli 
plucked a catch to dismiss for Smith for 21 in what proved a turning point in 
the Australia Day Twenty20 clash, which Australia lost by 37 runs.

The Indian star celebrated the wicket wildly, gesturing in a fashion that 
seemingly told Smith he should have focused on batting instead of talking. 
Smith was mic’d up at the time and had been conducting a live interview with 
Nine Network commentators during the over.

“I don’t think you need to do that kind of thing when someone gets out,” Smith 
told Fox Sports. “It’s fine to have a little bit of banter when you’re out in 
the field, but when someone’s out I don’t really think that’s on. He gets 
pretty emotional out there, doesn’t he?”

Kohli was involved in a handful of heated spats with Australia during India’s 
Test tour in 2014-15, while he and James Faulkner have often swapped barbs on 
the field this month. Smith won’t have a chance to renew the rivalry until the 
Twenty20 World Cup in March, with the skipper and vice-captain David Warner 
sitting out the remaining two T20 clashes.

Meanwhile, the 26-year-old dismissed the notion his on-pitch interview with 
Nine had anything to do with the dismissal. “It was on at the time but for me 
it was just a bad shot,” Smith said. “I tried to chip one over the top for two 
rather than trying to hit him for four or six. It was my fault and I’ve just 
got to be better next time.”

Australia face India at the MCG on Friday then the SCG on Sunday.
