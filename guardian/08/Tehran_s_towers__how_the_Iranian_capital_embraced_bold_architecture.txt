From its iconic Azadi (freedom) tower 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/gallery/2015/oct/07/german-artist-tehran-freedom-arch-pictures>
, which has ridden out a revolution, an eight-year war and innumerable protest 
rallies, to the elegant museum of contemporary art or the city theatre, Tehran 
has long been home to a brand of wacky, yet distinctively Iranian, contemporary 
buildings.

In the few decades leading up to the 1979 Islamic revolution, architects such 
as Houshang Seyhoun, Kamran Diba and Hossein Amanat pushed the boundaries of 
traditional Persian architecture by using traditional elements in modern 
designs; Amanat’s freedom tower epitomises those efforts.

After the revolution, however, the Iranian capital’s architectural scene 
suffered a serious blow as the country was consumed first by war then by 
postwar reconstruction. But more recently, with young architects educating 
themselves in worldwide trends, and the relative stability of the country 
compared to its post-revolutionary upheaval, a new generation are following in 
the footsteps of the veterans. The city has embraced a bold, experimental 
architecture.

Tehran in 2016 “is in a constant mood of reconstructing and rebuilding 
itself,” according to Mehran Gharleghi, director at London’sStudio Integrate 
<http://www.studiointegrate.com/about-us.html>, who has previously worked in 
Tehran for the prominent architecture firm Mirmiran. “The municipalities 
accommodate new designs, at least compared to Europe, and there’s a big 
appetite for new buildings.”

The truth about Tehran, by artist Nazgol Ansarinia: ‘It’s building a fantasy 
future’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2016/jun/07/tehran-iran-artist-nazgol-ansarinia-murals-bureau-beautification>
“Tehran has a unique structure,” he adds. “It is more dynamic than any 
European capital, and at the same time it’s not a typical Middle Eastern city. 
Its urban scene is quite chaotic at the first glance. But, similarly to cities 
like Tokyo, this means Tehran is constantly able to renew its visual identity.”

Tehran’s mayors are also influential. Former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was 
one. And the incumbent, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who has run eye-catching 
projects such asinstalling Picasso and Matisse billboards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/07/tehran-swaps-death-to-america-billboards-picasso-matisse-hockney-iran>
 on the city’s streets, has presidential ambitions himself – leading, says 
Ghaleghi, to “the motivation of Tehran’s mayor to commission ambitious projects 
and improve the urban set-up”.

Architects in Iran <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran> also enjoy a great 
deal of freedom. “Their hands are not tied,” says Kamran Rezaianpour, founder 
of the architecture firm Idehandish, which has offices in Tehran and Shiraz. 
“The mayor’s office won’t make obstacles; the main issue is to persuade the 
owner. In Tehran, the mayor’s office is mainly concerned with two issues: 
parking spaces and the height of buildings.”

Nor is the new architectural freedom limited to the capital. “In fact, in 
other cities, such as Isfahan, Shiraz, Mashhad and Tabriz, you’ll see more 
creative works than in Tehran,” Rezaianpour says. “In the past, there was a 
huge difference between the capital Tehran and big provincial cities in that 
regard, now this has been narrowed.”

Built in 2014 in Tehran’s affluent Darrous neighbourhood, the Sharifi-ha house 
is a seven-floor building with three rotating blocks that turn 90 degrees. Each 
block is on a rotating base that allows the owner, Farshad Sharifi, to change 
its direction at the push of a button. The house has a swimming pool, a gym and 
a cinema.

“The openness/closure of the building’s volume is a reference to traditional 
Iranian houses, which would dynamically serve as seasonal modes of habitation 
by offering both a Zemestan-Neshin (a winter living room) and Taabestan-Neshin 
(a summer living room) to their residents,” its lead architect from Next 
Office, Alireza Taghaboni,has written

Unveiled in 2014 by Tehran’s mayor, Tabiat (nature) bridge is a spectacular 
hi-tech structure designed by young architects Leila Araghian and Alireza 
Behzadi. Araghian was 26 when she designed the bridge, which took over two 
years to build and has since become a popular hangout for younger people and a 
site for morning sports. On public holidays, thousands flock there to picnic.


The bridge received a great deal of international attention after it was named 
last year among the winners of the Architizer A+ awards, a global competition 
based in New York. The 270m structure, which connects two parks in north 
Tehran, is built on three large pillars. It has multiple pathways and three 
floor of restaurants, cafes and seating areas. “I didn’t want it to be just a 
bridge that people would use to get from one park to another,” Araghiantold the 
Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/bridge-tehran-architect-iran-leila-araghian-tabiat-sanctions-iranian-designers>
 last year. “I wanted it to be a place for people to stay and ponder, not 
simply pass.”

Reza Daneshmir’s Pardis Mellat cinema is responsible in many ways for kicking 
off the new burst of creativity in the capital, and was one of the first 
projects to gain international recognition after the revolution. “It was 
commissioned by Tehran’s mayor and completed in 2008; the state sector 
continued to commission similar works later such as the Tabiat Bridge,” says 
Gharleghi.

The cinema is in the southern corner of Tehran’s popular Mellat park. One of 
its central features is a 57-metre arch with no supporting columns, and the 
building is designed as a place to hang out after watching films.

Mohammad-Reza Nikbakht’s residential building in Niavaran, north Tehran, built 
in 2013, was specifically designed to ensure no trees were cut down during its 
construction. “We’ve seen too many times in Tehran that 150-year-old or 
200-year-old trees are cut for creation of new flats,” he said. “In my project, 
we faced a total of 128 trees with an average age of 70 years.” The initial 
plan required around 40 trees to be cut, but Nikbakht redesigned and persuaded 
the municipality to preserve all of them.


“We tried to protect them by covering them up during the construction. One 
tree dried up and another caught fire – the rest remained intact,” Nikbakht 
says. The residential complex has two blocks and each have five floors. “After 
this project, many people have become conscious about preserving the trees and 
the authorities have also increased the cost of cutting trees for the purpose 
of constructing new houses or offices.”

The Orsi Khaneh, designed by the Keivani brothers, is a residential block of 
flats completed in September 2015 in Tehran’s middle-class Gisha neighbourhood. 
“One of our main concerns was how to bring our architectural values to today, 
our aim was to make our Iranian architecture up to date,” Nima Keivani says. 
“In this project, we used the concept of Orsi windows seen in Iranian houses in 
the city of Kashan and tried to use it in today’s architecture.”

The building has seven floors, five of which are apartments, and a garden on 
its roof. “We also used stained glass and used the six colours that have 
traditionally been seen in Iranian windows,” Keivani said.
