In 1818, the Foreign Secretary Lord Castlereagh sent a letter to all British 
consuls across the world, asking them to obtain examples of their local 
standard weights. At that time the UK had no universal conversion table between 
the many different systems of weights and measures used by foreign cities.

It took two years for all 71 sets of weights to arrive in London, where they 
were put in two cabinets installed in the Royal Mint. When the measurements 
were compared with each other, the Mint discovered that almost every previous 
conversion table was wrong – and that for the previous century these errors had 
been costing UK traders dosh.

Lord Castelreagh’s Consular Collection of Attested Foreign Standard Weights 
now stands in the Science Museum’s new mathematics gallery, which opens 
tomorrow in London. The cabinets make probably the most beautiful display in 
the collection. It has 71 numbered drawers, each with the name of a city from 
Alicant to Wismar. Some of the drawers are open, showing the shiny metal 
weights inside, and looking like it could be a Liberty’s Christmas window 
display.

Mathematics <https://www.theguardian.com/education/mathematics> underlies all 
science, so for a science museum to be worthy of the name, maths needs to 
included somewhere. Yet maths, which deals mainly in abstract objects, is 
challenge for museums, which necessarily contain physical ones. The Science 
Museum’s approach in its new gallery is to tell historical stories about the 
influence of mathematics in the real world, rather than actually focussing 
directly on the mathematical ideas involved. The result is a stunning gallery, 
with fascinating objects beautifully laid out, yet which eschews explaining any 
maths. (If you want to learn simple mathematical ideas, you can always head to 
the museum’s new interactive gallery, Wonderlab).

Much of the attention on Mathematics: The Winton Gallery – the main funders 
are David Harding, founder and CEO of investment firm Winton, and his wife 
Claudia – has been on Zaha Hadid’s design. The gallery is the first UK project 
by Zaha Hadid Architects to open since her unexpected death in March, and the 
only permanent public museum exhibition she designed. Her first degree was in 
maths, before she turned to architecture.

Hanging from the ceiling is an aeroplane – the Handley Page ‘Gugnunc’, built 
in 1929 for a competition to build safe aircraft – and surrounding it is a 
swirly ceiling sculpture that represents the mathematical equations that 
describe airflow. In fact, the entire gallery follows the contours of the flow, 
providing the positions of the cabinets below.

The Science Museum’s previous maths gallery, which had not been updated in 
decades, contained about 600 objects, including cabinets crammed with 
geometrical objects and many examples of the same thing, such as medieval slide 
rules or Victorian curve-drawing machines. The new gallery has less than a 
quarter of that number of objects in the same space.

Every object now is in its own cabinet, and the extra space means you can walk 
around them from all angles, as well as making the gallery feel more 
manageable. Rather than being bombarded with stuff, you are given a single 
object to contemplate that tells part of a wider story.

In a section on “form and beauty”, there is a modern replica of a 1920s chair 
based on French architect’s Le Corbusier’s Modulor system of proportions, and 
two J W Turner sketches from his Royal Academy lectures on perspective.

The section “trade and travel” has a 3-metre long replica of the 1973 Globtik 
Tokyo oil tanker, then the largest ship in the world. In its massive cabinet it 
looks as terrifying as a Damien Hirst shark. The maths link? Because British 
mathematician William Froode a century before had worked out that bulbous bows 
were better than sharp bows at the fronts of boats and ships.

I enjoyed the consular cabinet of foreign weights not just because it looked 
so beautiful but perhaps because of its wider message about how complicated the 
world is when no one agrees on anything. My other favourite exhibits were the 
1933 tote machine, which looked like a Heath Robinson contraption made out of 
Meccano, but was used at Wembley greyhound stadium for calculating the odds of 
the dogs in real time. And the 1952 Moniac, which modelled the British economy 
using the flow of water.

The new maths gallery is a wonderfully attractive space, full of interesting 
and thought-provoking objects, and a very welcome addition [geddit?] to 
London’s museums. Go!
