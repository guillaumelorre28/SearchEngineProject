My four year old both loves and fears Roald Dahl‚Äôs The Enormous Crocodile 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/enormous-crocodile-6.html>. Are there any 
other picture books about crocodiles which she might enjoy?

 Crocodiles are fascinating because they can look so dormant while remaining 
deadly. It‚Äôs pretty unusual ever to get the last laugh on one!

Few writers can better Roald Dahl‚Äôs incredible ability to evoke both fear and 
laughter in very young readers.The Enormous Crocodile 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/enormous-crocodile-6.html> is one of his most 
unredeemed characters in terms of his viciousness and in his directly stated 
threat to children. Having specified that for his lunch he ‚Äúwould like a nice 
juicy child‚Äù he goes on to extol the delights of eating children to his 
crocodile friend on the grounds that they are bigger than fish and so you get a 
better meal and that they are ‚Äújuicy and yummy‚Äù. And he has very sharp teeth 
which show how easily he could do exactly what he is threatening.

With his clever tricks, the Enormous Crocodile has many plans for catching a 
juicy child, including some nifty disguises. And he nearly, nearly does so! 
Luckily for any frightened child reader and the children in the story, 
Muggle-Wump the Monkey, the Roly Poly Bird, Humpy-Rumpy the hippopotamus and 
especially Trunky the elephant are all determined to stop the greedy creature ‚Äì 
and so they do but not before a lot of terror.

In Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs The Elephant‚Äôs Child 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/elephant-s-child.html>, the crocodile is 
similarly quick to use his very sharp teeth when the Elephant‚Äôs Child asks him 
the question he has already asked many other creatures living on the ‚Äúbanks of 
the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees‚Äù 
this question: ‚ÄúWill you please tell me what you have for dinner?‚Äù Having had 
painful answers from the Ostrich, the Giraffe, the Hippopotamus, the Baboon and 
the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, the foolish Elephant‚Äôs Child kneels right 
down on the bank when the Crocodile says, ‚ÄúCome hither, Little One, and I‚Äôll 
whisper.‚Äù In a flash, the Elephant‚Äôs Child is changed forever as his little 
boot-sized nose is clamped in the Crocodile‚Äôs ‚Äúmusky, tusky mouth‚Äù and he needs 
all his strength ‚Äì and all the help he can get from the other animals ‚Äì to pull 
and pull and pull until, at last, the crocodile let go.

That may not be really how the Elephant got his distinctive long trunk rather 
than a short nose like most creatures but it makes a good and warning story 
about a Crocodile.

There‚Äôs another example of a greedy and selfish crocodile in Faustin Charles‚Äôs 
The Selfish Crocodile <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/selfish-crocodile-3.html>
, illustrated by Michael Terry. In this moral story the Crocodile has spent his 
life terrorising all the other creatures of the forest such as the giraffe and 
the hippo and even the creatures in the river including the fish and the frogs. 
So frightened of the crocodile are they that even when they hear him shrieking 
in pain they don‚Äôt dare approach. Luckily one creature ‚Äì a tiny weeny mouse ‚Äì 
plucks up the courage to go and help. And maybe the crocodile has learnt his 
lesson!

When is a crocodile not a crocodile? In Gemma Merino‚Äôs highly entertaining The 
Crocodile who Didn‚Äôt Like Water 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/crocodile-who-didn-t-like-water.html> one 
loveable small croc turns out to be terrified of water. He‚Äôd much rather climb 
trees than go swimming. But being the odd one out is no fun so, bravely, he 
takes the plunge‚Ä¶ The resulting cold leads to a sneeze ‚Äì a very HOT sneeze - 
which shows that this crocodile may not be what he seems. In fact, he could be 
a dragon after all!

Domesticated crocodiles are few and far between but in Mark Sperring and Laure 
Ellen Anderson‚ÄôsSnappy Birthday 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/snappy-birthday.html> an invitation to a 
birthday party gets sent to one of the neighbours. His teeth, scales and big 
snout cause the other guests to wonder. They soon discover that birthday cake 
and jelly arenot what this guest likes best! 

Behind all these picture book crocodiles lurks the shadow of the tick-tock 
crocodile who so haunts Captain James Hook in JM Barrie‚Äôs classicPeter Pan 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/peter-pan-24.html>. Having developed a taste 
for Captain Hook after devouring the hand that Peter Pan had cut off, the 
crocodile is always on the search for more meat from the same source. Luckily, 
because he swallowed a clock, he can always be heard coming. All children and, 
above all, Captain Hook, will be suitably terrified when they hear his 
tick-tock coming.
