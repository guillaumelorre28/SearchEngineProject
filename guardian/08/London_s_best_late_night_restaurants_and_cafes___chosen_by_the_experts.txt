Voodoo Ray’s, Dalston

There are three important ingredients for successful late-night food: it needs 
to be quick, delicious and fun. No one wants to sit down for a six-course, 
white-tablecloth meal at 1.30am and pay attention to their table manners. You 
want something tasty and you want it fast. And you don’t want anyone telling 
you to stop laughing so loudly. Voodoo Ray’s lives up to this because it serves 
pizza by the slice, a post-midnight pizza special and a solid drinks list – as 
well playing excellent music. Inside white subway tiles and flickering neon 
lights rebound the always-incredible 
disco/dance/electro/better-music-than-most-nearby-clubs playlist. It never 
feels like it’s overrun by super-smashed vampire clubbers. It’s full of the 
usual Dalston crowd of overgrown tweens dressed like Full House extras, drag 
queens, off-duty witches, people who freelance for Vice and people in search of 
an amazing slice of pizza before, or after, heading out. They have 
far-above-average toppings such as fennel chilli sausage and bacon dust, and it 
named a pizza after Giorgio Moroder. That’s a pizza mic drop right there.

Spuntino, Soho
 Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer 
Spuntino has a grungy, Edward Hopper-ish quality that is perfect for night 
owls. Squatting in one of Soho’s still ungentrified corners, it doesn’t 
announce its presence with anything other than an understated number 61. You 
perch on stools round a central bar where cool, beautiful people knock up 
punchy cocktails and deliver food that’s perfect for the late-night reveller: 
sliders, delicate pizzette, perhaps the capital’s finest, fromage-iest macaroni 
cheese, oozing and bubbling in its cast iron skillet and laced with at least 
three different cheeses. Sophisticated versions of diner classics, with an 
occasional Italian accent is the house style. Despite being owned by the same 
people as the ever-expanding Polpo chain, Spuntino retains the air of a rackety 
insiders’ secret.

Bob Bob Ricard, Soho
 Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer 
It can be hard to find somewhere good to eat late at night in London. One of 
the reasons we opened Duck & Waffle as a 24-hour restaurant was to give people 
somewhere decent to go after hours – away from a nightclub or kebab shop. I 
love late-night dining at Bob Bob Ricard. It’s so elegant, chic and 
understated; inside are beautiful booths that are perfect for an intimate 
gathering but the restaurant doesn’t feel pretentious or stuffy. It also has 
“press for champagne” buttons in each booth – lethal when you’ve already had 
one too many. The menu has mainly Russian dishes but there are British and 
French influences too. One of my favourite things is the “iconic” steak 
tartare, which is made with foie gras and capers. I also like to get a couple 
of the smaller dishes, especially the oysters and lobster dumplings, and, of 
course, champagne. Eating there can get expensive but it doesn’t need to be; 
the house champagne isn’t going to bankrupt you but, compared with a kebab and 
a can of coke, it’s definitely a treat. Bob Bob Ricard is the kind of place you 
go on a whim but that’s the wonder of it.

Beigel Bake, Brick Lane
 Photograph: Alamy 
I’ve just had a kid, so it’s not often enough I find myself in the state, or 
the area, for Brick Lane’s Beigel Bake. But there have definitely been times 
I’ve been tempted to drive down after work and get something. It’s open 24 
hours a day and makes its own bagels. It’s comforting to know you can go there 
any time and get something to eat. It’s usually exactly what you’re looking for 
at that time: hot salt beef, loads of mustard and bread. Sometimes I go off 
piste and get a salmon and cream cheese … but it never hits the same spot. You 
get an eclectic mix of people in there. Sometimes it can be a bit scary, other 
times a good vibe. But the staff have a good way of dealing with people. You 
get a few people asking for money, so you might give them half your bagel. It’s 
never quiet or empty. That area has changed a lot over the years but hopefully, 
it’s got the strength to stand the test of time.

Meat Liquor, W1
 Photograph: Alamy 
I have a long history with Meat Liquor’s green chilli cheeseburger, having 
taken my first bite in a Peckham car park back in 2009, when the future 
restaurant was just a burger van. There was this guy inside (Yianni Papoutsis) 
going on about frying the chillies in butter and proportions of fat to meat; I 
knew then I was onto a good thing, and it’s still my favourite burger in 
London. If I’m in town, past midnight, then I’m inevitably drunk and it’s all I 
can think about. I head for theBond Street branch 
<http://meatliquor.com/london/>, a dark cavern of neon, graffiti, noise and 
meat-smoke. The burger arrives rustling in tissue paper, a frosty beer on the 
side. I’m no burger bore but there’s serious attention to detail here, and it 
shows. A glorious, messy fix.

Ranoush Juice, Marylebone


Sometimes, I want somewhere to go and hang after a bar or pub, or even the 
theatre (I’d love to add club but I fear those days are over). You’re most 
likely to find me eating in Ranoush Juice when I’m drunk, in town and hungry 
for good food. I was bought up in Paddington, just off the Edgware Road. From 
the age of 15, when I started going out, Ranoush Juice was the place my sister 
Cora and I would end up. Despite living in Hackney now, I’ve been known to 
pitstop there for a takeaway in the middle of the night on many occasions. It’s 
essentially a Middle Eastern/Lebanese shawarma bar, but the shawarma is great 
and the vibe is bouncing. The decor is stripped-back and very neon and 
metallic, but it’s filled with fruits for the juice and different Lebanese 
treats on the counter. I will always get a shawarma wrap, as it comes with 
extra garlic and chill sauce, but if I’m eating in I’ll get loads of small 
plates. I love the hummus with lamb shawarma, the chicken livers and 
pomegranate, thesoujek spicy sausages and a fatoush salad.

Lanzhou Noodle Bar, Covent Garden

What I want from a late-night eat is something that is tasty, fast … but not 
too guilty. From the outside, Lanzhou Noodle Bar looks like any Chinese buffet 
restaurant, but if you look just behind you will see someone hand-pulling 
lamian noodles. Stretching and teasing huge lumps of dough in the air. Terrific 
bouncy Chinese noodles that you can have in a variety of ways. I have mine dry 
with Fujian peanut sauce. Inside, it’s basic, brusque and lively. Shared 
tables. Everyone focussed on their food and eating speedily. It feels like 
wandering into China. Lanzhou is all about the food. It is fast and delicious 
and very affordable. If I’m on my way home from somewhere and I need to fill a 
hole in my soul and/or my belly, this is where I’ll be.

Duck & Waffle, the City

My one problem with the (understandable) extreme popularity of Duck & Waffle 
with the post-pub crowd is that the atmosphere can get a bit raucous. But then 
sometimes the annoying loud drunk is on the next table, and sometimes it’s me, 
so it all works out in the end. And anyway, I’d suffer many a braying account 
manager (and a truly terrifyingly fast lift) for that view: breathtaking at any 
time of day, but taking on a particular drama at sunset and sunrise when 
London’s skyline is framed by horizontal rays. Paper bags of barbecued pig’s 
ears and foie gras crème brulee just add to the otherworldliness of it all.

Palmera Oasis, Canonbury

If I’m running late or rushing home and need a bite of something I can trust, 
I always descend on Palmera Oasis on Essex Road. I used to live around the 
corner and for a while it became a bit of a problem for me. I found myself 
eating the lamb shawrma way more than I should have. On the outside it’s like 
so many other kebab shops in London, but the one thing that keeps me heading 
back is what is possibly the most delicious tahini sauce known to man. If, on 
the rare occasion that I am out and in a more central location, I will always 
go toShochu Lounge <https://www.rokarestaurant.com/home-shochu-lounge> under 
ROKA on Charlotte Street. The food is superb, its central and the cocktails are 
killer.

Upatairs at Ronnie Scott’s

After leaving work for the night, I often find myself sinking into a seat in 
the dimly lit basement of Ronnie Scott’s. For those in need of a quality, 
late-night food menu, look no further than Upstairs @Ronnies which operates as 
a separate venue with its own live music programme. Choose from a variety of 
small and large plates and dine in a venue with the perfect ambience. Combined 
with the excellent service from the immaculately dressed waiters, it’s no 
wonder it is adored by Londoners. Listening to Ray Gelato with a martini in 
hand transports me straight to the 1950s; I find it hard to make it out before 
midnight.

Tayyabs, Whitechapel
 Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian 
In LA, you can hit up a food truck for some fine tacos after partying. In New 
York, you can hit up tons of places for awesome pizza or a bowl of banging 
noodles. In France, it’s escargots, every time. London’s food scene is up 
there, but we’ve a long way to go when it comes to late-night eats. But maybe 
not that long now, though, as wine “don” Charlie Mellor will be openingthe 
Laughing Heart <https://www.facebook.com/thelaughingheartlondon/> later this 
month. It will be a wine bar, dining room and off-licence on Hackney Road.

. Last orders? 1am. Booze until 2am. Sounds like the dream come true. Until 
then, there’s Tayyabs. I’m a Tayyabs girl. Its Peshwari naan, lamb chops and 
dry meat hit the spot every time – especially after a few beers, which is why 
it’s brilliant that the kitchen does last orders at 11.30pm. Because of the 
whole sharing plates thing, and the size of the restaurant (it’s massive), it 
lends itself to big groups, another plus when you’ve been out with friends and 
need to soak up some juice. Then there’s the mood lighting: no bright canteen 
lights here, it’s all dark and vibe-y so you don’t need to feel too aware of 
your slightly flushed cheeks. Order the Pista Kulfi on the way out, it’s pretty 
much the perfect to-go dessert – as you’ll probably want to have a walk around 
the block!

Dosa n Chutny and Lahore Karahi, Tooting
 Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian 
My favourite pitstop for south Indian dosa is Dosa n Chutny, where the 
perfectly cooked rice pancakes are packed with spicy potatoes or chicken or 
lamb masala and served with fabulous fresh coconut chutney. The veggie options 
are less than £4, the meat ones under £5. But it closes at 11pm, so if you miss 
that go grab yourself a pile of lamb chops or a seekh kebab (minced lamb with 
fried onion and capsicum) from the hugely popular Lahore Karahi nearby, which 
many say serves some of the best Pakistani food in London.
