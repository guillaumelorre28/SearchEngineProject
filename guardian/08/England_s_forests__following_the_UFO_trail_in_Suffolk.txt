If you want to look for something really unusual in the sky – day or night – a 
trip toRendlesham Forest <http://www.forestry.gov.uk/rendlesham> in Suffolk 
might just inspire you. This was the scene of "Britain's Roswell incident", a 
legendary UFO sighting – and possible landing – in December 1980.

A number of US Air Force personnel stationed at nearby RAF Woodbridge reported 
some very curious sightings over a two or three-day period. Alerted by 
mysterious lights in the forest, some servicemen claimed that they had seen – 
and even touched – an alien spacecraft.

The incident has sparked more correspondence with government officials than 
any other British UFO sighting

 – not to mention regular pilgrimages to the forest by avid amateur ufologists.

In honour of this, the Forestry Commission has created a three-mile UFO Trail 
<http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/EnglandEastAngliaNoForestRendleshamWoodRendleshamForestCentreUFOTrail>
 that children of all ages can enjoy.

Graded easy, it includes some strange alien-looking symbols on marker posts to 
spot, and a unidentified message to decode using the Alien Trail leaflet.

To avoid any disappointed children (or adults), however, we should just point 
out that the walk contains no visible evidence that any aliens ever visited 
Rendlesham Forest.

But that doesn't stop the conspiracy theorists speculating that there was a 
huge cover-up by both British and United States governments…
