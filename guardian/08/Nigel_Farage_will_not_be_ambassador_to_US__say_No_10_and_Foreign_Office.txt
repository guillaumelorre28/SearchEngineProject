Downing Street and the Foreign Office have brushed off a suggestion from the 
US president-elect,Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, that Nigel Farage would be a 
good ambassador to Washington, as MPs said the interim Ukip leader’s 
inflammatory views made him a poor candidate for a diplomatic post.

No 10 declined to criticise Trump’s call for Farage to become the ambassador 
and stressed that it was “important to reiterate that the UK already has an 
incredibly strong and enduring relationship with the United States”.

The prime minister’s spokesman said: “As far as the ambassador goes, there is 
no vacancy for that position. We have an excellent ambassador to the United 
States and he will continue his work.”

Overnight, Trump tweeted that Farage’s appointment would be a popular choice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/22/nigel-farage-uk-ambassador-us-donald-trump>
, an unprecedented comment from an incoming US president in suggesting a 
foreign appointment to another world leader, especially given Farage’s 
opposition to the government.

Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage <https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage> 
represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a 
great job!

prestigious in the diplomatic service.

Both Downing Street and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, took pains to 
praise Darroch’s tenure in Washington in their responses to Trump’s tweet.

Speaking in the House of Commons, Johnson said Darroch was a “a first rate 
ambassador in Washington doing a very good job with the current administration 
and the administration to be, and there is no vacancy”.
Johnson said the UK hoped to be influential as Trump took the reins at the 
White House. “I do think it is very important that on all sides of this House 
we should be as positive as we possibly can be about working with the incoming 
US administration,” he said.

“It is of massive importance to our country and indeed to the world. And I 
suggest to the honourable member that he should judge that new administration 
by their actions in office which, of course, we hope to shape and influence.”

Fellow Conservative MP Dan Poulter asked Johnson to stress that those with a 
character such as Farage’s would not make good ambassadors.

 “Diplomats require diplomacy,” he told the Commons. “There should be no place 
for anyone who expresses inflammatory and what sometimes can be considered to 
be borderline racist views in representing this country in discussions with the 
United States.”

Johnson said he thought Poulter “captures the mood of the House” on the issue, 
adding: “We have already settled that question, there is no vacancy.”

UK government must ‘mend fences’ with Donald Trump, says Nigel Farage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/14/uk-government-must-mend-fences-with-donald-trump-says-nigel-farage-video>
In Brussels, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said he believed Darroch would 
be in place for the foreseeable future. “We are believers in free speech in 
Britain, but we have got a very good ambassador Kim Darroch who is going to be 
there for some years,” he told the BBC.

“People can say what they like. The simple truth is there is no vacancy. The 
ambassador there is very, very good. And he will be there for years.”

Sir Christopher Meyer, a former UK ambassador to Washington, tweeted on 
Tuesday morning that it was not for foreign leaders to suggest candidates for 
diplomatic posts.

UK ambo in DC exists to defend UK interests in US, not US interests in UK. 
Can't have foreign presidents deciding who our ambo should be.

Earlier, Farage said he had not been expecting Trump’s tweet, but said it was 
a signal that Downing Street needed to change its thinking.


“I can still scarcely believe that he did that, though speaking to a couple of 
his longtime friends perhaps I am a little less surprised,” he wrote in an 
piece on Tuesday morning for rightwing US site Breitbart.

“They all say the same thing: that Trump is a very loyal man and supports 
those that stand by him.”

Farage, who recently suggested he could mount an eighth attempt to become an 
MP after failing seven times, said personal relationships were key to how Trump 
operated. “Sadly, the cesspit that is career politics understands nothing of 
this,” he said. “In their world, the concept of trust is transitory.”

The Ukip leader has previously said it was “obvious” that Darroch should 
resign, calling him part of the “old regime”.

Though Farage admitted he did not necessarily have the personal qualities for 
a diplomatic position, one ally of Ukip’s interim leader suggested Theresa May 
could solve a political problem for her party by appointing him, saying it 
would be an effective way of ending Ukip as a force in British politics.

Farage, the first foreign politician to meet Trump after the Republican 
candidate’s shock victory, is expecting an invitation to Trump’s inauguration 
in January, sources havetold the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/20/nigel-farage-invitation-donald-trump-inauguration>
.

Having campaigned together during the election, Trump and Farage met recently 
at Trump Tower in New York, where the president-elect is said to have 
encouraged Farage to oppose wind farms, which he felt marred the views fromhis 
Scottish golf courses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-scotland-golf-course-resort-losses>
.

Andy Wigmore, a communications officer for one of the groups campaigning to 
leave the EU who was at the meeting alongside Farage, told theDaily Express 
<http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/734195/Donald-trump-Nigel-Farage-Scottish-wind-farms>
: “We covered a lot of ground during the hour-long meeting we had.


“But one thing Mr Trump kept returning to was the issue of wind farms. He is a 
complete Anglophile and also absolutely adores Scotland, which he thinks is one 
of the most beautiful places on Earth. But he is dismayed that his beloved 
Scotland has become overrun with ugly wind farms, which he believes are a 
blight on the stunning landscape.”
