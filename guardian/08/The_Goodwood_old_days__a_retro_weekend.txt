The 21st century is already so last week. My friend Kate and I have unplugged 
ourselves from the present for the weekend and are driving down toGoodwood Hotel
 <http://www.goodwood.co.uk/the-goodwood-hotel/the-goodwood-hotel.aspx>in 
Sussex. With the top down on the car, we’re attempting the 
headscarf-and-sunglasses trick thatGrace Kelly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/11/grace-kelly-grace-of-monaco-film-nicole-kidman-controversy>
 made look so effortlessly chic. It is not, perhaps, so elegant on the M25, but 
no matter – we’re soon pootling through leafy countryside and once we arrive at 
our destination, glamour will be our watchword.

We have booked the hotel’s Vintage Treasures package 
<http://www.goodwood.co.uk/experiences/experiences/vintagetreasures.aspx> – 
which means that we will be ditching our jeans for a retro makeover, borrowing 
a dress from Goodwood’s archive and having our hair and makeup primped to 
match. It’s a dressing-up party for adults, and it’s in the perfect location.

Each September, the Goodwood motor racing circuit takes a step back into its 
own golden age, from 1948 to 1966, when it was one of the country’s foremost 
racing venues. At theGoodwood Revival (12-14 September) 
<http://grrc.goodwood.com/section/goodwood-revival/>, vintage cars and 
motorcycles speed around the track, and visitors are encouraged to look the 
part, too. If you don’t have a classic Mary Quant mini or full-skirted New Look 
gown lurking in your wardrobe, there are market stalls and pop-up shops where 
you can find the necessary gladrags – and salons where experts will set your 
hair and paint your nails.

The Goodwood Hotel’s vintage package is designed for those fashionistas who 
can’t wait for September to come around. Including dress hire, makeover, 
champagne afternoon tea and dinner, it would make for a decadent hen party – 
but Kate and I are just here for a break from 2014.

Judging by the number of enamelled Goodwood racing badges pinned to the tweed 
jackets of gentlemen rustling their Daily Telegraphs in the bar, we’re not the 
only ones who yearn for past glories. And this hotel is all about heritage – 
from the 17th-century fireplace in the aforementioned bar to the sleek art 
deco-inspired models of twin-propeller planes that decorate our room.

In fact, whether or not you’re into history, or racing, it’s worth making time 
to explore before getting dressed up. Goodwood House, home to theDuke and 
Duchess of Richmond 
<http://www.goodwood.co.uk/goodwood-house/the-history/the-family-the-beginnings.aspx>
, is open to visitors, and use of the hotel’s health club and pool is included 
in the package.

An occasional buzz in the air reminds us how close the aerodrome and racing 
circuit are – and the sight of a vintage plane overhead helps to roll back the 
years. Warbirds and Spitfires are a regular sight over Goodwood, we’re told, 
and even if you’re not watching the skies, the art deco airfield and racetrack 
is a must-see.

It’s over at the airfield, in fact, that Goodwood’s wardrobe is stored, under 
the supervision of costume curator Sue O’Donoghue, who provides outfits for the 
in-house theatre company, and for special events including the Goodwood 
Revival. The collection runs to thousands of items, from a few genuine 
Edwardian summer dresses to shelves bursting with hats, handbags and sunglasses.

We were asked to submit our size and era preferences (1940s, 1950s or 1960s) 
before arriving, so a rail of choices could be sent to our room. Kate tries on 
a floral shift with a bow on the bust. Worn with a gorgeous 1950s swing coat in 
bottle green with a deep pink lining, it’s suddenly very chic, perfect for a 
posh garden party. I pounce on a 1960s geometric print frock in indestructible 
polyester that swings like the very decade itself. Though it’s 50 years old I 
would pick it out of a shop window any day of the week. A soft caramel-colour 
leather trenchcoat on top adds an enjoyably sleazy Soho vibe. I’d better be on 
my best behaviour for afternoon tea.

(A word to the wise: the hotel quite rightly recommends that you bring your 
own footwear; vintage shoes can be delicate and not suitable for jaunting about 
in.)

Before we are fit to be seen, our hotel room is converted into a temporary 
salon. A trio of beauticians arrives to add the finishing touches: hair, 
make-up, nails and a glass of chilled elderflower fizz. Kate’s hair is 
backcombed into a plumptious beehive, while mine is tucked into a neat little 
quiff, and we are both given eyeliner flicks that Amy Winehouse would have 
coveted.

Sartorially, no one can deny we have made the effort for our afternoon tea, 
though I suspect we raise a few greying eyebrows with our vintage get-up. 
Luckily the coronation chicken and cucumber sandwiches are as old-school as our 
outfits at theKennels Club <http://www.goodwood.co.uk/kennels/kennels.aspx>, 
where we take our Earl Grey in squashy leather armchairs in the library. There 
is champagne too, and we particularly enjoy the fruit scones with jam and 
cream. The shelves are heavy with cricketing almanacs and the memoirs of 
renowned sportsmen, while the chatter around us is of classic cars and hefty 
sums in foreign currencies.

Grand as it is, this is the social club for the estate’s sporting activities. 
When it was first built, in 1787, it was home to the Duke of Richmond’s hunting 
dogs, but since 1914 it has extended its welcome to the golfers of Goodwood 
instead (there are two golf courses here) – whose needs are catered for in 
style by two dining rooms, comfortable changing areas, and a club shop that 
sells Ralph Lauren gear. There’s even a valet to take care of your shoes while 
you’re out on the course. We bump into a large group of female golfers in 
matching polo shirts who seem pleased as punch with the combination of links 
and luxe on offer.

And as we blot the last cake crumbs on our tea plates, we happily realise we 
are ladies of leisure until our next appointment – dinner at the hotel’s 
restaurant, theRichmond Arms 
<http://www.goodwood.co.uk/eating-and-drinking/the-richmond-arms/the-richmond-arms.aspx>
, so there’s plenty of time to order another glass of bubbly, read and relax. 
It’s a smart establishment serving dishes in which our vintage alter egos 
recognise a modern flourish – the chips that accompany the steak are two inches 
thick and stacked Jenga-style on the plate. We feast happily there, smiling 
most on a silky soufflé (made with cheese and milk from the Goodwood home farm) 
and a slice of local mackerel, smoked and served with yoghurt and bergamot.

In the morning we’ll comb out our hair, hand back the dresses and return to 
the modern world, but we’ll linger a little longer in the 1960s yet.
