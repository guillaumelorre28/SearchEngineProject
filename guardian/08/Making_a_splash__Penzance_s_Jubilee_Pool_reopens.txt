When you think of Cornish landmarks, a 1930s cubist-inspired lido is probably 
not the first thing that springs to mind. But judging by the crowds of locals 
and intrigued bank holiday visitors who turned up to thereopening of Penzance’s 
Jubilee Pool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2016/may/28/penzance-lido-pontypridd-lido-reopen-in-pictures>
 on Saturday, it could soon be added to the list of the county’s well-known 
attractions.

Jutting out from the town’s harbour into the sea, the triangular engineering 
of the pool – designed by Captain F Latham, the borough engineer – sought to 
streamline its outline and offer the best chance of surviving the brutal 
south-westerly storms that batter the Cornish coast in winter.

The design proved fit for purpose for decades until the freak winter storms of 
2014, when the waves breached the walls and twisted railings, and demolished 
changing rooms and terraces, while exposing the granite that lay beneath the 
pool.

The community and local government rallied around the cherished bathing spot 
and government finance for the £2.94m in essential restoration work came via the
Coastal Communities Fund <https://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/ccf>, as well as a 
mix of local government bodies and groups. Work has included securing the pool 
platform to the bedrock with rock anchors, stabilising and repairing changing 
rooms, paving and handrails, as well as upgrading the drainage.

It’s ​communal, and generations of local people have learned to swim here, 
have fun here, and have even dated here
Martin Nixon, Friends of the Jubilee Pool community group 
One of the reasons so many people have gone to so much trouble to ensure the 
lido’s survival is that it is one of only a handful of saltwater tidal pools 
left in Europe.

“When it was built in 1935, to commemorate King George V’s silver jubilee, the 
council wanted to put Penzance on the map by building a state-of-the-art 
facility, which people would want to use,” says Martin Nixon, head of the 
Friends of the Jubilee Pool community group.

The 1930s was a golden age for lidos in the UK, as outdoor swimming became a 
national obsession. The pool’s appeal suffered a blow in the 1970s when package 
holidays began to offer a much warmer alternative, and by the early 1990s it 
had become neglected enough for the council to consider whether further 
investment was viable.

But on this overcast May bank holiday weekend, you would be forgiven for 
thinking that the obsession has never gone away. People were queuing patiently 
along the harbour wall to get their first glimpse of the pool’s substantial 
makeover, and there was a buzz around the town as young and old flocked with 
beach bags and towels towards their revamped harbourside pool.

But why were people queuing, when just miles away there are some of the best 
beaches in the country?

“This has always been Penzance’s concrete beach and there’s a massive local 
affection for what it represents,” says Nixon. “It’s got a different vibe from 
a beach, it’s communal, and generations of local people have learned to swim 
here, have fun here, and even dated here. It’s a social melting pot that you 
just don’t get at the beach.”

That melting pot ideal was apparent from the unexpected acoustics of the 
architecture, which mixed yelps of wetsuited youths jumping into chilly waters 
with the hum of hardier generations braving the pool in just trunks and 
swimming costumes. Bigger groups chatted over picnics on the terraces and by 
the licensed poolside cafe, which offers snacks and full meals.

The plan is to make good use of these acoustics by covering the children’s 
pool with a temporary platform on summer evenings, and turning it into a mini 
amphitheatre for local bands. As well as concerts and gigs, stand-up 
paddleboard lessons are being trialled as another way to make use of the 
location and generate income. All of which, the lido’s guardians hope, will 
ensure that the Jubilee Pool never goes out of style again.
