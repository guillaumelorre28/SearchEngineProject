to try to form and head another government.

With his Fine Gael party expected to lose close to 30 seats, the taoiseach 
said on Saturday night that he still has the responsibility “to provide the 
country with a stable government in the future and I will consider that very 
carefully over the next 36 hours”.

Fine Gael came into the general election with 73 seats and, with the Irish 
Labour party, had commanded the biggest majority in Irish political history. 
Kenny said he would not step down as party leader despite presiding over the 
huge drop in support from this historic high.


He accepted that the government’s losses meant there was no chance of the 
coalition being returned to power. “The option of a majority government is 
gone, the option of a Fine Gael/Labour government is gone … so I need to know 
the results of all the parties before I decide what is the best thing to do 
given my duty and responsibility as taoiseach and head of government,” he said.

As Kenny considers his options Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael’s historic rivals from 
the Irish civil war onwards, was celebrating a stunning electoral comeback from 
its unprecedented hammering in the 2011 general election.

On course to win up to 46 seats, Fianna Fáil sources told the Guardian that it 
would not be entering any “grand coalition” with Fine Gael  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/27/ireland-election-likely-hung-parliament-talk-grand-coalition>
as part of a unity government that would bury civil war politics forever. “It 
would be madness to hand over the mantle of opposition to Sinn Féin,” one 
Fianna Fáil source said.

Earlier Sinn Féin <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sinn-fein> 
vice-president, Mary Lou McDonald, who topped the poll in Dublin Central with 
more than 5,000 votes, described the prospect of a Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil 
coalition as “the stuff of nightmares”.

 The prospect of Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil coalition divides opinion 
Sinn Féin is on its way to its best ever performance in the Irish Republic and 
will probably come out with more than 20 seats. Gerry Adams has once again 
topped the poll in the border constituency of Louth and may return to the Dáil 
with his running mate Imelda Munster.

With counting across the Republic expected to go on for several days, there 
will be little time to spare between the formation of a new government and the 
set-piece events of St Patrick’s Day as well as Easter Sunday 2016, when the 
country remembers the centenary of the Easter Rising against British rule.


The Irish Labour party suffered a similar fate to the Liberal Democrats in the 
UK last May, when the Westminster coalition’s junior partner bore the brunt of 
voters’ feelings of betrayal. Irish Labour had 33 seats going into the election 
and will be fortunate to return with 10. Its embattled leader, Joan Burton, 
managed to hold her seat in Dublin West, however, despite earlier predictions 
she would lose it.


Burton’s predecessor and the former deputy prime minister, Eamon Gilmore, said 
the party had been prepared to take hard decisions during its time in office.


Gilmore added: “I think most people try to make decisions and get elected at 
the same time. But there are occasions when you have to make the choice between 
doing the right thing and the popular thing. Our country was broke … We knew we 
had to take a risk.

“The country was facing an existential crisis at that time. It had to be fixed 
and it was. We could have ended up with a second bailout. We could have faced a 
situation like Greece.”

Independents and leftwing parties have performed strongly while the Green 
party has enjoyed a mini-resurrection. The Greens were reduced to zero seats in 
2011 but have, against expectations, come back into the Dáil with two seats.


The smaller parties and the independents may yet play roles as kingmakers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/20/irish-elections-dail-enda-kenny-easter-1916>
 if the two biggest parties make overtures to them. But the only thing certain 
about the 32nd Dáil is that it will be highly unstable and unlikely to last 
more than two years.
