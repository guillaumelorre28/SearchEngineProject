Ali Mbengu, 22, died last Friday when his boat capsized, his coach, Pateh 
Nying, said, as the country’s wrestling federation begged young people to think 
twice before making the perilous crossing.

Wrestling <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wrestling> is hugely popular in 
the Gambia and in neighbouring Senegal, where bouts steeped in traditional 
rituals are watched by hundreds of spectators.

Nying recounted how the wrestler, also known as “Mille Franc” (Thousand 
Franc), had left forLibya <https://www.theguardian.com/world/libya> in 2014. 
Many migrants get stuck in the unstable north African nation, working to pay 
off debts before finally setting sail. “His plan was to cross to Italy by 
boat,” Nying said.

“One of the survivors called his brother and informed him about the incident. 
The caller told the brother that only 10 people survived when the boat capsized 
on the high seas.”

Mille Franc is said to have made his debut in early 2012, for Club Serrekunda 
Gome Saboppa, in the outskirts of the Gambia’s capital, Banjul.

A spokesman for the Gambia Wrestling Federation, Matarr Saine, spoke of the 
grief of the whole wrestling community. “He was one of the most disciplined 
wrestlers in the country and he was really committed to the sport,” Saine said.

Some of the country’s top wrestlers have resettled in Europe after boarding 
makeshift boats from Libya to Italy.
