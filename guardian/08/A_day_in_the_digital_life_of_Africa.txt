next five years.

But how are phones and the internet changing the lives of ordinary Africans? 
And what barriers do people still come up against when trying to connect?


From the 70-year-old farmer in Zimbabwe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe> who can finally get an accurate 
weather forecast on her phone, to the Nigerian radio presenter who met her 
husband on Twitter, this is what a day in the digital life looks like for 10 
people across the continent.

Every morning I check Instagram and Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/04/africa-twitter-predictions-2016-hashtags-bringbackourgirls>
 to catch up on what happened when I was sleeping. People are incredibly quick 
to create andpost memes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jun/08/the-month-in-memes-viral-comedy-june-2016>
 in Nigeria these days – they might be silly and not entirely accurate but they 
give you the general gist.


Then I move on to international news sources including CNN and the BBC to get 
the actual facts. During political periods, I start with local news sites 
including Sahara Reporters and Punch NG before The Midday Show With Toolz, my 
daily show which airs onThe Beat 99.9FM <http://www.thebeat99.com/>.

I own three phones, an iPad and an iPad mini, and I am online at least once 
every 15-30 minutes.

As a public figure in Nigeria, social media is essential for promoting your 
brand: to share good news, bad news, opinions, air grievances and connect with 
fans, I often host Q&A sessions on Twitter using the hashtag#AskToolz 
<https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AskToolz&src=typd>.

 ‘The dream is to roll out to churches across Africa and Latin America.’ 
Photograph: Daniel Mitchell/EQ Images 
I am online all day, Monday to Friday. First I check my emails then I read an 
online devotional, check my calendar, host standups with my team at Asoriba, 
respond to emails, work on the product and respond to more emails.

We founded the Asoriba app <https://www.asoriba.com/> in 2015 to connect 
Christians with the word of God via the one thing most Africans own: a mobile 
phone, whether smart or dumb.

Every morning before getting out of bed, church members can read tailor-made 
devotions from their pastor, catch up on sermons they may have missed and 
scroll through the events being hosted at their church or others nearby.


The congregation, in turn, can support the church financially using mobile 
money, or credit cards. Churches can also use the app to store the details of 
their congregations.

The amount of innovation in our country is astounding, but most of the 
investment has come from foreigners, not from Ghanaian investors or our 
government. Tech can be a major source for revenue for our country but we need 
to own it.

Mobile phones were invaluable the night 276 girls were kidnapped from our town 
by Boko Haram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/family-nigerian-schoolgirl-escaped-boko-haram-bring-back-our-girls>
. As terrorists descended on Chibok’s secondary school our neighbours were 
frantically ringing us to warn that we were under attack.

We didn’t hear them at first because our generator was making too much noise, 
but my husbandgot up to switch it off 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/the-night-boko-haram-kidnapped-our-girls-a-chibok-resident-remembers>
 and saw the missed calls: our neighbours had fled to a nearby mountain.

Sometimes the network is so poor that WhatsApp messages linger for hours 
without sending

We sent texts and Facebook messages to our family and friends asking them to 
pray with us as we planned our escape and my husband made calls to help 
navigate our path to safety.

The importance of technology in times of such emergency, especially mobile 
phones, can never be overemphasised. Our neighbours now make sure their phones 
are always charged and that they have adequate backup power supplies.

Technology, boosted by mobile connectivity, is spreading like wildfire through 
north-east Nigeria, a region still under siege from Boko Haram.

It’s popular with everyone, young and old, and now at least one home in every 
remote village has a mobile phone. Even if they can’t text [due to high 
illiteracy rates] they can make calls, very important for emergencies.

But we still have many challenges getting online, sometimes the network is so 
poor that WhatsApp messages linger for hours without sending and a shortage of 
power means that we can’t always charge our laptops.

Most girls in my village get to use their first mobile phone at seven years 
old. We share two in my house but we don’t have access to the internet, I have 
to wait for code club,run by Theirworld <http://www.theirworld.org/>, at school 
for that.


I have enjoyed learning about computers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/22/computing-bcs-uk-computing-curriculum>
 and all the ways in which they can help us. When we don’t understand our 
homework we can use Google to get the answer. I also like playing games online.

I think that computers may also be able to help me tell stories and sing 
songs, particularly gospel music. I want people to hear about life at the 
Kibera girls’ school and how I am unique in my own way.

It’s very important that we are given this level of education, in some 
communities they don’t even allow the girls to speak, only the boys and men.

We used to rely on traditional knowledge to predict the weather. We’d feel the 
zephyr, the breeze, and know what the weather forecast would be the following 
day. We’d check the stars, and the size and colour of the moon and know whether 
the coming season would bring enough rains.


Some farmers still rely on this, but we also have our mobiles to read the 
weather forecasts from the national meteorology service. Almost every 
farmerhere in the Matabeleland region, south-west Zimbabwe, has a mobile phone 
but the network coverage can be patchy and expensive.

The local mobile network, NetOne, is not very reliable and we often need to 
walk long distances of about 3.5km (2 miles) to get it to work.


When we find signal we use a pin code, *130*1#, and download the most 
up-to-date forecast. It costs $0.20 a session.

Knowledge about the weather has never been more important. Last year we 
experienced terrible heatwaves that completely dried out the underground water 
table. We also need to be prepared for the cold, which can ruin crops too.

In Ethiopia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ethiopia> rates of internet 
connectivity are very low and crackdowns on freedom of speech are very common.

In April 2014 I was jailed for 18 months with eight of my friends for blogging 
about the government.

We had launched Zone 9 <http://zoneniners.com/> two years earlier to start a 
discussion about social and civic issues in our country, but we were arrested 
and charged with terrorism.

After a lengthy battle the charges were dropped and we were released, but I am 
now fighting accusations that I was “inciting violence” through my writing.

As well as a “Zoneniner”, I am an author and an editor of a bimonthly magazine 
called Weyeyet, meaning dialogue in Amharic, which focuses on political issues. 
I have no plans to stop being critical of the government.

I use Gmail, Facebook and Twitter daily, and other sites including Viber and 
Instagram occasionally. Facebook and Twitter help me promote my cause, 
democracy, and to campaign on the issues that are most important to me.

The arrival of Facebook has got people in Ethiopia interested in the internet. 
Maybe that’s a good thing, but the government is always watching.

I live on social media because government censorship prevents me from being 
anywhere else.

My cartoons, or Khartoons as they are known 
<https://www.facebook.com/KhalidAlbaih/>, are political and often critical of 
the Sudanese government. I started sharing them on the social network Hi5 before
the Arab spring 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/15/arab-spring-badly-wrong-five-years-on-people-power>
 but then migrated to Facebook when it found an audience in Sudan.

The concept of traditional media doesn’t exist in Sudan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan>, it is so biased and politically 
driven. I was once thrown out of an editor’s office for suggesting an idea, but 
on Facebook I can upload something and reach thousands in seconds.

But there is no sense of copyright, my art is shared and reposted across 
Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp quickly. Sometimes my name is cropped out, but I 
don’t mind because I’m doing it for the message. I now live in Qatar where I 
feel relatively safe doing my work.

Sudan is one of the most oppressive countries in the world 
<https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/worst-worst-2012-worlds-most-repressive-societies>
 and while opposition groups, including theyouth activists Girifna 
<https://twitter.com/girifna?lang=en-gb>, are very active online the government 
has mobilised an online defence force whose sole purpose is to troll them and 
spread pro-government propaganda.

They call themselves the “electronic mujahideen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/15/sudan-whatsapp-sharing-revolution>
”, we call them electronic chickens.

The majority of Sudanese people have bypassed computers completely, going from 
nothing to using the internet on their mobile phones. And there has been an 
explosion of information being pinged around on WhatsApp in the past year.

But with the deluge of comments, photos and articles it is become increasingly 
difficult to ascertain what is true and what is false.

If there are doubts raised about whether the president’s brother married a 
third wife, then how do we know that a report about a massacre in Darfur is 
true? We are embroiled in a rumour war, fuelled by the absence of free speech.

I fled the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2000 and now live in the 
Bwagiriza refugee camp in neighbouring Burundi.

My mobile phone is very useful to my daily life in the camp. It helps keep me 
informed with what’s happening in the outside world and communicate with my 
family and friends.

The people who run businesses use them to order in supplies from the nearby 
city of Ruyigi.

Most people use SMS messages and Facebook to communicate – I also like 
WhatsApp – but we don’t always have enough credit and the network coverage is 
patchy.

The only stable internet comes through the IdeasBox programme 
<http://www.librarieswithoutborders.org/index.php/news-and-events/lwb-news/item/322-impact-study-of-the-ideas-box-on-education>
 run by the International Rescue Committee and Bibliothèques Sans Frontières. 
It’s a portable station equipped with laptops, iPads and video cameras.

It is very popular with people in the camp, but when it goes, so does our 
connection to the outside world.

 Twitter and Facebook are Winfred Ongom’s favourite sites. Photograph: Winfred

The first thing I do every morning is check my email, then Facebook followed 
by Twitter then WhatsApp. Twitter and Facebook are my favourite mainly because 
the audience is big – it’s very popular inUganda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/uganda> and relatively cheap.

The best thing about social media is that it helps me reach a lot of people 
from all walks of life in one go.

Aside from keeping in touch with friends, I mainly use social media to share 
information about health services for women and girls: reporting on what is 
happening in rural Uganda and sharing their reality back with the politicians 
who sit in the capital,Kampala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/09/insiders-guide-kampala-rolex-uganda-capital>
.

In Uganda 16 women die every day 
<http://www.irinnews.org/report/93420/uganda-too-many-deaths-childbirth> from 
complications related to pregnancy and childbirth, almost always because they 
can’t access the care they need. So, almost every weekend I make a trip to a 
village somewhere across the country, record videos at clinics – some which 
still have no electricity or running water – and tweet them at the politicians 
who are responsible for their upkeep.

We have seen improvements in some districts, but my highlight was in the 
regions of Lira and Apac where we managed to get the health centre restocked 
with mosquito nets.

This wouldn’t have been possible a couple of years ago but now most 
politicians haveembraced social media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jun/17/social-media-transforming-communication-africa>
. My approach is quite unique and at first I was worried that I would be 
regarded as too aggressive, putting the politicians off, but they say they 
appreciate it – at least in public anyway.

Before social media we had to rely on word of mouth or phone calls to let 
people know what was happening with the animals we look after. Now, we have 
lots of options at our fingertips.

Twice a year we [a team of rangers and safari guides] live stream the 
migration of wildebeest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/29/great-migration-of-animals-from-serengeti-to-be-broadcast-on-internet>
 across Kenya’s Maasai Mara using Twitter, Periscope and Facebook.

We record the footage on our mobile phones, which is then beamed to the world 
by our colleagues from their office in SouthAfrica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa>.

We can only do this a couple of times a year, when the herds cross the river 
so we can estimate where they are going to be.

The most challenging thing is the distance we need to cover to keep up with 
the animals, but at least we can update people in real time, rather than 
waiting until after the event.


Unless, of course, the reception fails us. It can be hard to find good signal 
deep in the African wilderness.
