Festival of Winter Walks, various

The Ramblers Festival of Winter Walks has been running for more than 25 years. 
Last year, thousands of people joined hundreds of free, group, guided walks, 
ranging from a two-mile stroll suitable for children to a strenuous 15-mile 
hike on the Isle of Wight that included the option to join the Ventnor Boxing 
Day swim. Other highlights are a solstice walk in Wiltshire as the sun rises 
over Stonehenge and a Liverpool city stroll. There are also walks to download

Walk London has been running city walking weekends three times a year since 
2007, and more than 45,000 people have so far taken part. The next one is at 
the end of January, with 45 free guided walks of between 1½ and eight miles. 
Some are designed for young children, such as animal I Spy and quiz walks. 
There are short central London routes, such as a Spooky City stroll or a City 
of London history walk. Others are longer and more scenic, including a Parks 
and Palaces walk and a Thames ramble, all guided by trained leaders. The 
schedule will be online at the end of December.
