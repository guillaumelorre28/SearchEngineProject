Why go now?
Britain’s longest-running comedy festival <http://www.comedy-festival.co.uk/>, 
a 19-day extravaganza at more than 50 venues across the city, kicks off on 4 
February. As well as the big-name acts at the Curve, Leicester’s impressive 
modern theatre (Dylan Moran, Jimmy Carr, Johnny Vegas), quirkier events include 
the UK Pun Championships, stand-up in the dark, and a secret comedy tour (three 
surprise shows in one night).

What if I’m not that into comedy …
How about history? The city has gone monarch-mad after Richard III’s bones 
were found under a car park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/04/richard-iii-dna-bones-king> in 
2012. There is a newRichard III visitor centre <http://kriii.com/>; statues, 
sculptures and walking trails; and the cathedral is being renovated ahead of 
his reburial there on 26 March, in a ceremony that will be shown live on 
Channel 4.

Anything else?

Must be about time for a pint
There are plenty of real-ale pubs – Camra’s guide 
<http://leicester.camra.org.uk/data/documents/Leicester-CAMRA-Real-Ale-Trail-Leaflet.pdf>
 lists 27 in the city centre, including theAle Wagon 
<http://www.alewagon.co.uk/>, a no-frills 1930s boozer. If bohemian bars are 
more your thing,the Exchange <http://www.exchangeleicester.com/#about> and 
Manhattan 34 <http://www.manhattan34.com/>, both on Rutland Street, are 
laid-back and serve great cocktails (try the former’s tangerine dream).

What’s cooking?

 Leicester curry houses: a taste of little India – video 
The Golden Mile (Belgrave Road and Melton Road) is justly renowned for its 
curry houses, but for something a little different, tryKayal 
<http://www.kayalrestaurant.com/> on Granby Street, which serves cracking 
Keralan cuisine. TheWhite Peacock <http://www.the-white-peacock.co.uk/> is good 
for special occasions: the fusion food might include sea bass and tempura prawn 
with coriander and lime gnocchi, though menus change monthly (from £20 for two 
courses to £45 for an eight-course tasting menu).

Anywhere to stay for less than £100 a night?
Of course! The pick of the hotels is Maiyango <http://www.maiyango.com/>, a 
14-room boutique with sleek wooden furniture, splashes of rich colours and 
fabrics, and Cowshed toiletries. It began life as a restaurant before adding 
rooms, and serves some fine food – don’t miss the scallops and pork belly with 
fiery XO sauce – including vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free tasting menus. The 
75-roomBelmont <http://www.belmonthotel.co.uk/> is a good backup option, 
although it looks a little dated in comparison. Both hotels have doubles from 
£79.

Do I need a car to get there?
Leicester has excellent rail connections from north to south and cross 
country. The fastest trains from London St Pancras (terminating at Sheffield) 
take just over an hour, and it is an hour from Birmingham (
eastmidlandstrains.co.uk 
<http://www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk/travelling-with-us/our-network/trains-to-leicester/>
). The city centre is small and perfectly walkable – if you reach the ring 
road, you’ve gone too far.
