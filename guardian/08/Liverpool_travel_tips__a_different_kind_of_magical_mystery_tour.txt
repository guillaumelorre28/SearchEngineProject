Merseyside's latest commemorative plaque, nailed to the spruced-up warehouses 
of Mathew Street, celebrates not the Fab Four, but the Liverpool School of 
Language, Music, Dream and Pun. In the early 1970s, this was the epicentre of 
an alternative universe of artists and dreamers – including Ken Campbell's
Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Campbell>
.

Fast forward 40 years, and that same wilfully radical streak is alive and 
kicking at the Kazimier. In the 1980s, the Kaz was a chrome-railed, glitzy 
nitespot (thinkLeee John's Imagination <http://www.leeejohn.com/> and bubble 
perms); now it is the spiritual home to a collective of creative mavericks 
staging son et lumiere costume parties, riotous sci-fi-themed theatrical 
"happenings" and inspired art installations.

Come here for a journey to the centre of the earth, a magical urban garden, a 
programme of summer nights including a Grimm Brothers-inspired midnight feast. 
Where the Kazimier's journey takes us next is anyone's guess, but you'll be a 
fool not to jump aboard for the ride.
