Thus finishes the second day of the Democratic national convention. Here’s 
what happened:

 * The Democratic party nominated Hillary Clinton for president. Bernie 
Sanders played a prominent role, stepping in at the end of a roll call vote of 
states to ask for nomination by unanimous acclamation. 
 * While some Sanders backers left the hall, the room bore only traces of the 
painfully audible, Clinton-versus-Sanders split that defined Day One. 
 * With the nomination official, the party and the campaign embraced Clinton’s 
historic stature as the first female presidential nominee from a major party 
and possibly first female president. 
 * The foregrounding of the here-comes-the-first-woman-president narrative 
represented a reversal from Clinton’s 2008 primary run, when she faced an 
equally historic opponent. 
 * The narrative culminated with a slide show of US presidents, ending with an 
impressive animation of shattering glass – and there, suddenly, was Clinton, 
addressing the convention by video. 
 * The crowd really enjoyed all of the aforementioned. 
 * Clinton said, in part: “And if there are any little girls out there who 
stayed up late to watch, let me just say: I may become the first woman 
president but one of you is next.”

 * Former president Bill Clinton delivered a keynote speech in which he told 
the story of falling in love with Hillary Clinton and of how amazed he was at 
her industriousness and commitment to improving other people’s lives. 
 * Bill Clinton, seeking to turn the Republican argument that Hillary has been 
around too long lead the country in a new direction, branded her “the 
change-maker.”

 * Sanders’ brother, Larry Sanders, appeared with the Democrats Abroad 
delegation and tearfully said their parents would have been proud of Sanders’ 
accomplishment. 
 * Speakers from former secretary of state Madeleine Albright to Lena Dunham 
to Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards emphasized the role that women 
voters could play in electing president Hillary Clinton.

 * The Republicans released a statement that said in part, “Tonight Democrats 
formally nominated the most scandal-plagued and disliked candidate in the 
history of their party.” 
That’s it from us. See you bright and early tomorrow.

Here’s the RNC response to tonight’s fireworks in Philly. Reince Priebus calls 
Clinton “the most scandal-plagued and disliked candidate in the history of the 
party”:

Tonight Democrats formally nominated the most scandal-plagued and disliked 
candidate in the history of their party,” said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. 
“Despite clinching the nomination, poll after poll continues to show Hillary 
Clinton’s trustworthiness and favorability sinking to all-time lows, and her 
constant shapeshifting on the issues will only further alienate millions of 
Americans already repelled by her cronyism and double standards. Simply put,
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> cannot 
escape the fact Americans overwhelmingly regard her as dishonest, hypocritical, 
and completely out for herself. Our country cannot afford for her to bring her 
poor judgment and unethical behavior into the White House.

Whether it’s her endless flip-flops on the issues, perfecting the art of 
politics for personal gain, or benefitting from a rigged system, Americans 
simply do not like Hillary Clinton. WhileDemocrats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> have chosen to nominate a 
career Washington insider who is always out for herself, Donald Trump is 
promising to shake up Washington and bring strong leadership that will restore 
prosperity, secure our homeland, and Make America Great Again.”

Clinton addresses convention by video

“Tonight is an incredible night for American history and feminist history...” 
says Keys.


It seems like she’s going to sing Girl on Fire. But suddenly there’s a slide 
show of dead presidents – of all the presidents. Where’d Keys go?

Wow Barack Obama gets a cheer. But what happens next is the real 
show-stopper...

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> herself 
– well, a video of her – breaks through the slide show to the sound of 
shattering glass and she kind of is blinking there on the video screen.

She looks a bit like Zod. That was definitely from Superman with the glass. 
There’s Hillary Clinton now addressing the crowd.

The crowd is “freaking out”.

She says this:

I can’t believe we just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet ... 
this is really your victory.

And if there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch, let 
me just say: ‘I may become the first woman president but one of you is next.’

The crowd freakout twists a few notches tighter to full throttle freakout.

So it turns out that – wait, is Alicia Keys going to skip Girl on Fire? They 
really collapsed the program.

Anyway, here’s Girl on Fire:

Alicia Keys:

“Big up to Bernie Sanders– Where my Bernie people at?”

Some cheers.

“Big up to Hillary Clinton– where my Hillary people at?”

That sounds like about everybody now. She introduces her next song:

We can’t let politics divide us. We have to show the world that bigotry and 
fear will never win, because we have so much in common.

have lost their children to senseless violence.

Here’s a quickie roundup of reaction from non-Democrats to Bill Clinton’s 
speech:
Ari Melber MSNBC (@AriMelber) 
Steve Schmidt just said Bill Clinton's speech was a "wedding toast gone bad."

(@MattMackowiak) 
True to form, Bill Clinton just sent the DNC a $350,000 bill for that speech.

Streep pitches Clinton as historic figure

Streep asks of Clinton, “How does she do it? Where does she get her grit and 
her grace? Where do any of our female firsts... where do they find that 
strength?”

Then she places Clinton in some incredible company: Parks, Chisholm, Tubman, 
Ride, O’Connor...

“They have forged new paths so that others can follow them. Men and women. 
Generation after generation. That’s Hillary. That’s America.”

Streep says, “you people have made history.”

The crowd cheers, liking the idea.

“And you’re going to make history again in November!” (cheers) “Because 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> will be 
our first woman president (big cheers) and she’ll be a great president. She’ll 
be the first, but she won’t be the last.”

Now Streep suddenly is gone – she somehow slipped away without a huge big 
applause line – is she coming back? Hard to tell, we’re in the middle of 
another video.

“We got some fight left in us, don’t we?” Streep begins. She’s about to push 
Alicia Keys out of prime time.

What does it take to be the first female anything?” she asks. “It takes grit 
and it takes grace.”

She names the woman soldier who served disguised as a man in Washington’s 
army, Jack -a-Roe style. When she took a blast in battle she was afraid to 
reveal her secret. So she took out a penknife, took out the musket ball and 
sewed herself up again.

The video is a medley of celebrity and recording artist appearances. At the 
end they turn into Hollywood squares and then there are about a hundred of them 
and it turns into an American flag.

Here now is Meryl Streep, wearing an amazing flag shirt.

The video is people singing Clinton’s campaign song, Fight Song by Rachel 
Platten.

Oh look, there’s Gloria Steinem: “I’ve still got a lotta fight left in me,” 
she sings that line.

Elizabeth Banks is back: “How do you get the job of following Bill Clinton?” 

She fundraises off the spot on the speech. Every dollar counts.

“Coming up: some incredible women. Alicia Keys, Meryl Streep... and a few 
surprises.”

Banks says she has a surprise. She has made a video. Here’s the video.

Clinton now is riffing on the primary election without the Teleprompter. He 
went to West Virginia:

To look those coal miners in the eye because Hillary sent me to tell you that 
.. if she wins, she is coming back for you to take you on a ride to America’s 
future

Here’s the big finish:

HIllary will make us stronger together. You know it, because she spent a 
lifetime doing it. I hope you will do it. I hope you will elect her. Those of 
us who have more yesterdays than tomorrows tend to think more about our 
children and grandchildren.”

Then he says something like if you elect her, she will, and he walks away.

The whole end was unscripted, and it really worked in the hall.

Thus finishes the second day of the Democratic national convention. Here’s 
what happened:

 * The Democratic party nominated Hillary Clinton for president. Bernie 
Sanders played a prominent role, stepping in at the end of a roll call vote of 
states to ask for nomination by unanimous acclamation. 
 * While some Sanders backers left the hall, the room bore only traces of the 
painfully audible, Clinton-versus-Sanders split that defined Day One. 
 * With the nomination official, the party and the campaign embraced Clinton’s 
historic stature as the first female presidential nominee from a major party 
and possibly first female president. 
 * The foregrounding of the here-comes-the-first-woman-president narrative 
represented a reversal from Clinton’s 2008 primary run, when she faced an 
equally historic opponent. 
 * The narrative culminated with a slide show of US presidents, ending with an 
impressive animation of shattering glass – and there, suddenly, was Clinton, 
addressing the convention by video. 
 * The crowd really enjoyed all of the aforementioned. 
 * Clinton said, in part: “And if there are any little girls out there who 
stayed up late to watch, let me just say: I may become the first woman 
president but one of you is next.”

 * Former president Bill Clinton delivered a keynote speech in which he told 
the story of falling in love with Hillary Clinton and of how amazed he was at 
her industriousness and commitment to improving other people’s lives. 
 * Bill Clinton, seeking to turn the Republican argument that Hillary has been 
around too long lead the country in a new direction, branded her “the 
change-maker.”

 * Sanders’ brother, Larry Sanders, appeared with the Democrats Abroad 
delegation and tearfully said their parents would have been proud of Sanders’ 
accomplishment. 
 * Speakers from former secretary of state Madeleine Albright to Lena Dunham 
to Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards emphasized the role that women 
voters could play in electing president Hillary Clinton.

 * The Republicans released a statement that said in part, “Tonight Democrats 
formally nominated the most scandal-plagued and disliked candidate in the 
history of their party.” 
That’s it from us. See you bright and early tomorrow.
 
Here’s the RNC response to tonight’s fireworks in Philly. Reince Priebus calls 
Clinton “the most scandal-plagued and disliked candidate in the history of the 
party”:

Tonight Democrats formally nominated the most scandal-plagued and disliked 
candidate in the history of their party,” said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. 
“Despite clinching the nomination, poll after poll continues to show Hillary 
Clinton’s trustworthiness and favorability sinking to all-time lows, and her 
constant shapeshifting on the issues will only further alienate millions of 
Americans already repelled by her cronyism and double standards. Simply put,
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> cannot 
escape the fact Americans overwhelmingly regard her as dishonest, hypocritical, 
and completely out for herself. Our country cannot afford for her to bring her 
poor judgment and unethical behavior into the White House.

Whether it’s her endless flip-flops on the issues, perfecting the art of 
politics for personal gain, or benefitting from a rigged system, Americans 
simply do not like Hillary Clinton. WhileDemocrats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> have chosen to nominate a 
career Washington insider who is always out for herself, Donald Trump is 
promising to shake up Washington and bring strong leadership that will restore 
prosperity, secure our homeland, and Make America Great Again.”

“Tonight is an incredible night for American history and feminist history...” 
says Keys.


It seems like she’s going to sing Girl on Fire. But suddenly there’s a slide 
show of dead presidents – of all the presidents. Where’d Keys go?

Wow Barack Obama gets a cheer. But what happens next is the real 
show-stopper...

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> herself 
– well, a video of her – breaks through the slide show to the sound of 
shattering glass and she kind of is blinking there on the video screen.

She looks a bit like Zod. That was definitely from Superman with the glass. 
There’s Hillary Clinton now addressing the crowd.

The crowd is “freaking out”.

She says this:

I can’t believe we just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet ... 
this is really your victory.

And if there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch, let 
me just say: ‘I may become the first woman president but one of you is next.’

The crowd freakout twists a few notches tighter to full throttle freakout.

So it turns out that – wait, is Alicia Keys going to skip Girl on Fire? They 
really collapsed the program.

Anyway, here’s Girl on Fire:
 
Alicia Keys:

“Big up to Bernie Sanders– Where my Bernie people at?”

Some cheers.

“Big up to Hillary Clinton– where my Hillary people at?”

That sounds like about everybody now. She introduces her next song:

We can’t let politics divide us. We have to show the world that bigotry and 
fear will never win, because we have so much in common.
 
Here’s Alicia Keys, who begins with Superwoman:

I dedicate this song to the mothers of the movement and to all mothers who 
have lost their children to senseless violence.
 
Here’s a quickie roundup of reaction from non-Democrats to Bill Clinton’s 
speech:
Ari Melber MSNBC (@AriMelber) 
Steve Schmidt just said Bill Clinton's speech was a "wedding toast gone bad."

True to form, Bill Clinton just sent the DNC a $350,000 bill for that speech.
#DNCinPHL <https://twitter.com/hashtag/DNCinPHL?src=hash>
 <https://twitter.com/MattMackowiak/status/758135784939454464> July 27, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/MattMackowiak/status/758135784939454464>  
Streep asks of Clinton, “How does she do it? Where does she get her grit and 
her grace? Where do any of our female firsts... where do they find that 
strength?”

Then she places Clinton in some incredible company: Parks, Chisholm, Tubman, 
Ride, O’Connor...

“They have forged new paths so that others can follow them. Men and women. 
Generation after generation. That’s Hillary. That’s America.”

Streep says, “you people have made history.”

The crowd cheers, liking the idea.

“And you’re going to make history again in November!” (cheers) “Because 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> will be 
our first woman president (big cheers) and she’ll be a great president. She’ll 
be the first, but she won’t be the last.”

Now Streep suddenly is gone – she somehow slipped away without a huge big 
applause line – is she coming back? Hard to tell, we’re in the middle of 
another video.
 
“We got some fight left in us, don’t we?” Streep begins. She’s about to push 
Alicia Keys out of prime time.

What does it take to be the first female anything?” she asks. “It takes grit 
and it takes grace.”

She names the woman soldier who served disguised as a man in Washington’s 
army, Jack -a-Roe style. When she took a blast in battle she was afraid to 
reveal her secret. So she took out a penknife, took out the musket ball and 
sewed herself up again.
 
The video is a medley of celebrity and recording artist appearances. At the 
end they turn into Hollywood squares and then there are about a hundred of them 
and it turns into an American flag.

Here now is Meryl Streep, wearing an amazing flag shirt. 
 
The video is people singing Clinton’s campaign song, Fight Song by Rachel 
Platten.

Oh look, there’s Gloria Steinem: “I’ve still got a lotta fight left in me,” 
she sings that line.
 
Elizabeth Banks is back: “How do you get the job of following Bill Clinton?” 

She fundraises off the spot on the speech. Every dollar counts.

“Coming up: some incredible women. Alicia Keys, Meryl Streep... and a few 
surprises.”

Banks says she has a surprise. She has made a video. Here’s the video. 
 
Clinton now is riffing on the primary election without the Teleprompter. He 
went to West Virginia:

To look those coal miners in the eye because Hillary sent me to tell you that 
.. if she wins, she is coming back for you to take you on a ride to America’s 
future

Here’s the big finish:

HIllary will make us stronger together. You know it, because she spent a 
lifetime doing it. I hope you will do it. I hope you will elect her. Those of 
us who have more yesterdays than tomorrows tend to think more about our 
children and grandchildren.”

Then he says something like if you elect her, she will, and he walks away.

The whole end was unscripted, and it really worked in the hall.
