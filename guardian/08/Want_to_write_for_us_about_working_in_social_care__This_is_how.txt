Co-production is the social care buzzword of the moment: the joint designing 
of services by both professionals and service users. And, here at the Guardian 
Social Care Network, we're starting a new series, which we want to be decided 
and written by you. Whether you're a social worker, occupational therapist, 
student or care worker, we want to hear from you.

This series will focus on the issues faced by social care staff, written as 
first-person accounts by people working in the sector. It can be about anything 
from thestress of working as a child protection manager 
<https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2014/aug/13/managing-child-protection-depression-dread-left>
, to considering theconsequences of ageing without children 
<https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2014/apr/25/ageing-without-children-family-care>
.

The blog post should be about a specific issue, and backed up with any 
relevant experience from your working life. It should be clear, and without 
jargon. If in doubt,follow George Orwell's rules for effective writing 
<http://www.writingclasses.com/InformationPages/index.php/PageID/300>, which 
encourage you to never use a long word where a short one will do, and cut out 
any words that can be removed.

When you've chosen what to write about, email socialcare@theguardian.com 
<mailto:socialcare@theguardian.com> with your pitch. This should include who 
you are – if you're a PR for a company, say so. It should be around two short 
paragraphs, and focus on what you want to write about, include any specific 
examples or quotes you will include, and any news stories or blogs you are 
responding or linking to.

If you're writing about a topic that many other people have written about too, 
then you'll need to find a new angle for the piece. Small, specific topics work 
better than broad ideas. Don't pitch "the state of social work": pitch your 
experience of leaving the sector, as our first blogger did (and now don't pitch 
either, because you want to find something new).

If we like your pitch, we'll get back to you with suggestions, and then you 
can go ahead and write.

Some tips for a successful blog post:

• Posts should be around 600 words
• Take a look at the Guardian Style Guide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/info/series/guardian-and-observer-style-guide>, 
our rulebook for writing, editing and English usage. Job titles should always 
be capped down.


• The most important parts of a piece are the beginning and the end. Make sure 
both are strong.
• Always use specific examples
• Link to recent news coverage, if appropriate
• Avoid acronyms and management-speak
• The reader should emerge clear about what you're saying, what other people 
have said on the subject, and what they are being asked to comment on
• Blogs can be anonymous or written under a pseudonym – just let us know
