 reported a 60-pound increase; Machado says it was closer to 15 pounds – which 
Trump and the Miss Universe contest viewed as a significant problem.

“She was the worst we ever had, the worst, she was impossible,” Trump told Fox 
and Friends on Tuesday.

“She was the winner and she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a 
real problem,” said Trump. “Not only that, her attitude. We had a real problem 
with her.”

Trump led the media blitz on Machado’s weight back in 1996, forcing her to 
exercise on camera and speaking publicly about her weight gain. “Some people 
when they have pressure eat too much. Like me. Like Alicia,” hetold the media

at the time. Clinton used his previous comments to pin him on gender issues, in 
some of her final remarks of the evening.

“This is a man who has calling women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has 
said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said that women don’t 
deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men,” said Clinton.

“And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest – 
he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them – and he 
called this woman ‘Miss Piggy’, then he called her ‘Miss Housekeeping’ because 
she was Latina,” said Clinton.

Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows

“Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US 
citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November,” she added. Shortly 
after the debate, the Clinton campaignreleased an ad

 starring Machado.

Trump acknowledged that Clinton’s comments about Machado had frustrated him, 
saying the Clinton campaign “found a girl and talked about her as if she was 
Mother Teresa and it wasn’t quite that way, but that’s OK, Hillary has to do 
what she has to”.

On Tuesday he echoed the claim he made after the debate, as a response to 
Clinton grilling him on his treatment of women, that he wanted to bring up Bill 
Clinton’s extramarital affairs but didn’t out of respect for their daughter, 
Chelsea.


“I didn’t feel comfortable doing it with Chelsea in the room,” said Trump.

But the Republican nominee said he might mention the affairs in the next 
debate on 9 October. “I may hit her harder in certain ways. I really eased up 
in certain ways because I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings,” he said.
