Mint cake has been produced in the same traditional manner for more than a 
hundred years in Kendal. Three established manufacturers still make it by hand, 
heating and stirring the key ingredients – sugar, glucose syrup, oil of 
peppermint and water – in open-topped copper pans. Once it reaches a 
temperature of around 129°C, the thick syrup is poured into moulds and left to 
dry overnight before being wrapped.

Local legend has it that mint cake was originally created by accident when 
Kendal confectioner Joseph Wiper, intending to make glacier mints, took his eye 
off the cooking pan for a minute and then noticed that the mixture had started 
to “grain” and become cloudy instead of clear. When poured out, the result was 
mint cake.

Wiper started production in Kendal in 1869 and went on to supply Sir Ernest 
Shackleton’s 1914-17 Imperial Trans-Antarctic expedition. It has since become a 
popular survival food for expeditions all over the world thanks to its 
combination of refreshing minty taste and high energy content of 350 calories 
per 100 grams.
