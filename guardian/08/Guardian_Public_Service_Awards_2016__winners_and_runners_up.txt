The winners of the Guardian Public Service Awards 2016 have all challenged the 
way things are done. They have effected change to make services better for the 
people using them, better at reaching others who should use them and – an 
inescapable requirement in this long and bleak fiscal winter – better value for 
the taxpayer.

Our overall winner, Sevenoaks council 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society-professionals/2016/nov/30/guardian-public-service-awards-2016-overall-winner-sevenoaks-district-council>
, exemplifies these qualities. It is the first council to make itself 
financially self-sufficient, recognising the inevitability of loss of funding 
by central government. To do so, however, it has had to confront and overcome 
risk aversion on the part of its own councillors.

<https://www.theguardian.com/society-professionals/2016/nov/30/guardian-public-service-awards-2016-public-servant-of-the-year-winner-helen-backus>
, of Buckinghamshire county council, has transformed the way that young people 
with disabilities or support needs are regarded and treated, both in her home 
authority and farther afield.

A record 6,000 readers voted in the public servant poll. Thanks to them, to 
all 420 entrants for the team categories and to our sponsors for their support 
in being able to bring back the awards after a gap of two years.

The overwhelming evidence is that public services may be battered by 
austerity, but they are unbowed.
