With only two days until the general election will decide the fate of the 
White House,three House Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/may/14/who-supports-donald-trump-the-new-republican-center-of-gravity#waitAndSee>
 remain the only GOP members of Congress to decline to say whether they will 
support their party’s nominee for president, Donald Trump. Each of the three – 
David Jolly of Florida, Martha McSally of Arizona and Mac Thornberry of Texas – 
long ago voiced a wait-and-see approach to Trump, hoping that he would moderate 
his statements on women or focus the campaign on national security issues.

“If the election were today, I would not support Donald Trump,” pledged Jolly 
in September 
<http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/david-jolly-im-not-going-endorse-trump-and-i-wont-vote-him-either>
, before hedging. “I don’t know where I’ll be in November, but I don’t see a 
pathway to support Donald Trump.”

“If you endorse somebody, it’s like a stamp of approval and embracing them,” 
Thornberry explained in June

, adding that there was no way he would vote for Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton regardless of whether he voted for Trump. “I’m not comfortable doing 
that with him based on a number of reasons.”

But as the race draws to a close, the wait-and-see approach to Trump has 
become a wait-it-out approach, with the theoretically undecided congressmen 
(and -woman) keeping tight-lipped about their plans for Tuesday’s presidential 
election.

“He will not vote for Hillary Clinton. He does plan to vote,” Carmen Fenton, a 
communications aide to Thornberry’s congressional campaign, told the Guardian, 
saying she did not know for whom the congressman planned on voting. “I know 
that’s not what you are looking for, but that’s all I have.”

Despite multiple requests for clarification, representatives for Jolly and 
McSally all declined to comment on the record regarding the senators’ voting 
plans.

But recent comments indicate a sense that the representatives are caught 
between the devil and the deep blue sea.

“I don’t plan on endorsing anybody and I haven’t in the past,” McSally told 
the Arizona Republic 
<http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/09/paul-babeu-martha-mcsally-struggle-respond-donald-trump-fallout/91805874/>
 in October. McSally is a first-term representative from Arizona’s purple 
second district, which she won by a mere 167 votes in 2014. “Who we vote for is 
our own private decision. It’s not my focus or my responsibility … I think the 
voters are smart enough to figure out who they want to vote for for the 
president.”



In their silence on the nominee’s chances of winning their vote, 
representatives may be following the example of one of Trump’s prominent 
endorsers: House speaker Paul Ryan. After therelease of a video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women>
 in which Trump bragged that his fame allowed him to sexually assault women 
without fear of consequence, Ryan told congressional colleagues that he wouldno 
longer defend Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans>
, urging fellow congressional Republicans “to do what’s best for you” to 
maintain the Republican majority in the lower house.

At the same time, Ryan emphasized that he would not formally un-endorse Trump, 
and on Tuesday, Ryan announced that he had cast his early-voting ballot in his 
home state of Wisconsin for “our nominee”.

The name “Trump” never crossed Ryan’s lips.

Donald Trump. In fact, he is supporting Trump.
