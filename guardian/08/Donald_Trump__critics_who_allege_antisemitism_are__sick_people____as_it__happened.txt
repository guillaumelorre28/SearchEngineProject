Today in Campaign 2016

Donald Trump may have wanted to devote today to Hillary Clinton 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/750714064574218245>, but affirming 
his hatred of mosquitos, fondness for Saddam Hussein’s willingness to execute 
terrorists without due process and tweeting a late-night screengrab of a book 
of Frozen stickers to counter accusations of antisemitism has pretty much laid 
those plans to rest.

 * Donald Trump defended a controversial tweet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/02/donald-trump-star-of-david-tweet-hillary-clinton>
 that many considered antisemitic and reiterated his praise for Saddam Hussein 
on Wednesday in a rambling, unscripted campaign rally that will compound the 
fears of Republicans who question if their candidate has the discipline to 
reach the White House. 
 * The billionaire’s rekindling of two controversies distracted from the 
difficult week being endured by his Democratic adversary, Hillary Clinton,who 
was excoriated by the FBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation>
 over her “extremely careless” use of emails.

Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also?

 * Attorney general Loretta Lynch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/loretta-lynch> closed the investigation 
into Hillary Clinton’s private email practices with no charges on Wednesday, 
formally ending a protracted saga that has clouded her campaign with questions 
of trustworthiness. “Late this afternoon, I met with FBI director James Comey 
and career prosecutors and agents who conducted the investigation of Secretary 
Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email system during her time as secretary 
of state,” Lynch said in a statement. “I received and accepted their unanimous 
recommendation that the thorough, yearlong investigation be closed and that no 
charges be brought against any individuals within the scope of the 
investigation.”

A British man has pled not guilty to charges that he tried to steal a police 
officer’s gun 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/30/briton-charged-in-us-after-assassination-attempt-on-donald-trump>
 to shoot Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.
 Michael Sandford. Photograph: John Locher/AP 
20-year-old Michael Sanford, from the town of Dorking in England, was arrested 
and taken into custody at a Trump rally at the Treasure Island Casino in Las 
Vegas on 21 June after trying to grab the pistol at the hip of a police officer 
protecting Trump, according to a report by the secret service.

Sandford stood wearing a yellow jail jumpsuit with his federal public defense 
attorneys during his brief arraignment. He responded “yes, I do” when US 
magistrate judge Cam Ferenbach asked whether he understood the nature of the 
charges against him.

After he was arrested, Sandford told officers that he had intended to kill 
Trump, and said that he had purchased tickets to another event later that day 
in Phoenix, Arizona, as backup. He had driven to Las Vegas from San Bernardino, 
California, that day specifically to shoot the Republican nominee, the report 
said.

Hillary Clinton has issued a statement following news that the Department of 
Justice isopening a civil rights investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-investigation-department-of-justice>
 into the shooting death of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

“The death of Alton Sterling is a tragedy, and my prayers are with his family, 
including his five children,” Clinton said. “From Staten Island to Baltimore, 
Ferguson to Baton Rouge, too many African American families mourn the loss of a 
loved one from a police-involved incident. Something is profoundly wrong when 
so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn’t consider them 
as precious as others because of the color of their skin.

“I am glad the Department of Justice has agreed to a full and thorough review 
of this shooting. Incidents like this one have undermined the trust between 
police departments and the communities they serve. We need to rebuild that 
trust. We need to ensure justice is served. That begins with common sense 
reforms like ending racial profiling, providing better training on 
de-escalation and implicit bias, and supporting municipalities that refer the 
investigation and prosecution of police-involved deaths to independent bodies. 
All over America, there are police officers demonstrating how to protect the 
public without resorting to unnecessary force. We need to learn from and build 
on those examples.

“Progress is possible if we stand together and never waver in our fight to 
secure the future that every American deserves.”

horrifies the audience - and prompts them into chanting “Newt! Newt! Newt!”

Trump seems taken aback.

“I like that, too! We like Newt! And I’ll tell you what - Newt has been my 
friend for a long time, and I’m not saying anything and I’m not telling even 
Newt anything, but I can tell you that, in one form or another, Newt Gingrich 
is going to be involved in our government, okay?

“He’s smart, he’s tough, he gets it, and he says that I’m the biggest thing 
that he’s seen in politics.”

Donald Trump may have wanted to devote today to Hillary Clinton 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/750714064574218245>, but affirming 
his hatred of mosquitos, fondness for Saddam Hussein’s willingness to execute 
terrorists without due process and tweeting a late-night screengrab of a book 
of Frozen stickers to counter accusations of antisemitism has pretty much laid 
those plans to rest.

 * Donald Trump defended a controversial tweet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/02/donald-trump-star-of-david-tweet-hillary-clinton>
 that many considered antisemitic and reiterated his praise for Saddam Hussein 
on Wednesday in a rambling, unscripted campaign rally that will compound the 
fears of Republicans who question if their candidate has the discipline to 
reach the White House.

into Hillary Clinton’s private email practices with no charges on Wednesday, 
formally ending a protracted saga that has clouded her campaign with questions 
of trustworthiness. “Late this afternoon, I met with FBI director James Comey 
and career prosecutors and agents who conducted the investigation of Secretary 
Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email system during her time as secretary 
of state,” Lynch said in a statement. “I received and accepted their unanimous 
recommendation that the thorough, yearlong investigation be closed and that no 
charges be brought against any individuals within the scope of the 
investigation.”
 
In record time, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has responded to Donald

A British man has pled not guilty to charges that he tried to steal a police 
officer’s gun 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/30/briton-charged-in-us-after-assassination-attempt-on-donald-trump>
 to shoot Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.

20-year-old Michael Sanford, from the town of Dorking in England, was arrested 
and taken into custody at a Trump rally at the Treasure Island Casino in Las 
Vegas on 21 June after trying to grab the pistol at the hip of a police officer 
protecting Trump, according to a report by the secret service.

Sandford stood wearing a yellow jail jumpsuit with his federal public defense 
attorneys during his brief arraignment. He responded “yes, I do” when US 
magistrate judge Cam Ferenbach asked whether he understood the nature of the 
charges against him.

After he was arrested, Sandford told officers that he had intended to kill 
Trump, and said that he had purchased tickets to another event later that day 
in Phoenix, Arizona, as backup. He had driven to Las Vegas from San Bernardino, 
California, that day specifically to shoot the Republican nominee, the report 
said.

Hillary Clinton has issued a statement following news that the Department of 
Justice isopening a civil rights investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/alton-sterling-baton-rouge-investigation-department-of-justice>
 into the shooting death of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

“The death of Alton Sterling is a tragedy, and my prayers are with his family, 
including his five children,” Clinton said. “From Staten Island to Baltimore, 
Ferguson to Baton Rouge, too many African American families mourn the loss of a 
loved one from a police-involved incident. Something is profoundly wrong when 
so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn’t consider them 
as precious as others because of the color of their skin.

“I am glad the Department of Justice has agreed to a full and thorough review 
of this shooting. Incidents like this one have undermined the trust between 
police departments and the communities they serve. We need to rebuild that 
trust. We need to ensure justice is served. That begins with common sense 
reforms like ending racial profiling, providing better training on 
de-escalation and implicit bias, and supporting municipalities that refer the 
investigation and prosecution of police-involved deaths to independent bodies. 
All over America, there are police officers demonstrating how to protect the 
public without resorting to unnecessary force. We need to learn from and build 
on those examples.

“Progress is possible if we stand together and never waver in our fight to 
secure the future that every American deserves.”
 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is 
apparently more than happy to hear rumors of Donald Trump joining forces with 
former House speaker Newt Gingrich.

“We’re gonna start winning again, folks,” Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> promises the audience in 
closing.

“When we were young, we never lost a war,” Trump says. “We never win a war - 
we never win a battle, we never win anything.”

“I want a president that’s gonna knock the hell out of Isis,” Trump says. “I 
want a president that’s gonna make great trade deals, I want a president that’s 
gonna create strong boarders.”

“We’re gonna win - we’re gonna win so much ... that the people of Ohio are 
going to call your representatives,” Trump says, to say that “we’re winning too 
much.”

“Mister President, sir, we’re winning too much! The people of Ohio can’t stand 
it, we’re winning too much and they’re not used to it!”
