It’s been a long time since we had a Poster poems challenge based on a poetic 
form, so I thought this month we should look at something we’ve never tried 
before. Ottava rima is an eight-line stanza developed in Italy, usually 
associated in English with Byron and his fellow second-generation Romantics. 
The standard rhyme scheme is a-b-a-b-a-b-c-c and in English the lines are 
usually iambic pentameters.


The earliest known ottava rima poems were written by Boccaccio, including two 
long epic works,Teseida 
<http://boccaccio.letteraturaoperaomnia.org/boccaccio_teseida_delle_nozze_d_emilia.html>
 andFilostrato 
<http://boccaccio.letteraturaoperaomnia.org/boccaccio_filostrato.html>. These 
poems established ottava rima as the default stanza for epics on serious 
themes, a use that persisted in Italian until at least the 16th century, when 
Torquato Tasso used it for his embroidered tale of the Crusades,Gerusalemme 
liberata 
<http://www.liberliber.it/mediateca/libri/t/tasso/gerusalemme_liberata/html/testo.htm>
.

As with so many things Italian, ottava rima was introduced into English by 
Thomas Wyatt, whose single-stanzaEpigram LXI 
<http://www.bartleby.com/255/158.html> is nearer in tone to a sonnet than to 
his epic Italian models. It is a typically complex meditation on Wyatt’s 
favourite theme of the spurned lover, and the complex sentence structure, in 
which the resolution is constantly deferred through syntax, works in tandem 
with the rhyme pattern to produce a near-perfect lyric.

Elizabethan poets after Wyatt were quick to rediscover the epic potential of 
ottava rima. Thomas Heywood’s Troia Britannica was a 13,000-line rendition of 
the medieval legend of Troy. Michael Drayton turned to English history and the 
story of the early 14th-century revolt of the Barons against Edward II, known 
as the Despenser war, inThe Barons’ War 
<https://archive.org/details/baronswarsnymph01draygoog>. Ottava rima was now 
established as the stanza form of choice for epic subject matter in English, to 
the extent that Edmund Spenser adapted it by inserting an extra “b” rhyme line 
to create the Spenserian stanza he used forThe Faerie Queen 
<http://pages.uoregon.edu/rbear/fqintro.html>.

This kind of epic poem fell out of fashion in the 17th and 18th centuries, and 
the next significant ottava rima English poem to appear was John Hookham 
Frere’s Arthurian romanceThe Monks and the Giants 
<http://www.elfinspell.com/MonksandGiants.html>, which was published in the 
early years of the 19th century under the pseudonym William Whistlecraft. 
Frere’s poem was a dull affair and would be long forgotten but for one happy 
fact: it was read and admired by Byron, who went on to use the stanza form for
his great mock epic, Don Juan <http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173089>.

The success of Byron’s poem seems to have inspired his contemporaries. Shelley 
used it for his utopian fantasyThe Witch of Atlas 
<http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/PShelley/witch.html>, which was a relatively 
modest 78 stanzas long. Keats used the form forIsabella 
<http://www.bartleby.com/126/38.html>, a Gothic tale of love doomed because it 
crossed class divisions, and a favourite of the Pre-Raphaelites. These poems, 
which were neither epic nor humorous, expanded the emotional range of the 
ottava rima stanza.

This range was further expanded in the late works of WB Yeats, who used ottava 
rima for a number of poems, including three of his greatest,Sailing to Byzantium
 <http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/172063>, Among School Children 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/172065> and The Circus Animals’ Desertion 
<http://ireland.wlu.edu/landscape/Group5/poem.htm>. In these poems the stanza 
is used to give stately, meditative structure to some of the most profound 
poetry of memory, mortality and art you will ever read. With Yeats, ottava rima 
came of age.

His influence can be seen in poems as diverse as Derek Mahon’s Courtyards in 
Delft <http://english.emory.edu/classes/paintings&poems/delft.html>, written in 
an irregularly rhyming variant, and Augustus Young’s serious mock epic, The 
Credit, which uses a syllabic version of eight syllables to the line with 
irregular feet. Unfortunately this is not available online, but a single stanza 
will give you a good idea:

Nothing has changed. No science can
protect the effects from the cause.
The birth, freed from the family plan,
reverts to genotypal laws.
The furies’ midwife genus, Man,
put back the morsel in the claws
of those whose chromosomes were rent,
contributing their fifty percent.

And so, this month’s challenge is to write a poem in ottava rima. You can be 
as strict or as flexible as you like – feel free to bend the rules to your 
needs. As for the tone and subject matter, you might want to go with Byron’s 
humour, Yeats’s high seriousness, or all points in between. Give us a single 
stanza epigram or fragments from an epic in progress. Let’s see which octave we 
wind up in.
