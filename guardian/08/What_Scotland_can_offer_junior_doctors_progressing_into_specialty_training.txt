The clinical leader

With 160,000 NHS staff serving a population of five million, covering 
everything from inner-city deprivation to isolated island communities, Scotland 
has long had a reputation for medical excellence.

Scotland’s chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood said: “Scotland’s 
healthcare sector is progressive, well-resourced and highly diverse, offering 
medical practitioners an exceptionally wide and rewarding range of career 
possibilities, from hospital specialties to general practice, academia and 
research.”

She adds: “Scotland is a great place to train and work, with our 
internationally recognised patient safety programme and medical training 
described by an independent2015 OECD report 
<http://www.oecd.org/unitedkingdom/oecd-reviews-of-health-care-quality-united-kingdom-2016-9789264239487-en.htm>
 as ‘world class’.

“Scotland is also a modern, diverse and beautiful country with a multicultural 
society and world class education. Our relatively high standard of living is 
another major attraction to professionals, with property prices more affordable 
than other parts of the UK.

“We can see all these factors having an effect – this year, over 96% of all 
medical training posts in Scotland were filled, and the number of foundation 
level doctors applying to train here increased by 27%.”

Dr Rosemary Hollick 
<http://www.scotmt.scot.nhs.uk/recruitment/junior-doctor-videos.aspx> is a 
junior doctor working in rheumatology in Aberdeen. She said: “Scotland is a 
great place to train, especially here in the north-east. We’ve got a huge 
hospital complex in Aberdeen, with the main medical and surgical specialties, 
children’s hospital, maternity hospital on multiple sites plus two further 
hospitals, including the region’s main centre for mental health, nearby in the 
city.

“But we also cover a huge geographical area, so as well as the city there’s a 
large rural area, including the islands of Shetland and Orkney. In terms of 
training, that provides huge diversity and excellent training means excellent 
patient care.

“I’ve also had the opportunity to conduct some research and I am currently 
doing a PhD with the University of Aberdeen.

“I’ve got two young children and I would not have been able to continue my 
training had I not been able to train flexibly for a period of time. I’ve been 
very well supported to do that.

“We have a city with good rail and airport links, good quality of life and all 
sorts of outdoor pursuits on your doorstep. A good work-life balance is 
important, and it’s a great place to live and bring up my family.”

“We oversee the delivery and quality management of postgraduate medical 
training for 5,500 doctors across Scotland. We work in partnership with health 
boards and GP surgeries to train doctors to be the senior clinicians we need to 
treat Scotland’s people in the future. Our job is to ensure that these doctors

“As part of ‘Round one’ recruitment each Spring, we extend our offering to 
more than 50 GMC-approved specialties. All our training programmes provide 
excellent clinical experience in a range of hospitals on a rotational basis and 
we are proud that many Scottish programmes score very highly in the annual GMC 
trainee survey.”
