So that is that. Bangladesh’s win was a thumping one, by 108 runs, with two 
days to spare. History has been resoundingly made, and it’s been an honour to 
tap out the first draft of it. Thanks for your company, your emails, your 
tweets and your good humour. English cricket won’t go down without a laugh.

Man of the match is Mehedi Hasan, Mr Six For, who trots up with a glorious 
smile on his face and says “I’m really happy”. He can say that again. And he 
does.

My grandfather, John de Lisle, was a county cricketer who spent several years 
in Dhaka, working as a jute merchant. It would have surprised him to see 
Bangladesh become a nation, let alone a Test team, but I like to think he would 
have been cheering them on today. Test cricket has had a wonderful couple of 
weeks, and to have a young nation doing so well makes the whole game stronger.

Here’s a story on it – a great story.

Man of the series will surely be Mehedi Hasan, the off spinner who took 19 
England wickets, one for each of his tender years. He was accurate, tireless, 
painstaking, a real grown-up.

England need to sort out the way they play spin, and the way they deploy it. 
Alistair Cook had three slow bowlers here, but showed little faith in them, and 
set fields that just gave away easy singles.

So history is made, and history is invoked by Phil, our resident mononym. “To 
paraphrase Admiral Beatty at Jutland,” he writes, “there seems to be something 
wrong with our batsmen.”

The astonishing thing about this victory is not that it happened, but that it 
came so fast. England were 100-0 at tea, and cruising, with Ben Duckett making 
an electric first Test fifty. The first ball after tea, Duckett got a 
daisy-cutter, and then Mehedi stood tall and lured England into one of their 
all-time great collapses. They lost all ten wickets for 64 in 22.3 overs. 
Staggering stuff.

History!! Bangladesh beat England

Finn is plumb lbw and Mehedi, the teenage wonder boy, has given his country 
their first win over England. He may also have given the rest of the world a 
laugh – but this win was no fluke, and a drawn series is the right result.

45th over: England 163-9 (Woakes 8, Finn 0) target 273 A pattern has already 
established itself for this partnership: Woakes takes a comfortable single half 
way through the over, and Finn uses his long reach to see out the rest. If they 
can just keep it up for a couple of days, England will be fine.

43rd over: England 161-9 (Woakes 6, Finn 0) target 273 Shakib was poor at the 
start of this innings, but he has had the last laugh – three of them in one 
over. And that catch, from Mominul, was phenomenal.

“Hey Tim,” writes Shammi Huda. “The last decade has been tough as a supporter 
of Arsenal fc and Bangladesh cricket...for the giddy highs there are always 
unspeakable lows, every silver lining has a cloud...but now, welcome to Tiger 
country! Great series commentary, look forward to Indian series.” Me too, but 
England may be dreading it.

Wicket!!!!!! Ansari

Ansar sees off one ball but can’t cope with the next, clipping to leg and 
falling to a superb catch from Nominal at short leg. That was James 
Taylor-esque. It’s 161-9 and England still need more than a hundred. History is 
beckoning to Bangladesh.

six men round the bat. He manages it, propping forward solidly.

Wicket!!

Rashid, sent in ahead of Ansari after his first-innings heroics, has gone.

No doubt this time – Stokes b Shakib 25, flummoxed by the flight. England 
161-7, sinking fast.

Six!

Stokes goes down the track to Mehedi, fails to reach the pitch of the ball,

41st over: England 150-6 (Stokes 14, Woakes 6) target 273 When the hundred 
came up, England were right on top. Now they are in a tight corner and a 
desperate scrap. Can Stokes, the dominant personality of the series so far, dig 
them out?

Dropped!

Stokes reprieved by Shakib off his own bowling – a tricky one, falling in 
front of him, but catchable.

40th over: England 149-6 (Stokes 13, Woakes 6) target 273 Stokes tries to live 
up to that last point with a slog-sweep off Mehedi, but it’s well stopped at 
square leg. With the lights on, Bangladesh need to keep up this momentum.

39th over: England 147-6 (Stokes 12, Woakes 5) target 273 Both batsmen are 
staying positive. Stokes will not go gently.

An email from Phil, who seems to have just the one name, like Beyonce. “With 
this first five batting order, England will get slaughtered by India. Changes 
need to be made, starting with Ballance and Moeen.” Ballance, for sure, but 
that seems a little hard on Mo, who made a crucial 60 at Chittagong. A 60 in 
this series is worth a hundred in most places.

37th over: England 137-5 (Stokes 9, Bairstow 2) target 273 Stokes survives an 
lbw appeal from Shakib, not that it bothers him – he then goes for a reverse 
sweep and misses, but gets away with it. And that’sdrinks. Seldom has an hour 
belonged so utterly to one side: five wickets, 37 runs, mostly mayhem. But can 
Bangladesh finish England off, as they narrowly failed to do in Chittagong? The 
heart says yes, the head says probably.

35th over: England 129-5 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 0) target 273 Stokes chops out a 
two, then keeps out the rest and nicks the strike with a handsome back-foot 
push to the cover sweeper. England have the personality to rescue this – 
Stokes, Bairstow, Woakes, Rashid. The question is whether they have the skill.

“So,” asks John Starbuck, “is the sixth-wicket partnership going to rescue 
England again?”

34th over: England 127-5 (Stokes 1, Bairstow 0) target 273 Mehedi now has four 
wickets in this spell and ten in the match. The one that got Cook didn’t seem 
to do much, but Rob Key spots that it was a slower ball – an even-slower ball. 
Teenage kicks are not what they were.

Wicket! COOK!

No doubt this time, as Cook pokes straight to silly point and perishes to a 
juggling catch. That’s 127-5 and Bangladesh appear to be racing to their first 
Test victory over England. But Stokes and Bairstow, so effective together, may 
have other ideas.

33rd over: England 126-4 (Cook 59, Stokes 0) target 273 After surviving 
Shuvagata’s fifth ball, Cook plays and misses at the sixth. When Duckett was 
there, England were making a molehill out of a mountain. Now they’re making a 
minefield.

32nd over: England 124-4 (Cook 57, Stokes 0) target 273 So it’s a 
double-wicket maiden from Mehedi, who is having a spectacular debut series - 16 
wickets at 17, and he is only 19. But Cook is still there and England have a 
near-reversible batting order...

Wicket!!! England 124-4

Moeen has to go – it was clipping leg. Well bowled Mehedi, and that’s four 
wickets for 24 since tea. Another classic England collapse.
 Moeen Ali of England leaves the field after being dismissed by Mehedi Hasan.

Wicket! England 124-3

Gary Ballance’s nightmare continues as he somehow turns a long hop into a 
leading edge and hands a simple catch to the man at mid-off. Game absolutely 
on. Ballance’s Test career, not so much.

Fifty! For Cook

Cook plays a studious tuck into the leg side for two, and that’s his 52nd Test 
fifty – but his first of this series. Cometh the hour, cometh the Chef.

An unexpected request from Bill Walters. “Can the OBO page link to the match 
commentary tomorrow not include the match result please?” Ha.

27th over: England 110-2 (Cook 45, Ballance 3) target 273 Another maiden, from 
Mehedi to Balance. England are in danger of going into their shell.

An email from Michael Hunt. “Ignoring briefly that my phone wants to 
autocorrect ‘Duckett’ to ‘Sucker’,” he notes, “one thing very much in his 
favour has to be that ‘Duckett Wicket’ is sonically much more pleasing than the 
alternatives, no?” Yes, and so is Duckett whack it. He’s a cricketer who could 
have been dreamt up by Roald Dahl.

thing after 135 Tests, it’s how to calm things down. He plays out a maiden over 
from Shakib which would have gone for 20 if Duckett had still been with us.

26th over: England 110-2 (Cook 45, Ballance 3) target 273 High drama in Dhaka: 
that may have been the moment this Test turned on. “Fine margins,” mutter the 
commentators, and although it’s a cliche, it’s never been truer. The one that 
got Root was only brushing leg stump; the one that didn’t get Cook was only 
just missing it.

Not out!!

It’s umpire Dharmasena, and he took a long time to raise the finger ... and 
Cook survives – it was missing leg. Great review.

25th over: England 108-2 (Cook 44, Ballance 2) target 273 In comes Gary 
Ballance, who’s been hopeless so far – though, to be fair, he is just as busy 
as Root, looking for singles, and he has already outlasted him.

“I can almost see,” says Ian Copestake, “how Guy Hornsby is feeling right now.”

Wicket! Root!

Pinned lbw by Taijul’s arm ball. Root could have reviewed but didn’t, perhaps 
cowed by England’s abysmal reviewing earlier. He’s out for 1 and it’s game on.

24th over: England 105-1 (Cook 43, Root 1) target 273 Duckett is gone, but his 
spirit remains. Joe Root is instantly busy, shovelling into the gap at wide 
mid-on for a single, and Cook gets four more with yet another sweep. He’ll be 
reverse-sweeping before long.

Wicket! Duckett!

So that is that. Bangladesh’s win was a thumping one, by 108 runs, with two 
days to spare. History has been resoundingly made, and it’s been an honour to 
tap out the first draft of it. Thanks for your company, your emails, your 
tweets and your good humour. English cricket won’t go down without a laugh.
 
Here’s our hot take  on a quite astonishing Test.

Bangladesh claim historic Test win over England as collapse ensures tied series

Man of the match is Mehedi Hasan, Mr Six For, who trots up with a glorious 
smile on his face and says “I’m really happy”. He can say that again. And he 
does.
 
My grandfather, John de Lisle, was a county cricketer who spent several years 
in Dhaka, working as a jute merchant. It would have surprised him to see 
Bangladesh become a nation, let alone a Test team, but I like to think he would 
have been cheering them on today. Test cricket has had a wonderful couple of 
weeks, and to have a young nation doing so well makes the whole game stronger.

Here’s a story on it – a great story.


Bangladesh claim historic Test win over England as collapse ensures tied series

Man of the series will surely be Mehedi Hasan, the off spinner who took 19 
England wickets, one for each of his tender years. He was accurate, tireless, 
painstaking, a real grown-up.

England need to sort out the way they play spin, and the way they deploy it. 
Alistair Cook had three slow bowlers here, but showed little faith in them, and 
set fields that just gave away easy singles.
 
So history is made, and history is invoked by Phil, our resident mononym. “To 
paraphrase Admiral Beatty at Jutland,” he writes, “there seems to be something 
wrong with our batsmen.”
 
The astonishing thing about this victory is not that it happened, but that it 
came so fast. England were 100-0 at tea, and cruising, with Ben Duckett making 
an electric first Test fifty. The first ball after tea, Duckett got a 
daisy-cutter, and then Mehedi stood tall and lured England into one of their 
all-time great collapses. They lost all ten wickets for 64 in 22.3 overs. 
Staggering stuff.
 
Finn is plumb lbw and Mehedi, the teenage wonder boy, has given his country 
their first win over England. He may also have given the rest of the world a 
laugh – but this win was no fluke, and a drawn series is the right result.
 
45th over: England 163-9 (Woakes 8, Finn 0) target 273 A pattern has already 
established itself for this partnership: Woakes takes a comfortable single half 
way through the over, and Finn uses his long reach to see out the rest. If they 
can just keep it up for a couple of days, England will be fine.
 
44th over: England 162-9 (Woakes 7, Finn 0) target 273 Woakes has been 
formidable for the past four months, but this is surely beyond him.
 
43rd over: England 161-9 (Woakes 6, Finn 0) target 273 Shakib was poor at the 
start of this innings, but he has had the last laugh – three of them in one 
over. And that catch, from Mominul, was phenomenal.

“Hey Tim,” writes Shammi Huda. “The last decade has been tough as a supporter 
of Arsenal fc and Bangladesh cricket...for the giddy highs there are always 
unspeakable lows, every silver lining has a cloud...but now, welcome to Tiger 
country! Great series commentary, look forward to Indian series.” Me too, but 
England may be dreading it.
 
Ansar sees off one ball but can’t cope with the next, clipping to leg and 
falling to a superb catch from Nominal at short leg. That was James 
Taylor-esque. It’s 161-9 and England still need more than a hundred. History is 
beckoning to Bangladesh.
 
Zafar Ansari, scholar and spinner, has to see off a hat-trick from Shakib, wit 
six men round the bat. He manages it, propping forward solidly.
 
Rashid, sent in ahead of Ansari after his first-innings heroics, has gone. 
Straight ball, stone dead, 161-8, and I am running out of exclamation marks.
 
Rashid given lbw first ball, and he looks a goner.
 
No doubt this time – Stokes b Shakib 25, flummoxed by the flight. England 
161-7, sinking fast.
 
42nd over: England 157-6 (Stokes 21, Woakes 6) target 273 We already have a 
winner: Test cricket, again. The suspense is delicious.
 
Stokes survives, saved by the flick of ball on glove, which means he 
technically hit it. You couldn’t make it up.
 
Given lbw, he reviews. Looks outish...
 
Stokes goes down the track to Mehedi, fails to reach the pitch of the ball, 
and still lofts it over long-off. Immense.
 
41st over: England 150-6 (Stokes 14, Woakes 6) target 273 When the hundred 
came up, England were right on top. Now they are in a tight corner and a 
desperate scrap. Can Stokes, the dominant personality of the series so far, dig 
them out?
 
Stokes reprieved by Shakib off his own bowling – a tricky one, falling in 
front of him, but catchable.
 
40th over: England 149-6 (Stokes 13, Woakes 6) target 273 Stokes tries to live 
up to that last point with a slog-sweep off Mehedi, but it’s well stopped at 
square leg. With the lights on, Bangladesh need to keep up this momentum.
 
39th over: England 147-6 (Stokes 12, Woakes 5) target 273 Both batsmen are 
staying positive. Stokes will not go gently.

An email from Phil, who seems to have just the one name, like Beyonce. “With 
this first five batting order, England will get slaughtered by India. Changes 
need to be made, starting with Ballance and Moeen.” Ballance, for sure, but 
that seems a little hard on Mo, who made a crucial 60 at Chittagong. A 60 in 
this series is worth a hundred in most places.
 
38th over: England 143-6 (Stokes 10, Woakes 3) target 273 Woakes begins with a 
cool cover drive for three. But if one more thing goes wrong, England are 
surely sunk.
 
Bat, pad, pop, snaffle. Mehedi has yet another five-for, England are 139-6, 
and Bangladesh are now hot favourites.
 
An email from Jake Dodds. “A message from my Dad that I’m happy to share as it 
demonstrates both cleanliness and humour: ‘Just had quick shower, lost 2 wkts, 
if you count Ballance as a wicket.’”
 
37th over: England 137-5 (Stokes 9, Bairstow 2) target 273 Stokes survives an 
lbw appeal from Shakib, not that it bothers him – he then goes for a reverse 
sweep and misses, but gets away with it. And that’sdrinks. Seldom has an hour 
belonged so utterly to one side: five wickets, 37 runs, mostly mayhem. But can 
Bangladesh finish England off, as they narrowly failed to do in Chittagong? The 
heart says yes, the head says probably.
 
36th over: England 136-5 (Stokes 9, Bairstow 1) target 273 Mehedi drops short 
and Stokes pounces with a stylish pull for four. He is happy to take up the 
gauntlet thrown down by Duckett.
 
35th over: England 129-5 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 0) target 273 Stokes chops out a 
two, then keeps out the rest and nicks the strike with a handsome back-foot 
push to the cover sweeper. England have the personality to rescue this – 
Stokes, Bairstow, Woakes, Rashid. The question is whether they have the skill.

“So,” asks John Starbuck, “is the sixth-wicket partnership going to rescue 
England again?”
 
34th over: England 127-5 (Stokes 1, Bairstow 0) target 273 Mehedi now has four 
wickets in this spell and ten in the match. The one that got Cook didn’t seem 
to do much, but Rob Key spots that it was a slower ball – an even-slower ball. 
Teenage kicks are not what they were.
 
No doubt this time, as Cook pokes straight to silly point and perishes to a 
juggling catch. That’s 127-5 and Bangladesh appear to be racing to their first 
Test victory over England. But Stokes and Bairstow, so effective together, may 
have other ideas.
 
33rd over: England 126-4 (Cook 59, Stokes 0) target 273 After surviving 
Shuvagata’s fifth ball, Cook plays and misses at the sixth. When Duckett was 
there, England were making a molehill out of a mountain. Now they’re making a 
minefield.
 
Cook survives by a whisker, again. Fabulous drama.
 
For lbw against Cook, who could be in trouble.
 
32nd over: England 124-4 (Cook 57, Stokes 0) target 273 So it’s a 
double-wicket maiden from Mehedi, who is having a spectacular debut series - 16 
wickets at 17, and he is only 19. But Cook is still there and England have a 
near-reversible batting order...
 
Moeen has to go – it was clipping leg. Well bowled Mehedi, and that’s four 
wickets for 24 since tea. Another classic England collapse.

Mooen! Given lbw Mehedi. He reviews. 
 
Gary Ballance’s nightmare continues as he somehow turns a long hop into a 
leading edge and hands a simple catch to the man at mid-off. Game absolutely 
on. Ballance’s Test career, not so much.
 
31st over: England 124-2 (Cook 57, Ballance 5) target 273 Cook trundles on. 
 
30th over: England 118-2 (Cook 50, Ballance 5) target 273 So calm has broken 
out. But Bangladesh are still in with a very good chance.

“In answer to Ian Copestake and England supporters everywhere,” tweets Guy 
Hornsby, “WHAT HAVE I DONE?”

 
Cook plays a studious tuck into the leg side for two, and that’s his 52nd Test 
fifty – but his first of this series. Cometh the hour, cometh the Chef.
 
28th over: England 113-2 (Cook 47, Ballance 4) target 273 England break the 
chains, very gently, with three singles, all swept.

An unexpected request from Bill Walters. “Can the OBO page link to the match 
commentary tomorrow not include the match result please?” Ha.
 
27th over: England 110-2 (Cook 45, Ballance 3) target 273 Another maiden, from 
Mehedi to Balance. England are in danger of going into their shell.

An email from Michael Hunt. “Ignoring briefly that my phone wants to 
autocorrect ‘Duckett’ to ‘Sucker’,” he notes, “one thing very much in his 
favour has to be that ‘Duckett Wicket’ is sonically much more pleasing than the 
alternatives, no?” Yes, and so is Duckett whack it. He’s a cricketer who could 
have been dreamt up by Roald Dahl.
 
27th over: England 110-2 (Cook 45, Ballance 3) target 273 If Cook knows one 
thing after 135 Tests, it’s how to calm things down. He plays out a maiden over 
from Shakib which would have gone for 20 if Duckett had still been with us.
 
26th over: England 110-2 (Cook 45, Ballance 3) target 273 High drama in Dhaka: 
that may have been the moment this Test turned on. “Fine margins,” mutter the 
commentators, and although it’s a cliche, it’s never been truer. The one that 
got Root was only brushing leg stump; the one that didn’t get Cook was only 
just missing it.
 
It’s umpire Dharmasena, and he took a long time to raise the finger ... and 
Cook survives – it was missing leg. Great review.
 
Given lbw, sweeping at Mehedi. He reviews.
 
25th over: England 108-2 (Cook 44, Ballance 2) target 273 In comes Gary 
Ballance, who’s been hopeless so far – though, to be fair, he is just as busy 
as Root, looking for singles, and he has already outlasted him.

“I can almost see,” says Ian Copestake, “how Guy Hornsby is feeling right now.”
 
Pinned lbw by Taijul’s arm ball. Root could have reviewed but didn’t, perhaps 
cowed by England’s abysmal reviewing earlier. He’s out for 1 and it’s game on.
 
24th over: England 105-1 (Cook 43, Root 1) target 273 Duckett is gone, but his 
spirit remains. Joe Root is instantly busy, shovelling into the gap at wide 
mid-on for a single, and Cook gets four more with yet another sweep. He’ll be 
reverse-sweeping before long.
 
First ball after tea, Duckett gets a grubber from Mehedi and he’s bowled. 
England 100-1. Still a fine innings and a great start to the run chase.
