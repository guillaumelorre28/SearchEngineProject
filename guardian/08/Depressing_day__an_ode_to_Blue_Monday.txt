A song about Blue Monday <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(date)>, 
to the tune ofNew Order’s Blue Monday 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYH8DsU2WCk>. Because you can never have 
enough Blue Monday. Apparently.

Dear Blue Monday… [Clears throat] 


How does it feel 
To treat people like you do 
When you’ve sprayed your guff upon us  
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/beat-blue-monday-25-ways-9627416>
And told us to be blue 


I thought surely I was mistaken 
I thought the claims absurd  
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/jan/19/blue-monday-most-depressing-day-year>
To tell me how I should feel <http://www.allaboutdepression.com/cau_04.html> 
Tell us all how we should feel  <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19967037>


How does it feel 
To dictate the national mood  
<https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/measuringnationalwellbeing/2015-09-23>
Based on nothing of substance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/jan/21/blue-monday-depressing-day-nonsense-science>
Just a need to be in the news 
<http://www.badscience.net/2014/01/blue-monday-is-churnalism-heres-me-shouting-about-it-at-npr-on-the-media/>


I’d hoped I was mistaken 
I thought I’d misheard the words 
But you tell me how I should feel 
Tell us all how we should feel 


It’s been pointed out before now 
It’s just a campaign to plug vacations  <http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6847012/>
During the quiet season 
But what the hell, it’s all content 


And I still find it so hard 
To swallow what is claimed 
But still you insists on saying 
Just how I should feel today 


I see a bull**it in the media 
I can and shall object 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/jan/19/blue-monday-most-depressing-day-year>
But if it wasn’t for my misfortune 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/jan/16/blue-monday-depressing-day-pseudoscience>
I’d be a calmer person today 


I still say you’re mistaken 
I think your claims absurd 
To tell me how I should feel 
Tell us all how we should feel

read this far and still don’t know what it is, there’s not really a lot of
