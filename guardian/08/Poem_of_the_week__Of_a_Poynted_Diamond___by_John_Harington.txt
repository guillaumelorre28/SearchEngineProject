Of a Poynted Diamond given by the Author to his Wife, at the Birth of his 
Eldest Son


Deare, I to thee this diamond commend, 
In which a modell of thyself I send. 
How just unto thy joints this circlet sitteth, 
So just thy face and shape my fancy fitteth. 
The touch will try this ring of purest gold, 
My touch tries thee, as pure though softer mold. 
That metal precious is, the stone is true, 
As true, and then how much more precious, you. 
The gem is cleare, and hath nor needes no foyle, 
Thy face, nay more, thy fame is free from soil. 
Youle deem this deere, because from me you have it, 
I deem your faith more deer, because you gave it. 
This pointed Diamond cuts glass and Steele, 
Your love’s like force in my firme heart I feele. 
But this, as all things else, time wastes with wearing, 
Where you my jewels multiply with bearing.

Of a Poynted Diamond … is one of a substantial body of epigrams composed by 
Elizabeth I’s “saucy godson” <https://www.pinterest.com/pin/397653842069471252/>
, the courtier and knight,Sir John Harington 
<http://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Harington> (sometimes misspelt 
Harrington).

 Sir John is likely to be remembered today for two particular achievements. 
One is literary: he wrote the first English translation of Ariosto’s epic poem
Orlando Furioso 
<https://archive.org/stream/orlandofurioso01arioiala/orlandofurioso01arioiala_djvu.txt>
. It was a punishment task: Elizabeth had heard him amusing the court maidens 
with a ribald episode from the same work, and, sensing a personal insult, 
banished the poet from court until he’d finished translating the entire epic.

 His other famous work, also undertaken during the banishment, was the 
invention of the flush lavatory. When people in the US say they’re going to the 
john, they are apparently commemorating Harington. The invention spurred him on 
to further literary production, with A New Discourse on a Stale Subject, Called 
The Metamorphosis of Ajax (ie “a jakes 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vBJJAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA389&lpg=PA389&dq=%E2%80%9Ca+jakes%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=MmtlR5_Qr6&sig=hO9ujqyqlCUpqe6kgg11ExHBkeU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7ksG6l5PNAhVlF8AKHTWLB_AQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9Ca%20jakes%E2%80%9D&f=false>
”). It wasno mere treatise on toilet design 
<http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi846.htm> but a moral defence of obscenity. It 
sounds admirable, like the man himself: I haven’t read it, yet, but it’s on my 
list.

 Celebrating the happiest and proudest of parental occasions, this week’s poem 
to Mary Rogers, whom Harington married in 1586, is a reminder of how close the 
Elizabethan epigram could be to the sonnet. Of course, the rhyming couplets are 
simple fare compared to the interlocked rhyme schemes a sonnet allows – and the 
argument, as a result, is less complex. But for quick, sparky play of paradox 
and antithesis, ordered by metaphor and warmed by affection and delight, 
Harington’s artful gift-note could hardly be improved.

 The first small oddity you might notice is the way the iambic pentameter 
insists on a three-syllable pronunciation of “diamond”: “di – a – mond”. This 
pronunciation, pedantic to modern ears, seems – once you get used to it – to 
add charm. It gives the reader extra time to see the diamond, sharpening the 
image and bringing a glimpse of its faceted complexity. It suggests the slow 
exquisiteness of the diamond-cutter’s craft.

 It appears that the point-cut diamond 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_cut> was old-fashioned even by John 
Harington’s time: more advanced cutting techniques were established in the 
second half of the 14th century Perhaps the ring John presented Mary was a 
family heirloom, or a piece prized for its old-fashioned simplicity. We know 
she must already have tried it on, because the poet notes the exactness of the 
fit in line three.

 His compliments are conventional enough, but because they’re tied faithfully 
and quite ingeniously into the diamond metaphor they evade the charge of 
platitude. The ring becomes “a modell” of the beloved woman. It will fit her 
finger as perfectly as she fits his fancy. The emphasis on “touch” in lines 
five and six is delicately sensuous. Could “the touch” in line five be a 
mis-transcription of “thy touch?” The latter might have emphasised the contrast.

 A somewhat convoluted pair of lines entwines the rare value of the gold and 
the authenticity of the diamond with those same virtues in human form: “That 
metal precious is, the stone is true, / As true, and then how much more 
precious, you.” The ensuing double-negative retains its rough-cut force: “and 
hath nor needes no foyle”. The Online Etymological Dictionary clarifies the 
likely meanings of “foil” in this context: “The sense of ‘one who enhances 
another by contrast’ (1580s) is from the practice of backing a gem with metal 
foil to make it shine more brilliantly. The meaning “light sword used in 
fencing” (1590s) could be from this sense, or fromfoil 
<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=foil&allowed_in_frame=0> (v).”

 A well-positioned pair of feminine endings in lines 11 and 12 sustains 
rhythmical variety and builds tension. This time, there’s a kind of chiasmus 
(“from me you have it” / “because you gave it”) and an unexpected eye-rhyme. An 
impression of shy verbal fondling, and even fumbling, is followed by a 
striking, even violent image of penetration: her love cuts his firm heart as a 
diamond cuts glass and steel. Emotions seem to be warming up. At last, subtly 
but sexily, the real reason for the celebration is broached.

 Harington loved a good pun and even a less good one (see “a jakes”) and there 
are many graceful examples of the device in Of a Pointed Diamond … The finest 
occur in the last couplet, which is really a two-part punchline, with a 
delicious play on the double meanings of “wearing” , “bearing” and “jewels”. At 
which point, I’m sure the lucky woman reading the poem would have flushed with 
pleasure…
