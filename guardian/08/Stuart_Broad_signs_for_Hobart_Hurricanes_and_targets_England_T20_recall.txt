 but made the last of his 56 T20 international appearances at the 2014 
tournament. Broad, who has also represented his country 121 times in one-day 
internationals, has spoken of his desire to force his way back into 
limited-overs contention and will now have the chance to impress the England 
selectors at BBL06 this winter.

“From a personal point of view the BBL looks like a fantastic competition to 
be involved in,” said Broad, who was part of the Nottinghamshire sideknocked 
out of the T20 Blast finals day by Northamptonshire yesterday

. “Australia is one of my favourite places to play – the pitches and the crowds 
make for great cricket and the atmosphere is fantastic.

“It has been really good to have a Hurricanes team-mate, Dan Christian, 
playing with me at Notts. He has been really positive about the Hobart 
Hurricanes and also the city of Hobart, which I’m looking forward to embracing.”

Broad, who featured for Notts Outlaws on T20 Blast finals day, will play 
alongside Kumar Sangakkara for a Hobart side that also includes George Bailey 
and Shaun Tait.

“Stuart Broad has an incredible record in all three formats and his knowledge 
of the game overall will be a huge asset for our bowling group,” said the 
Hurricanes coach, Damien Wright. “He will give us great firepower with the ball 
and will be a fantastic inclusion into our pace attack joining Tait, [Jake] 
Reed and [Sam] Rainbird.

“We now have two of the biggest names in our game playing for the Hobart 
Hurricanes and our members and fans should be extremely excited for BBL06.

“It was key to find someone who could contribute in a big way with the ball 
and we believe we’ve signed one of the very best to do this.

“He is a terrific fella who is determined to do well throughout the Big Bash 
as well as seeing this as a great opportunity to put himself back in contention 
for England in the shorter formats of the game.”
