Here at the Gaylord National Harbor Hotel in Maryland, which plays host to the 
Conservative Political Action Conference, there’s a lot of noisemaking and 
hardly a mention from the main stage of the party’s largest noisemaker:Donald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

The frontrunner for the Republican nomination isn’t scheduled to speak until 
Saturday morning and, though one might have expected to see a plethora of Make 
America Great Again hats at one of the country’s largest annual gathering of 
conservatives, his absence from the on-stage rhetoric and the dearth of obvious 
fans in the audience doesn’t seem like a coincidence.

Down in the exhibit hall, where attendees walk around gathering swag, cheap 
plastic sunglasses, big-eared Obama stress balls, and plastic bracelets 
announcing your opposition to marriage equality were the must-haves.

The conservative Liberty University is giving away earplugs – but their 
giveaway isn’t meant as a commentary on the party’s reaction to the frontrunner.

“I’d use them,” the gentleman manning the university’s booth in the loud 
conference hall said, waving his hand in the direction of some people shouting, 
“but I need to hear people to be able to talk to them.”

The lack of enthusiasm for Trump’s candidacy doesn’t mean that there isn’t an 
undercurrent of excitement at CPAC, which is using the slogan “Our time is 
now”. Down in the exhibit hall just before the lunch hour, some of the students 
and young people here as part of a large contingent from Turning Point USA 
<http://turningpointusa.net/our-mission/> turned up the music and started a 
dance party circle to the strains of LMFAO’s Party Rock Anthem and Taylor 
Swift’s 22 as the Heritage Foundation passed out free popcorn several feet away.

“Everybody better have a ‘Big Government Sucks’ sign!” the organizer shouted 
as more and more observers held up their phones to tape the 
maybe-not-so-impromptu dance party.

Law Enforcement Against Prohibition’s (Leap’s) Howard Wooldridge, another CPAC 
regular who is always quite visible in his cowboy hat and pro-marijuana 
legalization T-shirt, comes toCPAC <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cpac> 
for that youthful exuberance – and for how it influences the conservative 
movement’s acceptance of his cause.

“Young people are trending libertarian,” he said, explaining that, in his 
early days, he used to get a lot more pushback from conservatives when he said 
that marijuana legalization should be part of a conservative agenda “if you 
believe in freedom and less government intrusion”. Now, because of young 
people, “resistance is coming to a statistical zero.

William Temple says if Trump gets elected he will likely be impeached

While he spoke, a group of six young conservatives – one who said, under his 
breath, that he didn’t think of himself as a libertarian – lined up for 
pictures with Wooldridge. In terms of year-on-year visibility, Wooldridge and 
his pro-pot agenda are probably second only to William Temple, who shows up in 
colonial garb every year (and is, reportedly, not a Trump fan).

Ariel Kahane, a 44-year-old conservative activist from New York City who 
supports Cruz and is here on behalf of conservative congressional candidate 
Phil Rosenthal (who is challenging longtime incumbent Democrat Jerry Nadler), 
said of CPAC: “It’s always very young”, which he admitted sometimes makes him 
feel out of place.

Still, the conservative from liberal New York is used to that feeling. “I 
kinda feel left out” back home he said, as attendees of all ages streamed in 
and out of the main conference hall – which is why this is his 12th CPAC. “I 
love the gathering of conservatives and tea parties from all across the nation 
and the world.”

And while the Cruz-supporting Kahane admits that “Trump is making this a very 
exciting election,” others are less enthused about the long shadow the 
frontrunner currently casts over the movement and the conference.

In years past, it was the young – and, yes, libertarian contingent – that 
pushed Rand Paul to his CPAC straw poll wins, to the chagrin of more seasoned 
conservative activists. But, with Paul’s presidential campaign at an end, his 
Rand Pac booth was deserted except for a cut-out of the candidate.

There were cut-outs of all of the candidates, current and now-departed, 
scattered around the trade show floor; but only Ben Carson’srecently stalled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/02/ben-carson-political-path-forward-super-tuesday>
 campaign is still staffing their booth, though, doing a brisk business at a 
table decorated with items for sale.

Elsewhere, at a large booth aimed at highlighting and encouraging women’s 
participation in conservative politics, the sponsors were doing brisk sales in 
elephant-themed cotton ladies’ clothing (the skirts were quite popular), under 
T-shirts trumpeting the remaining male candidates for the Republican nominees 
and a lonely sweatshirt reading: “A woman’s place is in the House and in the 
Senate”.

At CPAC, where even policy disagreements are positioned as a competition in 
the marketplace of ideas, there’s a lot to be bought and sold – both on the 
main stage and in the convention hall. It remains to be seen whether the great 
salesman, Donald Trump, will on Saturday find the buyers he’s been coming here 
to court for many years. A lot of voters at CPAC, it seems, have their hands on 
their wallets whenever he opens his mouth.
