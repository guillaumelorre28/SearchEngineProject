Big Blue Marble Bookstore opened in November 2005. Owner Sheila Allen Avelin 
had long dreamed of opening a community-centred indie bookstore, like those 
which shaped her childhood in Washington D.C. Living in Madison, Wisconsin 
while her wife completed a graduate degree, Sheila went to work at Avol’s 
Bookstore to build her understanding of the business side of the book business. 
When they moved back to Philadelphia, Sheila chose the Mt. Airy section of 
NorthwestPhiladelphia <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia> 
because it was a neighbourhood of people with a “shop local” ethic and a 
community she wanted to live in and raise a child in, as well as being a few 
doors down from a long-established food co-op that would drive foot traffic to 
the store. Her daughter Zivia was born the spring before Big Blue Marble 
opened, and has grown up in the store.

Big Blue Marble is a lesbian-owned (and often lesbian-staffed) general 
interest store with a feminist, progressive slant. They specialise in 
children’s books, literary fiction, sci-fi, poetry, and YA, with strong 
showings in African-American non-fiction, history, contemporary politics and 
cookbooks. The core of Big Blue Marble Bookstore’s mission is to serve its 
diverse neighbourhood. In every part of their business, from the books they 
stock to the events they plan, they seek to represent the diversity of their 
neighbours.

If you had infinite space what would you add?

Sheila Allen Avelin (owner): A hot tub and a deck full of trees and hammocks.

Jennifer Woodfin (manager): More display space, and room for many more books 
to face out. I always want more books, more fun and clever little gifts, more 
customers...

Jennifer Sheffield (web manager): More events space so we can host authors who 
attract larger crowds.

Elliott batTzedek (events manager): A reading room for tweens and teens, with 
all the great chapter books and novels and comics and graphics and lots of 
furniture for slouching and reading. And a second room for writing classes.

Mariga Temple-West (bookseller): A big bright spacious staff lounge! And lots 
and lots of space for all kinds of creative displays.

Jane Easley (bookseller): For kids and teens, I would add more middle grade 
and YA historical fiction. I would include titles that are available in 
paperback that are not necessarily new, by perennially favourite authors like 
Avi, Nancy Farmer, Celia Rees (for girl pirates), Ann Rinaldi, Pam Munoz Ryan 
(Esperanza Rising), Mitali Perkins, and new authors, of course.

What do you do better than any other bookstore?

We host events and discussions with experts and activists that are urgent for 
our community.
Elliott batTzedek, events manager 
Jennifer W: We make people love Mt. Airy!

Jennifer S: We engage with our community, far beyond simply selling books.

Elliott: We host events and discussions that are urgent for our community and 
provide experts and activists who help customers understand complex issues. 
While we have plenty of readings of fiction and poetry, we also have authors, 
teachers, and leaders talking about the most important topics in our community: 
Palestine/Israel, global climate change, Syria, the school-to-prison pipeline, 
and the history of how black artists used plays about lynching to support and 
strengthen black communities during decades of terror – to name topics from 
just the last few months.

Mariga: We are really good at pinpointing exactly what a particular customer 
wants, not just what the store is trying to sell.

 Engaging with the community... Big Blue Marble bookshop. Photograph: Literary 
Hub 
Who’s your favourite regular?

Jennifer S: I once spent hours and hours preparing for a book talk featuring 
picture books with diverse families, including multi-racial families. Only one 
person showed up – but she was so engaged and excited that she demanded I 
create a written list and then bought every book on it.

Elliott: I keep track of parenting wins, such as the father whose 
four-year-old daughter was examining our display of censored books. “Do you 
know what these are?” he asked her. She shook her head no. “These are all books 
you will have read someday.” Also, a mother whose three-year-old was playing 
with our wooden toy castle. The girl was holding a piece with two sides, a 
floor, and a curtain across the third side. (It’s supposed to be a shower, 
though why a castle set has a shower is beyond any of us.) “Do you know what 
this is?” Mum asked. “A voting booth,” said the child with confidence. The 
three-year-old had already gone with her mums to vote!

What’s the craziest situation you’ve ever had to deal with in the store?

Jennifer S: The day the children’s book section downstairs suddenly flooded 
when the outside drains clogged up. A customer screamed for us when the water 
rushed in, and we went running for help to the co-op next door. They came with 
a pump and hoses and buckets and shovels.

Elliott: The evening a neighbor came to launch his short story collection and 
70 people showed up. We had standing room only on the first and second floors 
and the staircases. He kept bringing more of his books in boxes from his car as 
we sold product that hadn’t been received and left the Booklog mess for the 
next day.

Sheila: Deciding to open a business and have a child in the same year. My 
daughter was born in the spring and the store opened in the fall, and I 
strongly advise against doing both of those things at once!

What’s your earliest/best memory about visiting a bookstore as a child?

Jennifer W: As a young teen my parents had given up on keeping track of what I 
had read and wanted to read, so they gave me book money instead. I took my $30 
to the bookstore and it was glorious – $30 bought a huge pile of paperbacks, 
and I spent hours picking exactly what I wanted.

Jennifer S: My memories were always libraries, not bookstores – the room full 
of books neatly on shelves in order and the endless range of stories.

Elliott: My small towns and the ones surrounding it didn’t have bookstores, so 
I grew up in the library. My first visit to a bookstore was a Christian 
bookstore 20 miles away which I coaxed my mum into driving me to because I was 
in desperate need a map of Narnia and they sold such things.

If you weren’t running or working at a bookstore, what would you be doing?

Jennifer W: Coming to the bookstore and buying the books, pestering the 
bookstore owner about what she should be carrying. After that I’d be in a 
hammock, reading.

Sheila: With my actual skill set I’d be an office manager staring at databases 
all day. In my dreams, I’d be a textile artist living off the grid and baking 
my own bread.

Jennifer S: I’d be editing and proofreading and wondering how I could get a 
job at a bookstore.

Elliott: I have BAs in Literature and Creative Writing, an MS in Women’s 
Studies, and an MFA in Poetry and Poetry in Translation. Where but a bookstore 
would I possibly be working?

What’s been the biggest surprise about running a bookstore?

Elliott: The biggest unpleasant surprise has been watching parents make a 
complete mess in the kids’ section and then just walk away. Kids make small 
messes – it’s the parents who open packages and break apart sets and spill 
coffee and then leave.

Jennifer W: At my first bookstore job I had to be there really early because 
we sold newspapers, and we made most of our money on porn magazines, so I found 
myself stocking titles I couldn’t believe existed. Here at Big Blue Marble 
we’re feminist and family-oriented, and open at 10 am, so both those unpleasant 
surprises have gone away.

Jennifer S: The best surprise has been the connections the staff and community 
builds with authors. Authors have become as much a part of the life of the 
store as the readers and staff.

The staff shelf

What are Big Blue Marble’s booksellers reading?

 * Lab Girl by Hope Jahren (2016). Jennifer Woodfin (manager) recommends: 
“This book is so beautifully written it makes me want to grab other people and 
read sections out loud to them. It also makes me laugh out loud. I like science 
and science writing, but she’s something more here, capturing the everyday slog 
of actually doing science.” 
 * Franklinstein by Susan Landers (2016). Elliott battTzedek (events manager) 
recommends: “Set in Germantown, the next neighbourhood over, this hybrid 
collection of poetry and prose explores a complex geography of colonialism, 
racism and the memory of a beloved childhood home. And it is sourced in both 
The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin and Gertrude Stein’s The Making of 
Americans. And the title is a brilliant pun. Franklinstein is the best of 
en-placed writing, showing us the entire world in the most specific of places.” 
 * Dietland by Sarai Walker (2015). Sarah Sawyers-Lovett (Queer Literary 
Alliance Book Club Coordinator) recommends: “This is the story of Plum Kettle, 
an advice columnist who is waiting for bariatric surgery for her life to begin. 
It’s also the story of Jennifer, a radical feminist counterterrorist group 
which changes Plum’s life forever. I can’t recommend this enough.”
