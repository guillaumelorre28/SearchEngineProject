Tiger Woods <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tigerwoods> said on Monday he 
is making progress in his recovery from back surgery but still does not have a 
date in mind for his return.

Woods hit a ceremonial shot at Congressional on Monday but found the water 
three times, showing that a return at the US Open –a tournament he has 
registered for

 – appears unlikely. “I have been practicing at home, and I’m progressing 
nicely. I’m hoping to play,” Woods said. “That’s the overriding question I keep 
hearing: when are you coming back, when are you playing? I get it all the time. 
If I knew, I’d tell you, because it’d be fun to know.”

The 40-year-old has not played tournament golf since last August after a 
series of surgeries on his back, and last won a major in 2008. He is now 
outside the world top 500.

Woods confirmed that he has played casual games at Medalist, a club near his 
home in Florida, but is far from the level where he can compete against the 
world’s best.

“Everything about my game is coming around. Now it’s just a matter of being 
consistent with it,” Woods said. “And then being able to do that not only at 
home against the boys at Medalist and trying to take their cash, but trying to 
come out here and doing it against the best players in the world is a 
completely different deal.”
