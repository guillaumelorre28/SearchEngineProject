What kind of year will 2017 be? In terms of politics, there are certain key 
dates: 20 January, Donald Trump’s inauguration; ‘the end of March’, by which 
time Theresa May’s government is expected to trigger article 50 and the 
beginning of the Brexit process; 7 May 2017, by which time we should know if 
Marine Le Pen has managed to secure the French presidency.


We asked our readers to make predictions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/13/what-are-your-hopes-and-fears-for-2017>
 for the year ahead. Some of these were optimistic and hopeful. Others were 
less so.


Below, we present ten of the more interesting reader punts on how 2017 will 
unfold in their countries. As requested by the readers concerned, each view has 
been presented anonymously.

 Will article 50 be triggered? Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA 
Brexit will not happen. Process to become bogged down in negotiations in 
Europe, court cases, political debate at Westminister and regional governments. 
This will force a general election which will lead into a bitter coalition. The 
public will become even more apathetic.

2) It’ll be a bad year for Labour

 Would Labour under Corbyn struggle in a snap general election? Photograph: PA 
I think there will be a spring election and Labour will be seriously damaged 
with heavy losses. However, Jeremy Corbyn will refuse to resign triggering a 
deeper crisis for Labour. The Conservatives will secure a huge majority, but 
the picture will be mixed with the other parties. UKIP will gain a handful of 
seats. The Lib Dems will do well in university towns and cities.


3) We’ll see a continued rise in nationalism

The twin forces of increased refugee emergencies and increased nationalist 
tendencies will continue. Violence and environmental degradation will push 
people toward richer, more developed nations who will in turn seek ways to 
limit how many “others” are allowed in.

4) Marine Le Pen will win - and trigger chaos

I’m very concerned about the election of Marine Le Pen in France. She poses a 
significant threat to the stability of France and the wider world. We play at 
extremist politics in the UK, the Front National is a very scary prospect.

year. Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images 
We will have federal elections in upcoming September 2017 and the far-right 
party AfD is polling very high which angers and frightens me a lot. After 12 
years in office, Angela Merkel seems vulnerable to me. I’m therefore rooting 
for a coalition change which favours my party the SPD in a strong coalition 
with The Greens and the Left in order to restore some sanity to the German 
political discourse and to dismantle the appeal of the AfD by introducing 
social policies which actually improve people’s lives and don’t put them in 
danger.

6) We’ll see significant progress in tackling climate change

Despite Trump’s climate scepticism there will be a broad international push to 
combat climate change. This push will not just be political, but mostly from 
companies that will increasingly see the value of investing in sustainable 
energy

Trump will very quickly alienate world leaders, including Putin, which will 
feel very scary. America will lose influence to the Chinese and Russians, who 
will gain significant momentum.

In Turkey, I expect to see further repression by Erdoğan, especially of the 
Kurds, curbing of free speech, a major break away from earlier ambitions to 
join the European Community and the growth of dissent among large numbers of 
the Turkish population.

 Abortion will dominate the public discourse and an ugly campaign is coming. 
There is every likelihood that the FF-FG pact will collapse around some issue 
so an election is reasonably likely, depending on how well equipped both are to 
go to the polls. Brexit will also be front and centre for Ireland as we try to 
fight a hard border with the North and protect our exports to Britain.

 In the Philippines, there will be an ongoing slaughter of poor people caught 
up in the drugs trade. Duterte wishes to impose his moral code on the people 
without providing resources to reduce poverty, improve education and increase 
jobs. He has total control of the media, armed forces and police.
