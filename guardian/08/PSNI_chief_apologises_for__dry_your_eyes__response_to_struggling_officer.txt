Northern Ireland’s police chief has apologised for suggesting officers 
overwhelmed by the job should “dry your eyes” or “move on”.


On Saturday night chief constable George Hamilton responded to a Twitter user 
– apparently a police officer who says he lives with depression and pain – who 
complained that police were expected to be social workers, paramedics and child 
minders as well.

“I know – more complex & challenging but we are here to serve so let’s get on 
with it rather than wallowing in self-pity!” Hamilton replied.

When the man denied he was wallowing in self-pity, Hamilton tweeted: “Well 
you’re allowed to leave & seek another job – nobody is asking you to stay. Dry 
your eyes, do the job or move on!”

The Police Federation for Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland>, which represents more than 
10,000 PSNI officers, accused Hamilton of a “stunning misjudgment” and demanded 
an apology.

On Sunday afternoon Hamilton posted a video 
<https://twitter.com/ChiefConPSNI/status/767346019642245120> of himself saying 
sorry. He said: “Last night’s frank Twitter conversation was what the police 
actually do; however, such important issues are not best dealt with in the 140 
characters of a tweet. I’ve clearly caused some offence in what I’ve said and 
for that I apologise.

“You see, I’m hugely proud of the officers and staff who go out and serve the 
public every day. I want to encourage and support them and I accept that my 
comments last night would have not have conveyed that support. For that I’m 
sorry.”

Mark Lindsay, chairman of the Policing Federation of Northern Ireland, said 
the pressures endured by officers were “nothing short of monstrous”.

He said: “The chief constable knows the extent of the problem – we have 
highlighted it often enough – which makes his remarks all the more bewildering. 
It shows how out of touch he is with his own officers, and that is deeply 
disappointing.”

Lindsay said officers were grappling with psychological conditions because of 
the things they experienced and witnessed in the line of duty.

“To cap it all, we have a chief constable who tells the men and women he 
commands that if they don’t like it, they can leave and get another job,” he 
said. “Mr Hamilton has got this badly wrong. To say to officers to ‘dry your 
eyes, do the job or move on’ amounts to great insult and a stunning 
misjudgment.”

Doug Beattie, the Ulster Unionists’ justice spokesman, said he was 
disappointed by Hamilton’s remarks.

“There are genuine concerns within the rank and file of the Northern Ireland 
police service that officers are being used to fill the gaps that other 
services should be filling,” he said. “That includes being a medical first 
responder, dealing with mental health and social service issues, and all while 
delivering policing services within our communities fragmented by terrorism, 
paramilitary activity and a divided society.

“He [Hamilton] has a difficult task on his hands with an ever-decreasing 
budget and political masters who are slow to make decisions. But there comes a 
time when he must say enough is enough and stand up for his officers when they 
raise genuine concerns.

“I hope he reflects on his poorly formulated tweet, deletes it and makes it 
known that he is not a ‘carry on regardless’ chief constable but a man of 
integrity who will not allow our service to degrade to little more than a 
political football.”
