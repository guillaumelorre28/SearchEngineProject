Everyman Bistro

A Liverpool institution, the Everyman Theatre – which launched the careers of 
Bill Nighy, Julie Walters, Pete Postlethwaite and Antony Sher – reopened in 
February after a £27m refurbishment … in fact, a complete rebuild. Downstairs, 
the bistro and bar attracts a diverse local crowd, as well as more serious 
theatre-goers. The bistro has tables and banquettes with adjustable lights that 
can be moved up and down to suit diners' moods and the bars are made from old 
school chemistry desks. The Wi-Fi is second to none, which is important in a 
city where bars don't take it seriously enough.

Motel

A new addition to Liverpool's bar scene is Motel, where the cocktails are 
good, the staff are friendly and the jukebox is full. The owners used to run
Korova <http://www.korova-liverpool.com/> – in my opinion Liverpool's (and the 
north-west's) best bar. The rough-but-polished industrial feel of the place 
almost makes you forget where you are and, after several of its strong 
cocktails, you definitely will.

District

This was the first venue in the city's Baltic Triangle 
<http://www.liverpoolbaltictriangle.co.uk/> – once the city's workshop, now its 
self-styled creative hub. District is run by Jayne Casey, of Big In Japan fame, 
and brings some amazing live acts to an area densely populated by electronic 
music nights. Set in a warehouse shed, it's actually a lot more prepared for 
every event(uality) than others in the area and with a much more permanent 
feel. The drinks menu is varied and the outdoor space is an attractive and 
comfortable addition. The capacity is small so don't expect to see Kings of 
Leon play, but the selection policy is very tight and the quality is high.

Another addition to the Baltic Triangle, 24 Kitchen Street is a multi-purpose 
events venue – electronic music, arts and a new gallery – offering a cosier 
experience to the usual warehouse space. The converted Victorian industrial 
building has only recently opened, and the DIY approach to design is proving 
popular with new local electronic music promoters and DJs.

The Kazimier

Offering an artistic and musical experience in the city centre, the Kazimier 
started as a temporary project but is now five years old. Its gardens offer a 
sublime refuge in the chaotic centre of Liverpool's nightlife venues. Loved for 
its unique dining, cinematic and music offerings – alongside real wood fires 
and lush greenery – its programme is diverse and accessible.

Constellations
 Art by: Cranio 
One to watch in 2014… Constellations will offer a long overdue outdoor events 
space in the now-thriving neighbourhood of the Baltic Triangle. A hidden garden 
space – due to open its gates this summer – it will offer a green haven in a 
former recycling yard. This temporary events space is keeping its cards close 
to its chest but promises a festival experience in the heart of the city.

Berry & Rye

Knock on the door of this supposedly closed shopfront on Berry Street and a 
man will open a curtain. If he likes what he sees – and there's space inside – 
you're in. Once inside, you'll be ensconced in the city's smallest bar with 
top-notch table service, serious cocktails and intimate musical offerings.

Mon-Sat 5pm-2am, Sun 7pm-1am

Santa Chupitos

The cocktails at Santa's may look like novelty items but the bartenders take 
their business seriously while managing to have a bit of fun. You'll be hard 
pushed to find a table due to the bar's popularity but the buzzing atmosphere 
(every night of the week) more than makes up for it. There is a small smoking 
area out back that, for some, will make the perfect place to sit and chat until 
the wee hours.

daily Mon-Wed 5pm-2am, Thurs and Sun 5pm-3am, Fri-Sat 5pm-4am

Peter Kavanagh's

On the outskirts of Liverpool's Georgian Quarter (Liverpool has the most 
Georgian buildings in the country outside London) is Peter Kavanagh's. The 
unique pub interior is the result of an eccentric refitting in 1929 by Peter 
himself. There's a main bar with a mosaic floor, a panelled bar front with a 
copper top, and a large collection of knick-knacks hanging from the ceiling, 
and two snugs – in true northern tradition. Each room has a log fire, and the 
snugs are decorated with magnificent wall paintings.

Liverpool's best "proper" beer garden. The atmosphere is at its best in summer 
when people chase the sun around the garden. The decor and furniture can hardly 
have changed since it opened 150 years ago, and rumour has it this was John and 
Cynthia Lennon's favourite watering hole when they were at art college.
