Christina saw the glossy brown crust of it and her blue eyes widened like a 
child’s. There was only one thing to do with a cake like that, she said, and 
that was to toast it... The cake toasted quickly. With careful fingers they 
turned their slices, then loaded on the butter, holding plates beneath their 
chins as they ate, to catch the greasy drips.

I have always lived north of the river. In Brisbane, we talked often of ‘the 
southside’ and made regular trips to visit cousins, family friends and a cinema 
or two. But we always lived north. When I moved to London, though my dear 
friend Reills had taken up residence in Clapham mere months before, I found 
home in East London - first in Whitechapel and later in Hackney. I crossed the 
river for work on the South Bank, to visit markets and to see friends. But I 
knew East London like the back of my hand. I hardly ever left.

Then, in February this year, I moved to Clapham and, for the first time in my 
life, I became ‘a southsider’. I swam at Brockwell Lido, discovered Battersea 
Park and ate in Dulwich restaurants. London is so large, and sprawling, that it 
occasionally feels as if I’ve moved to an entirely new city. Eight months in, I 
still take wrong turns, happen across new streets, and wind up on corners I’ve 
never been before. I stare out the window when on buses, taking in the lay of 
the land and linking up these places that, for so long, have been little more 
than stops at the other end of the Overground.

I have always been thrilled by mentions in books to places I know. So many are 
written about characters who wander the same streets of London as us, just 
decades and worlds apart from us. Reading is a unique way to come to know a new 
area and when I settled in with The Paying Guests earlier this week, I read 
about characters visiting places that I have only recently discovered myself. I 
found that I could picture their world in a way I couldn’t have a year ago; the 
view of Crystal Palace, the walk around Ruskin Park, parties in Clapham. As with

 earlier this year, I can’t quite believe I have only just started reading 
Sarah Waters’ novels. I am pleased, however, that that she has arrived on my 
bookshelves at a time when I am exploring the London that she is writing about.

This currant loaf is described in the book as both a cake and a bread. The 
line between the two is a tricky one to draw, but for the loaf to be toasted on 
a fork in front of the fire, it needs to be pretty robust - too cake-like, and 
it will crumble. So this is a brioche dough, enriched with eggs, milk, butter, 
and treacle. It’s soft and sweet, but will stand up to your toaster (or an open 
flame).

Currant Loaf

Cuts into 10 slices

Ingredients 
500g strong bread four 
10g fast action yeast 
1tsp salt
 20g caster sugar 
2tbsp treacle 
250ml milk 
2 eggs 
100g unsalted butter, at room temperature 
150g currants
 1tsp ground cinnamon 
1/2tsp ground nutmeg 
1 egg white

Equipment 
Mixing bowl or mixer with a dough hook 
Spatula 
Cling film 
Loaf tin (at least 20cm long) 
Greaseproof paper 
Pastry brush

1. Tip the flour into the mixing bowl, then add the yeast on one side and the 
salt on the other, to keep them apart for as long as possible. Add the sugar, 
treacle, milk, and eggs, and stir or mix to combine. Continue mixing until the 
dough is smooth, and elastic. If kneading by hand, this will take around ten 
minutes, or five with a dough hook in a mixer.

2. While continuing to knead or mix, gradually add in small clumps of the 
butter. Once it is all added, your dough should be very smooth, soft and 
elastic. Shape it into a ball, place in the bowl and cover with cling film. 
Leave to rise until doubled in size - around two hours. Eggs, milk and butter 
slow down the rise, so don’t rush it.

3. Once the dough has risen, and springs back when you give it a gentle prod, 
fold in the currants and spices until they are evenly distributed. Knead again 
for a couple of minutes, then shape into a loaf, flip over so any seam is on 
the base, and place into a loaf tin lined with greaseproof paper. Cover the 
loaf again and leave to rise until the dough springs back, which should be 
around an hour. A little before the loaf is ready, preheat the oven to 190C.

4. Beat the egg white until foamy, and then paint it onto the top of the loaf. 
Transfer to the oven, on a low shelf. Bake for forty to forty-five minutes 
until glossy and brown on top, and hollow sounding when knocked on the base. 
Put the loaf on a rack to cool. It’s lovely still warm from the oven, with 
butter, but try to leave it a couple of hours before toasting it, as it will be 
quite soft.
