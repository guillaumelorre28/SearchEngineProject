‘Is there, by chance, any of Mrs Glover’s excellent piccalilli?’ ... He 
smeared the piccalilli on to buttered bread and topped it with a thick slice of 
fatty ham. .. ‘It’s Mrs Glover,’ she said, as if reading his mind. ‘So it is. 
She of the excellent pickles.’

In 2010, I looked at my bank account two months before Christmas and wondered 
how on earth I was going to afford to get through the season that year. I love 
buying gifts, and wrapping them (in brown paper with string) while watching The 
Sound of Music, but I had just started a new job, and hadn’t been paid in a 
couple of months. I was new here, and couldn’t bear the thought of arriving to 
Christmas events empty handed. Thankfully, I quickly realised that while I may 
have been cash poor, I was time rich; I didn’t have £100 to splash about on 
Oxford St, but I did have a weekend, a saucepan and £10 to stock up on Ridley 
Road Market.

It was the beginning of what became a yearly ritual: buying bowls of fruit or 
vegetables for a pound, preserving them in sugar and vinegar, and lining my 
hall cupboard with homemade gifts. I played with recipes for jams, marmalades, 
chutneys, pickles, cordials and spice mixes, adding more to my list of 
favourites each year. I started hoarding nice jars and bottles in January every 
year, hidden away in cardboard boxes under my bed. I remained on the hunt for 
new recipes and ideas, and often started my batch cooking as early as September.

I’m no longer in that same flat, with that same box of jars, but as September 
approaches, my mind has turned to preserving - and attempting to capture the 
summer while it is still here on the greengrocer’s shelves.

I have rarely found a pickle or chutney I don’t like, but I do have a special 
soft spot for piccalilli. It combines lots of things I really love: mustardy 
heat, Indian spicing and still-crunchy vegetables. To retain their bite, the 
vegetables are chopped into relatively large chunks, and only cooked for a 
brief time. Though it is perfect with a ploughman’s lunch or a raised pie, 
eaten outdoors in the height of summer, it also works a treat on a winter 
cheese board, or (even better) a Christmas leftovers sandwich.

When I came across it in Kate Atkinson’s Life After Life (early on, and then 
over and over again, as we continue to return to the night that Ursula is 
born), I wanted to be there, eating it with a thick slice of ham in January. 
Ideally, if you want to give jars of this away at Christmas, you should make it 
in late September, and leave the flavours to mingle for three months. Of 
course, if you can’t wait until winter, I’d completely understand.

1. First, prepare the vegetables. They should all be roughly the same size, 
about a centimetre squared. Slice the peeled shallots into four or so pieces, 
slice the beans, chop the cauliflower florets off the stalks, slice the 
cucumber and carrot into even lengths, and then dice.

2. Put the vegetables into a mixing bowl. Sprinkle the salt on top, and toss 
through. Cover with a tea towel and leave in a cool place overnight.

3. Transfer the vegetables into the sieve and rinse very well under cold 
running water for five minutes to get rid of the salt. Pour the vinegar and 
spices into the saucepan, and bring to a simmer. Tip in the rinsed vegetables, 
and simmer for ten minutes. Piccalilli is not chutney; it should still have a 
bite to it, so don’t cook the vegetables for too long.

4. Scoop the vegetables out of the vinegar using the slotted spoon. and 
transfer them back to the mixing bowl. Leave the vinegar and spices in the 
saucepan. Pour the sugar into the vinegar and stir until dissolved.

5. Weigh the cornflour into the small bowl, and pour a couple of tablespoons 
of the vinegar in. Whisk until you have a smooth paste. Pour the paste into the 
simmering pot of vinegar, and whisk through. The mixture will thicken. Pour 
this over the vegetables, and stir it through.

6. Spoon the piccalilli into sterilised jars. Ideally, you should leave the 
jars for 1-3 months for the flavours to develop but, in the interests of full 
disclosure, I should mention that I have cracked into one of my jars already.
