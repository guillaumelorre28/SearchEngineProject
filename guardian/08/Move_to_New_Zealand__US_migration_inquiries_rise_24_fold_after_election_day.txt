The election of Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
as America’s next president has sent shockwaves around the globe – and resulted 
in a rush of interest from Americans in emigrating to New Zealand.

In the past 24 hours, the website of Immigration New Zealand (INZ) received 
56,300 visits from the US – a huge rise on its daily average of 2,300. Within 
the same period, more than 7,000 Americans registered interest in moving toNew 
Zealand <https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand>, which is more than 
double the monthly average.

Similar spikes of interest in New Zealand were noted by INZ from Britons in 
the months after Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/brexit-sparks-rush-for-new-zealand-as-emigration-inquiries-hit-record-high>
, with New Zealand seen as an ideal resettlement nation due to its shared 
cultural history with Britain.

The New Zealand Now website – which contains detailed information on living, 
working, studying and investing in New Zealand – received 70,500 visits from 
the US in the past 24 hours, or 69,000 more than its daily average.

The surge in interest from Americans in moving to New Zealand began a month 
before the US presidential election, with twice the level of activity seen 
compared with a year before.

New Zealand has already seen its highest levels of immigration on record in 
2016, and Kiwis were quick to take to Twitter and jokingly defend their borders.

Don't even think about moving to New Zealand. You shat the bed, now you have 
to deal with the mess.

And New Zealand’s media reflected much of the surprise, shock and sense of 
foreboding that featuredon front pages around the world
