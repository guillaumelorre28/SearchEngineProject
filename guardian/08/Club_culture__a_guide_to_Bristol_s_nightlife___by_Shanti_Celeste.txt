What makes Bristol’s nightlife scene so special?
Everyone knows each other. There’s one particular record shop, Idle Hands 
<http://www.idlehandsbristol.com/>, that people make for, and everyone goes to 
each other’s nights. It’s a tight music scene. There are also a lot of major 
DJs who live here and who are pioneers of certain styles. You could easily go 
to a club night and see someone you’ve admired for a long time DJing in a 
really small venue.

How does partying in Bristol compare with other cities?
The most dynamic, exciting parties happen in small pop-up venues, which people 
work really hard to find and licence for one night. They never do another party 
at that venue again. That’s where I think the city’s really good events are 
being put together.

Who are the new DJs and producers to listen out for?
If you’re after a more dubby or dubstep tip there’s Ishan Sound 
<https://soundcloud.com/ishan-sound>. Then there are all the Gorgon Sound 
<https://soundcloud.com/gorgonsound> people, such as Kahn and Neek, who are 
getting a bit bigger now. Then there’s Samuel on ourbrstl label 
<https://soundcloud.com/brstl> doing a more house-y thing. JayL and Andy Mac 
<https://soundcloud.com/fallingup> are definitely worth checking out, and Hodge 
<https://soundcloud.com/hodgebristol> is another important producer you need to 
keep your ears tuned to.

Where should you start your night?
I would go to the Bell pub <http://www.bell.butcombe.com/> on Hillgrove 
Street. It’s my favourite; it always has great music and DJs. It’s just a small 
place in the Stokes Croft area with an ace beer garden that’s a bit of a sun 
trap. It’s very traditional with good ale, not a swanky bar and the people who 
run it are lovely.

Where should you move on to for more of a party?
Motion <http://motionbristol.com/> is the biggest club in the city – you 
should check it out – but I actually prefer smaller venues:Cosies 
<http://www.cosies.co.uk/> is a bar/club where we do a lot of our nights. It 
has a small dance space so you could still have a dance if you wanted to, and 
you can stay there till 4am. TheLove Inn <http://theloveinn.com/>, which is 
owned by Team Love, which does Future Boogie and Love Saves the Day, should 
also be on your list. It’s their bar/club, which serves fabulous food during 
the day – and good cocktails, and a great sound system, at night.

What are the more alternative venues in Bristol?
The Island <http://www.theislandbristol.com/>, in the old police station, is a 
multi-use arts venue. It has loads of rooms and they sometimes open them up for 
club nights. There are others, such as the Old Crown Courts on Bridewell 
Street, too.

Which club nights are worth checking out?
The night that I go to every single time it’s on is Dirty Talk 
<https://www.facebook.com/dirtytalkDJ>. It’s always really good; they got a 
licence to do it in a Hells Angels’ pub a while ago, which was really big. You 
just had bikers walking about. Another good one isPeople Like Us 
<https://soundcloud.com/peoplelikeusdj>, then there’s Fallen Up 
<https://soundcloud.com/fallingup> and Stamp the Wax 
<http://www.stampthewax.com/>. You’ve also got the bigger ones such as Just Jack
 <https://www.facebook.com/justjackhousemusic>, Future Boogie 
<http://www.futureboogie.com/> and Shapes 
<https://www.facebook.com/shapesbristol>, who all book really fine people. If 
you like going to a big rave, they’re the ones to go to.
