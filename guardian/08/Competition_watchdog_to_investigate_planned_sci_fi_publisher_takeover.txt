The choice of reading material on offer to fans of science fiction could be 
unduly restricted by a merger between two publishers, competition regulators 
have said.

The Competition and Markets Authority is launching an “in-depth investigation” 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/specialist-magazines-merger-could-face-in-depth-investigation>
 into the planned takeover of Imagine Publishing, which produces SciFiNow, by 
SFX publisher Future.

The CMA said the magazines were the major titles in their subject matter, 
meaning that a merger could “lead to higher prices or a reduction in choice and 
quality for readers”.

Sheldon Mills, the CMA’s senior director of mergers, cast doubt on the two 
companies’ argument that the magazines are facing plenty of competition from 
online titles.

“We found some evidence in this case that readers and advertisers consider 
online content to be a good alternative to print magazines, but not in all 
areas,” he said.

“In sci-fi, the evidence pointed towards print magazines serving a distinct 
need for readers and so, unless this aspect of the merger is changed, the 
merger may increase the incentive to raise the price or reduce the quality of 
those magazine titles – particularly to the detriment of the readers.”

When the competition watchdog rules that a merger could significantly reduce 
competition, it often asks for the companies involved to make concessions to 
secure a deal.

This can result in one or both of them being told to sell assets if they want 
the tie-up to go ahead. The CMA only objected to the impact on the sci-fi 
sphere, but not to overlap in other areas.
