Murders in the US rose 10.8% last year, the biggest single-year percentage 
jump since 1971, according to data released Monday by theFBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi>.


The rising violence was driven by an increase in the murders of black men, and 
by an increase in the number of gun murders. At least 900 more black men were 
killed in 2015 than in 2014, according to FBI data.

There were roughly 1,500 additional firearm murders in 2015. No other type of 
weapon saw a comparable increase. The number of knife murders dropped slightly.

The percentage of murders committed with guns increased to 71.5%.

The net increase in murders, which follows a two-decade downward trend, erased 
the gains of the past few years, and put the number of murders back at 15,696, 
about the same number as in 2009. Murder and violent crime are still 
dramatically lower than they were at the peak of the violent crime wave of the 
late 1980s and early 1990s. The national murder rate last year was about half 
what it was in 1991.

Even as murders rose, the country’s overall crime rates did not increase as 
substantially. There was a 3.9% increase in the estimated number of violent 
crimes, but a 2.6% decrease in the estimated number of property crimes.

Speaking at a violence prevention conference in Little Rock, Arkansas, 
attorney general Loretta Lynch said that, despite an “overall increase” in 
violent crime, 2015 still represented “the third-lowest year for violent crime 
in the past two decades”.

Her prepared remarks did not mention the 10.8% increase in murders. 

“We still have so much work to do,” Lynch said. “But the report also reminds 
us of the progress that we are making. It shows that in many communities, crime 
has remained stable or even decreased from the historic lows reported in 2014.”

A third of the murder increase was driven by upticks in just ten larger 
cities: Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Washington DC, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, 
Nashville, Kansas City, Missouri, St Louis, and Oklahoma City.

Baltimore saw the greatest increase in murders, with 133 more people killed in 
2015 than in 2014, pushing the city to itshighest-ever murder rate 
<http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-deadliest-year-20160101-story.html>
. Some of America’s largest cities, including New York and Los Angeles, saw 
their murder numbers remain near historic lows in 2015.

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-african-american-communities-north-carolina>
that “our African American communities are in the worst shape they’ve ever been 
... ever. Ever. Ever.”

Despite steep declines in violence since the 1990s, though, the murder rate 
for black men and boys is still much higher than for other Americans, and it 
increased slightly last year, according to a Guardian analysis of FBI 
supplementary homicide data and census data. The supplementary homicide data 
includes a racial breakdown of murder victims submitted by most, but not all, 
law enforcement agencies.

In 2015, black men were about nine times more likely to be murdered than white 
men, and black women were three times more likely to be murdered than white 
women, according to the analysis.

 Compared with the early 1990s, when the biggest contributors to the crime 
increase were the country’s largest cities, “it’s slightly smaller cities that 
are having the biggest impact on rising murders”, said John Pfaff, a Fordham 
University law professor who studies criminal sentencing and incarceration. The 
10 cities that drove a third of the murder increase only account for 13% of 
total murders in the US, he noted.

There is no consensus yet on what factors might be driving a sharp increase in 
murders alone, but crime has become a politically charged election issue, and 
the uptick will probably figure in Monday’s presidential debate.

Crime trend experts said they expected politicians to overplay the 
significance of the new numbers and to react with “hysteria”.

“You lost 50lb. You gained back a couple. You’re not fat,” said Jeffrey Butts, 
the director of the Research & Evaluation Center at John Jay College of 
Criminal Justice. “That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t look at your behavior, 
because the trend is not good.”

In St Louis, which already had one of the highest murder rates in the US, 
murders increased again last year. Last year, 143 of the city’s murder victims 
were black men and boys killed with guns, according to data from the police 
department. Local residents were not optimistic that a debate over a national 
murder increase would make them safer.

“How do we use that data to elevate the consciousness of our community? How do 
we use that data to provide the opportunity for people to get meaningful jobs, 
with livable wages?” said Jeffrey Boyd, a St Louis alderman who has lost three 
young male relatives to gun violence since 2003.

“I have no confidence in our federal government that they will provide an 
extra dime for anything.”

Advocates for criminal justice reform said they worried the one-year uptick 
would fuel calls for a return to damaging, tough-on-crime policies. The US has
one of the highest incarceration rates 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/07/yes-u-s-locks-people-up-at-a-higher-rate-than-any-other-country/>
 in the world, and both violent crime and mass incarceration disproportionately 
affect black Americans.

The human cost of an overreaction to the murder increase could be “a lot 
bigger” than the toll of the rising violence itself, Pfaff said. He said he 
expected the increase to prompt calls for more arrests and more prison time.

The wealthier white Americans whose votes help determine crime policy “don’t 
tend to be those who feel the costs”, Pfaff said.



Early data from large cities this year suggests that 2015’s uptick in murders 
may not be a single-year increase. Areport from the Brennan Center 
<https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/crime-2016-preliminary-analysis>, 
analyzing murders in 30 large cities this year, projected an additional 13.1% 
increase in the murder rates for those cities in 2016, with most of that 
increase being driven by just three cities: Chicago, Baltimore and Houston. 
Together, the national large city increases in 2015 and 2016 were projected to 
drive a 31.5% increase in the murder rate compared with 2014.

“There is no evidence of a national murder wave, yet increases in these select 
cities are indeed a serious problem,” the Brennan Center report concluded. 
Chicago alone has seen a close to 50% increase in shootings and murders this 
year.

The FBI director, James Comey, has repeatedly drawn a connection between 
increasing violence and “a change in how the police are doing their work” due 
to the continuing nationwide protests over police killings of black citizens.

“In today’s YouTube world, are officers reluctant to get out of their cars and 
do the work that controls violent crime?” he asked in 2015, describing “a chill 
wind that has blown through law enforcement over the last year”.

In May, he suggested the increasing violence could be related to “marginal 
pullbacks by lots and lots of police officers”, and said that police leaders 
across the country had seen a change in how their officers do their jobs.

Barack Obama’s administration has repeatedly rejected any connection between 
protests over police violence and increasing murders. But a Justice 
Department-funded report on the 2015 murder increase concluded that theremight 
be some connection 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/15/ferguson-effect-homicide-rates-us-crime-study>
 between public anger over police killings and an increase in community 
violence.

Criminologists caution that crime and violence are highly local, and driven by 
a tangle of so many different factors that it is nearly impossible to say 
exactly what causes a given increase or decrease. Crime statistics are also 
easy to over-dramatize. Murder numbers in a small town, for instance, can be 
dramatically distorted by a single incident with multiple casualties. A town 
that typically sees a murder a year will see a 100% increase in murders if it 
ends the year with two.

New York City, which saw more than 2,000 murders a year in the early 1990s, 
saw just 352 last year, according to New York police department data. Los 
Angeles, which saw more than 1,000 murders a year in the early 1990s, has seen 
fewer than 300 in recent years.

Trump has blamed Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/trump-vision-of-violence-city-homicides-obama>
 and his administration for a “rollback of criminal enforcement” that has made 
the country less safe.

 This criticism is not supported by the FBI’s murder data. Murders have 
declined through most of Obama’s two terms, with a serious uptick only in his 
second-to-last year in office. Between 2008, the year before Obama took office, 
and 2014, murders dropped, with 2,000 fewer Americans murdered in 2014 than in 
the last year of George W Bush’s administration.

Crime experts also cautioned that a single-year uptick was not a trend. “It’s 
the curse of success. Because we’re doing better, a similar absolute change 
will look worse,” Pfaff said.

Despite a general downward trend over the past decades, nationwide murder 
numbers have increased in some recent years. In 2005, for instance, murders 
increased by 3.67%, according to FBI data, then increased a further 3% in 2006.

In October 2006, the Police Executive Research Forum released a report  
<http://www.policeforum.org/assets/docs/Critical_Issues_Series/a%20gathering%20storm%20-%20violent%20crime%20in%20america%202006.pdf>
warning the country about “a gathering storm of violent crime that threatens to 
erode the considerable crime reductions of the past”.


“Violent crime in many of the nation’s cities, from one coast to the other, 
has begun to spike upwards,” the report argued. “The percentage of violent 
crime in America had the largest single-year increase in 14 years.”

The next year, murders resumed a downward trend.

“Everyone started freaking out. It was a two-year thing,” Butts said.

Criminal justice reform is “one of the greatest civil rights efforts of our 
time”, said Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color of Change, the 
nation’s largest online racial justice organization.


Trump and other politicians, he said, “have started us down a path to undo 
long-fought gains in criminal justice reform, and we should not let the 
positive momentum be derailed by a lack of facts, by fear, by racism and by 
demagoguery”.

Even Heather Mac Donald, a conservative crime analyst who saluted Trump’s “law 
and order” focus, said in July that it wasinaccurate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/trump-vision-of-violence-city-homicides-obama>
 to blame federal crime policy for murder increases.

In general, the president and the federal government have very little power to 
determine the country’s response to crime and violence. The country has 18,000 
local law enforcement agencies of different kinds, including more than12,000 
local police departments <http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd13ppp.pdf>, 
which are largely independent from federal control. Most power to determine 
crime policy is in the hands of state legislators, and local mayors, police 
chiefs and prosecutors.


Trump and Clinton have outlined competing visions of violence prevention, with 
Trump touting a tough-on-crime approach, and Clinton focusing on the need to 
reform police treatment of black Americans and reduce gun violence through 
tougher gun control laws.

These contrasting views have symbolic importance, but neither Trump nor 
Clinton would have much direct influence, as president, over how cities and 
states address violence. The justice department can use federal funding as a 
carrot or stick for local departments to adopt different policies, but this is 
a fairly limited tool for pushing top-down changes.
