The FBI paid more than $1.3m to unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> 5C, but one computer scientist 
from Cambridge University has shown that the passcodes can be hacked using a 
store-bought kit worth less than $100.

Sergei Skorobogatov demonstrated a technique known as NAND mirroring – 
dismissed by the FBI director, James Comey, asbeing unworkable

 – to break into any model of iPhone up to the iPhone 6, including the iPhone 
5C. He outlined the attack in a paperpublished last week 
<http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04327> as well as a YouTube video.

The technique focuses on bypassing the limit on password retry attempts. 
Typically the iPhone will lock users out after six failed attempts to guess the 
passcode. In eliminating this restriction, anyone trying to break into an 
iPhone can run through many different combinations of characters until the 
phone is unlocked.

To achieve this, Skorobogatov soldered off the phone’s NAND chip, the main 
memory storage system used on manyApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> devices. The researcher was then 
able to reverse-engineer the way the memory system communicated with the phone 
to create a cloned version of the chip with the password attempt counter set to 
zero.

“Because I can create as many clones as I want, I can repeat the process many, 
many times until the passcode is found,” he explained in the video. Each run of 
six attempts takes around 90 seconds, so to go through a full cycle of all 
10,000 potential four-digit passcodes would take around 40 hours – less than 
two days. Cracking six-digit passcodes would take much longer.

The electrical components required for the attack can be bought online from 
eBay, Amazon or Alibaba for around £75 ($100), Skorobogatov claims in his 
research paper.

“The process does not require any expensive and sophisticated equipment. All 
needed parts are low cost and were obtained from local electronics 
distributors,” Skorobogatov said.

 A similar technique could also be used for newer models including the iPhone 
6S and iPhone 7, although “more sophisticated hardware will be required”, wrote 
Skorobogatov.

In April, Comey revealed that the FBI had paid about $1.3m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/29/fbi-bought-1m-iphone-5c-hack-but-doesnt-know-how-it-works>
 to a third party for software to hack into the iPhone of San Bernardino gunman 
Syed Farook. “It was, in my view, worth it,” he said.

At the time Apple had declined to help the bureau break into the phone, 
arguing it would require weakening the security of all iPhones. This led the US 
government to issue Apple with a court order to try to force the tech company 
to give so-called “backdoor access” into Farook’s phone, something Apple 
battled with a high-profile legal and PR campaign.

The US government subsequently dropped the case 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/28/apple-fbi-case-dropped-san-bernardino-iphone>
 after paying an undisclosed, specialist company to break into the phone.

Before gaining access to the phone and its contents, the FBI said it had 
considered many different techniques, including the NAND mirroring approach. 
“It doesn’t work,”said Comey 
<https://www.onthewire.io/comey-nand-mirroring-doesnt-work/> at the time. 
Skorobogatov had demonstrated that he was wrong.

“Skorobogatov was able to do what the FBI said was impossible,” said security 
and policy researcher Susan Landau in ablogpost 
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/securing-phones-and-securing-us-revisited 
https://www.lawfareblog.com/securing-phones-and-securing-us-revisited>. 

“The moral of the story? The solution is not, as the FBI has been saying, a 
bill to make it easier to access encrypted communications, as in the proposed 
revisedBurr-Feinstein bill 
<https://www.justsecurity.org/32818/feinstein-burr-2-0-crypto-backdoor-bill-lives/>
. Such ‘solutions’ would make us less secure, not more so. Instead we need to 
increase law enforcement’s capabilities to handle encrypted communications and 
devices.”
