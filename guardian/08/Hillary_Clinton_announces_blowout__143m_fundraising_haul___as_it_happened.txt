Today in Campaign 2016

 * Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has had its best month ever, 
bringing in more than $143m in August for the campaign, as well as for the 
Democratic party. The campaign and allied action funds begin September with a 
more than $152 million war chest, built from donations from more than 2.3m 
people.

 * Lawyers for Melania Trump have filed suit against the Daily Mail in 
Maryland state court for publishing what Trump’s lawyer, Charles Harder, called 
“lies ... that Mrs. Trump supposedly was an ‘escort’ in the 1990s before she 
met her husband.” Harder said in a statement to reporters that these “actions 
are so egregious, malicious and harmful to Mrs. Trump that her damages are 
estimated at $150 million dollars”. 
 * “I think you’re going to see there’s really quite a bit of softening,” 
Trump tells conservative radio host Laura Ingraham this morning, vis-à-vis his 
immigration policy platform. 
 * To chants of “USA, USA, USA”, Trump took his nationalist message back to 
rustbelt later on Thursday at a lunchtime rally in Wilmington, Ohio. The state 
has been hit hard by a decline in manufacturing jobs and the campaign seeks to 
weave together economic uncertainty with the uncompromising message on 
immigration. “We will treat everyone with compassion but our greatest 
compassion will be for the American citizen,” Trump told the almost entirely 
white audience. 
 * The Tampa Bay Times reports 
<http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/while-hillary-clinton-touts-51-florida-field-offices-donald-trump-still/2291861>
 that the Donald Trump campaign still has only one office open in the essential 
battleground state of Florida, despite a vow on 8 August by the campaign that 
it would open two dozen additional offices within two weeks. 
 * A leaked script of a question-and-answer session with the pastor of a 
predominantly African American church this weekend,obtained by the New York 
Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/us/politics/donald-trump-black-voters-wayne-jackson.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0>
, shows that Donald Trump’s campaign is taking little chance on letting the 
famously unscripted candidate put his foot in his mouth, writing suggested 
answers to questions on race in America provided to the campaign in advance.

Trump: 'We're going to sit back' and 'assess' future of undocumented immigrants

In an interview on Fox News, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has given more conditions for 
the legalization of undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United 
States, an issue around which he has not-so-delicately tiptoed in his alternate 
hardening and softening and hardening of his immigration platform.

“We are going to strengthen the border, make it really, really strong,” Trump 
told Fox News anchor Eric Bolling. “We are going to build the wall. We are 
going to get rid of all of the bad players that are here, the gang members, the 
gang leaders, the drug dealers, all of the cartel people. We are going to get 
them out of our country because they are causing tremendous damage and crime. 
And other things. And getting the drugs spread all over the place. They will be 
gone.”

“After that takes place - which will be a process, and it won’t go that 
quickly but it’s going to go as quickly as any human being can do it - after 
that takes place, we’re going to sit back, we’re going to assess the 
situation,” Trump continued.

“We’re going to see where we are because we’ll have people in the country 
that, you know, that have come in illegally. We’re going to sit back. We’re 
going to assess the situation. We’re going to make a decision at that time. I 
want to see, before we do anything further, I want to see how it shapes up when 
we have strong, and you know, I use the word ‘impenetrable’ borders but how it 
shapes up and I think we are getting really tremendous reviews on the plan.”

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told Fox News 
host Eric Bolling that a Latino journalist who has been critical of his stance 
on immigration only voices his criticisms because Trump has never appeared on 
his show.

“I think Jorge is actually a nice guy but I just don’t do his show,” Trump 
said of Univision anchor Jorge Ramos. “So, you know, if I did his show, I’m 
sure he would be very happy.”

In a conversation with Fox News host Eric Bolling, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told the host that his trip 
to Mexico was more highly covered than any presidential trip, and critiqued 
Hillary Clinton as being unable to merit nearly as much media attention through 
her tenure as secretary of state.

“I think we had a great meeting,” Trump said. “It was well-covered by, I 
guess, as much as anybody has ever been covered in one of those meetings. And, 
you know, I’m not even a president. I guess it was pretty unusual, because as a 
president you get this kind of coverage. Although they didn’t get as much.”

Of Clinton’s tweeted remark 
<https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/771156031401521153> that “diplomacy 
isn’t as easy as it seems,” as Bolling put it, (actually “as easy as it 
looks”), Trump was dismissive.

“As far as Hillary is concerned, learning, how has she done in Libya? How has 
she done in Iraq? How has she done with the Iran deal and all of the other 
things like she started - that horrible Iran deal that’s now blowing up all 
over the place, one of the worst deals ever negotiated?” Trump asked 
rhetorically.

“I mean, for her to be saying that and that’s just a sound bite given to her 
by her handlers. You know, she has got handlers. And that’s just a sound bite. 
No, we had an amazing day and I have been given great credit by almost 
everybody that’s fair. You know, I mean, the fair people give credit. The ones 
that aren’t and I know what’s good and bad. In other words, Eric, I will tell 
you if something wasn’t good. you know that. You know me.”

The Obama administration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/obama-administration> has denied claims by 
a Washington thinktank that Iran has secretly been granted exemptions to a 
multilateral nuclear agreement signed last July in Vienna.

Zarif. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/AFP/Getty Images 
A report 
<http://file///Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/JCPOA%20Exemptions%20Revealed_1Sept2016_Final1.pdf>
 by the Institute for Science and International Security alleged that a joint 
commission set up to implement the Vienna deal had allowed Iran to keep more 
than the agreed maximum of 300 kg of low enriched uranium (LEU) by excluding 
waste material in Iran’s nuclear facilities. If enriched further, LEU could be 
used in a nuclear warhead.

The institute’s director and co-author of the report, David Albright, said 
that this and other exemptions were granted by the commission in secret.

“One of the biggest problems is we are being denied information in these 
cases,” Albright said. “If the joint commission has so many powers to change 
this deal, shouldn’t we know what they’re doing?”

The state department denied that the 300 kg LEU limit set down in the 
agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), had 
been breached.

“There’s been no loosening of the commitments and Iran has not and will not 
under the JCPOA be allowed to exceed the limits that are spelled out in the 
JCPOA,” spokesman John Kirby said. He added the only violation of the terms of 
the deal had been a temporary surplus in Iran’s export of heavy water (which 
can be used in nuclear reactors to produce plutonium), but that had been 
corrected. Kirby also said the secrecy of the work of the joint commission, 
which represents all parties to the deal, was stipulated in last year’s deal, 
signed by six world powers (the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China), the 
EU andIran <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran>.

“This is in compliance with the JCPOA which says the commission’s work should 
be confidential unless all parties agree otherwise,” Kirby said.

Donald Trump has hired an old nemesis of the Clinton family as his deputy 
campaign manager,the Washington Post reports 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-enlists-veteran-operative-david-bossie-as-deputy-campaign-manager/?postshare=8581472768973983&tid=ss_tw>
.

David Bossie, who investigated Bill and Hillary Clinton’s finances in the 
1990s as a congressional staffer, was described by Trump to the Washington Post 
as “a friend of mine for many years. Solid. Smart. Loves politics, knows how to 
win.”

Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told the Washington Post that Bossie, 
who until this week served as president of anti-Obama advocacy group Citizens 
United, is “a battle-tested warrior and a brilliant strategist”.

“He’s a nuts-and-bolts tactician as well, who’s going to help us fully 
integrate our ground game and data operations, and help with overall strategy 
as my deputy.”

Bossie investigated the Clintons as part of his work for a special senate 
committee on the Whitewater controversy, which investigated real estate 
investments by the Clintons and their associates in the Whitewater Development 
Corporation, a failed vacation-home development corporation.

The Daily Mail has printed a retraction of its story 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3769798/Melania-Trump-retraction.html> 
detailing “troubling questions” about Melania Trump’s past.

“To the extent that anything in the Daily Mail’s article was interpreted as 
stating or suggesting that Mrs. Trump worked as an ‘escort’ or in the ‘sex 
business,’ that she had a ‘composite or presentation card for the sex 
business,’ or that either of the modeling agencies referenced in the article 
were engaged in these businesses, it is hereby retracted, and the Daily Mail 
newspaper regrets any such misinterpretation,” the retraction states.

Earlier today, lawyers for Trump filed suit against the Daily Mail in Maryland 
state court for publishing what Trump’s lawyer, Charles Harder, called “lies 
... that Mrs. Trump supposedly was an ‘escort’ in the 1990s before she met her 
husband.” Harder said in a statement to reporters that these “actions are so 
egregious, malicious and harmful to Mrs. Trump that her damages are estimated 
at $150 million dollars”.

The suit, filed in Montgomery County in suburban Washington DC, was filed in 
response to articles published in August by the Daily Mail which reported 
rumors that Melania Trump worked as an escort in the 1990s. Infirst announcing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/melania-trump-lawsuit-daily-mail>
 that she was considering a suit, Trump’s lawyer called those rumors “100% 
false”.

Leaked script: Donald Trump advised to tell African Americans US should 
'reduce' issue of race

A leaked script of a question-and-answer session with the pastor of a 
predominantly African American church this weekend,obtained by the New York 
Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/us/politics/donald-trump-black-voters-wayne-jackson.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0>
, shows that Donald Trump’s campaign is taking little chance on letting the 
famously unscripted candidate put his foot in his mouth, writing suggested 
answers to questions on race in America provided to the campaign in advance.

 When asked about his vision for black Americans, the script suggests that Mr. 
Trump stay positive, advising that he use lines such as ‘If we are to make 
America great again, we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in 
this country’ and ‘I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and 
governance.’


To a question submitted by Bishop Jackson about whether his campaign is 
racist, the script suggests that Mr. Trump avoid repeating the word, and 
instead speak about improving education and getting people off welfare and back 
to work. ‘The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding,’ Mr. Trump is advised 
to say. ‘Coming into a community is meaningless unless we offer an alternative 
to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass 
in America.’

Trump is also directed in the script to tell skeptical African American voters 
that his support is “up to 8% and climbing.”

Alfonso Aguilar, president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative 
Principles, has officially un-endorsed Donald Trump’s presidential bid after 
what he characterized as Trump’s “very scary speech” on immigration in Phoenix 
last night.

“I was critical of Mr Trump throughout the primary,” Aguilar told CNN’s Jake 
Tapper in an interview 
<http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/09/01/aguilar-dropping-support-donald-trump-immigration-lead-tapper-intv.cnn>
, but moved to support Trump because he felt that, “along with other Latino 
conservative leaders, that we could help Mr. Trump move towards the center.”

But after last night’s draconian address on immigration, in which Trump not 
only called for a “deportation task force” to hunt down undocumented immigrants 
but called for restrictions on legal immigration not seen in more than half a 
century, Aguilar feels “misled”.

“There’s nothing compassionate or human in his speech,” Aguilar said. “Not 
only did he double down on his proposals, I think they’re even worse.”

Positing that the speech was drafted by “the main anti-immigration groups,” 
Aguilar called the address “a nationalist, nativist speech, the kind of speech 
we would hear 100 years ago ... it was a very scary speech and, again, we 
thought that he was gonna move to the center. In a way, we fell that we were a 
little bit misled.”

Melania Trump sues Daily Mail for $150m

Lawyers for Melania Trump have filed suit against the Daily Mail in Maryland 
state court for publishing what Trump’s lawyer, Charles Harder, called “lies 
... that Mrs. Trump supposedly was an ‘escort’ in the 1990s before she met her 
husband.” Harder said in a statement to reporters that these “actions are so 
egregious, malicious and harmful to Mrs. Trump that her damages are estimated 
at $150 million dollars”.

The suit, filed in Montgomery County in suburban Washington DC, was filed in 
response to articles published in August by the Daily Mail which reported 
rumors that Melania Trump worked as an escort in the 1990s. Infirst announcing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/melania-trump-lawsuit-daily-mail>
 that she was considering a suit, Trump’s lawyer called those rumors “100% 
false”.

The Daily Mail article also contained allegations that Melania Trump came to 
New York a year earlier than she has claimed, raising issues about her 
immigration status. The lawsuit notes that while the article in question has 
been removed from the Daily Mail’s website, the newspaper has yet to apologize 
or formally retract

The Republican nominee’s wife is also suing blogger Webster Tarpley. Tarpley’s 
blog post,which has since been retracted 
<http://tarpley.net/formal-retraction-of-factual-assertions-and-innunendos-regarding-melania-trump/>
, claimed, per the suit, that “it is widely known Melania was not a working 
model but rather a high-end escort” and that she had a “mental breakdown” after 
the plagiarism controversy over her speech to the RNC.

Harder is best known for representing Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that 
eventually bankrupted Gawker Media and forced the website to be sold in an 
auction to Univision last month. That suit was notoriously funded by Silicon 
Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, a vocal Trump supporter.

Steve Klepper, an appellate lawyer for the highly respected Baltimore law firm 
Kramon & Graham, saw legal maneuvering in the inclusion of the blogger. He told 
the Guardian “anytime you have a filing that adds a minor in state defendant, 
it’s a flag that they were joined to prevent removal to federal court. And as 
we know,Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has not 
been having been the best luck in federal court recently.”

He added: “Montgomery County has possibly the highest percentage college 
education jury pool in the whole country and I cannot see how the jury pool 
would be good for her.”

The lawsuit comes 68 days before Election Day and at time when Trump is under 
increased scrutiny after giving ahardline immigration policy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/in-arizona-we-saw-the-real-donald-trump-the-one-we-already-knew>
 speech only hours after striking conciliatory notes on the topicin a meeting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-pena-nieto-immigration-arizona>
 with Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto. It serves yet another distraction 
for the Republican nominee’s floundering campaign which has consistently 
trailed Hillary Clinton in the polls and a reminder of Trump’s combative 
relationship with the media.

The Republican nominee has blacklisted a number of news outlets and prevented 
from attending campaign events and has pledged topass stricter libel laws 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment>
 if elected

A Trump campaign spokesperson told the Guardian “we do not have anything in 
addition to the Harder statement”.

The Daily Mail did not immediately respond a request for comment

John McCain is not betting on a Donald Trump victory:

In a video released by his recently victorious campaign for the Republican 
nomination for US Senate, Arizona senator John McCain tells Grand Canyon State 
voters that “If Clinton is elected president, Arizona needs a senator who will 
act as a check.”

“No matter which side of the presidential election you’re on, whether you’re 
satisfied or dissatisfied with your choices for president, this election is an 
important one,” McCain intones in the ad. “My opponent, Representative Ann 
Kirkpatrick, is a good person. But if Hillary Clinton is elected president, 
Arizona will need a senator who will act as a check - not a rubber stamp.”

The message - echoing a similar stance taken by the Republican party in 1996 
in the waning days of the general election that brought Bill Clinton’s 
landslide victory over Republican nominee Bob Dole - does not speak to much 
confidence in aDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
victory in the general election.

Trump’s name is not mentioned in the ad.

For years, Mexican politicians have said lax US gun laws help to arm the 
country’s drug cartels.

Agency/Getty Images 
At a press conference with Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> on Wednesday in Mexico City, 
President Enrique Peña Nieto said: “Every year, thousands of weapons and 
millions of US dollars in cash enter illegally into Mexico from the north, 
strengthening the cartels and other criminal organizations that create violence 
in Mexico.”

The National Rifle Association (NRA), one of Trump’s key conservative backers, 
has long rejected such claims, arguing that guns sold by American dealers and 
smuggled across the border are not a major driver of crime inMexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico>.

On Wednesday, however, in a largely conciliatory speech in Mexico City that 
preceded amore aggressive 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech>
 address on immigration at home in Arizona, Trump did not question Peña Nieto’s 
comment about guns. Instead, the Republican presidential candidate echoed the 
Mexican president’s longtime talking points.

“No one wins in either country when human smugglers and drug traffickers prey 
on innocent people, when cartels commit acts of violence, when illegal weapons 
and cash flow from the United States into Mexico,” Trump said.

The NRA did not immediately comment. The organization has been one of Trump’s 
most consistent supporters,endorsing him for president

Hillary Clinton raised more than $140m in August

Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has had its best month ever, bringing 
in more than $143m in August for the campaign, as well as for the Democratic 
party. The campaign and allied action funds begin September with a more than 
$152 million war chest, built from donations from more than 2.3m people.

The average donation in August was $50, according to the campaign.

“Thanks to the 2.3 million people who have contributed to our campaign, we are 
heading into the final two months of the race with the resources we need to 
organize and mobilize millions of voters across the country,” campaign manager 
Robby Mook said in a release. “Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric continues to 
drive voters away from him and the Republican Party and has created new 
opportunities for Democrats up and down the ticket. These resources will help 
us to register and turnout millions of voters to elect progressive candidates 
across the country.”

Of the $143m pot, a total of $62m was raised for Hillary for America - that 
is, Clinton’s official campaign - while roughly $81m was raised for the 
Democratic National Committee, as well as Democratic state parties, through the 
Hillary Victory Fund and the Hillary Action Fund.
The Clinton campaign starts the month of September with $68m in cash on-hand, 
with allied victory funds beginning the month with $84m.


Donald Trump’s campaign has not yet reported its August fundraising numbers.

famously unscripted candidate put his foot in his mouth, writing suggested

In an interview on Fox News, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has given more conditions for 
the legalization of undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United 
States, an issue around which he has not-so-delicately tiptoed in his alternate 
hardening and softening and hardening of his immigration platform.

“We are going to strengthen the border, make it really, really strong,” Trump 
told Fox News anchor Eric Bolling. “We are going to build the wall. We are 
going to get rid of all of the bad players that are here, the gang members, the 
gang leaders, the drug dealers, all of the cartel people. We are going to get 
them out of our country because they are causing tremendous damage and crime. 
And other things. And getting the drugs spread all over the place. They will be 
gone.”

“After that takes place - which will be a process, and it won’t go that 
quickly but it’s going to go as quickly as any human being can do it - after 
that takes place, we’re going to sit back, we’re going to assess the 
situation,” Trump continued.

“We’re going to see where we are because we’ll have people in the country 
that, you know, that have come in illegally. We’re going to sit back. We’re 
going to assess the situation. We’re going to make a decision at that time. I 
want to see, before we do anything further, I want to see how it shapes up when 
we have strong, and you know, I use the word ‘impenetrable’ borders but how it 
shapes up and I think we are getting really tremendous reviews on the plan.”
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told Fox News 
host Eric Bolling that a Latino journalist who has been critical of his stance 
on immigration only voices his criticisms because Trump has never appeared on 
his show.

“I think Jorge is actually a nice guy but I just don’t do his show,” Trump 
said of Univision anchor Jorge Ramos. “So, you know, if I did his show, I’m 
sure he would be very happy.”
 
In a conversation with Fox News host Eric Bolling, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told the host that his trip 
to Mexico was more highly covered than any presidential trip, and critiqued 
Hillary Clinton as being unable to merit nearly as much media attention through 
her tenure as secretary of state.

“I think we had a great meeting,” Trump said. “It was well-covered by, I 
guess, as much as anybody has ever been covered in one of those meetings. And, 
you know, I’m not even a president. I guess it was pretty unusual, because as a 
president you get this kind of coverage. Although they didn’t get as much.”

Of Clinton’s tweeted remark 
<https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/771156031401521153> that “diplomacy 
isn’t as easy as it seems,” as Bolling put it, (actually “as easy as it 
looks”), Trump was dismissive.

“As far as Hillary is concerned, learning, how has she done in Libya? How has 
she done in Iraq? How has she done with the Iran deal and all of the other 
things like she started - that horrible Iran deal that’s now blowing up all 
over the place, one of the worst deals ever negotiated?” Trump asked 
rhetorically.

“I mean, for her to be saying that and that’s just a sound bite given to her 
by her handlers. You know, she has got handlers. And that’s just a sound bite. 
No, we had an amazing day and I have been given great credit by almost 
everybody that’s fair. You know, I mean, the fair people give credit. The ones 
that aren’t and I know what’s good and bad. In other words, Eric, I will tell 
you if something wasn’t good. you know that. You know me.”
 
The Obama administration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/obama-administration> has denied claims by 
a Washington thinktank that Iran has secretly been granted exemptions to a 
multilateral nuclear agreement signed last July in Vienna.

A report 
<http://file///Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/JCPOA%20Exemptions%20Revealed_1Sept2016_Final1.pdf>
 by the Institute for Science and International Security alleged that a joint 
commission set up to implement the Vienna deal had allowed Iran to keep more 
than the agreed maximum of 300 kg of low enriched uranium (LEU) by excluding 
waste material in Iran’s nuclear facilities. If enriched further, LEU could be 
used in a nuclear warhead.

The institute’s director and co-author of the report, David Albright, said 
that this and other exemptions were granted by the commission in secret.

“One of the biggest problems is we are being denied information in these 
cases,” Albright said. “If the joint commission has so many powers to change 
this deal, shouldn’t we know what they’re doing?”

The state department denied that the 300 kg LEU limit set down in the 
agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), had 
been breached.

“There’s been no loosening of the commitments and Iran has not and will not 
under the JCPOA be allowed to exceed the limits that are spelled out in the 
JCPOA,” spokesman John Kirby said. He added the only violation of the terms of 
the deal had been a temporary surplus in Iran’s export of heavy water (which 
can be used in nuclear reactors to produce plutonium), but that had been 
corrected. Kirby also said the secrecy of the work of the joint commission, 
which represents all parties to the deal, was stipulated in last year’s deal, 
signed by six world powers (the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China), the 
EU andIran <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran>.

“This is in compliance with the JCPOA which says the commission’s work should 
be confidential unless all parties agree otherwise,” Kirby said.

Donald Trump has hired an old nemesis of the Clinton family as his deputy 
campaign manager,the Washington Post reports 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-enlists-veteran-operative-david-bossie-as-deputy-campaign-manager/?postshare=8581472768973983&tid=ss_tw>
.

David Bossie, who investigated Bill and Hillary Clinton’s finances in the 
1990s as a congressional staffer, was described by Trump to the Washington Post 
as “a friend of mine for many years. Solid. Smart. Loves politics, knows how to 
win.”

Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told the Washington Post that Bossie, 
who until this week served as president of anti-Obama advocacy group Citizens 
United, is “a battle-tested warrior and a brilliant strategist”.

“He’s a nuts-and-bolts tactician as well, who’s going to help us fully 
integrate our ground game and data operations, and help with overall strategy 
as my deputy.”

Bossie investigated the Clintons as part of his work for a special senate 
committee on the Whitewater controversy, which investigated real estate 
investments by the Clintons and their associates in the Whitewater Development 
Corporation, a failed vacation-home development corporation.
 
The Daily Mail has printed a retraction of its story 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3769798/Melania-Trump-retraction.html> 
detailing “troubling questions” about Melania Trump’s past.

“To the extent that anything in the Daily Mail’s article was interpreted as 
stating or suggesting that Mrs. Trump worked as an ‘escort’ or in the ‘sex 
business,’ that she had a ‘composite or presentation card for the sex 
business,’ or that either of the modeling agencies referenced in the article 
were engaged in these businesses, it is hereby retracted, and the Daily Mail 
newspaper regrets any such misinterpretation,” the retraction states.

Earlier today, lawyers for Trump filed suit against the Daily Mail in Maryland 
state court for publishing what Trump’s lawyer, Charles Harder, called “lies 
... that Mrs. Trump supposedly was an ‘escort’ in the 1990s before she met her 
husband.” Harder said in a statement to reporters that these “actions are so 
egregious, malicious and harmful to Mrs. Trump that her damages are estimated 
at $150 million dollars”.

The suit, filed in Montgomery County in suburban Washington DC, was filed in 
response to articles published in August by the Daily Mail which reported 
rumors that Melania Trump worked as an escort in the 1990s. Infirst announcing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/melania-trump-lawsuit-daily-mail>
 that she was considering a suit, Trump’s lawyer called those rumors “100% 
false”.
 
A leaked script of a question-and-answer session with the pastor of a 
predominantly African American church this weekend,obtained by the New York 
Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/us/politics/donald-trump-black-voters-wayne-jackson.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0>
, shows that Donald Trump’s campaign is taking little chance on letting the 
famously unscripted candidate put his foot in his mouth, writing suggested 
answers to questions on race in America provided to the campaign in advance.

 When asked about his vision for black Americans, the script suggests that Mr. 
Trump stay positive, advising that he use lines such as ‘If we are to make 
America great again, we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in 
this country’ and ‘I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and 
governance.’


To a question submitted by Bishop Jackson about whether his campaign is 
racist, the script suggests that Mr. Trump avoid repeating the word, and 
instead speak about improving education and getting people off welfare and back 
to work. ‘The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding,’ Mr. Trump is advised 
to say. ‘Coming into a community is meaningless unless we offer an alternative 
to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass 
in America.’

Trump is also directed in the script to tell skeptical African American voters 
that his support is “up to 8% and climbing.”
 
Alfonso Aguilar, president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative 
Principles, has officially un-endorsed Donald Trump’s presidential bid after 
what he characterized as Trump’s “very scary speech” on immigration in Phoenix 
last night.

“I was critical of Mr Trump throughout the primary,” Aguilar told CNN’s Jake 
Tapper in an interview 
<http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/09/01/aguilar-dropping-support-donald-trump-immigration-lead-tapper-intv.cnn>
, but moved to support Trump because he felt that, “along with other Latino 
conservative leaders, that we could help Mr. Trump move towards the center.”

But after last night’s draconian address on immigration, in which Trump not 
only called for a “deportation task force” to hunt down undocumented immigrants 
but called for restrictions on legal immigration not seen in more than half a 
century, Aguilar feels “misled”.

“There’s nothing compassionate or human in his speech,” Aguilar said. “Not 
only did he double down on his proposals, I think they’re even worse.”

Positing that the speech was drafted by “the main anti-immigration groups,” 
Aguilar called the address “a nationalist, nativist speech, the kind of speech 
we would hear 100 years ago ... it was a very scary speech and, again, we 
thought that he was gonna move to the center. In a way, we fell that we were a 
little bit misled.”

 that she was considering a suit, Trump’s lawyer called those rumors “100% 
false”.

The Daily Mail article also contained allegations that Melania Trump came to 
New York a year earlier than she has claimed, raising issues about her 
immigration status. The lawsuit notes that while the article in question has 
been removed from the Daily Mail’s website, the newspaper has yet to apologize 
or formally retract

The Republican nominee’s wife is also suing blogger Webster Tarpley. Tarpley’s 
blog post,which has since been retracted 
<http://tarpley.net/formal-retraction-of-factual-assertions-and-innunendos-regarding-melania-trump/>
, claimed, per the suit, that “it is widely known Melania was not a working 
model but rather a high-end escort” and that she had a “mental breakdown” after 
the plagiarism controversy over her speech to the RNC.

Harder is best known for representing Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that 
eventually bankrupted Gawker Media and forced the website to be sold in an 
auction to Univision last month. That suit was notoriously funded by Silicon 
Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, a vocal Trump supporter.

Steve Klepper, an appellate lawyer for the highly respected Baltimore law firm 
Kramon & Graham, saw legal maneuvering in the inclusion of the blogger. He told 
the Guardian “anytime you have a filing that adds a minor in state defendant, 
it’s a flag that they were joined to prevent removal to federal court. And as 
we know,Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has not 
been having been the best luck in federal court recently.”

He added: “Montgomery County has possibly the highest percentage college 
education jury pool in the whole country and I cannot see how the jury pool 
would be good for her.”

The lawsuit comes 68 days before Election Day and at time when Trump is under 
increased scrutiny after giving ahardline immigration policy

 with Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto. It serves yet another distraction 
for the Republican nominee’s floundering campaign which has consistently 
trailed Hillary Clinton in the polls and a reminder of Trump’s combative 
relationship with the media.

The Republican nominee has blacklisted a number of news outlets and prevented 
from attending campaign events and has pledged topass stricter libel laws

A Trump campaign spokesperson told the Guardian “we do not have anything in 
addition to the Harder statement”.

The Daily Mail did not immediately respond a request for comment

John McCain is not betting on a Donald Trump victory:

In a video released by his recently victorious campaign for the Republican 
nomination for US Senate, Arizona senator John McCain tells Grand Canyon State 
voters that “If Clinton is elected president, Arizona needs a senator who will 
act as a check.”

“No matter which side of the presidential election you’re on, whether you’re 
satisfied or dissatisfied with your choices for president, this election is an 
important one,” McCain intones in the ad. “My opponent, Representative Ann 
Kirkpatrick, is a good person. But if Hillary Clinton is elected president, 
Arizona will need a senator who will act as a check - not a rubber stamp.”

The message - echoing a similar stance taken by the Republican party in 1996 
in the waning days of the general election that brought Bill Clinton’s 
landslide victory over Republican nominee Bob Dole - does not speak to much 
confidence in aDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
victory in the general election.

Trump’s name is not mentioned in the ad.

For years, Mexican politicians have said lax US gun laws help to arm the 
country’s drug cartels.

At a press conference with Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> on Wednesday in Mexico City, 
President Enrique Peña Nieto said: “Every year, thousands of weapons and 
millions of US dollars in cash enter illegally into Mexico from the north, 
strengthening the cartels and other criminal organizations that create violence 
in Mexico.”

The National Rifle Association (NRA), one of Trump’s key conservative backers, 
has long rejected such claims, arguing that guns sold by American dealers and 
smuggled across the border are not a major driver of crime inMexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico>.

On Wednesday, however, in a largely conciliatory speech in Mexico City that 
preceded amore aggressive 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech>
 address on immigration at home in Arizona, Trump did not question Peña Nieto’s 
comment about guns. Instead, the Republican presidential candidate echoed the 
Mexican president’s longtime talking points.

“No one wins in either country when human smugglers and drug traffickers prey 
on innocent people, when cartels commit acts of violence, when illegal weapons 
and cash flow from the United States into Mexico,” Trump said.

The NRA did not immediately comment. The organization has been one of Trump’s 
most consistent supporters,endorsing him for president

Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has had its best month ever, bringing 
in more than $143m in August for the campaign, as well as for the Democratic 
party. The campaign and allied action funds begin September with a more than 
$152 million war chest, built from donations from more than 2.3m people.

The average donation in August was $50, according to the campaign.

“Thanks to the 2.3 million people who have contributed to our campaign, we are 
heading into the final two months of the race with the resources we need to 
organize and mobilize millions of voters across the country,” campaign manager 
Robby Mook said in a release. “Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric continues to 
drive voters away from him and the Republican Party and has created new 
opportunities for Democrats up and down the ticket. These resources will help 
us to register and turnout millions of voters to elect progressive candidates 
across the country.”

Of the $143m pot, a total of $62m was raised for Hillary for America - that 
is, Clinton’s official campaign - while roughly $81m was raised for the 
Democratic National Committee, as well as Democratic state parties, through the 
Hillary Victory Fund and the Hillary Action Fund.
The Clinton campaign starts the month of September with $68m in cash on-hand, 
with allied victory funds beginning the month with $84m.


Donald Trump’s campaign has not yet reported its August fundraising numbers.
