“There just weren’t any waves in the Midlands,” says Chris Kenyon.

Fortunately for this Brummie surfer, he stumbled across paddleboarding a 
decade ago. The sport is a curious one: you balance on top of a monster 
surfboard and use a large paddle to power along. More curious still is Chris’s 
area of exploration. It’s not around the islands of Croatia, nor in 
paddleboarding’s spiritual home of Hawaii; the Midlander has made a full-time 
job of paddling the canal system that links contemporary Birmingham with its 
industrial past.

Chris asks me to step onto a board that’s floating slowly towards Winson Green 
prison, and I’m protected only by a pair of Bermuda shorts. We start with 
practice strokes atop the paddleboard; while it may take a week to learn the 
rudiments of surfing, in just 10 minutes Chris and I are navigating the 
waterway towards the city centre a mile away.

 Tristan and Chris paddleboarding through the city 
In this part of Britain’s former industrial heartland, there’s an added 
incentive not to fall in. We spy two dead fish and one bag of Doritos in quick 
succession. “Keep your mouth shut if you tumble,” says Chris. Has anyone ever 
fallen in? “I lead a lot of team-building groups through here. One big chap hit 
a submerged trolley and he flew forward into the drink. It’s an occupational 
hazard.”

Yet the appeal of such urban exploration becomes apparent as we paddle on 
through Birmingham’s suburbs. Waterways infrequently used in the decades since 
road and rail replaced these industrial arteries lead off from the principal 
Birmingham Canal. Towpaths are bordered by floating pennywort weed. Factories 
have birds nesting in the eaves. This city centre silence is nothing, claims 
Chris. “When I lead an expedition past the new Mailbox [shopping centre] and 
Birmingham Library, or toSpitfire Island 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_(sculpture)> where fighter planes were 
manufactured at Castle Bromwich, we might be the only ones on the water”.

These Midland waterways will become busier if Chris gets his way. Urban 
paddleboarding has become so popular that he recently attended a jamboree of 
100 boarders organised byCanoe England <http://www.canoe-england.org.uk/> 
alongside Birmingham’s Broad Street, where the handprints of local stars such 
as Noddy Holder and Jasper Carrot have been cast in cement à la Hollywood. 
“Colleagues from other paddleboard schools like London’sBlue Chip 
<http://www.windsurfer.co.uk/SUP_SUPersClub.htm> and Bournemouth’s BaySUP 
<http://www.baysup.co.uk/> drive up to Midlands meets,” says Chris. “Although, 
in theory, they could have paddled up, as Birmingham is connected to both 
Paddington Basin, and the Thames and Severn Canal.”

However, Birmingham paddleboarding’s popularity had less than auspicious 
beginnings. “I first tried my new kit on an artificial lake near a leisure 
centre in Tamworth,” says Chris. The local fishing club bailiff quickly emerged 
to apprehend both man and board. Fortunately, when Chris called the council to 
clarify his navigation rights, luck was on his side. “My local councillor was a 
big surfer,” he says. “He found me a grant to teach the sport to locals aged 
between eight and 80.” Since 2012, some 500 paddleboarders have passed through 
Chris’s class.

My final lesson is to navigate into Sherborne Wharf marina. A symbol of the 
Midlands’ resurgent waterways, it’s full of barges, cafes and the odd heckler 
(“No sharks in ‘ere mate.”). I shake Chris’s hand and make for New Street 
station and home. He lugs his paddleboard to an adjoining lock – where there 
are another 100 miles of Birmingham canals to explore.

Fancy a surf? Head to the coast. Or don’t … thanks to a brand new inland 
surfing lake in Snowdonia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/01/surfsnowdonia-surfing-lake-wales-snowdonia>
 that lets you hone your skills on artificial waves. Opened in August, the lake 
churns out 18 perfectly formed waves (up to two metres high) an hour, providing 
the perfect environment to improve your surfing. And though the lagoon is 
artificial, the surroundings – forest coated hills of the Conwy valley – 
satisfy a taste for the outdoors.
• Childrens’ lessons (5-13) start at £29 for one hour; 14-17 years and adult 
two-hour sessions (one hour theory, one hour practice) are £39. Beginners can

Like stepping inside a “big fridge” – according to the testimonial of leading 
climber Dave Macleod – the Ice Factor in Kinlochleven is home to thebiggest 
ice-climbing wall in the world 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/feb/17/ice-climbing-glen-coe-scotland>
. With 400 tonnes of real snow and ice packed onto a 12-metre wall, it’s an 
incredible (and rare) place for climbers ranging from beginner to expert to 
develop the specific techniques required for this style of climbing.

Abseil the Orbit, London

There aren’t any cliffs or mountains in London, but the capital does have the 
UK’s tallest sculpture: the Orbit. And now the 262ft structure in the Olympic 
Park has become a magnet for adrenaline junkies, offering the chance to abseil 
from the top. During the freefall abseil you’ll enjoy views across London, with 
the Gherkin, St Paul’s Cathedral and Wembley Stadium all visible.

Urban white-water rafting, Glasgow

Experience river rapids barely a mile from Glasgow’s city centre, at Pinkston 
Watersports <http://pinkston.co.uk/>, Scotland’s only artificial white-water 
course. A legacy project from the 2014 Commonwealth Games, the centre has a 
rapids route you can navigate in a canoe, on a bodyboard or with a group of 
pals in a six-person inflatable raft.
