Leigh Woods

On the opposite side of the Avon gorge to Clifton Downs, this vast woodland 
(490 acres of it managed by the National Trust, the rest by the Forestry 
Commission) makes a leafy backdrop to the Avon gorge and suspension bridge. 
Among its oak, whitebeam, yew and ash trees are picnic-friendly glades, shady 
walks, Iron Age hill forts, a natural play area and mountain bike trails. The 
woods are also one of threeDark Sky Discovery Sites 
<http://www.darkskydiscovery.org.uk/> in Bristol. Look out for themed events 
organised by the National Trust; a night-time nature walk will be running on 14 
August and "owls, bats and stars: walks are on 5 and 6 September.

Clifton Rockslide

At the western edge of Clifton Down, between Clifton suspension bridge 
<http://www.cliftonbridge.org.uk/> and the Camera Obscura at Clifton 
Observatory,this natural slide <http://bit.ly/1lVmyhU> is nothing more than a 
sloping band of rock polished to shiny slipperiness by decades of dedicated 
bottoms. If that's not enough fun for one day, follow the underground passage 
from the Observatory to the balconied cave below, a great lookout onto the 
bridge and the Avon gorge – as long as you don't crumple with vertigo.

Walk to Beese's Riverside Bar and Tea Gardens 

Follow the River Avon Trail <http://www.riveravontrail.org.uk/> from Netham 
Lock, at the east end of Feeder Road (or from Temple Meads station, at the west 
end of Feeder Road if you're arriving by train) to Conham River Park. The walk 
takes around 45 minutes; along the way look out for oak trees, kingfishers and 
the ruined remains of some of the area's industrial buildings. Best of all, 
though, is the reward that waits around the bend in the river that hugs the 
park. Here, between Easter and October, you can wait for a small boat to take 
you across the water to Beese's Riverside Bar and Tea Gardens. Order a cuppa 
and a homemade scone, or a smokey burger (with bacon and Somerset smoked 
cheddar) and eat it out in the garden before walking back.

Splash about in Millennium Square
 Splash out bristol 
If artist Luke Jerram gets his way there will be a 90-metre waterslide popping 
up in Park Street this May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/mar/11/artist-plans-bristol-street-giant-waterslide>
. Whether that happens or not, there are other watery ways to cool down in 
Bristol this year, not least in Millennium Square where a large area of 
fountains and ankle-deep pools are the perfect place for both big and little 
kids to soak up the summer atmosphere. Dry off afterwards outside the
contemporary arts centre of Arnolfini <http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/>, across 
Pero's bridge, with your feet dangling over the edge of the harbour and a 
chilled pint ofBristol Ciderworks <http://bristolciderworks.wordpress.com/>' 
finest in hand.

The final destination for many of Bristol's great and good (among them the 
Victorian evangelistGeorge Müller 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M%C3%BCller> and the Indian social reformer
Ram Mohan Roy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Mohan_Roy>), this 45-acre space 
is an atmospheric and peaceful place to wander. Run as a charity – it's a 
recognised Site of Nature Conservation Interest – there's an active wildlife 
management system in place, with primroses, butterflies, woodpeckers, redstarts 
and badgers regular attractions. It's not just about quiet reflection here, 
though. Check the website before you visit and you'll find a lively list of 
events, from concerts in a restored chapel to open-air plays and even yoga 
classes.

Canoeing the harbour
 Photograph: Alamy 
An operational harbour since the 13th century, Bristol's role as a working 
port started to decline in the late 19th-cenutry when Avonmouth docks were 
built downstream, allowing larger vessels to berth. The ebb of commercial 
shipping, however, has made space for a flow of recreational water-based 
activities, from a thriving annualHarbour Festival 
<http://www.bristolharbourfestival.co.uk/> to ferry trips 
<http://www.bristolferry.com/> and boat tours <http://www.bristolpacket.co.uk/>
. But one of the best ways to explore the city from the water is on a guided 
paddle around the harbour in a kayak or Canadian canoe. Sights along the way 
include the SS Great Britain, the Cumberland Basin and theFairbairn Steam Crane 
<http://mshed.org/>. If it's a sunny day, you can stop off for a pint at the 
watersideCottage Inn <http://www.cottage.butcombe.com/> pub.

Cabot Tower

For one of the best views of the city and beyond, climb up to the top of 
Brandon Hill and scramble up the spiral stairs of the city's iconic Cabot 
Tower. Reopened to the public three years ago, the tower was originally built 
in 1897 to commemorate Italian John Cabot's expedition from Bristol to North 
America 400 years earlier. Get your breath back afterwards with an amble around 
the surroundingparkland and nature reserve 
<http://www.avonwildlifetrust.org.uk/reserves/brandon_hill.htm> or a snooze in 
the adjacent wildflower meadow.

Outdoor swimming at Bristol Lido and Portishead Pool

If you like to follow your 20 lengths with a lomi lomi massage (£60), a glass 
of Franciacorta (£8.50) and wood-roast rack of lamb with a lemon, artichoke and 
parmesan salad (£18.50) then Clifton's Bristol Lido is the open-air pool for 
you. If your budget veers more towards Fanta than Franciacorta, visit 
Portishead Open Air Pool instead. Eight miles west of the city centre, it is a 
volunteer-run, heated pool that is open in the summer months only. The prices 
are much cheaper here and, if you go on a Thursday, it's steak night (£30 for a 
couple of steaks and a bottle of wine) at the adjacent, open-all-year cafe,The 
Lido Kitchen <http://thelidokitchen.com/>.

Blaise Castle

There's a museum and a tiny triangular castle to explore at this site in the 
north of the city. The castle was famously described in Jane Austen's 
Northanger Abbey as: "The finest place in England – worth going 50 miles at any 
time to see," though that's maybe overplaying it. Most visitors today come for 
the 650 acres of parkland that surround it. Go for a dramatic walk around the 
estate's limestone gorge, ride your bike around the parkland, play cricket or 
take the children to the sophisticated adventure playground.

Bristol's Biggest Bike Ride
 Photograph: Robert Timoney/REX 
On 22 June this annual cycling event takes over the city for the 21st time. 
Non-competitive and open to all ages, participants can choose from various 
traffic-free routes around the city of between nine and 38 miles, many of them 
passing under the Clifton suspension bridge. Bristol was named England's first 
"cycling city" and is home to transport charitySustrans 
<http://www.sustrans.org.uk/>, so it's an appropriate way to get some local air 
in your lungs, even more so in the run-up to the city's stint asEuropean Green 
Capital <http://bristolgreencapital.org/> in 2015. As the city gears up to 
bolster its reputation as a bike-friendly metropolis, this is one of a number 
of two-wheeled events taking place in the city this year.
