AP says it has seen a European arrest warrant from Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany>, which names the suspect as Anis 
Amri, as previously reported.

It says Amri has Tunisian citizenship and was born in the town of Ghaza. But 
it lists multiple aliases, many of them variants on his name, and Egyptian and 
Lebanese citizenship as well.

German authorities say they rejected the man’s asylum request in July.

Germany’s interior ministry has deleted a tweet in which it appeared to flout 
the advice of its minister, Thomas de Maizière, by speculating about the 
nationality of the suspect.

Elena Cresci has this translation of the announcement about the deleted tweet: 

The use of a hashtag #Tunesier has led to confusion. For that we apologise. We 
did not want to contribute to any speculation. Its use was not meant as a 
confirmation of the nationality of the current suspect. Therefore, we have 
deleted the tweet.

Earlier Maizière appealed to the media not to speculate about the suspect.

Here’s what we know so far:

 * Police are hunting for a Tunisian man whose documents were found in the 
truck that ploughed into a Berlin Christmas market 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/21/berlin-attack-german-police-leads?CMP=share_btn_tw>
. The new suspect has been named in the German media as Anis Amri. 
 * The suspect has been living in Berlin since February and was regarded by 
the security services as a “danger” to the public. His application for asylum 
was turned down in June because he didn’t posses the correct papers. Tunisia 
initially denied that he was a Tunisian citizen, but documents confirming that 
he was arrived today. 
 * Amri is reported to have links with a hate preacher named Ahmad Abdelazziz 
A., also known as Abu Walaa, who was arrested in November.The preacher is 
alleged to have given sermons encouraging people to travel to Syria to fight. 
 * Unconfirmed reports claim the Polish man whose body was found in the truck 
tried to fight off the attacker. It is suggested that his struggle may have 
prevented more people from being killed in the attack. 
 * Monday night’s attack at the Breitscheidplatz 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/world/europe/a-berlin-square-where-the-prewar-postwar-and-modern-eras-coexist.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news>
 Christmas market, killed 12 and injuring 48.Of those killed, six were German, 
one was Polish (the original truck driver, Lukasz Urban, a 37-year-old who was 
found dead in the passenger seat of the vehicle). The identities of the other 
victims are not yet known. 
 * An Italian woman is feared to be among the 12 victims. Fabrizia Di Lorenzo, 
31, has not been heard from since the attack and it is understood her phone and 
metro pass were found at the scene.

 * Isis claimed responsibility for the attack through its news agency Amaq, 
calling the assailant responsible a “soldier” who “carried out the attack in 
response to calls to target citizens of the international coalition”. However, 
Isis provided no evidence to support its claim. 
 * Police released Naved B, a Pakistani asylum seeker who they had arrested on 
Monday night, after finding no evidence that he was the driver of the truck. A 
bystander had tried to follow the driver of the truck for more than a mile 
after they witnessed him jump out before it was driven into the Christmas 
market, but it seems they misidentified the suspect. 
 * “We do not want to live paralysed by the fear of evil,” said German 
chancellor Angela Merkel, before visiting Breitscheidplatz.The attacks - and 
arrest of an asylum seeker - sparked political debate in Germany over 
immigration and the policies of Merkel,who is facing re-election next year

Jäger confirmed that the suspect’s application for asylum was refused. 


According to a live translation provided by Sky News he said:

It is not yet established that the suspect was part of the attack. We in North 
Rhine-Westphalia have been supporting the state prosecutor in his aim of 
finding and detaining suspects. We must not endanger the action to detain the 
suspect, so we can’t give you any information.

I can give the following information about the suspect: Since February 2016 he 
has been living in Berlin. He was briefly in North Rhine-Westphalia before 
that. The security services have exchanged information regarding him in 
November. The federal police issued a warning that he was posing a danger.

In June 2016 his asylum application was rejected. He could not be deported 
because he did not have any valid identity papers. Tunisia initially denied 
that he was a citizen onTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/tunisia>. 
His identity papers arrived today - I don’t want to comment further on this 
fact.

An Italian woman is feared to be among the 12 victims of the Berlin lorry 
attack.


Fabrizia Di Lorenzo, 31, has not been heard from since the attack and it is 
understood her phone and metro pass were found at the scene.

She is believed to have been living in Berlin and her family have flown there 
to give samples of their DNA. Her father told the Italian daily Repubblica that 
the family were waiting for news, but had “no illusions” about her fate 
<http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2016/12/20/news/berlino_italiana_dispersa_fabrizia_di_lorenzo-154528177/>
.

It points out that in some of her last Twitter posting Di Lorenzo spoke 
against racial discrimination and urged her followers not to confuse terrorism 
with immigration.

 * German police have offered a reward of 100,000 euros, for information 
leading to the arrest of the new suspect of the attack, who they named as 
Tunisian nationalAnis Amri, 24. They released photos of Amri, who is described 
as of average height and weight, with black hair and brown eyes. 
 * Police described him as armed and dangerous and urged members of the public 
to notify police if they see him.

 * A European arrest warrant issued from Germany says Amri has used six 
different aliases and three different nationalities- Tunisian, Egyptian and 
Lebanese. 
 * He has been living in Berlin since February and was regarded by the 
security services as a “danger” to the public. His application for asylum was 
turned down in June because he didn’t posses the correct papers. 
 * Amri is reported to have links with a hate preacher named Ahmad Abdelazziz 
A, also known as Abu Walaa, who was arrested in November.The preacher is 
alleged to have given sermons encouraging people to travel to Syria to fight. 
 * Berlin’s state health ministry says 12 people are still being treated in 
hospital for very serious injuries sustained in the attack, among them an 
unspecified number in a critical condition.It said that a number of people with 
lighter injuries are being discharged.

German authorities have offered a reward of up to €100,000 (£84,000) for 
information leading to the arrest of the Tunisian man suspected of involvement 
in the attack.

Federal prosecutors describe 24-year-old Anis Amri as of average height and 
weight, with black hair and brown eyes.


In a public notice issued on Wednesday, prosecutors say he could be “dangerous 
and armed” and urge members of the public to notify police if they see him.

 
Here are pictures of the scene of the attack now, covered with tributes:

Berlin’s state health ministry says 12 people are still being treated in 
hospital for very serious injuries sustained in the attack, among them an 
unspecified number in a critical condition, AP reports.

It said that a number of people with lighter injuries are being discharged.

 
AP says it has seen a European arrest warrant from Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany>, which names the suspect as Anis 
Amri, as previously reported.

It says Amri has Tunisian citizenship and was born in the town of Ghaza. But 
it lists multiple aliases, many of them variants on his name, and Egyptian and 
Lebanese citizenship as well.

German authorities say they rejected the man’s asylum request in July.
 
AP has a breaking news alert, which says the suspect has used six different 
aliases and three different nationalities and is considered “armed and 
dangerous”.
 
Germany’s interior ministry has deleted a tweet in which it appeared to flout 
the advice of its minister, Thomas de Maizière, by speculating about the 
nationality of the suspect.

Elena Cresci has this translation of the announcement about the deleted tweet: 

The use of a hashtag #Tunesier has led to confusion. For that we apologise. We 
did not want to contribute to any speculation. Its use was not meant as a 
confirmation of the nationality of the current suspect. Therefore, we have 
deleted the tweet.

Earlier Maizière appealed to the media not to speculate about the suspect.

Here’s what we know so far:

 * Police are hunting for a Tunisian man whose documents were found in the 
truck that ploughed into a Berlin Christmas market 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/21/berlin-attack-german-police-leads?CMP=share_btn_tw>
. The new suspect has been named in the German media as Anis Amri. 
 * The suspect has been living in Berlin since February and was regarded by 
the security services as a “danger” to the public. His application for asylum 
was turned down in June because he didn’t posses the correct papers. Tunisia 
initially denied that he was a Tunisian citizen, but documents confirming that 
he was arrived today. 
 * Amri is reported to have links with a hate preacher named Ahmad Abdelazziz 
A., also known as Abu Walaa, who was arrested in November.The preacher is 
alleged to have given sermons encouraging people to travel to Syria to fight. 
 * Unconfirmed reports claim the Polish man whose body was found in the truck 
tried to fight off the attacker. It is suggested that his struggle may have 
prevented more people from being killed in the attack. 
 * Monday night’s attack at the Breitscheidplatz 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/world/europe/a-berlin-square-where-the-prewar-postwar-and-modern-eras-coexist.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news>
 Christmas market, killed 12 and injuring 48.Of those killed, six were German, 
one was Polish (the original truck driver, Lukasz Urban, a 37-year-old who was 
found dead in the passenger seat of the vehicle). The identities of the other 
victims are not yet known. 
 * An Italian woman is feared to be among the 12 victims. Fabrizia Di Lorenzo, 
31, has not been heard from since the attack and it is understood her phone and 
metro pass were found at the scene.

 * Isis claimed responsibility for the attack through its news agency Amaq, 
calling the assailant responsible a “soldier” who “carried out the attack in 
response to calls to target citizens of the international coalition”. However, 
Isis provided no evidence to support its claim. 
 * Police released Naved B, a Pakistani asylum seeker who they had arrested on 
Monday night, after finding no evidence that he was the driver of the truck. A 
bystander had tried to follow the driver of the truck for more than a mile 
after they witnessed him jump out before it was driven into the Christmas 
market, but it seems they misidentified the suspect. 
 * “We do not want to live paralysed by the fear of evil,” said German 
chancellor Angela Merkel, before visiting Breitscheidplatz.The attacks - and 
arrest of an asylum seeker - sparked political debate in Germany over 
immigration and the policies of Merkel,who is facing re-election next year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/20/angela-merkel-supporters-fears-berlin-attack>
.  
Jäger confirmed that the suspect’s application for asylum was refused. 


According to a live translation provided by Sky News he said:

It is not yet established that the suspect was part of the attack. We in North 
Rhine-Westphalia have been supporting the state prosecutor in his aim of 
finding and detaining suspects. We must not endanger the action to detain the 
suspect, so we can’t give you any information.

I can give the following information about the suspect: Since February 2016 he 
has been living in Berlin. He was briefly in North Rhine-Westphalia before 
that. The security services have exchanged information regarding him in 
November. The federal police issued a warning that he was posing a danger.

In June 2016 his asylum application was rejected. He could not be deported 
because he did not have any valid identity papers. Tunisia initially denied 
that he was a citizen onTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/tunisia>. 
His identity papers arrived today - I don’t want to comment further on this 
fact.

An Italian woman is feared to be among the 12 victims of the Berlin lorry 
attack.


Fabrizia Di Lorenzo, 31, has not been heard from since the attack and it is 
understood her phone and metro pass were found at the scene.

She is believed to have been living in Berlin and her family have flown there 
to give samples of their DNA. Her father told the Italian daily Repubblica that 
the family were waiting for news, but had “no illusions” about her fate 
<http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2016/12/20/news/berlino_italiana_dispersa_fabrizia_di_lorenzo-154528177/>
.

It points out that in some of her last Twitter posting Di Lorenzo spoke 
against racial discrimination and urged her followers not to confuse terrorism 
with immigration.
