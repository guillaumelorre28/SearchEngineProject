A prized painting by Francis Bacon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon> could be sold at auction – to 
help a cash-strapped West Yorkshire council raise a potential £60m.

Sales from public collections are heavily frowned upon in the arts world, with 
some critics saying it betrays those who originally donated the items and 
deters others who might donate in the future.

But Kirklees council is considering selling the 1940s painting by the artist 
after it was recently forced to close two museums, with another closure on the 
way.

David Sheard, leader of the council, said the painting, Figure Study II, had 
languished in storage for years as it was too valuable to be exhibited locally.

He said: “I can’t see any value of owning a painting which is stuck in a 
cellar most of the time. I know recently it has been on tour, but there have 
been times where it has been in storage for a very long time.

“It is an issue that we need to have an open debate about as it is a problem 
if it is costing us so much to insure yet we’re not able to display it.”

The painting, which depicts a “screaming mouth and the eyeless face of a 
sub-human creature”, is the multimillion pound “superstar” of the borough’s art 
collection. Its companion piece, Figure Study I, hangs in the Scottish National 
Gallery.

However, senior council figures say that because it is expensive to insure it 
can only be exhibited within the secure environment of Huddersfield Art 
Gallery. Currently it is in the gallery’s vaults.

The Labour council leader’s comments come after London art experts said 
current auction prices meant the painting could be worth up to three times its 
estimated value of £19.5m.

Prices of Bacon paintings have rocketed since his death in 1992. In November 
2013, a Bacon triptych depicting artist Lucian Freud fetched £90m, then the 
most expensive artwork ever sold at auction.

Some say auctioning the piece could fund Kirklees’ museums and galleries for 
decades to come.

Andrew Cooper, Green councillor for Newsome, said: “In the dire circumstances 
the council finances are in, we have to consider selling artworks that the 
council has. We have got to look at using any money that we realise from it to 
protect essential council services.”

However, Sheard said he would prefer to loan the painting to other museums and 
art galleries within the UK.

“That would be my preferred outcome because then we get the best of both 
worlds – we get to keep the painting and raise revenue. However, I need to know 
all the facts before any decision is made and will have to discuss options with 
the whole council,” he added.

The notion of selling the Bacon painting caused outrage among art lovers when 
it was first mooted by the Conservative group, in charge of the WestYorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/yorkshire> council four years ago.

It was argued then that the millions of pounds raised could potentially fund 
the reopening of Dewsbury Museum and Red House Museum, safeguard jobs, and 
repair and revive Tolson Museum in Huddersfield.

But any potential sale could be blocked by the Contemporary Art Society, which 
gifted the painting to Batley’s Bagshaw Museum more than six decades ago. The 
society said the artwork is secured by a restrictive covenant that allegedly 
prevents it from being sold.

A spokesman said: “The painting was a conditional gift from the Contemporary 
Art Society and the conditions of the gift means that it cannot be sold. This 
is in line with the Arts Council’s museum accreditation policy.”

London art dealer David Messum said the painting could be worth double or 
triple its £19.5m valuation.

“There is big money around for Francis Bacon at the moment because a Francis 
Bacon is a prized possession,” he said. “There are one or two opportunities a 
year for these. It’s going to fetch a steep price and above estimate.”

In 2014, Northampton borough council was accused of a “moral crime against 
world heritage” after it sold an ancient Egyptian statue.

The council’s decision to put the 4,500-year-old statue up for auction saw 
Northampton Museum stripped of its Arts Council England accreditation until 
2019, rendering it ineligible for a range of arts and grants funding.

The statue was considered the jewel in the crown of the museum’s collection 
but wassold at Christie’s in July 2014 to an anonymous buyer for £15.8m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/10/northampton-borough-council-sells-egyptian-statue-sekhemka>
. After its sale, thegovernment put a temporary export ban on it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/30/export-block-on-ancient-egyptian-statue-sold-by-northampton-council>
 in the hope a domestic buyer would match the sum to keep it in the UK.

But after campaigners failed to raise the funds to prevent its departure it 
reportedly went into a private collection in the US.

The statue, taken from the tomb of Sekhemka, the pharaoh’s inspector of 
scribes in Saqqara, had been donated to the museum in 1880 by the son of the 
second Marquess of Northampton who had brought it from Egypt.

The council put the statue up for sale to fund an extension to the museum, and 
the proceeds were split with Lord Northampton.

It has previously been claimed that Britain’s councils own artworks worth 
£2.3bn – but less than 2% are on public display.

Manchester city council was top with an art hoard worth £374m, followed by 
Birmingham and Southampton with £200m each, Leeds with £150m and Newcastle with 
£104m.
