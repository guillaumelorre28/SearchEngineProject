 * Speaking to CNN’s Anderson Cooper in her first televised interview since 
the release of video that showed her husband bragging about sexually assaulting 
women, Melania Trump defended her husband’s “boy talk” as having been “egged 
on” by a television interviewer. “I said to my husband that, you know, the 
language was unappropriate,” Trump said. “It’s not acceptable. And I was 
surprised, because that is not the man that I know.” 
 * Despite the pressures of the campaign on her marriage, Trump said, she does 
not want people feeling bad for her. “People think and talk about me like, ‘oh 
Melania, oh poor Melania.’ Don’t feel sorry for me, don’t feel sorry for me. I 
can handle everything.” 
 * In an interview with Fox News’ Carl Cameron, Republican presidential 
nominee Donald Trump said that while it would be “very easy” to apologize for 
recent sexual assault allegations made against him, “you can’t apologize for an 
event that never took place.” 
 * “First of all, they are all lies,” Trump said. “They are made-up stories, 
they were fabricated. Whether they like Hillary or whether they just want to 
become a little bit famous or something. You take a look at the butler. The 
butler was supposed to be the witness, the butler was my witness. I mean it was 
100%, that was a disgrace that they were able to say it. It would be very easy 
to apologize but you can’t apologize for an event that never took place. These 
events never took place.”

 * Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, has “informally approached one of 
the media industry’s top dealmakers about the prospect of setting up a Trump 
television network after the presidential election in November”, the Financial 
Timesreported <https://www.ft.com/content/7dc39954-940e-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582>:
Mr Kushner – an increasingly influential figure in the billionaire’s 
presidential campaign – contactedAryeh Bourkoff 
<https://www.ft.com/content/b4bea972-213a-11e6-9d4d-c11776a5124d>, the founder 
and chief executive of LionTree, a boutique investment bank, within the past 
couple of months, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

 * Their conversation was brief and has not progressed since, the people said. 
Mr Bourkoff and Mr Kushner both declined to comment. 
 * The heat is on in Arizona. Clinton campaign manger Robby Mook summarized 
the state of the race as such: we think Hillary Clinton can win Arizona.The 
traditionally ruby red Republican state has only voted for the Democratic 
ticket once since the end of WWII, Bill Clinton in 1996. The campaign said it 
will spend $2 million in television, digital, and mail advertising there. 
This is a state that would really foreclose the path for Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to win the White House,” Mook 
said of Arizona.

 * Donald Trump has released a rare video message on Twitter accusing the 
Department of Justice, the State Department and the FBI of “colluding” to make 
Democratic rival Hillary Clinton look good. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
Crooked Hillary colluded w/FBI and DOJ and media is covering up to protect 
her. It's a#RiggedSystem <https://twitter.com/hashtag/RiggedSystem?src=hash>!

Donald Trump releases plan for 'ethics reform'

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, hitting hard against “crooked” 
opponent Hillary Clinton, has releaseda five-point plan 
<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-details-ethics-reform-p> for 
government reform “to drain the swamp in Washington, DC.”

The seven-sentence plan, as written:

First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch 
officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government 
service. I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot 
be lifted by executive order.

Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying 
by former members of Congress and their staffs.

Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the 
loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves 
consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.

Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch 
officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.

Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that 
prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.

Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic 
stagnation.

Report: Apprentice staffer claims Donald Trump laughed about groping

A female staffer on The Celebrity Apprentice, Donald Trump’s longrunning 
reality show,told The Daily Beast 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/17/apprentice-staffer-claims-gary-busey-groped-her-and-then-donald-trump-laughed.html>
 that actor Gary Busey sexually assaulted her on the set of the show - and that 
Trump laughed about the incident afterwards:

Multiple Apprentice employees, including the alleged victim herself, told The 
Daily Beast that the Academy-Award-nominated actor “grabbed” one of their 
colleagues “firmly between [the] legs” during the 2011 season of Celebrity 
Apprentice. Busey also forcibly put the female staffer’s hand on the crotch of 
his pants. The alleged incident, which they say took place during a location 
shoot in SoHo in New York City, prompted a firestorm among members of the 
Apprentice crew.

Citing five on-staff sources, The Daily Beast reports that the alleged 
incident took place when the celebrity contestants were tasked with selling 
inventory at an art gallery, where the contestants had been drinking.

“We were smoking cigarettes outside, and Busey was standing next to me. And 
then at one point, he grabbed me firmly between my legs, and ran his hand up my 
stomach, and grabbed my breasts,” the staffer told The Daily Beast. “I didn’t 
know what to do. So I made this joke that, ‘Oh, I’ve never been sexually 
harassed by a celebrity before!’ Then he grabbed my hand and put it [over] his 
penis, and said, like, ‘I’m just getting started, baby.’”

The staffer’s colleagues told The Daily Beast that Trump was made aware of the 
incident, responding that Busey needed to keep his hands to himself.

“Gary, did you do a bad thing…[and] got your hands where they’re not supposed 
to be,” a staff member recalled Trump as saying. Anoter said that Trump 
mockingly called Busey a “bad boy, a very bad boy.”

Donald Trump: 'You can't apologize for an event that never took place'

In an interview with Fox News’ Carl Cameron, Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> said that while 
it would be “very easy” to apologize for recent sexual assault allegations made 
against him, “you can’t apologize for an event that never took place.”

“First of all, they are all lies,” Trump said. “They are made-up stories, they 
were fabricated. Whether they like Hillary or whether they just want to become 
a little bit famous or something. You take a look at the butler. The butler was 
supposed to be the witness, the butler was my witness. I mean it was 100%, that 
was a disgrace that they were able to say it. It would be very easy to 
apologize but you can’t apologize for an event that never took place. These 
events never took place.”

“Every one of those charges were false and they were lies,” he continued. “It 
didn’t even take place. I didn’t see them. The woman on the airplane, 35 years 
ago, 30 years ago? I mean, you don’t even believe that one. Okay? I don’t know 
maybe you’re very gullible, but you don’t believe that one. We have a woman on 
the airplane 35 years ago? No. These were bogus charges. These were lies. These 
were fabrications. I like saying it.”

“Somebody else would say let’s focus on jobs, which I do, let’s focus on ISIS, 
let’s focus on the second amendment and judges of the Supreme Court justices. I 
agree with that, but I want the truth to come out.”

Continuing her interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Melania Trump told the 
anchor that the hardest part of the campaign has been media scrutiny of herself 
and her family, echoing claims by her husband that journalists and outlets are 
stacked against the Republican presidential nominee.

“I didn’t expect media will be so dishonest and so mean - I didn’t expect 
that,” Trump said. “From New York Post, two days in a row, they put me on the 
cover from pictures I did many, many years ago as a model.”

“It was done as art, as a celebration of female body, so they put it twice in 
a row,” she said, of the publication of risqué photographs from her modeling 
days in the 1990s. “In that story, they put the date when pictures were taken 
wrong. They never called me,” she said, “and suddenly becomes I was here 
illegally, I was married before. I was, like, ‘yeah, find the husband I was 
with before I was with my husband.’”

“Every story, it’s a female! It’s a female reporter!” she said. “It’s 
unacceptable.”

“I know he respects women, but he’s defending his, because they are lies,” 
Trump said, of her husband’s attacks on his accusers’ looks and credibility.

Despite siding with her husband during the controversies of the past two 
weeks, Trump indicated that she has cautioned their young son, Barron, from 
using similar language.

“I let him have a normal childhood as possible - we talk a lot, a lot about 
the campaign. We talk about the language, because we don’t allow the using that 
language,” Trump said. “I tell him that, there are consequences as well, and he 
needs to be careful of the langue he uses.”

“It was my decision not to be on the campaign trail,” Trump said. “I will be a 
parent to our boy, to our child.”

While she stands back, Trump said, her husband is happy to be leading the 
charge.

“He will fight ’til the end - and he will fight for the American people as he 
fight for himself.”

Melania Trump: 'Don't feel sorry for me'

Speaking to CNN’s Anderson Cooper in her first televised interview since the 
release of video that showed her husband bragging about sexually assaulting 
women, Melania Trump defended her husband’s “boy talk” as having been “egged 
on” by a television interviewer.

“I said to my husband that, you know, the language was unappropriate,” Trump 
said. “It’s not acceptable. And I was surprised, because that is not the man 
that I know.”

Trump, breaking the traditional role of candidate’s spouse as 
cheerleader-in-chief, has largely eschewed appearances on the campaign trail 
following speculation that her speech at the Republican National Convention in 
Julyplagiarized Michelle Obama’s 2008 address 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-republican-convention-plagiarism-michelle-obama>
 to the Democratic National Convention. This makes the Slovenian-born former 
model’s appearance with Cooper notable even ifmore than a dozen allegations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations>
 of sexual impropriety had not been leveled against her husband over the past 
week.

“Every Friday something comes out,” Trump told Cooper, dismissing the 
controversies that have followed her husband since he announced his candidacy 
for the White House last June.

“It’s very hard, especially for him,” she continued, “because he did so many 
stuff in his life. He was on so many tapes, so many shows. And we knew that, 
that, you know, tapes will come out, people will want to go against him. But my 
husband is real, he’s raw. He tells it like it is.”

Asked about whether she views her husband’s behavior in the video as 
“locker-room” stuff, as he has characterized it, Trump agreed.

“It’s kind of two teenage boys - actually, they should behave better,” Trump 
said. “I know how some men talk - that’s how I saw it.”

No matter the subject matter, she continued, Trump does not view her husband’s 
remarks in the video as descriptive of sexual assault.

“No, that’s not a sexual assault,” Trump said. “He didn’t say he did it, and I 
see many many women coming to him and giving phone numbers, and want to work 
for him and inappropriate stuff from women. And they know he’s married.”

“Every assault should be taken care of in court of law,” Trump said, but the 
accusations made in the media are “damaging and it’s unfair.”


“I believe my husband. This was all organized from the opposition,” Trump 
said. “They don’t have any facts and even the story that came out in People 
Magazine, the writer that she said that my husband took her to the room and 
start kissing her, she wrote in the same story about me that she saw me on 
Fifth Avenue and I said to her, Natasha, how come we don’t see you anymore? I 
was never friend with her. I’d never recognize her.”

“How we could believe her? That never happened.”

Despite the pressures of the campaign on her marriage, Trump said, she does 
not want people feeling bad for her.

“People think and talk about me like, ‘oh Melania, oh poor Melania.’ Don’t 
feel sorry for me, don’t feel sorry for me. I can handle everything.”

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, hitting hard against “crooked” 
opponent Hillary Clinton, has releaseda five-point plan 
<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-details-ethics-reform-p> for 
government reform “to drain the swamp in Washington, DC.”

The seven-sentence plan, as written:

First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch 
officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government 
service. I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot 
be lifted by executive order.

Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying 
by former members of Congress and their staffs.

Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the 
loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves 
consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.

Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch 
officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.

Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that 
prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.

Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic 
stagnation.
 
A female staffer on The Celebrity Apprentice, Donald Trump’s longrunning 
reality show,told The Daily Beast 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/17/apprentice-staffer-claims-gary-busey-groped-her-and-then-donald-trump-laughed.html>
 that actor Gary Busey sexually assaulted her on the set of the show - and that 
Trump laughed about the incident afterwards:

Multiple Apprentice employees, including the alleged victim herself, told The 
Daily Beast that the Academy-Award-nominated actor “grabbed” one of their 
colleagues “firmly between [the] legs” during the 2011 season of Celebrity 
Apprentice. Busey also forcibly put the female staffer’s hand on the crotch of 
his pants. The alleged incident, which they say took place during a location 
shoot in SoHo in New York City, prompted a firestorm among members of the 
Apprentice crew.

Citing five on-staff sources, The Daily Beast reports that the alleged 
incident took place when the celebrity contestants were tasked with selling 
inventory at an art gallery, where the contestants had been drinking.

“We were smoking cigarettes outside, and Busey was standing next to me. And 
then at one point, he grabbed me firmly between my legs, and ran his hand up my 
stomach, and grabbed my breasts,” the staffer told The Daily Beast. “I didn’t 
know what to do. So I made this joke that, ‘Oh, I’ve never been sexually 
harassed by a celebrity before!’ Then he grabbed my hand and put it [over] his 
penis, and said, like, ‘I’m just getting started, baby.’”

The staffer’s colleagues told The Daily Beast that Trump was made aware of the 
incident, responding that Busey needed to keep his hands to himself.

“Gary, did you do a bad thing…[and] got your hands where they’re not supposed 
to be,” a staff member recalled Trump as saying. Anoter said that Trump 
mockingly called Busey a “bad boy, a very bad boy.”
 
In an interview with Fox News’ Carl Cameron, Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> said that while 
it would be “very easy” to apologize for recent sexual assault allegations made 
against him, “you can’t apologize for an event that never took place.”

were fabricated. Whether they like Hillary or whether they just want to become 
a little bit famous or something. You take a look at the butler. The butler was 
supposed to be the witness, the butler was my witness. I mean it was 100%, that 
was a disgrace that they were able to say it. It would be very easy to 
apologize but you can’t apologize for an event that never took place. These 
events never took place.”

“Every one of those charges were false and they were lies,” he continued. “It 
didn’t even take place. I didn’t see them. The woman on the airplane, 35 years 
ago, 30 years ago? I mean, you don’t even believe that one. Okay? I don’t know 
maybe you’re very gullible, but you don’t believe that one. We have a woman on 
the airplane 35 years ago? No. These were bogus charges. These were lies. These 
were fabrications. I like saying it.”

“Somebody else would say let’s focus on jobs, which I do, let’s focus on ISIS, 
let’s focus on the second amendment and judges of the Supreme Court justices. I 
agree with that, but I want the truth to come out.”

Melania Trump, on Donald Trump’s Twitter use:

He’s an adult - he knows the consequences.
 
Continuing her interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Melania Trump told the 
anchor that the hardest part of the campaign has been media scrutiny of herself 
and her family, echoing claims by her husband that journalists and outlets are 
stacked against the Republican presidential nominee.

“I didn’t expect media will be so dishonest and so mean - I didn’t expect 
that,” Trump said. “From New York Post, two days in a row, they put me on the 
cover from pictures I did many, many years ago as a model.”

“It was done as art, as a celebration of female body, so they put it twice in 
a row,” she said, of the publication of risqué photographs from her modeling 
days in the 1990s. “In that story, they put the date when pictures were taken 
wrong. They never called me,” she said, “and suddenly becomes I was here 
illegally, I was married before. I was, like, ‘yeah, find the husband I was 
with before I was with my husband.’”

“Every story, it’s a female! It’s a female reporter!” she said. “It’s 
unacceptable.”

“I know he respects women, but he’s defending his, because they are lies,” 
Trump said, of her husband’s attacks on his accusers’ looks and credibility.

Despite siding with her husband during the controversies of the past two 
weeks, Trump indicated that she has cautioned their young son, Barron, from 
using similar language.

“I let him have a normal childhood as possible - we talk a lot, a lot about 
the campaign. We talk about the language, because we don’t allow the using that 
language,” Trump said. “I tell him that, there are consequences as well, and he 
needs to be careful of the langue he uses.”

“It was my decision not to be on the campaign trail,” Trump said. “I will be a 
parent to our boy, to our child.”

While she stands back, Trump said, her husband is happy to be leading the 
charge.

“He will fight ’til the end - and he will fight for the American people as he 
fight for himself.”
 
Speaking to CNN’s Anderson Cooper in her first televised interview since the 
release of video that showed her husband bragging about sexually assaulting 
women, Melania Trump defended her husband’s “boy talk” as having been “egged 
on” by a television interviewer.

“I said to my husband that, you know, the language was unappropriate,” Trump 
said. “It’s not acceptable. And I was surprised, because that is not the man 
that I know.”

Trump, breaking the traditional role of candidate’s spouse as 
cheerleader-in-chief, has largely eschewed appearances on the campaign trail 
following speculation that her speech at the Republican National Convention in 
Julyplagiarized Michelle Obama’s 2008 address 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-republican-convention-plagiarism-michelle-obama>
 to the Democratic National Convention. This makes the Slovenian-born former 
model’s appearance with Cooper notable even ifmore than a dozen allegations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations>
 of sexual impropriety had not been leveled against her husband over the past 
week.

“Every Friday something comes out,” Trump told Cooper, dismissing the 
controversies that have followed her husband since he announced his candidacy 
for the White House last June.

“It’s very hard, especially for him,” she continued, “because he did so many 
stuff in his life. He was on so many tapes, so many shows. And we knew that, 
that, you know, tapes will come out, people will want to go against him. But my 
husband is real, he’s raw. He tells it like it is.”

Asked about whether she views her husband’s behavior in the video as 
“locker-room” stuff, as he has characterized it, Trump agreed.

“It’s kind of two teenage boys - actually, they should behave better,” Trump 
said. “I know how some men talk - that’s how I saw it.”

No matter the subject matter, she continued, Trump does not view her husband’s 
remarks in the video as descriptive of sexual assault.

“No, that’s not a sexual assault,” Trump said. “He didn’t say he did it, and I 
see many many women coming to him and giving phone numbers, and want to work 
for him and inappropriate stuff from women. And they know he’s married.”

“Every assault should be taken care of in court of law,” Trump said, but the 
accusations made in the media are “damaging and it’s unfair.”


“I believe my husband. This was all organized from the opposition,” Trump 
said. “They don’t have any facts and even the story that came out in People 
Magazine, the writer that she said that my husband took her to the room and 
start kissing her, she wrote in the same story about me that she saw me on 
Fifth Avenue and I said to her, Natasha, how come we don’t see you anymore? I 
was never friend with her. I’d never recognize her.”

“How we could believe her? That never happened.”

Despite the pressures of the campaign on her marriage, Trump said, she does 
not want people feeling bad for her.

“People think and talk about me like, ‘oh Melania, oh poor Melania.’ Don’t 
feel sorry for me, don’t feel sorry for me. I can handle everything.”
