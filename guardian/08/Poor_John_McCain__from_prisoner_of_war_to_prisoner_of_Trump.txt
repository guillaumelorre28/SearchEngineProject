It occurred to me only recently that it’s never going to happen. Even if 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> loses the race 
in November, he’ll act as if he’s won. He’ll repeatedly explain how, by many 
different measures, he was the true victor. He’ll blame others for whatever 
went wrong and insist that the outcome suits him perfectly anyway, because he’s 
a billionaire and therefore immune to dissatisfaction or regret. The bit where 
he loses and feels bad about himself, that’s never coming. And, of course, he 
might actually win.

Instead it’s the Republican party that’s going to lose and feel bad about 
itself, whether Trump is victorious or not. It’s not yet clear precisely how 
this disaster will pan out, but here’s a telling example of what’s already 
happening. John McCain is a widely respected Republican senator. He may have
lost the 2008 presidential election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/30/joe-biden-2008-election-john-mccain-obama>
 to Obama, but heheld his Arizona senate seat two years later 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Arizona,_2010> 
with 59% of the vote. He’s also a former prisoner of war, and when Trump 
implied that McCaindidn’t qualify as a war hero because he’d been captured 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/06/donald-trump-win-republican-debate>
 (this was back in July last year) it seemed like one of those sufficiently 
stupid moments. It wasn’t.

McCain, understandably, doesn’t like Trump much. In March he expressed 
concerns over “Mr Trump’s uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on 
national security issues”. But just last month he said of Trump:“I think he 
could be a capable leader.”

This about-face is also understandable: after 30 years in the Senate, McCain 
is facing a tough primary fight against a Tea Party opponent 
<http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/07/15/mccain-facing-tea-party-favorite-in-primary/>
. But in Arizona, where a third of the electorate are Hispanic, his tepid 
endorsement of Trump has gone down badly, and current polls put him in anear 
tie with his Democratic rival, Ann Kirkpatrick 
<http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/273634-mccain-faces-toughest-reelection-of-his-career>
. Supporting Trump hurts him; disavowing Trump hurts him. He can’t win. If only 
one could say the same about Trump.

In the 28 years I’ve lived in London, I’ve never bothered to learn the names 
of the birds. I can confidently identify amagpie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/18/silver-magpie-shine-research>
, but that’s about it. Knowing the names of American birds is no help – your 
robins don’t really look likeAmerican robins 
<http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/Robins-and-the-Christmas-story-2422226.php>
, because they are not related.

None of this would be a problem if my wife hadn’t suddenly put up a bird 
feeder and become terribly interested in them. She knows I spend most of my 
working day staring out of the window, and now whenever she returns home she 
wants a full report of what’s been happening in the garden, bird-wise.

“Not much this afternoon,” I say. “Just a couple of supermarket birds.”

“What?” she says.

“You know, supermarket birds. They live under trolleys in the car park.”

“Do you mean starlings?”

“Yeah, whatever, Professor,” I say. Perhaps it’s time I bought a book.

An inbox full of blessings

I’ve just become resigned to the fact that the bike shop I visited last week 
is now going to send me two emails a day for the rest of my life. These join 
the daily offers sent by a website from which I ordered seeds four years ago, 
the annual birthday wishes I get from a van hire company I once patronised, and 
those weekly nudges sent by a US floral delivery service too impatient to wait 
for someone else I know to die.

I never unsubscribe from these things, partly because in my experience this 
has no effect beyond generating an additional unwanted message – but mostly 
because these days I consider every email I receive that requires no answer to 
be a tiny blessing. I can only apologise for my silence, Ironmongery Direct.
