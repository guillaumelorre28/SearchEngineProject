CHEAP EATS

McCune Smith Cafe

This sharp, modish, East End cafe, with its Harris tweed lampshades and 
shelves lined with deli goods, provokes an evangelical enthusiasm in its 
regulars. The pastrami sandwich – just £3.80 to take away – was a sandwich of 
the gods. Every element was terrific, from the unusually light, fresh rye bread 
to the sweet, crunchy homemade red onion coleslaw. This was a sandwich that had 
been lovingly assembled. A flat white was equally precise, the coffee’s 
roasted, chocolatey notes asserting themselves amid expertly textured, velvety 
milk.
• Takeaway breakfast items from £1.60, lunch from £2.20. 3-5 Duke Street, 
0141-548 1114,mccunesmith.co.uk <http://www.mccunesmith.co.uk/>

The Hyndland Fox

Even at night, this West End newbie serves big salads, gourmet sandwiches and 
a handful of mains, such as coq au vin or pappardelle with artichoke and roast 
peppers, for under £10. By day, such dishes are joined by a full complement of 
all-day brunch plates. Eggs Benedict, served not with ham but with dry-cure 
bacon, was A1, the hollandaise silky but nicely acidulated. The space, like the 
background music, is a bit MOR but clearly the lure of good food is trumping 
any concerns about interior design.
• Breakfast from £3.50, light dishes from £6, mains from £8. 43 Clarence 
Drive, 0141-341 6633,thehyndlandfox.co.uk <http://www.thehyndlandfox.co.uk/>

Singl-end

The gorgeous stuffed and topped breads, focaccia and pizzas by the entrance, 
or the trays of roasted vegetables spilling out of the open kitchen, give you a 
sense of what this Italian is about. Swerving trattoria cliches, this is an 
interestingly designed basement space (a mishmash of post-industrial and Amalfi 
coast influences) that aims to serve fresh, affordable dishes using a mixture 
of first-rate ingredients and Puglian peasant savvy: a couple could share some 
sort of bread, a salad and a couple of hot dishes for about £16.
• Lunch dishes £3.95-£5.95. 265 Renfrew Street, 0141-611 7270, singl-end.com 
<http://singl-end.com/>

The Glad Cafe

A short walk from Hampden Park, which hosts the track and field events during 
the Commonwealth Games, the cafe at this Southside arts hub/music venue is a 
non-profit social enterprise, with fair prices and high quality. Glad’s rarebit 
was the real deal: a proper grain mustard and Worcester-spiked paste, on 
toasted slices of the house Crossmyloaf, a rustic bread made for the Glad Cafe 
by West End artisan bakery-cafeKember & Jones <http://www.kemberandjones.co.uk/>
. In the evening, sharing platters of continental meats and/or cheeses are the 
main attraction.
• Breakfast from £2.50, lunch from £4.50, sharing plates from £8.95. 1006a 
Pollokshaws Road, Shawlands, 0141-636 6119,thegladcafe.co.uk 
<http://www.thegladcafe.co.uk/>

Babu Bombay Street Kitchen

This small, colourful basement space, decorated with Bollywood posters and 
imported Indian groceries, is much-loved for its daily curries and specialities 
such as itsdhokla, a baked rice and semolina cake from Gujarat. Owners Rachna 
Deer and Gail Finlayson play irreverently with tradition, serving their curries 
not just with rice but also with traditional Scottish morning rolls. Babu’s
bhurji pau sees one filled with spicy scrambled eggs, for the ultimate 
Scots-Indian crossover.
• Breakfast from £3.50, snacks and meals from £2.50. 186 West Regent Street,

Given the ubiquity of its beers in Glasgow’s bars, you might wonder why 
Alloa’s William Bros felt the need to open one of their own. But they did, and, 
not unsurprisingly, Inn Deep is a cracker. Whether by accident or design, its 
fridges seem to contain not just the biggest names in craft beer, but, 
arguably, and more specifically, the best beers (Kernel’s London Sour, 
Beavertown’s Gamma Ray, Marble’s Dobber) from each of those A1 micros. In the 
modern pantheon, these are iconic beers. Inn Deep itself is a cool space. Built 
into an arch beneath Kelvinbridge, it has a riverside terrace area that feeds 
into Kelvingrove Park.
• Pint from £2.90. 445 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, inndeep.com 
<http://www.inndeep.com/>

Brel Bar 

If less-discriminating mates have dragged you into the noisy, neon-flashing 
cluster of restaurants and bars around Ashton Lane, Brel Bar may prove a 
lifesaver. As the name suggests, Brel originally majored on Belgian beers and 
it retains a core of gems from Belgium and Germany. However, that has expanded 
to include a cask pump rotating beers from Glasgow brewery Kelburn, Joker IPA 
on keg, and a modest but high-quality range of US and British craft beers. Brel 
feels like a boozy, no-frills, no-nonsense late-night drinking den. Yet, out 
back, it has a large and lovely beer garden. On a warm summer’s night, it is 
the perfect place to escape the crowds.
• Pint from £3.40. Ashton Lane, brelbar.com <http://www.brelbar.com/>

West

Amid the beautiful parkland and grand buildings of Glasgow Green is West, a 
Bavarian-style bierkeller, brewery and restaurant. On a sunny lunchtime, West 
was clearly gearing up for a very busy day, as drinkers spilled out on to the 
astroturfed terrace. They had even put Post Office-style barriers up to, 
presumably, manage the expected queue at the bar.
• Pint from £3.50. Templeton Building, Glasgow Green, westbeer.com 
<https://westbeer.com/>

The 78

If you are looking for an experience unique to Glasgow, try the 78 in 
Finnieston. It’s a vegan cafe-bar – and, on Thursday nights, a reggae and 
dancehall hotspot – it serves vegan-friendly and often organic beers from 
William Bros (12 bottles and three weekly rotating cask beers), Sam Smiths and 
Scottish brewery Black Isle. Be warned, though, such eco-friendly drinking does 
not come cheap.
• Pint from £3.30. 10-14 Kelvinhaugh Street, 0141-576 5018, the78cafebar.com 
<http://www.the78cafebar.com/>

The Squid & Whale 

A trendy bar and Mexican cantina, the Squid & Whale is big on cocktails but 
carries a serviceable craft beer range. In the fridges you will find a 
selection of William Bros bottles, a Mexican craft beer called Red Pig, and 
others from the big US craft breweries, Brooklyn, Anchor, Founders, Sierra 
Nevada.
• Bottles from £3.40. 372-374 Great Western Road, squidwhale.com

NIGHTLIFE

Subclub

With its low ceiling, wall of speakers and bodysonic dance floor, Glasgow’s 
historic Subclub is literally tingling with vibrations. Add to this 400 people 
going nuts to world-class DJs, throwing their tops in the air and chanting 
along to dance music melodies, and it’s easy to see why this club, which opened 
in 1987, has earned a reputation as one of the best in the country.
• 22 Jamaica Street, subclub.co.uk <http://www.subclub.co.uk>. Open Tues-Sun 
11pm-3am

Mono

This vegan cafe, microbrewery and venue is a one-stop culture shack. Sharing a 
roof with Monorail record store and the Good Press Gallery, a ’zine store and 
show space, it epitomises the intersection of the city’s art and music scenes. 
As well as playing host to the likes of Belle and Sebastian, Mogwai and Franz 
Ferdinand – the city’s original art school rockers – the venue is a place for 
new bands to cut their teeth.

A tiny club in the basement of Max’s Bar, this is another late-night venue 
that you can expect to find crammed full of people dancing with the kind of 
energy that makes Glasgow’s nightlife scene special. The sweaty 200-capacity 
room calls in big names to play in an intimate setting, where they blast out 
electronic sounds through its Funktion-One soundsystem.
• 73 Queen Street, maxsbar.co.uk <http://www.maxsbar.co.uk/>. Open daily until 
3am

The Berkeley Suite

There’s a dreamy David Lynch-esque feel to this bar and “ballroom” in a former 
Victorian pub. Art-deco chandeliers, matched with dim red lighting, a smoke 
machine haze and a retro-looking DJ booth make the club feel almost like 
Glasgow’s answer to Paris’sSilencio <http://silencio-club.com/en> – without the 
icy door staff and extorniate prices. It’s a strangely sophisticated space 
where you can expect to see anyone from Mungo’s Hi Fi to James Murphy behind 
the decks.
• 237 North Street, berkeleysuite.com <http://www.berkeleysuite.com/>. Open 
daily 11pm-3am

Nice’n’Sleazy

Bang in the middle of Glasgow, this delicately named bar and basement venue 
hosts an endless stream of indie gigs and club nights. Expect to hear resident 
DJs upstairs playing moody rock, post punk and garage, while bands thrash it 
out on stage below. It also sells Buckfast by the glass, making it a veritable 
place to drop by on any late night meander through the city.
