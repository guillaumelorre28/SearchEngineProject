Today in Campaign 2016

Scott Bixby

Did one of your former colleagues compare you to the Prince of Darkness and 
tell the world that you are the least agreeable “son of a bitch” that they’d 
ever had the misfortune of working with? No? Then you had a better day than 
Texas senatorTed Cruz, who was put on blast in a speech former House speaker 
John Boehner gave to college students 
<http://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/04/28/john-boehner-talks-election-time-in-office/>
 that was equal parts fire and brimstone.

“Lucifer in the flesh,” Boehner told an audience at Stanford University last 
night,according to the Stanford Daily 
<http://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/04/28/john-boehner-talks-election-time-in-office/>
. “I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost 
everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my 
life.”

In a week when we thought nothing could get more bizarre than vice 
presidential would-beCarly Fiorina bursting into song 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/apr/28/carly-fiorina-sings-lullaby-as-she-becomes-ted-cruzs-running-mate-video>
, today was really a feat of political imagination. Here’s a quick rundown of 
the biggest news from the campaign trail today:

 * After Boehner’s “Lucifer in the flesh” comments (sidenote: We’re going to 
start giving this review about normal stuff and people: “How was brunch?” “It 
was Lucifer in the flesh. A miserable son of a bitch.”) the Texas senator 
distanced himself from the former House speaker, telling reporters in a news 
conference in Fort Wayne, Indiana, that he had only met Boehner a handful of 
times. “He allowed his inner Trump to come out,” Cruz added. 
 * Speak of the Devil and he doth appear: Donald Trump lucked out with today’s 
Luciferian news cycle, and picked up the endorsement of House transportation 
committee chair Bill Shuster to boot. Throw in the resigned endorsement of 
formerMitt Romney aide Ron Kaufman - who compared Trump to Ronald Reagan - and 
he’s got himself a party. 
 * While Trump is making nice with members of Congress and the Republican 
establishment, it seems like his two opponents for the Republican nomination 
can’t even go 24 hours without betraying one another. . A short few days after 
a strategic alignment between Cruz and Ohio governorJohn Kasich implied that 
the two would work together to deny Trump the nomination, and Cruz is already 
backing down from the deal. “I recognize that the media is all eager to talk 
about an alliance,” Cruz said in the same press conference. “There is no 
alliance.” 
 * Cut to John Weaver, a senior adviser to Kasich, tweeting this:
John Weaver (@JWGOP) 
I can't stand liars.
 <https://twitter.com/JWGOP/status/725715485526884352> April 28, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/JWGOP/status/725715485526884352> 
 * What could that be about? 
 * As for the Democrats, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton unveiled a 
literal “Woman Card” for her supporters, piggybacking on remarks made by Trump 
that she has characterized as sexist. (The cards are modeled after New York 
City’s MetroCards, buthopefully swipe easier 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCkt0CHb0G8>.) 
 * Meanwhile, with his hopes of winning the Democratic nomination fading, 
Vermont senatorBernie Sanders is hoping to make his mark on the Democratic 
party in another way - by reshaping the nomination process to allow 
non-Democrats to have their say. 
That’s it for news from the campaign trail - tune in tomorrow for more 
up-to-the-second updates from the campaign.

Cruz mailer: If Trump wins Indiana, nomination could be 'all but determined'

Gloom and doom is the attitude of the day over at the newly minted 
Cruz/Fiorina campaign headquarters, as the Texas senator’s campaign sends out a 
mailer to supporters warning them that if he loses theIndiana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/indiana> primary on May 3, billionaire 
frontrunner Donald Trump’s march to the Republican presidential nomination 
could be “all but determined.”

“In just five days, Hoosiers will cast their votes to determine which 
candidate will capture their 57 delegates. This is the single, biggest, most 
important day for our campaign so far,” Cruz writes. “Carly and I are 
barnstorming Indiana to capture every last vote – as we fight to win the GOP 
nomination. I can’t emphasize enough how important the vote in Indiana is going 
to be, and frankly, it could be the deciding factor. Friend, let me be blunt: I 
can’t win Indiana – and this nomination – if you don’t step forward right now.”

Cruz tells voters that “Indiana is absolutely pivotal,” and that “if Trump 
wins all the delegates in Indiana, his nomination could be all but determined.”

Perennial presidential candidate and former consumer advocate Ralph Nader told 
CNN today that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders should not drop out of the race 
for the Democratic presidential nomination, in part because Democratic 
frontrunnerHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>
 could be indicted.
CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) 
"Why should Bernie Sanders drop out?" -- Ralph Nader in an interview with 
@CarolCNN <https://twitter.com/CarolCNN> https://t.co/Hp7ytDHt0H 
<https://t.co/Hp7ytDHt0H>
 <https://twitter.com/CNNnewsroom/status/725697198244122624> April 28, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/CNNnewsroom/status/725697198244122624> 
“Why why should Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> drop out?” Nader, a former 
Green party nominee, asked CNN Newsroom. “There could be a scandal with Hillary 
Clinton. Those transcripts and closed door meetings with the big bankers and 
other corporations could be released.”

Asked what he would do in Sanders’ position, Nader dodged.

“Well, I would never have run in the Democratic Party, so that’s a question I 
cannot answer,” Nader said. “[Sanders] ran in the Democratic party and he’s 
doing very, very well. In fact, if independent voters could vote in those 
primaries this last Tuesday, he would have won them all.”

It’s the largest legal push against LGBT rights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/lgbt-rights> in memory, according to Eunice 
Rho, advocacy and policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. She 
told the Guardian that in 2016 more than 150 such bills have been proposed 
across the nation, many in the south. “It’s politically driven,” she said. 
“Politicians are preying on people’s fears of the unfamiliar.”

On Wednesday, Tennessee <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tennessee> 
governor Bill Haslam signed a bill into law that moves the argument in a new 
direction: it allows therapists and counselors to reject certain clients if the 
therapy goes against the practitioner’s “sincerely held principles”. It’s being 
widely interpreted as a loophole allowing therapists to reject gay, lesbian, 
transgender and other clients.

Haslam has since issued a written statement saying that’s a misinterpretation. 
“The substance of this bill doesn’t address a group, issue or belief system,” 
he wrote. “I believe it is reasonable to allow these professionals to determine 
if and when an individual would be better served by another counselor better 
suited to meet his or her needs.”

An unbound Republican delegate in Pennsylvania who had previously endorsed 
John Kasich appears to have resigned himself to the fact that billionaire 
Republican frontrunnerDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is the presumptive nominee - 
and says he would never vote for Texas senator Ted Cruz.

“I would never vote for Ted Cruz,” former New Hampshire senator Judd Gregg 
told a local ABC affiliate 
<http://www.wmur.com/politics/gregg-blasts-cruz-as-demagogues-demagogue/39269308>
 in Manchester, New Hampshire. “I’d write in Paul Ryan or someone before I’d 
vote for Ted Cruz.”

“I presume Donald Trump is going to be the nominee,” Gregg, a two-term 
senator, said, before calling Cruz “a person of little character. He’s a 
demagogue’s demagogue and he shouldn’t be trusted with the responsibilities of 
the office.”

“I presume I’d vote for the Republican nominee if it is Trump, but Cruz should 
be nowhere near the presidency.”

John Kasich <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich> told spectators 
at an Oregon town hall event that Donald Trump’s hopes of swaying unbound 
delegates to support his bid for the Republican nomination are unfounded, and 
that if he wants to become the nominee, “he better get exactly what he needs.”

“When you have a 73% negative rating among married women and you think you are 
going to the convention, and you lose 15 straight polls toHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, and you get crushed in 
the electoral college, and we know that if you are the nominee, you’re going to 
lose the senate, the supreme court, the courthouse and the state house...” 
Kasich told the crowd, “I don’t think so.”

Trump has the support of 953 bound delegates and 41 unbound delegates, putting 
him at994 total delegates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/25/us-election-2016-delegate-tracker-trump-cruz-kasich-sanders-clinton>
, within striking distance of the 1,237 needed to clinch the Republican 
nomination. Neither Kasich nor fellow Republican hopeful Ted Cruz can feasibly 
acquire the necessary number of delegates to reach that threshold before the 
party’s convention in July.

An organization dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism has issued a statement 
urging billionaire Republican frontrunnerDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to reconsider the use of 
“America First” as his “ill-advised” campaign slogan to describe his foreign 
policy doctrine.

“The most noteworthy leader of the ‘America First Committee’ was Charles 
Lindbergh, who sympathized with the Nazis and whose rhetoric was characterized 
by anti-Semitism and offensive stereotypes, including assertions that Jews 
posed a threat to the US because of their influence in motion pictures, radio, 
the press, and the government,” wrote the Anti-Defamation League inin a 
statement. 
<http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/anti-semitism-usa/adl-urges-donald-trump-to-reconsider-america-first.html#.VyKRbqODGko>

“The undercurrents of anti-Semitism and bigotry that characterized the America 
First movement – including the assumption that Jews who opposed the movement 
had their own agenda and were not acting in America’s best interest – is 
fortunately not a major concern today,” said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO of the 
Anti-Defamation League.

“However, for many Americans, the term ‘America First’ will always be 
associated with and tainted by this history. In a political season that already 
has prompted a national conversation about civility and tolerance, choosing a 
call to action historically associated with incivility and intolerance seems 
ill-advised.”

At an event in Oregon, Ohio governor and Republican candidate for president 
John Kasich <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich> told supporters 
that after Donald Trump’s electoral wipeout earlier this week, he had 
considered dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination.

“I thought about, ‘Should I keep going? Should I carry on? What is this all 
about?’” Kasich said. But in the end, it came down to a conversation with his 
wife.

“I was down home yesterday for a short time, and things were a little bit 
crazy... and I saw my wife carrying some clothes from the upstairs bedroom down 
into the closet in the basement and I said, ‘here, lemme grab some of that,” 
Kasich said.

“And I said, ‘what do you think, sweetie? I’m inclined to keep going.’ She 
looked at me, she said - just simple words because she’s not a politician - she 
said, ‘The people need a choice, and if you don’t give ‘em a choice, who will?’”

“And so I’ve decided to keep going,” he concluded, to loud applause.

In an interview with Politico 
<http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/massachusetts/2016/04/8597834/ex-romney-aide-compares-trump-reagan-says-hell-win>
, a former high-ranking member of Mitt Romney’s failed 2012 presidential 
campaign has compared billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump to party 
icon Ronald Reagan, and said that Trump will win the nomination.

“You could sense a more growing sense of reality that, in fact, Trump is going 
to be the nominee,” said Ron Kaufman, a former advisor to Romney and one of the 
main engineers of his presidential campaign in 2012. “He was a populist more 
than a conservative,” Kaufman said of Reagan. “He was a western populist; Trump 
is an eastern populist.”

Romney returned to the national stage years after his loss with a blistering 
indictment of Trump, dubbing the frontrunner “a phony” and “a fraud” in an

Poll: Republican party's favorability drops to lowest point since 1992

A survey of 2,008 American adults conducted by the Pew Research Center 
<http://www.people-press.org/2016/04/28/gops-favorability-rating-edges-lower/> 
has found that the public’s negative opinion of the Republican party has spiked 
to levels not seen in nearly a quarter-century.

Only 33% of the American public has a favorable view of the Republican party, 
while nearly two-thirds - 62% - say that they have an unfavorable view of the 
party. It’s an increase in negative views of the party from last October, when 
a still-not-great 58% told Pew Research Center that they viewed the Republican 
party unfavorably.

The frustration with the direction of the party has even passed on to 
card-carrying members of the party, only 68% of whom view the Republican party 
positively. By comparison, the Democratic party is viewed positively by 88% of 
its members. Just 28% of independents view the Republican party favorably.

9.51pm BST 21:51  <> 

Donald Trump’s big foreign policy speech at the National Press Club in 
Washington, DC yesterday has received acold reception 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/opinion/donald-trump-to-world-im-willing-to-walk.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share&_r=0>
 from the editorial board of the New York Times, which derided the address as 
failing to exhibit “much grasp of the complexity of the world, understanding of 
the balance or exercise of power, or even a careful reading of history.”

In an editorial titled Donald Trump’s Strange Worldview, the Grey Lady’s 
editorial board summed up a potential “Trump Doctrine” as: “When one has a 
hammer, everything looks like a nail. And when one’s experience is limited to 
real estate deals, everything looks like a lease negotiation.”

This unilateral approach makes for good television, but this is the real 
world, in which other nations have agendas, too. Mr. Trump says he is ‘going to 
be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are 
at risk from radical Islamic violence.’ But how will he gain cooperation for 
his ‘unpredictable’ war on the Islamic State while enforcing a ‘pause’ that 
prevents Muslims from entering this country, and forcing those living here to 
register themselves?

How does one ‘apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea,’ while 
slapping a trade-killing tariff on Chinese imports? It’s correct that many of 
our NATO allies aren’t paying their agreed-upon share of its costs - but what 
happens to the United States’ overseas bases if we ‘walk?’

The editorial concludes that Trump has failed to demonstrate “any willingness 
to learn or to correct his past errors. For someone who claims he is ready to 
lead the free world, that is inexcusable.”

Did one of your former colleagues compare you to the Prince of Darkness and 
tell the world that you are the least agreeable “son of a bitch” that they’d 
ever had the misfortune of working with? No? Then you had a better day than 
Texas senatorTed Cruz, who was put on blast in a speech former House speaker 
John Boehner gave to college students 
<http://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/04/28/john-boehner-talks-election-time-in-office/>
 that was equal parts fire and brimstone.

“Lucifer in the flesh,” Boehner told an audience at Stanford University last 
night,according to the Stanford Daily 
<http://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/04/28/john-boehner-talks-election-time-in-office/>
. “I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost 
everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my 
life.”

In a week when we thought nothing could get more bizarre than vice 
presidential would-beCarly Fiorina bursting into song 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/apr/28/carly-fiorina-sings-lullaby-as-she-becomes-ted-cruzs-running-mate-video>
, today was really a feat of political imagination. Here’s a quick rundown of 
the biggest news from the campaign trail today:

 * After Boehner’s “Lucifer in the flesh” comments (sidenote: We’re going to 
start giving this review about normal stuff and people: “How was brunch?” “It 
was Lucifer in the flesh. A miserable son of a bitch.”) the Texas senator 
distanced himself from the former House speaker, telling reporters in a news 
conference in Fort Wayne, Indiana, that he had only met Boehner a handful of 
times. “He allowed his inner Trump to come out,” Cruz added. 
 * Speak of the Devil and he doth appear: Donald Trump lucked out with today’s 
Luciferian news cycle, and picked up the endorsement of House transportation 
committee chair Bill Shuster to boot. Throw in the resigned endorsement of 
formerMitt Romney aide Ron Kaufman - who compared Trump to Ronald Reagan - and 
he’s got himself a party. 
 * While Trump is making nice with members of Congress and the Republican 
establishment, it seems like his two opponents for the Republican nomination 
can’t even go 24 hours without betraying one another. . A short few days after 
a strategic alignment between Cruz and Ohio governorJohn Kasich implied that 
the two would work together to deny Trump the nomination, and Cruz is already 
backing down from the deal. “I recognize that the media is all eager to talk 
about an alliance,” Cruz said in the same press conference. “There is no 
alliance.” 
 * Cut to John Weaver, a senior adviser to Kasich, tweeting this:
John Weaver (@JWGOP) 
I can't stand liars.
 <https://twitter.com/JWGOP/status/725715485526884352> April 28, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/JWGOP/status/725715485526884352> 
 * What could that be about? 
 * As for the Democrats, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton unveiled a 
literal “Woman Card” for her supporters, piggybacking on remarks made by Trump 
that she has characterized as sexist. (The cards are modeled after New York 
City’s MetroCards, buthopefully swipe easier 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCkt0CHb0G8>.) 
 * Meanwhile, with his hopes of winning the Democratic nomination fading, 
Vermont senatorBernie Sanders is hoping to make his mark on the Democratic 
party in another way - by reshaping the nomination process to allow 
non-Democrats to have their say. 
That’s it for news from the campaign trail - tune in tomorrow for more 
up-to-the-second updates from the campaign.
 
White powder has been found in the mail room at Trump Tower in Midtown

The powder, discovered at roughly 8:15 pm in the fifth-floor mailroom of the 
mixed-use skyscraper, which houses the campaign headquarters of theDonald Trump

headquarters of the Trump Organization and Trump’s penthouse residence.

The affected floor has been evacuated, and police, fire and emergency services

A movie trailer about the unlikely film depicting the first date between 
Barack Obama and his wife Michelle has dropped.

The film, Southside with You, is a romantic dramedy and focuses on the 
couple’s first date in 1989, which featured a trip to the Art Institute of 
Chicago, a viewing of Spike Lee’s Do The Right Thing and their first kiss 
outside an ice cream parlor. The film premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film 
Festival and hasreceived positive reviews 
<http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/southside_with_you/?search=Southside%20with%20You>
.

The film is scheduled to be released on August 26.
 
Gloom and doom is the attitude of the day over at the newly minted 
Cruz/Fiorina campaign headquarters, as the Texas senator’s campaign sends out a 
mailer to supporters warning them that if he loses theIndiana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/indiana> primary on May 3, billionaire 
frontrunner Donald Trump’s march to the Republican presidential nomination 
could be “all but determined.”

“In just five days, Hoosiers will cast their votes to determine which 
candidate will capture their 57 delegates. This is the single, biggest, most 
important day for our campaign so far,” Cruz writes. “Carly and I are 
barnstorming Indiana to capture every last vote – as we fight to win the GOP 
nomination. I can’t emphasize enough how important the vote in Indiana is going 
to be, and frankly, it could be the deciding factor. Friend, let me be blunt: I 
can’t win Indiana – and this nomination – if you don’t step forward right now.”

Cruz tells voters that “Indiana is absolutely pivotal,” and that “if Trump 
wins all the delegates in Indiana, his nomination could be all but determined.”

 
Perennial presidential candidate and former consumer advocate Ralph Nader told 
CNN today that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders should not drop out of the race 
for the Democratic presidential nomination, in part because Democratic 
frontrunnerHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>
 could be indicted.
CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) 
"Why should Bernie Sanders drop out?" -- Ralph Nader in an interview with 
@CarolCNN <https://twitter.com/CarolCNN> https://t.co/Hp7ytDHt0H 
<https://t.co/Hp7ytDHt0H>
 <https://twitter.com/CNNnewsroom/status/725697198244122624> April 28, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/CNNnewsroom/status/725697198244122624> 
“Why why should Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> drop out?” Nader, a former 
Green party nominee, asked CNN Newsroom. “There could be a scandal with Hillary 
Clinton. Those transcripts and closed door meetings with the big bankers and 
other corporations could be released.”

Asked what he would do in Sanders’ position, Nader dodged.

“Well, I would never have run in the Democratic Party, so that’s a question I 
cannot answer,” Nader said. “[Sanders] ran in the Democratic party and he’s 
doing very, very well. In fact, if independent voters could vote in those 
primaries this last Tuesday, he would have won them all.”

It’s the largest legal push against LGBT rights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/lgbt-rights> in memory, according to Eunice 
Rho, advocacy and policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. She 
told the Guardian that in 2016 more than 150 such bills have been proposed 
across the nation, many in the south. “It’s politically driven,” she said. 
“Politicians are preying on people’s fears of the unfamiliar.”

On Wednesday, Tennessee <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tennessee> 
governor Bill Haslam signed a bill into law that moves the argument in a new 
direction: it allows therapists and counselors to reject certain clients if the 
therapy goes against the practitioner’s “sincerely held principles”. It’s being 
widely interpreted as a loophole allowing therapists to reject gay, lesbian, 
transgender and other clients.

Haslam has since issued a written statement saying that’s a misinterpretation. 
“The substance of this bill doesn’t address a group, issue or belief system,” 
he wrote. “I believe it is reasonable to allow these professionals to determine 
if and when an individual would be better served by another counselor better 
suited to meet his or her needs.”

An unbound Republican delegate in Pennsylvania who had previously endorsed 
John Kasich appears to have resigned himself to the fact that billionaire 
Republican frontrunnerDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is the presumptive nominee - 
and says he would never vote for Texas senator Ted Cruz.

“I would never vote for Ted Cruz,” former New Hampshire senator Judd Gregg 
told a local ABC affiliate 
<http://www.wmur.com/politics/gregg-blasts-cruz-as-demagogues-demagogue/39269308>
 in Manchester, New Hampshire. “I’d write in Paul Ryan or someone before I’d 
vote for Ted Cruz.”

“I presume Donald Trump is going to be the nominee,” Gregg, a two-term 
senator, said, before calling Cruz “a person of little character. He’s a 
demagogue’s demagogue and he shouldn’t be trusted with the responsibilities of 
the office.”

“I presume I’d vote for the Republican nominee if it is Trump, but Cruz should 
be nowhere near the presidency.”
 
John Kasich <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich> told spectators 
at an Oregon town hall event that Donald Trump’s hopes of swaying unbound 
delegates to support his bid for the Republican nomination are unfounded, and 
that if he wants to become the nominee, “he better get exactly what he needs.”

“When you have a 73% negative rating among married women and you think you are 
going to the convention, and you lose 15 straight polls toHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, and you get crushed in 
the electoral college, and we know that if you are the nominee, you’re going to 
lose the senate, the supreme court, the courthouse and the state house...” 
Kasich told the crowd, “I don’t think so.”

Trump has the support of 953 bound delegates and 41 unbound delegates, putting 
him at994 total delegates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/25/us-election-2016-delegate-tracker-trump-cruz-kasich-sanders-clinton>
, within striking distance of the 1,237 needed to clinch the Republican 
nomination. Neither Kasich nor fellow Republican hopeful Ted Cruz can feasibly 
acquire the necessary number of delegates to reach that threshold before the 
party’s convention in July.
 
An organization dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism has issued a statement 
urging billionaire Republican frontrunnerDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to reconsider the use of 
“America First” as his “ill-advised” campaign slogan to describe his foreign 
policy doctrine.

“The most noteworthy leader of the ‘America First Committee’ was Charles 
Lindbergh, who sympathized with the Nazis and whose rhetoric was characterized 
by anti-Semitism and offensive stereotypes, including assertions that Jews 
posed a threat to the US because of their influence in motion pictures, radio, 
the press, and the government,” wrote the Anti-Defamation League inin a 
statement. 
<http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/anti-semitism-usa/adl-urges-donald-trump-to-reconsider-america-first.html#.VyKRbqODGko>

“The undercurrents of anti-Semitism and bigotry that characterized the America 
First movement – including the assumption that Jews who opposed the movement 
had their own agenda and were not acting in America’s best interest – is 
fortunately not a major concern today,” said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO of the 
Anti-Defamation League.

“However, for many Americans, the term ‘America First’ will always be 
associated with and tainted by this history. In a political season that already 
has prompted a national conversation about civility and tolerance, choosing a 
call to action historically associated with incivility and intolerance seems 
ill-advised.”

 
At an event in Oregon, Ohio governor and Republican candidate for president 
John Kasich <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-kasich> told supporters 
that after Donald Trump’s electoral wipeout earlier this week, he had 
considered dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination.

“I thought about, ‘Should I keep going? Should I carry on? What is this all 
about?’” Kasich said. But in the end, it came down to a conversation with his 
wife.

“I was down home yesterday for a short time, and things were a little bit 
crazy... and I saw my wife carrying some clothes from the upstairs bedroom down 
into the closet in the basement and I said, ‘here, lemme grab some of that,” 
Kasich said.

“And I said, ‘what do you think, sweetie? I’m inclined to keep going.’ She 
looked at me, she said - just simple words because she’s not a politician - she 
said, ‘The people need a choice, and if you don’t give ‘em a choice, who will?’”

“And so I’ve decided to keep going,” he concluded, to loud applause.
 
In an interview with Politico 
<http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/massachusetts/2016/04/8597834/ex-romney-aide-compares-trump-reagan-says-hell-win>
, a former high-ranking member of Mitt Romney’s failed 2012 presidential 
campaign has compared billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump to party 
icon Ronald Reagan, and said that Trump will win the nomination.

“You could sense a more growing sense of reality that, in fact, Trump is going 
to be the nominee,” said Ron Kaufman, a former advisor to Romney and one of the 
main engineers of his presidential campaign in 2012. “He was a populist more 
than a conservative,” Kaufman said of Reagan. “He was a western populist; Trump 
is an eastern populist.”

Romney returned to the national stage years after his loss with a blistering 
indictment of Trump, dubbing the frontrunner “a phony” and “a fraud” in an 
address in Salt Lake City, Utah.
 
A survey of 2,008 American adults conducted by the Pew Research Center 
<http://www.people-press.org/2016/04/28/gops-favorability-rating-edges-lower/> 
has found that the public’s negative opinion of the Republican party has spiked 
to levels not seen in nearly a quarter-century.

Only 33% of the American public has a favorable view of the Republican party, 
while nearly two-thirds - 62% - say that they have an unfavorable view of the 
party. It’s an increase in negative views of the party from last October, when 
a still-not-great 58% told Pew Research Center that they viewed the Republican 
party unfavorably.

The frustration with the direction of the party has even passed on to 
card-carrying members of the party, only 68% of whom view the Republican party 
positively. By comparison, the Democratic party is viewed positively by 88% of 
its members. Just 28% of independents view the Republican party favorably.
 
Donald Trump’s big foreign policy speech at the National Press Club in 
Washington, DC yesterday has received acold reception 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/opinion/donald-trump-to-world-im-willing-to-walk.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share&_r=0>
 from the editorial board of the New York Times, which derided the address as 
failing to exhibit “much grasp of the complexity of the world, understanding of 
the balance or exercise of power, or even a careful reading of history.”

In an editorial titled Donald Trump’s Strange Worldview, the Grey Lady’s 
editorial board summed up a potential “Trump Doctrine” as: “When one has a 
hammer, everything looks like a nail. And when one’s experience is limited to 
real estate deals, everything looks like a lease negotiation.”

This unilateral approach makes for good television, but this is the real 
world, in which other nations have agendas, too. Mr. Trump says he is ‘going to 
be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are 
at risk from radical Islamic violence.’ But how will he gain cooperation for 
his ‘unpredictable’ war on the Islamic State while enforcing a ‘pause’ that 
prevents Muslims from entering this country, and forcing those living here to 
register themselves?

How does one ‘apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea,’ while 
slapping a trade-killing tariff on Chinese imports? It’s correct that many of 
our NATO allies aren’t paying their agreed-upon share of its costs - but what 
happens to the United States’ overseas bases if we ‘walk?’

The editorial concludes that Trump has failed to demonstrate “any willingness 
to learn or to correct his past errors. For someone who claims he is ready to 
lead the free world, that is inexcusable.”
