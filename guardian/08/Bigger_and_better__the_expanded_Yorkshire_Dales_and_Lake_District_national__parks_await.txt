Sometimes, joining the dots works. Once upon a time northern England had two 
great national parks: theLake District 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/lakedistrict> and the Yorkshire Dales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/yorkshire>. In between was a heap of 
beautiful country – big-shouldered fells dotted with castles and cascades – but 
few people ventured there, believing that if it had not been included, it must 
be inferior.

<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/07/travel_national_parks/giv-12515DPTt58cAywOU/>
Now some bright spark has spotted the injustice, and the obvious solution: 
extend both those parks a little, adding two blocks of land to each, and the 
unfairly forgotten fringes suddenly become the centre, but without the summer 
crowds and traffic jams. There are still two parks – the Yorkshire Dales and 
the Lake District. Ravenstonedale, between the Lune and Eden valleys to the 
north-west of the Yorkshire Dales, is one of the largest new areas. Louise 
Dinnes, owner of theBlack Swan Hotel <http://www.blackswanhotel.com/> in the 
village of the same name, (see below) says: “We are a pocket of tranquillity 
right in the middle. You can walk for a week here and almost never see anyone.”

From 1 August, England will add 188 square miles of new national park, to 
bring the combined total ofLakes 
<http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/aboutus/news/news-pages/extension-to-the-national-park>
 andDales <http://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/about-the-dales/boundary-extension> 
to 1,753 square miles. Those miles contain superb opportunities for walking, 
touring, eating and adventuring. Obviously the new designation will have an 
effect on life in these areas – in planning decisions for example – but they 
will also benefit from national park marketing efforts. The main boost, 
however, may come from the simple recognition that these quiet corners are 
genuinely beautiful and worth visiting. Here are some of the highlights…

The largest of the four additions encompasses the Howgill Fells and 
Ravenstonedale (locals say “Russendale”). This area has plenty of interesting 
sights and an intriguingfoodie trail 
<https://nurturelakeland.org/uploads/Eden_Food_Trail_-_Web.pdf>, but the real 
attraction is the walking.

No walk sums up this area better than the route up the Mallerstang Valley to 
Pendragon Castle: great views, lots of interest, no other people. It can be 
started at Kirkby Stephen – where there are places to buy lunch supplies – or 
by parking a mile to the south in Croglam (and saving a mile). The walk heads 
south along the west bank of the Eden, passing the evocative ruins of 
Lammerside Castle, a Peel watchtower built to repel Scots marauders.

After some woods it reaches Pendragon Castle, reputedly built by King Arthur’s 
father. Crossing the Eden, it then circles back north on the east bank, passing 
the attractive village of Nateby, home to theNateby Inn 
<http://www.nateby-inn.co.uk/>. In Kirkby Stephen, there’s a great little cafe, 
thePink Geranium  
<http://www.kirkby-stephen.com/index.php/business/business-directory/item/the-pink-geranium-cafe>
 (40 Market Street), which welcomes cyclists, too.

This region boasts a lot of good eating options, and the second Saturday of 
each month sees Orton farmers’ market. Up to 40 stallholders offer local 
cheeses, pies, meat and preserves –Kitridding Farm 
<http://www.kitriddingfarmshop.co.uk/>’s minted lamb steaks are a favourite, as 
are the vanilla slices fromFat Flour Bakery <http://www.fatflourbakery.co.uk/>. 
The pretty village itself is also worth a look around.

Another feature of the land around Ravenstonedale is its high density of sites 
of special scientific interest. In one glorious stretch of upland limestone, 
there are three national nature reserves: in the east there’s Waitby 
Greenriggs, a wildflower sanctuary in an old railway cutting; Smardale Gill is 
one of only two places in England where the scotch argus butterfly is found; 
and to the west, Tarn Sike and Sunbiggin Tarn, a birdwatching honeypot, 
attracting all sorts of migratory birds.

Among places to stay is Bent’s Camping Barn <http://bentscampingbarn.co.uk/> 
(dorm bed £10 a night), an old, stone-built shepherd’s cottage with bunk beds, 
shared basic kitchen and electricity – just bring sleeping bag and food. The 
Howgill Fells are on the doorstep, or it’s a short walk down to the Smardale 
Gill reserve.

 The Black Swan in Ravenstonedale. 
For a bit more comfort, the Black Swan <http://www.blackswanhotel.com/> in 
Ravenstonedale has doubles from £85 B&B. There is local food galore on offer in 
its dining room, and a good range of local beers from breweries such as Tirril, 
Dent and Kirkby Lonsdale. There are always at least four cask ales on tap. 
Rooms are stylish, with big, bold floral patterns and vibrant colour schemes. A 
couple of miles down the road, theFat Lamb <http://www.fatlamb.co.uk/> (doubles 
£108 B&B) is another dependable option.

 Barbondale in the western Dales. Photograph: Alamy 
Almost due south of Ravenstonedale, the Yorkshire Dales south-west extension 
brings the park right to the edge of the pretty market town of Kirkby Lonsdale. 
It includes a lovely walk in Barbondale, reached by heading out of Kirkby 
Lonsdale to Ruskin’s View – the greatest view in England, according to the 
Victorian thinker – and then walking south down the Lune to cross at the 
Devil’s Bridge. From there, the route goes east towards Casterton Fell and 
Bullpot Farm, then cuts between High and Barbon Low Fell, taking the lovely 
beckside path back down to Barbon, where there’s a good pub, theBarbon Inn 
<http://www.barbon-inn.co.uk/>.

 The ‘other’ Borrowdale (not the one at Derwent Water), looking towards the 
Howgill Fells. Photograph: Alamy 
East of Kirkby Lonsdale lies a man-made feature that now separates the two 
parks by just six lanes of tarmac – the M6. To the west of it, the additions to 
the Lakes are small, but significant.

First, planners have added the lovely Whinfell and another Borrowdale – not to 
be mistaken for the Borrowdale over by Keswick. For a long time this dale has 
been largely overlooked, but a classic nine-mile walk covers Whinfell Ridge and 
Borrowdale.

It starts in the layby near Huck’s Bridge on the A6, heads east along the 
ridge that starts with Ashstead Fell, then Mabbin Crag, Castle Fell and 
Whinfell Beacon, before dropping down via the repeater station into Borrowdale 
and returning through the valley bottom. A slightly longer route starts near 
the M6.

 Ashstead Farmhouse 
Lake District south-east extension

It may be the smallest of the new additions, but this area packs in some real 
interest, including the National Trust-ownedSizergh Castle 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sizergh?campid_Social_Twitter_Organ>. Local 
walkers have long known about Scout Scar, a route rarely tackled by outsiders 
except Wainwright aficionados. There is a superb quick climb up to a limestone 
escarpment, then fine views of the southern fells. On top is the “mushroom”, a 
toposcope, or orientation table, that offers a bit of shelter, too. At the 
northern end, the path carries on to Cunswick Scar, then loops back west down 
the Lyth valley, finishing at theWheatsheaf Inn 
<http://thewheatsheafbrigsteer.co.uk/wheatsheaf/> in Brigsteer (which always 
has four real ales on tap). An alternative is to drop down to the east into 
Kendal, and there’s also a shorter, pushchair-friendly version.

The place to stay is Lumley Fee Bunkhouse 
<http://lumleyfeebunkhouse.co.uk/lumley/> (four-bed room £55, luxury room 
£120). Forget spartan huts and stoical indifference to suffering; here the 
rooms are gorgeously comfortable, especially after a big day out on the fells. 
Each has two bunks and an en suite with a bath and shower. There is a communal 
living area with a swanky Hogwartian style about it – it’s in a former 
classroom – plus a small well-equipped self-catering kitchen. Sizergh Castle is 
a short walk away.

Getting there


For the Lake District trains run from north and south to Kendal via Oxenholme. 
For the Dales, trains run from Carlisle or Leeds to Kirkby Stephen. This is the
Settle to Carlisle line <http://www.settle-carlisle.co.uk/>, a wonderful way to 
see the new area of the Dales. For bus services in the Yorkshire Dales see 
dalesbus.org <http://www.dalesbus.org/>, and for the Lake District golakes.co.uk
