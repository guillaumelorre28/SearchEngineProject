David Warner beats New Zealand by nine runs

And Australia wins by 117, if you must know. The run chase only reinforces 
what an innings that was from Warner, who timed his run well, kept his 
patience, and didn’t try to hit his way out of trouble until it was time to 
attack at the back end of the afternoon. He held things together, with some 
laboured but stubborn support from George Bailey and Travis Head especially.

New Zealand looked well in the hunt early, with Tom Latham timing them well 
and Martin Guptill hanging about. But Latham gave up a soft dismissal, Kane 
Williamson missed a straight one, and Guptill gave up his wicket in lamentable 
fashion. With the top three gone, the rest were always likely to struggle.

David Warner rescues Australia with another ton in win over New Zealand

A disheartening visit for New Zealand, but at least they kept it short. And 
they’re always more formidable on home shores, where they’ll take on Australia 
in three return ODIs at the end of January. You’d better believe I’ll be there 
to bring you those.

That’s it from the Australian OBO crew until the Brisbane Test against 
Pakistan gets underway next Thursday afternoon. Until then, Geoff Lemon out - 
thanks for your company, and we’ll see you soon.

WICKET! Boult c Smith b Cummins 1

Whooooooaaaaaa Nelly. That is it. But what a way to end it. Cummins returned 
for a new spell, Boult tried to glide him to third man, thought he’d got enough 
of it, but Smith at second slip took another blinder. Launched to his right, 
airborne, one hand, and plucked the catch from absolutely nowhere. Magnifique.

36th over: New Zealand 147-9 (Ferguson 4, Boult 1)


Boult off the mark! With a stylish whip to midwicket. Don’t mind if I do. 
Ferguson got faulkner away to fine leg as well. Definitely his zone.

Here’s a stat. Mitch Starc has 59 of his 116 ODI wickets either bowled or lbw. 
That makes 50.8%.

35th over: New Zealand 145-9 (Ferguson 3, Boult 0)


Well, they manage to survive Mitchell Starc. He gets 3-34 from his 10 overs. A 
single glanced by Ferguson is the only score from the last, as Boult blocks out 
the last three balls with his own usual unique style of defensive play.

hymns_loves_puppers (@analoguejaq) 
@GeoffLemonSport <https://twitter.com/GeoffLemonSport> serious thoughts on why 
khawaja isn't in the odi team? is it just this relatively low stakes series?
 <https://twitter.com/analoguejaq/status/807127187023237121> December 9, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/analoguejaq/status/807127187023237121> 
I think, Jaq, that he got left out in Sri Lanka after struggling over there, 
and other players did better like Bailey, Head and Finch. So they got 
incumbency for this series. Australia has some good batting options for the ODI 
team (viz Maxwell not getting a game), and also Khawaja offers nothing with 
bowling or fielding, which is a handicap in this format.

34th over: New Zealand 144-9 (Ferguson 2, Boult 0)

To be fair, even the batsmen were struggling to time it off this pitch. 
Southee bludgeoned a pull shot that barely got past the bowler. Ferguson fended 
a short ball away as awkwardly as can be, stole a single to square. Then 
Southee tried to swing one over cover that only went lamely up and down for a 
catch in the circle. But a bit of style comes along to close the over, as 
Ferguson uppercuts smoothly down to third man for a single.

33rd over: New Zealand 141-8 (Southee 3, Ferguson 0)

Smith really wants to get out of here. Starc hits Ferguson on the wristband of 
the glove, which then flies away to slip where Smith holds the catch. But the 
batsman’s hand was well off the glove at the time, so he’s spared on the DRS 
video. I have absolutely no idea how he just survived an over from Starc. 
Backed away just about every ball, poked hopelessly at most of them. How does 
the best bowler in the world at hitting the stumps just decide to stop hitting 
the stumps for an over? Maiden, any rate.

32nd over: New Zealand 141-8 (Southee 3, Ferguson 0)

Ahahahahahaha. Oh, my. Six balls in that Faulkner over, four of them Tim 
Southee charged. One of them he scored off, the last of the over, which he 
slogged mightily over midwicket for the princely sum of two runs. A Southee 
innings: full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

WICKET! Santner lbw Starc 15

31st over: New Zealand 139-8 (Southee 1)


Well, this over is eventful. Southee nicks a single. Starc is still trying to 
close this match out. Santner gets a full ball and flicks it beautifully away 
over midwicket for four. Next ball he backs away to make room, Starc follows 
him with a shorter bal, and it flies off the outside edge and over the bails 
for four more. Less beautiful. Next ball, for a second you think he has four 
more, as the ball flies away through fine third man. Then you realise that it 
has ricocheted there off the pad, before which is truck him right in front of 
his stumps, and he’s leg before wicket. Last rites, time for a Southee swing.

30th over: New Zealand 130-7 (Santner 7, Southee 0)

Santner, studious, watches Faulkner’s first three deliveries, then gets one 
nice and straight and guides it downthrough fine leg for four. Nice bit of 
timing. Still 135 runs short with the three wickets in hand.

29th over: New Zealand 126-7 (Santner 3, Southee 0)

Starc likes his chances of finishing off Southee, but at first the edge falls 
short of Wade, and the next three full balls are kept out by an unusually 
studious New Zealand lower-order batsman.


Chris Rogers on ABC radio has his eyes peeled. “That’s Glenn Maxwell at square 
leg. After that last ball, he’s just gone up to Tim Southee and had a bit of a 
conversation. Maxi’s bored! I don’t think it was anything nasty, I think he was 
just having a joke.”

WICKET! Munro b Starc 20

Nope. Scrap that. No building. Just demolition. It helps when you can call on 
Mitchell Starc as a captain. Munro flicks the first ball away to midwicket and 
gets a couple, as it was heading down leg. That must have made him think he was 
seeing them better than he was, because he has a lavish whoosh across the line 
at the next ball too. Only problem is the next ball is a far better yorker, on 
a slightly straighter line, and it demolishes leg stump. Poor shot, good 
bowling.

28th over: New Zealand 124-6 (Munro 18, Santner 3)


Smashed down the ground for four! Munro has had enough of Head, so he makes 
room and batters a flighted ball dead straight and high for four. Head drops 
short for the rest of the over, and the batsmen are able to take three singles 
through cover and point, shifting back to give themselves room to force the 
ball away. Sensible stuff. Just need to keep building like this.

27th over: New Zealand 117-6 (Munro 12, Santner 2)


Munro’s timing them alright, he just can’t beat the field. He’s gettinga bit 
annoyed. Two singles from Hazlewood’s over. What a disappointing slide after 
that good start. Maybe we could red-card New Zealand’s batsmen after their 
performances this series. Here’s anentertaining take on the new red-card 
<http://www.theroar.com.au/2016/12/09/red-cards-harbinger-cricketing-apocalypse/>
 law from Ben Pobjie, if you have a minute.

26th over: New Zealand 115-6 (Munro 11, Santner 1)

Munro unsure about how to approach Head now. Bashes a single downt he ground. 
Santner runs one smoothly towards point. Really can’t afford to be giving 
Travis Head two-run overs though.

25th over: New Zealand 113-6 (Munro 10, Santner 0)

Santner to the crease, a cool customer with the bat as he’s shown in some 
excellent innings in his young career, but this is a big ask in front of him 
today. Not impossible, given Munro’s striking power, but this pair are really 
the last genuine hope that New Zealand have. They would need to add the best 
part of the next hundred runs.

WICKET! de Grandhomme c Head b Hazlewood 11

Head gets his own back, as Hazlewood bangs in short, de Grandhomme bangs away 
with the pull shot, and Head bangs into the ground as he runs in from deep 
square leg. The umpires check the replay to make sur the ball didn’t slip 
through his fingers and touch grass, but they decide the’re happy with the way 
things look, and the batsman is on his way.

24th over: New Zealand 113-5 (Munro 10, de Grandhomme 11)

That’s one way to approach it! Colin de Grandhomme take a de grand step down 
the pitch and launches a de grand shot over the de grand sightscreen. He sent 
that ball all the way de grand home. A few singles and Head’s over goes for 10.

23rd over: New Zealand 103-5 (Munro 8, de Grandhomme 3)


Hazlewood returns, and is immediately into his own form of tidiness. A couple 
of singles to Munro, one to de Grandhomme. So hard for a batting side to know 
how to approach a chase from situations like this.

22nd over: New Zealand 100-5 (Munro 6, de Grandhomme 2)

You so often see it with batsmen facing part-time spinners. They want so 
desperately to get on with things. In this case Watling tried to smack Head 
away three different times, then nailed a sweep shot for four and felt quite 
good about it, then tried to repeat the does and got himself out. The large 
frame of de Grandhomme comes out next and immediately takes a couple of runs to 
fine leg.

WICKET! Watling lbw Head 4

What a day this is becoming for Travis Head. Watling tried to sweep, missed, 
was hit while kneeling. Umpire LlllllllLlllllong I think drew the conclusion 
that the ball had pitched outside leg. Smith came straight up to head and asked 
i f he thought the ball was going straight on. Head said it was, and Smith 
referred. Wants to close this match out as early as possible. The review had no 
Hot Spot available, but Snicko showed no edge, and the tracker showed three red 
lights superimposed over the batsman. If he had a bike, he’d be on it. Would 
make the walk shorter, too. The MCG is so big.

Another absurdly tight over from Starc. One leg bye and one single. He’s 
bowled six overs for 22 runs today.

20th over: New Zealand 92-4 (Munro 6, Watling 3)

That’s more like it, New Zealand. Head bowling, and they work a single from 
every ball of his over. No muss, no fuss, and if they just did that from ehre 
on in, they would win quite comfortably.


I can’t believe I missed this moment.

19th over: New Zealand 86-4 (Munro 3, Watling 0)

Mixed bag of an over from Starc. A couple of slower balls, another attempt at 
the yorker, a couple that beat Munro. He utterly creams one drive, but Head at 
cover makes a miracle save. It ends up being a maiden.

It’s a great time for Travis Head to be bowling, with the opposition having to 
defend so hard. Two singles and a leg bye are all that results from the over.

Everything Sniffer Smith touches is turning to Aussie canary gold (and don’t 
you forget it). He brings back Mitch Starc, going for the kill.

Reminds me of a joke. What do you do if you get attacked by a bunch of clowns?

Go straight for the juggler.

Starc certainly sent one of the bails up in the air. He’d tied Nicholls down 
all through the over. Five dot balls. Then the last delivery he pitches right 
up, swings it late, into the left-hander’s pads, and it beats his shot entirely 
to take out leg stump. Wicket maiden.

16th over: New Zealand 83-3 (Nicholls 3, Munro 1)

Out comes Colin Munro, shipping the filthiest handlebar moustache you’ve ever 
seen. He played some wonderfully inventive innings in the World T20, but hasn’t 
quite gelled at ODI level. Gets off the mark with a single to cover, then 
Nicholls cuts two and pushes one. Brilliant bowling change, four from Head’s 
first over. he’ll bowl plenty more tonight!

WICKET! Guptill c Bailey b Head 34

That is some prescient shizz. Faulkner has a wicket with his last delivery, 
but Steve Smith drags him from the attack and asks Travis head to bowl. 
Commentators question why, Head sends down one ball, Guptill tries to munt it 
to the cover boundary but ends up lifting the shot and this time the catcher is 
in just the spot to leap up and reel it in. Shocking, shocking decision by the 
only remaining senior batsman on the night.

15th over: New Zealand 79-2 (Guptill 34, Nicholls 0)

Williamson gone last ball of Faulkner’s over, and Guptill nearly follows from 
the first ball of Cummins’. Leans back for the cut shot, can’t keep it down, 
and Smith only just misses it at gully. Gets a single through square, and 
Nicholls sees out the rest of the over.

WICKET! Williamson lbw Faulkner 13

14th over: New Zealand 74-2 (Guptill 29)

The DRS can’t save Williamson - referred as much because of his importance to 
the team’s effort in this run chase as much as any true belief that it would be 
overturned. Massive breakthrough for Faulkner, who was man of the match against 
this team on this ground in the World Cup final of 2015. This ball is pitching 
well outside off stump, angling in, and Williamson tried to turn it to leg but 
was beaten for pace, struck high on the paid but the ball was dying off the 
pitch and would have struck high up his leg stump.

13th over: New Zealand 71-1 (Guptill 27, Williamson 12)


They’re getting enough deliveries to put away too. Williamson glides a single 
to third, Guptill glances four to fine. Then two more runs in the former 
method, one more run in the latter. The run rate’s a very healthy five and a 
half. The partnership is now worth 27.


A lot going on in Australian cricket right now: this series, Glenn Maxwell, 
the Women’s Big Bash starting tomorrow. If you want more in-depth conversation 
on that than I can type, fellow OBO type Adam Collins and I do a weekly podcast

12th over: New Zealand 63-1 (Guptill 20, Williamson 11)


They’re working the angles, this pair. Faulkner bowls straight and gets picked 
off for a pair of singles to leg, then gives more width and is picked off 
through cover for a single by Guptill, then a square-driven boundary by 
Williamson. The captain follows up with a sharp single after a defensive prod 
to end the over.

11th over: New Zealand 55-1 (Guptill 18, Williamson 5)

Williamson just waiting for the kinds of delivery that suit his purpose. Gets 
one that he likes from Cummins, and drives the straighter ball through long-on 
for four. Then he runs a single to third man, and Guptill thinks that’s such a 
good idea that he does likewise.

10th over: New Zealand 48-1 (Guptill 17, Williamson 0)

James Faulkner is on early in the day as well, as the Mexican Wave starts up 
among the now better-attended lower deck. (“We are gonna build a wave, a 
tremendous wave, you better believe it folks, and we’re gonna make Mexico pay 
for it.”) Kane Williamson is in the middle, and they’ll need all of his timing 
today, on this pitch that is just holding up a bit and making that part of the 
game difficult. KW isn’t on sttike this over though, as Guptill absorbs 
Faulkner including glancing him fine for four.

WICKET! Latham c Faulkner b Cummins 28

9th over: New Zealand 44-1 (Guptill 13)

Well, we saw Australia’s first two wickets fall to catches at square leg, and 
now Latham has given it up in the same way. Length ball from Cummins, and 
Latham just didn’t get quite far enough forward to it. Stayed back, worked it 
square but let it get quite big on him, so it lobbed in the air, Simple take, 
he played it blind rather than thinking about where his field was and where his 
gaps might be.

8th over: New Zealand 42-0 (Guptill 12, Latham 27)

Good battle here between Latham and Hazlewood. Guptill gets three runs to 
start the over, pulling the ball down the ground, after which Latham is moving 
around the crease, trying to drive square, then to pull, and eventually has to 
settle for dinking a single to leg.

7th over: New Zealand 38-0 (Guptill 9, Latham 26)

Comeback kid Patrick Cummins(back) gets the ball early for his first go, and 
settles into a rhythm pretty easily. A single to Latham, a brace and a single 
to Guptill, all deflected away on the on-side.

While we watch a couple of the world’s privileged teams go round, spare a 
thought for this lot.

The Netherlands cricket team has played 3 matches in 9 months.
I reckon I've got another 20 years in me at this rate.

6th over: New Zealand 34-0 (Guptill 6, Latham 25)

They’re working the opening bowlers well, ticking along at more than five per 
over. Promising signs for the Kiwis. Latham eases a couple more to third man, 
flicks the run to midwicket, then Guptill faces Hazlewood for the first time 
today and pulls hissecond ball for a couple of runs into the expanse at long 
leg. Plenty of empty acres of grass out there, only two men in the deep for 
this early Powerplay.

5th over: New Zealand 29-0 (Guptill 4, Latham 22)


Gorgeous shot. Guptill on the back foot, leans back a little, opens the blade 
and so neatly punches the ball through point. Three runs as it pulls up short 
of the long, long, long boundary down towards Punt Road. If there’s any place 
in Melbourne that deserves the appellation long, long, long, it’s goddamn Punt 
Road.

Latham hoicks Starc across the line over midwicket, scoring a couple, then 
cover drives a boundary and glides a single. Update that assessment, he’s in 
exquisite touch.

4th over: New Zealand 19-0 (Guptill 1, Latham 15)

Four! What a shot from Latham on the straight drive. Chris Rogers, a fellow 
opening batsman, analyses it thus on ABC radio: that because Hazlewood had such 
a good line across the left-hander, Latham cut down that angle by walking 
forward out of his crease for that shot. That put the ball in a comfortable 
zone for him, and he was able to send it neatly down the ground. Then he gets a 
straighter ball thanks to the correction, and works it through midwicket for a 
couple, and later draws a wide down leg. He’s started beautifully, has Latham.

3rd over: New Zealand 12-0 (Guptill 1, Latham 9)

Whoops, there goes Starc’s radar again. When he tries to swing balls into the 
pads, he often sends them merrily down the leg side instead. That’s what 
happens twice in this over, before he gets one on the correct side of the 
wicket and Latham drives it cleanly, hard into the ground, and sees it fly 
through a packed cover field on the bounce for four. Then a flick to midwicket.

2nd over: New Zealand 5-0 (Guptill 1, Latham 4)

Here’s a turn-up - Hazlewood has started out looking even more dangerous than 
Starc. He’s moving the ball through the air as well, and moving it a bit off 
the seam, and using the angle across to make the left-handed Latham 
uncomfortable. All that Tom can do is glide a single from the final ball of a 
testing early over.

Here we go then. Mitchell Starc is immediately tailing the ball into the 
right-hander. Guptill jams one out for a single, Latham times one beuatifully 
through midwicket for three.

New Zealand will chase 265 to win

Phew, that’s better. Not so bad as being told the target is Three Hundred and 
Infinity Lots. It still won’t be easy - this pitch has looked tricky to time 
shots on, and everyone struggled to some degree today except Warner. Even he 
had a fair few lucky moments when his big shots evaded the field, not to 
mention a couple of edges past the stumps. But if the New Zealand batsmen can 
keep their heads and build an innings, they should be able to threaten. Or it 
might be a night for Australia’s bowlers to earn their keep, rather than 
trundle down foregone-conclusion pies to be swallowed in the outfield.

You’ll be back for the second innings in about half an hour with... me, Geoff 
Lemon, because I was a bad person in a former life and this is the reprisal the 
universe has settled on. Not so bad, it could have been eating all the 
doughnuts in the world.

WICKET! Warner run out Boult 156

50th over: Australia 264-8 (Starc 0)

A majestic hand comes to an end from the last ball of the innings. First 
Warner hits his last couple of runs through point, then he drives a ball 
straight back to Boult, then the last ball he chips off a leading edge into the 
on-side, and lost sight of it. Instinct kicked in, and for a second he 
hesitated, wondering where it had gone, when the last ball of the innings meant 
he should have just been head down and sprinting. If he’d gone straight away, 
he would have made it, but the stutter gave Boult time to hare off after the 
ball, grab it in one hand, then spin around from about short cover and hurl 
down the non-striker’s stumps. Brilliant, fun, ridiculous stuff, exactly the 
kind of of thing that one-day cricket should be about, precisely because it 
doesn’t really matter. David Warner has played a gem for us here today.

close  
And Australia wins by 117, if you must know. The run chase only reinforces 
what an innings that was from Warner, who timed his run well, kept his 
patience, and didn’t try to hit his way out of trouble until it was time to 
attack at the back end of the afternoon. He held things together, with some 
laboured but stubborn support from George Bailey and Travis Head especially.

New Zealand looked well in the hunt early, with Tom Latham timing them well 
and Martin Guptill hanging about. But Latham gave up a soft dismissal, Kane 
Williamson missed a straight one, and Guptill gave up his wicket in lamentable 
fashion. With the top three gone, the rest were always likely to struggle.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/09/david-warner-rescues-australia-with-another-ton-in-win-over-new-zealand>
A disheartening visit for New Zealand, but at least they kept it short. And 
they’re always more formidable on home shores, where they’ll take on Australia 
in three return ODIs at the end of January. You’d better believe I’ll be there 
to bring you those.

That’s it from the Australian OBO crew until the Brisbane Test against 
Pakistan gets underway next Thursday afternoon. Until then, Geoff Lemon out - 
thanks for your company, and we’ll see you soon.

 
Whooooooaaaaaa Nelly. That is it. But what a way to end it. Cummins returned 
for a new spell, Boult tried to glide him to third man, thought he’d got enough 
of it, but Smith at second slip took another blinder. Launched to his right, 
airborne, one hand, and plucked the catch from absolutely nowhere. Magnifique.

 
36th over: New Zealand 147-9 (Ferguson 4, Boult 1)


Boult off the mark! With a stylish whip to midwicket. Don’t mind if I do. 
Ferguson got faulkner away to fine leg as well. Definitely his zone.

Here’s a stat. Mitch Starc has 59 of his 116 ODI wickets either bowled or lbw. 
That makes 50.8%.


 
35th over: New Zealand 145-9 (Ferguson 3, Boult 0)


Well, they manage to survive Mitchell Starc. He gets 3-34 from his 10 overs. A 
single glanced by Ferguson is the only score from the last, as Boult blocks out 
the last three balls with his own usual unique style of defensive play.

hymns_loves_puppers (@analoguejaq) 
@GeoffLemonSport <https://twitter.com/GeoffLemonSport> serious thoughts on why 
khawaja isn't in the odi team? is it just this relatively low stakes series?
 <https://twitter.com/analoguejaq/status/807127187023237121> December 9, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/analoguejaq/status/807127187023237121> 
I think, Jaq, that he got left out in Sri Lanka after struggling over there, 
and other players did better like Bailey, Head and Finch. So they got 
incumbency for this series. Australia has some good batting options for the ODI 
team (viz Maxwell not getting a game), and also Khawaja offers nothing with 
bowling or fielding, which is a handicap in this format.


 
34th over: New Zealand 144-9 (Ferguson 2, Boult 0)

To be fair, even the batsmen were struggling to time it off this pitch. 
Southee bludgeoned a pull shot that barely got past the bowler. Ferguson fended 
a short ball away as awkwardly as can be, stole a single to square. Then 
Southee tried to swing one over cover that only went lamely up and down for a 
catch in the circle. But a bit of style comes along to close the over, as 
Ferguson uppercuts smoothly down to third man for a single.

 
Out, out brief candle.


 
33rd over: New Zealand 141-8 (Southee 3, Ferguson 0)

Smith really wants to get out of here. Starc hits Ferguson on the wristband of 
the glove, which then flies away to slip where Smith holds the catch. But the 
batsman’s hand was well off the glove at the time, so he’s spared on the DRS 
video. I have absolutely no idea how he just survived an over from Starc. 
Backed away just about every ball, poked hopelessly at most of them. How does 
the best bowler in the world at hitting the stumps just decide to stop hitting 
the stumps for an over? Maiden, any rate.

 
32nd over: New Zealand 141-8 (Southee 3, Ferguson 0)

Ahahahahahaha. Oh, my. Six balls in that Faulkner over, four of them Tim 
Southee charged. One of them he scored off, the last of the over, which he 
slogged mightily over midwicket for the princely sum of two runs. A Southee 
innings: full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

 
31st over: New Zealand 139-8 (Southee 1)


Well, this over is eventful. Southee nicks a single. Starc is still trying to 
close this match out. Santner gets a full ball and flicks it beautifully away 
over midwicket for four. Next ball he backs away to make room, Starc follows 
him with a shorter bal, and it flies off the outside edge and over the bails 
for four more. Less beautiful. Next ball, for a second you think he has four 
more, as the ball flies away through fine third man. Then you realise that it 
has ricocheted there off the pad, before which is truck him right in front of 
his stumps, and he’s leg before wicket. Last rites, time for a Southee swing.


 
30th over: New Zealand 130-7 (Santner 7, Southee 0)

Santner, studious, watches Faulkner’s first three deliveries, then gets one 
nice and straight and guides it downthrough fine leg for four. Nice bit of 
timing. Still 135 runs short with the three wickets in hand.

 
29th over: New Zealand 126-7 (Santner 3, Southee 0)

Starc likes his chances of finishing off Southee, but at first the edge falls 
short of Wade, and the next three full balls are kept out by an unusually 
studious New Zealand lower-order batsman.


Chris Rogers on ABC radio has his eyes peeled. “That’s Glenn Maxwell at square 
leg. After that last ball, he’s just gone up to Tim Southee and had a bit of a 
conversation. Maxi’s bored! I don’t think it was anything nasty, I think he was 
just having a joke.”

 
Nope. Scrap that. No building. Just demolition. It helps when you can call on 
Mitchell Starc as a captain. Munro flicks the first ball away to midwicket and 
gets a couple, as it was heading down leg. That must have made him think he was 
seeing them better than he was, because he has a lavish whoosh across the line 
at the next ball too. Only problem is the next ball is a far better yorker, on 
a slightly straighter line, and it demolishes leg stump. Poor shot, good 
bowling.

 
28th over: New Zealand 124-6 (Munro 18, Santner 3)


Smashed down the ground for four! Munro has had enough of Head, so he makes 
room and batters a flighted ball dead straight and high for four. Head drops 
short for the rest of the over, and the batsmen are able to take three singles 
through cover and point, shifting back to give themselves room to force the 
ball away. Sensible stuff. Just need to keep building like this.


 
27th over: New Zealand 117-6 (Munro 12, Santner 2)


Munro’s timing them alright, he just can’t beat the field. He’s gettinga bit 
annoyed. Two singles from Hazlewood’s over. What a disappointing slide after 
that good start. Maybe we could red-card New Zealand’s batsmen after their 
performances this series. Here’s anentertaining take on the new red-card 
<http://www.theroar.com.au/2016/12/09/red-cards-harbinger-cricketing-apocalypse/>
 law from Ben Pobjie, if you have a minute.


 
26th over: New Zealand 115-6 (Munro 11, Santner 1)

Munro unsure about how to approach Head now. Bashes a single downt he ground. 
Santner runs one smoothly towards point. Really can’t afford to be giving 
Travis Head two-run overs though.

 
25th over: New Zealand 113-6 (Munro 10, Santner 0)

Santner to the crease, a cool customer with the bat as he’s shown in some 
excellent innings in his young career, but this is a big ask in front of him 
today. Not impossible, given Munro’s striking power, but this pair are really 
the last genuine hope that New Zealand have. They would need to add the best 
part of the next hundred runs.

 
Head gets his own back, as Hazlewood bangs in short, de Grandhomme bangs away 
with the pull shot, and Head bangs into the ground as he runs in from deep 
square leg. The umpires check the replay to make sur the ball didn’t slip 
through his fingers and touch grass, but they decide the’re happy with the way 
things look, and the batsman is on his way.

 
24th over: New Zealand 113-5 (Munro 10, de Grandhomme 11)

That’s one way to approach it! Colin de Grandhomme take a de grand step down 
the pitch and launches a de grand shot over the de grand sightscreen. He sent 
that ball all the way de grand home. A few singles and Head’s over goes for 10.

 
23rd over: New Zealand 103-5 (Munro 8, de Grandhomme 3)


Hazlewood returns, and is immediately into his own form of tidiness. A couple 
of singles to Munro, one to de Grandhomme. So hard for a batting side to know 
how to approach a chase from situations like this.





 
22nd over: New Zealand 100-5 (Munro 6, de Grandhomme 2)

You so often see it with batsmen facing part-time spinners. They want so 
desperately to get on with things. In this case Watling tried to smack Head 
away three different times, then nailed a sweep shot for four and felt quite 
good about it, then tried to repeat the does and got himself out. The large 
frame of de Grandhomme comes out next and immediately takes a couple of runs to 
fine leg.




 
What a day this is becoming for Travis Head. Watling tried to sweep, missed, 
was hit while kneeling. Umpire LlllllllLlllllong I think drew the conclusion 
that the ball had pitched outside leg. Smith came straight up to head and asked 
i f he thought the ball was going straight on. Head said it was, and Smith 
referred. Wants to close this match out as early as possible. The review had no 
Hot Spot available, but Snicko showed no edge, and the tracker showed three red 
lights superimposed over the batsman. If he had a bike, he’d be on it. Would 
make the walk shorter, too. The MCG is so big.

 
21st over: New Zealand 94-4 (Munro 6, Watling 4)


Another absurdly tight over from Starc. One leg bye and one single. He’s 
bowled six overs for 22 runs today.


 
20th over: New Zealand 92-4 (Munro 6, Watling 3)

That’s more like it, New Zealand. Head bowling, and they work a single from 
every ball of his over. No muss, no fuss, and if they just did that from ehre 
on in, they would win quite comfortably.


I can’t believe I missed this moment.

19th over: New Zealand 86-4 (Munro 3, Watling 0)

Mixed bag of an over from Starc. A couple of slower balls, another attempt at 
the yorker, a couple that beat Munro. He utterly creams one drive, but Head at 
cover makes a miracle save. It ends up being a maiden.

 
18th over: New Zealand 86-4 (Munro 3, Watling 0)

It’s a great time for Travis Head to be bowling, with the opposition having to 
defend so hard. Two singles and a leg bye are all that results from the over.

 
17th over: New Zealand 83-4 (Munro 1)


Everything Sniffer Smith touches is turning to Aussie canary gold (and don’t 
you forget it). He brings back Mitch Starc, going for the kill.

Reminds me of a joke. What do you do if you get attacked by a bunch of clowns?

Go straight for the juggler.

Starc certainly sent one of the bails up in the air. He’d tied Nicholls down 
all through the over. Five dot balls. Then the last delivery he pitches right 
up, swings it late, into the left-hander’s pads, and it beats his shot entirely 
to take out leg stump. Wicket maiden.


 
16th over: New Zealand 83-3 (Nicholls 3, Munro 1)

Out comes Colin Munro, shipping the filthiest handlebar moustache you’ve ever 
seen. He played some wonderfully inventive innings in the World T20, but hasn’t 
quite gelled at ODI level. Gets off the mark with a single to cover, then 
Nicholls cuts two and pushes one. Brilliant bowling change, four from Head’s 
first over. he’ll bowl plenty more tonight!

 
That is some prescient shizz. Faulkner has a wicket with his last delivery, 
but Steve Smith drags him from the attack and asks Travis head to bowl. 
Commentators question why, Head sends down one ball, Guptill tries to munt it 
to the cover boundary but ends up lifting the shot and this time the catcher is 
in just the spot to leap up and reel it in. Shocking, shocking decision by the 
only remaining senior batsman on the night.

 
15th over: New Zealand 79-2 (Guptill 34, Nicholls 0)

Williamson gone last ball of Faulkner’s over, and Guptill nearly follows from 
the first ball of Cummins’. Leans back for the cut shot, can’t keep it down, 
and Smith only just misses it at gully. Gets a single through square, and 
Nicholls sees out the rest of the over.

 
14th over: New Zealand 74-2 (Guptill 29)

The DRS can’t save Williamson - referred as much because of his importance to 
the team’s effort in this run chase as much as any true belief that it would be 
overturned. Massive breakthrough for Faulkner, who was man of the match against 
this team on this ground in the World Cup final of 2015. This ball is pitching 
well outside off stump, angling in, and Williamson tried to turn it to leg but 
was beaten for pace, struck high on the paid but the ball was dying off the 
pitch and would have struck high up his leg stump.

 
13th over: New Zealand 71-1 (Guptill 27, Williamson 12)


They’re getting enough deliveries to put away too. Williamson glides a single 
to third, Guptill glances four to fine. Then two more runs in the former 
method, one more run in the latter. The run rate’s a very healthy five and a 
half. The partnership is now worth 27.


A lot going on in Australian cricket right now: this series, Glenn Maxwell, 
the Women’s Big Bash starting tomorrow. If you want more in-depth conversation 
on that than I can type, fellow OBO type Adam Collins and I do a weekly podcast 
called The Final Word, withthis week’s episode here 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-06/the-final-word:-december-6/8097006>.




 
12th over: New Zealand 63-1 (Guptill 20, Williamson 11)


They’re working the angles, this pair. Faulkner bowls straight and gets picked 
off for a pair of singles to leg, then gives more width and is picked off 
through cover for a single by Guptill, then a square-driven boundary by 
Williamson. The captain follows up with a sharp single after a defensive prod 
to end the over.


 
11th over: New Zealand 55-1 (Guptill 18, Williamson 5)

Williamson just waiting for the kinds of delivery that suit his purpose. Gets 
one that he likes from Cummins, and drives the straighter ball through long-on 
for four. Then he runs a single to third man, and Guptill thinks that’s such a 
good idea that he does likewise.

 
10th over: New Zealand 48-1 (Guptill 17, Williamson 0)

James Faulkner is on early in the day as well, as the Mexican Wave starts up 
among the now better-attended lower deck. (“We are gonna build a wave, a 
tremendous wave, you better believe it folks, and we’re gonna make Mexico pay 
for it.”) Kane Williamson is in the middle, and they’ll need all of his timing 
today, on this pitch that is just holding up a bit and making that part of the 
game difficult. KW isn’t on sttike this over though, as Guptill absorbs 
Faulkner including glancing him fine for four.

 
9th over: New Zealand 44-1 (Guptill 13)

Well, we saw Australia’s first two wickets fall to catches at square leg, and 
now Latham has given it up in the same way. Length ball from Cummins, and 
Latham just didn’t get quite far enough forward to it. Stayed back, worked it 
square but let it get quite big on him, so it lobbed in the air, Simple take, 
he played it blind rather than thinking about where his field was and where his 
gaps might be.

 
8th over: New Zealand 42-0 (Guptill 12, Latham 27)

Good battle here between Latham and Hazlewood. Guptill gets three runs to 
start the over, pulling the ball down the ground, after which Latham is moving 
around the crease, trying to drive square, then to pull, and eventually has to 
settle for dinking a single to leg.

 
7th over: New Zealand 38-0 (Guptill 9, Latham 26)

Comeback kid Patrick Cummins(back) gets the ball early for his first go, and 
settles into a rhythm pretty easily. A single to Latham, a brace and a single 
to Guptill, all deflected away on the on-side.

While we watch a couple of the world’s privileged teams go round, spare a 
thought for this lot.

<https://twitter.com/dutchiepdb/status/806961770342547457>  
6th over: New Zealand 34-0 (Guptill 6, Latham 25)

They’re working the opening bowlers well, ticking along at more than five per 
over. Promising signs for the Kiwis. Latham eases a couple more to third man, 
flicks the run to midwicket, then Guptill faces Hazlewood for the first time 
today and pulls hissecond ball for a couple of runs into the expanse at long 
leg. Plenty of empty acres of grass out there, only two men in the deep for 
this early Powerplay.

 
5th over: New Zealand 29-0 (Guptill 4, Latham 22)


Gorgeous shot. Guptill on the back foot, leans back a little, opens the blade 
and so neatly punches the ball through point. Three runs as it pulls up short 
of the long, long, long boundary down towards Punt Road. If there’s any place 
in Melbourne that deserves the appellation long, long, long, it’s goddamn Punt 
Road.

Latham hoicks Starc across the line over midwicket, scoring a couple, then 
cover drives a boundary and glides a single. Update that assessment, he’s in 
exquisite touch.


 
4th over: New Zealand 19-0 (Guptill 1, Latham 15)

Four! What a shot from Latham on the straight drive. Chris Rogers, a fellow 
opening batsman, analyses it thus on ABC radio: that because Hazlewood had such 
a good line across the left-hander, Latham cut down that angle by walking 
forward out of his crease for that shot. That put the ball in a comfortable 
zone for him, and he was able to send it neatly down the ground. Then he gets a 
straighter ball thanks to the correction, and works it through midwicket for a 
couple, and later draws a wide down leg. He’s started beautifully, has Latham.

 
3rd over: New Zealand 12-0 (Guptill 1, Latham 9)

Whoops, there goes Starc’s radar again. When he tries to swing balls into the 
pads, he often sends them merrily down the leg side instead. That’s what 
happens twice in this over, before he gets one on the correct side of the 
wicket and Latham drives it cleanly, hard into the ground, and sees it fly 
through a packed cover field on the bounce for four. Then a flick to midwicket.

 
2nd over: New Zealand 5-0 (Guptill 1, Latham 4)

Here’s a turn-up - Hazlewood has started out looking even more dangerous than 
Starc. He’s moving the ball through the air as well, and moving it a bit off 
the seam, and using the angle across to make the left-handed Latham 
uncomfortable. All that Tom can do is glide a single from the final ball of a 
testing early over.

 
1st over: New Zealand 4-0 (Guptill 1, Latham 3)

Here we go then. Mitchell Starc is immediately tailing the ball into the 
right-hander. Guptill jams one out for a single, Latham times one beuatifully 
through midwicket for three.

 
Phew, that’s better. Not so bad as being told the target is Three Hundred and 
Infinity Lots. It still won’t be easy - this pitch has looked tricky to time 
shots on, and everyone struggled to some degree today except Warner. Even he 
had a fair few lucky moments when his big shots evaded the field, not to 
mention a couple of edges past the stumps. But if the New Zealand batsmen can 
keep their heads and build an innings, they should be able to threaten. Or it 
might be a night for Australia’s bowlers to earn their keep, rather than 
trundle down foregone-conclusion pies to be swallowed in the outfield.

You’ll be back for the second innings in about half an hour with... me, Geoff 
Lemon, because I was a bad person in a former life and this is the reprisal the 
universe has settled on. Not so bad, it could have been eating all the 
doughnuts in the world.

 
50th over: Australia 264-8 (Starc 0)

A majestic hand comes to an end from the last ball of the innings. First 
Warner hits his last couple of runs through point, then he drives a ball 
straight back to Boult, then the last ball he chips off a leading edge into the 
on-side, and lost sight of it. Instinct kicked in, and for a second he 
hesitated, wondering where it had gone, when the last ball of the innings meant 
he should have just been head down and sprinting. If he’d gone straight away, 
he would have made it, but the stutter gave Boult time to hare off after the 
ball, grab it in one hand, then spin around from about short cover and hurl 
down the non-striker’s stumps. Brilliant, fun, ridiculous stuff, exactly the 
kind of of thing that one-day cricket should be about, precisely because it 
doesn’t really matter. David Warner has played a gem for us here today.
