2016 taught us that very little is predictable. But there are a few people 
worth watching next year, in the likely chance that they’ll have a major role 
in shaping 2017. Here are the people to keep your eye on, in politics, the 
arts, media, and sports.

 Keith Ellison is hoping to chair the Democratic National Committee. 
Photograph: Richard Tsong-Taatarii/AP 
Ellison is one of the new hopes for the Democratic party – or at least for its 
progressive wing. A former community organizer who serves as a congressman for 
Minnesota, Ellisonhas been backed by Bernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/keith-ellison-democratic-national-committee-chair-candidacy>
 and Elizabeth Warren to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee.

Although one of only two Muslims in Congress, Ellison has pledged to resign 
his seat in Congress if elected as DNC chair. As party chair he would attempt 
to hew the Democratic party to the left,focusing on grassroots organizing 
<https://keithfordnc.org/platform/> to “build the party from the bottom up”. 

He would work towards Sanders-esque proposals on taxing the wealthy and 
corporations, and on immigration reform, in the hope of tempting back 
Democratic voters in the 2018 mid-term elections.

The DNC will meet over the weekend of February 24-26 to vote for their choice. 
Ellison is not a shoo-in, however;other names mentioned 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/sally-boynton-brown-dnc-chair-232740> 
for the chair include Labor secretary Tom Perez, seen as a more moderate 
choice, and South Carolina Democratic party chairman Jaime Harrison.

The former executive chairman of unofficial Trump fan club Breitbart News will 
spend 2017 firmly embedded in the White House and is one of the few people who 
has the ear of the president-elect.

Bannon – who is currently being portrayed as the grim reaper on Saturday Night 
Live – will serve as Trump’s chief strategist and senior counselor, which is a 
made-up position but one likely to give him significant power.

During the presidential campaign Bannon was said to be the one advisor who 
could talk forcefully 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/14/us/politics/reince-priebus-chief-of-staff-donald-trump.html?_r=1&mtrref=www.nytimes.com>
 to Trump – a rare position and one that means he may be able to hold Trump to 
some of the right-wing, populist promises that won him the election.

 Megyn Kelly has reportedly been offered $20m a year to stay at Fox News. 
Photograph: Victoria Will/AP 
Trump’s antagoniser-in-chief ended 2016 by releasing a book, Settle for More, 
for which she waspaid up to $10m 
<http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/04/media/megyn-kelly-harpercollins-book-deal/>, 
and she is likely to have an even more lucrative 2017.

Her contract with Fox News expires in July, and she has reportedly been 
offered $20m a year 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4018188/Megyn-Kelly-meeting-ABC-NBC-considering-lower-paying-offers-leave-20m-job-Fox-News-staffers-nicknamed-again.html>
 to stay. Kelly is also apparently being pursued by ABC, NBC and CNN, although 
theymight not offer 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/could-a-last-minute-suitor-woo-megyn-kelly-away-from-fox-news>
 her quite as much money.

Fox News is one of the few broadcasters, newspapers and news websites that 
Donald Trump does not actively criticize, so the right-wing channel is likely 
to be his first port of call for interviews.

That means that Kelly – despite not being Trump’s favourite Fox News 
journalist (see:the Republican primary debates 
<http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/08/politics/donald-trump-cnn-megyn-kelly-comment/>) 
– would have a rare opportunity to hold the president to account. If she 
decides to stay.

touted

 as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2020.

Harris, whose mother is Indian American and father is Jamaican, is the first 
Indian woman and second black woman to be elected to the Senate.

She will serve on the homeland security and governmental affairs committee and 
the select committee on intelligence, which could provide important checks on 
Donald Trump.

Seen as a progressive, Harris was endorsed by the outgoing senator for 
California, Barbara Boxer, and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren in her 
Senate run.

She hasn’t commented on the presidential speculation. But Barack Obama was 
another Democrat who endorsed Harris in 2016 – and running for president as a 
first term senator seemed to work out for him.

The Dallas Cowboys <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dallas-cowboys> have 
only lost two games so far and have looked to be one of the better teams in the 
NFL all season.

They’ve been propelled towards that record by two rookies: the quarterback, 
Dak Prescott, and running back, Ezekiel Elliott.

Prescott, 23, was only the 135th pick in the draft, and few would have 
expected him to get much game time. But after the Cowboys’ veteran quarterback 
Tony Romo broke a vertebrae in pre-season Prescott became first choice, and 
promptlybroke Tom Brady’s record 
<http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/dak-prescott-breaks-tom-bradys-record-for-most-passes-without-a-pick-to-start-a-career/>
 for most consecutive passes thrown without an interception at the beginning of 
a career.

His performances throughout the season have left some NFL commentators 
wondering <http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=18358605> if he might be the best 
rookie quarterback of all time.

Meanwhile Elliot, 21, broke the Cowboys’ 39-year-old rookie record  
<http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2016/11/20/13691486/2016-nfl-football-ezekiel-elliott-best-rookie-cowboys-running-back-ever-rushing-record>
for rushing yards this season and has a chance tobecome the most successful 
rookie running back 
<http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000764796/article/jerry-jones-ezekiel-elliott-still-has-a-shot-at-dickerson>
 in NFL history.

If Prescott and Elliott can keep up their form in the playoffs then the 
Cowboys could win their first Super Bowl since 1995.

 Elaine Welteroth was the youngest Condé Nast editor-in-chief in history. 
Photograph: Lewis/Starpix/REX/Shutterstock 
This year was huge for Elaine Welteroth, who in May was appointed 
editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue at just 29. That made her the youngest Condé Nast 
editor-in-chief in history, and only the second African American to hold such a 
job.

Immediately, Welteroth, along with digital editorial director Phillip Pacardi, 
upped the magazine’s political and social issues coverage, focusing on the 
election, LGBT, race and feminist issues. Teen Vogue had more females of color 
as cover starsthan any other fashion magazine this year 
<http://fashionista.com/2016/12/fashion-diversity-magazine-covers-2016>. 

And Welteroth has been the face of it all, regularly appearing on panels, in 
interviews or even as herself on the show Black-ish. Over 77,000 peoplefollow 
her jet-setting life on Instagram 
<https://www.instagram.com/elainewelteroth/?hl=en>. 


After publishing around a dozen stories a day in 2015, her team now publishes 
50 to 70 daily. But Welteroth will face the challenges of a tough media 
business in 2017. Last month Condé Nast announced the magazine is getting cut 
back from a monthly to a quarterly, starting in Spring 2017, with a more 
collectible print edition and a digital focus.

Photograph: Pari Dukovic/HBO 
Actress, writer and producer Issa Rae created Insecure, one of 2016’s most 
praised TV shows. Insecure began airing on HBO in October, puttingblack women 
and black female friendships front and center 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/18/insecure-lets-black-women-watch-ourselves-on-tv-at-last-issa-rae>
, and mixing microaggressions from working in an all-white work place with 
conversational Drake lyrics.

The show has other big names on board: Larry Wilmore is an executive producer, 
Solange is a music consultant, Melina Matsoukas (director of Beyonce’s 
Formation) is a director and executive producer.


Rae, 31, first shot to fame as a YouTube star, with her 2011 web series 
Misadventures of an Awkward Black Girl <http://awkwardblackgirl.com/>. Her 
production company, which also includes ColorCreative.TV, offers opportunities 
specifically for women and minority writers.

In 2017, she’s up for a Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy, will be 
writing and shooting season two of Insecure, and will serve as executive 
producer on a new comedy show by her production company called Minimum Wage, 
the story of five employees at a fast food restaurant in LA’s Koreatown.
