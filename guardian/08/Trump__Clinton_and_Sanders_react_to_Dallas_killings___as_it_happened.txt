NYPD commissioner says Trump wanted 'photo op'

The New York Daily News reports 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn-woman-takes-death-leap-george-washington-bridge-article-1.2683053>
 that New York police commissioner Bill Bratton has rejected, strongly, a 
request by Donald Trump to address police officers at an afternoon meeting at 
the midtown north precinct:

“Our interest is staying out of the politics of the moment, and not to provide 
photo ops,” he told reporters. “If Mr. Trump wants to speak to me, I would be 
happy to brief him on what we’re doing. If Sen. Clinton wants to speak to me, I 
would very happy to brief her on what we’re doing. But we are not in the 
business of providing photo ops for our candidates.”

Justice Ginsburg: 'I don't want to think about' possibility of Trump presidency

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg says she doesn’t want to think about the 
possibility of Donald Trump winning theWhite House 
<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/white-house.htm>, and she predicts the 
next president — “whoever she will be” — will have a few appointments to make 
to the Supreme Court, the AP reports:

In an interview Thursday in her court office, the 83-year-old justice and 
leader of the court’s liberal wing said she presumes DemocratHillary Clinton 
<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/hillary-clinton.htm> will be the 
next president. Asked what if Republican Donald Trump won instead, she said, “I 
don’t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then 
everything is up for grabs.”

That includes the future of the high court itself, on which she is the oldest 
justice. Two justices, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer, are in their late 
70s.

“It’s likely that the next president, whoever she will be, will have a few 
appointments to make,” Ginsburg said, smiling.

Donald Trump has solicited donations from foreign members of foreign 
parliaments.Hillary Clinton’s campaign has gone looking for overseas cash, too 
– albeit from US citizens, who can legally contributed (and in what sounds like 
a much more organized way than the as-yet-unexplained Trump effort), according 
to a Washington Postreport 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/07/clinton-campaign-seeks-donations-from-americans-abroad-with-events-in-five-european-cities-thursday/?postshare=6681467986163484&tid=ss_tw>
:

Hillary Clinton’s campaign held fundraising events in five foreign cities 
Thursday, offering U.S. lawyers living overseas the chance to have a “virtual 
policy conversation” with Sen. Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia, one of Clinton’s 
potential running mates.

Thursday’s receptions — held simultaneously in Moscow, Paris, Rome, Warsaw and 
Zurich — served as the kickoff of a new Lawyers Abroad for Hillary program, 
part of an aggressive push by the putative Democratic presidential nominee to 
tap new constituencies for funds as she ramps up for the general election.

One of the greatest ironies of the 2016 presidential election is that it took 
a billionaire to turn the dominance of money in politics inside out,write the 
Guardian’sBen Jacobs and David Smith:

Many of Trump’s supporters say part of his appeal is that, as they see it, he 
is his own man and not a typical politician beholden to donors who give 
millions and expect policy favors in return.


The Trump phenomenon – and, for that matter, the rise of Bernie Sanders with 
his army of online fundraisers – have added intrigue to the perennial question 
of campaign finance and who pulls the strings of American democracy. But as the 
general election nears, there are signs of the old order reasserting itself. 
The distorting influence of money has not gone away.

Guardian readers have raised it as one of their main concerns. Christopher 
Kansas, a Sanders supporter in Colorado, thought campaign finance reform “is 
the most important issue that we currently have to deal with because without 
changing the way campaigns are financed the other important issues will never 
be completely discussed”. Jennifer Olsen, a Trump supporter from Missouri, felt 
“this country has the perception of a democracy ... but federal politics are 
corrupt”. In particular, several people like Julie Stevens, a Democrat from 
Minnesota, pointed to the effect of Citizens United.

This is a reference to a 2010 ruling by the supreme court that removed many 
existing limitations on outside groups spending money to influence elections. 
It enabled the creation Super Political Action Committees, orSuper Pacs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-pacs>, organizations independent of 
the candidates’ campaigns which, unlike the campaigns, may raise unlimited 
amounts of money from individual donors. There were prophecies that these 
faceless funders of attack ads would seize control of American democracy.

Six years later, has this come to pass? Some believe so. Sanders tweeted 
earlier this year: “One of the most disastrous Supreme Court decisions in my 
lifetime. In essence, this ruling handed millionaires and billionaires – who 
have already rigged our economy – unlimited influence in our elections.”

State department reopens inquiry into Clinton emails

The state department is reopening an internal investigation of possible 
mishandling of classified information byHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and top aides, AP reports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/hillary-clinton-state-department-reopens-investigation-email>
:

Spokesman John Kirby says the emails probe is restarting now that the 
Department of Justice isn’t pursuing a criminal prosecution. The Department of 
State suspended its review in April to avoid interfering withthe FBI’s inquiry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton-email-investigation-no-charges-loretta-lynch>
.

Kirby set no deadline for the investigation’s completion.

Clinton was secretary of state until early 2013. Most of her top advisers left 
shortly thereafter.

But Kirby said this week former officials can still face “administrative 
sanctions”. The most serious is loss of security clearances, which could 
complicate Clinton’s naming of a national security team if she becomes 
president.

Beyond the Democratic frontrunner, the probe is most likely examining 
confidants Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan and Huma Abedin.

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell calls the Dallas attack 
“unconscionable”. Here’s his full statement:

What we saw last night in Dallas was unconscionable. We as a country mourn for 
the five police officers senselessly murdered during a peaceful protest. We 
extend our hearts to the wounded, to the families and loved ones left behind, 
to the entire law enforcement community, and to a nation that has experienced 
much suffering and heartbreak over the course of a difficult week.

This is a cruel reminder that law enforcement officials selflessly put 
themselves in harm’s way day in and day out to keep our communities safe. Their 
spouses and loved ones also carry that incredible burden with them. We as a 
nation are here to grieve with them, to thank them for their unwavering 
courage, and to reassure them that Americans will stand by them in the days to 
come.

Now is the time to come together as nation, not pull further apart, and let 
justice and healing be our guide.”

 that New York police commissioner Bill Bratton has rejected, strongly, a

the midtown north precinct:

“Our interest is staying out of the politics of the moment, and not to provide 
photo ops,” he told reporters. “If Mr. Trump wants to speak to me, I would be 
happy to brief him on what we’re doing. If Sen. Clinton wants to speak to me, I

leader of the court’s liberal wing said she presumes DemocratHillary Clinton 
<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/hillary-clinton.htm> will be the

don’t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then 
everything is up for grabs.”

That includes the future of the high court itself, on which she is the oldest 
justice. Two justices, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer, are in their late 
70s.

“It’s likely that the next president, whoever she will be, will have a few 
appointments to make,” Ginsburg said, smiling.

Donald Trump has solicited donations from foreign members of foreign 
parliaments.Hillary Clinton’s campaign has gone looking for overseas cash, too 
– albeit from US citizens, who can legally contributed (and in what sounds like 
a much more organized way than the as-yet-unexplained Trump effort), according

:

Hillary Clinton’s campaign held fundraising events in five foreign cities 
Thursday, offering U.S. lawyers living overseas the chance to have a “virtual 
policy conversation” with Sen. Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia, one of Clinton’s 
potential running mates.

Thursday’s receptions — held simultaneously in Moscow, Paris, Rome, Warsaw and 
Zurich — served as the kickoff of a new Lawyers Abroad for Hillary program, 
part of an aggressive push by the putative Democratic presidential nominee to 
tap new constituencies for funds as she ramps up for the general election.

be completely discussed”. Jennifer Olsen, a Trump supporter from Missouri, felt 
“this country has the perception of a democracy ... but federal politics are 
corrupt”. In particular, several people like Julie Stevens, a Democrat from 
Minnesota, pointed to the effect of Citizens United.

This is a reference to a 2010 ruling by the supreme court that removed many 
existing limitations on outside groups spending money to influence elections. 
It enabled the creation Super Political Action Committees, orSuper Pacs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-pacs>, organizations independent of 
the candidates’ campaigns which, unlike the campaigns, may raise unlimited 
amounts of money from individual donors. There were prophecies that these 
faceless funders of attack ads would seize control of American democracy.

Six years later, has this come to pass? Some believe so. Sanders tweeted 
earlier this year: “One of the most disastrous Supreme Court decisions in my 
lifetime. In essence, this ruling handed millionaires and billionaires – who 
have already rigged our economy – unlimited influence in our elections.”

The state department is reopening an internal investigation of possible 
mishandling of classified information byHillary Clinton

Spokesman John Kirby says the emails probe is restarting now that the 
Department of Justice isn’t pursuing a criminal prosecution. The Department of 
State suspended its review in April to avoid interfering withthe FBI’s inquiry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton-email-investigation-no-charges-loretta-lynch>
.

Kirby set no deadline for the investigation’s completion.

Clinton was secretary of state until early 2013. Most of her top advisers left 
shortly thereafter.

But Kirby said this week former officials can still face “administrative 
sanctions”. The most serious is loss of security clearances, which could 
complicate Clinton’s naming of a national security team if she becomes 
president.

Beyond the Democratic frontrunner, the probe is most likely examining 
confidants Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan and Huma Abedin.

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell calls the Dallas attack 
“unconscionable”. Here’s his full statement:

What we saw last night in Dallas was unconscionable. We as a country mourn for 
the five police officers senselessly murdered during a peaceful protest. We 
extend our hearts to the wounded, to the families and loved ones left behind, 
to the entire law enforcement community, and to a nation that has experienced 
much suffering and heartbreak over the course of a difficult week.

This is a cruel reminder that law enforcement officials selflessly put 
themselves in harm’s way day in and day out to keep our communities safe. Their 
spouses and loved ones also carry that incredible burden with them. We as a 
nation are here to grieve with them, to thank them for their unwavering 
courage, and to reassure them that Americans will stand by them in the days to 
come.

Now is the time to come together as nation, not pull further apart, and let 
justice and healing be our guide.”
 
Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and potential Trump running mate, has 
spoken on Facebook live about how “normal, white” Americans do not “understand 
being black in America” and “instinctively under-estimate the level of 
discrimination and the level of additional risk”:
