Opposition leaders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/congo> say they plan further street protests 
to pressure President Joseph Kabila to call elections, despite the deaths of 
dozens of demonstrators earlier this week.


No DRC leader gives up power peacefully, so why would Joseph Kabila?

The call for an intensified street campaign will concern the international 
community, which has watched the continued turmoil in the vast central African 
state with increasing alarm.

 About 40 demonstrators, as well as at least six police officers, were killed 
in clashes with security forces in Kinshasa, the capital, on Monday and 
Tuesday. Buildings, including theoffices of major opposition parties,

 were badly damaged amid widespread looting.

 “We will keep up the pressure … and announce more street actions and more 
demonstrations until Mr Kabila is removed from office,” Martin Fayulu, a 
parliamentarian and leader of an opposition party, told the Guardian.

“[Taking to] the street is a right of popular expression in the face of a 
power that cannot be heard or seen,” said Ève Bazaïba, another major 
opposition politician.

 The DRC has suffered repeated bouts of unrest since Kabila, 45, announced 
that elections scheduled for later this year would be delayed.

 Opponents say Kabila, whose second term in office expires in December, is 
trying to cling to power, either by delaying elections or revising the 
constitution. His supporters say logistical and financial constraints mean it 
is impossible to hold fair polls as planned.

Analysts say this week’s violence marked a turning point.

“Until now all the focus was on political dialogue. Now it is shifting from 
the corridors of power to the street. Kabila thinks he may be able to tough it 
out. The opposition thinks it might provoke a crisis,” said Jason Stearns, 
director of the Congo Research Group at New York University.

Kabila took over as leader of the DRC less than two weeks after his father, 
Laurent, was shot by a bodyguard in the presidential palace in 2001. He was 
elected president in disputed polls in 2006 and again in 2011. The DRC’s 
constitution bars a third term.

Analysts say Kabila appears to have adopted a strategy of “glissement”, or 
indefinite delay.

Western states, including the US, have repeatedly told Kabila to stick to the 
election calendar. Several – most notably the US – are now considering targeted 
sanctions against key senior individuals within his inner circle. However the 
opposition is fragmented, with some major figures overseas and others joining 
talks with the president’s representatives.

Juvénal Munubo, a parliamentarian with the opposition Union Pour La Nation 
Congolaise said that the coming weeks would see a surge in violence if Kabila 
did not clarify his position on leaving power and move to reduce tensions with 
political opponents by releasing political prisoners or dropping law cases 
against dissidents.

Munubo called for a new date for the election to be fixed for next year as 
soon as possible. “The negotiations are the best way forward but must be 
inclusive and conclude rapidly,” he said.

The office of Kabila, who has been abroad during the unrest attending the 
United Nations general assembly in New York, issued its first statement on 
Wednesday condemning the violence and offering its condolences to victims’ 
families.

Kabila “invites the entire population to go about their daily activities now 
that security is again fully ensured,” it said on state-owned television.

Human rights groups say they have catalogued a wave of detentions, 
disappearances and attacks on opponents of the government. Government officials 
have denied the allegations.

“The DRC looks forward to working with the international community, civil 
society and opposition parties to advance democracy and rule of law,” said 
Barnabé Kikaya bin Karubi, chief diplomatic adviser to Kabila.

One point of contention is the timing of different sets of elections. Another 
is the revision of the electoral roll.

Kabila loyalists say problems with the electoral roll make it impossible to 
hold a fair poll this year. The current version is thought to exclude about 
half of the DRC’s 45 million potential voters, including about 7 million new 
voters who have come of age since 2011. Independent experts have said a 
complete revision could take 10-18 months.

Whereas neighbouring strongmen Denis Sassou Nguesso in Congo-Brazzaville 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/congo-brazzaville> and Paul Kagame in Rwanda 
easily pushed through constitutional changes to allow them to stand for third 
terms, Kabila has been unable to take such a blunt approach.

Kabila did manage to outmanoeuvre Moïse Katumbi, a tycoon who was seen as a 
powerful challenger. Katumbi, who had built a support base in Katanga province, 
was forced to leave the country earlier this year to seek medical treatment.

Katumbi is currently in Washington, from where he issued a call for sanctions 
this week. “Without sanctions, they will continue killing people like 
mosquitoes,” Katumbi said.

Congo has found itself the focus of a range of foreign actors in recent weeks. 
These include the governments of France and the former colonial power, Belgium. 
An Italian MEP of Congolese origin took to YouTube last week, saying she was 
“proud to see the Congolese people rise up for their rights”.

However the attitude of the US is key, and both Katumbi and Kabila have 
engaged lobbyists 
<http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/296735-lobbyists-pulled-into-congos-election-strife>
 in Washington, recognising that winning the battle for policymakers’ opinion 
there may be the way to win the struggle for power.

The frustration of US officials with Kabila is increasingly evident. Bin 
Karubi, the president’s adviser, described his recent trip to Washington as a 
“pleading mission” to avert sanctions.

Bilateral aid cuts are also possible – though most assistance is humanitarian 
and thus difficult to reduce without hurting ordinary people. Though GDP growth 
in Congo is estimated at around 5% per annum, there are deep economic problems 
and entrenched poverty.

Some observers argue that both the government and opposition parties no longer 
reflect popular frustration at harsh living conditions.

“The political elite is arguing over power. The opposition are trying to 
gather the popular frustration to their side to oust Kabila but people are 
getting quite frustrating with a strategy which has made it very hard for them 
to provide for their families,” said Hans Hoebeke, a Congo analyst with the 
International Crisis Group.

Damas, 35, is a qualified electrician but drives a taxi. His neighbourhood, 
Kinsuka, in south Kinshasa, saw significant violence last week.

“Really there is too much suffering here, in Congo. Even if you work, the ends 
of the month are tough ... Here there is no middle class. You are either very 
rich or very poor. If you have any chance to get out somehow, you’ve got to 
seize it,” he said.

Almost all observers predict more unrest. 

“There will be further protests in the street, the question is: where will 
they lead? Are they just going to lead to turmoil that is manageable for 
Kabila? Or call into question the economic and political stability of the 
country? We are talking about months, possibly years, of instability, and that 
could take us anywhere,” Stearns said.
