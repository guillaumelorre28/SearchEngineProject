Technology? Bah humbug: “I think we ought to get on with our lives,” said 
Donald Trump on Wednesday, summing up his take on the complex problem of
apparently Russian phishing attacks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/29/cozy-bear-fancy-bear-russia-hack-dnc>
 on multiple Democratic party groups during the 2016 election.

As the White House’s current resident prepared to impose sanctions on Russia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/29/barack-obama-sanctions-russia-election-hack>
 for hacking, Trump said: “I think that computers have complicated lives very 
greatly. The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly 
what’s going on.”

It’s not the first time the president-elect has been stumped by the digital 
world, like a technophobe who unwrapped a computer-operated nuclear arsenal on 
Christmas morning. And the trouble isn’t that nobody knows exactly what’s going 
on in the “age of computer” – it’s that technology poses some of the most 
complex problems in human history to the incoming administration. And its 
leader is a man who refers to “the cyber

” and seems more concerned about the weight of the hacker, or possibly the bed –
his syntax is mysterious

 – than about who broke into the Democratic National Committee.

It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on 
their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?
Trump on the DNC hack during the second presidential debate 
US authorities spent 2016 attempting to chart new territory even beyond the 
DNC, DCCC and Clinton campaign hacks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election>
: how can Americans protect their infrastructure from attacks on the 
foundations of the internet, such as theMirai botnet siege 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/ddos-attack-dyn-internet-denial-service>
 in October that took down some of the biggest, and most sophisticated, tech 
companies in the world? How can the nation’s patchwork of electoral authorities 
repair voting systems prone to massive, potentially catastrophic error? How 
should the government treat open-source encryption? Trump remains silent on the 
details of digital policy as the leader-to-be of a government in desperate need 
of consistent guiding principles.

Instead, Trump appears to regard technology as a contact point for the same 
obsessions that drove his campaign. He is blase about warrantless surveillance 
– he has said it “would be fine 
<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/2/donald-trump-nsa-phone-snooping-program-i-err-side/>
” to restore the NSA’s bulk data collection programs, a position his pick for 
CIA director, Mike Pompeo, also endorses, as does Trump’s attorney general 
nominee, Jeff Sessions. He is far more actively concerned about appearing 
stronger than his predecessor, Barack Obama, and as always about Chinese 
activity in cyberspace:

I would bet that we have many great American technology companies that would 
build and fix the pathetic ObamaCare website for ZERO dollars!

He also occasionally made time during the campaign to mock opponent Hillary 
Clinton for getting sick and getting hacked:

Trump has been general, albeit chilling, on the topic of what exactly his 
administration will do: as an extension of Trump’s ideology, information 
gathering will serve to do the unthinkable – his own word. “We’re going to have 
to do things that we never did before,” hetold 
<https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-has-big-plans-1303117537878070.html> 
Yahoo News. “And some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that 
now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule. And certain things 
will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of 
information and learning about the enemy. And so we’re going to have to do 
certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago.”

Peter Thiel, who gave $1.25m to Trump, has called date rape 'belated regret'

The apparent lack of interest in the minutiae of his own positions has left 
his administration’s tech strategy in the hands of Peter Thiel, the 
thin-skinned billionaire founder of PayPal whoquietly bankrolled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/26/paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-admits-bankrolling-hulk-hogan-gawker-lawsuit>
 former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan’s annihilating lawsuit against news outlet 
Gawker, apparently in retaliation for an article about Thiel’s sexual 
orientation.

Earlier this month, Thiel indulged Trump’s own grudge against Twitter during 
the president-elect’s “tech summit” at Trump Tower, shutting out the 
organization that provides Trump with his loudest megaphone reportedly because 
Twitter refused to add an emoji to the Trump campaign’s #CrookedHillary 
sponsored hashtag during the election. Another of Thiel’s companies, 
data-mining firm Palantir, already plays a powerful role: the company’s 
services are likely to be used in any effort todeport undocumented immigrants 
<https://theintercept.com/2016/12/12/transition-adviser-peter-thiel-would-directly-profit-from-mass-deportations/>
, according tomultiple reports

.

But for the president-elect himself, technology appears to be yet another 
venue for increasingly dangerous hobbies including threats to cut programs that 
benefit US allies, brinksmanship with China and unraveling Obamacare.

Trump calls net neutrality 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/net-neutrality> “a top-down power grab” 
that “will target conservative media”; he has often repeated his support for a 
registry of American Muslims, and generally demonstrates not merely a lack of 
proficiency in technology but a contempt for expertise. But like every rich guy 
who wants to stay that way, he keeps a couple of eggheads around, and between 
him and them, when it comes to tech policy they will make America … something. 
Possibly not great.
