Viking battle at Lindisfarne, Northumberland, 20-21 August

Watch as Vikings storm the Holy Island of Lindisfarne, re-enacting the kind of 
terror they unleashed on terrified locals back in AD793. After the fight is 
over, you can explore the Viking camp and watch Norse warriors enjoying some 
downtime: cooking, sewing and looking after their weapons. Weather permitting, 
a Viking long boat will sail around the encampment. The island is accessible 
only at low tide across a causeway – from 10.05am until 5.55pm (Saturday) and 
from 10.30am until 6.50pm (Sunday).

DIY history breaks

Why not get a group of friends together at a Landmark Trust property for a 
Jane Austen-inspired holiday, or a medieval banquet in a 13th-century hall? 
Choose a character from Northanger Abbey, don your regency costume and stay at 
Elton House, overlooking Abbey Green in the centre of Bath. The house dates 
from 1700 and much of its character and original features – cornicing, 
panelling and a sweeping wooden staircase – have been preserved. Or head to 
thatched Purton Green in Suffolk, which gives a satisfying time-warp feel as 
you leave your car and walk through fields to reach the threshold of its great 
medieval hall, built in 1250.
