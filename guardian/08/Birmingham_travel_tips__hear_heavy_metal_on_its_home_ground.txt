Soul music, according to the decidedly non-Birmingham-related film The 
Commitments, is "the rhythm of sex. Rhythm of the factory, too". Sex, maybe, 
but if any sound has the rhythm of the factory – the hammering, the drilling 
and the thumping – it's heavy metal, and Birmingham in the late 60s and 70s had 
both. The second city hadn't served its denim and leather heritage well until 
Capsule (capsule.org.uk <http://www.capsule.org.uk/>) produced a huge Home of 
Metal (homeofmetal.com <http://www.homeofmetal.com/>) exhibition that recreated 
the factories where members of bands such as Black Sabbath worked. Now metal 
bands are a fixture in the Flapper down by the canal and at the Rainbow (High 
Street, Digbeth,therainbowvenues.co.uk <http://therainbowvenues.co.uk/>), where 
even the beer garden is soundproofed. The factories are all but gone but the 
noise remains.
