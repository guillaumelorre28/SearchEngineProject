In a nutshell

If you’ve not visited Bristol, this short route is a great introduction. It’s 
a walk of contrasts, taking you past old and new, from beautiful streets with 
elegant Georgian houses and historic buildings, to shopping centres and lively 
markets.

Enjoy culture at the Arnolfini arts centre <http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/> or 
theGeorgian House Museum 
<http://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/georgian-house-museum/>, an 18th-century 
townhouse that’s been restored to capture the era, which is great for history 
lovers.

Why it’s special

You could do this walk in an hour and a half or linger and take all day, it’s 
so packed with interesting things to see and do, and history and culture to 
absorb.

As you set off you’ll pass Pero’s Bridge, a lifting bridge with its 
distinctive horned structures, and head into Queen Square, a beautiful Queen 
Anne-style, tree-filled space with a statue of William III in the centre. Given 
its peaceful vibe, you may be surprised to learn the inner ring road once ran 
right through the middle, but was relocated in 2000.

Past the merchant navy memorial and St Nicholas church you’ll arrive at the 
vibrantSt Nicholas market <http://www.bristol.gov.uk/nav/st-nicholas-markets>, 
the oldest market in Bristol, full of cafes and little shops, and then St 
Peter’s church, roofless after being bombed in the second world war.

Shopping alert! The route takes you through Broadmead shopping centre and down 
Colston Street with its quaint shops and cafes.

Art lovers should look out for Christmas Steps, a beautiful lane that’s home 
to the arts quarter of the city, and if you’re a fan of architecture, check out 
the Wills Memorial building, one of the city’s most recognisable, with its 
gothic revival tower soaring high above the streets.

Then you’ll wind your way through Brandon Hill park to the Cabot Tower 
<http://visitbristol.co.uk/things-to-do/cabot-tower-and-brandon-hill-p24401>, 
where you can climb the steps to enjoy panoramic views across the city.

The final stretch of this walk takes you past a mural painted by homegrown 
artist Banksy, before passing the cathedral andAt-Bristol 
<https://www.at-bristol.org.uk/>, an interactive science centre, and the city’s 
aquarium.

There are plenty of pubs, cafes, food stalls and restaurants along this route.
