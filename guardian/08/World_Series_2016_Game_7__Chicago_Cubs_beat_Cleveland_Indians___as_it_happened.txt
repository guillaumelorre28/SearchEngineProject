It's over!

The Cubs will wake up as champions for the first time in more than a century, 
and Cleveland fans, who should be proud of this ballclub, will begin to pick up 
the pieces. The season is over, winter is coming and months will pass before 
the carousel starts up for another round. It’s been a historic playoffs - thank 
for following it with us. Stay tuned for moreWorld Series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/world-series> coverage, but for now, thanks 
for reading, and wherever you are, good morning, good afternoon and goodnight.

It happened!

It wouldn’t have been the same if Chicago steamrolled over Cleveland. 

It needed to be hard earned, they needed to be pressed to the limit. The Cubs 
needed to climb out of a 3-1 hole, because if you’re going to undo 108 years of 
history, it has to come in a unique way. They had to blow a 5-1 lead. They had 
to watch their nearly flawless closer melt down. They had to bring on a pair of 
back-end roster relievers to pull it out.

It’s not that the trauma validates the achievement - a championship is a 
championship, as a sweep or in seven. But for this franchise, the lovable 
losers, it had to be tedious, heart-stopping and dramatic for the drought to 
end in a way that felt right

And it did. 

Congratulations to the Cubs, and the Cleveland Indians 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cleveland-indians>, who put baseball on top 
and turned October and November a into in festival of the game.

How about that? I mean (shaking his head) I’ve seen the guys and the coaches 
and the players who have been through it all, and the fans...it’s unbelievable, 
to be a part of this, I don’t have words to really tell you how I feel about 
this, I think it’s all surreal.

in history together we’re brothers forever!

Cubs 8-7 Indians, Final

Mike Martinez’ grounder lands into the glove of Kris Bryant - he fires to 
first in time and THE IMPOSSIBLE HAS FINALLY HAPPENED!

After 108 years, countless heartbreak, and generations of fans living without 
witnessing their team win a title, the drought is over!

Davis - a line drive base hit to center, Guyer, who had taken second on 
defensive indifference comes around to score! We have ourselves a one-run

Cubs 8-6 Indians, bottom of the 10th

BALL FOUR! Here comes Rajai Davis, who seems to have some sort of penchant for 
the dramatic - he represents the tying run, just as he did in the eighth. 
Pitching coach Chris Bosio is on for a chat. Now he’s gone - here we go.

Cubs 8-6 Indians, bottom of the 10th

He’s 25 and was a 48th round draft pick - now he has the first out of the 
biggest inning in franchise history.

Napoli goes down on strikes! THE CUBS ARE TWO OUTS AWAY! Here is Jose Ramirez.

Baez skies to center, easy for Davis, and the Cubs are THREE OUTS AWAY!

Can they hold on this time? And who is going to pitch for Chicago?

Cubs 8-6 Indians, top of the 10th

Heyward swings at a pitch barely out of the hand of Bauer and it’s 0-2. 
Another ball in the dirt and Heyward can’t help himself again - strike three, 
two down. Here is Baez.

There are some big runs on those bases.

Cubs 8-6 Indians, top of the 10th

So the bases are still loaded, there is still one out and now here comes 
Trevor Bauer, a starter who knows a thing or two about relieving, as he started 
the season in the bullpen and has been a sort of Swiss Army knife for Francona.

Bryant skies DEEP TO CENTER, at the wall - Davis makes the catch - Almora tags

batting with runners on first and second and one out.

WE'RE BACK! Cubs 6-6 Indians, top of the 10th

Schwarber steps in and promptly takes Shaw to right field, beating the shift 
for a lead-off base hit! He’s removed for a pinch runner after his third hit of 
the ninth.

Albert Almora Jr is now standing at first and Bryant is at the plate!

Chapman

FOX TV in the US is saying that Chapman was crying as he left the dugout. His 
season is surely done after the break, which could be ending at 12:15 EST. How 
about Shaw? Is he done?

A-Rod

Alex Rodriguez has been telling anyone who would listen over the past few days 
that Chapman is a routine guy, who likes to work clean ninth innings and that 
Maddon was playing with fire. A-Rod, A-Genius (rimshot).

Monday 27 October 2008 

It was Game 5 of the World Series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/world-series> in Philadelphia where the 
Phillies were trying to clinch against the AL Champion Tampa Bay Rays, managed 
by Joe Maddon. Rain fell and fell and the game was suspended in the top of the 
sixth inning.

That game wasn’t resumed until Wednesday, an unprecedented move. 

What about now?

For my next trick...

I will be belly-flopping across the tarp. 

The umps are saying they don’t want rain to decide this game so they’ll wait 
it out. They expect to finish this game based on radar.

The Cubs will wake up as champions for the first time in more than a century, 
and Cleveland fans, who should be proud of this ballclub, will begin to pick up 
the pieces. The season is over, winter is coming and months will pass before 
the carousel starts up for another round. It’s been a historic playoffs - thank 
for following it with us. Stay tuned for moreWorld Series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/world-series> coverage, but for now, thanks 
for reading, and wherever you are, good morning, good afternoon and goodnight.


Cubs win first World Series title since 1908 after beating Indians in Game 7

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/03/world-series-game-7-chicago-cubs-cleveland-indians-mlb> 
It wouldn’t have been the same if Chicago steamrolled over Cleveland. 

It needed to be hard earned, they needed to be pressed to the limit. The Cubs 
needed to climb out of a 3-1 hole, because if you’re going to undo 108 years of 
history, it has to come in a unique way. They had to blow a 5-1 lead. They had 
to watch their nearly flawless closer melt down. They had to bring on a pair of 
back-end roster relievers to pull it out.

It’s not that the trauma validates the achievement - a championship is a 
championship, as a sweep or in seven. But for this franchise, the lovable 
losers, it had to be tedious, heart-stopping and dramatic for the drought to 
end in a way that felt right

And it did. 

Congratulations to the Cubs, and the Cleveland Indians 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cleveland-indians>, who put baseball on top 
and turned October and November a into in festival of the game.

 
How about that? I mean (shaking his head) I’ve seen the guys and the coaches 
and the players who have been through it all, and the fans...it’s unbelievable, 
to be a part of this, I don’t have words to really tell you how I feel about 
this, I think it’s all surreal.

It’s gonna be up there!
 
It happened, Chicago it happened we did it we’re World Champions! I can’t 
believe it...I can’t even put it into words...we’re in the books, this team is 
in history together we’re brothers forever!

-Anthony Rizzo
 
Mike Martinez’ grounder lands into the glove of Kris Bryant - he fires to 
first in time and THE IMPOSSIBLE HAS FINALLY HAPPENED!

After 108 years, countless heartbreak, and generations of fans living without 
witnessing their team win a title, the drought is over!
 
The Chicago Cubs <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chicago-cubs> have won the 
World Series for the first time since 1908!

Wouldn't it be something if Trevor Bauer and Mike Montgomery end up as the 
final pitchers tonight in relief. Hart High teammates.

Cubs 8-7 Indians, bottom of the 10th

That will do it for Edwards Jr - here comes Mike Montgomery to get the hardest 
out. Breathe everyone, breathe.
 
Davis - a line drive base hit to center, Guyer, who had taken second on 
defensive indifference comes around to score! We have ourselves a one-run 
ballgame!
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, bottom of the 10th

BALL FOUR! Here comes Rajai Davis, who seems to have some sort of penchant for 
the dramatic - he represents the tying run, just as he did in the eighth. 
Pitching coach Chris Bosio is on for a chat. Now he’s gone - here we go.
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, bottom of the 10th

Right down Broadway - 3-1. 
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, bottom of the 10th

It’s 3-0. Think he’s going to take this pitc?
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, bottom of the 10th

It’s 2-0 to Guyer...did you think this was going to be easy?
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, bottom of the 10th

Ground ball to short - Russell has it, fires to first - two down! 

The Cubs are one out away and it’s all up to Guyer for Cleveland!
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, bottom of the 10th

Now it’s 2-2.

Cleveland need that bloop, then a blast...but they will settle for a walk and 
a blast.
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, bottom of the 10th

It’s o-2 to Ramirez!
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, bottom of the 10th

He’s 25 and was a 48th round draft pick - now he has the first out of the 
biggest inning in franchise history.

Napoli goes down on strikes! THE CUBS ARE TWO OUTS AWAY! Here is Jose Ramirez. 
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, bottom of the 10th

Carl Edwards Jr comes on to try and save this World Series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/world-series> for the Cubs, just as Joe 
Maddon drew it up. Napoli is first.
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, top of the 10th

Baez skies to center, easy for Davis, and the Cubs are THREE OUTS AWAY!

Can they hold on this time? And who is going to pitch for Chicago? 
 John Keefe (@JohnWKeefe) 
Keep all sharp objects, including Swiss Army knife references, away from Bauer.

<https://twitter.com/JohnWKeefe/status/794034474338185216> 
Very sharp reply!
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, top of the 10th

Baez, a huge cut on a 1-1 95MPH fastball. Can Bauer get past the Cubs second 
baseman and keep their lead at two?
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, top of the 10th

Heyward swings at a pitch barely out of the hand of Bauer and it’s 0-2. 
Another ball in the dirt and Heyward can’t help himself again - strike three, 
two down. Here is Baez.

There are some big runs on those bases.
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, top of the 10th

So the bases are still loaded, there is still one out and now here comes 
Trevor Bauer, a starter who knows a thing or two about relieving, as he started 
the season in the bullpen and has been a sort of Swiss Army knife for Francona. 
Heyward at the playte.
 
Cubs 8-6 Indians, top of the 10th

Here comes Tito to get Shaw, who may or may not have been affected by the rain 
delay.
 
YES THEY CAN! Montero delivers a pinch hit RBI knock and the Cubs are suddenly 
up two!
 
Cubs 7-6 Indians, top of the 10th

Can the Cubs get that insurance run? Addison Russell is intentionally walked - 
so it’s bases loaded and one out for the pinch-hitting Miguel Montero
 
He wastes a pitch and then goes opposite field! Base hit, here comes Almora 
around to score - Cubs lead!

 
Cubs 6-6 Indians, top of the 10th

Zobrist is down in the count - it’s 1-2!
 
Cubs 6-6 Indians, top of the 10th

Bryant skies DEEP TO CENTER, at the wall - Davis makes the catch - Almora tags 
- great base running! Now Rizzo is walked intentionally, and here is Zobrist 
batting with runners on first and second and one out.
 
Cubs 6-6 Indians, top of the 10th

It’s 2-2 to Bryant. The crowd are eerily quiet...
 
Schwarber steps in and promptly takes Shaw to right field, beating the shift 
for a lead-off base hit! He’s removed for a pinch runner after his third hit of 
the ninth.

Albert Almora Jr is now standing at first and Bryant is at the plate!

Chapman

FOX TV in the US is saying that Chapman was crying as he left the dugout. His 
season is surely done after the break, which could be ending at 12:15 EST. How 
about Shaw? Is he done?
 
A-Rod

Alex Rodriguez has been telling anyone who would listen over the past few days 
that Chapman is a routine guy, who likes to work clean ninth innings and that 
Maddon was playing with fire. A-Rod, A-Genius (rimshot).
 
Monday 27 October 2008 

It was Game 5 of the World Series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/world-series> in Philadelphia where the 
Phillies were trying to clinch against the AL Champion Tampa Bay Rays, managed 
by Joe Maddon. Rain fell and fell and the game was suspended in the top of the 
sixth inning.

That game wasn’t resumed until Wednesday, an unprecedented move. 

What about now?
 
For my next trick...

I will be belly-flopping across the tarp. 

The umps are saying they don’t want rain to decide this game so they’ll wait 
it out. They expect to finish this game based on radar.
