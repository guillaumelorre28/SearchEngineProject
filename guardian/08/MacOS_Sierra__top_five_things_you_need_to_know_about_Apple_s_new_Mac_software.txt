OS X is dead. Long live macOS. Apple’s new version of its Mac operating system 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/13/mac-os-sierra-apple-os-x-siri-desktop-wwdc>
 – Sierra – will be available for download later today.


The free upgrade is available for almost any Mac from late 2009 and will be 
available via the Mac App Store later today. While some might want to hold off 
immediately updating, given the recent trouble with early updates, here are 
five new things to be found by those who do wish to change to macOS Sierra.

1. Siri

 Siri is now available on your desktop or laptop. Photograph: Apple 
The biggest change for Sierra other than the name is Siri. The same voice 
assistant from the iPhone and iPad is now on the Mac with similar features and 
faults. It can find files for you using natural language as introduced with El 
Capitan, set appointments, check spellings, play music and tell you the 
weather, but how much you use it depends on where you work: colleagues in your 
open-plan office aren’t going to love the fact that you just started talking to 
your computer.

 Universal clipboard means you can copy on one machine and paste on another 
without having to send any files or communications between the two. Photograph: 
Apple 
Have you ever wanted to paste something between two Macs or a Mac and an 
iPhone or iPad? Now you can. Just copy something on one machine, hit paste on 
the other and wait. Sometimes it takes a while, depending on how good your 
connection is, but it works surprisingly well. It works for text, images and 
most other things you might copy to the clipboard.

 iCloud Drive transports all the files on your desktop between machines. 
Photograph: Apple 
While some are organised and store all their files in carefully organised 
folders, many just have everything dumped on the desktop and locked on a single 
machine. iCloud Drive desktop can now sync files and folders on the desktop 
between machines and to iPhones or iPads, so everything not organised is 
accessible from multiple machines.

4. Everything is in a tab now

 View documents and other multiple-window apps in tabbed view, as watch the odd 
video over the top at the same time with picture-in-picture display. 
Photograph: Apple 
The tabbed interface kickstarted by browsers has now come to more or less 
everything in Sierra. From text editors to photos editing, budgeting apps and 
email, hitting the “Merge All Windows” option under the Window drop down in the 
status bar merges the windows from one app into one tabbed interface. Not 
everything supports it immediately, and some that do have half-baked 
implementations, but if you wanted tabs everywhere on a Mac, now’s your chance.

 View your memories within Photos. Photograph: Apple 
Aside from big Mac features, MacOS Sierra also adds compatibility with most of 
the new features from iOS 10. Now you can pay for things using your Touch ID 
sensor on your iPhone on the web, you can send fancy chat things with iOS 10 
users in Messages, view videos handled by the Quicktime Player in a floating 
window, and even unlock your Mac using an Apple Watch, if you own one.Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> Music in iTunes now looks more 
like the iOS version too, and the Memories feature from the iOS Photos app is 
now in the MacOS Sierra Photos app. MacOS also promises to free up some space 
on your Mac by storing unused files within iCloud drive, but how much space it 
can free up depends on what types of files are taking up your hard drive.
