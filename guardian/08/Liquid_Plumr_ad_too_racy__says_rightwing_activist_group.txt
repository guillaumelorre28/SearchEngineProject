The creators of a sexually suggestive television ad for drain cleaner may have 
just gotten an unlikely publicity boost from a conservative action group.

The group One Million Moms has launched a letter writing campaign to have a 
new ad for Liquid-Plumr Douple Impact removed from television.

In the commercial, a housewife encounters the product in a grocery store aisle 
and ponders whether to add it to her trolley. "Liquid-Plumr Double Impact," she 
says. "Double impact?"

Then she falls into a dream in which a pair of studly plumbers call on her at 
home. "I'm here to snake your drain," says one. "I'm here to flush your pipe," 
says the other.

"The new Liquid-Plumr ad is offensive and completely inappropriate for 
television," reads a call to actionon the One Million Moms web site 
<http://onemillionmoms.com/IssueDetail.asp?id=441>. The site asks readers to 
urge the product manufacturer, the Clorox Company, to "pull this offensive 
commercial immediately and go back to their more responsible advertisement 
methods."

DDB San Francisco is the agency behind the spot, and a fellow named, ahem, 
Clay Weiner <http://www.biscuitfilmworks.com/clay-weiner.html> directed it. The 
Clorox Company did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

Last month One Million Moms attracted controversy for putting pressure on the 
JCPenney companyto fire Ellen DeGeneres

 as a spokesperson because she is lesbian.
