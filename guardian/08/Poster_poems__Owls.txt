Driving home late the other week I was startled by a sudden apparition that 
flew out of the night, passed in front of my car and disappeared again. It was, 
of course, an owl, that great symbolic bird whose associations with the night, 
death, wisdom and the numinous make it one of the most written-about of all 
birds of prey. There was a kind of calm dignity to this chance encounter that 
led me to reconsider a poem I had recently discovered, Polly Atkin'sthe bird 
that makes you afraid 
<http://www.basilbuntingaward.co.uk/media/download_gallery/2010Shortlist/000186-3.pdf>
 [PDF], a title that derives from the Cameroonian name for owl. Atkin's poem is 
a catalogue of reasons to fear, and yet my encounter resulted in a feeling that 
was quite different, a kind of calm awe.

Different again is Australian poet Dorothy Hewett's description of her 
encounterin a poem called Owl 
<http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/hewett-dorothy/owl-0329027>. Hers was a 
more direct and head-on meeting when bird and windscreen came into contact. 
Fortunately the owl survived and later demonstrated its magical shape-shifting 
properties when she saw it walking around town in jeans and a hat.

The owl's reputation for wisdom is proverbial and probably derives from its 
mythological role as the companion of the goddess Minerva. For many of us it 
was learned in childhood from the rhyme
 A wise old owl lived in an oak 
The more he saw the less he spoke 
The less he spoke the more he heard. 
Why can't we all be like that wise old bird? 
Being wise, the owl makes a fine judge, as Emily Dickinson recognises 
<http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/emily_dickinson/poems/9695>. However, 
being the poet she was, she soon moves away from the symbolic to an actual bird 
in a real barn, singing a real and welcome refrain.

Perhaps the strangest owl song in English poetry was given to us by 
Dickinson's near contemporary Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. He's not the kind of 
poet we would usually thing of as a proto-modernist, but hisSong of the Owl 
<http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/22081>, based on the work of 
ethnologistHenry Rowe Schoolcraft 
<http://shs.umsystem.edu/historicmissourians/name/s/schoolcraft/index.html> 
reads like a cross between Louis Zukofsky and Jerome Rothenberg performing at 
some minimalist slam. It's a long way fromShakespeare's "Tu-whit;/Tu-who, a 
merry note" <http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/shakespeare/winter.html>.

In another poem called Owl 
<http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/ted_hughes/poems/13824>, Ted Hughes 
characteristically begins by claiming to see the world anew through the eyes of 
the owl only to end up undercutting this claim to owlness by realising that an 
actual owl has mistaken him not for a fellow being, but as a wooden post to be 
perched upon, with potentially painful results.George MacBeth's owl poem 
<http://forum.fellrunner.org.uk/showthread.php?9261-Today-s-poet&s=26195af938d2cedd0e551dd57f36e16c&p=312019&viewfull=1#post312019>
 is a more successful case of identification, and its masterly use of 
incantatory rhythms and sound patternings fully earn the final "Am an owl, am 
an owl". This is the bird as both itself and a kind of divine presence, a 
doorway into a deeper self.

Fine as MacBeth's poem may be, it's a pleasant relief to turn to Edward Lear's 
guitar-playing "elegant fowl" and his cat lover 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171941>. Light as the poem is, you can't 
help thinking that it's a match made in darkness and aptly consumated "by the 
light of the moon". Finally,Lorine Niedecker 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/246358> reminds us that 
sometimes an owl is just an owl, standing for itself and nothing else at all.

Despite Neidecker's best efforts, few birds have been made to stand for so 
much in poetry as the owl has, and certainly very few nocturnal birds feature 
in verse so often. For anyone who has encountered one of these magnificent 
creatures, this will come as no surprise, but even those readers who have not 
will have a rich sense of the owl's symbolism from sources as various as Homer 
and AA Milne. This month's invitation is to record your personal owlish 
experiences and associations.
