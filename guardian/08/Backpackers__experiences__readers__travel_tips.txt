Winning tip: Night train to Siping, China


The sleeper train journey from Beijing to Siping in Jilin province takes about 
11 hours. I was sort of swept to the right compartment by a combination of 
conductors and passengers. My bunk was the topmost of three and I was halfway 
up there when a yank on my foot brought me back down again: a fellow passenger 
wanted to make it clear that I really should take off my shoes. I was then 
shooed back up the ladder once more. During the night, marching music was piped 
over the speakers at regular intervals; and at stations, food vendors dangled 
dried chicken feet and baskets of dumplings through the windows on long sticks.

Eating featured a lot on the sleeper train; on the other hand, sleeping 
didn’t. Of my three nights in northern China, this was the worst night’s sleep 
but the best night’s sleeplessness.

This is a rather specific recommendation. It only occurs once a year, on 7-8 
December – but for just over 24 hours, the vast majority of Ruta 68, a motorway 
running from Santiago to Valparaíso, is shut down, with no cars in sight. The 
roads are filled with cyclists and walkers, all making their way to an 
otherwise insignificant church in Lo Vásquez to mark the feat of the Immaculate 
Conception. Most people camp overnight, curling up on the hard shoulder, or 
just carry on walking. I stayed a night in a motel in Curacaví, not 
particularly fancying braving the cold concrete alone. If you want to 
understand Chilean culture, meet local people, see the slightly apocalyptic 
sight of bundled-up people huddling together along an empty highway at dawn, 
mark next December in your calendar for a trip to South America.

It was lucky that the bus broke down. By the time a replacement had arrived, 
it was well after sunset and my two backpacker friends and I were 
unceremoniously dropped off on the side of a Sudanese highway. The bus driver 
pointed into the desert and told us to “walk that way”. Ten minutes later we 
saw them; the Pyramids of Meroë. Under the full moon they appeared like tiny 
fingers reaching to the sky. Of course, there was no one around to take the 
entry fee, so we did the only thing one can do in these circumstances and 
jumped the rickety fence that encircled the site. We meandered through the site 
for hours, before breaking to eat the tuna sandwiches we had brought along, our 
sustenance for the evening.

Then we had to think about where to sleep. As far as we knew there was only 
one warm place to sleep in the vicinity and that was inside a pyramid – so 
that’s what we did. After checking for creatures we lay down and eventually 
nodded off.

We slept well on the sands in our low-ceilinged room, a few metres above the 
remains of Nubian royalty. When the sun rose we got back to the highway and 
hitchhiked our way back to the capital before anyone knew we had been there.

We first took our sons backpacking when they were nine and six years old. On 
the first evening of the first trip, in a packed market in Old Delhi, they had 
their hair cut by a young lad in a small shack. They loved it, and ever since, 
whenever we go to a different country, it’s imperative we find a little shack 
or room down a back alley to get that special and cheap cultural experience. 
Preferably, the barber will not speak any English, which only adds to the 
entertainment. I can’t remember one haircut that hasn’t been fun.

The rising foothills of the Gorczański Park are the first sign that you’re 
entering the Polish highlands as you head south on the meandering roads out of 
Krakow. With friends I took a road trip with tents and backpacks for hikes down 
to the timber-clad town of Zakopane and beyond. After this, we went across the 
Slovak border and into the deep valley that cleaves this section of the great 
Carpathians in two: theHigh Tatras 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/sep/05/great-eastern-europe-road-trip-slovakia-high-tatra>
 and the Low Tatras. Shrouded by shadowy thickets of spruce and fir and 
hurtling over countless potholes, we wove our way through the forests that coat 
the borderlands here. Eventually, the precipitous bluff of Orava Castle came 
into view, glinting in the spring sun like something out of Game of Thrones. 
Then came the rolling hills around Ružomberok and the chiselled landscapes of 
the Veľká Fatra. Finally, we came to the high peak of Chopok, and we pulled up 
to don the backpacks and head off to pitch the tents.

The town of Uyuni is very much on the backpackers’ route for those who want to 
see the salt flats (Salar de Uyuni) and stay at the salt hostel. But if you go 
to the town of Tupiza, south of Uyuni, you get a much better experience. I went 
throughTorre Tours 
<http://www.latorretours-tupiza.com/option1-tupiza-uyuni-4days.html>, who 
didn’t charge all that much (for five of us in one jeep it was around $150 – 
bargain). We went for four days and three nights, stopping off at amazing 
places untouched and unseen by the backpackers who set out from the more 
popular Uyuni.

One of my favourite experiences when backpacking came when I visited the Mayan 
city of Calakmul at the very southern edge of Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula. The 
huge site lies at the heart of a biosphere reserve, and is completely covered 
in a sub-tropical jungle full of birds, butterflies and even monkeys. There are 
hundreds of stelae and overgrown ruins to explore, but these are dominated by 
two 50-metre-high pyramids, the tallest Mayan structures in Mexico. You are 
free to climb them, and from the top I found myself looking down on an endless 
sea of trees, punctured only by the tops of the other pyramids. Far from 
Cancun, the site was almost completely deserted, and I felt like Indiana Jones 
as I explored the ruins alone.

Four of us, hardened backpackers from different corners of the world and all 
on tight budgets, planned to visit Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Crater national park. 
We had to go with the cheapest outfit in town and, sure enough, the jeep 
started to make strange noises as we descended into the crater. On the flats, 
with all of Africa’s wildlife around – lions, rhino, elephant, hippos, crocs – 
the vehicle conked out. Our driver didn’t know what to do. Do we get out and 
look at the engine? It felt kind of dangerous to get out with who knows what 
hiding in the bush … An age passed. Maybe “budget” wasn’t such a good idea. 
Then some rangers arrived on the scene, put on a tow and took us to their lodge 
– we had to stay the night in the park (when all other tourists have to leave!) 
camping next to their wooden huts. Next, the kindly rangers invite us on their 
evening 4x4 patrol – all tourists were gone and we could go off-road, stopping 
inches from lions, seeing hippo and being very grateful for our tour operator’s 
clapped-out jeep. The late evening had us sharing whisky and hearing ranger’s 
tales. Camping out included wild animal eyes shining back from torchlight on 
late-night toilet trips, then sunrise and another pre-tourist patrol and rhino 
sightings. So, my tip: sometimes cheapest equals best!

 Fresh Wave Festival, Banja Luka 
Last summer we took the train from Zagreb to Banja Luka, the capital of 
Republika Srpska, an eight-hour trip with loads of stops. But Banja Luka is 
incredible! It was hot and sunny everyday and its river, the Vrbas, is a 
torrent of clean ice-cold water. There are even hot springs to swim in at 
night. The best thing, however, are the people. Many asked, “Why are you here?” 
but were extremely hospitable, friendly and funny. We made many friends just by 
walking down the street speaking English. The region has a bad reputation, 
garnered from the terrible civil war years, but people were non-threatening and 
often wanted to discuss the recent past. On the day we arrived there was an 
electronic music festival calledFresh Wave <http://freshwavefest.com/> held in 
the 500-year-old city castle. It cost €15 for three days and was so friendly; 
people would stop and talk to us and offer usrakija when hearing that we were 
foreign. The contrast between the past, present, young and old of this place 
made it the most incredible backpacking experience I have ever had.

The 650km Rim of Africa trail <http://www.rimofafrica.org/> follows a line of 
intertwined mountain ranges through the Western Cape province of South Africa, 
from north to south, eventually turning east, between the towns of Clanwilliam 
and George. The scenery is epic, and so is the route. Hikers are traversing one 
of the most botanically diverse areas on the planet, and a dazzling variety of 
plants surprises at every turn. Fantastic rock formations, crystal-clear 
streams, and great guides make this an absolutely memorable walk. In full, the 
trail takes about 56 days to complete or it can be done in nine distinct

I was advised by newly made friends to go to Pokhara. It turned out to be a 
great idea and I only wish I had known about it sooner instead of feeling as 
though I was running out of things to do in Kathmandu. My outstanding memory of 
it was a stroll I took along one of the lakes around the city, through a small 
village on stony pathways but among lush green rice fields with women wearing 
cerise saris working in them. As I took a rest on a hilly part of the path I 
saw a tiny man carrying a massive basket filled with freshly plucked and bound 
green rice. He was so small that once he’d passed, all I could see looking back 
was a basket with legs making its way up the hill.
