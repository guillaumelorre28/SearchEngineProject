Winning tip: King of the kippers, Northumberland


Great food need not be expensive. In the tiny fishing port of Craster stands L 
Robson & Sons smokery and restaurant. The family has been smoking fish for 
generations and, though the original “herring girls” have been replaced by 
machinery, the smoking process is unchanged. Boasting that it cures “anything 
that comes from the sea”, its most famous product is the kipper. Accompanied by 
slices of bread and butter and a mug of strong tea, this succulent golden fish 
makes a mouth-watering meal for a mere £8.95.

Rhucello, not limoncello, North Yorkshire

 Market day in Malton 
If you want to sample a liqueur made from rhubarb <http://www.rhucello.co.uk/>
, Yorkshire’s very own alternative to limoncello, or a range of award-winning, 
locally produced wine and food, head to Malton. With a monthly food market, a 
separate farmer’s market, independent shops and producers, a cookery school, 
and two thriving food and drink festivals a year, it is no surprise that this 
lovely market town is fast establishing itself as the food capital of the north.

The Oyster Shed, Isle of Skye

 Photograph: Alamy 
At the top of a winding road on the Isle of Skye, a couple of minutes from the 
Talisker Whisky Distillery 
<https://www.isleofskye.com/attractions/visitor-centre/693-talisker-distillery>
, this little place overlooks Loch Harport and the Cuillin mountains, with 
plenty of seating outdoors (opened and covered) to enjoy the panoramic views. 
The shop sells fresh and smoked produce, including wood pigeon and mallard, but 
the seafood takeaway is the star: pan-fried Hebridean scallops in garlic butter 
for £6.50, lobster tail for £10, and – most importantly – oysters, all with 
chips and lemon wedge in a polystyrene box. The oysters are from the Shed’s 
farm in Loch Harport.

The Milk Churn, Sussex


Who would have thought that cheese on toast could simultaneously taste just 
how your mum made it and how a Michelin-starred chef would cook it for himself 
at the end of a hectic shift? On a walk through Sussex woodland, we discovered 
the Milk Churn in Rudgwick. Run by Bookham Harrison, maker of Sussex Charmer 
cheese, its star is served between doorsteps of white toast, grilled to 
perfection with optional sidekicks like ham or red onion (from £3). If you have 
room (you won’t), there’s also a gorgeous range of homemade cakes.

The Nest, Herefordshire


At Little Verzons Farm near Ledbury is the Nest, a cafe specialising in egg 
dishes and homemade cakes. I started my day with the Nest brunch, a lightly 
poached free-range egg on grilled prosciutto and rocket nest over hot, buttered 
toast. Delicious. There is also a shop selling handmade scotch eggs using 
free-range eggs and bacon. Owners Neil and Penny produce and sell over 40 
different types, including veggie and gluten-free ones. My particular favourite 
is the Scrumpy, with loads of apple, onion and fresh sage.

Beyond barm cakes, Lancashire


Hike, cycle or motor the back roads of rural Lancashire and you’ll come to the 
remote hamlet of Newton-in-Bowland. Its pub, the Parker’s Arms, is the kind of 
hostelry a wayfarer yearns for: flagstone floors, blazing fire and hearty 
reception from AJ, a man born to be a landlord. Chef Stosie is French but the 
ingredients are as local and seasonal as they come – wild garlic soup, river 
Lune salmon and pheasant from surrounding moorland. To follow, try the Wet 
Nelly, a fruity local bread pudding, with a pint of Hen Harrier from Bowland 
Brewery. Two courses, with drink, costs about £25 a head, but every mouthful is 
memorable. It’s a long way from a pie and a barm cake.

The freshest local fish, Norfolk


The White Horse at Brancaster Staithe is on the north Norfolk coast. It has a 
great outside seating area, looking over the sands, and it’s a perfect way to 
spend some time watching and enjoying the freshest local fish.

Pork pies and beer, the Peak District


The Travellers Rest in Apperknowle is a champion at both and has the awards 
from Camra to prove it. The Yorkshire Farmers pork pie with chicken and 
wholegrain mustard is a treat. The food is all locally sourced and cooked to 
perfection. People make the journey for the pork pies and local beers but, in 
addition, there are views all across the edge of the Peak District from this 
cosy watering hole. The proprietor has recently added a tapas-style menu which 
is so good that it may make the pork pies and beer a footnote.

Brig o’Turk – 39 steps to heaven, Trossachs


This tiny, green-painted wooden building on the A821 in the glorious Trossachs 
region opened in 1923 as a meeting point for cyclists and found fame starring 
in the 1959 version of The 39 Steps. Today it deserves an Oscar for its 
imaginative menu. Prices start at £3.90 for delicious, gluten-free soup but 
push the boat out a bit and you can enjoy such gems as wood pigeon salad with 
crispy parsnips and puy lentils.

The perfect pasty, Cornwall


The best Cornish pasty is not to be found on the tourist-laden north coast but 
on the Rame peninsula, the “forgotten corner of Cornwall”, in the south-east of 
the county. Dashers, in Torpoint, makes these substantial delicacies fresh 
every day in three sizes to suit every appetite. Packed full of delicious local 
meat and veg, with crispy pastry, they are extremely moreish.
