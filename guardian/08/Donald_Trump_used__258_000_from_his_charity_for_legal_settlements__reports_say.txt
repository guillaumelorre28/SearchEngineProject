Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> used $258,000 
from his charitable foundation for legal settlements involving his Mar-a-Lago 
resort in Florida and a New York golf course, it was reported on Tuesday.

The Washington Post reported

 that in 2007, Trump used his foundation’s money when his Palm Beach, Florida, 
club was fined $120,000 by the town for having a flagpole that was almost twice 
the height allowed under local rules.

As part of a settlement, Trump donated $125,000 to veterans’ charities from 
the Trump Foundation, the paper reported. The foundation’s money comes mainly 
from other donors, not Trump himself.

The Post reported that in 2010, a golfer sued when he was denied a $1m prize 
for a hole-in-one in a charity tournament at Trump’s course outside New York 
City. A $158,000 settlement also came from Trump’s foundation.

Two weeks ago the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold cast in doubt Trump’s 
philanthropy

 and raised questions about purchases he had made, apparently for himself, 
using money earmarked for charity.

Now Fahrenthold has uncovered what may be

, if there is no unforeseen explanation here (the Trump camp has yet to 
comment), the biggest abuse yet by Trump of tax laws and the trust of donors to 
his foundation.

“Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable 
foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire’s for-profit 
businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents,” 
Fahrentholdreports

Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump’s charity, were among 
four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws 
against “self-dealing” – which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity 
money to benefit themselves or their businesses.

What’s the legal hazard here for Trump? The Post writes:

If the Internal Revenue Service were to find that Trump violated self-dealing 
rules, the agency could require him to pay penalty taxes or to reimburse the 
foundation for all the money it spent on his behalf. Trump is also facing 
scrutiny from the office of the New York attorney general, which is examining 
whether the foundation broke state charity laws ... More broadly, these cases 
also provide new evidence that Trump ran his charity in a way that may have 
violated U.S. tax law and gone against the moral conventions of philanthropy.

“I represent 700 nonprofits a year, and I’ve never encountered anything so 
brazen,” saidJeffrey Tenenbaum <https://www.venable.com/jeffrey-s-tenenbaum/>, 
who advises charities at the Venable law firm in Washington. After The Post 
described the details of these Trump Foundation gifts, Tenenbaum described them 
as “really shocking.”
