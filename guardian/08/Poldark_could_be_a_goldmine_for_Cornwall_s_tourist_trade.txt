Percy Rawlings, an 82-year-old retired engineer who spends his spare time 
leading tours through the damp, cold tunnels ofPoldark Mine 
<http://www.poldarkmine.org.uk>, admits that settling down in front of a 
romantic television costume drama isn’t his normal way of unwinding after a 
tough day underground.


But every Sunday for the next seven weeks Rawlings will join the millions 
tuning in to the BBC’s swashbuckling seriesPoldark 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02jslnf>. “I’ll have to check they do justice 
to Cornwall,” said Rawlings. “They filmed here in this mine so I’d like to see 
how the old place looks. It’s got to be good for Cornwall and especially for 
the mining areas like this that could do with a boost.”

Poldark certainly does seem to be good news for Cornwall. In the wake of last 
weekend’s first glimpse of heart-throb (no other word seems to fit) Ross 
Poldark and the equally handsome landscapes he brooded over, hits onVisit 
Cornwall’s <http://www.visitcornwall.com/>website have soared by 65%. The last 
time they saw such a spike in traffic was when another moody and magnificent 
all-British action hero, sailor Ben Ainslie, trotted through Cornwall carrying 
the Olympic torch three years ago.

Hotels, B&Bs and campsites also report that potential visitors are making sure 
they did not miss the chance to follow in Poldark’s footsteps. Businesses 
ranging from horse-trekking stables – tousle-haired Ross did seem to do an 
awful lot of galloping in episode one – to kayaking companies are plotting 
special Poldark-themed events.

It is also a terrific boost for Visit Cornwall, which has recently had its 
£850,000-a-year council funding pulled. Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, 
said the sort of exposure Poldark had given Cornwall could have a huge impact. 
“The opportunity is there to be seized,” he said. “Poldark looks set to be a 
massive hit and with 12 novels in the series there is potential for it to run 
and run.”

A much-needed fillip for Poldark mine in particular. Originally named Wheal 
Roots, the mine was re-named to cash in on the success of the original and 
much-loved 1970s BBC series. It used to buzz with visitors. Cast members of 
Poldark and the writer of the source books, Winston Graham, would turn up 
regularly for special events.

Recent times have not been so kind. Two years ago the place went into 
administration and there were fears that it could be turned into a housing 
estate. It re-opened last year under new management and survived. But the 
arrival of film crews to film in the mine proved a huge boost.

“They used things like bells and tools from the museum here during the 
filming,” said David Edwards, the new custodian. “They didn’t use our lovely 
original ladders, which are hundreds of years old. I suppose there were 
health-and-safety concerns. I’m hoping that the series will have a profound 
effect on the mine and this whole area.”

A few miles down on the south coast, National Trust ranger Greg Cross was to 
be found overseeing improvement works in the car park at Gunwalloe in 
anticipation of the crowds that will head here to drink in the scene of a 
night-time shipwreck that was filmed here. “We’re expecting big interest,” he 
said. “I must admit I didn’t see it. My girlfriend did – she’s a fan of Aidan 
Turner [who plays Poldark]. I suppose I ought to watch it for homework.”

Cornwall already does rather nicely out of television dramas. The Germans 
flock here when Daphne du Maurier adaptations hit their screens; the 
Antipodeans make Doc Marten pilgrimages to Port Isaac; even the Isles of Scilly 
do pretty well out of Michael Morpurgo’s use of the archipelago in many of his 
books.

But it doesn’t always work. Visit Cornwall braced itself for a boost when the 
BBC screened its version of du Maurier’s Jamaica Inn last year. It never 
happened. Poldark, however, looks like a winner.

The real Poldark country is, arguably, a section of the north coast, where at 
St Agnes the mining buildings and chimneys cling to the rocky coast. Koru 
Kayaking <http://korukayaking.co.uk/exploring-poldark-country/> is offering 
Poldark paddles around St Agnes Head, though so far canoeing has not featured 
in the re-make, but Koru argues their tours give a “unique perspective” of 
Poldark-world. Tom and Hetty Wildblood, who run Koru, insist they are not 
bandwagon-jumpers. They watched the whole of the original series when they 
moved to Cornwall in 2012 and called their Land Rover Demelza, after the earthy 
servant girl Poldark champions.

But there is a little dissent. Jane Bellamy, who was walking along the coastal 
path, was not overly impressed by the opening episode. “It seemed to me a lot 
of racing around on horses and not a lot else. Not my thing. The scenery was 
lovely and I suppose it will bring more visitors in but we’re pretty packed as 
it is around here anyway.”

Stained glass maker Ian Hamilton said he got a bit bored with Ross Poldark 
smouldering away. “I’d rather watch Top Gear frankly.” Hardly a backlash – but 
a reminder that not absolutely everyone is a fan of the Poldark brand of Sunday 
night drama.

And not all places are leaping on to the bandwagon as swiftly as they might be.

Tracey Pooley, landlady of the Poldark Inn at Delabole – another place that 
changed its name following the success of the original series – said she had 
tried but so far failed to encourage her staff into breeches and bodices.

“I haven’t had much luck so far but it’s got to happen. People keep telling me 
that I’ve got to cash in. I’ll have to get some memorabilia in.”
