The Museum of London has launched a Great Fire of London website 
<http://www.fireoflondon.org.uk/story/the-fire/> to mark the 350th anniversary 
of the blaze, tracking the course of the fire that broke out in the small hours 
of 2 September 1666, and over four days tore the heart out of the medieval city.

brings together interactive maps as well as images and information from 11 
partners, including the museum’s own collections, the Guildhall art gallery and 
theLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> Metropolitan Archives.

It includes key objects bearing witness to the intensity of the blaze, such as 
melted window glass found by archaeologists on a site only a few yards from 
where the fire started, in a bakery on Pudding Lane.

A handful of people, perhaps as few as six, died in the fire, but the site 
reminds users of earlier disasters, including a devastating fire in Southwark 
in 1212 in which about 3,000 people are said to have burned to death or drowned 
by jumping into the Thames, after London Bridge caught fire and cut off their 
escape route.

The remedies incorporated ingredients including horse manure – from animals 
raised “at grasse” only, the prescription stressed – onions, chicken droppings, 
and a mixture of boiled mutton fat and butter.

 The physicians are now based in a modernist 1960s building in Regent’s Park, 
designed by Sir Denys Lasdun, but in 1666 had to be rehoused in a new building 
designed by Robert Hooke after their medieval headquarters in the shadow of St 
Paul’s Cathedral was burned to the ground. Some of their silver, books and 
paintings that were rescued, many scarred and scorched, will also be on display.
