 into a range of Russian hacking attacks, but promised there would be a 
response.

 “I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact 
the integrity of our elections … we need to take action,” Obama said. “And we 
will – at a time and place of our own choosing.

“Some of it may be explicit and publicised; some of it may not be.”

 The CIA has judged that the Russian cyber attacks, including the hacking of 
emails from the Democratic National Committee, were intended to influence the 
electionin Donald Trump’s favour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/10/cia-concludes-russia-interfered-to-help-trump-win-election-report>
, according to reports. The FBI agrees that there was Russian hacking but has 
not as yet concluded it was intended to favour the Republican contender.

Senators from both parties have called for a congressional enquiry, while 
Trump himself hasrejected the reports 
<http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/trump-rejects-cia-russia-hacking-report/> and 
his office has derided the CIA.

Trump weighed in on Twitter to ask if it was the “same cyberattack where it 
was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the 
debate?” One of the hacked emails, from interim DNC head Donna Brazile, said 
that a woman from Flint, Michigan,would ask at a primary debate with Bernie 
Sanders

 what Clinton would do as president to help people in the town suffering from a 
lead-contaminated water supply.

Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of 
the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?

He earlier tweeted: 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/809403760099422208> “If Russia, or 
some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? 
Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?”

In fact, the intelligence community had issued its statement on 7 October 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election>
, a full month before polling day.

 Obama said he would reserve judgment on Moscow’s intentions pending a final 
report but he said the impact of the intervention was clear. The debate over 
motivation, he said “does not in any way, I think, detract from the basic point 
that everyone during the election perceived accurately – that in fact what the 
Russian hack had done was create more problems for the Clinton campaign than it 
had for the Trump campaign”.

He added: “There’s no doubt that it contributed to an atmosphere in which the 
only focus for weeks at a time, months at a time wereHillary’s emails 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/hillary-clinton-latest-emails-explained>

.”

 The president did not attempt to gauge the full impact of the intervention, 
but insisted it had had an effect.

 “Elections can always turn out differently,” he said. “You never know which 
factors are going to make a difference. But I have no doubt that it had some 
impact, just based on the coverage.”

In the NPR interview, Obama expressed incredulity at Republican party support 
for Trump’s foreign policy positions, which have been uniformly supportive of 
Russian presidentVladimir Putin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin>.

 “This is somebody, the former head of the KGB, who is responsible for 
crushing democracy in Russia, muzzling the press, throwing political dissidents 
in jail, countering American efforts to expand freedom at every turn; is 
currentlymaking decisions that’s leading to a slaughter in Syria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/uk-and-us-ramp-up-criticism-of-russia-and-iran-over-aleppo-crisis>
,” the outgoing president said.

“And a big chunk of the Republican party, which prided itself during the 
Reagan era and for decades that followed as being the bulwark against Russian 
influence, now suddenly is embracing him.”

Earlier on Thursday, the White House went its furthest yet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/white-house-putin-russia-hacking-us-election-trump>
 in joining the dots between Trump and Putin.


Press secretary Josh Earnest pointed reporters to a unanimous statement 
<https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement>
 from all 17 intelligence agencies, issued in October, that found “only 
Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities”.

The press secretary said that in his personal view, that sentence was “not 
intended to be subtle”, adding that it was “pretty obvious that they were 
referring to the senior-most government official in Russia”.

Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser for strategic 
communications, agreed. “I don’t think things happen in the Russian government 
of this consequence without Vladimir Putin knowing about it,” he told MSNBC.

But Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told state TV channel Rossiya-24 he 
was “dumbstruck” by the reports of Putin’s alleged involvement. “I think this 
is just silly, and the futility of the attempt to convince somebody of this is 
absolutely obvious,” he said.

Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday of the hacking accusation that 
the US should “either stop talking about it or finally produce some evidence, 
otherwise it all begins to look unseemly”.

The White House said Obama would hold a press conference in Washington on 
Friday at 2.15pm ET (7.15pm GMT) before leaving for his annual family vacation 
in Hawaii.
