Celebrity <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/celebrity> memorabilia is 
huge business in the auction rooms of London, New York and Los Angeles. But a 
Cornish cafe is getting in on the act by selling off leftovers that remained on 
the plates of famous visitors.

Among the goodies being sold by the Old Boatstore 
<http://www.theoldboatstore.co.uk/museumofcel.html> in Kingsand are:

• A small lump of bread pudding left over by Prince Charles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-charles>, valued at £300.

• A crust from a cheese and tomato sandwich left by photographer David Bailey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/david-bailey>, for £100.

• A shell fragment from egg in a sandwich eaten by comedian Hugh Dennis, for 
£100.

• A small uneaten piece of lemon drizzle cake left by film director and 
restaurant critic Michael Winner, for £100.

• A single blackcurrant from a bowl of ice cream left by swimmer Sharron 
Davies, for £100.

The so-called Museum of Celebrity Leftovers was created by Michael and 
Francesca Bennett, who say the collection began in 2004 when David Bailey 
dropped in and left a crust.

They now have more than 20 exhibits stored in airtight jars and want whoever 
buys the cafe to take them on, too. The money made from selling off the 
leftovers is to go to charity.

Francesca Bennett said: "We were so chuffed that David Bailey came in we kept 
part of his sandwich as a joke. It just grew from that.

"It's so quiet here, it's really surprising that so many famous people should 
turn up in such a small village."

The exhibits are not preserved but are not showing signs of going mouldy, she 
said. "They just seem to be drying out, really."
