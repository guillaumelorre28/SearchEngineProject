Blame is the first novel I’ve written without the prop of the periodic table 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/periodic-table>. For my children’s series, 
Itch, whenever I needed inspiration for a plot twist, a vicious poison or a 
cunning escape, I could find it inDmitri Mendeleev 
<http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/resources/periodictable/pre16/develop/mendeleev.htm>
’s iconic arrangement of the elements. But that was before and this is after.

Blame is set in the future and focuses on Ant and Mattie, a sister and brother 
who live in prison with their foster parents. They are “heritage criminals”, 
locked up in Spike, the family annexe of the new prison HMP London. Heritage 
crime decrees that we are responsible for any unpunished crimes committed by 
our parents and grandparents. It is a nightmarish, reactionary – and very 
popular – charge.

I blame Michael Morpurgo for Blame. When he was compiling Only Remembered 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/01/michael-morpurgo-only-remembered-first-world-war-memories>
, a book of first world war stories, I contributed a chapter about my great 
uncle, Stanley Killingback, who was killed in 1916. It was a short piece, only 
a few hundred words, but I was writing for one of our greatest authors so each 
one needed to count. I sent it off and believed that was that. But – and please 
don’t snort in derision – that night I had a dream. I was in a queue, waiting 
to be admitted to prison. It had been discovered that my great uncle had been a 
deserter (he wasn’t), a crime that had gone unpunished, meaning I had to pay 
the price. Everyone in line with me was similarly convicted. It was a haunting, 
oppressive image and it lingered long into the day. My wife said I should write 
it down and so I did. Blame is the result.

Blame is set in a post-EU world. A terrifying recession has ripped its way 
through most countries and everyone is looking for someone to blame. Many 
heritage criminals have had a good life, having “got away with it” without 
paying back to society what they owe. Locking up families has proved popular – 
everywhere except for Germany, which refuses to play the blame game again. So, 
for the resistance groups in Blame, German becomes the language of freedom. My 
prison is full of slang, some invented, some real. (There is enough to fill a 
glossary at the beginning of the book.)

Some things change in the course of a writing a book, others stay the same. 
Ant (real name Abigail Norton Turner) was always clear to me. She was always 
biracial, she always had a shaved head, always had goose tattoos. She was 
always tricksy, angry and fierce but she was also loyal, brave and passionate. 
Her anger was righteous, a cold fury that could terrify at 20 paces. She might 
annoy you, she might scare you but you would definitely want Ant on your side.

Extract

Ant screamed – a wailing banshee howl that made the whole platform stop and 
look. Those who could see her backed off as far as possible, and she screamed 
again. As this shriek was delivered to a near-silent station, the effect was 
dramatic.

A path cleared for her and she ran, taking the steps in enormous leaps. Where 
new crowds threatened her progress, she screamed again. Steps, escalator, 
sprint, Ant flew towards the Piccadilly line. In the enclosed walkways that 
linked the underground system, her yells and threats bounced off the tiled 
walls.

The platform was busy with the usual number of construction workers – all with 
their tell-tale prison security passes still visible – but she could still 
choose her spot. If she stood by that poster, she would be right outside the 
lifts at the next station.

She knew the poster well. It showed a troubled-looking man in an armchair 
being questioned by his two young children. The caption read: ‘Daddy, what did 
our family do before the Depression?’ It then dissolved into a smiling suited 
man holding up a pledge card. Underneath a bold ‘Your past is your future!’ 
were the five ‘Freedom Questions’.

Ant knew them by heart:

What have you done today?
Have you talked to your parents?
What have you inherited?
What are you passing on to your children?
Is your family now, or has it ever been, a criminal family?

If the ad hasn’t been on the wrong side of the tracks, she’d have thrown 
something at it.

More about the book

First of all, this book is incredibly detailed, which is similar to how Simon 
wrote the Itch books; there’s a lot of detail, so much so you can picture 
scenes with barely any doubt as to what a certain detail is supposed to look 
like. This helps you build a real sense of emotion and empathy with the 
characters, this may not be for everyone, but I think a lot of people will like 
it.

Ant and Mattie are really amazing characters too. They’re described well and 
we get to know their personalities. The book is written in the third person, 
which I think makes it a little more impressive. At the same time, you’d expect 
to learn a lot about the characters in first person but there is a lot of 
attention given to describing the characters in detail. Every trait in the 
character is explored.– confessionsofabooklover, teen reviewer
