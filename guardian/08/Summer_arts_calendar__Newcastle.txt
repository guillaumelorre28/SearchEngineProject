Evolution Festival, 28-29 May 

Newcastle isn't a city famed for its large-scale music festivals, but this 
summer the spotlight will firmly be on Tyneside. Evolution will kick things off 
with a carnival of music and special events over two days on the banks of the 
Tyne. Plan B, Tinie Tempah and rock legends Iggy Pop and the Stooges are on the 
line-up for this year's weekender. The cream of the region's up and coming 
musical crop will also take over the neighbouring Ouseburn Valley as part of 
Evolution Emerging and the Happy Mondays' Shaun Ryder will DJ at the Riverside 
on Sunday at the after show house party.

Newcastle Community Green Festival, 4-5 June

Now entering its 16th year, the Newcastle Community Green festival follows the 
UN World Environment Week, and this year organisers promise to make it the most 
interactive and family-friendly festival they've had. There's a wide range of 
music across four renewably powered stages, a kids area, circus area and 
workshops on how to become a little greener. The community vibe among the 
10,000 people filling up Leazes Park makes it one of the friendliest places to 
feel guilty about taking the car in to town that day.

streets of Newcastle on Saturday 4 June, ushering in five weeks of live Latin 
American music, food and film. The festival will feature Lucha Libre Mexican

EAT! Festival, 17-26 June

Now in its fifth year, EAT! Festival aims to "advocate all the pleasures of 
creating and sharing good food and drink in the North East". EAT! has built up 
a solid reputation as a food festival like no other, encouraging food 
aficionados and those who think a Greggs pasty is a culinary high to come 
together and enjoy food in a friendly environment. Highlights include a street 
food festival, 10 Things To Eat Before You Die, and Eat-a-long Movies – where 
student chefs will recreate the dishes from foodie movies while you watch on 
screen: Mexican dishes will be served with Like Water For Chocolate and French 
with Julie and Julia. With more than 50 events, it's worth looking at the full 
programme.

Following a sell out run at Newcastle's Live Theatre, Pitmen Painters went on 
to enjoy success on a national tour plus a stint in New York. But now it's 
returning home to play at the Journal Tyne. Adapted from a book by William 
Feaver and written by Lee Hall of Billy Elliot fame, the story revolves around 
a group of miners enrolling in an art appreciation class in 1930s industrial 
Ashington. Within a matter of years, the miners had the art world chattering 
with their creations, and this touching and often hilarious show is, as the 
Guardian said, "breathtaking in its scope".
