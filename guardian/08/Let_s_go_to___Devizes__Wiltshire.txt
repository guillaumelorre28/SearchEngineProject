Tell me about it
 Once a prosperous market town, Devizes is now a place most people drive past 
on their way elsewhere. But with a new boutique hotel and Stonehenge’s swanky 
visitor centre a short drive away, it’s worthy of a weekend break. Check out 
the handsome Georgian market square (it’s still market day on Thursdays) and 
medieval cobbled alleyways, and join a cracking brewery tour.Wadworth 
<http://www.wadworth.co.uk/home> employs England’s last master cooper, and 
still delivers its beer around town by shire horse and dray.

Sounds like I’ll need a sample
You’re spoilt for choice. Join the Devizes Folk Club at the Lamb 
<http://www.thelambdevizes.co.uk/> on St John’s Street for a pint of Wadworth’s 
6X and some live music; or tryThe Vaults <http://thevaultsdevizes.com/>, just 
up the road, which serves the largest choice of beers in town.

Might want to line the stomach first … 
Tuck into Peter Vaughan’s delicious food (homemade spelt bread, grilled fish 
and mousseline of local Bromham carrots, say) atThe Bistro on Little Brittox 
<http://www.thebistrodevizes.co.uk/>, which is also a cooking school.

Anywhere to stay under £100?
The Peppermill <http://www.peppermilldevizes.co.uk/>, above the wine bar and 
cafe of the same name, also on St John’s Street, is the town’s first boutique 
property and just breaks the budget at £115 for a double, but you should sleep 
soundly on Hypnos cashmere beds, and feel cosy thanks to the big bathtub and 
underfloor heating. TheCastle Hotel <http://castlehoteldevizes.co.uk/>, an old 
coaching inn, has doubles from £85.

Anything else I should know? 
It’s 15 miles to Stonehenge but Avebury (many people’s preference) is eight 
miles up the road. Here, the prehistoric stones surround a cute village with a 
thatched pub, and you can wander at will and even touch the stones.

Do I need a car?
 Ideally. Otherwise it’s a train to Swindon or Chippenham with First Great 
Western, then a bus.
