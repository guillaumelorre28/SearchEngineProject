A debut novel about inherited identity, a dystopian fantasy from a former 
children’s laureate, a study of Indian healthcare and radical history of black 
Britain have all been lined up to contend for a new British book prize 
exclusively for writers of colour.

Chasing the Stars by Malorie Blackman heads a 12-strong longlist for the 
Jhalak prize for book of the year by a writer of colour 
<https://mediadiversified.org/about-us/the-jhalak-prize/>. The prize was 
launched to improve the poor representation of writers from culturally diverse 
backgrounds and mixes fiction, nonfiction and children’s literature.

Blackman’s novel is the latest dystopian fantasy by the former children’s 
laureate. Writing in the Guardian, Tony Bradman declared: “Never before have I 
come across a book that’s a combination of Star Trek, 10 Things I Hate About 
You and a murder mystery. What’s not to like?”

At the other end of the spectrum from Blackman’s edge-of-the-seat adventure is 
Bafta award-winning broadcaster and historian David Olusoga, whose Black and 
British: A Forgotten History, is a radical reappraisal of the parameters of 
history and the relationship between Britain and Africa. The book was tied to a 
high-profile BBC TV series.Writing in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/30/what-it-means-to-be-black-in-britain-today>
, Olusoga said he was inspired to explore the forgotten history of Britain’s 
black community by his own upbringing on a council estate in the north-east of 
England. “My right, not just to regard myself as a British citizen, but even to 
be in Britain, seemed contested,” he said.

Sunny Singh, co-founder of the prize and chair of judges, said: “The first 
ever Jhalak prize longlist demonstrates the strength, range and promise being 
produced by writers of colour in the UK today.”

Poet and broadcaster Musa Okwonga, who is also on the judging panel, said: 
“This is easily some of the most compelling work that I have seen in several 
years.”

The longlist features three other YA titles alongside Blackman’s novel: Nina 
Is Not OK by Shappi Khorsandi; Orangeboy by Patrice Lawrence; and The Girl of 
Ink and Stars by Kiran Millwood Hargrave.

The settings of the longlisted books span the globe. Rowan Hisayo Buchanan’s 
at times harrowing novel Harmless Like You, which examines inherited identity, 
travels from New York to Berlin. Arathi Prasad’s In the Bonesetter’s Waiting 
Room explores the intersection between traditional and conventional medicine in 
India, while Irenosen Okojie’s short-story collection Speak Gigantular ranges 
from the ghosts of the London Underground to lovelorn aliens in outer space.



Two weeks before submissions closed, Singh was alarmed that only 51 books had 
been put up for the award 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/19/bame-prize-slams-uk-publishers-sunny-singh-jhalak-diversity-britain>
, with little interest from major publishers. In the end, explained co-founder 
Nikesh Shukla, the picture had improved somewhat, with 121 entries. “This is 
all very rough but … 30% were from small presses, 29% from independents, 28% 
from the big guys and 16% self-published.

“It feels like change is coming, slowly. This means that next year I imagine 
we’ll start to see much more submissions.”

The Jhalak was launched following publication in 2015 of Writing the Future 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/15/report-books-world-ethnic-minorities-london-book-fair>
, a damning report from writers’ development agency Spread the Word about BAME 
representation in UK publishing. Open to any published writer of colour in the 
UK regardless of genre, both fiction and nonfiction, the prize is also open to 
self-published writers, although none have made it to the longlist.

Also longlisted are: Gary Younge for Another Day in the Death of America; 
Jacob Ross for The Bone Readers; Kei Miller for Augustown and A Rising Man by 
Abir Mukherjee. The shortlist for the prize will be announced on 6 February, 
with the winner revealed in March.

The field of dedicated literary prizes for minority authors is very small, but 
the Jhalak joins an award for unpublished fiction by black and Asian women, the 
SI Leeds literary prize, inaugurated in 2012. The 2016 winner wasAmita Murray 
for Marmite and Mango Chutney
