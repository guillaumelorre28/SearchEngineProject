We’re going to wrap up our live-blog coverage for the day. Here’s a summary of 
where things stand:

 *  Trump continued to meet with potential administration picks at Trump 
Tower. No new picks were announced. 
 * Trump aide Kellyanne Conway said that more Trump picks would be announced 
“soon” and “could come this week.” 
 * A possible homeland security pick, Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach, 
was photographed at the weekend going into a meeting with Trump carrying 
exposed documents that described plans to question “high-risk” immigrants about 
sharia law and the constitution. 
 * A spokesman for Argentinian president Mauricio Macri denied local reports 
that Trump had spoken with Macri about a Trump business project. Macri said he 
also spoke with Ivanka Trump – but again, not about business, his spokesman 
said. 
 * “I’m very confident he is not breaking any laws. He has various lawyers, 
accountants and advisers who tell him what he must do and what he can,” Conway 
said of Trump. 
 * A federal court in Wisconsin ruled that the Republican-controlled 
legislature had engaged in unconstitutional gerrymandering in a 2011 
redistricting. The court deferred on recommending a remedy. Facebook

Macri spokesman denies talking business with Ivanka Trump

An update now to that last block: Uki Goñi in Buenos Aires has spoken with 
Macri spokesman Iván Pavlovsky who said that the Argentinian president did not 
speak about Trump real estate developments with Ivanka Trump, either.

“He spoke with Ivanka only briefly, to say hello, because he met her when she 
was just a kid. They did not speak about it. The president doesn’t speak about 
city building permits,” Pavlovsky told the Guardian.

Ivanka Trump spoke with Argentinian president – report

Earlier this hour we published a report by Uki Goñi for the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/mauricio-macri-donald-trump-buenos-aires-office>
 that a spokesman for Argentina’s president has denied thatDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> asked for a business favour 
in their first phone call after Trump was elected president.

We would now highlight a separate passage from the report: Ivanka Trump spoke 
on the call with president Mauricia Macri, Macri told 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/mauricio-macri-donald-trump-buenos-aires-office>
 a Japanese newspaper:

But despite such setbacks, the relationship remains close enough that 
President Macri spoke with Ivanka Trump during last Monday’s phone 
conversation. “In the call, I also talked with his daughter,” Macri told the 
Japanese newspaper the Asahi Shimbun. “I have known her since her infant days.”

Ivanka Trump’s role in her father’s transition and presidency have attracted 
controversy because Trump has said he will avoid conflicts of interest in his 
business dealings while president by turning his companies over to his children.

A safeguard that does not work as well if his elder daughter Ivanka is in the 
room for top-level meetings, as she was when Trump met with Japanese prime 
minister Shinzo Abe last week, or if she is sitting next to Trump when he gets 
off the phone with a foreign leader so that she may take the call.

New York City is going to be looking to the federal government to defray costs 
of protectingDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> – 
which run $1m a day, CNN reports – and, after Trump moves to the White House, 
of protecting Melania and Barron Trump, who will stay in the city until the boy 
finishes the school year.

The CNN report 
<http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/21/news/protecting-donald-trump/index.html> 
quotes mayor Bill de Blasio:

“The number one imperative here is safety and security. We owe that to the 
president elect, his family and his team,” said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio 
at a press conference on Friday. But he added the city will need help with 
those costs, particularly police overtime.

“This is a very substantial undertaking. It will take substantial resources,” 
he said. “We will begin the conversation with the federal government shortly on 
reimbursement for the NYPD for some of the costs that we are incurring.”

Trump did not ask Argentina's president for business favor, spokesman says

Uki Goñi

A spokesman for Argentina’s president has denied that Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> asked for a business favour 
when Mauricio Macri called the US president-elect to congratulate him on his 
victory.


Local media reports have alleged that Trump asked Macri for help over a 
stalled construction permit for a 35-storey project called Trump Office in 
downtown Buenos Aires. A source told the Guardian that the information came 
from Macri’s staff.

“Trump asked him to authorize a building he’s constructing in Buenos Aires – 
it wasn’t just geopolitical chat,” said journalist Jorge Lanata on his Sunday 
night news programme, Periodismo Para Todos.

According the programme, the Buenos Aires building project became bogged down 
in bureaucratic red tape earlier this year, and was raised by Trump during the 
telephone call last week.

“Macri told Trump that Argentina is welcoming foreign investment now, and 
Trump replied that he has a $150m investment inArgentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina> stalled because of a building 
permit in Buenos Aires,” journalist Romina Manguel, who described the alleged 
conversation on the programme, told the Guardian.

Macri’s spokesman Iván Pavlovsky denied the report. “Macri did not speak to 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> about the 
building of the tower,” he said. “They only talked about continuing the 
relationship between the two countries and recalled their personal relationship 
from years ago.”

Federal court rules 2011 Wisconsin gerrymander unconstitutional

The US district court for the western district of Wisconsin has ruled in 
agreement with a plaintiff’s allegation that “the redistricting plan enacted by 
the Wisconsin legislature in 2011 constitutes an unconstitutional partisan 
gerrymander.”

From the ruling <http://wispolitics.com/1006/161121Ruling.pdf>:

We find that Act 43 was intended to burden the representational rights of 
Democratic voters throughout the decennial period by impeding their ability to 
translate their votes into legislative seats. Moreover, as demonstrated by the 
results of the 2012 and 2014 elections, among other evidence, we conclude that 
Act 43 has had its intended effect. Finally, we find that the discriminatory 
effect is not explained by the political geography of Wisconsin nor is it 
justified by a legitimate state interest. Consequently, Act 43 constitutes an 
unconstitutional political gerrymander.

Greg Neumann (@gneumann_wkow) 
Holy moly. #WKOW <https://twitter.com/hashtag/WKOW?src=hash> 
MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Federal court: Wisconsin's Republican-drawn 
redistricting maps are unconstitutional.
 <https://twitter.com/gneumann_wkow/status/800797751046852608> November 21, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/gneumann_wkow/status/800797751046852608> 
The ruling defers for the time being on a remedy:

We defer, at this time, a ruling on the appropriate remedy. The parties have 
not had an opportunity to brief fully the timing and propriety of remedial 
measures. We therefore order briefing on the appropriate remedy according to 
the following schedule:

1. The parties shall file simultaneous briefs on the nature and timing of all 
appropriate remedial measures in 30 days’ time; 2. Simultaneous response briefs 
are due 15 days thereafter.

The parties will provide the court with all evidentiary and legal support they 
believe is required for the court to make its ruling. If the parties do not 
believe that the court can rule on the appropriate remedy without the benefit 
of additional testimony, they should inform the court of the nature and extent 
of the testimony they believe is required.

Conway: new Trump appointments 'could come this week'

The Trump transition pool has just sent over a summary of a conversation in 
Trump hotel lobby just then withTrump aide Kellyanne Conway. Here are sections 
of the Q&A:

Q: Will Trump hold a news conference?

A: Soon but he just has action-packed days filled with meetings. These days 
are overscheduled with meetings. We have people coming in from all over the 
country meeting with him to give their advice, their counsel, their experience, 
their vision for the country. Some of which will result in appointments to his 
administration and some just wish to be helpful. Very excited to have new 
leadership in the country.

Q: Why is Trump meeting with Democratic representative Tulsi Gabbard?

A: A lot of common ground. I think they both understood the country very well. 
Rep. Gabbard went against her party quite boldly early on. I think you are 
hearing people like Rep. Tim Ryan also raising concerns. Bernie Sanders today 
was also quoted as saying they should stop identity politics in the Democratic 
Party. Whoa. He can call and we’ll tell him how to do that and win. So I think 
there’s a recognition that there’s a big country, a massive amount of voters 
that feel disaffected from their party, the Democrats.

Lucas Jackson/Reuters 
Q: What was the meeting with TV executives and news presenters about?

A: There was no need to mend fences. It was off-the-record meeting. It was 
very cordial, very productive, very congenial. It was also very candid and very 
honest. From my own perspective, it’s great to hit the reset button. It was a 
long hard-fought campaign.Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> proved that he animated 
America. He understood America and now he will be the president of all 
Americans.


Q: When will positions be announced?

A: It could come this week. It could come today but we’re not in a rush to 
publish names just because everybody is looking for the next story 
respectfully. You have got to get it right. We know we are ahead of schedule 
when you compare to previous presidents-elect.


Q: What about Americans who are afraid Trump will spread division and stoke 
bigotry and hatred – and demonstrations of hate since his election?

A: He has addressed it many times. He’s told people to cut it out. He said 
that it on 60 Minutes in front of 32 million people. He’ll be the president for 
all Americans. But honestly he respectfully he can use your help in that. The 
election is over. A lot of Americans are having a hard time accepting the 
results of the election...I think it’s incumbent upon all of, the Trump team, 
certainly the press, and others, the Democratic party, in following President 
Obama’s lead, following Vice President’s lead...in telling Americans this is 
your president, this is your vice president-elect, you should respect them and 
work with them.


Q: Do Trump’s business entanglements represent a conflict of interest?

A: I’m very confident he is not breaking any laws. He has various lawyers, 
accountants and advisers who tell him what he must do and what he can. He’s a 
businessman, he’s also working on transition. He’s the president elect. We’re 
in unprecedented times. We have someone who has been very successful....


Q: All Trump’s appointees so far are white men – will there be any diversity 
in the Trump administration?

A: His nominees so far have been all qualified to do the job they’re being 
asked to do. (CROSSTALK) In addition to that, or apart from that I should say, 
the first criteria to of course fill is everyone be qualified and capable to do 
the job that they’ve been asked to do. Secondly they support his agenda, which 
he’s been very straight forward about his first 100 days. And thirdly that they 
represent, his policies represent America.

And he is interviewing many different people but you can’t sacrifice the first 
criteria by tearing from the other ones...

Sessions accused of racial slur in 1981

Jon Swaine

Donald Trump’s nominee for US attorney general 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/18/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-trump-cabinet>
 was once accused of calling a black official in Alabama a “nigger”, and then 
gave a false explanation to the US Senate when testifying about the allegation.

Senator Jeff Sessions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/18/jeff-sessions-trump-attorney-general-criminal-justice-reform>
 was said to have used the racist term in November 1981, when talking about the 
first black man to be elected as a county commissioner in Mobile, where 
Sessions was a Republican party official and a federal prosecutor.

Asked about the alleged remark five years later, during Senate hearings on his 
ill-fated nomination by President Ronald Reagan for a federal judgeship, 
Sessions denied saying it and claimed the alleged timing did not stand up to 
scrutiny.

“My point is there was not a black county commissioner at that time,” Sessions 
said, in response to questions from Joe Biden, then a senator for Delaware. 
“The black was only elected later.”

But this was not true. Public records show Douglas Wicks had become the first 
black person elected to one of Mobile’s three county commission seats in 
September 1980 – more than a year before Sessions allegedly referred to him 
using the racist term.

State official flashes plan for new government interrogation and surveillance

Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach, an immigration hard-liner, flashed a 
written plan to question “high-risk” immigrants over support for Sharia law and 
the US Constitution as he entered a meeting withDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> at the weekend.

It has not been publicly announced whether Kobach is in the running for 
homeland security secretary or any other position. Trump’s promise to carry out 
“extreme vetting” of immigrants has raised a red flag for civil liberties 
advocates and defenders of a certain idea of the USA while beingcheered 
<http://www.nationalreview.com/article/438536/immigration-religious-test-constitution-does-not-ban-vetting-immigrants-religion>
 by analysts who dispute that the constitution’s ban on religious tests applies 
to immigration.

The scoop is from the Topeka, Kansas, Capital-Journal 
<http://cjonline.com/news/2016-11-21/kobach-took-plan-department-homeland-security-trump-meeting>
:

An Associated Press photographer shot an image of Kobach going into the 
meeting and clutching a binder along with a stack of papers. One page is 
visible and readable, though partly obscured by Kobach’s hand.

The document is arranged in a numbered format. The first point reads, “Bar the 
Entry of Potential Terrorists.”

The document calls for updating and reintroducing the National Security 
Entry-Exit Registration System. The program was implemented in the wake of the 
9/11 attacks, but largely suspended in 2011.

“All aliens from high-risk areas are tracked,” the document reads.

The advent of the kind of systems suggested in the Kobach document could be 
subject to abuse, with the government conceivably waylaying or arresting 
–anyone?– in border areas and tracking – anyone? – inside the country, perhaps 
depending on the government’s (probably secret?) definition of “high-risk 
areas”.

Will Kobach get the nod? The homeland security nominee will require senate 
confirmation.

Senator John McCain, who is to remain chairman of the senate armed services 
committee, which would hold hearings on the confirmation of Trump’s defense 
secretary nominee, has again voiced support forgeneral James “Mad Dog” Mattis, 
who is not yet a nominee but who was praised by Trump after a weekend meeting.

Mattis, potential Trump SecDef, 'one of the finest military officers of his

Mattis, 66, a four-star Marine corps general, has relatively recent combat 
experience in both Afghanistan and Iraq, where he was part of the team that led 
the 2004 battle for control of the Iraqi city of Fallujah. (Mattis, who retired 
four years ago, was not on the scene for thebattle to re-take Fallujah

<http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/01/18/the-obama-administrations-inexplicable-mishandling-of-marine-gen-james-mattis-2/>
 from his final military post, as head of US central command, after policy 
clashes with the Obama White House, whose nuclear deal with Iran Mattis has 
vehemently criticized.

Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!

6.39pm GMT 18:39  <> 

The media pool covering the Trump transition has encountered former senator 
Scott Brown and Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin following their meetings in Trump 
tower.

Also spotted: former Texas governor Rick Perry, leaving the building just 
after noon without speaking with reporters.
Additionally spotted: TV executives and on-air personality including:

NBC’s Deborah Turness

CNN’s Jeff Zucker and Wolf Blitzer

FOX’s Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy and Jay Wallace and Suzanne Scott

CBS’s John Dickerson and Charlie Rose

Fallin said “we are very, very excited for this administration,” adding that 
she “was not offered a position.”

“It was just an initial meeting to discuss a wide range of topics,” Fallin 
said.

Brown spoke at length about challenges facing the veterans administration, and 
said he thought he was the “best person” for the job.


Brown said the VA post was the “toughest job in the cabinet” owing to the 
importance of caring for veterans and systemic problems plaguing the agency.


“He’s obviously going to take my application, or interest, under 
consideration,” Brown said. “I’m glad that he called. He’s going to obviously 
meet other folks, and we should know, I would think, probably after 
Thanksgiving.”


Brown continued:

I’m not competing with anybody. I think I’m the best person, but there are 
some tremendous people out there and I don’t look at it as a competition. 
Anybody who takes that job, which I believe is the toughest job in the cabinet 
– because it has so many problems in that it’s so visible, and that people’s 
lives are depending on whether you do it right or wrong. I think as the 
president-elect said, it’s his highest priority, and that’s why the veterans 
came out so strongly for him.

We’re going to wrap up our live-blog coverage for the day. Here’s a summary of 
where things stand:

 *  Trump continued to meet with potential administration picks at Trump 
Tower. No new picks were announced. 
 * Trump aide Kellyanne Conway said that more Trump picks would be announced 
“soon” and “could come this week.” 
 * A possible homeland security pick, Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach, 
was photographed at the weekend going into a meeting with Trump carrying 
exposed documents that described plans to question “high-risk” immigrants about 
sharia law and the constitution. 
 * A spokesman for Argentinian president Mauricio Macri denied local reports 
that Trump had spoken with Macri about a Trump business project. Macri said he 
also spoke with Ivanka Trump – but again, not about business, his spokesman 
said. 
 * “I’m very confident he is not breaking any laws. He has various lawyers, 
accountants and advisers who tell him what he must do and what he can,” Conway 
said of Trump. 
 * A federal court in Wisconsin ruled that the Republican-controlled 
legislature had engaged in unconstitutional gerrymandering in a 2011 
redistricting. The court deferred on recommending a remedy.  
An update now to that last block: Uki Goñi in Buenos Aires has spoken with 
Macri spokesman Iván Pavlovsky who said that the Argentinian president did not 
speak about Trump real estate developments with Ivanka Trump, either.

“He spoke with Ivanka only briefly, to say hello, because he met her when she 
was just a kid. They did not speak about it. The president doesn’t speak about 
city building permits,” Pavlovsky told the Guardian.

 
Earlier this hour we published a report by Uki Goñi for the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/mauricio-macri-donald-trump-buenos-aires-office>
 that a spokesman for Argentina’s president has denied thatDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> asked for a business favour 
in their first phone call after Trump was elected president.

We would now highlight a separate passage from the report: Ivanka Trump spoke 
on the call with president Mauricia Macri, Macri told 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/mauricio-macri-donald-trump-buenos-aires-office>
 a Japanese newspaper:

But despite such setbacks, the relationship remains close enough that 
President Macri spoke with Ivanka Trump during last Monday’s phone 
conversation. “In the call, I also talked with his daughter,” Macri told the 
Japanese newspaper the Asahi Shimbun. “I have known her since her infant days.”

Ivanka Trump’s role in her father’s transition and presidency have attracted 
controversy because Trump has said he will avoid conflicts of interest in his 
business dealings while president by turning his companies over to his children.

A safeguard that does not work as well if his elder daughter Ivanka is in the 
room for top-level meetings, as she was when Trump met with Japanese prime 
minister Shinzo Abe last week, or if she is sitting next to Trump when he gets 
off the phone with a foreign leader so that she may take the call.

New York City is going to be looking to the federal government to defray costs 
of protectingDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> – 
which run $1m a day, CNN reports – and, after Trump moves to the White House, 
of protecting Melania and Barron Trump, who will stay in the city until the boy 
finishes the school year.

The CNN report 
<http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/21/news/protecting-donald-trump/index.html> 
quotes mayor Bill de Blasio:

“The number one imperative here is safety and security. We owe that to the 
president elect, his family and his team,” said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio 
at a press conference on Friday. But he added the city will need help with 
those costs, particularly police overtime.

“This is a very substantial undertaking. It will take substantial resources,” 
he said. “We will begin the conversation with the federal government shortly on 
reimbursement for the NYPD for some of the costs that we are incurring.”

early voting for the Elections Project, has studiedjudicial reviews of 
state-level gerrymandering, and contributes this interesting analysis to the

A spokesman for Argentina’s president has denied that Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> asked for a business favour 
when Mauricio Macri called the US president-elect to congratulate him on his 
victory.


Local media reports have alleged that Trump asked Macri for help over a 
stalled construction permit for a 35-storey project called Trump Office in 
downtown Buenos Aires. A source told the Guardian that the information came 
from Macri’s staff.

“Trump asked him to authorize a building he’s constructing in Buenos Aires – 
it wasn’t just geopolitical chat,” said journalist Jorge Lanata on his Sunday 
night news programme, Periodismo Para Todos.

According the programme, the Buenos Aires building project became bogged down 
in bureaucratic red tape earlier this year, and was raised by Trump during the 
telephone call last week.

“Macri told Trump that Argentina is welcoming foreign investment now, and 
Trump replied that he has a $150m investment inArgentina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina> stalled because of a building 
permit in Buenos Aires,” journalist Romina Manguel, who described the alleged 
conversation on the programme, told the Guardian.

Macri’s spokesman Iván Pavlovsky denied the report. “Macri did not speak to 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> about the 
building of the tower,” he said. “They only talked about continuing the 
relationship between the two countries and recalled their personal relationship 
from years ago.”

Newt Gingrich last week ruled himself out

 for a position in Donald Trump’s cabinet. Which likely means... secretary of

The US district court for the western district of Wisconsin has ruled in 
agreement with a plaintiff’s allegation that “the redistricting plan enacted by 
the Wisconsin legislature in 2011 constitutes an unconstitutional partisan 
gerrymander.”

From the ruling <http://wispolitics.com/1006/161121Ruling.pdf>:

We find that Act 43 was intended to burden the representational rights of 
Democratic voters throughout the decennial period by impeding their ability to 
translate their votes into legislative seats. Moreover, as demonstrated by the 
results of the 2012 and 2014 elections, among other evidence, we conclude that 
Act 43 has had its intended effect. Finally, we find that the discriminatory 
effect is not explained by the political geography of Wisconsin nor is it 
justified by a legitimate state interest. Consequently, Act 43 constitutes an 
unconstitutional political gerrymander.

The ruling defers for the time being on a remedy:

We defer, at this time, a ruling on the appropriate remedy. The parties have 
not had an opportunity to brief fully the timing and propriety of remedial 
measures. We therefore order briefing on the appropriate remedy according to 
the following schedule:

1. The parties shall file simultaneous briefs on the nature and timing of all 
appropriate remedial measures in 30 days’ time; 2. Simultaneous response briefs 
are due 15 days thereafter.

The parties will provide the court with all evidentiary and legal support they 
believe is required for the court to make its ruling. If the parties do not 
believe that the court can rule on the appropriate remedy without the benefit 
of additional testimony, they should inform the court of the nature and extent 
of the testimony they believe is required.

The Trump transition pool has just sent over a summary of a conversation in 
Trump hotel lobby just then withTrump aide Kellyanne Conway. Here are sections 
of the Q&A:

Q: Will Trump hold a news conference?

A: Soon but he just has action-packed days filled with meetings. These days 
are overscheduled with meetings. We have people coming in from all over the 
country meeting with him to give their advice, their counsel, their experience, 
their vision for the country. Some of which will result in appointments to his 
administration and some just wish to be helpful. Very excited to have new 
leadership in the country.

Q: Why is Trump meeting with Democratic representative Tulsi Gabbard?

A: A lot of common ground. I think they both understood the country very well. 
Rep. Gabbard went against her party quite boldly early on. I think you are 
hearing people like Rep. Tim Ryan also raising concerns. Bernie Sanders today 
was also quoted as saying they should stop identity politics in the Democratic 
Party. Whoa. He can call and we’ll tell him how to do that and win. So I think 
there’s a recognition that there’s a big country, a massive amount of voters 
that feel disaffected from their party, the Democrats.

Q: What was the meeting with TV executives and news presenters about?

A: There was no need to mend fences. It was off-the-record meeting. It was 
very cordial, very productive, very congenial. It was also very candid and very 
honest. From my own perspective, it’s great to hit the reset button. It was a 
long hard-fought campaign.Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> proved that he animated 
America. He understood America and now he will be the president of all 
Americans.


Q: When will positions be announced?

A: It could come this week. It could come today but we’re not in a rush to 
publish names just because everybody is looking for the next story 
respectfully. You have got to get it right. We know we are ahead of schedule 
when you compare to previous presidents-elect.


Q: What about Americans who are afraid Trump will spread division and stoke 
bigotry and hatred – and demonstrations of hate since his election?

A: He has addressed it many times. He’s told people to cut it out. He said 
that it on 60 Minutes in front of 32 million people. He’ll be the president for 
all Americans. But honestly he respectfully he can use your help in that. The 
election is over. A lot of Americans are having a hard time accepting the 
results of the election...I think it’s incumbent upon all of, the Trump team, 
certainly the press, and others, the Democratic party, in following President 
Obama’s lead, following Vice President’s lead...in telling Americans this is 
your president, this is your vice president-elect, you should respect them and 
work with them.


Q: Do Trump’s business entanglements represent a conflict of interest?

A: I’m very confident he is not breaking any laws. He has various lawyers, 
accountants and advisers who tell him what he must do and what he can. He’s a 
businessman, he’s also working on transition. He’s the president elect. We’re 
in unprecedented times. We have someone who has been very successful....


Q: All Trump’s appointees so far are white men – will there be any diversity 
in the Trump administration?

A: His nominees so far have been all qualified to do the job they’re being 
asked to do. (CROSSTALK) In addition to that, or apart from that I should say, 
the first criteria to of course fill is everyone be qualified and capable to do 
the job that they’ve been asked to do. Secondly they support his agenda, which 
he’s been very straight forward about his first 100 days. And thirdly that they 
represent, his policies represent America.

And he is interviewing many different people but you can’t sacrifice the first 
criteria by tearing from the other ones...
 
Donald Trump’s nominee for US attorney general 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/18/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-trump-cabinet>
 was once accused of calling a black official in Alabama a “nigger”, and then 
gave a false explanation to the US Senate when testifying about the allegation.

Senator Jeff Sessions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/18/jeff-sessions-trump-attorney-general-criminal-justice-reform>
 was said to have used the racist term in November 1981, when talking about the 
first black man to be elected as a county commissioner in Mobile, where 
Sessions was a Republican party official and a federal prosecutor.

Asked about the alleged remark five years later, during Senate hearings on his 
ill-fated nomination by President Ronald Reagan for a federal judgeship, 
Sessions denied saying it and claimed the alleged timing did not stand up to 
scrutiny.

“My point is there was not a black county commissioner at that time,” Sessions 
said, in response to questions from Joe Biden, then a senator for Delaware. 
“The black was only elected later.”

But this was not true. Public records show Douglas Wicks had become the first 
black person elected to one of Mobile’s three county commission seats in 
September 1980 – more than a year before Sessions allegedly referred to him 
using the racist term.

Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach, an immigration hard-liner, flashed a 
written plan to question “high-risk” immigrants over support for Sharia law and 
the US Constitution as he entered a meeting withDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> at the weekend.

It has not been publicly announced whether Kobach is in the running for 
homeland security secretary or any other position. Trump’s promise to carry out 
“extreme vetting” of immigrants has raised a red flag for civil liberties 
advocates and defenders of a certain idea of the USA while beingcheered 
<http://www.nationalreview.com/article/438536/immigration-religious-test-constitution-does-not-ban-vetting-immigrants-religion>
 by analysts who dispute that the constitution’s ban on religious tests applies 
to immigration.

The scoop is from the Topeka, Kansas, Capital-Journal 
<http://cjonline.com/news/2016-11-21/kobach-took-plan-department-homeland-security-trump-meeting>
:

An Associated Press photographer shot an image of Kobach going into the 
meeting and clutching a binder along with a stack of papers. One page is 
visible and readable, though partly obscured by Kobach’s hand.

The document is arranged in a numbered format. The first point reads, “Bar the 
Entry of Potential Terrorists.”

The document calls for updating and reintroducing the National Security 
Entry-Exit Registration System. The program was implemented in the wake of the 
9/11 attacks, but largely suspended in 2011.

“All aliens from high-risk areas are tracked,” the document reads.

<https://twitter.com/CJOnline/status/800766763545796608> 
The advent of the kind of systems suggested in the Kobach document could be 
subject to abuse, with the government conceivably waylaying or arresting 
–anyone?– in border areas and tracking – anyone? – inside the country, perhaps 
depending on the government’s (probably secret?) definition of “high-risk 
areas”.

Will Kobach get the nod? The homeland security nominee will require senate 
confirmation.
 
Senator John McCain, who is to remain chairman of the senate armed services 
committee, which would hold hearings on the confirmation of Trump’s defense 
secretary nominee, has again voiced support forgeneral James “Mad Dog” Mattis, 
who is not yet a nominee but who was praised by Trump after a weekend meeting.

Mattis, 66, a four-star Marine corps general, has relatively recent combat 
experience in both Afghanistan and Iraq, where he was part of the team that led 
the 2004 battle for control of the Iraqi city of Fallujah. (Mattis, who retired 
four years ago, was not on the scene for thebattle to re-take Fallujah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/falluja-iraq-fully-liberated-from-isis>

 from his final military post, as head of US central command, after policy 
clashes with the Obama White House, whose nuclear deal with Iran Mattis has 
vehemently criticized.

The media pool covering the Trump transition has encountered former senator 
Scott Brown and Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin following their meetings in Trump 
tower.

Also spotted: former Texas governor Rick Perry, leaving the building just 
after noon without speaking with reporters.
Additionally spotted: TV executives and on-air personality including:

NBC’s Deborah Turness

CNN’s Jeff Zucker and Wolf Blitzer

FOX’s Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy and Jay Wallace and Suzanne Scott

CBS’s John Dickerson and Charlie Rose

Fallin said “we are very, very excited for this administration,” adding that 
she “was not offered a position.”

“It was just an initial meeting to discuss a wide range of topics,” Fallin 
said.

Brown spoke at length about challenges facing the veterans administration, and 
said he thought he was the “best person” for the job.


Brown said the VA post was the “toughest job in the cabinet” owing to the 
importance of caring for veterans and systemic problems plaguing the agency.


“He’s obviously going to take my application, or interest, under 
consideration,” Brown said. “I’m glad that he called. He’s going to obviously 
meet other folks, and we should know, I would think, probably after 
Thanksgiving.”


Brown continued:

I’m not competing with anybody. I think I’m the best person, but there are 
some tremendous people out there and I don’t look at it as a competition. 
Anybody who takes that job, which I believe is the toughest job in the cabinet 
– because it has so many problems in that it’s so visible, and that people’s 
lives are depending on whether you do it right or wrong. I think as the 
president-elect said, it’s his highest priority, and that’s why the veterans 
came out so strongly for him.
