<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-wins-us-election-news>
 ignited protests across the United States, with thousands of demonstrators 
crowding into streets and surrounding his buildings in major American cities.

The protests – in cities including New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, 
Oakland, Philadelphia and Seattle – erupted after the Democratic candidate, 
Hillary Clinton, lost the electoral college and presidential race on Tuesday 
night despite apparentlywinning the popular vote

As US voters and international leaders

 with aRepublican White House 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-president-policy-immigration-agenda-healthcare>
 led by the former reality television star, people opposed to Trump on 
Wednesday took to the streets criticizing the racism, sexism and xenophobia 
that they say the president-elect has made mainstream.

As night fell in midtown Manhattan, people took over Sixth Avenue 
<https://twitter.com/feministabulous/status/796515927017881601> and marched by 
Trump Tower, carrying signs that read “Not my president”, “She got more votes

” and “Hands off my pussy”, a reference to a leaked recording where Trump
bragged that he could sexually assault women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women>
 because of his fame. A number of arrests were made.


Protesters who had marched all the way from Union Square – some 35 blocks 
downtown – continued past Trump Tower, with a crowd congregating in front of 
the president-elect’s building.

“Fuck your tower! Fuck your wall!” people chanted at Trump Tower’s 
brass-escutcheoned facade, as scores of NYPD officers manned barricades, behind 
which stood eight department of sanitation trucks filled with dirt.

Nina, an actor living in Manhattan, told the Guardian that the protest felt 
less like a call-to-arms than a vigil for the promise of America.

“I’m distraught at the decision,” said Nina, who declined to share her surname 
for professional reasons. “He’s a horrible, horrible man, not the leader of the 
America I live in. Or the America I thought I lived in.”

Thousands also took to the streets in Chicago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago>, a Democratic city that 
overwhelmingly supported Clinton according to initial polls.


Gathering for what activists called an “emergency Trump protest”, 
demonstrators virtually shut down the city during rush hour traffic as they 
shouted: “Trump is not my president.”

“I’m incredibly upset. I’m angry,” said Parker Smith as she held a sign 
stating “My Body, My Choice” outside the president-elect’s Chicago hotel tower. 
“This has been just a lot to deal with and I’m very worried for the next four 
years.”

While Chicago has gained international attention for these kinds of 
demonstrations in recent years – tied to theBlack Lives Matter movement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement> against 
police violence – Wednesday’s protests drew a diverse group of voters united in 
their anger at Trump.

Protesters stood their ground for hours outside the luxury building, chanting 
about issues including black lives, LGBT rights and women’s health.

“This is the America I identify with,” said protester Nicole Endenova, a young 
woman of color, as she stared at the crowds.

Some protesters waved a Mexican flag outside the tower while screaming “Fuck 
your wall”, referring to Trump’s controversial plan for a border barrier.

As helicopters followed the march from above, while police shielded Trump 
Tower, some protestersshouted 
<https://twitter.com/ZachStafford/status/796528840239620096>, “We want a 
president, not a fucking racist!”

Several larger demonstrations throughout the day were led by high school and 
college students, including a masswalkout at a high school

in Berkeley, California.

Protests were first launched 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/angry-protests-trump-victory> 
early on Wednesday morning on the west coast after Trump told his supporters in 
New York City that Clinton had called him to concede.

“People are fucking bummed. People are disgusted,” said Eddie Gutierrez, 33, 
who joined late-night protests in Oakland, California. “They’ve lost faith in 
the fucking system.”
