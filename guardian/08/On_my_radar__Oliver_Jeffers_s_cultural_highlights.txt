 ‘Stunning’: Prune Nourry’s Terracotta Daughters. Photograph: Miguel 
Tovar/STF/LatinContent/Getty Images 
Prune Nourry is a French sculptor and a lot of her work is based on gender 
inequality. This one was about the one-child policy they had in China and how 
parents would quietly give girls up for adoption – there are orphanages 
populated with little girls across China. Prune recreated the terracotta army, 
basing 116 life-size sculptures on some of the girls given up for adoption. She 
has travelled around with the project – I saw it in Paris and New York – and 
now it has gone back to China to be buried, where in 15 years she’s going to do 
a fake excavation. Stunning.

Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01lswct>
 by R Buckminster Fuller (1968)

This is the book that has had the most impact on me recently. It treats Earth 
as a spaceship that has finite fuel that can’t be restocked, and it’s about how 
we survive as a species without spiralling into oblivion. It’s surprisingly apt 
for today, and also slightly depressing because all these predictions based on 
scientific thinking that seem obvious when they’re written have not happened. 
People are fallible and compelled to make the same mistakes over and over. It’s 
a fascinating read, especially as I’m trying to explain this planet to my 
one-year-old son and it was a really interesting take on the whole thing. There 
are so many pearls of wisdom in it.

 ‘The atmosphere was electric’: Carl Frampton wins the featherweight 
championship in Brooklyn. Photograph: Anthony Geathers/Getty Images 
I went to see the title fight for the featherweight championship a few weeks 
ago. There was this boxer from Belfast, Carl Frampton: the place was rammed to 
the rafters and I think almost two-thirds were from Northern Ireland. The bar 
staff were going, “We’ve never seen anything like this. Normally when people 
come for a concert or basketball you don’t get crowds singing songs in the 
bar.” It was a great fight and Frampton won, so he’s the new champion. The 
atmosphere was electric and it was a fantastic evening: Belfast in Brooklyn.

 ‘A beautiful piece of coastline’: The Red Arch on the Antrim coast road, 
Northern Ireland. Photograph: Alamy 
I try to go back to Belfast as often as I can, a couple of times a year. Last 
time I took no phone, no radio, and went for a drive up the north coast of 
Antrim. It’s a beautiful piece of coastline: rugged and wild and also quite 
barren. There aren’t really any trees, it’s mostly heath and rock. I’ve used 
photographs I’ve taken there as the basis for several landscape paintings. I 
had fish and chips just outside Ballymena and then went to Ballintoy, where my 
wife and I were married – they filmGame of Thrones there now – and I went for a 
walk along the pier. It was absolutely stunning and one of the best days I’ve 
had in a while.

 ‘My jaw nearly hit the floor. Just incredible’: Mandolinist Chris Thile.

Chris won the MacArthur prize 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/punch-brothers-leader-chris-thile-wins-macarthur-genius-grant-20121002>
, or “genius grant”, for a musical project he’s doing. He figured out that Bach 
concertos and partitas were better played on a mandolin than a violin, because 
of the subtlety: to hit the particular chords that use the top and bottom 
string, you have to play the violin quite aggressively, to physically get the 
bow to do that. But with the mandolin you can pluck very gently, so you can 
play these pieces quite differently to how they’ve been played before. He came 
by the studio and played me some, and my jaw nearly hit the floor. It was just 
incredible.

 ‘Bizarre, abstract and completely arresting’: Fly By Night by Duke Riley. 
Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters 
Duke Riley is an artist who did this project at the start of the summer. Over 
a couple of years he trained 2,000 pigeons to fly a little bit later each 
evening, and then did this half-hour performance where he flew them from a boat 
in the Brooklyn navy yard. They all had LED lights attached to them, and just 
as dusk was settling, and the city is starting to disappear, all these pigeons 
took off – it was pretty surreal. It looked like you were under water watching 
a shoal of fish. It was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen: 
bizarre, abstract and completely arresting.

Fort Defiance, Brooklyn <http://www.fortdefiancebrooklyn.com/>

This is a bar/restaurant in Red Hook, which is an area that’s sort of cut off 
from the rest of Brooklyn; it’s very nautical, because that’s historically 
where all the ships came in. It’s mostly classic American fare, but there’s 
this one Mexican dish, huevos rancheros – the greatest thing I’ve ever eaten. I 
asked them about the dish and they said that the chefs are all Mexican, and the 
owner came in one day and that’s what they were cooking for themselves for 
breakfast. It was their mother’s recipe. The owner had some and insisted on 
putting it on the menu.

 ‘Little stories’: Unfinished: Thoughts Left Visible at the Met Breuer museum 
in New York. Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA 
This is a collection of paintings throughout the years, from the Renaissance 
right through to the modern day, that for one reason or another were left 
unfinished, and there are little stories beside them as to why. There are 
Picassos in there, a Rembrandt, and I think a Caravaggio. There’s one 
contemporary portrait painter whose sitter never came back, and she has no idea 
why. Then there’s a beautifully rendered Renaissance portrait of a woman 
painted in such detail, and then the face is painted out – she obviously wasn’t 
happy with it. As you look at it today, hundreds of years later, it looks like 
a collage, just flat blocks of colour.
