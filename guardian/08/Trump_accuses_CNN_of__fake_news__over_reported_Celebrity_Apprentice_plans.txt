” regarding his reported intention to maintainan executive producer credit on 
The Celebrity Apprentice

He would not be working on the series at all, he said in two tweets sent 
before dawn on Saturday, “even part time”.

MGM said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/08/donald-trump-celebrity-apprentice-executive-producer>
 on Thursday Trump would not remove his name from the titles of the forthcoming 
season of The Celebrity Apprentice. On Friday, senior adviser Kellyanne Conway 
told CNN the president-elect’s ties to his reality show were being reviewed for 
potential conflicts of interest.

Trump’s charge against CNN <https://www.theguardian.com/media/cnn> is an 
emotive one, both regarding potential clashes between the president-elect’s 
business empire and his new role and as debate continues over the impact of 
“fake news” on the election and Russia’s likely involvement in its spread.

On Friday night, reports in the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/us/obama-russia-election-hack.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0>
 andWashington Post

 said US intelligence agencies including the CIA believed Russia had interfered 
with the election in favour of Trump. The Trump transition team flatly rejected 
the reports.

Trump has long been accused of using controversial tweets to distract 
attention from troublesome press attention.

He made his new charge against CNN a little before 6.30am on Saturday, after a 
Friday nightrally in Michigan 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/807427326522884096> and before a 
scheduled appearance 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/807565127021109252> and interview 
at the Army v Navy football game in Baltimore.

He also used Twitter to confirm 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/807545243608420352> that the former 
New York mayor Rudy Giuliani was no longer in the running to be secretary of 
state. Debate continues over Trump’scabinet picks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/09/donald-trump-cabinet-republican-appointments-campaign>
, including climate sceptics for theDepartment of the Interior 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/09/cathy-mcmorris-rodgers-department-interior-trump>
 and the Environmental Protection Agency.


Trump said: “I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I 
conceived it with Mark B[urnett] & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO 
TIME!


He added: “Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my 
Presidency, even part time, are rediculous & untrue [sic] – FAKE NEWS!”

The spread of “fake news” on social media has caused widespread and growing 
concern.

Last Sunday, the potential consequences of such stories became clear when a 
conspiracy theorist “self-investigating”fake news stories 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/06/pizzagate-businesses-washington-threats>
 about a Washington pizza restaurant and a child sex ring run by senior 
Democrats walked into the restaurant and fired shots from an assault rifle.


In a speech at the Capitol in Washington on Thursday, Trump’s presidential 
opponent, Hillary Clinton, called for action.

“This is not about politics or partisanship,” she said. “Lives are at risk. 
Lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days to do their jobs, 
contribute to their communities.

“It is a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly.”

The Washington pizza restaurant in question, Comet Ping Pong, was this weekend 
being supported by a “Stand With Comet” event. More than 2,000 people said on 
Facebook they would support the pizza place and other neighbourhood restaurants.

On Friday at Comet Ping Pong, people waited an hour and a half for a table and 
carry-out took 45 minutes. Local restaurants sent wait staff to help. Others 
sent food for employees.


A GoFundMe page set up to help the restaurant pay for legal expenses and extra 
security had passed $15,000, with a goal of $28,000.

Interim District of Columbia police chief Peter Newsham visited the 
restaurant, and had a message for peddlers of fake news.

“It’s not funny,” he said. “It’s serious. It can have very, very serious 
consequences.”

The man police arrested last Sunday at Comet Ping Pong was 28-year-old Edgar 
Maddison Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina. He has a court hearing next week.

Welch surrendered peacefully “when he found no evidence that underage children 
were being harbored in the restaurant”, police said.
