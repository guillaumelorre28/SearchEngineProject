In a move that will no doubt excite budget travellers across the continent, 
Europe’s largest intercity bus provider has launched a new pass that means 
tourists can travel to five destinations for €99.

The InterFlix <https://interflix.flixbus.com/> pass allows up to five journeys 
within a period of three months to more than 900 destinations in 20 European 
countries. The pass is available at one price for all ages.

The pass was launched by Flixbus, a rapidly expanding company that was founded 
in Germany in 2013. In 2015, it began to run international services and, this 
year, expanded into central and eastern Europe, Spain and the UK.

Other European bus passes currently available include the Eurolines pass 
<https://eurolines-pass.eu>, which allows unlimited travel for 15 or 30 days. 
The 30-day ticket starts at €265 for young people and €340 for adults over 26.

Also designed for European backpacking is the Busabout 
<http://www.busabout.com/> network, which runs hop-on-hop-off coaches 
connecting 46 of Europe’s major destinations between May and October. The 
unlimited pass starts at £949 for adults, while a ticket with 12 stops starts 
at £569.

For those planning trips with fewer stops and longer stays in each 
destination, the InterFlix pass could prove considerably cheaper.
