 * Hillary Clinton unveiled a new campaign plane over the weekend, emblazoned 
with her “Stronger Together” slogan, which she will now travel on along with 
members of the press - and her press pool could not have been more thrilled:

 * A group of 88 retired military leaders endorsed Donald Trump, releasing a 
letter <https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/MILITARY_LETTER.pdf> through the Trump 
campaign in which they appeared to point out Hillary Clinton’s experience as 
Secretary of State as reason for not backing her. 
 * Fox News reached a settlement with former news anchor Gretchen Carlson for a
reported $20m 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/fox-news-settles-with-gretchen-carlson-for-20-million>
 over claims she was fired from the network after she refused sexual advances 
from chairman Roger Ailes. In a statement released on Tuesday, Fox News’s 
parent company expressed “sincere regret” over the incident.

 * For the first time since 1964, the Dallas Morning News won’t endorse the 
Republican nominee for president, declaring that Trump “does not deserve your 
vote” and is not a true conservative nor Republican. Itseditorial today reads 
<http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160906-donald-trump-is-no-republican.ece>
: 
It’s not easy to offer a shorthand list of such tenets, since Trump flips from 
one side to the other, issue after issue, sometimes within a single news cycle. 
Regardless, his ideas are so far from Republicanism that they have spawned a 
new description: Trumpism.

 * Clinton renewed her calls for Trump to release his tax returns, saying he 
“clearly has something to hide”:

 * Trump’s eldest son told a radio show this morning that the health of 
Democratic rival Hillary Clinton - long a favorite subject forunproven 
conspiracy theories 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/hillary-clinton-on-jimmy-kimmel-opens-up-about-trumps-wacky-health-claims>
 - is “fair game” in the 2016 campaign. “Of course it’s fair game,” Donald 
Trump Jr. told radio host Mike Gallagheron The Mike Gallagher Show 
<http://www.mikeonline.com/donaldjtrumpjr-gives-mike-the-strategy-for-his-dad-to-win-the-election-in-the-last-62-days-of-the-campaign/>
, a nationally syndicated radio program. “Of course it is: this is a person 
that, you know, again, has a track record of not taking that phone call at 
three o’clock in the morning.”

Donald Trump on debate temperament: 'I can't tell you, because I’m not sure 
that I know'

Speaking with ABC’s David Muir, Donald Trump told the anchor that his first 
debate against Democratic presidential nomineeHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> may feature him being 
“very nice” and “very respectful” - or it may not.

“I can’t tell you, because I’m not sure that I know. It will depend,” Trump 
said of his temperament during the debate. “You are going to have to adjust, 
you’re going to have to see. You need flexibility. In life, David, you need 
flexibility. It may be very nice and it may be very respectful, and it may not, 
depends on how she treats me.”

The first debate between Trump and Clinton will be on 26 September.

President Obama nominates first-ever Muslim American to serve as a US federal 
judge

President Barack Obama today nominated Abid Riaz Qureshi to serve on the US 
District Court for the District of Columbia, often seen as a major feeder court 
for the US Circuit Court of Appeals.

“I am pleased to nominate Mr. Qureshi to serve on the United States District 
Court bench,” Obama said in a statement. “I am confident he will serve the 
American people with integrity and a steadfast commitment to justice.”

With the current freeze on confirmation for Obama’s judicial nominees - 
particularly would-be supreme court justice Merrick Garland, whose nomination 
to replace the late Antonin Scalia has been stymied by Republican lawmakers 
since March - it is unlikely that Qureshi will be confirmed before the end of 
Obama’s presidential term, but the nomination is still historic. Of the more 
than 3,000 federal judges currently serving in the US judiciary, not a single 
one is an observant Muslim.

“I commend President Obama for taking this important step in continuing to 
pick the best and brightest from every community to serve as part of our 
nation’s judiciary,” Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, a 
legal advocacy organization,declared in a statement 
<https://www.muslimadvocates.org/muslim-advocates-heralds-president-obamas-historic-judicial-nomination-2/>
.

“A judiciary that reflects the rich diversity of our nation helps ensure the 
fair and just administration of the law, and it is vital for American Muslims 
to be included,” Khera continued. “Mr. Qureshi’s profound commitment to the 
rule of law and justice for people of all backgrounds makes him an exceptional 
nominee.”

Obama’s would-be successor, Donald Trump, has declared that it’s “absolutely 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/trump-muslim-judge-might-not-be-fair-to-me-either-223912>
” possible that he would be treated unfairly by a Muslim judge, echoing his 
declaration that a federal judge of Mexican descent could not fairly oversee a 
fraud suit against one of his companies because of his ethnicity.

Qureshi is a partner at the law firm of Latham & Watkins, where he specializes 
in cases involving the health care fraud and securities violations. Qureshi is 
also the recipient of the “Champions of Justice” Award in 2012 by the National 
Law Journal’s Legal Times.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has held 
innumerable rallies and events over the past fifteen months, but his quotation 
of a line from the Bible at a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, tonight may 
be the first time we can recall that he has included a passage from scripture 
at one of his rallies.

“Let me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday, from 1 John 
4,” Trump said, referring to an event held at a largely African American church 
in Detroit. “‘No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives 
in us and His love is made complete in us.’ Imagine what we, our country, could 
accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, 
saluting one flag.”

With that, Trump vows to the audience that he will make America great again, 
and departs.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> implied that 
the person in charge of setting up Hillary Clinton’s private email servers is 
missing or dead at a rally in Greenville, North Carolina.

“Where is he? Where is he? Is he living? Where is he? He pleaded the fifth, 
and we never heard about him again,” Trump said. “This is like Watergate, only 
it’s worse.”

Donald Trump told an audience in Greenville, North Carolina, that his greatest 
asset is his temperament, which has only been criticized by rivalHillary Clinton
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> because she hired 
“Madison Avenue” advertising experts to foment “hit jobs” on him.

“You ever notice? She never talks about policy, she never talks about illegal 
immigration, she never talks about anything. All she does is a hit job onDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>,” he said about Clinton.

“I think my single greatest asset of any assets I have, is my temperament, and 
I know how to win,” Trump said. “It’s my single greatest asset, and every time 
you hear it, this is a phony group of lying people.”

“Tell her we wanna hear about your policy on jobs, on illegal immigration, I 
wanna hear what she’s gonna do about stopping jobs from leaving North Carolina 
and going to Mexico and other place,” telling the audience that Clinton 
“doesn’t have a clue”.

Continuing his remarks in Greenville, North Carolina, Donald Trump lambasted 
neoconservatism and military adventurism, callingHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> an advocate of “military 
adventurism”.

“I believe in a foreign policy based on our national interest, that focuses on 
American security and regional stability, instead of using our military to 
create democracies in countries with no democratic history and couldn’t care 
less about democracy,” Trump said. “And they don’t even want it!”

His foreign policy strategy, Trump said, would be “based on a longterm 
strategy of defeating radical Islamic terrorism,” with the first step being the 
undoing of “the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton and President Obama, who 
“has made Americans far less safe, probably than ever before.”

“These people,” he added dismissively.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> previewed 
August fundraising numbers tonight in Greenville, North Carolina, telling the 
audience that while “unfortunately,” much of the money raised came from his own 
pockets, plenty came from small donors.

“A lot of it, unfortunately, came from me, but a lot of it came from small 
donors,” Trump said, telling the audience that he would be reporting a 
“tremendous” fundraising number tomorrow.

“We’re gonna be reporting a very big number tomorrow,” Trump continued, noting 
that the average donation was roughly $61 per person.

Five days ago, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign announced that the 
campaign and allied action funds begin September with a more than $152 million 
war chest, built from $143m in donations from more than 2.3m people.

The average donation in August was $50, according to the campaign.

Speaking in Greenville, North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> promised supporters 
that he would prevent immigration from Arab nations with ongoing problems 
relating to terrorism.

“It’s going to be a very busy first day. I’m going to instruct the Department 
of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program, and 
develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region - and the safe 
zone will not be paid for by us. It will be paid for by Gulf states that have 
plenty of money,” Trump vowed.

“Many of those countries wouldn’t be there for a long period of time - believe 
me - if we didn’t protect them,” Trump said, telling the audience thatHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> will be 
“America’s Angela Merkel, and you see what happened to Angela Merkel of 
Germany! They had a massive defeat recently in the elections! Because Germany 
has had problems recently that they’ve rarely seen before.”

“France isn’t France,” Trump said, quoting friends, apparently referring to 
immigration tensions in Western Europe.

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has said 
her husband, former president Bill Clinton, should not have to resign his role 
as head of their family’s charitable foundation until the presidential election 
is decided in November.

The Democratic nominee said she did not see any ethical problems with her 
husband’s continued involvement with the Clinton Foundation, which raises money 
from wealthy donors around the world while she runs for president despite 
mounting criticism.

“I don’t think there are conflicts of interest,” Clinton told ABC’s David Muir 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-hillary-clinton-husband-bill-resign-foundation-post/story?id=41878492>
 in a joint interview today with her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, scheduled 
to air on Tuesday night.

Bill Clinton told supporters in August that he would resign from the 
foundation’s board 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/bill-clinton-hillary-president-clinton-foundation-future-trump>
 and stop raising money if his wife were elected. The foundation last month
confirmed 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/chelsea-clinton-to-stay-on-clinton-foundation-board-if-hillary-becomes-president-1472058025>
 that Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, would remain on the board even if 
her mother won in November.

Clinton also dismissed accusations that allies and donors of the Clinton 
Foundation received special treatment while she served as secretary of state.

“I know that that’s what has been alleged and never proven. But nevertheless, 
I take it seriously,” Clinton said in the interview, which was taped on Monday 
between Labor Day campaign stops.

Trump and his campaign have seized on the issue, alleging that the Clinton 
Foundation is a “pay-for-play” operation. At campaign events, he has pointed to 
arecent analysis by the Associated Press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department-clinton-foundation>
 that showed more than half the people Clinton met outside the government as 
secretary of state were donors to the Clinton family’s foundation.

Ben Carson: Donald Trump should apologize for birtherism

Retired pediatric neurosurgeon, onetime presidential candidate and current 
campaign advisor Ben Carsontold CNN this afternoon 
<http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/09/06/the-lead-talk-trump-dr-ben-carson-pt-2.cnn>
 that he thinks it would be a “good idea” for Donald Trump to apologize to 
African-American voters for questioning President Barack Obama’s birthplace, a 
topic that Trump has declared off-limits since he launched his presidential 
campaign 15 months ago.

Allegri/Reuters 
CNN anchor Jake Tapper told Carson that among the minority voters he has 
spoken to, many “are resistant to Donald Trump because he led the charge to say 
that the nation’s first African American president was born in Africa and not 
born in the United States,” before asking Carson: “Do you think it’s time for
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to acknowledge 
that all that birther nonsense was a mistake and to apologize?”

Carson, for his part, did.

“I think that would be a good idea - absolutely,” Carson said. “I suggest that 
on all sides. Let’s get all of the hate and rancor out of the way so that we 
can actually discuss the issues.”

Trump made his first forays into the political realm in 2011 as the most 
public face of the so-called “birther” movement, which questions Obama’s right 
to hold office as a natural-born American citizen due to discredited conspiracy 
theories declaring that he was born in Kenya.

It’s not easy to offer a shorthand list of such tenets, since Trump flips from

depends on how she treats me.”

The first debate between Trump and Clinton will be on 26 September.

President Barack Obama today nominated Abid Riaz Qureshi to serve on the US 
District Court for the District of Columbia, often seen as a major feeder court 
for the US Circuit Court of Appeals.

“I am pleased to nominate Mr. Qureshi to serve on the United States District 
Court bench,” Obama said in a statement. “I am confident he will serve the 
American people with integrity and a steadfast commitment to justice.”

With the current freeze on confirmation for Obama’s judicial nominees - 
particularly would-be supreme court justice Merrick Garland, whose nomination 
to replace the late Antonin Scalia has been stymied by Republican lawmakers 
since March - it is unlikely that Qureshi will be confirmed before the end of 
Obama’s presidential term, but the nomination is still historic. Of the more 
than 3,000 federal judges currently serving in the US judiciary, not a single 
one is an observant Muslim.

“I commend President Obama for taking this important step in continuing to 
pick the best and brightest from every community to serve as part of our 
nation’s judiciary,” Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, a 
legal advocacy organization,declared in a statement 
<https://www.muslimadvocates.org/muslim-advocates-heralds-president-obamas-historic-judicial-nomination-2/>
.

“A judiciary that reflects the rich diversity of our nation helps ensure the 
fair and just administration of the law, and it is vital for American Muslims 
to be included,” Khera continued. “Mr. Qureshi’s profound commitment to the 
rule of law and justice for people of all backgrounds makes him an exceptional 
nominee.”

Obama’s would-be successor, Donald Trump, has declared that it’s “absolutely 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/trump-muslim-judge-might-not-be-fair-to-me-either-223912>
” possible that he would be treated unfairly by a Muslim judge, echoing his 
declaration that a federal judge of Mexican descent could not fairly oversee a 
fraud suit against one of his companies because of his ethnicity.

Qureshi is a partner at the law firm of Latham & Watkins, where he specializes 
in cases involving the health care fraud and securities violations. Qureshi is 
also the recipient of the “Champions of Justice” Award in 2012 by the National 
Law Journal’s Legal Times.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has held 
innumerable rallies and events over the past fifteen months, but his quotation 
of a line from the Bible at a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, tonight may 
be the first time we can recall that he has included a passage from scripture 
at one of his rallies.

“Let me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday, from 1 John 
4,” Trump said, referring to an event held at a largely African American church 
in Detroit. “‘No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives 
in us and His love is made complete in us.’ Imagine what we, our country, could 
accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, 
saluting one flag.”

With that, Trump vows to the audience that he will make America great again, 
and departs.
 
Donald Trump, about minority voters:

What do you have to lose? Nothing.
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> implied that 
the person in charge of setting up Hillary Clinton’s private email servers is 
missing or dead at a rally in Greenville, North Carolina.

“Where is he? Where is he? Is he living? Where is he? He pleaded the fifth, 
and we never heard about him again,” Trump said. “This is like Watergate, only 
it’s worse.”
 
Donald Trump told an audience in Greenville, North Carolina, that his greatest 
asset is his temperament, which has only been criticized by rivalHillary Clinton
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> because she hired 
“Madison Avenue” advertising experts to foment “hit jobs” on him.

“You ever notice? She never talks about policy, she never talks about illegal 
immigration, she never talks about anything. All she does is a hit job onDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>,” he said about Clinton.

“I think my single greatest asset of any assets I have, is my temperament, and 
I know how to win,” Trump said. “It’s my single greatest asset, and every time 
you hear it, this is a phony group of lying people.”

“Tell her we wanna hear about your policy on jobs, on illegal immigration, I 
wanna hear what she’s gonna do about stopping jobs from leaving North Carolina 
and going to Mexico and other place,” telling the audience that Clinton 
“doesn’t have a clue”.
 
Continuing his remarks in Greenville, North Carolina, Donald Trump lambasted 
neoconservatism and military adventurism, callingHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> an advocate of “military 
adventurism”.

“I believe in a foreign policy based on our national interest, that focuses on 
American security and regional stability, instead of using our military to 
create democracies in countries with no democratic history and couldn’t care 
less about democracy,” Trump said. “And they don’t even want it!”

His foreign policy strategy, Trump said, would be “based on a longterm 
strategy of defeating radical Islamic terrorism,” with the first step being the 
undoing of “the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton and President Obama, who 
“has made Americans far less safe, probably than ever before.”

“These people,” he added dismissively.
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> previewed 
August fundraising numbers tonight in Greenville, North Carolina, telling the 
audience that while “unfortunately,” much of the money raised came from his own 
pockets, plenty came from small donors.

“A lot of it, unfortunately, came from me, but a lot of it came from small 
donors,” Trump said, telling the audience that he would be reporting a 
“tremendous” fundraising number tomorrow.

“We’re gonna be reporting a very big number tomorrow,” Trump continued, noting 
that the average donation was roughly $61 per person.

Five days ago, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign announced that the 
campaign and allied action funds begin September with a more than $152 million 
war chest, built from $143m in donations from more than 2.3m people.

The average donation in August was $50, according to the campaign.
 
Donald Trump, on trade:

By the way - I don’t anything can be as bad as Nafta, but I think TPP is gonna 
be pretty close.
 
Speaking in Greenville, North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> promised supporters 
that he would prevent immigration from Arab nations with ongoing problems 
relating to terrorism.

“It’s going to be a very busy first day. I’m going to instruct the Department 
of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program, and 
develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region - and the safe 
zone will not be paid for by us. It will be paid for by Gulf states that have 
plenty of money,” Trump vowed.

“Many of those countries wouldn’t be there for a long period of time - believe 
me - if we didn’t protect them,” Trump said, telling the audience thatHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> will be 
“America’s Angela Merkel, and you see what happened to Angela Merkel of 
Germany! They had a massive defeat recently in the elections! Because Germany 
has had problems recently that they’ve rarely seen before.”

“France isn’t France,” Trump said, quoting friends, apparently referring to 
immigration tensions in Western Europe.

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has said 
her husband, former president Bill Clinton, should not have to resign his role 
as head of their family’s charitable foundation until the presidential election 
is decided in November.

The Democratic nominee said she did not see any ethical problems with her 
husband’s continued involvement with the Clinton Foundation, which raises money 
from wealthy donors around the world while she runs for president despite 
mounting criticism.

“I don’t think there are conflicts of interest,” Clinton told ABC’s David Muir 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-hillary-clinton-husband-bill-resign-foundation-post/story?id=41878492>
 in a joint interview today with her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, scheduled 
to air on Tuesday night.

Bill Clinton told supporters in August that he would resign from the 
foundation’s board 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/bill-clinton-hillary-president-clinton-foundation-future-trump>
 and stop raising money if his wife were elected. The foundation last month
confirmed 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/chelsea-clinton-to-stay-on-clinton-foundation-board-if-hillary-becomes-president-1472058025>
 that Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, would remain on the board even if 
her mother won in November.

Clinton also dismissed accusations that allies and donors of the Clinton 
Foundation received special treatment while she served as secretary of state.

“I know that that’s what has been alleged and never proven. But nevertheless, 
I take it seriously,” Clinton said in the interview, which was taped on Monday 
between Labor Day campaign stops.

Trump and his campaign have seized on the issue, alleging that the Clinton 
Foundation is a “pay-for-play” operation. At campaign events, he has pointed to 
arecent analysis by the Associated Press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department-clinton-foundation>
 that showed more than half the people Clinton met outside the government as 
secretary of state were donors to the Clinton family’s foundation.

Retired pediatric neurosurgeon, onetime presidential candidate and current 
campaign advisor Ben Carsontold CNN this afternoon 
<http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/09/06/the-lead-talk-trump-dr-ben-carson-pt-2.cnn>
 that he thinks it would be a “good idea” for Donald Trump to apologize to 
African-American voters for questioning President Barack Obama’s birthplace, a 
topic that Trump has declared off-limits since he launched his presidential 
campaign 15 months ago.

CNN anchor Jake Tapper told Carson that among the minority voters he has 
spoken to, many “are resistant to Donald Trump because he led the charge to say 
that the nation’s first African American president was born in Africa and not 
born in the United States,” before asking Carson: “Do you think it’s time for
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> to acknowledge 
that all that birther nonsense was a mistake and to apologize?”

Carson, for his part, did.

“I think that would be a good idea - absolutely,” Carson said. “I suggest that 
on all sides. Let’s get all of the hate and rancor out of the way so that we 
can actually discuss the issues.”

Trump made his first forays into the political realm in 2011 as the most 
public face of the so-called “birther” movement, which questions Obama’s right 
to hold office as a natural-born American citizen due to discredited conspiracy 
theories declaring that he was born in Kenya.
