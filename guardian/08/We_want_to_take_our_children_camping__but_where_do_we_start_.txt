Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to 
help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next 
Saturday’s paper.

This week’s question:

Having acquired two children (aged six and four) we’ve decided to try camping 
this year. Having never been we need to get the gear, plus some advice on where 
to go – all without spending a fortune. Camping vets out there, help us hatch a 
plan – or tell us it’s madness!
