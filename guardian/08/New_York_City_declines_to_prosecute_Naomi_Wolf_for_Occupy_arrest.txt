Naomi Wolf will not do hard time for walking on a sidewalk as part of an 
Occupy Wall Street <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/occupy-wall-street> 
demonstration last October. New York officials have announced they have 
declined to prosecute, and the case has been dismissed.

Wolf, a Guardian contributor, was arrested in New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> after a confrontation with 
police officers who had set up cordons to restrict the movement of Occupy 
protesters outside an event for the Huffington Post, to which she also 
contributes.

Wolf asserted the right of the protesters to use the sidewalk. A confrontation 
ensued. Wolfdescribed the incident in a piece in the Guardian 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/oct/19/naomi-wolf-arrest-occupy-wall-street>
.

Here's a clip of the confrontation and arrest:

"[A police officer] gave me a look of pure hate," Wolf wrote. "'Are you going 
to back down?' he shouted. I stood, immobilised, for a moment. 'Are you getting 
out of my way?'"

When Wolf declined to leave the sidewalk, she was arrested, along with her 
companion.

"What did I take away?" Wolf wrote. "Just that, unfortunately, my partner and 
I became exhibit A in a process that I have been warning Americans about since 
2007: first they come for the 'other' – the 'terrorist', the brown person, the 
Muslim, the outsider; then they come for you – while you are standing on a 
sidewalk in evening dress, obeying the law."
