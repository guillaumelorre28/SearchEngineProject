A man was shotdead in west Belfast <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/belfast> on 
Monday night.

The victim, in his 50s, was injured in the neck and chest during the shooting 
in the republican Divis area. It is understood he was a delivery driver and was 
targeted inside the car he was driving. He died later of his wounds.

Local reports suggested that the man had been shot in the past. 

The incident was the third shooting in the city in the past 24 hours following 
incidents which were believed to be so-called paramilitary punishment 
shootings. Earlier on Monday evening, a teenager was wounded in the legs in the 
republican New Lodge area of north Belfast. On Sunday night, a man in his 20s 
was shot several times in the legs.

Newly re-elected assembly member Alex Attwood condemned the spate of violence 
in the city. “We must demonstrate the same resolve we did in the past – resist 
those who carry out these atrocities, who use guns to reject Irish democracy 
and ignore the rule of law,” the Social Democratic and Labour Party assembly 
member said.
