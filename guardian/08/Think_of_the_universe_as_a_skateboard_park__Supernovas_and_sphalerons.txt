Last week I spent a couple of days in Abingdon discussing particle physics, 
and specifically where we might be headed with the high-energy collision data 
from theLarge Hadron Collider 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/large-hadron-collider> (LHC) at CERN. 
Whatever it may be remembered for in terms of celebrity deaths and politics, 
2016 has been a great year for the LHC, with more collision data delivered than 
ever before, at the highest energy so far.

I shared a taxi from Didcot Parkway with John Ellis and Nick Mavromatos, two 
particle theorists from King’s College London (though John has spent much of 
his career at CERN). Whenever two or more scientists get together these days, 
they will discuss Brexit and/or Trump. But (probably desperate to change topic) 
we also talked about some relatively recent evidence for pieces of supernova 
impacting the Earth about 2.5 million years ago. This article is written in a 
similar spirit.

The supernova evidence was reported on by Tim Radford in April 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/06/radioactive-debris-from-supernova-blasts-discovered-in-ocean-crust>
, but John and colleagues wrote apaper <https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9605128> 
in 1996 suggesting the method that was used, and he has given talks on the 
whole area recently.

It is a marvellous fact that the heavy elements on Earth were all created in 
violent astrophysical cataclysms, but the story of this supernova is especially 
specific, because the actual atoms can be dated (at least statistically). An 
isotope of iron, Fe60, was measured at a particular depth in the ocean’s crust. 
The position in the crust sets the date, and the presence of the isotope 
betrays the supernova.

Sphalerons are very exotic, but they are a prediction of the Standard Model of 
particle physics

The word “isotope” comes from the Greek, “iso” meaning the same, and “topos” 
meaning place, because different isotopes of the same element occupy the same 
place in the periodic table. Atomic nuclei contain protons, with positive 
charge, and neutrons, which are neutral. Isotopes of an element differ from 
each other only by the number of neutrons. This has no effect on the chemical 
properties of the element, because it is the number of protons that determines 
the number electrons that must bind to it in a neutral atom, and the electrons 
in turn determine the chemistry. Hence the same slot in the periodic table.

The mass will be different though, and this can, with care, be measured. Also, 
since the neutrons are important in holding the nucleus together, many isotopes 
are unstable, and decay to lighter elements over times ranging from fractions 
of a second, to millions of years.

Iron has 26 protons, and the most stable, and therefore most common, isotopes 
of iron have between 28 and 32 neutrons. The “60” in Fe60 is there because it 
has 34 neutrons, making the total of neutrons plus protons equal to sixty – the 
atomic mass.

If you have a sample of Fe60, after 2.6 million years, half of it will have 
decayed. Since the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, any Fe60 it might have 
started with has long gone, and the abundances measured in a specific layer of 
the ocean crust can only have come from outer space. And they match the 
predictions Ellis and others made for delivery from a nearby (by astronomical 
standards) supernova, one which would have been easily visible, and perhaps as 
bright as the moon.

By particle physics standards, twenty years (1996 to 2016) between a 
prediction and a measurement isn’t too bad. The Higgs boson took nearly 50 
years, but the impact on physics of that discovery is still being felt. The 
meeting in Abingdon was full of examples of this impact, and one of them 
highlights another connection between things we can hold in our hands and 
potentially mind-blowing physics, over timescales much longer than 50 years, or 
even the millions of years since the supernova.

Could the Higgs boson have been discovered by accident?

This connection involves weird objects called sphalerons, and probably 
explains not just how the chemical elements got here, but how the particles 
they are made of – electrons, and the quarks inside the protons and neutrons – 
came to be. Every time I hear about them, I need to have sphalerons explained 
to me again, which is a sign that I don’t thoroughly understand them. But it 
goes something like this.

Sphalerons are very exotic, but they are a prediction of the Standard Model of 
particle physics, not something beyond it. And now we know the Higgs exists, we 
know they should exist too¹.

To get an idea of what a sphaleron is, you have to think of the way we 
describe particles, using something called ‘perturbation theory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2011/oct/11/1>’. Try 
this. Imagine the empty universe, with no energy, sitting at the bottom some of 
some valley, say on a skateboard park.

Adding a bit of energy corresponds to allowing skateboarders to zip up and 
down the sides. If the energy is small, they will roll back down again, go up 
the other side, and oscillate like that. These oscillations correspond to 
particles in perturbation theory, rippling along through space-time in their 
merry quantum way.

But if you add a lot of energy, the skateboarder can zip over the wall of the 
valley, into the next door valley on the park. That’s a sphaleron, sort of.

They would have been around in the early universe, because the energy density 
was very high then. And they seem to have played a crucial role, as follows: 
There are various things which don’t change in perturbation theory, things that 
are conserved. One thing, in our skateboard universe, is the average position 
of the boarders. They spend as much time on one side of the valley as they do 
on the other side; the average is the bottom of the valley.

But if a boarder sphalerons his or her way over the wall into the next valley, 
their average position has moved – to the centre of the next valley. The 
conservation law has been violated. Sphalerons in the early universe violate 
conservation laws too, and one that they violate is the number of particles². 
They can add more quarks and leptons to the universe. This is an essential part 
of how the stuff we are made of got here at all.

So not only are many of the heavier atomic nuclei around us made in 
supernovae, the electrons orbiting them are the result of sphalerons.

I’m aware that “think of the universe as a skateboard park” is a a bit Douglas 
Adams, but it’s the best I can do. And in difficult times, this kind of
interconnectedness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/jan/23/neutrinos-antimatter-and-science-as-a-holistic-detective-agency>
 can be strangely comforting.

¹We even know the energy at which they should exist – about 10 TeV. This is 
higher than we can observe in LHC collisions, because even though these go up 
to 13 TeV, the energy isshared between many quarks and gluons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/feb/21/what-goes-on-inside-a-proton>
, and so isnot all available 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2012/feb/18/1> for making 
new objects, but it is not ridiculously high.

² Strictly, the baryon number plus the lepton number number.
