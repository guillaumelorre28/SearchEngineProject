The force, it seems, was with Los Angeles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles>.

Star Wars creator George Lucas and his team chose LA over San Francisco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco> on Tuesday as the home of a 
museum that will showcase his life’s work and huge film history collection.

 After what organizers called “extensive due diligence and deliberation,” they 
announced that the museum will be built in Exposition Park in Los Angeles, 
where it will sit alongside other more traditional museums including the 
California Science Center and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.

 Lucas has been trying to build the museum, called The Lucas Museum of 
Narrative Art, for nearly a decade, and is financing the project by himself 
with plans to spend more than $1bn.

 It will house an extensive personal collection that includes 40,000 
paintings, illustrations and film-related items.

 The project became the subject of a rivalry between the two cities, with San 
Francisco offering Treasure Island in the middle of the bay as a home.

 “We have been humbled by the overwhelmingly positive support we received from 
both San Francisco and Los Angeles during our selection process,” the 
organizers said in a statement.

 Lucas has ties to both areas, and good reason to choose either. He is an 
alumnus of the film school at the University of Southern California, which is 
right across the street from the museum site, but he also has lived in the San 
Francisco Bay Area for most of his life.

 LA mayor Eric Garcetti said in a statement after the decision that “millions 
of Angelenos and visitors will enjoy an extraordinary collection anchored in 
storytelling – an art that carries so much meaning in the history and legacy of 
Los Angeles.”

 The museum gets its pick from about 30,000 film-related pieces including 
storyboards and costumes from The Wizard of Oz, Casablanca and of course Star 
Wars.
