Riddle me this: do you have what it takes to complete the Royal Statistical 
Society’s Christmas quiz?

It may not require specialist mathematical knowledge but the questions are a 
devilish test of general knowledge, lateral thinking and logic.

The RSS elf who delivered this year’s quiz gave us just one hint: the question 
titles “may help”.

The entrant (or team of entrants) with the most marks wins a one-year 
subscription to the society’s magazine,Significance 
<http://www.rss.org.uk/RSS/Publications/Significance/RSS/Publications/Significance_sub/Significance.aspx?hkey=b75bac40-bd86-4939-b3df-3c04d21481e4>
. Explanations of answers are required for full marks. In the case of a tie an 
additional question may be asked.

Answers should be sent by email (with the subject line “Christmas Quiz 2016”) 
toRSSQuiz@rss.org.uk <mailto:RSSQuiz@rss.org.uk> by 6pm GMT on Monday 9 January 
2017. The answers will be published in mid-January.

Until then, happy Christmas quizzing.
