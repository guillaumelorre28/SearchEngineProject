Your chariot may be about to swing low, or you might feel the need of your own 
version of the haka, there may even be flowers, thistles, dragons, wallabies or 
pumas involved. But whatever flag you’re flying during the Rugby World Cup, the 
passion, intensity and drama of the matches will mean you’ll need plenty of 
pit-stops. So we’ve rounded up the best places to drink and eat (usually on a 
budget) in most of the host venue cities.*

* Milton Keynes and Gloucester have yet to be fully covered in our budget eats 
and craft beer series. So, feel free to add recommendations in the comments for 
stop-offs in these destinations.

celebrations, commiserations and calories.

 Leicester curry houses: a taste of little India, with Marcel Theroux 
A trio of ties, on 4, 6 and 11 October will be staged at Leicester City’s 
stadium – and while it’s unclear whether the supporters of Argentina and Tonga 
will revel at the prospect of playing in the city that’s home to Walkers 
Crisps, it’s fairly likely they’ll be delighted at the dynamic and inexpensive 
range of eating establishments, particularly its famous curry houses.

Manchester
 Marble Arch 
There is just one match in Manchester but it features England (against 
Uruguay), so is sure to be a hot ticket. If hot food is what you’re after the 
city has a great selection of budget cafes, delis and restaurants, while a 
cooling beer can come from any number of craft and microbrews served in a city 
that knows its beer onions – if that’s even a thing.

South Africa v Scotland on 3 October kicks off the three matches at Newcastle 
United’s St James’ Park, with New Zealand v Tonga and Samoa v Scotland to

thrive, while our list of 10 great places for food under a tenner shows that 
quality doesn’t have to come at an inflated price.
