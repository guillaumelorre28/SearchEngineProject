To be or not to be. Not to be just yet, for hanging upside down inside my 
mother with my head pressed against her pelvis while getting repeatedly 
battered by Claude’s cock thrusting inside her isn’t what I call a meaningful 
existence. It’s enough to give a foetus a migraine. My mum is up to something. 
I’m sure of it. I can hear her plotting with Claude. As you may have guessed 
Claude is not my father. I’d recognise his cock anywhere. The shame of it.


“O that this too unsolid flesh would melt.”

They’re drinking again. If I’m going to get another hangover then I’d prefer a 
Chateau Elsinore rather than a cheap Sancerre. Claude and Trudy do a lot of 
drinking. Too much I’d say. Sometimes I think she isn’t the slightest bit 
bothered about me. I’ll give her a kick to remind her.

“The baby’s kicking again,” says Trudy.

“Not long now. We’ll soon be rid of it.” That’s Claude. “So here’s the plan. 
We invite my brother round for a drink and put some anti-freeze in a smoothie. 
Once he’s croaked I’ll get to keep the St John’s Wood house and we’ll be £7m to 
the good.”

My brother! That means Claude must be my uncle. That’s disgusting. God! What a 
piece of work is a man. And a woman for that matter. I’ve got to think of a way 
of putting an end to this.

“I’ll bide my time until vile Claude be pissed 
And passed out in Trudy’s incestuous bed.”


Let me tell you a bit about my dad. He’s called John. Yeah, I know you thought 
he was going to be called Ham but we’ve all had a few nasty surprises lately. 
So John writes and publishes poetry which basically means he’s broke. Apart 
from the St John’s Wood house which he inherited. And is now about to lose, 
along with his life if I’ve heard correctly. I really ought to do something 
about it.

“If I were man enough, I’d take revenge. 
Though p’raps tis best to give myself a break 
For I still lack sufficient evidence.”


The place is a dump. Trudy’s a complete slob. I don’t want to blame her too 
much as she’s only 28. She got married far too young and isn’t ready to settle 
down. Still, I do think she could make a bit of an effort for my arrival. She 
could get the Norwegian cleaners in.

There’s a ring on the doorbell. It’s my father with another woman.

“Hi Trudy,” he says. “This is Elodie. She’s a poet and we’re planning to get 
married. Don’t come over all surprised. I’ve known about you and Claude for a 
while. I’m sure you’ll be very happy together. So here’s the deal. You’ve got a 
month to get out of the house. I’ll be over tomorrow to sort out the details.”

What? My father’s got a girlfriend? I’m pretty sure that was never in the 
script. Everyone’s started to ad lib badly here. Nor did he even mention what 
was going to happen to me. Neither of them seem to want me. No wonder I’m 
having an existential crisis before I’m even born.

“Or could it be that I o’er think my life 
And take my torment far too personally 
From too much thought doth little action come 
Thus conscience makes cowards of us all. 
So man up, foetus, get thyself stuck in 
Remember this: I think, therefore I am.”

To cut a short story shorter. Claude and Trudy fucked and got pissed, before 
Claude went off to mix up the anti-freeze. The next day John came round and I’m 
moving and kicking as best I can to make Trudy think twice about offing him. No 
joy, Claude sneaks up and tips the poison in his ear. Just kidding. I shout 
‘Don’t drink it’ but no one hears. Next thing I know there’s a news item saying 
he’s been found dead on the M1. How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable seem to 
me all the uses of this world!

The police have come round. They haven’t arrested them yet but they don’t seem 
to be buying the suicide story. Can’t say I blame them. They’re getting pissed 
and fucking again. I’ve got a headache and bruises all over me. I’ve had 
enough, I’m going to hang myself with the umbilical cord.

“And when I die, make sure the whole world knows 
I was a decent bloke for the most part.”


I couldn’t go through with it. Claude and Trudy are planning to do a runner. 
They’re going to dump me. God, I don’t want to be alone in exile in Poland. I 
must do something.

“Get off thy butt, foetus! From this time forth 
My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.”


“Oh my God,” yells Trudy. “I’m giving birth.”

I just need to hang on till the police arrive. The rest is silence.

Digested read, digested: In utero veritas.
