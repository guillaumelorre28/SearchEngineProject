Route notes

A picturesque meander along disused railway lines and quiet country lanes, 
through the heart of the county's industrial heritage, which includes the 
former mining communities of Radstock and Kilmersdon. The route features works 
created by artists working with local schools based on Somerset's disappearing 
orchards, industrial heritage and physical geography, including work by Jerry 
Ortmans, Elizabeth Turrel and Imi Maufe.

Terrain and gradients

Some of the road sections can be quite hilly – particularly in Shoscombe. But 
most of the route is offroad, traffic-free and easy-going. There are some 
country lanes and a busy road in Radstock.

How to get there/away

The start is a few miles from Bath. Frome has a railway station.

What to see

Dundas aqueduct was built at the turn of the 19th century to carry the Kennet 
and Avon canal over the river Avon. Radstock has a museum showcasing its mining 
past. Frome is a vibrant market town. A plaque on the wall in Kilmersdon 
records the local belief that the nursery rhyme Jack and Jill is based on a 
local event that took place in 1697.

Watering holes

Several options in Radstock, Midford, Kilmersdon and Frome. Cyclists are 
always welcome at the Apple Tree Inn in Shoscombe.
