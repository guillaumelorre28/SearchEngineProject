“Oh the miserable and calamitous spectacle!” wrote John Evelyn in 1666, “mine 
eyes … now saw above 10,000 houses all in one flame.” The conflagration he 
witnessed from 2-5 September destroyed much of the medieval metropolis, 
swallowing 400 streets, 13,200 houses, 87 churches, and 44 livery halls.


Many of the City of London’s most iconic buildings were consumed: St Paul’s 
Cathedral, the Royal Exchange, Newgate Prison, Christ’s Hospital, even 
Whittington’s Longhouse, one of the biggest public toilets in Europe, in the 
Vintry. Evelyn was aghast at the destruction of so much of the medieval centre: 
“London was, but is no more”.

 Yet this wasn’t exactly true. By the time of the fire, only a quarter of 
London’s population actually lived in the walled city, compared to 
three-quarters a century earlier. The growing eastern suburbs like Wapping and 
Stepney were left unscathed – as were much of Holborn, the Temple, western 
Fleet Street, the Strand, and the emergent squares of the West End.

Nor, as contemporary scorch maps 
<http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/external/greatfiremap-l.jpg> reveal, did 
the fire even decimate the whole of the walled city: around four-fifths of it 
was destroyed (an area of 373 acres), leaving the north-eastern and some 
eastern parts (including the Tower of London) unaffected thanks to the gusty 
east wind.

 It was here, outside the fire’s trail of destruction, that many extraordinary 
buildings survived only to be destroyed later on – whether by demolition works, 
other fires, or bombs. As we reach the 350th anniversary of the fire, it is 
fitting to commemorate not just the buildings destroyed in those four hellish 
days in September, but also some of those that survived, only to vanish later 
on.

Castle Baynard

This riverside castle was built in the late 13th century, inheriting the name 
of a destroyed castle further to the west – the Tower of London’s lost twin – 
that had been built by the Norman Ralph Baynard after the Conquest. Many of 
Henry VIII’s wives lived here and, according to tradition, Richard of 
Gloucester was offered the crown here in 1483.


After several rebuilds, it appeared on the eve of the fire as a big, brooding 
stone structure with gabled projecting towers soaring from the Thames, a dock, 
thick curtain walls, central courtyard, and meaty turrets. The scene of lavish 
banquets and coronations, the castle was destroyed save for one round tower, 
later converted into a house, now vanished. Today, part of the site is occupied 
by a brutalist office block and commemorated by a blue plaque on Castle Baynard 
Street, just south of St Paul’s Cathedral.

Bridewell Palace

Built in 1515-20 on the western bank of the River Fleet near Blackfriars, this 
lost inner-city palace was one of Henry VIII’s favourites. It was a large, 
rambling brick structure set around three courtyards with gardens and a private 
wharf. An imposing feature of the riverfront, it was probably the scene of 
Catherine of Aragon’s final meeting with the king in 1529 (over a quarrelsome 
dinner).


 Under Henry’s son Edward VI, it became a poorhouse but was decimated on the 
third day of the Great Fire. The Fleet, contrary to expectations, proved no 
firebreak at all even though attempts were made to pull down the riverside 
houses. Something of the palace’s stateliness lives on in the Ionic columns of 
Unilever House, the art deco building that occupies the site today.

The Great Conduit

Advantageously located next to St Paul’s Cathedral and considerably grander 
and more spacious than the rest of the City’s labyrinthine streets, Cheapside – 
from the old Englishchepe (market) – was the undisputed high street of London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> before the fire. One of its most 
distinctive features, at the eastern end of the street, was the Great Conduit 
fountain, pictured here to the right of the Cheapside Cross.


From the 1230s to 1666, the Great Conduit channelled free water from the River 
Tyburn to Cheapside in lead pipes via the Strand and Fleet Street. Illegal 
siphoning was rife, reducing the water pressure – in Henry VI Part II, 
Shakespeare describes it as a “pissing-conduit” – and on the occasion of 
military victories, royal births and coronations, it sometimes ran with wine. 
As the fire spread, people dug desperately into the earth to puncture the 
conduit’s water supply, hoping the water might quench the flames – in vain – 
and the Great Conduit itself was razed to the ground along with Cheapside on 
Tuesday 4 September.

 St Paul’s Cathedral, ‘the wonder of medieval London’, as it looked before 
being burned down 
Gothic St Paul’s

Old St Paul’s was the wonder of medieval London. It was the fourth cathedral 
to stand on the site, built from Caen stone after the Norman Conquest, and 
finished in 1314. It was its monumental timber-and-lead spire that visitors 
noticed first (until it was struck by lightning in 1561), rising to 489 feet. 
Not until the BT Tower was built in 1964 would another building soar so high in 
London.

The remorselessly gothic exterior was much sterner than Christopher Wren’s 
neoclassical successor, with flying buttresses, pointed windows, and sharp 
turrets. As one of the biggest covered public spaces in London, a bazaar-like 
atmosphere prevailed inside, with lawyers tossing coins in the baptismal font, 
farmers’ wives selling fruit and ale, and apprentices shooting arrows at the 
jackdaws and pigeons in the rafters, smashing the holy windows. Riding high in 
the eastern wall was the famous rose window, bathing the high altar in 
kaleidoscopic light.

When St Paul’s burned down on the third day of the fire, a local thunderstorm 
broke out with forks of apocalyptic lightning radiating from the blazing 
building. Eventually, the roof melted, sending streams of molten lead pouring 
down Ludgate Hill “glowing with fiery redness” as people ran for their lives.

The Steelyard

“Foreigners are ill-regarded, not to say detested in London,” observed a 
Venetian visitor to the capital in 1617 – one reason, no doubt, the 400 German 
merchants of the Hanseatic League (an economic alliance of German cities) lived 
a sequestered life in the Steelyard. This motley collection of wharves, 
storehouses, a tavern, guildhall, mint, chapel, and lodgings – all engirdled by 
a stone wall – amounted to a mini city-within-a-city.

Since the early 13th century, successive kings allowed the foreign merchants 
to trade freely in England, immune from rent and taxation in exchange for 
surrendering their vessels in wartime. Their complex was razed to the ground in 
1666, by which point they had lost most of their privileges after the jealous 
city guilds expressed anger regarding them towards Queen Elizabeth I. Today, 
its memory is effaced by Cannon Street Station.

The Royal Exchange 

This vast, open-air trading piazza was the brainchild of the merchant Thomas 
Gresham. Christened the Royal Exchange by Queen Elizabeth I in 1571, it became 
the epicentre of England’s burgeoning trading empire, emitting onto Cornhill 
“an incessant buzz, like the murmurs of a distant ocean”. Along its colonnaded 
walks and finely pebbled courtyard, merchants from all over the world, 
customers and suppliers would meet twice a day to seal deals that would send 
ships to the four corners of the world.

It was a broad, four-storey building with fine shops in its upper galleries, 
and a bell tower surmounted by a large grasshopper, the emblem of the Gresham 
family. Watching from niches above the colonnade were statues of all the 
English kings and queens since William the Conqueror.

The Great Fire swept through the Exchange on 3 September, filling the 
courtyard with “sheets of fire” and sending the kings and queens plummeting 
from their niches, smashing to pieces below. As a totem of England’s commercial 
prowess, the Exchange was swiftly rebuilt after the fire, opening in 1669. But 
this, too, was destroyed by fire in 1838, and the site is currently occupied by 
a third exchange.

Nonsuch House

This wildly eccentric, gaudily painted, meticulously carved Renaissance palace 
was the jewel in the crown of London Bridge. Made entirely from wood it was 
prefabricated in Holland and erected in 1577-79, replacing the medieval 
drawbridge gate. At four storeys it was the biggest building on the bridge, 
straddling the whole street and lurching over the Thames, affording its 
illustrious occupants spectacular views of the metropolis. Its tulip-bulb 
cupolas were admired from miles around and there was truly nonsuch like this 
architectural mongrel anywhere else in London.

The fire only consumed a modern block of houses at the northern end of London 
Bridge, separated from the rest by a gap, and so Nonsuch House, built on the 
7th and 8th arches from the Southwark end, happily survived – only to be 
dismantled with the rest of the houses a hundred years later.

The White Hart pub

This old inn is a sad – and relatively recent – loss. Originally a 
14th-century tavern harangued by the cries of the insane from the hospital of 
Bethlem next door, it was rebuilt in 1480 as one of Bishopsgate’s galleried 
coaching inns catering for a transient population of travellers, traders, 
actors, prostitutes and pilgrims. It had bulging bay windows, a profusion of 
tiny window panes, and central archway leading into the courtyard with “1480” 
proudly inscribed above.

Escaping the fire, it was completely rebuilt in a mellower Georgian style in 
1829, all stucco and sash windows, only to be demolished in recent years to 
make way for a brash, nine-storey cylindrical block of offices and shops, set 
to open in December 2016. Rather absurdly, the old pub’s facade will be 
preserved and grafted onto the new building, rubbing Londoners’ faces in their

Northumberland House

Built in 1605, this lion-topped Jacobean palace was once an imposing feature 
of Charing Cross, by the equestrian statues of Charles I from 1675. It belonged 
to the illustrious earls and dukes of Northumberland, perfectly located to 
attend court and parliament. It was originally one of a parade of gilded 
medieval and Tudor riverside palaces, of which only Somerset House survives 
today, albeit rebuilt, but giving a sense of their former grandeur. The 
westernmost point of the fire’s trail of destruction was Fetter Lane, saving 
Northumberland House – but, shamefully, it was demolished in 1874 after the 
Metropolitan Board of Works paid its final duke a small fortune to move out so 
they could build Northumberland Avenue.

Paul Pindar’s House

Around 1600, the wealthy merchant and diplomat Paul Pindar returned from Italy 
and built “a very commodious mansion” on Bishopsgate Street Without, a pleasant 
stretch just beyond the City walls. It had a richly carved oak facade, with 
gradually protruding bays meeting in a turret-like shape at the front, and tiny 
panes of glass with fine patterning. Lying in the north-east corner of the 
City, it emerged unscathed in the fire and, sub-divided, part of it became a 
tavern in the 18th century, the Sir Paul Pindar’s Head. It fell victim to the 
expansion of the Great Eastern Railway in 1890 – but part of the façade is 
preserved today in all its meticulously-carved glory in the V&A Museum.

The crooked townhouse on Fleet Street

On the north side of Fleet Street, the fire didn’t manage to vault Fetter 
Lane. If it had, then this wonderfully overwrought four-storey townhouse 
bulging over the corner of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street, depicted by the 
antiquarian engraver John Thomas Smith in 1789, would almost certainly have 
been lost. “Antiquity Smith” had a keen eye for the vanishing city – the house 
was removed 10 years later. Today a tasteful, but less characterful, auburn 
Victorian building occupies the site.

The Cock and Magpie Tavern

One of a cluster of old houses in Drury Lane – which was far west enough not 
to be threatened by the fire – this beguiling gabled building wasn’t destroyed 
until 1882. For most of its life, it housed the Cock and Magpie pub which, 
according to the Society for Photographing Relics of Old London in 1880, was 
nearly 400 years old (though this is questionable). In its twilight years, it 
became a bookshop.

The Savoy hospital

From 1512, this was a grand hospital within the stout, battlemented walls of 
the ruined Savoy Palace, magnificently built by Peter of Savoy but burned down 
in the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381. At sunset each night, poor pilgrims, strangers 
and children would stream in to pray, wash, sleep and perhaps consult a 
physician or surgeon. An initiative of Henry VII, the hospital was re-founded 
by Mary I, and enlarged by Queen Elizabeth I.

It survived the Great Fire, but had ceased to be an operative paupers’ 
hospital by that stage (serving mainly as a military barracks), and was in 
ruins by 1800 following a fire. The site was cleared in 1816-20 and, since the 
1880s, has been a theatre and uber-exclusive hotel, retaining something of the 
Savoy Palace’s earlier hauteur. Today, only the hospital’s stone chapel 
survives, adrift in a sea of office blocks.
 14-15 Nevill’s Court, Fetter Lane 
Pre-fire houses in Nevill’s Court

Nevill’s Court was a narrow alley off the east side of Fetter Lane, named 
after Ralph Neville, the Bishop of Chichester who had a London mansion here in 
the 1220s. The court once contained one of London’s best-kept secrets: a 
cluster of houses with picturesque overhanging storeys and plastered walls, 
replete with small, fenced-off gardens. These houses escaped the fire by the 
skin of their teeth – but were then destroyed in the early 20th century. 
Photographs survive thanks to the London Topographical Society who, spurred on 
by the “practical rebuilding” of London from the mid-Victorian period, captured 
old buildings on the brink of oblivion.

The glass and gargoyle mansion

Fashionable glazed windows were something of a luxury in Elizabethan London, 
and at a time when so many dwellings had only a cloth or greased paper behind a 
lattice to let light in, this timber-framed mansion in Crutched Friars, to the 
north of the Tower of London was a work of almost criminal ostentation. It was 
made almost entirely from glass, with the load-bearing beams adorned with 
particularly hideous gargoyles as a foil to the beauty of the glass. Just three 
streets separated it from the limits of Fire’s trail of destruction to the 
east. It was dismantled at the end of the 18th century, having become an 
antiquated curiosity.

How London might have looked: five masterplans after the great fire

Constructed to the designs of Inigo Jones in the 1640s, Shaftesbury House on 
Aldersgate Street was “built in brick, and ornamented with stone in a most 
noble and elegant manner.” Its eight Ionic pilasters and very large windows 
added gravitas, making it a fitting residence for the Earl of Shaftesbury, who 
lends the building its name.

In later years it was a tavern, lying-in hospital, general dispensary, and 
finally shops. It owed its Great Fire survival to the city walls at Aldersgate 
– but it was unceremoniously ripped down in 1882. Now a barren, unlovely 
stretch pounded by traffic, 17th-century Aldersgate was once reckoned the most 
Italianate street in London, with harmonious buildings and a graceful width.
