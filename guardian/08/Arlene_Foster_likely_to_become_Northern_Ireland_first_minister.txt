The prospect of Stormont’s finance minister, Arlene Foster, becoming the first 
female leader of the Democratic Unionist party and first minister ofNorthern 
Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> has increased after 
her potential main rival announced he would not be standing for either post.

The East Antrim MP, Sammy Wilson, confirmed on Wednesday that he would not be 
running for the leadership of the DUP – the region’s largest political party.

Wilson said that it was “in the best interests of the party” that he did not 
enter the contest.

So far Foster is the only declared candidate to lead the DUP and become first 
minister.

Commenting on Wilson’s announcement, Foster said: “We will still hopefully 
work together as a team and that is certainly my wish for the future.”

The outgoing first minister and DUP leader, Peter Robinson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/peter-robinson>, who announced his 
intention to stand down from both posts, tweeted this week: “Arlene’s 
nomination was submitted with the support of over 75% of those entitled to vote 
in the electoral college.”

With such a heavy endorsement from DUP members it is now virtually certain the 
former Ulster Unionist and Fermanagh-born barrister will become the new leader 
and in turn will be elected first inister in the Northern Ireland assembly.
