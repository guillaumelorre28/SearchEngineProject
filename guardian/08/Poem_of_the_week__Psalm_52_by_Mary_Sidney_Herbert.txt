Psalm 52

Tyrant, why swell’st thou thus,
  Of mischief vaunting?
 Since help from God to us
 Is never wanting.

Lewd lies thy tongue contrives,
 Loud lies it soundeth;
Sharper than sharpest knives
 With lies it woundeth.

Falsehood thy wit approves,
 All truth rejected:
Thy will all vices loves,
 Virtue neglected.

Not words from cursed thee,
 But gulfs are poured;
Gulfs wherein daily be
 Good men devoured.

Think’st thou to bear it so?
 God shall displace thee;
God shall thee overthrow,
 Crush thee, deface thee.

The just shall fearing see
 These fearful chances,
And laughing shoot at thee
 With scornful glances.

Lo, lo, the wretched wight,
 Who God disdaining,
His mischief made his might,
 His guard his gaining.

I as an olive tree
 Still green shall flourish:
God’s house the soil shall be
 My roots to nourish.

My trust in his true love
 Truly attending,
Shall never thence remove,
 Never see ending.

Thee will I honour still,
 Lord, for this justice;
There fix my hopes I will
 Where thy saints’ trust is.

Thy saints trust in thy name,
 Therein they joy them:
Protected by the same,
 Naught can annoy them.

Mary Sidney Herbert 
<https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/mary-sidney-herbert>
, Countess of Pembrokeshire (1561-1621), was a major poet: the fact that she 
inherited great wealth and privilege shouldn’t discolour our vision of her 
achievement. While “fitting the approved categories for women – elegy, encomium 
and translation <http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/sidney/pembroke_biography.htm>”, 
her output also challenged and expanded them. Her work influenced many writers 
who succeeded her,including William Shakespeare 
<http://www2.cedarcrest.edu/academic/eng/lfletcher/ac/jruhnke.htm>.

Mary is probably best known today for her metrical versions of the psalms – 
likethis week’s poem 
<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+52&version=GNV>. The 
project was originally that of her elder brother, Philip Sidney, and it was 
part of a wider Protestant movement to make the sacred texts available and 
accessible in the English vernacular. After Philip’s death, Mary revised some 
of his versions, and added a mass of new material, from Psalms 44 to 150.The 
Geneva Bible <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Bible> was her most 
important source, and it’s likely that, as a classical scholar, she would have 
consulted Latin translations by the theologianTheodore Beza 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Beza>. She used more than 120 different 
verse forms, and sometimes wove allusions to her own current political and 
personal concerns into the songs of David. Her psalms never sound like 
translations: they ring out as original poems in their own right.

The quatrains of Psalm 52 follow an ABAB-rhymed pattern of iambic trimeter 
alternating with dimeter, and the dimeter line always has a feminine ending. 
This ending often comprises a two- or three-syllable word, although in the last 
two stanzas the rhyme is strung almost lightheartedly over separate words 
(justice/trust is, joy them/annoy them). The effect of the rhyme scheme overall 
is vigorous and angry. David’s song itself is a cry of rage, a denunciation of 
the murderous treachery ofDoeg the Edomite 
<http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/hpalmer/psalms/ps-052.txt>. Mary 
Sidney Herbert’s canvas is smaller, but the rage is pointed by rhetorical 
flourishes that, working with the rhyme and metre, increase the piquancy of 
tone. She was trained inthe art of rhetoric 
<https://outre-monde.com/2011/01/16/a-short-glossary-of-rhetorical-and-poetic-devices/>
, and her use of anaphora, epistrophe, polyptoton, et al, is elegant – but 
never merely elegant.

Her creative approach to translation is revealed not only in her syntax but in 
her choice of figure: for example in verse two, she prefers “knives” to the 
Geneva translators’ “razor” and vividly evokes an image of vicious tongues 
metamorphosing into reddened blades. And then the metaphor is brilliantly 
expanded: “words” themselves are imagined as “gulfs,” an image not in the 
Geneva translation. The “gulfs are poured” suggesting a primary metaphor of 
water, but also retain the sense of “gulf” as a moral abyss separating truth 
and falsehood.

The tone softens noticeably in the eighth verse, where David has accomplished 
the transition from uttering his hatred of Doeg to expressing his love of God 
through the salving metaphor of the young olive tree rooted in nourishing soil. 
Now Mary seems to summon the tone and language of the love poem: “My trust in 
his true love / Truly attending, / Shall never thence remove, / Never see 
ending.” This recalls Philip’s well known and lovelySong from Arcadia 
<https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/45169>, and, 
more significantly, it looks forward, I think, to George Herbert’s 
constructions of a God almost as intimately knowable to the human soul as a 
lover, parent, child or favourite dinner guest might be. George Herbert was 
distantly related to Mary, and one ofthe extended family of younger writers to 
whom she was materfamilias

.

As for any political or personal subtext in Psalm 52, I am unqualified to 
pursue that line of questioning, and confident, in any case, that the poem 
stands perfectly happily without it. But, of course, it would still be 
fascinating to know if the poet had some Doeg-like character at the back of her 
mind, adding ire to her wit as she worked on the psalm. The original Doeg seems 
to have been an interesting type of villain, a great scholar but a jealous and 
insecure man who turned to treachery and murder. There must have been a number 
of Doegs in the courts and households Mary frequented. Public life is their 
natural habitat, after all. There they perennially flourish, and the eventual 
triumph of justice over calumny is rarely as predictable as it is for the 
psalm-makers.
