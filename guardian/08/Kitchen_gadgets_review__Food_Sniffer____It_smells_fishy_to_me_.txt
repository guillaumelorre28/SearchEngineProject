What?

The Food Sniffer (£105, myfoodsniffer.com) <http://myfoodsniffer.com/buy.html>
: organic chemical sensors housed in a plastic baton. Detects molecular 
decomposition in meat and fish.

Why?

What the nose knows isn’t good enough.

Well?

Oh, what’s that old joke? “My dog’s got no nose.” “How does he smell other 
dogs’ anuses?” “He obviously can’t, you insensitive arsehole.” (I may have 
misremembered the details.) It’s not just tragic, hypothetical dogs that will 
benefit from this device, a portable electronic nose that does your sniffing 
for you. Pointed at a piece of meat, it sends a reading to your phone that 
advises whether the food is fresh, spoiling or ready for your neighbour’s bin.


It works by detecting temperature, humidity and ammonia levels, among others. 
(“Volatile organic compound sensor” may sound like vague science guff lifted 
from a Star Trek script, but these evaporating chemicals are what odours are 
made of. They’re what we smell when we smell smells.) The device resembles a 
universal remote or, with its nozzle attached, an obstetric sonography tool. 
The point and click function works easily.

However, the necessity of setting up a personal profile on the app feels, 
well, nosy. How do someone’s age, job and address affect whether their chicken 
nuggets are on the turn? Can a 25-year-old mechanic from Prestatyn eat a 
four-day-old rogan josh? Does lamb stay fresh for longer if you’re an Estuary 
actuary in her late 50s? It smells fishy to me.

 ‘Out of curiosity, I point the e-nose at myself and press the button …’

Food Sniffer has settings for beef, chicken, lamb, fish and seafood, but only 
in their raw state. (I spend most time sniffing leftovers, or spitting out 
fizzy hummus.) Also: the name. Is there a less sensually appealing verb than 
“sniffing”? Maybe farting or tidying or forgetting, but I’m not sure.

The innovation is clearly useful – some gases are odourless, invisible to the 
naked nose. You can be too careful though, can’t you? Out of curiosity, I point 
the e-nose at myself and press the button. The remote silently probes my gases, 
before a red warning appears. “Do not eat! It is dangerous to eat this chicken 
as the spoilage process started some time ago.” I mean, damn. I’m not saying 
it’s wrong, but sometimes it’s better not to know.

Any downside?

Weirdly, the box proclaims “the new era of scents”. Wrong side of history, 
mate. This is the age of non-sense.

Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard?

A cautious yes, but the name is consigned to a bucket of noes.
