Donald Trump made a half-hearted attempt to distance himself from Russia’s 
president, Vladimir Putin, on Friday night at a rally in Florida, but aimed 
inflammatory comments at Iran and his political opponentHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>.

He said Clinton could select someone in the Pensacola bay center, shoot him or 
her in the heart, and get away without prosecution. “She’s trigger happy,” he 
said. “I think she’s an unstable person.”


“She could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody, with 20,000 
people watching, right smack in the heart and still not be prosecuted,” he said.

Trump has previously spoken of his own ability to “shoot somebody” and not 
lose any voters. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/24/donald-trump-says-he-could-shoot-somebody-and-still-not-lose-voters>

He also vowed retaliation against Iran if its vessels harassed the US Navy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/uss-nitze-us-navy-encounter>.

“When they circle our beautiful destroyers, with their little boats and they 
make gestures at our people, that they shouldn’t be allowed to make, they will 
be shot out of the water,” he said.

His comment follows reports last month that four Iranian military vessels sped 
close to a US navy guided missile destroyer with their weapons uncovered in the 
Strait of Hormuz in an “unsafe and unprofessional” encounter, according to a US 
defense official.

The USS Nitze shot warning flares, sounded its whistles and attempted 
unsuccessfully to communicate with the Iranian boats during Tuesday’s incident, 
the official told Agence France-Presse on condition of anonymity.

The vessels harassed the destroyer by “conducting a high-speed intercept and 
closing within a short distance of Nitze, despite repeated warnings”, the 
official said.

On Putin, Trump struck a milder tone at the rally. “I don’t know the 
gentleman. He’s nice to me,” he said. “But if he’s nice to me it doesn’t mean 
anything unless we make some great deals for our country.”

Trump’s comments followed a series of embarrassing links to the Kremlin, 
including an appearance by Trump on a Russian state propaganda television 
channel, where Trump defended Putin and criticized US foreign policy.

Trump’s campaign later said television personality Larry King 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/larry-king-got-225000-to-interview-viktor-yanukovychs-pm-says-ukraine-politician>
 had somehow tricked the candidate into accidentally appearing on the Russian 
channel. But Trump’s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, called Putin a 
“stronger leader” than Barack Obama.

“If we got along with Russia, that wouldn’t be so bad,” Trump said Friday 
night. And he issued a warm welcome toRussia

The crowd loved it: if Trump country has a heart, it beats in Pensacola, 
Florida <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida>.

Unlike southern Florida, the Panhandle is solidly Republican. It’s less pastel 
and more camouflage, surrounded by air force and naval bases.

The last time Trump appeared in Pensacola he booked the same arena, and filled 
it with about 13,000 people. He claimed at the time that his staff had turned 
away another 5,000 people standing outside, and he promised to return.

On Friday he packed the arena a second time.

Outside, an enormous red billboard stood over the parking lot and read, 
“Pensacola welcomes Trump.” In tiny lettering at the bottom it read, “Not 
affiliated with any campaign organization.” Trump enjoyed the sign enough to 
post a picture of it on Twitter.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
Wow - thank you Pensacola, FL. See you Friday at 7pm -- join me!

A woman who answered the phone at Bill Salter Outdoor Advertising in Milton, 
Florida, said Salter, who owns the board, had taken out the ad himself.

Trump supporter Dom Howard, who rode his bicycle to the rally, said of 
Clinton: “She doesn’t shave her arms and legs, and she’s sick. She’s going to 
die. She’s having seizures on TV.”

Inside, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, former director of the Defense 
Intelligence Agency, stepped up to the podium to warm up the crowd: “A shout 
out to the military families,” he started. Then “a shout out to our law 
enforcement professionals”, and finally “to that beautiful flag up there on the 
wall ... we must respect our flag.”

Rudy Giuliani emerged next and set the tone. He went after Hillary Clinton, 
mocking her recent interviewwith television host Matt Lauer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-clinton-foreign-policy-forum-key-quotes>
.

“she should have been facing a grand jury, not Matt Lauer!” he said. 

To the crowd’s delight he extolled Trump’s pledge to build up the military. 
“That’s why he’s not afraid to talk to Putin, because he can negotiate from 
strength,” Giuliani said.

It appears to make little political sense for Trump to campaign in his most 
devoted quarter, at this point in the race. Most candidates, traditionally, 
would be drumming up votes in areas more likely swing blue or red — Iowa, or 
Ohio, or even other parts of Florida.

But Trump’s methods continue to defy political gravity. Since his foray last 
week into truly oppositional and voteless territory –across the border to Mexico
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration>
 – his poll numbers have steadily risen, and they now show him nearly even with 
Clinton.

One group of supporters did not make a return to Friday’s rally: the singing, 
dancing girl group called Freedom Kids. Their song during his last visit to 
Pensacola became a hit on social media, with lyrics including:

Enemies of freedom

Face the music – come on boys, take ’em down!

President Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> knows 
how

to make America great

Deal from strength or get crushed

every time

But now the group’s manager and one girl’s father, Jeff Popick, allege Trump 
“played” the girls and didn’t pay them. Last week he filed suit against the 
campaign, seeking $5,000 to $15,000.

The Trump camp has not responded publicly to the suit, but it has 20 days from 
the receiving it to respond, according to the girls’ lawyer.
