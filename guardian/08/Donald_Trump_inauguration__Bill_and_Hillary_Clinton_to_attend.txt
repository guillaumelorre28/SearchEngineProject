Bill and Hillary Clinton plan to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration in a 
decision that will putHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> on the stage as her 
bitter rival from the 2016 campaign assumes the office she long sought.

The Clintons announced their decision to attend the ceremony on 20 January 
shortly after former president George W Bush’s office said on Tuesday he would 
attend along with former first lady Laura Bush.

The Bushes are “pleased to be able to witness the peaceful transfer of power – 
a hallmark of American democracy – and swearing-in of President Trump and 
Vice-President Pence,” Bush’s office said in a statement.

It is traditional for former presidents and their spouses to attend the 
inauguration. But the decision to attend was fraught for the Clintons, given 
Hillary Clinton’s bitter campaign against Trump. The 2016 Democratic 
presidential nominee has largely avoided public appearances sinceTrump defeated 
her in November

Bush, too, has had a difficult relationship with Trump. His brother Jeb ran 
against Trump

 in the GOP primaries. George and Laura Bush let it be known they voted for 
“none of the above” for president rather than cast a ballot for Trump, but the 
ex-president did call to congratulate Trump after his victory.

Former president Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, earlier said they 
planned to attend Trump’s inauguration.

Former president George H W Bush, 92, and his wife, Barbara, do not plan to 
attend the inauguration due to the former president’s age and health, his 
office said.
