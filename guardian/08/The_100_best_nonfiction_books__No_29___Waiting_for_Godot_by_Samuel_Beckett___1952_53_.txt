Waiting for Godot was not just a two-act play in which, as one wit put it, 
“nothing happens, twice” 
<http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1709-waiting-for-godot-has-achieved-a-theoretical-impossibility-a-play-in>
, it was a theatrical revolution, the beginning of the theatre of the absurd. 
Together with some essential volumes of poetry (see Nos4

), this extraordinary drama would not only exert a profound influence on the 
postwar imagination, it would provide a metaphor for existence. Arguably, the 
great plays and poetry identified by this series transcend their genres to 
contribute tangibly to our sense of “who we are”, the guiding principle of this 
list. (I will return to the contentious question of what exactly the non-genre 
of nonfiction really is. That, of course, is where the trouble starts. Fiction 
is a genre. Nonfiction is a library convention; its definition is nebulous. 
Perhaps by the time this list is complete we’ll have a better idea about its 
constituent elements.)

Thus, from the moment Vladimir and Estragon step on to an empty stage 
furnished with nothing more than a bare tree and utter the famous opening line: 
“Nothing to be done”, the audience is pitched into a world in which the idea of 
boredom becomes a prolonged metaphor about the nature of existence, a strangely 
entertaining and finally moving “tragicomedy” (the author’s description) 
sustained by two tramps in vaudeville costume and the ever-absent “Mr Godot.”

The circumstances of Waiting for Godot are bleak, but the experience for the 
audience can be of optimism, often hilarity

The author of En Attendant Godot was certainly a member of the European avant 
garde, but an unlikely theatrical innovator. Beckett had never written a staged 
play before. Born in Dublin on Good Friday, 1906, Beckett had moved to Paris as 
a young man to sit at the feet of James Joyce, whose secretary and amanuensis 
he briefly became.

Between the wars, Beckett developed his genius as a writer in the shadow of 
modernism and, closer to home,Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. His first novel, 
Murphy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/17/100-best-novels-murphy-samuel-beckett-no-61-observer-guardian>
, rejected many times, was finally published in 1938, coincidentally the same 
year asScoop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/10/100-best-novels-scoop-evelyn-waugh-robert-mccrum>
 (Evelyn Waugh) andThe Code of the Woosters (PG Wodehouse). It opened with a 
brilliantly alienated first line – “The sun shone, having no alternative, on 
the nothing new” – puzzled a lot of reviewers, was praised by Dylan Thomas and 
sold very badly.

Then the war came, and the Nazi panzers rolled into Paris. Beckett fled south 
and lived for part of the war as a near vagrant and possible resistance 
fighter, in and around Roussillon. Returning to Paris after the liberation in 
1944, he published a brilliant trilogy (Molloy, Malone Dies, The Unnamable) and 
established a modest reputation as a writer’s writer, an avant gardist with a 
quirky wit.

He wrote En Attendant Godot in French and it received its premiere in Paris at 
the Théâtre de Babylone on 5 January 1953 [see chronological note, below]. The 
common view that it flopped is disputed by the record. James Knowlson’s and 
Deidre Bair’s biographies (Damned to Fame 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/damned-to-fame.html> (1996) and Samuel 
Beckett: A Biography 
<https://www.waterstones.com/book/samuel-beckett/deirdre-bair/9780671691738> 
(1978) confirm that, actually, the play, which was produced on a shoestring 
with a scratch cast, did quite well, with some favourable reviews.

The text of the play, now in Beckett’s translation, crossed the Channel and 
landed on the desk ofyoung director Peter Hall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/24/theatre.beckettat100> who, 
admitting that he hadn’t “the foggiest idea” what it meant, produced it at the 
Arts Theatre, London in August 1955. Almost immediately, the two most 
influential London critics,Kenneth Tynan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/jan/10/theatre2> (the Observer) and 
Harold Hobson (theSunday Times) hailed it as a masterpiece.

Within the decade, Beckett was established as the most innovative, radical and 
important English-language playwright of the century, one of the founding 
fathers of the theatre of the absurd. Eventually, his work would profoundly 
influence the work of Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, David Mamet and Sam Shepard, 
among many others.

The circumstances of Waiting for Godot are bleak and existential, but the main 
characters, “Didi” and “Gogo”, exhibit a manic energy and utter dialogue of 
such entrancing polyphony, laced with moments of profound and resonant silence, 
that the experience for the audience can be a mood of optimism and often 
hilarity. Beckett’s vision might be dark, but his touch is supremely light. 
Some snatches of the dialogue are more Laurel and Hardy than Kafka:

VLADIMIR: I don’t understand. 
ESTRAGON: Use your intelligence, can’t you? 
Vladimir uses his intelligence. 
VLADIMIR: (finally) I remain in the dark.

Tellingly, his characters acknowledge their part in the illusion of action 
that’s unfolding in front of us:

ESTRAGON: We always find something, eh Didi, to give us the impression we 
exist?
VLADIMIR: Yes, yes, we’re magicians.

The tramps also delight in teasing each other, and the audience, with their 
predicament:

ESTRAGON: I can’t go on like this.
VLADIMIR: That’s what you think.

Time hangs both light and heavy. Occasionally, the waiting becomes too much. 
Pozzo, who has gone blind in the course of the action, can stand it no longer:

Samuel Beckett, the maestro of failure

<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jul/07/samuel-beckett-the-maestro-of-failure>
POZZO: (suddenly furious.) Have you not done tormenting me with your accursed 
time! It’s abominable! When! When! One day, is that not enough for you, one day 
he went dumb, one day I went blind, one day we’ll go deaf, one day we were 
born, one day we shall die, the same day, the same second, is that not enough 
for you? (Calmer.) They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an 
instant, then it’s night once more.

Later, towards the end of act two, Vladimir, the more reflective of the two 
tramps, will pick up this speech, and play with it in another passage of great 
beauty characteristic of Beckett’s prose:

Astride of a grave and a difficult birth. Down in the hole, lingeringly, the 
grave-digger puts on the forceps. We have time to grow old. The air is full of 
our cries. (He listens.) But habit is a great deadener.

For Beckett, the examined life is both the beginning, and the end, of the 
human comedy:

VLADIMIR: What do they say?
ESTRAGON: They talk about their lives.
VLADIMIR: To have lived is not enough for them.
ESTRAGON: They have to talk about it.

Waiting for Godot has been debated about for more than 60 years now. The 
elusive Godot himself, most notably, has been the object of intense, and 
occasionally deranged, speculation. Beckett was offhand about his “meaning”. In 
Deidre Bair’s controversial biography, he is quoted, saying that it would be 
“fatuous of me to pretend that I am not aware of the meanings attached to the 
word ‘Godot’, and the opinion of many that it means ‘God’.” He was, however, 
insistent that “I wrote the play in French, and if I did have that meaning in 
my mind, it was somewhere in my unconscious and I was not overtly aware of it.”

For such speculation, Beckett has an answer, in one of Vladimir’s great 
speeches:

VLADIMIR: Let us not waste time in idle discourse! (Pause. Vehemently.) Let us 
do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. 
Not indeed that we personally are needed. Others would meet the case equally 
well, if not better. To all mankind they were addressed, those cries for help 
still ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all 
mankind is us, whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it, before it 
is too late! Let us represent worthily for once the foul brood to which a cruel 
fate consigned us! What do you say? (Estragon says nothing.) It is true that 
when with folded arms we weigh the pros and cons we are no less a credit to our 
species. The tiger bounds to the help of his congeners without the least 
reflection, or else he slinks away into the depths of the thickets. But that is 
not the question. What are we doing here, that is the question. And we are 
blessed in this, that we happen to know the answer. Yes, in the immense 
confusion one thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to come –

And of course, at the end of act two, with no sign of Godot, none of this has 
come to anything.

VLADIMIR: Well ? Shall we go ?
ESTRAGON: Yes, let’s go.
They do not move.

Chronological note: Beckett’s original French text was composed between 
October 1948 and January 1949. On 17 February 1952, an abridged version of the 
play was performed in a Paris recording studio and broadcast on French radio. 
Beckett sent an introductory note in which he confessed: “I don’t know who 
Godot is”, but did not himself turn up. The French (Editions Minuit) text 
appeared in print on 17 October 1952 in advance of the play’s first unabridged 
theatrical performance. This premiere of Beckett’s French version took place on 
5 January 1953 in the Théâtre de Babylone, Paris. Beckett’s English translation 
of his play was published during 1954 by the Grove Press, in the US. The first 
English language version of Waiting for Godot was premiered in London in 1955 
at the ArtsTheatre <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre>, and was 
subsequently published in the UK by Faber & Faber in 1956.
