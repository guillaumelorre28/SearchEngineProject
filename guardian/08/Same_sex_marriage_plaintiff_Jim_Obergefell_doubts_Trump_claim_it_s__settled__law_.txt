One of the plaintiffs in the landmark US marriage equality case doubts Donald 
Trump’s assurances that same-sex marriage is “settled law” that will not be 
revisited by the supreme court.

In comments to the Guardian, Jim Obergefell, who is in Australia to promote 
his co-authored bookLove Wins 
<http://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/books/article82542502.html> about 
the case and its plaintiffs, also weighed into the Australian debate, warning 
against a popular vote that would allow a majority to deny the minority the 
right to same-sex marriage.

Trump told CBS’s 60 Minutes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/trump-supreme-court-abortion-same-sex-marriage>
 that he was “fine” with marriage equality “because it was already settled”, in 
comments in his first TV interview as US president-elect, aired on Sunday 
evening.

Asked whether he supported same-sex marriage, which was made law by the 
supreme court in Obergefell v Hodges in 2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/26/gay-marriage-legal-supreme-court>
, Trump suggested the case did not concern him to the degree of the abortion 
case Roe v Wade.

“It’s irrelevant,” he said, “Because it was already settled. It’s law. It was 
settled in the supreme court. I mean it’s done.”

“It’s hard to say exactly what Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> truly believes, because he 
changes his story, left and right all the time,” Obergefell said.

“That’s a concern right there: does he really mean that, or is that what came 
out of mouth at that moment?”

Obergefell said Trump would “still nominate those opposed to marriage 
equality”.

“In general it’s a risk that those he would nominate, by virtue of their 
overall beliefs and judgments, would be those opposed to marriage equality and 
open to overturning it,” he said. “It’s part and parcel of the types of 
justices he would nominate.”

Obergefell said his biggest concern was that the vice-president-elect, Mike 
Pence <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence>, “is the most anti-LGBT 
politician I can think of”.

“I highly doubt that Pence will let this issue lie, he will do everything he 
can to deny our rights, to take back rights we’ve won, and to overturn marriage 
equality.”

Pence, the Indiana governor, has opposed same-sex marriage 
<http://time.com/4406337/mike-pence-gay-rights-lgbt-religious-freedom/> 
throughout his career, andsupported so-called “conversion therapy” 
<http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2016/jul/28/gavin-newsom/true-mike-pence-advocated-conversion-therapy/>
 programs that purport to change people’s sexual orientation.

Pence also signed a religious freedom law 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/26/indiana-religious-objection-bill-discrimination>
 that sought to allow people to refuse service to same-sex couples because of 
religious convictions.

Regardless of what Trump said, Congress was controlled by Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> who opposed pro-LGBT laws, 
Obergefell said.

In Australia, the conservative Coalition government has proposed a plebiscite, 
a popular vote, to decide whether or not to legalise same-sex marriage. The 
proposalhas been blocked by opposition parties 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/11/marriage-equality-plebiscite-will-not-go-ahead-after-labor-unanimously-decides-to-block-it>
 who want a vote in parliament to bring about same-sex marriage.

Obergefell said he could understand both sides of the argument – that the 
plebiscite could be a means to achieve marriage equality, but was viewed by 
opponents as a “waste of time and effort”.

He said the fact that marriage equality had been rejected by state 
constitutional amendments in the US was used in the landmark case to argue it 
was invalid for the supreme court to legalise same-sex marriage.

“Our legal team’s argument was: there is no surer way to infringe on the 
rights of a minority than to allow a majority to vote on it.”

The outcome of a vote “doesn’t make it legal, doesn’t make it right” to deny 
same-sex couples the ability to marry, he said.

Marriage equality: why knot? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/mar/31/marriage-equality-why-knot-video>
Since the supreme court ruled that same-sex marriage was a right guaranteed by 
the 14th amendment, granting equality before the law, Obergefell said 
acceptance of same-sex marriage had grown.

“What has happened since then is that as same-sex couples get married, they 
are out in their communities, living their lives.

“It lets others meet and get to know them. It stops being an abstract concept, 
and they see it’s something already know – it’s marriage, and it takes away the 
mystery around that.”
