Gurbaksh Chahal, a Silicon Valley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley> technology mogul who 
pleaded guilty to assault after police say he punched and kicked his girlfriend 
117 times, was sentenced to one year in jail on Friday for violating probation.


Judge Tracie Brown revoked Chahal’s probation and ordered him to spend 12 
months in jail for allegedly assaulting a second woman months after pleading 
guilty in the first domestic violence case. Chahal’s lawyer, however, said he 
would appeal the ruling, and the defendant was released on bail.


When he arrived, Chahal rushed past a crowd of reporters outside the packed 
San Francisco courtroom without commenting. He sat stoic throughout the hearing 
and declined to make a statement to the judge.

Chahal, who was pushed out as chief executive officer of RadiumOne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/28/silicon-valley-ad-boss-gurbaksh-chalal-fired-over-abuse-convictions>
, an online advertising network, was originally facing 47 seriousfelony charges 
<https://www.scribd.com/document/219900669/Gurbaksh-Chahal> for the 5 August 
2013 attack. Police officials said that a 30-minute security camera video they 
obtained showed the entrepreneur hitting and kicking his then girlfriend 117 
times and attempting to suffocate her inside his $7m San Franciscopenthouse

.

Chahal’s lawyers, however, claimed that police had illegally seized the video, 
and a judgeruled 
<http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/gurbaksh-chahals-ugly-revenge> that the 
footage was inadmissible despite prosecutors’argument 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/08/video-of-silicon-valley-mogul-kicking-his-girlfriend-117-times-could-send-him-to-jail.html>
 that officers didn’t have time to secure a warrant out of fear that the tech 
executive would erase the footage.

Without the video, most of the charges were dropped, and Chahal, 34, pleaded 
guilty totwo misdemeanor battery charges 
<http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2014/04/ad-mogul-gurbaksh-g-chahal-pleads-guilty-to-two.html>
 of domestic violence. Adeal he struck 
<https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/22/gurbaksh-chahal-probation/> in April 2014 
allowed him to avoid jail time if he conducted a year-long domestic violence 
rehabilitation course and 25 hours of community service.

The disgraced multimillionaire has repeatedly attempted to downplay the 
seriousness of the case, claiming that helost his temper 
<http://www.recode.net/2014/4/27/11626114/gurbaskh-chahal-says-he-didnt-do-it-i-didnt-hit-her-117-times>
 during a “normal argument” with his girlfriend and that he did not kick and 
punch her 117 times.

He said the $500 fine he paid was the “equivalent of a speeding ticket” and 
“in no way reflects the toll that this ordeal has exacted on me”.

In Silicon Valley, critics have argued that Chahal’s case and the lack of 
serious consequences he faced highlight the way in whichprivileged and wealthy 
businessmen

<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/02/domestic-abusers-ray-rice-nfl-employment>
 serious misconduct.

Chahal’s plea bargain also stipulated that he would be on probation for three 
years, but on 17 September 2014, prosecutors say he attacked another woman in 
his home, leading toanother arrest

This second victim told police 
<https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/27/fired-radiumone-ceo-gurbaksh-chahal-says-we-cant-handle-the-truth/>
 that Chahal had repeatedly kicked her and that when she discussed getting a 
restraining order against him, he threatened to report her to immigration 
authorities.

Chahal’s lawyers responded by attempting to attack the credibility of the 
woman in court 
<http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Tech-mogul-Gurbaksh-Chahal-s-lawyers-attack-7541880.php>
, alleging that she was in a sham marriage to get a US visa. The woman has
returned 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/08/video-of-silicon-valley-mogul-kicking-his-girlfriend-117-times-could-send-him-to-jail.html>
 to her native South Korea and did not appear at a recent San Franciscohearing 
<http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Tech-mogul-Gurbaksh-Chahal-s-lawyers-attack-7541880.php>
.

Although the victim did not testify, San Francisco superior court judge Brown 
ruled last month that Chahal had violated probation and ordered him tosurrender 
<http://www.businessinsider.com/gurbaksh-chahal-2016-4> his passports. 

Prosecutor O’Bryan Kenney had urged the judge to sentence Chahal to the 
maximum of 18 months in jail, saying: “His attitude … has consisted of a 
complete lack of remorse … He clearly didn’t get the message.”

In front of a standing-room-only crowd, Kenney showed the judge excerpts of 
the video of the original assault on his laptop, but the audience was not able 
to view it.

“It’s difficult to watch that conduct,” Kenney said, adding, “He has had a 
chance, and further domestic violence counseling … I don’t think would have a 
significant impact.”

Judge Brown said she would not allow the footage to be publicly released.

After he was ousted at RadiumOne, Chahal co-founded Gravity4, another San 
Francisco-based ad tech company. In April of 2015, Erika Alonso, a former 
Gravity4 marketing executive,sued

 Chahal forgender discrimination 
<https://www.scribd.com/document/262654227/Erika-Alonso-complaint>, harassment 
and illegal surveillance, citing his “pattern and practice of humiliating and 
abusing women who dared to question Chahal, a serial entrepreneur with a 
legendary temper”.

The complaint alleged that Chahal regularly belittled Alonso, who is over 40 
years old, and treated younger male employees much more favorably.

“Rather than being allowed to perform her duties,” the complaint read, “Alonso 
was used repeatedly as bait to attract reporters in an attempt to deflect from 
Chahal’s violent past, and to assist him in promoting stories on his bid to 
take over RadiumOne.”

At one point, Chahal told Alonso to contact a prominent female news anchor, 
saying, “You’re a woman, appeal to her!”, according to the suit.

Chahal and other Gravity4 representatives said the allegations were false 
<https://gravity4.com/a-open-letter-from-our-chief-of-staff-head-of-global-recruiting-and-chairman-ceo/>
, but months later, the CEO wassued a second time 
<http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/09/14/gurbaksh-chahal-sued-again-former-employee-alleges-harassment-intimidation-racial-slurs/#79dc4ed53f2e>
 by Yousef Khraibut, a 20-year-old former employee. Khraibut, who has 
citizenship in Canada and Kuwait, alleged that Chahal said he would “beat the 
shit out of” him and threatened to “send Khraibut back to Canada ‘tonight’”.

Chahal also allegedly directed ethnic slurs at Khraibut, calling him a 
“terrorist” and saying that Isis terrorists were “his people”.

After the judge ruled that he had violated probation last month, Chahal 
stepped down 
<https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/28/gurbaksh-chahal-out-as-gravity4-ceo/> as 
Gravity4 CEO.

James Lassart, Chahal’s lawyer, tried again to discredit the second victim in 
court on Friday, telling the judge: “She’s not willing to come into a courtroom 
… Her word is untrustworthy.”

Lassart added, “The constitution requires that my client be allowed to 
confront his accuser.”

The defense lawyer asked the judge to grant Chahal a sentence of electronic 
monitoring or community service and consider that the defendant suffers from a 
functional neurological disorder, saying his health would be exacerbated by 
stress.

Lassart also asked that the judge note Chahal’s charitable donations, saying, 
“He has contributed to and supported and advanced the cause of the stopping of 
abuse of children.”

After the hearing, the defense lawyer criticized the ruling, arguing that when 
a victim doesn’t testify, “I don’t think it’s appropriate for someone to have 
their liberty taken away.”

Chahal pushed his way through a mob of cameras on his way out and refused to 
answer questions.
