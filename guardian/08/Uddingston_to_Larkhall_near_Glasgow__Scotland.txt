Route notes

A town-to-town route taking in a decent chunk of greenery as it passes through 
Chatelherault country park, with its 500 acres of countryside and ancient 
woodland running alongside the dramatic Avon gorge.

Terrain and gradients

A mixture of quiet roads, widened pavements and riverside paths. There are 
three steep sections: down and up to the Clyde crossing in Bothwell, down the 
Furlongs in Hamilton, and up to Chatelherault hunting lodge. The short section 
through Blantyre is still being developed, so you'll be on roads.

How to get there/away

Regular trains from Glasgow stop at Uddingston and Larkhall, as well as 
Hamilton and Chatelherault.

What to see

Built for its eponymous dukes, Hamilton Mausoleum's tall domed structure 
reputedly produces the longest-lasting echo of any manmade building, while 
Chatelherault country park features the dukes' 18th-century grounds and hunting 
lodge – now a visitor centre – with panoramic views of Glasgow and the 
surrounding hills. TheDavid Livingstone Centre <http://bit.ly/11xAQGo> is a 
museum marking the birthplace of the explorer and missionary.Bothwell Castle 
<http://bit.ly/11BsNsX> is partially ruined, but its donjon and prison tower 
still evoke medieval life.

Watering holes

The cafe at the David Livingstone Centre is open from 1 March to Christmas 
Eve. Chatelherault has a cafe and picnic facilities.
