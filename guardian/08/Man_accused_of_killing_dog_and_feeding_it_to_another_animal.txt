A man has appeared in court in Northern Ireland accused of killing, skinning 
and cooking a dog, and then feeding it to another animal.

William Mocsari, 27, has been charged at Newtownards magistrates court with 
causing unnecessary suffering to a dog. Mocsari, from the village of Kircubbin 
in County Down, confessed to his social worker, the court heard.

The court was told Mocsari obtained the dog, which it is alleged he strangled 
with its own lead, from a website that offered it “free to a good home”.


After killing the dog Mocsari then skinned it and fed it to his other dog, 
according to a female officer in the Police Service of Northern Ireland.


The PSNI officer told the court that as well as the alleged confession to his 
social worker, traces of dog fur were found in the fire at his home.


She objected to Mocsari being granted bail as the PSNI considered him to be a 
danger to the public. Mocsari appeared via video link from Maghaberry 
high-security prison outside Belfast.


He is also charged with driving offences and being in possession of diazepam, 
a class C drug.


His defence solicitor said Mocsari was still waiting for a mental health 
assessment ordered by a judge in December.


Mr Justice Hamill ordered Mocsari to be produced from prison and made a 
further order that “someone senior” in the prison service accompanies Mocsari 
so that he can explain to the court why the mental health order had been 
ignored.


The case was adjourned until Tuesday.
