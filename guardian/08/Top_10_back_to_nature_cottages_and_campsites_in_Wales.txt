Fox and Hounds Cottage, near Chepstow, Monmouthshire


The perfect mix of rustic escapism and urban comfort, this pretty stone 
cottage sits between the Wye valley and the Brecon Beacons, with access to 
great walking straight from the door, as well as kayaking and mountain biking. 
Inside the two-bedroom retreat, stone floors, stripped wooden beams and a 
19th-century range are brought up to date by underfloor heating, designer 
bathrooms and an uncluttered aesthetic. Despite the clean lines, it’s 
dog-friendly and great for families with young children, with a cot, high-chair 
and stair-gate provided, a fenced garden for running around in (or barbecuing) 
and a boot room with washing machine, tumble dryer and space for storing bikes.

Led Zeppelin wrote some of their best songs while staying here, and were so 
inspired by the cottage and this corner of west Wales that guitarist Jimmy Page 
wrote the acoustic instrumental Bron Yr Aur in tribute. Now an off-grid 
retreat, the family who own the cottage is launching bell-tent breaks on the 
property this summer. The tent comes with beds, linen and campfire cooking 
gear. There is direct access to mountains, forests and waterfalls, and the 
chance to spot goshawks, red kites and stars (it’s withinSnowdonia’s Dark Sky 
Reserve <http://www.eryri-npa.gov.uk/looking-after/dark-skies>). And stroll 
along Aberdovey’s wild, windswept beach or up the antediluvian hills that 
shelter it and the landscape will soon have you reaching for your camera. 
Should inspiration strike while staying, guests are given a leather journal in 
which to record songs, poems and sketches.
• From £300 for two nights for two, plus £25pp pn for up to two more guests,

This new glampsite outside Aberaeron, on the mid-Wales coast, has much more to 
offer than a cat. There’s a rustic-chic communal kitchen and washing area and 
four stylishly sparse, heated wooden dens (cabins) for guests to sleep in; each 
one comes with duvet-topped beds, a fire pit, a hammock and picnic table. And, 
as there are only four dens, it’s ideal for groups looking to book out a whole 
site for themselves. There are three acres of meadow to play in, fenced 
wildlife ponds and a tangle of footpaths to wander, including the 
Aberaeron-Lampeter footpath and local trails to theNational Trust’s 
Llanerchaeron estate <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/llanerchaeron>. Or head 
to the coast, four miles away, to spot dolphins.

Snowdonia’s most stylish hostel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/feb/22/plas-curig-boutique-hostel-snowdonia>
 – and five minutes’ drive from Snowdon – gets a new addition later this month 
when the owners’ former house opens as a holiday cottage. Attached to the 
hostel (though not accessible directly from it), this cosy three-bedroom 
hideaway has a log-burner in the living room, a smart new kitchen and bathroom 
and views of the mountains from every window. If that inspires you to set out 
for a walk in the hills, there are maps and guidebooks galore to help with the 
planning. It’s also so dog-friendly that there are dog bunkbeds in the entrance 
hall. The mini versions of the hostel’s cabin beds were originally designed for 
the owners’ two Welsh collies.

One of three converted cottages on an organic farm near Rhayader, this 
three-bedroom eco-cottage is ideal for families. Not only does it come with a 
high-chair, cot and washing machine but the farm includes a games room, 
children’s playground, nature and cycle trails and gentle riverside walks 
(though there’s only a small roof garden attached to the cottage). Spend the 
day feeding lambs (in spring), or spotting badgers or birds from a treehouse, 
then return to sit by the Tollant’s beautiful ceramic wood-burner, salvaged 
from a railway station. The owners can also arrange wild camping sleep-outs as 
part of a stay.

Maybe Port Talbot isn’t seen as a holiday destination, but drive half an hour 
north-east into the hills and you come to theAfan Forest park 
<http://www.afanforestpark.co.uk/>, home to six mountain biking trails, a 
low-level cycle route and numerous walking trails (kayaking is also possible in 
the nearest village and, 20 minutes away, you can go kite-surfing on Aberavon 
beach). There’s a well-known mountain biking lodge here,Afan Lodge 
<http://www.afanlodge.com/>, but if you want to leave the world behind, head a 
little further on, to Willow Springs campsite. Its 11 camping pitches have 
access to showers, toilets and a dishwashing area but no electric hook-ups, to 
keep the peace. This summer it is also opening a shepherd’s hut. Backing up to 
a small waterfall and – like the rest of the campsite – having direct access to 
the forest park, when it opens in July it will have 360-degree views of 
wildlife, plus a little chicken coop so that guests can collect their own eggs 
for breakfast.

Not far from pretty Crickhowell, with its independent shops and pubs, this 
17th-century longhouse (or, rather, one end of it: the owners’ house takes up 
the other end) is newly available this year as a two-bedroom holiday cottage. 
Though the name suggests indoors occupation, a stay here is really all about 
what you can do beyond the door. On a rare-breed sheep farm, with a bluebell 
wood and pond on site, the cottage iswithin the Black Mountains 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/26/walking-camping-brecon-beacons-black-mountains-wales>
 so there’s copious walking, cycling or horse-riding to be had in the 
surrounding hills. Start with a climb up Pen Tir, straight from the door, for 
views of Llangorse Lake and, if you’re lucky, red kites.

Turn right after you cross the Menai suspension bridge onto Anglesey and it’s 
a 20-minute drive to this glampsite, on a working farm outside Beaumaris. Book 
one of its four luxury canvas lodges and you can explore the 200 acres of 
fields, woods and stream that surround them in comfort (each one has three 
bedrooms, a kitchen, flushing toilet, gas-powered shower and views of 
Snowdonia). Mountain biking, kayaking, wild swimming, surfing and hiking are 
all possible within an hour’s drive, but there’s plenty to do on the doorstep, 
with Lleiniog Beach an hour’s walk away and the Telor cycle trail passing right 
by the campsite (hire bikes in Beaumaris). If the rain descends, take shelter at
Anglesey Sea Zoo <https://www.angleseyseazoo.co.uk/>, 30 minutes’ south; this

seahorses and one on moon jellyfish.
