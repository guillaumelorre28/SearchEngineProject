In a nutshell

This route is the perfect escape from city life. Heading through Kings Heath 
park, Highbury park, Cannon Hill park and along a stretch of the river Rea, you 
walk past water features, beautifully planted flower beds, a cricket ground and 
fascinating areas of allotments.

Why it’s special

As you follow this route you’ll be surrounded by greenery and wildlife, making 
it hard to believe that you’re in an extremely urban area of south Birmingham.

First you walk through Kings Heath park and into Highbury park, where you’ll 
pass the duck pond and head to the arboretum at the northern end. You’ll pass a 
cricket ground and some carefully tended allotments. There’s a short stretch 
through stunning woodland too. You then meander through Cannon Hill park, with 
its mixture of evergreen trees and open grassy spaces. Pass a small pond and 
you’ll come upon one of the more quirky features of the walk – a model of the 
Elan Valley dams, where you can learn all about Birmingham’s water supply. 
You’ll also pass theMidlands Arts Centre <http://macbirmingham.co.uk> and the 
park’s boating lake; then enjoy a stretch along the river Rea, before heading 
back into Kings Heath park and returning to your starting point.
