Day two of the second Test between Australia and South Africa has been 
abandoned due to rain in Hobart. The Proteas will resume at 171-5 on Monday, 
when Australia face an uphill battle trying to fight back after being skittled 
for 85 in their first innings.

Heavy rain hammered Hobart on Sunday, wiping out any play, but the forecast is 
better for days three, four and five of the contest, meaning there is still 
likely to be a result in the match.

The hosts will use South Africa’s second innings comeback success story from 
the first Test in Perth as a blueprint to scratch out victory after a dire 
first day at Bellerive.

Skipper Steve Smith top-scored with 48 not out in what was otherwise a 
shameful batting performance from Australia on Saturday, leaving coach Darren 
Lehmann busy formulating plans to resurrect hope.

Top priority is stemming the Proteas’ lead, which is currently 86 runs.

“There’s four days left at the moment so the challenge for us is to get the 
five wickets quickly and then bat big like they did in Perth,” Lehmann said on 
Saturday. “The guys are hurting and they’ll come out and put on a big score I’m 
sure.”

South Africa batted first at the Waca Ground and were all out for 242, while 
Australia finished 105-0 at stumps on day one. Day two was not so positive for 
the home side, who were dismissed for 244 before the Proteas compiled 540-8 
declared in their second innings.

That’s the path Lehmann wants to follow. Australia’s coach didn’t shy away 
from responsibility for Saturday’s first-innings collapse.

“We know we’ve got to get better in a lot of areas,” Lehmann said. “I’m really 
confident they will play better than they did in the first innings. We’ve just 
got to get the five wickets first and foremost.”
