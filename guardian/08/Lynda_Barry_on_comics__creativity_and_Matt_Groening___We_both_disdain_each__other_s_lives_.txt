Lynda Barry likes to say things that most people shouldn’t or couldn’t. A 
short conversation about her job as a teacher gets very interesting very 
quickly.


“I’m into Chewbacca in a very inappropriate way,” she says, three minutes into 
our interview. “I love Chewbacca. And not just as a friend.”

The creator of long-running comic strip Ernie Pook’s Comeek, Barry is one of 
America’s most beloved cartoonists. But she started out making comics and 
cartoons for her student newspaper, testing how far she could push the editor.

“He made this announcement saying that he would print anything that anyone 
submitted,” she says. “I read that and I thought, ‘Really?’ And I tried to come 
up with stuff that he would not print.”

Barry slipped what she thought were unprintable drawings under the door of the 
newspaper office at night, signed under a pseudonym, “Ernie Pook”. This, it 
turns out, was the beginning of a life-changing friendship.

The editor of Barry’s student newspaper was Matt Groening, who would go on to 
createThe Simpsons <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-simpsons> and 
Futurama.

“He printed my comics,” she says. “That’s how it started.”

Barry and Groening arrived on the scene in a bizarre moment in comics history, 
when the ability to make weird drawings and say honest, confronting and/or 
inappropriate things was a genuine asset. It was the late 70s and the tail end 
of the underground “comix” movement, when staying hip meant you had to be into 
weird comics. Small alternative newspapers were popping up in every city in 
America, opening up doors for cartoonists with unusual sensibilities.

“Comics were still considered to be an important part of any newspaper, and I 
just happened to be right there with a body of work,” Barry says. “It really 
worked out for me and for Matt.”

The friendship was galvanised on the weekly grind of the syndicated 
cartoonist. Ernie Pook’s Comeek is funny, as you would expect, but it’s Barry 
funny, which means it’s also tragic, morbid and depressing. One of the themes 
of her career is finding words and visual forms that express the unspeakable 
and the unthinkable. The strip often follows the inner world of children, but 
it’s not Peanuts: this is a world of alcoholic parents, sadistic bullies, inept 
teachers and a stint or two in juvie.

The strip ran for almost 30 years and at its zenith was published in about 70 
alternative weeklies. At the time Groening was working on an equally popular 
strip, Life in Hell, and the friendship developed over the phone during long 
hours at the drawing table.

“If one of us was working on our strips and we just got stuck and needed a 
punchline, we would always call the other,” Barry says.

Barry’s career spans a period in which the job description of a cartoonist 
changed dramatically. When she began drawing Ernie Pook, newspaper comic strips 
were a relevant media form, in conversation with the current culture. But when 
she finished it in 2008 they had become an atrophied parody of themselves. 
Readers had stopped going to the newspaper to find interesting comics. They 
were looking on the web, in zines, or in the graphic novel section of the 
bookstore. There was no place for alternative voices in the quickly 
consolidating alt weeklies.

“A parent company would buy the successful weekly papers in different towns, 
and the first thing they would do was kick out the cartoonists,” she says.

If saying things you shouldn’t say was what sparked Barry’s comic strip, it 
was likely also the thing that ended it: “For someone who had just acquired a 
weekly paper to have to read these really sad stories about childhood – I can 
understand why they would replace me with sudoku.”

Since Ernie Pook’s comic ended, Barry has found a new forum for saying things 
that you can’t say: the classroom. She has become a teacher and theorist in a 
field where plain language commonly falls short: the study of human creativity. 
Barry’s line of inquiry is the search for what she calls “the biological 
function of this thing we call the arts”.

To have to read these sad stories about childhood – I can understand why 
[newspapers] would replace me with sudoku
Lynda Barry 
“People ask me, ‘Do you think everyone is creative?’ and to me it’s like 
asking, ‘Do you think everyone has a liver?’ ”

Her task is to find ways to talk about what’s going on in and around our 
bodies when we are drawing pictures and making up stories. For Barry, research 
tactics might include: conducting automatic drawing exercises with people who 
claim they can’t draw; making PhD candidates explain their research to a 
five-year-old; getting novelists to try writing their books with a paintbrush 
instead of a word processor.

It’s kooky, no doubt, but Barry’s classroom at the University of Wisconsin is 
not a creative writing workshop for career storytellers. It’s a place where 
science PhDs and business undergraduates learn how to write and draw. Her 
approach to unlocking creativity in the non-artists is informed by her punk 
rock and DIY beginnings: she believes in a culture of simply making stuff.

“We don’t spend a lot of time in theory or in critique,” she says. “We spend a 
lot of time making things and looking at each other’s work, but not exactly 
talking deeply about it.”

Barry is a sparkling extrovert in conversation and in the classroom but, like 
most cartoonists, she describes herself as a hermit, preoccupied with rich 
interior worlds and the solitary craft of making little drawings in boxes.

It’s probably for this reason her career path diverged decades ago from that 
of her old friend Groening.

“To me Matt’s life is hell,” she says. “He’s working with the most difficult 
people: the people in the entertainment industry. Matt has always loved butting 
heads with difficult people. He’s the only person I know who loves getting a 
solicitor calling on the phone.

“We both disdain each other’s lives and that makes for a very fun friendship.”

together at theSydney Opera House on 5 November
