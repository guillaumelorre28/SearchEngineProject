 * Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton raised $52.8m between 
October 1 and October 19, according to the latest campaign finance disclosures 
released this evening, and spent $50m over the same period. That gives 
Clinton’s campaign $62.4m in cash-on-hand going into the final weeks of the 
presidential campaign, a huge sum that would allow her to spend at least $3.1m 
per day through Election Day.

 * Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, has a 
meager $16m in cash-on-hand in the last two weeks of the presidential campaign, 
after having raised $30.5m between October 1 and October 19.

 * Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence’s campaign plane skidded 
off the runway at New York’s LaGuardia Airport on Thursday evening, after 
attempting to land in heavy rain. Pence, the governor of Indiana, was onboard 
at the time. No injuries were reported on the plane or on the ground, with 
journalists, campaign staff and Pence himself exiting from the rear of the 
plane. According to journalists on the scene, the plane landed hard enough for 
mud to splash on the plane’s windshield. Emergency crews were on-site moments 
after the plane landed. The plane, a Boeing 737, is operated by private 
Miami-based charter company Eastern Airlines. 
 * Illinois senator Mark Kirk, locked in a bitter reelection battle with 
Democratic challenger and Illinois congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, responded to 
Duckworth’s citing of her family’s military background in a debate this evening 
by accusing Duckworth of exaggerating her family’s record of service. 
 * According to an exclusive report from Politico

, Vice President Joe Biden is the frontrunner of a shortlist of potential 
secretaries of state compiled by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton’s campaign.

 * A former beauty queen has become the 12th woman to openly accuse Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump of sexual assault. Ninni Laaksonen, a former 
Miss Finland in the Miss Universe competition that Trump once owned, alleged in

Report: Joe Biden tops Hillary Clinton's list of potential Secretaries of State

According to an exclusive report from Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/clinton-eyes-biden-for-secretary-of-state-230428>
, Vice President Joe Biden is the frontrunner of a shortlist of potential 
secretaries of state compiled by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton’s campaign.

Citing a source familiar with the planning, Politico reports that Biden has 
not been informed of his potential status as a frontrunner for Clinton’s old 
job, but “He’d be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the 
best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins,” the source said.

Biden, a former six-term senator from Delaware who chaired the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, was selected as Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008 in 
part because of his extensive foreign-policy experience. Biden has expressed 
interest in working in the foreign-policy sphere after he leaves the Naval 
Observatory, saying as much as a campaign stop this week.

Included on the list of potential secretaries of state are former 
undersecretary Wendy Sherman, Kurt Campbell, Clinton’s assistant secretary of 
state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and James Stavridis, a retired 
admiral .

More on Mark Kirk's racialized comments about Tammy Duckworth

Illinois senator Mark Kirk, locked in a bitter reelection battle with 
Democratic challenger and Illinois congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, responded to 
Duckworth’s citing of her family’s military background in a debate this evening 
by accusing Duckworth of exaggerating her family’s record of service.

“My family has served this nation in uniform going back to the Revolution. I 
am a Daughter of the American Revolution,” Duckworth said, referring to the 
group whose members are the female descendants of those who served in the 
American Revolution.

“I’ve bled for this nation,” Duckworth continued. “But I still want to be 
there in the Senate when the drums of war sound because people are quick to 
sound the drums of war and I want to be there to say, ‘this is what it costs 
and this is what you’re asking us to do.’ And if that’s the case, I’ll go. It’s 
families like mine that bleed first. But let’s make sure that the American 
people understand what we are engaging in and let’s hold our allies accountable 
because we can’t do it all.”

Kirk, whose own campaign exaggerated 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/mark-kirk-iraq-veteran-website/index.html>
 his record of military service, responded dismissively: “I had forgotten your 
parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.”

Duckworth, who was born in Thailand, is the daughter of a Thai woman of 
Chinese descent and an American father who traced his roots to the 
Revolutionary War. Members of the Duckworth family have served in the American 
armed forces since the revolution.

Duckworth herself served as a US Army helicopter pilot in the Iraq war, losing 
both her legs and severely injuring her right arm when the helicopter she was 
piloting was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade in 2004.

Mark Kirk to Tammy Duckworth: 'I had forgotten your parents came all the way 
from Thailand to serve George Washington'

In his debate with Illinois congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran 
who is challenging him for a seat in the US Senate, Illinois senator Mark Kirk 
made a tone-deaf joke that already has critics accusing him of racially charged 
remarks.

“I had forgotten your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George 
Washington,” Kirk said, in reference to Duckworth’s family background.

Duckworth, who was born in Thailand, is the daughter of a Thai woman of 
Chinese descent and an American father who traced his roots to the 
Revolutionary War. Members of the Duckworth family have served in the American 
armed forces since the revolution.

Donald Trump, on Mike Pence’s plane accident:

The plane skidded off the runway and was pretty close to grave, grave danger, 
but I just spoke to Mike Pence, and he’s fine. Everybody’s fine, everybody’s 
fine.

The Daily Beast reports that Donald Trump’s long list of political 
contributors does not include his grown children:

According to a review of Federal Election Commission filings by The Daily 
Beast, only one of Trump’s children showed up on a list of itemized receipts 
for the campaign: Eric. On Sept. 7, 2016, Eric Trump appears to have 
contributed $376.20 listed only as “meeting expense: meals.” It appears that 
money was later refunded. Eric Trump did not respond to a request for comment 
about the transaction.

Ivanka Trump, who previously contributed to Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and John McCain in 2007 
and 2008 respectively, does not appear to have given to her father.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> Jr., who 
contributed to Iowa congressman Steve King in 2014 and Hillary Clinton in 2007, 
is also nowhere to be found.

And a search for Tiffany Trump yielded no results.

Other no-shows: Newt Gingrich, Michael Flynn, Chris Christie, Steve Bannon and 
Rudy Giuliani.

Mike Pence's plane slides off runway

Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence’s campaign plane skidded off 
the runway at New York’s LaGuardia Airport on Thursday evening, after 
attempting to land in heavy rain. Pence, the governor of Indiana, was onboard 
at the time.

No injuries were reported on the plane or on the ground, with journalists, 
campaign staff and Pence himself exiting from the rear of the plane. According 
to journalists on the scene, the plane landed hard enough for mud to splash on 
the plane’s windshield.

Emergency crews were on-site moments after the plane landed. The plane, a 
Boeing 737, is operated by private Miami-based charter company Eastern Airlines.

Pence’s next scheduled appearance was at a campaign rally in Bensalem, 
Pennsylvania, on Friday afternoon; he was to attend a private fundraiser on 
Thursday night in New York City.

According to campaign spokesperson Stephanie Grisham, speaking from Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump’s motorcade in Ohio, Trump called Pence from 
his car after a rally in Geneva, Ohio: “He reached out to Governor Pence and he 
is very glad everyone aboard is safe.”

Donald Trump raise $0 for RNC in October

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> raised zero dollars - nada, 
zilch, goose-egg - for the Republican National Committee in October, according 
to the RNC’s latest report to the Federal Election Commission.

The filings show no transfers joint-fundraising organization Trump Victory to 
the RNC’s coffers in the final stretch of the campaign, a potentially crippling 
shortfall when the party is desperately attempting to hold onto its control of 
the US Senate.

Trump also has no high-price donor events scheduled for the remainder of the 
campaign, for his own campaign or for the RNC.

According to an exclusive report from Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/clinton-eyes-biden-for-secretary-of-state-230428>
, Vice President Joe Biden is the frontrunner of a shortlist of potential 
secretaries of state compiled by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton’s campaign.

Citing a source familiar with the planning, Politico reports that Biden has 
not been informed of his potential status as a frontrunner for Clinton’s old 
job, but “He’d be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the 
best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins,” the source said.

Biden, a former six-term senator from Delaware who chaired the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, was selected as Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008 in 
part because of his extensive foreign-policy experience. Biden has expressed 
interest in working in the foreign-policy sphere after he leaves the Naval 
Observatory, saying as much as a campaign stop this week.

Included on the list of potential secretaries of state are former 
undersecretary Wendy Sherman, Kurt Campbell, Clinton’s assistant secretary of 
state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and James Stavridis, a retired 
admiral .
 
Illinois senator Mark Kirk, locked in a bitter reelection battle with 
Democratic challenger and Illinois congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, responded to 
Duckworth’s citing of her family’s military background in a debate this evening 
by accusing Duckworth of exaggerating her family’s record of service.

“My family has served this nation in uniform going back to the Revolution. I 
am a Daughter of the American Revolution,” Duckworth said, referring to the 
group whose members are the female descendants of those who served in the 
American Revolution.

“I’ve bled for this nation,” Duckworth continued. “But I still want to be 
there in the Senate when the drums of war sound because people are quick to 
sound the drums of war and I want to be there to say, ‘this is what it costs 
and this is what you’re asking us to do.’ And if that’s the case, I’ll go. It’s 
families like mine that bleed first. But let’s make sure that the American 
people understand what we are engaging in and let’s hold our allies accountable 
because we can’t do it all.”

Kirk, whose own campaign exaggerated 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/mark-kirk-iraq-veteran-website/index.html>
 his record of military service, responded dismissively: “I had forgotten your 
parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.”

Duckworth, who was born in Thailand, is the daughter of a Thai woman of 
Chinese descent and an American father who traced his roots to the 
Revolutionary War. Members of the Duckworth family have served in the American 
armed forces since the revolution.

Duckworth herself served as a US Army helicopter pilot in the Iraq war, losing 
both her legs and severely injuring her right arm when the helicopter she was 
piloting was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade in 2004.
 
According to the latest campaign finance filings with the Federal Election 
Commission, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign has a 
meager $16m in cash-on-hand in the last two weeks of the presidential campaign, 
after having raised $30.5m between October 1 and October 19.

The campaign spend $49.3m over that same period.

Trump gave just $30,681.67 of his own money to the campaign in October. He has 
so far donated $57m of his personal fortune to the campaign - much less than 
the $100m he has promised.

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has 
$153m in cash on hand, including cash held by allied groups.
 
In his debate with Illinois congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran 
who is challenging him for a seat in the US Senate, Illinois senator Mark Kirk 
made a tone-deaf joke that already has critics accusing him of racially charged 
remarks.

“I had forgotten your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George 
Washington,” Kirk said, in reference to Duckworth’s family background.

Duckworth, who was born in Thailand, is the daughter of a Thai woman of 
Chinese descent and an American father who traced his roots to the 
Revolutionary War. Members of the Duckworth family have served in the American 
armed forces since the revolution.

Donald Trump, on Mike Pence’s plane accident:

The plane skidded off the runway and was pretty close to grave, grave danger, 
but I just spoke to Mike Pence, and he’s fine. Everybody’s fine, everybody’s 
fine.
 
The Daily Beast reports that Donald Trump’s long list of political 
contributors does not include his grown children:

According to a review of Federal Election Commission filings by The Daily 
Beast, only one of Trump’s children showed up on a list of itemized receipts 
for the campaign: Eric. On Sept. 7, 2016, Eric Trump appears to have 
contributed $376.20 listed only as “meeting expense: meals.” It appears that 
money was later refunded. Eric Trump did not respond to a request for comment 
about the transaction.

Ivanka Trump, who previously contributed to Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and John McCain in 2007 
and 2008 respectively, does not appear to have given to her father.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> Jr., who 
contributed to Iowa congressman Steve King in 2014 and Hillary Clinton in 2007, 
is also nowhere to be found.

And a search for Tiffany Trump yielded no results.

Other no-shows: Newt Gingrich, Michael Flynn, Chris Christie, Steve Bannon and 
Rudy Giuliani.

LaGuardia Airport has been put at a ground-stop, with all planes either held 
in a holding pattern or redirected to nearby regional airports.
 
Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence’s campaign plane skidded off 
the runway at New York’s LaGuardia Airport on Thursday evening, after 
attempting to land in heavy rain. Pence, the governor of Indiana, was onboard 
at the time.

No injuries were reported on the plane or on the ground, with journalists, 
campaign staff and Pence himself exiting from the rear of the plane. According 
to journalists on the scene, the plane landed hard enough for mud to splash on 
the plane’s windshield.

Emergency crews were on-site moments after the plane landed. The plane, a 
Boeing 737, is operated by private Miami-based charter company Eastern Airlines.

Pence’s next scheduled appearance was at a campaign rally in Bensalem, 
Pennsylvania, on Friday afternoon; he was to attend a private fundraiser on 
Thursday night in New York City.

According to campaign spokesperson Stephanie Grisham, speaking from Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump’s motorcade in Ohio, Trump called Pence from 
his car after a rally in Geneva, Ohio: “He reached out to Governor Pence and he 
is very glad everyone aboard is safe.”
 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> raised zero dollars - nada, 
zilch, goose-egg - for the Republican National Committee in October, according 
to the RNC’s latest report to the Federal Election Commission.

The filings show no transfers joint-fundraising organization Trump Victory to 
the RNC’s coffers in the final stretch of the campaign, a potentially crippling 
shortfall when the party is desperately attempting to hold onto its control of 
the US Senate.

Trump also has no high-price donor events scheduled for the remainder of the 
campaign, for his own campaign or for the RNC.

 
Watch it live here:
 
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> raised $52.8m between 
October 1 and October 19, according to the latest campaign finance disclosures 
released this evening, and spent $50m over the same period. That gives 
Clinton’s campaign $62.4m in cash-on-hand going into the final weeks of the 
presidential campaign, a huge sum that would allow her to spend at least $3.1m 
per day through Election Day.

Over the month of October, Clinton has raised, on average, $2.8m a day.
