Why go now?
Tranquil-looking Pendle Hill, in the Forest of Bowland 
<http://forestofbowland.com/>, is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. But at 
this time of year people visit less for the scenery and more to pay tribute to 
the area’s dark past. In the days when Lancashire was a lawless and wild place, 
Pendle Hill was known for its witches, and the most notorious coven was rounded 
up for the 1612 Pendle witch trials, one of the largest in British history.
