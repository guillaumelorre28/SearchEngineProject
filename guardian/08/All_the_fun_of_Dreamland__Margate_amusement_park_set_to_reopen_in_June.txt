Roll up, roll up … Tickets went on sale today for Britain’s oldest amusement 
park.Dreamland Margate 
<http://www.dreamland.co.uk/?gclid=CJPZhuy6xsQCFUWK2woddLkAzA> will reopen on 
19 June, 10 years after it closed and following an £18m refurbishment that has 
seen some original rides restored and the addition of a host of retro-style 
amusements harking back to Dreamland’s 1960s heyday.

The centrepiece of the new park is the original Grade II-listed scenic 
railway, which wasdamaged in arson attacks in 2008 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/20/ukcrime.communities> but has been 
restored piece by piece. The 17 rides, evoking the old-fashioned fun of the 
traditional British seaside, include a replica helter skelter, a vintage pedal 
car roadway, a Wedgwood teacup ride, dodgems and a ferris wheel. A roller 
disco, Punch and Judy show and Messhams Wall of Death motorbike show will add 
to the nostalgic atmosphere.

The redevelopment is led by king-of-kitsch designer Wayne Hemingway, who is 
overseeing the restoration of original rides and the design of new rides and 
attractions.

Tickets went on sale at 10am today, (£14.95 for adults, £12.95 for children). 
The box office opened this morning two hours before tickets went on sale 
online, allowing locals to buy tickets first. The first 500 people received a 
Dreamland souvenir – a cube of wood crafted from the original railway planks.

The reopening follows years of lobbying by local campaign group Save 
Dreamland, which saw off an attempt to redevelop the abandoned site for retail 
and commercial use.

The resurrection is the latest in a series of developments that have helped 
transform Margate from down-at-heel forgotten seaside town to thriving artistic 
community. The opening of theTurner Contemporary 
<https://www.turnercontemporary.org/> in 2011 marked the start of its 
transformation, encourging a new generation of artists and other creative types 
to set up studios, shops and galleries in the town which is now as well-known 
for its vintage shopping as for its artistic heritage. The opening of Dreamland 
will cement Margate’s reputation for vintage fun.
