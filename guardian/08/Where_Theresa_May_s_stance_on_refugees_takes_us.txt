Theresa May posturing to the UN on uncontrolled migration (May refuses to take 
more Syrian refugees

, 20 September) was a little bit like a serial adulterer giving a lecture on 
the merits of fidelity in marriage. I’m surprised she didn’t get bottled off 
stage. First, Mrs May failed to reach UK targets on immigration during her time 
as home secretary. So, a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Second, the 
refugee crisis that she refers to is largely a consequence of UK foreign 
policy. In 2007, the UN estimated that the Iraq war caused 2 million people to 
flee the conflict. This year,the UN estimated that 4.8 million had fled Syria. 
More than that fled Afghanistan during the UK’s period of intervention.

Surprisingly, dropping bombs upon people causes them to run away. Perhaps Mrs 
May should dwell upon that fact, rather than lecturing the UN about the 
differences between refugees and economic migrants.

• The “polite and gentle” boy killed attempting to climb on to a lorry last 
Friday (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/afghan-boy-killed-in-calais-in-attempt-to-climb-on-to-lorry-to-uk>
, 20 September) could have been the child I met while volunteering in the 
Calais migrant camp last month.

I was teaching English, as part of Care4Calais’s outreach scheme. He was small 
for his age and his eyes were red with tiredness and tear gas. He explained 
that each night he climbed trees in order to jump down on to the lorries. He 
would cut the tarpaulin in a vain attempt to evade the heat sensors and sniffer 
dogs. Each night he would be returned to the camp, often after a beating from 
the police. Walls and fences will not keep desperate people out (including 
unaccompanied children); surely we have a moral responsibility to at the very 
least let the children in. There must be no more deaths.

• Patrick Kingsley (Opinion

, 20 September) knows more than most what Theresa May’s asylum/refugee policies 
are all about: keep them out. This guided her through her Home Office days. She 
could reflect on what is happening in Canada, where Justin Trudeau’s government 
has settled 30,000 Syrians, mostly families, mostly welcomed and sponsored by 
Canadian families. In the UK many people have offered to do the same, but Mrs 
May won’t allow this to happen, even when people have offered full housing and 
financial support. Doesn’t matter what is happening in Syria or elsewhere – 
“keep them out and leave it to others” is the voice inside Mrs May’s head, a 
voice not susceptible to humanitarian considerations.

• The real challenge facing world leaders attending President Obama’s summit 
on refugees (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/refugee-crisis-rests-on-obama-summit-un-talks-fail>
, 19 September) is tackling the root causes of migration, not just the effects. 
By ignoring the state-sponsored violence in countries such as Sudan (the source 
of the third-largest group arriving in the UK) our leaders seek a sticking 
plaster rather than a cure.

Even more concerning is the UK’s involvement in the so-called Khartoum 
process, whereby Europe aims to prevent Sudan’s refugees from reaching Libya 
and the Mediterranean. If we turn a blind eye to Sudan’s record of ethnically 
cleansing its non-Arab and non-Muslim citizens, refugees will continue to seek 
sanctuary – and are allowed to do so under international law. Were Sudan’s 
government to be persuaded to stop bombing and oppressing its own civilians, 
they would be more likely to stay there. By too often appeasing Sudan’s 
leaders, we have guaranteed that thousands of Sudanese will continue to seek 
refuge with their former colonial rulers.
