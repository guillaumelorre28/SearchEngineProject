WINNING TIP: Vailima, Apia, Samoa

Chronic ill health led Robert Louis Stevenson, author of Kidnapped and 
Treasure Island, to embark on voyages around the South Seas. He finally settled 
along with his family in Western Samoa in the last years of his life. It is 
still possible to visit his house, Vailima, and to labour up the rough-hewn 
path built by devoted Samoans to carry him to the top of a steep hill for 
burial – a peaceful spot with a wonderful view over the coastal town of Apia.

Tennyson Mile, Isle of Wight
This stretches from the unspoilt beach at Freshwater Bay to Farringford, the 
home of the Victorian poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The magnolia by the 
conservatory at Farringford was presented to Tennyson as a cutting by American 
poet Henry Longfellow in 1868. Tennyson's Gift, the novel by Lynne Truss, is 
set in Freshwater Bay, and the Poets & Pines Histree Trail (histreetrail.com 
<http://www.histreetrail.com/>) is a fascinating walk highlighting the trees 
that inspired Tennyson. It includes the Tennyson Mile but goes inland to 
Freshwater village, passing Freshwater Court, which the poet had built for his 
wife's family.

Godrevy Lighthouse, St Ives
Though Virginia Woolf set her 1927 novel To the Lighthouse in the Hebrides, it 
was inspired by childhood holidays at St Ives in Cornwall – pure white sand, 
hidden rock pools, a wooden cafe serving hot chocolate, and that enchanting 
view out to Godrevy Lighthouse.

Keats walk, Winchester
The walk John Keats took when he was inspired to write his ode To Autumn. What 
better time than now to follow the route Keats took one autumn Sunday in 1819? 
You start out in the High Street where he lodged, and end up at the Hospital of 
St Cross which still doles out alms to the needy. It not only takes in many of 
Winchester's places of interest – the Cathedral (burial place of Jane Austen), 
Wolvesey Palace, Winchester College – but also passes along the beautiful banks 
of the River Itchen, which Keats described as "most beautifully clear". He also 
described the air as "worth sixpence a pint" - not sure how that rates after 
inflation!

Tynemouth Priory, North Tyneside
Visit the grave of Alexander Rollo here – the headstone says he carried the 
lantern at the burial of Sir John Moore at Corunna in 1809, as immortalised in 
Charles Wolfe's poem: "We buried him darkly at dead of night/The sods with our 
bayonets turning/By the struggling moonbeam's misty light/And the lanthorn 
dimly burning … "

Top Withens farmhouse, Haworth
The ruin of Top Withens farmhouse is the perfect place to experience the 
Brontës' fictional world. Purported to be the location that Emily had in mind 
when she wrote Wuthering Heights, the farmhouse is reached by a well-signposted 
walk across the moors from Haworth. It's far removed from the touristy tea 
shops down in the village, and the isolation of this windswept ruin gives you a 
true sense of what the world of Cathy Earnshaw or Jane Eyre must have been 
like. Even on a bright summer's day, the loneliness of this moorland is an 
almost tangible presence, and you feel that the howling winds of winter are 
never far away.

La Sebastiana, Valparaíso
La Sebastiana – once the home of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda – is worth the puff 
up the steep hills of colourful Valparaíso. It evokes the poet's strong 
attachment to the sea in its wonderful details, from the porthole windows to 
the nautical paraphernalia and polished wood bar. The view out over the cluster 
of brightly painted, corrugated houses and the sea beyond leaves you 
understanding why Neruda loved Valparaíso and La Sebastiana.

La Cartuja, Mallorca
The journey from Palma to Soller on a lovely rickety wooden train and then by 
bus to Valldemossa is breathtaking. The Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa is 
where George Sand and Frédéric Chopin stayed in the winter of 1838-9 and George 
Sand wrote of their experiences in her book A Winter in Mallorca. The tour of 
the monastery is not to be missed.
