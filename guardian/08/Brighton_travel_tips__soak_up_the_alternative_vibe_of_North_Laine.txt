Described by one guidebook as "the heart and soul of Brighton", the North 
Laine is not actually a lane, but an area.  The square mile or so of land 
spilling down to the south-east from Brighton station contains about 300 shops, 
37 cafes, 22 pubs, four theatres, two museums and a library – as well as any 
number of weeny-teeny Kirsty'd cottages.

The big chains haven't moved in, thanks to a ferocious local association, plus 
the fact that the retail units are mostly pretty small. The result is utterly, 
uniquely Brighton; one row of shops includes a bonsai specialist, a guarana 
cafe, a graphic novel shop and a tattoo parlour.

Feeling creative? There are two bead shops, two guitar shops, two drum shops 
and a shop offering sewing workshops. Worried about your spiritual wellbeing? 
This is just the place to grab some aura spray, pick up a Tibetan singing bowl, 
visit a shamanic healer, or buy a bundle of white sage (for clearing negative 
vibrations from any room). Anxious about your environmental impact? Load up on 
eco-friendly products at Infinity Foods co-operative, try on vegetarian shoes, 
or check out the shelves at Eco Logic Cool (ecologiccool.com 
<http://www.ecologiccool.com/1_home.html>) – the picture frame made from 
recycled tyres is genuinely cool. You'll easily find someone to sell you a 
fancy hat or eight kinds of flying disc.

It would be untrue to say there's something for everyone here – unless 
everyone has turned into a hippy-dippy vegetarian. But there is, very possibly, 
something for you.
