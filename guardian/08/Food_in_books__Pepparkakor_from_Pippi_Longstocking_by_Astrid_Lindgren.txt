That morning Pippi was busy making pepparkakor – a kind of Swedish cookie. She 
had made an enormous amount of dough and rolled it out on the kitchen floor. 
‘Because,’ said Pippi to her little monkey, ‘what earthly use is a baking board 
when one plans to make at least five hundred cookies?’ And there she lay on the 
floor, cutting out cookie hearts for dear life.

Eight Christmases ago, I experienced my first Swedish Christmas. We spent all 
day on Christmas Eve preparing the julbord, a smörgåsbord that we only ever 
have on 24 December. So much of it was unfamiliar: the pickled herring, the 
crisp bread, the lingonberry jam that accompanied the meatballs, the bottles of 
fizzy julmust, the tins of sprats layered through theJanssons frestelse 
<https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/janssons-temptation/>, the tiny glasses 
of akvavit that made me lightheaded, the song I didn’t know the words to.

In subsequent years, it has come to rival Christmas dinner as my favourite 
meal of the season. It feels like part of the fabric of Christmas now, as much 
as It’s a Wonderful Life or plum pudding. I’ve even had a small influence on 
the ritual - we now cook the hamthe Nigella way 
<https://www.nigella.com/recipes/ham-in-coca-cola> (in Coca Cola) at my 
suggestion, before glazing it with the traditional mustard, sugar, egg, and 
breadcrumbs. I have my own favourite parts of the meal: the boiled eggs topped 
with Kalles Kaviar, the pickled herring with juniper, and the Janssons, a dish 
I now look forward to every year. I can even blag my way through the chorus of 
the song we sing, before we throw back our shot of akvavit.

All the recipes for this meal are taken from a cookbook that my 
Cotswolds-based surrogate mother has on her shelves. It is familiar, and worn, 
and filled with pictures of aggressively decorated seasonal tables laden with 
food. I irritate her every year as we cook from it, asking that she again 
translates smör (butter) and musket (nutmeg), and explains how to measure out 
flour and sugar indecilitres

For so long, we have followed tradition, and stuck to the familiar pages in 
the book. But in the past couple of years, we have started to add new things - 
a beetroot, potato, apple, onion and gherkin salad this year, and a batch of 
homemade pepparkakor on Boxing Day. The biscuits themselves aren’t new; there 
is always a tin of them waiting, alongside the Christmas cake, to be eaten in 
the final days of December. The ones from IKEA have always served us well, but 
I have discovered, to my delight, that no biscuit is simpler to make. The dough 
is incredibly forgiving, happy to be rolled and re-rolled as you require. The 
making of the dough takes minutes only. I appreciate that, at this point, the 
last thing you need to fill your house with is a box of 60 biscuits. But 
they’re just too good to keep to myself. Put some of the leftover Stilton on 
them, and settle in for the last of the Christmas telly.

Pepparkakor

Makes at least 60

Ingredients 
50ml water
 2tbsp golden syrup 
80g light brown sugar
 20g dark brown sugar 
1tsp ground ginger 
1tsp ground cinnamon 
Pinch ground cloves
 75g unsalted butter, cut into cubes
 1tsp bicarbonate of soda 
220g plain flour

Equipment 
Small saucepan 
Mixing bowl
 Sieve 
Rolling pin
 Biscuit cutter 
Greaseproof paper
 Baking tray 
Wire rack

1. Bring the water, golden syrup, sugars and spices to the boil over a low 
heat. Pour them over the butter in the mixing bowl, and leave for a few minutes 
to cool. The butter should have completely melted by this stage.

2. Sieve the bicarbonate of soda and flour into the mixture. Stir to combine 
and bring together in a dough. Leave the bowl in the fridge for a couple of 
hours, preferably overnight.

3. Preheat the oven to 200C. Flour your work surface, and roll the dough out 
as thinly as you can - a couple of millimetres thick is about right. Line your 
baking trays. Cut shapes out of the dough, and arrange them on the tray, 
leaving a little space for them to spread slightly.

4. Transfer each batch to the oven and bake for five minutes, until slightly 
crisp around the edges. Leave to cool on the tray for five minutes, and then 
completely on the wire rack. The biscuits should be crisp. Serve plain or with 
cheese - they’re lovely with Swedish cheese, or good cheddar.
