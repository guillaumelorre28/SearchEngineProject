Slightly awkwardly, the first Dixville Notch voter fumbled getting the ballot 
into the box. But he recovered quickly.

The polls have now closed and they are OPENING THE BOX.

Voting starts in Dixville Notch!

And we’re on …

We’ll bring you the results as soon as they’ve counted the votes. There could 
be 12 of them, if turnout is good, so be patient.

Trump is about to take the stage in Grand Rapids.

Someone, however, seems to have got fed up with waiting (it is, to be fair, 
half past midnight):

Looks as if the P has left the Trump rally a bit early

And the third – and, I believe, last for a while – result from New Hampshire 
is in.

Hart’s Location has gone for Clinton:

 * Clinton 17 
 * Trump 14 
 * Johnson 3 
 * Bernie Sanders (write-in) 2 
 * John Kasich/Sanders (write-in) 1  
Millsfield, New Hampshire, toddles into second place with its declaration:

Trump wins Millsfield, 16-4, Sanders gets a write in

I’m trying to watch both rallies, which is complicated.

Lady Gaga has put on some shades. She is singing now.

Pence is talking about jobs and Obamacare. He is wearing a tie.
 
And now you can take your pick.

You can have Mike Pence in Grand Rapids, Michigan:
 Trump’s final campaign rally. 
OR Lady Gaga, opening for Hillary Clinton in Raleigh, North Carolina:
 Clinton’s final campaign rally.  
Hillary Clinton: 4 votes

Donald Trump: 2 votes

Gary Johnson: 1 vote

Mitt Romney (write-in!): 1 vote

Turnout: 8
