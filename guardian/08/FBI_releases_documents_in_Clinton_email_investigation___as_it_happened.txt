. Amid fierce Republican criticism of the Democratic presidential candidate, 
the party’s nominee, Donald Trump released a statement which said “Hillary 
Clinton’s answers to the FBI about her private email server defy belief” and 
added that he did not “understand how she was able to get away from 
prosecution”. 
 * Clinton’s closest aide, Huma Abedin, and Hanley “indicated the whereabouts 
of Clinton’s devices would frequently become unknown once she transitioned to a 
new device”, the documents state. “Cooper did recall two instances where he 
destroyed Clinton’s old mobile devices by breaking them in half or hitting them 
with a hammer.” 
 * Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has released a statement 
following the release of the documents from the FBI’s investigation: 
Hillary Clinton’s answers to the FBI about her private email server defy 
belief. I was absolutely shocked to see that her answers to the FBI stood in 
direct contradiction to what she told the American people. After reading these 
documents, I really don’t understand how she was able to get away from 
prosecution.

 * The nonpartisan commission that organizes the presidential debates has 
drawn from a pool of deep experience in selecting hosts for this year’s three 
scheduled meetings between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. While none of the 
moderators named on Friday has hosted a general-election presidential debate 
before, all four moderated primary debates this year. 
 * The Commission on Presidential Debates additionally named a moderator for 
this year’s single vice-presidential debate, CBS News correspondent Elaine 
Quijano. She has never hosted a debate. 
 * Amid public outcry over a sharp increase in the cost of the EpiPen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/24/epipen-ceo-hiked-prices-heather-bresch-mylan>
, a life-saving drug to stop an anaphylactic allergy attack, Hillary Clinton 
has unveiled a plan to prevent “unjustified price hikes” for older prescription 
drugs.Clinton’s proposal 
<https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/09/02/hillarys-plan-to-respond-to-unjustified-price-hikes-for-long-available-drugs/>
 would create a team of representatives from federal agencies that would 
investigate and monitor the cost of long-available prescription drugs with 
little or no competition to protect consumers from so-called “price gouging”. 
The plan sets out criteria for determining “an excessive, outlier price 
increase” and a set of enforcement tools that include making alternative drugs 
available and imposing fines or penalties to help fund expanded access.

 * The prospect of an interest rate rise in the US has receded after news that 
the world’s largest economy suffered a lull in job creation last month. There 
were 151,000 jobs added to the US economy in August, below economists’ 
forecasts for 180,000 and a marked slowdown after two bumper months of growth.
Figures from the Department of Labor 
<http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm> also showed wage growth slowed 
and the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.9%, defying expectations for it 
to edge down in August.

Have a good weekend!

Donald Trump: Clinton's answers to FBI 'defy belief'

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has released a statement 
following the release of documents from the FBI’s investigation into Hillary 
Clinton’s use of private email servers during her time as secretary of state, 
expressing disbelief that Clinton was not prosecuted:

Hillary Clinton’s answers to the FBI about her private email server defy 
belief. I was absolutely shocked to see that her answers to the FBI stood in 
direct contradiction to what she told the American people. After reading these 
documents, I really don’t understand how she was able to get away from

Hillary Clinton told the FBI that did not pay attention to the difference 
between “top secret,” “secret” and “confidential” designations for different 
materials,the Guardian’s David Smith reports

She did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not have been on an 
unclassified system. She also stated she received no particular guidance as to 
how she should use the president’s email address.

In addition, the notes say: “Clinton could not recall when she first received 
her security clearance and if she carried it with her to state via reciprocity 
from her time in the Senate. Clinton could not recall any briefing or training 
by state related to the retention of federal records or handling of classified 
information.”

Clinton was aware she was an original classification authority at the state 
department, but again “could not recall how often she used this authority or 
any training or guidance provided by state. Clinton could not give an example 
of how classification of a document was determined.”

Nor could she recall any specific briefing on how to handle information 
associated with special access programme information.

“Clinton could not recall a specific process for nominating a target for a 
drone strike,” the notes say.

More on Team Clinton’s use 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/hillary-clinton-emails-laptop-thumb-drive-archive-missing>
 - and disposal - of mobile devices:

The FBI identified a total of 13 mobile devices associated with Clinton’s two 
known phone numbers that potentially were used to send emails using 
clintonemail.com addresses.

The 58 pages of notes released on Friday, several of which were redacted, also 
related that Hanley often purchased replacement BlackBerry devices for Clinton 
during Clinton’s time at the state department. Hanley recalled buying most of 
them at AT&T stores in the Washington area. Cooper was usually responsible for 
setting them up and syncing them to the server.

Clinton’s closest aide, Huma Abedin, and Hanley ‘indicated the whereabouts of 
Clinton’s devices would frequently become unknown once she transitioned to a 
new device’, the documents state. ‘Cooper did recall two instances where he 
destroyed Clinton’s old mobile devices by breaking them in half or hitting them 
with a hammer.’

. Amid fierce Republican criticism on Friday, a spokesperson for the party’s 
presidential candidate, Donald Trump, claimed that the latest disclosures 
“reinforce [Clinton’s] tremendously bad judgment and dishonesty”.

The FBI documents describe how Monica Hanley, a former Clinton aide, received 
assistance in spring 2013 from Justin Cooper, a former aide to Bill Clinton, in 
creating an archive of Hillary Clinton’s emails. Cooper provided Hanley with an 
Apple MacBook laptop from the Clinton Foundation – the family organisation 
currentlyembroiled in controversy

 – and talked her through the process of transferring emails from Clinton’s 
private server to the laptop and a thumb drive.

“Hanley completed this task from her personal residence,” the notes record. 
The devices were intended to be stored at Clinton’s homes in New York and 
Washington. However, Hanley “forgot” to provide the archive laptop and thumb 
drive to Clinton’s staff.

In early 2014, Hanley located the laptop at her home and tried to transfer the 
email archive to an IT company, apparently without success. It appears the 
emails were then transferred to an unnamed person’s personal Gmail account and 
there were problems around Apple software not being compatible with that of 
Microsoft.

The unnamed person “told the FBI that, after the transfer was complete, he 
deleted the emails from the archive laptop but did not wipe the laptop. The 
laptop was then put in the mail, only to go missing. [Redacted] told the FBI 
that she never received the laptop from [redacted]; however, she advised that 
Clinton’s staff was moving offices at the time, and it would have been easy for 
the package to get lost during the transition period.

“Neither Hanley nor [redacted] could identify the current whereabouts of the 
archive laptop or thumb drive containing the archive, and the FBI does not have 
either item in its possession.”

Report: Hillary Clinton's staff smashed old Blackberrys with a hammer

From the Associated Press 
<http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2016/09/02/fbi-publishes-notes-its-interviews-with-hillary-clinton/UQPZcZpHb3MiY1AkQuXHKP/story.html?s_campaign=bostonglobe%3Asocialflow%3Atwitter>
:

Clinton and her legal team deleted thousands more emails she claimed were 
personal and private. The FBI report details steps taken by Clinton’s staff 
that appear intended to hamper the recovery of deleted data, including smashing 
her old Blackberry smartphones with a hammer and using special software to wipe 
the hard drive of a server she had used.

Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said Friday the campaign was pleased 
the FBI had released the documents.

Lauren Gambino

The Guardian’s Lauren Gambino has more on Green party candidate Jill Stein’s, 
err, pit-stop:
 Jill Stein Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images 
The Green party presidential nominee Jill Stein 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/third-party-candidate-vote-jill-stein-gary-johnson-evan-mcmullin>
 ran late for a Columbus campaign event on Friday because she accidentally went 
to Cincinnati, where she is due to hold a rally on Sunday.

The Harvard-educated physician <http://www.jill2016.com/about> was due to 
address supporters and students at Capital University near downtown Columbus at 
noon. She instead mistakenly arrived in Cincinnati, according to the local 
chapter of the Ohio Green party. After a redirection, she was expected to 
arrive in Columbus by 2pm.

“There was apparently a misunderstanding by the person who made her flight 
arrangements – and that was not us,” said Suzanne Patzer of theOhio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ohio> Green party.

Patzer said several dozen people had come to Schaaf Lawn on the university 
campus, but it was unclear how many would stick around to hear Stein speak. 
According to theColumbus Dispatch 
<http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/02/green-party-presidential-candidates-capital-university-speech-delayed-after-she-flies-to-wrong-city.html>
, pizzas were ordered to thank attendees for their patience.

Stein recently drew national attention over an interview with the Washington 
Post’s editorial board that was summed up by the headline: “Jill Stein’s 
fairy-tale candidacy 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jill-steins-fairy-tale-candidacy/2016/08/25/3bf8ba1a-6b08-11e6-99bf-f0cf3a6449a6_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-b%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&tid=a_inl&utm_term=.cbf15a354744>
”. The Post said her policy proposals were far-fetched and unrealistic and 
seemed unconvinced by her grasp of foreign policy.

Eric Trump: Withdrawal of Latino surrogates 'pretty amazing'

The third child and second son of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told Fox & Friends this 
morning that it was “pretty amazing” that numerous Latino advocates for his 
father’s presidential campaign backed away from their support of the candidate 
after Trump’s draconian address on immigration doubled down on his hard-line 
stance on the issue.

“It is actually pretty amazing considering the speech was actually very 
consistent and he has been very, very consistent with his plan,” Eric Trump 
said. “It’s really interesting.”

The younger Trump’s surprise is, itself, a little surprising. In the address, 
given after weeks of waffling on the candidate’s bedrock campaign issue, Trump 
called for the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants currently 
residing in the United Stateswithin the first hour of his presidency 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech>
. The address also called for a limit on legal immigration, pushing the 
far-right policy of keeping immigration levels to “historical norms,” a 
position never before embraced by a modern presidential nominee.

As many as 15 members of Trump’s two-week old Latino advisory council are 
reportedly considering abandoning the candidate as a result of the address, 
which one former advocate called “very scary 
<http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/09/01/aguilar-dropping-support-donald-trump-immigration-lead-tapper-intv.cnn>
”.

Trump’s son told Fox & Friends that the campaign still views Latino voters as 
a possible constituency.

“It’s very important to us,” Trump said. “If you look at the Hispanic 
community and the Latino community, they’ve largely been left behind in this 
country.”

A new poll of Latino voters by America’s Voice / Latino Decisions has Clinton 
up 70-19 on Trump.

In 2012, according to exit polls 
<http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/race/president/>, Obama won Latino 
voters 71-27. So Clinton here shows about the same level of support Obama had – 
while Trump is quite a bit behind Romney.

investigate and monitor the cost of long-available prescription drugs with 
little or no competition to protect consumers from so-called “price gouging”.

increase” and a set of enforcement tools that include making alternative drugs 
available and imposing fines or penalties to help fund expanded access.

She did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not have been on an 
unclassified system. She also stated she received no particular guidance as to 
how she should use the president’s email address.

In addition, the notes say: “Clinton could not recall when she first received 
her security clearance and if she carried it with her to state via reciprocity 
from her time in the Senate. Clinton could not recall any briefing or training 
by state related to the retention of federal records or handling of classified 
information.”

Clinton was aware she was an original classification authority at the state 
department, but again “could not recall how often she used this authority or 
any training or guidance provided by state. Clinton could not give an example 
of how classification of a document was determined.”

Nor could she recall any specific briefing on how to handle information 
associated with special access programme information.

“Clinton could not recall a specific process for nominating a target for a 
drone strike,” the notes say.

 - and disposal - of mobile devices:

The FBI identified a total of 13 mobile devices associated with Clinton’s two 
known phone numbers that potentially were used to send emails using 
clintonemail.com addresses.

The 58 pages of notes released on Friday, several of which were redacted, also 
related that Hanley often purchased replacement BlackBerry devices for Clinton 
during Clinton’s time at the state department. Hanley recalled buying most of 
them at AT&T stores in the Washington area. Cooper was usually responsible for 
setting them up and syncing them to the server.

Clinton’s closest aide, Huma Abedin, and Hanley ‘indicated the whereabouts of 
Clinton’s devices would frequently become unknown once she transitioned to a 
new device’, the documents state. ‘Cooper did recall two instances where he 
destroyed Clinton’s old mobile devices by breaking them in half or hitting them 
with a hammer.’

 from her time as secretary of state are missing, according to FBI notes 
released on Friday.

The phrase “Clinton could not recall” litters the summary of the FBI’s 
investigation, which concluded in Julythat she should not face charges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation>
. Amid fierce Republican criticism on Friday, a spokesperson for the party’s 
presidential candidate, Donald Trump, claimed that the latest disclosures 
“reinforce [Clinton’s] tremendously bad judgment and dishonesty”.

The FBI documents describe how Monica Hanley, a former Clinton aide, received 
assistance in spring 2013 from Justin Cooper, a former aide to Bill Clinton, in 
creating an archive of Hillary Clinton’s emails. Cooper provided Hanley with an 
Apple MacBook laptop from the Clinton Foundation – the family organisation 
currentlyembroiled in controversy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/26/election-2016-clinton-foundation-trump-campaign-live>
 – and talked her through the process of transferring emails from Clinton’s 
private server to the laptop and a thumb drive.

“Hanley completed this task from her personal residence,” the notes record. 
The devices were intended to be stored at Clinton’s homes in New York and 
Washington. However, Hanley “forgot” to provide the archive laptop and thumb 
drive to Clinton’s staff.

In early 2014, Hanley located the laptop at her home and tried to transfer the 
email archive to an IT company, apparently without success. It appears the 
emails were then transferred to an unnamed person’s personal Gmail account and 
there were problems around Apple software not being compatible with that of 
Microsoft.

The unnamed person “told the FBI that, after the transfer was complete, he 
deleted the emails from the archive laptop but did not wipe the laptop. The 
laptop was then put in the mail, only to go missing. [Redacted] told the FBI 
that she never received the laptop from [redacted]; however, she advised that 
Clinton’s staff was moving offices at the time, and it would have been easy for 
the package to get lost during the transition period.

“Neither Hanley nor [redacted] could identify the current whereabouts of the 
archive laptop or thumb drive containing the archive, and the FBI does not have 
either item in its possession.”

Clinton and her legal team deleted thousands more emails she claimed were 
personal and private. The FBI report details steps taken by Clinton’s staff 
that appear intended to hamper the recovery of deleted data, including smashing 
her old Blackberry smartphones with a hammer and using special software to wipe 
the hard drive of a server she had used.

Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said Friday the campaign was pleased 
the FBI had released the documents.

noon. She instead mistakenly arrived in Cincinnati, according to the local 
chapter of the Ohio Green party. After a redirection, she was expected to 
arrive in Columbus by 2pm.

“There was apparently a misunderstanding by the person who made her flight 
arrangements – and that was not us,” said Suzanne Patzer of theOhio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ohio> Green party.

Patzer said several dozen people had come to Schaaf Lawn on the university 
campus, but it was unclear how many would stick around to hear Stein speak. 
According to theColumbus Dispatch 
<http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/02/green-party-presidential-candidates-capital-university-speech-delayed-after-she-flies-to-wrong-city.html>
, pizzas were ordered to thank attendees for their patience.

Stein recently drew national attention over an interview with the Washington 
Post’s editorial board that was summed up by the headline: “Jill Stein’s 
fairy-tale candidacy 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jill-steins-fairy-tale-candidacy/2016/08/25/3bf8ba1a-6b08-11e6-99bf-f0cf3a6449a6_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-b%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&tid=a_inl&utm_term=.cbf15a354744>
”. The Post said her policy proposals were far-fetched and unrealistic and 
seemed unconvinced by her grasp of foreign policy.

Still no word from Donald Trump’s campaign about the FBI’s release of 
documents in its investigation of rival Hillary Clinton’s use of private email 
servers during her tenure as secretary of state:

The third child and second son of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> told Fox & Friends this 
morning that it was “pretty amazing” that numerous Latino advocates for his 
father’s presidential campaign backed away from their support of the candidate 
after Trump’s draconian address on immigration doubled down on his hard-line 
stance on the issue.

“It is actually pretty amazing considering the speech was actually very 
consistent and he has been very, very consistent with his plan,” Eric Trump 
said. “It’s really interesting.”

The younger Trump’s surprise is, itself, a little surprising. In the address, 
given after weeks of waffling on the candidate’s bedrock campaign issue, Trump 
called for the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants currently 
residing in the United Stateswithin the first hour of his presidency 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech>
. The address also called for a limit on legal immigration, pushing the 
far-right policy of keeping immigration levels to “historical norms,” a 
position never before embraced by a modern presidential nominee.

As many as 15 members of Trump’s two-week old Latino advisory council are 
reportedly considering abandoning the candidate as a result of the address, 
which one former advocate called “very scary

”.

Trump’s son told Fox & Friends that the campaign still views Latino voters as 
a possible constituency.

“It’s very important to us,” Trump said. “If you look at the Hispanic 
community and the Latino community, they’ve largely been left behind in this 
country.”
 
A new poll of Latino voters by America’s Voice / Latino Decisions has Clinton 
up 70-19 on Trump.

In 2012, according to exit polls 
<http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/race/president/>, Obama won Latino 
voters 71-27. So Clinton here shows about the same level of support Obama had – 
while Trump is quite a bit behind Romney.

Here’s more fodder for the Clinton critics who agree with the FBI director 
that she was “extremely careless” in her handling of classified information:
