It was a concert which featured tape-recorded bird calls, one band member 
sawing logs, another throwing potatoes at a gong, a bubble machine causing 
havoc and a crew member dressed as an admiral throwing daffodils into the 
audience.

And it changed rock performance for ever, the Victoria and Albert Museum said 
on Wednesday as it announced details of its big spring 2017 exhibition: a 
retrospective ofPink Floyd <https://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd>.


The exhibition follows the global success of its David Bowie Is show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/17/david-bowie-is-exhibition-review>
 and was a “great fit” for a museum so dedicated to art, design and 
performance, said curator Victoria Broackes.

She said the V&A was uniquely placed to stage such a show, adding: “Pink Floyd 
occupied a distinctive experimental space, consistently pushed artistic 
boundaries and produced some of the most iconic imagery in popular culture.”

The exhibition will feature a laser light show and previously unseen concert 
footage as well as more than 350 objects and artefacts including instruments, 
handwritten lyrics, posters, architectural drawings and psychedelic prints.

Tech fans will also be delighted to hear it will have on display something 
called theAzimuth Co-ordinator, a custom-made quadrophonic speaker system and 
joysticks 
<http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O76817/azimuth-co-ordinator-sound-equipment-bernard-speight/>
 which Pink Floyd used to sweep prerecorded sound effects and instruments 
around a room.


The co-ordinator is already in the V&A’s collection and was first used at the 
concert featuring birds, potatoes and bubbles, held in May 1967 at the newly 
opened Queen Elizabeth Hall in London.

The gig’s 50th anniversary will coincide with the V&A exhibition. Billed as 
offering “space age relaxation for the climax of spring, electronic 
composition, colour and image projection, girls and Pink Floyd”, the Games for 
May show was like nothing which had come before it.

“As well as amazing their audience, their performance that day significantly 
raised expectations of live rock shows,” said Broackes. “It was a major turning 
point for the band and a major turning point for rock music in general.”

The band’s drummer, Nick Mason, said the show came at a time when all bands 
performed the same way, usually on a bill of three acts. “That didn’t suit us 
at all because nearly always we were blown off stage by these far more 
attractive bands who were actually rather better at playing than we were. We 
needed our own space and to do it in our own way,” he said

It was game-changing, although trampled flowers on the floor and bubble stains 
on the seats ensured no rock band was invited back to the venue for some time.

The V&A opened ticket sales and announced the exhibition by flying a giant 
inflatable pink pig near the museum’s entrance, a reference to the inflatable 
swine which once soared over Battersea power station and featured on the cover 
of Pink Floyd’s 1977 album Animals.

Fortunately there was no repeat of what happened 40 years ago when the pig 
broke free and was sighted by an alarmed airline pilot, leading to the 
cancellation of flights at Heathrow. It finally landed at a farm in Kent.

The band were founded in 1965 by students Syd Barrett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/06/biography.music>, Roger Waters, 
Richard Wright and Mason. Barrett, who parted ways with Floyd in 1968, died in 
2006 and Wright died in 2008. The remaining members are collaborating for the 
V&A show.

Mason said he was surprised he and remaining members were still doing things 
together after 50 years. “If you told me that we would still exist even four 
years after we started professionally I would have been surprised. Now I feel 
like something that’s owned by the National Trust.”

He was a big fan of the V&A’s Bowie exhibition and predicted big things for the
Pink Floyd <https://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd> one. “I think we are 
going to be able to do things that hopefully have never seen or heard before,” 
said Mason.

The V&A’s director, Martin Roth, a self-confessed Floyd fan, said the band 
were a “great British success story” and recalled first suggesting working with 
them during a chance meeting with Mason five years ago.


“He looked at me and said: ‘Oh Martin, we are about big sound, huge images and 
I’m not sure this works in a museum.’” Hopefully, the V&A has proved itself 
more than capable, he added.

The exhibition will also mark the 50th anniversary of the band’s first single, 
Arnold Layne, a release which has been followed by more than 200m record sales.

Unlike the Bowie show, there is no well-ordered archive for the V&A to sift 
through, but Mason said many lofts were scrabbled through and more than enough 
personal material was found to include in the show.

“I did think we’d be short of material. That’s turned out to be entirely 
incorrect. I can’t tell you how much stuff won’t fit in,” he said.

• The Pink Floyd Exhibition: Their Mortal Remains opens on 13 May 2017 and 
runs for 20 weeks.
