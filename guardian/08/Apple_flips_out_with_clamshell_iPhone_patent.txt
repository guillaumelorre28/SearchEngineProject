It’s time to party like it’s 1999: Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> has patented a flip-phone.

Admittedly, the phone depicted in the patent, spotted by AppleInsider 
<http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/11/22/apple-patents-foldable-iphone-with-flexible-display-that-can-clip-onto-clothing>
, is rather more advanced than 2004’s Motorola Razr. The patent envisages a 
phone with a flexible OLED screen on the front, designed to fold in the middle 
with a more conventionally hinged back, allowing the whole thing to fold in 
half for portability.

Patents are not products, of course, and there’s every possibility that Apple 
may never ship anything using the idea. But it indicates a few potential 
changes in the company’s thinking.

Apple has yet to make much use of OLED screens. A newer display technology 
than the backlit LCDs that are used in everyiPhone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone>, iPad, Mac and iPod, OLED 
displays emit their own light without the need for a backlight.

As a result, OLED displays have darker blacks and bolder colours, as well as 
lower power consumption. The company has only used them in the Apple Watch so 
far, but OLED screens are widely expected to feature in 2017’s iPhone.

The patent was filed in July 2014, before the Apple Watch was announced, and 
what it depicts isn’t yet possible. While bendable or flexible OLED screenshave 
hit trade shows <http://www.oled-info.com/flexible-oled>, few shipping products 
have incorporated them, except for a few curved televisions and smartphones, 
and none have yet been demonstrated that can bend to the extreme degrees 
depicted in Apple’s patents.
