With the number of foundation-level doctors applying to train with NHS 
Scotland increasing by 27% last year what is it about living and working in 
Scotland that’s so attractive to the next generation of doctors?

Whether in an urban or rural setting, for many GPs it’s the balance between 
excellent training, interesting caseload and quality of life. Dr David Hogg 
became a GP partner on the Isle of Arran in 2013.

“Arran itself is about the same size as greater Glasgow,” says Hogg. “It takes 
about two hours to drive round it and we’ve got 5,000 people here but it goes 
up to 25,000 in the summer so we cope with big changes of population.

“Combining the challenge of an incredibly diverse rural GP practice with the 
lifestyle appeal of living on a beautiful island is, for me, an unbeatable 
combination.

“90% of what we do is general practice like anywhere else but the extra 10% 
totally stretches out these extremes.

A member of Arran Mountain Rescue, Hogg was instrumental in setting up Arran 
Resilience, which brings together all the emergency services on the island. He 
publishes ablog <http://ruralgp.com/> about life and work as a rural GP and is 
an active member of the Rural GP Association of Scotland.

Dr Lynsey Yeoman is a recently qualified GP at Hunter Street Homeless Services 
in Glasgow. She finds the variety of GP work and continuity of care rewarding. 
“I really enjoyed my training – it was very well supported and you were made to 
feel part of the family when in hospital or GP practice,” she says. “My 
practice serves some of Scotland’s most deprived communities. As a trainee I 
had a placement in a more affluent area, so I’ve enjoyed seeing the contrast.

“When I started training in Scotland there were junior doctors from all over 
the UK and a lot of them have stayed here or come back again because we’re a 
friendly nation.”

Dr Rizwan Khalid returned from A&E to general practice in Largs, a town of 
13,000 on Scotland’s west coast. “I’m originally from West Yorkshire and my 
training was partly in Scotland and partly in Yorkshire,” he says. “My wife and 
I have three young children and we found that Scotland offered a lot for them – 
a good education and a quality environment for the family. I have also spoken 
to GP colleagues about the workload and quality of life in Scotland and they 
are highly positive.”

Education for Scotland 
Regardless of the setting, Scotland has long had a tradition of medical 
excellence. The GMC trainee survey consistently ranks Scotland’s GP training 
programme among the UK’s very best.

Professor Stewart Irvine, medical director for recruitment and training body 
NHS Education for Scotland, says: “Scotland’s supportive and flexible training 
approach offers trainees exceptional scope for personal development with 
out-of-programme experiences and post-training fellowships.”

“We have dedicated GP educational supervisors across a breadth of different 
practices, offer specific exam support courses and have high exam success 
rates. Scotland has something to suit all trainees in terms of geography and 
work-life balance, from the city to the country.”
