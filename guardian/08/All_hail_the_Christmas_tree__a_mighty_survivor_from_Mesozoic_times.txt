Palaeontologists have a slightly different take on the world, even at 
Christmas: Christmas dinner isthe ceremonial dissection of an avian dinosaur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/07/your-christmas-dinner-dinosaur-turkey-birds-evolution>
, and there’s no finer joke than ahalf a billion year old arthropod named after 
Santa Claus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctacaris>. And so it is with 
Christmas trees: most people see them as the slightly pagan focal point of 
their festive decorations. I see this as the one time of year when people 
actually pay any attention to these mighty survivors from Mesozoic times.

In the UK, the Norway Spruce Picea abies is the traditional species to be 
festooned with decorations of questionable taste. It exhibits all of the 
qualities associated with most modern conifers: it is an evergreen woody tree, 
bearing seeds in cones. It shows monopodial growth (it has one trunk), and 
strong apical dominance (it grows up more strongly than its branches grow out). 
It also produces resin, which protects the tree from fungal attack and from 
pests. It is long-lived (a group ofclones in Sweden 
<http://info.adm.umu.se/NYHETER/PressmeddelandeEng.aspx?id=3061> was 
carbon-dated at 9550 years old) and is relatively slow-growing: this year’s
Trafalgar Square Christmas tree 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/dec/11/hunt-for-norway-perfect-christmas-tree-trafalgar-square>
 is 27 metres tall and was 95 years old when it was felled.

The Norway Spruce was also the first gymnosperm to have its genome sequenced 
<http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v497/n7451/full/nature12211.html>. 
Comprising 20 billion base pairs, it is massive (around seven times the size of 
the human genome), has 29,000 functional genes, and contains a very high 
proportion of DNA sequence repeats. The genusPicea can be traced back 130 
million years, thanks toremarkable fossil cones showing anatomical preservation 
<http://www.amjbot.org/content/99/6/1069>, and containing Picea pollen, from 
the Lower Cretaceous of Vancouver Bay.

In North America, the most popular Christmas trees are various species of fir 
tree (genusAbies). The oldest known fossil fir is Abies Milleri 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abies_milleri> from the Eocene of USA, about 50 
million years ago. Both firs and spruces are members of the Pinaceae family, 
which is distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, and share a common 
ancestor. Since a recognisable spruce fossil has been identified in rocks 130 
million years old, this means that the other conifers within the Pinaceae 
family, including fir trees, must have already split along their individual 
evolutionary paths before then. Whichever side of the Atlantic you reside in, 
your Christmas tree is ancient indeed.

Another conifer that suffers regular Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> abuse is the Norfolk 
Island Pine,Araucaria heterophylla. Not actually a pine at all, but a member of 
the same genus as the Monkey Puzzle tree, this poor tree gets mass-produced, 
and, on occasion, spray-painted green, for sale as a festive houseplant. The 
Araucariaceae family, which is distributed today across the Southern 
Hemisphere, has an extensive global fossil record. Fossil wood from Petrified 
Forest National Park in Arizona, and dated Late Triassic 230 million years, is 
attributed to the family, but again, reproductive structures are key to 
identifying conifers.

Unequivocal Araucaria cones <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucaria_mirabilis>
, preserved in silica, are found in the Cerro Cuadrado Petrified Forest of 
Patagonia, Argentina. These push the fossil record for the Monkey Puzzle family 
back to the Middle Jurassic, around 160 million years ago. Molecular studies 
indicate that the Pinaceae had already made their evolutionary split from the 
Araucariaceae and the rest of the conifers by this point.

In fact, if you could time-travel back to the Jurassic you would have plenty 
more festive tree options. Conifers were the dominant land plants for most of 
the Mesozoic Era, and while we tend to think of them as high latitude forest 
trees, there’s good evidence that conifers filled all sorts of ecological 
niches that we associate with the flowering plants which usurped them during 
the Cretaceous Period. The extinct Cheirolepidiaceae family is thought to have 
included fleshy, jointed, deciduous shrubs, adapted to hot, arid, salt-marsh 
conditions – most unlikely Christmas trees and difficult to know where you 
would stick your fairy.

Quite when the first conifer appeared is not well understood, but there are 
candidates in the general mish-mash of early seed plants.Plants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plants> such as Walchia from around 
300 million years ago had foliage resembling a modern cypress, with a large 
woody trunk.Cordaites is of a similar age, with large strap-like leaves, and 
distinctive large seeds. Unpicking the evolutionary relationships of the 
earliest conifers remains a challenge for palaeobotanists, and one that 
molecular studies are unable to resolve. But at least 300 million years of 
evolutionary history isn’t a bad track record for an essential bit of Christmas 
tradition.
