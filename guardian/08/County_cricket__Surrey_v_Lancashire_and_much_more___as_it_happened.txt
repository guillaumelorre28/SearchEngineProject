SUSSEX BEAT GLAMORGAN BY 2 WICKETS

Oh my god. What a day. 2 incredible chases. 2 promotion campaigns still alive. 
Garton hits three through the covers to level the scores and steal the strike. 
He has a big swish at Hogan, and misses. Twice. He nudges to leg but there’s no 
single. There’s an edge to third man and that is that! Four runs! Brown and 
Garton hug, then hands are shaken. Sussex are fourth.

WHAT A GAME. WHAT A SPORT. 

Anyway, I’m signing off. My game finished at 12.15!!!

Thanks for your company on these four fine days. It’s been a ball. But I 
really need to go to the pub, and I rather feel I’ve earned it! I’m on holiday 
next week, but am back for the penultimate round. I will see you all then, and 
I very much look forward to it. Keep commenting!

No! Adams is out for 96 at Taunton! That’s 7 (seven) 50s (fifties) without a

Durham draw with Warwickshire

Paul Collingwood shakes hands with Ian Bell - what a lovely thought - and

We need to talk about Joe Clarke. He has 97 for Worcestershire v Northants. 
They need 200 from 34 overs. If he’s there at the end, they do it.

Oh my god. What a day. 2 incredible chases. 2 promotion campaigns still alive. 
Garton hits three through the covers to level the scores and steal the strike. 
He has a big swish at Hogan, and misses. Twice. He nudges to leg but there’s no 
single. There’s an edge to third man and that is that! Four runs! Brown and 
Garton hug, then hands are shaken. Sussex are fourth.

WHAT A GAME. WHAT A SPORT. 

Anyway, I’m signing off. My game finished at 12.15!!!

Thanks for your company on these four fine days. It’s been a ball. But I 
really need to go to the pub, and I rather feel I’ve earned it! I’m on holiday 
next week, but am back for the penultimate round. I will see you all then, and 
I very much look forward to it. Keep commenting!
 
Four to Brown, Sussex need 5. Brown has 41
 
Sussex need 10. Glam need 2 wickets. I need a very stiff drink.
 
OMG THAT IS THAT. A leg-bye, then Lloyds Leach has hit a six!!!!! They’ve 
chased down 401 with an over to spare!
 
FOUR FOR SHANTRY. FOUR NEEDED
 
Jeez this is so tense. 
 
Nine needed from 12 at New Road.
 
Four to George Garton! Wagg driven through the covers! Sussex need 15.
 
Briggs gone in Cardiff. Barnard gone in Worcester.
 
13 needed off 4 overs for Worcs. That’s 3 shots. Come on lads.

Sussex need 24. Glamorgan need 3 wickets.
 
50 partnership for the eighth Sussex wicket. 27 to win.
 
I’m very tense and have quite a tight deadline for my round-up here...
 
Sussex need 40 overs from 12.1 overs. 
 
33 with 3 in hand for Worcs to win. Eight overs to do it. 
 
Sussex need 46 to win...
 
Three fours in an over for Lloyds Leach!!!
 Alex Winter (@_alexwinter) 
Just three wickets in hand now for @WorcsCCC <https://twitter.com/WorcsCCC> 46

Worcestershire looking good...
 
Archer goes at Cardiff and Sussex still require 77. Three wickets standing. 
Caught behind was Archer.

Somerset.

83 off 90 for a remarkable, season-saving win for Worcestershire.

Worcestershire need 99 with five wickets in hand. On the brink of the last 
hour.
 
Successive sixes for Ross Whiteley keeps Worcestershire in the hunt. This is 
all set up for Jack Shantry.
 
No! Adams is out for 96 at Taunton! That’s 7 (seven) 50s (fifties) without a 
century this season. One of the good guys, is Jimmy Adams.
 
Sussex’s target into double figures as Wright pumps TvdG through the legside 
for four.

But then he’s bowled through the gate!!

Four in hand, 96 required. Over to you, Ben Brown, although Jofra, Briggs and 
Garton can all do the batting.

You can watch all this great cricket here 
<http://www.glamorgancricket.com/stream.html>. But don’t close the CC - live! 
tab. We want you to stay.
 
Hampshire lead Somerset! Jimmy Adams has 96. No one has more champo scores of 
50+ without a ton this season.
 
If Sussex can get a win, that will be a massive game.

Paul Collingwood shakes hands with Ian Bell - what a lovely thought - and 
Warks and Durham declare their draw. Neither team out of the relegation woods 
yet.
 
Oh no. Joe Clarke gone now. Three in two overs for Sanderson (well bowled that 
man) - Worcs need 126 with five in hand.
 
Mitchell, then Rhodes go in quick succession at New Road. Clarke still there, 
Worcestershire still need 126 in a bit over 21 overs. Six in hand.
 
Wicket at Cardiff ... Sussex five down! Wiese bowled by Timm van der Gugten. 
Wright joined by Brown with 105 required.
 
Oh no! Badger Borthwick goes for 92! 191 for three; handshakes close, surely.
 
I’m watching the stream here. Great game 
<http://www.glamorgancricket.com/stream.html>. Wagg bowling beautifully but 
also being a bit of a numpty too.
 
Big wicket in Cardiff! Wagg gets Nash caught behind. 108 required from 27.3.
 
Hardus Nails dismisses Luke Norwell and that is that. Dominant display from 
Kent, who go second, behind Essex. Eight in the match for Mr H.Nails.
 
A ton for Daryl Mitchell, 2 in the game. Worcs need 144 in 25 overs. 
 
Scores level at the Riverside! Patel got Stoneman but Borthwick is still there 
on 82, and I suspect handshake watch can begin pretty soon.
 
Timm van der Gugten is a very good looking man.

We need to talk about Joe Clarke. He has 97 for Worcestershire v Northants. 
They need 200 from 34 overs. If he’s there at the end, they do it.
 
Scores:

 * Surrey beat Lancashire by 10 wickets 
 * Yorkshire beat Notts by loads of runs 
 * Durham are going to draw with Warwickshire 
 * Hampshire are going to draw with Somerset 
 * Sussex are 92-2 and need 141 more to beat Glamorgan 
 * Worcs are 195-2 and need 206 more to beat Northants 
 * Kent need two Gloucestershire wickets to win that game
