Amazon delivery drivers admitted breaking speed limits and said they did not 
always have time for toilet breaks because of the pressure to stay on schedule, 
according toa BBC investigation <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37708996>.

Drivers for companies contracted to work for the online retailer told an 
undercover reporter that they were expected to deliver up to 200 parcels a day.

The report also claimed some drivers said they were effectively paid less than 
the minimum wage of £7.20, because of the long hours worked to deliver all 
their assigned parcels.

A spokesman for Amazon said: “Over 100 small and medium-sized businesses 
across the UK are providing work opportunities to thousands of people 
delivering parcels toAmazon <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon> 
customers. We are committed to ensuring that the people contracted by our 
independent delivery providers are fairly compensated, treated with respect, 
follow all applicable laws and drive safely.”

An undercover BBC reporter took a job with AHC services, one of the agencies 
that supplies drivers to Amazon Logistics todeliver parcels

The reporter worked for two weeks based at Amazon’s Avonmouth depot in 
Bristol, and claimed he worked more than 11 hours a day delivering parcels, 
which was against the law.

“Our delivery providers are obligated to ensure that drivers do not spend more 
than 10 hours per day driving,” Amazon’s spokesman said. “As independent 
contractors of our delivery providers, drivers deliver at their own pace, take 
breaks at their discretion, and are able to choose the suggested route or 
develop their own.”

Amazon said that over the past six months, the average driving time for 
drivers in the UK was 8.5 hours a day.

The reporter also said he was paid £93.47 for three days’ work in his first 
week, following deductions such as optional van hire for a week, and insurance. 
That was the equivalent of £2.59 an hour. He received the equivalent of £4.76 
an hour in his second week when he worked four days.

The BBC said Amazon Logistics required agency drivers to be self-employed, and 
therefore not entitled to thenational minimum wage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/minimum-wage> (for staff under 25) and the 
national living wage (over 25) or employment rights such as sick pay or holiday 
pay.

Amazon said: “Our delivery providers have always been expected to pay more 
than the national living wage, and we recently clarified with all of our 
delivery providers that we expect drivers to receive a minimum of £12 per hour 
before bonuses, incentives and fuel reimbursements.”

Former driver Charlie Chikaviro said the pressure to deliver parcels left him 
with no choice but to drive fast. “I had to, the way it was designed. You’re 
going to have to do that. I had a few crashes ... but not bad crashes,” he said.

The Oxford-based AHC dismissed the BBC claims as “historic and based on 
isolated examples which occurred over a year ago”. It told the BBC: “Since then 
we have made changes to the way our checks are carried out and taken a number 
of steps to improve our ways of working.”

The firm also said it took road safety and the welfare of its contracted 
drivers seriously and that drivers were free to choose when they worked.
