Frances Morris, director of Tate Modern

Morris knows Tate inside out, having joined the gallery as a curator in 1987 
and working her way to the top. This year she became the first woman to head
Tate Modern <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tate-modern> since its 
opening in 2000.


Energetic and enthusiastic, Morris has been deeply impressive in a very short 
space of time, taking charge as the museum’s £260m Switch House extension 
opened.

 She has promised more diverse displays with more work by women and artists 
not from western Europe and north America.

Maria Balshaw, director of Manchester city galleries and the Whitworth

Hugely respected and liked, the question often asked about Balshaw is what big 
job will she go to after a decade in Manchester? She of course would say she 
already has a big job.

Balshaw became director of the Whitworth in 2006, overseeing a successful £15m 
redevelopment that helped win it the UK museum of the year prize in 2015, the 
year in which she also received her CBE and wonApollo magazine personality of 
the year 
<http://www.apollo-magazine.com/apollo-awards-2015-personality-of-the-year-maria-balshaw/>
.

Balshaw took on the extra role of director of Manchester city galleries in 
2011.

Iwona Blazwick, director of Whitechapel Art 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art> Gallery

There is no template for appointing the new director, but Blazwick would 
follow the example ofSir Nicholas Serota 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/08/sir-nicholas-serota-appointed-chairman-arts-council-england-tate>
 in that he moved from the top job at the Whitechapel to the top job at Tate.

One of the most important of arts movers and shakers who seems to know 
everyone, Blazwick has been in east London since 2001, overseeing the gallery’s 
£13.5m redevelopment that was completed in 2009, doubling its space. She has 
long been talked about as Serota’s possible successor.

As a young curator, she was also the first person to give Damien Hirst a solo 
show in a public gallery.

Sheena Wagstaff, head of modern and contemporary art at the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art, New York

Another Tate insider who was chief curator at Tate Modern before, in 2012, 
being lured to the Met to a new role that has involved the task of creating the 
Met Breuer, a new outpost (for eight years, at least) for modern and 
contemporary art in the former Whitney Museum on Madison Avenue.

In one interview she said she had the “best job in the world” 
<http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/25/the-met-and-the-now>. But would 
London offer an even better one?

Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery

Born in Connecticut and raised in Yorkshire, Cullinan was appointed as only 
the 12th director in the NPG’s 158-year history in early 2015. He also knows 
Tate well, having worked as a curator at Tate Modern for six years and 
co-curating the blockbuster Matisse cutouts exhibition with Serota.

Before the NPG, a place he first worked as front-of-house assistant in his 
early 20s, he spent two years at the Met in New York.

He is in his late 30s, although he looks younger. Does the Tate job come too 
soon?

Tim Marlow, artistic director of the Royal Academy of Arts


A superb communicator and regular broadcaster, Marlow joined the RA in 2014 to 
a job that was once called exhibitions secretary. He joined at a crucial time 
with the RA linking to and expanding into a building it acquired in 2001, 6 
Burlington Gardens.


He quickly made his mark at the RA by announcing a major exhibition by Ai 
Weiwei. Easygoing and approachable, Marlow was previously in charge of 
exhibitions at the White Cube commercial galleries.
