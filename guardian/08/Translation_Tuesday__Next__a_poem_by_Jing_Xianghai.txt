Jing Xianghai, a psychiatrist by day, is the best-selling Taiwanese poet of 
his generation. The following poem is taken from his collectionNobita 
(pronouncedDa Xiong in Chinese).

*****

The next one won’t be any good either.

The next one won’t give you satisfaction.

The next one won’t stay up to go through his porn collection and burn you DVDs.

The next one can’t be counted on to go from fists to smiles the moment he sees 
you.

The next one won’t conquer mountains for your sake,
 push you out of the way of glaciers, or bird droppings. The next one won’t
 go AWOL to come on a date, suck in his tummy or sprint barefoot
 after a rubbish truck at midnight for you. The next one won’t
 be any good at all, because the next one won’t
 play along about the fans pressed against your window
 when, exasperated, you bellow, “What the fuck are you still doing here, Next!”
 the force like being struck by a baseball and felled…or take pains
 to collect the shards of whichever broken vase or bowl of yours
 and piece together its original shape.

The next one won’t—will never in a million years—wait for spring
 when he can have a go again at being the next one
 of your dreams.
