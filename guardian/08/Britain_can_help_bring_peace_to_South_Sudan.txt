Simon Tisdall (Britain’s military gamble in South Sudan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/british-troops-south-sudan-un-peacekeeping-force>
, 9 September) says that the rebels in South Sudan “are supported by the Sudan 
government of Omar al-Bashir”. Sudan has consistently declared support for the 
elected government, with which it signed a cooperation agreement in 2012. When 
the civil war began in December 2013 Sudan (as the country most affected by 
instability in the new state) won praise for involvement in reconciliation 
contacts. During a visit to Khartoum in January 2014, Mark Simmonds, the UK 
minister for Africa, said “I very much commend Sudan for the balanced role it 
has played so far in support for the Igad-led negotiations.”

Riek Machar fled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (not Sudan as Tisdall 
states); but flew to Sudan for medical treatment. When he was replaced by Taban 
Deng Gai, President al-Bashir welcomed the new vice-president of South Sudan in 
Khartoum. Britain has a historical connection with the two Sudans. The decision 
to send troops to help stability inSouth Sudan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-sudan> deserves praise and should not 
be misunderstood as a “gamble” or an attempt “to maintain the fiction of global 
reach”, as Tisdall writes. It is also in line with the AU’s call for more 
troops, which was supported by Sudan.
