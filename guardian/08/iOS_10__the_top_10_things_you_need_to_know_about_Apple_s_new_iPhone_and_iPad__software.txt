Apple’s iOS <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ios> 10 will begin hitting

has had in years. Here are 10 things that have changed.

 iOS 10 Messages pushes iMessages in the direction of Facebook Messenger. 
Photograph: Apple 
Move over Snapchat and Facebook Messenger, Apple’s built-in Messages are now 
fun. You can send stickers, “Tapback” reactions, transitions (think along the 
the lines of magic ink) - animations, rich links, larger emojis and best of 
all, “emojification” which looks at what you’ve written and allows you to tap 
on words to substitute for emojis.

You can also draw or write on the screen and use third-party apps directly 
within Messages. It’s like Facebook Messenger but with end-to-end encryption.

 iOS 10 gives notifications a much-needed overhaul. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs 
for the Guardian 
The biggest visual change to iOS 10 is the new rich notifications and quick 
reply features that have made them much more useful. You no longer have to open 
the app to view videos, photos and reply. All you have to do is tap on the 
notification to launch the app or force press to popup a preview.

You can also force press on the clear button in the notification shade to 
clear all notifications, which, frankly, should have been there from the 
beginning. Clearing them individually still requires a swipe and a tap on the 
clear button, but you can delete emails straight from the expanded 
notification, so that’s progress.

3. Lockscreen

Along with notifications, the lockscreen has been made more useful. The 
widgets from the “today” pull-down can now be viewed with a swipe right on the 
lockscreen. The same bunch of widgets is available on a swipe right on the home 
screen, where Siri’s app suggestions used to be, with Siri’s suggestions moving 
to a pull down on the home screen.

You can also now set your phone to light up when you lift it. The raise to 
wake makes accessing the widgets and notifications easier without accidentally 
unlocking your phone with a home button press.

4. Delete stocks (and other Apple apps)

You can now “delete” Stocks and most other Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> apps. It’s not truly gone, but 
it is hidden and won’t appear on your home screen or launch when something 
tries to activate it.

Stocks: your days are numbered

 Control Centre is now spread over two panes. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the 
Guardian 
Now there are two panes to the Control Centre. The first shows the same quick 
controls as before, apart from music, which has been moved to a second pane you 
have to swipe over to. The music pane shows the app that’s playing something, 
playback controls, volume and a drop-down to select the output device, say, if 
you have a new set of Bluetooth headphones connected.

Whichever pane you used last reappears the next time you swipe up to activate 
Control Centre.

 Force pressing on folders now pops up the app that’s currently demanding your 
attention. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian 
More of Apple’s apps have become 3D-touch enabled, while the whole system has 
more gestures for the pressure-sensitive screens introduced with theiPhone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> 6S. Force pressing on the 
Calendar app icon, for instance, pops up the calendar widget.

Force pressing on a folder with apps with notifications in them now pops up a 
list of the apps for quick access to the one that’s demanding your attention. 
Force pressing the bottom row of Control Centre icons also pops up some quick 
settings such as the intensity of the flash light, but not for the top row for 
things like available Wi-Fi networks or Bluetooth devices.

 iOS 10 Photos adds a bit of automated smarts into the mix, with face 
recognition and similar common features. Photograph: Apple 
Apple’s Photos now has many of the same features of rivals such as Google 
Photos. Face, scene and object recognition is built in, as well as automatic 
smart grouping for location, topics, trips, people and other activities. All 
together its called Memories, but while Google Photos and others require photos 
to be sent off for analysis, Apple has managed it on the device. The success of 
such intelligent photo analysis remains to be seen.

 Apple Maps is steadily improving with useful public transport and search 
functions, but is still some way behind fan-favourites Citymapper and Google 
Maps. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian 
Apple Maps continues the long, hard slog to catch up to Google Maps. Now it 
notifies of traffic and offers faster routes, pops up suggestions for nearby 
places.

It also looks cleaner and puts search front-and-centre, with quick route 
selection, which is easy to use, particularly for places with public transport. 
It may not be enough to attract die-hard Google Maps or Citymapper users, but 
it’s certainly improving.

 Apple Music is now more usable and easy to navigate. Photograph: Apple 
Apple Music has been described as difficult to use and unintuitive. For iOS 
10, Apple has taken a step in the right direction.

The music stored in the library is now a lot easier to get to, editing it is 
simple and viewing downloaded-only music is now just a single tap on Downloaded 
Music, not buried in a menu.

Users have more control over what does and doesn’t get added to their music 
library when adding playlists and what gets synced and downloaded between 
devices. There’s also lyrics now for a bit of impromptu karaoke.

 Get me the hell out of here, Siri. Photograph: Apple 
Siri can now be plugged into almost any app. It’s open for developers to build 
in not only the talking aspects of Siri, but the machine intelligence behind 
it. Siri will be able to handle more and more tasks from different apps and 
services, which will be particularly useful for voice control of appliances 
under HomeKit – there’s a whole new Home app – or sending messages from 
third-party apps.

Siri is also now baked into the QuickType keyboard for more intelligent 
suggestions and contextual input, such as mentioning meetings in chat linked to 
the Calendar app.

iOS 10 will be available on 13 September for the iPhone 5 and newer, iPad 4 or 
iPad mini <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad-mini> 2 and newer and 
the sixth generation iPod touch.
