Donald Trump has dropped Chris Christie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chris-christie>, the governor of New 
Jersey, as the head of his White House transition team, replacing him with 
vice-president Mike Pence.

The president-elect also took the unprecedented step of naming three of his 
own children and his son-in-law to the executive committee overseeing the 
transition.

The shake-up comes with Christie facing calls for impeachment in New Jersey 
after the conviction of two former aides in the so-called“Bridgegate” scandal.

 He has denied any advanced knowledge of the politically motivated lane 
closures, which caused chaos on the world’s busiest bridge.

The demotion is another bitter disappointment for the governor, who was 
overlooked as Trump’s running mate in favour of Pence, a former congressman 
with Washington know-how and strong ties to conservatives.

Christie battled Trump in the Republican primary race but was among the first 
to endorse him 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/chris-christie-endorses-donald-trump-president>
 after dropping out. He had been running Trump’s transition planning for 
months, but the two reportedly grew apart in the last phase.

Christie was among those on stage for Trump’s acceptance speech at a New York 
hotel in theearly hours of Wednesday morning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-supporters-hilton-new-york>
 following his shock election victory. However, the celebrity businessman said 
only, “Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable,” before moving on.

In a statement on Friday, Trump said Indiana governor Pence would “build on 
the initial work” done by Christie. “Together, we will begin the urgent task of 
rebuilding this nation, specifically jobs, security and opportunity,” the 
president-elect said.

Rudy Giuliani has ‘no expectations’ of role in Trump government

In his first interview since the election, Trump said he will consider leaving 
in place some parts of the Affordable Care Act, including provisions allowing 
parents to keep older children on their insurance and prohibiting insurers from 
denying coverage for pre-existing condition. “I like those very much,” Trump
told the Wall Street Journal. 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-willing-to-keep-parts-of-health-law-1478895339>

He said a major reason for his change of tune – during the campaign he 
insisted that Obamacare would be scrapped – was his meeting on Thursday with 
the president, who suggested areas of his signature legislation to preserve. “I 
told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that,” 
Trump told the Journal. “Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and 
replaced.”
Trump said other urgent priorities for his administration would be 
deregulating financial institutions to allow “banks to lend again”, and 
securing the border against drugs and undocumented immigrants.
Facing street protests following a uniquely nasty election campaign, Trump 
called for harmony. “I want a country that loves each other. I want to stress 
that.” But when asked if his rhetoric had gone too far, he replied: “No. I won.”

Christie will still be involved in the transition, joining a group of Trump 
loyalists as vice-chairs: former House speaker Newt Gingrich, retired 
neurosurgeon and former candidate Ben Carson, retired Lieutenant-General 
Michael Flynn, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and Alabama senator 
Jeff Sessions.

Christie said: “I am proud to have run the pre-election phase of the 
transition team along with a thoroughly professional and dedicated team of 
people.


“As we now enter the post-election phase, I look forward to working with 
vice-president-elect Pence and the rest of the leadership team to implement 
that template as we prepare for January 20, 2017.”

In addition, Rick Dearborn, chief of staff to Sessions, will take over 
day-to-day running of the transition office, supplanting senior Christie aide

Three of Trump’s children – Don Jr, Eric and Ivanka – are on the transition 
executive committee, along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka’s husband. Kushner was
spotted at the White House

 on Thursday meeting with Barack Obama’s chief of staff, Denis McDonough.

The committee also includes controversial Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, 
former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin, Silicon Valley entrepreneurPeter 
Thiel

, Republican national committee chairperson Reince Priebus and Trump campaign 
chief executive Stephen Bannon, executive chairperson of the conservative 
website Breitbart News.

Pence said the transition staff is made up of the right people to “bring about 
fundamental change in Washington”. Christie’s hopes of landing the job of 
attorney general appear to be receding,potentially opening the way for Giuliani.

On Thursday, New Jersey <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/new-jersey> 
senate majority leader Loretta Weinberg called on assembly speaker Vincent 
Prieto to consider impeaching Christie, claiming there was “considerable 
testimony” during trial that he knew in advance about the lane-closing 
conspiracy on the George Washington bridge in September 2013. Christie 
spokesman Brian Murray dismissed the call as “ridiculous”.

The Trump’s transition team has launched a website 
<https://www.greatagain.gov/> that also conspicuously promotes the Trump brand,

 reflecting concerns over the blurring of his business and political interests.
