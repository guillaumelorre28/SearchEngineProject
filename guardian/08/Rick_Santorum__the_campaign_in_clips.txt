Rick Santorum <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rick-santorum> has 
suspended his run for president, but his words on the campaign trail will live 
on with us for all time – or until the videos are removed by the user from 
YouTube. Here now is a collection of some of the most dramatic peaks of 
Santorum's campaign rhetoric. What sticks in your mind from the Santorum 
campaign? Tweet us at @GuardianUS or leave your thoughts – and links – in the

"Ladies and gentlemen, America was a great country before 1965 [applause]." 
Then someone fainted. The whole speech is in the video above. The incident 
starts at the 8:40 mark.

Then there were the debates. Santorum caught flack for seeming to be 
dismissive of a soldier during a Republican debate when the soldier, a gay army 
member, asked a video question about the end of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. The 
question prompted Santorum to say that "any type of sexual activity has no 
place in the military". Challenged about the statement later, Santorum said 
that "sexual activity with people who happen to be the same sex is different" 
in a barracks context.

Santorum made a campaign stop at Bemidji Woolen Mills 
<http://www.bemidjiwoolenmills.com/> in Bemidji, Minnesota. One of that fine 
factory's products: the sweater vest, the article of clothing Santorum made 
famous. Factory machines at Bemidji drowned out everything Santorum said during 
his visit. But it was a moment he recalled fondly when it came time for him to 
end his campaign.

Obama, the 'snob'

The candidate who has home-schooled all seven of his children went after the 
president for supporting a college education for every student who wants one. 
"President Obama once said he wants everyone in America to go to college," 
Santorum said. "What a snob!" The Washington Post pointed out that Santorum, 
with a BA, an MBA and a JD, holds more advanced degrees than the president.

Mitt Romney as the 'Etch A Sketch' candidate

Santorum caught fire from Republican peers for seeming to equate GOP opponent 
Mitt Romney with reviled baddie PresidentBarack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama>. Now that Santorum has 
dropped out of the race, will he endorse Romney? On Tuesday, he promised that 
"we are not done fighting. … We are going to continue to fight for those 
Americans who stood up and gave us that air under our wings." What Santorum did 
not do was offer an endorsement of the presumptive Republican nominee. Here's 
what he said last month: "We might as well stay with what we have instead of 
taking a risk of what may be the Etch A Sketch candidate for the future."

Finally, Santorum attempted to defend his comparison of gay sex to bestiality. 
For those who missed it, Santorum said: "In every society, the definition of 
marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to 
pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or 
whatever the case may be." Here's the candidate adding to and defending that 
wisdom.
