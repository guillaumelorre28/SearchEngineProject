More than 350,000 walks were downloaded from the National Trust's website 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-visits-walks.htm> last 
year â€“ an increase of 40% on the previous 12 months.

For the second consecutive year, the Bath skyline walk, with its lovely views 
of the Georgian city, proved the most popular with 14,000 downloads.

In second place was Alderley Edge in Cheshire, which includes mature woodlands 
and ancient mines, followed by Flatford Mill in Suffolk, made famous by 
Constable's landscape paintings. Then came Ashridge in the Chilterns and 
Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire.

Jo Burgon, outdoor programme director at the National Trust, said: "We have 
seen a remarkable growth in the popularity of walking in the past couple of 
years. Our downloadable walks cater for a wide range of walkers with everything 
from short circular routes to the more challenging hill walks.

"We're finding that more people want to get out into the great outdoors but 
often need to be pointed in the right direction. You don't have to be an expert 
to go walking, you just need to enjoy getting outside."

The website features 240 walks in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. They 
range from a seven-mile coastal walk around the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall, 
the most southerly tip of mainland Britain, to an easy one-mile stroll around 
Lindisfarne Castle in Northumberland.

With more than 50,000 downloads, August was the most popular month for 
walking, with the Saturday of the bank holiday weekend the most popular day of 
the year.

The trust is aiming to have 1,000 downloadable trails by the spring of 2012. 
As well as walks, cycle routes, horse-riding routes and canoe trails will be 
included.

In October, the National Trust is organising its first walking festival.
