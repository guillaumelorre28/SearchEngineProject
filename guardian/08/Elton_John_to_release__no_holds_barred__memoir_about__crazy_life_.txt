The book, to be released in 2019, will be published by Henry Holt & Company, a 
Macmillan imprint, after an auction that involved two other major publishers. 
It will be written with music journalist Alexis Petridis.

“I’m not prone to being a nostalgic person,” John said in a statement. “I’m 
often accused of only looking forward to my next gig or creative project. It’s 
come as quite a surprise how cathartic I am finding the process of writing my 
memoirs. As I look back, I realize what a crazy life I have had the extreme 
privilege of living. I have grown up in a period of extraordinary change in our 
world – and have had the joyful honor of rubbing shoulders and working with so 
many of the people at the heart of these changes. My life has been one helluva 
rollercoaster ride and it’s still lumbering on. I hope readers will enjoy the 
ride too.”

It will be the first and only official autobiography of the 69-year-old 
Grammy-winning star, who released his 33rd studio album earlier this year. 
Throughout his career, he has sold more than 300m records.

“Elton John is an extraordinary pop culture figure whose celebrity transcends 
his music,” said Stephen Rubin, president and publisher at Henry Holt & 
Company. “Sure we know the lyrics to all his signature songs, but we love him 
just as much for his charity work, for his wide circle of friends, including 
royalty, for his supremely unforgettable outrageousness and sense of style and 
humor, and for his irresistible likability.”

A big-screen biopic, to star Tom Hardy as the singer, was announced in 2013

 but has yet to begin production.
