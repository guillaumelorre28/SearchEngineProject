Thursday morning brings the first real opportunity for most newspapers to 
properly reflect on America’s decision to electDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> as president – and they are 
split on what it means on their front pages.

Some, such as the Daily Mirror and France’s left-leaning Libération, are 
unequivocal in their message: the news is disastrous for America and Trump is 
ill-suited to high office.

Others, such as the Guardian, the Financial Times and the Independent (which 
only produces an online-only front page), take a slightly more neutral stance. 
Each chooses to focus more on the challenges Trump faces to reassure the world 
about his presidency and unite his country.

Like them, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph focus on the magnitude of 
the victory. They also shine a light on the rise of Trump’s supporters, whom 
the former characterises as “white working class”. Some commentators, on the 
other hand, say their analysis suggests a fair proportion of Trump’s support 
came from America’s wealthy.

The Sun focuses on the prescience of the Simpsons. In an episode from about 16 
years ago,Lisa Simpson took over the presidency from Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/17/simpsons-president-trump-prediction-was-meant-as-warning-to-us>
. Though, the image the paper uses is actually from a 2015 episode mocking the 
president-elect’s announcement that he would run. Like the Mail, the paper 
claims to offer “unrivalled coverage”.

In Australia, the best read papers are taking relatively neutral stances on 
their front pages. While some seem to lean slightly towards supporting Trump’s 
presidency, all of them seem most struck by the significance of America’s 
decision to elect him.
