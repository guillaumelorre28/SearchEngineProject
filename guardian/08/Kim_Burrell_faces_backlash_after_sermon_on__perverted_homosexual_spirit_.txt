Gospel singer Kim Burrell has faced criticism from the entertainment industry 
after video footage surfaced in which she gives a “homophobic” sermon.

The singer, whose vocals appeared on Frank Ocean’s song Godspeed, is shown in 
a video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZXu_DRQd1s> giving a sermon that 
refers to “the perverted homosexual spirit”.

“That perverted homosexual spirit is a spirit of delusion and confusion and 
has deceived many men and women, and it has caused a strain on the body of 
Christ,” Burrell, a pastor at Love and Liberty Fellowship Church in Houston, 
Texas, said in the video which surfaced online on 30 December. It is unclear 
when the footage was filmed.

The singer, who was due to sing with Pharrell Williams and Janelle Monáe on 
the Ellen DeGeneres Show this week, has now been dropped. “For those asking, 
Kim Burrell will not be appearing on my show,” reada tweet

 from the presenter on Tuesday.

Following the circulation online of the video of the sermon, Frank Ocean’s 
mother, Katonya Breaux,tweeted <https://twitter.com/katonya>: “Son, can we crop 
Kim Burrell’s voice out of your song?”

Pharrell, meanwhile, posted on Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/Pharrell/status/815268588340867073>: “I condemn hate 
speech of any kind”, although he did not refer to Burrell.Monáe reposted 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BOtFCavgE7B/?taken-by=janellemonae&hl=en> his 
message, also stating: “I unequivocally repudiate any and all hateful comments 
against the LGBTQ community. Actually I’m tired of that label. We all belong to 
the same community, a shared community called humanity.”

Burrell, who has collaborated with artists such as Missy Elliott, R Kelly, 
Stevie Wonder and George Clinton, has since responded to the leaked footage on a
Facebook Live broadcast

, claiming that the “enemy” had posted only a select extract of the original 
speech. “I love you and God loves you but God hates the sin in you and me,” she 
said.

“I never said all gays were going to hell. I never said LGBT … I said ‘sin’,” 
she added. “I make no excuses or apologies. My love is as pure as it comes.”
