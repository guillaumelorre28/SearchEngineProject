“This is what America is, my friends,” Clinton says. “We have a woman who is 
an inspiration to so many others - I thank Beyonce for standing up and showing 
the world we are strongest when we look out for each other, and I thank Jay for 
addressing in his music some of the biggest challenges in this country.”

Hillary Clinton takes the stage in Cleveland

She is introduced by Jay Z, and stands between them on stage, holding hands 
with Beyonce. “Thank you,” she says, her voice hoarse. “Hello Cleveland. What 
an incredible show.”

Beyonce performs "Who run the world" and closes with Clinton's quote about how

<https://t.co/LYPtRf7KRS>
 <https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/794724566455164929> November 5, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/794724566455164929> 
That comment has some history. NPR reports: 

Every presidential election cycle since 1992, the magazine has published a 
cookie recipe from the candidates’ wives. The latest recipes were released 
Thursday morning, of course with a twist this year: SinceHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is the first female 
nominee of a major party, it was her husband, Bill, who was asked to furnish a 
cookie recipe, along with Melania Trump.

The Clintons don’t exactly win points for creativity this year. The campaign 
submitted the “Clinton Family’s Chocolate Chip Cookies” — a reprise of Hillary 
Clinton’s earlier oatmeal chocolate chip submissions. And Melania Trump’s 
submission: “Melania Trump’s Star Cookies.”Family Circle readers will vote on 
the recipes 
<http://www.familycircle.com/recipes/desserts/cookies/family-circle-2016-presidential-cookie-poll/>
 in a poll on the magazine’s website.

But this isn’t so much a story about cookies as it is a story about Hillary 
Clinton. Back in 1992, Hillary Clinton was something of an oddity, a political 
spouse with her own high-powered career, who hadn’t set it aside to stand by 
her husband when Bill Clinton became governor of Arkansas. Her career became an 
issue in the Democratic primary. There were questions about whether then-Gov. 
Bill Clinton had funneled state business into her law firm.

When asked about her career in a press gaggle, Clinton responded 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EGranwN_uk>, “You know, I suppose I could 
have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was 
to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life. 
And I tried very, very hard to be as careful as possible, and that’s all that I 
can tell you.”

“There was a time a woman’s opinion did not matter,” Beyonce says. “Less than 
100 years ago women did not have the right to vote. Look how far we’ve come 
from having no vote to being on the brink of making history by electing the 
first woman president.”

“I’m with her,” she concludes.

 Documents obtained by The Associated Press from 20 years ago show that 
Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 
before she had legal permission to work in the country,the Associated Press 
reports.

The documents provide the most detailed accounting yet of Mrs. Trump’s first 
months in the U.S. She has said she followed all immigration laws as she moved 
from Slovenia to New York in August 1996 and obtained a work visa about seven 
weeks later.

The documents show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 
and Oct. 15, before she would have been legally allowed to be paid.

It is highly unlikely that the discovery will affect the citizenship status of 
Mrs. Trump. She has been a citizen since July 2006.

She currently lags behind Trump in the state, according to the RCP

 polling average, which puts Trump 2.7 points ahead at 46.7 percent to 
Clinton’s 44 percent.

Z/Beyonce/Big Sean/Chance concert, and now a LeBron rally.

While he was on stage, the Clinton campaign released an announcement that she 
would be returning to Cleveland to campaign - this time with LeBron James.

The campaign pointed to an op-ed last month 
<http://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-why-endorsing-hillary-clinton-for-president-2016-9>
, in which James wrote: “Hillary has always been a champion for children and 
their futures. For over 40 years, she’s been working to improve public schools, 
expand access to health care, support children’s hospitals, and so much more.”

GQ magazine 
<http://www.gq.com/story/melania-trump-speech-cyberbullying-trolls?mbid=social_twitter>

announced in a speech yesterday, to fight cyberbullying if she became First

Trump finishes speaking in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and leaves the stage to a

On the eve of the final friday before the presidential election, the 
candidates are focusing their attention on key swing states.

 * Clinton held a get-out-the-vote rally in Cleveland, Ohio, alongside 
Beyonce, Jay Z, and Chance the Rapper 
 * Trump spoke to a packed crowd in a hockey arena in Hershey, Pennsylvania 
 * At his rally, he said that Obama had screamed at a protester, when in fact 
Obama had told his crowd not to boo the manat a rally in North Carolina 
 * The Wall Street Journal revealed 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380>
 that the National Enquirer paid $150,000 for a story about an affair between 
Trump and a Playboy model just to kill the story to protect his campaign 
 * The Associated Press revealed that Melania Trump worked illegally as a model
 in the US before obtaining her work visa 
 * Earlier, a judge in Ohio issued a temporary restraining order against 
members of the Trump campaign to prevent them from intimidating voters at 
polling-places 
 * Earlier, Trump campaigned in Wilmington, Ohio and Clinton in Detroit, 
Michigan  
“Let’s send an unmistakeable message that love. Trumps. Hate,” Clinton 
finishes.
 
“This is what America is, my friends,” Clinton says. “We have a woman who is 
an inspiration to so many others - I thank Beyonce for standing up and showing 
the world we are strongest when we look out for each other, and I thank Jay for 
addressing in his music some of the biggest challenges in this country.”

That comment has some history. NPR reports: 

Every presidential election cycle since 1992, the magazine has published a 
cookie recipe from the candidates’ wives. The latest recipes were released 
Thursday morning, of course with a twist this year: SinceHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is the first female 
nominee of a major party, it was her husband, Bill, who was asked to furnish a 
cookie recipe, along with Melania Trump.

The Clintons don’t exactly win points for creativity this year. The campaign 
submitted the “Clinton Family’s Chocolate Chip Cookies” — a reprise of Hillary 
Clinton’s earlier oatmeal chocolate chip submissions. And Melania Trump’s 
submission: “Melania Trump’s Star Cookies.”Family Circle readers will vote on 
the recipes 
<http://www.familycircle.com/recipes/desserts/cookies/family-circle-2016-presidential-cookie-poll/>
 in a poll on the magazine’s website.

But this isn’t so much a story about cookies as it is a story about Hillary 
Clinton. Back in 1992, Hillary Clinton was something of an oddity, a political 
spouse with her own high-powered career, who hadn’t set it aside to stand by 
her husband when Bill Clinton became governor of Arkansas. Her career became an 
issue in the Democratic primary. There were questions about whether then-Gov. 
Bill Clinton had funneled state business into her law firm.

When asked about her career in a press gaggle, Clinton responded 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EGranwN_uk>, “You know, I suppose I could 
have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was 
to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life. 
And I tried very, very hard to be as careful as possible, and that’s all that I 
can tell you.”

“There was a time a woman’s opinion did not matter,” Beyonce says. “Less than 
100 years ago women did not have the right to vote. Look how far we’ve come 
from having no vote to being on the brink of making history by electing the 
first woman president.”

“I’m with her,” she concludes.
 
Beyonce takes the stage in Cleveland wearing an enormous hat. “This is 
history,” she says. “Thank you so much for being here tonight.”
 
 Documents obtained by The Associated Press from 20 years ago show that 
Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 
before she had legal permission to work in the country,the Associated Press 
reports.

The documents provide the most detailed accounting yet of Mrs. Trump’s first 
months in the U.S. She has said she followed all immigration laws as she moved 
from Slovenia to New York in August 1996 and obtained a work visa about seven 
weeks later.

The documents show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 
and Oct. 15, before she would have been legally allowed to be paid.

It is highly unlikely that the discovery will affect the citizenship status of 
Mrs. Trump. She has been a citizen since July 2006.
 
The Guardian’s Sabrina Siddiqui is on the scene in Cleveland.

A rapturous crowd packed into the Wolfstein Center for a star studded get out

The cheers of thousands of jubilant fans reverberated around the stadium as 
Jay-Z performed hits such as “Dirt off my Shoulder” and “Run This Town,” joined 
later onstage by Big Sean.

Chance the Rapper followed the act, declaring he was there “to celebrate our 
next and first woman president in the history of the United States of America.”

Beyoncé was expected to perform soon and was photographed along with her 
husband andHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>

 polling average, which puts Trump 2.7 points ahead at 46.7 percent to

While he was on stage, the Clinton campaign released an announcement that she 
would be returning to Cleveland to campaign - this time with LeBron James.

The campaign pointed to an op-ed last month 
<http://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-why-endorsing-hillary-clinton-for-president-2016-9>
, in which James wrote: “Hillary has always been a champion for children and

expand access to health care, support children’s hospitals, and so much more.”

GQ magazine

 asked a bunch of pro-Trump trolls what they thought about Melania’s idea, 
announced in a speech yesterday, to fight cyberbullying if she became First 
Lady.

A representative response:

Once all the cucks flee back to whatever hole they crawled out from there’ll 
be nothing to cyber bully about.”
