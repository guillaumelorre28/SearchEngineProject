Rogue soldiers allowed Ivory Coast’s defence minister and dozens of others to 
leave a house where they had been trapped on Saturday when some mutineers 
appeared to reject aspects of a deal intended to end a two-day revolt.

It remained unclear, however, whether the disgruntled soldiers – most of them 
former rebel fighters now integrated into the army – would honour the agreement 
announced by the president, Alassane Ouattara, just hours earlier.

The mutiny began early on Friday when the soldiers seized Bouaké, Ivory 
Coast’s second-largest city. Over the next two days, soldiers at military camps 
in cities and towns across the country, including the commercial capital, 
Abidjan, joined the mutiny.

Following talks between a government delegation headed by the defence 
minister, Alain-Richard Donwahi, and representatives of the mutineers, Ouattara 
announced he had agreed to some of the soldiers’ grievances, but chastised them 
for sparking the unrest.

“I would like to say that this manner of making demands is not appropriate. It 
tarnishes the image of our country after all our efforts to revive the 
economy,” he said in a declaration that was broadcast on state-owned television.

A mutineer close to the negotiations said the soldiers were satisfied with the 
deal, which would address demands for bonus payments and improve living 
conditions, and said they were preparing to return to barracks.

But some of the renegade troops later opened fire outside the house in Bouake 
where the talks had taken place, trapping Donwahi, local officials, journalists 
and the mutineers’ own negotiators inside. They were only allowed to leave 
several hours later.

“We are all out. The soldiers stepped aside and allowed us out. The minister 
took off from the airport,” said a Reuters reporter who had also been trapped 
inside the house.

A defence ministry statement later denied Donwahi had been held by the 
soldiers.

“The minister was in no way threatened by his soldiers but rather continued to 
carry out the talks,” the statement read.

Ivory Coast <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ivory-coast> – French-speaking 
West Africa’s largest economy and the world’s leading cocoa producer – has 
emerged from a 2002-2011 political crisis as one of the continent’s rising 
economic stars.

But years of conflict and a failure to reform its army, thrown together from a 
patchwork of former rebel fighters and government soldiers, have left it with 
an unruly force hobbled by internal divisions.

The revolt comes two years after hundreds of soldiers barricaded roads in 
cities across Ivory Coast demanding back pay in a near identical uprising. Then 
too the government agreed a deal that included amnesty from punishment and a 
financial settlement for the mutineers. The repeat of such a solution raises 
the risk they could be encouraged to do it again.

Ouattara came to power in 2011 after a post-election crisis that claimed more 
than 3,000 lives. The crisis was triggered by former president Laurent Gbagbo’s 
refusal to accept defeat and step down. It capped more than a decade of turmoil 
that began with the country’s first coup in 1999.

The new president faced enormous challenges in trying to create a unified 
army. Despite the government’s attempt at a quick resolution, the incident 
points to lingering problems with Ivory Coast’s recovery, said Cynthia Ohayon, 
WestAfrica <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> analyst for the 
International Crisis Group.

“This is another reminder that the long-standing issues that led to the crisis 
are still unresolved,” she said. “Some people forget and think that everything 
is going well in Ivory Coast. I think this should be toned down.”

Ivory Coast is no stranger to mutinies, having experienced about 10 since 
1990, according to Maggie Dwyer, an expert on mutinies in West Africa at the 
University of Edinburgh. Like Ohayon, Dwyer warned that the resolution 
announced Saturday might not hold.

“If your soldiers are coming to the streets for pay, there are probably deeper 
tensions within the military structure and those often go unaddressed,” she 
said.
