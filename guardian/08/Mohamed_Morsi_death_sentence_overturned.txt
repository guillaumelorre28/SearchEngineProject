 Tuesday’s ruling by the court of cassation means Morsi is no longer under 
threat of execution, although he is serving three long jail sentences. He was 
sentenced to 20 years in prison without parole on charges arising from the 
killing of protesters in December 2012; 40 years on charges of spying for 
Qatar; and a life sentence on charges of spying for the Palestinian Islamist 
group Hamas.

Sisi has tried to crush the Brotherhood, which he says is part of a terrorist 
network that poses an existential threat to the Arab and western worlds. The 
Brotherhood, Egypt’s oldest political movement, says its activities are 
entirely peaceful and denies using violent methods.
