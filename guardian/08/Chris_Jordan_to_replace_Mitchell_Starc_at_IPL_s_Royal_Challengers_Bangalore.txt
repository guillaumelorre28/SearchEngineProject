 in the final, will fly out on Saturday after Bangalore called him up as a 
replacement overseas player because Mitchell Starc has not recovered from a

However, the IPL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl> will still be running 
when England’s Test summer begins against Sri Lanka at Headingley in three 
weeks’ time.

Andrew Strauss, England’s director of cricket, said: “We are happy to support 
Chris in his decision to play for Royal Challengers Bangalore in IPL 2016. 
Participating in the tournament will be a good opportunity for him to further 
develop his white-ball skills and experience.”
