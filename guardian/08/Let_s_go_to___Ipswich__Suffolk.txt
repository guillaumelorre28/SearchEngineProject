Why Ipswich?
OK, so it isn’t the first place in Suffolk that springs to mind for a weekend 
away. Ipswich is somewhat overshadowed by prettier neighbours Aldeburgh, 
Southwold and Lowestoft, but this ancient town has some great modern 
attractions.

So what can I do?
Stroll around the redeveloped docks on the river Orwell. The waterfront is now 
home tothe university <http://www.ucs.ac.uk/home.aspx>, the Jerwood DanceHouse 
<http://www.danceeast.co.uk/the-dancehouse/>, a few bistros and cafes, and the 
town’s best hotel, the flamboyantly decoratedSalthouse Harbour 
<http://www.salthouseharbour.co.uk/> (doubles from £123 a night). Its 
restaurant is strong on seafood – try the scallops and the risotto. St Peter’s 
Street is good for shopping, with independent vintage, homeware and gift shops. 
The Ancient House is an incredible 15th-century building with pargeting and 
wood carving (though today it houses a branch of Lakeland). TheIpswich Museum 
<http://www.cimuseums.org.uk/Ipswich-Museum> (free) is in a leafy part of town 
and has a great natural history collection (including Wool.i.am, a huge replica 
woolly mammoth).Christchurch Mansion 
<http://www.cimuseums.org.uk/Christchurch-Mansion> (free) has a good collection 
of Constables and Gainsboroughs – both local lads – and is in a lovely park; 
look out for the colourful mandarin ducks.

Anywhere good to eat?
Students hang out at the Cult Cafe <http://cultcafe.co.uk/> on the docks, 
which serves gourmet fast food for about £6: posh hotdogs or poutines (cheesy 
chips) with pulled pork. TheBrewery Tap <http://thebrewerytap.org/index.php> is 
good for Sunday lunch.

And the best pubs?
The down-to-earth Dove Street Inn <http://www.dovestreetinn.co.uk/index.php> 
has a fantastic selection of real ales and runs regular beer festivals. The 
livelyThomas Wolsey 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Thomas-Wolsey/136857399694006?sk=timeline&ref=page_internal>
 is more central, in a building that dates from the 17th century.

Anywhere to stay for under £100 a night?
Holidaylettings.co.uk/ipswich has a few self-catering options, including an 
apartment sleeping two from £56 a night, or a cute cottage with roses over the 
door, from £51 per night for two.

Do I need a car?
No – there are hourly trains from Norwich, Cambridge and greater Suffolk, 
three trains an hour from London, and the town centre is tiny.
