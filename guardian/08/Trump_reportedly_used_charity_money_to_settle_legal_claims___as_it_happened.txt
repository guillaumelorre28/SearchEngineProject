Today in Campaign 2016

 * Donald Trump used $258,000 from his charitable foundation for legal 
settlements involving his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and a New York golf 
course, theWashington Post reported 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html>
 today. In 2007, Trump used his foundation’s money when his Palm Beach, 
Florida, club was fined $120,000 by the town for having a flagpole that was 
almost twice the height allowed under local rules. As part of a settlement, 
Trump donated $125,000 to veterans’ charities from the Trump Foundation, the 
paper reported. The foundation’s money comes mainly from other donors, not 
Trump himself. 
 * The Post reported that in 2010, a golfer sued when he was denied a $1m 
prize for a hole-in-one in a charity tournament at Trump’s course outside New 
York City. A $158,000 settlement also came from Trump’s foundation. Two weeks 
ago the Washington Post’s David Fahrentholdcast in doubt Trump’s philanthropy

 and raised questions about purchases he had made, apparently for himself, 
using money earmarked for charity. Now Fahrenthold hasuncovered what may be

, if there is no unforeseen explanation here (the Trump camp has yet to 
comment), the biggest abuse yet by Trump of tax laws and the trust of donors to 
his foundation. 
 * The charity scandal will likely come up at the upcoming presidential 
debate, just six days away. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will meet on Long 
Island for the first presidential debate with the topic of “securing America” 
firmly at the top of their agenda. Moderator and NBC anchorLester Holt has 
suggested this 
<http://www.debates.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=66&cntnt01origid=27&cntnt01detailtemplate=newspage&cntnt01returnid=80>
 and two other topics – “America’s direction” and “achieving prosperity” – 
could still be “subject to possible changes because of news developments”, but 
the reaction of both candidates to the violent events of recent days suggests 
next Monday’s night’s theme is already well chosen. 
 * Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin has linked Brexit and the 
rise of Trump,telling the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/evan-mcmullin-independent-presidential-candidate-trump>
 that such events are a “reflection of a nativist movement across Europe and in 
the United States” that is “destructive to [the] economy here and in the world 
and to peace and security”. The 40-year-old former CIA agent and Capitol Hill 
policy adviser accused Russia of fueling such sentiments – a phenomenon he said 
he understood because when working for the US intelligence service he “received 
the same training that Vladimir Putin did” while in the KGB. “They do it 
through supporting candidates like Donald Trump and Donald Trump poses a true 
threat to our national security by carrying Putin’s water in the United 
States,” he said.

 * Trump started another when he proclaimed at a North Carolina rally that 
“our African-American communities arein the worst shape 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-african-american-communities-north-carolina>
 they’ve ever been ... Ever. Ever. Ever.” The statement, which was immediately 
lambasted on social media for failing to consider the long history of slavery 
and racial discrimination against African Americans, marked the latest misstep 
by the Trump campaign as the Republican nominee has struggled to harness the 
terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey for his political advantage.

Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, defended Trump’s use of 
funds from the Donald J Trump Foundation to pay off his legal debts 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html>
, telling CNN’s Erin Burnett that the Trump family doesn’t take money as a 
salary from running the foundation and that the money was Trump’s to give away.

“You know, the Trump Foundation started with Mr. Trump’s money,” Conway said, 
neglecting to mention that Trump has not donated to his eponymous foundation 
since 2008. “The Trump Foundation has no permanent staff, no paid staff, no 
overhead, no one from the Trump family takes a penny in.”

Fending off several controversies on Tuesday, Donald Trump started another 
when he proclaimed at aNorth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina> rally that “our 
African-American communities are in the worst shape they’ve ever been ... Ever. 
Ever. Ever.”
 Donald Trump Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters 
The plainly inaccurate statement, which was immediately lambasted on social 
media for failing to consider the long history of slavery and racial 
discrimination against African Americans, marked the latest misstep by the 
Trump campaign as the Republican nominee has struggled to harness the terrorist 
attacks in New York and New Jersey for his political advantage.

A day after the apprehension of suspected bomber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/ahmad-khan-rahami-charged-bombings-new-york-new-jersey>
 Ahmad Khan Rahami, Trump made his remarks in Kenansville, North Carolina, and 
repeated familiar themes to crowds at multiple rallies across the swing state. 
“Immigration security is national security,” he said, and repeatedly read the 
lyrics of theThe Snake <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_ZBqpEUbik>, a 1960s 
soul song about a woman who finds a dying snake and nurses it back to health. 
The snake then fatally bites her. To Trump, this was a parable about the 
consequences of the United States taking in refugees.

The Republican nominee went on to describe Clinton as “the vessel for all the 
global special interests seeking to run our lives” and said that the “failed 
political establishment” had “vested” in her “all of their money, all of their 
hopes for another generation of corruption”. Trump also argued that the 
“dishonest media” had “bled this country dry”.

But, Trump ran into more controversy when the Washington Post reported that 
the billionaireconverted $258,000 in donations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/trump-foundation-settlements-golf-course-mar-a-lago>
 to the Donald Trump Foundation to settle lawsuits against himself. The 
payments represent an apparent violation of tax laws that couldpotentially even 
force 
<http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/296914-scrutiny-of-trump-foundation-deepens>
 the IRS to shut down the Trump Foundation. Trump further stoked controversy by 
bragging on Tuesday about spending “OPM – other people’s money”.

Hillary Clinton brings in more than $140m in August, has $68m in the bank

Former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton’s campaign has filedits September Federal Election Commission report 
<http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00575795/1100718/> for the month of 
August, revealing that the nominee raised more than $62m in August for her 
campaign, as well as roughly $78m for allied action funds for state Democratic 
parties, from more than 1.1 million contributions, with an average contribution 
of $50.

The campaign begins the month of September with more than $68m in the bank.

“The millions of Americans who have contributed to this campaign and to the 
Democratic Party have ensured that we head into the final 50 days of the 
election with the most robust organizing effort in history, and the resources 
we need to mobilize the millions of voters we need to elect progressive 
candidates up and down the ballot,” campaign manager Robby Mook said in a 
statement.

“With voting already underway in some parts of the country, the race will 
continue to tighten and we will need to fight for every vote and do everything 
we can to make sure our message cuts through and that Democrats turn out to 
vote.”

More than 60% of the campaign’s August contributions were from women, and 
roughly $17m were raised from contributions lower than $200.

The Clinton campaign has raised more than $412m over the course of the 
campaign, and begins the month with more than $10m cash on hand than it began 
August.

Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright has released a message 
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/09/20/email-madeleine-albright-when-i-was-welcomed-refugee>
 sent to President barack Obama ahead of his remarks at a UN Refugee Summit 
regarding her own history as a refugee. Considering the recent political news 
involving debates over the acceptance of refugees from the Syrian civil war, 
it’s relevant reading:

 I came to the United States as a refugee when I was 11 years old. My father 
was a diplomat and a strong supporter of democracy in Czechoslovakia, so when 
the Communists took over, we were forced into exile as refugees. In November 
1948, we were welcomed to the United States of America.

Becoming a US citizen is the most important thing that ever happened to me. My 
father said that when we were in Europe during WWII people would say, ‘We are 
sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need; by the way, 
when will you be leaving to go back home?’

But in America, people said: ‘We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you 
have everything you need; by the way, when will you become a citizen?’

America resettles more refugees than any other nation because it reflects one 
of our noblest traditions as a nation: providing support to those who are most 
vulnerable.

With the world facing the largest mass displacement on record since World War 
II, it has never been more important for world leaders to follow America’s 
example and work together to do more to support refugees....

When countries with insufficient resources take in refugees, it creates more 
instability, not just at the frontlines of this crisis, but around the world. 
If we were to slam the door in the faces of refugees with certain religious 
backgrounds, we would defy our history and our principles of pluralism and 
diversity. As we talk to other nations about what more needs to be done to 
tackle this crisis, it’s important that President Obama is setting this example.

When I came here as a child, I will never forget sailing into New York Harbor 
for the first time and beholding the Statute of Liberty. I did not have to face 
refugee camps or the kind of danger that many refugees endure. But like all 
refugees, I shared a hope to live a safe life with dignity and a chance to give 
back to my new country.

Together, we can help refugees rebuild their lives and live with dignity once 
again.

Fox News talking head Sean Hannity’s outspoken and material support for 
Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has reached another milestone 
today, with the release of an eight-minute promotional video for the nominee in 
which Hannity makes an appearance.

Hannity, whose eponymous program has long been a favorite slot for Trump to 
answer softball questions and for the duo tosoak up each others’ awesomeness 
<https://vine.co/v/OeF3QBlnwlV>, arrives about six minutes into 
#HEARTLAND4TRUMP, a promotional video studded with testimonials about the 
Republican nominee:

One of the reasons I’m supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, he’s 
going to put originalists on the supreme court - people that believe in 
fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers, co-equal branches of 
government.

He’s a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe.

And, of course, he’s gonna build that wall. He says he’s gonna have Mexico pay 
for it. That’s fine, as long as we secure the country and of course we don’t 
want people competing for jobs.

He said he will eliminate Obamacare, make us energy-independent.

And as somebody who’s been a marksman since I’m 11 years old, protecting our 
Second Amendment rights are paramount to me.

The endorsement lasts roughly 30 seconds.

Report: Former president George HW Bush told group he will vote for Clinton

On the heels of reports that former Republican president George HW Bush told 
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend – the former lieutenant governor of Maryland and 
daughter of Robert F Kennedy – that he plans to vote for Democratic 
presidential nominee Hillary Clinton,CNN is reporting 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/george-hw-bush-hillary-clinton/index.html>
 that the former president told board members of the bipartisan Points of Light 
Foundation that he will, indeed, vote for his former opponent’s spouse:

Bush told a room of roughly 40 people Monday that he would vote for Hillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> in November, 
according to sources close to Bush - an extraordinary rebuke of his own party’s 
nominee.

 Although the Bush family has neither confirmed nor denied the claims of 
either CNN or Townsend, a family spokesman was pretty coy about the former 
president’s plans on 8 November.


“The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will 
be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,” Bush spokesman Jim McGrath 
said in a statement. “He is not commenting on the presidential race in the 
interim.”

Trump campaign doubles down on Donald Trump Jr.'s Skittles tweet

The Donald Trump campaign has elected to lengthen the amount of time Americans 
spend talking about Skittle-related racial metaphors that were onceused by Nazi 
war criminals 
<https://theintercept.com/2016/09/20/nazi-who-originated-donald-trump-jr-s-skittles-metaphor-was-hanged-at-nuremberg/>
, releasing a statement this afternoon calling Donald Trump Jr. a “tremendous 
asset to the campaign.”

Don Jr. ignited a firestorm of criticism last night when he tweeted a meme 
<https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/778016283342307328> comparing Syrian 
refugees to poisoned Skittles, but as has become customary with the Trump 
campaign, the Republican nominee’s communications team has elected to double 
down on the statement.

“Don Jr. has been a tremendous asset to the campaign,” wrote communications 
advisor Jason Miller in a statement. “America has become less safe underHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Barack Obama, 
and Clinton’s planned 550% increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal 
that will put American lives at risk. Speaking the truth might upset those who 
would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a 
change, and only Donald Trump will do what’s needed to protect us.”

The same sentiment expressed by Trump was once used in a bid to keep Jewish 
refugees from entering the United Kingdom. In 1903, Conservative MP Major Sir 
William Eden Evans-Gordonused a very similar metaphor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/12/immigration-not-problem-hostility-migrants>
 in an address to Parliament:

Ten grains of arsenic in a thousand loaves would be unnoticeable and perfectly 
harmless but the same amount put into one loaf would kill the whole family that 
partook of it.

Donald Trump’s presidential campaign may have lifted the longstanding 
blacklisting of various media outlets ranging from the Washington Post to 
Buzzfeed News, but the press-loving/bashing candidate’s campaign is still 
breaking convention in how it treats the reporters assigned to cover the 
movements of the Republican nominee.

Case in point: a new ban on reporters traveling with Trump’s motorcade, a 
break in decades-old tradition that the campaign originally promised to 
maintain.

“We have communicated that this is an issue that the campaign should have 
spotted long ago and are vigorously protesting the decision,” Trump’s pool 
reporters told other members of the pool this morning in am email. “We have 
told the campaign that if they are truly committed to transparency, than [sic] 
they should place the pool on Trump’s plane so it is a truly protective pool. 
They have not been responsive to that request.”

The Trump campaign has resisted calls to include traveling press on his 
campaign plane, instead opting for a “chaser” plane that had led to delays for 
reporters traveling with the campaign from reaching his rallies, including an 
incident last week in which reporters missed a rally in New Hampshire entirely. 
(Trump mocked the candidates from the lectern for not being able to arrive in 
time.)

 * Donald Trump used $258,000 from his charitable foundation for legal 
settlements involving his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and a New York golf 
course, theWashington Post reported 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html>
 today. In 2007, Trump used his foundation’s money when his Palm Beach, 
Florida, club was fined $120,000 by the town for having a flagpole that was 
almost twice the height allowed under local rules. As part of a settlement, 
Trump donated $125,000 to veterans’ charities from the Trump Foundation, the 
paper reported. The foundation’s money comes mainly from other donors, not 
Trump himself. 
 * The Post reported that in 2010, a golfer sued when he was denied a $1m 
prize for a hole-in-one in a charity tournament at Trump’s course outside New 
York City. A $158,000 settlement also came from Trump’s foundation. Two weeks 
ago the Washington Post’s David Fahrentholdcast in doubt Trump’s philanthropy 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trump-retooled-his-charity-to-spend-other-peoples-money/2016/09/10/da8cce64-75df-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html>
 and raised questions about purchases he had made, apparently for himself, 
using money earmarked for charity. Now Fahrenthold hasuncovered what may be 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html>
, if there is no unforeseen explanation here (the Trump camp has yet to 
comment), the biggest abuse yet by Trump of tax laws and the trust of donors to 
his foundation. 
 * The charity scandal will likely come up at the upcoming presidential 
debate, just six days away. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will meet on Long 
Island for the first presidential debate with the topic of “securing America” 
firmly at the top of their agenda. Moderator and NBC anchorLester Holt has 
suggested this 
<http://www.debates.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=66&cntnt01origid=27&cntnt01detailtemplate=newspage&cntnt01returnid=80>
 and two other topics – “America’s direction” and “achieving prosperity” – 
could still be “subject to possible changes because of news developments”, but 
the reaction of both candidates to the violent events of recent days suggests 
next Monday’s night’s theme is already well chosen. 
 * Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin has linked Brexit and the 
rise of Trump,telling the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/evan-mcmullin-independent-presidential-candidate-trump>
 that such events are a “reflection of a nativist movement across Europe and in 
the United States” that is “destructive to [the] economy here and in the world 
and to peace and security”. The 40-year-old former CIA agent and Capitol Hill 
policy adviser accused Russia of fueling such sentiments – a phenomenon he said 
he understood because when working for the US intelligence service he “received 
the same training that Vladimir Putin did” while in the KGB. “They do it 
through supporting candidates like Donald Trump and Donald Trump poses a true 
threat to our national security by carrying Putin’s water in the United 
States,” he said.

 * Trump started another when he proclaimed at a North Carolina rally that 
“our African-American communities arein the worst shape 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-african-american-communities-north-carolina>
 they’ve ever been ... Ever. Ever. Ever.” The statement, which was immediately 
lambasted on social media for failing to consider the long history of slavery 
and racial discrimination against African Americans, marked the latest misstep 
by the Trump campaign as the Republican nominee has struggled to harness the 
terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey for his political advantage.  
Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, defended Trump’s use of 
funds from the Donald J Trump Foundation to pay off his legal debts 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html>
, telling CNN’s Erin Burnett that the Trump family doesn’t take money as a 
salary from running the foundation and that the money was Trump’s to give away.

“You know, the Trump Foundation started with Mr. Trump’s money,” Conway said, 
neglecting to mention that Trump has not donated to his eponymous foundation 
since 2008. “The Trump Foundation has no permanent staff, no paid staff, no 
overhead, no one from the Trump family takes a penny in.”
 
Donald Trump’s campaign manager has only the utmost respect for former 
president George HW Bush, whose age she mentioned casually while discussing his 
alleged plan to vote for Hillary Clinton:

Fending off several controversies on Tuesday, Donald Trump started another 
when he proclaimed at aNorth Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina> rally that “our 
African-American communities are in the worst shape they’ve ever been ... Ever. 
Ever. Ever.”

The plainly inaccurate statement, which was immediately lambasted on social 
media for failing to consider the long history of slavery and racial 
discrimination against African Americans, marked the latest misstep by the 
Trump campaign as the Republican nominee has struggled to harness the terrorist 
attacks in New York and New Jersey for his political advantage.

A day after the apprehension of suspected bomber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/ahmad-khan-rahami-charged-bombings-new-york-new-jersey>
 Ahmad Khan Rahami, Trump made his remarks in Kenansville, North Carolina, and 
repeated familiar themes to crowds at multiple rallies across the swing state. 
“Immigration security is national security,” he said, and repeatedly read the 
lyrics of theThe Snake <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_ZBqpEUbik>, a 1960s 
soul song about a woman who finds a dying snake and nurses it back to health. 
The snake then fatally bites her. To Trump, this was a parable about the 
consequences of the United States taking in refugees.

The Republican nominee went on to describe Clinton as “the vessel for all the 
global special interests seeking to run our lives” and said that the “failed 
political establishment” had “vested” in her “all of their money, all of their 
hopes for another generation of corruption”. Trump also argued that the 
“dishonest media” had “bled this country dry”.

But, Trump ran into more controversy when the Washington Post reported that 
the billionaireconverted $258,000 in donations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/trump-foundation-settlements-golf-course-mar-a-lago>
 to the Donald Trump Foundation to settle lawsuits against himself. The 
payments represent an apparent violation of tax laws that couldpotentially even 
force 
<http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/296914-scrutiny-of-trump-foundation-deepens>
 the IRS to shut down the Trump Foundation. Trump further stoked controversy by 
bragging on Tuesday about spending “OPM – other people’s money”.

Clinton’s campaign has filedits September Federal Election Commission report 
<http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00575795/1100718/> for the month of 
August, revealing that the nominee raised more than $62m in August for her 
campaign, as well as roughly $78m for allied action funds for state Democratic 
parties, from more than 1.1 million contributions, with an average contribution 
of $50.

The campaign begins the month of September with more than $68m in the bank.

“The millions of Americans who have contributed to this campaign and to the 
Democratic Party have ensured that we head into the final 50 days of the 
election with the most robust organizing effort in history, and the resources 
we need to mobilize the millions of voters we need to elect progressive 
candidates up and down the ballot,” campaign manager Robby Mook said in a 
statement.

“With voting already underway in some parts of the country, the race will 
continue to tighten and we will need to fight for every vote and do everything 
we can to make sure our message cuts through and that Democrats turn out to 
vote.”

More than 60% of the campaign’s August contributions were from women, and 
roughly $17m were raised from contributions lower than $200.

The Clinton campaign has raised more than $412m over the course of the 
campaign, and begins the month with more than $10m cash on hand than it began 
August.
 
Donald Trump’s latest comments maybe needs a fact-check:

Our African American communities are in the worse shape they’ve ever been. 
Ever. Ever. Ever.
 
Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright has released a message 
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/09/20/email-madeleine-albright-when-i-was-welcomed-refugee>
 sent to President barack Obama ahead of his remarks at a UN Refugee Summit 
regarding her own history as a refugee. Considering the recent political news 
involving debates over the acceptance of refugees from the Syrian civil war, 
it’s relevant reading:

 I came to the United States as a refugee when I was 11 years old. My father 
was a diplomat and a strong supporter of democracy in Czechoslovakia, so when 
the Communists took over, we were forced into exile as refugees. In November 
1948, we were welcomed to the United States of America.

Becoming a US citizen is the most important thing that ever happened to me. My 
father said that when we were in Europe during WWII people would say, ‘We are 
sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need; by the way, 
when will you be leaving to go back home?’

But in America, people said: ‘We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you 
have everything you need; by the way, when will you become a citizen?’

America resettles more refugees than any other nation because it reflects one 
of our noblest traditions as a nation: providing support to those who are most 
vulnerable.

With the world facing the largest mass displacement on record since World War 
II, it has never been more important for world leaders to follow America’s 
example and work together to do more to support refugees....

When countries with insufficient resources take in refugees, it creates more 
instability, not just at the frontlines of this crisis, but around the world. 
If we were to slam the door in the faces of refugees with certain religious 
backgrounds, we would defy our history and our principles of pluralism and 
diversity. As we talk to other nations about what more needs to be done to 
tackle this crisis, it’s important that President Obama is setting this example.

When I came here as a child, I will never forget sailing into New York Harbor 
for the first time and beholding the Statute of Liberty. I did not have to face 
refugee camps or the kind of danger that many refugees endure. But like all 
refugees, I shared a hope to live a safe life with dignity and a chance to give 
back to my new country.

Together, we can help refugees rebuild their lives and live with dignity once 
again.
 
Fox News talking head Sean Hannity’s outspoken and material support for 
Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has reached another milestone 
today, with the release of an eight-minute promotional video for the nominee in 
which Hannity makes an appearance.

Hannity, whose eponymous program has long been a favorite slot for Trump to 
answer softball questions and for the duo tosoak up each others’ awesomeness 
<https://vine.co/v/OeF3QBlnwlV>, arrives about six minutes into 
#HEARTLAND4TRUMP, a promotional video studded with testimonials about the 
Republican nominee:

One of the reasons I’m supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, he’s 
going to put originalists on the supreme court - people that believe in 
fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers, co-equal branches of 
government.

He’s a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe.

And, of course, he’s gonna build that wall. He says he’s gonna have Mexico pay 
for it. That’s fine, as long as we secure the country and of course we don’t 
want people competing for jobs.

He said he will eliminate Obamacare, make us energy-independent.

And as somebody who’s been a marksman since I’m 11 years old, protecting our 
Second Amendment rights are paramount to me.

The endorsement lasts roughly 30 seconds.
 
On the heels of reports that former Republican president George HW Bush told 
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend – the former lieutenant governor of Maryland and 
daughter of Robert F Kennedy – that he plans to vote for Democratic 
presidential nominee Hillary Clinton,CNN is reporting 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/george-hw-bush-hillary-clinton/index.html>
 that the former president told board members of the bipartisan Points of Light 
Foundation that he will, indeed, vote for his former opponent’s spouse:

Bush told a room of roughly 40 people Monday that he would vote for Hillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> in November, 
according to sources close to Bush - an extraordinary rebuke of his own party’s 
nominee.

 Although the Bush family has neither confirmed nor denied the claims of 
either CNN or Townsend, a family spokesman was pretty coy about the former 
president’s plans on 8 November.


“The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will 
be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,” Bush spokesman Jim McGrath 
said in a statement. “He is not commenting on the presidential race in the 
interim.”
 
The Donald Trump campaign has elected to lengthen the amount of time Americans 
spend talking about Skittle-related racial metaphors that were onceused by Nazi 
war criminals 
<https://theintercept.com/2016/09/20/nazi-who-originated-donald-trump-jr-s-skittles-metaphor-was-hanged-at-nuremberg/>
, releasing a statement this afternoon calling Donald Trump Jr. a “tremendous 
asset to the campaign.”

Don Jr. ignited a firestorm of criticism last night when he tweeted a meme 
<https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/778016283342307328> comparing Syrian 
refugees to poisoned Skittles, but as has become customary with the Trump 
campaign, the Republican nominee’s communications team has elected to double 
down on the statement.

“Don Jr. has been a tremendous asset to the campaign,” wrote communications 
advisor Jason Miller in a statement. “America has become less safe underHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Barack Obama, 
and Clinton’s planned 550% increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal 
that will put American lives at risk. Speaking the truth might upset those who 
would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a 
change, and only Donald Trump will do what’s needed to protect us.”

The same sentiment expressed by Trump was once used in a bid to keep Jewish 
refugees from entering the United Kingdom. In 1903, Conservative MP Major Sir 
William Eden Evans-Gordonused a very similar metaphor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/12/immigration-not-problem-hostility-migrants>
 in an address to Parliament:

Ten grains of arsenic in a thousand loaves would be unnoticeable and perfectly 
harmless but the same amount put into one loaf would kill the whole family that 
partook of it.

Donald Trump’s presidential campaign may have lifted the longstanding 
blacklisting of various media outlets ranging from the Washington Post to 
Buzzfeed News, but the press-loving/bashing candidate’s campaign is still 
breaking convention in how it treats the reporters assigned to cover the 
movements of the Republican nominee.

Case in point: a new ban on reporters traveling with Trump’s motorcade, a 
break in decades-old tradition that the campaign originally promised to 
maintain.

“We have communicated that this is an issue that the campaign should have 
spotted long ago and are vigorously protesting the decision,” Trump’s pool 
reporters told other members of the pool this morning in am email. “We have 
told the campaign that if they are truly committed to transparency, than [sic] 
they should place the pool on Trump’s plane so it is a truly protective pool. 
They have not been responsive to that request.”

The Trump campaign has resisted calls to include traveling press on his 
campaign plane, instead opting for a “chaser” plane that had led to delays for 
reporters traveling with the campaign from reaching his rallies, including an 
incident last week in which reporters missed a rally in New Hampshire entirely. 
(Trump mocked the candidates from the lectern for not being able to arrive in 
time.)
