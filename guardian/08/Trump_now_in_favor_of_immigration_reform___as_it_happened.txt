Today in Campaign 2016

 * In comments that run counter to his previous stance on the signature issue 
of his presidential campaign, Donald Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity that 
although undocumented immigrants living in the United States will get “no 
citizenship,” they will pay back taxes in exchange for possible legal status. 
 * “They’ll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes, there’s no amnesty, as 
such, there’s no amnesty, but we work with them,” Trump said, in remarks set to 
air tonight on Hannity’s show. “Now, everybody agrees we get the bad ones out,” 
Trump said ofhis immigration policy 
<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform>, which heretofore 
has called for the construction of a 2,000-mile wall along the US southern 
border and a “deportation force” that would remove the estimated 11 million 
undocumented immigrants currently estimated to live in the country. “But when I 
go through and meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject,” he 
continued, “and they’ve said, ‘Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person 
who’s been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it’s so 
tough, Mr. Trump.’ I have it all the time! It’s a very, very hard thing.” 
 * The Clinton campaign issued a statement on the exploding cost of EpiPens, 
which are used to ward off potentially fatal allergic reactions. A two-dose 
package cost less than $60 nine years ago; the cost is now closer to $400, AP 
reported. The product – and the conduct of the drug company that sells it – 
came under focus after members of Congress began demanding answers from EpiPen 
maker Mylan about the cost rises. Clinton called the price spike “outrageous” 
in a statement. 
 * Louisiana Republicans are exploring the possibility of booting infamous 
white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke from the 
party, although their attempts will likely come too late to prevent him from 
running for the US senate seat he’s currently pursuing.

 * The director of Donald Trump’s Maryland and Northern Virginia campaigns has 
suggested that Hillary Clinton is severely ill and would not survive a year in 
office during a “Moms 4 Trump” event in Loudoun County, Virginia.John Jaggers, 
the Maryland and Northern Virginia state director for Trump’s campaign, 
continued the Republican campaign’s unfounded attack on Clinton’s health during 
a “Moms 4 Trump” rally in Loudoun County. 
 * “How many of you would wear a wool coat in August?” John Jaggers asked the 
a crowd of Trump supporters at Salamander Resort in Middleburg, Virginia,
according to the Loudoun Times-Mirror 
<http://www.loudountimes.com/news/article/trump_campaign_operative_suggests_clinton_will_die_during_first432>
. “The woman who seeks to be the first female president of the United States 
wears a wool coat at every single thing. Have you ever stopped to wonder why? 
It’s a big deal, folks.” 
 * Nigel Farage, the former head of the United Kingdom Independence Party and 
orchestrator of the Brexit vote that removed the UK from the European Union, 
spoke at Donald Trump’s rally in Jackson, Mississippi. Although Farage did not 
endorse Trump, he did echo the populist message of the Brexit vote to encourage 
supporters of Trump to vote to overthrow “modern global corporatism”. 
 * “I come to you from the United Kingdom with a message of hope and a message 
of optimism,” Farage said. That message: “If the ordinary decent people are 
prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in, we can overcome the 
big banks, we can overcome the multinationals! And we did it!” Facebook

Rick Wilson, on Donald Trump’s amnesty stance:

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> supporters, who 
flocked to him in droves for a hard line, punitive ‘deport them all’ promise 
must have whiplash. His new handler Kellyanne Conway has pushed him to the left 
of the Gang of Eight and his new amnesty plan is sure to cause heartache with 
his nervous fans.

The Clinton campaign has issued a statement regarding Donald Trump’s apparent 
“softening” of his stance on undocumented immigrants:

“Yesterday in Texas, Trump doubled down on his dangerous immigration policies 
and once again falsely painted Latinos as criminals,” said Lorella Praeli, 
national director of Latino vote. “Here’s a message for Trump: Latinos can see 
through your cynical ploys - no play of words can hide the fact that you’ve 
built your entire campaign on a dangerous agenda that seeks to demonize 
immigrants, deport 16 million people, build a giant concrete wall and send a 
deportation force into our communities.”

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mississippi>. Although Farage did not 
endorse Trump, he did echo the populist message of the Brexit vote to encourage 
supporters of Trump to vote to overthrow “modern global corporatism”.

“I come to you from the United Kingdom with a message of hope and a message of 
optimism,” Farage said. That message: “If the ordinary decent people are 
prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in, we can overcome the 
big banks, we can overcome the multinationals! And we did it!”

“What the Brexit campaign did is we reached those people who’d been let down 
by modern global corporatism,” Farrage continued. “We reached those people who 
have never voted in their lives but believed by going out and voting for 
Brexit, believed they could take control of their country.”

“We were visited by one Barack Obama and he talked down to us - he treated us 
as if we were nothing,” Farrage said. “Having criticized and condemned his 
behavior, I could not possibly tell you how you should vote in this election... 
but I will say this: if I was an American citizen, I wouldn’t vote forHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> if you paid me!”

“In fact, I wouldn’t vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me!” Farage said, to 
loud cheers.

“The parallels are there,” Farrage said. “I think that you have a fantastic 
opportunity to here with this campaign.”

“You can beat Washington!” Farrage said in conclusion. “And you’ll do it by 
doing what we did for Brexit in Britain.”

“If you want change in this country, you better get your walking boots - you 
better get out there campaigning, and remember: anything is possible if enough 
decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment!”

On the heels of news that Donald Trump now supports legal status 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news>
 for undocumented immigrants who pay back taxes and have not violated any laws 
while residing in the US, the Republican nominee will reportedly give a highly 
anticipated speech about immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, on 31 August.

First reported by the Arizona Republic 
<http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/08/24/trump-give-immigration-policy-speech-phoenix-aug-31/89261148/>
, the speech will likely expand upon Trump’s “softening” of his rhetoric on 
immigration, which until this week stipulated that the estimated 11 million 
undocumented immigrants living in the United States would be deported from the 
country by a “deportation force,” with opportunity for re-entry by those who 
meet certain ideological strictures.

In comments to Sean Hannity set to air tonight, however, Trump indicated that 
undocumented immigrants who pay back taxes would be allowed to attain a legal 
residency status, although Trump characterized the move as “no amnesty”.

 * In comments that run counter to his previous stance on the signature issue 
of his presidential campaign, Donald Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity that 
although undocumented immigrants living in the United States will get “no 
citizenship,” they will pay back taxes in exchange for possible legal status. 
 * “They’ll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes, there’s no amnesty, as 
such, there’s no amnesty, but we work with them,” Trump said, in remarks set to 
air tonight on Hannity’s show. “Now, everybody agrees we get the bad ones out,” 
Trump said ofhis immigration policy 
<https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform>, which heretofore 
has called for the construction of a 2,000-mile wall along the US southern 
border and a “deportation force” that would remove the estimated 11 million 
undocumented immigrants currently estimated to live in the country. “But when I 
go through and meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject,” he 
continued, “and they’ve said, ‘Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person 
who’s been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it’s so 
tough, Mr. Trump.’ I have it all the time! It’s a very, very hard thing.” 
 * The Clinton campaign issued a statement on the exploding cost of EpiPens, 
which are used to ward off potentially fatal allergic reactions. A two-dose 
package cost less than $60 nine years ago; the cost is now closer to $400, AP 
reported. The product – and the conduct of the drug company that sells it – 
came under focus after members of Congress began demanding answers from EpiPen 
maker Mylan about the cost rises. Clinton called the price spike “outrageous” 
in a statement. 
 * Louisiana Republicans are exploring the possibility of booting infamous 
white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke from the 
party, although their attempts will likely come too late to prevent him from 
running for the US senate seat he’s currently pursuing.

 * The director of Donald Trump’s Maryland and Northern Virginia campaigns has 
suggested that Hillary Clinton is severely ill and would not survive a year in 
office during a “Moms 4 Trump” event in Loudoun County, Virginia.John Jaggers, 
the Maryland and Northern Virginia state director for Trump’s campaign, 
continued the Republican campaign’s unfounded attack on Clinton’s health during 
a “Moms 4 Trump” rally in Loudoun County. 
 * “How many of you would wear a wool coat in August?” John Jaggers asked the 
a crowd of Trump supporters at Salamander Resort in Middleburg, Virginia,
according to the Loudoun Times-Mirror 
<http://www.loudountimes.com/news/article/trump_campaign_operative_suggests_clinton_will_die_during_first432>
. “The woman who seeks to be the first female president of the United States 
wears a wool coat at every single thing. Have you ever stopped to wonder why? 
It’s a big deal, folks.” 
 * Nigel Farage, the former head of the United Kingdom Independence Party and 
orchestrator of the Brexit vote that removed the UK from the European Union, 
spoke at Donald Trump’s rally in Jackson, Mississippi. Although Farage did not 
endorse Trump, he did echo the populist message of the Brexit vote to encourage 
supporters of Trump to vote to overthrow “modern global corporatism”. 
 * “I come to you from the United Kingdom with a message of hope and a message 
of optimism,” Farage said. That message: “If the ordinary decent people are 
prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in, we can overcome the 
big banks, we can overcome the multinationals! And we did it!”   
Rick Wilson, on Donald Trump’s amnesty stance:

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> supporters, who 
flocked to him in droves for a hard line, punitive ‘deport them all’ promise 
must have whiplash. His new handler Kellyanne Conway has pushed him to the left 
of the Gang of Eight and his new amnesty plan is sure to cause heartache with 
his nervous fans.
 
The Clinton campaign has issued a statement regarding Donald Trump’s apparent 
“softening” of his stance on undocumented immigrants:

“Yesterday in Texas, Trump doubled down on his dangerous immigration policies 
and once again falsely painted Latinos as criminals,” said Lorella Praeli, 
national director of Latino vote. “Here’s a message for Trump: Latinos can see 
through your cynical ploys - no play of words can hide the fact that you’ve 
built your entire campaign on a dangerous agenda that seeks to demonize 
immigrants, deport 16 million people, build a giant concrete wall and send a 
deportation force into our communities.”
 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is a 
bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a 
better future.

prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in, we can overcome the 
big banks, we can overcome the multinationals! And we did it!”

“What the Brexit campaign did is we reached those people who’d been let down 
by modern global corporatism,” Farrage continued. “We reached those people who 
have never voted in their lives but believed by going out and voting for 
Brexit, believed they could take control of their country.”

“We were visited by one Barack Obama and he talked down to us - he treated us 
as if we were nothing,” Farrage said. “Having criticized and condemned his 
behavior, I could not possibly tell you how you should vote in this election... 
but I will say this: if I was an American citizen, I wouldn’t vote forHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> if you paid me!”

“In fact, I wouldn’t vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me!” Farage said, to 
loud cheers.

“The parallels are there,” Farrage said. “I think that you have a fantastic 
opportunity to here with this campaign.”

“You can beat Washington!” Farrage said in conclusion. “And you’ll do it by 
doing what we did for Brexit in Britain.”

“If you want change in this country, you better get your walking boots - you 
better get out there campaigning, and remember: anything is possible if enough 
decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment!”

This is basically Jeb's position. Guess Trump is the biggest cuck of them all.

Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. 
He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.

On the heels of news that Donald Trump now supports legal status 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news>
 for undocumented immigrants who pay back taxes and have not violated any laws 
while residing in the US, the Republican nominee will reportedly give a highly 
anticipated speech about immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, on 31 August.

First reported by the Arizona Republic 
<http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/08/24/trump-give-immigration-policy-speech-phoenix-aug-31/89261148/>
, the speech will likely expand upon Trump’s “softening” of his rhetoric on 
immigration, which until this week stipulated that the estimated 11 million 
undocumented immigrants living in the United States would be deported from the 
country by a “deportation force,” with opportunity for re-entry by those who 
meet certain ideological strictures.

In comments to Sean Hannity set to air tonight, however, Trump indicated that 
undocumented immigrants who pay back taxes would be allowed to attain a legal 
residency status, although Trump characterized the move as “no amnesty”.
