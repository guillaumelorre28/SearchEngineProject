Like all tomato days we had spaghetti that night. Made by our own hands. A 
tradition that we’ll never let go. A tradition that I will probably never let 
go of either, simply because like religion, culture is nailed into you so deep 
you can’t escape it. No matter how far you run.

I spent most of my teenage years longing to be older. When I was at school, 
all I wanted was to fast forward a year or two, to the time when I was sure 
that the school bullies would calm down, and I would find the group of friends 
I wanted to spend all my time with. I looked up to those older than me – my 
cousins, family friends who were already at university, and those confident and 
assured girls in the years above me. Life looked so easy for them. They seemed 
to breeze through life, with casually loosened ties, school bags from which 
they would extract eyeliner and lip gloss as soon as the bell rang, and got all 
the best parts in the school musicals. I couldn’t wait to be one of them.

Of course, once I was, I discovered the reality. I did care less about the 
bullies, and found some brilliant girls I wanted to hang out with on weekends 
as well as at lunchtime. Alongside this, though, exam pressure increased, the 
uncertainty surrounding the post-school years began to loom large and the 
relationships (with each other and the boys we knew) became more complicated. 
But Looking for Alibrandi by Melina Marchetta, and the experiences of its 
central character, Josie, prepared me for all this.

It is one of my favourite books set in a school and 12 years after I left 
mine, I still think of it often. Now that September is here, with the 
back-to-school feeling it brings, the story of Josie Alibrandi’s eventful final 
year of school has been on my mind. As the last of our ripe summer tomatoes 
disappear from the shelves, I have been thinking particularly of the Alibrandi 
tomato day, and of the three generations of women who peel, squash and cook 
tomatoes together.

It’s my mum’s 60th birthday this week, and she’s hosting multiple dinner 
parties over the next month. If I were there, she, my granny, my sister and I 
would be working together in a similar way to the Alibrandi women. At 29, for 
the first time in my life, I’d give almost anything to be 17 again, just to be 
back in that kitchen with my family.

Spaghetti al pomodoro

Serves four

Ingredients 

1.5kg very ripe tomatoes - these need to be full of flavour and smell of summer
400g Tipo 00 flour 
4 large free range eggs - go for the best you can afford (I love Burford Browns
 <http://www.clarencecourt.co.uk/our-range/burford-browns/>) 
Salt and pepper 
Olive oil 
Optional (to add to sauce): garlic, basil, shallots, parmesan, a pinch of 
sugar - use your own taste here; there’s no wrong answer

Equipment

 Mixing bowl 
Small knife 
Heavy-bottomed pan 
Wooden spoon 
Sieve 
Rolling pin 
Fork 
Pasta machine (optional) 
Large saucepan 
Colander 
Tongs

1. Pull the tomatoes off their vines, cut out the core and make a cross with 
your knife in the top of each. Blanch in boiling water for one minute, then 
remove and place straight into iced water. The skins will now slip off easily.

2. Squash the tomatoes with your hands (take time over this bit and enjoy it), 
and place over a low to medium heat to bubble away for about an hour. Push the 
sauce through a sieve to remove the seeds and boil again for another 20 mins. 
You should have a thick, rich sauce. Pour into hot, sterilised bottles for 
storage.

3. To make the spaghetti, pour the flour into a mound on your bench. Make a 
well in the middle, crack the eggs in, and incorporate the flour into the eggs, 
swirling it around with a fork to mix it in. Once incorporated, knead the pasta 
dough for 10 minutes or so, until very smooth and silky. Wrap in cling film and 
store in the fridge for at least half an hour.

4. If you have a pasta machine, this next step will be relatively easy. Cut 
your dough into four even pieces and, working with one at a time, dust in 
flour, roll out with a rolling pin and then run through the pasta machine 
settings until very thin (start with the widest and run through this a couple 
of times to get started). If you have a spaghetti attachment, slice it using 
that and hang to dry while you shape the rest. If you don’t have a pasta 
machine, you’ll need to roll it out by hand. Work with small pieces and keep 
rolling until the pasta is just slightly thicker than a playing card. Dust with 
lots of flour, roll up to make cutting easier, and slice into strips by hand.

5. Put on a big pot of generously salted water to boil. Put the tomato sauce 
in a pan (you’ll need to use one big enough to hold your cooked pasta) over a 
medium heat. Once the water is boiling, drop the pasta in and cook until al 
dente (still with a bit of bite). With fresh pasta this will take minutes only, 
so keep an eye on it.

6. Drain the pasta and tip into the warmed pasta sauce. Add some salt and 
pepper. Stir through and serve with fresh basil and a dribble of very good 
olive oil.
