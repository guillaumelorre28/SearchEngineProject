Locations for the installations set to illuminate central London next week in 
the capital’s first major light festival have been revealed. LumiereLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>, a free outdoor light festival taking 
place over four evenings from 14-17 January, will feature 30 installations from 
leading artists.

The works are set to appear around King’s Cross, Piccadilly, Westminster, 
Trafalgar Square and Mayfair, and will range from simple, fun pieces, such as 
neon signs and figures, to large-scale projections onto buildings. Among the 
major attractions will be the Garden of Light in Leicester Square; produced by 
French art collective Tilt, the giant illuminated flowers and trees will bring 
a “taste of the tropics” to the city in winter.

At Oxford Circus, a net sculpture called 1.8 London by artist Janet Echelman 
will be strung between buildings. The name is a reference to the earthquake and 
tsunami that struck Japan in 2011, which momentarily caused the earth’s 
rotation to speed up, shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds. Data from this 
event was used to create the sculpture and audiences will be able to interact 
with it, manipulating the light and patterns projected using a specially 
developed app.
