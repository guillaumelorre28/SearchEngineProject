Glasgow in winter … are you having a laugh?
No, but you could be at the Glasgow Comedy Festival 
<http://www.glasgowcomedyfestival.com/>, the largest in Europe (even bigger 
than that Fringe thingy in another Scottish city that will remain nameless). 
Now in its 13th year, it will feature more than 300 shows in 40 venues around 
the city.

Who’s headlining this year?
Stewart Lee, Dylan Moran, Jimmy Carr, Al Murray, Simon Amstell, Jerry 
Sadowitz, Nina Conti, Rich Hall, Frankie Boyle …

Enough giggling already, let’s get serious

And for active types? 
Hire a fixie and go for a spin at the state-of-the-art Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome 
<http://www.emiratesarena.co.uk/cycling/Pages/default.aspx> (£10.40 an hour) 
built for last year’s Commonwealth Games.

I’ll need a pint after that
Calling itself the UK’s “first experiential craft brewery”, Drygate 
<http://drygate.com/>, in the East End, has a 24-tap beer hall, restaurant, 
bottle shop, beer garden and gallery.

And for something a little stronger?
Whisky from the Glengoyne Distillery <http://www.glengoyne.com/>, at the foot 
of Dumgoyne Hill near Loch Lomond, enjoys the slowest rate of distillation in 
Scotland. This encourages the formation of esters, for a sweet, smooth taste. 
The distillery offers tasting sessions, blending sessions and a £55 Malt Master 
tour.

What’s cooking?
Beneath Glasgow Central station, Alston Bar & Beef 
<http://www.alstonglasgow.co.uk/> is a steakhouse and gin bar, serving a fine 
selection of both. Newly openedPorter & Rye <http://www.porterandrye.com/> on 
Argyle Street serves interesting small plates and Scottish dry-aged meats. 
Another newbie isOx & Finch <http://www.oxandfinch.com/> on Sauchiehall Street, 
for seasonal dishes such as tartare of roe deer and roast skate wing.

Do I need a car?
There are direct Virgin Trains to Glasgow from London, Birmingham and Crewe 
and many points in between … Oh, I see, so that’s why they’re sponsoring the 
comedy festival (and offering 20% off fares for its duration, subject to 
availability <http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/comedy-festival/>). Very clever.
