 * Donald Trump’s new presidential campaign chief is registered to vote in a 
key swing statein an empty house where he does not live 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump>
, in an apparent breach of election laws. Stephen Bannon, the chief executive 
of Trump’s election campaign, has an active voter registration at the house in 
Miami-Dade County, Florida, which is vacant and due to be demolished to make 
way for a new development.

 * ...or, at least, he was, until today. After the Guardian disclosed that he 
was previously registered at an empty house in Florida where he did not live, 
Bannonmoved his voter registration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-voter-registration-home-breitbart-writer>
 to the home of one his website’s writers. 
 * Bannon also faced domestic violence charges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-domestic-violence-trump-campaign-ceo>
 after a fight with a woman he was married to 20 years ago, in which she 
accused him of grabbing her by the neck “violently” and destroying a telephone 
when she tried to summon police. Documents from the Santa Monica, California, 
police department relating to the case were first published by Politico on 
Thursday. The case was eventually dismissed. 
 * A Maine state lawmaker has complied with Maine governor Paul LePage’s 
request that he, the lawmaker, make public a voicemail in which LePage calls 
him a “cocksucker” and a “little son-of-a-bitch socialist cocksucker.” The 
unpleasantness arose out of LePage’s belief that the lawmaker, Democratic 
Representative Drew Gattine, had called LePage a racist. Gattine denies that. 
“I want you to prove that I’m a racist,” LePage challenges Gattine in the 
voicemail, which you can listen to on the Portland Press Heraldweb site 
<http://www.pressherald.com/2016/08/26/prove-im-a-racist-lepage-challenges-westbrook-legislator-in-obscenity-laced-voice-mail/>
. “I’ve spent my life helping black people.” LePage, a Republican, gets on well 
with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, in a relationship the Boston 
Globe has described as a “bromance 
<https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/06/29/lepage-trump-bromance-blooms-bangor/JuNHYIddJqjPXZ1mDqA0LM/story.html>
.” LePage’s daughter is a state coordinator for the Trump campaign. 
 * Iraq war co-architect and former deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz 
has told Der Spiegel 
<http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/paul-wolfowitz-will-hillary-clinton-waehlen-a-1109602.html>
 that he will probably have to vote for Hillary Clinton. Wolfowitz told Spiegel 
that Trump represented a security risk and that his apparent affection for 
Russian president Vladimir Putin was “disturbing.” 
 * NJ.com reports 
<http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/08/giuliani_christie_urged_trump_to_soften_on_deporta.html#incart_river_mobile_index>
 that New Jersey governor Chris Christie is at least partially behind Donald 
Trump’s moderation this week on immigration. Trump indicated for the first time 
this week that he may be open to an immigration reform plan that includes a 
path to legal status for some undocumented migrants. 
 * The Trump campaign debuted its iPhone application this morning to 
relatively little fanfare - its release was accompanied by an email, but no 
tweets from the candidate himself - but privacy experts in the tech sphere are 
already casting a wary eye at the “America First” app as a potentially serious 
security risk for its users.According to ABC News 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Business/trump-campaign-apps-data-grab-expose-contact-list/story?id=41642049>
, anyone who downloads the app opens the gate for the campaign to access and 
collect unusually vast quantities of data, including their entire address book 
and contact lists. Facebook

Donald Trump's doctor: I wrote Trump's health letter in five minutes

Donald Trump’s gastroenterologist wrote the letter stating that Trump “will be 
the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” in a matter of 
minutes,according to an interview 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-doctor-wrote-health-letter-just-5-minutes-limo-waited-n638526>
 the doctor gave NBC’s Lester Holt.

Dr. Harold Bornstein told NBC that he stands by the assertion that Trump would 
be the healthiest man to ever hold the nation’s highest office, saying of the 
obvious hyperbole: “I like that sentence, to be quite honest with you.”

Bornstein’s one-page assessment of the septuagenarian’s health - in which he 
called Trump’s latest test results “extraordinarily excellent” - have drawn new 
scrutiny since the letter’s release in December as the candidate and his 
acolytes have pointed to conspiracy theories that rivalHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> suffers from any number 
of secret ailments, from epilepsy to fainting spells, as proof that she does 
not have the “stamina” to serve as president.

Bornstein said that the decidedly non-medical language he used in the letter 
was gleaned from Trump’s own vernacular: “I think I picked up his kind of 
language and then just interpreted it to my own.”

Bornstein’s credentials have been called into question, after CNN’s Sanjay 
Gupta pointed out that the professional gastroenterological association 
mentioned in the letter has not counted Bornstein as a member for decades. 
Additionally, Bornstein’s website redirects tosomething called Annoying Teddy 
<http://haroldbornsteinmd.com>, a teddy bear that sings for three hours at a 
time.

Speaking to a roundtable of Latino business leaders in Las Vegas, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> bragged - without apparently 
secret evidence - that his campaign is doing well with Latino voters:

“We’ve been doing very, very well with the Latinos, we’ve been doing amazing - 
far, far greater... than anyone understands,” Trump said. “And they want to see 
jobs coming in, we’re going to bring jobs. They want to see things happen, I 
don’t know if you just saw, the GDP was just reduced from last month to 1.1%, 
when they had it last month it was 1.2, everyone thought that was a 
catastrophe, well they just did an adjustment and brought it down.”

Jared Taylor was prominently featured in a Hillary Clinton campaign ad 
released ahead of herspeech denouncing the “alt-right” in Reno 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/hillary-clinton-alt-right-racism-speech-donald-trump-nevada>
 on Thursday and “appreciates” the Democratic presidential nominee for “calling 
attention to the message I have for America”.
 White nationalist writer, Jared Taylor, in his home. Photograph: The 
Washington Post/Getty Images 
The self-described “race realist” is unrepentant in embracing the label and 
expounding his views. He founded the alt-right American Renaissance website 25 
years ago, which started as a print monthly to emphasize race as society’s most 
“prominent and divisive” fault line, and that mainstream politics and media 
tries to “gloss over” the issue.

Clinton has attacked Trump’s associations with the alt-right, describing it as 
a “a fringe element that has taken over the Republican party”.

Taylor said her speech was “a typical lefty campaign ploy”, and maintained 
Trump is not a part of the movement. “IsHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> responsible for the views 
of everyone who supports her?” he asked.

Asked to define what the diffuse alt-right stands for, Taylor said there were 
“areas of disagreement”, but that “the central element of the alt-right is the 
position it takes on race.”


That position, until recently, would have been clearly beyond the pale of 
presidential politics, and rejected by liberals and mainstream conservatives 
alike. Now, Taylor sees an opportunity to further proselytise his views. He 
does not think Trump is solely responsible for the alleged growth of the 
alt-right. But, “it is encouraging because here we have a candidate for 
president who is saying some things that we have been saying for years”.

Statement from the Iowa chair of the Republican party on Hillary Clinton’s 
“alt-right” speech:

Hillary Clinton’s latest strategy of deflecting from her corrupt pay-to-play 
scheme at the State Department by leveling personal attacks againstDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is as desperate as it is 
predictable.

For decades, Hillary and other Democrats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> have taken minority support for 
granted while offering them embarrassingly little results. Donald Trump’s 
powerful message of hope, opportunity and empowerment for minority communities 
threatens to resonate with Hillary’s base, and that’s why she’s lashing out.

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> can add 
the endorsement of the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce to her pile 
of endorsements from LGBTQ-oriented organizations, with business association’s 
CEO declaring in a statement this afternoon that LGBTQ Americans have “come too 
far to lose [their] seat at the table”.

Gay Pride Parade. Photograph: Peter Foley/EPA 
“The National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce has never endorsed a candidate 
in its nearly fifteen year history, but the stakes have never been so high for 
the future of the LGBT business community,” said NGLCC co-founder and CEO 
Chance Mitchellin a statement 
<https://nglcc.org/NGLCC%20Endorses%20Hillary%20Clinton>. Calling Clinton “the 
progressive champion our businesses and our families need to thrive,” the head 
of the nation’s largest business organization for LGBTQ people wrote that the 
advocacy group is “certain that Secretary Clinton will be the president 
fighting for the collective economic and social longevity of America’s 1.4 
million LGBT business owners.”

In its endorsement, the Washington, DC-headquartered organization, which aims 
to expand economic opportunities for LGBTQ businesses and business owners, 
cited Clinton’s long (albeit checkered 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/15/hillary-clinton-gay-marriage-presidential-campaign>
) history of advocacy for LGBTQ communities, including her support for 
antidiscrimination legislation and reduction of red tape for small businesses.

“The NGLCC and our partners are proud to endorse a champion for equality and 
opportunity who will promote the Democratic Party’s most progressive platform 
yet,” added Mitchell. “Secretary Clinton proudly affirms an essential core 
value of the NGLCC: that we are all stronger together, and that our economy 
only succeeds when the American Dream is available to all LGBT and allied 
Americans.”

Clinton responded enthusiastically to the endorsement:

“I am honored to have earned the first-ever endorsement of the National Gay & 
Lesbian Chamber of Commerce,” Clinton said in a statement. “The stakes in this 
election could not be higher for LGBT Americans. WhenDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> says he’ll ‘make America 
great again,’ that’s code for ‘take America backwards.’ He has said he would 
appoint judges who would overturn marriage equality. The man Trump chose as his 
running mate signed a law that opened the door for Indiana businesses to 
discriminate against LGBT people and said marriage equality could cause 
‘societal collapse.’”

“As we’ve seen in North Carolina, discrimination isn’t only wrong – it’s bad 
for business. North Carolina’s egregious HB2 measure has caused companies to 
pull jobs and millions of dollars out of the state.”

Donald Trump iPhone app 'vacuums up' personal data from users

The Trump campaign debuted its iPhone application this morning to relatively 
little fanfare - its release was accompanied by an email, but no tweets from 
the candidate himself - but privacy experts in the tech sphere are already 
casting a wary eye at the “America First” app as a potentially serious security 
risk for its users.

According to ABC News 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Business/trump-campaign-apps-data-grab-expose-contact-list/story?id=41642049>
, anyone who downloads the app opens the gate for the campaign to access and 
collect unusually vast quantities of data, including their entire address book 
and contact lists.

The app’s privacy policy <https://www.donaldjtrump.com/pages/app-privacy> 
informs users that the campaign “may access, collect, and store personal 
information about other people that is available to us through your contact 
list and/or address book.”


That’s a long step further than Hillary Clinton’s analogous campaign 
application, which does not acquire any contact information beyond that of the 
user.

“Trump’s is asking to collect significantly more data, and not just data about 
you, but data about anyone who might be in your contact list,” technology and 
civil liberties policy director at the ACLU of Northern California Nicole Ozer 
told ABC News.

“You have the situation where an individual is wanting to use the app, and 
they’re making decisions about other people’s privacy,” Ozer said. “Just 
because you choose to use an app, doesn’t mean that all the people you come in 
contact with want information about them shared with that campaign or that 
company.”

Donald Trump’s campaign chief has moved his voter registration to the home of 
one his website’s writers, after the Guardiandisclosed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump>
 that he was previously registered at an empty house in Florida where he did 
not live.

Stephen Bannon is now registered to vote at the Florida house of Andy Badolato 
<http://www.breitbart.com/author/andy-badolato/>, who reports for Breitbart 
News and has worked with Bannon in the past on the production of political 
films.

According to public records, Badolato, 52, and two of his adult sons are also 
registered to vote at the property, which he co-owns with his ex-wife.

A spokeswoman for Bannon, a spokesman for Trump, and Badolato did not respond 
to emailed questions about whether Bannon lives at the single-family house, 
which is listed as his residence on his new voter registration record in 
Sarasota County.

Alexandra Preate, a spokeswoman for Bannon, said earlier in an email that “Mr 
Bannon moved to a different residence in Florida”, repeating a statement about 
the issue that was previously released by Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller.

The Sarasota County supervisor of elections advises new registrants that they 
must use the address of their legal residence, andnotes prominently that 
applying with untrue information 
<http://www.sarasotavotes.com/content.aspx?id=16> can result in a felony charge 
punishable by five years in prison or a fine of up to $5,000.

Bannon, the recently hired chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway>
, made the amendment to his registration after being contacted by the Guardian 
for areport published on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump>
 morning about his previous voting registration arrangements.

The 62-year-old executive chairman of Breitbart News was from 2014 until this 
week registered to vote at two rented houses in Miami where his ex-wife lived. 
The second house has been vacant for months, according to neighbors, and is due 
to be demolished. Bannon, who owns property in California, works predominantly 
in Washington and New York.

Bannon, his ex-wife Diane Clohesy and the Trump campaign have not disputed 
that Bannon did not live in the Miami houses with Clohesy when given eight 
separate opportunities to do so before and after publication.

Badolato states on his website <http://www.andybadolato.com/> that he is an 
“entrepreneur, senior level executive, venture capitalist and seed stage 
investor” and claims to have founded companies that reached a total of $26bn in 
market capitalization. According to federal court records, he has filed for 
bankruptcy four times since 2008.

He is also an “editorial journalist and blog contributor” at Breitbart News 
and formerly worked as an associate producer on some of Bannon’s films such as 
The Undefeated, a documentary about the 2008 Republican vice-presidential 
nominee Sarah Palin.

Christie persuaded Trump to moderate immigration stance – report

NJ.com reports 
<http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/08/giuliani_christie_urged_trump_to_soften_on_deporta.html#incart_river_mobile_index>
 that New Jersey governor Chris Christie is at least partially behind Donald 
Trump’s moderation this week on immigration.

Trump indicated for the first time this week that he may be open to an 
immigration reform plan that includes a path to legal status for some 
undocumented migrants.

Former New York City mayor and Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani told NJ.com how 
it played out, the sitereports 
<http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/08/giuliani_christie_urged_trump_to_soften_on_deporta.html#incart_river_mobile_index>
:

And, Giuliani says, even more Christie-inspired changes to Trump’s immigration 
stance will be forthcoming, like his call for tracking immigrant visas like
Fedex packages, 
<http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/09/fedex_visa_tracking_christie_called_for_already_in.html>
 and using theE-Verify <https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify> system to reduce 
illegal labor.

In an interview with NJ Advance Media on Thursday, Giuliani, a top adviser to 
the Republican presidential nominee, said Trump’s recentreversal on immigration 
policy 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/08/25/trump_live_polls_immigration_policy_with_hannity_town_hall_audience_who_wants_them_thrown_out.html>
 came after his inner circle for several weeks suggested a more nuanced, 
practical, and humane approach in dealing with the nation’s 11 million 
undocumented immigrants.

Asked if Christie was responsible for Trump’s softening approach to 
immigration, the former mayor responded: “The answer to that question is yes.”

 * Donald Trump’s new presidential campaign chief is registered to vote in a 
key swing statein an empty house where he does not live 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump>
, in an apparent breach of election laws. Stephen Bannon, the chief executive 
of Trump’s election campaign, has an active voter registration at the house in 
Miami-Dade County, Florida, which is vacant and due to be demolished to make 
way for a new development.

 * ...or, at least, he was, until today. After the Guardian disclosed that he 
was previously registered at an empty house in Florida where he did not live, 
Bannonmoved his voter registration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-voter-registration-home-breitbart-writer>
 to the home of one his website’s writers. 
 * Bannon also faced domestic violence charges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-domestic-violence-trump-campaign-ceo>
 after a fight with a woman he was married to 20 years ago, in which she 
accused him of grabbing her by the neck “violently” and destroying a telephone 
when she tried to summon police. Documents from the Santa Monica, California, 
police department relating to the case were first published by Politico on 
Thursday. The case was eventually dismissed. 
 * A Maine state lawmaker has complied with Maine governor Paul LePage’s 
request that he, the lawmaker, make public a voicemail in which LePage calls 
him a “cocksucker” and a “little son-of-a-bitch socialist cocksucker.” The 
unpleasantness arose out of LePage’s belief that the lawmaker, Democratic 
Representative Drew Gattine, had called LePage a racist. Gattine denies that. 
“I want you to prove that I’m a racist,” LePage challenges Gattine in the 
voicemail, which you can listen to on the Portland Press Heraldweb site 
<http://www.pressherald.com/2016/08/26/prove-im-a-racist-lepage-challenges-westbrook-legislator-in-obscenity-laced-voice-mail/>
. “I’ve spent my life helping black people.” LePage, a Republican, gets on well 
with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, in a relationship the Boston 
Globe has described as a “bromance 
<https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/06/29/lepage-trump-bromance-blooms-bangor/JuNHYIddJqjPXZ1mDqA0LM/story.html>
.” LePage’s daughter is a state coordinator for the Trump campaign. 
 * Iraq war co-architect and former deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz 
has told Der Spiegel 
<http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/paul-wolfowitz-will-hillary-clinton-waehlen-a-1109602.html>
 that he will probably have to vote for Hillary Clinton. Wolfowitz told Spiegel 
that Trump represented a security risk and that his apparent affection for 
Russian president Vladimir Putin was “disturbing.” 
 * NJ.com reports 
<http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/08/giuliani_christie_urged_trump_to_soften_on_deporta.html#incart_river_mobile_index>
 that New Jersey governor Chris Christie is at least partially behind Donald 
Trump’s moderation this week on immigration. Trump indicated for the first time 
this week that he may be open to an immigration reform plan that includes a 
path to legal status for some undocumented migrants. 
 * The Trump campaign debuted its iPhone application this morning to 
relatively little fanfare - its release was accompanied by an email, but no 
tweets from the candidate himself - but privacy experts in the tech sphere are 
already casting a wary eye at the “America First” app as a potentially serious 
security risk for its users.According to ABC News 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Business/trump-campaign-apps-data-grab-expose-contact-list/story?id=41642049>
, anyone who downloads the app opens the gate for the campaign to access and 
collect unusually vast quantities of data, including their entire address book 
and contact lists.  
Donald Trump’s gastroenterologist wrote the letter stating that Trump “will be 
the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” in a matter of 
minutes,according to an interview 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-doctor-wrote-health-letter-just-5-minutes-limo-waited-n638526>
 the doctor gave NBC’s Lester Holt.

Dr. Harold Bornstein told NBC that he stands by the assertion that Trump would 
be the healthiest man to ever hold the nation’s highest office, saying of the 
obvious hyperbole: “I like that sentence, to be quite honest with you.”

Bornstein’s one-page assessment of the septuagenarian’s health - in which he 
called Trump’s latest test results “extraordinarily excellent” - have drawn new 
scrutiny since the letter’s release in December as the candidate and his 
acolytes have pointed to conspiracy theories that rivalHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> suffers from any number 
of secret ailments, from epilepsy to fainting spells, as proof that she does 
not have the “stamina” to serve as president.

Bornstein said that the decidedly non-medical language he used in the letter 
was gleaned from Trump’s own vernacular: “I think I picked up his kind of 
language and then just interpreted it to my own.”

Bornstein’s credentials have been called into question, after CNN’s Sanjay 
Gupta pointed out that the professional gastroenterological association 
mentioned in the letter has not counted Bornstein as a member for decades. 
Additionally, Bornstein’s website redirects tosomething called Annoying Teddy 
<http://haroldbornsteinmd.com>, a teddy bear that sings for three hours at a 
time.
 
Speaking to a roundtable of Latino business leaders in Las Vegas, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> bragged - without apparently 
secret evidence - that his campaign is doing well with Latino voters:

“We’ve been doing very, very well with the Latinos, we’ve been doing amazing - 
far, far greater... than anyone understands,” Trump said. “And they want to see 
jobs coming in, we’re going to bring jobs. They want to see things happen, I 
don’t know if you just saw, the GDP was just reduced from last month to 1.1%, 
when they had it last month it was 1.2, everyone thought that was a 
catastrophe, well they just did an adjustment and brought it down.”
 
The “attack” in question: releasing a transcript 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/08/25/a-transcript-of-jill-steins-meeting-with-the-washington-post-editorial-board/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.edb96f1bc577>

“prominent and divisive” fault line, and that mainstream politics and media 
tries to “gloss over” the issue.

Clinton has attacked Trump’s associations with the alt-right, describing it as 
a “a fringe element that has taken over the Republican party”.

Taylor said her speech was “a typical lefty campaign ploy”, and maintained 
Trump is not a part of the movement. “IsHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> responsible for the views 
of everyone who supports her?” he asked.

Asked to define what the diffuse alt-right stands for, Taylor said there were 
“areas of disagreement”, but that “the central element of the alt-right is the 
position it takes on race.”


That position, until recently, would have been clearly beyond the pale of 
presidential politics, and rejected by liberals and mainstream conservatives 
alike. Now, Taylor sees an opportunity to further proselytise his views. He 
does not think Trump is solely responsible for the alleged growth of the 
alt-right. But, “it is encouraging because here we have a candidate for 
president who is saying some things that we have been saying for years”.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, for one, is 
still an avid reader of Breitbart News:

Meet the ‘Trumpocrats’: Lifelong Democrats Breaking w/ Party Over Hillary to 
Support Donald Trump for President:https://t.co/g2N3JJWV8a

Statement from the Iowa chair of the Republican party on Hillary Clinton’s 
“alt-right” speech:

Hillary Clinton’s latest strategy of deflecting from her corrupt pay-to-play 
scheme at the State Department by leveling personal attacks againstDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is as desperate as it is 
predictable.

For decades, Hillary and other Democrats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> have taken minority support for 
granted while offering them embarrassingly little results. Donald Trump’s 
powerful message of hope, opportunity and empowerment for minority communities 
threatens to resonate with Hillary’s base, and that’s why she’s lashing out.
 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> can add 
the endorsement of the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce to her pile 
of endorsements from LGBTQ-oriented organizations, with business association’s 
CEO declaring in a statement this afternoon that LGBTQ Americans have “come too 
far to lose [their] seat at the table”.

Gay Pride Parade. Photograph: Peter Foley/EPA 
“The National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce has never endorsed a candidate 
in its nearly fifteen year history, but the stakes have never been so high for 
the future of the LGBT business community,” said NGLCC co-founder and CEO 
Chance Mitchellin a statement 
<https://nglcc.org/NGLCC%20Endorses%20Hillary%20Clinton>. Calling Clinton “the 
progressive champion our businesses and our families need to thrive,” the head 
of the nation’s largest business organization for LGBTQ people wrote that the 
advocacy group is “certain that Secretary Clinton will be the president 
fighting for the collective economic and social longevity of America’s 1.4 
million LGBT business owners.”

In its endorsement, the Washington, DC-headquartered organization, which aims 
to expand economic opportunities for LGBTQ businesses and business owners, 
cited Clinton’s long (albeit checkered 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/15/hillary-clinton-gay-marriage-presidential-campaign>
) history of advocacy for LGBTQ communities, including her support for 
antidiscrimination legislation and reduction of red tape for small businesses.

“The NGLCC and our partners are proud to endorse a champion for equality and 
opportunity who will promote the Democratic Party’s most progressive platform 
yet,” added Mitchell. “Secretary Clinton proudly affirms an essential core 
value of the NGLCC: that we are all stronger together, and that our economy 
only succeeds when the American Dream is available to all LGBT and allied 
Americans.”

Clinton responded enthusiastically to the endorsement:

“I am honored to have earned the first-ever endorsement of the National Gay & 
Lesbian Chamber of Commerce,” Clinton said in a statement. “The stakes in this 
election could not be higher for LGBT Americans. WhenDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> says he’ll ‘make America 
great again,’ that’s code for ‘take America backwards.’ He has said he would 
appoint judges who would overturn marriage equality. The man Trump chose as his 
running mate signed a law that opened the door for Indiana businesses to 
discriminate against LGBT people and said marriage equality could cause 
‘societal collapse.’”

“As we’ve seen in North Carolina, discrimination isn’t only wrong – it’s bad 
for business. North Carolina’s egregious HB2 measure has caused companies to 
pull jobs and millions of dollars out of the state.”
 
The Trump campaign debuted its iPhone application this morning to relatively 
little fanfare - its release was accompanied by an email, but no tweets from 
the candidate himself - but privacy experts in the tech sphere are already 
casting a wary eye at the “America First” app as a potentially serious security 
risk for its users.

According to ABC News 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Business/trump-campaign-apps-data-grab-expose-contact-list/story?id=41642049>
, anyone who downloads the app opens the gate for the campaign to access and 
collect unusually vast quantities of data, including their entire address book 
and contact lists.

The app’s privacy policy <https://www.donaldjtrump.com/pages/app-privacy> 
informs users that the campaign “may access, collect, and store personal 
information about other people that is available to us through your contact 
list and/or address book.”


That’s a long step further than Hillary Clinton’s analogous campaign 
application, which does not acquire any contact information beyond that of the 
user.

“Trump’s is asking to collect significantly more data, and not just data about 
you, but data about anyone who might be in your contact list,” technology and 
civil liberties policy director at the ACLU of Northern California Nicole Ozer 
told ABC News.

“You have the situation where an individual is wanting to use the app, and 
they’re making decisions about other people’s privacy,” Ozer said. “Just 
because you choose to use an app, doesn’t mean that all the people you come in 
contact with want information about them shared with that campaign or that 
company.”
 
Donald Trump’s campaign chief has moved his voter registration to the home of 
one his website’s writers, after the Guardiandisclosed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump>
 that he was previously registered at an empty house in Florida where he did 
not live.

Stephen Bannon is now registered to vote at the Florida house of Andy Badolato 
<http://www.breitbart.com/author/andy-badolato/>, who reports for Breitbart 
News and has worked with Bannon in the past on the production of political 
films.

According to public records, Badolato, 52, and two of his adult sons are also 
registered to vote at the property, which he co-owns with his ex-wife.

A spokeswoman for Bannon, a spokesman for Trump, and Badolato did not respond 
to emailed questions about whether Bannon lives at the single-family house, 
which is listed as his residence on his new voter registration record in 
Sarasota County.

Alexandra Preate, a spokeswoman for Bannon, said earlier in an email that “Mr 
Bannon moved to a different residence in Florida”, repeating a statement about 
the issue that was previously released by Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller.

The Sarasota County supervisor of elections advises new registrants that they 
must use the address of their legal residence, andnotes prominently that 
applying with untrue information 
<http://www.sarasotavotes.com/content.aspx?id=16> can result in a felony charge 
punishable by five years in prison or a fine of up to $5,000.

Bannon, the recently hired chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway>
, made the amendment to his registration after being contacted by the Guardian 
for areport published on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump>
 morning about his previous voting registration arrangements.

The 62-year-old executive chairman of Breitbart News was from 2014 until this 
week registered to vote at two rented houses in Miami where his ex-wife lived. 
The second house has been vacant for months, according to neighbors, and is due 
to be demolished. Bannon, who owns property in California, works predominantly 
in Washington and New York.

Bannon, his ex-wife Diane Clohesy and the Trump campaign have not disputed 
that Bannon did not live in the Miami houses with Clohesy when given eight 
separate opportunities to do so before and after publication.

Badolato states on his website <http://www.andybadolato.com/> that he is an 
“entrepreneur, senior level executive, venture capitalist and seed stage 
investor” and claims to have founded companies that reached a total of $26bn in 
market capitalization. According to federal court records, he has filed for 
bankruptcy four times since 2008.

He is also an “editorial journalist and blog contributor” at Breitbart News 
and formerly worked as an associate producer on some of Bannon’s films such as 
The Undefeated, a documentary about the 2008 Republican vice-presidential 
nominee Sarah Palin.

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> will attend a 
fundraiser this evening at Harrah’s casino Lake Tahoe, in an event hosted by 
the Nevada Republican party.

Beforehand he will participate in meetings with local Hispanic leaders and 
small business owners, according to local reports:

<http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/08/giuliani_christie_urged_trump_to_soften_on_deporta.html#incart_river_mobile_index>
 that New Jersey governor Chris Christie is at least partially behind Donald 
Trump’s moderation this week on immigration.

Trump indicated for the first time this week that he may be open to an 
immigration reform plan that includes a path to legal status for some 
undocumented migrants.

Former New York City mayor and Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani told NJ.com how 
it played out, the sitereports

:

And, Giuliani says, even more Christie-inspired changes to Trump’s immigration 
stance will be forthcoming, like his call for tracking immigrant visas like
Fedex packages, 
<http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/09/fedex_visa_tracking_christie_called_for_already_in.html>
 and using theE-Verify <https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify> system to reduce 
illegal labor.

In an interview with NJ Advance Media on Thursday, Giuliani, a top adviser to 
the Republican presidential nominee, said Trump’s recentreversal on immigration 
policy 
<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/08/25/trump_live_polls_immigration_policy_with_hannity_town_hall_audience_who_wants_them_thrown_out.html>
 came after his inner circle for several weeks suggested a more nuanced, 
practical, and humane approach in dealing with the nation’s 11 million 
undocumented immigrants.

Asked if Christie was responsible for Trump’s softening approach to 
immigration, the former mayor responded: “The answer to that question is yes.”
