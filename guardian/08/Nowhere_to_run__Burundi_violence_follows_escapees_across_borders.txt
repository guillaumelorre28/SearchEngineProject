Teams of thugs are slipping out of Burundi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/burundi> and into refugee camps in 
neighbouring countries to launch murderous attacks on exiles, as government 
militias’ campaign of terror spills over the country’s borders, survivors say.

The central African nation slid into violence last year after the president, 
Pierre Nkurunziza, pushed aside the constitution andran for a third term 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/24/burundi-pierre-nkurunziza-wins-third-term-disputed-election>
 in office. Since then more than 250,000 people have poured across its borders 
seeking safety in neighbouring Rwanda, Tanzania and Congo.

The exodus has been large enough for attackers to hide among the crowds along 
with their targets. Such is the threat – made clear in police and medical 
reports seen by the Guardian – that some Burundians have been moved to their 
refugee camp’s only guarded living area in an attempt to keep them safe.

Some say they are being targeted to prevent them from sharing their accounts 
of abuse in a countryhovering on the brink of civil war 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/burundi-ethnic-violence-refugees>
, where thousands have been abducted, tortured, raped and killed. Others 
believe they are being singled out by people who want to punish family members 
active in the opposition.

Almost all say the violence that followed them across the border is even more 
terrifying than what they endured at home, because now they have nowhere to run.

Claude and his family fled after armed men killed his younger brother outside 
their family home, gang-raped his heavily pregnant wife in front of their young 
son, and beat him badly. He asked that his real name not be used to protect 
relatives still inside Burundi from possible reprisal attacks.

Claude says he was targeted after he resisted pressure to back a 
pro-government relative. A man initially demanded his identity documents so he 
could use Claude’s vote in the presidential poll, and ultimately tried to 
coerce him into serving as a driver on nighttime militia raids, he says.

Leaving was difficult and traumatic, and the family’s life in exile was dull 
and stressful, but it seemed a small price to pay for safety – until the week 
they found his torturers waiting outside church and saw one of his wife’s 
rapists lingering in the market in their corner of the camp.

“Where are you staying these days?” the thugs asked him after the family 
service on Sunday. “So you are here?” the rapist said with a grin a few days 
later. The nightmare they had sacrificed everything to escape had pursued them 
across the border.

Claude’s family reported the meetings to authorities at the sprawling 
Nyarugusu camp, a shanty town of 150,000 people on the Tanzanian border. The
third largest refugee settlement in the world 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/14/life-escaping-conflict-nyarugusu-tanzania-i-dont-feel-like-burundian-i-am-a-refugee>
, it offers would-be killers plenty of places to hide.

Although the road in and out is closely controlled by the Tanzanian military, 
there are no fences around the camp, meaning residents can fan out into the 
surrounding brush to look for firewood, and outsiders can slip in unregistered.

The only response the family got from overstretched workers was advice to be 
careful. But then Claude was attacked again. He was returning to his tent one 
evening when someone set on him from behind and wrestled him to the ground, 
trying to stab and strangle him.

They rolled into a pile of rubbish together as they fought, and Claude’s 
attacker lost his grip, giving him a chance to run, screaming for help, towards 
some nearby tents.

After getting treatment for his injuries, Claude begged for help, and this 
time local elders decided he needed more protection. They petitioned camp 
authorities to move him into a more secure area.

The area is fenced off and only verified residents are allowed in and out, but 
security is only relative. Claude and his family have to venture out to get 
their supply of food and collect firewood to cook it on, and his would-be 
assassins know where they are.

“I am not safe in that place. Everyone knows that I am not safe,” he said. 
“One day I had been to get our rations, and I was going back and saw him just 
smoking outside. I ran.”

Aid workers and experts say they have no evidence that Burundian militias are 
operating inside Nyarugusu or other camps. But the overcrowded secure area, 
which also hosts victims of domestic violence, is evidence that some vulnerable 
residents are considered to be at critical risk from attackers inside the camp.

And a widespread and well-documented fear of reprisal attacks among Burundian 
refugees in several countries is testament to how extensive the terrifying 
violence inside the country has become, said Carina Tertsakian, senior 
researcher forAfrica <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> with Human 
Rights Watch.

“The refugees not only in Tanzania <https://www.theguardian.com/world/tanzania>
 but also in a number of other countries are very frightened and very worried 
about their security even outside Burundi,” she said. “Whether those threats 
are real or not, it’s alarming because it shows the degree of fear that 
Burundians are living with because of the violence inside the country, even 
when they have left.”

Claude’s neighbour Sylvie lost her husband, a former government employee, 
after he publicly declared his support for the opposition and began organising 
for elections. He was shot dead outside their home.

“I heard the shots, but I didn’t know it was my husband they were killing. 
When I saw his body, I fainted because his face had been destroyed,” said 
Sylvie, 32, who also asked that her real name not be used to protect her 
children.

Early the next week, a man who she thinks was the killer contacted her by 
phone. “Please say your last prayers, because after a short time I will come to 
kill you,” he told her.

She fled to Tanzania and remembers a few nights of relative peace and 
security, until one evening when she was cooking outside their tent and someone 
walked up and slapped her back. He winked at her and said: “Shhh, you have to 
stop talking,” then walked away. It was the voice from the phone.

She reported it to police, who asked authorities to move her to a different 
part of the camp, a long way from her old tent. It did not take the man long to 
track her down again. The next month she was assaulted in the camp latrines. 
Neighbours found her bleeding and with her face covered in faeces, after an 
unknown attacker had pushed her head into the ditch to silence her.

When he raised a knife to stab her, she said, his grip loosened for a second 
and she squirmed away, shouted and raised her arm towards the blade. “I think 
he wanted to stab me in the chest, but I moved my arm so he slashed that 
instead.”

Neighbours came running to help when they heard her scream, and the man 
vanished into the night. Sylvie was taken to hospital where she was given nine 
stitches in her arm and antibiotics to ward off infection.

After four days in hospital, police asked for her to be moved to the 
fenced-off area. But she too has seen her attackers lurking outside, and she 
doubts the camp authorities can hold them off forever.

“They follow me here because I know the whole story of what happened in the 
government,” Sylvie said. “They think I will share their secrets.”
