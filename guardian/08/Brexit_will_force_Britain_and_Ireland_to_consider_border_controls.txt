Control of our own borders was a principle demand of those who campaigned for 
Brexit, so it would be rank hypocrisy for us to seek to control who can enter 
another sovereign state (This Brexit plan will divide Britain and Ireland once

, 11 October). As a majority of voters in Northern Ireland voted to remain and 
are presumably happy for current border arrangements with the Republic to 
continue, surely the only acceptable solution for controlling entry into the UK 
is to treat Northern Ireland as a special case and introduce border controls at 
the entry points between it and the rest of the UK.

• Increased UK/Irish collaboration makes perfect economic and geographical 
sense. Just as France has officers at St Pancras, in London, assisting UK 
counterparts, it makes sense to have UK officers in Dublin assisting their 
Irish counterparts, and Irish officers at London airports assisting their UK 
counterparts. There is also a prima facie case for a rail tunnel between Larne 
and Stranraer linking both parts of the United Kingdom. And such a project 
would also benefit the island ofIreland

• Claims that UK border controls on non-EU migrants to the UK at Irish ports 
will obviate the need for a “hard” border between the Irish Republic and
Northern Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> do not bear 
scrutiny. After Brexit, goods flowing across the Irish border will be subject 
to tariffs and regulation, and without control points at the Irish border on 
the movement of these goods, a smuggling free-for-all will develop. Only a hard 
border can ensure that lorryloads of EU goods driven by EU citizens, rolling 
off the ferries in Dublin, don’t head north unimpeded to cross the “invisible” 
border. Of course there will have to be a hard border; the movement of goods 
from the EU to and from a post-Brexit UK requires it.

• My wife’s relatives who live in New York State in the vicinity of Niagara 
Falls often cross the border into Canada to visit family or for other reasons. 
This involves going through border controls once a week or more. The process is 
expedited for them because on production of a credit-card-sized pass with an 
identifying chip they can use a designated channel for those with “trusted 
traveller or visitor” status. Holders are fully vetted. Might not such a scheme 
help in the present situation following the Brexit vote and especially between 
Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?
