If ever a museum deserved a prize, it is the V&A in South Kensington, London. 
This great Victorian creation, which hasjust been named museum of the year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/06/unforgettable-va-wins-museum-of-the-year-award>
, attracts huge audiences for its blockbuster exhibitions on the likes of
Alexander McQueen 
<http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/exhibition-alexander-mcqueen-savage-beauty/>
 and Kylie Minogue. Beyond those glamorous events, however, its real strength 
is as a vast cabinet of curiosities, full of almost limitless surprises. Its 
collections contain everything from porcelain goats to a Hello Kitty lunchbox, 
all waiting to be discovered among what feels like miles of sometimes 
labyrinthine, sometimes awesomely grand galleries. Here is a magical mystery 
tour of some of the museum’s lesser-known wonders.

Lou Reed concert poster 
<http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/out-in-the-museum/out-on-display-17-lou-reed> (1973)

Huge audiences visited the innovative exhibition David Bowie Is 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/17/david-bowie-is-exhibition-review>
 in 2013, but this was just the tip of a pop-culture iceberg. Posters for 
long-past live performances can be found in its theatre department, along with 
Mick Jagger’s incredibly tight-fittingJumpin’ Jack Flash stage suit 
<http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O171888/rock-and-pop-clark-ossie/>, and an 
installation that recreates Kylie Minogue’s dressing room. This image of druggy 
bisexual rock genius Lou Reed is based on the cover of his 1972 album,
Transformer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/22/transformer-lou-reed>. 
The deliberately vulgar, disco-style lettering and raw look of the poster 
perfectly reflect the vicious feedback and proto-punk aggression of Reed’s 
concerts in the early 70s. He hit them with a flower.

Some of the most majestic sculptures in the world can be seen at the V&A, from 
sensual terracotta models that still preserve Renaissance artist Giambologna’s 
fingerprints to smoothly erotic marbles by the neoclassicist Canova, but this 
is my favourite. Although it was sculpted in 17th-century Rome, it’s in the 
British galleries. Baker, a courtier of Charles I, took a portrait of his king 
to Rome so the great sculptor Bernini could base a bust on it. While there, he 
posed for this frolicsome portrait, which recreates the delicacy of his lace 
collar and soft cavalier hair. Only Bernini could carve a hairstyle as buoyant 
as this out of rock.

Even the cafe has its secret treasures, although the days are long gone when 
it notoriously advertised itself as “a nice cafe with a museum attached”. In 
fact, the high quality of its catering facilities goes back to the Victorian 
age. It has three grand Victorian dining rooms, still very much in use, of 
which the most dimly lit and least spectacular is by far the most artistically 
important. TheGreen Dining Room 
<http://www.vam.ac.uk/__data/assets/image/0020/212672/60286-large.jpg>, as it 
should properly be called, was created by William Morris and Company, and 
expresses the Victorian Marxist designer’s desire to return to a monastic 
medieval community. Its deep, dream-coloured walls and stained-glass windows 
create a sombre mood perfect for thinking about all the amazing stuff you’ve 
just seen, or recovering from a crowded blockbuster show about shoes.

The notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci are among the greatest treasures of the 
human mind. His tiny handwriting, scribbled from right to left in an attempt at 
secret code, is juxtaposed with page after page of diagrams of pulleys, designs 
for flying machines and illustrations of the anatomical dissections he did at a 
Florentine hospital. The V&A owns five of these extraordinary books. Unlike his 
manuscripts in the Royal Collection or Milan’s Ambrosian library, they are 
still in their original calf-skin bindings. Even more amazingly, the museum 
puts them, in rotation, on free public display.

The V&A has fantastic fashion collections, but they don’t just cover 
celebrated modern designers, nor are clothes restricted to the fashion 
galleries. This well-preserved English evening dress from the age of Jane 
Austen is on view in the new Europe galleries, which helped the museum pick up 
its well-deserved gong. The dress’s slender waist, almost see-through 
flimsiness and fiery red hue prove that fashion could be as daring 200 years 
ago as it is in the age of Alexander McQueen. It invites you to imagine who 
wore it – a real-life character from a Gothic novel, a woman out of an Ingres 
portrait, a debutante at the ball on the eve of Waterloo? History comes alive 
through objects like this.

One of the most surprising collections in this treasury of world art is a 
remarkable group of Buddhist sculptures associated with the ancient Gandhara 
culture, which show how artistic influences spread between east and west nearly 
2,000 years ago. This image of the Buddha strongly resembles the disciplined, 
harmonious realism of ancient Greek art. At first it seems like coincidence – 
then you examine other sculptures near it and see the clear influence of 
Greco-Roman art.
