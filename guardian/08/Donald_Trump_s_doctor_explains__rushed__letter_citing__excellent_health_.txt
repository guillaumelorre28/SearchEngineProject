Speaking to NBC News 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-doctor-wrote-health-letter-just-5-minutes-limo-waited-n638526>
, Dr Harold Bornstein also insisted that he wrote the letter, which contains 
some notably Trump-esque phrasing, and repeated his glowing if not medically 
specific endorsement of the candidate’s fitness for office.

The Trump campaign released the letter 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/27/the-strange-tale-of-donald-trumps-doctor-letter-just-got-stranger/>
 in December. Addressed “To Whom My Concern [sic]”, it read: “Over the past 39 
years, I am pleased to report that Mr Trump has had no significant medical 
problems. Mr Trump has had a recent complete medical examination that showed 
only positive results. Actually, his blood pressure, 110/65, and laboratory 
test results were astonishingly excellent.”

Questions about the legitimacy and authority 
<http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-health-doctor-490836> of the letter and 
its author’s medical background have arisen as Trump and campaign surrogates 
such asformer New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/giuliani-fuels-clinton-health-rumors-again-again-n635841>
 have questioned the physical and mental health of the businessman’s 
68-year-old opponent in the November election, former secretary of state 
Hillary Clinton.

By precedent if not legal compulsion – as with tax returns, which Trump has 
not released – presidential candidates usually release details of their medical 
history during an election campaign. Clinton did solast July

.

Trump, who is 70, would be the oldest man to enter the White House if elected. 
Bornstein’s letter said the billionaire’s “physical strength and stamina are 
extraordinary”, detailed his loss of 15lbs in the last 12 months, and 
concluded: “If elected, Mr Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the 
healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.”

picked up Trump's language in health letter & 'interpreted it into my own.'

On 3 December, Trump tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/672401996826206208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>
 that he had “instructed my long-time doctor to issue, within two weeks, a full 
medical report”, adding: “It will show perfection.”


Speaking to NBC News, Bornstein said that when the Trump team sent a driver to 
pick up the letter, which is dated 4 December, he had “five minutes to sit 
right at this desk and write that letter while the driver waited for me … In 
the rush, I think some of those words didn’t come out exactly the way they were 
meant.


“I thought about it all day and at the end, I get rushed and I get anxious 
when I get rushed. So I try to get four or five lines down as fast as possible 
so that they would be happy.”

He added: “[Trump’s] health is excellent, particularly his mental health. He 
thinks he’s the best, which works out just fine … I think he would be fit 
because, I think, his brain is turned on 24 hours a day.”


This week, CNN health correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta questioned 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-health/> 
the authenticity and value of Bornstein’s letter.

“I don’t even know what to make of this letter,” Gupta said. “Whether you are 
a doctor or not, that degree of hyperbole and these words being used is very 
unusual. People don’t write like that … ‘Strength and stamina are 
extraordinary’ … what does that mean, exactly?”

Asked in the NBC News report if the Trump letter was written in a style 
consistent with all his official letters, Bornstein said: “No, but for Mr 
Trump, I wrote that letter that way.”

Asked if he had been asked by Trump to write in Trumpian prose, he said 
<https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/769298267024809985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>
: “I think I probably picked up his kind of language and then just interpreted 
it to my own.”

Bornstein has been Trump’s personal doctor for 35 years. In his letter, he 
said his father, Dr Jacob Bornstein, had filled the role previously.

In a statement to NBC News, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said: “Dr Bornstein 
has been Mr Trump’s doctor for decades and is already familiar with his 
excellent health records.”

Clinton chose to make light of the issue, and attacks from the Trump campaign, 
this week.Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/hillary-clinton-on-jimmy-kimmel-opens-up-about-trumps-wacky-health-claims>
, she said: “Back in October, the National Enquirer said I’d be dead in six 
months, so with every breath I take, I feel like it’s a new lease on life.”
