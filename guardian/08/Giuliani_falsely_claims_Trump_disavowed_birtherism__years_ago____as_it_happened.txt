Today in Campaign 2016

 * Hillary Clinton today derided Donald Trump’s praise of Vladimir Putin as 
“unpatriotic” and “scary” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/hillary-clinton-trump-unpatriotic-scary-putin>
 and suggested the Republican nominee’s coziness with the Russian president 
could represent a threat to national security. In a press conference at an 
airport in Westchester, New York, her first such formal event in 278 days, 
Clinton discussed Trump’s remarks at a “commander-in-chief forum” hosted by NBC 
andIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America <http://iava.org/> in New York last 
night, in which the nomineesdrew sharp contrasts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy>
 on foreign policy and national security in back-to-back appearances that 
previewed their first debate later this month. 
 * Many Republicans who returned to Washington this week after the summer 
recess expressed confidence that Trump was improving as a candidate in both 
tone and message. But today, they found themselves in the familiar routine of
distancing themselves 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-putin-senate-republicans-marco-rubio-john-mccain>
 from Trump’s comments – the latest being his praise for Putin in an NBC News
national security forum held on Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy>
. “If you’re running for leader of the free world and you’re expressing 
admiration for Putin, well then you’re losing me,” Lindsey Graham, a senator 
from South Carolina and former Republican presidential candidate, told 
reporters. “I think Vladimir Putin is a thug, a dictator, an autocratic ruler 
who has his opposition killed in the streets of Russia. He has dismembered his 
neighbor.” 
 * Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson appeared clueless about the 
Syrian crisis this morning, asking “What is Aleppo?” during a television 
interview. Mike Barnicle, during an interview on NBC’s Morning Joe, asked 
Johnson: “What would you do if you were elected, about Aleppo?” Aleppo, 
formerly Syria’s largest city, has been the worst hit area during the country’s 
war. But Johnsondidn’t know what Aleppo was 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/aleppo-gary-johnson-syria-war-question>
.

 * The Donald Trump campaign has confirmed reports yesterday that it raised 
$90m in August, versus $143m raised by Clinton. But the campaign did not say 
how much of the $90m is earmarked for the Republican national committee or 
state parties, as campaigns customarily do. Without knowing the breakdown, we 
don’t know how much money the campaign has. Facebook

Rudy Giuliani falsely claims Donald Trump disavowed birtherism 'years ago'

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made his first serious foray into 
American presidential politics in 2011, when he made himself the most public 
face of the so-called “birther” movement, conspiracists who believethe 
long-discredited theory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/27/barack-obama-birth-certificate-released>
 that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and is therefore 
constitutionally ineligible to serve as president.

point immigration policy. Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images 
Since deciding to become Obama’s successor, he has avoided answering questions 
as to whether he still believes that Obama was not born an American citizen, 
but that hasn’t kept members of the press from asking both the candidate and 
his surrogates whether Trump still subscribes to a conspiracy theory that many 
Americans see as racist.

The latest surrogate: Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who told MSNBC’s 
Chris Matthews tonight that Trump had long ago dismissed the theory publicly.

This has never happened.

“I confirm that and Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> now confirms that,” Giuliani 
said when Matthews asked him to confirm that Obama was born in the US. “He did 
that two years ago... two years ago. Three years ago.”

Giuliani continued, blaming the fomenting of birtherism on Clinton’s 2008 
presidential campaign, due to some volunteers, later fired, who spread emails 
stirring the conspiracy.

“The point is that Hillary Clinton’s campaign is the first one to do it 
because all she does is engage in negative campaigning againstBarack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> and against Donald Trump.”

“He is the one who got him to finally produce the birth certificate,” Giuliani 
said of Trump. “Hillary Clinton’s campaign first raised this issue.”

Matthews attempted to get Giuliani, as Trump’s surrogate, to commit Trump to 
declaring in public that Obama is a legitimate citizen of the United States 
within the next 24 hours, but Giuliani averred.

“You are speaking for Donald Trump,” Matthews said, nearly shouting. “And we 
are ending this now because we are spending a lot of time on it but I think it 
is important. You say this president was legitimately elected president of the 
United States and you say your candidate agrees with you.”

“I believe he was legitimately elected president,” Giuliani said. “And instead 
of talking about the fact thatHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> violated probably about 
40 different federal laws, we are talking about this, which is ridiculous.”

Speaking with Larry King on Kremlin-backed RT America, Republican presidential 
nominee Donald Trump declared that he doesn’t want Libertarian presidential 
nominee Gary Johnson to participate in upcoming presidential debates and 
criticized the candidate for revealing to MSNBC this morning thathe did not 
know what Aleppo is 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/aleppo-gary-johnson-syria-war-question>
.

“I don’t know that it’ll hurt him that much, frankly,” Trump said of Johnson’s 
comments this morning, in which he was asked how he would handle the 
humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, Syria.

“But, you know, he didn’t know that. I saw that. And, you know, it maybe it’ll 
hurt him a little bit but I think he’ll scoot by. Look, he’s not too much of a 
factor. They seem to be going down. The other two, they seem to be going down a 
little bit - we’ll see what happens.”

Asked whether he would welcome Johnson to join himself and Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> in the upcoming 
presidential debate at Hofstra University, Trump said no.

“I’d rather be Hillary and myself because we’re the only two with a chance of 
winning.”

Hillary Clinton opens up about sexism in new Humans of New York post

Lauren Gambino

As a young woman applying to law school, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> learned a hard, 
everlasting lesson in gender dynamics that would help shape her public persona 
years later as a politician.

In a rare and deeply personal interview on the popular blog Humans of New York 
<http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/150127870371/i-was-taking-a-law-school-admissions-test-in-a>
, the Democratic nominee said the public’s view of her as “cold” and “walled 
off” is the result of having learned to “control” her emotions.

In the post, Clinton recalled sitting down to take a law school admissions 
test at Harvard. She realized looking around that room that she was one of just 
a handful of women taking the exam. As she waited for the exam to be 
administered, a group of men began to taunt the women, shouting insults like: 
“You don’t need to be here” and “There’s plenty else you can do.”


“One of them even said: ‘If you take my spot, I’ll get drafted, and I’ll go to 
Vietnam, and I’ll die,’” Clinton said.

Clinton’s appearance on Humans of New York comes a day after the Republican 
National Committee (RNC) chairman, Reince Priebus, was roundly criticized for 
his musings onClinton’s performance during the forum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-clinton-foreign-policy-forum-key-quotes>
.
Reince Priebus (@Reince) 
@HillaryClinton <https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton> was angry + defensive the 
entire time - no smile and uncomfortable - upset that she was caught wrongly 
sending our secrets.

<https://twitter.com/Reince/status/773694140404170752> 
Clinton’s campaign fired back: “Actually, that’s just what taking the office 
of President seriously looks like.”

One day after Donald Trump reiterated his admiration for Vladimir Putin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin>, saying the Russian 
president was a better leader than Barack Obama, Republicans on Capitol Hill 
struggled to explain why their party’s presidential nominee was enamored with a 
man they have long cast as one of America’s primary foes.

Many Republicans who returned to Washington this week after the summer recess 
expressed confidence that Trump was improving as a candidate in both tone and 
message. But on Thursday, they found themselves in the familiar routine of 
distancing themselves from Trump’s comments – the latest being his praise for 
Putin in anNBC News national security forum held Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy>
.

“If you’re running for leader of the free world and you’re expressing 
admiration for Putin, well then you’re losing me,” Lindsey Graham, a senator 
from South Carolina and former Republican presidential candidate, told 
reporters.

“I think Vladimir Putin is a thug, a dictator, an autocratic ruler who has his 
opposition killed in the streets of Russia. He has dismembered his neighbor.”

While Graham said he found Obama to be “weak”, “indecisive” and someone Putin 
had “walked all over”, the visibly frustrated senator added: “But no, I’m not 
going to say that Putin’s a better leader than a Democratic elected president 
of the United States even though I have differences with him.”

It was just earlier this week that Graham, who has thus far declined to 
endorse Trump and has been among the candidate’s biggest critics, spoke 
positively for the first time of the direction his campaign had taken. After 
telling reporters on Monday that Trump would giveHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> “a hell of a race”, the 
senator hardly minced his words when reacting to Trump’s overtures toward Putin.

“This whole idea of admiring Putin is the biggest misunderstanding of a 
relationship in a person since Munich,” Graham said.

Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida who made his opposition to Putin a 
central tenet of his own presidential campaign,similarly disagreed with Trump’s 
assertion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/03/vladimir-putin-is-a-gangster-and-thug-says-us-presidential-candidate-marco-rubio>
 that the Russian president was a better leader than Obama.

“Look, I have tremendous policy disagreements with President Obama, but 
Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one,” Rubio 
told the Guardian.

“I don’t think what Vladimir Putin exhibits is leadership. I think what he 
exhibits is thuggery … and we should be clear-eyed about that,” he added, 
noting that Putin controlled the media, the military and often his political 
opponents were either imprisoned or found dead.

Asked by the Guardian if he was concerned that Trump had a penchant for 
commending Putin, despite those facts, Rubio said he was hopeful the 
candidate’s posture might evolve.

“My sense is those views will probably change once he understands better who 
Vladimir Putin truly is – that’s my hope,” responded the senator, who is 
backing Trump.

Trump: Hillary Clinton believes in 'globalism, not Americanism'

Tom Kutsch

Donald Trump today attacked Hillary Clinton for espousing “trigger-happy” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-us-military-spending-sequester-isis>
 interventionist policies which he said has made the US less safe than ever 
before. The Republican presidential nominee also targeted the Democrat for what 
he said was her belief in “globalism” instead of “Americanism”.


Trump repeated his claim to have been opposed to the Iraq war for which 
Clinton voted “from the beginning”, a claim which has repeatedly been shown to 
be untrue.

, in New York City. That event offered a preview of the forthcoming 
presidential debates and led to criticism of the host, Matt Lauer, over his 
questioning of the two candidates.

“She believes in globalism, not Americanism,” Trump said. “On top of it all, 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is 
trigger happy.”

The Cleveland speech was ostensibly dedicated to education policy and school 
choice. But Trump devoted significant time to well-worn campaign themes, 
including a lengthy prelude about what he called Clinton’s “criminal cover-up” 
over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, her views on 
foreign policy and her record in office, and what he said were her frequent 
factual misrepresentations.

Earlier, at a press conference 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/hillary-clinton-trump-unpatriotic-scary-putin>
 on an airport tarmac in White Plains, New York, Clinton criticised Trump’s 
comments at the NBC forum about Russian presidentVladimir Putin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin>, of whom the Republican has 
often spoken favorably and who, he said on Wednesday, has “been a leader, far 
more than our president has been a leader”.

Clinton said: “Now that is not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of 
our country as well as to our commander-in-chief. It is scary.”

Trump said: “She tried to make up for her horrible performance last night. So 
she went on the tarmac and told more lies.”

Trump chose again to highlight his own historic statements in opposition to 
the Iraq war and call out Clinton’s 2003 vote in support of it, when she was 
the junior senator from New York.


“Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race,” he said. “I was opposed 
to the war from the beginning.”

Trump read aloud statements he made to Esquire magazine in August 2004, more 
than a year after the start of the Iraq war, in which he was critical of US 
policies in the country.

“The media is so terribly dishonest, so I had to do this,” he said.

Mike Pence: It is 'inarguable' that Vladimir Putin is superior to Barack Obama

Indiana governor Mike Pence has defended running mate Donald Trump’s 
declaration that Russian president Vladimir Putin is a superior leader compared 
to US presidentBarack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama>, 
telling CNN’s Dana Bash that it is “inarguable” that the Russian strongman is 
better than Obama.

“I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his 
country than Barack Obama has been in this country. And that’s going to change 
the day thatDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
becomes president,” Pence said.

In NBC’s “Commander-in-Chief” forum last night, in which Trump and rival 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> were 
separately questioned about matters relating to the military and national 
security, Trump told host Matt Lauer than Putin, who he has previously praised, 
has “been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.”

Trump has been publicly enamored with the Russian strongman since the 
primaries, and is given to inaccurately repeating the anecdote that Putin once 
called him “brilliant.”

“I think when he calls me ‘brilliant,’ I’ll take the compliment,” Trump said 
last night about Putin. “If he says great things about me, I’m going to say 
great things about him.”

The story refers to remarks Putin made in December 2015, in which the Russian 
president - who has been criticized internationally for theinvasion and 
annexation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/russia-crimea-white-house> of 
Crimea, themurder by poisoning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/alexander-litvinenko-was-probably-murdered-on-personal-orders-of-putin>
 of a Russian citizen and has beenimplicated in the death 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/oct/09/guardianobituaries.russia> of an 
investigative journalist, although Trump hasdismissed such claims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/20/donald-trump-defends-vladimir-putin-endorsement>
 as baseless - when Putin used the word “yarkii” (or яркий) to describe Trump.

The word means “brilliant” or “bright,” but in the sense of spectacle or 
shininess - akin to “flashy” or “flamboyant.”

Indiana governor Mike Pence doesn’t speak Hebrew - not that that’s a 
prerequisite for the office of the vice president - butaccording to The Forward 
<http://forward.com/the-assimilator/349477/mike-pence-makes-bid-for-jewish-votes-with-awkwardly-worded-hebrew-sign/>
, it makes reaching out to Hebrew-speaking voters a little, well, tricky:

The Republican vice presidential candidate was photographed holding a sign 
written in Hebrew that was supposed to read ‘Make America Great Again’ - but 
translates roughly as ‘To Reverse America to Great Once More.’ The first word 
on the bottom of the sign is a verb in its infinitive form, making it confusing 
to Hebrew speakers from the get go.
Scott Bixby (@scottbix) 
This sign translates as “To Reverse America to Great Once More.”

As the election nears, the Obama swan song continues with ever growing 
poignancy. Today, first lady Michelle Obama hosted her fifth and final class of
national student poets at the White House 
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/first-lady-michelle-obama-honors-2016-class-national-student-poets-program>
.

“Well, I have to say that this event - I’ve said this too many times, because 
we’re celebrating a lot of ‘last’ here this year - but this is the last time 
that we’re going to have the pleasure of welcoming a class of national student 
poets to the White House, at least under this administration,” Obama said. “So 
I’m feeling a little melancholy here, because this has truly been an honour and 
a privilege and a joy.”

The first lady condemned the “pretty devastating” cuts to art and music 
classes in schools across the country that preceded her husband’s 
administration.A recent Washington Post article 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/a-master-of-pop-culture-had-little-to-do-with-the-high-arts/2016/09/02/e84e8de2-64a7-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html>
 suggested that arts communities feel let down by the president for not showing 
a greater interest.

But Obama said: “Barack and I also happen to be pretty huge poetry fans 
ourselves. My husband considers himself kind of a poet, but we’ll see. We’ll 
see. Maybe when he’s done he’ll write one for me. You hear that, honey? So 
that’s kind of where the idea of the national student poet programme came from.”

Obama also recalled the first White House poetry jam in 2009 where Lin-Manuel 
Miranda rapped about Alexander Hamilton 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNFf7nMIGnE>, soon to be expanded into the hit 
musical Hamilton, “one of the most extraordinary pieces of art that I - and 
probably so many others - have ever seen”.

But it was a poetry medley by students past and present, beneath a portrait of 
Abraham Lincoln in the state dining room, that moved Obama to the brink of 
tears on Thursday. “If we ever wonder...” she began, sighing with emotion, “if 
what we do makes a difference, it does.”

Her voice still low and unsteady, Obama added: “Thank you everyone for all of 
this. Thank you, guys. I’m so proud of you. That was beautiful. You guys are 
awesome. Have a great year.”

 * Hillary Clinton today derided Donald Trump’s praise of Vladimir Putin as 
“unpatriotic” and “scary” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/hillary-clinton-trump-unpatriotic-scary-putin>
 and suggested the Republican nominee’s coziness with the Russian president 
could represent a threat to national security. In a press conference at an 
airport in Westchester, New York, her first such formal event in 278 days, 
Clinton discussed Trump’s remarks at a “commander-in-chief forum” hosted by NBC 
andIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America <http://iava.org/> in New York last 
night, in which the nomineesdrew sharp contrasts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy>
 on foreign policy and national security in back-to-back appearances that 
previewed their first debate later this month. 
 * Many Republicans who returned to Washington this week after the summer 
recess expressed confidence that Trump was improving as a candidate in both 
tone and message. But today, they found themselves in the familiar routine of
distancing themselves 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-putin-senate-republicans-marco-rubio-john-mccain>
 from Trump’s comments – the latest being his praise for Putin in an NBC News
national security forum held on Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy>
. “If you’re running for leader of the free world and you’re expressing 
admiration for Putin, well then you’re losing me,” Lindsey Graham, a senator 
from South Carolina and former Republican presidential candidate, told 
reporters. “I think Vladimir Putin is a thug, a dictator, an autocratic ruler 
who has his opposition killed in the streets of Russia. He has dismembered his 
neighbor.” 
 * Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson appeared clueless about the 
Syrian crisis this morning, asking “What is Aleppo?” during a television 
interview. Mike Barnicle, during an interview on NBC’s Morning Joe, asked 
Johnson: “What would you do if you were elected, about Aleppo?” Aleppo, 
formerly Syria’s largest city, has been the worst hit area during the country’s 
war. But Johnsondidn’t know what Aleppo was 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/aleppo-gary-johnson-syria-war-question>
.

 * The Donald Trump campaign has confirmed reports yesterday that it raised 
$90m in August, versus $143m raised by Clinton. But the campaign did not say 
how much of the $90m is earmarked for the Republican national committee or 
state parties, as campaigns customarily do. Without knowing the breakdown, we 
don’t know how much money the campaign has.  
In response to Rudy Giuliani’s claims about Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, circa 2012:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that 
@BarackObama <https://twitter.com/BarackObama>'s birth certificate is a fraud.
 <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/232572505238433794> August 6, 2012
 <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/232572505238433794>  
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made his first serious foray into 
American presidential politics in 2011, when he made himself the most public 
face of the so-called “birther” movement, conspiracists who believethe 
long-discredited theory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/27/barack-obama-birth-certificate-released>
 that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and is therefore 
constitutionally ineligible to serve as president.

point immigration policy. Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images 
Since deciding to become Obama’s successor, he has avoided answering questions 
as to whether he still believes that Obama was not born an American citizen, 
but that hasn’t kept members of the press from asking both the candidate and 
his surrogates whether Trump still subscribes to a conspiracy theory that many 
Americans see as racist.

The latest surrogate: Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who told MSNBC’s 
Chris Matthews tonight that Trump had long ago dismissed the theory publicly.

This has never happened.

“I confirm that and Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> now confirms that,” Giuliani 
said when Matthews asked him to confirm that Obama was born in the US. “He did 
that two years ago... two years ago. Three years ago.”

Giuliani continued, blaming the fomenting of birtherism on Clinton’s 2008 
presidential campaign, due to some volunteers, later fired, who spread emails 
stirring the conspiracy.

“The point is that Hillary Clinton’s campaign is the first one to do it 
because all she does is engage in negative campaigning againstBarack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> and against Donald Trump.”

“He is the one who got him to finally produce the birth certificate,” Giuliani 
said of Trump. “Hillary Clinton’s campaign first raised this issue.”

Matthews attempted to get Giuliani, as Trump’s surrogate, to commit Trump to 
declaring in public that Obama is a legitimate citizen of the United States 
within the next 24 hours, but Giuliani averred.

“You are speaking for Donald Trump,” Matthews said, nearly shouting. “And we 
are ending this now because we are spending a lot of time on it but I think it 
is important. You say this president was legitimately elected president of the 
United States and you say your candidate agrees with you.”

“I believe he was legitimately elected president,” Giuliani said. “And instead 
of talking about the fact thatHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> violated probably about 
40 different federal laws, we are talking about this, which is ridiculous.”
 
Speaking with Larry King on Kremlin-backed RT America, Republican presidential 
nominee Donald Trump declared that he doesn’t want Libertarian presidential 
nominee Gary Johnson to participate in upcoming presidential debates and 
criticized the candidate for revealing to MSNBC this morning thathe did not 
know what Aleppo is 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/aleppo-gary-johnson-syria-war-question>
.

“I don’t know that it’ll hurt him that much, frankly,” Trump said of Johnson’s 
comments this morning, in which he was asked how he would handle the 
humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, Syria.

“But, you know, he didn’t know that. I saw that. And, you know, it maybe it’ll 
hurt him a little bit but I think he’ll scoot by. Look, he’s not too much of a 
factor. They seem to be going down. The other two, they seem to be going down a 
little bit - we’ll see what happens.”

Asked whether he would welcome Johnson to join himself and Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> in the upcoming 
presidential debate at Hofstra University, Trump said no.

“I’d rather be Hillary and myself because we’re the only two with a chance of 
winning.”

As a young woman applying to law school, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> learned a hard, 
everlasting lesson in gender dynamics that would help shape her public persona 
years later as a politician.

In a rare and deeply personal interview on the popular blog Humans of New York 
<http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/150127870371/i-was-taking-a-law-school-admissions-test-in-a>
, the Democratic nominee said the public’s view of her as “cold” and “walled 
off” is the result of having learned to “control” her emotions.

In the post, Clinton recalled sitting down to take a law school admissions 
test at Harvard. She realized looking around that room that she was one of just 
a handful of women taking the exam. As she waited for the exam to be 
administered, a group of men began to taunt the women, shouting insults like: 
“You don’t need to be here” and “There’s plenty else you can do.”


“One of them even said: ‘If you take my spot, I’ll get drafted, and I’ll go to 
Vietnam, and I’ll die,’” Clinton said.

Clinton’s appearance on Humans of New York comes a day after the Republican 
National Committee (RNC) chairman, Reince Priebus, was roundly criticized for 
his musings onClinton’s performance during the forum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-clinton-foreign-policy-forum-key-quotes>

One day after Donald Trump reiterated his admiration for Vladimir Putin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin>, saying the Russian 
president was a better leader than Barack Obama, Republicans on Capitol Hill 
struggled to explain why their party’s presidential nominee was enamored with a 
man they have long cast as one of America’s primary foes.

Many Republicans who returned to Washington this week after the summer recess 
expressed confidence that Trump was improving as a candidate in both tone and 
message. But on Thursday, they found themselves in the familiar routine of 
distancing themselves from Trump’s comments – the latest being his praise for 
Putin in anNBC News national security forum held Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy>
.

“If you’re running for leader of the free world and you’re expressing 
admiration for Putin, well then you’re losing me,” Lindsey Graham, a senator 
from South Carolina and former Republican presidential candidate, told 
reporters.

“I think Vladimir Putin is a thug, a dictator, an autocratic ruler who has his 
opposition killed in the streets of Russia. He has dismembered his neighbor.”

While Graham said he found Obama to be “weak”, “indecisive” and someone Putin 
had “walked all over”, the visibly frustrated senator added: “But no, I’m not 
going to say that Putin’s a better leader than a Democratic elected president 
of the United States even though I have differences with him.”

It was just earlier this week that Graham, who has thus far declined to 
endorse Trump and has been among the candidate’s biggest critics, spoke 
positively for the first time of the direction his campaign had taken. After 
telling reporters on Monday that Trump would giveHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> “a hell of a race”, the 
senator hardly minced his words when reacting to Trump’s overtures toward Putin.

“This whole idea of admiring Putin is the biggest misunderstanding of a 
relationship in a person since Munich,” Graham said.

Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida who made his opposition to Putin a 
central tenet of his own presidential campaign,similarly disagreed with Trump’s 
assertion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/03/vladimir-putin-is-a-gangster-and-thug-says-us-presidential-candidate-marco-rubio>
 that the Russian president was a better leader than Obama.

“Look, I have tremendous policy disagreements with President Obama, but 
Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one,” Rubio 
told the Guardian.

“I don’t think what Vladimir Putin exhibits is leadership. I think what he 
exhibits is thuggery … and we should be clear-eyed about that,” he added, 
noting that Putin controlled the media, the military and often his political 
opponents were either imprisoned or found dead.

Asked by the Guardian if he was concerned that Trump had a penchant for 
commending Putin, despite those facts, Rubio said he was hopeful the 
candidate’s posture might evolve.

“My sense is those views will probably change once he understands better who 
Vladimir Putin truly is – that’s my hope,” responded the senator, who is 
backing Trump.

Donald Trump today attacked Hillary Clinton for espousing “trigger-happy” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-us-military-spending-sequester-isis>
 interventionist policies which he said has made the US less safe than ever 
before. The Republican presidential nominee also targeted the Democrat for what 
he said was her belief in “globalism” instead of “Americanism”.


Trump repeated his claim to have been opposed to the Iraq war for which 
Clinton voted “from the beginning”, a claim which has repeatedly been shown to 
be untrue.

The Republican nominee was speaking in Cleveland, a day after taking part with 
Clinton in a “commander-in-chief forum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/hillary-clinton-trump-unpatriotic-scary-putin>
”, hosted by NBC andIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America <http://iava.org/>
, in New York City. That event offered a preview of the forthcoming 
presidential debates and led to criticism of the host, Matt Lauer, over his 
questioning of the two candidates.

“She believes in globalism, not Americanism,” Trump said. “On top of it all, 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is 
trigger happy.”

The Cleveland speech was ostensibly dedicated to education policy and school 
choice. But Trump devoted significant time to well-worn campaign themes, 
including a lengthy prelude about what he called Clinton’s “criminal cover-up” 
over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, her views on 
foreign policy and her record in office, and what he said were her frequent 
factual misrepresentations.

Earlier, at a press conference 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/hillary-clinton-trump-unpatriotic-scary-putin>
 on an airport tarmac in White Plains, New York, Clinton criticised Trump’s 
comments at the NBC forum about Russian presidentVladimir Putin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin>, of whom the Republican has 
often spoken favorably and who, he said on Wednesday, has “been a leader, far 
more than our president has been a leader”.

Clinton said: “Now that is not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of 
our country as well as to our commander-in-chief. It is scary.”

Trump said: “She tried to make up for her horrible performance last night. So 
she went on the tarmac and told more lies.”

Trump chose again to highlight his own historic statements in opposition to 
the Iraq war and call out Clinton’s 2003 vote in support of it, when she was 
the junior senator from New York.


“Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race,” he said. “I was opposed 
to the war from the beginning.”

Trump read aloud statements he made to Esquire magazine in August 2004, more 
than a year after the start of the Iraq war, in which he was critical of US 
policies in the country.

“The media is so terribly dishonest, so I had to do this,” he said.
 
Indiana governor Mike Pence has defended running mate Donald Trump’s 
declaration that Russian president Vladimir Putin is a superior leader compared 
to US presidentBarack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama>, 
telling CNN’s Dana Bash that it is “inarguable” that the Russian strongman is 
better than Obama.

“I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his 
country than Barack Obama has been in this country. And that’s going to change 
the day thatDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
becomes president,” Pence said.

In NBC’s “Commander-in-Chief” forum last night, in which Trump and rival 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> were 
separately questioned about matters relating to the military and national 
security, Trump told host Matt Lauer than Putin, who he has previously praised, 
has “been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.”

Trump has been publicly enamored with the Russian strongman since the 
primaries, and is given to inaccurately repeating the anecdote that Putin once 
called him “brilliant.”

“I think when he calls me ‘brilliant,’ I’ll take the compliment,” Trump said 
last night about Putin. “If he says great things about me, I’m going to say 
great things about him.”

The story refers to remarks Putin made in December 2015, in which the Russian 
president - who has been criticized internationally for theinvasion and 
annexation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/russia-crimea-white-house> of 
Crimea, themurder by poisoning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/alexander-litvinenko-was-probably-murdered-on-personal-orders-of-putin>
 of a Russian citizen and has beenimplicated in the death 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/oct/09/guardianobituaries.russia> of an 
investigative journalist, although Trump hasdismissed such claims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/20/donald-trump-defends-vladimir-putin-endorsement>
 as baseless - when Putin used the word “yarkii” (or яркий) to describe Trump.

The word means “brilliant” or “bright,” but in the sense of spectacle or 
shininess - akin to “flashy” or “flamboyant.”
 
Indiana governor Mike Pence doesn’t speak Hebrew - not that that’s a 
prerequisite for the office of the vice president - butaccording to The Forward 
<http://forward.com/the-assimilator/349477/mike-pence-makes-bid-for-jewish-votes-with-awkwardly-worded-hebrew-sign/>
, it makes reaching out to Hebrew-speaking voters a little, well, tricky:

The Republican vice presidential candidate was photographed holding a sign 
written in Hebrew that was supposed to read ‘Make America Great Again’ - but 
translates roughly as ‘To Reverse America to Great Once More.’ The first word 
on the bottom of the sign is a verb in its infinitive form, making it confusing 
to Hebrew speakers from the get go.

This sign translates as “To Reverse America to Great Once More.”

As the election nears, the Obama swan song continues with ever growing 
poignancy. Today, first lady Michelle Obama hosted her fifth and final class of
national student poets at the White House 
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/first-lady-michelle-obama-honors-2016-class-national-student-poets-program>
.

“Well, I have to say that this event - I’ve said this too many times, because 
we’re celebrating a lot of ‘last’ here this year - but this is the last time 
that we’re going to have the pleasure of welcoming a class of national student 
poets to the White House, at least under this administration,” Obama said. “So 
I’m feeling a little melancholy here, because this has truly been an honour and 
a privilege and a joy.”

The first lady condemned the “pretty devastating” cuts to art and music 
classes in schools across the country that preceded her husband’s 
administration.A recent Washington Post article 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/a-master-of-pop-culture-had-little-to-do-with-the-high-arts/2016/09/02/e84e8de2-64a7-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html>
 suggested that arts communities feel let down by the president for not showing 
a greater interest.

But Obama said: “Barack and I also happen to be pretty huge poetry fans 
ourselves. My husband considers himself kind of a poet, but we’ll see. We’ll 
see. Maybe when he’s done he’ll write one for me. You hear that, honey? So 
that’s kind of where the idea of the national student poet programme came from.”

Obama also recalled the first White House poetry jam in 2009 where Lin-Manuel 
Miranda rapped about Alexander Hamilton 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNFf7nMIGnE>, soon to be expanded into the hit 
musical Hamilton, “one of the most extraordinary pieces of art that I - and 
probably so many others - have ever seen”.

But it was a poetry medley by students past and present, beneath a portrait of 
Abraham Lincoln in the state dining room, that moved Obama to the brink of 
tears on Thursday. “If we ever wonder...” she began, sighing with emotion, “if 
what we do makes a difference, it does.”

Her voice still low and unsteady, Obama added: “Thank you everyone for all of 
this. Thank you, guys. I’m so proud of you. That was beautiful. You guys are 
awesome. Have a great year.”
