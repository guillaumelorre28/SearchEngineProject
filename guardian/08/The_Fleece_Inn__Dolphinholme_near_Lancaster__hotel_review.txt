According to Camra, 21 pubs are still shutting down each week. Not all of 
those are great pubs, it’s true, but, ultimately, the demise of any pub 
represents the loss of a community hub that, once turned into offices or flats, 
is gone forever. That is a particular problem in villages where, rather than 
bad management, it is often high rents and greedy pub companies that force 
otherwise viable pubs out of existence. All of which makes the renaissance of 
the Fleece Inn very good news.

Bought by the local Worthington family (which runs a sizable construction 
company in the north-west of England), this pub in pretty, sleepy Dolphinholme 
has been revamped with an emphasis on its community role. The Fleece is a 
living-wage employer and, following its January relaunch, now includes a 
village shop where visitors can buy handmade pens and walking sticks, and 
locals can pick up essentials such as tea bags, cornflakes and wine.

No one goes into the pub business to make a fortune but the Fleece in 
particular (most mains £10-£13, pint from £3.10), feels like a labour of love – 
and one that Dolphinholme has embraced. On a Thursday night, there is a lively 
buzz throughout the pub.

As you might expect, given the Worthingtons’ day job, the nine bedrooms have 
been finished to a high spec while retaining the exposed-beam character of this 
stone building, originally built as a farmhouse in the late 1600s. The interior 
decor is a bit staid and middle-aged but the Lakeland slate window sills, thick 
wool carpets and reassuringly solid bespoke wardrobes all ooze quality. From 
the firm beds to the slick bathrooms (with walls clad in polished stone), these 
are the sort of warm, simple, supremely comfortable bedrooms (one-click Wi-Fi, 
idiot-proof TV) you can just sink into. Although, for those staying at the 
front of the pub, a dilapidated garage opposite spoils the otherwise bucolic 
view.

The Fleece is seven miles from Lancaster and a convenient base for walking and 
cycling in theTrough of Bowland <http://www.troughofbowland.co.uk/>, but the 
less active may be tempted to simply lounge around the pub. It is a warren of 
rooms (the main bar is for drinkers only) and the refurb – open fires, ancient 
flagged floors, antique rugs, wood panelling, leather banquettes – has largely 
avoided anything too blingy. Glitzy mustard-yellow booths in the breakfast room 
(where I wolfed a huge fry-up that used top-notch pork products from Cumbria’s 
famous Woodall’s), are the only really incongruous feature.

In the garden, the smokers’ shed has its own log fire and the climbing frame 
is handmade in oak.

The main menu focuses on pub classics executed with rigour by chef Ian 
Manning, formerly of Good Food Guide regular the Cartford Inn 
<http://www.thecartfordinn.co.uk/>, though the specials edge into more 
sophisticated territory. Portions are on the hearty side, which can be a 
disadvantage: an “appetiser” of salt-cod fritters needs to be daintier, 
lighter, crisper. However, a shredded ham hock, spring onion and quinoa salad, 
with soft-boiled duck egg, is a clever interplay of flavours and textures and, 
from its bronzed, cheesy crust downwards, the fish pie is spot-on. It is thick 
with accurately cooked prawns and salmon; the sauce is well-seasoned; the mash 
smooth but satisfyingly dense. A fish pie shouldn’t be topped with overly 
finessed purée.

It is a pity the commitment to local sourcing doesn’t preclude Scottish 
biscuits in the bedrooms nor a generic choice of real ales (one truly local 
ale, plus the usual Black Sheep, Golden Pippin suspects). But those are minor 
points. From the well-calibrated service led by manager Maurice Camm to the 
modest wine mark-ups, there is a lot to like about the Fleece. Clearly, there 
is life in the British pub yet.
