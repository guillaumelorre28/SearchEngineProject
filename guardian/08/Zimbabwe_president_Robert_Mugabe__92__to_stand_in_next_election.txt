Zimbabwe’s 92-year-old president, Robert Mugabe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/robert-mugabe>, was endorsed on Saturday as 
the ruling party’s candidate in a national election scheduled for 2018.

The ruling Zanu-PF party announced its support in the south-eastern town of 
Masvingo, where the party’s youth wing proposed that Mugabe should rule for 
life with broad powers.

Opposition groups have described such adulation as a sign that Mugabe and his 
loyalists were out of touch with the desperation of a nation that is suffering 
massive unemployment, cash shortages and company closures.

Despite the praise, Mugabe has acknowledged that some people within the ruling 
party wanted him to quit. “Let us stop fighting each other,” he said, referring 
to the succession disputes that have engulfed his party.

Mugabe has been in power since the southern African nation’s independence from 
white minority rule in 1980. But a deteriorating economy has increased the 
pressure on him, and he has faced opposition protests in the past year.

The Zanu-PF party rallied around Mugabe at its annual conference and most 
delegates wore the party’s colors of red, green, black and yellow, as well as 
Mugabe’s portrait. Speaker after speaker extolled his virtues.

Cabinet minister Supa Mandiwanzira did so by making a pun about his own first 
name. “I am not super, Mr President. It is you who is super,” he said, 
introducing the leader.

Kudzai Chipanga, leader of the party’s youth wing, suggested that Mugabe’s 
identity and birth certificate should be changed to read “President Robert 
Mugabe”.

Mugabe, who won the 2013 election that was marred by allegations of voting 
irregularities, has seemed frail at times but still travels widely and has said 
he wants to live to 100.
