I sang carols in Hardy’s birthplace last Christmas, took part in Going the 
Rounds through Bockhampton and Stinsford only last year, and regularly sing out 
with the Ridgeway Singers and Band. Thanks to the tireless energies of Furse 
Swann, Tim Laycock and Phil Humphries, the Hardy Society, New Hardy Players and 
theArtsreach <http://www.artsreach.co.uk/> rural touring organisation, 
traditional entertainment is alive, kicking and magical here at this time of 
year, and well supported by the public.
