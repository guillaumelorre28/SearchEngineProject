Thank you Hugh, that was fantastic. Really good of you to answer so many 
questions so diligently.


And thanks everyone for asking questions. It’s been really enlightening!

Why do you think that there is an imperative for literature to portray reality 
in unreal ways, such as on The Master and Margarita?

I guess because there are different ways for artists to see reality, some of 
them not realistic - take a look at a gallery of modern art. Artists need to 
have a fresh vision of the world, they can't just go on repeating what has been 
done brilliantly by others for centuries.

Henry Cockburn <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13698594> has a 
question about translating The Master and Margarita:

How did you go about tying up the loose ends of an unfinished novel? Did that 
feel like a similar task to translation or is it a different skill entirely?

That's not something the translator has to do - you just work with what the 
writer left and perhaps point out problems in an introduction or notes. Other 
textual work must be left to the researcher.

tiojo <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3712670> asks:

Why is it that Russian artistic manifestations from the Soviet period, whether 
they are Shostakovich symphonies or Bulgakov novels, are always interpreted 
through a search for hidden political comment? Are Britten or Evelyn Waugh’s 
works subject to the same political scrutiny? Would it not be more interesting 
to see interpretations which put those works into a wider global, social and 
historic context?

I agree entirely, such an approach lessens their impact and reduces the value 
of these great works. But because art has been a mode of political opposition in
Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> for two centuries or more, 
the habit persists.

palfreyman <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2955975> says: 

The more I think about the novel the more I am convinced it was composed in 
three separate parts: First the satire itself; then, as a weighty counterpoint 
to the satire, the Yershalaim sequence; and only finally, when he was married 
for the third time, I believe, did Bulgakov try to put a bit of hope into it by 
fictionalising his relationship with his wife as that of the Master and 
Margarita’s.

Did you notice such a distinction in the original Russian when you were 
translating it?

The satirical, demonic and historical parts were all there from 1929, whereas 
Margarita appears in redactions only around 1934, after the third marriage in 
late 1932 - so halfway through the work's genesis and halfway through the book 
too. So I think you have a good point. Differences between the Moscow and 
Yershalaim sections are also dependent, of course, upon the fact that they have 
different narrators - the Master is much less chatty and knowing than the 
narrator of the Moscow scenes.

One thing I learned from studying New Testament Greek (I certainly didn’t 
learn New Testament Greek!) is how complicated translation can be between very 
different languages, especially where there is less direct shared history than 
there is, say, between English and French. There is also the theory that 
concepts come from language, rather than language from concepts. To what extent 
do you think it is really possible to translate Russian literature into 
English, rather than produce an English-language interpretation of the work?

I think your alternatives are basically the same thing, as I've suggested 
elsewhere in this discussion. The shared Indo-European linguistic source of 
English and Russian means they intersect quite readily, and much of the 
European culture is shared, of course. Realia are always a problem for 
translators, but footnotes help out. Nuances and connotations are always going 
to be lost in translation, so one just has to do one's best.

Do you think that The Master and Margarita pursues themes common in Russian 
Literature? And is the ‘surrealism’ of TMAM something often found in Russian 
lit?

I see you translated The Double, a work I’ve found very compelling- how 
influential is this novella re other European works about repressed or ghost 
selves, or doppelgängers? About Dostoyevsky’s influence - how much was 
Nietzsche influenced by him? Was there a mutual influence?

It certainly does. One not mentioned in these discussions as far as I can see 
is that of the 'strong woman' contrasted with the weak male to be found in a 
lot of, say, Turgenev and Chekhov. Moral responsibility, the strong 
philosophical/spiritual strand in TMAM are things to be found in, say, Tolstoy 
and Dostoevsky, and the grotesque/bizarre is something that Bulgakov admired in 
Gogol. I'm not sure about the influence of The Double: it was itself produced 
after reading of Hoffmann and Gogol, so I don't know where the lines of 
influence on other writers should be drawn (Dorian Grey, for example, could be 
linked with Gogol's Portrait). Nietzsche was an admirer of Dostoevsky and Notes 
From the Underground and Crime and Punishment influenced him, it would seem - 
I'm not aware of any influence the other way (Nietzsche was quite a bit 
younger, of course).

Who is your favourite author to translate - and why? And has translating an 
book ever changed your opinion of it, making you admire it more or less?

Probably the one I'm translating at any given moment: you have to enjoy 
literary translation to do it, and it is a great pleasure for me to engage that 
closely with any (good) text. I've been lucky enough to translate some truly 
great Russian writers, so it would be invidious to single out just one. And 
translating a book makes you know it better and usually became more fond of it: 
usually, because translating Dostoevsky's The Double was pretty gruelling - 
it's a wonderful creation, but it was hard work!

'You could argue that when you read a book in translation, you're only 
experiencing a version of the original'

palfreyman <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2955975> says:

I have just finished Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky’s Penguin 
translation of The Master and Margarita and thoroughly enjoyed it without 
concluding it was a masterpiece. Given, however, that it is the general 
consensus that the novel IS a masterpiece, do you think the translation I read 
might have something to do with my less than fervent admiration?

You could argue that whenever you read a book in translation, you're only 
experiencing a version of the original, not the actual book (but if it's a good 
book in the original, then reading that version is obviously better than 
missing out on the book entirely). I don't really like getting involved in 
discussion of other translators' works, because we all read and therefore 
rewrite the original differently; and my reading is obviously going to be the 
one I personally prefer! I know the Burgin/O'Connor version is highly rated, 
and I would advise against the Glenny: it served its purpose well in 
introducing readers to Bulgakov, but it has far too many howlers for comfort, 
many of which distort the work to a degree that makes some passages 
incomprehensible (Bezdomny describes his poetry as 'monstrous', not 
'wonderful', for example). Another thing to bear in mind is whether the 
translator into English is British or American - it can make quite a difference!

He came from a family of clergymen and obviously had a broad and deep 
knowledge of religious traditions. Theses have been written on the religious 
themes in his works, so I think 'yes' would be a reasonable answer.

SergeyL <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16098786> has some thoughts 
about the cover of the Alma edition of The Master and Margarita:

I don’t think that outline of the book cover in the style of early Soviet 
posters is a fitting match for Bulgakov novels. Bulgakov disliked such style 
which reminds more of Mayakovsky (and they hated each other).

In Russian literature and theater Bulgakov stands for the conservative classic 
style despite his early experiments (Diaboliade).

If you're referring to the current Alma edition cover, you may be right, 
commenting from an obviously informed standpoint, but it is an effective, 
striking cover, I think, and 'fits in' with a number of their other covers. 
Covers are a whole area of discussion, I think, and I've seen none more 
beautiful than the Hesperus editions from the Noughties, which included a 
couple of my other Bulgakov translations.

'Even the simplest bit of Russian will inevitably be rendered differently by 
every translator'

retropian <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13652838> has a general 
question about Dostoyevsky translations:

I would like to explore more in depth the works of Dostoyevsky particularly, 
and am wondering if I can get some recommendations for translations. 
Recommendations for other Russian authors would be appreciated as well.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16379700> Guardian contributor 
HughAplin  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16379700> 29 June 2016 
1:29pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/77719187> 
Judgements on the relative merits of translators and specific translations are 
very subjective. The translations themselves are, of course, subjective too - 
each translator has his or her own understanding of a text, which is why even 
the simplest little bit of Russian will almost inevitably be rendered 
differently by everyone who translates it (strange, but true). There are, 
however, good and bad translations, I think, in that a bad translator can 
simply misunderstand the source text and thus produce an incorrect version in 
the target language. The occasional error of this sort is, I would suggest, 
acceptable (and perhaps even unavoidable), but if the errors are persistent and 
significant, the resultant translation must surely be considered bad. I expect 
that is probably not very helpful; especially as many reviewers, whose 
recommendations might be thought helpful, are actually unable to judge the 
accuracy of what they read and therefore just praise what they like, which may, 
according to my definition, be bad! Where Russian translations are concerned, 
modern translations are often to be preferred, as there has been greater 
contact between the Anglophone and Russophone worlds in recent decades, so 
translators are perhaps more likely to be reliable than in the past (and the 
resources of the Internet are a tremendous boon for contemporary translators). 
But many still insist on the quality of Constance Garnett's contemporary 
translations of Chekhov. I think you have to try different versions and see. 
Other Russian authors? I love the earliest great Russian prose writers - 
Pushkin, Gogol and Lermontov, and they're a great place to start, as you can 
then see where Dostoevsky found a good deal of his inspiration.

names:

Why does everyone have three names, one of which seems to be randomly used 
later in the text? Are there rules about using first, middle and second names 
and are there hidden meanings in the character names that I’m missing because I 
don’t speak Russian?

The names are commonly a problem for Anglophone readers of Russian literature. 
Russians have a first (given) name, a patronymic derived from their father's 
first name and a surname. The standard formal mode of address is to use the 
first two, but Russians can be referred to by any one of the three. The 
patronymic can be shortened (e.g. Nikolayevich becomes Nikolayich) and the 
first name can be altered in all sorts of ways to indicate familiarity, 
affection, contempt: thus Ekaterina becomes Katya, Katyusha, Katenka, Katka 
etc. Many writers do use 'meaningful' names, and a translation with footnotes 
would probably seek to explain those that would escape a reader with no Russian.

Thank you Hugh, that was fantastic. Really good of you to answer so many

And thanks everyone for asking questions. It’s been really enlightening!

Why do you think that there is an imperative for literature to portray reality 
in unreal ways, such as on The Master and Margarita?

I guess because there are different ways for artists to see reality, some of 
them not realistic - take a look at a gallery of modern art. Artists need to 
have a fresh vision of the world, they can't just go on repeating what has been 
done brilliantly by others for centuries.
 
Henry Cockburn <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13698594> has a 
question about translating The Master and Margarita:

How did you go about tying up the loose ends of an unfinished novel? Did that 
feel like a similar task to translation or is it a different skill entirely?

That's not something the translator has to do - you just work with what the 
writer left and perhaps point out problems in an introduction or notes. Other 
textual work must be left to the researcher.
 
tiojo <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3712670> asks:

Why is it that Russian artistic manifestations from the Soviet period, whether 
they are Shostakovich symphonies or Bulgakov novels, are always interpreted 
through a search for hidden political comment? Are Britten or Evelyn Waugh’s 
works subject to the same political scrutiny? Would it not be more interesting 
to see interpretations which put those works into a wider global, social and 
historic context?

2:03pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/77723823> 
I agree entirely, such an approach lessens their impact and reduces the value 
of these great works. But because art has been a mode of political opposition in
Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> for two centuries or more, 
the habit persists.
 
palfreyman <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2955975> says: 

The more I think about the novel the more I am convinced it was composed in 
three separate parts: First the satire itself; then, as a weighty counterpoint 
to the satire, the Yershalaim sequence; and only finally, when he was married 
for the third time, I believe, did Bulgakov try to put a bit of hope into it by 
fictionalising his relationship with his wife as that of the Master and 
Margarita’s.

Did you notice such a distinction in the original Russian when you were 
translating it?

2:01pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/77723616> 
The satirical, demonic and historical parts were all there from 1929, whereas 
Margarita appears in redactions only around 1934, after the third marriage in 
late 1932 - so halfway through the work's genesis and halfway through the book 
too. So I think you have a good point. Differences between the Moscow and 
Yershalaim sections are also dependent, of course, upon the fact that they have 
different narrators - the Master is much less chatty and knowing than the 
narrator of the Moscow scenes.
 
miapatrick <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3941714> says:

One thing I learned from studying New Testament Greek (I certainly didn’t 
learn New Testament Greek!) is how complicated translation can be between very 
different languages, especially where there is less direct shared history than 
there is, say, between English and French. There is also the theory that 
concepts come from language, rather than language from concepts. To what extent 
do you think it is really possible to translate Russian literature into 
English, rather than produce an English-language interpretation of the work?

I think your alternatives are basically the same thing, as I've suggested 
elsewhere in this discussion. The shared Indo-European linguistic source of 
English and Russian means they intersect quite readily, and much of the 
European culture is shared, of course. Realia are always a problem for 
translators, but footnotes help out. Nuances and connotations are always going 
to be lost in translation, so one just has to do one's best.
 
RabBurnout <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4547976> asks:

Do you think that The Master and Margarita pursues themes common in Russian 
Literature? And is the ‘surrealism’ of TMAM something often found in Russian 
lit?

I see you translated The Double, a work I’ve found very compelling- how 
influential is this novella re other European works about repressed or ghost 
selves, or doppelgängers? About Dostoyevsky’s influence - how much was 
Nietzsche influenced by him? Was there a mutual influence?

It certainly does. One not mentioned in these discussions as far as I can see 
is that of the 'strong woman' contrasted with the weak male to be found in a 
lot of, say, Turgenev and Chekhov. Moral responsibility, the strong 
philosophical/spiritual strand in TMAM are things to be found in, say, Tolstoy 
and Dostoevsky, and the grotesque/bizarre is something that Bulgakov admired in 
Gogol. I'm not sure about the influence of The Double: it was itself produced 
after reading of Hoffmann and Gogol, so I don't know where the lines of 
influence on other writers should be drawn (Dorian Grey, for example, could be 
linked with Gogol's Portrait). Nietzsche was an admirer of Dostoevsky and Notes 
From the Underground and Crime and Punishment influenced him, it would seem - 
I'm not aware of any influence the other way (Nietzsche was quite a bit 
younger, of course).

Probably the one I'm translating at any given moment: you have to enjoy 
literary translation to do it, and it is a great pleasure for me to engage that 
closely with any (good) text. I've been lucky enough to translate some truly 
great Russian writers, so it would be invidious to single out just one. And 
translating a book makes you know it better and usually became more fond of it: 
usually, because translating Dostoevsky's The Double was pretty gruelling - 
it's a wonderful creation, but it was hard work!

I have just finished Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky’s Penguin

You could argue that whenever you read a book in translation, you're only 
experiencing a version of the original, not the actual book (but if it's a good 
book in the original, then reading that version is obviously better than 
missing out on the book entirely). I don't really like getting involved in 
discussion of other translators' works, because we all read and therefore 
rewrite the original differently; and my reading is obviously going to be the 
one I personally prefer! I know the Burgin/O'Connor version is highly rated, 
and I would advise against the Glenny: it served its purpose well in 
introducing readers to Bulgakov, but it has far too many howlers for comfort, 
many of which distort the work to a degree that makes some passages 
incomprehensible (Bezdomny describes his poetry as 'monstrous', not 
'wonderful', for example). Another thing to bear in mind is whether the 
translator into English is British or American - it can make quite a difference!

He came from a family of clergymen and obviously had a broad and deep 
knowledge of religious traditions. Theses have been written on the religious 
themes in his works, so I think 'yes' would be a reasonable answer.
 
SergeyL <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16098786> has some thoughts 
about the cover of the Alma edition of The Master and Margarita:

I don’t think that outline of the book cover in the style of early Soviet 
posters is a fitting match for Bulgakov novels. Bulgakov disliked such style 
which reminds more of Mayakovsky (and they hated each other).

In Russian literature and theater Bulgakov stands for the conservative classic 
style despite his early experiments (Diaboliade).

If you're referring to the current Alma edition cover, you may be right, 
commenting from an obviously informed standpoint, but it is an effective, 
striking cover, I think, and 'fits in' with a number of their other covers. 
Covers are a whole area of discussion, I think, and I've seen none more 
beautiful than the Hesperus editions from the Noughties, which included a 
couple of my other Bulgakov translations.

Judgements on the relative merits of translators and specific translations are 
very subjective. The translations themselves are, of course, subjective too - 
each translator has his or her own understanding of a text, which is why even 
the simplest little bit of Russian will almost inevitably be rendered 
differently by everyone who translates it (strange, but true). There are, 
however, good and bad translations, I think, in that a bad translator can 
simply misunderstand the source text and thus produce an incorrect version in 
the target language. The occasional error of this sort is, I would suggest, 
acceptable (and perhaps even unavoidable), but if the errors are persistent and 
significant, the resultant translation must surely be considered bad. I expect 
that is probably not very helpful; especially as many reviewers, whose 
recommendations might be thought helpful, are actually unable to judge the 
accuracy of what they read and therefore just praise what they like, which may, 
according to my definition, be bad! Where Russian translations are concerned, 
modern translations are often to be preferred, as there has been greater 
contact between the Anglophone and Russophone worlds in recent decades, so 
translators are perhaps more likely to be reliable than in the past (and the 
resources of the Internet are a tremendous boon for contemporary translators). 
But many still insist on the quality of Constance Garnett's contemporary 
translations of Chekhov. I think you have to try different versions and see. 
Other Russian authors? I love the earliest great Russian prose writers - 
Pushkin, Gogol and Lermontov, and they're a great place to start, as you can 
then see where Dostoevsky found a good deal of his inspiration.
