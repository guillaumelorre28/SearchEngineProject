To paraphrase Monty Python, what has Islam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/islam> ever done for us? You know, apart 
from the algebra, the trigonometry, the optics, the astronomy and the many 
other scientific advances and inventions of the Islamic Golden Age.

Well, if you like art and interiors, there’s always the stunning patterns that 
grace mosques, madrasas and palaces around the world.

Islamic craftsmen and artists – who were prohibited from making 
representations of people in holy sites – developed an instantly recognizable 
aesthetic based on repeated geometrical shapes.

The mathematical elegance of these designs is that no matter how elaborate 
they are, they are always based on grids constructed using only a ruler and a 
pair of compasses.

Islamic design is based on Greek geometry, which teaches us that starting with 
very basic assumptions, we can build up a remarkable number of proofs about 
shapes. Islamic patterns provide a visual confirmation of the complexity that 
can be achieved with such simple tools.

Dust off your old geometry set, and let’s see how.

The template has a circle in a square, divided into 12 equal sections. (We 
could have got this using a compass, but let’s assume you know how to do this). 
Put the compass point on each corner of the square to draw the first four 
quarter-circles.

Follow the steps: add a small circle then eight line segments.

When it gets tricky it can help to mark the intersections before you draw the 
line.

Beginning to take shape now. I tried this at home and it was really fun but 
quite fiddly - and made me respect the skills of the craftsmen of a thousand 
years ago, who didn’t have retractible pencils, endless sheets of high quality 
paper or computer printers.

The step by step guide above was made by Eric Broug, one of the most active 
practitioners of Islamic geometric design working today.

Eric is a Dutchman who lives in Halifax, West Yorkshire. 

“Geometry is really a universal language, everyone can – and does – relate to 
it instinctively,” he says. “There is a joy to be had in starting with a blank 
piece of paper and to draw lines and circles and end up with a pattern that is 
recognizable and beautiful. This process connects you very directly to a design 
heritage.”

 The basic principle behind Islamic design: you draw a grid using ruler and 
compass, draw the pattern on top and then remove the grid. 
Islamic geometric design mixes elements of maths, art and history. Trying to 
decipher the steps that led to finished patterns is like a mathematical puzzle. 
Constructing new pieces involves creativity mixed with an understanding of the 
various styles and embellishments the ancients used.

So how did a Christian Dutchman end up an international ambassador for Islamic 
design? Eric, aged 48, was in his 20s studying Middle Eastern politics at 
university in Amsterdam when, by chance, he found a book on the subject in a 
local bookstore. He was hooked. In 2000 he moved to London to study Islamic 
design at the Prince’s School for Traditional Arts. He later took an MA in the 
History of Islamic Art and Architecture at the School of Oriental and African 
Studies (SOAS).

Eric has a full-time job at an academic publisher, but in his spare time 
writes books, gives talks and workshops and runs an atelier in Halifax that 
designs bespoke screens, logos and other work for clients around the world.
 Eric Broug takes a selfie at the Bou Inania Madrasa in Fez, Morocco. 
About half of his clients are Muslim. Do they find it odd that he isn’t? “In 
the 20 years I have been practising Islamic geometric design, I have been asked 
maybe once or twice whether I was a Muslim. It’s a non-issue. Human beings like 
beautiful things. I want to engage with people and show them the beauty and 
design techniques involved in making these patterns.”

“My desire is to popularize this tradition – to make it accessible to anyone 
who can draw a line and a circle,” he says.

 A screen hand-made from oak, installed in a house in the US. 
Eric’s screens are made from steel, wood or Perspex. “The first screen I ever 
manufactured was for an American lady in Nebraska. I don’t treat Islamic 
geometric patterns as universal or generic. So, for example, a client who wants 
screens for a Turkish restaurant, will be best served with geometric patterns 
from the Seljuk or Ottoman era. It wouldn’t make sense to use Moroccan patterns 
in the decor of a Turkish restaurant, after all!”

Absolutely. It might put you off your kebab.

Eric hopes that his research and outreach work will breath life into future of 
Islamic geometric design. “If we can identify and define what is excellent in 
the past eight to ten centuries, we can start to come up with an educational 
strategy to revitalize it in the 21st century so that it once again is a 
creative realm where innovation pervades. Currently, there is almost only 
replication of patterns, very little innovation.”

The following patterns show how a pattern of overlapping hexagons can become a 
dodecagons.

“What I love about these four patterns is that they show the creative thought 
process of a craftsman,” he says. “He might have asked himself: ‘What if I 
change these hexagons into dodecagons, I wonder what pattern I might create?’”

The most interesting patterns mathematically are those based around pentagons, 
such as the one below, since pentagons cannot be tiled repeatedly to fill the 
plain in the way that hexagons, squares and triangles can.
 A fivefold pattern. 
Here’s a watercolour Eric made with heptagons, a variation on a detail from a 
Mamluk minbar in Cairo. “I love this design because it looks so contemporary 
and bold even though it was designed in the 15th century.” If Eric started to 
offer a tattoo service, I’m sure this design would do well.
