A South Armagh republican once named in court as a senior IRA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ira> commander is facing charges in Dublin of 
tax evasion.

Thomas “Slab” Murphy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/08/northernireland.uk1> stands 
accused in the Irish Republic’s non-jury special criminal court of nine charges 
of failing to put in tax returns from 1996 to 2004.

If found guilty, Murphy could face up to five years in jail after a trial 
expected to last up to three weeks. The 66-year-old denies all the charges 
against him.

Murphy lost a libel appeal in a Dublin court in 1998 after the Sunday Times 
had identified him as directing the IRA’s bombing campaign in Britain as well 
as helping toimport tonnes of weapons from Libya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/19/uk.northernireland1> during 
the 1980s.

According to a subsequent BBC underworld rich list investigation, the South 
Armagh farmer was estimated to control a fortune worth £40m, earned through 
smuggling diesel, cigarettes, grain and pigs.

Murphy has never denied being a republican and has said he supports the peace 
process.

The IRA’s South Armagh Brigade, which numerous books and documentaries have 
alleged Murphy commands, has been loyal to the mainstream republican leadership.

After police and customs officials raided his properties straddling the Irish 
border in 2006, Sinn Féin’s president,Gerry Adams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gerryadams>, defended him, stating: “Tom 
Murphy is not a criminal. He’s a good republican.”

Earlier this year Murphy’s legal team lost a battle to have his case heard in 
a normal jury-based court in Ireland.
