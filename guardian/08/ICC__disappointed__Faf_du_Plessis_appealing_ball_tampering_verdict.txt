International Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Council 
chief executive David Richardson has outlined his disappointment at Faf du 
Plessis’ decision to appeal a fine for ball tampering. Richardson spoke to 
reporters in Adelaide on Friday, attempting to clarify the laws governing the 
use of mints to help shine the ball.

“The ICC is disappointed that Faf du Plessis has chosen not to accept the 
findings of match referee Andy Pycroft and will instead exercise his right to 
appeal,” Richardson said. “A judicial commissioner will now be appointed to 
hear the appeal at the earliest opportunity.”

Richardson added the laws of cricket clearly state “a player should not use 
artificial substances to shine the ball”.

“The ICC understands that to include, but is not limited to, sunscreen, lip 
ice and residue from sweets,” he said. “The ICC does not wish to prevent 
players from using these substances for legitimate purposes, however, any 
deliberate attempt to apply such substances to the ball, as was the case here, 
will not be acceptable.”

Du Plessis was fine 100 per cent of his match fee, approximately $2500, after 
footage emerged from the second Test of South Africa’s skipper applying saliva 
to the ball with a mint in his mouth. “Following the appeal we will review the 
matter along with our members and the MCC to see if there are any learnings to 
be taken from this issue,” Richardson said.

Du Plessis posted an unbeaten century on day one of the ongoing day-night Test 
at Adelaide Oval, where he was booed by some locals when reaching three figures.
