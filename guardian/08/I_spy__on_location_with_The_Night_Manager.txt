With sex, action and opulent settings, spy drama The Night Manager 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-night-manager> has been a hit for 
the BBC: it cost around £3m per episode, but each one has pulled in some eight 
million viewers. Danish director Susanne Bier said in a Radio Times interview: 
“It was deliberate to make it very sexy. The story takes place in a very lavish 
world – the world of Richard Roper – and part of the excitement is that 
Jonathan Pine, and the audience, get sucked into this world.”

Based on John le Carré’s 1993 novel about an arms dealer, adapted and updated 
to be based on the Arab spring, the plot in brief is that former British 
soldier Jonathan Pine (Tom Hiddleston) is recruited by intelligence officer 
Angela Burr (Olivia Colman) to get inside the inner circle of arms dealer 
Richard Roper (Hugh Laurie). From there, it all gets very shadowy.

But the glamorous locations in which the murky plot plays out are manna for 
setjetters. And the travel industry has been quick to take advantage, with 
companies including Tripadvisor’sVacation Rentals 
<https://www.tripadvisor.com/Rentals> promoting stays in towns viewers will 
have gazed at in the show. The drama draws to a close this weekend, so fans in 
the early stages of withdrawal can plan to follow in the footsteps of the 
show’s stars – from Mallorca to Marrakech and the Matterhorn.

 Es Saadi riad, Marrakech, stands in for Cairo’s Nefertiti Hotel. 
Like the plot of The Night Manager, the filming featured all sorts of 
subterfuge. Cairo wasn’t visited at all and instead, the Es Saadi riad in 
Marrakech plays the Egyptian hotel (the Nefertiti), where Pine is night manager 
and outside which demonstrations kick off in episode one. The riad is 
overlooked by the Atlas mountains and set in 20 acres of gardens, with pool, 
spa and hammam. Morocco is always popular with filmmakers because of tax breaks 
and the fact that it can “portray” any number of locations – it even doubled 
for Tehran in Homeland. Rooms in April can cost up to £200 – but those without 
Roper’s cash can pop into the bar for a mint tea.

 Matterhorn views from Riffelalp Resort, Zermatt 
Jonathan Pine is working in another luxurious hotel, in Zermatt, when he first 
meets Roper. Meisters Hotel doesn’t exist, but the views of the Matterhorn were 
filmed at the famous Riffelalp Resort 2222, which is named for its altitude and 
can only be reached by theGornegrat railway 
<https://www.gornergratbahn.ch/en/winter/>. Cosy wood-panelled rooms with giant 
TVs don’t come cheap here – a two-night weekend in April comes in just shy of 
£990. But the views, as they say, are priceless – and free, if you just want to 
come up for a wander around.

Photograph: Alamy 
Pine leaves Roper’s mansion for a trip out with Roper’s son, Daniel, and takes 
the opportunity to have a clandestine meeting with Burr. The street where Pine 
and Burr meet is Carrer de la Marina, the corniche that runs along the sea 
front in Port de Soller. This postcard-perfect port town is in the north of 
Mallorca and, if you squint, you might see Roman Abramovich’s yacht moored off 
the coast because the area has been colonised by the super rich. Never mind. 
Grab an ice-cream at an outdoor table at Domenico, a little pizza parlour at 
number 44, that also does great gelato. Apparently, the orange flavour is not 
to be missed.

Fishy goings on are ten a penny in The Night Manager, but possibly the 
fishiest of all is the dinner that evil arms dealer Richard Roper hosts for his 
overblown entourage at the Ca’s Patró March restaurant in Cala Deià, northern 
Mallorca. This restaurant – serving grilled seafood platters and Mallorcan Nou 
Nat chardonnay – is on a cliff above a small cove and likes to attract the
cognoscenti – which is why you won’t find a website.

 Sea views from Maricel Hotel and Spa. 
The terrace where Roper and one of his inner circle, Sandy Langbourne, talk 
dirty deeds is played by the luxurious Maricel Hotel and Spa – “one of the most 
emblematic and prestigious hotels on the island”, according to its website, with
belle époque interiors, and an excellent bar. Thursday night is jazz night, so 
non-residents can pop in for a cocktail (about £8). It is in Calvià, just south 
west of Palma – follow the signs for Magaluf, basically, but if you hit Del

Iglesia de Santa Eulalia, Palma


The church where Burr quizzes lawyer Juan Apostol (Antonio de la Torre) is 
supposed to be in Madrid but is in fact the Gothic bulk of Iglesia de Santa 
Eulalia in Palma, whose architecture is as typically Spanish as a plate of 
garlic prawns. The 13th-century church, with tall spire and huge windows, was 
massively restored in the 1800s. The square outside – and the building – are 
free to look round. Walk south from Palma’s main square, Plaça Major.

Doinet 
The place where Pine gets steamy with Roper’s girlfriend Jed Marshall 
(Elizabeth Debicki) is the Son Julia Hotel near Llucmajor, south-east of Palma. 
Dating from the 15th century, with Arabian gardens, it has had a recent 
makeover with handmade carpets and local art. There’s a terrace with a grill 
and no fewer than three pools. This hotel also doubles for one that’s supposed 
to be in Istanbul in the scene where Pine talks to Rob Singhal (Adeel Akhtar). 
Enjoy a couple of G&Ts in the bar for under a tenner.

You don’t have to go too far to scope out locations from The Night Manager. 
Some filming took place in London. Parts of the show were shot by the Thames on 
Millbank in Pimlico, where Burr and Joel Steadman discuss hoodwinking MI6 to 
protect Pine. The neo-classicalVictoria House 
<http://www.victoriahousewc1.co.uk/> on Bloomsbury Square in central London, 
was decked out to look like the Foreign Office, and another location was the
Blue Fin Building <http://bluefinvenue.co.uk/contact/> in Southwark Street, 
south London – whose interiors doubled for MI6’s HQ in Vauxhall. The Blue Fin 
is actually full of journalists working for Time Inc magazines, such as Marie 
Claire and NME. There’s a cafe on the ground floor of this building where 
anyone can grab a cup of tea.
