As a busy junior doctor with many demands on his time, Dr Erwan Elias knows 
what he wants from his IT: it has to be clean, easy to use and tailored to his 
needs – and it has to work.

So he’s delighted to have been involved in testing Turas, a new digital 
platform that is transforming learning not just for his medical colleagues, but 
for all NHS staff in Scotland and potentially beyond.

Turas (Scots Gaelic for journey) is a learning management application for NHS 
Education for Scotland (NES), a special health board that delivers education, 
training and workforce development for those who work in and with the NHS in 
Scotland.

Unusually for major IT projects, it was developed in-house by NES staff using 
Agile methodology <http://agilemethodology.org/> and co-created with constant 
input from users such as Elias. It is cloud-based, and allows users to manage 
their education portfolios, participate in online learning, and browse courses, 
resources and news from any device, at any time, wherever they are.

Although Turas was developed for and by the Scottish health board, it is 
already attracting attention across boundaries, both sectoral and geographical, 
with interest from both social care and health bodies elsewhere in the UK.

The vision of NES is to provide quality education for a healthier Scotland – 
and Turas is at the heart of that, says Christopher Wroath, NES director of 
digital transformation, who previously worked at the Cabinet Office.

“When I joined NES, the IT wasn’t really fit for purpose,” he says. “It was 
very siloed, with different systems for different departments – some of these 
systems were very good, but they were all separate and there was no overarching 
technical leadership.

“NES didn’t have more money than any other organisations, so we had to look at 
what we could do with limited resources. We had a lot of talent and the view 
was: why shouldn’t we do it ourselves?”

Turas is essentially a single platform that has been designed to deliver a 
suite of training, learning and professional development applications, such as 
the portfolios used by doctors and dentists in training. Five – including the 
portfolio used by Elias – are already live.

 Turas will push content to meet people’s individual needs. 
But Wroath is most excited about Turas Learn, due to start operating by the 
end of this year. “Turas Learn is an all-NHS training record,” he says. “It can 
be accessed by staff and management, and will allow us to start building up a 
record of training and development for those who are part of the NHS.”

The system will use big data principles to allow NES to see how, when and 
where people choose to access education, and will be able to push content to 
meet people’s individual needs – whether they are a porter, surgeon or 
administrator.

“We’re not mandating Turas Learn, but we’re confident that people will use 
it,” says Wroath. “We also want to find out about the barriers people face when 
they want to learn, so that we can make education and development available to 
everyone who wants it.”

Senior management buy-in has been essential, says Wroath, adding that the 
technology is being made available free of charge to other NHS Scotland 
organisations.

It’s clean​ and easy to use. It’s a very helpful way to keep track of 
everything we’re doing.

“The chief executive, Caroline Lamb, has been beyond supportive; in fact it 
was all her idea. She was the one who wanted a digital transformation and she 
has driven it forward all the way.”

User-involvement has also been crucial, he adds. Elias, a second year 
foundation doctor currently working in general surgery at Aberdeen royal 
infirmary, believes the new system is a great improvement on its predecessor.

“It’s cleaner and easier to use,” he says. “It’s a very helpful way to keep 
track of everything we’re doing: our reading, learning, reflection and 
achievements – extra-curricular achievements as well as those to do with work.”

He finds Turas makes it easier to keep on top of outstanding requirements, 
such as supervised teaching sessions, as well as showing him what he has 
already done.

“There are so many things going on when you’re a junior doctor and it’s really 
helpful to have it all in one place. We can even print out relevant pages to 
use as part of our paper portfolio.”

He particularly likes the system’s emphasis on reflecting on practice and says 
he hopes this will be good preparation if, as he hopes, he goes on to train in 
general practice in Scotland. He and his colleagues were also hugely 
appreciative of the opportunity to be involved in testing the new system and to 
make suggestions for improvements.

“Quite a few of us as junior doctors feel that the portfolio is an additional 
thing to do, aside from our usual working commitments. Understandably we get 
frustrated when it doesn’t work as it should. So it’s been great that we’ve 
been able to help make it work as well as it can because we all benefit from 
that.”
