Declaration of Independence, the nation’s first black president urged American 
citizens to send the first woman to the White House in their 240-year history.

“I’m asking you to vote for this woman, this mother, this grandmother, to be 
the next president of the United States,” Barack Obama said, introducingHillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> to tens of 
thousands of people who braved a chilly Monday night in Philadelphia.

Joining him were the first lady, Michelle Obama, former president Bill Clinton 
and Chelsea Clinton, a formidable show of force for one of Clinton’s final acts 
as Democratic candidate. Music legends Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi 
served as warmup acts.

It was the largest event of Clinton’s 18-month campaign, drawing 33,000 people 
to the square. The city’s legacy, and the hope of creating history once more, 
dominated the evening’s remarks.

“Philadelphia, in this place where our founders forged the documents of 
freedom, in this place where they gave us the tools to perfect our union, if 
you share my faith then I ask you to vote,” Obama said.

His voice reverberated to the surrounding streets from speakers positioned for 
the thousands who could not gain entry but looked on from outside. All told, an 
estimated 40,000 had descended upon the area hoping to bear witness to the 
climax of a gruelling election cycle.

The mood fluctuated from euphoric to meditative, at times urgent and emotional 
at the next turn.

Springsteen, whose music has long been inspired by the working class, soothed 
the crowd with performances of Thunder Road and Dancing in the Dark. Between 
songs, the singer declared that the choice before them “couldn’t be more clear”.


“Let’s all do our part so we can look back on 2016 and say we stood with 
Hillary Clinton on the right side of history,” Springsteen said.

Characterising Trump as “a man whose vision is limited to little beyond 
himself”, Springsteen said the Republican nominee held a “profound lack of 
decency that would allow him to prioritise his own interests and ego before 
American democracy itself”.

“Tomorrow those ideas and that campaign are going down.”

But it was the Obamas who captivated the audience with a pair of soaring 
speeches, delivered before the American electorate on what was likely their 
final national stage. Michelle Obama, who emerged unexpectedly as Clinton’s 
most powerful surrogate, implored voters to grasp that presidential elections 
were “breathtakingly close”.


“Tomorrow, with your vote, you can stand up to those who seek to divide us, 
make us afraid,” the first lady said. “Tomorrow, with your vote, you can say 
that this country has always been great, that it is the greatest nation on 
Earth.”


Mounting the podium after his wife, Barack Obama echoed the unwavering 
optimism that twice propelled him to the highest office in the land. “In 2008, 
you gave me a chance – a skinny guy with a funny name,” the president said. 
“You bet on me all those years ago, and I will always be grateful for the 
privilege you gave me to serve.”

“But I’ll be honest with you,” he added. “I’ve always had the better odds 
because I’ve always bet on you. And America, I’m betting on you one more time.”


It was a tough act for Clinton to follow, but such has often been the case for 
a candidate held to standards that were never imposed upon her male 
predecessors. For much of her public life, Clinton has faced criticisms ranging 
from her smile to the cadence in her voice.


But it was unmistakably Clinton’s night. Mounting the podium, she threw up her 
arms and looked to the skies.

She had one final rally to attend, 400 miles away in the battleground of North 
Carolina. Clinton would be joined there by Lady Gaga, and Jon Bon Jovi once 
more, capping off the campaign that launched in April of 2015 with one last 
salvo.

But as Clinton stepped on stage in Philadelphia, she had inched one step 
closer to cementing her place in history. To the jubilant supporters savouring 
the moment, she cautioned them that her fate remained in their hands.

“None of us, none of us,” Clinton said, “want to wake up on Wednesday morning 
and wish we had done more.”
