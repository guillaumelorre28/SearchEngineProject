Every once in a while we get restless feet, put on our rucksacks and 
escape the city. One trip that has always stayed with us was a walk along the 
Jurassic coastline past Durdle Door, in Dorset. Following the well-marked 
coastal path fromWeymouth 
<http://www.visit-dorset.com/about-the-area/areas-to-visit/weymouth-and-portland>
, accompanied by glorious weather and breathtaking views, we started east along 
the beach and reached the Smugglers Inn, a charming pub in Osmington Mills 
<http://smugglersinnosmingtonmills.co.uk/>, moments from the coast line.

We then continued along the dramatic white chalk cliffs. Along the way, you 
can see the effect of constant erosion and landslips, resulting in steep 
cliffs, interesting rock formations, and at times, damaged paths. After the 
Durdle Door rock formation, we reached Lulworth Cove, where we stopped at the
Lulworth Cove Inn <http://lulworth-coveinn.co.uk/> for a refreshing pint of the 
Badger brewery’s Applewood cider.
