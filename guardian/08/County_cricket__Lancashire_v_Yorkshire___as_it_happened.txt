Hampshire have completed a crucial win over Notts at the bottom of Division 
One, with seamer Brad Wheal taking six wickets, while Surrey have done likewise 
against Warwickshire at Edgbaston.

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are 188-0 after 51 
overs, needing 180 more from a minimum of 20 overs. Are they going to get 
themselves in the mood for Finals Day on Saturday?

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> don’t seem to be going 
for this target. They have stalled immediately after tea, scoring only 15 runs 
in five overs. They are usually ultra-positive, and this approach is a major 
surprise given they have 10 wickets in hand and nothing to lose now.

Elsewhere, Notts and Warwickshire are eight down in their respective rearguard 
actions against Hampshire and Surrey.

Alex Lees and Adam Lyth have laid the platform for Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> to have a dart at this 367 
target. They have shared 148 in 41 overs, with a minimum of 30 remaining in the 
match. They need 219 more.

Lees has 86 and reached his second fifty of the match off 55 balls having 
earlier uppercut Nathan Buck for six, while Lyth later followed him to that 
milestone off 113 balls and is unbeaten on 52.

Elsewhere, Notts are six down at Trent Bridge against Hampshire. There was a 
brief time earlier when Notts had a sniff of the win, but not now. They are 
259-6 chasing 468.
Warwickshire are slipping fast at Edgbaston. They are 142-7 against Surrey.

In Division Two, Glamorgan are 193-4 chasing 277 to beat Worcestershire at New 
Road.

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> have upped the ante 
significantly during the last half hour or so, taking their score to 76-0 in 
the 19th over, including 52 not out for Alex Lees.

The left-handed opener has now posted two fifties in the match, and he 
uppercut Nathan Buck for six over point along the way.

They need 291 runs more in a little over 52 overs to win, certainly not out of 
the question.

Notts have steadied against Hampshire at Trent Bridge and are 184-3 thanks in 
the main to a century from formerLancashire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> man Steven Mullaney. They need 
284 more inside 53 overs.

Warwickshire are still five down against Surrey.

Northants have been set 415 to beat Leicestershire in a minimum of 51 overs. 
Not the most aggressive captaincy from Mark Cosgrove!

At New Road, Glamorgan are 135-2 chasing 277 to beat Worcestershire.

It hasn’t been without scare however, with Adam Lyth dropped at gully by

Over at Edgbaston, Warwickshire are 90-5 against Surrey.

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> have reached lunch at 
12-0 from six overs at Emirates Old Trafford, with their target 367 in a 
minimum of 71 overs.

If Lancashire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> are desperate for 
them, we will get a few more overs in given they will bowl loads of spin this 
afternoon. They have even opened with Simon Kerrigan.

Yorkshire at least ended a chastening morning in position fashion through 
openers Alex Lees and Adam Lyth.

Elsewhere, Essex have beaten Derbyshire by an innings and 62 at Derby to take 
a stranglehold on top spot in Division Two.

Leicestershire are 319 runs ahead of Northants at lunch at Northampton, while 
Glamorgan are 87-2 chasing 277 at New Road. Sussex have already polished things 
off against Gloucestershire.

In Division One, Notts are 133-3 against Hampshire at Trent Bridge. They have 
two sessions to hold on for the draw with Brendan Taylor and Steven Mullaney 
together.
And finally, Warwickshire are 72-4 against Surrey at Edgbaston. Forget that 
396 target, they are also batting for the draw.

Here, a positive afternoon for Yorkshire and we may yet have a run chase on 
our hands, although unlikely at this stage.

Lancashire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> have declared, 
leaving Yorkshire 367 to win in a minimum of 73 overs.

Haseeb Hameed finishes with 100 not out, his second ton in the match, making 
him youngest ever Lancastrian to achieve that feat, first for them in Roses 
cricket and only third overall in this fixture.

Warwickshire, meanwhile, are in trouble at 66-4 against Surrey at Edgbaston.

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> have struck three

Lancashire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> are now 181-3, 
leading by 315 with 80 overs left in the day. Smith fell for 87.

Haseeb Hameed, now 82 not out, has 1,012 Championship runs for the season and 
got a huge round of applause from the Old Trafford crowd, including his close 
family.
Elsewhere, Notts and Warwickshire are both three down chasing unlikely targets 
against Hampshire and Surrey respectively.

Fifties for Tom Smith and Haseeb Hameed, the latter’s being his fifth in a row 
in this competition. At 58 not out, the 19-year-old needs only 12 to reach 
1,000 Championship runs this season.

When he gets there, even if it’s not today, he will be Lancashire’s youngest 
ever batsman to achieve that feat, beating Mike Atherton by nearly two years.

Lancashire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> are 141-0 now, 
leading by 275. We have 88 overs remaining in the day. Shot a ball stuff this 
morning with 71 runs coming in nine overs this morning, and Yorkshire already 
have the scouts out on the boundary.

10.44am BST 10:44  <> 

Graham’s first update of the day:

Another glorious, sunny morning at Emirates Old Trafford, where we will be in 
for a humdinger of a final day if there is to be a positive result.

I am 99.9 percent of the way there in ruling a Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> win out, but it wouldn’t amaze me 
if they went after a target given Middlesex’s position of strength at the top 
of Division One following yesterday’s win over Durham inside three days at 
Lord’s.

The smart money would still be on a draw here, but Lancashire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> fancy their chances of a first 
win in seven Championship matches and a first Roses win on this ground since 
2000.

Although the pitch isn’t a minefield yet, Simon Kerrigan believes it could be 
by the afternoon and evening sessions “if the sun bakes it and it crumbles”.

A Red Rose win would banish any lingering fears of relegation and would even 
give them an outside chance of a title push.

Just the three matches taking place in Division One today given that 
aforementioned Middlesex win.

Nottinghamshire are 42-2 overnight chasing 468 at Trent Bridge. We can rule 
out a home win there, but a Hampshire win would throw the cat right amongst the 
pigeons at the bottom.

At Edgbaston, Warwickshire are 2-1 from two overs chasing 396 to beat Surrey. 
If I have my maths right, a Surrey win could see them go third in the division 
if other results go their way.

Into Division Two and to Derby, where leaders Essex need five wickets and 
maybe a few runs to beat Derbyshire and take a significant step towards 
promotion. In reply to 530-9 declared, Derbyshire are 213-5 after being bowled 
out for 165 first time around.

At Northampton, home captain Alex Wakely last night opened their game against 
Leicestershire up by declaring on 397-7 in reply to 519 following Rob Newton’s 
maiden double century. Leicester reached close at 49-0, leading by 171.

Sussex, like Essex, are also close to an important victory - over 
Gloucestershire at Hove. Gloucester lead by only eleven with only two 
second-innings wickets in hand. Chris Jordan is only one wicket away from his 
first five-for of the season.

And finally, it should be a fascinating final day at New Road, where Glamorgan 
are 16-1 chasing 277 to beat Worcestershire, who have recovered well from 
conceding a first-innings lead of 117.

Graham Hardcastle’s report:

Lancashire’s Haseeb Hameed breaks records galore before Yorkshire dig in

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/haseeb-hameed-lancashire-yorkshire-championship-match-report> 
Hampshire have completed a crucial win over Notts at the bottom of Division 
One, with seamer Brad Wheal taking six wickets, while Surrey have done likewise 
against Warwickshire at Edgbaston.

Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> are 188-0 after 51 
overs, needing 180 more from a minimum of 20 overs. Are they going to get 
themselves in the mood for Finals Day on Saturday?

 
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> don’t seem to be going 
for this target. They have stalled immediately after tea, scoring only 15 runs 
in five overs. They are usually ultra-positive, and this approach is a major 
surprise given they have 10 wickets in hand and nothing to lose now.

Elsewhere, Notts and Warwickshire are eight down in their respective rearguard 
actions against Hampshire and Surrey.

 
Alex Lees and Adam Lyth have laid the platform for Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> to have a dart at this 367 
target. They have shared 148 in 41 overs, with a minimum of 30 remaining in the 
match. They need 219 more.

Lees has 86 and reached his second fifty of the match off 55 balls having 
earlier uppercut Nathan Buck for six, while Lyth later followed him to that 
milestone off 113 balls and is unbeaten on 52.

Elsewhere, Notts are six down at Trent Bridge against Hampshire. There was a 
brief time earlier when Notts had a sniff of the win, but not now. They are 
259-6 chasing 468.
Warwickshire are slipping fast at Edgbaston. They are 142-7 against Surrey.

In Division Two, Glamorgan are 193-4 chasing 277 to beat Worcestershire at New 
Road.

 
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> have upped the ante 
significantly during the last half hour or so, taking their score to 76-0 in 
the 19th over, including 52 not out for Alex Lees.

The left-handed opener has now posted two fifties in the match, and he 
uppercut Nathan Buck for six over point along the way.

They need 291 runs more in a little over 52 overs to win, certainly not out of 
the question.

Notts have steadied against Hampshire at Trent Bridge and are 184-3 thanks in 
the main to a century from formerLancashire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> man Steven Mullaney. They need 
284 more inside 53 overs.

Warwickshire are still five down against Surrey.

Northants have been set 415 to beat Leicestershire in a minimum of 51 overs. 
Not the most aggressive captaincy from Mark Cosgrove!

At New Road, Glamorgan are 135-2 chasing 277 to beat Worcestershire.

 
Bright start to the afternoon for Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire>, who have moved to 41-0 in the 
13th over as they face a target of 367 in a minimum of 71. Alex Lees has 32 of 
them.

It hasn’t been without scare however, with Adam Lyth dropped at gully by 
Alviro Petersen off Kyle Jarvis in the first over of the session.

Over at Edgbaston, Warwickshire are 90-5 against Surrey. 

 
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> have reached lunch at 
12-0 from six overs at Emirates Old Trafford, with their target 367 in a 
minimum of 71 overs.

If Lancashire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> are desperate for 
them, we will get a few more overs in given they will bowl loads of spin this 
afternoon. They have even opened with Simon Kerrigan.

Yorkshire at least ended a chastening morning in position fashion through 
openers Alex Lees and Adam Lyth.

Elsewhere, Essex have beaten Derbyshire by an innings and 62 at Derby to take 
a stranglehold on top spot in Division Two.

Leicestershire are 319 runs ahead of Northants at lunch at Northampton, while 
Glamorgan are 87-2 chasing 277 at New Road. Sussex have already polished things 
off against Gloucestershire.

In Division One, Notts are 133-3 against Hampshire at Trent Bridge. They have 
two sessions to hold on for the draw with Brendan Taylor and Steven Mullaney 
together.
And finally, Warwickshire are 72-4 against Surrey at Edgbaston. Forget that 
396 target, they are also batting for the draw.

Here, a positive afternoon for Yorkshire and we may yet have a run chase on 
our hands, although unlikely at this stage.

 
Lancashire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> have declared, 
leaving Yorkshire 367 to win in a minimum of 73 overs.

Haseeb Hameed finishes with 100 not out, his second ton in the match, making 
him youngest ever Lancastrian to achieve that feat, first for them in Roses 
cricket and only third overall in this fixture.

Warwickshire, meanwhile, are in trouble at 66-4 against Surrey at Edgbaston. 

 
Yorkshire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> have struck three 
times in three overs, with Tim Bresnan removing Tom Smith and Steven Croft 
caught behind pulling and uppercutting respectively.

Sandwiched in between, Adil Rashid had Alviro Petersen caught and bowled. 

Lancashire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> are now 181-3, 
leading by 315 with 80 overs left in the day. Smith fell for 87.

Haseeb Hameed, now 82 not out, has 1,012 Championship runs for the season and 
got a huge round of applause from the Old Trafford crowd, including his close 
family.
Elsewhere, Notts and Warwickshire are both three down chasing unlikely targets 
against Hampshire and Surrey respectively.

 
Fifties for Tom Smith and Haseeb Hameed, the latter’s being his fifth in a row 
in this competition. At 58 not out, the 19-year-old needs only 12 to reach 
1,000 Championship runs this season.

When he gets there, even if it’s not today, he will be Lancashire’s youngest 
ever batsman to achieve that feat, beating Mike Atherton by nearly two years.

Lancashire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> are 141-0 now, 
leading by 275. We have 88 overs remaining in the day. Shot a ball stuff this 
morning with 71 runs coming in nine overs this morning, and Yorkshire already 
have the scouts out on the boundary.

 
Lancashire <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> have made a positive 
start to the morning, with 33 runs coming in the first five and a half overs of 
play to take their lead to 237.

Tom Smith reverse swept Adil Rashid for four in the first over of the day, and 
he has reached 50 off 80 balls. Century stand with Haseeb Hameed as well.

Sussex have just completed their second win of the season over Gloucestershire 
at Hove, by an innings and two runs. Steve Magoffin took the last wicket to 
fall, with Liam Norwell unable to bat having been hit on the head earlier in 
the contest.

 
Graham’s first update of the day:

Another glorious, sunny morning at Emirates Old Trafford, where we will be in 
for a humdinger of a final day if there is to be a positive result.

I am 99.9 percent of the way there in ruling a Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire> win out, but it wouldn’t amaze me 
if they went after a target given Middlesex’s position of strength at the top 
of Division One following yesterday’s win over Durham inside three days at 
Lord’s.

The smart money would still be on a draw here, but Lancashire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lancashire> fancy their chances of a first 
win in seven Championship matches and a first Roses win on this ground since 
2000.

Although the pitch isn’t a minefield yet, Simon Kerrigan believes it could be 
by the afternoon and evening sessions “if the sun bakes it and it crumbles”.

A Red Rose win would banish any lingering fears of relegation and would even 
give them an outside chance of a title push.

Just the three matches taking place in Division One today given that 
aforementioned Middlesex win.

Nottinghamshire are 42-2 overnight chasing 468 at Trent Bridge. We can rule 
out a home win there, but a Hampshire win would throw the cat right amongst the 
pigeons at the bottom.

At Edgbaston, Warwickshire are 2-1 from two overs chasing 396 to beat Surrey. 
If I have my maths right, a Surrey win could see them go third in the division 
if other results go their way.

Into Division Two and to Derby, where leaders Essex need five wickets and 
maybe a few runs to beat Derbyshire and take a significant step towards 
promotion. In reply to 530-9 declared, Derbyshire are 213-5 after being bowled 
out for 165 first time around.

At Northampton, home captain Alex Wakely last night opened their game against 
Leicestershire up by declaring on 397-7 in reply to 519 following Rob Newton’s 
maiden double century. Leicester reached close at 49-0, leading by 171.

Sussex, like Essex, are also close to an important victory - over 
Gloucestershire at Hove. Gloucester lead by only eleven with only two 
second-innings wickets in hand. Chris Jordan is only one wicket away from his 
first five-for of the season.

And finally, it should be a fascinating final day at New Road, where Glamorgan 
are 16-1 chasing 277 to beat Worcestershire, who have recovered well from 
conceding a first-innings lead of 117.
 
Morning all,
