South Africa skipper Faf du Plessis will play the day-night Test despite being 
found guilty of ball tampering for the second time in just over three years.

Du Plessis was fined 100% of his match fee after a three-hour International 
Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Council (ICC) hearing at 
Adelaide Oval. He was found guilty of ball tampering under clause 2.2.9 of the 
ICC’s code of conduct.

Footage emerged last week from the second Test of Du Plessis using saliva to 
shine the ball with a mint in his mouth.

Du Plessis was found guilty of ball tampering in 2013, when he breached the 
ICC’s code of conduct by rubbing the ball on the zipper of a trouser pocket 
during a Test against Pakistan.

But as per the new ICC code of conduct adopted in September, the indiscretion 
in Hobart was treated as a first offence.

In addition to the fine, three demerit points were added to Du Plessis’s 
disciplinary record.

Cricket South Africa confirmed that du Plessis, who pleaded not guilty, would 
appeal the verdict. The appeal could increase, decrease or amend the sanction.
