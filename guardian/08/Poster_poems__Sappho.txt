With International Translation Day <http://www.fit-ift.org/?page_id=1062> fast 
approaching, it's time for us to return to this most interesting of literary 
crafts. I say return because we already had aPoster Poems translation challenge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/aug/20/poster-poems-translation>
 a little over four years ago, but while that was a general invitation to post 
translations of your own choosing, this time I was thinking of something a 
little more specific.

The Greek poet Sappho <http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/sappho> has long 
been a favourite with English translators, with each generation recreating her 
work in the image of their own time. I've picked two of her poems, the short No 
48 and the somewhat longer No 65. (The numbers are from Edwin Marion Cox's 1925 
edition, by the way.) The idea is to look at a prose translation of each and a 
number of verse renditions. Then I'll invite you all to have a go at your own 
versions of one or both.

Fragment 48 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/usappho/sph49.htm> is a 
haiku-like mediation by moonlight. HT Wharton rendered it in a simple English 
sentence: "The moon has set, and the Pleiades; it is midnight, the time is 
going by, and I sleep alone." His prose captures the essence of the meaning, 
but omits anything that might be considered poetry.

If anything, the opposite might be said of John Addington Symonds's 
translation, in which the Greek poet becomes something of a Late Victorian 
aesthete, lost in reverie in a London studio.
 The moon hath left the sky; 
          Lost is the Pleiads' light; 
          It is midnight 
And time slips by; 
But on my couch alone I lie. 
The Irish novelist and ship's doctor Henry De Vere Stacpoole contrived to turn 
Sappho's poem into a kind of melancholy sea shanty:
 The moon has set beyond the seas, 
And vanished are the Pleiades; 
Half the long weary night has gone, 
Time passes—yet I lie alone. 
Under the influence of imagism, Mary Barnard produced a more pared-back version
 <http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/tonight-i-ve-watched>. AS Kline, one of the 
great translators of the internet age, has managed to pare his version back to 
roughly the same length as Wharton's prose while still producingwhat is 
recognisably an English poem 
<http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Sappho.htm#_Toc76357055>.

In Fragment 65 <http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/usappho/sph66.htm>, Sappho 
warns a rich (or, according to some editors, an uneducated) woman that when she 
dies, her wealth won't mean anything. In this instance, Wharton's prose is 
rather more florid. It's worth noting that the roses of Pieria were used to 
crown the Muses. "But thou shalt lie dead, nor shall there ever be any 
remembrance of thee then or thereafter, for thou hast not of the roses of 
Pieria; but thou shalt wander obscure even in the house of Hades, flitting 
among the shadowy dead."

It's a subject that almost inevitably appealed to Thomas Hardy, who made it 
even more Hardyesque in his translation:
 Dead shalt thou lie; and nought 
Be told of thee or thought, 
For thou hast plucked not of the Muses' tree: 
And even in Hades' halls 
Amidst thy fellow-thralls 
No friendly shade thy shade shall company! 
Swinburne contrived to insert a typically verbose rendering of the poem into 
hisAnactoria 
<http://swinburnearchive.indiana.edu/swinburne/view#docId=swinburne/acs0000001-01-i010.xml;query=;brand=Swinburne>
, a kind of Sapphic melange of his own devising.
 Thee too the years shall cover; thou shalt be 
As the rose born of one same blood with thee, 
As a song sung, as a word said, and fall 
Flower-wise, and be not any more at all, 
Nor any memory of thee anywhere; 
For never Muse has bound above thine hair 
The high Pierian flower whose graft outgrows 
All summer kinship of the mortal rose 
However, not even Swinburne could match John Myers O'Hara's ability to spin 
out so little over so many words:
 Pale death shall come, and thou and thine shall be, 
Then and thereafter, to all memory 
Forgotten as the wind that yesterday 
Blew the last lingering apple buds away; 
For thou hadst never that undying rose 
To grace the brow and shed immortal glows; 
Pieria's fadeless flower that few may claim 
To wreathe and save thy unremembered name. 
Ay! even on the fields of Dis unknown, 
Obscure among the shadows and alone, 
Thy flitting shade shall pass uncomforted 
Of any heed from all the flitting dead. 
But no one maid, I think, beneath the skies, 
At any time shall live and be as wise, 
In sooth, as I am; for the Muses Nine 
Have made me honored and their gifts are mine; 
And men, I think, will never quite forget 
My songs or me; so long as stars shall set 
Or sun shall rise, or hearts feel love's desire, 
My voice shall cross their dreams, a sigh of fire. 
Once again, Barnard's version 
<http://greece.itry4u.com/selections-of-sapphos-poetry-from-translations-by-mary-barnard>
 – number 82 in her very personal system – is leaner and more imagistic than 
these earlier attempts, and she manages to retain the very Greek notion of the 
"fitful" dead. She also conflates both wealth and ignorance as reasons for 
condemning her subject to an unsatisfactory afterlife.

And so I invite you to make your own versions of one or both of these pieces 
by one of the great poets of the ancient world. If accuracy is your watchword, 
theInternet Sacred Texts Archive <http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/usappho> will 
give you an idea of what the surviving poems look like in the original, even if 
you have no Greek. But don't worry too much about precision; you can be as 
faithful or as faithless as you like. For a poet as polymorphous as Sappho, 
fidelity would be something of a betrayal.
