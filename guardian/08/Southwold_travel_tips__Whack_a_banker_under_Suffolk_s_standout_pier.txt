Unlike many pier arcades, the witty contraptions created by Tim Hunkin (
timhunkin.com <http://www.timhunkin.com/index.htm>) for Southwold pier offer 
genuine amusement and won't rob you of all your spare change. Visitors to the 
Under the Pier Show can "Whack a banker"– thump the bald heads of bankers with 
a mallet as they pop up from their burrows – or take a virtual mutt for walkies 
around the streets of the Suffolk town, among many other delightfully eccentric 
diversions. The rest of the pier offers decent restaurants and shops, and then 
there's Southwold itself, with its soft sand, beach huts and fishermen selling 
the morning's catch, to explore.
