A large-scale video installation by artist Bill Viola 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bill-viola> of Mary carrying the body 
of Jesus will be unveiled at St Paul’s Cathedral.

The permanent project, entitled Mary, will be a companion piece to the 
American artist’s Martyrs (Earth, Air, Fire, Water) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/25/bill-viola-martyrs-review-let-the-unbelievers-come>
, which was unveiled in the south quire aisle of the cathedral in 2014.

The installations are the first moving-image artworks to be installed in a 
cathedral in Britain on a long-term basis.

Mary will be inaugurated in the north quire aisle on 8 September to coincide 
with the Feast of Mary, celebrating her birth.

Viola said: “The two themes of Mary and Martyrs symbolise some of the profound 
mysteries of human existence.

“One is concerned with birth and the other death; one with comfort and 
creation, the other with suffering and sacrifice. If I am successful, the final 
pieces will function both as aesthetic objects of contemporary art and as 
practical objects of traditional contemplation and devotion.”

Both Mary and Martyrs are collaborations with his wife, Kira Perov.

The installations follow Viola’s 2003 exhibition The Passions at the National 
Gallery. Before that he created The Messenger for Durham Cathedral in 1996 and 
the video triptych Study For The Path was donated to Basilica di San Marco in 
Milan in 2008.

His work Ocean Without a Shore premiered in the church of San Gallo at the 
2007 Venice Biennale.
