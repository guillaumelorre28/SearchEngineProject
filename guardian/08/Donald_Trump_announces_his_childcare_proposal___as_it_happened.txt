Today in Campaign 2016

 * The US Census bureau has just released a report on Income and Poverty in 
the United States in 2015. Among the findings is this good news: real median 
household income rose 5.2% in 2015. That’s the fastest growth on record. 
 * With pressure growing on Donald Trump to back up his claims of having given 
millions to charity – “tens of millions,” his running mate says – in the face 
of a juggernaut Washington Post investigation that has exposed one after 
another of those claims as likely lies, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway 
accused the press of “badgering.” “In other words, I don’t see it as 
journalism. I see it as badgering. In other words, we’ve had this conversation 
so many different times on so many different networks...” The “conversation” 
has amounted to Trump surrogates or the candidate himself asserting that he has 
given to charity and then refusing to reply to reporting indicating that he has 
not.

 * Trump unveiled his plans for government tax subsidies for childcare on 
Tuesday alongside his daughter Ivanka. Trump’s plan would allow childcare 
expenses to be tax-deductible for all individuals making under $250,000, up to 
the average cost of childcare in that person’s state, as well as expanding 
rebates for those who do not pay income taxes, through the earned income tax 
credit. His campaign declined to explain how this would be paid for, saying 
only that it would be part of a comprehensive tax reform and economic plan 
which would be revenue neutral.

 * The Democratic National Committee has released a statement in response to 
the latest release of documents obtained via a hack of its databases, drawing a 
connection between the likely perpetrators of the cyberattack and Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump. “The DNC is the victim of a crime - an 
illegal cyberattack by Russian state-sponsored agents who seek to harm the 
Democratic party and progressive groups in an effort to influence the 
presidential election,” said interim party chair Donna Brazile in a statement 
released this evening.

 * Former secretary of defense and retired four-star general Colin Powell 
referred to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a “national 
disgrace” and an “international pariah” in emails to a former aide,according to 
Buzzfeed News 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/colin-powell-calls-trump-national-disgrace-in-personal-email?utm_term=.wirrVrqGJ0#.kxM0z0W52A>
. Powell, who served under three Republican presidents but endorsed President 
Barack Obama twice, called the birther movement that Trump fomented “racist” in 
an email to Emily Miller, a journalist who once served as Powell’s deputy press 
secretary during his tenure in the second Bush administration.

Mike Pence in 1997: Working mothers 'stunt emotional growth' of children

Indiana governor and Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence first 
came on the national political scene by signing a so-called “religious freedom” 
law that critics said allowed discrimination against LGBT Hoosiers, but a 
recently unearthed letter from 1997 shows that Pence has been a combatant in 
the culture wars for decades.

In a letter published in the Indianapolis Star 
<http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/07/18/unknown.png> in the late 
nineties, Pence argued that “day-care kids get the short end of the emotional 
stick,” leading to “stunted emotional growth” for the children of working 
mothers.

“For years, we have gotten the message from the mouthpieces of the popular 
culture that you can have it all, career, kids and a two-car garage. The 
numbers in this federally funded study argue that the converse is true,” Pence 
wrote. “Sure, you can have it all, but your day-care kids get the short end of 
the emotional stick.”

Donald Trump echoed similar concerns about working mothers in the nineties. In 
a1994 interview 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/02/politics/trump-wife-comments-abc-interview/> 
about his divorce from wife Ivanna Trump, Trump said that “putting a wife to 
work is a very dangerous thing.”

“If you’re in business for yourself, I really think it’s a bad idea. I think 
that was the single greatest cause of what happened to my marriage with Ivana,” 
Trump continued.

New York attorney general opens inquiry into Trump Foundation

Ben Jacobs

New York <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> attorney general Eric 
Schneiderman has opened an inquiry into the conduct of the Donald J Trump 
Foundation, the personal charity of the Republican presidential nominee, a 
source familiar with the matter confirmed to the Guardian.

In an interview 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/eric-schneiderman-donald-trump-foundation/index.html>
 with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Schneiderman said Tuesday that he had been “looking 
into the Trump Foundation to make sure it’s complying with the laws governing 
charities in New York”.

The source said that Schneiderman “opened an inquiry on the Trump Foundation 
based on troubling transactions that have recently come to light.”


Schneiderman said “my interest in this issue really is in my capacity as 
regulator of nonprofits in New York state, and we have been concerned that the 
Trump Foundation may have engaged in some impropriety from that point of view.”

“We’ve had correspondence with them. I didn’t make a big deal out of it or 
hold a press conference.”

The comments come a week after the IRS fined the Trump Foundation $2,500 for 
making anillegal campaign contribution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-donation-pam-bondi-florida-attorney-general>
 to Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump supporter who decided 
not to investigate Trump University.

Attorney General Eric Sneiderman is a partisan hack who has turned a blind eye

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, outlining his 
child care policy, tells an audience in Aston, Pennsylvania, that his plan 
would free Americans from “the baskets” that politicians put them in - an 
oblique reference to Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment last 
Friday.

“I think you know what I’m talking about. While my opponent slanders you as 
deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hard-working American patriots,” Trump 
continues. “It’s time to end the rule of special interests and begin the rule 
of the American people - that’s what it’s all about.”

“It’s time to stop fighting about the smallest words,” Trump says. “It’s time 
to start believing in America again. Together, I promise you, together, we will 
make our country strong again. We will make our country prosperous again. We 
will make our country great again - greater than ever before.”

And with that, he’s out - a mere 20 minutes after he began his speech.

Net, Trump says, “to open up a dependent-care savings account,” similar to a 
health care savings account, in which pre-tax income can be saved in an account 
to be used for child care.

“These accounts will be available to all Americans - you won’t have to depend 
on your employers to have them,” Trump continues. “The money that is put into 
these accounts can also be spend not only on child care, but also on 
child-enrichment activities.”

The funds, Trump says, would not revert at the end of the year, but can roll 
over every year “to create substantial savings - tremendous savings, actually.”

“The funds will remain in the account until the age of 18,” at which point the 
remaining funds can be used to pay for higher education.

“For many families in our country, child care is now the single largest 
expense,” Trump continues. “My opponent has no child care plan - she never 
will, and if it ever evolves into a plan it will never get done anyway. All 
talk, no action.”

(This is not accurate - Clinton unveiled her plan in May. 
<https://www.hillaryclinton.com/post/what-you-need-know-about-hillary-clintons-plan-cut-child-care-costs-america/>
)

“Many Americans are just one crisis away from disaster: a sick kid, a lost 
job, a damaged home,” Trump says. “And this is what I’m going to be outlining 
tonight.”

“Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to deduct the average cost 
of child care from their taxes,” Trump says of his plan. “For low-income 
individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will expand the EITC... in 
the form of a child care rebate. Working parents can get an expanded EITC 
benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax.”

“This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 in EITC benefits for working 
families.”

audience that his “detailed proposals” on the issue of child care and education 
will make clear for American voters that his campaign “is about ideas.”

“Child care is such a big problem,” Trump says. “And we’re gonna solve that 
problem.”

Ivanka Trump introduces Donald Trump

Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, introduced her father at a campaign event in 
Aston, Pennsylvania, rolling out his child care proposals as “a woman, a mother 
and a woman who works.”

“My father’s policy will give paid leave to mothers whose employers are among 
the almost 90% of US employers that currently do not offer this benefit,” Trump 
said. “My father understands the needs of the modern workforce, and is offering 
a new and innovative solution where others have not.”

“Raising children full-time is one of the hardest jobs anyone can do, and it’s 
essential that our policies... honor that reality,” Trump continues. “Ensuring 
its enactment will be one of my top priorities when he is elected come 
November. This is not a woman’s issue - it’s a family issue, it’s an American 
issue.”

The Clinton campaign appears willing and able to engage on the “deplorable” 
fight - starting with this internet spot in which Republican running mate Mike 
Pence declines to call white nationalist and former grand wizard of the Ku Klux 
Klan “deplorable.”

Report: Colin Powell calls Donald Trump 'a national disgrace,' 'international 
pariah' in emails

Former secretary of defense and retired four-star general Colin Powell 
referred to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a “national 
disgrace” and an “international pariah” in emails to a former aide,according to 
Buzzfeed News 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/colin-powell-calls-trump-national-disgrace-in-personal-email?utm_term=.wirrVrqGJ0#.kxM0z0W52A>
.

Powell, who served under three Republican presidents but endorsed President 
Barack Obama twice, called the birther movement that Trump fomented “racist” in 
an email to Emily Miller, a journalist who once served as Powell’s deputy press 
secretary during his tenure in the second Bush administration.

Trump, Powell said in a June 2016 email, “is in the process of destroying 
himself, no need for Dems to attack him. Paul Ryan is calibrating his position 
again.”

Powell’s slams against Trump, unheard of intra-party attacks that would be 
unheard of in any other campaign cycle, may not make an impact - according to 
Powell himself.

“To go on and call him an idiot just emboldens him,” Powell said in another 
email.

In comment to Buzzfeed News, Powell did not deny sending the emails.

Hillary Clinton returns to the campaign trail Thursday

The Associated Press reports: 

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> will 
resume campaign travel Thursday after a bout of pneumonia.

Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill says the Democratic nominee spent Tuesday 
reading briefing material and making calls. She also watched President Barack 
Obama campaigning on her behalf in Philadelphia.

She had planned to campaign Wednesday in Las Vegas. Former President Bill 
Clinton will headline the event in her place.

Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia Friday. But her campaign didn’t disclose 
the illness until Sunday, after video emerged showing her stumbling and being 
held up by aides after abruptly leaving a 9/11 memorial service in New York.

Libertarian presidential tickets achieves ballot access in all 50 states, 
District of Columbia

The presidential campaign of former New Mexico governor and Libertarian 
presidential nominee Gary Johnson has announced that the ticket has achieved 
ballot access in all 50 states, as well as in the District of Columbia.

“With a majority of Americans wanting a choice other than Donald Trump and 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, today we 
now know for certain that on Election Day, every voter in America will have 
that alternative option,” Johnson said in a statement. “And today we also know 
that the only other option on every American voter’s ballot will be myself and 
Gov. [Bill] Weld.”

Calling the ballot-access process “a monumental task,” Johnson slightly shaded 
Green party candidate Jill Stein by reminding followers that the Libertarian 
party “will be the only ticket other than theRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> and Democrats to do so.”

 * The US Census bureau has just released a report on Income and Poverty in 
the United States in 2015. Among the findings is this good news: real median 
household income rose 5.2% in 2015. That’s the fastest growth on record. 
 * With pressure growing on Donald Trump to back up his claims of having given 
millions to charity – “tens of millions,” his running mate says – in the face 
of a juggernaut Washington Post investigation that has exposed one after 
another of those claims as likely lies, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway 
accused the press of “badgering.” “In other words, I don’t see it as 
journalism. I see it as badgering. In other words, we’ve had this conversation 
so many different times on so many different networks...” The “conversation” 
has amounted to Trump surrogates or the candidate himself asserting that he has 
given to charity and then refusing to reply to reporting indicating that he has 
not.

 * Trump unveiled his plans for government tax subsidies for childcare on 
Tuesday alongside his daughter Ivanka. Trump’s plan would allow childcare 
expenses to be tax-deductible for all individuals making under $250,000, up to 
the average cost of childcare in that person’s state, as well as expanding 
rebates for those who do not pay income taxes, through the earned income tax 
credit. His campaign declined to explain how this would be paid for, saying 
only that it would be part of a comprehensive tax reform and economic plan 
which would be revenue neutral.

 * The Democratic National Committee has released a statement in response to 
the latest release of documents obtained via a hack of its databases, drawing a 
connection between the likely perpetrators of the cyberattack and Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump. “The DNC is the victim of a crime - an 
illegal cyberattack by Russian state-sponsored agents who seek to harm the 
Democratic party and progressive groups in an effort to influence the 
presidential election,” said interim party chair Donna Brazile in a statement

Indiana governor and Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence first 
came on the national political scene by signing a so-called “religious freedom” 
law that critics said allowed discrimination against LGBT Hoosiers, but a 
recently unearthed letter from 1997 shows that Pence has been a combatant in 
the culture wars for decades.

In a letter published in the Indianapolis Star 
<http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/07/18/unknown.png> in the late 
nineties, Pence argued that “day-care kids get the short end of the emotional 
stick,” leading to “stunted emotional growth” for the children of working 
mothers.

“For years, we have gotten the message from the mouthpieces of the popular 
culture that you can have it all, career, kids and a two-car garage. The 
numbers in this federally funded study argue that the converse is true,” Pence 
wrote. “Sure, you can have it all, but your day-care kids get the short end of 
the emotional stick.”

Donald Trump echoed similar concerns about working mothers in the nineties. In 
a1994 interview 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/02/politics/trump-wife-comments-abc-interview/> 
about his divorce from wife Ivanna Trump, Trump said that “putting a wife to 
work is a very dangerous thing.”

“If you’re in business for yourself, I really think it’s a bad idea. I think 
that was the single greatest cause of what happened to my marriage with Ivana,” 
Trump continued.
 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has 
responded to Donald Trump’s (inaccurate) accusation that she doesn’t have a 
child care policy:

New York <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> attorney general Eric 
Schneiderman has opened an inquiry into the conduct of the Donald J Trump 
Foundation, the personal charity of the Republican presidential nominee, a 
source familiar with the matter confirmed to the Guardian.

In an interview 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/eric-schneiderman-donald-trump-foundation/index.html>
 with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Schneiderman said Tuesday that he had been “looking 
into the Trump Foundation to make sure it’s complying with the laws governing 
charities in New York”.

The source said that Schneiderman “opened an inquiry on the Trump Foundation 
based on troubling transactions that have recently come to light.”


Schneiderman said “my interest in this issue really is in my capacity as 
regulator of nonprofits in New York state, and we have been concerned that the 
Trump Foundation may have engaged in some impropriety from that point of view.”

“We’ve had correspondence with them. I didn’t make a big deal out of it or 
hold a press conference.”

The comments come a week after the IRS fined the Trump Foundation $2,500 for 
making anillegal campaign contribution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-donation-pam-bondi-florida-attorney-general>
 to Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump supporter who decided 
not to investigate Trump University.

Jason Miller, the communications adviser for Donald Trump’s presidential 
campaign, has released a statement about the reported inquiry into the Donald 
J. Trump Foundation by the New York attorney general:

Attorney General Eric Sneiderman is a partisan hack who has turned a blind eye 
to the Clinton Foundation for years and has endorsedHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> for president. This is 
nothing more than another left-wing hit job designed to distract from Crooked 
Hillary Clinton’s disastrous week.
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, outlining his 
child care policy, tells an audience in Aston, Pennsylvania, that his plan 
would free Americans from “the baskets” that politicians put them in - an 
oblique reference to Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment last 
Friday.

“I think you know what I’m talking about. While my opponent slanders you as 
deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hard-working American patriots,” Trump 
continues. “It’s time to end the rule of special interests and begin the rule 
of the American people - that’s what it’s all about.”

“It’s time to stop fighting about the smallest words,” Trump says. “It’s time 
to start believing in America again. Together, I promise you, together, we will 
make our country strong again. We will make our country prosperous again. We 
will make our country great again - greater than ever before.”

And with that, he’s out - a mere 20 minutes after he began his speech.
 
Net, Trump says, “to open up a dependent-care savings account,” similar to a 
health care savings account, in which pre-tax income can be saved in an account 
to be used for child care.

“These accounts will be available to all Americans - you won’t have to depend 
on your employers to have them,” Trump continues. “The money that is put into 
these accounts can also be spend not only on child care, but also on 
child-enrichment activities.”

The funds, Trump says, would not revert at the end of the year, but can roll 
over every year “to create substantial savings - tremendous savings, actually.”

“The funds will remain in the account until the age of 18,” at which point the 
remaining funds can be used to pay for higher education.
 
“For many families in our country, child care is now the single largest 
expense,” Trump continues. “My opponent has no child care plan - she never 
will, and if it ever evolves into a plan it will never get done anyway. All 
talk, no action.”

(This is not accurate - Clinton unveiled her plan in May. 
<https://www.hillaryclinton.com/post/what-you-need-know-about-hillary-clintons-plan-cut-child-care-costs-america/>
)

“Many Americans are just one crisis away from disaster: a sick kid, a lost 
job, a damaged home,” Trump says. “And this is what I’m going to be outlining 
tonight.”

“Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to deduct the average cost 
of child care from their taxes,” Trump says of his plan. “For low-income 
individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will expand the EITC... in 
the form of a child care rebate. Working parents can get an expanded EITC 
benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax.”

“This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 in EITC benefits for working 
families.”
 
Speaking in Aston, Pennsylvania, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is outlining his newly minted 
child care policy, which he vows will “make a lot of people really happy”.

After being introduced by daughter Ivanka, who headlined the issue of child 
care reform at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Trump tells the 
audience that his “detailed proposals” on the issue of child care and education 
will make clear for American voters that his campaign “is about ideas.”

“Child care is such a big problem,” Trump says. “And we’re gonna solve that 
problem.”
 
Watch it live here:
 
Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, introduced her father at a campaign event in 
Aston, Pennsylvania, rolling out his child care proposals as “a woman, a mother 
and a woman who works.”

“My father’s policy will give paid leave to mothers whose employers are among 
the almost 90% of US employers that currently do not offer this benefit,” Trump 
said. “My father understands the needs of the modern workforce, and is offering 
a new and innovative solution where others have not.”

“Raising children full-time is one of the hardest jobs anyone can do, and it’s 
essential that our policies... honor that reality,” Trump continues. “Ensuring 
its enactment will be one of my top priorities when he is elected come 
November. This is not a woman’s issue - it’s a family issue, it’s an American 
issue.”
 
The Clinton campaign appears willing and able to engage on the “deplorable” 
fight - starting with this internet spot in which Republican running mate Mike 
Pence declines to call white nationalist and former grand wizard of the Ku Klux 
Klan “deplorable.”
 
Former secretary of defense and retired four-star general Colin Powell 
referred to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a “national 
disgrace” and an “international pariah” in emails to a former aide,according to 
Buzzfeed News 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/colin-powell-calls-trump-national-disgrace-in-personal-email?utm_term=.wirrVrqGJ0#.kxM0z0W52A>
.

Powell, who served under three Republican presidents but endorsed President 
Barack Obama twice, called the birther movement that Trump fomented “racist” in 
an email to Emily Miller, a journalist who once served as Powell’s deputy press 
secretary during his tenure in the second Bush administration.

Trump, Powell said in a June 2016 email, “is in the process of destroying 
himself, no need for Dems to attack him. Paul Ryan is calibrating his position 
again.”

Powell’s slams against Trump, unheard of intra-party attacks that would be 
unheard of in any other campaign cycle, may not make an impact - according to 
Powell himself.

“To go on and call him an idiot just emboldens him,” Powell said in another 
email.

In comment to Buzzfeed News, Powell did not deny sending the emails.

The Associated Press reports: 

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> will 
resume campaign travel Thursday after a bout of pneumonia.

Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill says the Democratic nominee spent Tuesday 
reading briefing material and making calls. She also watched President Barack 
Obama campaigning on her behalf in Philadelphia.

She had planned to campaign Wednesday in Las Vegas. Former President Bill 
Clinton will headline the event in her place.

Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia Friday. But her campaign didn’t disclose 
the illness until Sunday, after video emerged showing her stumbling and being 
held up by aides after abruptly leaving a 9/11 memorial service in New York.
 
The presidential campaign of former New Mexico governor and Libertarian 
presidential nominee Gary Johnson has announced that the ticket has achieved 
ballot access in all 50 states, as well as in the District of Columbia.

“With a majority of Americans wanting a choice other than Donald Trump and 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, today we 
now know for certain that on Election Day, every voter in America will have 
that alternative option,” Johnson said in a statement. “And today we also know 
that the only other option on every American voter’s ballot will be myself and 
Gov. [Bill] Weld.”

Calling the ballot-access process “a monumental task,” Johnson slightly shaded 
Green party candidate Jill Stein by reminding followers that the Libertarian 
party “will be the only ticket other than theRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> and Democrats to do so.”
