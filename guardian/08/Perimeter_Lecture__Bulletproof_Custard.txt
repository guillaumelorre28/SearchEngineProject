This month’s public lecture at the Perimeter Institute  
<http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/outreach/general-public/public-lecture-series>
is by Michael Cates, the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of 
Cambridge, on the weird properties of soft matter.

Cates is an expert on the theory of soft matter, such as polymers, colloids, 
gels, liquid crystals, and granular material, as well as the burgeoning field 
of “active matter.”

The live stream will appear below, followed by a recording shortly afterwards.
