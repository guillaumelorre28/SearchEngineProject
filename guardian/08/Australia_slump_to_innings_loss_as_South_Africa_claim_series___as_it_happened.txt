That’s it from us

“I think it’s really important that we enjoy this moment,” says South African 
captain Faf du Plessis, who is beaming with pride with his side’s efforts as I 
sign off. There’s really not much more to say at this point. Australia lost 
eight wickets in two hours to surrender in this game and there will surely be 
recriminations to follow at both the selection table and in the court of public 
opinion. That’s all from me, but thanks for joining us throughout this second 
Test.

Whole Test done and dusted in 193.5 overs, 876 minutes. Just 7 sessions 
required to wrap up the series in Hobart.

Australia’s disgrace is confirmed

The home side lost eight wickets for 40 runs in a dismal morning of cricket to 
finish this game, with wickets tumbling at regular intervals after Usman 
Khawaja’s injudicious stroke to get out on 64. His captain Steve Smith (31) 
hung around for much of what followed, but even he perished eventually as Kyle 
Abbott and Kagiso Rabada worked the Australians over with unstinting pressure.

Man of the match Kyle Abbott finished with 6-77 from 23.1 overs of ceaselessly 
accurate and threatening pace bowling, while his partner in crime Rabada ended 
up with 4-34 from 17 after ruffling many a feather with a fast, stump-to-stump 
spell that had Australia’s batsmen ducking, weaving, squirming and 
surrendering. Adam Voges and Callum Ferguson departed to shots that will give 
them nightmares, and Voges may well find his position in this side questioned 
after this disaster. Heads will roll, make no doubt.

“It’s nice to get one and make the most of it,” Abbott says of his opportunity 
here, which he took with both hands here. “I think the overhead conditions 
helped,” he says of the assistance he received from the elements. He says the 
South Africans went into this series knowing the strength and weaknesses of the 
Australian batsmen, and it must be said that the latter quality was on clear 
display today.

Steve Smith then steps forward to face the music. “It wasn’t the way we 
planned it,” he starts. “They gave us no freebies....They were hitting good 
areas and got the rewards. We’ve gotta find a way to be more resilient... We’ve 
got to find ways.”

“Guys have got to try and find ways to get themselves in...The way that they 
bowled was magnificent. They hit that ten cent piece. A lot of credit goes to 
them for the way they bowled.”

To Australian fans he says this: “Stick with us. We’re doing our best.”

South Africa win the game and take the series!

WICKET! Lyon c Philander b Abbott 4 (Australia all out for 161)

Lyon holes out to mid-on, a fittingly meek offering to finish a disastrous 
batting performance. That’s an innings and 80-run loss for Australia, who have 
been humiliated in Hobart. The South Africans are ecstatic and well they might 
be because they dominated this game from the very first over and deserve this 
success, which was achieved with ruthless efficiency. Australia, on the other 
hand, face a genuine crisis.

60th over: Australia 161-9 (Hazlewood 6, Lyon 4)

The other thing this result has done is rubbish the notion that home sides 
always dominate Test cricket. In a somewhat symbolic sight, the local 
broadcaster now pans to the Australian dressing room, where batting coach 
Graeme Hick looks on forlornly. In dining terms, he’s arrived at the buffet 
when there’s only stale garlic bread left.

59th over: Australia 155-9 (Hazlewood 0, Lyon 4)

“Having a break at work and thought I’d see what was happening in the cricket 
and maybe attempt to write an amusing missive,” says reader Phil Withall. 
“There appears to be no need for it. All the comedy and parody seems to be out 
there on the pitch.” Speaking of comedy, Nathan Lyon has just played the shot 
of the day, extravagantly driving Abbott to the boundary at long-off to finish 
the over.

WICKET! Starc c de Kock b Abbott 0 (Australia 151-9)

Abbott wins the race to five wickets! And Mitchell Starc is the man to go, 
driving ambitiously and sending a thick edge through to a diving Quinton de 
Kock. See ya later. South Africa are one wicket away from an innings and 90-run 
annihilation of the Australians.

58th over: Australia 151-8 (Starc 0, Hazlewood 0)

“They’ve stuck their chest out and just been all over Australia,” says Shane 
Warne of the tourists. “They just don’t fear this Australian team.” He’s right, 
of course. They haven’t just been outplayed, they’ve been embarrassed on their 
home turf in the last two weeks. Pakistan must be salivating at the prospect of 
picking over this carcass. Maiden to Rabada.

57th over: Australia 151-8 (Starc 0, Hazlewood 0)

A certain amount of Australians have always had difficulty dealing with 
Abbott, and the Kyle variety returns here with a maiden to Starc, who can’t lay 
bat on his cutters and swervers. The only problem for South Africa right now 
are the constant injuries being picked up by Quinton de Kock, who wore a finger 
in the eye during the last round of wicket celebrations.

56th over: Australia 151-8 (Starc 0, Hazlewood 0)

The Rabada over ends without further incident but all of a sudden he’s got 
4-28 from 15 overs. With Kyle Abbott returning at the other end with the same 
wicket tally, it’s a race to get a five-fer now.
Dan Liebke (@LiebCricket) 
At least Australia have stopped getting out to reckless attacking shots and 
are now instead falling to reckless defensive shots.#AUSvSA

WICKET! Smith c de Kock b Radad 31 (Australia 151-8)

Smith’s brave stand ends! It was a Border-like vigil by the Aussie skipper but 
he finally feathers an edge behind of Rabada, who a couple of balls prior had 
ruffled him with a nasty bouncer that reared up off the pitch and hammered 
Smith’s left hand. That blow clearly unsettled the batsman and his determined 
resistance comes to an end, along with any hope that Australia can fight it out 
until lunch.

55th over: Australia 151-7 (Smith 31, Starc 0)

Mitchell Starc is out there now and Australia still trail by 90 when Steve 
Smith nudges a single to the leg side off Philander and puts his partner on 
strike. At least the skipper can make an informed judgment on his team’s 
batting in this Test; he’s been at the other end for the fall of 13 of the 17 
wickets so far. Starc survives the over, much to the chagrin of the Proteas, 
who have come to expect total surrender now.

WICKET! Mennie LBW Radada 0 (Australia 150-7)

Mennie goes! There was some debate as to whether he edged it onto his toe but 
having walked across his stumps and been struck on the full, he’s a goner. 
Rabada has two in the over and Australia’s batting crisis continues. What a 
dismal showing this has been.

Review! Rabada gets Mennie LBW

It hit him on the full, so this is a very hopeful review. Or did he hit it?

WICKET! Nevill c Duminy b Rabada 6 (Australia 150-6)

Nevill goes! And it’s an absolute snorter from Rabada, who gives Nevill the 
ball Callum Ferguson expected earlier. It’s short and straight and spits up 
from the pitch, arrowing in at Nevill’s face as the Australian jams his bat 
handle and gloves in the way, only to send another deflection to Duminy at 
gully. We’re officially into the tail now. This might be over by lunch.

53rd over: Australia 147-5 (Smith 27, Nevill 6)

Peter Nevill shows how it’s done, getting forward and cautiously angling 
Philander down to third man for two – the first runs to come from the paceman 
so far this morning. “This partnership needs to grow” says Michael Slater in 
the understatement of this and any other age of cricket. That’s drinks on a 
disastrous morning for the home side.

52nd over: Australia 145-5 (Smith 27, Nevill 4)

I know I just said it about Callum Ferguson, but at least Peter Nevill has an 
opportunity to bat for a while here, and a competent partner out there with 
him. He showed his diligence well in Perth and will be hoping to hang around 
for a similar stay here.

51st over: Australia 144-5 (Smith 27, Nevill 3)

Kyle Abbott takes a well-earned rest now but there’s no respite for the 
Australians as Vernon Philander returns for a second spell. He hasn’t taken a 
wicket this innings after five in the first, so he’s probably feeling a bit 
left out. An entire over passes without an Australian wicket falling, which is 
pretty good going for them right now.

Further reasons for cheer:

Australia have survived the length of an ODI innings. #AdvantageAustralia

50th over: Australia 144-5 (Smith 27, Nevill 3)

It might seem a bit obvious at this point, but this is precisely happens when 
each paceman bowls in partnership with the other, applying pressure at both 
ends and forcing the issue. Too often in this game the Australians gave South 
Africa let-offs from at least one end. The bowling this morning has stifled the 
batsmen and taken advantage of the conditions. No more, no less. Kyle Abbott 
has been magnificent, and Philander nagged away constantly. Only in the latter 
stages of this Rabada over, with singles taken on a number of occasions, have 
runs been easy to come by.

at the moment, I'm guessing he's at least getting more airtime than Callum.

WICKET! Ferguson c Elgar b Rabada 1 (Australia 140-5)

Ferguson departs in similar style to Voges! Oof, that is ugly. Radada is short 
and angling it towards the Australian, and he lowers his bat and hands as he 
ducks it, but the ball never gets up as far as he expects and this time runs 
off the gloves and straight into the hands of Elgar at third slip. Place-setter

49th over: Australia 140-4 (Smith 26, Ferguson 1)

It’s completely against the run of play and the tenor of Abbott’s spell but 
the big Protea over-pitches to Smith and gets whipped through mid-wicket for 
four, the ball flying to the fence like a tracer bullett. Smith is back and 
well across to cover an in-ducker moments later, which is a good thing because 
being well outside the line prevents an LBW shout being taken seriously, even 
by Aleem Dar.
Adam Collins (@collinsadam) 
If that's it for Voges he'll finish with an average of 61.87, second highest 
ever for those with 20 innings:https://t.co/bxcgn9f19o <https://t.co/bxcgn9f19o>

48th over: Australia 136-4 (Smith 22, Ferguson 1)

Ferguson faced up to Rabada now and angles an edgy one into the ground before 
it reaches gully, but the South Africans react as though he’s been done in 
completely. There are three slips and a gully in place for Ferguson and he’s 
crouching low in his stance as the bowler glides in. Amid all the Australian 
chaos, Quinny de Kock is having an absolute nightmare behind the stumps because 
the ball is swerving all over the place after it passes the batsman. The poor 
bloke’s fingers will be black and blue by the afternoon.

47th over: Australia 136-4 (Smith 22, Ferguson 1)

This is another dire situation for Callum Ferguson in his first Test. He’s 
just watch a seasoned pro of Australian cricket (that’s Voges) depart in 
tragi-comic style and has to maintain his composure to stop a rampaging Kyle 
Abbott, who now has four wickets to his name and a serious gust of wind in his 
sails. Replays of the Voges dismissal focusing on Steve Smith’s reaction tell a 
compelling story, but at least Ferguson is off the mark with a neat flick to 
through mid-wicket. At least the South Australian has plenty of time to bat...

WICKET! Voges c Duminy b Abbott 2 (Australia 135-4)

Voges departs in bizarre style! Oh my word, that is a shocker. Voges shapes to 
pull a short one from Abbott but changes his mind halfway through, stopping the 
stroke and in the process, letting the ball roll off the face of his bat and 
into the hands of Duminy at gully. What on earth was that? I’m sorry to say it, 
but that could be the kind of thing that ends the guy’s Test career. He was 
under the pump heading into this game and a dismissal like this does him no 
favours.

46th over: Australia 135-3 (Smith 22, Voges 2)

Kagiso Rabada appears now to replace Vernon Philander and here’s an 
interesting stat: of the seven umpiring decisions overturned in this game, six 
of the mistakes have belonged to Aleem Dar. It’s not just Australia’s batsmen 
who’ve struggled at Bellerive. Rabada starts solidly enough, cutting one back 
into Voges’ pads and attracting half a shout for LBW. Voges edges leans into an 
edgy forward defence for one to get off strike, and it’s is the only run of the 
over.

45th over: Australia 134-3 (Smith 22, Voges 1)

The South Africans can’t believe Smith didn’t hit it but get back to the task 
immediately and Abbott in particular is applying himself to it with vigour, 
cutting and swerving the ball with unerring accuracy and causing Smith constant 
worry. Survival is the batsman’s only priority right now, such is the quality 
of this bowling spell. Finally Smith unshackles himself by firmly planting his 
back foot and pouncing on some width to crack an attractive drive to the fence 
through deep extra cover. This is an absorbing passage of Test cricket.

Not out! Steve Smith survives

Aleem Dar has had another shocker here as replays confirm it was a case of bat 
on pad, so the Australian skipper gets a reprieve. This has been a bad Test for 
Dar. As tough as his job is, he’s got a lot of these ones wrong in Hobart.

Review! Steve Smith given out caught behind but refers it!

And he’s adamant it wasn’t an edge, calling for the review straight away and 
shaking his head at Aleem Dar.

44th over: Australia 130-3 (Smith 18, Voges 1)

Adam Voges adopts the same approach as Steve Smith and marks his guard a 
decent way down the track to Philander, though not quite as far away from the 
crease as his partner. Voges is a model of patience and technique as he 
smothers the ball in his forward defence but the South Africans are full of 
voice in the field and expecting a chance at any moment.

43rd over: Australia 130-3 (Smith 18, Voges 1)

Voges avoids the king pair with an emphatic forward defence to Abbott but the 
South Africans sniff blood here and coo away in response to every delivery from 
the burly paceman. Standing at second slip, Proteas skipper Faf du Plessis 
looks like an SAS Commando on recreational leave, grinning broadly as Voges 
assesses whether or not Abbott’s in-duckers are about to take his off stump. 
The Australian gets off the mark with a thick edge wide of gully, but it’s not 
the nerve-settling start he probably wants. As the over ends Australia still 
trail by 111 and Abbott is screaming for an LBW chance that hits Smith well 
outside the line.

42nd over: Australia 129-3 (Smith 18, Voges 0)

Nervous times here for Adam Voges, though thankfully for him Khawaja fell on 
the final delivery of the Abbott over, meaning Steve Smith takes strike to 
Philander to start with. Voges got an absolute peach in the first innings, 
edging behind for a golden duck. At least he’s able to acclimatise himself a 
little at the non-striker’s end here. There’s a little battle developing 
between Smith and Philander, who is bowling the odd straight one at the Aussie 
skipper, which introduces a bit of variety. The last ball of the over cuts in a 
mile and raps Smith on the thigh. South Africa are buoyant now. Voges is fresh 
at the crease and Smith is struggling just a little.

WICKET! Khawaja c de Kock b Abbott 64 (Australia 129-3)

Khawaja nicks behind and departs! Well, I’d just been crafting a long 
paragraph predicting that Khawaja might soon provide a chance for a relaxed and 
jovial-looking South African cordon and off the final ball of the Abbott over 
he does it, swiping lazily at a short one that angled away from him. He’d 
wafted away a couple of times earlier in the over and departs to give the 
Proteas an ideal start to the morning. Stand by, Australia, this might get ugly 
from here.

40th over: Australia 123-2 (Khawaja 58, Smith 18)

Steve Smith is batting a good half-metre out of his crease now with Vernon 
Philander charging in, attempting to break up the bowler’s metronomic line and 
length. There’s a hairy moment when Smith half-plays and half-leaves, just sort 
of dangling his bat out as the ball passes, but the batsman gets back on track 
with an emphatic drive that’s cut off well by Dean Elgar. Another maiden for 
Philander.

39th over: Australia 123-2 (Khawaja 58, Smith 18)

Another item of note: I could be wrong, but there seems to be more people on 
the field than in the stands to start the day, not entirely unexpected on a 
chilly Tuesday in Hobart but a distinctly ‘Sheffield Shield’ sight. Khawaja 
gets moving with a gentle drive for two through cover but it’s the only damage 
in the Abbott over, which is probably a bit too straight.

38th over: Australia 121-2 (Khawaja 56, Smith 18)

Faf du Plessis might have been tempted to unleash Kagiso Rabada first thing up 
but Vernon Philander pulls rank to pair with Abbott. His first ball comes down 
at a nagging line and length and wobbles away just a little as Steve Smith 
smothers it with an exaggerated forward defence.

A ball later he’s causing greater trouble for his keeper Quinton de Kock than 
Smith, because some late swing once the ball passes the batsman means de Kock 
is hammered on his ‘good’ thumb in an awkward moment. He shakes the injured 
hand vigorously and mouths a few a choice words at himself. Now he’s perfectly 
balanced with pain in both thumbs. Smith sees off another maiden, perhaps 
signalling his intent for the day.

37th over: Australia 121-2 (Khawaja 56, Smith 18)

OK, we’re off and away on day four and it’s Kyle Abbott charging in for the 
Proteas and Usman Khawaja on strike. The first one is back of a length and 
straight and Khawaja is quickly back and defending with a straight bat. The 
next is trickier, slanting across him and moving away appreciably once it hits 
the deck, so much so the batsman’s overcommitted prod of the bat gets nowhere 
near it. It’s a testing first over from Abbott, made more threatening by 
Khawaja’s unwillingness to move his feet. Khawaja almost ‘does a Burns’ down 
the leg side but it’s all thigh pad. All up it’s a super start from Abbott and 
a lethargic one for Khawaja.

While we have a moment

Vic Marks has an interesting take on England and India’s recent Test in 
Rajkot, which saw the home side gain an ascendancy that displeased Indian 
skipper Virat Kohli. More from Vic below:

“But in Rajkot there was a departure from the usual pattern, which did not 
much please India’s captain, Virat Kohli. There was live grass on the pitch, 
which helped to bind the surface together. “It should not have been the case,” 
he said emphatically afterwards. He has obviously glanced at the history books 
as well.”

Joe Burns is struggling

Two misfires in his most recent Shield game didn’t deter selectors, but a 
double failure here in Hobart has a lot of people asking questions. He’s 
staying positive, but you’d have to assume the likes of Cameron Bancroft and 
Nic Maddinson are becoming hopeful of receiving a phone call from Rod Marsh.
Gerard Whateley (@GerardWhateley) 
Burns: "I feel like I'm hitting the ball really well. But at the end of the 
day you've got to put runs on the board."

The wicket

...has apparently dried out. “She looks good for batting,” says Kevin 
Pietersen, who is currently towering over Ian Chappell in the middle of the 
ground. It’s certainly far more straw-coloured than it was early in the game, 
so perhaps in better shape for batting than during Australia’s first innings. 
If the rain stays away today, Australia will at least have conditions on their 
side.

Preamble

Hello and welcome to day four of the second Test in Hobart, in which the home 
side are hoping to make South Africa bat again but currently stand only a small 
chance of actually making a game of it. Australian batsmen Usman Khawaja (56 
not out) and Steve Smith (18) start the day 120 in arrears of the Proteas’ 
first innings total and their team has eight wickets in hand. I’m not a betting 
man, but it’ll be a tall order for them to set a target that will trouble the 
tourists.

Russell Jackson here taking you through all the action throughout the day, and 
as I tap away at this introduction I’m watching ‘Baby John’ Burgess and Richard 
Wilkins spinning a very homemade-looking Wheel of Fortune wheel on the local 
broadcaster. If that’s not a symbol of Australia’s decline, I’m not sure what 
is.

The weather news in Hobart? Skies are currently clear, there’s a light 
westerly breeze and only a 30% chance of rain in the morning according to the 
Bureau of Meteorology. I like those odds.

That’s it from us

“I think it’s really important that we enjoy this moment,” says South African 
captain Faf du Plessis, who is beaming with pride with his side’s efforts as I 
sign off. There’s really not much more to say at this point. Australia lost 
eight wickets in two hours to surrender in this game and there will surely be 
recriminations to follow at both the selection table and in the court of public 
opinion. That’s all from me, but thanks for joining us throughout this second 
Test.

Australia’s disgrace is confirmed

The home side lost eight wickets for 40 runs in a dismal morning of cricket to 
finish this game, with wickets tumbling at regular intervals after Usman 
Khawaja’s injudicious stroke to get out on 64. His captain Steve Smith (31) 
hung around for much of what followed, but even he perished eventually as Kyle 
Abbott and Kagiso Rabada worked the Australians over with unstinting pressure.

Man of the match Kyle Abbott finished with 6-77 from 23.1 overs of ceaselessly 
accurate and threatening pace bowling, while his partner in crime Rabada ended 
up with 4-34 from 17 after ruffling many a feather with a fast, stump-to-stump 
spell that had Australia’s batsmen ducking, weaving, squirming and 
surrendering. Adam Voges and Callum Ferguson departed to shots that will give 
them nightmares, and Voges may well find his position in this side questioned 
after this disaster. Heads will roll, make no doubt.

“It’s nice to get one and make the most of it,” Abbott says of his opportunity 
here, which he took with both hands here. “I think the overhead conditions 
helped,” he says of the assistance he received from the elements. He says the 
South Africans went into this series knowing the strength and weaknesses of the 
Australian batsmen, and it must be said that the latter quality was on clear 
display today.

Steve Smith then steps forward to face the music. “It wasn’t the way we 
planned it,” he starts. “They gave us no freebies....They were hitting good 
areas and got the rewards. We’ve gotta find a way to be more resilient... We’ve 
got to find ways.”

“Guys have got to try and find ways to get themselves in...The way that they 
bowled was magnificent. They hit that ten cent piece. A lot of credit goes to 
them for the way they bowled.”

To Australian fans he says this: “Stick with us. We’re doing our best.”
 
WICKET! Lyon c Philander b Abbott 4 (Australia all out for 161)

Lyon holes out to mid-on, a fittingly meek offering to finish a disastrous 
batting performance. That’s an innings and 80-run loss for Australia, who have 
been humiliated in Hobart. The South Africans are ecstatic and well they might 
be because they dominated this game from the very first over and deserve this 
success, which was achieved with ruthless efficiency. Australia, on the other 
hand, face a genuine crisis.
 
60th over: Australia 161-9 (Hazlewood 6, Lyon 4)

The other thing this result has done is rubbish the notion that home sides 
always dominate Test cricket. In a somewhat symbolic sight, the local 
broadcaster now pans to the Australian dressing room, where batting coach 
Graeme Hick looks on forlornly. In dining terms, he’s arrived at the buffet 
when there’s only stale garlic bread left.
 
59th over: Australia 155-9 (Hazlewood 0, Lyon 4)

“Having a break at work and thought I’d see what was happening in the cricket 
and maybe attempt to write an amusing missive,” says reader Phil Withall. 
“There appears to be no need for it. All the comedy and parody seems to be out 
there on the pitch.” Speaking of comedy, Nathan Lyon has just played the shot 
of the day, extravagantly driving Abbott to the boundary at long-off to finish 
the over.

Abbott wins the race to five wickets! And Mitchell Starc is the man to go, 
driving ambitiously and sending a thick edge through to a diving Quinton de 
Kock. See ya later. South Africa are one wicket away from an innings and 90-run 
annihilation of the Australians.
 
58th over: Australia 151-8 (Starc 0, Hazlewood 0)

“They’ve stuck their chest out and just been all over Australia,” says Shane 
Warne of the tourists. “They just don’t fear this Australian team.” He’s right, 
of course. They haven’t just been outplayed, they’ve been embarrassed on their 
home turf in the last two weeks. Pakistan must be salivating at the prospect of 
picking over this carcass. Maiden to Rabada.

 
57th over: Australia 151-8 (Starc 0, Hazlewood 0)

A certain amount of Australians have always had difficulty dealing with 
Abbott, and the Kyle variety returns here with a maiden to Starc, who can’t lay 
bat on his cutters and swervers. The only problem for South Africa right now 
are the constant injuries being picked up by Quinton de Kock, who wore a finger 
in the eye during the last round of wicket celebrations.
 
56th over: Australia 151-8 (Starc 0, Hazlewood 0)

The Rabada over ends without further incident but all of a sudden he’s got 
4-28 from 15 overs. With Kyle Abbott returning at the other end with the same 
wicket tally, it’s a race to get a five-fer now.
Dan Liebke (@LiebCricket) 
At least Australia have stopped getting out to reckless attacking shots and 
are now instead falling to reckless defensive shots.#AUSvSA

<https://twitter.com/LiebCricket/status/798319531626098690>  
Smith’s brave stand ends! It was a Border-like vigil by the Aussie skipper but 
he finally feathers an edge behind of Rabada, who a couple of balls prior had 
ruffled him with a nasty bouncer that reared up off the pitch and hammered 
Smith’s left hand. That blow clearly unsettled the batsman and his determined 
resistance comes to an end, along with any hope that Australia can fight it out 
until lunch.
 
55th over: Australia 151-7 (Smith 31, Starc 0)

Mitchell Starc is out there now and Australia still trail by 90 when Steve 
Smith nudges a single to the leg side off Philander and puts his partner on 
strike. At least the skipper can make an informed judgment on his team’s 
batting in this Test; he’s been at the other end for the fall of 13 of the 17 
wickets so far. Starc survives the over, much to the chagrin of the Proteas, 
who have come to expect total surrender now.
 
Mennie goes! There was some debate as to whether he edged it onto his toe but 
having walked across his stumps and been struck on the full, he’s a goner. 
Rabada has two in the over and Australia’s batting crisis continues. What a 
dismal showing this has been.
 
It hit him on the full, so this is a very hopeful review. Or did he hit it?
 
Nevill goes! And it’s an absolute snorter from Rabada, who gives Nevill the 
ball Callum Ferguson expected earlier. It’s short and straight and spits up 
from the pitch, arrowing in at Nevill’s face as the Australian jams his bat 
handle and gloves in the way, only to send another deflection to Duminy at 
gully. We’re officially into the tail now. This might be over by lunch.

53rd over: Australia 147-5 (Smith 27, Nevill 6)

Peter Nevill shows how it’s done, getting forward and cautiously angling 
Philander down to third man for two – the first runs to come from the paceman 
so far this morning. “This partnership needs to grow” says Michael Slater in 
the understatement of this and any other age of cricket. That’s drinks on a 
disastrous morning for the home side.
 
52nd over: Australia 145-5 (Smith 27, Nevill 4)

I know I just said it about Callum Ferguson, but at least Peter Nevill has an 
opportunity to bat for a while here, and a competent partner out there with 
him. He showed his diligence well in Perth and will be hoping to hang around 
for a similar stay here.

51st over: Australia 144-5 (Smith 27, Nevill 3)

Kyle Abbott takes a well-earned rest now but there’s no respite for the 
Australians as Vernon Philander returns for a second spell. He hasn’t taken a 
wicket this innings after five in the first, so he’s probably feeling a bit 
left out. An entire over passes without an Australian wicket falling, which is 
pretty good going for them right now.

Further reasons for cheer:

50th over: Australia 144-5 (Smith 27, Nevill 3)

It might seem a bit obvious at this point, but this is precisely happens when 
each paceman bowls in partnership with the other, applying pressure at both 
ends and forcing the issue. Too often in this game the Australians gave South 
Africa let-offs from at least one end. The bowling this morning has stifled the 
batsmen and taken advantage of the conditions. No more, no less. Kyle Abbott 
has been magnificent, and Philander nagged away constantly. Only in the latter 
stages of this Rabada over, with singles taken on a number of occasions, have 
runs been easy to come by.

Ferguson departs in similar style to Voges! Oof, that is ugly. Radada is short 
and angling it towards the Australian, and he lowers his bat and hands as he 
ducks it, but the ball never gets up as far as he expects and this time runs 
off the gloves and straight into the hands of Elgar at third slip. Place-setter 
text: Australia are collapsing.

49th over: Australia 140-4 (Smith 26, Ferguson 1)

It’s completely against the run of play and the tenor of Abbott’s spell but 
the big Protea over-pitches to Smith and gets whipped through mid-wicket for 
four, the ball flying to the fence like a tracer bullett. Smith is back and 
well across to cover an in-ducker moments later, which is a good thing because 
being well outside the line prevents an LBW shout being taken seriously, even 
by Aleem Dar.

48th over: Australia 136-4 (Smith 22, Ferguson 1)

Ferguson faced up to Rabada now and angles an edgy one into the ground before 
it reaches gully, but the South Africans react as though he’s been done in 
completely. There are three slips and a gully in place for Ferguson and he’s 
crouching low in his stance as the bowler glides in. Amid all the Australian 
chaos, Quinny de Kock is having an absolute nightmare behind the stumps because 
the ball is swerving all over the place after it passes the batsman. The poor 
bloke’s fingers will be black and blue by the afternoon.
 
47th over: Australia 136-4 (Smith 22, Ferguson 1)

This is another dire situation for Callum Ferguson in his first Test. He’s 
just watch a seasoned pro of Australian cricket (that’s Voges) depart in 
tragi-comic style and has to maintain his composure to stop a rampaging Kyle 
Abbott, who now has four wickets to his name and a serious gust of wind in his 
sails. Replays of the Voges dismissal focusing on Steve Smith’s reaction tell a 
compelling story, but at least Ferguson is off the mark with a neat flick to 
through mid-wicket. At least the South Australian has plenty of time to bat...
 
Voges departs in bizarre style! Oh my word, that is a shocker. Voges shapes to 
pull a short one from Abbott but changes his mind halfway through, stopping the 
stroke and in the process, letting the ball roll off the face of his bat and 
into the hands of Duminy at gully. What on earth was that? I’m sorry to say it, 
but that could be the kind of thing that ends the guy’s Test career. He was 
under the pump heading into this game and a dismissal like this does him no 
favours.

46th over: Australia 135-3 (Smith 22, Voges 2)

Kagiso Rabada appears now to replace Vernon Philander and here’s an 
interesting stat: of the seven umpiring decisions overturned in this game, six 
of the mistakes have belonged to Aleem Dar. It’s not just Australia’s batsmen 
who’ve struggled at Bellerive. Rabada starts solidly enough, cutting one back 
into Voges’ pads and attracting half a shout for LBW. Voges edges leans into an 
edgy forward defence for one to get off strike, and it’s is the only run of the 
over.

45th over: Australia 134-3 (Smith 22, Voges 1)

The South Africans can’t believe Smith didn’t hit it but get back to the task 
immediately and Abbott in particular is applying himself to it with vigour, 
cutting and swerving the ball with unerring accuracy and causing Smith constant 
worry. Survival is the batsman’s only priority right now, such is the quality 
of this bowling spell. Finally Smith unshackles himself by firmly planting his 
back foot and pouncing on some width to crack an attractive drive to the fence 
through deep extra cover. This is an absorbing passage of Test cricket.

Aleem Dar has had another shocker here as replays confirm it was a case of bat 
on pad, so the Australian skipper gets a reprieve. This has been a bad Test for 
Dar. As tough as his job is, he’s got a lot of these ones wrong in Hobart.
 
And he’s adamant it wasn’t an edge, calling for the review straight away and 
shaking his head at Aleem Dar.
 
44th over: Australia 130-3 (Smith 18, Voges 1)

Adam Voges adopts the same approach as Steve Smith and marks his guard a 
decent way down the track to Philander, though not quite as far away from the 
crease as his partner. Voges is a model of patience and technique as he 
smothers the ball in his forward defence but the South Africans are full of 
voice in the field and expecting a chance at any moment.

43rd over: Australia 130-3 (Smith 18, Voges 1)

Voges avoids the king pair with an emphatic forward defence to Abbott but the 
South Africans sniff blood here and coo away in response to every delivery from 
the burly paceman. Standing at second slip, Proteas skipper Faf du Plessis 
looks like an SAS Commando on recreational leave, grinning broadly as Voges 
assesses whether or not Abbott’s in-duckers are about to take his off stump. 
The Australian gets off the mark with a thick edge wide of gully, but it’s not 
the nerve-settling start he probably wants. As the over ends Australia still 
trail by 111 and Abbott is screaming for an LBW chance that hits Smith well 
outside the line.
 
42nd over: Australia 129-3 (Smith 18, Voges 0)

Nervous times here for Adam Voges, though thankfully for him Khawaja fell on 
the final delivery of the Abbott over, meaning Steve Smith takes strike to 
Philander to start with. Voges got an absolute peach in the first innings, 
edging behind for a golden duck. At least he’s able to acclimatise himself a 
little at the non-striker’s end here. There’s a little battle developing 
between Smith and Philander, who is bowling the odd straight one at the Aussie 
skipper, which introduces a bit of variety. The last ball of the over cuts in a 
mile and raps Smith on the thigh. South Africa are buoyant now. Voges is fresh 
at the crease and Smith is struggling just a little.
 
Khawaja nicks behind and departs! Well, I’d just been crafting a long 
paragraph predicting that Khawaja might soon provide a chance for a relaxed and 
jovial-looking South African cordon and off the final ball of the Abbott over 
he does it, swiping lazily at a short one that angled away from him. He’d 
wafted away a couple of times earlier in the over and departs to give the 
Proteas an ideal start to the morning. Stand by, Australia, this might get ugly 
from here.

40th over: Australia 123-2 (Khawaja 58, Smith 18)

Steve Smith is batting a good half-metre out of his crease now with Vernon 
Philander charging in, attempting to break up the bowler’s metronomic line and 
length. There’s a hairy moment when Smith half-plays and half-leaves, just sort 
of dangling his bat out as the ball passes, but the batsman gets back on track 
with an emphatic drive that’s cut off well by Dean Elgar. Another maiden for 
Philander.
 
39th over: Australia 123-2 (Khawaja 58, Smith 18)

Another item of note: I could be wrong, but there seems to be more people on 
the field than in the stands to start the day, not entirely unexpected on a 
chilly Tuesday in Hobart but a distinctly ‘Sheffield Shield’ sight. Khawaja 
gets moving with a gentle drive for two through cover but it’s the only damage 
in the Abbott over, which is probably a bit too straight.
 
38th over: Australia 121-2 (Khawaja 56, Smith 18)

Faf du Plessis might have been tempted to unleash Kagiso Rabada first thing up 
but Vernon Philander pulls rank to pair with Abbott. His first ball comes down 
at a nagging line and length and wobbles away just a little as Steve Smith 
smothers it with an exaggerated forward defence.

A ball later he’s causing greater trouble for his keeper Quinton de Kock than 
Smith, because some late swing once the ball passes the batsman means de Kock 
is hammered on his ‘good’ thumb in an awkward moment. He shakes the injured 
hand vigorously and mouths a few a choice words at himself. Now he’s perfectly 
balanced with pain in both thumbs. Smith sees off another maiden, perhaps 
signalling his intent for the day.
 
37th over: Australia 121-2 (Khawaja 56, Smith 18)

OK, we’re off and away on day four and it’s Kyle Abbott charging in for the 
Proteas and Usman Khawaja on strike. The first one is back of a length and 
straight and Khawaja is quickly back and defending with a straight bat. The 
next is trickier, slanting across him and moving away appreciably once it hits 
the deck, so much so the batsman’s overcommitted prod of the bat gets nowhere 
near it. It’s a testing first over from Abbott, made more threatening by 
Khawaja’s unwillingness to move his feet. Khawaja almost ‘does a Burns’ down 
the leg side but it’s all thigh pad. All up it’s a super start from Abbott and 
a lethargic one for Khawaja.

Vic Marks has an interesting take on England and India’s recent Test in 
Rajkot, which saw the home side gain an ascendancy that displeased Indian 
skipper Virat Kohli. More from Vic below:

“But in Rajkot there was a departure from the usual pattern, which did not 
much please India’s captain, Virat Kohli. There was live grass on the pitch, 
which helped to bind the surface together. “It should not have been the case,” 
he said emphatically afterwards. He has obviously glanced at the history books 
as well.”

Two misfires in his most recent Shield game didn’t deter selectors, but a

Pietersen, who is currently towering over Ian Chappell in the middle of the 
ground. It’s certainly far more straw-coloured than it was early in the game, 
so perhaps in better shape for batting than during Australia’s first innings. 
If the rain stays away today, Australia will at least have conditions on their 
side.
 
Preamble

Hello and welcome to day four of the second Test in Hobart, in which the home 
side are hoping to make South Africa bat again but currently stand only a small 
chance of actually making a game of it. Australian batsmen Usman Khawaja (56 
not out) and Steve Smith (18) start the day 120 in arrears of the Proteas’ 
first innings total and their team has eight wickets in hand. I’m not a betting 
man, but it’ll be a tall order for them to set a target that will trouble the 
tourists.

Russell Jackson here taking you through all the action throughout the day, and 
as I tap away at this introduction I’m watching ‘Baby John’ Burgess and Richard 
Wilkins spinning a very homemade-looking Wheel of Fortune wheel on the local 
broadcaster. If that’s not a symbol of Australia’s decline, I’m not sure what 
is.

The weather news in Hobart? Skies are currently clear, there’s a light 
westerly breeze and only a 30% chance of rain in the morning according to the 
Bureau of Meteorology. I like those odds.
 
Russell will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s what happened yesterday:
