that a website doesn’t require a login with every visit. The faked cookies

believes the hacks are connected and that the breaches are “state-sponsored”.

The Yahoo hack is the latest to compromise massive amounts of user data. Over 
the last few years companies like MySpace, Tumblr, TalkTalk and Ashley Madison
