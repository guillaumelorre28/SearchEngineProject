 * Donald Trump was accused by the Clinton campaign of “unhinged

” behaviour toward a formerMiss Universe winner

 today after he fired off a tirade of personal attacks against her in the 
middle of the night. Launching the fourth day of a war of words against Alicia 
Machado that is causing consternation among Republicans, the party’s candidate 
accused Machado of having a “disgusting” past after she criticised his attitude 
toward women. 
 * In a deposition released on this afternoon, Donald Trump acknowledged that 
his infamous statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president>
 that Mexico was deliberately sending rapists into the United States wasplanned 
in advance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/trump-comments-mexico-rapists-planned-deposition-video>
. In testifying in June in an ongoing court case, prompted when restaurateur 
Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out of a lease in Trump’s Washington hotel after the 
presidential candidate’s remarks caused a national furor, Trump insisted his 
comments were not ad-libbed. However, he made clear that they weren’t scripted 
and said that he did not anticipate any damage to his brand.

 * In a meeting with reporters, Clinton communications director Jennifer 
Palmieri ties Trump’s attacks on Alicia Machado following this week’s debate to 
his attacks on Fox host Megyn Kelly after a debate 14 months ago. Palmieri also 
denied Trump’s wild accusation that Clinton or her campaign had helped Machado 
gain American citizenship, and Palmieri said that Clinton would likely address 
Trump’s latest attack this afternoon at her rally in Coral Springs. “This is 
our opponent. This is who we’re running against. This is our reality,” Palmieri 
said. 
 * Onetime presidential candidate and former House speaker Newt Gingrich 
compared Hillary Clinton’s citing of Donald Trump’s history of racist and 
misogynistic comments toward a Venezuelan pageant queen to Clinton’s handling 
of the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. “This is the new Benghazi 
lie,” Gingrich told Sean Hannity on his eponymous radio show,first reported by 
Buzzfeed News

Trump may be trying to spin last night’s 3am Twitter meltdown as proof that 
he’s got the stamina to be president - “at least you know I will be there, 
awake, to answer the call!” he tweeted - but Twitter is providing some pretty 
hilarious rebuttals.

Donald Trump made cameo in softcore pornographic film in 2000

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s distaste for former Miss 
Universe Alicia Machado’s alleged appearance in a nonexistent sex tape appears 
to run counter to his own background,according to a report from Buzzfeed News 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-appeared-in-a-2000-playboy-softcore-porn?utm_term=.wgMK3K5zLW#.pyQjnjm54p>
: Trump appeared as himself in a softcore girl-on-girl pornographic film 
produced by Playboy in 2000.

Trump’s (clothed) role in the Playboy Video Centerfold film features him 
opening a bottle of champagne and pouring its contents on a Playboy-branded 
limousine and welcoming a bevvy of Playboy playmates to New York City.

“Beauty is beauty, and let’s see what happens with New York,” Trump says in 
the film.

According to Buzzfeed News, the rest of the film isn’t so PG:

Other scenes from the film feature fully nude women posing in sexual 
positions, dancing naked, touching themselves while naked, touching each other 
sensually, rubbing honey on themselves, taking a bath, and dressing in costumes.

The VHS cover of the video reads: ‘From luxuriating in a warm, soapy tub, to 
reveling at an exclusive night club, Carol and Darlene bare their sex appeal 
and lead you on a sensual journey of discovery.’

Hacked audio recording: Hillary Clinton sees herself as 'center-left to 
center-right'

According to a hacked recording of a conversation with campaign donors at a 
private event in February,according to the Intercept 
<https://theintercept.com/2016/09/30/hillary-clinton-center-right/>, Democratic 
presidential nominee Hillary Clinton described herself as “center-left to the 
center-right” as far as how she fits on the political spectrum, a position that 
will likely not endear her to the liberal Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic 
party ahead of the election.

On the other side, there’s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free 
college, free healthcare, that what we’ve done hasn’t gone far enough, and that 
we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that 
means, and half the people don’t know what that means, but it’s something that 
they deeply feel.

So as a friend of mine said the other day, I am occupying from the center-left 
to the center-right. And I don’t have much company there. Because it is 
difficult when you’re running to be president, and you understand how hard the 
job is - I don’t want to overpromise. I don’t want to tell people things that I 
know we cannot do.

In a deposition released on Friday afternoon, Donald Trump acknowledged that 
his infamous statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president>
 that Mexico was deliberately sending rapists into the United States was 
planned in advance.

In testifying in June in an ongoing court case, prompted when restaurateur 
Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out of a lease in Trump’s Washington hotel after the 
presidential candidate’s remarks caused a national furor, Trump insisted his 
comments were not ad-libbed. However, he made clear that they weren’t scripted 
and said that he did not anticipate any damage to his brand.

In the aftermath of the comments, which came when Trump announced his 
candidacy on 16 June 2015, the real estate developer saw a number of former 
business partners pull out of commercial enterprises with himincluding Macy’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/macys-fires-donald-trump-mexico>
 andUnivision 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/univision-donald-trump-miss-universe-mexican-immigrants>
. In addition to Zakarian, chef José Andrés also pulled out of a planned 
restaurant project in the same hotel.

The multi-hour deposition was released by a court order on Friday after a 
number of organizations,led by Buzzfeed 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/danielwagner/trump-video-depositions?utm_term=.hgj07DgZE#.bwnApgKbm>
, sued to have the video unsealed. Trump insisted that his comments should not 
be controversial because “I’ve been making this statement for many years. This 
is not just new.” He also insisted that he thought his candidacy would draw 
more Hispanic customers than otherwise, insisting: “I think you will get more 
business. I think you’ll get more business,” although he acknowledged “it’s 
always possible” that some might not patronize his hotel as a result.

Newt Gingrich compares Clinton's citing of former Miss Universe to Benghazi

Onetime presidential candidate and former House speaker Newt Gingrich compared 
Hillary Clinton’s citing of Donald Trump’s history of racist and misogynistic 
comments toward a Venezuelan pageant queen to Clinton’s handling of the 
terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.

“This is the new Benghazi lie,” Gingrich told Sean Hannity on his eponymous 
radio show,first reported by Buzzfeed News 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/newt-gingrich-alicia-machado-is-the-new-benghazi-lie?utm_term=.xggp6pdMPz#.qhR3N3x2nr>
.

“What Hillary tried to set up and what they apparently spent months preparing 
is an ambush as false as Benghazi,” Gingrich continued. “It was as false as her 
claim she was under fire in in Bosnia. It was as false as the lies she told on 
her emails. The elite media, which is Clinton, I mean, they totally identify 
with her, they took it hook, line and sinker.”

During Monday night’s debate, Clinton made Trump’s past remarks about Machado 
a centerpiece of their first televised clash,citing the name-calling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends>
 – in particular, Trump calling her “Miss Housekeeping” in reference to her 
Latina origins – as a prime example of her opponent’s demeaning views about 
women.

“They clearly had set it up to be triggered at the debate,” Gingrich 
continued. “At the last minute, Hillary suddenly realizes she hasn’t gotten it 
in yet, so you have this total detour to make sure she has gotten the story 
planted so all that all the news media that are lined up - all of it’s 
embargoed, all of it’s sitting there waiting.”

Speaking in Coral Springs, Florida, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> told the audience 
that Donald Trump’s late-night tweetstorm encouraging American voters to watch 
a nonexistent sex tape of a Venezuelan pageant queen with whom he has been 
engaged in a feud is evidence that he is “unhinged” and temperamentally unfit 
to serve as president.

“Who gets up at three o’clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack 
against the former Miss Universe?” Clinton asked incredulously.

“Why does he do things like that?” she continued. “I mean, his latest Twitter 
meltdown is unhinged, even for him. It proves, yet again, that he is 
temperamentally unfit to be president and commander in chief. I have said it 
before and I’ll say it again: a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not 
be anywhere near the nuclear codes.”

denied Trump’s wild accusation that Clinton or her campaign had helped Machado 
gain American citizenship, and Palmieri said that Clinton would likely address 
Trump’s latest attack this afternoon at her rally in Coral Springs. “This is 
our opponent. This is who we’re running against. This is our reality,” Palmieri

Trump may be trying to spin last night’s 3am Twitter meltdown as proof that 
he’s got the stamina to be president - “at least you know I will be there, 
awake, to answer the call!” he tweeted - but Twitter is providing some pretty 
hilarious rebuttals.

to run counter to his own background,according to a report from Buzzfeed News

: Trump appeared as himself in a softcore girl-on-girl pornographic film 
produced by Playboy in 2000.

Trump’s (clothed) role in the Playboy Video Centerfold film features him 
opening a bottle of champagne and pouring its contents on a Playboy-branded 
limousine and welcoming a bevvy of Playboy playmates to New York City.

“Beauty is beauty, and let’s see what happens with New York,” Trump says in 
the film.

According to Buzzfeed News, the rest of the film isn’t so PG:

Other scenes from the film feature fully nude women posing in sexual 
positions, dancing naked, touching themselves while naked, touching each other 
sensually, rubbing honey on themselves, taking a bath, and dressing in costumes.

The VHS cover of the video reads: ‘From luxuriating in a warm, soapy tub, to 
reveling at an exclusive night club, Carol and Darlene bare their sex appeal 
and lead you on a sensual journey of discovery.’
 
According to a hacked recording of a conversation with campaign donors at a 
private event in February,according to the Intercept 
<https://theintercept.com/2016/09/30/hillary-clinton-center-right/>, Democratic 
presidential nominee Hillary Clinton described herself as “center-left to the 
center-right” as far as how she fits on the political spectrum, a position that 
will likely not endear her to the liberal Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic 
party ahead of the election.

On the other side, there’s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free 
college, free healthcare, that what we’ve done hasn’t gone far enough, and that 
we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that 
means, and half the people don’t know what that means, but it’s something that 
they deeply feel.

So as a friend of mine said the other day, I am occupying from the center-left 
to the center-right. And I don’t have much company there. Because it is 
difficult when you’re running to be president, and you understand how hard the 
job is - I don’t want to overpromise. I don’t want to tell people things that I 
know we cannot do.

 that Mexico was deliberately sending rapists into the United States was

In testifying in June in an ongoing court case, prompted when restaurateur 
Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out of a lease in Trump’s Washington hotel after the 
presidential candidate’s remarks caused a national furor, Trump insisted his 
comments were not ad-libbed. However, he made clear that they weren’t scripted 
and said that he did not anticipate any damage to his brand.

In the aftermath of the comments, which came when Trump announced his 
candidacy on 16 June 2015, the real estate developer saw a number of former 
business partners pull out of commercial enterprises with himincluding Macy’s

. In addition to Zakarian, chef José Andrés also pulled out of a planned 
restaurant project in the same hotel.

The multi-hour deposition was released by a court order on Friday after a 
number of organizations,led by Buzzfeed 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/danielwagner/trump-video-depositions?utm_term=.hgj07DgZE#.bwnApgKbm>
, sued to have the video unsealed. Trump insisted that his comments should not 
be controversial because “I’ve been making this statement for many years. This 
is not just new.” He also insisted that he thought his candidacy would draw 
more Hispanic customers than otherwise, insisting: “I think you will get more 
business. I think you’ll get more business,” although he acknowledged “it’s 
always possible” that some might not patronize his hotel as a result.

Onetime presidential candidate and former House speaker Newt Gingrich compared 
Hillary Clinton’s citing of Donald Trump’s history of racist and misogynistic 
comments toward a Venezuelan pageant queen to Clinton’s handling of the 
terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.

“This is the new Benghazi lie,” Gingrich told Sean Hannity on his eponymous

<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/newt-gingrich-alicia-machado-is-the-new-benghazi-lie?utm_term=.xggp6pdMPz#.qhR3N3x2nr>
.

“What Hillary tried to set up and what they apparently spent months preparing 
is an ambush as false as Benghazi,” Gingrich continued. “It was as false as her 
claim she was under fire in in Bosnia. It was as false as the lies she told on 
her emails. The elite media, which is Clinton, I mean, they totally identify 
with her, they took it hook, line and sinker.”

During Monday night’s debate, Clinton made Trump’s past remarks about Machado 
a centerpiece of their first televised clash,citing the name-calling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends>
 – in particular, Trump calling her “Miss Housekeeping” in reference to her 
Latina origins – as a prime example of her opponent’s demeaning views about 
women.

“They clearly had set it up to be triggered at the debate,” Gingrich 
continued. “At the last minute, Hillary suddenly realizes she hasn’t gotten it 
in yet, so you have this total detour to make sure she has gotten the story 
planted so all that all the news media that are lined up - all of it’s 
embargoed, all of it’s sitting there waiting.”
