Bunty and I were busy feeding the toaster with an assortment of bakery goods - 
crumpets, pikelets, tea-cakes and so on - when George tramps in from the 
garden, leaving mud everywhere and says, ‘I’ve been having a chat with Clive - 
what do you think about going to holiday with the Ropers this summer?’ and 
quick as a wink, Bunty sticks her smile on and says, ‘The Ropers?’ as a 
tea-cake flings itself with dramatic timing out of the toaster.

This has been the most extraordinary year of literary discoveries: Sarah 
Perry’sThe Essex Serpent 
<http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2016/6/2/raspberry-and-coconut-cakes-the-essex-serpent>
, the joy ofBarbara Pym 
<http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2016/5/26/macaroni-cheese-excellent-women>
, and now Kate Atkinson. I accept that I am late to the party with this one - 
but I now have a stack of her books on my shelves, to be devoured in haste over 
the next weeks.

Behind the Scenes at the Museum is exactly the type of story I love, full of 
complex relationships, secrets and extraordinary events peppering the everyday: 
a gradually unfolding story about multiple generations in an English family. 
Our narrator, youngest child Ruby Lennox, tells her family’s story in post-war 
Britain, chapters of which are interspersed with moments in her mother, 
grandmother and great-grandmother’s young lives.

Like all my new favourites, every second page of my copy of the book is now 
dog-eared, noting references to food. My recipe this week could have been for 
scones, forfish and chips 
<http://thelittlelibrarycafe.com/blog/2016/4/5/fish-and-chips-the-bear-nobody-wanted>
 (which the characters eat in almost every chapter), for sherry-laced Christmas 
trifle or for a Sunday roast. But I came across these tea-cakes, making a bid 
for freedom from the toaster. I was halfway through a cup of Yorkshire tea at 
the time, and had spent the weekend working on a sweetened dough recipe for the 
book. Still not bored with slow-rising dough and dried fruit, I fancied a batch 
of these.

Tea-cakes are, of course, readily accessible in supermarkets, but they’re also 
a breeze to make. Though you’ll need to dedicate a couple of hours to rising 
time, this isn’t ‘work’ as such - the cakes did their first rise while I was 
doing the nanny-run to school, and the second while the kids’ dinner was in the 
oven. Apart from the initial knead (which you can do with a dough hook if you 
prefer), they need very little attention; this soft, buttery dough is happy to 
get on with a rise while you get on with other things. And, fresh from the 
toaster, spread generously with butter, they are more than worth the time.

Tea-Cakes

Makes 8

Ingredients 
120g sultanas 
250ml water 
1 cinnamon stick 
2 strong black tea bags (Yorkshire tea is ideal) 
350g strong white bread flour 
7g flaky sea salt 
40g caster sugar 
1/2tsp ground cinnamon 
10g dried active yeast 
225ml body temperature water
 35g unsalted butter 
Egg, to glaze

Equipment 
Large bowl 
Jug 
Small saucepan 
Sieve 
Rolling pin 
Greaseproof paper 
Baking tray

1. Put the sultanas, water and cinnamon stick in the saucepan, and bring to 
the boil. Add the tea bags and simmer on a low heat for ten minutes. Take them 
off the heat and allow them to infuse while you get on with the dough.

2. Put the yeast, water and sugar in the jug, stir it and set aside until you 
can see bubbles on top of the water. Meanwhile, put the flour, sea salt and 
cinnamon in the bowl, and mix together by hand. Slowly pour in the yeasty 
water, mixing with your hand to bring the dough together. Start kneading on a 
clean bench. Once the dough has come together completely, add the butter to it. 
Continue to knead for around ten minutes, until the dough is soft, very smooth 
and elastic. Put the dough in a clean bowl, cover and allow to double in size 
(this will take an hour or so, depending on how warm your kitchen is).

3. Strain the sultanas and dry on a paper towel. Knead the sultanas into the 
dough, ensuring they are relatively evenly distributed. Split the dough into 
eight even pieces, and roll each piece into a ball. Flatten the balls to around 
1cm thick, and place on a lined baking tray to rise again. Repeat with the 
other balls. Ensure the tea-cakes have space between them to spread a little. 
Cover them again, and allow them to double in size (again, this will take about 
an hour).

4. After around half an hour of this final rise, heat your oven to 200C (fan). 
Once the dough has risen, brush the top of each with a little beaten egg, and 
transfer the tray to the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the tea-cakes are 
browned. Eat them immediately or, even better, the next day, toasted and spread 
with plenty of butter.
