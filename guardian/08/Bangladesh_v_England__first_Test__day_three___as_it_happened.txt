Broad gets forward as Shakib returns and looks like he might have edged that

75th over: England 228-3 (Woakes 11, Broad 11) Chris Woakes looking to give 
Bangladesh a few jabs in the ribs before stumps. He frustrates Mushfiqur with a 
ramp sweep on the leg side which brings two runs.

74th over: England 226-8 (Woakes 9, Broad 10) A surprise six from that over, 
as Broad sweeps around the corner – the ball racing fine as most around the bat 
appeal rather than chase it.

73rd over: England 220-8 (Woakes 8, Broad 5) Shakib’s work today is done and 
Taijul Islam comes in to replace him. It’s a mixed bag of flat and flighted 
deliveries, but Woakes and Broad are eyeing heavily armoured bus back to the 
hotel.

70th over: England 214-8 (Woakes 7, Broad 0) Diligent from Broad, given the 
strike after three balls as Woakes runs one down to third man. Don’t really 
know how these two should play this. Hold firm till stumps or try and pick up, 
say, three an over?

WICKET! Rashid LBW Shakib 9 (England 213-8)

That’s a very good review from Bangladesh and Mushfiqur Rahim. The ball did 
indeed strike pad first, before bat, and ball-tracking shows that not only was 
the impact in line, but the ball would have gone on to hit middle stump.

REVIEW...

Rashid gets forward and defends the ball back down the pitch which draws a 
belated appeal... The fielders are convinced the ball struck pad first. It’s 
sent upstairs...

Though even he, in this mood, can’t summon anything worthwhile from the middle 
of the pitch as a short ball is played easily to square leg for another run to 
Rashid.

67th over: England 211-7 (Rashid 8, Woakes 5) He might have four wickets, but 
Shakib has bowled as poorly as I can remember. There are certainly more 
long-hops that usual and Rashid pounces on one of them to test the strength of 
the advertising boards at midwicket.

66th over: England 205-7 (Rashid 4, Woakes 5) I’ve been critical of Kamrul 
Islam, but he looks a threat with the ball moving into the right-hander late. 
While Woakes keeps out most, he doesn’t do so well with the final delivery and 
is lucky not to be on his way as his inside edge is found. Luckily, the stumps 
remain undisturbed and the ball races away for four.

65th over: England 201-7 (Rashid 4, Woakes 1) Not ideal for England, with two 
new batsmen in, but selfless stuff from Stokes to try and get the score moving 
along (and then for refusing to review). Adil Rashid is welcomed to the crease 
by four men around the bat and a gift of a long hop from Shakib which he 
flashes through cover for four.
Dave Tickner (@tickerscricket) 
Bit embarrassing for Stokes there, trying to review and having to be told by 
the umpire that the remaining review is, of course, Broad's.

WICKET! Stokes LBW Shakib 85 (England 197-7)

Shakib has his man – Stokes tries and fails to connect with a powerful sweep. 
Woakes implores him to review but he declines and trudges off. Some innings, 
that.

64th over: England 197-6 (Stokes 85, Woakes 1) Woakes gets off the mark first 
ball, but nearly chips to midwicket in the process. Kamrul got one to tail in, 
which Woakes jabbed down on and inadvertently chipped up in the direction of 
two catching fielders. Stokes, back on strike, tries to manufacture some runs 
on the leg side. Just one, though.

63rd over: England 195-6 (Stokes 84, Woakes 0) The first appeal in a while as 
Shakib, around the wicket to Stokes, serves up a full delivery that Stokes 
tries to sweep and misses. It hits his front pad but Mushfiqur decides not to 
review. It looked a decent shout but, maybe, it just pitched outside leg stump. 
A few more deliveries have Stokes slightly uneasy, so he responds with his 
third six of the innings, over square leg.

62nd over: England 189-6 (Stokes 78, Woakes 0) Another poor delivery from 
Kamrul Islam and Bairstow has a freebie on his pads to flick through square leg 
for four. But a few balls later, Bairstow chops on to end a superb partnership. 
Together, Stokes and Bairstow put on 127 at a rate of 3.68. Chris Woakes is the 
new man in.

WICKET! Bairstow b Kamrul 47 (England 189-6)

A wicket – where on earth did that come from? Bairstow, in an attempt to cut 
through the off side, having given himself room, chops onto his stumps. That’s 
Kamrul Islam’s first Test wicket...

60th over: England 177-5 (Stokes 76, Bairstow 37) Mushfiqur looks crestfallen 
as Kamrul Islam shoots one down on leg stump that deflects off Stokes’ pads and 
away for four leg byes. One side of the balls is a scruffy mess but there’s 
nothing through the air that suggests anything resembling reverse swing.

57th over: England 166-5 (Stokes 72, Bairstow 34) Three from the over, all 
singles, all a bit dismissive of Shakib’s nous. “A beard soaks up the sweat and 
protects you from sunburn,” writes John Starbuck, in response to Guy Hornsby’s 
Tweet in over 55. “Surprising more players don’t have them. Apart from Cookie 
of course - he just hints at one but is too cool to go the full beaver*.”

56th over: England 163-5 (Stokes 70, Bairstow 33) Exceptional pull shot from 
Stokes, as he leaps into a short ball and whips it through midwicket. I don’t 
quite know how he’s managed that.
George Dobell (@GeorgeDobell1) 
Different opinions are great and all. But anyone who doesn't rate Stokes 
really shouldn't be allowed to vote. Or drive. Or carry scissors.

It’s eased mine, too. I thought I was taking a turn on the tube in, not helped 
by a woman eating a very garlic-y sandwich close by. But this partnership has 
nourished me like a bacon sandwich washed down with full fat Coke.

54th over: England 154-5 (Stokes 64, Bairstow 31) Just excellent game 
management from these two. With so much time left in the game and England well 
ahead now, they are just preying on Bangladesh’s desperation. Shafiul Islam is 
searching for something: when he doesn’t get it wide, he tries for the stumps 
and is picked off by both for singles off the pads. Simple stuff really, which 
ties into this below...
Scott Oliver (@reverse_sweeper) 
So much Thorpe in this stand: hands down the handle, shortened backlifts, 
watchfulness, mainly content to bunt and nudge into gaps...

53rd over: England 152-5 (Stokes 63, Bairstow 31) Mahmudullah’s spell lasts 
just the one over as Shakib is back into the attack. He is over the wicket to 
Stokes and around the wicket to Bairstow. Not that it seems to matter: Stokes 
bunts him down the ground for one, before Bairstow cuts late (a touch 
streakily) for four inside third man. Tim Woollias emails in this belting start 
from TMS: “England’s 6th wicket partnership in 2016 averages 83, comfortably 
their best. Their next best is the 7th which averages 53.”

52nd over: England 147-5 (Stokes 62, Bairstow 27) A first bowl of the innings 
for Shaiful Islam. It’s not a bad move but, if you’re bringing on your 
frontline quick, why not give him a slip or two? There’s an LBW appeal – more 
desperation that anything – as Stokes moves across his stumps, with the ball 
going down leg from the hand. Bairstow, for the second time this session, gets 
a thick inside edge past his stumps for a couple. In case you missed this from 
yesterday’s play...

51st over: England 144-5 (Stokes 61, Bairstow 25) Mushfiqur, desperate for 
something, brings Mahmudullah on and, well, it’s not pretty. He gets away with 
a few horrid short balls but the third, to Stokes, is thumped through extra 
cover for four.

People who bafflingly insist Ben Stokes ain't all that and who haven't watched 
this match will later say "it's only Bangladesh", the idiots.

50th over: England 138-5 (Stokes 56, Bairstow 24) Bairstow and Stokes taking 
heed from the two previous days: this seems to be the best time of day to 
score. Without doing anything risky – and I include a reverse sweep for one in 
that – the pair pick up five from the over.

STOKES FIFTY!

49th over: England 133-5 (Stokes 53, Bairstow 22) Another short ball and 
another fine shot from Stokes – clouting the ball high over square leg for six 
to bring up his seventh half-century, this one from 102 balls. He has totally 
changed the complexion of this game, with both bat and ball. What a cricketer.
 The scorers inside the giant scoreboard would have got a good view of Stokes’ 
half-century. Photograph: A.M. Ahad/AP

46th over: England 115-5 (Stokes 35, Bairstow 21) The ball is turning and 
bouncing but Mehedi Hasan can’t quite combine the two with a decent length. 
Everything he serves up in his over is managed simply by Bairstow and Stokes.

76th over: England 228-8 (Woakes 11, Broad 10) A review and a maiden ends 
another enthralling day’s play. England and Ben Stokes’ day, that. Superb 
fightback, from start to finish. England lead by 273...
 
Broad gets forward as Shakib returns and looks like he might have edged that 
to short leg. Umpire Chris Gaffaney doesn’t think so. Mushfiqur reviews...NOT 
OUT
 
75th over: England 228-3 (Woakes 11, Broad 11) Chris Woakes looking to give 
Bangladesh a few jabs in the ribs before stumps. He frustrates Mushfiqur with a 
ramp sweep on the leg side which brings two runs.
 
74th over: England 226-8 (Woakes 9, Broad 10) A surprise six from that over, 
as Broad sweeps around the corner – the ball racing fine as most around the bat 
appeal rather than chase it.
 
73rd over: England 220-8 (Woakes 8, Broad 5) Shakib’s work today is done and 
Taijul Islam comes in to replace him. It’s a mixed bag of flat and flighted 
deliveries, but Woakes and Broad are eyeing heavily armoured bus back to the 
hotel.
 
72nd over: England 219-8 (Woakes 8, Broad 4) A maiden from Mehedi Hasan, who 
returns for an over as the sun starts to dip below a stand square of the wicket.
 
71st over: England 219-8 (Woakes 8, Broad 4) Runs it is – Woakes gives Broad 
the strike and the rangy left-hander sweeps Shakib off leg stump and into the 
boundary sponge at square leg.
 
70th over: England 214-8 (Woakes 7, Broad 0) Diligent from Broad, given the 
strike after three balls as Woakes runs one down to third man. Don’t really 
know how these two should play this. Hold firm till stumps or try and pick up, 
say, three an over?

69th over: England 213-8 (Woakes 6, Broad 0) That’s Shakib Al Hasan’s 15th 
five-wicket haul. Rashid had looked comfortable defending albeit with a very 
pre-DRS method.

<https://twitter.com/FactDeJour/status/789782964460621825> 
Had to Google where Curaçao is and now I *really* hate you, Harry. 
 
That’s a very good review from Bangladesh and Mushfiqur Rahim. The ball did 
indeed strike pad first, before bat, and ball-tracking shows that not only was 
the impact in line, but the ball would have gone on to hit middle stump.
 
Rashid gets forward and defends the ball back down the pitch which draws a 
belated appeal... The fielders are convinced the ball struck pad first. It’s 
sent upstairs...
 
68th over: England 213-7 (Rashid 9, Woakes 6) Woakes *just* manages to keep 
out a searing yorker from Kamrul, who is really building up a head of steam. 
Though even he, in this mood, can’t summon anything worthwhile from the middle 
of the pitch as a short ball is played easily to square leg for another run to 
Rashid.
 
67th over: England 211-7 (Rashid 8, Woakes 5) He might have four wickets, but 
Shakib has bowled as poorly as I can remember. There are certainly more 
long-hops that usual and Rashid pounces on one of them to test the strength of 
the advertising boards at midwicket.
 
66th over: England 205-7 (Rashid 4, Woakes 5) I’ve been critical of Kamrul 
Islam, but he looks a threat with the ball moving into the right-hander late. 
While Woakes keeps out most, he doesn’t do so well with the final delivery and 
is lucky not to be on his way as his inside edge is found. Luckily, the stumps 
remain undisturbed and the ball races away for four.
 
65th over: England 201-7 (Rashid 4, Woakes 1) Not ideal for England, with two 
new batsmen in, but selfless stuff from Stokes to try and get the score moving 
along (and then for refusing to review). Adil Rashid is welcomed to the crease 
by four men around the bat and a gift of a long hop from Shakib which he 
flashes through cover for four.
Dave Tickner (@tickerscricket) 
Bit embarrassing for Stokes there, trying to review and having to be told by 
the umpire that the remaining review is, of course, Broad's.
 <https://twitter.com/tickerscricket/status/789778923072749568> October 22, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/tickerscricket/status/789778923072749568>  
Shakib has his man – Stokes tries and fails to connect with a powerful sweep. 
Woakes implores him to review but he declines and trudges off. Some innings, 
that.
 
64th over: England 197-6 (Stokes 85, Woakes 1) Woakes gets off the mark first 
ball, but nearly chips to midwicket in the process. Kamrul got one to tail in, 
which Woakes jabbed down on and inadvertently chipped up in the direction of 
two catching fielders. Stokes, back on strike, tries to manufacture some runs 
on the leg side. Just one, though.
 
63rd over: England 195-6 (Stokes 84, Woakes 0) The first appeal in a while as 
Shakib, around the wicket to Stokes, serves up a full delivery that Stokes 
tries to sweep and misses. It hits his front pad but Mushfiqur decides not to 
review. It looked a decent shout but, maybe, it just pitched outside leg stump. 
A few more deliveries have Stokes slightly uneasy, so he responds with his 
third six of the innings, over square leg.
 
62nd over: England 189-6 (Stokes 78, Woakes 0) Another poor delivery from 
Kamrul Islam and Bairstow has a freebie on his pads to flick through square leg 
for four. But a few balls later, Bairstow chops on to end a superb partnership. 
Together, Stokes and Bairstow put on 127 at a rate of 3.68. Chris Woakes is the 
new man in.
 
A wicket – where on earth did that come from? Bairstow, in an attempt to cut 
through the off side, having given himself room, chops onto his stumps. That’s 
Kamrul Islam’s first Test wicket...

61st over: England 183-5 (Stokes 77, Bairstow 42) Bangladesh are going very 
defensive but still, with pace off the ball, Bairstow manages to force a short 
length ball through midwicket for four.

60th over: England 177-5 (Stokes 76, Bairstow 37) Mushfiqur looks crestfallen 
as Kamrul Islam shoots one down on leg stump that deflects off Stokes’ pads and 
away for four leg byes. One side of the balls is a scruffy mess but there’s 
nothing through the air that suggests anything resembling reverse swing.
 
59th over: England 172-5 (Stokes 75, Bairstow 37) Some much needed drinks and 
these two are back at it, running briskly between the wickets to take four 
comfortable singles.

58th over: England 168-5 (Stokes 73, Bairstow 35) Karum Islam is back into the 
attack as part of Mushfiqur’s Bowling Attack Roulette. Unfortunately for 
Mushfiqur, all the chambers are empty.

57th over: England 166-5 (Stokes 72, Bairstow 34) Three from the over, all 
singles, all a bit dismissive of Shakib’s nous. “A beard soaks up the sweat and 
protects you from sunburn,” writes John Starbuck, in response to Guy Hornsby’s 
Tweet in over 55. “Surprising more players don’t have them. Apart from Cookie 
of course - he just hints at one but is too cool to go the full beaver*.”
 
56th over: England 163-5 (Stokes 70, Bairstow 33) Exceptional pull shot from 
Stokes, as he leaps into a short ball and whips it through midwicket. I don’t 
quite know how he’s managed that.
George Dobell (@GeorgeDobell1) 
Different opinions are great and all. But anyone who doesn't rate Stokes 
really shouldn't be allowed to vote. Or drive. Or carry scissors.

55th over: England 156-5 (Stokes 65, Bairstow 33) Good footwork from both 
batsmen see them use the crease to good effect.
Guy Hornsby (@GuyHornsby) 
Super Test match @Vitu_E <https://twitter.com/Vitu_E>. Making my sizeable 
hangover ease slowly. Though how on earth Bairstow can sport a beard in this 
heat is beyond me.

<https://twitter.com/GuyHornsby/status/789764728679723008> 
It’s eased mine, too. I thought I was taking a turn on the tube in, not helped 
by a woman eating a very garlic-y sandwich close by. But this partnership has 
nourished me like a bacon sandwich washed down with full fat Coke.
 
54th over: England 154-5 (Stokes 64, Bairstow 31) Just excellent game 
management from these two. With so much time left in the game and England well 
ahead now, they are just preying on Bangladesh’s desperation. Shafiul Islam is 
searching for something: when he doesn’t get it wide, he tries for the stumps 
and is picked off by both for singles off the pads. Simple stuff really, which 
ties into this below...
Scott Oliver (@reverse_sweeper) 
So much Thorpe in this stand: hands down the handle, shortened backlifts, 
watchfulness, mainly content to bunt and nudge into gaps...

2016 <https://twitter.com/reverse_sweeper/status/789764221546430464>  
53rd over: England 152-5 (Stokes 63, Bairstow 31) Mahmudullah’s spell lasts 
just the one over as Shakib is back into the attack. He is over the wicket to 
Stokes and around the wicket to Bairstow. Not that it seems to matter: Stokes 
bunts him down the ground for one, before Bairstow cuts late (a touch 
streakily) for four inside third man. Tim Woollias emails in this belting start 
from TMS: “England’s 6th wicket partnership in 2016 averages 83, comfortably 
their best. Their next best is the 7th which averages 53.”
 
52nd over: England 147-5 (Stokes 62, Bairstow 27) A first bowl of the innings 
for Shaiful Islam. It’s not a bad move but, if you’re bringing on your 
frontline quick, why not give him a slip or two? There’s an LBW appeal – more 
desperation that anything – as Stokes moves across his stumps, with the ball 
going down leg from the hand. Bairstow, for the second time this session, gets 
a thick inside edge past his stumps for a couple. In case you missed this from 
yesterday’s play...

51st over: England 144-5 (Stokes 61, Bairstow 25) Mushfiqur, desperate for 
something, brings Mahmudullah on and, well, it’s not pretty. He gets away with 
a few horrid short balls but the third, to Stokes, is thumped through extra 
cover for four.
Dave Tickner (@tickerscricket) 
People who bafflingly insist Ben Stokes ain't all that and who haven't watched

50th over: England 138-5 (Stokes 56, Bairstow 24) Bairstow and Stokes taking 
heed from the two previous days: this seems to be the best time of day to 
score. Without doing anything risky – and I include a reverse sweep for one in 
that – the pair pick up five from the over.
 
49th over: England 133-5 (Stokes 53, Bairstow 22) Another short ball and 
another fine shot from Stokes – clouting the ball high over square leg for six 
to bring up his seventh half-century, this one from 102 balls. He has totally 
changed the complexion of this game, with both bat and ball. What a cricketer.
 The scorers inside the giant scoreboard would have got a good view of Stokes’ 
half-century. Photograph: A.M. Ahad/AP  
48th over: England 125-5 (Stokes 46, Bairstow 21) Another boundary to Stokes, 
this one biffed crisply through midwicket as Mehedi bowls a real horrible long 
hop.
 
47th over: England 120-5 (Stokes 41, Bairstow 21) Delicately done by Stokes, 
as he gets on one knee with the impetuousness of a trigger happy wannabe fiancé 
and flicks Taijul over his right shoulder for four.
 
46th over: England 115-5 (Stokes 35, Bairstow 21) The ball is turning and 
bouncing but Mehedi Hasan can’t quite combine the two with a decent length. 
Everything he serves up in his over is managed simply by Bairstow and Stokes.
 
45th over: England 114-5 (Stokes 35, Bairstow 21) Taijul Islam from the other 
end, as the crowds come in with the sun at its most bearable. Bairstow’s 
sweeping has reminded me of Matthew Hayden, who struggled in India and 
rectified the matter by perfecting the sweep then using it to quell Harbhajan 
Singh. Also, if you’re not checked outHayden’s website 
<http://www.matthewhayden.com/>, you should. It’s a treat.
