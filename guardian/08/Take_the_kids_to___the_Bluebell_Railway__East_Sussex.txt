In a nutshell 
The UK’s first standard gauge heritage railway opened in 1960. Extended to 
connect with mainline trains at East Grinstead in 2013, it puffs 11 miles 
through Sussex countryside to Sheffield Park stopping at Horsted Keynes and 
Kingscote. The journey takes 40 minutes each way with a wait in the middle – 
enough time to explore the Carriage Workshop at Horsted Keynes and have a 
picnic. There’s a grassy picnic area fringed with woodland just up from the 
station with picnic tables.Children’s week 
<http://www.bluebell-railway.com/event/childrens-week/> (August 1-7) features 
donkey rides, circus workshops and Punch and Judy shows.

Fun fact 
One of the carriages being restored in the workshop was originally used by a 
travelling circus to transport elephants.

 ‘Is this my carriage?’ … the Bluebell Railway isn’t just for adult steamheads 
Best thing(s) about it? 
This is time travel – old-style stations, uniforms, locos and carriages. 
Chuffing through the Sussex Weald, people waving as you pass, offers a real 
sense of theatre. Joseph (aged 5) loved exploring the huge loco sheds, seeing 
ancient carriages being restored, dressing up as a driver and pulling levers in 
the signal box. Friendly volunteer staff bring the place alive.

What about lunch? 
Good-value pub grub (pie and chips £8.40, veggie lasagne £6.95) at the 
Bessemer Arms <http://www.bessemersheffield.co.uk/>. Reasonably priced snacks 
from the station cafes at Horsted Keynes and Kingscote. Tea carriage at East 
Grinstead. Grassy picnic areas at all stations except East Grinstead. The 
train’s buffet car serves coffee, wine and cakes.

Exit through the gift shop? 
There’s one at Sheffield Park but it’s aimed at rail enthusiasts more than 
kids. You can use the platform exit if you prefer.

Getting there 
Easy car access to Sheffield Park and East Grinstead. Or take the train to 
East Grinstead from London Victoria.

Value for money? 
For unlimited travel, access to loco sheds and museum it’s decent value: adult 
£17, child £8.50, family £45.50. In children’s week, kids’ tickets cost £1.

Verdict 
8/10
