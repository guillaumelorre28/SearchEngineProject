Jackson’s Cabin, East Sussex

What was once a honey farm is now a honeypot for in the far east of the South 
Downs. The large one-bedroom cabin has smart modern interiors but plenty of 
rustic character (there’s a wood-burning stove, a partially timber-clad 
bathroom and original artwork on the walls; the owner is an artist and also 
runs painting holidays). It’s in a peaceful spot nearAlfriston 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/18/flint-barns-rathfinny-estate-alfriston-east-sussex-hotel-review>
, close to a network of scenic walking routes and an easy cycle ride from the 
nearest beach. When you’ve finished exploring, sit on the terrace with a glass 
of Nutbourne’s Sussex Reserve, soaking up uninterrupted views of the Cuckmere 
valley’s flower-speckled chalk grasslands and the Long Man of Wilmington. For 
field-to-fork dining, the Sussex Ox <http://www.thesussexox.co.uk/> pub is an 
amble away and serves beef, lamb and vegetables from its own organic farm.

Glamping can mean nothing more than a large tent with a bed. The Gathering is 
different. The five tents at this new Peak District glampsite come with Hypnos 
mattresses, merino wool blankets, hot water bottles, wood-fired stoves, 
roll-top baths and such civilised extras as fresh croissants in the morning and 
deliveries of ice and lemon for evening drinks. The setting is pretty 
cosseting, too: just outside Edale, at the start of the Pennine Way. Each tent 
has views of Grindslow Knoll, a hill linked to Kinder Scout – encouragement to 
set out on one of myriad local walks. The Chestnut Centre, with its owls, 
otters and deer, is 15 minutes’ drive away, and the Gathering arranges 
family-friendly activities in school holidays, from nature walks to arts and 
crafts and egg collecting. If rain stops play, there’s a sociable barn to 
retreat to and cook, play games and watch films.

On a farm outside High Bickington, half an hour’s drive from the north Devon 
coast, this lovingly restored 1950s caravan has a double bed, shower, toilet, 
kitchen, central heating, chiminea and even a wine cellar (a trap door leads to 
a wine store; sadly, you’ll have to stock it yourself). One of the owners is an 
artist and the green and white decor has a playful vintage charm (the kitchen 
sink is made from an old ceramic mixing bowl). It’s the peaceful, panoramic 
views of the Taw Valley that really sell a stay here, though: guests often see 
deer on the hill opposite.Exmoor national park

The five safari tents at Tom’s Eco Lodge have long been popular with summer 
visitors but the addition of two log cabins and two glamping pods means you can 
now book a stay all year round (traditional self-catering cottages are also 
available elsewhere on the estate). It’s part of a working dairy farm, Tapnell 
Farm (families are welcome to meet the animals and collect eggs), and is 
surrounded by over 30 acres of native woodland. There’s a farm shop, 
restaurant, playground and Tapnell Farm Park, with a playbarn, outdoor activity 
areas, farm animals and a “mob” of rehomed wallabies.

Recently reopened after a six-month refurbishment, this secluded youth hostel 
on a clifftop is now a comfortable year-round retreat thanks to new windows and 
a wood-burning stove. It has long been popular with walkers and bird-watchers, 
and a reconfiguration of the communal space has made more of the view: on the 
most windswept days guests can dispense with the head-to-toe GoreTex and just 
perch by a window to watch out for peregrine falcons flying past and seals 
bobbing in the water below. When the sun’s out, step out of the door and stride 
out along the South West Coastal Path.

This cottage on a working farm outside Helton, near Penrith, was converted 
from an old barn in 2014. The kitchen, underfloor heating and shower point to 
21st-century comforts but, in keeping with its surroundings, the styling here 
is appealingly rustic, with chunky wooden bunk beds, a farmhouse kitchen table 
and exposed stone walls. It’s well set up for outdoorsy visitors, with bike 
storage, space for muddy boots and table tennis in a stable block. Head out 
into the fells for a ride or a walk, or follow a family-friendly story trail 
around nearby Askham Fell.

This two-yurt camp in Norfolk’s Wensum valley is only open until mid-October 
(reopens end of March 2017) so catch it while you can. Each yurt has a kingsize 
bed with goose-down duvet, two single futons, cooking area, wood-burning stove, 
private compost loo (solar-powered showers are in a shipping container bathroom 
nearby) and a skylight for stargazing, or birdwatching, in bed. They are ideal 
for two families – or one large one – who want a private retreat. It’s 
surrounded by 17 acres of countryside, including woods, fields, a wildflower 
meadow, streams and ponds, so you can spend your time foraging, pond-dipping or 
trying to spot herons, hares, deer and barn owls.

Simple, family-friendly camping is the order of the day at this tent-only 
campsite at Woolverton, near Bath (open May-October). Families and couples can 
enjoy the run of this pastoral site and its menagerie of chickens and ducks. 
Hen and stag parties aren’t accepted. In the centre of its 10 well-spaced 
pitches is a timber play area for younger children and the toilet block 
includes a custom-designed bathroom for families. The on-site shop sells local 
cider alongside other camping essentials, and if you want to go glam, there are 
two bell tents for hire. The National Trust’sStourhead 
<https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/stourhead> is a short drive away, as is 
Longleat <https://www.longleat.co.uk/>, but the picnic-friendly ruins of 
Farleigh Hungerford Castle are right on the doorstep, and the campsite works 
with activity operatorAveling Adventure <http://www.aveling-adventure.co.uk/> 
to offer archery, circus skills and family-friendly challenges both on-site and 
off.

A sweeping National Trust property built by a Victorian mill owner, this 
70-bed mansion is now managed by the YHA, so anyone can try the country house 
experience. Guests are welcome to explore the 60 acres of wooded grounds, but 
climbers and walkers will be heading out into the surrounding Peak District 
national park. Raven Tor, known for its knot of challenging rock climbing 
routes, is nearby and the bike- and boot-friendlyMonsal Trail 
<http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/visiting/trails/monsaltrail>, an 8.5-mile path 
that follows the old Midland railway, passes close by. The hostel’s bike 
facilities were updated last year (expect purpose-designed bike storage and a 
bike repair station), so it’s now a great base for visiting cyclists, too.
