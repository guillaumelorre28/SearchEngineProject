Today in Campaign 2016

 * So much for every Republican running away from Trump. House speaker Paul 
Ryan will campaign with the presidential nominee in his home district in 
Wisconsin on Saturday, according to a statement from his office. Rather 
hilariously – no, let’s go with quite hilariously – given Ryan’schronic bobbling
 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-not-talking-about-trump_us_573f1225e4b0613b5129f74b?by8kwc4qjlaexw29>
 of the Trump question, the statement advises that “all questions related to 
Mr. Trump should be directed to the Trump campaign.”

 * At the end of the first presidential debate last week, Donald Trump patted 
himself on the back for not bringing up some unnamed thing relating to the 
Clinton family, which pretty clearly was Bill Clinton’s infidelities. After the 
debate, Trump continued to pat himself on the back for not bringing up 
Clinton’s infidelities, which most politicalanalysts agreed 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/30/politics/donald-trump-women/> was not a fight 
that would end well for him. Now Trump has definitively declared – onPage Six 
of the New York Post 
<http://pagesix.com/2016/10/05/trump-i-wont-mention-bill-clintons-past-at-next-debate/>
 – that he will NOT bring up “Bill Clinton’s past”: 
“I want to win this election on my policies for the future, not on Bill 
Clinton’s past,” Trump told Page Six via email. “Jobs, trade, ending illegal 
immigration, veteran care, and strengthening our military is what I really want 
to be talking about.”

 * Trump running mate Mike Pence this morning told CNN that Trump no longer 
supports a ban on Muslims entering the US but wants a ban on immigrants “from 
countries compromised by terrorism.” 
 * “We’re going to suspend immigration from countries compromised by 
terrorism,” Pence said. CNN’s Chris Cuomo does a good job of pushing him: “But 
governor that is a finessed position,” Cuomo said, pointing out that Pence 
strongly condemned Trump’s call for a Muslim ban back when he was supporting 
Ted Cruz. “You condemned those comments. Why do you not condemn them now?” 
Pence laughed, as if no questions could be sillier. “Well because it’s not 
Donald Trump’s position now.” Facebook

Donald Trump’s core supporters may back his views on curbing immigration – but 
they disagree with him over global trade and US involvement in Nato, an opinion 
poll has found.

Trump has made opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal 
between the US and Asia a central theme of his populist campaign, but more of 
his base favour it (49%) than oppose it (46%), according to the2016 Chicago 
Council on Global Affairs survey 
<https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/america-age-uncertainty?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ccs-report>
.

In another surprising finding, despite Senator Bernie Sanders’ vocal criticism 
of the TPP 
<http://www.npr.org/2016/07/03/484574128/sanders-centers-platform-fight-on-trans-pacific-trade-deal>
 during the Democratic primary, some 56% of his supporters back the agreement, 
as do 74% of Hillary Clinton’s.

The annual survey suggests a gap between the views of those who shout loudest 
during the presidential election and the more nuanced positions of many 
Democratic and Republican voters on the ground, most of whom want America to 
remain engaged with the world.

As expected, immigration does seem to be a vote winner for Trump, who has been 
accused of inciting hatred and violence. “Trump’s rhetoric on immigrants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/trump-comments-mexico-rapists-planned-deposition-video>
 and refugees has most clearly struck a chord with his base,” notes the report, 
published on Thursday. “On each and every question concerning immigration, 
Trump’s core supporters are the least favorable.”

The final question at Donald Trump’s town hall: “What is one of the earliest 
memories you had as a child?” The question is followed by a “Go, Donald!” from 
its asker.

He answers this question by discussing the vacancy on the supreme court.

Apparently, despite being spoon-fed handpicked softballs by a sycophantic 
moderator in a venue packed exclusively with supporters chosen by his campaign, 
Trump wasn’t that interested in treating tonight like actual preparation for 
Sunday night’s debate.

Pete from Nashua wants to know about social security! Specifically, how 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> will 
bankrupt the programs by extending citizenship to undocumented immigrants.

“When they want to do their jobs, and, it’s much more difficult, and who’s 
gonna come out and endorse Trump?” Trump begins, before meandering into a 
discussion about the war on drugs. “If I win, and if I become president - first 
get the nomination, that happened - then become president, I’m gonna promise 
the people of New Hampshire that we’re gonna stop this crap coming into your 
state.”

Next question, this time from Bob Swanson: Can you assure the American people 
that you are going to clean house at the FBI, Justice Department, State 
Department and the FDA?

“One of my favorite questions,” the “moderator” declares.

“What’s happened to the FBI and to the Justice Department at the highest 
level, honestly I think it’s one of the saddest things that’s happened to this 
country,” Trump says.

Next question: How do you define the income range for “middle class”?

“The middle class has been forgotten in this country,” Trump says, before 
drifting into talking about China for a spell. “I will tell you, it’s such a 
great question, because our middle class has been treated so badly by our 
politicians - it’s been forgotten.”

Next question in New Hampshire: What message do you have for Latinos deceived 
by the biased media to vote forHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>?

(Yes, this is seriously a question in Donald Trump’s debate prep.)

“People that are here legally, they don’t want people coming across the border 
illegally taking their jobs, taking their homes, taking whatever they want to 
take,” Trump says. “We’re gonna do fantastic with the Hispanics - I believe 
that.”

“Doing well!” the moderator says.

Donald Trump’s “moderator” in the town hall that his campaign insists is not 
debate prep allows the first question - after noting that there is a two-minute 
clock he can use or not use, at Trump’s discretion - which asks of Trump 
whether he will amp up his criticism ofHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, after “holding back” in 
the first debate.

“I think for good reason, I think for good reason,” Trump said. “Let’s see 
what happens, I mean, let’s see what happens. I think we’re all better off if 
we can do that.”

 * So much for every Republican running away from Trump. House speaker Paul 
Ryan will campaign with the presidential nominee in his home district in 
Wisconsin on Saturday, according to a statement from his office. Rather 
hilariously – no, let’s go with quite hilariously – given Ryan’schronic bobbling
 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-not-talking-about-trump_us_573f1225e4b0613b5129f74b?by8kwc4qjlaexw29>
 of the Trump question, the statement advises that “all questions related to 
Mr. Trump should be directed to the Trump campaign.”

 * At the end of the first presidential debate last week, Donald Trump patted 
himself on the back for not bringing up some unnamed thing relating to the 
Clinton family, which pretty clearly was Bill Clinton’s infidelities. After the 
debate, Trump continued to pat himself on the back for not bringing up 
Clinton’s infidelities, which most politicalanalysts agreed 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/30/politics/donald-trump-women/> was not a fight 
that would end well for him. Now Trump has definitively declared – onPage Six 
of the New York Post 
<http://pagesix.com/2016/10/05/trump-i-wont-mention-bill-clintons-past-at-next-debate/>
 – that he will NOT bring up “Bill Clinton’s past”: 
“I want to win this election on my policies for the future, not on Bill 
Clinton’s past,” Trump told Page Six via email. “Jobs, trade, ending illegal 
immigration, veteran care, and strengthening our military is what I really want 
to be talking about.”

 * Trump running mate Mike Pence this morning told CNN that Trump no longer 
supports a ban on Muslims entering the US but wants a ban on immigrants “from 
countries compromised by terrorism.” 
 * “We’re going to suspend immigration from countries compromised by 
terrorism,” Pence said. CNN’s Chris Cuomo does a good job of pushing him: “But 
governor that is a finessed position,” Cuomo said, pointing out that Pence 
strongly condemned Trump’s call for a Muslim ban back when he was supporting 
Ted Cruz. “You condemned those comments. Why do you not condemn them now?” 
Pence laughed, as if no questions could be sillier. “Well because it’s not 
Donald Trump’s position now.”  
Donald Trump’s core supporters may back his views on curbing immigration – but 
they disagree with him over global trade and US involvement in Nato, an opinion 
poll has found.

Trump has made opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal 
between the US and Asia a central theme of his populist campaign, but more of 
his base favour it (49%) than oppose it (46%), according to the2016 Chicago 
Council on Global Affairs survey 
<https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/america-age-uncertainty?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=ccs-report>
.

In another surprising finding, despite Senator Bernie Sanders’ vocal criticism 
of the TPP 
<http://www.npr.org/2016/07/03/484574128/sanders-centers-platform-fight-on-trans-pacific-trade-deal>
 during the Democratic primary, some 56% of his supporters back the agreement, 
as do 74% of Hillary Clinton’s.

The annual survey suggests a gap between the views of those who shout loudest 
during the presidential election and the more nuanced positions of many 
Democratic and Republican voters on the ground, most of whom want America to 
remain engaged with the world.

As expected, immigration does seem to be a vote winner for Trump, who has been 
accused of inciting hatred and violence. “Trump’s rhetoric on immigrants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/trump-comments-mexico-rapists-planned-deposition-video>
 and refugees has most clearly struck a chord with his base,” notes the report, 
published on Thursday. “On each and every question concerning immigration, 
Trump’s core supporters are the least favorable.”

The final question at Donald Trump’s town hall: “What is one of the earliest 
memories you had as a child?” The question is followed by a “Go, Donald!” from 
its asker.

He answers this question by discussing the vacancy on the supreme court.

Apparently, despite being spoon-fed handpicked softballs by a sycophantic 
moderator in a venue packed exclusively with supporters chosen by his campaign, 
Trump wasn’t that interested in treating tonight like actual preparation for 
Sunday night’s debate.
 
Pete from Nashua wants to know about social security! Specifically, how 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> will 
bankrupt the programs by extending citizenship to undocumented immigrants.

“When they want to do their jobs, and, it’s much more difficult, and who’s 
gonna come out and endorse Trump?” Trump begins, before meandering into a 
discussion about the war on drugs. “If I win, and if I become president - first 
get the nomination, that happened - then become president, I’m gonna promise 
the people of New Hampshire that we’re gonna stop this crap coming into your 
state.”

Next question, this time from Bob Swanson: Can you assure the American people 
that you are going to clean house at the FBI, Justice Department, State 
Department and the FDA?

“One of my favorite questions,” the “moderator” declares.

“What’s happened to the FBI and to the Justice Department at the highest 
level, honestly I think it’s one of the saddest things that’s happened to this 
country,” Trump says.
 
Next question: How do you define the income range for “middle class”?

“The middle class has been forgotten in this country,” Trump says, before 
drifting into talking about China for a spell. “I will tell you, it’s such a 
great question, because our middle class has been treated so badly by our 
politicians - it’s been forgotten.”
 
Next question in New Hampshire: What message do you have for Latinos deceived 
by the biased media to vote forHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>?

(Yes, this is seriously a question in Donald Trump’s debate prep.)

“People that are here legally, they don’t want people coming across the border 
illegally taking their jobs, taking their homes, taking whatever they want to 
take,” Trump says. “We’re gonna do fantastic with the Hispanics - I believe 
that.”

“Doing well!” the moderator says.
 
Donald Trump’s “moderator” in the town hall that his campaign insists is not 
debate prep allows the first question - after noting that there is a two-minute 
clock he can use or not use, at Trump’s discretion - which asks of Trump 
whether he will amp up his criticism ofHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, after “holding back” in 
the first debate.

“I think for good reason, I think for good reason,” Trump said. “Let’s see 
what happens, I mean, let’s see what happens. I think we’re all better off if 
we can do that.”
 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> begins his 
“town hall” in New Hampshire by pumping his poll numbers in South Carolina – 
where he’s only five points ahead.
 
With a friendly moderator and a hand-picked crowd, Donald Trump hopes to 
prepare for Sunday night’s town-hall debate withHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> tonight in New Hampshire.
