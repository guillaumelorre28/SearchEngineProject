Billy Paul obituary

This is sort of a mash-up before the age of mash-ups – and arguably one of the 
most profound that’s existed. Take one of Paul McCartney’s most poignant 
post-Beatles songs and add horn stabs, strings and hard drums: what emerges is

’s unapologetic spin on the sweet original. He takes a melodic number and 
transforms it into a battle-cry anchored by gutsy production. Malcolm X 
dialogue is sampled and references to slain civil rights hero Medgar Evers are 
heard, while jazz icon Louis Armstrong also gets referenced. At the song’s end, 
Billy’s voice raises to an apex sided with passages from Dr Martin Luther 
King’s I Have A Dream speech. The outcome is both dramatic and effective, 
proving Billy can not only sing with gusto, but also completely alter a song’s 
narrative with heartfelt lyrical substitutions.

 Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right 
Perhaps no other song in Paul’s catalogue captures how emotive his voice can 
be. This one begins with a sparse arrangement, Paul sings a capella – 
whispering and crooning over a jagged bass line – until a piano emerges where 
we find him belting out lyrics, fluttering heavy over drums and a lively piano. 
It’s of course a cover of Bob Dylan’s 1962 masterpiece, yet Paul’s version – 
with its perky arrangement and vocal strength – almost renders Dylan’s original 
tepid. Despite its title, the album isn’t a live recording but rather 
represented Paul’s live show at the time (the Cadillac Club was a legendary 
venue in Philadelphia where a young Aretha Franklin worked). This was Paul’s 
stunning debut album, which became such a commodity that Philadelphia 
International Records reissued it in 1973. At the time, Paul was primarily a 
jazz vocalist, but this release certainly showed a burgeoning artist with more 
gifts than anyone had previously thought.

Following War of the God’s 2012’s reissue, Paul referred to it as “the best 
album I’ve ever done in my life”. An exuberant standout, Thanks For Saving My 
Life – at just under three minutes – is short compared to some of his longer, 
more well known ballads. But this is his redemption song, a snappy tune where 
the vocals are both powerfully belted out (“I can’t live without you, baby!”) 
or subtly subdued (“Making me feel like I’m living again …”). Despite not being 
as lavish or orchestral as previous Gamble and Huff releases, it managed to 
reach No 37 on the top 40 pop hits chart and No 9 on the top 10 soul charts. 
It’s a more straightforward song off a heady, almost psychedelic soul album 
arranged by Booby Martin and Lenny Paluka. This is quintessential Paul, the 
ability to be pronounced without overstepping while pulling back when needed.

 Am I Black Enough For You 
The Sound of Philadelphia was in full swing in the spring of 1973. Gamble and 
Huff had successfully built a studio and succinct work environment that 
mirrored Motown’s hit-making machine and Me and Mrs Jones had just been a 
juggernaut success for the imprint. Against the advice of the label’s top 
brass, Paul’s follow-up single would be Am I Black Enough for You, an 
in-your-face track that tested white radio’s patience with an onslaught of 
politically black anthems. It wasn’t sultry or catchy as Mrs Jones, but had 
snappy bongos and loud horns. Paul repeatedly sings “Am I black enough for 
you?” with lyrics including “Get in line, stop marching in time, you better 
make up your mind, we’re gonna leave you behind.” Though certainly a departure 
from his previous work – and one that many say sparked the end of Paul’s 
popularity – 30-plus years later the song and its release stands as an 
enormously brave artistic decision and one of Paul’s most enduring.

 Me and Mrs Jones 
Not including Me and Mrs Jones is like excluding Sitting on the Dock of the 
Bay when writing about Otis Redding – perhaps it’s overplayed but nevertheless 
underscores his entire canon. It was Paul’s biggest commercial breakthrough and 
remains a beautifully sultry classic from the 70s. The single was an 
international hit (reached No 12 on the British charts in 1973) and sold over 
2m copies in the US. It is the prefect example of when production aesthetics, 
storyline and vocal performances simply marry. In a year of hits, tours and 
many successes, Paul earned a Grammy for best male R&B vocal performance, 
beating out contemporaries Curtis Mayfield and Ray Charles in the process. 
Generations to come will always have “a thing going on with Mrs Jones”. It not 
only stands as his most recognizable song and biggest hit, but also perhaps his 
most striking, most cherished, and certainly most timeless.
