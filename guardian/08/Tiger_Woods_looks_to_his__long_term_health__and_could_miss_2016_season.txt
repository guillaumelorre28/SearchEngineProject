The prospect of Tiger Woods <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tigerwoods> 
missing this entire year of competitive golf remains a live one, with the 
40‑year‑old still refusing to offer any likely timescale for his return from 
back surgery.

Woods announced on Friday night that, as expected, he would not feature in 
this week’s Masters. It will be the second time in three years the 14-times 
major winner has not played at Augusta National, although on this occasion he 
will attend Tuesday evening’s champions dinner.

Woods has previously admitted that ignoring medical advice earlier in his 
career was to his detriment. He now insists his “long-term health” is at the 
forefront of his mind, meaning a reappearance on the tournament circuit is not 
imminent.Woods last played at the Wyndham Championship

Speculation that Woods could miss 2016 in its entirety was fuelled by his 
close friend Steve Stricker last week. “I could see him just staying away this 
year,” Stricker said. “I think this time, he wants to take it a little bit 
slower and make sure that everything is OK with his back, and [that] he’s 
healed and ready to go before he comes back.”

Augusta National revealed on Saturday that Jordan Spieth, the 2015 champion

, has been afforded the sharing of a champion’s locker with the four-time 
Masters winner Arnold Palmer. “The locker is located beside the locker shared 
by six-time champion Jack Nicklaus and Horton Smith, the winner of the first 
tournament in 1934,” said the club in a statement.
