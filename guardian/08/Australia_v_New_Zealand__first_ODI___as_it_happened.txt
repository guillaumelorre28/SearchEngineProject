Australia go one-nil up

Adam Collins

Australia have taken this opening rubber with an impressive effort with the 
bat and some excellent periods with the ball. Which isn’t to say the Black Caps 
weren’t in this game during the chase - they had their moments. Guptill’s 
century wasn’t a matchwinner, but on most days it would be, a wonderful display 
of clean hitting after getting into the groove.

Of course, the ton that won the game was Smith’s earlier, his 164 the new 
highest score at the SCG. But he backed it up in the field as well, taking a 
sensational catch at gully to remove BJ Watling before he had a chance to 
potentially influence the game.

Hazlewood’s two wickets early on set the tone; he’s a man in wonderful form. 
Marsh chipped in with a couple of tidy spells and Starc broke up the 92-run 
partnership between Guptill and Neesham that gave brief hope of an upset in the 
chase of 325.

Cummins first shift back to international cricket for 15 months started off 
poorly, giving away plenty. But he’ll be encouraged by two late wickets both 
picked up with useful slower balls. As they say, he’ll be better for the run.

And that’ll just about do us. Sure enough, Steve Smith is the man of the 
match. He’ll speak in a moment. Kane Williamson at the presentation says they 
bowled poorly in the middle stages of the Australian innings. But he says the 
“attitude with the bat was great.” That’s about right, there are certainly 
positives that they can take to Canberra for the second rubber on Tuesday.

Now Smith, who acknowledges that he had some luck to not be given lbw early 
when asked to talk about how well he played. He’s less modest with the crazy 
catch he took at gully, he knows it was a screamer. On Cummins: “He came back 
well,” adding that he was nervous at the start. And Head: “He’s a smart player.”

More broadly, Smith agrees that this ODI series is a chance to help get their 
summer back on track after the early dramas in Perth and Hobart with the red 
ball.

I might leave it here too. Thanks for your company this evening. We’ll be back 
with the Guardian’s live over-by-over coverage on Tuesday afternoon at 
Canberra’s Manuka Oval. Until then, be well.

AUSTRALIA WIN BY 86 RUNS (New Zealand all out 256)

Mitch Marsh gets the final wicket, Ferguson the man on debut bowled for a duck 
chopping on. The last three wickets came inside six balls once the chase was 
realistically beyond the tourists. Some final thoughts in a tic.

WICKET! Munro c Bailey b Cummins 49 (New Zealand 255-9)

Cummins has two in the over from the slower ball. Nicely executed, Munro this 
time through the stroke by the time it arrived, Bailey again the man taking the 
catch after the ball went high, but barely outside the 30m fielding circle. 
Important wickets for Cummins, and a reminder that he had a bit more going on 
than pace alone.

WICKET! Henry c Bailey b Cummins 27. (New Zealand 253-8)

A lot of pace off the ball from Cummins means Henry is through the stroke 
prematurely, the ball up very high but safely into the waiting hands of Bailey 
patrolling the long-on rope. Handy cameo from Henry, but they’re coming up 
short tonight. Cummins into the book, which will be good for his confidence 
after a shaky start.

43rd over: New Zealand 252-7 (Munro 47, Henry 27) Target 325. The NZ 250 is up 
with Munro slaps Marsh out for two, deep point doing the work. The bowler 
flirts with the wide rule twice, once with a slower ball bouncer that he got 
away with - and fair enough - then later with another change up well outside 
off stump. Umpire Mantel calls the second one. Australia still win the over, 
four from it. Marsh has been very good this evening. 22,502 the final crowd. 
Probably a fraction light on for a Sydney Sunday?

42nd over: New Zealand 248-7 (Munro 44, Henry 27) Target 325. Broken bat! 
Cummins back on and Munro needs a new piece of wood, snapping the one he 
brought out there at the splice. Immediate shots from Ch 9 to when Michael 
Carberry’s bat snapped during the ‘13-14 Ashes.
Okay, we’re back now, a new bat for Colin. He uses it well for the remainder 
of the over, getting Cummins away to fine leg for four after Marsh drags it 
over. Then Henry takes him to midwicket to end the over, four more scored. A 
good over or the Kiwis, 13 from it. They need quite a few of those though. 77 
from 48 the equation.

41st over: New Zealand 235-7 (Munro 38, Henry 21) Target 325. Zampa does the 
right thing and throws it up to Henry, but he’s good enough to get on the back 
pad and slog it over the midwicket fence. Plenty of sixes tonight, eight all 
up. It’s not a slog, actually. Well, it is. But it’s better than that, if you 
know what I mean. It isn’t filthy. Anyway, Zampa has avery good shout with the 
penultimate delivery after Munro attempts his second reverse sweep of the over. 
But he has no way to litigate the case through the third umpire because they 
gave away the review the previous over.

40th over: New Zealand 227-7 (Munro 37, Henry 14) Target 325. The required 
rate is over ten, then below it when Henry - after a series of dots - gets 
enough top edge on the last ball of Hazlewood’s spell to get four down to third 
man. The big quick isn’t thrilled, but with 3-for-49 next to his name after his 
shift no one will be in any doubt who set this up for Australia with the ball. 
Two superb limited overs spells.

39th over: New Zealand 222-7 (Munro 36, Henry 10) Target 325. We were upstairs 
with areview towards the end of that Zampa set, after Munro freed up the arms 
twice to smack him through extra cover. Fair play to him. Anyway, the review is 
a shocker. Zampa didn’t fancy it. Smith squired as he made the ‘T’. This is the 
modern age, as a genius once said.
 Yeah, the genius is Jules. Facebook

38th over: New Zealand 211-7 (Munro 27, Henry 8) Hazlewood is ever so close to 
two-in-two, his first ball to Matt Henry much the same as the one that got rid 
of de Grandhomme. But he gets an inside edge on it, meaning he profits by four.
Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket>, bless it’s quirks. Next 
ball though, he slays the Australian opener through cover point in a far more 
convincing effort.

This deserves to be in the OBO.

WICKET! de Grandhomme lbw Hazlewood 6 (New Zealand 203-7)

They have reviewed this, but I’m not even waiting for the red lights to come 
up to write: that is very, very out. Beautiful from Hazlewood. He’s been mostly 
successful with seam tonight, but that was legitimate in-swing. de Grandhomme 
didn’t stand a chance. Nor do the Black Caps.

37th over: New Zealand 198-6 (Munro 26, de Grandhomme 2) I’m not going to lie, 
my wifi dropped out then and I spent most of the over swearing at my modem. 
Something my therapist doesn’t like me doing. Anyway, we’ll work on that 
tomorrow. I can tell you that only three runs were taken by the Zampa over, all 
singles. And that the Black Caps now need nearly 10 an over. They’re stuffed.

36th over: New Zealand 195-6 (Munro 24, de Grandhomme 1) Target 325. A single 
each to sweepers, getting Colly de G off the mark in the process. Hazlewood 
sticks with his back-of-a-length plan to Munro, who responds by swatting him 
back over his head. Sure, why not. An inside edge into the onside means he’ll 
keep the strike again.

35th over: New Zealand 188-6 (Munro 18, de Grandhomme 0) Target 325. A single 
to Munro will keep him the strike. For a bloke known for smashing the suitcase 
out of it, he’s underwhelmed tonight. And hadn’t gone that well at working the 
field either.

Good point here, well made. Hazlewood just as much part of that Santner 
dismissal after working him over in his previous set.

I hope Adam Zampa buys Hazlewood a beer or two tonight #AUSvNZ

WICKET! Santner c Warner b Zampa 0 (New Zealand 187-6)

This, my friends, is over. Santner didn’t look comfortable at any stage in his 
seven ball stay, holing out to on where Warner is stationed. Clever from Zampa 
to throw it up after skidding the previous ball at his leg-stump.

34th over: New Zealand 186-5 (Munro 16, Santner 0) Target 325. Hazlewood to 
Santner is a pretty good match-up; he’s given the left-handers real grief 
tonight from over the wicket. He just hits the seam every time. This is a man 
in wonderful nick. Not once, not twice but thrice he’s beating the new man 
outside the off-stump from balls short of a length. Very hard to come up 
against that when chasing plenty and still on zero. This was always the risk if 
and when Guptill went. Only the Munro single to begin the over into the covers 
scored from it, the required run rate now 8.6.

Michael Clarke makes a gag about the size of Mark Taylor’s boat on the TV 
coverage. No comment.

WICKET! Guptill c Maxwell (sub) b Zampa 114 (New Zealand 185-5)

It’s the long hop! Earlier that exact scenario played out only for George 
Bailey to put down the catch. Not this time with Maxwell out there snaffling 
the chance, albeit with a juggle. Was that for laughs? Possibly. I hope so. I 
liked the timing of the Zampa second spell. Guptill hit him out of the attack 
earlier, but he was the one man to make life difficult for him. And he nearly 
had him the ball before, a big thick edge and in the air a long time. Good 
captaincy.

32nd over: New Zealand 177-4 (Guptill 107, Munro 14) Target 325. Hazlewood is 
back. That’s not a bad call; he was brilliant earlier. It’s a poor restart on 
the pads, a couple of legbyes. But as soon as Munro is down there it is 
advantage Hazlewood. He finds the left-handers edge angling away, falling just 
short of Smith at a floating slip position. A single to deep point gives the 
strike back to Guptill. He’ll have to at least consider trying to take him on, 
I reckon. Nup, a single to third man. But at least he retains the strike. Just 
as important at this stage.

31st over: New Zealand 172-4 (Guptill 105, Munro 13) Target 325. What a 
wonderful way to bring up a century.93 balls for Guptill to raise three 
figures. He’s smashed it 100 metes the TV commentary says. Marsh hasn’t done 
much wrong, but it’s such a clean strike (see below). 153 from 114 still 
required, and it remains the case that Australia are driving this game broadly 
speaking, but where there is Guptill there is hope for NZ. He’s whacked half a 
dozen sixes in that hundred. A good time for another drinks break.

30th over: New Zealand 163-4 (Guptill 97, Munro 12) Target 325. The dot balls 
are infectious, Cummins - in a much better period for the young quick - 
delivering four on the trot to Guptill. He’s been doing it with ease for some 
time now, so that’s an important development. Quick and on the hip he 
successfully guides the ball into a gap at short midwicket for a quick single 
to leave Munro one ball to negotiate. Poor batting when he gets his chance 
though, trying to take a ball well outside stump down the ground when there was 
an easy one to the sweeper at either cover or backward point. So that’s one run 
from two overs and 21 off the last five. A clutch period for Australia, the run 
rate required now in excess of eight an over.

29th over: New Zealand 162-4 (Guptill 96, Munro 12) Target 325. Some good 
umpiring there, what looked to be a leading or inside edge nothing but thigh 
pad, correctly assessed as such. Marsh has done a fine job stitching together a 
maiden to Munro. You don’t see many of those in the 29th over of an ODI when 
the chase is still broadly on.

28th over: New Zealand 162-4 (Guptill 96, Munro 12) Target 325. Smith sticks 
with Cummins, probably in an effort to get through as many of his overs before 
the final ten. But to be fair, he’s much closer to the mark this time around, 
consistently forcing Guptill onto the back foot at a decent clip. Three singles 
are taken by the sweepers.

Glenn Maxwell is on the field as Twelfth Man sub-fielding. I’d trade away most 
things for him to take a worldly right now. Carn the Show.

27th over: New Zealand 158-4 (Guptill 94, Munro 10) Target 325. Martyyyyy. 
Can’t not say that without speaking like Doc Brown. Martyyyyy! He’s so good 
here, lobbing onto the front dog and pulling Marsh into the crowd. More a 
baseballer than a cricketer with that shot. He struts into the 90s.

26th over: New Zealand 150-4 (Guptill 87, Munro 9) Target 325. Cummins is back 
while the going is good for Australia. Good captaincy. Munro ignores my advice 
from a few moments ago by trying to put Cummins on to the moon. He nearly 
succeeds, that’s got hang time. Travis Head looks to be under it for a moment, 
but instead the ball fell from the sky a couple of metres over the rope. You 
get six runs for those, and makes NZ’s task 7.3 an over. Or 174 runs in 24 
overs with six wickets in hand if that’s how you prefer it. The 150 is up as 
well with a single coming after the big’un.

25th over: New Zealand 142-4 (Guptill 86, Munro 2) Target 325. Colin Munro can 
give it a mighty wallop. That’s not his job right now though; he has to support 
Guptill by taking plenty of singles to relieve some pressure, letting the 
senior player do what he does.

That. Catch. Twitter is comparing it to John Dyson for the best at this venue. 
It’s gotta be in the conversation.

WICKET! Watling c Smith b Marsh 6. (New Zealand 140-4)

The risk in the modern game is to say this every other game, but that’s one of 
the great ODI catches!The skipper flung himself full-stretch to his left after 
Marsh dropped short and Watling cut with force behind point. In the gully, he 
judged his dive perfectly and plucked it out of the sky with one hand. Special 
cricket from the Australian captain, who is having a blinder.

24th over: New Zealand 138-3 (Guptill 86, Watling 4) Target 325. The broader 
benefit of the Neesham wicket shown here with Watling struggling to get Starc 
away. Five dots and a single, which means he keeps the strike. Good, full fast 
bowling from Starc. Marsh back now as well to push a few overs out while the 
Kiwis recalibrate.

23rd over: New Zealand 137-3 (Guptill 86, Watling 3) Target 325. Nothing wrong 
with Zampa’s set until the final ball, a half-tracker that Guptill launches 
over the fence. Let’s himself down, as it’s a good over until then. Watling got 
underway with runs to the sweepers on either side earlier in the over.

22nd over: New Zealand 127-3 (Guptill 79, Watling 0) Target 325. It’s all on 
Guptill now. And that’s no reflection on the batting to come, but you know how 
these things work. The player who is set and flying bats through, or it gets 
messy and fast.

WICKET! Neesham c Hazlewood b Starc 34 (New Zealand 126-3)

Oh gee, Jimmy. Just when NZ were looking right on top. Even earlier in that 
set, a ball parried onto the boundary at point. It all just felt right, you 
know? But in an effort to take Starc over deep midwicket he’s only succeeded in 
skying it to the sweeper Hazlewood. From a ball outside the off-stump too, so 
it was premeditated. You can understand him wanting to keep the foot down, but 
it won’t look good when he watches it back in the sheds.

21st over: New Zealand 121-2 (Guptill 73, Neesham 34) Target 325. If Steve 
Smith was under some pressure coming into this over, 12 runs in three balls 
from Zampa won’t help. The final of the sequence is a glorious inside-out six 
over extra cover to the long boundary, some 80 metres to the Bill O’Reilly 
stand today. Into the crowd and everything. 44 from the last five overs between 
these two, in a partnership now worth 87. They need seven an over from here. 
They’re all the numbers you need to know. I’m like Antony Green on election 
night here.

Here’s the Guptill six. Imagine being able to do that.

close  
Australia have taken this opening rubber with an impressive effort with the 
bat and some excellent periods with the ball. Which isn’t to say the Black Caps 
weren’t in this game during the chase - they had their moments. Guptill’s 
century wasn’t a matchwinner, but on most days it would be, a wonderful display 
of clean hitting after getting into the groove.

Of course, the ton that won the game was Smith’s earlier, his 164 the new 
highest score at the SCG. But he backed it up in the field as well, taking a 
sensational catch at gully to remove BJ Watling before he had a chance to 
potentially influence the game.

Hazlewood’s two wickets early on set the tone; he’s a man in wonderful form. 
Marsh chipped in with a couple of tidy spells and Starc broke up the 92-run 
partnership between Guptill and Neesham that gave brief hope of an upset in the 
chase of 325.

Cummins first shift back to international cricket for 15 months started off 
poorly, giving away plenty. But he’ll be encouraged by two late wickets both 
picked up with useful slower balls. As they say, he’ll be better for the run.

And that’ll just about do us. Sure enough, Steve Smith is the man of the 
match. He’ll speak in a moment. Kane Williamson at the presentation says they 
bowled poorly in the middle stages of the Australian innings. But he says the 
“attitude with the bat was great.” That’s about right, there are certainly 
positives that they can take to Canberra for the second rubber on Tuesday.

Now Smith, who acknowledges that he had some luck to not be given lbw early 
when asked to talk about how well he played. He’s less modest with the crazy 
catch he took at gully, he knows it was a screamer. On Cummins: “He came back 
well,” adding that he was nervous at the start. And Head: “He’s a smart player.”

More broadly, Smith agrees that this ODI series is a chance to help get their 
summer back on track after the early dramas in Perth and Hobart with the red 
ball.

I might leave it here too. Thanks for your company this evening. We’ll be back 
with the Guardian’s live over-by-over coverage on Tuesday afternoon at 
Canberra’s Manuka Oval. Until then, be well.

Mitch Marsh gets the final wicket, Ferguson the man on debut bowled for a duck 
chopping on. The last three wickets came inside six balls once the chase was 
realistically beyond the tourists. Some final thoughts in a tic.
 
Cummins has two in the over from the slower ball. Nicely executed, Munro this 
time through the stroke by the time it arrived, Bailey again the man taking the 
catch after the ball went high, but barely outside the 30m fielding circle. 
Important wickets for Cummins, and a reminder that he had a bit more going on 
than pace alone.
 
A lot of pace off the ball from Cummins means Henry is through the stroke 
prematurely, the ball up very high but safely into the waiting hands of Bailey 
patrolling the long-on rope. Handy cameo from Henry, but they’re coming up 
short tonight. Cummins into the book, which will be good for his confidence 
after a shaky start.
 
43rd over: New Zealand 252-7 (Munro 47, Henry 27) Target 325. The NZ 250 is up 
with Munro slaps Marsh out for two, deep point doing the work. The bowler 
flirts with the wide rule twice, once with a slower ball bouncer that he got 
away with - and fair enough - then later with another change up well outside 
off stump. Umpire Mantel calls the second one. Australia still win the over, 
four from it. Marsh has been very good this evening. 22,502 the final crowd. 
Probably a fraction light on for a Sydney Sunday?
 
42nd over: New Zealand 248-7 (Munro 44, Henry 27) Target 325. Broken bat! 
Cummins back on and Munro needs a new piece of wood, snapping the one he 
brought out there at the splice. Immediate shots from Ch 9 to when Michael 
Carberry’s bat snapped during the ‘13-14 Ashes.
Okay, we’re back now, a new bat for Colin. He uses it well for the remainder 
of the over, getting Cummins away to fine leg for four after Marsh drags it 
over. Then Henry takes him to midwicket to end the over, four more scored. A 
good over or the Kiwis, 13 from it. They need quite a few of those though. 77 
from 48 the equation.

41st over: New Zealand 235-7 (Munro 38, Henry 21) Target 325. Zampa does the 
right thing and throws it up to Henry, but he’s good enough to get on the back 
pad and slog it over the midwicket fence. Plenty of sixes tonight, eight all 
up. It’s not a slog, actually. Well, it is. But it’s better than that, if you 
know what I mean. It isn’t filthy. Anyway, Zampa has avery good shout with the 
penultimate delivery after Munro attempts his second reverse sweep of the over. 
But he has no way to litigate the case through the third umpire because they 
gave away the review the previous over.
 
40th over: New Zealand 227-7 (Munro 37, Henry 14) Target 325. The required 
rate is over ten, then below it when Henry - after a series of dots - gets 
enough top edge on the last ball of Hazlewood’s spell to get four down to third 
man. The big quick isn’t thrilled, but with 3-for-49 next to his name after his 
shift no one will be in any doubt who set this up for Australia with the ball. 
Two superb limited overs spells.
 
39th over: New Zealand 222-7 (Munro 36, Henry 10) Target 325. We were upstairs 
with areview towards the end of that Zampa set, after Munro freed up the arms 
twice to smack him through extra cover. Fair play to him. Anyway, the review is 
a shocker. Zampa didn’t fancy it. Smith squired as he made the ‘T’. This is the 
modern age, as a genius once said.
 Yeah, the genius is Jules.  
38th over: New Zealand 211-7 (Munro 27, Henry 8) Hazlewood is ever so close to 
two-in-two, his first ball to Matt Henry much the same as the one that got rid 
of de Grandhomme. But he gets an inside edge on it, meaning he profits by four.
Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket>, bless it’s quirks. Next 
ball though, he slays the Australian opener through cover point in a far more 
convincing effort.

This deserves to be in the OBO.

They have reviewed this, but I’m not even waiting for the red lights to come 
up to write: that is very, very out. Beautiful from Hazlewood. He’s been mostly 
successful with seam tonight, but that was legitimate in-swing. de Grandhomme 
didn’t stand a chance. Nor do the Black Caps.
 
37th over: New Zealand 198-6 (Munro 26, de Grandhomme 2) I’m not going to lie, 
my wifi dropped out then and I spent most of the over swearing at my modem. 
Something my therapist doesn’t like me doing. Anyway, we’ll work on that 
tomorrow. I can tell you that only three runs were taken by the Zampa over, all 
singles. And that the Black Caps now need nearly 10 an over. They’re stuffed.
 
36th over: New Zealand 195-6 (Munro 24, de Grandhomme 1) Target 325. A single 
each to sweepers, getting Colly de G off the mark in the process. Hazlewood 
sticks with his back-of-a-length plan to Munro, who responds by swatting him 
back over his head. Sure, why not. An inside edge into the onside means he’ll 
keep the strike again.

35th over: New Zealand 188-6 (Munro 18, de Grandhomme 0) Target 325. A single 
to Munro will keep him the strike. For a bloke known for smashing the suitcase 
out of it, he’s underwhelmed tonight. And hadn’t gone that well at working the 
field either.

Good point here, well made. Hazlewood just as much part of that Santner 
dismissal after working him over in his previous set.

<https://twitter.com/theSportress/status/805354937441890304>  
This, my friends, is over. Santner didn’t look comfortable at any stage in his 
seven ball stay, holing out to on where Warner is stationed. Clever from Zampa 
to throw it up after skidding the previous ball at his leg-stump.
 
34th over: New Zealand 186-5 (Munro 16, Santner 0) Target 325. Hazlewood to 
Santner is a pretty good match-up; he’s given the left-handers real grief 
tonight from over the wicket. He just hits the seam every time. This is a man 
in wonderful nick. Not once, not twice but thrice he’s beating the new man 
outside the off-stump from balls short of a length. Very hard to come up 
against that when chasing plenty and still on zero. This was always the risk if 
and when Guptill went. Only the Munro single to begin the over into the covers 
scored from it, the required run rate now 8.6.

Michael Clarke makes a gag about the size of Mark Taylor’s boat on the TV 
coverage. No comment.
 
It’s the long hop! Earlier that exact scenario played out only for George 
Bailey to put down the catch. Not this time with Maxwell out there snaffling 
the chance, albeit with a juggle. Was that for laughs? Possibly. I hope so. I 
liked the timing of the Zampa second spell. Guptill hit him out of the attack 
earlier, but he was the one man to make life difficult for him. And he nearly 
had him the ball before, a big thick edge and in the air a long time. Good 
captaincy.
 
32nd over: New Zealand 177-4 (Guptill 107, Munro 14) Target 325. Hazlewood is 
back. That’s not a bad call; he was brilliant earlier. It’s a poor restart on 
the pads, a couple of legbyes. But as soon as Munro is down there it is 
advantage Hazlewood. He finds the left-handers edge angling away, falling just 
short of Smith at a floating slip position. A single to deep point gives the 
strike back to Guptill. He’ll have to at least consider trying to take him on, 
I reckon. Nup, a single to third man. But at least he retains the strike. Just 
as important at this stage.
 
31st over: New Zealand 172-4 (Guptill 105, Munro 13) Target 325. What a 
wonderful way to bring up a century.93 balls for Guptill to raise three 
figures. He’s smashed it 100 metes the TV commentary says. Marsh hasn’t done 
much wrong, but it’s such a clean strike (see below). 153 from 114 still 
required, and it remains the case that Australia are driving this game broadly 
speaking, but where there is Guptill there is hope for NZ. He’s whacked half a 
dozen sixes in that hundred. A good time for another drinks break.

30th over: New Zealand 163-4 (Guptill 97, Munro 12) Target 325. The dot balls 
are infectious, Cummins - in a much better period for the young quick - 
delivering four on the trot to Guptill. He’s been doing it with ease for some 
time now, so that’s an important development. Quick and on the hip he 
successfully guides the ball into a gap at short midwicket for a quick single 
to leave Munro one ball to negotiate. Poor batting when he gets his chance 
though, trying to take a ball well outside stump down the ground when there was 
an easy one to the sweeper at either cover or backward point. So that’s one run 
from two overs and 21 off the last five. A clutch period for Australia, the run 
rate required now in excess of eight an over.
 
29th over: New Zealand 162-4 (Guptill 96, Munro 12) Target 325. Some good 
umpiring there, what looked to be a leading or inside edge nothing but thigh 
pad, correctly assessed as such. Marsh has done a fine job stitching together a 
maiden to Munro. You don’t see many of those in the 29th over of an ODI when 
the chase is still broadly on.

 
28th over: New Zealand 162-4 (Guptill 96, Munro 12) Target 325. Smith sticks 
with Cummins, probably in an effort to get through as many of his overs before 
the final ten. But to be fair, he’s much closer to the mark this time around, 
consistently forcing Guptill onto the back foot at a decent clip. Three singles 
are taken by the sweepers.

Glenn Maxwell is on the field as Twelfth Man sub-fielding. I’d trade away most 
things for him to take a worldly right now. Carn the Show.
 
27th over: New Zealand 158-4 (Guptill 94, Munro 10) Target 325. Martyyyyy. 
Can’t not say that without speaking like Doc Brown. Martyyyyy! He’s so good 
here, lobbing onto the front dog and pulling Marsh into the crowd. More a 
baseballer than a cricketer with that shot. He struts into the 90s.

26th over: New Zealand 150-4 (Guptill 87, Munro 9) Target 325. Cummins is back 
while the going is good for Australia. Good captaincy. Munro ignores my advice 
from a few moments ago by trying to put Cummins on to the moon. He nearly 
succeeds, that’s got hang time. Travis Head looks to be under it for a moment, 
but instead the ball fell from the sky a couple of metres over the rope. You 
get six runs for those, and makes NZ’s task 7.3 an over. Or 174 runs in 24 
overs with six wickets in hand if that’s how you prefer it. The 150 is up as 
well with a single coming after the big’un.
 
25th over: New Zealand 142-4 (Guptill 86, Munro 2) Target 325. Colin Munro can 
give it a mighty wallop. That’s not his job right now though; he has to support 
Guptill by taking plenty of singles to relieve some pressure, letting the 
senior player do what he does.

That. Catch. Twitter is comparing it to John Dyson for the best at this venue.

The risk in the modern game is to say this every other game, but that’s one of 
the great ODI catches!The skipper flung himself full-stretch to his left after 
Marsh dropped short and Watling cut with force behind point. In the gully, he 
judged his dive perfectly and plucked it out of the sky with one hand. Special 
cricket from the Australian captain, who is having a blinder.
 
24th over: New Zealand 138-3 (Guptill 86, Watling 4) Target 325. The broader 
benefit of the Neesham wicket shown here with Watling struggling to get Starc 
away. Five dots and a single, which means he keeps the strike. Good, full fast 
bowling from Starc. Marsh back now as well to push a few overs out while the 
Kiwis recalibrate.
 
23rd over: New Zealand 137-3 (Guptill 86, Watling 3) Target 325. Nothing wrong 
with Zampa’s set until the final ball, a half-tracker that Guptill launches 
over the fence. Let’s himself down, as it’s a good over until then. Watling got 
underway with runs to the sweepers on either side earlier in the over.

Oh gee, Jimmy. Just when NZ were looking right on top. Even earlier in that 
set, a ball parried onto the boundary at point. It all just felt right, you 
know? But in an effort to take Starc over deep midwicket he’s only succeeded in 
skying it to the sweeper Hazlewood. From a ball outside the off-stump too, so 
it was premeditated. You can understand him wanting to keep the foot down, but 
it won’t look good when he watches it back in the sheds.
 
21st over: New Zealand 121-2 (Guptill 73, Neesham 34) Target 325. If Steve 
Smith was under some pressure coming into this over, 12 runs in three balls 
from Zampa won’t help. The final of the sequence is a glorious inside-out six 
over extra cover to the long boundary, some 80 metres to the Bill O’Reilly 
stand today. Into the crowd and everything. 44 from the last five overs between 
these two, in a partnership now worth 87. They need seven an over from here. 
They’re all the numbers you need to know. I’m like Antony Green on election 
night here.

Here’s the Guptill six. Imagine being able to do that.
