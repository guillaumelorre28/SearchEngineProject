Morning is an important time of day, because how you spend your morning can 
often tell you what kind of day you are going to have. For instance, if you 
wake up to the sound of twittering birds, and find yourself in an enormous 
canopy bed, with a butler standing next to you holding a breakfast of freshly 
made muffins and hand-squeezed orange juice on a silver tray, you will know 
that your day will be a splendid one.

I have fond memories of books at bedtime. Dad in a folding chair, dragged in 
from the deck, continuing long after our eyelids had started to grow heavy. 
Mum, sitting on the floor by our bunk beds, a book in her hands. These days, 
when I try to read at bedtime, I tend to end up falling into a slumber within 
minutes. But there are many evenings where I do find myself reading out loud, 
from an armchair, or the floor beside a set of bunk beds, to my 10-year-old 
nannying charge. I fail spectacularly at accents, we have speculative 
discussions about what we think might happen next, and I try to find books she 
will fall as much in love with as I did. We had varied success, until she 
brought A Series of Unfortunate Events home from the school library. We’ve been 
flying through them, and she is already planning on going as Violet to Book Day 
next year.

, coconut cake – she suggests we make it. Last week, we came to the quote 
above, and it was so evocative and appealing that we had to go back and read 
the page a second time. We decided that the time had come – we had found a dish 
that we wanted to recreate immediately. Funny, then, that it is not a dish 
actually eaten by the Baudelaire orphans, but is instead an imagined treat on 
an imagined morning, providing a stark contrast to the terrible ones our three 
heroes’ experience. Birdsong, a canopy bed, fresh muffins and orange juice – it 
is all merely a dream. Happily, it wasn’t for us.

We ate lots of muffins as we were growing up. They were a sweet thing that mum 
embraced, in league with banana bread as “almost cake, but not quite”. They’re 
also extraordinarily easy to make, and were one of the first things I learned. 
If you don’t have a butler to bring them in on a silver tray (a bit odd, 
actually, we decided as we were reading), rest assured that they genuinely are 
the work of moments. I made a batch at 3.30am once, to sustain a group of us on 
an early drive to France. Before I went to sleep, I put the dry ingredients in 
one bowl, and the wet ones in a jug in the fridge. A quick fold in the morning, 
and they then baked while I dressed, collected my bags, and poured coffee into 
a flask. This recipe makes a small batch, as muffins are never better than when 
just out of the oven, split open, with a little bit of butter melting on the 
warm, cakey middle.

Raspberry Muffins

Makes six large muffins

Ingredients 
190g plain flour 
2tsp baking powder 
75g golden caster sugar 
Pinch salt
 120ml yoghurt 
1 egg 
60g melted butter, cooled 
220g fresh raspberries 
20g granulated sugar, for the tops of the muffins

Equipment 
Mixing bowl
 Measuring jug/second mixing bowl 
Fork 
Spatula 
Large muffin tray 
Muffin papers 
Skewer

1. Preheat the oven to 210C. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar 
in the largest mixing bowl. In the second bowl, or jug, beat the yoghurt, egg 
and melted butter with the fork, and then fold in the raspberries.

2. Ensure your oven has heated sufficiently, and then tip the liquid 
ingredients into the dry ones. Fold them together, stopping as soon as the 
flour is incorporated. The trick here is not to mix too enthusiastically; if 
you over mix at this stage, the gluten in the flour will start to develop, and 
you’ll end up with a dense muffin.

3. Divide the batter equally between the six muffin cases, sprinkle each with 
a small pinch of granulated sugar, and transfer them to the oven. Bake for five 
minutes, and then reduce the temperature to 190C and bake for a further 20 
minutes.

4. Remove from the oven, allow to cool for five minutes, and then serve warm, 
with butter and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.
