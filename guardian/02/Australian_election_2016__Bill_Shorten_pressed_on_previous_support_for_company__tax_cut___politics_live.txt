That's enough

Well I think that will do for week four, thanks so much to Mel Davey for doing 
early shifts for the past fortnight, and to you readers for showing up.

Let’s say farewell for now.

The prime minister faces continuing difficulties with the government’s 
superannuation policy, but he’s putting his foot down, declaring the policy is 
now, and will forever be, the policy because it’s fair.

The Labor leader faced questions about why he supported company tax cuts in 
2011 but did not support them now.Bill Shorten said because Labor was making 
choices in this election, and the choices were schools and hospitals, not tax 
relief for big companies.

With campaign debates a minor issue today, the deputy Labor leader, Tanya 
Plibersek, has taken to Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/tanya.plibersek/> to 
declare she’s ready, anytime, anywhere. Well perhaps not, but you get my drift.

Julie Bishop and I have been invited to do a few deputy leader debates, 
including Q&A, the Press Club, Mamamia, and Twitter. I have said yes to all of 
these. I hopeJulie Bishop MP <https://www.facebook.com/JBishopMP/> will too.

Now, sadly, I’ve inadvertently misled you today on the latest episode of our 
podcast Australian Politics Live. Normally the episode would arrive about now, 
but our production process is a bit delayed this week. It’s likely the episode 
will appear tomorrow morning. I’ll share it via social media when it appears.

Let's talk about gotcha

Political blogger Paula Matthewson has posted for Crikey 
<https://www.crikey.com.au/2016/06/03/lazy-gotcha-journalism-ruins-political-debate/#loggedin>
 today on the vexed subject of gotcha journalism. She points out that there is 
a circular process going on in politics: because *gotcha* has significant 
currency in the news cycle, the back room responds by trying to lock everything 
down.

Somewhat ironically, gotcha journalism is, in large part, responsible for 
politicians being drilled in the art of (not) answering the question. And also 
for the tightly choreographed visits to classrooms, shop floors, and shopping 
centres that make it almost impossible for a party leader to meet a member of 
the public who hasn’t already been background-checked and briefed, or utter an 
unscripted word.

This is absolutely right of course. Another issue associated with the modern 
expectation that everyone in a government or an opposition or micro party be 
absolutely across every issue is the rise of talking points. That’s why 
politicians sound like robots, spouting the same formulations, because a lot of 
people are talking way outside their portfolios. They’ve learned lines rather 
than digested content.

Paula again:

Gotcha journalism is an attempt to break through the bubble that risk-averse 
campaign teams construct around their leaders, and in this respect it could be 
a more legitimate form of journalism.

But only if the unexpected and unsettling questions pursue and elicit 
information that is of greater value to the public interest than the 
demonstration of an interview subject’s lack of photographic memory.

I don’t have any particular argument with this as a conclusion – however, I 
would say this. One person’s gotcha is another person’s pursuit of 
accountability. It can be hard to distinguish the two sometimes. For example, I 
don’t thinkNeil Mitchell’s interview with Julie Bishop this week was a gotcha 
moment. I think Mitchell was genuinely frustrated that people inside the 
government and beyond hadn’t focused on the implications of the transition to 
retirement changes, and one way to shine a light on that was actually shine a 
light. As a consequence of that, we’ve had an informative discussion about 
super policy this week, in which the government has done something novel: 
defend the policy on its merits, without resorting to overwrought rhetoric. 
It’s actually served a useful purpose, even ifBishop had to endure a rugged 15 
minutes in the hot seat.

You can also have moments in journalism that I’d describe as accidental 
gotcha. A few years ago I was in a press conference with the then treasurer,
Wayne Swan, and I couldn’t find the inflation figure in the materials we’d been 
given, probably because I was trying to do several things at once, so I asked 
the treasurer what the inflation figure was. Swan had a brain freeze and a long 
silence followed. This, of course, was prominent on many news bulletins that 
evening. It would have looked planned. As I asked the question I can say, hand 
on heart, that it wasn’t planned. I just couldn’t find the inflation figure and 
I needed it quickly. It never occurred to me that he wouldn’t know the answer.

Interested, as ever, in thoughts from readers.

Campaign this two hours after lunchtime

Rightio, time to stand and deliver. Recapping the key events of Friday.

the Adelaide Hills on Friday. Photograph: Andrew Meares/AAP 
 * Malcolm Turnbull has flown into Adelaide to try to shore up the Coalition’s 
seats against an insurgency fromNick Xenophon. On Thursday night, the prime 
minister held a virtual town hall with the voters of Sturt before campaigning 
with LiberalJamie Briggs, who is attempting to hang ont o the seat of Mayo. 
Superannuation is continuing to be a problem, with NationalMichael McCormack 
signalling he’ll raise the policy in the Coalition party room once the election 
is done. The prime minister is continuing to dig in behind the policy. It’s 
fair, he told reporters just a little while ago, adding he was prime minister 
for all Australians.

 * Bill Shorten is in Tasmania trying to take seats from the Coalition. Today 
he unveiled $44m for tourism projects in the state and faced questions about 
why he supported company tax cuts in 2011, and doesn’t support them now. 
Shorten said he supported company tax cuts in 2011 because it was part of the 
mining tax package, and because his judgment was it was affordable then. He 
says it is not affordable now, because elections are about choices, and Labor’s 
choice is to fund schools and hospitals rather than fund a corporate tax cut.

Onwards, upwards.

I did skip over election debates. Malcolm Turnbull was asked whether or not 
he’d do a Sky debate in Queensland next week. Turnbull didn’t declare his hand.

We have had many proposals about another leaders’ debate and we have already 
done one with Sky News, as you know. We’ve done one at the Press Club which was 
carried by the ABC and by Sky News. There are other media organisations that 
have presented other proposals and we are considering them.

Q: The issue of pensions has been thrust back into the spotlight of former 
parliamentarians. Given Nick Xenophon is making political hay out of it in 
South Australia, is it time once again to look at that issue?

Malcolm Turnbull:

I’m not sure what you are referring to as far as Nick Xenophon is concerned 
but there is a parliamentary pension scheme in place. It was changed in 2004 so 
it only applies – the old system, which is a defined benefits system – only 
applies to people who were elected prior to 2004 and the new system which 
affects me and anyone else elected after that year is a contributory one 
consistent with current practice in the public service.

Q: Your frontbencher spoke out this morning on super saying he will raise the 
issue after the election. Given you have said the only thing you will look at 
after the election is the way these changes are implemented, not the changes 
themselves, why is it so many people in your party seem to have a different 
idea about how receptive you’d be to substantive changes?

Malcolm Turnbull:

I will repeat what I said before. Our changes to superannuation are fair. They 
make the superannuation system more sustainable. They make it fairer for people 
on low incomes.

As I said yesterday, we have to be real about this – 15% is a lower rate of 
tax than the marginal rate that a kid stacking shelves at Woolies pays. Let’s 
get real. Super remains enormously generous. For those on high incomes with 
very large super balances it remains very generous. Just not quite as generous 
as it was.

By doing that, we have made it fairer and more flexible and it works better 
particularly for women, people on lower incomes, for older Australians and 
independent contractors.

Remember, I’m the prime minister for all Australians.

Tom Hughes, dropping Tony a line

Q: Do you agree with your father-in-law that appointing Abbott as leader in 
2009 was a potentially catastrophic decision and like having the principal 
lunatic in charge of the asylum?

(Inevitable this question would be put. I referenced this story about Tom 
Hughes earlier today.)

Malcolm Turnbull:

I won’t comment on that other than to say that my father-in-law is a very 
distinguished lawyer. He is a great man – 93 years of age this year. He served 
in the Royal Australian Air Force in the Second World War. He served his 
country in parliament and at war and his memoir will be of great interest and 
inspiration to many people who read his life story.

Tom has great respect for Tony Abbott and the note that is referred to in his 
memoirs, of course, is some years old and I know that Tom has written a note to 
Tony to apologise if any offence is caused by that.

Well I think that will do for week four, thanks so much to Mel Davey for doing 
early shifts for the past fortnight, and to you readers for showing up.

Let’s say farewell for now.

The prime minister faces continuing difficulties with the government’s 
superannuation policy, but he’s putting his foot down, declaring the policy is 
now, and will forever be, the policy because it’s fair.

The Labor leader faced questions about why he supported company tax cuts in 
2011 but did not support them now.Bill Shorten said because Labor was making 
choices in this election, and the choices were schools and hospitals, not tax 
relief for big companies.

With campaign debates a minor issue today, the deputy Labor leader, Tanya 
Plibersek, has taken to Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/tanya.plibersek/> to 
declare she’s ready, anytime, anywhere. Well perhaps not, but you get my drift.

Julie Bishop and I have been invited to do a few deputy leader debates, 
including Q&A, the Press Club, Mamamia, and Twitter. I have said yes to all of 
these. I hopeJulie Bishop MP <https://www.facebook.com/JBishopMP/> will too.

#StayTuned
 
Now, sadly, I’ve inadvertently misled you today on the latest episode of our 
podcast Australian Politics Live. Normally the episode would arrive about now, 
but our production process is a bit delayed this week. It’s likely the episode 
will appear tomorrow morning. I’ll share it via social media when it appears.
 
Political blogger Paula Matthewson has posted for Crikey 
<https://www.crikey.com.au/2016/06/03/lazy-gotcha-journalism-ruins-political-debate/#loggedin>
 today on the vexed subject of gotcha journalism. She points out that there is 
a circular process going on in politics: because *gotcha* has significant 
currency in the news cycle, the back room responds by trying to lock everything 
down.

Somewhat ironically, gotcha journalism is, in large part, responsible for 
politicians being drilled in the art of (not) answering the question. And also 
for the tightly choreographed visits to classrooms, shop floors, and shopping 
centres that make it almost impossible for a party leader to meet a member of 
the public who hasn’t already been background-checked and briefed, or utter an 
unscripted word.

This is absolutely right of course. Another issue associated with the modern 
expectation that everyone in a government or an opposition or micro party be 
absolutely across every issue is the rise of talking points. That’s why 
politicians sound like robots, spouting the same formulations, because a lot of 
people are talking way outside their portfolios. They’ve learned lines rather 
than digested content.

Paula again:

Gotcha journalism is an attempt to break through the bubble that risk-averse 
campaign teams construct around their leaders, and in this respect it could be 
a more legitimate form of journalism.

But only if the unexpected and unsettling questions pursue and elicit 
information that is of greater value to the public interest than the 
demonstration of an interview subject’s lack of photographic memory.

I don’t have any particular argument with this as a conclusion – however, I 
would say this. One person’s gotcha is another person’s pursuit of 
accountability. It can be hard to distinguish the two sometimes. For example, I 
don’t thinkNeil Mitchell’s interview with Julie Bishop this week was a gotcha 
moment. I think Mitchell was genuinely frustrated that people inside the 
government and beyond hadn’t focused on the implications of the transition to 
retirement changes, and one way to shine a light on that was actually shine a 
light. As a consequence of that, we’ve had an informative discussion about 
super policy this week, in which the government has done something novel: 
defend the policy on its merits, without resorting to overwrought rhetoric. 
It’s actually served a useful purpose, even ifBishop had to endure a rugged 15 
minutes in the hot seat.

You can also have moments in journalism that I’d describe as accidental 
gotcha. A few years ago I was in a press conference with the then treasurer,
Wayne Swan, and I couldn’t find the inflation figure in the materials we’d been 
given, probably because I was trying to do several things at once, so I asked 
the treasurer what the inflation figure was. Swan had a brain freeze and a long 
silence followed. This, of course, was prominent on many news bulletins that 
evening. It would have looked planned. As I asked the question I can say, hand 
on heart, that it wasn’t planned. I just couldn’t find the inflation figure and 
I needed it quickly. It never occurred to me that he wouldn’t know the answer.

Interested, as ever, in thoughts from readers.

Rightio, time to stand and deliver. Recapping the key events of Friday.

 * Malcolm Turnbull has flown into Adelaide to try to shore up the Coalition’s 
seats against an insurgency fromNick Xenophon. On Thursday night, the prime 
minister held a virtual town hall with the voters of Sturt before campaigning 
with LiberalJamie Briggs, who is attempting to hang ont o the seat of Mayo. 
Superannuation is continuing to be a problem, with NationalMichael McCormack 
signalling he’ll raise the policy in the Coalition party room once the election 
is done. The prime minister is continuing to dig in behind the policy. It’s 
fair, he told reporters just a little while ago, adding he was prime minister 
for all Australians.

 * Bill Shorten is in Tasmania trying to take seats from the Coalition. Today 
he unveiled $44m for tourism projects in the state and faced questions about 
why he supported company tax cuts in 2011, and doesn’t support them now. 
Shorten said he supported company tax cuts in 2011 because it was part of the 
mining tax package, and because his judgment was it was affordable then. He 
says it is not affordable now, because elections are about choices, and Labor’s 
choice is to fund schools and hospitals rather than fund a corporate tax cut.

Onwards, upwards.
 
Rightio that’s over and out for the press conference now. I’ll come back 
shortly with a summary of Friday, the story thus far.
 
I did skip over election debates. Malcolm Turnbull was asked whether or not 
he’d do a Sky debate in Queensland next week. Turnbull didn’t declare his hand.

We have had many proposals about another leaders’ debate and we have already 
done one with Sky News, as you know. We’ve done one at the Press Club which was 
carried by the ABC and by Sky News. There are other media organisations that 
have presented other proposals and we are considering them.
 
Q: The issue of pensions has been thrust back into the spotlight of former 
parliamentarians. Given Nick Xenophon is making political hay out of it in 
South Australia, is it time once again to look at that issue?

Malcolm Turnbull:

I’m not sure what you are referring to as far as Nick Xenophon is concerned 
but there is a parliamentary pension scheme in place. It was changed in 2004 so 
it only applies – the old system, which is a defined benefits system – only 
applies to people who were elected prior to 2004 and the new system which 
affects me and anyone else elected after that year is a contributory one 
consistent with current practice in the public service.

Q: Your frontbencher spoke out this morning on super saying he will raise the 
issue after the election. Given you have said the only thing you will look at 
after the election is the way these changes are implemented, not the changes 
themselves, why is it so many people in your party seem to have a different 
idea about how receptive you’d be to substantive changes?

Malcolm Turnbull:

I will repeat what I said before. Our changes to superannuation are fair. They 
make the superannuation system more sustainable. They make it fairer for people 
on low incomes.

As I said yesterday, we have to be real about this – 15% is a lower rate of 
tax than the marginal rate that a kid stacking shelves at Woolies pays. Let’s 
get real. Super remains enormously generous. For those on high incomes with 
very large super balances it remains very generous. Just not quite as generous 
as it was.

By doing that, we have made it fairer and more flexible and it works better 
particularly for women, people on lower incomes, for older Australians and 
independent contractors.

Remember, I’m the prime minister for all Australians. 
 
Q: Do you agree with your father-in-law that appointing Abbott as leader in 
2009 was a potentially catastrophic decision and like having the principal 
lunatic in charge of the asylum?

(Inevitable this question would be put. I referenced this story about Tom 
Hughes earlier today.)

Malcolm Turnbull:

I won’t comment on that other than to say that my father-in-law is a very 
distinguished lawyer. He is a great man – 93 years of age this year. He served 
in the Royal Australian Air Force in the Second World War. He served his 
country in parliament and at war and his memoir will be of great interest and 
inspiration to many people who read his life story.

Tom has great respect for Tony Abbott and the note that is referred to in his 
memoirs, of course, is some years old and I know that Tom has written a note to 
Tony to apologise if any offence is caused by that.
 
The prime minister is asked whether we will have to wait 20 years to see 
growth flow from the corporate tax cuts. Turnbull would like to mention that
Bill Shorten in 2011 supported a company tax cut.

Q: Will we have to wait 20 years to see 1% growth out of that?

Malcolm Turnbull:

investment in companies will result in more investment.
