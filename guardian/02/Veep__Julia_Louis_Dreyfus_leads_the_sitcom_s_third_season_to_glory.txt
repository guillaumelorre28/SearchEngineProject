This year’s Emmy awards provided little in the way of surprises 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/26/emmys-2014-breaking-bad-modern-family-and-veep-among-big-winners>
, with Breaking Bad showered in gold and wins for Modern Family and The Big 
Bang Theory, which suggested voters have not watched any new comedy since 2009. 
With her third Actress in a comedy series win, for her role as vice president 
Selina Meyer in the excellent Veep, Julia Louis-Dreyfus is approaching the same 
blanket winner status. That’s not to say that the White House comedy is 
undeserving. In fact, the third season has shown Dreyfus demonstrating the kind 
of form that has transformed a promising, if at times patchy, series into one 
of the funniest comedies of the year.

So far, season three, which is airing in the UK on Sky Atlantic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-atlantic>, has seen Meyer positioning 
herself as a viable candidate for the soon-to-be-vacant top job. As ever, Veep 
does not tackle this from an ideological point of view, rather as a dead-eyed 
race for power in which candidates will say anything in order to look good. The 
second episode in particular (The Choice) stood out as Meyer was forced to 
address the issue of abortion. While not coming down strongly on either a 
pro-life or pro-choice side of the fence, Veep’s razor-sharp wit was on 
display, with Meyer stating sagely: “If men got pregnant, you could get an 
abortion at an ATM.”

 Julia Louis-Dreyfus pre-empts her Emmy win in a pre-ceremony skit. 
Meyer’s role as a woman in government was brought to the centre of the show. 
“I can’t identify myself as a woman. People can’t know that! Men hate that,” 
she said, adding, “And women who hate women hate that … which, I believe, is 
most women.” Sly assistant Dan (Reid Scott), a self-described “abortionado”, 
best captured the political mood when he summed up the situation with, “I would 
go pro-life in a fetal fucking heartbeat if it meant winning.”

It’s not just the voters whom these cogs in the political wheel are willing to 
deceive. The third season has seen the rivalry between Dan and Amy(Anna 
Chlumsky) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/05/anna-chlumsky-child-stardom-veep>
 increasing as they both bid to become Selena’s presidential campaign manager, 
while professional idiot Jonah (Timothy Simon) is fired after starting an 
undercover gossip blog about his colleagues. Upon learning his fate, he 
threatens to expose ... the White House Wi-Fi code. Jonah is a rich source of 
comedy in Veep, and, in a world where nobody agrees on anything, everyone is 
united in hating him. So far this season, he has been described by various 
characters as “Jonad”, “Hepatitis J” and the quaint “jolly green jizz-face”.

As for the Veep herself, Meyer’s new power and prominence, as she puts herself 
forward as a legitimate contender to take up residency in the Oval Office, have 
brought a fresh perspective to the series. Similarities could be drawn with 
Parks and Recreation’s Leslie Knope, a character who also improved immeasurably 
after the series’ creators stopped using her as the butt of every joke and made 
her that bit more authoritative. Of course, Meyer continues to suffer the acute 
embarrassments thatVeep <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/veep> viewers 
have come to expect. A visit to a billion-dollar tech-company in Silicon Valley 
sees her ignored by its Zuckerberg-style CEO, while later, Jonah’s blog gets 
its biggest traffic spike when an animated video of his former boss 
flip-flopping on the subject of fracking goes viral.

 Meyer visits a pub. 
Excitingly for British viewers, Wednesday’s episode brings Meyer and her team 
to the UK for an episode shot on location in London. Considering Veep’s strong 
British roots (recent episodes have been directed by Chris Addison, Chris 
Morris and Peep Show’s Becky Martin) this is a real treat, and Dreyfus gets to 
show off her award-winning charm as she gets to grips with a pint of ale in a 
local pub. It may not be a good look for the would-be world leader, but then, 
as Veep always teaches us, people will do anything for power.
