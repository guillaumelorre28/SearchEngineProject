A Papua New Guinea government minister has defended police on Manus Island 
accused of assaulting two Iranian refugees

 on New Year’s Eve, saying the officers were attacked first when they tried to 
arrest the men for being drunk.

Ron Knight, the MP for Manus and vice minister for trade, commerce and 
industry in the PNG government, said he saw the incident and police used 
reasonable force after they were first attacked.

“Two very drunk asylum seekers stopping traffic and harassing women yesterday 
were approached by police,” Knight wrote on Twitter. “They punched a policeman 
and were arrested using reasonable force.

“I saw what happened. The police reacted as they do in any situation where 
they get assaulted first. This [is the] PNG reality where cops are outnumbered.”

Knight told Guardian Australia: “We cannot compare Australian and PNG police 
standards. This is PNG and the reality of keeping peace here with a small force 
is they have to be brutal. I would add that their [the refugees] injuries are 
what locals also get when assaulting police and acting like this. Only locals 
don’t get bail.”


Knight said the police were sober and professional.

The men and other refugees on the island vehemently dispute Knight’s version 
of events, and say it was the immigration officers and police who were drunk, 
and who aggressively told them they were not allowed to be outside the 
detention centre at night.

“The refugees said the first to attack them were two PNG immigration officers 
who were drunk and came to them and said ‘you don’t have the right to be 
outside of the prison at this moment’,” a fellow refugee told Guardian 
Australia.


“After a few minutes the police joined them and beat them extremely badly in 
the head, face, back and hands.”

The men suffered serious injuries, including suspected fractures, facial 
wounds and internal injuries. Pictures show the men with wounds to their faces, 
backs and limbs.

The two men, whose first names are Mehdi and Mohammad, spent 36 hours in 
police custody before being bailed on payment of 200 kina ($A100) on charges of 
drunkenness and resisting arrest.

The New Year’s Eve incident is the latest to involve clashes between locals 
and refugees on the island.

Knight has repeatedly said security inside the immigration detention centre 
had deteriorated so badly that the compounds were dangerous and lawless. He has 
posted online pictures of weapons and home-brew alcohol allegedly seized from 
inside the centre.

“It is so blatantly obvious that whoever is running RPC is not doing it 
right,” he said.

Knight said Manussians were particularly offended by the perception that 
detention centre employees have unofficial immunity from local laws. Knight has 
said previously that local resentment at both workers and detainees at the 
centre is growing.

In 2015, three Australian and New Zealand security guards allegedly drugged 
and gang-raped a local woman inside the detention centre

 but were flown out of the country before police could charge them. Other 
detention centre employees have allegedly been involved in thefts, assaults and 
driving offences. No one has ever been charged.

“Officially, it is now known by locals, we have two laws in this land. One for 
Australians and one for locals. Fucking disgraceful,” Knight wrote on Twitter.

“My caution to all is if they keep acting like this against locals then soon 
we will see reprisals and bloodshed. That’s not a threat, it’s fact.”

The allegations of PNG police brutality come at a time when the force appears 
to be in open conflict with the country’s military.

Investigations are under way into a violent clash between police officers and 
soldiers from the PNG defence force, in which gunshots were fired. Senior 
police officers, including the head of the national capital district police, 
were attacked outside the Boroko police station.

Video footage captured by local station EMTV 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jan/03/shots-fired-in-new-years-day-clash-between-png-police-and-military-video>
 shows soldiers allegedly firing their weapons into the air. That attack 
followed an earlier incident in which a defence force captain threatened to 
shoot police officers manning a roadblock.

Shots fired in New Year’s Day clash between PNG police and military

Jerry Singirok, a former PNG defence force commander, told Australia’s ABC 
radio 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-02/png-police-and-soldiers-clash/8157860> 
the incidents showed a “total breakdown in discipline” in both the police force 
and the army.


“The police are a law unto themselves ... they’ve taken a lot of civil 
situations out of control ... they beat up unarmed people. And same with 
soldiers, the soldiers are no different from the policemen,” he said.
