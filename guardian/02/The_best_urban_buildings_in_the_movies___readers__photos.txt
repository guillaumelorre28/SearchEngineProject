This is England.... 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/554f8cbce4b0c0082b0da72b/1526379>

Not all film buildings are what they purport to be. This is the shop that was 
used during filming in Shane Meadow's, 'This is England' back in 2005-2006. Its 
located in Bramcote, in the pleasant suburban outskirts of Nottingham. In the 
film Mr Sandhu, the Indian shopkeeper was subject to racist antoagonism by 
Shaun and the skinhead gang.

In real life, the shop closed down a few years later, became a hairdressers in 
the recent past...(2013), then reverted back to a convenience store during 
2014.....but currently no longer in use...maybe just biding its time until it's 
used as a film set again !

Katzs Delicatessen in New York City is the setting of "that" scene in When 
Harry Met Sally <https://www.theguardian.com/film/when-harry-met-sally>. "I'll 
have what she's having". I did. Great advice, as this place serves the best 
pastrami sandwiches anywhere in the world.

My 6 yr old son obviously admires the Home Alone films (1 & 2) and here he is 
standing outside the Plaza where that rapscallion (and wannabe rock star) 
Macaulay Culkin caused uproar with the most famous of concierge's - Tim Curry!

This was taken in February of this year, when it was around -10 degrees C - 
not at all frosty!
