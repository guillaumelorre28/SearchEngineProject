Haroon Aswat, 40, is accused of traveling to the United States in 1999 on a 
mission to set up a training camp in the remote hamlet of Bly, in the 
northwestern state of Oregon, to train militants who wanted to fight in 
Afghanistan.

Prosecutors say he was sent on the mission by radical British preacher Abu 
Hamza <https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-hamza>, who was convicted in New 
York earlier this year on 11 kidnapping and terrorism charges.

Aswat will stand trial in New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> on 1 June 2015, US District 
Judge Katherine Forrest said at a short hearing.

Aswat pleaded not guilty in October. He faces up to 35 years in prison if 
convicted.

Hamza, the former imam of Finsbury Park mosque in north London, was extradited 
from Britain in 2012

 after an eight-year battle against extradition delayed by multiple appeals.

Aswatâ€™s 21 October extradition came despite his diagnosis with paranoid 
schizophrenia. He has been held in a psychiatric hospital since 2008.

Aswat was arrested in Zambia in July 2005.
