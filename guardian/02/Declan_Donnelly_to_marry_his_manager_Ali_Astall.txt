I’m A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! host Declan Donnelly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/declandonnelly> is engaged to his manager, 
Ali Astall.

The presenter, who is in Australia for the new series of the reality show, is 
expected to marry next year.

Talking about their relationship previously, he admitted it was “a little 
strange” when the couple first got together because they had been work 
colleagues for so long, but said: “It’s going good. Everything’s hunky-dory.”

He was best man at the 2006 wedding of his on-screen partner Anthony 
McPartlin, who is expected to return the favour.

Donnelly, who first found fame with McPartlin in teenage drama Byker Grove, 
has previously dated the actor Clare Buckfield and the TV presenter Georgie 
Thompson.

The new series of the ITV show starts this weekend, with veteran broadcaster 
Michael Buerk heading into the jungle as one of 10 contestants including former 
Premier League footballer Jimmy Bullard and TV presenter Melanie Sykes.
