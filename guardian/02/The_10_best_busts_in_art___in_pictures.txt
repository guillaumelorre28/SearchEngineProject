1 Eduardo Paolozzi 
Shattered head 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/paolozzi-shattered-head-t00273> (1956)

I was tutored by Eduardo. He would teach me every Wednesday after we first met 
at the RCA Foundry in Kensington, London in the late 80s. He taught me how to 
work in plaster and in wax, but every time I went back to clay. Two years ago I 
left fashion and began sculpting full time. I just love my life now. This is an 
early piece, made when Eduardo was only 22. It’s one of the first he cast 
himself in a friend’s garden in Hampstead; he made a little bronze foundry 
there. He created the head in clay first, then wax, then he smashed the wax 
into pieces, put them back together and cast the whole thing. It’s a very 
important piece - the beginning of him making work about the machine age. In my 
own show, I think one of my best portraits is the one of Eduardo.

2 Thutmose 
Bust of Queen Nefertiti 
<https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/egypt-art/new-kingdom/v/thutmose--bust-of-nefertiti--c--1340-bce>
 (1340 BC)

Sometimes beauty can mask character but the face of this Queen Nefertiti is 
mysterious – there is something quite odd about the eyes because they are 
different. When something is not quite right it makes you wonder more about the 
personality of the person. I like that beautiful harmony which is disturbed by 
those eyes, the sensuality of the mouth, those hollow cheeks and that very long 
neck. She’s enigmatic and hides her feelings. The bust is so square, the facial 
forms are so soft and then suddenly you have the contrast with that severe 
crown, which is almost like a pyramid.

3 Auguste Rodin 
Monumental head of Balzac 
<http://www.musee-rodin.fr/en/collections/ceramics/monumental-head-balzac> 
(1897)

What I learned from the great Rodin is that you don’t need to show the exact 
likeness of a face. Here he wanted to show the creative force of Balzac the 
writer. He exaggerated all the main facial features - the eyes, the nose, the 
mouth, the eyebrows, the hair - everything is too strong. But through that 
mouth, almost shouting, you get a real sense of this character. Rodin had been 
commissioned to make a full-length sculpture of Balzac and in preparation he 
did several studies of Balzac’s head. When he came to do the body, he did it 
very simply. It’s just a draped gown. So there is also that contrast with the 
way he dressed him at full-scale, and that very, very vivacious head.

4 Antoine Bourdelle 
Beethoven 
<http://www.beethoven-haus-bonn.de/sixcms/list.php?page=museum_internetausstellung_seiten_en&sv%5binternetausstellung.id%5d=31560&skip=12>
 (1902)

The French sculptor Bourdelle was a student of Rodin so he learned a lot from 
him, and also did a lot of monumental work. Again, here there’s incredible hair 
which is almost not modelled, but swept off fiercely, and this face whichis 
modelled but very expressive. The mouth is tight and the eyes are hollow, and 
it shows a tragedy. Because, I think, at the very moment that Bourdelle made a 
portrait of Beethoven, the composer was going deaf. You can almost hear the 
music of Beethoven; there is something passionate and tragic in that hair.

5 Brancusi 
Sleeping Muse 
<http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/488458> (1910)

Through marble-carving Brancusi was trying to find simplicity in his work, and 
reducing his ideas to the minimum. This sleeping muse is a wonderful witness to 
his talent. I like the way her head is lying on the side. She’s resting 
peacefully but she’s almost held down by the weight of her head. Brancusi has 
done a lot of different versions, many in bronze, but it’s the one in marble I 
like the most. Maybe because the whiteness reinforces the serenity of the face.


6 Giacometti 
Portrait of Bruno 
<http://www.fondation-giacometti.fr/en/art/16/discover-giacometti/18/alberto-giacometti-database/110/selected-works/#?=&work=831>
 (1917)

This is a portrait Giacometti did of his youngest brother Bruno, an architect. 
It’s not what you’d expect from the master of thin, emaciated figures, but I 
love the way he shows the strength and willpower of his brother. Giacometti 
said: “The object of art is not to reproduce reality but to create a reality of 
the same intensity.” It applies so well here because it’s more than just a 
realistic portrait. You get the whole person behind the man.

7 Germaine Richier 
La Regodias <http://likeyou.com/en/node/43245> (1938)

Germaine Richier knew Giacometti and Bourdelle and used a lot of animal 
symbols in her work. But this is one of her early portraits. The subject is a 
professional model called Renee Regodias, but it’s the way Richier portrays 
her: she has a very elongated neck, twisted in a different way to the face, and 
that gives a lot of life to the face. There’s something very peaceful and 
mysterious about both this portrait and the bust of Queen Nefertiti. They talk 
to me, those two women.

8 Jean Fautrier
Large tragic head 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/fautrier-large-tragic-head-t06534> (1942)

This is my favourite. It’s the most painful and touching of all the portraits. 
Fautrier has made the two sides of the face totally different – one is much 
more classical, rational, the side with the eye; on the other he wanted to 
represent the inhumanity of man. Fautrier was part of the French Resistance 
during the second world war, and was under house arrest on the outskirts of 
Paris where the Nazis were torturing and executing prisoners, and from the 
studio he could hear all the screams. And that’s when he did this. It’s an 
extremely powerful piece and very painful to look at.

9 Marino Marini
Bust of Igor Stravinsky

 (1951)

I love his work, and the fact the face is modelled very simply, almost like 
you would do a mask. There is a feeling of death in that head, and yet at the 
same time there is a lot of sensuality. But then there is such sadness and 
understanding in the eyes; it makes you see the tragedy of life. I can feel the 
soul of the man. Marini said he preferred to do portraits of creative people 
because they don’t have just one facet in their face but hundreds; and what is 
so difficult is to find the essence in the multiplicity. Here he shows the 
anxiety, the nervousness, the sensuality, he shows so much.

Portrait of Oskar Kokoschka 
<http://www.pearlmancollection.org/artwork/portrait-oskar-kokoschka-0> (1969)

The modelling of the clay is quite sensuous, and then when you look at the 
hard lines on the forehead, and in the hair, there’s a real contrast; you 
realise the face is intense with sadness. He’s not making eye contact or 
engaging with the viewer. But Kokoschka was a very sad man. He had a very 
passionate affair witha married woman, which did not go well for him. When you 
look at Kokoschka’s own paintings you can see the violence of expression and 
the sadness. It’s perhaps no surprise that I have picked so many busts of 
artists here. When I sculpt artists and writers and actors myself, I am drawn 
to their multiplicity, as Marino Marini describes it, and I find I get 
something from their art in my work.As told to Liz Hoggard
