Today I, for iterations...which lasted two weeks and culminated in a full new 
release of our software. I've written previously aboutwhat happened in one week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2008/oct/07/technology> of a 
particular iteration in June 2008.

However, our R2 iterations didn't just involve implementing software. At the 
same time each team was also working with a business analyst and end-users to 
plan and clarify the work for the next iteration, and sometimes getting the 
last iteration's work through its systems tests prior to release. As one of the 
team leads said to me, "we work in three timezones".

At the end of an iteration the release went out. But our releases didn't 
always reveal much that was different -- either because we were waiting to 
reveal it as part of a forthcoming launch, or because it was part of our 
internally-facing systems. That can be an odd feeling for the development 
teams. In previous lives I've worked on projects where the launch has the whole 
team working right up to the last moment and so also signals the time when you 
can collapse with exhaustion. But our interleaving of "timezones", and releases 
well ahead of launches, changed that. The launch of, say, the Sports section 
was a big moment for so many in the company, but most of the people on the 
development team had finished the work some time before and were spending more 
time thinking about the launch that followed.
