Today O, for opportunity... which is a word that we came to understand only 
slowly, particularly as a counterpart to the word "challenge".

As we worked we inevitably came across problems; Nigel, our indefatigable 
programme manager, would insist on calling them "challenges", and casting 
possible actions as "opportunities", to the point that it became a running 
joke. But problems -- sorry, challenges -- are chances to raise your game, and 
opportunities are chances to resolve two issues with one action.

One very early challenge was to deliver our video platform without disrupting 
the R2 project. Delivering video was itself a major project, requiring CMS 
integration and embedded advertising. Our opportunity was to do that and at the 
same time prove that our "business as usual" team (which ran alongside the R2 
team and tended to deal with small, one-off tasks) could produce work at least 
as complex and high-profile as anything the R2 team could.

Our video technology has been a great success. The team produced something 
which enshrined good principles of web publishing, and integrated perfectly 
with the content management system (allowing keywording,search findability 
<http://browse.theguardian.com/search?search_target=%2Fsearch&fr=cb-guardian&search=teacher+tv&N=0&sort=relevance>
, etc) built from the R2 project. Taking the opportunity to prove the 
capability of the business as usual team provided everyone -- both inside and 
outside the team -- with even more confidence in what we could do.
