Being a Beatle can do wonders for your bank balance. Especially if you wrote 
many of their best-loved songs. That’s the message from the latest Sunday Times 
Rich List of musicians, which names SirPaul McCartney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney> as the most prosperous 
musician in the UK and Ireland – as he tends to be every year.

McCartney’s fortune is estimated at £730m, a rise of £20m on last year, and he 
also benefits from the fact that his wife, Nancy Shevell, has a £150m stake in 
her family’s trucking business in the US. If you were in the Beatles but 
happened not to be a songwriter you still don’t have to buy from the economy 
range in the supermarket: Ringo Starr is joint eighth on the list, with an 
estimated worth of £180m.

McCartney is followed on the list by Lord Lloyd-Webber (£650m) and U2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/u2> (£431m)m though unless the Irish band 
share everything in common, you’d have to assume that amounts to four separate 
fortunes.

It’s not all veterans of the pre-digital age in the list. The highest new 
entry on the list is Calvin Harris, straight in at No 30 with a £70m fortune, 
making him as rich as Pete Townshend and Mark Knopfler.

In little more than a year, Sam Smith has managed to accrue £12m. Adele, 
despite not releasing any music for nearly four years, has earned a further 
£5m, bringing her total to £50m. The four members of One Direction, plus their 
former comrade Zayn Malik, are believed to be worth £25m each, while Ed Sheeran 
has seen his bank account swell by £13m to £20m.
