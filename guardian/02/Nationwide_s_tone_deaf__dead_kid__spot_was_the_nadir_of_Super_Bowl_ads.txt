For everyone who isn’t interested in football, the Super Bowl provides another 
delight to look forward to. No, not Katy Perry flying around the arena on aThe 
More You Know shooting star 
<http://entertainthis.usatoday.com/2015/02/01/katy-perrys-star-looked-just-like-nbcs-the-more-you-know-logo/>
, but the commercials. There have been plenty of memorable ones over the years 
– theWassup Guys <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDTZCgsZGeA> and Apple’s 
famous 1984 spot 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-ts=1422579428&x-yt-cl=85114404&v=2zfqw8nhUwA>
, among others. Nationwide just added another to the ranks that no one will 
soon forget: the dead kid ad. Sadly it is not for being great or inspiring, but 
rather monumentally tone-deaf.

In the commercial, an adorable tot says that he will never learn to ride a 
bike or get married or grow up because he died in an accident. The spot then 
shows us an overflowing bathtub, an overturned television and other dangerous 
situations that threaten the lives of children. Way to spend $4.5m to make 
everyone in America choke on their Buffalo wings, Nationwide.

The ad got so much blowback on Twitter 
<http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/10-tweets-show-how-big-buzzkill-nationwide-was-its-morbid-super-bowl-ad-162702>
 that Nationwide had to issue a statement. “The sole purpose of this message 
was to start a conversation, not sell insurance,”the statement 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/super-bowl-xlix/nationwide-explains-depressing-super-bowl-ad-n298181>
, issued late Sunday night, read.

Nationwide unrepentant about bleak Super Bowl commercial

“We want to build awareness of an issue that is near and dear to all of us – 
the safety and well being of our children. We knew the ad would spur a variety 
of reactions … While some did not care for the ad, we hope it served to begin a 
dialogue to make safe happen for children everywhere.”

It certainly started a conversation, but it was more about the craven nature 
of the ad rather than child safety. The spot was so clearly emotionally 
manipulative in the worst possible way. In 45 seconds it managed to show us 
half a dozen images of children being cute and adorable, only to destroy all 
that goodwill by telling us that these cute cherubs died horribly and 
tragically. The only way to keep anyone safe, apparently, is to have really 
good insurance.

This bit of “sadvertising” is too short and blatant to really provoke emotion 
rather than shock. It doesn’t make parents want to hold their children tight – 
it makes them want to push away this advertiser that is tugging on the 
heartstrings so hard it is ripping out the organ and stomping it into the floor.

The tone was especially off this year, when most of the ads 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/feb/01/super-bowl-xlix-adverts-reviewed-from-kim-kardashian-to-snickers>
 tended to go for inspirational messages, like Always’s “run like a girl 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-ts=1422579428&x-yt-cl=85114404&v=F_Ep0O5fWN4>
” spot or Toyota’s commercial with paralympian Amy Purdy. Budweiser tried to
kill us with cute 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-cl=85114404&x-yt-ts=1422579428&v=xAsjRRMMg_Q>
 and T-Mobile went right for the funny bone withKim Kardashian’s self-parody 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-ts=1422579428&x-yt-cl=85114404&v=WzQ6a2UKlGM>
. Then here comes Nationwide, the Debbie Downer who kills all the fun as people 
are trying to sit around having a good time with their friends and family 
watching a football game. What’s next, a reminder that we’re all going to die 
alone during the Oscars?

What’s especially odd is that Nationwide had another funny commercial 
featuring aninvisible Mindy Kaling 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-ts=1422579428&x-yt-cl=85114404&v=Yrq8ruhmCX0>
 that hit all the right notes. It was smart, funny, featured some celebs and 
made us actually want to buy their product.

The Super Bowl <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/super-bowl> is one of the 
few times that everyone comes together for some wholesome fun, watching grown 
men knock into each other for our amusement. We want to eat very non-wholesome 
snacks, drink very non-wholesome beer, and maybe chuckle at a few non-wholesome 
representations of the rampant consumerism that pays for it all. We don’t want 
to be reminded that the things that we hold nearest and dearest are someday 
going to pass away, possibly before their prime in a freak accident.

Yes, this spot certainly provoked a conversation, but one about 
appropriateness and tone rather than the safety of children. Sorry, Nationwide: 
it looks like you’re on your own.
