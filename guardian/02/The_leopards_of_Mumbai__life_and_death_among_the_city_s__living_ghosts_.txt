Hawa hawa oh hawa … a 90s Hindi hit blares from the radio in Kusum’s mud 
house. “I play music till 1am every day,” says the elderly lady. She says she 
is not much of a music fan - but her loud playlist keeps the leopards away. 
Meanwhile, just down the road, 35-year-old Dilip Changverlekar recently 
renovated the house where his family has lived for generations. He added tin 
sheets to the roof and walls to make it difficult for leopards to climb.


Mumbai is India’s richest city and home to a human population of around 20 
million, but it also contains one of the largest protected urban forests in the 
world. TheSanjay Gandhi national park (SGNP) 
<http://www.sanjaygandhinationalpark.net/> spans 104 sq km - the size of 30 
Central Parks - and is home to more than 1,000 species of plants and animals. 
Here in Chuna Pada, a tribal hamlet of 40 houses inside the park’s boundary, 
seeing a leopard is not a scandal but a routine, and residents receive a visit 
from the big cats several times a week.


In 2012 a forest camera-trap 
<http://mumbaikarsforsgnp.com/leopards_natural_history.htm> counted as many as 
21 leopards in the park, and footage of the big cats in the slums, residential 
complexes and schools of urban Mumbai has shaped what many think of SGNP’s 
leopards. It has also given the impression that the creatures are entering the 
city more often than ever before. But are there really more leopards?

The leopards were here long before millions of people turned Mumbai (which 
once had a sizeable population of tigers, too) into a bustling megacity. The 
park’s peripheral areas have never been so densely populated, and Vidya 
Athreya, India’s leading expert on leopard-human conflict, thinks this has led 
to the increase in sightings.

“Eye shine” is the easiest way to spot the cats, who have a tapetum lucidum 
structure at the back of each eye that reflects light back and helps them see 
more clearly in the dark. “People used to go to bed earlier, and there weren’t 
so many vehicles or so many lights,” says Athreya.

The presence of leopards living alongside humans is a case of two highly 
adaptable species sharing space, says Athreya, who calls the animals “living 
ghosts” for their ability to be elusive.

The very idea that the leopard shouldn’t live near humans is a completely 
urban construct, she says. “If you got to ruralIndia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/india>, people know leopards have always 
been around. The adivasis [ethnic and tribal groups of India] have always lived 
with them and see the animal as part of their cultural identity.”


The leopards come close to human settlements looking for food, says SGNP 
wildlife researcher and conservationist Krishna Tiwari. Around 90% of their 
diet consists of dogs, rodents and wild boar, with stray dogs - attracted by 
the garbage dumped on the edge of the park - accounting for 60%.

Mumbai’s leopards have generally coexisted peacefully with their human 
neighbours. But a spate of attacks a decade ago reinforced the notion of them 
as bloodthirsty man-eaters. Of the 176 reported attacks between 1991 to 2013, 
84 occurred between 2002 and 2004. Nine people were killed by leopards in the 
month of June 2004 alone.

During this period, leopards rescued from other parts of Maharashtra state 
were being released in the SGNP. The authorities thought the park would be a 
haven for leopards, but instead the relocated cats were forced to fight for 
territory and food. “What we ended up having in the park was stressed-out 
predators,” says Athreya. “Highly territorial animals who were displaced and 
had to find food in an unfamiliar place.”

After the relocations stopped in 2006, the number of attacks decreased 
dramatically and there were no fatalities or injuries from leopard attacks in 
the Mumbai suburbs from 2009-11. Yet, since November 2011 there have been six 
fatalities; the last three deaths were all reported in Aarey Milk Colony, to 
the south of the SGNP. The most recent was in October 2013,when a 
seven-year-old boy was killed 
<http://www.ndtv.com/article/cities/mumbai-in-third-leopard-attack-in-a-month-seven-year-old-boy-killed-434211>
.

Tiwari, who grew up in a residential building just outside the SGNP, has 
worked in the park for almost two decades. The encroachment of the city today 
is unparalleled, he says. Illegal settlements - including nagars (settlements 
by non-indigenous people),padas (tribal settlements) and high-rise buildings - 
continue to swell in and around the park. More than 54 illegal settlements and 
two villages - with a combined population in excess of 250,000 - are inside the 
park itself.

With this encroachment of the city into the park, Athreya fears that conflict 
with humans is the prime threat to Mumbai’s leopard population. How people 
living around the park deal with the presence of these animals will determine 
the future for the big cats.

In space-deprived Mumbai, any open land attracts a premium, and the wall 
around the national park is “for people to stay out, not for leopards to stay 
in,” Tiwari says. “Real estate ads sell ‘nature’ as if the park is their 
private property. People want to live close to nature, but don’t want to live 
with the leopards that come with it.”

He now limits his conflict awareness to those living in informal settlements, 
such as tribal hamlets and slums. “If you are in a building there’s no need to 
worry,” he says. “All attacks on humans have happened in [slum] areas, except 
one inPowai <http://www.telegraphindia.com/1031011/asp/nation/story_2449908.asp>
.” In settlements that lack toilets or electricity, 80% of the leopard attacks 
happen when people go out to answer nature’s call after dark.

Chandunushay Jadhav lives in Aarey Milk Colony, where a record high number of 
leopards attacks have been recorded, including the most recent death. But 
Jadhav says there are more important things to worry about than leopard 
attacks: “Don’t tell us to be scared of the leopard, give us facilities,” says 
the 64-year-old, who sleeps in a doorless structure on his farm where three 
leopards are regular visitors. “I am not afraid, I don’t even have electricity. 
Don’t tease it, don’t disturb it and it won’t attack you.”

Jadhav knows that leopards have roamed the area for generations and doesn’t 
think the creatures will disappear anytime soon. In the old times, the cats had 
enough space in the jungle and ample prey, so “why are we making towers where 
the leopards are? The leopards will visit Mumbai again and again because this 
is where they live,” he says. “It is reallytheir home.”
