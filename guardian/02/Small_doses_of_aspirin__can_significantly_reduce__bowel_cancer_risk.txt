A small daily dose of aspirin can significantly cut the risk of getting or 
dying from bowel cancer, according to research published in the Lancet today.

The painkiller can reduce by a quarter the chances of being diagnosed with the 
disease, which is the UK's third most common cancer.

Regular users are also at a third less risk of dying from it, according to 
researchers led by Professor Peter Rothwell of Oxford University and Oxford's 
John Radcliffe hospital.Aspirin <https://www.theguardian.com/science/aspirin> 
could substantially reduce the number of people developing cancer of the colon 
and rectum, Rothwell confirmed.

"These are very positive results", said Mark Flannagan, chief executive of the 
charity Beating BowelCancer <https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer>. The 
study "reinforces the message that aspirin may be important in significantly 
reducing the number of cases and deaths from bowel cancer".
