The Premieres section typically differs from the main competition (announced 
last week) by featuring films that boast high-profile casts, many directed by 
established indie auteurs.

This year it features Certain Women, a female-led drama that reunites director 
Kelly Reichardt with her Meek’s Cutoff, and Wendy and Lucy star, Michelle 
Williams; the closing night selection The Fundamentals of Caring, starring 
Selena Gomez and Paul Rudd; the Office star John Krasinski’s directorial debut 
The Hollars, in which he co-stars alongside Anna Kendrick; Wiener-Dog, the 
latest ensemble dramedy from Happiness film-maker Todd Solondz, featuring Greta 
Gerwig and Danny DeVito; and Love & Happiness, a Jane Austen novella adaptation 
by Whit Stillman, that sees him once again pair up Kate Beckinsale and Chloë 
Sevigny, stars of his 1998 comedy, The Last Days of Disco.

Also included in the Premieres section are new films from You Can Count On Me 
writer/directorKenneth Lonergan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/kenneth-lonergan>, and Ira Sachs, whose last 
award-winning film, Love is Strange, premiered in the same section in 2014.

Over in the Documentary Premieres section, veteran documentarian Werner Herzog 
returns with LO AND BEHOLD, Reveries of the Connected World, an exploration of 
“the horizons of the connected world”; Spike Lee presents his Michael Jackson 
film, Michael Jackson’s Journey from Motown to Off the Wall, that delves into 
the making of his classic 1979 album. Boyhood writer/director Richard Linklater 
is profiled inRichard Linklater 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-linklater> – dream is destiny; and 
America’s gun policy is put under the microscope in Stephanie Soechtig’s Under 
the Gun.
