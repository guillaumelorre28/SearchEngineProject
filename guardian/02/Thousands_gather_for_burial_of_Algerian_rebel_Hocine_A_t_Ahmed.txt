Tens of thousands of people have gathered in an Algerian village for the 
burial of Hocine Aït Ahmed, a key figure in the country’s struggle for 
independence and later in the political opposition.

Aït Ahmed died last week in Switzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland> at the age of 89. A state 
funeral was held in Algiers on Thursday; his body was transferred to his home 
village, which bears his name, for burial on Friday.

He was the last of the nine so-called sons of Toussaint, who launched an 
uprising against French rule on 1 November 1954. Algerian presidentAbdelaziz 
Bouteflika

, also a veteran of the struggle for independence, declared eight days of 
mourning after Aït Ahmed’s death.

Draped in Algeria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/algeria>’s national flag, 
the coffin was carried in an ambulance through the village, where huge crowds 
filled the streets. “Today and tomorrow, Hocine lives!” they chanted. “Algeria, 
free and democratic!”

The crowd surged forward as the coffin was brought out of the ambulance in 
preparation for the burial, which was expected to take place in the early 
afternoon.

The state funeral was broadcast live on television and a wake was later held 
at the headquarters of the Socialist Forces Front (FFS), the party founded by Aï
t Ahmed in 1963. The funeral cortege then travelled 100 miles (160km) 
south-east to his village.

Aït Ahmed, who was jailed by the French in 1956, was freed after a ceasefire 
in 1962. He went into opposition when Ahmed Ben Bella became president ofAlgeria
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/algeria> the following year. He was 
arrested in 1964 and condemned to death, but he was later freed and left for 
exile in Lausanne in 1966.

He returned to Algeria in 1989 after the FFS was legalised and stood as a 
candidate in the 1999 presidential elections; he withdrew mid-campaign, arguing 
that the vote was rigged in favour of Bouteflika.

Aït Ahmed’s health began to fail in 2012 and he resigned the following year as 
head of the FFS. He died in Lausanne on 23 December.
