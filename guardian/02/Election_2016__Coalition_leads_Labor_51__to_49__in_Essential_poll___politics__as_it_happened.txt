Nighty night

Well that’s sufficient I think for this evening. Blessings to you all for 
tagging along for another day on the campaign trail.

Let’s take stock of Tuesday.

 * Malcolm Turnbull turned the focus to health and medical research but the 
deputy Liberal leaderJulie Bishop fumbled the day for the Coalition by failing 
to comprehend the government’s super policy on 3AW. Turnbull later reasoned 
that superannuation could only be understood by people with brains the size of 
a planet and then proceeded to explain the policy, neatly underscoring his 
point.

 * Bill Shorten borrowed some government money to fund tourism initiatives in 
the north of the country before flying south to Brisbane to commune with 
shoppers in the electorate of Bonner, flanked by wife Chloe, who was presented 
with a large bunch of roses, a gesture she characterised as embarrassing. Later 
there was some kick to kick in the electorate of Griffith. Yes that was just
Mike Bowers and Terri Butler, sure, but we all wish we were there, racing 
around the oval, laughing like there is no tomorrow.

Except of course, there is tomorrow, so we’ll stow the gay abandon for another 
day. Still a long way until the finish line. Have a lovely evening. We’ll do it 
all again in the morning.

Adelaide-based journalist Eugene Boisvert has reached out via the twits this 
afternoon picking up on my ground game post from earlier on – the one where I 
was pondering the union campaign apparatus in marginal seats.He’s sent me a 
story 
<http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/messenger/west-beaches/aeu-targets-marginal-liberal-of-seat-of-hindmarsh-through-schools-over-gonski-funding/news-story/b6db0183afc43e48485e9cc3bfd81ddd>
 he covered from the marginal electorate of Hindmarsh about the Gonski schools 
funding. Hindmarsh is the government’s most marginal seat in SA.

Labor’s candidate in the seat, Steve Georganas, has been working the Gonski 
issue heavily it would seem. The piece from Hindmarsh references the fact 
Georganas held a forum on needs based funding earlier in the year which was 
attended by most local school principals.

AEU volunteers have been door-knocking local residents. In a recent Plympton 
Primary School newsletter, principalSallyann Geddes asked parents to inquire 
about Gonski funding when [Matt Williams, the Liberal member] visited the 
school in March. “This funding is a landmark initiative to fulfil the vision of 
a fair go where all students will have access to educational resources they 
need to reach their full potential,” Ms Geddes wrote. “This funding is at risk 
of being cut at the next election.”

Exactly what I’m talking about, so thanks to Eugene. If folks have other 
examples they can share, let me know. I’d be very interested.

Connie prevails, probs

Gabrielle Chan

To news from Sydney, the Liberal Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells is 
expected to prevail this evening at a NSW state executive meeting overHollie 
Hughes in a political wrestling match for NSW coalition senate ticket.

2015. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian 
The argument was over the number four spot on the senate ticket. Hughes as 
Liberal country vice president hadwon the preselection earlier  
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/concetta-fierravantiwells-loses-vote-to-top-nsw-senate-ticket-to-hollie-hughes-20160319-gnmf6f.html>
in the year when a half senate election was expected. She relinquished her 
position for Fierravanti-Wells on the grounds she was a minister. But the 
double dissolution complicated matters by placing the full Coalition complement 
on the ticket. This left Hughes, supported by the soft right faction (Alex Hawke
) in the unwinnable spot of number six. A factional stand off was in the 
offing, with numbers of people threatening all sorts of mayhem.Malcolm Turnbull 
made it clear - by osmosis - that he wanted his ministers respected. But I’m 
told it has now been resolved in favour of Connie with a little caveat that not 
all factional players are accepting the outcome - 90 minutes before the 6pm 
meeting. A little hope has been offered to those in spots 6,7 and 8. That is, 
with the new senate voting system, you never know your luck in the big city. 
And if you believe that....

With that fine print in mind, the most likely outcome is:

1. Defence minister Marise Payne 2. Cabinet secretary Arthur Sinodinos 3. 
Nationals deputy leader Fiona Nash 4. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells 5. Nationals 
senator John Williams 6. Liberal country vice president Hollie Hughes 7. 
Retired general Jim Molan 8. Strathfield mayor Sang Ok

Who do you think would be more likely to stop and help if your car was 
stranded?

The Essential poll <http://www.essentialvision.com.au/category/essentialreport>
 has the Coalition ahead of Labor on the two party preferred measure, 51% to 
49%.Malcolm Turnbull has seen an improvement in his approval ratings and is 
still ahead as preferred prime minister, although the gap has narrowed. Forty 
percent (down 3%) of respondents thinkMalcolm Turnbull would make the better 
prime minister and 27% (down 1%) thinkBill Shorten would make the better prime 
minister.

But my favourite element of the survey this week is the questions about 
attributes of the leaders measured by our attitudes to them. The questions are 
broad-ranging. Survey participants believe, for example, thatBill Shorten would 
be more likely to stop and help if your car was stranded thanMalcolm Turnbull. 
Shorten is also more trustworthy when it comes to tending the family pet, and 
he wins the contest of who is preferable to have a beer with. Anything to do 
with money, Turnbull wins, except a question about who would be more likely to 
lend you $100 if you were skint – Shorten wins that one. People would prefer to 
go on holidays with Turnbull, or have him round to dinner, people also suspect 
Turnbull is a better cook. Strictly in the go figure territory, but kind of 
great as Tuesday afternoon diversions go.

A tiny glimpse into the ground game

I was talking to an MP this week who was pointing me in the direction of the 
labour movement’s campaign apparatus in marginal seats. The feeling was the 
effort is very substantial. It’s one of those things that is happening out on 
the ground, but it hard to get visibility on it at the national level. It’s 
hard to get visibility even at the local level because interest groups like the 
ACTU have gotten much better at blending in. The ACTU is not out there 
advertising the community outreach, waving placards in ACTU sweat shirts, 
although there’s a bit of that – mainly, the foot soldiers are ordinary 
workers, door knocking and phone banking and organising. Nurses, community 
workers, teachers, factory workers.

Dave Oliver gets a question about the election campaign apparatus during this 
press conference. He says the architecture has been in place for the past 
twelve months. By any measure, this is a substantial campaign operation.

We’ve had people in marginal electorates in place since June last year right 
around the country. We’ve been building up local community and activist groups. 
We’ve been talking to other 400,000 people over the telephone, we’re talking to 
undecided voters. We’ve built our social media reach to over 2m and we’ve now 
got 20,000 people that have put their hand up acting as volunteers during this 
campaign.

But he says this isn’t just a campaign investment, it’s going to be a 
permanent part of the union movement’s activism.

But I also want to stress that this campaigning capacity, while it is ramping 
up during the course of this federal election – it’s something that we’ll not 
dismantle and we’ll continue to campaign on issues that matter most to workers 
and their families, particularly if this government is reelected and they’re 
going to come after penalty rates to start really cutting the pay even further 
of low paid workers, we’ll continue to use that campaigning capacity 
irrespective of who is in office.

Around the the Mural Hall, the ACTU is saying today’s minimum wage increase is 
not enough.Dave Oliver is flanked by a number of workers on the minimum wage.

Cass is a childcare worker.

Any increase is a great increase but in this day and age we just think minimum 
wage is a bit outdated and it needs to be rectified.

Persisting with nativism, briefly, this from the news wire service AAP, 
travelling with the deputy prime ministerBarnaby Joyce in Narrabri today.

Barnaby Joyce isn’t backing away from controversial comments linking Labor’s 
live export ban to a surge in asylum seeker boats. The deputy prime minister 
believes his comments were grounded by fact, pointing to threats by a senior 
Indonesian minister last year to release a “human tsunami” of asylum seekers in 
response to pressure from Canberra over the Bali nine executions. “People can 
argue with me all they want but it’s going to be really hard to argue with a 
senior Indonesian minister,” Mr Joyce told AAP on Tuesday. The Nationals leader 
said he never intended - and didn’t create - a diplomatic incident with 
Jakarta. But he believes there’s been an overreaction to the comments. “You can 
argue about the causation issue, but you can’t argue about the correlation.”

(I think a statistician would advise at this point that correlation doesn’t 
equal causation. But there’s probably not much point, right?)

Tony Abbott, precursor to Donald Trump

Roger Cohen, a columnist with the New York Times, has penned a column 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/31/opinion/australia-does-anxiety.html?smid=tw-share&_r=1>
 headlined “Australia Does Anxiety.” I suspect this column is slightly more 
about America Does Anxiety, specifically anxiety aboutDonald Trump in the White 
House, but some choice words aboutTony Abbott follow.

Australia shows signs of the fundamental divide in developed societies today — 
between an international urban elite of progressive social values and angry 
nativists suspicious of the outsider, blindsided by globalization, wary of 
change, and unsure of their children’s future.

Indeed, [Tony] Abbott, a loudmouth with a loony streak, was in some ways a 
precursor of Donald Trump. His slogans had three words — “Stop the boats” 
(immigrants), “Ax the tax” (climate change). He also made a speech in front of 
a sign, referring to then-prime minister Julia Gillard, that said “Ditch the 
witch” (misogyny). He crashed and burned in a gale of gaffes — bringing back 
knighthoods andbestowing one 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-philip/11368977/Tony-Abbott-mocked-after-making-Prince-Philip-a-knight-of-Australia.html?version=meter+at+2&module=meter-Links&pgtype=article&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=meter-links-click>
 on Prince Philip of Britain was an example — but only after he had ranted his 
way to the top job. This precedent is troubling. Trump has gotten three-word 
slogans down to two-word epithets — “Little Marco,” “Lyin’ Ted,” “Crooked 
Hillary” and so on — and he has raised Abbott several notches on the 
mob-mobilizing meanness front.

On the nativists versus global progressives political realignment in the US, 
there’s a terrific Politico piece thatI’ve already shared on my Facebook page 
<https://www.facebook.com/murphy.katharine/> which is very much worth your time.

If you’ve been with us all day you’ll recall the Labor man David Feeney 
courted controversy once again by posting a picture on social media about a 
grant to a local school that is currently under investigation Victorian 
Registration and Qualifications Authority. TheBatman 
<http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/batman.htm> MP boasted on Twitter of the 
“wonderful school community” at the Maharishi school in Reservoir in 
Melbourne’s north, after the school secured $500,000 through the federal 
government’s Department of Education capital grants program.

It was worth trying to establish what had occurred. A spokeswoman for Feeney 
told us: “He was [visiting the school] as a local member.”

“He was invited,” she said. “He was there in his capacity as a local member 
alongside Greens and government representatives doing his job as a local MP. 
I’ve seen the comments about the school being under investigation. He was just 
there in his capacity as a local member.”

Guardian Australia has contacted the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> to ask why funding was 
awarded to the school given the investigation.

The Greens candidate Alex Bhathal and Nationals senator for Victoria, Bridget 
McKenzie, were also at the ceremony at the school on Monday.


A spokesman for Bhathal said he understood her invitation was “a last-minute 
one” but that he would have to investigate further as to why she had attended 
and whether she knew about the controversy surrounding the school.

McKenzie’s office has been contacted for comment.

deputy Liberal leaderJulie Bishop fumbled the day for the Coalition by failing 
to comprehend the government’s super policy on 3AW. Turnbull later reasoned 
that superannuation could only be understood by people with brains the size of 
a planet and then proceeded to explain the policy, neatly underscoring his 
point.

Adelaide-based journalist Eugene Boisvert has reached out via the twits this 
afternoon picking up on my ground game post from earlier on – the one where I 
was pondering the union campaign apparatus in marginal seats.He’s sent me a 
story 
<http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/messenger/west-beaches/aeu-targets-marginal-liberal-of-seat-of-hindmarsh-through-schools-over-gonski-funding/news-story/b6db0183afc43e48485e9cc3bfd81ddd>
 he covered from the marginal electorate of Hindmarsh about the Gonski schools 
funding. Hindmarsh is the government’s most marginal seat in SA.

Labor’s candidate in the seat, Steve Georganas, has been working the Gonski 
issue heavily it would seem. The piece from Hindmarsh references the fact 
Georganas held a forum on needs based funding earlier in the year which was 
attended by most local school principals.

AEU volunteers have been door-knocking local residents. In a recent Plympton 
Primary School newsletter, principalSallyann Geddes asked parents to inquire 
about Gonski funding when [Matt Williams, the Liberal member] visited the 
school in March. “This funding is a landmark initiative to fulfil the vision of 
a fair go where all students will have access to educational resources they 
need to reach their full potential,” Ms Geddes wrote. “This funding is at risk 
of being cut at the next election.”

Exactly what I’m talking about, so thanks to Eugene. If folks have other 
examples they can share, let me know. I’d be very interested.
 
This is not in the least bit terrifying.
 Doorknocking in paradise.  
To news from Sydney, the Liberal Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells is 
expected to prevail this evening at a NSW state executive meeting overHollie 
Hughes in a political wrestling match for NSW coalition senate ticket.

Fierravanti-Wells in her office in Parliament House on Tuesday 1st December 
2015. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian 
The argument was over the number four spot on the senate ticket. Hughes as 
Liberal country vice president hadwon the preselection earlier  
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/concetta-fierravantiwells-loses-vote-to-top-nsw-senate-ticket-to-hollie-hughes-20160319-gnmf6f.html>
in the year when a half senate election was expected. She relinquished her 
position for Fierravanti-Wells on the grounds she was a minister. But the 
double dissolution complicated matters by placing the full Coalition complement 
on the ticket. This left Hughes, supported by the soft right faction (Alex Hawke
) in the unwinnable spot of number six. A factional stand off was in the 
offing, with numbers of people threatening all sorts of mayhem.Malcolm Turnbull 
made it clear - by osmosis - that he wanted his ministers respected. But I’m 
told it has now been resolved in favour of Connie with a little caveat that not 
all factional players are accepting the outcome - 90 minutes before the 6pm 
meeting. A little hope has been offered to those in spots 6,7 and 8. That is, 
with the new senate voting system, you never know your luck in the big city. 
And if you believe that....

With that fine print in mind, the most likely outcome is:

1. Defence minister Marise Payne 2. Cabinet secretary Arthur Sinodinos 3. 
Nationals deputy leader Fiona Nash 4. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells 5. Nationals 
senator John Williams 6. Liberal country vice president Hollie Hughes 7. 
Retired general Jim Molan 8. Strathfield mayor Sang Ok
 
The Essential poll <http://www.essentialvision.com.au/category/essentialreport>
 has the Coalition ahead of Labor on the two party preferred measure, 51% to 
49%.Malcolm Turnbull has seen an improvement in his approval ratings and is 
still ahead as preferred prime minister, although the gap has narrowed. Forty 
percent (down 3%) of respondents thinkMalcolm Turnbull would make the better 
prime minister and 27% (down 1%) thinkBill Shorten would make the better prime 
minister.

But my favourite element of the survey this week is the questions about 
attributes of the leaders measured by our attitudes to them. The questions are 
broad-ranging. Survey participants believe, for example, thatBill Shorten would 
be more likely to stop and help if your car was stranded thanMalcolm Turnbull. 
Shorten is also more trustworthy when it comes to tending the family pet, and 
he wins the contest of who is preferable to have a beer with. Anything to do 
with money, Turnbull wins, except a question about who would be more likely to 
lend you $100 if you were skint – Shorten wins that one. People would prefer to 
go on holidays with Turnbull, or have him round to dinner, people also suspect 
Turnbull is a better cook. Strictly in the go figure territory, but kind of 
great as Tuesday afternoon diversions go.
 
I know the Essential poll is around this afternoon. I’ll hunt it down and post 
on that next.

I was talking to an MP this week who was pointing me in the direction of the 
labour movement’s campaign apparatus in marginal seats. The feeling was the 
effort is very substantial. It’s one of those things that is happening out on 
the ground, but it hard to get visibility on it at the national level. It’s 
hard to get visibility even at the local level because interest groups like the 
ACTU have gotten much better at blending in. The ACTU is not out there 
advertising the community outreach, waving placards in ACTU sweat shirts, 
although there’s a bit of that – mainly, the foot soldiers are ordinary 
workers, door knocking and phone banking and organising. Nurses, community 
workers, teachers, factory workers.

Dave Oliver gets a question about the election campaign apparatus during this 
press conference. He says the architecture has been in place for the past 
twelve months. By any measure, this is a substantial campaign operation.

We’ve had people in marginal electorates in place since June last year right 
around the country. We’ve been building up local community and activist groups. 
We’ve been talking to other 400,000 people over the telephone, we’re talking to 
undecided voters. We’ve built our social media reach to over 2m and we’ve now 
got 20,000 people that have put their hand up acting as volunteers during this 
campaign.

But he says this isn’t just a campaign investment, it’s going to be a 
permanent part of the union movement’s activism.

But I also want to stress that this campaigning capacity, while it is ramping 
up during the course of this federal election – it’s something that we’ll not 
dismantle and we’ll continue to campaign on issues that matter most to workers 
and their families, particularly if this government is reelected and they’re 
going to come after penalty rates to start really cutting the pay even further 
of low paid workers, we’ll continue to use that campaigning capacity 
irrespective of who is in office.
 
Around the the Mural Hall, the ACTU is saying today’s minimum wage increase is 
not enough.Dave Oliver is flanked by a number of workers on the minimum wage.

Cass is a childcare worker.

Any increase is a great increase but in this day and age we just think minimum 
wage is a bit outdated and it needs to be rectified.
 
Persisting with nativism, briefly, this from the news wire service AAP, 
travelling with the deputy prime ministerBarnaby Joyce in Narrabri today.

Barnaby Joyce isn’t backing away from controversial comments linking Labor’s 
live export ban to a surge in asylum seeker boats. The deputy prime minister 
believes his comments were grounded by fact, pointing to threats by a senior 
Indonesian minister last year to release a “human tsunami” of asylum seekers in 
response to pressure from Canberra over the Bali nine executions. “People can 
argue with me all they want but it’s going to be really hard to argue with a 
senior Indonesian minister,” Mr Joyce told AAP on Tuesday. The Nationals leader 
said he never intended - and didn’t create - a diplomatic incident with 
Jakarta. But he believes there’s been an overreaction to the comments. “You can 
argue about the causation issue, but you can’t argue about the correlation.”

(I think a statistician would advise at this point that correlation doesn’t 
equal causation. But there’s probably not much point, right?)
 
Roger Cohen, a columnist with the New York Times, has penned a column 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/31/opinion/australia-does-anxiety.html?smid=tw-share&_r=1>
 headlined “Australia Does Anxiety.” I suspect this column is slightly more 
about America Does Anxiety, specifically anxiety aboutDonald Trump in the White 
House, but some choice words aboutTony Abbott follow.

Australia shows signs of the fundamental divide in developed societies today — 
between an international urban elite of progressive social values and angry 
nativists suspicious of the outsider, blindsided by globalization, wary of 
change, and unsure of their children’s future.

Indeed, [Tony] Abbott, a loudmouth with a loony streak, was in some ways a 
precursor of Donald Trump. His slogans had three words — “Stop the boats” 
(immigrants), “Ax the tax” (climate change). He also made a speech in front of 
a sign, referring to then-prime minister Julia Gillard, that said “Ditch the 
witch” (misogyny). He crashed and burned in a gale of gaffes — bringing back 
knighthoods andbestowing one 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-philip/11368977/Tony-Abbott-mocked-after-making-Prince-Philip-a-knight-of-Australia.html?version=meter+at+2&module=meter-Links&pgtype=article&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=meter-links-click>
 on Prince Philip of Britain was an example — but only after he had ranted his 
way to the top job. This precedent is troubling. Trump has gotten three-word 
slogans down to two-word epithets — “Little Marco,” “Lyin’ Ted,” “Crooked 
Hillary” and so on — and he has raised Abbott several notches on the 
mob-mobilizing meanness front.

On the nativists versus global progressives political realignment in the US, 
there’s a terrific Politico piece thatI’ve already shared on my Facebook page 
<https://www.facebook.com/murphy.katharine/> which is very much worth your time.
