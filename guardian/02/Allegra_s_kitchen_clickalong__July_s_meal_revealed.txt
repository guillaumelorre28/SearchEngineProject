The clickalong is back! Just in case you've been living under a ladle since we 
launched it last year, it's our very own real-time online cookery class. We 
give you a shopping list of ingredients in plenty of time for you to assemble 
the ingredients for one of my exclusive recipes, then on the designated day 
(the 29th) everyone gathers around their keyboards, which need to be within 
hollering distance of the kitchen, for an 8pm kick-off. Follow mystep-by-step 
instructions

, and within the hour you should have created a supper to be proud of.

Last month's adrenaline-fuelled 60 minutes resulted in a rich variety of 
summery fish stews

 crafted by WoM-ers all over the world and complete with satisfyingly glossy 
rouille, wafts of scented steam, and the odd bit of misplaced garlic. Gohere

approaches.

So, to this month's dish - or dishes. This month's kitchen clickalong is going 
to be a bit of a challenge, because I've opted for ... a full meze spread in an 
hour! The list of ingredients will be posted on the blog on the 23rd. There 
will undoubtedly be quite a lot of them, but we are making a fine feast for 
four here, and I think it'll come to less than the bill for last month's fish 
stew.

I'm really looking forward to making this together, so join me, Susi and an 
international cast of meze cooks here on the 29th.

Lots of love,
Allegra x
