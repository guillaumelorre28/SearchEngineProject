Your report on the death of Alan Sillitoe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/25/alan-sillitoe-writer-dies> (26 
April) states in the 1960 film adaptation of Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, 
Arthur Seaton "beds the wife of an older workmate and then, on the night when 
she is aborting his child, seduces her younger sister". This is indeed what 
happens in the novel, but the censor ensured the film told a far more 
conventional story. The younger sister (Winnie) does not appear in the film at 
all, while Brenda's backstreet abortion was shown to be unsuccessful and she 
later miscarries. The moral ambiguity of the novel was greatly compromised, 
particularly with regard to the female characters. Sillitoe spoke of his 
frustration at the censorship of his script and despite the impact made by the 
film, the novel is the true record of his greatness.
