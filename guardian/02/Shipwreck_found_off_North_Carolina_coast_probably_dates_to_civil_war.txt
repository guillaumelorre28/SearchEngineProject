A shipwreck discovered off the coast of North Carolina is likely one of three 
confederate blockade runners known to have been lost in the area, 
archaeologists have said.

 The remains of the iron-hulled steamer were located on 27 February near Oak 
Island. It would be the firstCivil War-era

vessel found in the area in decades, said the North Carolina Office of State 
Archaeology.

 Billy Ray Morris, director of the state’s underwater archaeology branch, said 
he expected to be able to positively identify the 225ft (68-metre) vessel when 
he leads a dive team to examine it on Wednesday.

 “To turn up a new wreck is a pretty big deal,” he said, adding sonar images 
showed the vessel to be largely intact.

 The shipwreck was located in the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the Cape Fear 
River near Fort Caswell, about 30 miles (48km) downstream from Wilmington, 
according to the state.

 Given the wreck’s size, Morris said he suspected it was the Agnes E Fry, 
which was used to elude union naval vessels that sought to keep supplies from 
reaching the confederacy at the port of Wilmington during the civil war.

 The city was the last major Atlantic port to remain under confederate 
control, before falling to union forces in January 1865.

 Two other blockade runners known to have been lost in the area but never 
located, the Spunkie and Georgianna McCaw, were shorter in length, Morris said.

 “It is almost guaranteed to be one of those three blockade runners,” he said. 
“This one is spot on for where one of those runners ought to be. It’s the right 
shape.”
