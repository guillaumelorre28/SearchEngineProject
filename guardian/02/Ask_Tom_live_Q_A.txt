Are you wondering where's hot now or perhaps looking ahead to an autumn 
half-term break? Tom will be online at noon (BST) on Wednesday, replying to 
your questions on these and any other travel queries you have. If you have a 
dilemma or would just like some inspiration or general advice, please post a 
comment below.

Tom will get to as many as he can in an hour, but due to the volume of 
questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
