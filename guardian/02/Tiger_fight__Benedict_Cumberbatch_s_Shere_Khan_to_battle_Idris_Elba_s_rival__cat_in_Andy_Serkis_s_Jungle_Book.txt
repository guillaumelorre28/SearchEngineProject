Benedict Cumberbatch will voice the villainous tiger Shere Khan 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/benedict-cumberbatch-joins-jungle-book-726146>
 in Andy Serkis’s version of the Jungle Book, one of two competing takes on the 
iconic Rudyard Kipling tale being put together in Hollywood.
Serkis is making his directing debut on Warner Bros’s reimagination of 
Kipling’s 1894 fable, which will arrive in cinemas on 21 October 2016. A 
separate version from Disney, with Jon Favreau in charge of the cameras and 
Idris Elba lined up to voice Shere Khan, is due 12 months earlier.


Shere Khan, a nefarious man-eating tiger who views Kipling’s hero Mowgli as 
his lifelong enemy, was voiced by George Sanders in Disney’s animated 1967 
musical version of The Jungle Book, thus far the most famous incarnation. Both 
new films appear to be based largely on the chapter Mowgli and his Brothers in 
Kipling’s book, which has traditionally been used as the source material for a 
number of Hollywood adaptations over the years.

Serkis has won plaudits for his second unit direction on Peter Jackson’s 
Hobbit trilogy, which included putting together the celebrated barrel sequence 
in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. He is also noted as a CGI motion 
capture specialist for his work in front of the cameras on The Lord of the 
Rings and Planet of the Apes series.

Warner Bros’ version of The Jungle Book is said to be darker than the Disney 
take. While Serkis has not yet completed casting, the appointment of 
Cumberbatch suggests he is ready to bring out the big guns. The British actor 
also worked with the film-maker as the voice of the titular dragon in The 
Desolation of Smaug and will return in final Hobbit instalment The Battle of 
Five Armies this December.

Nevertheless, Warner has some way to go if it wants to match the star quality 
currently attached to the Disney version. Favreau’s film, which will be a mix 
of CGI and live action, is due to feature voice talent fromBill Murray as Baloo 
the bear

, Christopher Walken as King Louie the ape, Ben Kingsley as friendly black 
panther Bagheera, Scarlett Johansson as the hissing, hypnotising python, Kaa, 
Twelve Years a Slave’s Lupita Nyong’o as mother wolf Raksha and Breaking Bad’s 
Giancarlo Esposito as wolf pack leader Akela.
