It's harvest time for new jam and chutney service Inner City Pickle 
<http://www.innercitypickle.co.uk/index.html>. Eira Ellis-Evans, 44, from 
Adamsdown is busy in her kitchen making delicious pickles, jams, preserves, 
conserves and chutneys as the Autumn glut of local food comes pouring in.

On top of that, as word of her local no-frills home delivery service has 
spread across the internet, each morning she is finding more and more empty 
jars on her doorstep for her to recycle along with locally donated bags of 
local fruit and veg. Her unique blend of scrumptious pickles teamed with the 
community cycle of her operation has captured Cardiff.

The reputation of Inner City Pickle  
<http://www.innercitypickle.co.uk/index.html>has grown since Eira's kitchen was 
registered by Cardiff Council in July. She plans to open a stall at Riverside 
Market later this year in time for Christmas – but for the moment she is riding 
the wave of the September harvest.

"I always cooked for the family but it's only in the last couple of months 
that my partner help me set up the website and friends helped with twitter that 
it's really taken off," she told me.

"Anybody who knows me knows I'm big on recycling jars for putting jams in. It 
seems to be even more so now the incinerator isSplott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cardiff/splott> is planned – so I'm even more 
determined to recycle.

"At the moment there's lots of gluts coming in so I'm cooking 24/7. It's 
quietly taken over my life as it's harvest now and I'm permanently delivering 
or cooking."

Eira posts leaflets through doors on roads in Splott and Adamsdown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cardiff/adamsdown> requesting empty jars for 
collection, and friends and family have been giving her local produce from 
their gardens and allotments to turn into tasty treats. Eira washes and 
sterilises the jars and spends hours late into the night cooking, labelling and 
getting the jars ready in her spare time as a part time council escort for the 
school buses.

Local produce so far has turned green tomato chutney, courgette relish, red 
current jelly, red onion chutney, yellow plum jam and following a donation of 
pears this week, a pear jam. The Autumn collection also includes apple chutney, 
spiced beetroot and orange chutney and marrow pickle. Eira sells the jars from 
£2 to £10 for four and travels around the city with her 'wally-trolley' walking 
everywhere by foot to deliver.

"I think because many people know me and I'm always walking about the city and 
neighbourhood I'm getting all the jars and produce come in so I can sell at a 
reasonable price. It's a win win situation.

"There doesn't seem to be anyone else doing this for Cardiff. I put a little 
cloth on the jars but we keep things basic, minimal and not fancy. It's just 
quality produce turned into something wonderful."

Eira says she loves what she does and has no interest of expanding the 
enterprise outside Cardiff. So if you see her walking with her walley-trolley 
be sure to say hi! See theInner City Pickle website here
