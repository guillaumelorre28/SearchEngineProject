The number of hospitals that have to turn patients away from A&E rose sharply 
at the start of the year, compared with the same period in 2015.

Referred to as diverts, such incidents reflect the enormous pressure the 
health service faces,especially in winter

The NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> weekly winter update showed 
there were 27 diverts last week and 25 in the week before. This compares with 
an a weekly average of 20 last winter, when the health service had to cope with 
record A&E attendances.

The NHS says diverts caused by lack of physical or staff capacity should be a 
last resort and should be agreed with neighbouring trusts.

“This sharp rise in the number of hospitals having to turn patients away is a 
stark illustration of just how much pressure A&E departments are under this 
winter,” said Heidi Alexander, the shadow health secretary.

“Ministers might be in denial, but the reality is that on their watch hospital 
departments have become dangerously full, patients are waiting hours in A&E and 
the NHS is facing a nurse staffing crisis. It is little wonder therefore that 
hospital bosses have no other option but to close their doors in order to cope.”

The highest figures recorded for winter attendances were in December 2014, 
when the NHS dealt with 446,473 in the week ending 21 December, and 440,428 in 
the week ending 14 December.

“These latest A&E attendances and emergency admissions statistics show our 
hospitals remain under pressure,” said Richard Barker, the interim national 
director of commissioning operations for NHS England.

“This data was collated before the bad weather began to bite, so we can expect 
attendances to rise, bringing with them further seasonal pressures.”
