No bed of roses

This image from the major Japanese photographer Eikoh Hosoe’s breakout 1962 
photobook Ordeal By Roses superimposes times and cultures. The backdrop is a 
painting of art history’s ultimate gay pin-up, Saint Sebastian, his head and 
body surreally ornamented by a baroque clock. The actual subject however can be 
found between the saint’s legs: the dark prince of Japanese literature, Yukio 
Mishima.

End credits

History remembers Mishima as much for his death as his prolific writing. His 
ritual suicide was a horrific, stage-managed end to a life obsessed with death, 
beauty and Japanese identity.

Fatal attraction

These fixations are writ large here with the morbid sexuality of Saint 
Sebastian (Guido Reni’s version was supposedly the first image Mishima 
masturbated to). Defying the clock, the muscle-bound author is frozen forever 
in the photo.

West side story

Hosoe’s mash-up also evokes Mishima’s conflicted relationship with the west. 
He raged against westernised Japan, but while he longed for a return to Samurai 
values, he wore western fashions and decked out his Italian-style Tokyo villa 
with baroque and rococo artefacts.
