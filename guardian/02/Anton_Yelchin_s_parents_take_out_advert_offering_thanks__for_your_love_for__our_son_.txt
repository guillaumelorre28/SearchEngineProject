On Monday, producer JJ Abrams confirmed that Yelchin’s character, Chekov, will 
not be recast with another actor in subsequent films.

“I can’t possibly imagine that,” Abrams told Postmedia Network 
<http://www.torontosun.com/2016/07/14/jj-abrams-star-trek-wont-replace-anton-yelchin>
, “and I think Anton deserves better.”

Abrams said that discussions were still under way about how Chekov’s absence 
would be explained.

“I have thought about it, we’re working on it, and it’s too early to talk 
about it,” he said.
