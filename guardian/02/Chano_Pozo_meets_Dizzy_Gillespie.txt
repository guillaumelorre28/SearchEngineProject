It was in Chano Pozo's Harlem apartment in September 1947 that Dizzy Gillespie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/dizzy-gillespie> met Cuba's greatest 
percussionist, newly arrived from Havana. By the end of the month, Pozo was 
adding his conga drum to Gillespie's incendiary big band at a Carnegie Hall 
concert, and a new form of Afro-Cuban jazz was born. The collaboration was 
short-lived – Pozo was murdered outside an uptown bar barely a year later – but 
its consequences live on.
