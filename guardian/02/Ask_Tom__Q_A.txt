Tom Hall was on Guardian Travel this week offering expert advice. He will be 
kicking off with ideas on places to go this summer where your pound will go 
further ... but of course you can ask his advice on anything you like to do 
with travel.

Tom will get to as many questions as he can in an hour, but due to the volume, 
he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. Unanswered questions 
will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.

So, if you're in need of inspiration, post a question for him below.
