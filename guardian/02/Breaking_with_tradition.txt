Chaampi is only a few kilometres outside Kathmandu, but the steep, dark hills 
that surround it make it feel much further away. Laxmi is 70 years old and a 
traditional birth attendant (TBA). "In 50 years," she says, "I have delivered 
more than 700 babies plus 1,000 cows, goats and buffaloes, but the government 
says it doesn't need me any more."

Women like Laxmi are at the heart of an international debate about the future 
of TBAs. Many countries, such as Nepal, are phasing them out in line with 
commitments to strengthen the formal health system and, as stated in MDG5, to 
increase the proportion of births attended by skilled health professionals.

"TBAs used to receive training and a small stipend from the government," says 
Dr Pradhan from the UN Population Fund in Kathmandu. "But after the 
introduction of the MDGs they did a survey and found that they do not have the 
skills to deal with many of the complications that can arise during delivery."

"Women still think I am the one to come to," says Laxmi. "They do not want to 
see a male doctor and I have more experience than most health workers." She 
advises women to seek medical care but the hospital is 8km away and the local 
government health worker is too overstretched to attend every birth. Laxmi, 
believing her help is better than nothing, continues to work as a TBA.

"If I had the choice of giving birth alone or with Laxmi," says Sanjhana, a 
programme officer from SPN, "I'd want Laxmi to be there. Wouldn't you?"
