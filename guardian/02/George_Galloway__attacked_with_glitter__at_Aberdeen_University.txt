Police were called to Aberdeen University after George Galloway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgegalloway> was bombarded with 
glitter.

The former MP was giving a lecture on Tuesday evening when he was targeted by 
a group of five protesters who covered him in glitter. They were ejected from 
the lecture hall and Galloway continued his talk.

Galloway, who is from Dundee, tweeted: “Someone calling themselves ‘Trans’ and 
an ‘anarchist’ led a five person attack on me on the platform atAberdeen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/aberdeen> University. I continued.”

Galloway said he had been left feeling “unwell”, tweeting: “I know [sic] have 
an unknown substance in my eyes and lungs and feel a little unwell. But the 
struggle continues:-).”


He added that his pregnant wife had “leapt forward” to defend him during the 
attack.

good shower.

Feeling better thanks to all; just needed a good shower. Thought not as much 
as the "Student Left" who attacked me & tried vainly to stop me

Politics student Finlay Rowden apologised to Galloway, saying: “I could say 
this a million times but it still wouldn’t be enough. I really do say sorry 
from the bottom of my heart.”

He added that he was proud to have organised the event but felt “ashamed that 
some morons let the university down”.
