A Separation <https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-separation> has won the best 
foreign language film Oscar at the Academy Award ceremony currently taking 
place at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood. The Iranian divorce drama, directed by 
Asghar Farhadi and starring Peyman Maadi and Leila Hatami, has been in pole 
position for the Oscar ever since it carried off the Golden Globe last month.

A Separation was up against four other contenders, including Agnieszka 
Holland's second world war drama In Darkness and the Israeli father-son rivalry 
story Footnote. It was confidently expected to win the award after Pedro 
Almodovar's The Skin I Live In, which beat it to the best foreign film Bafta a 
fortnight ago, was not submitted as Spain's official entry.

A Separation, which examines the moral and social conflicts that arise in a 
Tehran family after a couple apply for a divorce, was recently criticised as a 
"dirty picture" by Iranian hardliners, despite its commercial success in the 
country.
