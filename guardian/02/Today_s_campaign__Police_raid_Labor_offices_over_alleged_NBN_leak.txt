Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife, throughout the sensual world 
proclaim: It’s Friday!

Welcome to the end of week two of the election campaign, only six more to go. 
Six weeks to go and it has already got quite ugly, the dog whistling already 
served up, the members interests – specifically failures to declare them – 
already nipping the parties’ backsides.

The big picture

The dominant story of the day, by far, is the Australian federal police raid 
of Labor MPStephen Conroy’s parliamentary offices 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/19/australian-federal-police-raid-labor-party-offices-in-melbourne>
 along with a house in Brunswick and a office relating to a staffer of 
opposition communications spokesmanJason Clare. It’s understood the operation 
relates to a leak about the National Broadband Network.

As the Australian reports 
<http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/federal-election-2016-afp-raids-conroys-office-alp-advisers-house/news-story/617d121a9332848af6462f078667a84d>
, the decision to investigate the opposition during an election campaign is 
sparking a political storm. The government’s campaign spokesmanMathias Cormann 
has said the AFP is an independent organisation which makes its own decisions.

The AFP has confirmed the raids and released a statement saying the matter was 
first referred in December. It said it would now spend time examining and 
analysing the material collected during the raids.

The Oz is reporting AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin, contacted justice 
minister, ­Michael Keenan, as the raids ­began, to tell him of the “politically 
sensitive action”.

Fairfax Media is reporting the raids are over a leak to the news outlet  
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/afp-raid-alp-offices-in-melbourne-over-nbn-leaks-20160519-gozcdw.html>
that costs were blowing out in the rollout of the NBN and it was running behind 
schedule. It says about 20 NBN Co employees had been interviewed by the AFP in 
the lead-up to the raids.

The Herald-Sun is reporting the leaks began shortly after the Coalition won 
government 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/afp-raid-alp-offices-in-melbourne-over-nbn-leaks-20160519-gozcdw.html>
 in 2013 but had “got more serious” in recent months.

Labor has come out swinging with Bill Shorten labelling the raids 
“unprecedented”. Shadow attorney-general,Mark Dreyfus, questioned the operation:

We have never witnessed such an extraordinary action during a federal election 
campaign.

What we also know is that there have been other serious leaks out of 
government – including relating to national security, defence and the federal 
budget – and none of them have resulted in federal police raids.

Malcolm Turnbull has declined to comment on the raids.

Meanwhile, Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, is defending hiring backpackers 
as au pairs on his Victorian farm 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/federal-election/greens-leader-richard-di-natale-defends-pay-to-backpackers-hired-to-look-after-children-work-on-farm/news-story/43c20e2f0fcee913d4a1eb84dd641318>
for $150 a week, plus food and board. Advertisements posted by his wife,Lucy 
Quarterman, have been dug up but Di Natale has defended them as meeting minimum 
wage requirements as the backpackers work up to 25 hours a week.

The advertisement also offers couples the same rate as a single person. Posted 
on backpackerjobboard.com.au it reads:

We live a sustainable lifestyle with water tanks and solar power. Dad works 
away a lot during the week so I am looking for an extra pair of hands around 
the place to entertain the lads and help with cooking and general domestic 
­duties. We have self-contained accommodation with own bathroom, kitchen, TV & 
stereo. A car is also available. Will take ­couples but weekly wage remains the 
same.

One backpacker was employed on the terms and another two have been hired 
according to Di Natale’s office.

On the campaign trail

Malcolm Turnbull arrived in Tasmania last night. He and Bill Shorten were both 
in Penrith last night for the Daily Telegraph’s “Go West” gala awards 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/fairgowest/champions-of-the-west-list-of-winners-reflects-broad-reach-and-potential-of-community/news-story/e3191f400706019ee82e69ed4e5e6547>
. The Go West campaign has been going for months and was about the needs of 
western Sydney.

And another thing(s)

Nick Xenophon could well hold the balance of power in the new government but 
Lenore Taylorfound the publicity-hungry senator hard to pin down for an 
in-depth conversationfor this profile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/19/nick-xenophon-the-anti-politician-poised-to-cause-headaches-whoever-wins-election>
.

Once she did though, the results were illuminating.

As the conversation progresses it becomes apparent Xenophon’s views on the 
various proposed solutions could cause headaches, whoever wins the election.

Booker prize winning author Richard Flanagan has written about the possible 
impact of the re-election of the Coalition on literature in Australia –he 
thinks Malcolm Turnbull would destroy it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/19/be-under-no-illusion-malcolm-turnbull-wants-to-destroy-australian-literature-election-richard-flanagan>
.

It may seem at the moment that the only thing that will save the Australian 
book industry is moving every publisher and writer intoChristopher Pyne’s 
electorate, and making them all wear hi-vis jackets and safety helmets.
