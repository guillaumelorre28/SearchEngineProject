Enough for this evening

That will do for today I reckon. Thanks very much for your company for this 
special edition of Politics Live. We’ll be back in the morning to thunder with 
nostrils flaring until the contest ends next Saturday night.

Let’s take stock of a big day.

Malcolm Turnbull used his campaign launch to declare a vote for the government 
was a vote for stability and certainty in troubled post-Brexit times. In case 
voters missed the message he explicitly urged voters in marginal seats to 
resist the urge to flirt with minor parties and vote one Liberal/National in 
both houses, otherwise chaos would ensure. The Coalition would deliver economic 
security and national security, the prime minister said, overlooking all the 
uncertainties that are, frankly, pretty hard to overlook. Post Brexit, the 
boats were also back in force. The government keep the boats out, unlike the 
dreadful chaos merchants.

Bill Shorten held a second campaign launch in Brisbane to kick off Labor’s 
final week. Anticipating the stability offensive from Homebush, Shorten 
declared you can’t have stability without unity, and without a prime minister 
in a position to lead his party and exert authority. Additionally, Labor used 
launch day to release its final costings and they confirm a Labor government 
would worsen deficits over the forward estimates to the tune of $16bn. Over the 
long term, Labor’s structural savings kick in and the bottomline is better than 
the Coalition’s.

The Greens also launched their campaign in Melbourne. There were no new 
policies, but there were fighting words about standing up to vested interests. 
“We stood firm against the climate-deniers in this government,” Greens leader
Richard Di Natale said. “We paved the way on issues like medicinal cannabis. We 
passed laws on multinational tax avoidance. And of course we put power back 
into the hands of voters by reforming the voting system in the Senate. We are 
the only party who can be trusted to stand up to vested interests. We’ll make 
sure that big business and the super rich pay their fair share so that ordinary 
people can get access to decent schools and hospitals.”

Have a lovely evening. Join us tomorrow.

Can the Coalition really promise certainty when uncertainty abounds?

Lenore Taylor

Some quick thoughts on certainty flowing from the Liberal campaign launch 
today.

campaign at the Novotel Hotel at Olympic Park in Sydney this morning, Saturday 
25th June 2016. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian 
Even if a Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> 
government does not face a hung parliament (and with more than five 
independents looking likely to be elected in the lower house that cannot be 
assured) it will definitely need the backing of either the “chaotic” Labor and 
Greens in the upper house, or the votes ofNick Xenophon and his senators and a 
handful of other independents, including possiblyJacqui Lambie and Pauline 
Hanson.

In truth, major parties have almost never been able to guarantee certain 
passage for their agenda. And demanding voters return to the Coalition in the 
interests of stability ignores the reality that they might be deserting the 
major parties for a reason.

His own late-term ascent to the prime ministership means Turnbull has been 
forced to go to the polls with deep uncertainty hanging over some of his own 
policies – even some he mentioned in his launch speech. “A strong economy means 
a mum whose kids are now at school and wants to work a few more days, or work 
full time, will have plenty of opportunities to do so. And our childcare 
reforms will make it easier for her to do so too,” he said. And they would, 
except the Senate has rejected them and is likely to continue to do so because 
the Coalition insists they are tied to cuts to family payments. Their future 
is, in fact, uncertain.

“A strong economy means we can meet and beat our international obligations to 
address climate change and do so without massive hikes in electricity prices as 
Labor would do,” he said, except the Coalition is being deliberately opaque 
about how it will make its Direct Action plan workable.

Even the $48bn in company tax cuts at the heart of Turnbull’s re-election bid 
cannot be guaranteed. The stated positions of Labor, the Greens and Xenophon 
suggest the Senate is likely to pass tax cuts only for companies with an annual 
turnover up to $10m.

If not now, then soon

Melissa Davey

Just a quick backtrack to catch a bit more of the Greens launch. Richard Di 
Natale said earlier today the party he leads is growing in power. He told 
supporters that the Greens remained hopeful of picking up key lower house seats 
come polling day, particularly in inner Melbourne electorates.

However, he conceded that the party may need to focus on the long-term game 
for several seats it has in its sights, saying “even if they don’t turn Green 
this election, they will be Green seats in coming elections”.

The Greens hopes of gaining seats such as Wills, Higgins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/14/polling-shows-kelly-odwyers-seat-within-greens-grasp-after-collapse-in-support>
 andBatman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/21/david-feeney-criticises-poll-showing-greens-could-win-his-melbourne-seat>
 in Melbourne, and Grayndler and Sydney, took a hit after theLiberals announced 
their preferences would flow to Labor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/15/wa-nationals-attack-liberal-party-over-dirty-preference-deal-with-labor>
 ahead of the Greens.

However, Di Natale said he was not making any concessions by admitting that 
picking up anything more than a couple of seats might be tough come 2 July.

“It’s just a reflection of reality,” he told reporters. “It will be tight. I 
think what you’ll see in a number of these seats it will go down to the wire.

“And if we have a bit of luck, we’ll pick up one or two of those seats. If we 
don’t, then beware the next election. Because the tide is turning. We are 
seeing the Greens vote continuing to grow in many of those lower house seats.”

Q: What about those unlegislated savings measures, that are stuck in the 
senate?

Scott Morrison:

These are our policies. And we are putting them to the Australian people. 
Labor have put their policies.

Q: They may never pass.

Scott Morrison:

The same can be said for Labor’s policies. But they are putting them to the 
Australian people, as we are.

Q: On the count of savings, Labor says their long-term budget is more accurate 
than yours, you have banked on zombie measures that have never passed the 
parliament. Can you guarantee they will pass the parliament?

Scott Morrison says the government’s plan is being put to voters this coming 
weekend.

That’s the plan we need to take the economy forward. But I make this other 
observation on the unlegislated measures. Labor keeps shifting their position. 
Things they said they were opposed to, like the school kids bonus, like the 
pension assets test, the freezing of local government indexation of payments 
and things of that nature – they flipped on.

Q: Do you think that Labor deserves some credit for releasing their costings 
today and allowing a bit of clear air between now and the election?

Scott Morrison:

I’m not going to give Labor the credit for increasing the deficit by $16.5bn. 
They tried to release it under the cover of the campaign launch. You don’t get 
credit for increasing the deficit.

Scott Morrison says a vote for Labor, or the Greens and independents, will be 
a vote for a higher deficit, of at least $16.5bn, and higher debt and taxes.

Labor’s approach will reduce the buffer that we are building at a time when we 
need to increase it. It will make us more vulnerable at a time of uncertainty 
and volatility, at a time we need to make [the budget] stronger.

Scott Morrison:

Labor, under the cover of the government’s campaign launch, confirmed the 
threat they pose to our national economy, in these very uncertain and these 
very sensitive times.

Labor confirmed that they are a triple A threat to our triple A rating,

the deficit by $16.5bn.

Labor has produced this chart of the comparative budget positions over both 
the forward estimates and the medium term in an effort to keep voter’s eyes on 
the 10-year story, which is obviously a stronger budget repair story than the 
four-year story. Labor red line, Liberal blue line.

The difficulty Labor has, however, with the four-year story is highlighted by 
the convulsion around Brexit. Given the risks of a global economic shock, 
there’s not a lot of room to move in the budget in the event stimulus was 
required. Labor was able to offer substantial stimulus during the global 
financial crisis because there was room to move in the budget. Much harder to 
do that now and certainly harder to have that room to move if your fiscal 
consolidation over the four years is slower than the Coalition’s.

Again from Labor’s fiscal policy document, some pertinent notes. I mentioned 
earlier the Coalition’s super reforms and whatChris Bowen said about them in 
the Brisbane press conference (we’ll consult on retrospectivity but preserve 
the same revenue envelope) – dot point one is the specific language on super 
from the document. Additional particulars follow on the efficiency dividend and 
the fate of the energy supplement for Newstart recipients. If you came along to 
our fairness debate in Sydney or listened to the subsequent podcast we had a 
conversation about the energy supplement, which reduces the value of Newstart 
even further.

 * Given Labor’s concerns about the government’s superannuation changes, 
including retrospective elements, Labor would consult with stakeholders and 
take a broader examination of all these measures on coming to government.

 * Labor would also investigate how to replace the 2016-17 budget efficiency 
dividend measure and the 2015-16 MYEFO efficiency target for national cultural 
and collecting institutions in the 2017-18 budget with new measures aimed to 
achieve the same level of budget savings through genuine efficiencies that are 
not targeted at staffing, including targeting contractor and consultant costs, 
advertising and travel.

 * The opposition has not been given the opportunity to properly scrutinise 
the government’s removal of the clean energy supplement or seek advice from the 
department on its effects. In government, Labor will seek further advice on the 
impacts of this measure. Labor has already confirmed that we will conduct an 
independent review of the adequacy of the Newstart allowance – to ensure it can 
keep people out of poverty while also helping people into work.

Back to costings, I mentioned before Labor’s policies increase the deficit by 
$16.5bn over the forward estimates.

This is the rationale from Labor’s fiscal statement 
<https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/7461/attachments/original/1466908979/160626_Fiscal_Plan.pdf?1466908979>
 about why the budget position worsens before the structural savings begin to 
kick in.

Labor has prioritised the need to protect Medicare, deliver needs-based 
schools funding and boost jobs through nation-building infrastructure In the 
near term. As a result Labor will achieve more modest budget improvement than 
the government over the forward estimates. However, our savings are substantial 
and build steadily over time, permanently improving the budget over the medium 
term. The more modest fiscal consolidation over the forward estimates of around 
0.2% of GDP per year (on average) is more than made up for by Labor’s 
structural savings over the medium term. Labor is sensibly and responsibly 
building savings through a deliberate strategy to help support the Australian 
economy through a transition in an uncertain global economic environment, and 
to run larger surpluses over the medium term.

Labor also argues the government’s budget position “is inflated by more than 
$30bn of unlegislated saving measures (so called “zombie” measures), which will 
never pass the parliament.”

If these unlegislated measures are removed from the government’s budget, 
Malcolm Turnbull’s deficit increases by 50% in 2019-20, from $6bn to $9bn. If 
the government was honest and transparent, and abandoned the pretence that 
these measures will ever pass the parliament, the government would barely be in 
surplus over the medium term.

Back to Wentworth

The former Liberal leader John Hewson addressed hundreds of people protesting 
in the normally subdued Sydney suburb of Double Bay – minutes from prime 
minister Turnbull’s harbourside mansion – calling on Turnbull to take stronger 
action on climate change. Speaking at the protest at the same time as Turnbull 
addressed the party faithful at the Coalition’s campaign launch, Hewson said 
the Coalition’s lack of action on climate change was a “national disgrace”.

“I think climate change should be the dominant issue of this campaign – it 
should have been for quite some time,” sad Hewson, who was a once the local 
member for the seat of Wentworth, which includes Double Bay. He said short-term 
politicking from both sides left targets that were inadequate and policies that 
weren’t going to meet those targets. “The one thing that hasn’t failed is 
people like yourselves. The community is way ahead of the political leaders and 
the business leaders on this issue,” he said, urging the crowd to push 
political leaders for a bipartisan approach to climate change. “Enough is 
enough, it’s time to act,” Hewson said.

A spokesperson from GetUp, which organised the protest in coalition with three 
other environment groups, estimated there were about 2000 people in the crowd.

Chris Bowen is asked about the AAA credit rating and whether Labor will 
support the government’s super measures. On super, Bowen says Labor has 
concerns about the retrospective nature of the changes but it will commit to 
raising the same amount of revenue as the government from tightening super 
concessions. On the credit rating Bowen says look at the structural 
improvements to the budget over the 10 years, because the ratings agencies 
will. He says Labor will return to budget balance in the same year as the 
Coalition.

Q: I think there’s barely been a forward estimate in a budget that’s actually 
turned out to be achieved. They’ve all been missed and most spectacularly. 
Beyond your comments about the Liberals, why shouldn’t Australians look at 
those forward estimates and go, yeah, right?


Chris Bowen:

I think the Australian people want a political party, an alternative 
government with a plan not just for the next 10 days but for the next 10 years. 
That provides certainty going forward.

Always a bit tricky, trying to read and report simultaneously. We’ll get there.

Chris Bowen is asked at the press conference in Brisbane whether Labor is 
trying to bury its costings by unveiling them on the day of the Liberal launch.

Chris Bowen:

This is a funny way of hiding something, in a press conference with 40 
journalists? And seven TV cameras? And multiple still cameras – I don’t think 
this can be an accusation fairly levelled.

That will do for today I reckon. Thanks very much for your company for this 
special edition of Politics Live. We’ll be back in the morning to thunder with 
nostrils flaring until the contest ends next Saturday night.

Let’s take stock of a big day.

Malcolm Turnbull used his campaign launch to declare a vote for the government 
was a vote for stability and certainty in troubled post-Brexit times. In case 
voters missed the message he explicitly urged voters in marginal seats to 
resist the urge to flirt with minor parties and vote one Liberal/National in 
both houses, otherwise chaos would ensure. The Coalition would deliver economic 
security and national security, the prime minister said, overlooking all the 
uncertainties that are, frankly, pretty hard to overlook. Post Brexit, the 
boats were also back in force. The government keep the boats out, unlike the 
dreadful chaos merchants.

Bill Shorten held a second campaign launch in Brisbane to kick off Labor’s 
final week. Anticipating the stability offensive from Homebush, Shorten 
declared you can’t have stability without unity, and without a prime minister 
in a position to lead his party and exert authority. Additionally, Labor used 
launch day to release its final costings and they confirm a Labor government 
would worsen deficits over the forward estimates to the tune of $16bn. Over the 
long term, Labor’s structural savings kick in and the bottomline is better than 
the Coalition’s.

The Greens also launched their campaign in Melbourne. There were no new 
policies, but there were fighting words about standing up to vested interests. 
“We stood firm against the climate-deniers in this government,” Greens leader
Richard Di Natale said. “We paved the way on issues like medicinal cannabis. We 
passed laws on multinational tax avoidance. And of course we put power back 
into the hands of voters by reforming the voting system in the Senate. We are 
the only party who can be trusted to stand up to vested interests. We’ll make 
sure that big business and the super rich pay their fair share so that ordinary 
people can get access to decent schools and hospitals.”

Have a lovely evening. Join us tomorrow.

Some quick thoughts on certainty flowing from the Liberal campaign launch 
today.

campaign at the Novotel Hotel at Olympic Park in Sydney this morning, Saturday 
25th June 2016. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian 
Even if a Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> 
government does not face a hung parliament (and with more than five 
independents looking likely to be elected in the lower house that cannot be 
assured) it will definitely need the backing of either the “chaotic” Labor and 
Greens in the upper house, or the votes ofNick Xenophon and his senators and a 
handful of other independents, including possiblyJacqui Lambie and Pauline 
Hanson.

In truth, major parties have almost never been able to guarantee certain 
passage for their agenda. And demanding voters return to the Coalition in the 
interests of stability ignores the reality that they might be deserting the 
major parties for a reason.

His own late-term ascent to the prime ministership means Turnbull has been 
forced to go to the polls with deep uncertainty hanging over some of his own 
policies – even some he mentioned in his launch speech. “A strong economy means 
a mum whose kids are now at school and wants to work a few more days, or work 
full time, will have plenty of opportunities to do so. And our childcare 
reforms will make it easier for her to do so too,” he said. And they would, 
except the Senate has rejected them and is likely to continue to do so because 
the Coalition insists they are tied to cuts to family payments. Their future 
is, in fact, uncertain.

“A strong economy means we can meet and beat our international obligations to 
address climate change and do so without massive hikes in electricity prices as 
Labor would do,” he said, except the Coalition is being deliberately opaque 
about how it will make its Direct Action plan workable.

Even the $48bn in company tax cuts at the heart of Turnbull’s re-election bid 
cannot be guaranteed. The stated positions of Labor, the Greens and Xenophon 
suggest the Senate is likely to pass tax cuts only for companies with an annual 
turnover up to $10m.
 
Just a quick backtrack to catch a bit more of the Greens launch. Richard Di 
Natale said earlier today the party he leads is growing in power. He told 
supporters that the Greens remained hopeful of picking up key lower house seats 
come polling day, particularly in inner Melbourne electorates.

However, he conceded that the party may need to focus on the long-term game 
for several seats it has in its sights, saying “even if they don’t turn Green 
this election, they will be Green seats in coming elections”.

The Greens hopes of gaining seats such as Wills, Higgins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/14/polling-shows-kelly-odwyers-seat-within-greens-grasp-after-collapse-in-support>
 andBatman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/21/david-feeney-criticises-poll-showing-greens-could-win-his-melbourne-seat>
 in Melbourne, and Grayndler and Sydney, took a hit after theLiberals announced 
their preferences would flow to Labor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/15/wa-nationals-attack-liberal-party-over-dirty-preference-deal-with-labor>
 ahead of the Greens.

However, Di Natale said he was not making any concessions by admitting that 
picking up anything more than a couple of seats might be tough come 2 July.

“It’s just a reflection of reality,” he told reporters. “It will be tight. I 
think what you’ll see in a number of these seats it will go down to the wire.

“And if we have a bit of luck, we’ll pick up one or two of those seats. If we 
don’t, then beware the next election. Because the tide is turning. We are 
seeing the Greens vote continuing to grow in many of those lower house seats.”
 
Q: What about those unlegislated savings measures, that are stuck in the 
senate?

Scott Morrison:

These are our policies. And we are putting them to the Australian people. 
Labor have put their policies.

Q: They may never pass.

Scott Morrison:

The same can be said for Labor’s policies. But they are putting them to the 
Australian people, as we are.
 
Q: On the count of savings, Labor says their long-term budget is more accurate 
than yours, you have banked on zombie measures that have never passed the 
parliament. Can you guarantee they will pass the parliament?

Scott Morrison says the government’s plan is being put to voters this coming 
weekend.

That’s the plan we need to take the economy forward. But I make this other 
observation on the unlegislated measures. Labor keeps shifting their position. 
Things they said they were opposed to, like the school kids bonus, like the 
pension assets test, the freezing of local government indexation of payments 
and things of that nature – they flipped on.
 
Q: Do you think that Labor deserves some credit for releasing their costings 
today and allowing a bit of clear air between now and the election?

Scott Morrison:

I’m not going to give Labor the credit for increasing the deficit by $16.5bn. 
They tried to release it under the cover of the campaign launch. You don’t get 
credit for increasing the deficit.
 
Scott Morrison says a vote for Labor, or the Greens and independents, will be 
a vote for a higher deficit, of at least $16.5bn, and higher debt and taxes.

Labor’s approach will reduce the buffer that we are building at a time when we 
need to increase it. It will make us more vulnerable at a time of uncertainty 
and volatility, at a time we need to make [the budget] stronger.
 
The treasurer, Scott Morrison, is addressing reporters in Sydney now.

Scott Morrison:

Labor, under the cover of the government’s campaign launch, confirmed the 
threat they pose to our national economy, in these very uncertain and these 
very sensitive times.

Labor confirmed that they are a triple A threat to our triple A rating, 
because, today, Labor confirmed the following: they confirmed they’ll increase 
the deficit by $16.5bn.
 
Labor has produced this chart of the comparative budget positions over both 
the forward estimates and the medium term in an effort to keep voter’s eyes on 
the 10-year story, which is obviously a stronger budget repair story than the 
four-year story. Labor red line, Liberal blue line.

<https://twitter.com/murpharoo/status/746927764272406528> 
The difficulty Labor has, however, with the four-year story is highlighted by 
the convulsion around Brexit. Given the risks of a global economic shock, 
there’s not a lot of room to move in the budget in the event stimulus was 
required. Labor was able to offer substantial stimulus during the global 
financial crisis because there was room to move in the budget. Much harder to 
do that now and certainly harder to have that room to move if your fiscal 
consolidation over the four years is slower than the Coalition’s.
 
Again from Labor’s fiscal policy document, some pertinent notes. I mentioned 
earlier the Coalition’s super reforms and whatChris Bowen said about them in 
the Brisbane press conference (we’ll consult on retrospectivity but preserve 
the same revenue envelope) – dot point one is the specific language on super 
from the document. Additional particulars follow on the efficiency dividend and 
the fate of the energy supplement for Newstart recipients. If you came along to 
our fairness debate in Sydney or listened to the subsequent podcast we had a 
conversation about the energy supplement, which reduces the value of Newstart 
even further.

 * Given Labor’s concerns about the government’s superannuation changes, 
including retrospective elements, Labor would consult with stakeholders and 
take a broader examination of all these measures on coming to government.

 * Labor would also investigate how to replace the 2016-17 budget efficiency 
dividend measure and the 2015-16 MYEFO efficiency target for national cultural 
and collecting institutions in the 2017-18 budget with new measures aimed to 
achieve the same level of budget savings through genuine efficiencies that are 
not targeted at staffing, including targeting contractor and consultant costs, 
advertising and travel.

 * The opposition has not been given the opportunity to properly scrutinise 
the government’s removal of the clean energy supplement or seek advice from the 
department on its effects. In government, Labor will seek further advice on the 
impacts of this measure. Labor has already confirmed that we will conduct an 
independent review of the adequacy of the Newstart allowance – to ensure it can 
keep people out of poverty while also helping people into work.
 
Back to costings, I mentioned before Labor’s policies increase the deficit by 
$16.5bn over the forward estimates.

This is the rationale from Labor’s fiscal statement 
<https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/7461/attachments/original/1466908979/160626_Fiscal_Plan.pdf?1466908979>
 about why the budget position worsens before the structural savings begin to 
kick in.

Labor has prioritised the need to protect Medicare, deliver needs-based 
schools funding and boost jobs through nation-building infrastructure In the 
near term. As a result Labor will achieve more modest budget improvement than 
the government over the forward estimates. However, our savings are substantial 
and build steadily over time, permanently improving the budget over the medium 
term. The more modest fiscal consolidation over the forward estimates of around 
0.2% of GDP per year (on average) is more than made up for by Labor’s 
structural savings over the medium term. Labor is sensibly and responsibly 
building savings through a deliberate strategy to help support the Australian 
economy through a transition in an uncertain global economic environment, and 
to run larger surpluses over the medium term.

Labor also argues the government’s budget position “is inflated by more than 
$30bn of unlegislated saving measures (so called “zombie” measures), which will 
never pass the parliament.”

If these unlegislated measures are removed from the government’s budget, 
Malcolm Turnbull’s deficit increases by 50% in 2019-20, from $6bn to $9bn. If 
the government was honest and transparent, and abandoned the pretence that 
these measures will ever pass the parliament, the government would barely be in 
surplus over the medium term.

The former Liberal leader John Hewson addressed hundreds of people protesting 
in the normally subdued Sydney suburb of Double Bay – minutes from prime 
minister Turnbull’s harbourside mansion – calling on Turnbull to take stronger 
action on climate change. Speaking at the protest at the same time as Turnbull 
addressed the party faithful at the Coalition’s campaign launch, Hewson said 
the Coalition’s lack of action on climate change was a “national disgrace”.

“I think climate change should be the dominant issue of this campaign – it 
should have been for quite some time,” sad Hewson, who was a once the local 
member for the seat of Wentworth, which includes Double Bay. He said short-term 
politicking from both sides left targets that were inadequate and policies that 
weren’t going to meet those targets. “The one thing that hasn’t failed is 
people like yourselves. The community is way ahead of the political leaders and 
the business leaders on this issue,” he said, urging the crowd to push 
political leaders for a bipartisan approach to climate change. “Enough is 
enough, it’s time to act,” Hewson said.

A spokesperson from GetUp, which organised the protest in coalition with three 
other environment groups, estimated there were about 2000 people in the crowd.
 
Chris Bowen is asked about the AAA credit rating and whether Labor will 
support the government’s super measures. On super, Bowen says Labor has 
concerns about the retrospective nature of the changes but it will commit to 
raising the same amount of revenue as the government from tightening super 
concessions. On the credit rating Bowen says look at the structural 
improvements to the budget over the 10 years, because the ratings agencies 
will. He says Labor will return to budget balance in the same year as the 
Coalition.
 
Q: I think there’s barely been a forward estimate in a budget that’s actually 
turned out to be achieved. They’ve all been missed and most spectacularly. 
Beyond your comments about the Liberals, why shouldn’t Australians look at 
those forward estimates and go, yeah, right?


Chris Bowen:

I think the Australian people want a political party, an alternative 
government with a plan not just for the next 10 days but for the next 10 years. 
That provides certainty going forward.
 
Always a bit tricky, trying to read and report simultaneously. We’ll get there.

Chris Bowen is asked at the press conference in Brisbane whether Labor is 
trying to bury its costings by unveiling them on the day of the Liberal launch.

Chris Bowen:

This is a funny way of hiding something, in a press conference with 40 
journalists? And seven TV cameras? And multiple still cameras – I don’t think 
this can be an accusation fairly levelled.

ALP plan has smaller surpluses than govt 20-21 to 22-23. But then much bigger 
beyond that - about $13.7b by 26-27.
