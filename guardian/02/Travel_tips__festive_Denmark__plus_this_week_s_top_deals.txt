Take me there: Aarhus, Denmark

Why go? 
If there’s one thing the Scandinavians do even better than edgy crime fiction, 
it’s Christmas: cosy bars serving gløgg (mulled wine), ice-skating rinks, 
twinkling Christmas markets and, if you’re lucky, a sprinkling of snow. Aarhus 
is used to playing second fiddle to Copenhagen, but when it comes to the arts, 
culture, nightlife and shopping this is a town that punches well above its 
weight. And with daily Ryanair flights from £19 each way and some decent budget 
hotels, it’s surprisingly affordable.

What to do
Get a colourful perspective on the city from the Rainbow Panorama, a 
spectacular circular walkway on the roof of ARoS art museum (en.aros.dk 
<http://en.aros.dk/>). Shop for Christmas gifts in the bustling Latin Quarter 
or the Sidegaderne (the side streets), the city’s newest shopping district. 
Stock up on handmade decorations and aebleskiver (Danish doughnuts) at 
Christmas stalls in front of the cathedral. The festivities continue at Visit 
Den Gamle By, an open-air museum where actors recreate scenes from Christmas 
past (dengamleby.dk <http://www.dengamleby.dk/>).

Where to eat
The rooftop coffee shop at the Lynfabrikken, a former lighting factory, is the 
hippest hangout in town (lynfabrikken.dk <http://lynfabrikken.dk/>). “Lobster 
Tuesdays” at Mefisto, a cosy candlelit restaurant in the Latin Quarter, are a 
local institution (mefisto.dk <http://www.mefisto.dk/>).

Where to stay
Cabinn Aarhus has small but functional rooms, reminiscent of ships’ cabins, in 
a lively canalside location (from £53,cabinn.dk <https://www.cabinn.com/>). For 
a little more charm, upgrade to Aarhus Guldsmeden, an eco-friendly guesthouse 
in the Latin Quarter with bikes for hire (from £110,hotelguldsmeden.com 
<http://guldsmedenhotels.com/Home/GuldsmedenHotels.aspx>).

Insider tip
“Check out Godsbanen, a cultural centre which puts on art, fashion or film 
events,” says Marie Nipper, chief curator at ARoS. “Apothek in Jægergaardsgade 
is a cocktail bar with a great atmosphere. It is an old pharmacy and has a 
speakeasy feel.”
