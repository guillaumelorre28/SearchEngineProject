Twenty-four angulas make one hasta, which is one of the universal measurement 
units of mankind – the length of a forearm measured out to the extended middle 
finger. The hasta is a unit of measurement devised by the Harappan (the most 
ancient of India's urban civilisations along the Indus) and akin to the cubit 
used in Sumeria (the most ancient urban culture of Iraq) and ancient Egypt.

It seems that the basic Harappan unit was formed from the width of eight 
barley grains placed side by side, which was found to be equal to a finger's 
width (roughly 1.76cm). Twelve of these finger widths/barley rows made an 
angula, while a dhanus (the length of a bow) was assessed as 108 of these 
finger width/barley rows. Anything with "108" in it was deemed to be very 
propitious inIndia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/india> and the east, and 
so it was a favourite unit in which to design a citadel or a wall.

The use of barley as the ultimate foundation stone of measurement appears to 
be another universal element (alongside the forearm, the foot and the breadth 
of a finger), so that, for instance, you will find it underwriting the system 
of measurements used by the Vikings. But there has always been room for 
financial manipulation and speculation, especially from the great rival of 
barley, the slightly lighter wheat seed. Four wheat seeds equal three of 
barley, which are themselves considered to be on par with the seed from a carob 
tree.
