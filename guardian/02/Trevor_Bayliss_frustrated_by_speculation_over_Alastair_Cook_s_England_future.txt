Trevor Bayliss <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/trevor-bayliss> has 
described relentless speculation about Alastair Cook’s future as England 
captain as a “pain in the backside”.

Cook partially left himself a hostage to fortune when he spoke before the 
start of England’s Test series in India of a final stage in his international 
career in which he could envisage playing purely as a batsman again without the 
strains of leadership.

He quickly clarified his remarks, before the drawn first Test in Rajkot

, explaining he will – as is done after every series – discuss all matters 
arising in a debrief with the England’s director of cricket Andrew Strauss.

The continued longevity of Cook’s tenure is the topic which will not go away, 
however, and both he and England coach Bayliss again found themselves answering 
a barrage of questions on the subject after the tourists’innings defeat in 
Mumbai on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/12/ashwin-takes-six-wickets-as-india-clinch-series-against-england>
 confirmed a series already lost 3-0 with one to play.

England lost their last six wickets for 15 runs, chiefly to Ravi Ashwin who 
finished with 12 wickets in the match, and must travel on to Chennai for the 
fifth and final Test with a consolation victory the limit of their ambitions.

Bayliss voiced his backing for Cook, as he and several senior players have 
done at various stages of the tour, and was asked if it is easy to stop the 
conjecture affecting England’s dressing-room.

“Well, that’s what you try to do,” he said. “But when it’s constantly in the 
media all the time, it’s a bit of a pain in the backside – especially when no 
one else [around the team] believes that or thinks that.”

Cook had earlier acknowledged at his post-match press conference that, during 
such a tough tour, he does occasionally even question himself – and made it 
clear that, should there be a change of leadership, he believes his deputy Joe 
Rootwill be ready to step up

Bayliss spoke patiently, but admitted the open discussion of Cook’s position 
is frustrating for him at times. “It’s a little bit aggravating,” he said. “It 
takes the focus away from all the good things we’ve done on this tour. I think 
we’ve played some good cricket here. We’ve got to give credit where credit’s 
due – we’ve played good cricket, and [India] have played even better cricket.”

Cook, who will be 32 on Christmas Day, has led his country a record 58 times 
in Tests having succeeded Strauss when his former opening partner retired four 
years ago.

Bayliss added: “I suppose anyone who’s done the job for that long, there’s 
always going to be questions towards the twilight of his career. But the job 
he’s done with the group, I think, has been fantastic. I think everyone, to a 
man, in the room would be disappointed if he wasn’t captain [for next year].”

After next week’s series finale, England have a six-and-a-half-month break 
from Test cricket – more than enough time for Cook to decide whether he wants 
to continue up to and including next winter’s Ashes.
