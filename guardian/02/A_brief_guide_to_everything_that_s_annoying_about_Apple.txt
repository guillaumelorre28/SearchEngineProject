Is this the beginning of the end for Apple? The tech giant’s inexorable growth 
has been a given for most of the 21st century but, on Wednesday, Apple reported 
its first decline in quarterly sales for 13 years: a 13% fall, down to $50bn 
(£34bn). That’s still enough to reduce the UK’s budget deficit by half, but, in 
Apple’s reckoning, it’s a catastrophe.Apple’s share price fell by 8% yesterday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/26/apple-iphone-first-revenue-decline-13-years>
, wiping more than $40bn off its value in a few hours. Is the worldfalling out 
of love with the Croesus of Cupertino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/03/apple-top-tree-winds-change-blow-down-40th-birthday>
? Even Siri was sounding like an exhausted spin doctor when we asked it for 
answers.

Siri, is this the beginning of the end for Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple>?

“Interesting question.”

Siri, what’s wrong with Apple?

“I can’t say.”

Do you actually like Apple?

“Well, perhaps I’m biased, but I prefer all things Apple.”

Why?

“I don’t know. Frankly, I’ve wondered that myself.”

What are the most common complaints about Apple?

“Let me check on that ...”

Actually, save your circuits, Siri. We can tell you exactly why the world is 
falling out of love with Apple. We’ve been storing up these complaints for 
years. So, why don’t you just shut your British/American/Australian, 
male/female speech unit and listen?

1 The passwords

Signing into the iTunes store: Apple ID? Password? User password? Password for 
this Mac? System admin password? Password for password manager? Forgot? Given 
up? Gone to get a sledgehammer?

2 The product launches

Ramping up every product launch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/19/ios-macos-apple-wwdc-13-june-macbook>
 into a TED talk by Cirque du Soleil based on the Sermon on the Mount, even if 
it’s just plugging a marginally different phone.

The new iPhone: “It’s bigger!”

The new iPhone: “It’s smaller!”

The new iPhone: “It’s just the right size!”

The new iPhone: “It’s the size of an ironing board, but so what? Buy it! It’s 
new!”

3 The endless hardware upgrades

Thanks to those product launches, we now have cupboards full of obsolete 
iPhones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/15/apple-iphone-last-three-years-mac-computer-four>
, iPods, iPads, MacBooks, chargers and cables, plus 30 pairs of white 
headphones because we always feel like we’re missing out on something HUGE.

4 The Green Eggs and Ham approach to software updates

Install now? Turn on automatic software updates? Remind me later? Try in an 
hour? Try tonight? Would you update them in a box? Would you update them with a 
fox? You do not like software updates, so you say? Try them, try them and you 
may!

5 The U2 album

The only music Apple ever gave away for free was the album absolutely nobody 
wanted or asked for.

6 The price

The cheapest iPhone <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> is still 
way beyond the reach of people in poorer parts of the world – places whose 
phone networks are likely to be expensive or unreliable, if they exist at all. 
Even in the UK, you can buy a basic mobile phone for as little as £10; the 
cheapest iPhone is currently £359. Way to bring the world together.

7 They’re too cool for tills

Instead of a tried-and-trusted checkout where we can quietly queue with some 
decorum, Apple stores force us to seek out that smug, snotty-nosed blueshirt 
who’s lingering somewhere on the shopfloor with an iPad.

8 The ubiquitous ringtone

The chime of “Old Phone” now triggers a Pavlovian response, causing everyone 
within earshot to imagine it’s a call for them. Even when you could have sworn 
you switched your phone to silent.

9 iPhone repairs

No matter what’s wrong with your iPhone, or how tiny, it costs at least £200 
to fix. Dodgy home button? £200. Won’t restart? £200. Cracked screen? A bargain 
at £100.

10 The rip-off accessories

Need a new power adapter because that magnetic bit on the end broke when it 
got bent back too much? How much, Apple Store? £65! Plain black phone bumper 
that you could get down the market for a fiver? £25!

11 The constant iTunes revamping

Every upgrade of iTunes becomes a game of hide and seek. How do you make a 
playlist now? Where’s “recently added”? No, I don’t want to start a sodding 
three-month free trial of Apple Music.

12 The utopian demos

Our photos and videos never feature people with happy dogs surfing around the 
world and going hiking with kites on beautiful mountains, like they do in all 
your “take the tour” demos. Couldn’t you give us a slideshow of babies crying, 
and piles of washing up?

13 The Apple Watch

It sucks and Apple won’t admit it. It won’t even release sales figures for it, 
lumping it in with Apple TV,iPod <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipod> 
and accessory sales – which were one-tenth of those of iPhones.

14 Apple TV

“The future of television?” Also known as “Another expensive box that does 
nothing all your other expensive boxes can’t do already, but has an Apple logo 
on it.”

15 Mac lag

Our old MacBook takes longer to wake up every morning than we do.

16 It is more controlling than Prince was

We know we’ve paid for the entire Prince back catalogue at some stage, but 
iTunes won’t let us listen to it without negotiating an assault course of 
synching protocols, passwords, user settings, menus, helpdesk chatbots and, 
finally, Googled explainers.

17 Wet fingers

Having to wait for 20 minutes after coming out of the shower before our iPhone 
fingerprint scanner recognises us. Like the clean you isn’t the real you.

18 They have turned into The Man


Apple has marketed itself as the alternative choice ever since Ridley Scott’s 
1984-themed Super Bowl ad <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I> 30 
years ago, but, in the meantime, it has basically become Big Brother



19 Their hatred of ports

Apple’s eradication of USB ports from iPads just rendered all your accessories 
obsolete (lightning-to-USB adapter: another £15 down the drain). Just like 
their sealing up of the DVD/CD slot rendered your collections of both obsolete 
(so you have to buy them again from iTunes). It is now easier to hack the US 
defence system than get a DVD on to an iPad.

20 The ‘Smart Battery Case’

Which converts your elegant, slender, hopelessly underpowered iPhone 6 into an 
ugly, clunky monstrosity of a phone. Because that’s what “Smart” looks like.

21 Their format dictatorship

You take a picture with your iPhone. You import it to iPhotos. Now you try to 
attach it to an email. Ha! You can’t! Instead, you have to find the photo, save 
a copy on to your desktop, then attach THAT version. The only way to do it 
easily is through Apple’s own Mail application, otherwise known as BlackMail.

22 Their wealth

Apple has cash reserves greater than the GDP of most countries, accrued in 
part by depriving those countries of taxes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/22/apple-should-pay-more-tax-says-steve-wozniak>
, and exploiting their mineral resources.

23 Their contempt for humanity

Bill Gates uses his fortune to cure malaria, Apple uses its fortune to ... 
make bigger fortunes.

24 Error 53

How many corporations possess and wield the power to criminally damage their 
products –your products – after they’ve sold them to you? Apple’s notorious 
“Error 53” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/06/apple-says-iphone-error-53-is-to-protect-customers-security>
 punished users for the offence of going to “unauthorised” repairers by 
effectively shutting down their iPhone 6 handsets – a practice known as 
“bricking”. When a class-action lawsuit threatened, Apple got scared and backed 
down – a practice known as “bricking it”.

25 They’ve taken over the music industry

iTunes paved the way for the low-priced digital music revolution, where 
artists get a minuscule share of the profits and Apple gets a much larger cut. 
It wiped out high-street record shops, crippled the music industry, then 
extracted a ransom from artists to put their music in its virtual shop window. 
Then it stoleTaylor Swift and locked her up in Apple Music 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/07/watch-taylor-apple-music-ad-jason-statham>
, just to rub it in.

26 Their business model is The Circle

Dave Eggers’ dystopian novel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/09/circle-dave-eggers-review> 
details a utopian-sounding tech corporation whose ambitions extend to every 
aspect of people’s lives, anticipating, fulfilling and creating their every 
desire, to the extent that people never need to step outside the closed loop of 
control. Then find they can’t even if they want to. Apple has done its best to 
dispel such comparisons by building a massive new headquarters – in the shape 
of a circle.
