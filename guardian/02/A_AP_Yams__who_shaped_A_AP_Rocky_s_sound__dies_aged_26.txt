“All of us at RCA Records are shocked and saddened to hear of the death of 
A$AP Yams,” the record company said. “As one of the creative forces behind A$AP 
Worldwide, Yams’ vision, humor and dedication to the members of A$AP Mob will 
always be remembered. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and 
friends.”

Yams, real name Steven Rodriguez, was 26, was behind-the-scenes figure in A$AP 
Mob, helping plot to A$AP Rocky’s rise to stardom.As a 2013 New York Times 
profile put it 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/arts/music/asap-yams-partner-to-hip-hops-asap-rocky.html?pagewanted=all&_r=2&>
: “Much of what you hear in Rocky — a fully assimilated take on hip-hop styles 
from across the country and from across time periods — can be traced back to 
Yams, who spent his formative years studying the genre, then learning how to 
transmit his taste to others. Hip-hop has long been obsessed with fealty to a 
specific place and time, and Yams’s vision of the genre as an open house, not a 
fortress, qualifies as a radical one.”

Many stars paid tribute on Twitter.
