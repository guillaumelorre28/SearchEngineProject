The class-action complaint, filed in US district court in Riverside, California
 <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california>, east of Los Angeles, also 
alleges the automaker tried to cover up hundreds of related accidents that 
caused injuries and property damage and has dragged its feet in furnishing a 
remedy for the issue.

 The plaintiffs are seeking restitution for the diminished resale value of 
their Grand Cherokees stemming from the “raft of negative publicity” 
surrounding the recent disclosure of the rollaway problem.

A recalled 2015 Grand Cherokee was involved in Sunday’s death of Yelchin, 27, 
who was crushed when his vehicle rolled backward on the steep driveway of his 
Los Angeles home, pinning him against a brick wall and a fence.

Los Angeles police have said their detectives were examining whether the 
recall issue played a role. If so, the actor would be the first fatality 
reported linked to the recall.

Company spokesman Michael Palese said the automaker has not yet been served 
with the lawsuit and it would be inappropriate to comment before reviewing the 
case.


Fiat Chrysler <https://www.theguardian.com/business/fiat-chrysler> Automobiles 
NV issued a recall in April for 1.1m cars and SUVs worldwide, most of them in 
the United States, because the vehicles could roll away after drivers exit them.

The recall applies to 811,000 vehicles in the United States, covering 2014 to 
2015 model years of theJeep <https://www.theguardian.com/business/jeep> Grand 
Cherokee sport utility vehicle, and 2012 to 2014 Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 
sedans.

 The lawsuit came as the company announced that software upgrades for all 1.1 
million recalled vehicles would be available by the end of this month.

 While not acknowledging a design flaw in its transmission gear selectors, the 
company has said rollaways have occurred because drivers mistakenly believe 
they had placed the vehicles in park before getting out.

 Chrysler Fiat said the issue was linked to 700 incidents overall, including 
41 injuries, 212 crashes, and 308 reports of property damage.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has said the 
gear selector in question clearly poses a safety issue that has led to hundreds 
of crashes and dozens of injuries. The agency said testing of the electronic 
shifter found it “not intuitive and provides poor tactile and visual feedback 
to the driver, increasing the potential for unintended gear selection”.
