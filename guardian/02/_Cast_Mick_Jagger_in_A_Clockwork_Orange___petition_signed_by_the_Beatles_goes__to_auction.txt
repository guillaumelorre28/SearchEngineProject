What are we bid for a petition? Nothing? What if we tell you the petition 
dates from 1968 and calls for Mick Jagger to be cast in the role of Alex in the 
film adaptation of Anthony Burgess’sA Clockwork Orange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-clockwork-orange>? And what if we further 
add that it is signed by all four Beatles?

The petition, on sale through online auction site Paddle8, dates from February 
1968 and was directed at novelist Terry Southern, who was working on the 
screenplay for the film. David Hemmings was expected to take the lead role.

“We, the undersigned, do hereby protest with extreme vehemence as well as 
shattered illusions (in you) the preference of David Hemmings aboveMick Jagger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/mick-jagger> in the role of Alex in The 
Clockwork Orange,” the petition read.

Anita Pallenberg (as Anita the Heater), Donald Cammell (as Don the Drom), 
Peter Blake, Marianne Faithfull, James Fox and others also signed the petition.

The petition has a reserve price of $14,000 (£9,000), but is expected to sell 
for between $18,000 and $25,000.

At one point, Jagger owned the film rights to A Clockwork Orange, having 
bought them for $500 from a hard-up Burgess, before selling them to film 
producer Si Litvinoff. Litvinoff approached John Schlesinger to direct the film,
starring Jagger <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/06/therollingstones>
, with the Beatles to provide the music.


A Clockwork Orange was eventually filmed in 1971 by Stanley Kubrick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/stanleykubrick>, who also wrote the 
screenplay. Malcolm McDowell took the role of Alex.
