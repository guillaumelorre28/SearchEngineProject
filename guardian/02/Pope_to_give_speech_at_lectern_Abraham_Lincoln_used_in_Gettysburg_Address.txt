Later this month, conservators will remove the lectern from its display space 
at the Union League of Philadelphia to prepare it for the pontiff’s speech. Its 
loan for the pope’s use on 26 September was announced on Friday by the 
Vatican-sponsored World Meeting of Families, which the pope will be attending.

Lincoln used the lectern on 19 November 1863, to dedicate part of the civil 
war battlefield at Gettysburg as a cemetery. His two-minute address became one 
of the most famous speeches in American history. It ended with Lincoln’s 
resolution that “this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and 
that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish 
from the earth”.

The pope is expected to talk about immigration and religious freedom during 
his remarks outside Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence 
was adopted on 4 July 1776.

The lectern’s “simple beauty and humble role in one of American history’s most 
important moments reflects, in many ways, Pope Francis’s own world view”, said 
Robert Ciaruffoli, president of the World Meeting of Families.

The pope’s appearance outside Independence Hall is expected to be a ticketed 
event. Exact arrangements have not been announced.

His two big public events in Philadelphia will be an appearance at the closing 
of the World Meeting of Families on 26 September and his celebration of mass on 
27 September, both on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.

The pontiff’s first stops on his US visit will be in Washington and New York.
