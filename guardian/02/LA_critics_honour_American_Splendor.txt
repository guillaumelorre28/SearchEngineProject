American Splendor <https://www.theguardian.com/film/american-splendor>, the 
film adaptation of hospital file clerk Harvey Pekar's cult comic book, has won 
the best picture award from the LA Film Critics Association.

Coming just three days after the phlegmatic tale of working class life won the 
equivalent gong from the National Society of Film Critics, the latest award 
establishes Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini's movie as a serious 
contender for glory at next month's Academy Awards. The film also won the best 
screenplay award from both organisations, many of whose members also belong to 
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, the final film in Peter 
Jackson's fantasy trilogy, is the other movie currently building Oscar heat. 
LA's critics handed Jackson the best director gong, and he was also nominated 
for outstanding directorial achievement in feature film by the Directors Guild 
of America yesterday.

The other DGA nominees are Sofia Coppola for Lost In Translation, Clint 
Eastwood for Mystic River, Gary Ross for Seabiscuit and Peter Weir for Master 
and Commander: The Far Side of the World. All but six DGA award winners have 
gone on to win the coveted Oscar in the last 55 years.

The LA critics voted Bill Murray best actor for his performance in Lost in 
Translation, while Naomi Watts took best actress for 21 Grams.

Â· The Producers Guild of America has selected In America to receive the 
Stanley Kramer Award, which recognises a company, individual or production that 
addresses provocative social issues in an uplifting fashion.
