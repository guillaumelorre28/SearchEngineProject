This week Sydney artist Penny Ryan received 32 handwritten and hand-drawn 
messages in the mail. Scrawled on scraps of paper and cloth, they came from 
detainees being held onManus Island 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/manus-island> and Nauru.

“We are suffering every minute of the day,” read one.

“We just asking for save. We had enough torturing,” read another.

“Manus and Nauru <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nauru> is killing us one 
by one, physically and mentally.”

“Why am I in prison.”

When asked how she felt reading each one for the first time, Ryan grimaces. 
“They brought tears, obviously,” she says. “There’s something really powerful 
about getting these. Suddenly you’re talking about real people, individuals we 
don’t get to see.”

Confined Hearts project. Photograph: David T Young 
In the past six months Ryan has held more than 45 workshops in Sydney and 
Canberra, teaching more than 400 people – ranging in age from five to 94 – to 
sculpt human hearts out of clay. There are now 1,468 hearts in total: one for 
each man, woman and child the government said were being held on Manus Island 
and Nauru at the time her project began.


As she accrued more and more hearts – painstakingly crafted at workshops, 
where 15 to 20 people at a time talked about the issue and their connection to 
it – she began displaying them at a series of interactive installations, titled 
The Confined Hearts Project.

Open Hearts <http://penny-ryan.squarespace.com/open-hearts> – which invited 
participants to unwrap 400 hearts – premiered in June for the Chippendale New 
World Art prize; andHeart Awakening 
<http://penny-ryan.squarespace.com/heart-awakening>, in September, invited 
people to wash 300 of the hearts in a ritual cleansing at the National Art 
School.

On Saturday 10 December, Human Rights Day, the project continues with its 
third event. For Opening Hearts, all 1,468 muslin-wrapped hearts – most 
inscribed with messages from their maker – will be installed in a spiral 
formation next to the Museum of ContemporaryArt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art> in Sydney, at Circular Quay.

The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of

The public will be invited to walk into the spiral’s centre, unwrap the muslin 
covering a heart, place it back down, and walk out again holding onto the 
fabric – onto which they may write a message.

“I’d been looking a lot at what ritual can do to help people step out of their 
ordinary lives for even a moment, to reflect on something,” she says. “Giving 
them an act to do allows that sort of ritual.”

When Ryan met two people who would be visiting Manus Island and Nauru, she 
asked if they could explain Detained Hearts to the detainees, with the hopes 
some would write messages to Australia to be included in the project. While the 
artist is keeping the originals safe for a future work, photographic 
reproductions will be on display at Circular Quay.

 Ryan has long been interested in socially engaged art which involves and in 
some cases galvanises participants; work byJeremy Deller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/01/wearehere-battle-somme-tribute-acted-out-across-britain>
 andMierle Laderman Ukeles 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/arts/design/mierle-laderman-ukeles-new-york-city-sanitation-department.html?_r=0>
, for example.

The public event is about taking people out of their everyday life, and 
connecting them to the real people affected by the Australian government’s 
policy. “Walking in, stooping down, picking up a heart – it’s a process ... 
Most people report being slightly shocked by the fact that each heart is so 
heavy. The ceramic is fragile. It’s about taking it out from the [political] 
debate, and back into a sense of human-ness. And taking time to get out of your 
ordinary life and letting yourself feel something,” she says.

“My own frustrations with some contemporary art have been about the lack of 
engagement around emotion, feeling, ritual. [I’m interested in] trying to 
create situations where you take time out from what is really an overwhelming 
issue.”

For Ryan, and for many of those who took part in her workshop, the plight of 
refugees in Australia and beyond is so immense it can be paralysing. “As soon 
as you start thinking about 64 million people on the move because of conflict 
and war, and we’re here in the land of plenty – how do I make a difference?”

Her workshops opened with an hour of discussion around the issue, before she 
talked participants through six easy steps to make a 3D anatomical heart (“notso
easy, to be honest!”). In each workshop, she says, the same conversations kept 
coming up.

 “There’s a sense of basic powerlessness and shame about Australia’s reaction, 
a sense of privilege ... ‘I got here’ or ‘my parents got here’ or ‘my 
grandparents got here, often as refugees or post war, and we didn’t have any of 
this. We got absorbed into the country’.”

Using their hands to make a clay heart, and to inscribe it with a message, 
gave the participants a way to channel those feelings, a kind of catharsis, she 
says. For many, it gave them an entry point to action too.


“The vast majority of people – I’d say 80% who came – had never taken any 
political action,” Ryan says. “They felt bad about [the issue], but they’d 
remained largely silent; might make a casual comment, but that was as far as 
they went.”

These workshops, she says, was not only the first time many had gathered in a 
group of people who felt the same way, but the first time many had taken a form 
of action – symbolic as it may be.

“Roughly 30-40 people came back for multiple workshops ... they could just 
come and know that they were coming to a place where there was an acceptance 
[of the same idea]”

From the event itself on Saturday, she’s hoping the public approaches it with 
openness. “I want people to actually let themselves be moved by it. Let 
themselves actually feel something, for a moment. That’s my biggest hope,” she 
says. “They might not necessarily take any direct action, but at least they 
won’t be part of a passive violence group that’s letting all of this happen 
without taking some form of action.”
