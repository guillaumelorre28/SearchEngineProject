It had seemed an appropriate memorial. In August Russia's president, Dmitry 
Medvedev, named a street in Moscow after Alexander Solzhenitsyn, shortly after 
the writer's death at the age of 89.

But the residents of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/solzhenitsyn> Street have other ideas. 
Locals have waged a furious campaign against the name change, demanding the 
street revert to its old name of Big Communist Street.

Communist activists have complained that Medvedev's decision to rename the 
street after Solzhenitsyn, Russia's greatest literary chronicler of communist 
repression, is illegal. Under Russian law the authorities should wait 10 years 
before they name a street after a dead person.

Last Sunday residents tore down the street sign but officials put it up again. 
Another plaque hangs at the end of the street next to a branch of McDonald's.

Changing the name of the street was "not only a gross breach of existing 
legislation but also a challenge to all people with communists views because 
Solzhenitsyn always fought with the communists", Sergei Udaltsov, the leader of 
the communist Left Front youth organisation, told the Moscow Times.

Most residents were against the change, he said, because they had been forced 
to alter their documents, including passports.

"My wife and I haven't received our pension," said Vladimir Gusarov, who lives 
at number 24.

Around 1,000 people have signed a petition against the change of name, while 
the Left Front has initiated legal action in Moscow's city court to have it 
overturned.

Officials pointed to precedents. The city of Yekaterinburg in the Urals, where 
Boris Yeltsin grew up, boasts a President Boris Yeltsin Street, following the 
former leader's death last year.
