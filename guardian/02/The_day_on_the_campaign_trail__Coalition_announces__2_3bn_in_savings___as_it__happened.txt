Nighty night

Bill Shorten is rolling on to a town hall meeting in Nowra tonight but I think 
we are safe to fold the Politics Live tent for today. Let’s assess the sum of 
the parts.

 * Bill Shorten made his final pitch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/28/bill-shorten-coalitions-trickle-down-economics-risks-brexit-style-alienation>
 with a speech at the National Press Club. The Labor leader made his most 
coherent campaign pitch on why Labor was taking a different policy approach 
this election cycle. He said the focus couldn’t be exclusively on growth 
without considering equality and societal cohesion. “The Liberals are asking 
Australians to reject the cooperative economic model and the social wage that 
has held our nation together for more than 30 years and delivered a 
quarter-century of growth, and embark instead upon a radical, expensive 
experiment in trickle-down economics. The gathering push of extreme right-wing 
populism round the globe are a warning to all of us, not to leave people behind 
... we must give every citizen a sense of being an active participant in 
transition, in control of what’s happening to them, not a passive observer of 
change, left behind on the scrap heap.”

 * Malcolm Turnbull pushed on with campaigning in Brisbane, pressing his theme 
of stability. Back in Canberra, the government’s economic team unveiled their 
final costings. The Coalition says it will launch another crackdown on benefit 
recipients, including welfare folks and pensioners, by increasing data matching 
and debt recovery, improving the budget bottom line by $2bn. When the 
Coalition’s $1bn election spend was netted out, the impact was a $1bn 
improvement to the budget bottom line. So the welfare crackdown funds the 
election spend. Welfare and seniors groups were unimpressed.

Of course the costings milestone means we are fully out of the policy phase of 
the campaign: it’s pure politics now until Saturday. Strong drink may be 
required. Thanks very much for your company through the day. We’ll be back from 
sunrise tomorrow for Wednesday. Until then, take care.

Acoss chief Cassandra Goldie is on Sky News now about the welfare crackdown. 
She says debt collections from benefit recipients have to be handled very 
carefully. Goldie says people on benefits try and pick up bits and pieces of 
work to supplement their incomes, and it isn’t always easy to forecast in 
advance what income you might earn.

It has to be very carefully done.

The social services minister, Christian Porter, is on Sky News now, explaining 
the savings measure. He makes it clear that when it comes to debt repayments, 
if people are paying income tax, the tax office could move in for debt recovery.

He’s asked whether this is a valid costing, given we have heard about these 
compliance measures before today’s frolic. Porter says the methodology behind 
today’s announcement has already resulted in the government beating their 
recovery target by 20%. He says the savings achieved to date are in the 
hundreds of millions.

The Australian Council of Social Service chief, Cassandra Goldie, is clearly 
unimpressed and has issued a short statement.

Australia’s lowest-income earners and most vulnerable households have borne 
the brunt of Coalition savings measures in three successive budgets and enough 
is enough. Acoss strongly opposes taking any more money out of income support 
payments. This is the last place theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> should be looking for 
savings to fund new election spending promises. People are struggling to 
survive on $38 dollars a day Newstart payments which have not been increased in 
two decades.

Some quick reaction from National Seniors about the data matching. Sarah 
Saunders says the group has not yet been given details of the new savings 
measure, but people would resent being treated “as ripping off the system if 
that is the mentality”. She says people who are claiming benefits invalidly 
should not be getting benefits.

Scott Morrison said this afternoon the measures would enhance the “integrity 
and compliance of social welfare payments” through improved income data 
matching, better engagement with welfare recipients, more accurate income 
disclosure of assets and better identification and recovery of debts.

Saunders says seniors will welcome better engagement because they struggle to 
get through to Centrelink and “when they do, they often get the wrong 
information”. National Seniors has already warned thatage pensioners are angry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/02/pension-changes-coalition-warned-of-red-hot-anger-election?CMP=soc_567>
 at the tightening of the assets test which is estimated to push 100,000 people 
off the pension. From January, singles with savings and assets of more than 
$547,000 (excluding the family home) will lose the age pension while couples 
with savings and assets of $823,000 will lose the pension. On the strength of 
those changes, National Seniors has been running forums in four marginal seats: 
Brisbane, Chisolm, Hindmarsh and Hasluck. “It is surprising how passionate 
people have been in the forums, there are people yelling from the back of the 
room over changes. Single women particularly say they will decimated by the 
changes.”

Sticking with cynicism if you can bear it: Labor has already cut that quote 
fromMalcolm Turnbull into a campaign advertisement.

If you weren’t with me earlier today, let me walk you through this.

 * This morning, the prime minister, as a prelude to a specific criticism he 
intended to make about a Labor backflip, said sometimes political parties say 
one thing and do another.Malcolm Turnbull went on to say look at what Labor did 
on the school kids bonus: attacked the Coalition for getting rid of it, then 
supported the Coalition’s position.

 * Bill Shorten used his final pitch at the National Press Club at lunchtime 
to take the Turnbull quote out of context, obviously as a prelude to the new 
campaign advertisement. The declaration from Turnbull, Shorten said, was a
defining moment in the 2016 election campaign. The suggestion here was the 
Coalition will say one thing and do another, and here was Turnbull admitting 
this in a moment of candour.

Here’s the advertisement, or one of them anyway, I’ve seen another version as 
well.
 Saying one thing and doing another. 
My analysis of this remains the same: Labor is trying to make an integrity 
point by excising one quote from Turnbull that meant something entirely 
different in its proper context. It might turn a few voter’s heads. But it’s a 
slick willy practice inherently without integrity, isn’t it?

How's this for a final pitch?

Back to the Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> 
and costings, just so we are clear: the final pitch from the government is 
welfare recipients (and pensioners, even though we don’t mention that 
explicitly in our documents) will pay (if they don’t come up well after a data 
matching exercise) for the election goodies we’ve rolled out over the past 
seven and a half weeks.

I could say grannies for dunny blocks but that might be rude.

Several more questions about super, including whether Labor has now joined the 
government in pushing out an increase to the super guarantee until 2018.

Chris Bowen:

Yes, that’s right, the timetable, yes.

A question about superannuation. Doesn’t Labor have an obligation to be 
straight about what it intends to do?

Chris Bowen:

What we’ve done is similar to what the government has done on the backpacker 
tax. What we’ve said is we’ve never had a quarrel with how much money the 
government raises through these measures but we have a quarrel with two aspects 
in particular - the retrospective nature of the measure you refer to and 
whether it could actually be implemented. Whether it could actually be done.

It’s possible that neither side of politics will implement this measure if 
it’s not implementable. Now, very frankly, we do not have the resources of 
government to make the determination as to whether it is implementable. So we 
remain and will remain deeply concerned and opposed to aspects of 
retrospectivity.

Questions now. The first one is about the zombie savings measures – Labor did 
the same thing with private health insurance in the past, carrying a saving 
that was unlikely to pass until it finally did pass. So why criticise the 
government for their zombie measures?

Chris Bowen says he knows the Senate is not going to pass measurers making 
unemployed people wait or changes that affect pensioners,they are not going to 
cop them and there has to come a time when reality is reflected in the budget 
documents, there just has to.

Tony Burke:

This is a double-dissolution election. It was open to the government to make 
any one of those zombie measures a trigger, in which case they would be 
eligible for the joint sitting if they win the election. They didn’t do it with 
a single one of them. These zombie measures are entirely an accounting trick 
that the government is engaging in to prop up their budget bottom line.

6.27am BST 06:27  <> 

The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, and the shadow finance minister, Tony Burke
, are now holding a press conference in response to the Coalition’s costings 
and new savings measures.

Chris Bowen:

I note that the treasurer struggled to detail and explain those savings 
measures. We would like to know, of course, how different these are to the 
savings measures which were announced in the budget and then Myefo, which 
looked very, very similar.

When were these savings costed? They don’t appear on the election costings’ 
website, which means they were probably costed by treasury before PEFO so we 
question whether they are the most up-to-date costings available.

Of course we will look at them in detail. I noticed the treasurer referred 
them to the social security minister, he couldn’t answer the questions about 
them. So of course we look forward to those answers and we will consider them 
in due course.

Obviously, we would need to know exactly how many people would be affected and 
how it is different to the $5.7bn in savings announced since the 2015/16 budget 
from better compliance. This government has a habit of announcing compliance 
measures with very significant amounts of money attached to them but, of 
course, we would like to see a report on just how successful those measures 
have been in considering the government’s [new] measures.

(Bowen is exactly right about this. I expressed scepticism a couple of posts 
ago about the capacity of the government to extract $2bn from data matching 
with that context in mind. We’ve seen compliance measures in the budget before.)

PS: Pensioners too

Oh, and the government must have forgotten to mention in the press releases 
that this crackdownalso applies to pensioners. An oversight for sure.

Q: This applies to the welfare system. Will it apply to pensions?

Scott Morrison:

To the extent that there are income and asset assessment issues relating to 
that, then people need to obviously accurately report their income and assets. 
Income and asset testing is essential to the operation of the welfare system.

Q: Other changes, more stringent ensuring that assets are disclosed, do these 
changes apply to pensions?


Scott Morrison:

It applies to the entire social welfare system.

It applies to the entire social welfare system. Of course it would.

Why would it not apply to it in its entirety?

Bill Shorten is rolling on to a town hall meeting in Nowra tonight but I think 
we are safe to fold the Politics Live tent for today. Let’s assess the sum of 
the parts.

Press Club as part of the 2016 election campaign in Canberra, Australian

 * Bill Shorten made his final pitch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/28/bill-shorten-coalitions-trickle-down-economics-risks-brexit-style-alienation>
 with a speech at the National Press Club. The Labor leader made his most 
coherent campaign pitch on why Labor was taking a different policy approach 
this election cycle. He said the focus couldn’t be exclusively on growth 
without considering equality and societal cohesion. “The Liberals are asking 
Australians to reject the cooperative economic model and the social wage that 
has held our nation together for more than 30 years and delivered a 
quarter-century of growth, and embark instead upon a radical, expensive 
experiment in trickle-down economics. The gathering push of extreme right-wing 
populism round the globe are a warning to all of us, not to leave people behind 
... we must give every citizen a sense of being an active participant in 
transition, in control of what’s happening to them, not a passive observer of 
change, left behind on the scrap heap.”

 * Malcolm Turnbull pushed on with campaigning in Brisbane, pressing his theme 
of stability. Back in Canberra, the government’s economic team unveiled their 
final costings. The Coalition says it will launch another crackdown on benefit 
recipients, including welfare folks and pensioners, by increasing data matching 
and debt recovery, improving the budget bottom line by $2bn. When the 
Coalition’s $1bn election spend was netted out, the impact was a $1bn 
improvement to the budget bottom line. So the welfare crackdown funds the 
election spend. Welfare and seniors groups were unimpressed.

Of course the costings milestone means we are fully out of the policy phase of 
the campaign: it’s pure politics now until Saturday. Strong drink may be 
required. Thanks very much for your company through the day. We’ll be back from 
sunrise tomorrow for Wednesday. Until then, take care.

There is a new Essential poll this evening. It still has Labor ahead on the 
two-party preferred measure 51% to 49%.

 * 40% (up 2% from 2 weeks ago) of respondents approve of the job Malcolm 
Turnbull is doing as prime minister and 40% (no change) disapprove – a net 
approval rating of 0 (up 2).

 * 37% (up 3% in last 2 weeks) of respondents approve of the job Bill Shorten 
is doing as opposition leader and 39% (down 1%) disapprove – a change in his 
net rating from -6 to -2.

 * 40% (no change) of respondents think Malcolm Turnbull would make the better 
prime minister and 29% (no change) thinkBill Shorten would make the better 
prime minister.

 * 43% of men prefer Malcolm Turnbull and 30% prefer Bill Shorten.

 * 38% of women prefer Malcolm Turnbull and 29% prefer Bill Shorten.

And then there’s Medicare.


 * 50% think it is likely that the Liberal party will attempt to privatise 
Medicare if they win the federal election.
 
Acoss chief Cassandra Goldie is on Sky News now about the welfare crackdown. 
She says debt collections from benefit recipients have to be handled very 
carefully. Goldie says people on benefits try and pick up bits and pieces of 
work to supplement their incomes, and it isn’t always easy to forecast in 
advance what income you might earn.

It has to be very carefully done.
 
Mike Bowers has taken a bunch of great pictures today, many of which I haven’t 
had a chance to share.

The social services minister, Christian Porter, is on Sky News now, explaining 
the savings measure. He makes it clear that when it comes to debt repayments, 
if people are paying income tax, the tax office could move in for debt recovery.

He’s asked whether this is a valid costing, given we have heard about these 
compliance measures before today’s frolic. Porter says the methodology behind 
today’s announcement has already resulted in the government beating their 
recovery target by 20%. He says the savings achieved to date are in the 
hundreds of millions.

The Australian Council of Social Service chief, Cassandra Goldie, is clearly 
unimpressed and has issued a short statement.

Australia’s lowest-income earners and most vulnerable households have borne 
the brunt of Coalition savings measures in three successive budgets and enough 
is enough. Acoss strongly opposes taking any more money out of income support 
payments. This is the last place theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> should be looking for 
savings to fund new election spending promises. People are struggling to 
survive on $38 dollars a day Newstart payments which have not been increased in 
two decades.
 
Some quick reaction from National Seniors about the data matching. Sarah 
Saunders says the group has not yet been given details of the new savings 
measure, but people would resent being treated “as ripping off the system if 
that is the mentality”. She says people who are claiming benefits invalidly 
should not be getting benefits.

Scott Morrison said this afternoon the measures would enhance the “integrity 
and compliance of social welfare payments” through improved income data 
matching, better engagement with welfare recipients, more accurate income 
disclosure of assets and better identification and recovery of debts.

Saunders says seniors will welcome better engagement because they struggle to 
get through to Centrelink and “when they do, they often get the wrong 
information”. National Seniors has already warned thatage pensioners are angry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/02/pension-changes-coalition-warned-of-red-hot-anger-election?CMP=soc_567>
 at the tightening of the assets test which is estimated to push 100,000 people 
off the pension. From January, singles with savings and assets of more than 
$547,000 (excluding the family home) will lose the age pension while couples 
with savings and assets of $823,000 will lose the pension. On the strength of 
those changes, National Seniors has been running forums in four marginal seats: 
Brisbane, Chisolm, Hindmarsh and Hasluck. “It is surprising how passionate 
people have been in the forums, there are people yelling from the back of the 
room over changes. Single women particularly say they will decimated by the 
changes.”
 
Sticking with cynicism if you can bear it: Labor has already cut that quote 
fromMalcolm Turnbull into a campaign advertisement.

If you weren’t with me earlier today, let me walk you through this.

 * This morning, the prime minister, as a prelude to a specific criticism he 
intended to make about a Labor backflip, said sometimes political parties say 
one thing and do another.Malcolm Turnbull went on to say look at what Labor did 
on the school kids bonus: attacked the Coalition for getting rid of it, then 
supported the Coalition’s position.

 * Bill Shorten used his final pitch at the National Press Club at lunchtime 
to take the Turnbull quote out of context, obviously as a prelude to the new 
campaign advertisement. The declaration from Turnbull, Shorten said, was a
defining moment in the 2016 election campaign. The suggestion here was the 
Coalition will say one thing and do another, and here was Turnbull admitting 
this in a moment of candour.

Here’s the advertisement, or one of them anyway, I’ve seen another version as 
well.
 Saying one thing and doing another. 
My analysis of this remains the same: Labor is trying to make an integrity 
point by excising one quote from Turnbull that meant something entirely 
different in its proper context. It might turn a few voter’s heads. But it’s a 
slick willy practice inherently without integrity, isn’t it?
 
Here, apparently, are the supplementary details on the data matching saving. 
Make sure you clear your calendar to ensure you have sufficient time to read 
this material. You can see it’s an epic.

Too much cynicism from the respective campaigns today, scrambling inelegantly 
to Saturday.
 
Back to the Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> 
and costings, just so we are clear: the final pitch from the government is 
welfare recipients (and pensioners, even though we don’t mention that 
explicitly in our documents) will pay (if they don’t come up well after a data 
matching exercise) for the election goodies we’ve rolled out over the past 
seven and a half weeks.

I could say grannies for dunny blocks but that might be rude.
 
Several more questions about super, including whether Labor has now joined the 
government in pushing out an increase to the super guarantee until 2018.

Chris Bowen:

Yes, that’s right, the timetable, yes.
 
A question about superannuation. Doesn’t Labor have an obligation to be 
straight about what it intends to do?

Chris Bowen:

What we’ve done is similar to what the government has done on the backpacker 
tax. What we’ve said is we’ve never had a quarrel with how much money the 
government raises through these measures but we have a quarrel with two aspects 
in particular - the retrospective nature of the measure you refer to and 
whether it could actually be implemented. Whether it could actually be done.

It’s possible that neither side of politics will implement this measure if 
it’s not implementable. Now, very frankly, we do not have the resources of 
government to make the determination as to whether it is implementable. So we 
remain and will remain deeply concerned and opposed to aspects of 
retrospectivity.
 
Questions now. The first one is about the zombie savings measures – Labor did 
the same thing with private health insurance in the past, carrying a saving 
that was unlikely to pass until it finally did pass. So why criticise the 
government for their zombie measures?

Chris Bowen says he knows the Senate is not going to pass measurers making 
unemployed people wait or changes that affect pensioners,they are not going to 
cop them and there has to come a time when reality is reflected in the budget 
documents, there just has to.

Tony Burke:

This is a double-dissolution election. It was open to the government to make 
any one of those zombie measures a trigger, in which case they would be 
eligible for the joint sitting if they win the election. They didn’t do it with 
a single one of them. These zombie measures are entirely an accounting trick 
that the government is engaging in to prop up their budget bottom line.
 
The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, and the shadow finance minister, Tony Burke
, are now holding a press conference in response to the Coalition’s costings 
and new savings measures.

Chris Bowen:

I note that the treasurer struggled to detail and explain those savings 
measures. We would like to know, of course, how different these are to the 
savings measures which were announced in the budget and then Myefo, which 
looked very, very similar.

When were these savings costed? They don’t appear on the election costings’ 
website, which means they were probably costed by treasury before PEFO so we 
question whether they are the most up-to-date costings available.

Of course we will look at them in detail. I noticed the treasurer referred 
them to the social security minister, he couldn’t answer the questions about 
them. So of course we look forward to those answers and we will consider them 
in due course.

Obviously, we would need to know exactly how many people would be affected and 
how it is different to the $5.7bn in savings announced since the 2015/16 budget 
from better compliance. This government has a habit of announcing compliance 
measures with very significant amounts of money attached to them but, of 
course, we would like to see a report on just how successful those measures 
have been in considering the government’s [new] measures.

(Bowen is exactly right about this. I expressed scepticism a couple of posts 
ago about the capacity of the government to extract $2bn from data matching 
with that context in mind. We’ve seen compliance measures in the budget before.)
 
The government is also going to redirect $864m from uncommitted funds (ie: an 
underspend) in the infrastructure investment program, as well as community 
development grants and the national stronger regions program.
 
Oh, and the government must have forgotten to mention in the press releases 
that this crackdownalso applies to pensioners. An oversight for sure.

Q: This applies to the welfare system. Will it apply to pensions?

Scott Morrison:

that, then people need to obviously accurately report their income and assets. 
Income and asset testing is essential to the operation of the welfare system.

Q: Other changes, more stringent ensuring that assets are disclosed, do these 
changes apply to pensions?


Scott Morrison:

It applies to the entire social welfare system. Of course it would.

Why would it not apply to it in its entirety?
