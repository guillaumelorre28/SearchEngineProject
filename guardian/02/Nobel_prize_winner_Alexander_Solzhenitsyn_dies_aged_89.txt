The Soviet dissident writer and Nobel literature prize winner Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn has died aged 89, according to the Interfax news agency.

The agency said he died of a stroke, although his son Stepan Solzhenitsyn said 
his father died of heart failure. The author had suffered from ill heath, 
including high blood pressure, in recent years.

Solzhenitsyn served with the Red Army in the Second World War but became one 
of the most prominent dissidents of the Soviet era, enduring labour camps, 
cancer and persecution under the Soviet regime.

His experience of the network of labour camps was vividly described in his 
work One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.

His key works, including "The First Circle" and "Cancer Ward" brought him 
world admiration and the 1970 Nobel Literature prize.

He was stripped of his citizenship and sent into exile in 1974 after the 
publication of "The Gulag Archipelago", his monumental history of the Soviet 
police state. Solzhenitsyn then moved to the United States, returning to 
post-SovietRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> as a hero in 1994.

He was born on December 11 1918, studied physics and mathematics at Rostov 
University and became a Soviet army officer after Hitler's invasion in 1941.
