Barcelona are likely to be without Andrés Iniesta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/andres-iniesta> for Saturday’s La Liga 
game at home to Valencia as he has not recovered sufficiently from a bruised 
pelvis.

The midfielder had to be replaced by Xavi eight minutes into the second half 
of Wednesday’sChampions League quarter-final first leg at Paris Saint-Germain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/15/psg-barcelona-champions-league-quarter-final-match-report>
, after tangling with the PSG midfielder Javier Pastore.

“He is much better but he didn’t train so in principle and barring a miracle 
he won’t be in the squad,” Luis Enrique, the Barça coach, told a news 
conference.

Barça can go five points clear of second-placed Real Madrid, who host Málaga 
in a later kick-off, with a win at the Camp Nou, althoughValencia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/valencia> are on a 10-match unbeaten run.
