Two Turkish men have been found guilty of smuggling more than three tonnes of 
cocaine after what was said to have been the biggest seizure of the class A 
drug in the UK.

Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen were found guilty by a majority verdict at the high 
court in Glasgow.

Charges against co-accused Kayacan Dalgakiran, Mustafa Guven, Umit Colakel and 
Ibrahim Dag were found not proven by majority verdict.

The drugs, estimated to be worth Â£500m, were found inside the ship MV Hamal 
about 100 miles off the coast ofAberdeen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/aberdeen> in April 2015.

The Tanzania-registered tugboat, sailing from Istanbul, Turkey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey>, to Tenerife in the Canary Islands 
and then to the North Sea, was stopped by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Somerset 
and Border Force cutter Valiant, with the drugs found on board.

Sahin, 47, and Ozmen, 51, were found guilty of being knowingly concerned with 
the carrying and concealing of cocaine on the ship between 20 February and 23 
April 2015, and of being concerned in the supply of cocaine between 21 April 
and 23 April 2015.

Lord Kinclaven deferred sentence on the pair until 12 August. 

Dalgakiran, 64, Guven, 48, Colakel, 39, and Dag, 48, were acquitted of the 
smuggling and supply charges by the jury of 14 men and women.
