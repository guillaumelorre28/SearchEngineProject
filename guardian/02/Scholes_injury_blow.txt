Paul Scholes sustained a knee ligament injury in the first half of Manchester 
United's <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchesterunited> Champions 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> match against 
Aalborg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aabaalborg> last night. 

"How serious, we don't know, but it's the medial ligaments and it will keep 
him out for six to eight weeks," Sir Alex Ferguson reported. "We hope it's 
nothing more."

Wayne Rooney will have an x-ray to determine if he has damaged his ankle 
ligaments and is likely to miss Saturday's game at Blackburn, casting a doubt 
over his part in England's World Cup qualifier at home to Kazakhstan on October 
11.
