Reader NatashaS recommends the scene from Ian McEwan’s novel where Cecilia and 
Robbie finally indulge in their long-repressed desires for each other, noting 
its integrity to the plot of the novel.

This Italian film is acclaimed for its opulence, elegance, and attention to 
detail. The sex scene that was among readers’ favourites was the sensuous 
encounter in a field between Tilda Swinton’s Emma and her lover Antonio. 
WinterNow commented: “You could almost feel the sunshine and small insects 
through the screen.”

Plenty of readers had something to say about this Marlon Brando film following 
the story of two lovers, an American hotelier, recently widowed, and a young 
Parisian woman, who begin an anonymous relationship that plays out discretely 
behind the walls of a small apartment. Many recalled with gleeful horror the 
scene involving “the stick of butter!”

Alan Moore’s graphic-novel breakdown of the superhero genre, and the 
blockbuster film based upon it, were given mention for the sex scene between 
two of its heroes, Silk Spectre and Nite Owl. They rekindle an old flame that 
they once shared after having saved a crowd of people from a burning building 
in true superhero fashion. Unfortunately, this victory is brought back down to 
earth by a disappointing, yet humorous climax.

This dark comedy television series from League of Gentleman creator Jeremy 
Dyson and Simon Ashdown is set in an alternate Blackpool rife with crime and 
colour. An incestuous scene involving the nightclub owner Shirley and his own 
mother, Mercy, was a favourite among readers for its bleak humour, with jays37 
describing it as “utterly surreal. Brilliant.”

This peculiar Spanish-language comedy of lust, family loyalties and betrayal 
appeared among readers’ favourites for its various sex scenes, especially those 
between Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem, as well as when one where Jordi Mollà 
compares Cruz’s breasts to serrano ham and omelette.

By far readers’ favourite, Betty Blue’s intense opening sex scene captures the 
erotic and devoted love between the two main characters Betty and Zorg, 
immediately allowing the viewer to understand the deep, maddening bond between 
these two. One reader, roderickspode, recalled attending a screening of it 
where one couple made “the fastest exit from the cinema I am ever likely to 
witness”.

involving a variety of domestic items, the most memorable being an unwelcome

This film set in Thatcher-era London follows the fortunes of a Pakistani 
family who own a launderette. Our reader, taninfan, recommended the furtive 
encounter between Johnny and Omar in the launderette just before it opens.
