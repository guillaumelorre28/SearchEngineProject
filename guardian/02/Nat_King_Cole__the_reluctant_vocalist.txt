In 1937, Nat King Cole and his trio started a residency at the Sewanee Inn, an 
LA nightclub. Cole was a sprightly pianist who, at this point, had not sung 
professionally, but legend has it that a big-spending client drunkenly badgered 
him to sing. Cole reluctantly acquiesced with a version of Sweet Lorraine, 
showcasing a honey-smooth baritone that would overshadow his pianistic skills. 
Since then plenty of talented instrumentalists – from Sarah Vaughan to Diana 
Krall, from Chet Baker to Jamie Cullum – have become better known as reluctant 
vocalists.
