Katie Price and Alex Reid's marriage is about to be no more, apparently 
<http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/852450-is-katie-prices-40m-fortune-delaying-split-with-alex-reid>
. Sad news for the couple and indeed for ITV2, where they must be wondering 
about what might have been had Price not switched What Katie Did Next to Living 
last summer. What Katie Did After That, and Alex Reid the Next Chapter perhaps? 
How lovely they would have looked in the schedules. As it is, if Living does 
give Reid his own spin-off show, à la Peter Andre, it's possible the two could 
find themselves battling each other for ratings. Monkey only worries for any 
future Next Chapters – and whether eventually all factual TV will be controlled 
by Price …
