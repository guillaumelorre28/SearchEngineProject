Cutting carbon emissions is but one aspect of the changes needed for the 
infrastructure and mode of operation of the UK (Osborne reveals deal with

, 5 October). On the energy side, we need to increase development and 
installation of a variety of renewable energy sources. These need to be 
supported with energy storage schemes. Tidal barrages provide an obvious way to 
combine both opportunities. We also need to develop and use technology to 
improve energy efficiency. This involves both more efficient operation of 
energy use and the reduction in use that is not socially useful. We make many 
things that add little benefit to life – for instance our overpackaging of many 
small retail items with moulded plastic. All of this needs to be viewed in ways 
to make our living more sustainable in the long run in terms of the use of 
world resources.

• Whatever one’s political party, the establishment of a National 
Infrastructure Commission will be welcome if it drives forward the painfully 
slow process of government commitment to the projects the UK needs if it is to 
compete, thrive and survive in a global economy. Not least among its priorities 
must be a renaissance in low-carbon rapid rail links around the UK and not just

The most recent government policy document on this, the national networks 
national policy statement 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-networks-national-policy-statement>
 (published under the highly successful 2008 regime that has speeded up 
planning decisions from up to 10 years to no more than six months) is 
unfortunately completely devoid of any named projects. The National 
Infrastructure Plan gives a shopping list of projects but stops short of the 
policy and scientific assessment needed to move them forward.

The Infrastructure Planning Commission, established from 2008, was so 
successful in embedding speedier decisions that by 2012 it could be embedded 
within the Planning Inspectorate. However, with its demise it is clear that an 
independent watchdog to ensure the UK is really tackling its infrastructure 
challenge is sorely missing.

• Andrew Adonis <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrew-adonis> worked 
closely with the Lib Dems at party headquarters during the 1990s before 
succumbing to Tony Blair’s charms and joining New Labour. He was even, for a 
time, the Liberal-SDP Alliance’s prospective parliamentary candidate for West 
Wiltshire. Now we read that Adonis is to resign the Labour whip to work closely 
with the Conservative government. Where next Andrew?

• Memo to Lord Adonis in his new role as adviser on infrastructure projects: 
read Zoe Williams’ article on the use of quantitative easing for green and 
social investment (It’s fine to print money, so long as it’s not for the people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/04/printing-money-jeremy-corbyn-quantitative-easing-peoples-qe>
, 5 October). As the dark, deflationary clouds from China and elsewhere gather, 
and as unemployment and underemployment are still to be found in great swaths 
of the country, Adonis could propose an infrastructure programme that can help 
deal with these threats. This would involve using QE to fund increased economic 
activity that protects the environment through a programme to make all the UK’s 
30m homes, offices and factories energy efficient.

This decades-long energy infrastructure project would create new jobs in a 
vast range of skills in every part of the country. The work and business 
opportunities generated in every constituency will provide huge tax revenues 
and so calm even the most ardent deficit botherers. In short, it would be QE 
not just for the people, but also for the planet.

• So Adonis resigns from Labour to manage grandiose megaprojects but notably 
does not resign his position on the HS2 Ltd board. Is this the moment that the 
Labour party will re-find Labour values and priorities in transport and 
confront its support for the elitist and hugely expensive HS2 proposal? 
Contrary to what Frank Field (Tax credits and trains can help Jeremy Corbyn 
outflank Tories 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/04/tax-credits-trains-can-help-jeremy-corbyn-outflank-tories>
, 4 October) says, HS2 is not a done deal. It has always been said that it 
requires cross-party support, and Labour opposition at the bill’s third reading 
would very likely derail it. This would enable Labour to redeploy the huge 
expenditure to implement the many higher priority improvements to commuter 
services and regional links, which are what ordinary people use and which offer 
so much better value for money.

• What a pronounced sense of irony you are developing in the way you report 
the news. Andrew Adonis is a pre-eminent thinker whose main policy developments 
for the Blair government were – wait for it – academy schools and HS2. Please 
clarify the loss to theLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
party for us.
