“I have a theory that men love with their eyes, but women love with their 
ears,” said the sharp-witted Zsa Zsa Gabor, remarking profoundly on the science 
of attraction, having also certainly eared up a few husbands in her time. But 
perhaps she was also interested in what was between men’s ears. Greek 
philosophers Diogenes and Epictetus more or less said the same thing as each 
other, centuries apart, in support of human lobes: “We have two ears and one 
tongue so that we can listen more and speak less.” And writer David Foster 
Wallace pointed out a stark difference in subtlety between two ear episodes in 
film, a notoriously violent incident inReservoir Dogs 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjoVtSjcBGA> (not for the faint-hearted) and 
the mysterious appearance of a severed ear on a lawn at the beginning of Blue 
Velvet: “Quentin Tarantino is interested in watching somebody’s ear getting cut 
off; David Lynch is interested in the ear.”

 In one ear ... David Lynch’s Blue Velvet (1986) 
But let’s now put our own ears to the ground. Aren’t all songs about ears and 
listening, I hear you say? In a sense they are, in the way that much art is 
about seeing, but this week we are are looking for songs on a more specific 
frequency, those that mention the action of hearing or ear-related themes. 
Certain phrases may crop up, and it’s interesting how non-literal these actions 
are, otherwise they would be comical. Putting your ear to the ground is 
possible, but to be “all ears”? Or to go in one ear and out the other, to chew 
someone’s ear (not unless you are Mike Tyson), to say that your ears are 
burning, to prick up your ears (perhaps if a rabbit), to have flea in the ear 
(not unless a cat), to be wet behind the ears, to fall on deaf ears, to be up 
to one’s ears, or to lend an ear (can I have it back now, please?). They all 
still count in this topic. The same approximation applies to hearing voices (or 
is that the brain, not the ears?) being at a hearing, to hear from someone (by 
letter or email), or indeed the phrase “Hear! Hear!” in parliament, where it is 
unlikely anyone is really listening at all.

The ear is an extraordinary piece of biological evolution. With inner, middle 
and outer components, and including the pinna, tympanic membrane and cochlea, 
it performs a miracle of vibration and impedance matching to make all of this 
possible. Humans can generally hear sounds between 20Hz and 20,000Hz, but 
higher ultrasonic ranges are used by bats and dogs, among others, and a deeper 
range of infrasound language sensed in the jaws of snakes, or in the language 
of whales, dolphins, giraffes and elephants. There is a whole wide world of 
music we will never hear.

Yet some humans seem to hear more than others. Beethoven, after his deafness 
set in, somehow heard in his head, perhaps even his body, while in a very 
different context, the notoriously demanding, but pioneering Mancunian producer 
Martin Hannett, from the early Joy Division and Factory Records era, was known 
to go to the Peak District to record silence. Here his colourful character, and 
language, is captured by Andy Serkis in the film24 Hour Party People 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274309/>. His character has reportedly been 
described by Serkis as more difficult than Gollum.

There’s another question worth asking: is there a difference between listening 
and hearing? Is one intentional and the other by accident? Lastly, please also 
remember that the topic ofeavesdropping 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jul/14/readers-recommend-songs-eavesdropping-results>
