Ever since Omar Souleyman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/08/omar-souleyman-syria-singer-sweden-visa>
 brought his frenzied combination of Syrian dabke and Iraqi folk to the UK, 
he’s been steadily filling up his contacts book. For Bahdeni Nami, his second 
proper studio album, he’s enlisted help in various guises fromFour Tet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/11/four-tet-kieran-hebden-morning-evening-plastic-people>
,Gilles Peterson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/16/groove-improve-dj-skills-dance-music-gilles-peterson>
, Modeselektor and Legowelt.

But it’s not all change for Souleyman, whose live shows have lit up everything 
from Syrian weddings to sweatbox indie venues in north London. Recorded in 
Istanbul, this album is adorned with virtuosic saz work, handclaps, wails and 
plenty of lovelorn lyrics. He continues to blend these traditions with a 
relentless party-starting ethos, perhaps best observed on the title track, not 
to mention Legowelt’s club-orientated remix of it.
