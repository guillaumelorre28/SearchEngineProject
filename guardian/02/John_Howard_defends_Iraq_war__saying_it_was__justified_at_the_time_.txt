John Howard <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/john-howard> has 
defending committing Australian troops to the Iraq war, saying he believed the 
decision was “justified at the time” and was not based on a lie.

“In the years that have gone by there’s been this constant claim that we went 
to war based on a lie,” Howard said. “There was no lie. There were errors in 
intelligence but there was no lie.”
Chilcot explained: what does the report say?

Speaking in Sydney in the wake of the publication of the Chilcot inquiry, the 
former prime minister who committed Australian troops to the invasion said that 
while intelligence breaches had been discovered since the conflict, he stood by 
the decision his government took.

“I believed that the decision to go into Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> was justified at the time and I don’t 
resile from that because I thought it was the right decision.”

In the years subsequent to the invasion, significant criticism over the war 
has centred on the “September Dossier” of 2002, an intelligence briefing, now 
discredited, that alleged Saddam Hussein’s regime had weapons of mass 
destruction that could be unleashed in 45 minutes. Those allegations became a 
key element of the public and political argument in favour of war.

No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq by the invading forces.

But Howard said Chilcot found the government had not doctored the dossier or 
pressured intelligence agencies to do so.

“One of the most important conclusions ... was the [UK] joint intelligence 
committee accepted ownership of the dossier and agreed its content. There was 
no evidence that intelligence was improperly included in the dossier or that 
Number 10 [Downing Street] improperly influenced the text.

The Chilcot report was excoriating in its assessment of the British 
government’s decision-making process over going to war, saying that the threat 
posed by dictator Saddam Hussein was overplayed, intelligence was flawed, and 
the legal basis for the war was unsatisfactory.


Chilcot also found that the decision to go to war was taken before “peaceful 
options for disarmament had been exhausted”, in particular that diplomatic 
overtures to secure a security council authorisation at the United Nations had 
not been extinguished.


Howard said he disagreed with Chilcot’s conclusion, saying “there was no hope” 
that France and Russia would agree to a security council authorisation for 
military action.

“It was very apparent to me, it was very apparent to the national security 
committee of the Australian government, that the combined determination of the 
Russians and the French to frustrate that further resolution meant that the 
diplomatic road had come to an end.

“Chilcot forms a different view – and you’ve got to remember when you’re 
dealing with things like that, that there are differences of judgement. I 
respect his view but I disagree with it.”

Howard said he regretted the loss of life in military conflict, and was 
willing to be held accountable for what occurred in the Iraq war.


“When you’re dealing with intelligence it’s very, very hard to find a 
situation where advice is beyond doubt,” he said.

“Sometimes if you wait for advice that is beyond doubt you can end up with 
very disastrous consequences.”

In the wake of Iraq, the UK has adopted the practice of holding a debate in 
the House of Commons over decisions to commit troops to conflicts. Howard said 
he did not think Australia should do the same, and that the decision over armed 
forces was a key “responsibility of the executive”.

Andrew Wilkie <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/andrew-wilkie>, the 
newly-re-elected independent MP for Denison, resigned in 2003 from his role as 
an intelligence analyst with the Office of National Assessments in protest 
against the Australian government’s decision to join the invasion of Iraq, 
arguing military intervention was not justified and intelligence was 
misrepresented by politicians.

He said the Chilcot report vindicated his position.

“John Howard and Tony Blair <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> 
and George W Bush do stand accused of war crimes. I’d like them to see an 
international court. I would like them to defend their position and try to 
prove their innocence because all of those people who do accuse them of war 
crimes, I think make a pretty compelling case.

Howard said Wilkie’s comments were “absurd”.

“Andrew Wilkie said the Iraq invasion was responsible for the Bali attack of 
2005. What about the Bali attack of 2002, infinitely greater? And he blamed it 
for the Lindt cafe siege. I mean, this is irrational.”
