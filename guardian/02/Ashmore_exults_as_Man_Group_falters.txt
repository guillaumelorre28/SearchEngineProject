Ashmore <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ashmoregroup>, the fund manager 
that invests in emerging market debt, shot to the top of the FTSE 100 
leaderboard following a glowing broker note from UBS.

The bank analysts said Ashmore's shares had underperformed (losing 5% compared 
with its peers), while its funds had outperformed. They expect it to grow as 
emerging markets live up to their name and become more significant players in 
global financial markets. They said:
 We see significant structural opportunities for growth in emerging market 
(EM) assets: i) as parts of EM become investment grade, this widens the range 
of addressable investors ii) the hunt for yield remains strong for 
liability-driven investors iii) EM corporate debt has the potential to become 
as big as sovereign debt iv) EM currencies appreciation. 
The analysts upgraded the stock from 'neutral' to 'buy' with a 420p price 
target, and added the fund manager to its "most preferred" list.

Hedge fund manager Man <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mangroup> Group, 
meanwhile, had sharply contrasting fortunes, dropping 3% to become the FTSE 
100's biggest faller. The shares have fallen 12% this week after disappointing 
recent performances by a couple of its hedge funds. They were down another 3% 
this morning at 119p.

The index just about managed to stay in positive territory, up by just 0.01% 
at 5704. The mid-cap index was 0.2% higher at 11379 points.
