Why now?

Because in May Iceland's chic capital becomes a hotbed of cultural activity 
with its annual arts festival (artfest.is <http://www.artfest.is>). The 
festival is one of the oldest and most respected in Europe and combines 
contemporary visual art, theatre and music. From May 15 to June 5, the city 
will be packed with exhibitions, gigs and street performances.

screenings, performances and experimental films.
