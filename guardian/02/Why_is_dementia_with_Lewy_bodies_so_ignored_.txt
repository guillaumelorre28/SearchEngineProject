The use of monies from the charge for plastic carrier bags to fund dementia 
research is most welcome (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/supermarkets-plastic-bag-proceeds-dementia-fund-ucl>
, 6 October). However, I hope that the research will include not only 
Alzheimer’s but the second most common form of dementia,dementia with Lewy 
bodies 
<http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dementia-with-lewy-bodies/Pages/Introduction.aspx>
. This most devastating dementia, which also links to the symptoms of 
Parkinson’s disease, is rarely referred to and mostly unknown to the public 
despite there being 130,000 sufferers in Britain. As a first step to raise 
awareness, maybeAlzheimer’s Society <http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/> should 
change its name to Dementia Society UK.

• “Our grandparents’ generation had to get to grips with the idea of importing 
strawberries from Spain and mangetout from Kenya,” says Douglas Carswell (
Singapore or Switzerland? Visions of Brexit leave a lot to be desired 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/05/brussels-eurosceptics-british-voter-out-lobby>
, 5 October). My grandfather loved his strawberries, but probably would have 
thought mangetout was something he and all his pals caught in the trenches.

• If, as suggested, the origins of The Archers lie with Yorkshire farmers 
who were also socialists (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/06/credit-where-its-due-for-archers-inspiration>
, 7 October), surely it is only a matter of time before Jeremy Corbyn appears 
to address a mass meeting on the village green to outline plans to control the 
generations-long dominance of the Archer dynasty in the area.

• Never mind who originated The Archers; who had the gall to replace the 
excitements ofDick Barton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Barton>, Special 
Agent with the trivialities of an everyday story of country folk? Boys of all 
ages have still not recovered.
