The England manager, Fabio Capello 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fabio-capello>, said he dreamed of 
emulating Alf Ramsey by winning the World Cup for England when he unveiled a 
bust of his predecessor at Wembley Stadium today.

"This is a very emotional moment for me and it's a great honour to be here," 
said Capello, who will be aiming to end England's wait to repeat Ramsey's 1966 
triumph at the World Cup finals in South Africa next year. "I hope I can bring 
back theWorld Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football> to 
stand alongside the Jules Rimet trophy that England won in 1966."

The bronze bust will be situated in the players tunnel at Wembley and, in the 
words of George Cohen, vice-captain of the 1966 team who unveiled it with 
Capello, "it will remind every player to give their best out on the pitch."

Players from the 1966-winning team, including the hat-trick scorer Geoff 
Hurst, Bobby Charlton, Ray Wilson, Martin Peters and goalkeeper Gordon Banks 
were at Wembley. "Alf was a remarkable man and still has the respect of 
everyone who ever played for him. He was a disciplinarian but a man who you 
would give your all for," said Charlton.

"I think Fabio Capello has very similar qualities and hopefully he can achieve 
the same results as Sir Alf did." Ramsey was England manager from 1963 until 
1974 anddied aged 79 in 1999
