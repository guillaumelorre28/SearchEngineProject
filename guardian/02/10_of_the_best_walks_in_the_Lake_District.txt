Borger Dalr, Borrowdale

Borger Dalr was described by the famed fellwalker and writer Alfred Wainwright 
as the "finest square mile in Lakeland" and it's not difficult to see why. 
You'll climb Castle Crag, the site of a hill fort some 2,000 years ago, which, 
though small in stature, offers some of the finest views you will ever see. 
Take a moment to pause at Peace How, a small summit bought for the benefit of 
the nation in 1917 as a place where soldiers returning from the front line 
could find some tranquillity.

There's something morbidly fascinating about corpse roads and there are plenty 
of them in a place as rural as Cumbria. If you know you're walking along one, 
you can almost feel the steps of the countless people who've gone before you, 
carrying their dead from their remote communities to their final resting 
places. But this walk isn't all gloomy. Loweswater is a really pretty little 
lake and the woodlands which surround it are home to a number of red squirrels. 
It's worth heading off on this walk after rain – something there's rarely a 
shortage of in the Lake District – as Holme Force Falls are at their best on a 
soggy day.

In a county so packed with meres, tarns and water (notice I didn't say 'lakes' 
– there's only one true lake in the Lake District and that's Bassenthwaite 
Lake, north of Keswick), it would seem odd not to include a boat ride on at 
least one walk. The beautifulSteam Yacht Gondola 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/gondola/> was first launched in 1859 then 
rescued and rebuilt by the National Trust in 1980. Coniston itself is a 
walkers' paradise with many making the summit of the Old Man their goal. 
Foodies should seek out nearbyYew Tree Farm <http://www.yewtree-farm.com/>, 
another National Trust tenant, which featured in the film Miss Potter with 
Renee Zellwegger and sells delicious farm-bred Herdwick and Belted Galloway 
meat.

If you want to go walking without the company of scores of other hikers, head 
west. This side of the Lake District boasts unspoilt simple beauty and, 
probably because of its perceived inaccessibility, the area doesn't get as busy 
as the Lakes' heartlands. But those who don't venture the few extra miles are 
missing out. From the stark beauty ofWasdale 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wasdale-eskdale-and-duddon/> and its 
impressive screes to the timeless views (pictured) and Roman history of 
Eskdale, these valleys are an exceptional treat. For a quirky picnic point on 
this walk, stop at Greendale Tarn – it's set in a deep hollow and its stream, 
oddly, looks like it's flowing the wrong way.

This idyllic fell-top tarn offers one of the most iconic views in the Lake 
District – but despite looking like it has been there for eternity, it is 
actually man-made, created by a Leeds mill owner in 1865. Gifted to the 
National Trust by Beatrix Potter, the path around it has been made accessible 
for buggies and mobility scooters, which makes it a haven for walkers of all 
ages and abilities. Those with more walking experience should try this short 
steep approach to the tarn past Tom Gill Beck – pick a clear day for stunning 
views across Wetherlam and the Coniston fells.

In Windermere, you're right in the heart of the Lakes so finding 
accommodation, refreshment and a little retail therapy is never difficult. This 
area has been popular with visitors for centuries and with good reason. It 
boasts majestic views – an attraction which the Victorians, in particular, made 
the most of. Claife Heights, on the lake's western shore, featured in one of 
the first guidebooks to the Lakes, written by Thomas West in 1778. When the 
viewing station itself was built, its creators put coloured glass in the 
windows so that visitors could appreciate the views throughout the seasons, no 
matter when they visited. Light green glass allowed them to see how the scenery 
looked in spring, for example, with dark blue being reminiscent of moonlight 
and light blue giving the illusion of winter.

It's unusual to see bridges designated as Grade I listed 'buildings', but 
Stockley Bridge near Seathwaite is such a rare specimen that it's been given 
that protection. It's on an old packhorse route where precious goods such as 
wool and coal were transported for centuries. And the bridge isn't the only 
historic relic in this area – it's also where you'll find the very rare 
vendace, a fish from the last glacial period which only lives in Sprinkling 
Tarn and the watercourses which flow into Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite Lake. 
Seathwaite also holds a place in history for its rainfall. On 19 November 2009, 
316mm of rain fell here – a UK record for a 24-hour period and a major 
contributing factor in the devastating floods which hit the county. But don't 
let the threat of rain put you off – the scenery around here is stunning.

National Trust rangers made a great find this winter – the tallest tree in 
Cumbria and the tallest grand fir in England towering above its neighbours in 
Skelghyll Woods near Ambleside. At 57.8 metres, its top branches are higher 
than Nelson's Column. Keep a lookout for it as you pass through the woods at 
the start of this walk. And if you're here between April and June, it's worth a 
little diversion toStagshaw Gardens 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/stagshaw-garden/>, a real hidden horticultural 
gem with an impressive array of azaleas, rhododendrons and camellias. Ambleside 
itself is a good place to while away a little time with its array of 
independent shops and restaurants, as well as the quirkyBridge House 
<http://www.visitcumbria.com/amb/bridge-house.htm> and nearby Townend 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/townend/>, a house with a fascinating history 
to share.

The trees at the southern tip of Buttermere, known as The Sentinels, are said 
to be the most photographed in the country. Crummock Water is fed by Scale 
Force, the highest falls in the Lake District, and has a pretty pebbly beach at 
its northern tip which is a great place for a picnic and a swim in the summer. 
Nearby is theKirkstile Inn <http://kirkstile.com/> where you can sip a pint of 
Melbreak while gazing admiringly at the mountain of the same name. There are 
some easy walks around Buttermere, or around Cinderdale Common at Crummock, but 
for something a little more challenging, head to Rannerdale Knotts. The valley 
is thought to be where Norman warriors were defeated in battle – and the 
bluebells which bloom there every spring are said to grow from their blood. I'm 
not sure how something so lovely can come from such a gory legend!

Stargazing stroll at Friar's Crag, Keswick

A view described by John Ruskin as one of the three most beautiful scenes in 
Europe, Friar's Crag is a promontory jutting into Derwentwater looking out 
towards Derwent Isle and the surrounding scenery. The land in this area was the 
first bit of the Lake District to be owned by the National Trust, and this 
gentle stroll to the lakeside will take you past memorials to both Ruskin and 
Canon Rawsley, one of the Trust's founders. On a clear summer night, the open 
space and lack of light pollution makes this a perfect spot for stargazing.
