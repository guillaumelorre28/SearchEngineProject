You might think that our towns and cities are so jam-packed with human 
inhabitants, that there's little room for the rest of the animal kingdom. Yet 
nothing could be further from the truth. Our cities are a mosaic of 
"micro-habitats" providing food, water, green spaces and places to breed â€“ the 
natural equivalent of a five-star hotel. Hence the presence of a huge range of 
animals, from badgers to bats, hawkmoths to herons, and sparrows to seals..

This Saturday, we aim to prove that wildlife doesn't simply survive in urban 
areas, it thrives. We look at the history of urban wildlife and city dwellers' 
enduring love of nature. Our illustrated spotter's guides will help kids 
identify what's out there, we pinpoint wildlife hotspots across the UK and 
three "nature champions" reveal what inspires their commitment to urban 
wildlife.

So if you live in a town, city or suburb, make the most of it this summer by 
tracking down your local city critters. Share your finds with us on Twitter 
(#outandabout). Happy spotting!
