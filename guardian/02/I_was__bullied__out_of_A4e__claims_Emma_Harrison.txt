David Cameron's former families' tsar gave an extraordinary performance in 
defence of the welfare-to-work companyA4e <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/a4e> 
on Wednesday night in her first lengthy interview since quitting the firm.

Emma Harrison <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/emma-harrison> told Channel 4 
News she was "bullied" out of her job in a Westminster "maelstrom" and she 
rejected claims that A4E was missing targets for the government's work 
programme. She resigned as Cameron's adviser and then as head of A4e in 
February, amid fraud investigations into the firm, but she remains its biggest 
shareholder.

She rejected claims A4e had found jobs lasting at least six months for fewer 
than 4% of people referred under the work programme, adding she had been a 
"useful face for the politics people to have a go at". The Department for Work 
and Pensions (DWP) has set a 5.5% minimum target for private firms in the 
payment-by-results arrangement.

Harrison repeatedly said the information was wrong, but she was not able to 
supply the correct figures.

"What really, really matters is that, through the work programme, tens of 
thousands of people are getting jobs," she said , adding that the taxpayer 
received £2 back for every £1 spent. Official statistics on the performance of 
the programme are to be released by the DWP later this year.

A4e came under fire for paying £11m in dividends last year, 87% to Harrison, 
despite all its UK turnover, estimated at up to £180m, resulting from 
government welfare contracts.
