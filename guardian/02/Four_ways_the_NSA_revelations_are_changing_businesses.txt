It's been one year since Edward Snowden revealed he was the source of the 
leaked details on the NSA's Prism surveillance programme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video>
. His revelations massivelyrocked public trust in the internet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/feb/18/cloud-computing-nsa-privacy-breaches-crisis-confidence>
 and shocked even the most cynical of conspiracy theorists. The aftershocks 
have been felt worldwide, particularly bytech giants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/08/nsa-revelations-fears-cloud-computing>
 and politicians.

With headline after headline detailing such high-profile repercussions, it 
begs the question: how has Snowden changed the attitude of ICT decision-makers 
towards the cloud?

NTT Communications sought to find some answers and carried out a study of 
1,000 ICT decision-makers in large companies in the UK, France, Germany, Hong 
Kong and the US. It found that there arefour areas where businesses have felt 
the shocks 
<http://nsaaftershocks.com/wp-content/themes/nsa/images/NTTC_Report_WEB.pdf>, 
all of which have led them to rethink the way they store and manage sensitive 
commercial data:

1) Data sovereignty tops the agenda
In the post-Snowden world, data sovereignty – where data is physically hosted 
– is now a hugely contentious subject for businesses. There are now very few 
ICT decision-makers that believe location is irrelevant when it comes to 
storing company data. This is because keeping sensitive information in a 
country where the authorities can access or monitor it without consent 
constitutes a significant business risk. As a result, many European 
organisations (97%) that are looking to adopt cloud are now choosing providers 
located in their own region. This trend also applies to businesses already 
using cloud services – some are now choosing to move their data to a location 
where they know it will be safe.

2) Training to keep up to date on compliance and regulation
ICT decision-makers are now much more aware of the need to have a detailed 
knowledge oflegislation affecting their data 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/dec/16/data-protection-cloud-computing-2014>
. More than four fifths of CIOs (84%) feel they need more training on data 
protection laws. For companies that operate in the legal or financial sector 
this is particularly important. Despite the fact that surveillance can occur 
without their consent or knowledge, they're still required to adhere to the 
strict data regulations. Therefore, the NSA allegations have prompted many of 
these organisations to rethink the training programmes they carry out.

3) Changing procurement and delaying projects
Snowden is compelling ICT decision-makers to be tighter in their due 
diligence. Just over half (52%) of ICT decision-makers are now carrying out 
checks in greater detail on cloud providers during the procurement process, 
which includes researching the physical location of the data centre, its 
security credentials and who actually owns the company. However, there are some 
ICT decision-makers going even further, deciding to abandon, delay or even 
avoid the cloud completely as a direct result of the revelations. These are 
obviously natural reactions, but businesses need to remember that provided they 
scrutinise cloud providers, they can alleviate security fears and still reap 
the benefits of cloud computing.

4) Looking to alternatives for data security
82% of all ICT decision-makers globally agree with proposals made by German 
chancellor Angela Merkel for separating data networks 
<http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2014/02/17/germanys-merkel-calls-separate-european-internet/>
. In theory, this should work, but in practice it is near-impossible as it 
raises serious questions for businesses trading outside of Europe and the 
individual levels of risk and security each EU country is willing to shoulder.

This suggestion has sparked a discussion about alternative methods for 
securing data, with encryption emerging as the most viable option. However, 
there has been a debate on whether theNSA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nsa> could crack some of the encryption 
coding causing more fears about data surveillance. This could present market 
opportunities for vendors to fill the gaps and offer enterprise-grade 
encryption with their current offerings.

Prism has shaken businesses and changed their attitudes towards cloud 
computing – and understandably so. But confidence can be rebuilt. Encryption is 
now being discussed more than ever as a counter-measure. In the short-term, the 
most effective solution is partnering with cloud providers that can keep 
information in-country. This way, businesses can still harness the benefits of 
cloud computing while keeping their valuable data safe.
