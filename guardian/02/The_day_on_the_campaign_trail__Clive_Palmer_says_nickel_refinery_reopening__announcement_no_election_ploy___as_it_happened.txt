I've got a podcast to record!

Now, like the good birds, I must fly. Thank you very much for your company 
today. Let’s follow our tradition and take stock of Thursday.
 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the National Press Club in Canberra this 
afternoon for his televised pre-election address, Thursday 30th June 2016.

The prime minister made his final pitch at the National Press Club with the 
confident delivery of a politician who thinks Saturday night is going to be a 
good night for theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>. Never mind that a radio 
host earlier in the day toldMalcolm Turnbull he’d better win comprehensively 
otherwise colleagues would have him for Sunday brunch. Details, details.

conference on June 30, 2016 in Logan, Australia. Photograph: Lisa Maree

The opposition leader hit the hustings in Brisbane to declare that Labor was 
ready to govern.Bill Shorten shrugged off questions about post election 
scenarios that would see him lose the Labor leadership and said he would fight 
for every last vote until 6pm on Saturday night.

Greens leader Richard Di Natale finally delivered a straight answer about 
whether the Greens would negotiate with Labor on offshore processing in the 
event of a hung parliament. No, the Greens would not negotiate was the answer 
(which followed a suggestion yesterday that they might).

The end is in sight. We will be back with the live coverage from first light 
tomorrow. Until then, go with your God, and have a hot whiskey.

Hey, presto

From the newswire service AAP.

Clive Palmer insists his announcement just days before the federal election 
that his collapsed Queensland Nickel refinery will reopen isn’t a political 
ploy to attract votes for his party. The Palmer United Party (PUP) leader, 
flanked by two Senate candidates and surrounded by party branding, revealed on 
Thursday the Yabulu refinery, near Townsville, would reopen on March 31 after 
regulatory and commercial requirements were met.

Palmer claimed he called the press conference to discuss Labor leadership 
rumblings, despite his media team earlier advising it was about the refinery 
reopening and a press release handed to journalists upon arrival indicating the 
same thing. “My speech was about politics, it wasn’t about the refinery,” he 
said.
Palmer insisted it was “purely a coincidence” that he made the announcement 
two days before Australians go to the polls. “It’s not of concern to me, 
because I’m not in politics - I’m in business. I’m more concerned about 
business,” he said.

Palmer, who isn’t recontesting his seat of Fairfax but will stay on as PUP 
chairman, has a history of outrageous political statements during election 
campaigns. In 2012 he claimed the Greens were conspiring with the CIA against 
Australia’s resources industry, only to later admit he didn’t believe those 
claims but said them to help the Liberal National Party get elected in 
Queensland. When that was put to him, Mr Palmer reiterated his announcement 
wasn’t “a political thing”. His party is running candidates only for the Senate 
and the lower house seat of Herbert, where the refinery is. Palmer said an 
increase in world nickel prices had made production feasible again.

Who needs internet in an election campaign?

From tricky to bloody difficult. I gather there’s been a significant Telstra 
outage in Victoria today, leaving various campaigns in the state without 
reliable internet access within 48 hours of polling day.

Obviously an internet outage is an equal opportunity problem impacting all 
campaigns, whatever their stripe:Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, Labor, Greens, others – 
but of course Melbourne is the home of Labor’s CHQ.

We could make an NBN joke but that might be unseemly.

I hope you aren't being tricky on IR Malcolm: ACTU

I’ve said quite a few times that it’s seriously odd that we’ve seen no 
comprehensive industrial relations policy from theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> (or from Labor) in this 
campaign, given whole campaigns have been fought over IR in my reporting 
lifetime. The ACTU smells a rat.

ACTU secretary Dave Oliver.

Despite subjecting Australia to a record-length election campaign, Malcolm 
Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> has not 
offered any long term vision for job creation or industrial relations and has 
instead left the door open to further attacks on worker’s rights. This is a 
critical failure of policy and leadership and leaves a re-elected Liberal 
government with absolutely no mandate to implement the kind of anti-worker 
reforms that so many of their big business backers have been demanding, such as 
weakening unfair dismissal laws or the introduction of individual contracts. 
Malcolm Turnbull’s silence can only be interpreted as a sign he is not planning 
any significant changes to industrial relations should he win on Saturday – 
anything else would represent a massive breach of trust with the Australian 
people.

A little jewel of frustration from Greg Jericho

Greg Jericho

One of the problems with an election campaign is whenever talk turns to 
fragility in the economy the solution presented is always one of stability. The 
government has sought to present itself as stable (after all, it has nearly 
been a year since it has changed its leader and treasurer), while the ALP 
sought to present itself as the stable party, given its role during the global 
financial crisis.

And yet both sides were not all that eager to talk about what they would 
actually do were mere stability not enough to prevent an economic downturn.

The lack of eagerness to talk about what they would do is a consequence of the 
relentless criticism by the Liberal party and sections of the media of the 
stimulus measures put in place by Labor during the financial crisis, and also 
the Labor party’s complete inability to use the crisis to challenge the myth 
that a budget surplus is prime evidence of good economic management.

Last Friday, when he rushed with barely disguised joy to speak on ABC’s 7:30 
<http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2016/s4488832.htm> about the impact of the 
Brexit vote,Malcolm Turnbull dismissed once again the measures undertaken by 
the Rudd government during the global financial crisis.

He told Leigh Sales, that “I think what shepherded Australia through the GFC 
successfully was the Chinese stimulus and the large amount of cash that John 
Howard left in the bank”.

It requires an odd sense of logic to suggest that the stimulus measures here 
didn’t work, but that the Chinese ones did. It also is a tad odd to suggest the 
“large amount of cash” helped get us through the global financial crisis.

Having a surplus does not actually do anything to spur economic growth, it is 
what you spend the money on that does it. Arguing the surplus got us through 
the GFC but the stimulus didn’t is a bit like arguing that what brings a smile 
to your children’s faces on Christmas morning is not the presents you have 
bought them but the money that was in the bank you had saved in order to buy 
the presents.

Had the stimulus measures been poorly targeted, no amount of surplus would 
have helped. And the reality is the stimulus measures worked pretty much as 
they were expected to.

My colleague Gay Alcorn has written a piece this afternoon about the CFA 
dispute in Victoria,which you can read here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/30/will-the-most-progressive-state-in-australia-cost-labor-the-election>
. If you just want the quick version.

If Labor loses this election, especially by a narrow margin, there will be the 
usual post mortems and blame thrown around. Was it the national campaign 
office? Was it leaderBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten>? Was it the policy 
mix, or a weakness in the strategy to win crucial marginal seats?

What would have seemed unthinkable a few weeks ago may be another question 
tossed into the mix: Was itDaniel Andrews 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/daniel-andrews>, the Labor hero who defeated 
a first term conservative government in 2014 to lead the most progressive state 
in the country?

Wouldn’t it be astonishing if the issue that damaged Labor was related to the 
one that prime ministerMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> used as an excuse 
to call this double dissolution election – the conduct of some unions? The 
political purpose beyond that election trigger was the suggestion that Labor 
was beholden to unions to the detriment of the broader community – the precise 
allegation against Andrews.

And it would be the final irony if Shorten – the former union leader who has 
said that what he learned from that job was to be a conciliator, to get people 
into a room to solve problems and find consensus – was undermined by Andrews 
who so mucked up the handling of a union issue.

I am multi-tasking a little bit right now, just preparing to record our last 
podcast episode of the campaign. Incredible really, now I know we are nearly 
there. A couple of things about our podcast, Australian Politics Live. If 
you’ve not yet caught up withLenore Taylor and myself on the Ipod wireless, and 
subscribed,here’s our link on iTunes 
<https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/australian-politics-live/id1109943717>. 
You can listen in to our back catalogue if so inclined.

And good news for regular subscribers, I will push on with the podcast project 
after the election, because enough of you listen to it to make that worthwhile. 
Lenore and I are very grateful for your support.

The sum of the parts

Time for a quick stocktake before we press on.

Thursday in two dot points.

 * Malcolm Turnbull has given his closing address to the National Press Club 
which called for a new style of inclusive political leadership right before 
launching a beat down on his political opponents and reiterated all his major 
campaign themes. Before that he blitzed the airwaves and was told in one 
interview by the Melbourne radio hostNeil Mitchell that he needed to win 
handsomely on Saturday if he intended to remain prime minister, given, well, 
colleagues ..

 * Bill Shorten rose early and pushed out on Medicare and social services in 
Brisbane. Shorten declared Labor was united and ready to govern. But the Labor 
leader faced a bunch of questions about leadership post election – had he lost 
the support of the NSW right, which was now lining up to backAnthony Albanese?

Meanwhile, in Perth, Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, on Malcolm 
Turnbull.

This is a man who has dumped every conviction of his long life to get the 
leadership of the Liberal party – and you’ve got to ask yourself what is the 
point?

Complexity is for less charming people

Malcolm Turnbull finished today at the press club as he started at the 
beginning of this campaign, by sticking to the plan. The plan has been to be 
the man with the plan. That’s it. Just be the man with the plan, over and over, 
every day, whatever question that gets asked, the answer is I’m the man with 
the plan.

We saw this again today. Whatever the question, smile, look energetic, be 
charming, look prime ministerial, look confident, and be the man with the plan. 
Whenever people raise issues with the plan, point out flaws, point out 
complexities, point out alternatives, just stick to being the man with the 
plan. As I mentioned to you earlier today, this is turning on the head of a pin 
on a scale we’ve not seen in an election campaign before. Turnbull’s script is 
incredibly tight: he can be a glimmer of himself, but not too much lest that 
annoy all the people in the Coalition who don’t like him. Which is why you just 
keep talking about the plan. The plan is a slogan, a barrister’s brief, that’s 
what I said this morning, but it’s also a box to contain the prime minister and 
make him shine just brightly enough to convey the message theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> wants to convey.

Turnbull is incredibly confident now. He’s surging with the notion that he’s 
pulled this off, pulsing with the energy of the sheer audacity of the months 
since he moved againstTony Abbott last September. You can see it on his face: 
I’m going to pull this off.

For a person who isn’t Malcolm Turnbull, the terrible complexity of what lies 
behind his current beatific victory vision – the party that chafes relentlessly 
against him,Tony Abbott, mulish on the backbench, the roiling over the marriage 
equality plebiscite, the complexities of governing, the uncertainties of the 
world, the anxiety that victory on Saturday mightn’t be comprehensive enough to 
make anything easier, the fact that he’ll have to continue being patient when 
patience is a burden lesser mortals have to deal with ... all of that would be 
enough to send most of us to a diminished place wracked with self doubt and 
introspection.

But not Malcolm Turnbull.

If you are on your feet you are winning.

'I am making that prediction, but only time will tell'

Final question.

Q: You said: ‘I’ll be leading the government to the election in 2019 if I am 
returned as prime minister. You can note that down!’ How can you give that 
guarantee, given your own history in removing a first-term prime minister in 
2013?

Malcolm Turnbull flashes a smile.

I am making that prediction, but only time will tell. You can note that down.

The prime minister made his final pitch at the National Press Club with the 
confident delivery of a politician who thinks Saturday night is going to be a 
good night for theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>. Never mind that a radio 
host earlier in the day toldMalcolm Turnbull he’d better win comprehensively 
otherwise colleagues would have him for Sunday brunch. Details, details.

The opposition leader hit the hustings in Brisbane to declare that Labor was 
ready to govern.Bill Shorten shrugged off questions about post election 
scenarios that would see him lose the Labor leadership and said he would fight 
for every last vote until 6pm on Saturday night.

Greens leader Richard Di Natale finally delivered a straight answer about 
whether the Greens would negotiate with Labor on offshore processing in the 
event of a hung parliament. No, the Greens would not negotiate was the answer 
(which followed a suggestion yesterday that they might).

The end is in sight. We will be back with the live coverage from first light 
tomorrow. Until then, go with your God, and have a hot whiskey.
 
From the newswire service AAP.

Clive Palmer insists his announcement just days before the federal election 
that his collapsed Queensland Nickel refinery will reopen isn’t a political 
ploy to attract votes for his party. The Palmer United Party (PUP) leader, 
flanked by two Senate candidates and surrounded by party branding, revealed on 
Thursday the Yabulu refinery, near Townsville, would reopen on March 31 after 
regulatory and commercial requirements were met.

Palmer claimed he called the press conference to discuss Labor leadership 
rumblings, despite his media team earlier advising it was about the refinery 
reopening and a press release handed to journalists upon arrival indicating the 
same thing. “My speech was about politics, it wasn’t about the refinery,” he 
said.
Palmer insisted it was “purely a coincidence” that he made the announcement 
two days before Australians go to the polls. “It’s not of concern to me, 
because I’m not in politics - I’m in business. I’m more concerned about 
business,” he said.

Palmer, who isn’t recontesting his seat of Fairfax but will stay on as PUP 
chairman, has a history of outrageous political statements during election 
campaigns. In 2012 he claimed the Greens were conspiring with the CIA against 
Australia’s resources industry, only to later admit he didn’t believe those 
claims but said them to help the Liberal National Party get elected in 
Queensland. When that was put to him, Mr Palmer reiterated his announcement 
wasn’t “a political thing”. His party is running candidates only for the Senate 
and the lower house seat of Herbert, where the refinery is. Palmer said an 
increase in world nickel prices had made production feasible again.
 
From tricky to bloody difficult. I gather there’s been a significant Telstra 
outage in Victoria today, leaving various campaigns in the state without 
reliable internet access within 48 hours of polling day.

Obviously an internet outage is an equal opportunity problem impacting all 
campaigns, whatever their stripe:Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, Labor, Greens, others – 
but of course Melbourne is the home of Labor’s CHQ.

We could make an NBN joke but that might be unseemly.
 
I’ve said quite a few times that it’s seriously odd that we’ve seen no 
comprehensive industrial relations policy from theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> (or from Labor) in this 
campaign, given whole campaigns have been fought over IR in my reporting 
lifetime. The ACTU smells a rat.

ACTU secretary Dave Oliver.

Despite subjecting Australia to a record-length election campaign, Malcolm 
Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> has not 
offered any long term vision for job creation or industrial relations and has 
instead left the door open to further attacks on worker’s rights. This is a 
critical failure of policy and leadership and leaves a re-elected Liberal 
government with absolutely no mandate to implement the kind of anti-worker 
reforms that so many of their big business backers have been demanding, such as 
weakening unfair dismissal laws or the introduction of individual contracts. 
Malcolm Turnbull’s silence can only be interpreted as a sign he is not planning 
any significant changes to industrial relations should he win on Saturday – 
anything else would represent a massive breach of trust with the Australian 
people.
 
One of the problems with an election campaign is whenever talk turns to 
fragility in the economy the solution presented is always one of stability. The 
government has sought to present itself as stable (after all, it has nearly 
been a year since it has changed its leader and treasurer), while the ALP 
sought to present itself as the stable party, given its role during the global 
financial crisis.

And yet both sides were not all that eager to talk about what they would 
actually do were mere stability not enough to prevent an economic downturn.

The lack of eagerness to talk about what they would do is a consequence of the 
relentless criticism by the Liberal party and sections of the media of the 
stimulus measures put in place by Labor during the financial crisis, and also 
the Labor party’s complete inability to use the crisis to challenge the myth 
that a budget surplus is prime evidence of good economic management.

Last Friday, when he rushed with barely disguised joy to speak on ABC’s 7:30 
<http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2016/s4488832.htm> about the impact of the 
Brexit vote,Malcolm Turnbull dismissed once again the measures undertaken by 
the Rudd government during the global financial crisis.

He told Leigh Sales, that “I think what shepherded Australia through the GFC 
successfully was the Chinese stimulus and the large amount of cash that John 
Howard left in the bank”.

It requires an odd sense of logic to suggest that the stimulus measures here 
didn’t work, but that the Chinese ones did. It also is a tad odd to suggest the 
“large amount of cash” helped get us through the global financial crisis.

Having a surplus does not actually do anything to spur economic growth, it is 
what you spend the money on that does it. Arguing the surplus got us through 
the GFC but the stimulus didn’t is a bit like arguing that what brings a smile 
to your children’s faces on Christmas morning is not the presents you have 
bought them but the money that was in the bank you had saved in order to buy 
the presents.

Had the stimulus measures been poorly targeted, no amount of surplus would 
have helped. And the reality is the stimulus measures worked pretty much as 
they were expected to.

My colleague Gay Alcorn has written a piece this afternoon about the CFA 
dispute in Victoria,which you can read here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/30/will-the-most-progressive-state-in-australia-cost-labor-the-election>
. If you just want the quick version.

If Labor loses this election, especially by a narrow margin, there will be the 
usual post mortems and blame thrown around. Was it the national campaign 
office? Was it leaderBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten>? Was it the policy 
mix, or a weakness in the strategy to win crucial marginal seats?

What would have seemed unthinkable a few weeks ago may be another question 
tossed into the mix: Was itDaniel Andrews 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/daniel-andrews>, the Labor hero who defeated 
a first term conservative government in 2014 to lead the most progressive state 
in the country?

Wouldn’t it be astonishing if the issue that damaged Labor was related to the 
one that prime ministerMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> used as an excuse 
to call this double dissolution election – the conduct of some unions? The 
political purpose beyond that election trigger was the suggestion that Labor 
was beholden to unions to the detriment of the broader community – the precise 
allegation against Andrews.

And it would be the final irony if Shorten – the former union leader who has 
said that what he learned from that job was to be a conciliator, to get people 
into a room to solve problems and find consensus – was undermined by Andrews 
who so mucked up the handling of a union issue.
 
I am multi-tasking a little bit right now, just preparing to record our last 
podcast episode of the campaign. Incredible really, now I know we are nearly 
there. A couple of things about our podcast, Australian Politics Live. If 
you’ve not yet caught up withLenore Taylor and myself on the Ipod wireless, and 
subscribed,here’s our link on iTunes 
<https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/australian-politics-live/id1109943717>. 
You can listen in to our back catalogue if so inclined.

And good news for regular subscribers, I will push on with the podcast project 
after the election, because enough of you listen to it to make that worthwhile. 
Lenore and I are very grateful for your support.
 
Just in case you missed it.

Time for a quick stocktake before we press on.

Thursday in two dot points.

 * Malcolm Turnbull has given his closing address to the National Press Club 
which called for a new style of inclusive political leadership right before 
launching a beat down on his political opponents and reiterated all his major 
campaign themes. Before that he blitzed the airwaves and was told in one 
interview by the Melbourne radio hostNeil Mitchell that he needed to win 
handsomely on Saturday if he intended to remain prime minister, given, well, 
colleagues ..

 * Bill Shorten rose early and pushed out on Medicare and social services in 
Brisbane. Shorten declared Labor was united and ready to govern. But the Labor 
leader faced a bunch of questions about leadership post election – had he lost 
the support of the NSW right, which was now lining up to backAnthony Albanese?
 
Meanwhile, in Perth, Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, on Malcolm 
Turnbull.

This is a man who has dumped every conviction of his long life to get the 
leadership of the Liberal party – and you’ve got to ask yourself what is the 
point?
 
Malcolm Turnbull finished today at the press club as he started at the 
beginning of this campaign, by sticking to the plan. The plan has been to be 
the man with the plan. That’s it. Just be the man with the plan, over and over, 
every day, whatever question that gets asked, the answer is I’m the man with 
the plan.

We saw this again today. Whatever the question, smile, look energetic, be 
charming, look prime ministerial, look confident, and be the man with the plan. 
Whenever people raise issues with the plan, point out flaws, point out 
complexities, point out alternatives, just stick to being the man with the 
plan. As I mentioned to you earlier today, this is turning on the head of a pin 
on a scale we’ve not seen in an election campaign before. Turnbull’s script is 
incredibly tight: he can be a glimmer of himself, but not too much lest that 
annoy all the people in the Coalition who don’t like him. Which is why you just 
keep talking about the plan. The plan is a slogan, a barrister’s brief, that’s 
what I said this morning, but it’s also a box to contain the prime minister and 
make him shine just brightly enough to convey the message theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> wants to convey.

Turnbull is incredibly confident now. He’s surging with the notion that he’s 
pulled this off, pulsing with the energy of the sheer audacity of the months 
since he moved againstTony Abbott last September. You can see it on his face: 
I’m going to pull this off.

For a person who isn’t Malcolm Turnbull, the terrible complexity of what lies 
behind his current beatific victory vision – the party that chafes relentlessly 
against him,Tony Abbott, mulish on the backbench, the roiling over the marriage 
equality plebiscite, the complexities of governing, the uncertainties of the 
world, the anxiety that victory on Saturday mightn’t be comprehensive enough to 
make anything easier, the fact that he’ll have to continue being patient when 
patience is a burden lesser mortals have to deal with ... all of that would be 
enough to send most of us to a diminished place wracked with self doubt and 
introspection.

But not Malcolm Turnbull.

If you are on your feet you are winning.

 
That’s over and out at the press club now. I’ll be back very shortly with a 
few thoughts on that outing.

Final question.

Q: You said: ‘I’ll be leading the government to the election in 2019 if I am 
returned as prime minister. You can note that down!’ How can you give that 
guarantee, given your own history in removing a first-term prime minister in 
2013?

Malcolm Turnbull flashes a smile.

I am making that prediction, but only time will tell. You can note that down.
