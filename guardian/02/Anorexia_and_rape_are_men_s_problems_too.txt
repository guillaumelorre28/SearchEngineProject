It is simply untrue to say, “about 107,100 cases concerning violence against 
women and girls were prosecuted over the [past] 12 months”(Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/25/violence-against-woman-convictions-record-number-crown-prosecution-service>
, 25 June). Responsibility for this error, however, lies not with your staff 
but with the Crown Prosecution Service andits report 
<http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/equality/vaw/>, misleadingly entitled 
Violence Against Women and Girls, Crime Report 2014-15. Despite the title, this 
analysis included more than 13,000 male victims of crimes including rape, 
sexual assault, child abuse and domestic violence. Many will have been gay or 
transgender, many will have had their children or dependents affected. 
Designating them as victims of crimes “against women and girls” not only 
misleads the public about the complex and diverse dynamics of abuse but also 
serves to conceal and marginalise the experiences of all male survivors of 
intimate and sexual crimes while perpetuating the myth that “real men” don’t 
get raped, abused or become victims of domestic violence.

Victims of intimate violence face significant psychological barriers to 
reporting these events. Some fear they will not be believed, or even that they 
may be cast as the perpetrator. Those who find the courage to report their 
abuse to the authorities often say they are motivated less by the need for 
justice or revenge but for validation that what happened to them was real and 
was wrong. Many men tell us that the experience of intimate violation has left 
them feeling like “less than a man”, making interaction with authorities even 
more complex and challenging. For those authorities to publicly disregard this 
and erase the experiences of one in six of all victims is unjust and a cruel 
betrayal of their bravery.

We fully support drives to eliminate intimate and sexual violence and 
understand that focusing on female victims is central to this. It is also 
essential that we retain due consideration for male victims of these crimes. We 
call on the director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, and all public 
bodies to affirm their commitment to addressing and eliminating intimate 
violence against human beings of any gender and to take care not to compromise 
the dignity and public understanding of any survivors.

Eating disorders are equal opportunity illnesses, developing regardless of 
age, ethnicity, social class or gender
John Evans 
• Having suffered from an eating disorder since 1998, I have been hugely 
encouraged by the Guardian’s recent coverage (Eating disorders patients’ lives 
at risk due to long waits for NHS treatment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/14/eating-disorders-long-waits-nhs-treatment-lives-risk>
, 15 June;NHS trial ‘transforms lives’ of young anorexia and bulimia sufferers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/21/eating-disorders-nhs-trial-anorexia-bulemia>
, 22 June). As a man with anorexia nervosa, however, I was disappointed to see 
no reference whatsoever to the fact that these are illnesses that affect both 
sexes equally, if not in numerical terms, certainly in the degree of pain they 
cause to the sufferers and those close to them.

I do not deny that those diagnosed are often girls and young women, but by 
failing to acknowledge the growing incidence among men and boys, your 
correspondents are doing little to combat the myths about this supposedly 
“female illness” that do so much to prevent men from coming forward and getting 
help. Another article (Are more men getting eating disorders? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/18/are-more-men-getting-eating-disorders>
, 18 January) reported a 27% rise in diagnoses in men since 2000. Eating 
disorders are equal opportunity illnesses, developing regardless of age, 
ethnicity, social class or gender, and while any coverage helps to break 
through the silence that these pernicious illnesses thrive on, the pain they 
bring in their wake is similarly indiscriminate.
