When is an emergency a full-blown medical emergency? Or when is it something 
you can safely treat at home with help from healthcare services outside the 
hospital?

A&E is a difficult place for patients and staff. Attendances are higher than 
ever, waiting times are long and the system is creaking. It’s where your life 
can be saved or you can be stabilised if very unwell, but for less serious 
situations there are alternatives. So when should you come into A&E?

Sometimes the need is obvious, when someone is unresponsive unconscious or 
having a seizure not known to be epileptic. Left-sided chest pain that might be 
a heart attack should also be cause for a visit to A&E, as should facial, arm 
or leg weakness suspected as a stroke.


But what about the other stuff that’s not so clear-cut? Here are five other 
reasons for adults to come in.

1. Difficulty in breathing

Has your normal breathing pattern changed even though you have not done 
anything energetic such as going for a run or chasing a bus? What’s your 
respiratory rate, the number of breaths per minute? Between 12 and 20 is 
normal. When you are unwell it increases.

Are you gasping for breath? Is it difficult to complete sentences? For asthma 
or emphysema sufferers is there a wheeze or a persistent cough? Have you taken 
your normal inhalers and are still short of breath? Do you have any associated 
chest pain with the shortness of breath? Go to A&E.

2. Allergic reaction

These vary in severity. People can develop allergies later in life, not 
realising they could be potentially life-threatening. Many things cause 
allergic reactions, such as ibuprofen, antibiotics, aspirin, plasters and 
peanuts.

Have you developed a rash, a racing heart maybe and a feeling of impending 
doom? Those that get it agree with that description. This is when your allergic 
reaction could be a life-threatening anaphylaxis. Go to A&E immediately.

If you start to feel an itch in your throat and your tongue feels bigger than 
usual, your airway may be threatened. Call 999. Take some antihistamines 
immediately. Keep some close by for moments such as this.


3. Diarrhoea and vomiting

It’s horrible and can make you feel like death. Call your GP first. He or she 
will want to know how long you’ve been vomiting and how frequently. Is there 
any pain? Any diarrhoea?

If each time you try to take in any fluid it comes straight back up, you might 
need to go in for some rehydration. But if you persist with pushing small 
regular sips it does work. So try. It should pass in a day or two. Avoid 
dehydration.

Do you have any abdominal pain? One thing we worry about is appendicitis. If 
you have not had you appendix out and the pain is way down in your right side, 
come in.

Children complain often of tummy ache. They pick up all sorts, often 
literally, and into the mouth it goes. Hence the poorly tummy. The key thing 
again is hydration. Keep an eye on how often they are passing urine. How many 
times have you changed their nappy? Is it dry and for how long? Can you get 
even a teaspoon of fluid in regularly? Don’t worry about the milk or the feed. 
Water is key.


They may not be up for playing and engaging with you. Monitor how long they’ve 
been like this. If it’s more than a day and they have not taken any fluids go 
to A&E.

If your child has shivery fevers and you measure a high temperature, don’t 
wrap them in more blankets. They need to be cooled. Take off socks, hats and 
woolly jumpers. A light sheet is fine. Strip them to their nappy and give them 
paracetamol according to their age.

4. Head injury

Concussion occurs as a consequence of a bang to the head - but essentially 
it’s from when the brain suffers trauma. The brain sits in a fluid-filled bony 
cavity. Anything that causes it to rattle around in there can cause a brain 
injury. If you suddenly decelerate and your body jolts forward, like in a car, 
your brain could bang against the inside of your skull.


You need to monitor a head injury for at least 48 hours. If there is any 
concern about consciousness levels, vomiting more than twice with a worsening 
headache, confusion or memory loss, go to A&E.

 Long flights are a risk factor when it comes to deep vein thrombosis. 
Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA 
The thing we worry about here is a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot. 
Who gets DVTs? People who have been sedentary. That’s why we ask about long 
flights. Have you been unwell in bed for awhile? Do you have cancer? Are you on 
the contraceptive pill? Are you pregnant? These are risk factors for DVTs.


Your calf might feel tight and sore. Check to see if one is bigger than the 
other. Is it red and hot to touch? Go in.

If the DVT dislodges and travels up to your lungs it becomes a pulmonary 
embolism and can be life-threatening.
