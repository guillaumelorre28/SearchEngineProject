East Kent hospitals university foundation trust is leading a partnership that 
will see four trusts buy picture and archiving software from one supplier.

The group has published a tender, worth Â£50m, for picture archiving and 
communications systems (Pacs), radiology information systems (Ris) and vendor 
neutral archiving software, including related hardware and managed services. 
The chosen supplier will also be expected to supply and host domain-based 
systems required for data sharing.

East Kent is procuring the software on behalf of itself and three other 
trusts: Dartford and Gravesham, Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells, and Medway 
foundation trust.

According to notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, the four 
trusts have established the Kent and Medway Pacs Ris replacement programme to 
deliver a "collaborative and integrated solution". The KentHealth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/health> Informations 
Service is helping the trusts with the procurement.

The notice tells suppliers that a number of the four trusts will require an 
image and archive solution which is locally hosted by the trust, whereas others 
may require it to be provided as a managed service.

"The awarding authority reserves the right to remove trusts participating in 
the procurement at any point during the procurement process prior to contract," 
adds the notice.
