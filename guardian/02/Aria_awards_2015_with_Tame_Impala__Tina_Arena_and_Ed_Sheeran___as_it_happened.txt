Courtney Barnett might have “stolen” the Triple J award from Tame Impala 
(according to disgruntled Impala fans), but the band takes the top Aria award – 
their third of the night.

“You’re all sick of seeing us, sorry, I’ll make this quick,” says local genius 
Kevin Parker as he takes to the stage.

He thanks, among other people, his girlfriend Soph for telling him “when songs 
are cool and when songs need some work”.

Guitarist and vocalist Cam Avery says “I think I’ve said enough”, then 
reassesses and adds, “Long live the Fremantle football club. Next year is our 
year.”

It’s nice to be reminded that Tame Impala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tame-impala> is more than just Kevin Parker.

“Thanks for having us, and everyone had a great night,” says Avery. “Let’s get 
crunk.”

And with that, we’re going to get crunk at the after party. These were the 
biggest winners of the night, you can also check outour full list of winners

Conrad Sewell sings a Kygo’s Firestone 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUUjliDBAmk> and Start Again 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-OqF9qagNk> medley, which is quite good, but 
reiterates my earlier point that with the exception of theVeronicas-Mauboy-Arena
 collaboration, all the performances have been by blokes – mainly white ones.


In the second half of the performance, images of the Eiffel Tower appear on 
the projectors. Presumably it’s acknowledging the recent Paris attacks, but 
without any context or explanation, it’s a bit jarring.

One Direction best international artist

Elle Hunt

The nominees for best international artist are a fairly grim assessment of the 
state of modern music:Calvin Harris, Ed Sheeran 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran>, Foo Fighters, James Day, Mark 
Ronson, Meghan Trainor, One Directionand Taylor Swift. You would not know, from 
this array, that there were people of any ethnicity other than white making 
popular music, but that tends to be par for the course for awards shows.


That said, tonight’s Arias have seemed particularly whitebread. I’ve struggled 
to tell the male singer-songwriters who have performed apart from one another, 
and the presenters and video bits have been by and large banal.

The truly interesting, challenging appearances have been in the media room, 
fromTina Arena and Matt Okine and even Alexander Gow, who spoke a bit like he 
was on some strong painkillers but also in a way I hadn’t heard before.

One Direction win best international act for the fourth consecutive year.

Even Harry Styles, in a wooden video cross-flanked by his three stony-faced 
colleagues, seems a bit incredulous at that statistic.

And I like One Direction.

5 Seconds of Summer win best Australian live act

Elle Hunt

5SOS has been named the best Australian live act. They appear in a video 
message in front of two Australian flags and next toBenji and Joel Madden, for 
some reason. It is gratifying to see the good men ofGood Charlotte still dress 
exactly as they did in their music videos in the late 2000s.


5SOS talk about performing at the Annandale Hotel in Sydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> back when they were 
starting out. The journalist behind me says, rather loudly, that he thinks this 
story is entirely made up.

Not a bad way to end the year when it started like so:
Michael Clifford (@Michael5SOS) 
Won the NME worst band award. I'm so damn happy right now. thx to everyone who 
voted 😍😍#dreamscomingtrue

Vance Joy wins best male artist

Elle Hunt

Vance Joy beats #1 Dads, Daniel Johns, Guy Sebastian and Jarryd James for best 
male artist. “Geez, I’m shaking,” he says, thanking all his band mates and 
management team. “Thanks to everybody who listens to Australian music.”

In the media room he talks about feeling trepidation before opening for Taylor 
Swift on her North American tour (the Australian leg begins on Saturday), and 
what he learned from her. MeetingJulia Roberts at one of her shows was an 
unexpected highlight, he says.

I’m more interested to learn that he’s apparently at the level of fame where a 
hotel once embroidered his name on to a pillow.

Tame Impala, all five of them, pile on to the sofa for a chat about their 
success tonight. Along withCourtney Barnett, they’ve been the big winners, to 
an extent that seems to have surprised even them.Cam Avery expresses regret that
the Preatures – who were sitting next to them – didn’t win an award because 
they would have “brought steez to the ceremony”.

Another member of Tame Impala <https://www.theguardian.com/music/tame-impala> 
suggests that he should have “Kanye’d himself”, referring to Kanye’s infamous 
interception of Taylor Swift at the VMAs however many moons ago that was.

Courtney Barnett wins best female artist

Rove MacManus presents Courtney Barnett with the award for the best female 
artist.

“I’m holding your award, but what would you like to say?” MacManus says.

“Don’t drop it,” she jokes.

Her speech from London in the small hours after she’s finished a gig, is 
charming. She thanks people for supporting her music in a way that’s no less 
sincere for its matter-of-factness, she thanks her cat Bubbles, she thanks her 
girlfriend. As much as I don’t like Ed Sheeran as a public personality, I like
Courtney Barnett <https://www.theguardian.com/music/courtney-barnett>.

With a tip of the hat to the rest of the nominees, she says “the world needs 
art and music so thank you for supporting and being a part of it”.

For more on the star of the night, read Dorian Lynskey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dorianlynskey>’s interview with Barnett in 
the Guardian from March this year:

else remembers those hedonistic Bang Gang parties in Sydney’s Kings Cross?), 
and who sadly died in a traffic accident.

No, the Arias don’t air all the awards presented in the show (otherwise it 
would go for five, painful hours). But it’s a shame they chose not to airMatt 
Okine’s winning speech for best comedy release, in which he uncomfortably (for 
the Arias and industry bigwigs, anyway) pointed out the lack of women among the 
nominees.

Tame Impala win best rock album

Elle Hunt

Kevin Parker and co pick up their second Aria of the night. Parker is 
genuinely surprised this award wasn’t given toCourtney Barnett.

Meanwhile James Blunt is in fine form, grinning like a Cheshire cat, 
pronouncing every word very loudly and pointing the air furiously. He describes
Ed Sheeran as “the ginger ninja, the Pom with the big shlong” before giving him 
the new Aria diamond award, acknowledging the shiz ton of records he has sold 
in Australia.

Sheeran says he’s aware the award was created to lure him to the event, and I 
am not sure if he is joking.

In his speech, Sheeran says a bunch of – my take – lacklustre things, like on 
his music selling in Australia: “I barely have to do any promo here and it goes 
well” and the “weird interviews” Australian radio stations conduct: “every time 
I do a phoner, I am always scared to do it”.

He also started thanking people on other people’s behalves. (The best bit was 
when he said “happy wife, happy life” (quoting someone else). Who will Sheeran 
take as a wife?)

The one person he did not thank was Gabrielle Jackson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gabrielle-jackson>, Guardian Australia’s 
comment editor, who saw him perform at the Old Queen’s Head in Islington in 
“about 2009”. She told me that she went up after the show to buy a CD, but they 
were sold out, and to tell him that he was “so frat” and that he was “gonna be 
huge”. She was unable to tell me what she meant by “frat”.

 Kylie Minogue embraces Tina Arena. Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images 
Tina Arena and Kylie Minogue <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kylieminogue> 
are met with applause as they enter the media room for a photo opp. Kylie is 
set upon by media and photographers, then whisked away as Arena is directed to 
the couch to talk some more.

She notes that Ed Sheeran <https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran> is 
still performing on the television broadcast. “We were doing the red carpet, 
and then all of a sudden there’s zzz, like a swarm of bees, and it was him,” 
she says. “He attracts an enormous amount of attention for a little man.”

Arena speaks eloquently and stridently about being a “precocious” child, the 
Paris attacks, the pressures and pitfalls of the entertainment industry for 
older women. Being politically correct has only got us so far, she says, when 
we all think in different ways. She is an articulate and thoughtful and 
uncompromising interviewee.

Veronica Mauboy, Kylie Minogue and the Veronicas join her in the media room 
for a photo opp. I am avoiding eye contact with the Veronicas because they will 
be able to tell that I remain loyal to 4ever and by extension Max Martin.

Courtney Barnett might have “stolen” the Triple J award from Tame Impala 
(according to disgruntled Impala fans), but the band takes the top Aria award – 
their third of the night.

“You’re all sick of seeing us, sorry, I’ll make this quick,” says local genius 
Kevin Parker as he takes to the stage.

He thanks, among other people, his girlfriend Soph for telling him “when songs 
are cool and when songs need some work”.

Guitarist and vocalist Cam Avery says “I think I’ve said enough”, then 
reassesses and adds, “Long live the Fremantle football club. Next year is our 
year.”

It’s nice to be reminded that Tame Impala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tame-impala> is more than just Kevin Parker.

“Thanks for having us, and everyone had a great night,” says Avery. “Let’s get 
crunk.”

And with that, we’re going to get crunk at the after party. These were the 
biggest winners of the night, you can also check outour full list of winners

Conrad Sewell sings a Kygo’s Firestone 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUUjliDBAmk> and Start Again 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-OqF9qagNk> medley, which is quite good, but 
reiterates my earlier point that with the exception of theVeronicas-Mauboy-Arena
 collaboration, all the performances have been by blokes – mainly white ones.


In the second half of the performance, images of the Eiffel Tower appear on 
the projectors. Presumably it’s acknowledging the recent Paris attacks, but 
without any context or explanation, it’s a bit jarring.

The nominees for best international artist are a fairly grim assessment of the 
state of modern music:Calvin Harris, Ed Sheeran 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran>, Foo Fighters, James Day, Mark 
Ronson, Meghan Trainor, One Directionand Taylor Swift. You would not know, from 
this array, that there were people of any ethnicity other than white making 
popular music, but that tends to be par for the course for awards shows.


That said, tonight’s Arias have seemed particularly whitebread. I’ve struggled 
to tell the male singer-songwriters who have performed apart from one another, 
and the presenters and video bits have been by and large banal.

The truly interesting, challenging appearances have been in the media room, 
fromTina Arena and Matt Okine and even Alexander Gow, who spoke a bit like he 
was on some strong painkillers but also in a way I hadn’t heard before.

One Direction win best international act for the fourth consecutive year.

Even Harry Styles, in a wooden video cross-flanked by his three stony-faced 
colleagues, seems a bit incredulous at that statistic.

And I like One Direction.

5SOS has been named the best Australian live act. They appear in a video 
message in front of two Australian flags and next toBenji and Joel Madden, for 
some reason. It is gratifying to see the good men ofGood Charlotte still dress 
exactly as they did in their music videos in the late 2000s.


5SOS talk about performing at the Annandale Hotel in Sydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> back when they were 
starting out. The journalist behind me says, rather loudly, that he thinks this 
story is entirely made up.

Not a bad way to end the year when it started like so:

Vance Joy beats #1 Dads, Daniel Johns, Guy Sebastian and Jarryd James for best 
male artist. “Geez, I’m shaking,” he says, thanking all his band mates and 
management team. “Thanks to everybody who listens to Australian music.”

In the media room he talks about feeling trepidation before opening for Taylor 
Swift on her North American tour (the Australian leg begins on Saturday), and 
what he learned from her. MeetingJulia Roberts at one of her shows was an 
unexpected highlight, he says.

I’m more interested to learn that he’s apparently at the level of fame where a 
hotel once embroidered his name on to a pillow.

Tame Impala, all five of them, pile on to the sofa for a chat about their 
success tonight. Along withCourtney Barnett, they’ve been the big winners, to 
an extent that seems to have surprised even them.Cam Avery expresses regret that
the Preatures – who were sitting next to them – didn’t win an award because 
they would have “brought steez to the ceremony”.

Another member of Tame Impala <https://www.theguardian.com/music/tame-impala> 
suggests that he should have “Kanye’d himself”, referring to Kanye’s infamous 
interception of Taylor Swift at the VMAs however many moons ago that was.

Rove MacManus presents Courtney Barnett with the award for the best female 
artist.

“I’m holding your award, but what would you like to say?” MacManus says.

“Don’t drop it,” she jokes.

Her speech from London in the small hours after she’s finished a gig, is 
charming. She thanks people for supporting her music in a way that’s no less 
sincere for its matter-of-factness, she thanks her cat Bubbles, she thanks her 
girlfriend. As much as I don’t like Ed Sheeran as a public personality, I like
Courtney Barnett <https://www.theguardian.com/music/courtney-barnett>.

With a tip of the hat to the rest of the nominees, she says “the world needs 
art and music so thank you for supporting and being a part of it”.

For more on the star of the night, read Dorian Lynskey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dorianlynskey>’s interview with Barnett in 
the Guardian from March this year:

and who sadly died in a traffic accident.

No, the Arias don’t air all the awards presented in the show (otherwise it 
would go for five, painful hours). But it’s a shame they chose not to airMatt 
Okine’s winning speech for best comedy release, in which he uncomfortably (for 
the Arias and industry bigwigs, anyway) pointed out the lack of women among the 
nominees.

Kevin Parker and co pick up their second Aria of the night. Parker is 
genuinely surprised this award wasn’t given toCourtney Barnett.

Meanwhile James Blunt is in fine form, grinning like a Cheshire cat, 
pronouncing every word very loudly and pointing the air furiously. He describes
Ed Sheeran as “the ginger ninja, the Pom with the big shlong” before giving him 
the new Aria diamond award, acknowledging the shiz ton of records he has sold 
in Australia.

Sheeran says he’s aware the award was created to lure him to the event, and I 
am not sure if he is joking.

In his speech, Sheeran says a bunch of – my take – lacklustre things, like on 
his music selling in Australia: “I barely have to do any promo here and it goes 
well” and the “weird interviews” Australian radio stations conduct: “every time 
I do a phoner, I am always scared to do it”.

He also started thanking people on other people’s behalves. (The best bit was 
when he said “happy wife, happy life” (quoting someone else). Who will Sheeran 
take as a wife?)

The one person he did not thank was Gabrielle Jackson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gabrielle-jackson>, Guardian Australia’s 
comment editor, who saw him perform at the Old Queen’s Head in Islington in 
“about 2009”. She told me that she went up after the show to buy a CD, but they 
were sold out, and to tell him that he was “so frat” and that he was “gonna be 
huge”. She was unable to tell me what she meant by “frat”.

Tina Arena and Kylie Minogue <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kylieminogue> 
are met with applause as they enter the media room for a photo opp. Kylie is 
set upon by media and photographers, then whisked away as Arena is directed to 
the couch to talk some more.

She notes that Ed Sheeran <https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran> is 
still performing on the television broadcast. “We were doing the red carpet, 
and then all of a sudden there’s zzz, like a swarm of bees, and it was him,” 
she says. “He attracts an enormous amount of attention for a little man.”

Arena speaks eloquently and stridently about being a “precocious” child, the 
Paris attacks, the pressures and pitfalls of the entertainment industry for 
older women. Being politically correct has only got us so far, she says, when 
we all think in different ways. She is an articulate and thoughtful and 
uncompromising interviewee.

Veronica Mauboy, Kylie Minogue and the Veronicas join her in the media room 
for a photo opp. I am avoiding eye contact with the Veronicas because they will 
be able to tell that I remain loyal to 4ever and by extension Max Martin.
