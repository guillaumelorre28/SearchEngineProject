So, in anticipation of this evening here's the full list of ingredients and a 
note of a couple of bits of equipment you'll need on hand to make lemon, sage 
and mascarpone chicken with Jerusalem extra virgin mash and robust greens, with 
tarte tatin to follow.

For anyone who's new to the game, this is how it works. A full list of 
ingredients is below, and you'll need an eager volunteer with computer 
operating skills (and a computer) within earshot of the cooker, or if you're a 
seasoned multi-tasker just a computer in the kitchen (keyboard protectors are 
available

). Be ready for action at 8pm, and if you've some device which will let you 
take pics as you progress, have it to hand as we'll be compiling the traditional
interweb gallery of everyone's efforts

. Even if you're not able to cook with us on the night (although quite what you 
could be doing that would be more important is nigh-on unimaginable) the live 
session will become a step-by-step recipe with timings once the dust has 
settled.
So firstly, the main course. Most clickalongers seem to cook in pairs, and for 
some reason it's always easier to double than halve, so these quantities will 
serve two. Don't forget to do a piece of chicken for each diner or you'll be 
fighting over the tarte tatin (which will serve 4-6), and we don't want that 
(unless you photograph the struggle and post the pictures to for all to see on 
theWoM Flickr group <http://www.flickr.com/groups/411729@N23/> or elsewhere). 
In the unlikely event that you don't snarf the entire tarte that night it makes 
for yummy leftovers.

There's always an elephant in the room when it comes to Jerusalem artichokes, 
and if you're the sort of person who cares overmuch about a couple of farts you 
can double the spud quantity, but in the opinion of this chef you'll be missing 
out. There'smore about this underrated tuber here

, including tips for minimising emissions.

Ingredients - main course

Serves 2. Double it for 4! 

2 free-range chicken supremes (ie breast with wing attached) with skin on – 
the skin is essential but you don't necessarily need the little bone – mine 
weigh 250g each
2 lemons, zested
1 clove of garlic, peeled
A nugget of Parmesan, grated
A knob of butter
12 leaves of sage, chopped
3 tablespoons mascarpone
300g Jerusalem artichokes
300g waxy spuds, I'm using Cyprus
1 tablespoon normal olive oil
150g seasonal greens of your choice: purple sprouting broccoli, savoy, 
brussels sprouts / tops, cavalo nero, romanesco, Swiss chard, kale, spring 
greens etc.
A few good glugs (around 5 tablespoons) of best extra virgin olive oil
S&P

For the vegetarians who posted asking about a meat-free menu, I've thought 
hard about it and there isn't really anything that can be cooked in the same 
time as the chicken and which will also work properly with the flavours of the 
mash and greens. However, a dish which will go perfectly is ratatouille, so I 
suggest the vegetarian contingent knock one up in advance - it's one of those 
dishes which is always nicer the next day, in any case. Then you can have it 
with the mash and greens, and tarte tatin to follow. When we have the summer 
clickalong in a few months' time the whole country be awash with wonderful 
fresh vegetables, and the menu will be wholly veggie.

For the tarte tatin

Serves 4-6

200g caster sugar
100g butter, salted
4 to 5 apples (eating not cooking) about 700g - I'm using russets and braeburns
Flour for dusting the pastry
250g puff pastry
Dairy of your choice to accompany, ie cream or ice-cream

Equipment

Masher / moulis / ricer
2 x ovenproof frying pans (both roughly 25cm diameter, and hopefully not with 
paper-thin bottoms)
2 saucepans
Rolling pin
Peeler
Zester
Whisk

Get ye to the shops and on the phone to your friends who own a second 
ovenproof frying pan and are a loose end this evening and we'll reconvene for 
an 8pm start. Usual clickalong rules apply - after a flurry of frantic activity 
we'll all be sitting down to a fantastic meal an hour later.
