With US markets hitting new peaks, the FTSE 100 started the week on a positive 
note.

The index finished 30.02 points higher at 6723.46, as investors continued to 
be buoyed by the prospect of the US Federal Reserve maintaining its economic 
stimulus programme. There was also optimism that China's recently announced 
economic reforms could support global growth.

Among the risers J. Sainsbury added 2.5p to 411.5p as Shore Capital raised its 
recommendation from hold to buy. This is the first time the broker has put 
Sainsbury on its buy list for four years. Analysts Darren Shirley and Clive 
Black said:
 Sainsbury's interim results were ahead of Shore Capital and market 
expectations, driven by a stronger-than-expected margin performance. After a 
meeting with finance director John Rogers, we upgrade our pretax profit 
forecast by around 1% to £807m, earnings per share of 33.2p, year-on-year 
growth of 9.5%.

Sainsbury is undoubtedly the most robust of the mainstream UK grocers, 
outperforming at the revenue and margin lines. Whilst the broader grocery 
market remains challenging, with volumes under pressure and likely to remain so 
for the foreseeable future, we believe such concerns are already well baked 
into expectations for Sainsbury, with the potential for any profit surprise on 
the up rather than downside.

In the current elevated equity market, we believe a 2014 PE of 12.3 times, and 
enterprise value/EBITDA multiple of 7.4 times, represents good value for a 
stock expected to deliver around 14% total shareholder return, driven by 9.5% 
earnings per share growth and a 4.4% dividend yield (1.9 times covered), and so 
we upgrade our recommendation to buy. 
Aberdeen Asset Management was the best performer in the FTSE 100, up 62.9p or 
nearly 15% to 489.7p after its long awaited purchase of fund management group 
Scottish Widows fromLloyds Banking Group, 0.79p better at 76.17p.

Aberdeen is issuing 132m new shares to Lloyds to pay an initial £560m, giving 
the banking group a 9.9% stake in the company. It will also pay another £100m 
in cash depending on performance.

Elsewhere Royal Bank of Scotland rose 3.3p to 333.3p after saying it was in 
talks to sell its retail investor products and equity derivatives business.

British Airways owner International Airlines Group dipped 0.2p to 362p despite 
Nomura issuing a buy note and raising its price target from 335p to 380p 
following the airline's investor day on Friday.

A profit warning from Petrofac saw the energy services group slump nearly 17%, 
down 239p to £12.

The company said it expected net income to be flat or modestly ahead next 
year, reflecting delays at a number of contracts including the Upper Zakum 
project in Abu Dhabi and the Berantai project in Malaysia. The company was also 
more cautious on its 2015 targets.

It said it was still aiming to double its 2010 net income of $431m by 2015, 
but this now depended on the timing of various contracts.

Outsourcing group Capita lost 6p to 977p after the surprise news that its 
chief executive is to quit after 26 years. Paul Pindar, who joined from 3i, 
will leave next year to go back to working in private equity. He will be 
replaced by deputy chief executive Andy Parker.

Among the mid-caps, Aveva, whose software is used to design power plants, 
shipping and energy facilities, dropped 201p to £23.65, the worst performer in 
the FTSE 250, following a disappointing update. The headline figures showed an 
11% increase in half year revenues to £108.5m and a 6% rise in profits to 
£27.3m, but within that, its enterprise solutions division showed a slower than 
expected 5% revenue rise.

The company blamed a Latin American shipyard customer running into serious 
financial difficulties, and a major oil and gas group abandoning an information 
management project.Aveva <https://www.theguardian.com/business/avevagroup> 
added that the market was still evolving so sales cycles were hard to predict.

Finally Aim-listed China New Energy saw its shares nearly double, up 2.275p to 
4.75p. The company, which designs factories and develops technology to convert 
non traditional feed into fuel, unveiled contracts with two Hungarian 
businesses to build ethanol plants worth around £60m over the next four years. 
This follows a memorandum of understanding signed at the end of last month to 
develop a biorefinery in Nigeria.
