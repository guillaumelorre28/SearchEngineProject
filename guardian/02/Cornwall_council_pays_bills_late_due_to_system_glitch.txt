The introduction of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system at 
Cornwall council has led to a delay in payments to foster carers and suppliers.

Cornwall council, which signed a seven-year deal with Capgemini

 last April for an ERP system, confirmed that there had been "some issues" with 
people not receiving payments on time, and that it had brought in additional 
temporary staff to process the backlog of invoices that have built up.

"We are pleased to confirm that there are no longer any 'out of terms' 
payments outstanding to be paid by our accounts payable team and are confident 
that the issue is now under control," said a spokeswoman for the authority.

Liberal democrat councillors in Cornwall have accused the Tory-led authority 
of being "incompetent" for not being fully prepared for the switch over to the 
new system.

Jeremy Rowe, Liberal Democrat group leader, said: "This is yet another example 
of incompetent planning by the Conservative-led council. Afterthe waste fiasco

, you would have thought that the council had learned its lesson, but it 
appears not.

"Local businesses are going through a tough time with the state of the 
economy. The last thing they need is Cornwall council being late with their 
payments. And the delays to payments to foster carers are particularly 
inexcusable. We should be valuing people who care for vulnerable children, not 
leaving them out of pocket."

When it announced its new ERP deal last year, Cornwall said that it hoped the 
new system would save around Â£20m over the next five years. It also revealed 
that there was a possibility of sharing the technology with other public sector 
organisations in the area.

Michael Larner, senior analyst at public sector market intelligence firm 
Kable, believes that ambitions for developing a shared service platform for the 
project may have to be "put on the backburner".

"The project's future will be in jeopardy if the anticipated savings were 
based on other councils buying services from Cornwall," he said.

Cornwall's plans for shared services also include a "trading joint services 
venture" with a private firm,which it announced last year.

A spokesman for Capgemini said the firm did not wish to add any further 
comment.
