1 | Novel
Did You Ever Have a Family by Bill Clegg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/21/did-you-ever-have-family-bill-clegg-review>

I only recently bought a Kindle, and although I still prefer print copies of 
books, it enabled me to get this book the day it was published. I raced through 
it on various Italian beaches. The story follows the lives of characters who 
are involved in a devastating house fire that destroys June Reid’s home on the 
early morning of her daughter’s wedding. Her daughter and the others sleeping 
there all die. Like another book I hugely admired, Christos Tsiolkas’sThe Slap 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/08/the-slap-christos-tsiolkas-review>
, Clegg uses one event to anchor the story which is then narrated by a variety 
of characters who change with each chapter. It is sad and gripping and filled 
with insights into the human condition. Clegg is an American literary agent who 
had previously written two memoirs detailing his hardcore drug habit and 
recovery, but this is his first novel and it’s enviously readable and clever.

2 | Album
Just a Stone’s Throw Away by Valerie Carter 
<https://player.spotify.com/album/6yEeD13aKI5uEiDVcbVZaI>

I first heard this album in the 70s – I still have that vinyl version at home 
although it is very scratched. One of my favourite activities is going on an 
iTunes treasure hunt, discovering music I don’t know, and recently the cover of 
this flashed up on a “If you like this, try this” basis. Now I’ve downloaded 
it, I’ve been reminded of how great the album is. I place her in the canon of 
female singers of that period such as Carly Simon and Linda Ronstadt, although 
she didn’t write all her own stuff. Her version of Ooh Child is probably the 
most famous track, but practically all of the eight tracks are gorgeous. The 
title song has elements of gospel in it and the beautifulCowboy Angel 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DUda-rwohw> will appeal to anyone who is a 
little bit in love with the romance of the west.

3 | Cookery book
30 Ingredients by Sally Clarke 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/329113/>

The combination of a book of recipes from restaurateur Sally Clarke 
<http://www.sallyclarke.com/> and photographs by Tessa Traeger strikes me as 
irresistible. In Clarke’s eponymous Kensington restaurant there used to be only 
one menu with no choice. As a young woman eating there occasionally as a treat 
in its early days, I was always a little nervous of Sally, who had no truck 
with any queries over what was being served. Now there is a choice, but the 
style of food remains the same. The recipes in the book follow a similar ethos 
to the restaurant, of cooking relatively few good, basic ingredients (sage and 
anchovy sandwich fritters, peach and raspberry galette) with an emphasis on 
vegetables (although it’s not vegetarian). Accompanying the recipes are the 
photographs by Tessa, who used to create a beautiful photograph every month for
Vogue’s cookery pages. Her pictures sometimes show you the finished dish, but 
are occasionally clean and inspirational still lifes of the ingredients at the 
heart of the book.

4 | TV
The Trials of Jimmy Rose 
<https://www.itv.com/itvplayer/the-trials-of-jimmy-rose/series-1/episode-3>

I like to watch television completely on my own in multi-episode binges. I 
hate the idea of making a date with a programme at a certain time every week – 
it feels like I’m trapped – so I’ve never subscribed to that sit-down with the 
Sunday evening series. Instead I record or buy them to watch in my own time. I 
watched the first of the three-partThe Trials of Jimmy Rose and I’m looking 
forward to catching up on the other two. I’ve always liked an underworld saga 
and I loveRay Winstone <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ray-winstone>, so this 
tale of the travails of an old criminal newly released from jail and 
discovering what has happened to his life is pretty irresistible for me. Amanda 
Redman is excellent as the wife who’s seen it all before and the set and 
costume detail is first class.
 Celia, 1972 by David Hockney. 
5 | Exhibition
David Hockney, Early Drawings at Offer Waterman 
<http://www.waterman.co.uk/exhibitions/36/overview/>

This is the opening exhibition at the new Offer Waterman gallery, transplanted 
from the bottom of the King’s Road into the heart of Mayfair, directly opposite 
Sotheby’s. I have always adored this period of Hockney’s work – the late 60s 
and early 70s. Here you find all his most famous iconography –Celia Birtwell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/28/celia-birtwell-designer-space>
, tulips, chairs, cigarettes, and of course a swimming pool, although this is 
work from before he adopted Los Angeles as his home. As a collection, I prefer 
these portraits of his friends and colleagues – such as his art dealer John 
Kasmin and ex-lover Peter Schlesinger – which are primarily drawn in pen, ink 
and coloured pencil, to his later watercolour portraits. The catalogue is 
introduced by his recent biographer Christopher Simon Sykes.

6 | Building
Whitney Museum of American Art <http://whitney.org/>

I am hoping to visit this museum for the first time when I visit New York for 
fashion week. It’s situated right next to the Hudson River, which means you can 
enjoy the art, but also get fantastic river views and walk along theHigh Line 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/picture/2015/feb/19/world-view-ireland-answer-to-new-york-high-line>
 garden that runs above the streets. The current exhibition is the brilliantly 
titledAmerica Is Hard to See <http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/AmericaIsHardToSee>
 (a line from a Robert Frost poem) and shows only American work, all from the 
permanent collection. I gather that the Whitney has brought a new energy to the 
neighbourhood, and it’s been wonderful to see how new museums and galleries can 
regenerate areas or even whole cities. The new extension to Tate Modern will 
hopefully to do the same to Southwark when it is completed andDamien Hirst’s 
huge art gallery, which opens soon in Lambeth 
<http://www.damienhirst.com/news/2015/newport-street-gallery-release>, should 
bring a new vibrancy to the little-known streets around there.
