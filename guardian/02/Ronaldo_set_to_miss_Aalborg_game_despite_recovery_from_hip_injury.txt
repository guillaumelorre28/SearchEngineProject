Cristiano Ronaldo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ronaldo> seems certain 
to miss Manchester United's Champions League match against Aalborg tomorrow.

Ronaldo injured a hip in Saturday's win over Sunderland but, although he has 
been able to train, the Manchester United manager,Sir Alex Ferguson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sir-alex-ferguson>, feels it would be 
better to let the Ballon D'Or winner have further treatment ahead of Saturday's 
visit to Tottenham.

Michael Carrick is also out with what Ferguson suggested was a minor knock, 
although the England midfielder should also be fit to face his former club at 
White Hart Lane. Gary Neville and Ben Foster are set to start tomorrow, while 
Paul Scholes is expected to be on the bench. John O'Shea, who has been 
suffering from a hamstring injury, is also likely to be involved.

Carrick, Patrice Evra and the young striker Danny Welbeck did not train this 
morning.
