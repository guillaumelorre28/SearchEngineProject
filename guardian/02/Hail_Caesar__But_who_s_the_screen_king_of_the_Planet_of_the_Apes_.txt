This year's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-film> and 
1972's Conquest of the Planet of the Apes are arguably the two best Planet of 
the Apes films ever made. There are no spaceships or mutants. There are no 
long, drawn-out courtroom scenes. There's no James Franco. But there is Caesar. 
Less pious than Dr Zaius, less fidgety than Cornelius, less prone to blowing up 
entire planets than Charlton Heston, Caesar is the most important figure in the 
entire series. He's the ape who first wages war on the humans.

But which Caesar is better – the original Caesar played by Roddy McDowall in 
the 1970s, or the new Caesar played byAndy Serkis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/andy-serkis> today? We should probably put 
this to the test.

Best baby Caesar

In the new films, Caesar is found abandoned after his mother goes berserk and 
interrupts an important board meeting. Meanwhile, original Caesar was born at 
the end of Escape from the Planet of the Apes, the child of two 
super-intelligent chimps who were sent back from the future right before 
Charlton Heston murdered everyone. And, unlike the computer-generated new 
Caesar, he's an actual chimp. A real-life baby chimp. When it comes to 
species-destroying primate generals, nothing's cuter than a real-life baby 
chimp.
Winner: Original Caesar.

Most realistic adult Caesar
 Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes 
If you want to see how far technology has come since 1972, watch the Planet of 
the Apes films. In Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle for Planet of 
the Apes, Caesar is a bloke in a suit. Not a very good suit, either – by the 
fourth and fifth original films, the costume budget was so low that the monkey 
masks dimpled and crumpled whenever the actors talked. Meanwhile, new Caesar 
benefits from cutting-edge Weta technology and Andy Serkis's incredible skills 
as a performer. WatchDawn of the Planet of the Apes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-film> and you 
could very well be watching a real chimpanzee, albeit one who rides horses and 
talks and stuff.
Winner: New Caesar.

 Old Caesar: "Where there is fire, there is smoke. And in that smoke, from 
this day forward, my people will crouch and conspire and plot and plan for the 
inevitable day of man's downfall – the day when he finally and 
self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind. The day of the 
writing in the sky, when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble! When 
the sea is a dead sea, and the land is a wasteland out of which I will lead my 
people from their captivity! And we will build our own cities in which there 
will be no place for humans except to serve our ends! And we shall found our 
own armies, our own religion, our own dynasty! And that day is upon you … now!"
 New Caesar: "Apes together strong!"
Winner: Original Caesar.

Best human friend

Caesar's only friend in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes is Armando, a 
circus owner played by Ricardo Montalbán. Between Escape and Conquest, Armando 
raised Caesar. He taught him about empathy and love. He showed him how to blend 
in with other less intelligent apes. He even sacrificed his own life when 
Caesar accidentally blurted out "Lousy human bastards" at the police. 
Meanwhile, New Caesar's best friend is James Franco, who isn't as cool as 
Ricardo Montalbán because he never played Khan in Star Trek 2. No contest.
Winner: Original Caesar.

Best fashion sense

New Caesar has certainly managed to remain on-trend by daubing himself with 
some vaguely tribal-looking facepaint. Aside from that, however, he's entirely 
naked. Contrast that with Conquest-era Caesar, who strutted around in groovy 
leather jacket and delivered his rousing sermons in an era-appropriate militant 
jumpsuit, and there the winner is clear for all to see. And those sideburns! 
Who's cooler than Original Caesar? Nobody, that's who.
Winner: Original Caesar

The verdict

Original Caesar wins!

So there we have have it – Roddy McDowall's Caesar is the definitive article. 
He is the greatest ape. Andy Serkis might have more accurate posture, a tighter 
grip on what chimpanzees are actually capable of and a look that hasn't been 
modelled on a four-year-old boy's Halloween costume, but he simply doesn't have 
McDowall's panache. But what do you think? Have we picked the alpha male? Or is 
Andy Serkis the king of your jungle? Champion your favourite below.
