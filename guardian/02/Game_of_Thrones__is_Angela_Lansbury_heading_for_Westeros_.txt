Name: Angela Lansbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/angela-lansbury>.

Age: 90.

Appearance: World’s best grandma.

What, better than mine? By far.

How come? Is your grandma acknowledged as a lovely person with a record of 
being on the right side of every social argument since the 1940s?

Yes. Is she the granddaughter of the former Labour party leader George 
Lansbury? Did she getnominated for an Oscar for a film 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslight_(1944_film)> she made with Ingrid 
Bergman when she was 17?

I don’t know. She’d probably have mentioned it. Is she thought to be about to 
mark her ninth decade in showbusiness 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/game-of-thrones-season-7-angela-lansbury-reportedly-set-to-cameo-a7227896.html>
 with a cameo inGame of Thrones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones>?

I have to admit it’s unlikely. Game Lansbury! In truth, it wasn’t a fair 
match. She has had basicallythe best and longest career imaginable 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2014/jan/24/angela-lansbury-crime-drama>
, becoming a movie star, then a musical theatre star, then a television star, 
then a fun old lady.

Don’t I remember her from such films as National Velvet 
<http://gb.imdb.com/title/tt0037120/>, The Picture of Dorian Gray 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037988/>, Bedknobs and Broomsticks 
<http://mentalfloss.com/article/72445/13-magical-facts-about-bedknobs-and-broomsticks>
, The Manchurian Candidate andBeauty and the Beast 
<http://gb.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/>? You do. And don’t forget Blue Hawaii 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054692/> – she plays Elvis Presley’s mum.

I’ll try not to. So, now she’s going to be in Game of Thrones, you say? Well, 
so saysthe German newspaper Bild 
<http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/angela-lansbury/wird-mord-jetzt-doch-ihr-hobby-47602736.bild.html>
, yes. It claims to have heard a rumour that she’s in Northern Ireland filming 
two episodes of the seventh series.

Oh well, anyone can claim they’ve heard a rumour. Lansbury’s publicist hasn’t 
denied she’s doing it, nor has HBO, the maker of the show.

My grandma hasn’t denied it, either. Yes, but this is how they announce things 
on Game of Thrones. First a rumour gets out that a venerable British actor with 
US recognition is going to appear in the next series. Then everyone talks. Then
Ian McShane 
<http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/05/game-thrones-ian-mcshane-hound> or Jim 
Broadbent 
<http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/game-of-thrones-jim-broadbent-season-7-1201849149/>
 or whoever is confirmed.

Or my grandma. I think we’ve established that she lacks the US profile.

Sure. But she’s very tactful. Didn’t McShane give the plot away and then tell 
anyone who cared 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2016/mar/15/ian-mcshane-game-of-thrones-season-six-tits-and-dragons>
 to “get a fucking life. It’s only tits and dragons”?Yes. You don’t get that 
with Angela “Safe Hands” Lansbury.

Do pitch: “During a cruise holiday with friends, Jessica Fletcher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/feb/20/natalie-haynes-tv-detectives-jessica-fletcher>
 arrives on Westeros, where an extremely large number of unexplained murders 
have occurred.”

Don’t pitch: “Mordor, She Wrote.”
