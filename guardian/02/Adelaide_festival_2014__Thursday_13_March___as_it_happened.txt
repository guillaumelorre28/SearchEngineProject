Review: Rime of the Ancient Mariner

Alicia Canter for the Guardian 
Last night Jane Howard went to see Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a punk cabaret 
retelling of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem, in which snippets of Coleridge’s 
text are woven into a production with songs by The Tiger Lillies and visuals 
from Mark Holthusen.

It’s a nice idea – but less than the sum of its parts, concludes Jane, who has 
some issues with the design, which looks beautiful but effectively cuts of the 
performers from the audience, and with the Tiger Lillies’ repertoire. Youcan 
read her two-star review in full here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/mar/13/rime-of-the-ancient-mariner-the-tiger-lillies-review?view=desktop>
. Or you can catch an extract below.

The Tiger Lillies tell their story directly to the audience, sometimes as the 
mariner himself, sometimes as outsiders looking in on the tale. Slow piano 
plays under The Storm, a jaunty accordion features in Cabin Boys, a haunting 
theremin <http://www.thereminworld.com/> in Albatross 3. But over the 90 
minutes, the musical range begins to feel limited, with songs featuring the 
same rhythms and emotional beats as the songs that came before.

As they perform, The Tiger Lillies stand behind a scrim, in front of a screen 
onto which Mark Holthusen <http://www.markholthusen.com/#home>’s animated 
visuals are projected. This three-layered approach imitates an old toy theatre, 
with screens and props carefully flown in and out. At other times this tribute 
disappears and snow or fire appear to consume the stage and hide the band away.

Interview: Robert Lepage

The Canadian theatre-maker brings a new incarnation of his show Needles & 
Opium to the festival this weekend. Jana Perkovic caught up with him to discuss 
revisiting old vices, theatre as therapy, and being in competition with Netflix.
You can find the whole interview here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/mar/13/robert-lepage-my-work-is-a-therapeutic-process?view=desktop>
, or read an extract below.

Needles & Opium, the work Lepage is bringing to the Adelaide festival, is a 
reworking of one of his early shows, which cemented his reputation when it 
premiered in 1991. It connects the lives of Miles Davis and Jean Cocteau with a 
third, Lepage-like character, going through a break-up while in a hotel room in 
Paris. “It’s basically about dependence in many aspects: opium, alcohol, love. 
Addiction often tries to fill a hole. I’m playing with three characters who 
have experienced loss.”

He refers to the work as a ‘break-up story’. “If you’re going to do a show 
about somebody who dumped you, it’s much richer if you have three characters 
dealing with different aspects of that theme. There is more space for people to 
identify with it.”

Lepage believes that young artists often bump into important and interesting 
themes early in their career, when they are not fully prepared to deal with 
them artistically. “I felt there were many unturned stones, many things left 
unsaid, because I didn’t have the experience, the maturity, to fully understand 
them.”

But the other important impetus in returning to Needles & Opium was to rework 
the design into something more three-dimensional. The original work had a 
single performer standing in front of a screen. Now, Lepage believes, the work 
is simply more fleshed out: “We have more performers, more scenes. It’s more 
sensuous, more three-dimensional, the scenography is more fleshed out, the 
story more developed.”

Fringe review: Run Girl Run

Jana Perkovic headed off to Tuxedo Cat for fringe theatre performed on 
treadmills. Happily the audience gets to sit still. She finds it engrossing but 
rather one note. (That note presumably being the slap of trainer on treadmill). 
You can read Jana’sthree-star review in full here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/mar/13/run-girl-run-review-a-showcase-of-endurance?view=desktop>
, or read an extract below

The pace and length of the work are decided by the performers’ natural 
physical limits. The work stops when all three performers have literally 
collapsed on the ground, making terrifying gagging sounds. It is not so much 
that gender is performed in front of us; rather, the impossible quest to live 
up to normative standards is physicalised, and if it does not quite work as 
metaphor, it certainly works as a showcase of endurance.

Review: Windmill Theatre's School Dance
 School Dance: great moves from Jonathan, Luke and Matt. Photograph: Alicia 
Canter for the Guardian 
There is glitter. Dance routines to Spandau Ballet. A bad case of acid-wash 
denim. An ewok. Who in their right mind wouldn’t enjoy an evening at Windmill’s 
ode to losers, School Dance. The second in their trilogy of coming-of-age 
stories, this is a joyful romp around the horrors of being a teenager, 
approached with massive warmth and sincerity. Its success lies, obviously, in 
its soundtrack. But also in its complete lack of cynicism. It holds a mirror to 
the best bits of teenage life too: the friendships, the emotions, the lack of 
real-world experience.

You can read my four star review of the show in full here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/mar/13/windmill-theatre-trilogy-school-dance-review-when-teenage-losers-triumph?view=desktop>
. Or here’s a taster.

The performances are fantastic, the chemistry between the boys believable and 
compelling, and there’s some frankly brilliant dancing in evidence. Not least 
in a finale that has every audience member grinning from ear-to-ear. It must 
have been so tempting to make School Dance more palatable; less geeky. But that 
is its joy and what makes it real: this isall the awkwardness of First Kiss 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpbDHxCV29A>, with none of the giddily 
beautiful hipster snogging. So like real teenage life then.

James Luna: "For Indigenous people, humour is a survival skill"

Institute. Artists Jenny Fraser (QLD) and James Luna (USA). Photograph: Alicia 
Canter for the Guardian 
We’ve written a bit about Four Rooms, an exhibition at Tandanya National 
Aboriginal Cultural Institute <http://www.tandanya.com.au/> here in Adelaide, 
but Alex Needham has been exploring it in more depth. He’s been talking to 
James Luna, an American performance artist who is collaborating with Australian 
artist Jenny Fraser. Both are Indigenous people from opposite shores of the 
Pacific –Luna is from Orange, California where he lives on the La Jolla 
reservation, and Fraser is from Mareeba in Queensland.. The pair’s “room” – 
that is the central conceit of the show – considers that expanse of water.

Alex sat down and chatted to Luna about his collaboration with Fraser, and the 
pair’s shared ocean.You can read his feature in full here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/mar/13/james-luna-four-rooms-adelaide-festival?view=desktop>
, and catch an extract below.

In Luna’s experience, Indigenous people from to two continents also share a 
laugh. “When we meet each other there’s this wonderful sense of humour, and the 
humour is a survival skill. I’ve been quoted as saying dammit, if you can’t 
laugh at it then you’re gonna be depressed, so even though it might be painful, 
someone will crack a joke just to break the ice and keep moving on and I like 
to put that in my work as well. Also there’s a story there for all people in 
terms of survival, difference, acceptance, outlook.

“I truly believe that all the strife in the world is caused by 
miscommunication and ignorance,” he adds. “But it’s not quite that simple 
because we need to rewrite history as it was written. It didn’t surprise me to 
go toBrighton Beach 
<http://www.southaustralia.com/regions/adelaide-city-beaches.aspx> and see a 
big statue to the explorer that discovered Australia. It galls me, because how 
can you discover a culture that’s been there for thousands and thousands of 
years? As an artist, I can’t change the way people think but I can get some 
people to reconsider.”

Zorn in Oz – choppy and compelling

conducted by David Fulmer, during the Classical Marathon concert. Photograph: 
Alicia Canter for the Guardian 
Alex Needham has been at some kind of musical marathon or other every night 
for the last week. (How is he going to react when faced with an evening that 
doesn’t require absolute concentration on sonic experimentation? I’m worried 
for him.) Last night it was John Zorn’s Classical Marathon, to which he gave a 
three-star review.You can read that review in full here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/mar/13/john-zorn-classical-marathon-review-adelaide-festival>
 or read and extract from it below

John Zorn is known for the remarkable breadth of his work – he has tackled 
everything from punk to opera – and on Wednesday the second of Adelaide 
festival’s four-night retrospective focused on his classical repertoire. It was 
performed in two halves, the first by the Brisbane-basedElision Ensemble 
<http://www.elision.org.au/ELISION_Ensemble/ELISION.html> and second by the 
Adelaide Symphony Orchestra <http://www.aso.com.au/> – both last seen in the 
Adelaide festival at Tectonics – and conducted byDavid Fulmer 
<http://fulmermusic.com/>, who was hugged so hard by Zorn at the end that he 
nearly lost his balance.
