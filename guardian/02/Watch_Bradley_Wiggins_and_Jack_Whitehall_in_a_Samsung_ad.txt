Samsung: ‘Jack Tries Cycling’ (starts at 00:04) - UK

Bradley Wiggins is the perfect foil for Jack Whitehall in this funny advert 
for Samsung. In the run-up to the Olympics, the comedian famous for his limp 
athleticism on Sky’s A League of Their Own is going to try a number of 
different sports and – it would appear – he’s be offering scant respect to our 
Olympic heroes.

Tesco Mobile: ‘Friend Request’ (starts at 01:38) - Ireland

This simple, inexpensive advert from Ireland does a great job at conveying the 
panic induced by a very modern problem – a social media friend request from 
your boss. While her face reflects a woman’s paroxysms of terror at this 
dilemma, her voice details the full extent of the awkwardness.

KFC: ‘An Apology’ (starts at 02:12) - UK

Given the current focus on cultural appropriation, you could argue it’s risky 
of KFC to present us with an “Irish” variation on its usual menu called the 
O’Sanders burger. Cleverly, its advertising acknowledges this full on by poking 
fun at the affectionately-meant but ridiculous notion of “Oirishness” common to 
English-speaking parts of the world.

Anchor Spreadable: ‘Hometime’ (starts at 03:57) - UK

The distinctive animation in this ongoing campaign for Anchor’s spreadable 
butter is really eye-catching but it’s the performance of Ben Harris – who 
provides the dad’s voice – that really gives it some oomph. Parents everywhere 
will relate to his frustration when one of his children gets mischievous at 
soft play and he comes very close to issuing a major sweary.
