Quotes of the day

So many quotes. So little time. Some questions faced by the Rudds on Thursday 
...

Kevin Rudd with Red Symons, of ABC Melbourne:

Symons: "I sense you've been a little bit negative about Tony Abbott. If 
you're negative about a negative person, does that make you positive?"

Rudd: "I take it that you've done one of those propositions in science and 
maths like me in about year 11 – is that right? The two negatives equal a 
positive."

Meanwhile, Rudd's wife, Therese Rein, was batting off her own bizarre 
questions from John Laws.

Rein: "Good morning, John."

Laws: "A lot of people say – why isn't she Therese Rudd?"

Rein: "Really?"

Laws: "Yeah."

Rein: "Well, why isn't Kevin, Kevin Rein?"

Laws: "[Laughs]. No, I can't accept that. We're talking about tradition. Why 
do you choose not to be Therese Rudd?"

The big questions ...

Tweets of the day

Following on from the quotes, Rein let us know she did not take offence. 
Obviously she is battle hardened.

Why is the focus from my chat with the highly courteous John Laws this morning 
on the warm up question about shared surnames? 1/2#auspol

2/2 That is ironic given the substance of the chat was about trivialization 
and furphies detracting from real discussion in our democracy.

Prop of the day: the Vegemite files

After his daughters testified as to their father's view of netball as "rugby 
in skirts", the opposition leader promised $6m to complete the construction of 
a Netball Centre of Excellence and to support netball in the lead-up to the 
2015 Netball World Cup in Sydney. In a little bit of Kath & Kim, Abbott was 
presented a netball top.

Stat of the day

$1.5m Paid out in bets by Sportsbet on a Coalition win, nine days out from the 
election. So confident are they of a Coalition landslide.

Candidate of the day

Christopher Pyne gets the award for batting on in the face of adversity at an 
education forum, where he debated his counterpart, education minister Bill 
Shorten. A teacher asked him if he was aware of the "gloom" descending over 
some in the education sector at the prospect of a Coalition government and of 
Pyne as minister, particularly his ideas of copying the private school system. 
"I think there's a fair bit of verballing in there," Pyne said. "I apologise 
for all my failings which you have gone through in great detail. I'm happy to 
say I value public education. I'm the product of public schooling. I think they 
do a marvellous job. I just want them to be even better."
