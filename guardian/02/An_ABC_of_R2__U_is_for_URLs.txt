Today U, for URLs... whose structure we worked hard to get right as part of 
the project. This was an important part of weaving ourselves into the fabric of 
the web: to ensure our referencing system had a useful structure to those 
outside our organisation.

Previously our URLs looked like this:

http://politics.theguardian.com/tonyblair/story/0,,2075005,00.html


today the same piece of content is referenced like this:

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/10/tonyblair.labour3


There are two obvious changes here. First, the obscure numbers have gone -- a 
legacy of our old Vignette StoryServer 
<http://seo2.0.onreact.com/top-10-url-design-failures-of-famous-websites> 
software, and utterly useless to anyone who happens to be a human being. 
Second, we've included the date in a friendly format, to provide some sense of 
orientation, and particularly useful if you happen to be looking at several 
URLs at a time.

There are other changes, too. The "politics" reference has come out of the 
domain name and into the path, to reflect the fact that all our content is part 
of the theguardian.com site. A couple of keywords also appear in the URL, 
partly to convey what the content is about, and partly to distinguish it from 
any other content that appeared in the same section on the same day. As it 
happens, quite a lot was written about Tony Blair and Labour on that day, so 
the "3" adds a further unique identifier.

In some ways URL structure is an obscure topic, but getting it right opens up 
access to more of our content in more ways to more people. Further examples 
have been given byMatt McAlister in his discussion of the RSS feeds
