Night. Alex (Malcom MacDowell) and his droogs swerve across the road in their 
sports car, attempting to hit as many pedestrians as possible en route. As they 
progress into the countryside, Alex's voiceover provides a running commentary.

"The Durango 95 purred away real horrorshow, a nice, warm vibraty feeling all 
through your guttiwuts. Soon it was trees and dark, my brothers, with real 
country dark. We fillied around for a while with other travellers of the night, 
playing hogs of the road. Then we headed west. What we were after now was the 
old surprise visit that was a real kick and good for laughs and lashing of the 
ultra-violent."

Eventually, Alex and company arrive at an isolated penthouse. The lights are 
on inside. Giggling, the boys clamber from their vehicle and advance upon the 
house in single file.

In the house, Frank Alexander (Patrick Magee) sits typing. The doorbell rings. 

"Who on earth could that be?" 

His wife (Adrienne Corri) moves towards the front door. 

"Yes? Who is it?" 

Alex whimpers from outside. 

"Excuse me, Mrs, will you please help? There's been a terrible accident." 

Mrs Alexander inches open the door and peeps outside.
