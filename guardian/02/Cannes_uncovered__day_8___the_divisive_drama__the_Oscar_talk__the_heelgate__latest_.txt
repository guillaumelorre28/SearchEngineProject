Watching films at festivals often gives you an inaccurate view of whether the 
film is any good. The so-called “festival bubble” inflates knee-jerk reaction 
into unassailable fact. The hive of assembled journos makes its mind up quick 
after early morning press screening. The problem? The hive is often wrong. It’s 
got exhausted press for brains.

Over the past few years, a number of films have either been slated or praised 
at festivals, then received the opposite reaction on release.Under the Skin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/12/the-10-best-films-of-2014-no-1-under-the-skin>
 was booed at Venice. It became one of the most acclaimed films of the 
following year. Prisoners was touted as a major Oscar contender when it 
premiered at Toronto. It ended up with just one nomination for cinematography. 
All the Boys Love Mandy Lane was buzzed about as a hit new horror in Toronto. 
It took seven years to get a US release.

It can be a strange environment, surrounded by so many people eager to label 
something amazing or awful, so it’s important to remain objective and not get 
caught up in the hyperbole. And to never boo. Because we’re not children. Nor a 
Simpsons crowd. Now ... let’s find out how bad that new Sorrentino film is.

The big film

Paolo Sorrentino’s new film, Youth, made its debut this morning. Sorrentino 
has had mixed fortunes on the Croisette in recent years. While Il Divo and The 
Great Beauty both premiered to universal acclaim, his Sean Penn-starring drama 
This Must Be the Place was less well received. He’s gone back to the English 
language for his latest. It starsMichael Caine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-caine> and Harvey Keitel as lifelong 
friends – one a composer and the other a film director – recuperating in a 
swanky Swiss resort. Youth also features Rachel Weisz, Paul Dano, Jane Fonda 
and, gulp, Paloma Faith.

Critics can’t seem to decide on Youth. The film was met with a mixture of 
applause and boos. Peter Bradshaw was somewhere in the middle,giving it three 
stars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/20/youth-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-michael-caine>
 and calling it “a diverting, minor work”. Check out some of the other

YOUTH: Sorrentino's GREAT BEAUTY follow-up has a few gorgeous moments, but is 
mostly kind of embarrassing. Jane Fonda steals it#Cannes

Someone needs to tell Paolo Sorrentino that when EVERY scene is the BIGGEST 
scene, it becomes meaningless. YOUTH is a gorgeous dud.#Cannes

Catherine Shoard headed to the press conference after the screening, where 
Michael Caine appeared at his first Cannes since 1966 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/20/michael-caine-in-cannes-playing-the-elderly-is-better-than-playing-the-dead>

a prize, and I didn’t. So I didn’t come back.”

It’s rapidly become the most talked-about story of the festival: heelgate 
continues to rage on. The latest in the controversy overwhether or not women 
have been turned away from premieres for wearing flat shoes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/19/cannes-backlash-high-heels-emily-blunt-flat-shoes>
 rather than high heels is an official (confusing) response from the festival’s 
press office:

“Regarding the dress code for the red carpet screenings, rules have not 
changed throughout the years (Tuxedo, formal dress for Gala screenings) and 
there is no specific mention about the height of the women’s heels as well as 
for men’s. Thus, in order to make sure that this rule is respected, the 
festival’s hosts and hostesses were reminded of it.”

Last night saw the premiere of Sicario 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/19/sicario-review-emily-blunt-thriller>
, which was the first red carpet event since the story first broke. Despite a 
press conference earlier in the way that saw star Emily Blunt say that women 
“shouldn’t wear high heels”, she ended up avoiding flats and, sadly, director 
Denis Villeneuve’s comment that he would attend wearing heels with actors Josh 
Brolin and Benicio del Toro didn’t come to fruition. Shame.

The shock doc

Despite not showing as part of the official festival, last night’s screening 
of Amy Berg’s documentaryAn Open Secret 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/20/an-open-secret-review-damning-documentary-takes-aim-at-sexual-abuse-in-hollywood>
 (for press but also potential buyers) has helped to make it one of the 
buzziest films of the town. It’s a shocking look at sexual abuse in Hollywood 
that names and shames some industry figures who took advantage of young actors. 
It’s had a troubled time getting to the screen, given its inflammatory content, 
and some cuts have been made for legal reasons but it’s finally set to get a 
wider audience this summer. Its release in the UK might prove troublesome 
however. The producers claim the organisers of the London film festival told 
them that British tabloid law prevented them from showing it. I’ll be speaking 
to the people behind the film this afternoon to find out more.

The Oscar buzz
 In sight of the action ... Benicio del Toro in Sicario 
While, because of its earlier date, Cannes is often less of an Oscar predictor 
than some of the later festivals, it still offers up a handful of awards 
contenders every year. Recent festivals have seen Foxcatcher, Leviathan, 
Moonrise Kingdom and Amour sustain the buzz and receive nominations and wins 
months after.

Forget what we said earlier, we definitely know what we’re talking about here. 
There is no way this year’s bunch won’t get some Oscar nominations. Absolutely 
... no ... way. Here’s our extremely early predictions:

 * Carol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/16/carol-review-cate-blanchett-captivates-in-woozily-obsessive-lesbian-romance>
 - probably the frontrunner when it comes to academy love, Cate Blanchett is 
the closest we can get to a lock for a best actress nod at this stage while 
Rooney Mara is also a strong possibility, depending on whether she is pushed as 
lead or supporting. Given the handsome production values, we can probably 
expect a long list of nominations for this one. 
 * Sicario 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/19/sicario-review-emily-blunt-thriller>
 - while it’s arguably more of a straight up action thriller than an Oscar 
film, Denis Villeneuve’s drug cartel drama is still getting some chatter. The 
most likely is a best supporting actor nomination for Benicio del Toro while 
Roger Deakins might well get a cinematography nod. Emily Blunt is also in with 
an outside for best actress. 
 * Youth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/20/youth-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-michael-caine>
 - although it’s proving divisive, some believe that it will be a hit with 
Oscar voters and that Michael Caine could be in for a best actor nomination 
 * Son of Saul - universally glowing reviews for this gripping Holocaust drama 
should also help push it to a best foreign language nom 
 * Inside Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/18/inside-out-review-cannes-film-festival-pixar>
 - Pixar’s latest should definitely get a nomination for best animated feature 
The cinephile’s dream

One of the most anticipated documentaries of the festival, at least for the 
fervent film buffs, has been Kent Jones’s revealing look at François Truffaut’s 
interview series with Alfred Hitchcock. Jones has assembled an impressive 
selection of directors to take part in the doc from David Fincher to Martin 
Scorsese to Richard Linklater.Peter Bradshaw gave it four stars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/19/hitchcocktruffaut-review-cannes-looks-back-to-a-golden-past-of-cinephilia>
, calling it “a fascinating film”.

The “wait, what?” film
 Deep Dark Photograph: PR 
The market continues to offer up some foul surprises and this one might just 
be the queasiest of the festival so far, well at least from the poster. The 
actual plot sounds more interesting though: a sculptor finds a talking wall in 
his house that has the power to fulfil his wildest dreams and his worst 
nightmares.The trailer is surprisingly creepy <https://vimeo.com/101430487>.

 Gasper Noe’s latest film Love. Photograph: PR 
If you’ve been patiently waiting for some controversy then this festival has 
been rather tame (heelgate is the closest we’ve come) but Gaspar Noé’s new 
film, Love, which screens tonight, is a shoo-in for the most talked about of 
the fest, with its 3D tale of explicit sex likely to raise eyebrows and maybe 
other bits too. We’ll also have the latest from Disney and Pixar as John 
Lasseter presents its upcoming slate.

Oh, and we’ll also be doing another film show podcast – and this time we have 
a very special guest. Find out who it is tomorrow.
