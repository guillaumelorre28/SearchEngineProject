The internet is a wonderful thing. It can give a voice to the voiceless, and 
allow people to gather together in order to further causes that might be 
overlooked by the mainstream media.

Music fans may remember the 1999 Brit awards, in which it was assumed that 
Steps were a sure-fire bet to win in the public-voted Best Newcomer category. 
However, a grass-roots campaign sawthe prize instead go to Belle and Sebastian 
<http://youtu.be/t14R6-IUnY4?t=13m43s>, a rare David-and-Goliath moment that 
showed that sometimes the underdog really can triumph.

It is with this same air of jubilation that we must name Matt Cardle, winner 
of series seven of the X Factor, as our readers' favourite act of the year, 
scooping the number one position for both album, with Letters, and single, with 
Starlight.

Preliminary investigations suggest that the Cardle campaign was largely down 
to posters on theMatt Cardle Appreciation Thread (Part 42) 
<http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?p=55181913> running on the 
website Digital Spy. So well done guys. Great stuff. Great.

Looking at the album and the song in second place, our non-Cardle-loving 
readers' votes were very much in accordance with our critics' nominations, 
perhaps slightly surprisingly in light of some of the outrage posted underthe 
lists last week 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/dec/19/best-songs-2011?intcmp=ILCMUSIMG9382>
. We might, if we were being a bit peevish about block voting, think of Let 
England Shake by PJ Harvey, and Video Games by Lana Del Rey as the moral 
victors in our readers' polls.

Honourable mentions go to the Horrors, M83 and Adele, who had a very high 
number of votes in the best song category, and Bon Iver and Wild Beasts, who 
had a very strong voter turnout for best album.
