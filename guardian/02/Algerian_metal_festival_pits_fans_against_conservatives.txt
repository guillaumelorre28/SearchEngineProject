They came from all over conservative Algeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/algeria>, clad in black leather, studded 
bracelets and even traditional Muslim veils, to revel in a rare heavy metal 
festival.

Held in Constantine, designated this year’s Capital of Arab Culture by the 
Arab League and Unesco, the two-day Fest 213 brought together metal fans from 
across the country.

Headbanging and mosh pits may seem incongruous in Algeria, where the 
government prefers to promote traditional music and events that bolster its 
Arab-Muslim identity.

But the country has had a solid core of metal fans for more than two decades 
and, despite occasional media charges of “devil worship”, the music is 
attracting a new generation of followers.

“This is really unprecedented,” said a young woman from Constantine, who 
called herself Sadness Spirit at the event, which shares its name with 
Algeria’s international dialling code.

Dressed in black leather, with piercings and dyed-red hair, she was waiting 
for a concert to begin, accompanied by a friend with her own piercings but also 
wearing a Muslim veil.

Nearby stood a group of young men dressed in black T-shirts, their arms 
tattooed and their hair slicked back with gel. “Outside of concerts we don’t 
dress this way or act this way, to avoid trouble,” said Sadness Spirit.

The festival featured five bands – Franco-Algerian acts Acyl and Arkan and 
homegrown outfits Traxx, Fingerprints and Numidas.

Algerian metal is a far cry from the Raï pop music, which also originated in 
the country.Metal <https://www.theguardian.com/music/metal> first emerged there 
in the 1990s, during a decade marked by a devastating war between the 
government and Islamists, which eventually claimed 200,000 lives.

With authorities preoccupied with battling extremism, an underground metal 
scene flourished largely unnoticed. More recently it has come under fire from 
conservatives, who accuse the music of corrupting Algeria’s youth.

El Biled, a conservative television channel, launched an attack on metal fans 
last summer, accusing them of being “devil worshippers”.

The channel broadcast a documentary featuring fans discussing black magic, 
with images of skulls flashing in the background.

The documentary prompted a backlash from metal aficionados on social media, 
with one Facebook page urging supporters to adopt the slogan “I’m a metalhead 
and a Muslim”.

Artists have also accused the government of using its control over concert 
venues to limit their performances, blocking some bands and telling others to 
change their lyrics.

Malik Chaoui, an Algerian cultural activist, said the government too often 
promotes “cultural policies that aim to control thought” and needs to accept 
more diversity.

For now, followers of Algerian alternative music scene are doing what they can 
outside the mainstream. Social media is being used for promotion and finding 
independent associations willing to help organise events.

In Algiers, a group of young people have set up a group called Mayhem to help 
promote musicians who play rock, metal and blues. It has already arranged for 
performances on the terrace of the capital’s Museum of Fine Arts.

“Officials consider these movements as too westernised and not profitable, but 
in fact a metal concert brings in a lot of people,” said 21-year-old member 
Zakaria Brahami.
