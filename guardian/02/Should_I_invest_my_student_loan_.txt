Q I am currently a first-year student doing music with education. I find it 
quite scary when I think about how much debt I will be left with at the end of 
my course. I do have a student loan each year from the bank, but I try to use 
as little of it as possible. Instead I would like to know about the possibility 
of investing this money and then using the interest to pay off my government 
loan. Can you help?

A Although your intentions are admirable, it is difficult to recommend that 
you put your money anywhere else other than a high-interest savings account. 
Since you are in your first year, you probably have just two more years of your 
course before you graduate, and you will have to think about repaying your loan 
once you have a job that pays reasonably well.

It is tempting to think that you could invest in the stockmarket and make 
enough money to pay off the interest, but in order to do so you would need to 
know a lot about shares and to take a considerable risk with your money. Two 
years is a very short time to be in the stockmarket, and experts suggest that 
you should be prepared to commit your money for at least five and possibly ten 
years. In addition, the value of your investments may go down, as well as up. 
If you were to lose the capital, you would not only be paying off the interest, 
but you would have to find extra money from somewhere to make up the capital 
shortfall.

If you want to find a good home for your money, then Moneyfacts has a list of 
best-buy savings accounts. You could also consider Premium Bonds, which pay 
interest and have the chance of winning you a tax-free prize.
