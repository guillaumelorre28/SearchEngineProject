The penalty was announced on Tuesday by the MLB 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mlb> senior vice president Joe Garagiola Jr. 
Garagiola Jr also fined the Yankees manager, Joe Girardi, for arguing with the 
plate umpire Brian O'Nora.

Girardi was ejected after storming out of the dugout to yell at O'Nora, who 
warned both benches immediately after Rodriguez was hit by Ryan Dempster's 3-0 
pitch leading off the second inning. It struck his left elbow pad and 
ricocheted off his back. The dustup seemed to spark the Yankees, who were 
trailing 2-0 at the time. They won 9-6, Mariano Rivera earning his first save 
since blowing three chances in a row for the first time in his career.

Dempster could still play if he decides to appeal the penalty. Rodriguez is 
playing on while he appealsa 211-game suspension imposed by MLB as part of the 
investigation into the Biogenesis anti-ageing clinic and the use of 
performance-enhancing drugs
