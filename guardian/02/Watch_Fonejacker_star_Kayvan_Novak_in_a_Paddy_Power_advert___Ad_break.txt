Android: ‘Rock, Paper, Scissors’ (starts at 00:04) - US

The game “rock, paper, scissors” is the inspiration for an uplifting story of 
misfits forming unlikely friendships to underline the brand’s “together, not 
the same” philosophy. From the opening chords of St Elmo’s Fire – with its 
iconic 80s bratpack association – to the trio’s triumphal jump at the end, this 
lovely film presses every emotional button and then some.

Paddy Power: ‘Complaints Line’ (starts at 01:07) - UK

Having turned prank calls into an award-winning art form with both Fonejacker 
and Facejacker, comedian Kayvan Novak is the ideal fit for Paddy Power’s funny 
look at its “complaints department” – one smooth-talking chap in a green 
blazer. Alas, it seems not everyone is taken with the bookmaker’s generosity.

The Chapar: ‘Changing Room’ (starts at 01:41) - UK

For the gentleman who regards clothes shopping as a journey into the heart of 
darkness itself, The Chapar announces itself as the light at the end of the 
sartorial tunnel via this well-scripted launch film. As a Lloyd Griffith turns 
a changing room into his second home, Elis James offers fashion advice of 
varying degrees of helpfulness. Well, not that varying, actually.

Booking.com: ‘Battle’ (starts at 02:46) - UK

Booking.com kicks off a new campaign proclaiming that holidays can be the 
perfect time to indulge our most beloved pursuits. A gravelly voiceover lends 
an aura of seduction to the proposition while a couple are shown getting 
medieval on each other, as it were. A neat reminder of the variety of 
activities which can shape our time away, and how the advertised website can 
help us get closer to them.

Klarna: ‘Fish’ (starts at 03:21) - Sweden

In this Swedish advert for internet payment company Klarna, a large fish is 
poised at the top of a children’s slide before gliding down and crossing a 
polished floor. It appears in no discomfort at all: on the contrary, the whole 
scenario appears as frictionless as if the fish were happily submerged. Add to 
this a distinctive electronic music bed and you have a film that perfectly 
expresses the idea of a smooth service.

McDonald’s McCafé: ‘Coming Out’ (starts at 03:55) - Taiwan

This sweet Taiwanese advert featuring a young man coming out as gay to his 
father has provoked quite a controversy on the Asian island where some have 
perceived it as a Western multinational encouraging homosexuality. The catchily 
named Alliance of Taiwan Religious Groups for the Protection of Family are so 
incensed that it is leading calls for a boycott of the fast-food chain.
