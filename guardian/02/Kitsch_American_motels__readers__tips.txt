Winning tip: The Madonna Inn, San Luis Obispo, California

The reception at this intriguing stopover on Highway 101 to LA is pure kitsch, 
and dark glasses are suggested for the bar, as you perch on shocking pink sofas 
in a shocking pink room. There are around 30 themed bedrooms to choose from.

Cute adobe cabins, decorated with sombreros and other Mexican imagery, are 
situated around a walled-in courtyard with a large fountain and cacti. There’s 
no catering on site, but there is a great barbecue pit, so get some beer and 
steaks from the supermarket in Twentynine Palms down the road and kick back.

A coulrophobe’s nightmare, the garish sign outside hints at the bizarreness 
within: the lobby is packed with clowns watching your every move, while clown 
figures on the bedroom doors await your arrival. The decor is dated but the 
motel is cheap, clean and comfortable. A disused cemetery next to the motel 
adds to the spookiness.

Head along the Extraterrestrial Highway into Rachel and your only neighbour is 
Area 51. The inn itself welcomes earthlings as well as aliens, and once you’re 
inside there’s a warm welcome from owner Pat and plenty of cold beer, as well 
as maps, alien goodies and more as you settle in for the night, hoping to meet 
some aliens.

This fun, funky motel on Route 66, not far from Vegas, has the world’s longest 
Route 66 map and the rooms are all themed on iconic celebrities, such as 
Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Sam, the owner, and his wife are fonts of local 
knowledge, and Taco, their dog, will perform tricks for treats.

With its 1950s decor, neon signage and welcoming hosts, this retro palace is 
the classic roadside motel. The rooms are kitted out with kitsch furniture and 
comfy beds, and chairs outside the doors add to that old Americana feel. It’s 
like being on a film set.

incorrectly, that there was a pool on the site.
