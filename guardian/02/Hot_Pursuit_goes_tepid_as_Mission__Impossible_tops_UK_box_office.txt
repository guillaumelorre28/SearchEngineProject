Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation review – functional old-school action 
thriller

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/30/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-review>
There has been plenty of speculation that, nearly three decades after Top Gun 
propelled him to the top of the A-list, Tom Cruise has lost his box-office 
potency. Commercial returns for his recent movies Edge of Tomorrow, Oblivion 
and Jack Reacher were all soft, and his star presence didn’t seem to do much 
for musical Rock of Ages. So the prophets of doom will all be pausing to 
reflect now that Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation has begun with a sturdy 
£4.33m plus £1.02m in Thursday previews. Those numbers are hardly a franchise 
best, but they are roughly equivalent to previous entries.Mission: Impossible – 
Ghost Protocol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/01/mission-impossible-ghost-protocol-review>
 debuted right at the end of 2011, with £2.71m plus hefty previews of £5.48m, 
giving a seven-day opening of £8.19m. The differences in the release strategies 
make it difficult to draw direct comparisons between the initial performances 
of the two films.

A more apt comparison is Mission: Impossible 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/may/05/3>, which kicked off in May 
2006 with £4.76m plus £614,000 in previews. Rogue Nation achieved similar 
numbers, although of course benefits from significant ticket price inflation in 
the intervening nine years. Outside of Mission: Impossible, Cruise’s last film,
Edge of Tomorrow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/29/edge-of-tomorrow-film-review-tom-cruise>
, began with £1.89m in May 2014, on its way to a flat £7.89m lifetime total. 
Given the creative strength of the film, many wondered whether a different 
actor could have pushed it to a higher number. That debate will continue, but 
as far as Paramount’s Mission: Impossible franchise goes, audiences are 
exhibiting an enduring affection for Cruise in the Ethan Hunt role.

Suffering a drop of 52%, Pixar’s Inside Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/23/inside-out-review-high-iq-family-entertainment>
 earned £3.57m in its second frame, falling to second place. While that sounds 
a hefty tumble, it’s worth considering that the weather at the weekend was 
significantly sunnier than the previous rainy session, and most films fell by 
at least 50%. The number to keep an eye on is Inside Out’s 10-day total of 
£16.97m. That’s ahead of the lifetime totals of Pixar’s two weakest UK hits – 
Cars and Cars 2. After 10 days, Pixar’s last effort, Monsters University, stood 
at £8.63m, and Inside Out is nearly double that amount. The year before, Brave 
stood at £13.26m after two weekends of play, but an unusual rollout strategy 
means that this was in fact a 14-day figure in England and Wales, and a 24-day 
figure in the rest of the UK and Ireland. In any case, Inside Out is well ahead 
of that number.

A valid comparison for Inside Out is 2009’s Up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/mar/17/the-film-that-makes-me-cry-up-pixar>
, which stood at £13.92m after two weekends of play, on its way to a final 
tally of £34.6m. Disney Pixar will be hoping to push Inside Out to similar 
levels. However,Minions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/minions-review-boisterous-and-cheery-despicable-me-spin-off>
, from rival studio Universal Illumination, has already crossed the £40m 
barrier, with a sixth consecutive weekend at £1m-plus.

Apart from Secret Cinema’s The Empire Strikes Back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2015/jun/12/secret-cinema-the-empire-strikes-back-in-pictures>
, the only film continuing in the top 10 with a drop of less than 50% from the 
previous frame is Southpaw. The Jake Gyllenhaal boxing drama dropped a 
comparatively slim 32% despite the largely warm, dry weather that hampered the 
weekend box-office. Distributor Entertainment Films continues to support it 
with highly visible marketing, presumably encouraged by audience enthusiasm for 
the film. Southpaw has reached £4.04m after 10 days, and looks on course to 
become one of Gyllenhaal’s biggest UK hits.

The flop: Hot Pursuit

On paper, teaming up Reese Witherspoon and Modern Family’s Sofía Vergara in an 
action comedy looked a nice package. But after Hot Pursuit under-performed in 
the US earlier this summer, distributor Warner Bros was probably never going to 
bet the farm by pushing the film in the UK. A tepid £312,000 opening gross 
resulted, yielding a site average below £1,000. Audiences are so far rating the 
film a poor 4.9/10 at IMDb, with critics predictably offering an even harsher 
31/100 score at Metacritic. Witherspoon’s last comedy,This Means War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/01/this-means-war-review>, kicked 
off with £1.52m plus £300,000 in previews back in March 2012. That film 
benefited from a starrier line-up that also including Tom Hardy and Chris Pine. 
But evenHow Do You Know 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/27/how-do-you-know-review>, a 2011 
Witherspoon romcom flop that faced the hurdle here of a US sports setting, 
opened bigger than Hot Pursuit, with £375,000 from 211 cinemas, and a £1,777 
average.

Delivering one of the weakest openings of Adam Sandler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/adamsandler>’s career, The Cobbler has 
debuted with a dismal £57,800. However, given the scale of release – it played 
at the weekend in just 22 cinemas – that number at least delivers a decent 
average of £2,627. The Cobbler, in which Sandler experiences the lives of his 
customers by walking in their shoes, is currently playing in 20 Showcase 
cinemas, daytime screenings only. It may have benefited from more generous 
programming at the weekend. By swerving the Vue, Cineworld and Odeon chains, 
The Cobbler can be released on to DVD and VOD without waiting out the standard 
16.5-week theatrical window that the bigger multiplex chains demand in the UK. 
The release is so tiny, that comparisons with past Sandler films are pretty 
meaningless. However, his last comedy,Blended 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/25/blended-review-sandler-putrid>, 
kicked off with £689,000 from 388 cinemas in May 2014.

The Bollywood hit

With £2.17m after 17 days of release, Bajrangi Bhaijaan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/19/bajrangi-bhaijaan-review-salman-khan-india-pakistan-movie>
 is the first Bollywood movie to crack £2m in the UK sincePK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/07/global-box-office-pk-the-hobbit-big-hero-6-unbroken>
 back in January. The challenge for distributor Eros is now to push the film up 
to the level of Dhoom 3, which managed £2.71m in December 2013. Bajrangi 
Bhaijaan, starringSalman Khan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/06/bollywood-star-salman-khan-found-guilty-over-hit-and-run-crash>
 and Kareena Kapoor, enjoys a strong 8.4/10 user rating at IMDb.

The Diary Of A Teenage Girl: ‘a more realistic view of women and sex’

Despite the arrival of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, takings overall are 
19% down on the previous frame, and 8% adrift from the equivalent weekend in 
2014, whenGuardians of the Galaxy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/31/guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-marvel-superheroes>
 arrived at the top of the chart. For the coming frame, cinemas have no hope of 
matching the 2014 equivalent, which saw the arrival of The Inbetweeners 2. 
Still, they will be pinning hopes for a decent result from Fox/Marvel’s 
Fantastic Four reboot, plus The Gift, the latest from prolific genre producer 
Jason Blum. Alternatives includeDiary of a Teenage Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/04/diary-of-a-teenage-girl-film>, a 
coming-of-age tale controversially saddled with an 18 certificate by the UK 
censor; dog adventure Max; Al Pacino in David Gordon Green’s Manglehorn, and 
Spanish cop thriller Marshland.
