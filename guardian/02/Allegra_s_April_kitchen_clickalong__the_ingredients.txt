Join in the fun, frolics and shenanigans next Wednesday evening from 8pm when 
we'll becooking along with Allegra once again 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/allegra-mcevedy-online-cookalong>
. Here's a shopping list to take along on your next food purchasing foray.

For anyone who is new to the idea of a kitchen clickalong, here's how it 
works. Ready yourselves with ingredients, a laptop in the kitchen (or within 
hollering distance) and be ready to start cooking at 8pm sharp on the evening 
in question (next Wednesday, 15 April). Allegra will be posting instructions 
and pictures in real time (like this 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/feb/18/curry>) until 
we're all done and ready to chow down at about 9pm.

We're keeping the exact nature of the dish to be constructed a secret until 
it's time to cook. If you have a inkling feel free to guess, though ...


Ingredients

2 pork escalopes, each weighing in at 150-200g, about 1.5cm thick 
(NB: you can also do this with chicken - get a breast, peel off the fillet at 
the back, put it between 2 layers of clingfilm and beat it thin with the flat 
of a large knife)
320g sweet potato
Half a tin coconut milk
A few fennel seeds
A handful of peanuts, salted is fine but plain roasted better
Ground cumin & coriander
Bunch of coriander
2 red chillies
Couple of spring onions
Couple of cloves of garlic
A cucumber
Couple of limes
A few tbsp groundnut or plain oil (ie oil with not much flavour)

Hope that gets your taste buds going, see you next week!
