Maggie Smith
New Faces of 1956 (1956)

Dame Maggie’s forays on Broadway have been relatively few for someone of her 
stature and one can only imagine the box-office stampede she would now generate 
on the back ofDownton Abbey. Playgoers of a certain vintage still talk in 
adoring tones of Smith’s New York debut in the kind ofsketch-driven theatrical 
revue <http://www.paullynde.info/newfaces56.htm> that you don’t see much any 
more, on either side of the Atlantic. (Among the show’s writers was a young 
Neil Simon.) Smithreturned in triumph 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbvk7__-kR0> to the same playhouse, the 
Barrymore, 34 years later in Peter Shaffer’sLettice and Lovage, proving that, 
yes, you can go home again.

Sophie Okonedo
A Raisin in the Sun (2014)

It might have seemed perverse to choose a British actress to play one of the 
enduring roles in the American repertoire, but2005 Oscar nominee

Okonedo (Hotel Rwanda) confounded sceptics and won a Tony 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m4en2BP5DE> in the process for her searing 
turn as Ruth Younger, wife to Denzel Washington’s feckless Walter Lee Younger, 
inlast spring’s revival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/10/sophie-okonedo-interview-raisin-sun-denzel-washington-broadway>
 of Lorraine Hansberry’s iconic 1959 playA Raisin in the Sun. And while we’re 
at it, how about more black British performers, please, on the Broadway stage? 
Paging Adrian Lester, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lenny Henry 
just for starters.

Janet McTeer
A Doll’s House (1997)

Henrik Ibsen tends not to cause much of a stir on Broadway, and many is the 
star who has come a Broadway cropper in his plays (Mary-Louise Parker as Hedda 
Gabler, for one 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/theater/reviews/26bran.html?_r=0>). But 
Janet McTeer’s maiden venture to Broadway in Ibsen’s 1879 classic made an 
instant star of the statuesque performer and ledNew York Times theatre critic 
Ben Brantley to proclaim her Nora perhapsthe finest performance he had ever seen
 <http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/03/theater/the-doll-brings-down-the-house.html>
. McTeer alsodelighted interviewers 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ8BhPrHb7U> with her larky, unbridled 
comments, announcing at one point that she was looking forward while in 
Manhattan to dating Jewish men.

Alan Cumming
Cabaret (1998)

Rarely do two actors become associated with a single role, but Alan Cumming 
both subverted and surpassed expectations when he opened on Broadway in 1998 in
Cabaret by eclipsing memories of the legendary Joel Grey, the original Emcee 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxQyITv7pr4> in the John Kander/Fred Ebb 
musical about the rise of the Third Reich.Seedier and more louche 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysf3GW-PASA> than Grey ever was, the 
Perthshire-born actor developed so enduring a connection to the role of the Kit 
Kat Klub’s take-no-prisoners compere that he returned to it earlier this year 
in anongoing revival of a revival 
<http://www.roundabouttheatre.org/Shows-Events/Cabaret.aspx> in which his 
ferocity of attack remains undiminished – and searing.

Tom Conti
Whose Life Is It Anyway? (1979)

There were two prevailing non-musical hits in the 1978-79 season, The Elephant 
Man(due to return to Broadway in November, this time with Bradley Cooper 
<http://www.newyorkcitytheatre.com/theaters/booththeater/the-elephant-man.php>) 
andWhose Life Is It Anyway? – both plays that were originally staged in London. 
But it was Tom Conti’sLondon performance 
<http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/Cover/2726/8932/Whose-Life-Is-It-Anyway>
 as quadriplegic sculptor Ken Harrison that New York took most emotively to 
heart. Intriguingly, so difficult was Conti to replace that the part underwent 
a sex change so that Brian Clark’s play could reopen withMary Tyler Moore 
<http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/Cover/10212/8853/Whose-Life-Is-It-Anyway>
 in the lead role this time of Claire Harrison – later played in the West End 
by Kim Cattrall.

Jeremy Irons
The Real Thing (1984)

Irons was hot off both Brideshead Revisited and The French Lieutenant’s Woman 
when director Mike Nichols announced the actor’s Broadway debut in a fresh 
version of Tom Stoppard’s West End hit.Irons 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pVvoy1iT9E> and co-star Glenn Close 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdeWpCC9rFE> won Tonys, as did Nichols and 
Stoppard, in what remains one of the sexiest onstage couplings I have ever 
seen. The same role of Henry, the cuckolded playwright, won a 2000 Tony for 
Stephen Dillane in a subsequentReal Thing revival, and we will soon see how 
Ewan McGregor fares in his Broadway debut in this very part,opening on 30 
October <http://www.roundabouttheatre.org/shows-events/The-Real-Thing.aspx>.

Diana Rigg
Abelard and Heloise (1971)

Dame Diana, like Dame Maggie, actually won a Tony 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpB-tbi9CYQ> for a later Broadway venture, in 
Rigg’s case the Almeida theatre production ofMedea that travelled to New York 
in 1994. But it’s herTony-nominated Broadway debut 
<http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Diana-Rigg-Keith-Michell-Abelard-Heloise-14x22-Theatre-WINDOW-CARD-Q18-/200816234490>
 opposite Keith Michell that lingers in Broadway lore, not least for prompting 
critic John Simon to remark famously of the actress’s nude scene that “she is 
built like a brick basilica with insufficient flying buttresses”. Rigg, ever 
resourceful, turned the aspersion to advantage, fashioning from Simon’s 
none-too-kind notice a book and, later, a solo play wittily titledNo Turn 
Unstoned

Rowan Atkinson
Rowan Atkinson at the Atkinson (1986)

The celebrated comic did a now legendary crash and burn when he brought an 
evening of comedy to a Broadway playhouse named after the onetimeNew York Times 
drama critic Brooks Atkinson, only tofall foul of the same paper’s then drama 
critic, Frank Rich 
<http://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/15/theater/stage-atkinson-at-the-atkinson.html>
, who memorably wrote: “WereRowan Atkinson at the Atkinson to be edited down to 
its wittiest jokes, however, even its title might have to go.” The show closed 
after a week, but not without Atkinson blaming Rich directly for its demise and 
hurling the vaunted moniker “the butcher of Broadway” in the critic’s direction.

John Gielgud
Hamlet (1936)

Truth be told, this wasn’t quite the Broadway debut of the then 32-year-old 
British stage classicist who went on to added cachet as an Oscar-winning film 
name. But so negligible by all accounts was Gielgud’s previous Broadway run in 
1928 in a play called The Patriot that it seems fair to herald his next New 
York gig,this time as Hamlet 
<http://www.performingartsarchive.com/Broadway/Hamlet_1936/Hamlet_1936.htm>, 
not least because Gielgud was the actor-knight who threaded Broadway most 
thoroughlythroughout his career 
<http://www.playbillvault.com/Person/Detail/20358/John-Gielgud>. Reviews for 
his silken-voiced Dane were mixed, but the production – billed at the time as “
Hamlet in its entirety” – was a flat-out smash.

Pauline Collins
Shirley Valentine (1989)

It’s not often that a performer gets to keep a role from the West End through 
Broadway and on to film, but that was the trajectory traced by Pauline Collins 
as Liverpudlian housewife Shirley Valentine, who talks to walls and finds love 
on holiday in Greece.The film <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_7MJQnk4M8> 
opened out the material, as was to be expected, but the play remained a solo 
venture that defied the odds – at the time, many Broadway folk thought the 
material too slight for success – and won a Tony for Collins, who at the time 
was best-known Stateside for her partas the maid, Sarah 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6XEpgBfNdg>, in Upstairs Downstairs.
