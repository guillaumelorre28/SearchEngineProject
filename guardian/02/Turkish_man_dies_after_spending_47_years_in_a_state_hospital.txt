Kozan had been allowed to stay because “he had no place to go, and he got on 
very well with staff”, hospital workers said.

The hospital’s administration registered Kozan as a new patient each time he 
was discharged at the end of a treatment.

“He was like a member of our hospital. We protected him. But we couldn’t save 
him when he got worse,” a staff member said.

Kozan’s condition deteriorated during the recent Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday.
