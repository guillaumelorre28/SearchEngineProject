Palace x Reebok: ‘Jonah Hill’ (starts at 00:04) - UK

Jonah Hill is levered unceremoniously into this commercial advertising 
skateboard apparel Palace’s collaboration with Reebok. A gloriously bad 
cavalcade of special effects missteps is used to poke fun at celebrity 
endorsements while cleverly creating one of the most effective and sincere 
performances you could hope to see.

BT Broadband: ‘Helicopter’ (starts at 02:12) - UK

After his breathless arrival onto the BT Broadband set last time round, Ryan 
Reynolds takes time out in a comfy chair to introduce the telecom giant’s new 
Smart Hub. Of course, why give a Hollywood superstar an easy ride when you can 
mount a spectacle? With a little money left over after acquiring Reynolds, the 
BT creative team procure a helicopter to showcase the strength of their new 
gadget’s WiFi signal.

Coca-Cola: ‘Rain’ (starts at 02:46) - US

Typical, eh? On the day you manage to wrangle golfing superstar Jordan Spieth 
for your advert, Mother Nature throws a wet blanket on proceedings with a 
torrential downpour. Luckily for Coca-Cola, the soft drink find creativity in 
confined conditions – namely Jordan Spieth’s trailer. In lieu of a dry practice 
range, Spieth decides his shelter for the shoot provides ample opportunity to 
keep his aim in check.

Project Everyone: ‘Wannabe’ (starts at 03:50) - UK

It’s 20 years since The Spice Girls recorded one of the most emblematic songs 
of the 1990s and – in so doing – added the term ‘Girl Power’ to the vernacular. 
The song provides the perfect vehicle for a new international movement pressing 
for positive change when it comes to discrimination against women and girls 
across the world.
