Set in 1920s London, the 23-page short story starts with the murder of rich 
and glamorous Emily French, played by Cattrall.

All evidence points to Leonard Vole, played by Billy Howle, the heir to 
French’s enormous fortune.

Riseborough will play Vole’s chorus girl partner Romaine, while Jones will 
play John Mayhew, the solicitor tasked with defending him.

Monica Dolan and Four Weddings and a Funeral actor David Haig will also star 
in the production.

It will be directed by Julian Jarrold while Phelps will serve as an executive 
producer.
