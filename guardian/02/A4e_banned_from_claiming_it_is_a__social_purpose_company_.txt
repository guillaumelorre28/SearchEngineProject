A4e <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/a4e>, the company that faced fraud 
allegations in relation to its government welfare-to-work contracts, has been 
banned from calling itself a social purpose company. The restriction is to 
ensure consumers do not mistake it for a not-for-profit organisation.

The firm's website, mya4e.com, stated: "A4e is a social purpose company with 
one sole aim. To improve people's lives around the world. We do this by helping 
them find work, skills, direction â€“ or whatever it is they need."

A complaint was made to the Advertising 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/advertising> Standards Authority (ASA) that 
the "social purpose" claim was likely to mislead consumers as to the nature of 
the business because it intended to generate a profit.

Defending the claim, A4e said the focus of its business activities was to 
"achieve positive social outcomes", adding that the majority of its revenue was 
derived from contracts aimed at achieving long-term sustainable employment 
outcomes.

The ASA said: "Whilst we noted the ad made clear it was A4e's intention to 
improve people's lives by helping them secure employment or develop skills, we 
were concerned that individuals would understand the claim to mean A4e was a 
not-for-profit organisation.

"Because we understood that that was not the case, we concluded the claim was 
likely to mislead and breached the code."

The ASA said the advert must not appear again in its current form and told A4e 
to ensure claims were not likely to mislead in future.
