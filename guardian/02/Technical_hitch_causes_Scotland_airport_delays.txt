Scotland’s main airports.

Prestwick airports had been affected by the problem at the Scottish Air Traffic 
Control centre at Prestwick on Monday.

Nats, which provides air traffic control services in the UK, said: “We have 
had a technical problem overnight with interference on some radio frequencies 
that we use to speak to aircraft.

“It only affects part of Scottish airspace and flights from some Scottish 
airports this morning may be delayed as a result. We have identified the cause, 
isolated the problem and the situation is improving. We apologise sincerely for 
any inconvenience.”


A spokesman for Edinburgh airport said: “Due to an ongoing issue at the 
Scottish airspace control centre, there will be a delay to all flights this 
morning. We are still assessing the situation but customers should expect 
delays.”

a small number of delays were affecting southbound flights but it was hoped 
they would be back to normal “as soon as possible”.

airport said flights were now beginning to leave but there were some delays.
