Today J, for JFDI... which stands for "just do it", and was the unofficial 
name of one of the development teams which sat alongside the R2 teams.

One key principle we had from the start of the project was that other 
development work couldn't stop for the sake of the site rebuild. There might be 
less of it, but it shouldn't dwindle to zero. And while R2 was a major long 
term undertaking, the rest of the work that came up inevitably had a very 
different shape. Consequently we had different kinds of teams.

The JFDI team handled very short turnaround work. Mostly this consisted of 
bugfixes, but it also included minor enhancements. It worked in a traditional 
Agile manner, but due to the size of the individual tasks work was 
reprioritised every day rather than every fortnight.

Working on the JFDI team suits some people better than others. On the one hand 
it's difficult to get your teeth stuck into anything because it doesn't last 
very long (or at least it shouldn't); on the other hand you get a sense of 
completion every day. A lot of the time people don't relish cycling into that 
team, but once they're in they find they learn a huge amount about how the 
software they've written actually gets used. I've writtenmore on this subject 
previously

.

Overall the JFDI team has been very successful, dealing with a large and 
constantly-shifting workload, but also demonstrating daily progress to our 
internal users. Since R2 finished we've kept the team running in the same mode, 
and it continues to bring immediate benefit to people inside and outside the 
development teams.
