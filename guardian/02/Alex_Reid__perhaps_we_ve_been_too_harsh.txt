Once again Lost in Showbiz can only apologise for its obsession with the 
psychological makeup ofAlex Reid <https://www.theguardian.com/media/alex-reid>, 
as it finds itself reading all the way to the end of a Best magazine interview 
with the former Mr Katie Price and his mother. In the interview, Carol Reid not 
only describes the cagefighter as "squidgy on the inside", but explains he 
slept in her bed until he was 13.

At long last â€“ the missing piece of the jigsaw. Consider Alex's story arc: 
sleeps in his mother's bed until the age of 13, lives at home with his parents 
until the age of 34, at which point he moves directly into Jordan's pink 
mansion and marries her.

It's a sort of Greystoke for the celebrity age, isn't it? Who can blame him 
for his difficulties integrating into such a strange new world? In fact, 
increasingly, I blame myself for my reaction to it all. Instead of feigning 
indifference when Alex was sneered at by that hideous Gary who trowels on 
Katie's makeup, we should have wept with pathos, just as we did when 
Christopher Lambert drinks from the soup bowl and growls at the snooty guests 
at Greystoke castle.We were the savages, noble ape-Reid. We were were the 
savages.
