Background

Tony Blair dubbed this act a "victim's justice bill 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2002/nov/21/immigrationpolicy.ukcrime>", an 
effort to rebalance the criminal justice system in favour of the victim.

This bill marked the government's second attempt to change jury trial rules. 
The first ended in failure on 28 September 2000 when the Lordsthrew out 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2000/jan/21/jurytrials.law> the criminal 
justice (mode of trial) bill 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmbills/073/2000073.htm>, 
which would have removed the right of some defendants to opt for jury trial in 
a crown court.

In addition to allowing the removal of a jury if the prosecution believed 
there was a serious risk of jury tampering, David Blunkett's draft bill 
included proposals to allow judges tohear complex fraud trials 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/jun/22/constitution.jurytrials> alone 
and plans to give defendants the option of electing for a judge-only trial.

This last measure was abandoned by the home secretary after it came under 
attack by Labour backbenchers. Vera Baird QC, the Labour MP for Redcar, said 
the choice would lead to forum shopping of "theworst imaginable kind 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031118/debtext/31118-21.htm>
", with defendants making choices about waiving their right to a jury trial on 
the basis of whether the judge had a reputation for being soft.

In order to save the bill from defeat in the House of Lords, Blunkett offered 
a series ofconcessions 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/nov/20/ukcrime.lords>, including 
limiting the kinds of fraud trials that would be affected by the legislation. 
To get the bill passed before the end of the parliamentary session, he was 
forced to pledgenot to implement 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blunkett-saves-flagship-legislation-with-climbdown-on-trial-by-jury-736451.html>
 jury-less fraud trials without a parliamentary order approving their 
introduction.

Criticism

The act's mandatory sentencing guidelines were criticised as a politicisation 
of sentencing and an unnecessary limitation on the judiciary's ability to 
exercise discretion in sentencing. Ken MacDonald, the director of public 
prosecutions, criticised as "grotesque 
<http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1154279.ece>" the effect of 
the act's intention to introduce longer minimum jail sentences. McDonald 
suggested the act would have an "extraordinary effect on the numbers in jail". 
Lord Woolf, Britain's chief justice described mandatory sentencing a "
politician's knee-jerk 
<http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/publications_media/speeches/pre_2004/lcj090403.htm>
 reaction to a particularly serious incident".

Liberty criticised the abolishment of the bar on double jeopardy. It described 
the proposal as making every acquittal for a serious offence conditional and 
argued that "whatever safeguards the government proposes to limit media 
coverage, it is difficult to see how a well-known defendant would be able to 
receive a fair trial".

Proposals to limit jury trials succeeded in uniting opposition from the 
judiciary, legal profession and civil rights groups. MPs argued that the act 
restricted a fundamental right to jury trial by one's peers.

The shadow home secretary, Oliver Letwin, said: "Trial by jury involves 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/jul/15/immigrationpolicy.ukcrime> the 
participation of the ordinary citizen in the business of law, so preventing the 
court from becoming a matter of the state and opposing the citizen. That is 
critical to the deepest foundations of our liberal democracy.

"We believe that, by encroaching on the right to trial by jury in the areas 
set out in the criminal justice bill, the government may be setting a precedent 
which could erode the scope for trial by jury in other areas.

"We are on a very slippery and dangerous slope."
