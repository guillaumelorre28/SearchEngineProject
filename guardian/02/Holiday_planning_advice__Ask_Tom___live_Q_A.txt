Perhaps you need practical assistance planning a specific holiday or would 
simply like help deciding where to go this year for sun, relaxation or 
adventure? Tom will be online at 1pm GMT on Wednesday, replying to your 
questions on any travel queries you have. Please post your comment below.

Tom will get to as many questions as he can in an hour, but due to the volume 
of questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
