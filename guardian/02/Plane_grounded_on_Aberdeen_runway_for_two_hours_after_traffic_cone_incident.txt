A British Airways <https://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairways> flight 
from Aberdeen to London was delayed for almost two hours after a traffic cone 
became wedged beneath the aircraft.

Engineers could remove the item to inspect the damage only by disembarking all 
the plane’s passengers and luggage. Claire Buckley, a passenger on the flight, 
said the captain “sounded genuinely stunned” that such an occurrence could have 
happened as he gave them updates.

They were eventually told the “skin” of the aircraft had not been pierced, a 
dent made by the cone had “popped back out” and the flight had been cleared for 
take off.

A spokeswoman for British Airways said: “The safety of our customers and crew 
is always our top priority. Our highly trained engineers inspected the aircraft 
before it continued on its journey. We are sorry for the delay to customers’ 
travel plans.”
