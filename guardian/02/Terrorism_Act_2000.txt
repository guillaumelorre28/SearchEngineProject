"To make provision about terrorism 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_1#Legislation-Preamble>
; and to make temporary provision for Northern Ireland about the prosecution 
and punishment of certain offences, the preservation of peace and the 
maintenance of order."

MAIN PROVISIONS

• Replaces temporary legislation first passed in the 1970s to combat terrorism 
in Northern Ireland: the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 
1989, the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, and parts of the 
Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998.
• Widens the definition of terrorism to apply to domestic terrorism as well as 
international terrorism and terrorism related to Northern Ireland.
• Expands the definition of terrorism. Formerly defined as "violence for 
political ends", it now includes action, used or threatened, for the purpose of 
advancing any "political, religious or ideological" cause. In 2008 this was 
extended to include a "racial" cause. Action is defined as including: violence 
against a person, damage to property, serious risk to the health or safety of 
the public or a section of the public and behaviour designed seriously to 
interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system. All subsequent 
powers for the police and courts flow from this definition.
• Allows the police to detain people arrested for terrorism offences for seven 
days. (This was later amended.)
• Gives the secretary of state the power to proscribe organisations, and set 
out a range of offences connected with proscribed organisations.
• Creates offences associated with financing and support for terrorism, as 
well as criminalising specified offences such as possessing information for 
terrorism or inciting overseas terrorism.
• Grants the police the power to stop and search 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_5#pt5-pb2-l1g44> a 
person or a vehicle without suspicion if the police are operating in an 
designated area under special authorisation.
• Allows Northern Ireland to continue using non-jury trials for certain terror 
offences.

BACKGROUND

The act emanates from recommendations made by Lord Lloyd of Berwick, who led 
an inquiry for the Conservative government in 1996 into the need for permanent 
terrorist legislation following the IRA ceasefire.

Lord Lloyd recommended reform of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary 
Provisions) Act <http://www.cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/pta1974.htm>, emergency 
provisions created in 1974 for Northern Ireland. Originally intended to last 
just six months, the act – which required annual renewal in the House of 
Commons – endured for 25 years and was updated by the Conservatives in 1984 and 
1989 to include international terrorism.

Although the Labour government ignored one of Lord Lloyd's key 
recommendations, that legislation against terrorism should closely approximate 
ordinary criminal law and procedure, they followed his guidance that the 
definition of terrorism should include the term "violence". What proved to be 
controversial was the government's decision to create a wider definition of 
terrorism that included the use of "serious violence 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/plain/ukpga_20000011_en#pt> against 
persons or property".

Parliamentary critics claimed that this change would put people who dig up 
genetically modified crops in the same category as an IRA bomber and could be 
used to stifle legitimate protest.

Jack Straw, home secretary, cast the act as a timely replacement for the 
Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989. He described it as "simply protecting 
democracy <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1999/dec/14/jackstraw.labour>" by 
consolidating previous anti-terror measures.

MPs pointed out that in addition to its raft of new powers the act makes 
permanent many key elements of the Prevention of Terrorism Act brought in by 
the Tories. They accused Straw of undergoing a "Damascene conversion 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1999/dec/14/jackstraw.labour>" since his 
days in opposition when he voted against the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

Although the home secretary said the act would not threaten peaceful 
demonstrations or protests that "unaccountably turn ugly", Charles Clarke, then 
home office minister, gave a broader definition, claiming the bill would target 
those who seek to "undermine democratic processes by the use of violence".

Many MPs expressed misgivings about the possible impact – whether deliberate 
or accidental – of the legislation. They feared the law granted the government 
permanent powers to curb political protest, and were concerned in particular by 
the decision to allow the home secretary to outlaw organisations believed to be 
involved in terrorism.Once a group is proscribed 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1999/dec/15/politicalnews.politics> it is 
an offence to belong to it, give it money or wear its symbols in public.

CRITICISM

Civil liberties groups were outraged by the government's decision to add names 
to the previous list of proscribed Irish organisations. They argued the law 
could be used against legitimate opposition groups or foreign dissidents who, 
having no democratic avenue for dissent under repressive regimes, move to the 
United Kingdom. The act makes it possible for UK-based activistscampaigning for 
change <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/feb/20/humanrights.uksecurity> to be 
labelled terrorists. Commentators argued that had the powers been in place 
during the Thatcher government, they could have madesupporting Nelson Mandela 
illegal <http://www.newstatesman.com/200104230010>. 

Liberty said 
<http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/1-press-releases/2001/misguided-act-could-create-thousands-of-new-.shtml>
: "There is a real danger that refugees and others who have fled repressive 
regimes to the safety of this country will become a legitimate target of the 
police merely because they support the overthrow of that regime, even if they 
themselves are opposed to violence."

Section 44 has drawn heavy criticism from protesters who claim the police have 
used the power toinfringe the right <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4786456.stm> 
to peaceful protest, a claim rejected by the law lords. However the use and 
misuse of stop and search remains controversial. When Walter Wolfgang was
forcibly removed 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/oct/03/terrorism.immigrationpolicy> 
from the audience during Jack Straw's speech to the 2005 Labour party 
conference, police used Section 44 powers to prevent him from returning to the 
conference.

Liberty argues that Section 44 is too broadly drafted and that as a result it 
has "been abused to intimidate protesters at peaceful demonstrations which did 
not present a terrorist threat". Liberty hasproduced a guide
