Knock knock. Who’s there? Tim. Tim who? Lord Tim Bell, the ad man who made a 
gratuitous joke about the Germanwings air crash on BBC Radio 5 Live that 
prompted criticism from listeners and an apology from presenterAdrian Chiles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/adrian-chiles>.

The Tory peer who once advised Margaret Thatcher said he would refrain from 
telling the joke because he “would be shot”, in a discussion about negative 
political advertising, before doing exactly that.

“Knock knock. Who’s there? The pilot.”

Bell, chairman of PR business Bell Pottinger, said it was a “terrible joke” 
but not so terrible that he was not consumed by guilty laughter around2 hours 
and 50 minutes into <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05qdx4v> Chiles’ 5 Live 
morning show on Tuesday.

“The truth is that if you think about humour, most humour is at the expense of 
somebody,” he told Chiles. “There is a current terrible joke going around, a 
knock knock joke, at the moment which I’m not going to do on air because I’ll 
probably get shot.”

“That’s an awful one,” replied Chiles. “Obviously apologies to any listeners 
who were offended by Lord Tim Bell’s ‘joke’ – in inverted commas – earlier.”
