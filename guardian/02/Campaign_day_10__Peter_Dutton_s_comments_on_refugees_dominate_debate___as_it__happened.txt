Good night and good luck

Well, I think that’s all I can give to campaign Wednesday, with all the usual 
thanks to colleagues and salutations to the readers.

Let’s take stock of the day before drifting off in the direction of our 
evenings.

So, Wednesday:

 * The immigration minister, Peter Dutton’s, decision to dial Australia’s 
toxic refugee politics up to eleven reverberated through the day.

 * The prime minister had a choice today: back in Dutton or differentiate, and 
Malcolm Turnbull chose to back in the immigration minister, albeit with more 
diplomacy.

 * The opposition leader also had a choice: go hard against Dutton or tamp it 
all down and try and hug the Coalition in the areas of agreement between the 
major parties, which has been Labor’s principle political strategy when it 
comes to boats policy.Bill Shorten did not play safe, he went after Dutton and 
Turnbull, either because Dutton had moved the needle too far, or because 
Shorten felt his strongest pitch on the day was direct to the progressive base 
rather than pandering to conservative populism.

 * It was an interesting contrast between the two leaders: Malcolm Turnbull, 
who has traded on his conviction and principle, went full pragmatism.Bill 
Shorten, who trades on his pragmatism, went full principle.

 * Who says this campaign is boring? Not me, that much is certain.

 * Additionally, Labor’s David Feeney forgot to properly declare he owned a 
$2m house, which was profoundly dumb, and the Greens, who dearly want his 
Victorian seat, came after him like the devil was at their heels.

 * The National Press Club hosted a policy debate about climate change, in 
whichGreg Hunt pretended he would not need a great big whack of taxpayers’ 
money to bankroll his Direct Action plan, andMark Butler threw some shade while 
pointing out it would be good if the major parties could find some common 
ground on policies safeguarding the future of the planet and the people it 
supports.

 * Labor has some money for Sydney infrastructure and produced a gas policy 
that I remain deeply dubious about and the Coalition was eyes on north 
Queensland, with a sweep through Cairns and Townsville.

I’ll be back for Thursday, but a little later than normal, because I must do 
some recording for our podcast. Until I surface you’ll be in the capable hands 
ofBridie Jabour. See you then.

Mark Textor says Peter Dutton did not go too far in his remarks

Readers with me all day know that earlier on, I was conversing with the 
Liberal party’s pollster,Mark Textor, about Peter Dutton, and whether not he 
went too far.

Textor didn’t answer my question until now. Here’s the answer: no, the 
immigration minister did not go too far.
Mark Textor (@TextorMark) 
@marcuskelson <https://twitter.com/marcuskelson> @BenDohertyCorro 
<https://twitter.com/BenDohertyCorro> @KKeneally <https://twitter.com/KKeneally>
@murpharoo <https://twitter.com/murpharoo> no. he didn’t go to far
 <https://twitter.com/TextorMark/status/732819105938571264> May 18, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/TextorMark/status/732819105938571264> 
Presumably my question was impossible to answer before the prime minister set 
the tone. GivenMalcolm Turnbull has backed in Dutton, Textor will now express a 
view in public.

The conversation is turning now to immigration and Peter Dutton. Dastyari is 
on this afternoon with the Liberal SenatorArthur Sinodinos. Both of the guests 
are migrants.

Dastyari says when he arrived as a five year old with his parents who were 
fleeing conflict in Iran, he couldn’t speak a word on English. The Labor man 
says he’s personally offended byPeter Dutton’s comments. Sinodinos says he 
didn’t learn English until he went to school because the family only spoke 
Greek at home. He says Dastyari is entitled to feel however he likes about the 
Dutton remarks, but what voters need to focus on is this imminent Labor/Greens 
alliance. Dastyari says hang on a minute, you are the people doing a preference 
deal with the Greens.

Sky News has been unhappy for most of the afternoon because Labor’s David 
Feeneywas due to be on a program this afternoon and he’s pulled out. Labor’s 
Sam Dastyari has stepped in instead.

So now we have one of those television moments where the stand in has to cop 
the shellacking that Sky had been planning for Feeney, who has evidently been 
shoved into a cupboard in Labor campaign headquarters or inside a safe house 
somewhere courtesy of the fact he forgot to properly declare that he owned a 
$2m house, and Labor’s campaign brains trust would evidently like it if the 
forgetful candidate would just shut up and stay well out of sight.

Sky’s Laura Jayes wants to know why Feeney isn’t turning up. Dastyari says 
because your office called me and asked me to come on. Well why didn’tDavid 
Feeney come on, Jayes wonders.

Sam Dastyari:

That’s a matter for David.

You are fortunate enough to have me.

Christopher Pyne was asked for his view on Peter Dutton’s remarks on asylum 
seekers stealing Aussie jobs on Adelaide radio earlier today. Pyne stepped 
through that fairly carefully.

Q: They won’t be numerate, they won’t be literate, they’ll be innumerate and 
they will take our jobs, are they sentiments that you share Christopher Pyne?

Christopher Pyne:

Well Will, the answer to the issues to do with asylum seekers around the world 
is not to simply keep doubling our intake of refugees…

Q: No, I asked whether you agreed with Peter Dutton’s comments…


Christopher Pyne:

Well I’m answering the question, and we already have the second most generous 
program to take refugees in the world, but obviously there are very complex 
issues when you take a large number of refugees from war torn countries. They 
need to have a proper settlement process which often involves English language 
learning, teachings in literacy and numeracy, resettlement, cultural 
understandings. You can’t just bring people to Australia from refugee camps 
around the world and expect them to suddenly, you know be instantaneously part 
of the society. You need to put them through a proper process where they can 
become full Australian citizens eventually, and know exactly how our community 
and our and society works, and that’s what he is saying.

Q: But that’s much more diplomatic, Chris, that’s a much more diplomatic way 
of saying that. I mean, do you think that the rhetoric he used was a bit brutal 
and do you think that he may have perhaps turned up the volume because it’s 
election time?

Christopher Pyne:

No, I don’t think that’s what he was doing. I think he was trying to say that 
obviously we can’t just keep doubling the refugee intake, it’s a very expensive 
program, like very expensive, and there needs to be proper resettlement of 
refugees when they come to Australia. Australia does this really well, and I’m 
sure Anthony will agree on a bipartisan basis that we do the resettlement of 
refugees extremely well, but the issues that are dogging the Labor party at 
this election are not about the resettlement of refugees. They’re about the 
fact that a large number of people in the Labor party support onshore, rather 
than offshore processing and would restart the people smuggler’s business, now 
that is what happened under the Rudd government, despite the protests in 2007 
that wouldn’t happen, and we got 800 boat arrivals, 50,000 unauthorised 
arrivals, and people opening up detention centres. I mean we’ve closed 16 of 
Labor’s detention centres, because we actually have a successful policy, and 
Tanya Plibersek confused us all again yesterday when she said that she and the 
21 support the Labor party’s policy, not the Liberal party’s policy, wellBill 
Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> says the 
policies are the same, so who’s right?

Back to Labor’s gas policy, which I’m still not happy about, even though I 
still haven’t had time to dive deeply enough to have a proper view. Just some 
more from the questions and answers at today’s press conference with the shadow 
treasurerChris Bowen.

Q: On your gas policy, are you talking about quotas for the domestic gas 
market?

Chris Bowen:

No, what I’m talking about is a proponent of a new facility or expansion of an 
existing facility making the case to the Treasurer of the day about why it is 
in the national interest, and part of that national interest consideration is 
how much gas would be available for Australian manufacturing, which is my focus 
today – of course – Australian households as well, but particularly 
manufacturing, because these fantastic workers here know that they rely, and 
their company relies, on a clear and consistent gas supply. You’ve got 
manufacturers right across Australia who are saying they just can’t get gas. 
The Australian Industry Group has done a good job in building the case for this 
sort of reform, as has the Australian Workers Union and others. This is an 
example of Labor’s cooperative approach, bringing together people in the 
sector, and working on practical solutions for the future.

Q: How does this sit with the ACCC recommendation that there should be no 
reservations?

Chris Bowen:

This is not a reservation, to be clear, this is a national interest test. They 
are dealing with similar issues. The treasurer of the day would be talking to 
proponents and saying where is something here for the manufacturing sector, 
tell us how you are going to cater for this, and through what I’m sure would be 
a cooperative process, the national interest be best served.


Q: What would be the criteria for rejecting an LNG project that is, 
supposedly, in the national interest?

Chris Bowen:

If it’s in the national interest it would be approved, that’s the point. 
Similar to the foreign interest national interest test, the Treasurer would be 
the ultimate arbiter. A Treasurer would take into account a vibrant and growing 
resources sector, a vibrant and growing manufacturing sector, impact on 
households, and of course, existing environmental approvals would be unaffected.

Q: What is the criteria for rejecting a proposal?

Chris Bowen:

If the treasurer was not satisfied it was in the national interest, just like 
foreign investment. It’s not a tick the box exercise, it’s a process where the 
treasurer uses their judgement whether the national interest is being served.

Q: Is there a danger that this could reduce investment in the domestic gas 
market?

Chris Bowen:

I don’t believe so. These sorts of tests apply in the United States, where the 
gas industry has been growing very strongly. Of course, not everybody will 
approve of this, some people will say this goes too far, some people in the 
sector would prefer no regulation. I accept that, I know that, I’ve had those 
discussions, but we set the policy settings for the nation in the national 
interest, not in any vested interest. I’ve got to tell you, having a good and 
vibrant manufacturing sector is in the national interest.

Q: You mention the AWU, is this Labor simply doing the AWU’s work?

Chris Bowen:

The AWU has run a campaign for dealing with gas, as has the Australian 
Industry Group, Manufacturing Australia, the Aluminium Council – they’re not 
affiliated to theLabor party

Bernard Keane in Crikey this afternoon 
<http://www.crikey.com.au/2016/05/18/refugees-do-not-take-our-jobs/#loggedin> 
(for subscribers, do subscribe) notes that refugees are exactly the kind of 
people that Turnbull’s innovative, agile Australia apparently wants. Yes it’s 
true that it costs money to resettle them, but the investment pays off over 
time.

Here’s an excerpt.

Refugees <https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees> — because they’ve been 
forced to move rather than voluntarily decided to migrate; because they usually 
can’t access their assets in their home country; because they haven’t developed 
skills with the goal of being employable in a different culture; because they 
often suffer from mental health problems created by the circumstances that 
forced them to flee — require assistance when they resettle. They require 
assistance to learn English, to acquire skills, to adjust to living in a 
different culture and economy, to educate their children (children make up a 
higher proportion of refugees than other migrant categories).

Once they acquire jobs, it’s possible it may be 20 years 
<http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21688938-europes-new-arrivals-will-probably-dent-public-finances-not-wages-good-or>
 before they pay enough income tax to bring the taxpayer out ahead in net 
terms. However, there’s little evidence from Europe that large numbers of 
refugees depress wages. Reported effects of low-skilled migrants on wages,The 
Economist found, were slight.

And refugees, according to a 2011 report 
<https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/01_2014/economic-social-civic-contributions-booklet2011.pdf>
, have lower workforce participation levels than Australian-born citizens (so, 
actually, they don’t compete for jobs as much as the rest of us do), but that 
improves over time and refugees who complete their education in Australia 
actually havehigher workforce participation rates than Australian-born people — 
as do the children of refugees when they reach working age. And refugees highly 
value education; they and their children havemuch higher rates of tertiary 
education than Australian-born people.

Refugees also tend to be more entrepreneurial than the rest of us. Census data 
has shown higher proportions of owner/managers among refugee communities than 
Australian-born citizens — usually among longer-established communities, but 
also among more recent arrivals like the Somali community.

A bit more detail about Labor’s gas policy unveiled earlier today. The 
opposition is promising to establish a Domestic Gas Review Board to consider 
whether any new gas export facility, or proposal to expand an existing one, 
would meet Australia’s national interest.

It would also require foreign gas companies to say how much gas they plan to 
make available for local manufacturers and households.

But the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has stopped short of calling for gas 
quotas to be introduced to force energy companies to sell an agreed amount of 
gas to local manufacturers.

“Natural gas belongs to all Australians. We want to ensure it’s extracted in 
the national interest,” Bowen said on Wednesday. “We want to ensure that we 
don’t face a situation in the future, as has been predicted, that more and more 
manufacturing facilities face closure, not only because of the price of gas but 
because they just can’t get any gas.”

The proposed Domestic Gas Review Board would operate in a similar way to the 
Foreign Investment Review Board <https://firb.gov.au/>, which considers the 
national benefit of foreign investment proposals. It would require energy 
companies to demonstrate how their newly-expanded export facilities would boost 
Australia’s exports and national income, increase the overall gas supply and 
deliver a “predictable and affordable source of gas” for local manufacturers.

Labor’s new policy will go some way to placating demands from the Australian 
Workers’ Union to reserve a proportion of Australia’s gas for domestic use at 
affordable prices.

The AWU’s national secretary, Scott McDine, said the AWU has been leading the 
Reserve Our Gas campaign 
<http://www.reserveourgas.com.au/how_would_a_gas_reservation_policy_work> that 
has been pushing for the government to legislate and create the option to 
reserve natural gas for domestic use.

“Australia finds itself the only developed nation on the planet which allows 
gas exporters to extract our gas and sell it to the highest international 
bidder without any restriction whatsoever,” McDine said.

“Australian households and industry are being forced to match the highest 
international prices for our own gas.

Meanwhile, looking southwards, the Liberal party’s Indi candidate, Sophie 
Mirabella, has been cut loose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/18/australian-election-sophie-mirabella-coalition-indi-nationals-liberals>
 by the Coalition.

The deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce has been openly mocking her and senior 
government sources claim she has been starved ofLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> funding apart from 
that which she can raise locally.

The developments suggest both sides of the Coalition have written off 
Mirabella’s chances of regaining the seat from independent MPCathy McGowan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/cathy-mcgowan>.


Two days ago Mirabella accused some in the Liberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> of destablising her 
campaign on the ABC’s 7.30.

“What do they say? If you want a friend in politics, get a dog … Let others be 
concerned about internecine affairs, I’ll worry about Indi,” Mirabella said.


At a party event in Indi on Tuesday night for Nationals candidate Marty Corboy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/16/indis-national-hopeful-some-people-are-rapt-to-have-a-man-to-vote-for?CMP=share_btn_tw>
, Joyce told members and supporters the people of Indi wanted someone in 
Canberra who would allow them they say “I feel proud of him”.


“I don’t want to talk too much about the other candidates, they can talk for 
themselves and they did an exceptionally good job of that last night [on 
7.30],” Joyce said. “What I can say is the more they talk, the better you look 
Marty.”

My colleague Lenore Taylor on the day’s asylum developments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/18/when-peter-dutton-insults-refugees-he-insults-the-australian-people>
. This comment piece could have been headlined stop the stupid.

There’s the entry-level scare campaign, the one that has been running all 
week, that says that because Labor candidates and MPs have expressed concerns 
about the humanitarian consequences of our offshore detention centres a Labor 
government would inevitably “restart the boats”.

But are those concerns really heresy, or a reasonable response to the horror 
stories flooding in from both Manus Island and Nauru, of rape and self-harm and 
self-immolation? Is it really bad to have some qualms about camps that have 
been declared illegal by the Papua New Guinean supreme court and condemned by 
the United Nations?

If the Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> is so 
totally unperturbed by those things, if it thinks the policy is “working” in 
every respect, then what is its answer to its obvious humanitarian failings? 
What is it planning to do with the people in those camps? Because they are the 
ones who are really “languishing” in sanity-sapping uncertainty.

Turnbull said at the outset of his prime ministership he “sympathised with, 
and grieved for” the “mental anguish” of those in detention and promised he 
would do everything possible to find a resettlement solution.

But no “solution” has been found. Does Bill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> have a problem 
because some in his party are worried about this bipartisan policy failure, or 
does Turnbull have a problem because (at least according to the Coalition’s own 
telling) his own MPs are not?

An ungloved fist, and a fist in a velvet glove

I reckon this is worth a little side by side exercise.

Peter Dutton, last night, on Sky News

For many people, they won’t be numerate or literate in their own language, let 
alone English, and this is a difficulty because the Greens are very close to 
the CFMEU, as obviously the Labor Party is, and their affiliations with the 
union movement obviously are well known.

Now, these people would be taking Australian jobs, there’s no question about 
that, and for many of them that would be unemployed, they would languish in 
unemployment queues and on Medicare and the rest of it. So, there would be a 
huge cost, and there’s no sense in sugar-coating that, that’s the scenario.

Now, we have a managed program at the moment, it’s 13,750 a year that we bring 
in through the refugee program, but we don’t bring people and we will not 
settle people who come off boats. Now, one of the little known policies that 
Labor has put forward in this election campaign is that they want to double 
that number from 13,750 up to over 27,000 people. Now, that’s to try and buy 
off the left and hope in a campaign that they wouldn’t break out the way in 
which we’ve seen now more than 25 candidates do, that have broken out against 
Labor’s policy.

But, as I say, there’s no sense pretending, Paul, that if you said, ‘Look, 
we’re going to be super generous and take 50,000 and that will stop people 
smugglers putting people on boats’, it’s a nonsense, because we know that there 
are hundreds of thousands frankly who would trek down through Malaysia into 
Indonesia that otherwise would have seen the door open in Europe and would now 
see the door open to our country, and it would be an absolute green light.

And, you know, Paul, I think in the run up to this election people want first 
and foremost from their leader, from a prospective prime minister, they want 
somebody with strength of character. They want somebody that has the ability to 
keep their families and our community safe, and I think Bill Shorten has failed 
that test. He’s demonstrated that he doesn’t have the mettle to stand up to his 
own backbench let alone to people smugglers and terrorists that would seek to 
do us harm that might seek to cross our borders, and I thinkMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> demonstrated 
again today that he has the ability, the absolute determination to make sure 
that we keep our borders secure, and if we do that, we can keep our community 
safe.

Malcolm Turnbull, Townsville:

Peter Dutton <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/peter-dutton> is an 
outstanding immigration minister. For more than 600 days, there has not been 
one successful people smuggling operation bringing unauthorised arrivals to 
Australia. He has done an outstanding job as immigration minister.

Let me say something about our immigration program. We are one of the most 
generous host countries for refugees. We take our responsibilities to refugees 
very seriously. As Peter was saying earlier today, many of them come to 
Australia from shattered areas of the world. They are from dreadful, 
devastated, war-torn regions of the world and many of them, large percentages 
of them have no English skills at all. Many of them are illiterate in their own 
language. Many haven’t completed high school. That is no fault of theirs. That 
is why we are reaching out to help them with compassion. What we do, in a way 
that many other countries do not, we invest $800m a year in ensuring they get 
the settlement services they need so they learn English, so they are integrated 
into our society. That is why we are the most successful multicultural society 
in the world.

Our immigration program is built on a pillar of compassion which means that we 
take the refugees and their needs seriously and we invest in them. What the
Labor party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> is 
proposing to do, as you know, is to double the refugee intake. That is 
presumably a gesture to the Greens who want to quadruple it. But they have made 
no estimation of what the additional cost would be. It will run into billions 
of dollars.

Nor have they considered whether we have the capacity in our settlement 
services to ensure those additional refugees are settled here. To conclude on 
this point, we should never forget this - our success as a multicultural 
nation, our success depends upon secure borders. Australians accept this high 
level of refugee intake, this large humanitarian program because they know that 
their government keeps their borders secure. We keep the borders secure. Peter 
Dutton, as immigration minister, is keeping the borders secure. Mr Shorten on 
the other hand, leads a party that is utterly divided on this issue and would, 
once again, were they to be in government, once again fail Australians at the 
border.

Same message, Dutton’s is delivered with an ungloved fist, Turnbull’s is 
delivered as a fist in a velvet glove.

The prime minister’s tone is different to the immigration minister’s tone, and 
Malcolm Turnbull declined to repeat the Dutton suggestion that asylum seekers 
would take Australian jobs, he said the government wanted humanitarian entrants 
to get jobs, which is the same clean up formulation thatJulie Bishop deployed 
earlier today, but he’s otherwise locked and loaded on the political strategy, 
which is beat the boats drum, just beat it a little more quietly, everything 
being relative.

Well, I think that’s all I can give to campaign Wednesday, with all the usual 
thanks to colleagues and salutations to the readers.

Let’s take stock of the day before drifting off in the direction of our 
evenings.

for the Guardian 
So, Wednesday:

 * The immigration minister, Peter Dutton’s, decision to dial Australia’s 
toxic refugee politics up to eleven reverberated through the day.

 * The prime minister had a choice today: back in Dutton or differentiate, and 
Malcolm Turnbull chose to back in the immigration minister, albeit with more 
diplomacy.

 * The opposition leader also had a choice: go hard against Dutton or tamp it 
all down and try and hug the Coalition in the areas of agreement between the 
major parties, which has been Labor’s principle political strategy when it 
comes to boats policy.Bill Shorten did not play safe, he went after Dutton and 
Turnbull, either because Dutton had moved the needle too far, or because 
Shorten felt his strongest pitch on the day was direct to the progressive base 
rather than pandering to conservative populism.

 * It was an interesting contrast between the two leaders: Malcolm Turnbull, 
who has traded on his conviction and principle, went full pragmatism.Bill 
Shorten, who trades on his pragmatism, went full principle.

 * Who says this campaign is boring? Not me, that much is certain.

 * Additionally, Labor’s David Feeney forgot to properly declare he owned a 
$2m house, which was profoundly dumb, and the Greens, who dearly want his 
Victorian seat, came after him like the devil was at their heels.

 * The National Press Club hosted a policy debate about climate change, in 
whichGreg Hunt pretended he would not need a great big whack of taxpayers’ 
money to bankroll his Direct Action plan, andMark Butler threw some shade while 
pointing out it would be good if the major parties could find some common 
ground on policies safeguarding the future of the planet and the people it 
supports.

 * Labor has some money for Sydney infrastructure and produced a gas policy 
that I remain deeply dubious about and the Coalition was eyes on north 
Queensland, with a sweep through Cairns and Townsville.

I’ll be back for Thursday, but a little later than normal, because I must do 
some recording for our podcast. Until I surface you’ll be in the capable hands 
ofBridie Jabour. See you then.

 
Readers with me all day know that earlier on, I was conversing with the 
Liberal party’s pollster,Mark Textor, about Peter Dutton, and whether not he 
went too far.

Textor didn’t answer my question until now. Here’s the answer: no, the 
immigration minister did not go too far.
Mark Textor (@TextorMark)

<https://twitter.com/BenDohertyCorro> @KKeneally <https://twitter.com/KKeneally>
@murpharoo <https://twitter.com/murpharoo> no. he didn’t go to far

<https://twitter.com/TextorMark/status/732819105938571264> 
Presumably my question was impossible to answer before the prime minister set 
the tone. GivenMalcolm Turnbull has backed in Dutton, Textor will now express a 
view in public.
 
The conversation is turning now to immigration and Peter Dutton. Dastyari is 
on this afternoon with the Liberal SenatorArthur Sinodinos. Both of the guests 
are migrants.

Dastyari says when he arrived as a five year old with his parents who were 
fleeing conflict in Iran, he couldn’t speak a word on English. The Labor man 
says he’s personally offended byPeter Dutton’s comments. Sinodinos says he 
didn’t learn English until he went to school because the family only spoke 
Greek at home. He says Dastyari is entitled to feel however he likes about the 
Dutton remarks, but what voters need to focus on is this imminent Labor/Greens 
alliance. Dastyari says hang on a minute, you are the people doing a preference 
deal with the Greens.
 
Sky News has been unhappy for most of the afternoon because Labor’s David 
Feeneywas due to be on a program this afternoon and he’s pulled out. Labor’s 
Sam Dastyari has stepped in instead.

So now we have one of those television moments where the stand in has to cop 
the shellacking that Sky had been planning for Feeney, who has evidently been 
shoved into a cupboard in Labor campaign headquarters or inside a safe house 
somewhere courtesy of the fact he forgot to properly declare that he owned a 
$2m house, and Labor’s campaign brains trust would evidently like it if the 
forgetful candidate would just shut up and stay well out of sight.

Sky’s Laura Jayes wants to know why Feeney isn’t turning up. Dastyari says 
because your office called me and asked me to come on. Well why didn’tDavid 
Feeney come on, Jayes wonders.

Sam Dastyari:

That’s a matter for David.

You are fortunate enough to have me.
 
Christopher Pyne was asked for his view on Peter Dutton’s remarks on asylum 
seekers stealing Aussie jobs on Adelaide radio earlier today. Pyne stepped 
through that fairly carefully.

Q: They won’t be numerate, they won’t be literate, they’ll be innumerate and 
they will take our jobs, are they sentiments that you share Christopher Pyne?

Christopher Pyne:

Well Will, the answer to the issues to do with asylum seekers around the world 
is not to simply keep doubling our intake of refugees…

Q: No, I asked whether you agreed with Peter Dutton’s comments…


Christopher Pyne:

Well I’m answering the question, and we already have the second most generous 
program to take refugees in the world, but obviously there are very complex 
issues when you take a large number of refugees from war torn countries. They 
need to have a proper settlement process which often involves English language 
learning, teachings in literacy and numeracy, resettlement, cultural 
understandings. You can’t just bring people to Australia from refugee camps 
around the world and expect them to suddenly, you know be instantaneously part 
of the society. You need to put them through a proper process where they can 
become full Australian citizens eventually, and know exactly how our community 
and our and society works, and that’s what he is saying.

Q: But that’s much more diplomatic, Chris, that’s a much more diplomatic way 
of saying that. I mean, do you think that the rhetoric he used was a bit brutal 
and do you think that he may have perhaps turned up the volume because it’s 
election time?

Christopher Pyne:

No, I don’t think that’s what he was doing. I think he was trying to say that 
obviously we can’t just keep doubling the refugee intake, it’s a very expensive 
program, like very expensive, and there needs to be proper resettlement of 
refugees when they come to Australia. Australia does this really well, and I’m 
sure Anthony will agree on a bipartisan basis that we do the resettlement of 
refugees extremely well, but the issues that are dogging the Labor party at 
this election are not about the resettlement of refugees. They’re about the 
fact that a large number of people in the Labor party support onshore, rather 
than offshore processing and would restart the people smuggler’s business, now 
that is what happened under the Rudd government, despite the protests in 2007 
that wouldn’t happen, and we got 800 boat arrivals, 50,000 unauthorised 
arrivals, and people opening up detention centres. I mean we’ve closed 16 of 
Labor’s detention centres, because we actually have a successful policy, and 
Tanya Plibersek confused us all again yesterday when she said that she and the 
21 support the Labor party’s policy, not the Liberal party’s policy, wellBill 
Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> says the 
policies are the same, so who’s right?
 
Back to Labor’s gas policy, which I’m still not happy about, even though I 
still haven’t had time to dive deeply enough to have a proper view. Just some 
more from the questions and answers at today’s press conference with the shadow 
treasurerChris Bowen.

Q: On your gas policy, are you talking about quotas for the domestic gas 
market?

Chris Bowen:

No, what I’m talking about is a proponent of a new facility or expansion of an 
existing facility making the case to the Treasurer of the day about why it is 
in the national interest, and part of that national interest consideration is 
how much gas would be available for Australian manufacturing, which is my focus 
today – of course – Australian households as well, but particularly 
manufacturing, because these fantastic workers here know that they rely, and 
their company relies, on a clear and consistent gas supply. You’ve got 
manufacturers right across Australia who are saying they just can’t get gas. 
The Australian Industry Group has done a good job in building the case for this 
sort of reform, as has the Australian Workers Union and others. This is an 
example of Labor’s cooperative approach, bringing together people in the 
sector, and working on practical solutions for the future.

Q: How does this sit with the ACCC recommendation that there should be no 
reservations?

Chris Bowen:

This is not a reservation, to be clear, this is a national interest test. They 
are dealing with similar issues. The treasurer of the day would be talking to 
proponents and saying where is something here for the manufacturing sector, 
tell us how you are going to cater for this, and through what I’m sure would be 
a cooperative process, the national interest be best served.


Q: What would be the criteria for rejecting an LNG project that is, 
supposedly, in the national interest?

Chris Bowen:

If it’s in the national interest it would be approved, that’s the point. 
Similar to the foreign interest national interest test, the Treasurer would be 
the ultimate arbiter. A Treasurer would take into account a vibrant and growing 
resources sector, a vibrant and growing manufacturing sector, impact on 
households, and of course, existing environmental approvals would be unaffected.

Q: What is the criteria for rejecting a proposal?

Chris Bowen:

If the treasurer was not satisfied it was in the national interest, just like 
foreign investment. It’s not a tick the box exercise, it’s a process where the 
treasurer uses their judgement whether the national interest is being served.

Q: Is there a danger that this could reduce investment in the domestic gas 
market?

Chris Bowen:

I don’t believe so. These sorts of tests apply in the United States, where the 
gas industry has been growing very strongly. Of course, not everybody will 
approve of this, some people will say this goes too far, some people in the 
sector would prefer no regulation. I accept that, I know that, I’ve had those 
discussions, but we set the policy settings for the nation in the national 
interest, not in any vested interest. I’ve got to tell you, having a good and 
vibrant manufacturing sector is in the national interest.

Q: You mention the AWU, is this Labor simply doing the AWU’s work?

Chris Bowen:

The AWU has run a campaign for dealing with gas, as has the Australian 
Industry Group, Manufacturing Australia, the Aluminium Council – they’re not 
affiliated to theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party>.
 
Bernard Keane in Crikey this afternoon 
<http://www.crikey.com.au/2016/05/18/refugees-do-not-take-our-jobs/#loggedin> 
(for subscribers, do subscribe) notes that refugees are exactly the kind of 
people that Turnbull’s innovative, agile Australia apparently wants. Yes it’s 
true that it costs money to resettle them, but the investment pays off over 
time.

Here’s an excerpt.

Refugees <https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees> — because they’ve been 
forced to move rather than voluntarily decided to migrate; because they usually 
can’t access their assets in their home country; because they haven’t developed 
skills with the goal of being employable in a different culture; because they 
often suffer from mental health problems created by the circumstances that 
forced them to flee — require assistance when they resettle. They require 
assistance to learn English, to acquire skills, to adjust to living in a 
different culture and economy, to educate their children (children make up a 
higher proportion of refugees than other migrant categories).

Once they acquire jobs, it’s possible it may be 20 years 
<http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21688938-europes-new-arrivals-will-probably-dent-public-finances-not-wages-good-or>
 before they pay enough income tax to bring the taxpayer out ahead in net 
terms. However, there’s little evidence from Europe that large numbers of 
refugees depress wages. Reported effects of low-skilled migrants on wages,The 
Economist found, were slight.

And refugees, according to a 2011 report 
<https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/01_2014/economic-social-civic-contributions-booklet2011.pdf>
, have lower workforce participation levels than Australian-born citizens (so, 
actually, they don’t compete for jobs as much as the rest of us do), but that 
improves over time and refugees who complete their education in Australia 
actually havehigher workforce participation rates than Australian-born people — 
as do the children of refugees when they reach working age. And refugees highly 
value education; they and their children havemuch higher rates of tertiary 
education than Australian-born people.

Refugees also tend to be more entrepreneurial than the rest of us. Census data 
has shown higher proportions of owner/managers among refugee communities than 
Australian-born citizens — usually among longer-established communities, but 
also among more recent arrivals like the Somali community.

It was a pity I couldn’t keep eyes on the National Press Club debate about 
climate policy at lunchtime through until the end because the encounter was 
cooking away quite nicely. The Greens are unhappy not to have been invited to 
the debate. NPC presidentChris Uhlmann said at the start of today’s proceedings 
these election encounters are designed to test the propositions of the parties 
of government, and there will be other opportunities for the Greens and other 
non-government parties to address the club over the course of the campaign. In 
the interests of full disclosure, I’m a director of the club. In any case, the 
Greens aren’t waiting for an invitation.Larissa Waters plans to host a Q&A this

A bit more detail about Labor’s gas policy unveiled earlier today. The 
opposition is promising to establish a Domestic Gas Review Board to consider 
whether any new gas export facility, or proposal to expand an existing one, 
would meet Australia’s national interest.

It would also require foreign gas companies to say how much gas they plan to 
make available for local manufacturers and households.

But the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has stopped short of calling for gas 
quotas to be introduced to force energy companies to sell an agreed amount of 
gas to local manufacturers.

“Natural gas belongs to all Australians. We want to ensure it’s extracted in 
the national interest,” Bowen said on Wednesday. “We want to ensure that we 
don’t face a situation in the future, as has been predicted, that more and more 
manufacturing facilities face closure, not only because of the price of gas but 
because they just can’t get any gas.”

The proposed Domestic Gas Review Board would operate in a similar way to the 
Foreign Investment Review Board <https://firb.gov.au/>, which considers the 
national benefit of foreign investment proposals. It would require energy 
companies to demonstrate how their newly-expanded export facilities would boost 
Australia’s exports and national income, increase the overall gas supply and 
deliver a “predictable and affordable source of gas” for local manufacturers.

Labor’s new policy will go some way to placating demands from the Australian 
Workers’ Union to reserve a proportion of Australia’s gas for domestic use at 
affordable prices.

The AWU’s national secretary, Scott McDine, said the AWU has been leading the 
Reserve Our Gas campaign 
<http://www.reserveourgas.com.au/how_would_a_gas_reservation_policy_work> that 
has been pushing for the government to legislate and create the option to 
reserve natural gas for domestic use.

“Australia finds itself the only developed nation on the planet which allows 
gas exporters to extract our gas and sell it to the highest international 
bidder without any restriction whatsoever,” McDine said.

“Australian households and industry are being forced to match the highest 
international prices for our own gas.

 Looking for THE shot.  
Meanwhile, looking southwards, the Liberal party’s Indi candidate, Sophie 
Mirabella, has been cut loose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/18/australian-election-sophie-mirabella-coalition-indi-nationals-liberals>
 by the Coalition.

The deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce has been openly mocking her and senior 
government sources claim she has been starved ofLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> funding apart from 
that which she can raise locally.

The developments suggest both sides of the Coalition have written off 
Mirabella’s chances of regaining the seat from independent MPCathy McGowan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/cathy-mcgowan>.


Two days ago Mirabella accused some in the Liberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> of destablising her 
campaign on the ABC’s 7.30.

“What do they say? If you want a friend in politics, get a dog … Let others be 
concerned about internecine affairs, I’ll worry about Indi,” Mirabella said.


At a party event in Indi on Tuesday night for Nationals candidate Marty Corboy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/16/indis-national-hopeful-some-people-are-rapt-to-have-a-man-to-vote-for?CMP=share_btn_tw>
, Joyce told members and supporters the people of Indi wanted someone in 
Canberra who would allow them they say “I feel proud of him”.


“I don’t want to talk too much about the other candidates, they can talk for 
themselves and they did an exceptionally good job of that last night [on 
7.30],” Joyce said. “What I can say is the more they talk, the better you look 
Marty.”
 
My colleague Lenore Taylor on the day’s asylum developments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/18/when-peter-dutton-insults-refugees-he-insults-the-australian-people>
. This comment piece could have been headlined stop the stupid.

There’s the entry-level scare campaign, the one that has been running all 
week, that says that because Labor candidates and MPs have expressed concerns 
about the humanitarian consequences of our offshore detention centres a Labor 
government would inevitably “restart the boats”.

But are those concerns really heresy, or a reasonable response to the horror 
stories flooding in from both Manus Island and Nauru, of rape and self-harm and 
self-immolation? Is it really bad to have some qualms about camps that have 
been declared illegal by the Papua New Guinean supreme court and condemned by 
the United Nations?

If the Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> is so 
totally unperturbed by those things, if it thinks the policy is “working” in 
every respect, then what is its answer to its obvious humanitarian failings? 
What is it planning to do with the people in those camps? Because they are the 
ones who are really “languishing” in sanity-sapping uncertainty.

Turnbull said at the outset of his prime ministership he “sympathised with, 
and grieved for” the “mental anguish” of those in detention and promised he 
would do everything possible to find a resettlement solution.

But no “solution” has been found. Does Bill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> have a problem 
because some in his party are worried about this bipartisan policy failure, or 
does Turnbull have a problem because (at least according to the Coalition’s own 
telling) his own MPs are not?

I reckon this is worth a little side by side exercise.

Peter Dutton, last night, on Sky News

For many people, they won’t be numerate or literate in their own language, let 
alone English, and this is a difficulty because the Greens are very close to 
the CFMEU, as obviously the Labor Party is, and their affiliations with the 
union movement obviously are well known.

Now, these people would be taking Australian jobs, there’s no question about 
that, and for many of them that would be unemployed, they would languish in 
unemployment queues and on Medicare and the rest of it. So, there would be a 
huge cost, and there’s no sense in sugar-coating that, that’s the scenario.

Now, we have a managed program at the moment, it’s 13,750 a year that we bring 
in through the refugee program, but we don’t bring people and we will not 
settle people who come off boats. Now, one of the little known policies that 
Labor has put forward in this election campaign is that they want to double 
that number from 13,750 up to over 27,000 people. Now, that’s to try and buy 
off the left and hope in a campaign that they wouldn’t break out the way in 
which we’ve seen now more than 25 candidates do, that have broken out against 
Labor’s policy.

But, as I say, there’s no sense pretending, Paul, that if you said, ‘Look, 
we’re going to be super generous and take 50,000 and that will stop people 
smugglers putting people on boats’, it’s a nonsense, because we know that there 
are hundreds of thousands frankly who would trek down through Malaysia into 
Indonesia that otherwise would have seen the door open in Europe and would now 
see the door open to our country, and it would be an absolute green light.

And, you know, Paul, I think in the run up to this election people want first 
and foremost from their leader, from a prospective prime minister, they want 
somebody with strength of character. They want somebody that has the ability to 
keep their families and our community safe, and I think Bill Shorten has failed 
that test. He’s demonstrated that he doesn’t have the mettle to stand up to his 
own backbench let alone to people smugglers and terrorists that would seek to 
do us harm that might seek to cross our borders, and I thinkMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> demonstrated 
again today that he has the ability, the absolute determination to make sure 
that we keep our borders secure, and if we do that, we can keep our community 
safe.

Malcolm Turnbull, Townsville:

Peter Dutton <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/peter-dutton> is an 
outstanding immigration minister. For more than 600 days, there has not been 
one successful people smuggling operation bringing unauthorised arrivals to 
Australia. He has done an outstanding job as immigration minister.

Let me say something about our immigration program. We are one of the most 
generous host countries for refugees. We take our responsibilities to refugees 
very seriously. As Peter was saying earlier today, many of them come to 
Australia from shattered areas of the world. They are from dreadful, 
devastated, war-torn regions of the world and many of them, large percentages 
of them have no English skills at all. Many of them are illiterate in their own 
language. Many haven’t completed high school. That is no fault of theirs. That 
is why we are reaching out to help them with compassion. What we do, in a way 
that many other countries do not, we invest $800m a year in ensuring they get 
the settlement services they need so they learn English, so they are integrated 
into our society. That is why we are the most successful multicultural society 
in the world.

Our immigration program is built on a pillar of compassion which means that we 
take the refugees and their needs seriously and we invest in them. What the
Labor party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> is 
proposing to do, as you know, is to double the refugee intake. That is 
presumably a gesture to the Greens who want to quadruple it. But they have made 
no estimation of what the additional cost would be. It will run into billions 
of dollars.

Nor have they considered whether we have the capacity in our settlement 
services to ensure those additional refugees are settled here. To conclude on 
this point, we should never forget this - our success as a multicultural 
nation, our success depends upon secure borders. Australians accept this high 
level of refugee intake, this large humanitarian program because they know that 
their government keeps their borders secure. We keep the borders secure. Peter 
Dutton, as immigration minister, is keeping the borders secure. Mr Shorten on 
the other hand, leads a party that is utterly divided on this issue and would, 
once again, were they to be in government, once again fail Australians at the 
border.

Same message, Dutton’s is delivered with an ungloved fist, Turnbull’s is 
delivered as a fist in a velvet glove.
 
The prime minister’s tone is different to the immigration minister’s tone, and 
Malcolm Turnbull declined to repeat the Dutton suggestion that asylum seekers 
would take Australian jobs, he said the government wanted humanitarian entrants 
to get jobs, which is the same clean up formulation thatJulie Bishop deployed 
earlier today, but he’s otherwise locked and loaded on the political strategy, 
which is beat the boats drum, just beat it a little more quietly, everything 
being relative.
