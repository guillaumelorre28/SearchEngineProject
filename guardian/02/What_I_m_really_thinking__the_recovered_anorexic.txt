When I ask if I can meet you at this particular cafe or that specific 
restaurant, I am only trying to be polite; I’m not posing a question. It is an 
offer to go to a place I have meticulously researched and probably 
visited before. Spontaneity is a word that will never be associated with my 
character. I consider myself “recovered”, but I do not like the term.

I suffered from a mental illness for about four years, gripped in a 
stranglehold of control, starvation and numbers. I am now at a point where I 
manage my disease. There will be days when restrictive impulses fail to intrude 
my thoughts, but there will be times when they resurface. I try hard to fight 
against them. Check myself. Breathe, think, rationalise.

Some former anorexics are bombarded by remnants of their disordered-eating 
pasts. It can be a silently screaming deluge that other people fail to notice. 
After all, who really reads into a moment’s hesitation at an offer of chocolate 
cake or the double-check with the barista that it was indeed skinny milk in 
your latte?

Echoes of my illness can be found in my attempts to retain control of eating 
situations. I’m not necessarily counting, but neither am I completely free. I 
cannot suddenly freefall into a frenzy of burgers, burritos and buttermilk 
pancakes. Returning to normality has to be done slowly, meaningfully and 
enduringly. Recovery has taught me that wellness goes beyond food and body 
shape. I eat now to nourish my body and I yearn to be strong and healthy. My 
concept of elegance has transformed. I hope society’s will one day follow suit.
