Details, details

The late, great LA art maverick’s work is likely to make you think: “What the 
hell am I looking at?” In one room is a sprawling mass of concrete, sprayed 
with dingy polka-dots and studded with buckets and grinning Buddhas. In another 
is a brick and chainlink enclosure. It’s a replica of a famed wishing well in 
LA’s Chinatown that has seen better days.

Dazed and confused

The attraction for Kelley is just that: confusion. It has for him a 
psychosexual charge, linked to the infant’s “nothing space of presexual 
consciousness”. Excavations of everyday culture, from garbage drawings to 
photos of cuddly toys – see the cover of Sonic Youth’s Dirty – are underpinned 
by psychoanalytic theory.

Setting the scene

More literally, the wishing well was a spot that visitors to Chinatown’s 1980s 
punk clubs – Kelley included – might have ducked behind for a hook-up. 
Underneath his sculpture, the artist has added a “fuck room” with lube and 
candles.

Out of your mind

The separated frame/fence and unwieldy mass could possibly be a metaphor for 
ego and id, the white cube and the creative process or the restriction and 
exclusion imposed on the Chinese community in America.
