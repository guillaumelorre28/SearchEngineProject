The Ridiculous 6 is the first of Sandler’s four-film deal with Netflix 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/adam-sandler-netflix-movie-deal>, 
and is clearly intended to be a spoof of traditional westerns, with a title 
playing on The Magnificent Seven. However, it was hit with protests in April 
whena group of extras walked off the set 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/23/adam-sandler-ridiculous-six-native-americans-racism>
 after objecting to a series of gags on taste grounds and that the portrayal of 
Native Americans was inaccurate. Claims also emerged that makeup was being used 
to make actors’ skin look darker.

Sandler also told Screen Crush that The Ridiculous 6 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-ridiculous-six> is a “pro-Indian movie”. 
he said: “I talked to some of the actors on the set who were there and let them 
know that the intention of the movie is 100% to just make a funny movie.”

 He continued: “It’s really about American Indians being good to my character 
and […] just being good people. There’s no mocking of American Indians at all 
in the movie. It’s a pro-Indian movie. So hopefully when people see it – 
whoever was offended on set and walked out – I hope they realise that, and 
that’s it. It was kinda taken out of context.”

The Ridiculous 6 is due to be premiered on Netflix 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix> on 11 December.
