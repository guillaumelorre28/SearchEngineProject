So that's the end of the series. I've tried to give some insight into what 
happened behind the scenes on a very large software project. All the articles 
can be found onthe series page 
<https://www.theguardian.com/help/series/an-abc-of-r2>.

The aim throughout has been to add something of a human dimension to 
theguardian.com -- something that most people would ordinarily see on their 
screen and probably not give too much thought to. I've also tried to show how 
large technology projects can succeed, despite their very high andvisible 
failure rate <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs+technology/technology>.

The entire series has been aligned with purpose of the Inside... blog: to 
allow us to live up to our ideal of openness. So if there are other areas of 
our work that you'd like to hear about then please let me know.
