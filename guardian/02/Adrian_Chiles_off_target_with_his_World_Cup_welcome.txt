ITV technicians must be breathing a sigh of relief as the latest gaffe 
connected to the broadcaster’s football coverage came not from their end of the 
business, but from the ‘talent’. Following on from howlers such as the time 
viewers missed theonly goal of the Merseyside derby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/feb/05/itv-fa-cup-coverage> and then 
Steven Gerrard’s opener for England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/12/itv-england-world-cup-goal-gaffe>
 against the US because of misplaced ads, Adrian Chiles has got in on the act (
again 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2014/apr/10/adrian-chiles-gift-gaffe-itv>
) by revealing an alarming lack of geographical knowledge, the Daily Mail 
reports. Chiles welcomed viewers to coverage of England’s World Cup warm-up 
match against Ecuador on the sunny shores of Rio de Janeiro … which would be 
fine, apart from the fact that the game was being played in Miami, a smidgeon 
over 4,100 miles away. Other Chiles calamities include offeringviewers a fiver 
if they’d stayed tuned to an dull FA Cup match

and inferring that mostPolish footie fans are builders

. The latest mistake apparently happened because the autocue failed. Autocue 
fail, eh? Can we expect a Ron Burgundy moment from Adrian in Brazil?
