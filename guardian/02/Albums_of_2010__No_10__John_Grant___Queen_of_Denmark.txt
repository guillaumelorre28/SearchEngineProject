Last year, John Grant <https://www.theguardian.com/music/john-grant> was known 
to perhaps a handful of hipsters as the former frontman of the Czars, a band 
who enjoyed a measure of critical acclaim if not commercial success. Twelve 
months on, his name features in many 2010 roundups for an album that is one of 
the year's word-of-mouth triumphs.

After the Czars imploded, Grant descended into booze, drugs, suicidal thoughts 
and self-loathing, but subsequently had the kind of epiphany that can follow 
such a crisis. The result is a scarred but revelatory album. Queen of Denmark 
recalls Dennis (brother of Brian) Wilson's 1977 masterpiece, Pacific Ocean 
Blue: it has a similar feel of gazing out on to something endless and darkly 
inviting.

With Midlake as his backing band, Grant assembled a tapestry of flutes, piano, 
strings, eerie synths and gentle drums; almost a weird, wired take on 70s soft 
rock with some deliberate, ironic nods to Lynyrd Skynyrd and Dean Friedman. 
Marz and Where Dreams Go to Die take cocked glances at capitalist America while 
the perkier Jesus Hates Faggots pokes fun at redneck attitudes, which Grant was 
forced to endure as a gay child in a religious Colorado household.

But the sucker punch arrived with the emotionally wringing ballads Queen of 
Denmark, Sigourney Weaver and Caramel, on which the 41-year-old croons like a 
latterday, acid-scarred Sinatra. Grant has written almost supernaturally 
beautiful hymns of love, despair, chaos and ultimate redemption. His are the 
sort of songs that some artists spend their entire careers wishing they had 
written.
