Victorians have been warned to prepare for more thunderstorm asthma attacks on 
Sunday, with the NationalAsthma <https://www.theguardian.com/society/asthma> 
Council Australia saying expected thunderstorm conditions combined with high 
pollen counts can lead to breathing problems for people with asthma and hay 
fever.

The world’s worst recorded thunderstorm asthma attack saw more than 8,500 
hospitalised in Victoria.

“As we have seen with the recent events in Melbourne any serious asthma attack 
can be life-threatening and have tragic consequences,” Dr Jonathan Burdon said 
on Saturday.

“Act quickly if you start to have symptoms such as shortness of breath or 
wheezing.”

The results of Cartwright’s review will be given to the inspector general of 
emergency management, who is conducting a review of the health system’s 
response to the storm.
