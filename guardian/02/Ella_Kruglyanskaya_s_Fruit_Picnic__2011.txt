Gone pear-shaped

In this riot of fabric and fruit by the New York-based painter, figures 
dissolve into pattern. The curvy pears, apples and watermelon of the picnic 
blanket echo thighs, boobs and bums. There’s a confusion of three dimensions 
and two, reminding us that this is all a flat painted fantasy.

Girls’ world

But whose fantasy? The use of gorgeous pattern directly recalls Matisse, but 
while the painting’s poseurs are lushly inviting, they offer far from 
straightforward visual pleasure. This girls’ world has been filtered through a 
21st-century feminism that acknowledges the complexity of women’s identity now.

Shoe-gazer

Men are largely absent in Kruglyanskaya’s work, but their presence is felt. 
Here the melon rinds and leaves are comically phallic and suggestively 
positioned; the lone shoe is a classic Freudian symbol for both male and female.

Made You Look

Our gaze is confronted with a knowing wink on the left; on the right, a 
red-lipped belt buckle does a show-off femme fatale leer in order to double as 
a vagina dentata. These gals have agency, and looking at them is a risky 
business.
