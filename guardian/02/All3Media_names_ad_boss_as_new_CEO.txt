Shameless <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shameless> maker All3Media 
has taken the unexpected step of appointing Farah Ramzan Golant – the executive 
chairwoman of the ad agency behind campaigns for Guinness, Sainsbury's and BT – 
as its new chief executive.

The appointment comes as a complete surprise, not least because it was thought 
thatAll3Media <https://www.theguardian.com/media/all3media> – one of the UK's 
biggest "super indies", which makes shows including Skins, The Only Way is 
Essex and Midsomer Murders – would select a candidate with programme-making 
experience.

In addition, Ramzan Golant, 48 – one of the most powerful women in the UK 
advertising industry – was considered to be a "lifer", having served almost 23 
years at the UK's largest agency, AMV BBDO.

Steve Morrison, co-founder of All3Media, is staying with the production 
company group as chairman and will help Ramzan Golant with the transition from 
advertising to production.

Ramzan Golant has had a hand in some of the nation's most well-known ads, 
including BT's "It's good to talk", Sainsbury's "Feed your family for a fiver", 
and the Economist's trademark campaign.

All3Media used executive search firm Egon Zehnder, which also handled the 
recent appointment of George Entwistle as the BBC's new director general.

Ramzan Golant, who will be given a stake in All3Media as part of her deal, 
joined AMV in 1990, three years after graduating from a Cambridge College with 
a joint degree in modern and medieval languages, and in 2011 received a CBE for 
services to advertising.

She was made AMV chief executive in 2004 and joined the BBDO worldwide board 
in 2007.

AMV BBDO, which is owned by US marketing services giant Omnicom, has been the 
largest UK agency for some years with client billings estimated at £377m.

Declared income, for 2010, was just short of £50m and the agency employs well 
over 400 staff.

All3Media is thought to be on track to make earnings of £65m in the year to 
the end of August.

Last year it was put up for sale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/apr/01/shameless-producer-all3media-review?INTCMP=SRCH>
, but a price tag of well over £700m deterred potential suitors, leaving the 
company to focus on growth, especially in the US.
