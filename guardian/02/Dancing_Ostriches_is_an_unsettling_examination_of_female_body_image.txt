Her beautiful dark twisted fantasy

This is perhaps the most unsettling work in Paula Rego’s deeply unsettling 
series inspired by the would-be ballerina birds in Disney’s Fantasia.

Coming on strong

These aren’t the kind of professional sylphs who contort their bodies on 
stage. Rego’s women have the muscular arms and bulging thighs of dockworkers, 
and their careworn, craggy features and physical heft are emphasised by her 
relentless, strong, black line.

Daydream believer?

They avert their eyes from us and one another, lost in reveries; perhaps of 
the youth and beauty associated with the leotard and the tutu.

Pink stinks

Their meaty power, however, is undercut by the black frills and girlish pink 
ribbons. The traditional costumes of an art form that is a symbol for the 
control of female bodies look absurd, but so do the women wearing them.

Mystery woman

Furthermore, the question of “freakishness” is brazenly raised by the 
truncated body on the left, which recalls an analogous figure in Velázquez’s 
Las Meninas. Rego’s pastel fantasy world is similarly mysterious and 
open-ended, refusing to offer easy answers to the difficult questions it raises 
about women’s bodies and role play’s potential for both freedom and oppression.
