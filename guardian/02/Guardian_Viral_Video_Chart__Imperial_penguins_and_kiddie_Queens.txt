As any self-respecting geek knows, today is Star Wars Day (May the 4th be with 
you). And what better way to enjoy the day than by watchinga bunch of penguins 
waddling along to the Imperial March 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQi2BATF2wA> music from the Star Wars films. 
The only problem: how do you tell which one is supposed to be Darth Vader?

Elsewhere, the battle for the biggest summer blockbuster crown is hotting up 
with the release of new trailers this week for bothPrometheus 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1byZkbNB3Jw&feature=player_embedded> and The 
Dark Knight Rises 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8evyE9TuYk&feature=player_embedded>. (Our 
money is on Jaws.) And finally, check out US president Barack Obama in fine 
form at the2012 White House correspondents' dinner 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlJG5mpsyvI>. If he loses the election in 
November, he'll have a great new career as a standup.
