Georgia police arrested at least nine people on Saturday at a “pro-white” 
rally at one of the south’s largestConfederate

 monuments, after counter-protesters clashed with the demonstrators and 
officers in riot gear intervened.

The long-planned “Rock Stone Mountain” rally  
<http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/controversial-klan-figure-to-lead-stone-mountain-r/npgxQ/>
was supposed to draw thousands to the state park, just before Confederate 
Memorial Day. In response, progressive activists planned a demonstration of 
their own to denounce public acts of discrimination. Only one group showed up 
in numbers.


On Saturday morning, roughly two dozen “pro-white” protesters gathered at 
Stone Mountain, a half hour east of downtown Atlanta, to wave Dixie flags and 
wear “White Lives Matter” stickers. Hundreds of counter-protesters, including 
groups chanting “Black Lives Matter” and against the Ku Klux Klan, lined up 
across from them. Between the two sides, police in riot gear formed a wall, and 
officers made arrests, broke up scuffles and shut down the park’s main 
attractions.

Mississippi's Confederate Heritage Month proclamation prompts outcry

Rally organizer John Estes said his group’s presence at the public park, which 
is home to a behemoth granite sculpture of three Confederacy leaders, was 
necessary to slow what he called the desecration of Confederate symbols 
important to his heritage.

“There is no separation between heritage and race,” said Estes, who was clad 
in a red shirt with aConfederate flag 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/05/confederate-flag-dispute-gettysburg-protests>
 bearing the words “Rebel Son”.

“If you destroy the roots of a people, that tree is easily pushed over and 
conquered,” he said. “That’s what happens: to erase history, they erase 
heritage first, then they erase and liquidate the people. That’s what going on 
here.”

The “pro-white” event, scheduled two days before Confederate Memorial Day, an 
official holiday recognized by Georgia and other southern states, was expected 
to draw as many as 2,000 attendees. Because the rally had been planned months 
in advance, at one point withthe help of KKK members 
<https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2015/10/22/kkk-plans-rally-stone-mountain-georgia-park-considered-mlk-memorial>
, progressive groups had spent weeks planning a counter-protest.

Khalid Kamau, an organizer with Black Lives Matter’s Atlanta chapter, called 
for visitors to boycott the state park until its officials stopped giving 
permits out to groups who embrace white supremacy. Early in the morning, his 
group coordinated an effort to block all the tollbooths to the main entrance to 
prevent visitors from entering the park.

“If Isis wanted to have a rally, if a Syrian group wanted to have a rally, 
those [groups] probably wouldn’t be given a permit,” Kamau said, using the 
acronym for the terror group Islamic State. “As long as it’s a state park, and 
the association’s board members are appointed by the governor, we should have a 
say in who gets permits for rallies.”

Half a dozen different law enforcement agencies were called into action to 
keep the protests separated. Since Estes had obtained a permit for the 
demonstration, roughly a hundred corrections officers in all-black riot gear, 
many of them African American, formed a perimeter around the area to protect 
the protesters waving Confederate flags.

Most protesters demonstrated peacefully, but several fights did ensue between 
the competing protesters. When police blocked the counter-protesters from 
approaching the “pro-white” demonstration area, a handful of people started 
fires and hurled rocks at officers in riot gear. Police officers also dodged 
smoking canisters and fireworks that were lobbed in their direction.

John Bankhead, a spokesperson with the Stone Mountain police, said law 
enforcement officers arrested a total of nine counter-protesters. Eight 
activists were charged with refusing to take their masks off on public 
property, a law originally created to deter the Ku Klux Klan from wearing white 
hoods, and three of them were also charged with obstruction of justice.

Ultimately, Estes said, the heavy police presence scared many supporters out 
of attending the rally. Later in the afternoon, the National Socialist Movement 
had scheduled a separate Confederate Memorial Day event in Rome,Georgia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia>, 85 miles north-west of 
the state park. Once both rallies ended, the “pro-white” protesters planned to 
stage a cross burning.
