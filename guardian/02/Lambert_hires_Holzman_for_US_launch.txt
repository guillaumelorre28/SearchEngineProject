Katalyst Films, where he developed and launched another reality show, Beauty & 
The Geek.

Lambert, the former chief creative officer of RDF Media who resigned last year 
over his part in the BBC1 "Crowngate" controversy, launched Studio Lambert with 
the backing of Steve Morrison'sAll3Media

He said Holzman was an "outstanding creative" with "exceptional 
entrepreneurial and creative talent and experience", adding: "I have no doubt 
that together we will be a winning team."

programmes for UK broadcasters. The new US operation will be based in Los 
Angeles.

Producer Annie Meek, whose credits include The Osbournes, is the company's 
first US employee and becomes executive in charge of production.

Holzman said: "The opportunity to join [Lambert] and the outstanding team he 
has assembled in the UK was something I simply could not pass up.

"We are dedicated to establishing ourselves quickly as one of the industry's 
foremost producers of quality non-scripted programming.

"Annie has an amazing track record of delivering high quality shows. With her 
on board from the beginning, we will be very well positioned to become a 
significant producer as well as creator of hit shows."
