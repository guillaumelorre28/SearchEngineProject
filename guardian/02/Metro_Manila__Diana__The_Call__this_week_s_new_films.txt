Metro Manila 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/16/metro-manila-sean-ellis> (15) 
(Sean Ellis, 2013, UK/Phi) Jake Macapagal, Althea Vega, John Arcilla. 115 mins

Street-level social drama slyly develops into gripping crime thriller in this 
resourceful Anglo-Asian movie, a distinctive spin on the familiar theme of 
innocent country folk in the corrupting city. The squalor of modern-day Manila 
is vividly evoked, as our goodly, hard-up couple struggle to gain a foothold, 
but the opportunities they get only lead them into the moral shadows.

Diana <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/05/diana-review> (12A) 
(Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2013, UK/Fra/Bel/Swe/Moz) Naomi Watts, Naveen Andrews. 
113 mins

History repeats itself as farce in this unintentionally laughable rendition of 
Diana's final years and her "secret" affair. It's no deeper or better informed 
than your average celebrity mag.

The Call 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jan/17/the-call-halle-berry-trailer>
 (15)
(Brad Anderson, 2013, US) Halle Berry, Abigail Breslin, Michael Eklund. 94 mins

Neat, unfussy little thriller in which emergency-call operator Berry attempts 
to remotely rescue an abducted teen.

RIPD <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibMV4ZOYHh4> (12A) 
(Robert Schwentke, 2013, US) Jeff Bridges, Ryan Reynolds. 96 mins

Bland would-be blockbuster whose suspiciously Men In Black-like premise 
(buddy-cops weeding out the dead in the living world) barely splutters to life.

Kelly + Victor <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFEtR-QhWOM> (18) 
(Kieran Evans, 2013, Ire/UK) Antonia Campbell-Hughes, Julian Morris. 94 mins

The two leads excel in a graphic, if slight, story of hard-up scouse teens 
finding escape in sex.

Hawking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jul/01/stephen-hawking-watch-the-trailer>
 (PG)
(Stephen Finnigan, 2013, UK) 91 mins

The cosmologist guides you through his personal universe, looking back on his 
childhood, his disease and his career, and sparing us the difficult science 
bits.

Cold Comes The Night <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80C3yttlDjU> (15) 
(Tze Chun, 2013, US) Alice Eve, Bryan Cranston. 90 mins

Cranston comes down from Breaking Bad with a Russian accent and a twisty 
American caper, set in motion by a single mum's discovery of a bag of cash.

A Belfast Story <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ0MM3ibHkE> (15) 
(Nathan Todd, 2013, Ire) Colm Meaney, Malcolm Sinclair. 99 mins

The Troubles continue, post-Good Friday agreement, and it's up to Meaney's 
weary cop to stop to them.

Harrigan <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebZok8FFqDo> (15) 
(Vince Woods, 2013, UK) Stephen Tompkinson, Ian White, Amy Manson. 97 mins

Tough policing in crime-ridden Newcastle upon Tyne in this Red Riding-esque 
thriller.

InRealLife 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/aug/05/in-real-life-documentary-teens-internet-video>
 (15)
(Beeban Kidron, 2013, UK) 89 mins

Timely, broad-spectrum "What's the internet doing to our kids?" documentary, 
which finds parental and privacy-related concerns in social media, porn, etc.

9.79* <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPPfYtFE6og> (PG) 
(Daniel Gordon, 2012, US) 83 mins

The doped-up 100m final of the 1988 Olympics is recalled by those involved, 
including Linford Christie and Ben Johnson.
