A distinctive part of the north west countryside, Arnside Knott is an imposing 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty with spectacular views of the Lake District 
and Morecombe Bay from the summit. If you time your visit carefully, you may 
witness the impressive spectacle of the tidal bore rushing in across the vast 
Bay, where the tides are said to run faster than a galloping horse and the 
quicksands can be deadly. This pretty walk to the top takes you through the 
limestone grassland and mixed woodland that cover Arnside Knott, which attracts 
a variety of insects and is especially renowned for butterflies.

Cockermouth is a great place to start and finish a walk. This traditional 
market town still retains dozens of independent shops and some lovely 
restaurants and pubs – and it's the home ofJennings Brewery 
<http://www.jenningsbrewery.co.uk/>, so what better excuse could there be for a 
post-walk pint? Take the chance to visitWordsworth House and Garden 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/home/item288912/>, the birthplace of the poet, 
and All Saints Church where William was baptised and his father is buried.

The National Trust manages a stretch of the so-called "colourful coast" at 
Whitehaven, which is the starting point for theCoast to Coast cycle ride 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/interactive/2008/jul/17/cyclingholidays.uk.coasttocoast>
 – you'll see riders following tradition and dipping their wheels in the sea 
before they start. Look out for the remains of Saltom Pit, the first under sea 
coal mine in England, and bring your binoculars for a glimpse of puffins, 
guillemots and chough (a member of the crow family with a red bill and legs).

There's a hidden industrial history in this part of north Cumbria. There used 
to be an abundance of gypsum mines, some of which are now accessible thanks to 
new footpaths being opened up. But apples are whatAcorn Bank 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/home/item294926/> (pictured) is known for 
nowadays and their annual Apple Day attracts thousands of people. This walk 
also takes you under the impressive Crowdundle Viaduct which carries the famous
Settle to Carlisle railway <http://www.settle-carlisle.co.uk/> line.

Tucked away outside of Kendal, Sizergh Castle 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/home/item273909/> has a 1,600-acre estate 
sitting amid an agricultural landscape so take time to visit two National Trust 
tenants – the great farm shop and the pub, the Strickland Arms, which are both 
on the estate. There are a host of local walks on offer which will take you to 
some impressive viewpoints where you can see the Cumbrian fells and the sands 
of Morecambe Bay. It's also home to a vast array of wildlife – Sizergh is a 
nationally significant site for hawfinches and work is taking place to 
encourage fritillary butterflies.

The woods on the banks of the River Eden at Wetheral are a shady place to 
explore on a summer's day. The St Constantine Cells hidden away there are said 
to have been a refuge for monks from the nearbyPriory 
<http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/wetheral-priory-gatehouse/>

This is the town where three 'ways' meet – the Cumbria Way, the Cumbrian 
Coastal Way and the Cistercian Way. Ulverston's most famous son is Stan Laurel 
and those who don't want to venture out of the town can take a heritage trail 
to explore the town the young actor would have known. A favourite walk circuits 
the town itself, so you are never more than three miles away from its shops and 
eateries, yet you can enjoy views across the Cumbrian fells and Morecambe Bay.

It's not widely known as a walkers' haven, but Barrow actually has its own 
very popularwalking festival, held every year in July 
<http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=3266>. The town has an intriguing 
past, thanks to its shipbuilding and steel industry history, but for a complete 
contrast, head for Walney Island (pictured), joined to the mainland in 1908 by 
a bridge – a much easier option than waiting for a low tide to reveal the 
stepping stones. It's a wildlife haven, particularly for its visiting bird 
population – in particular, you'll see thousands of oystercatchers feeding on 
its shores.

Love them or hate them, wind farms are a prominent feature in the Solway 
Firth. As you look from the Cumbrian coast across to Dumfries and Galloway, you 
can't fail to notice the turbines, but the Scottish mountains are still an 
impressive sight. These shores have a dark legacy of smugglers and the harbour 
town of Maryport makes a great gateway to this coast and its Roman history. 
VisitSenhouse Museum <http://www.senhousemuseum.co.uk/> for a taste of this 
colourful past, then head north to find the remains ofHadrian's Wall 
<http://www.hadrians-wall.org/>.

The Eastern Fells are another area which are largely overlooked by visitors, 
despite their easy accessibility. The Howgills are particularly lovely if you 
want a deserted walk and offer the opportunity for some wild camping. Please 
follow the golden rules if you do decide to stay out overnight – be prepared, 
pitch late and rise early, and leave no trace behind, out of consideration for 
other walkers and wildlife. You're well placed in this area for walks in both 
the Cumbrian fells and Yorkshire Dales.
