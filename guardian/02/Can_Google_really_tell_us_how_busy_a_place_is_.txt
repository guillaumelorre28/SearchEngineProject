One of the creepiest – and most useful – Google inventions has been its 
ability to predict traffic jams by using anonymisedping-backs 
<https://www.ncta.com/platform/> from mobile phones to tell how fast everyone 
is moving.

Google will now tell you whether a bar or shop is busy in real-time

Now, the technology giant is rolling out the same thing for places using live 
data. Although, since July 2015, the Popular Times section of Google Maps has 
provided a bar graph showing how busy a bar, museum or restaurant is at any 
given time, this is just based onaverages 
<https://support.google.com/business/answer/6263531?hl=en-GB>.

How accurate will the new feature be? Rather than just believe our Alphabet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/alphabet> overlords, we road-tested the 
system by dawdling around five of London’s biggest attractions.

Tate Modern 
<https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=tate%20modern>


At the Tate, a number of people hover in the little dark room where you have 
to clap to make the art strobe go on, while, up in the ziggurat, a slightly 
sparser crowd than normal are standing at the windows ogling the residents of 
Richard Rogers’s Neo Bankside building in their exposed lounges. Down at the 
Turbine Hall, a man at the info kiosk says it is “just about as busy as usual”. 
According toGoogle <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google>, he is 100% 
correct.
Conclusion: Correct

Tower of London 
<https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=tower+of+london&oq=tower+of+london&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2478j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8>


As we enter the main courtyard, the Tower swallows up a phalanx of 100 or so 
tourists in one go. Despite this, Google says it is under-populated compared 
with the average crowd between noon and 1pm on Wednesdays. The Beefeater-ish 
woman at the main gates agrees: “It’s a bit quieter than usual.”
Conclusion: Correct. 

The London Eye 
<https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=london%20eye>

Is it slightly less of a hellscape today? It seems borderline-agreeable as a 
few pigeons gull about and some half-empty glass orbs arc skywards. According 
to Google, it is quiet today. Not that anyone here seems to know. “You’ll have 
to go on the website and look up the contact details for our marketing 
department if you want that kind of information,” a manager says.
Conclusion: Correct?


Dishoom, King’s Cross branch 
<https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=dishoom&rflfq=1&rlha=0&rllag=51524300,-101933,2168&tbm=lcl&tbs=ls:-1,lf_msr:-1,lf:1,lf_ui:9,lf_pqs:EAE&rlfi=hd:;si:8398580231852154415>

“To be honest, we’re never not busy,” says the woman at the other end of the 
line at this Indian tapas joint. Such humblebrag aside, Google agrees that the 
restaurant is exactly as busy as normal. Which is pretty damned busy, 
apparently.
Conclusion: Correct.

Nopi, Soho 
<https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=nopi&oq=nopi&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l5.606j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8>

Yotam Ottolenghi could expect a turnout boost at his flagship restaurant after 
being on Desert Island Discs last week. “We’re as busy as normal,” the 
Australian assistant says, with a pleasing authority, after a moment on hold. 
However, his assertion is undermined by Google’s phone-ping polygraph, which 
suggests he is a good fraction less busy than normal. Are Nopi diners the type 
to turn off their phones? Are they so rich that there’s a phone porter who 
comes and casks diners’ phones in their vaults? Clearly, the technology has a 
few imperfections. Some of which will be smoothed out over time as users 
contribute visual feedback. All told, as ever the creepiness will fade, the 
glitches will be fixed, and there will be endless benefits that we have barely 
begun to imagine.
Conclusion: Incorrect.
