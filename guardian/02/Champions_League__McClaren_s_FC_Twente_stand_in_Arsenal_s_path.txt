Steve McClaren will make an early return to English football when his new 
side, FC Twente, take on Arsenal in the third qualifying round of theChampions 
League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague>. McClaren only 
took the reins at Twente – who finished fourth in the Dutch league last season 
- in June, and the tie will be a glorious chance to prove his many and varied 
critics wrong.

"It was strange, because as soon as I joined [Twente] I knew we had the draw 
coming up," said McClaren. "I expected one of the English teams. I think fate 
deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this draw. On one hand it's very, 
very tough for us but on the other it is very exciting.

"I think of all the teams we could have had, that is the toughest - or one of 
the toughest. Obviously we looked at Arsenal,Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>, Juventus, Schalke and we got 
one of the most difficult. In one respect it's a tough draw for us; on the 
other it's now an opponent we know very well, not just myself, everyone in 
Holland knows the Premier League well so Arsenal will be no strangers to us. 
This is a reward for a great achievement last season in reaching this stage, to 
get one of the big teams. It will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience that 
doesn't come along that often. I'm sure the fans will be delighted."

Arsenal's company secretary David Miles admitted that the club were happy with 
the draw: "Logistically Holland isn't too far and it will give our fans the 
opportunity to see the game." Miles said McClaren might have been hoping for an 
easier draw. "I'm assuming people will sayArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are one of the strongest seeded 
teams and he might have been hoping for someone else, but that's what the draw 
brought us and we get on with it."

Elsewhere, Liverpool will begin their campaign against Standard Liege 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/standardliege> and, if Rangers make it 
past Kaunas in the second-qualifying round, they will play the winners of the 
tie between Aalborg and FK Modrica.

Arguably the best tie of the round is the match-up between Atlético Madrid and 
Schalke, while Irish champions Drogheda will play Spartak Moscow if they can 
overcome the small matter of a 2-1 first-leg deficit against Dynamo Kyiv.

The first-leg ties will be played on August 12/13 with the return match taking 
place a fortnight later.
