Diageo has dropped back on worries about weaker spirits growth in the US and 
the loss of a key tequila deal.

Analysts at UBS have cut their earnings forecasts for next year, and moved 
their recommendation from buy to neutral.

In December Diageo pulled out of talks to buy tequila group Jose Cuervo, which 
leavesDiageo <https://www.theguardian.com/business/diageo> without a major 
tequila brand once its distribution deal with Cuervo ends in June this year. 
UBS also pointed to a short term weakening in US trading, and said:
 We cut 2014 estimated EPS by 3% for (1) the loss of Cuervo distribution, (2) 
foreign exchange. Our new price target [down from £20.50 to £20] implies a 2013 
PE of 18 times (currently trading on 16.8 times), therefore we see some 
potential for further re-rating, but no longer sufficient upside to justify a 
buy.


The bank also believes the prospect of acquisitions is more limited for now:
 After an intense two years of activity, we see less M&A likely in 2013, 
particularly post Cuervo. We are bullish about the United Spirits deal [in 
India] but it is a slow burn turnaround. We see a low probability of Diageo 
acquiring Beam, or Moët Hennessy becoming available, short-term. 
Diageo is currently down 27.5p at 1815.5p in a market which is managing to 
stay in positive territory. In quiet trading theFTSE 100 is currently 12.01 
points higher at 6166.42.

Elsewhere Admiral is still holding onto the top spot, up 61p to £12.15 after a 
Goldman upgrade.

Another insurer, Aviva, has also benefited from a positive note from the bank, 
adding 7.3p to 373.5p. Goldman said on:
 Following four significant disposals, Aviva is in a significantly better 
position with regards to its capital and liquidity. We believe the shares have 
failed to reflect the much better position of the company and the potential for 
earning growth; buy. 
Aggreko has fallen 27p to £18.03 after Bank of America Merrill Lynch moved its 
recommendation on the temporary power supplier from buy to neutral and its 
price target from £27 to £19.50. It said:
 We now look set for a period of lower invested capital and international 
power products growth and returns are unlikely to return to the 20% plus levels 
achieved between 2009 and 2011.

Among the mid-caps Easyjet has fallen 18p to 854p after founder Sir Stelios 
Haji-Ioannou revealed he had sold 200,000 shares in the market last week, with 
his brother and sister each selling the same amount, taking the family's stake 
to just below 37%. He said the "token disposal of shares" was sending a clear 
message to the directors, with whom he disagrees over strategy.

But WH Smith is up 22p at 637.5p as Numis moved from hold to add ahead of the 
retailer's trading update this week.
