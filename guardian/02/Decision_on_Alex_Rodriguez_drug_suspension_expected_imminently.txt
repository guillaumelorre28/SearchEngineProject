Alex Rodriguez <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alex-rodriguez> is likely to 
find out in the next few days whether his drug suspension will be overturned.

People familiar with the case told the Associated Press on Friday that the 
arbitrator Fredric Horowitz could issue his decision this weekend. The people 
spoke on condition of anonymity because no statements were authorised.

The New York Yankees third baseman, a three-time AL MVP, was suspended for 211 
games on 5 August by the Major League Baseball commissioner, Bud Selig 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/05/alex-rodriguez-suspended-mlb-peds-drugs>
. The penalty was given for alleged violations of the sport's drug agreement 
and labour contract and followed an MLB investigation of the Biogenesis of 
America anti-ageing clinic, which was accused of distributing banned 
performance-enhancing drugs.

The Major League Baseball <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/baseball> Players 
Association filed a grievance saying the disciplinary sanction was without 
"just cause".

Horowitz, MLB's independent arbitrator, heard the case over 12 sessions from 
30 September until 20 November. The sides submitted briefs last month.

Rodriguez's lawyers have threatened to go to federal court in an attempt to 
overturn a decision not to their liking. The supreme court has given judges 
little leeway to alter arbitrator's rulings.
