1) Bond as Narcissus

As any therapist can testify, 007's fear of intimacy and commitment indicate a 
gnawing self-infatuation. Here, at last, the legend is spending quality time 
with the one who really matters â€“ peering at his reflection in the lapping 
water of the hotel pool. He's tried the rest and knows he's best.

2) The empty lane

Bond is decisive; he has picked his lane and set his course. Happily there is 
no Ursula Andressrearing out of the shallows 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL_1RBxOYNA> to sing about mango trees or 
splash chlorine in his eye.

3) Co-starring: the trunks

Missing, believed lost at sea, at the end of Casino Royale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/103963/casino.royale>, the trunks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/nov/01/danielcraigshouldquitbond>
 are back, like Blofeld, and only a little worse for wear. The blue has 
slightly faded (reflecting their advancing years). They also seem to ride a 
little lower than usual (suggesting, perhaps, that Bond's seat has become 
embarrassingly caught in the swimming-pool grating).

4) No legs?



We may be fretting unduly about this one. Even so, where are they? Does this 
tranquil scene hark back to a previous, less tranquil scene in which 007 had 
his legs shot off by a marksman, or chewed off by sharks? It is yet another 
mystery that we must wait to unravel.

5) Mysterious lights

Yes, they may just be lights, harmlessly marking the far end of the hotel 
pool. But, this being a Bond movie, they may just as easily be a regiment of 
amphibious assassins, Smersh submersibles, toting laser-sighted assault rifles 
and hell-bent on shooting 007's legs off. Assuming they haven't done so 
already, of course, in a previous scene.
