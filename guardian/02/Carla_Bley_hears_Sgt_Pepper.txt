Carla Bley's 1971 triple album Escalator Over the Hill still stands as one of 
the grandest, oddest and most spectacular creations in jazz history. This 
two-hour jazz opera started in 1967 when Bley heard Sgt Pepper and decided to 
create a jazz response. She asked her friend Paul Haines, then living in India, 
to write some lyrics, and spent a year setting them to music. The next three 
years were spent enlisting jazz and rock musicians (including Jack Bruce, Paul 
Jones, Linda Ronstadt, John McLaughlin and Don Cherry) to record the results – 
a mix of rock, Indo-jazz fusion and chamber jazz.

Although a high point of what might be called "jazz rock", the project's roots 
lie in a more austere enterprise. Most of the musicians on it were veterans of 
the Jazz Composers' Guild, set up by the trumpeter Bill Dixon in 1964. It was 
an attempt by experimental jazz musicians to circumvent the major labels and 
control the ownership and distribution of their music. Like so many co-ops, the 
Guild – along with Bley's subsequentJazz

disbanded, leaving rather a lot of debt. But the elegantly packaged Escalator 
Over the Hill serves as a compelling and beautiful tribute to their ambition.
