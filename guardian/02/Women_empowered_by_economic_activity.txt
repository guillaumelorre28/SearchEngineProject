"We love development," says Magdalena Samuel. "We don't want poverty any 
more." Magdalena is taking part in Farm-Africa's beekeeping project. 
Traditionally beekeeping was a male activity, but Farm-Africa has insisted that 
women get involved. Petronella Vincent is in a raffia project, making floor and 
table mats. She says that her life has changed since Farm-Africa arrived 
because they "build capacity."

Rural women are rapidly absorbing the language of development: build capacity 
means being taught new skills. One of the tenets of Participatory Forest 
Management is gender balance - women must make up at least one-third of all 
committees and groups. The effect is revolutionary. "In the past," Magdalena 
says, "my husband was in charge of household money. He used the money for 
drinking alcohol and didn't support the family. Now, when we get money, we 
decide together what to do with it. Now, if he wants to drink he has to come 
and ask me."

Stanislaus Tito, a male beekeeper, claims that men are comfortable with the 
changes. "We have discovered recently that women have the same rights as men so 
we need to participate with them," he says, and adds, "the women bring in a lot 
of money!"

According to the women, however, some men are taking time to adjust. Pelagia 
Edward is on her village environmental committee. She says: "When it comes to 
going to the forest, men complain. 'What role do you have here?' they ask. 'You 
have to be at home cooking. You women are disturbing us. You can't walk fast 
enough - we have to wait for you.'" She laughs, "We go all the same."
