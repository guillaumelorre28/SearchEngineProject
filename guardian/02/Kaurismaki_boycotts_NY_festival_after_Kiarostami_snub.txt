Award-winning Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/aki-kaurismaki> boycotted the screening of 
his new film at the New York film festival yesterday after a row erupted over 
the refusal of a via to the Iranian film-maker Abbas Kiarostami.

 Kaurismaki, who won two awards at Cannes for his dry memory loss comedy The 
Man Without a Past, sent a note to the festival explaining that he could not 
bring himself to board the plane in Helsinki after learning that Abbas 
Kiarostami was kept from attending the New York screening of his new film, Ten.

"Under the circumstances I, too, am forced to cancel my participation - for if 
the present government of the USA does not want an Iranian, they will hardly 
have any use for a Finn, either," Kaurismaki said, before joking: "We do not 
even have any oil."

Kiarostami, whose Taste of Cherry jointly won the 1997 Palme d'Or at Cannes, 
was unable to secure a visa from the US embassy is Paris.

The note was read out after yesterday's screening of Kaurismaki's film by 
frustrated festival program director Richard Pena, who said it highlighted the 
problems facing Iranian artists trying to visit America in the current 
political climate.

"Sometimes it takes six to eight weeks and sometimes it can take months for 
them to do background checks," he said. "But this is one of the world's best 
film directors and he has been to the United States seven times in the last 10 
years."
