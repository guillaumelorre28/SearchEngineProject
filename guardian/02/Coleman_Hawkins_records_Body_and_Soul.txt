On 11 October 1939, Coleman Hawkins went into New York's RCA studios with an 
eight-piece band to record the 1930 composition Body and Soul. It was already a 
favourite among jazz musicians, but nobody had ever played it like this. 
Pianist Gene Rodgers plays a straight four-bar introduction before Hawkins 
swoops in, soloing for three minutes without playing a single note of the tune, 
gliding over the chord changes with such harmonic logic that he ends up 
inventing bebop.
