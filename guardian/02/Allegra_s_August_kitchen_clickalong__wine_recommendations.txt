The simplicity of these beautifully fried sea creatures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/aug/20/allegra-mcevedy-clickalong>
 calls for a zingy white wine with good acidity. Some people would call for 
Chablis, and I won't argue.

But there are good alternatives from both Italy and Spain. From Italy, the 
Fiano grape variety is a sure-fire winner.Tesco

andSainsbury's 
<http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/sainsburys-price-comparison/White_Wine/Casa_Mia_Fiano_750ml.html>
 both sell examples that are consistently good, and well priced at £5.99.

From Spain, the wines of Rías Baixas (made from the indigenous Albariño grape 
variety) have achieved due recognition in recent years. They're usually on the 
expensive side for everyday drinking, and the reliable Burgans Albariño (sold 
by Oddbins <http://www.oddbins.com/products/productDetail.asp?productcode=25149>
 among others) is no exception. But the £10.99 price tag drops to £8.79 if you 
buy two. Worth the money for Allegra's mixed fry.
