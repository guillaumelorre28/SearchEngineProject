Thanks to Clare Allan (‘Incurable’ is no justification for ending life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/31/incurable-not-justification-for-ending-life-netherlands-euthanasia>
, 1 June) for highlighting the continuing “mission creep” in the Netherlands 
since the passing of the 2002 Termination of Life on Request and Assisted 
Suicide Act. Euthanasia is clearly one thing when viewed from the deathbed of a 
terminally ill patient but, equally clearly, it is something very different 
when applied to a young adult with seemingly incurable psychiatric distress. As 
Allan says, with psychiatrists willing to recommend and carry out euthanasia 
for psychiatric reasons, who needs self-harm?

Dutch journalist Gerbert van Loenen shows in his book Do You Call This a Life? 
Blurred Boundaries in the Netherlands’ Right-to-Die Laws that, although 
euthanasia activism begins with the wish to help suffering people of sound mind 
to achieve control in ending their torment, it never stops there. In both the
Netherlands <https://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands> and neighbouring 
Belgium, once the barrier of legislation is passed, medically assisted dying 
takes on a dynamic of its own and extends beyond the original intent, despite 
earlier explicit assurances that this would not happen. As a disillusioned 
former member of a Dutch regional euthanasia review board has said: “Don’t go 
there!”
