W. T. Stead is considered to be the founding father of investigative 
journalism and the inventor of the sensationalism that gave rise to tabloid 
newspapers.

His famous investigation into the trafficking of young girls in 1885 landed 
him in jail - but it helped to ensure a law was passed that raised the age of 
consent.

In this year, to mark the centenary of his death aboard the Titanic, a new 
book of essays about him,WT Stead: Newspaper Revolutionary 
<http://publishing.bl.uk/book/wtstead-newspaper-revolutionary>, has just been 
published by the British Library.

It explores the many contradictions of this extraordinary man. He campaigned 
for women's rights but was unnerved by the rise of the New Woman. He advocated 
world peace but promoted rises in defence spending in order to pursue 
imperialistic expansion. He was a Christian, but also a spiritualist.

The book's blurb says that it "seeks to recover the story of an extraordinary 
figure in late Victorian and Edwardian culture." It is co-edited by Roger 
Luckhurst, Laurel Brake, James Mussell and Ed King.Declaration of interest: I

The importance of the Irish Independent

A new book that charts the history of Ireland's leading newspaper publisher, 
Independent Newspapers: A History*, has been out for a month or so. 

I apologise for this belated mention because it's a thorough piece of work by 
14 media scholars, which was edited by Mark O'Brien and Kevin Rafter from the 
school of communications at Dublin City University.

It tells the story of the company from its foundation in 1905 by William 
Martin Murphy and on to the reign of the former Irish rugby star Tony O'Reilly.

The group, now controlled by another larger-than-life figure, Denis O'Brien, 
has long been at the centre of controversy, due to the journalistic output of 
its main titles - theIrish Independent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/irish-independent> (the Indo) and the Sunday 
Independent (the Sindo).

The book examines the various relationships between proprietors and the 
papers, between the company's journalists and its journalistic output, and 
between the newspapers and Irish society.
