Life in the Kit Kat Club is so beautiful that Alan Cumming will return to 
Kander and Ebb's musicalCabaret 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_%28musical%29> in the role that won him a 
Tony award 15 years ago.

However, contrary to reports, he will not be joined by Oscar-winner Anne 
Hathaway, who had been tipped to take the role of Sally Bowles following a
one-off concert at Joe's Pub in New York last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/27/anne-hathaway-cabaret-songs> 
during which she sang several of the show's iconic numbers. Hathaway's 
publicist has denied the reports, saying that he "has no idea" what prompted 
the story.

Cumming, though, will be saying "Willkommen, Bienvenue, Welcome" 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry_fR5H1GYw> for a second time after composer 
John Kanderconfirmed to the New York Times 
<http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/wilkommen-again-roundabout-planning-another-cabaret-revival/?ref=johnkander&gwh=8ACC43AC6FB56D03324773680A9426FD>
 that the Scottish actor would star in the Roundabout Theatre Company's revival 
at Studio 54 next year.

In 1998, Cumming played the Emcee opposite the late Natasha Richardson as 
Sally Bowles and Ron Rifkin as Herr Schultz. All three won Tony awards for 
their performances, with Cumming awarded the prize for best actor in a musical. 
The production, directed by Sam Mendes and originally seen at the Donmar 
Warehouse in London,ran for six years on Broadway

In a recent interview, Cumming alluded to the project 
<http://www.theaesthete.com/story/view.dT/cumming-up-roses>, saying, "I'm doing 
another show on Broadway after The Good Wife season ends. It starts rehearsals 
the day after my 49th birthday, so I'll be entering my 50th year dancing my 
tits off and being a sexpot." While he didn't name the musical, he added: "It's 
something I did before and we're doing it again."

He's currently being talked about as a potential Tony nominee in relation to 
his current Broadway production,the National Theatre of Scotland's one-man 
Macbeth <http://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/content/default.asp?page=s8_3_3>
, directed by John Tiffany. Cumming has already picked up a nomination for the 
distinguished performance gong at theDrama League awards 
<http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/theater/drama_league_awards_nominations_veb2uHyPiHDdhkeXoAOQRI>
, alongside fellow Brits Tom Sturridge, Bertie Carvel, Vanessa Redgrave and 
Fiona Shaw.
