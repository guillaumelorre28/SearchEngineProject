The Associated Press <https://www.theguardian.com/media/associated-press> has 
launched a video service for the Middle East to satisfy what it calls 
"insatiable demand" for news among people in the region.

Called AP Middle East Extra, it has been created for media organisations 
across the Middle East plus those outside with a strong interest in the region.

Aside from video content, it will also feature reports, interviews and 
commentaries on international news for Middle East audiences.According to a 
press release, 
<http://www.ap.org/Content/Press-Release/2014/New-AP-video-service-meets-insatiable-demand-for-news-in-the-Middle-East>
 it "adds depth to AP's extensive coverage of the region."

Ian Phillips, AP's Middle East director of news, said: "For people in the 
Middle East it is not just about bombs, bullets and unrest.

"There are more positive stories that can, and should, be told. By creating 
unique content within a new service, customers can combine this with our 
existing offering to tell in-depth and relevant stories that their audience 
really wants to see, on top of the stories that do still need to be told."

Content for AP Middle East Extra will be provided by a team of video 
journalists based across the region and five stories, with both Arabic and 
English scripts, will be delivered daily between Sunday and Thursday, as well 
as four special features every Friday.

Alwyn Lindsey, AP's director of sales for the Middle East and North Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast>, said: "This product is about 
helping our customers engage with their audiences by providing the mix of 
content that they want to see."

Research to be released soon from AP and Deloitte shows that 97% of consumers 
in the region regularly discuss news and current affairs, and their average 
daily consumption of news is 72 minutes, which is significantly higher than 
their counterparts in the UK and Germany.

AP Middle East Extra is available for delivery through AP Media Port and AP 
Video Hub.
