Wayne Rooney <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wayne-rooney> will not face 
any disciplinary action over an apparent stamp on Aalborg's Kasper Risgard last 
week.

The European governing body Uefa decided not to charge the Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> striker after studying 
video evidence of the incident in the clubs' 2-2 Champions League draw last 
Wednesday. The Aalborg midfielder Risgard claimed Rooney should have been sent 
off after "jumping" on his chest and leaving marks on his body.

The England forward could have faced a suspension for part of the knockout 
stages had Uefa decided to take action. A spokesman said: "Uefa will not open 
any disciplinary proceedings against Wayne Rooney."
