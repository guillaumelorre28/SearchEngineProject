3i and oil services business John Wood are set to be ejected from the FTSE 100 
after the latest quarterly reshuffle of the leading index.

3i <https://www.theguardian.com/business/3igroupbusiness> slipped 0.8p to 197p 
despite some last minute help from joint house broker BarCap, which raised its 
rating on the investment group from equalweight to overweight, although it cut 
its price target from 333p to 270p.

Wood edged up 0.5p to 555p. ITV, another in danger of the drop, escaped 
despite a 1p decline to 53.75p.

Based on last night's closing prices, the two will be replaced by investment 
management groupAshmore, down 6.2p at 398.2p, and support services business 
Bunzl, up 13p at 785p.

The changes need to be ratified by FTSE Group on Wednesday, and are due to 
take effect after the market closes on Friday September 16.
