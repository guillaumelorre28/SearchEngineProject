, has been named winner of the Independent Bookshop Week award, ahead of titles 
including Kate Atkinson’s A God in Ruins and Bill Bryson’s The Road to Little 
Dribbling. The award’s shortlist is voted for by independent booksellers, with 
a panel of judges featuring author Emma Healey, White Rose bookshop’s Sue Lake 
and the Guardian’s Claire Armitstead picking the winner.

Enright, winner of the 2007 Man Booker prize for The Gathering 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/16/bookerprize2007.thebookerprize6>
, said it was “such an honour to be selected for this award by my favourite 
people – booksellers”.

“Long may they remain,” added Enright. “Four or five years ago, we were all in 
a panic that the internet would eat booksellers and paper. But they’ve battled 
on and they’re starting to flourish.”

Her win, which comes alongside Philip Reeve and Sarah McIntyre’s triumph in

<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/21/carol-ann-duffy-jackie-kay-gillian-clarke-imtiaz-dharker-poets-on-the-road>

Macfarlane. The week will also see The Green Road entered into a “best of the

public vote.

Bestselling crime novelist Ian Rankin will be speaking at the Steyning 
bookshop on 18 June, after the store won a competition to entice the writer to 
their premises. “They’ve won me,” said Rankin. “They said I would love to visit 
because they have a local brewery, so they’re taking me for a trip there.”

Rankin, who had bought a copy of Bleak House from his local independent – the 
Edinburgh bookshop – earlier this week, said these retailers were “a part of 
the community”.

“Independent booksellers have to work that bit harder – they can’t always 
offer discounts on books and they don’t always have room for a coffee shop,” he 
said. “But what you get from them is really great personal service, and a 
rapport … Your local high street is an absolutely vital part of the community, 
and independent booksellers are part of that.”

“I think it’s lovely they’re back in the limelight,” agreed the author 
Veronica Henry, about to embark on a tour of independents in the UK for her new 
novel How to Find Love in a Bookshop.

Official figures for UK independents show that numbers fell to 894 in 2015, 
down 3% on the previous year. But Meryl Halls at theBooksellers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksellers> Association echoed the authors’ 
positivity, saying the mood had been “cautiously optimistic” in the sector for 
the last two years, and that shops “are starting to feel properly confident 
now”.

“It’s been torrid,” she said. “But the resurgence of print, and the beautiful 
books thing [people’s desire to own attractive physical books], are definitely 
playing to indies’ strengths. They’ve been through a bruising time but the 
businesses which have survived that know what they’re doing and are running 
successful businesses in their communities. Of course it’s still tough and 
there are still people struggling, but if you’re in the right location, you’re 
doing well.”

numbers have grown for the seventh year in a row 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/20/people-are-hungry-for-real-bookstores-judy-blume-on-why-us-indie-booksellers-are-thriving>
, with indie sales up just over 10% in 2015. “We’re down to just under 900 
independent members, which still makes me sad,” she said. “But in the US they 
have started to increase in numbers, and we will hopefully follow along in the 
next year or two.”
