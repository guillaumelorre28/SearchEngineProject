The fund management empire Alliance Trust 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/alliancetrust> is set to emerge chastened 
but victorious from a showdown with rebel hedge fund Laxey Partners after 
buying back more than £35m of its own stock to soothe agitated investors.

Alliance's chief executive, Katherine Garrett-Cox, will set out a new policy 
on share buybacks at the company's annual meeting on Friday, aimed at defusing 
a resolution demanding change that has been tabled by Laxey's founder, Colin 
Kingsnorth, who is unhappy with sluggish returns.

Kingsnorth is a veteran corporate activist; his previous targets have included 
a campaign against British Land nine years ago. His Isle of Man-based fund has 
a stake of just under 2% in Alliance Trust and has complained about unfair 
shareholder voting practices, Garrett-Cox's pay and a lag between the stock 
price and asset value. Laxey wants a policy whereby the Scottish company 
automatically buys back shares whenever its stock price falls to a 10% discount 
on net asset value. Garrett-Cox has resisted this but has implemented a spate 
of share buybacks and will indicate a willingness to do more on Friday.

A source accepted that "people have raised some very serious questions and 
that has made the company sharper". Several corporate governance watchdogs have 
sided with Laxey Partners but investors are expected to defeat the resolution.

Kingsnorth said he was still unhappy with Garrett-Cox's pay, which has 
totalled £2.45m since 2008: "She's incredibly well paid for a very average 
performance."
