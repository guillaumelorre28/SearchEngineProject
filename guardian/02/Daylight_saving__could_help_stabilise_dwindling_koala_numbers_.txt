University of Queensland

tracked the movements of koalas near roads where they are often hit and killed 
by cars.

The study suggests introducing daylight saving could reduce the number of 
koalas being hit by cars by 8% on weekdays and 11% on weekends, as drivers 
change their behaviour.

As most collisions occur during twilight or darkness, extending daylight would 
reduce the number of deaths according to associate professor Robbie Wilson.

“Daylight saving time could reduce collisions with nocturnal wildlife because 
it would still be light when commuters drive home,” Wilson said.

The koala population in southeast Queensland has declined by about 80% in the 
past 20 years

“Cars are responsible for hundreds of koala deaths each year,” researcher Dr 
Bill Ellis said.
