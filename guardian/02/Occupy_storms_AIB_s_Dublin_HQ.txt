The Occupy Movement stormed the corporate headquarters of the Allied Irish 
Bank in Dublin on Wednesday evening just hours after it emerged that €1.5bn 
(£1.27bn) of Irish taxpayers' money was transferred to senior bondholders with 
the bank.

AIB, which operates at First Trust in Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> and Britain, paid the money over 
even though the bank has been in state ownership since last year.

In response Occupy activists invaded the reception area of AIB's corporate 
branch in Dublin's financial district on Wednesday afternoon.

They unfurled banners stating that "The Banks Got Bailed Out We Got Sold Out" 
and "Warning Bail Out in Progress by AIB."

Payment was due on a bond issued in 2007 by the bank which will now be paid 
out of taxpayers' money. The amount due to the bondholders is even higher than 
the €1.25bn repaid to bondholders with the now disgraced, defunct Anglo Irish 
Bank at the start of the year.

Independent Dáil deputy Stephen Donnelly criticised the payment to the bank's 
bondholders labelling the AIB payment as "criminal".

It is estimated that around €21bn of Irish taxpayers' money has been spent to 
shore up the AIB/First Trust bank in the Republic.
