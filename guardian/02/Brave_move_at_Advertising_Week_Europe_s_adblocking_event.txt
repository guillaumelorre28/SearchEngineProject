We’re only just into day three of Advertising Week Europe, and it has already 
thrown up its fair share of controversy – not least in the shape ofthe views 
expressed by Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/19/bernie-ecclestone-vladimir-putin-in-charge-europe-sir-martin-sorrell>
 on Tuesday on immigration, gender equality and Vladimir Putin.


However, Monkey notes the whole event could have descended into a brawl within 
the first hour when News UK chief customer officer, Chris Duncan, took the 
stage to discuss adblocking with Brendan Eich, the founder ofMozilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mozilla>.

Why would Monkey worry the relatively mundane issue of adblocking could have 
led to fisticuffs? Well News Corp – parent company of Duncan’s employer – is 
one of a dozen major US media companies that have sent a cease and desist order 
to Eich over his adblocking browser,Brave <https://www.brave.com/>. 

Luckily the panel was perfectly cordial, though Monkey suspects the lawyers’ 
letters are less so.
