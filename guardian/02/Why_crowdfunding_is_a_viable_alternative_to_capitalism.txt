Crowdfunding is just capitalism by another name, according to one of the 
attendees I spoke with atActivate Summit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/activate-london> in July.

I get why he felt that way after such a long day of talks – a steady stream of 
crowdfunding experts with relentless enthusiasm talking about how it's going to 
change everything. All that hype. But he was complaining to the wrong person. 
I'm in the camp that believes the market growth fuelled by crowdfunding is much 
more important than just another flavour of capitalism.

Crowdfunding <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/crowdfunding> is an 
enabler of the total overhaul of every aspect of production.

Perhaps this is revisionist history before its time, but I'm hopeful we'll 
look back at the many institutions created by the industrial revolution, 
designed to prefabricate the world for consumption, and see them eroding over 
time, replaced with people-powered processes and products that help us create 
and grow things, to strengthen our relationships with one another, the 
institutions that support us and the environment.

At a basic level we're seeing people take back control of production.

People are using these new crowdfunding markets to get backing for ideas 
before they are made, a step in the production process that bakes in the 
customer appetite. Increasingly, the manufacturing process for just about 
everything relies on a distributed networked supply chain rather than a string 
of dependencies and expensive capital investments. And distribution happens 
through a cycle of development, evolution and redistribution, rather than a one 
time manufacture and deliver model.

At a macro level, we are witnesses to a deconstruction and redistribution of 
every aspect of making things – a revolution with deeper implications than 
imagined when the internet first began. The American dream is being realised at 
super scale.

Academics will surely call this era Preconstructionism – or a similar term 
that symbolises the change in emphasis from the output of things to the process 
of creation itself.

While many aspects of the manufacturing process have opened up and become 
collaborative experiences, it wasn't until crowdfunding came along that the new 
production model found a consistent supply of commercial fuel. And now that the 
marketplace has its method of payment established, I think we're about to see 
enormous growth in this space.

It's quickly becoming a viable reality for all types of production, from 
consumer electronics to real estate projects to journalism – as we're seeing

Yes, crowdfunding can be considered capitalism by another name, but that's 
like saying the internet is just another media channel. Investor John Doerr 
once said during the first dotcom boom that the internet is underhyped. 
Likewise, today I think we're miles away from crowdfunding's peak hype and even 
further from realising its potential.
