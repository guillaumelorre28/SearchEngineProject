Q I wonder what you think about all the free offers that you get from store 
cards, particularly at this time of year when you are doing more shopping than 
normal. Some of them are offering 10% off, which seems quite a good deal, but 
someone told me that they are essentially a complete rip-off?

TB 

A It is difficult to move in the shops right now without being offered some 
tempting introductory deal, and there is usually a friendly shop assistant who 
promises that the sign-up process will only take a few minutes. It is hard not 
to turn down a discount of 10% off the clothes or goods you are about to buy.

Before you decide to go ahead, however, think about what you will use the card 
for. For example, if you buy most of your clothes at one particular shop, it 
may be worth getting a store card to enjoy sale previews and loyalty discounts. 
But you still need to be aware that store cards charge extremely high interest 
rates if you fail to pay off your debt each month.

While ordinary credit cards charge from 15% APR - not a particularly good deal 
- store cards tend to levy 25 to 30% on unpaid balances. You are unlikely to be 
able to use them in any other shop, and you could end up with a fistful of 
cards that you really don't need or want, just for a quick discount. Some don't 
even give you a discount on the spot: you have to sign up and then wait for the 
card before you can take advantage of the offer.

A much better option is to ignore the enticements and find a credit card with 
a more competitive rate of interest. Guardian Unlimited Money'sCompare & Buy

you to do this. Better still, if you have got no discipline and you know it, do 
not take on a credit card at all.
