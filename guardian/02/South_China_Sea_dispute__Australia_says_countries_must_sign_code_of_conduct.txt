Australia has urged China and south-east Asian countries squabbling over 
territory in the SouthChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> Sea to 
sign a code of conduct immediately.

The defence minister, Kevin Andrews 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/kevin-andrews>, issued a veiled 
swipe at China during a speech to an Asia Pacific security summit in Singapore 
on Sunday.

“We are particularly concerned at the prospect of militarisation of artificial 
structures,” Andrews told the summit, a reference to reports China had moved 
heavy weapons onto contested man-made islands a month ago.

China maintains it has sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, which is 
a major global shipping route and reportedly has oil and gas reserves.

It has ramped up construction of artificial islands in recent months, in a 
move some experts believe is aimed at bolstering its territorial claims.

Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines <https://www.theguardian.com/world/philippines>
, Taiwan and Brunei also claim parts of the sea.


Andrews said Australia was opposed to “coercive or unilateral actions” and hit 
out at “any large scale land reclamation activity by claimants”.

“It is therefore important that countries agree as soon as possible on a 
substantive code of conduct for the South China Sea between Asean members and 
China,” Mr Andrews said.

He called for all parties to exercise restraint, halt reclamation activities, 
refrain from provocative actions and ease tensions.

“When tensions are high, the risks of miscalculation resulting in conflict are 
very real,” he said.

A US navy surveillance aircraft flew above the disputed Spratly islands last 
week, which sparked outrage from China.
