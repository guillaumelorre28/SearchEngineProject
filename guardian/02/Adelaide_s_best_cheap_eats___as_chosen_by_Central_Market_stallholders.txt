Saturday morning, and Adelaide Central Market 
<http://www.adelaidecentralmarket.com.au/> is heaving. A crowd circles the 
cheese counters, determined-looking shoppers eye up the best fruit and veg. 
There’s a swift trade at the bread stalls and a waft of decent coffee across it 
all. It is the kind of market that every city wishes it had. So who better to 
ask for tips on where to eat inexpensively and well in Adelaide? We persuaded 
10 of the market’s stallholders to share their favourite reasonably priced 
haunts with us: from cheap Italian to crispy duck to wine-bar small plates. 
They vary in price range – but each offers good value. Add your own 
recommendations in the comments.

Parwana Afghan Restaurant: 124B Henley Beach Road, Torrensville – nominated by 
Karah Hogarth,Pickle in the Middle <http://pickleinthemiddle.com.au/>

Parwana Afghan Restaurant 
<http://www.onthechoppingboard.com/2013/01/parwana-afghan-restaurant.html> is a 
family-run restaurant highly regarded for its authentic Afghani dishes. It has 
bright mosaic tiles on the floor and family photos hung on the walls. Karah 
Horgath says the “welcoming atmosphere feels like you are walking into 
someone’s colourful family home”. Cash-only and BYO, enjoy your dinner at one 
of the big communal tables. The dish Horgath most looks forward to is the 
kabuli pawlaw ($18), pilaf rice with basmati and candied orange peel and flaked 
almonds. Other picks include the mantu steamed dumplings ($20) with meat and 
vegetables, served in a yoghurt sauce, and the eggplant banjan borani ($14).

It was the first street in Adelaide to introduce alfresco dining and now 
Rundle Street is filled with tables. Customers at Eros Kafe can sit outside or 
head indoors where the blue wallpapered walls are decorated with framed vintage 
Greek advertisements for cigarettes, coffee and ouzo. Peter Pessios recommends 
the morning offerings as “totally different from a regular breakfast”. The cafe 
offers Australian and Greek flavours, with bacon and eggs ($12.90) sitting 
alongside yaourti ($12.90), yoghurt with poached figs and crushed walnut, or 
tiropita ($8.90), filo pastry cheese with fig and tomato relish. The cafe is 
also known for its meze platters served from mid-afternoon. Try the dolmathes 
($12.90), kataifi prawns ($17.50), and octopus tis skaras ($16.90).

 Paul Noakes of Gourmet to Go. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian 
“You don’t have to go into the city to get to a decent cafe,” says Paul 
Noakes. Loveon Cafe & Deli sits in a old milk bar right in the heart of Mile 
End, just to the west of Adelaide city. The orange coffee machine is striking 
and customers can choose from a big, welcoming rustic centre bench for communal 
dining or small tables around the perimeter of the room. Paul is a regular for 
their “excellent coffee”.


“The atmosphere is really good. It’s relaxed and child-friendly,” he says. A 
favourite for brunch, you’ll find fresh juice ($6) and good coffee (from $2.90) 
of course, and breakfast staples such as mushrooms on toast ($12) and pancakes 
($10.50). Lunch offerings tend to be sandwiches and wraps ($9.90), including 
grilled tilapia with caramelised onion and chipotle mayo, or pastrami on rye.

Tucked away in the Grote Street corner of Central Market is SunMi’s Sushi. You 
can eat at the small counter bench, but most customers move to the collection 
of odd tables collected under murals from local street artists. SunMi’s serves 
good sushi (from $3.30) and a variety of Korean foods, including kimchi chigae 
($7.50) and spicy seafood noodle soup ($7.90) but their specialty, and a 
favourite of Bill Howison, is hot stonebibimbap 
<http://mykoreankitchen.com/2013/07/12/bibimbap-korean-mixed-rice-with-meat-and-assorted-vegetables/>
 ($12): a dish of steamed rice, pickled vegetables, kimchi noodles, spring 
onion, braised beef and fried egg. Howison discovered the dish after “reading 
about Singapore taxi driver food. It comes in big bowls, and they used to eat 
it while driving, and exchange dirty bowls for full ones – a real Singapore 
taxi driver culture.”

Tucked away at the back of Renaissance Arcade in Adelaide’s main shopping 
strip, is NanYang Cafe, selling traditional hawker food. The basic, cash-only 
cafe is a popular lunch spot, particularly with city workers and university 
students, with lines stretching out the door. Order first, and then find a seat 
over the two floors. Lucinna Chua visits during busy shopping days: the cafe’s 
wonton noodles ($8.60) are her “comfort food” she says. Other favourites from 
the menu are chicken laksa ($8.60) and roast duck ($9.10).

Adelaide has a sprinkling of intimate wine bars, with Cantina Sociale one of 
the more unique spots. It’s also Jen Pedder’s local. The small corner shop has 
a rustic feel, with plaster giving way to brick, and exposed globes lighting 
the space. On the back wall, you’ll find the bar’s centrepiece: the wine 
barrels from which staff will pour you a glass of wine. (From $9 a glass). 
Pedder is a fan of the “cool and interesting wine varieties”. To go with your 
Lagrein, Montepulciano or Nero d’avola, there is a concise list of tapas. Try 
mussels ($12), duck liver pâté with beetroot jelly ($10), or – aptly for Pedder 
– some cheese (individual servings $5). The selection changes weekly: past 
offerings have included espresso cheese – an American-style moist parmesan with 
freshly ground espresso beans rubbed on the outside – and, naturally, the 
Spanish sheep’s milk cheese manchego.

Lucia’s Pizzeria & Spaghetti Bar, established in 1957, is an Adelaide 
institution. It’s maintained its decor for decades: an old black-and-white 
tiled floor, small orange coffee tables, wood panelling, and big glass windows 
looking out over the market. The bar is known for its great coffee (from 
$3.40), and is particularly popular on Saturday mornings for those in search of 
the full egg and bacon breakfast ($12). Pasta fan Lee Bugeja is a regular at 
lunch and Friday nights, when his favourite meal is pasta with bolognese 
($12.50). “It’s great because they use veal and beef mince,” he says, “and with 
that you get a really good flavour.”

The Hyde Park strip of King William road is home to a thriving cafe culture – 
and Jo Dunn calls Parisis, which serves modern Italian cuisine, “the best 
restaurant in Adelaide”. The room’s main feature is a large wood-fired pizza 
oven, but most customers choose the outdoor courtyard where you sit in a 
cast-iron cage, under modern chandeliers. Parisis is not the cheapest place in 
Adelaide to grab a pizza, but at $17 for a napolitana ranging to $32 for a 
pollo gambero, it’s good value for the quality. It’s always worth saving a spot 
for desert: Dunn recommends you finish with the chocolate mousse ($13.50).

At the southern end of the city, away from the city’s restaurant strips, is 
Feliciano. With its small handful of white-clothed tables, open kitchen and 
exposed brick walls, it looks like any other recently renovated eatery. But 
chef Dominic Pelosi’s ethos is certainly not standard. With no set menu Pelosi 
chooses what to cook based on mood and available ingredients. There are no set 
hours, instead you’ll have to phone ahead on (08) 8410 0222 (there is also no 
website). Feliciano won’t be to everyone’s taste, but Ross Savvas is a big fan 
of Pelosi’s “old-school Italian cooking” and the feeling that you’re just being 
welcomed into someone’s kitchen. The baked pasta is, “absolutely delicious, in 
those old aluminum trays, like grandma used to use,” he promises.

In the heart of Adelaide’s Chinatown district, looking out over Gouger Street, 
BBQ City’s window display of crispy-skin ducks and barbecue ribs lives up to 
the restaurant’ name. Inside, the focus is all on the food: park yourself on a 
pink vinyl chair around one of the plastic tables. Frank Turtur visits weekly 
with several other market traders. “The mixed platters are great: with pork, 
chicken, and a really nice duck,” he says ($15 small/$22 large). Add bean curd 
($12) and fried rice ($8).
