Hewlett-Packard <https://www.theguardian.com/business/hewlettpackard> is to 
pay $100m (£65m) to settle a lawsuit brought by a Dutch pension fund over its 
controversial $11bn purchase of British software firm Autonomy.

The Californian technology company confirmed on Tuesday it had struck an 
agreement with PGGM Vermogensbeheer, which launched a claim for damages after 
HP’s decision to write down the value of Autonomy by $8.8 bn. HP blamed 
accounting improprieties atAutonomy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/autonomycorporation>, and its share price 
crashed after the announcement.

“While HP believes the action has no merit, it is desirable and beneficial to 
HP and its shareholders to resolve settle the case as further litigation would 
be burdensome and protracted,” the company said.

Under the terms of the settlement, HP’s insurance will pay $100m to a 
settlement fund that will be used to compensate those who bought HP shares 
during the period from 19 August 2011 to 20 November 2012.

“No individual is contributing to the settlement. HP and its current and 
former officers, directors, and advisors will be released from any 
Autonomy-related securities claims as part of the settlement,” HP said.

Autonomy’s founder, Mike Lynch, who is thought to have made much of his 
estimated £500m fortune from selling his company, is locked in a legal tussle 
with HP, which has accused him of fraud. He and his finance director, Sushovan 
Hussain, deny all claims that they misrepresented Autonomy’s financial 
performance, but HP is seeking $5.1bn in damages from them in a suit filed in 
the UK high court.
