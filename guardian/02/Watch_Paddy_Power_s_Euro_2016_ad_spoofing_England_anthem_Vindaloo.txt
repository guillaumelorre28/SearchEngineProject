Johnsonville: ‘Jeff and His Forest Friends’ (starts at 00:04) - US

Johnsonville decided to ask some of its long-serving employees to decide what 
should happen in its latest TV commercial – and the outcome is very 
entertaining. Once his suggestion had been illustrated by directors Adam & 
Dave, the daft charm of Jeff’s idea was unleashed to great effect.

Lawn Tennis Association: ‘Go Hit It’ (starts at 01:07) - UK

Part of the Lawn Tennis Association’s brief is to get people playing the sport 
at a local level. Every year, enthusiasm for this peaks around the Wimbledon 
fortnight so the LTA have decided to get ahead of the game this year by 
encouraging us to get started long before the covers are removed from Centre 
Court – with a film that examines the sport at an amateur level through the 
prism of professional commentary.

Paddy Power: ‘Scotland’ (starts at 02:11) - UK

Before a ball has even been kicked, Euro 2016 has been a success story for the 
home nations and the Republic of Ireland ... well, with one notable omission. 
Having fallen at the qualification hurdle, Scotland won’t be scrambling to find 
their passports to France, but advertising’s court jesters Paddy Power are keen 
to get the Tartan Army onside in the name of “la bantz”.

One Love Foundation: ‘Love Labyrinth’ (starts at 03:15) - US

This compelling film depicting the genesis of an abusive relationship is going 
to strike a chord with a lot of people. The insidiousness of a controlling 
personality has been depicted with an uncanny accuracy and anyone who has been 
through an unpleasant experience along these lines is bound to relate to this 
warning.
