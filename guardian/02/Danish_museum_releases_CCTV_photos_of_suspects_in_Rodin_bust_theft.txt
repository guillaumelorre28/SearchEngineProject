 One of the suspects has a bag over his shoulder which officials said could 
have been used to carry the bust – Man with the Broken Nose – out of the museum.

 The images show the men on the day of the theft, which the museum said 
occurred in July. They also show the same two men during an earlier visit to 
the museum when the police suspect they loosened the bust from its base to 
disable the alarm.

 According to the museum, it took the thieves 12 minutes to snatch the 25.5cm 
bronze bust, from the moment they entered until they left. The museum also said 
it was clear they were professional art thieves.

The theft of the bust, likely to be worth around 2m Danish kroner (£193,400), 
is one of the biggest art crimes inDenmark
