If humans evolved from monkeys why are there still monkeys?

I can understand the frustration here, Shane. (Shane? This is you, right?). 
Perhaps you could think of it differently? Twenty20 evolved from cricket, 
right? But no one expects cricket to die a horrible death. Not yet, anyway. The 
two forms can carry on doing what they do. Could Twenty20 have been invented 
without the silent hand of a creator? I believe, mostly, yes. The problem is, 
Shane, that you’ve seen that textbook graphic too many times of an ape 
progressing stage by stage into an upright man.Evolution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/evolution> is not really like that. Plus, 
there are women too.

How do we know the Earth isn’t flat?

 ‘The world is different to how you perceive it.’ Photograph: Image Source/Rex 
Fair enough, it’s only a few centuries ago since we sorted this one out. Let’s 
look at this a different way. What if, that time you were five years old and 
your grandfather did the “I’ve got your nose” trick, your grandfather didn’t 
really take the nose off your face, but instead pushed his thumb through his 
fingers to make it look like he had your nose in his clenched fist. It would 
explain a lot, wouldn’t it? Like why there was no blood? And why there was no 
searing pain as your nose was ripped off? The world is a bit like that. It is 
different to how you perceive it and that’s why all these things that shouldn’t 
make sense – like geography, astronomy, physics, maths and rappers who fail to 
fall off the edge of the world – make total sense.

What if the fossils were put there by God?

Genuinely, I think this too sometimes. What if he did put the fossils there? 
What if he really did create this massive planet in six days, complete with 
millions of fossils as a means of testing us? What if he chucked in the 
botflies and the brain parasites and the eyeball-dwelling worms and all the 
malaria as a way to test how much we really love him? I really like imagining 
this scenario. Let’s just sit here and think about that for a bit.

Now it’s your turn, because … what if he didn’t put the fossils there? What if 
the Earth is older and more ancient than you can imagine? What if this planet 
is about more than us? What if you are spending the limited amount of time you 
have alive on this planet being dismissive of those who study fossils without 
choosing to observe and dig and read books about how beautiful fossils really 
are and how they are just a small part of a theory you choose not to 
understand? What then?

Look at the pyramids. We couldn’t make them. So … aliens?

Be careful when putting common evolutionary tropes like this out there. For 
starters, a chimpanzee giving birth to a human would be deeply troubling to 
Darwin’s theory ofevolution <https://www.theguardian.com/science/evolution> by 
natural selection. It would imply that evolutionary cousins could give birth to 
each other and open up a world where cats give birth to dogs and dogs give 
birth to bears simply because they share ancestors. It’d be a free for all, 
essentially.

But you probably don’t care about technicalities like this. It is just an 
opinion, right? Opinions like “I’ll believe in evolution when …” can be quite 
fun when aired on Twitter. Sure, you can expect derision and some scathing 
responses from angry atheists, but you might make the news. You might end up 
with opinion pieces (like this one) dedicated to you. Good for you. Failing to 
understand the ways in which science (particularly evolution) works has its 
upsides sometimes, after all. And aren’t column inches the very essence of 
celebrity?
