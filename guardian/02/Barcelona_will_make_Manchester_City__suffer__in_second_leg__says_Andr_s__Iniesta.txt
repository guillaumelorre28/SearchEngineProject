Andrés Iniesta wants Barcelona to make Manchester City “suffer” in the 
Champions League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> last-16 
second leg on Wednesday evening at the Camp Nou.

Iniesta’s side take a 2-1 lead into the game, meaning City must score at least 
twice to progress to the quarter-finals.

After Barcelona’s impressive display against Manuel Pellegrini’s team in the 
first half of the opening leg at the Etihad Stadium last month, Iniesta is 
clear how City can be dominated again.

“We will have to go out there and play in a very comprehensive manner,” he 
said. “We need to have lots of possession so they suffer, so they are chasing 
the ball, we need to have a lot of skills and about minimising their potential. 
We have to control what is going on at every different moment – this is what we 
have to do.”

Despite City’s recent poor form in the Premier League, Iniesta said Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> need to stay alert to their 
threat. “They’re very dangerous because of their players – in just one minute 
they can turn the result upside down so at all levels we need to concentrate, 
200%. This is what we are going to do – we’re not going to make mistake of 
thinking the first result of 2-1 means there are going to be guarantees. We 
need to make them run.”

Sergio Busquets is injured so Xavi may replace him in midfield.
