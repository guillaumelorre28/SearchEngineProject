Christmas present: year's supply of fudge commemorating his historic 
non-announcement on digital radio switchover

Suggested New Year resolution: change of name to avoid unfortunate rhymes with 
"hazy" and "lazy"

Present: complete novels of Paulo Coelho, favourite writer of Gavin Patterson

Resolution: become Coelho expert as way to bromance with the BT boss, in hope 
of being kept on when ITV loses Champions League; but meanwhile renew old 
friendships at Radio 5 Live in case Plan A fails

Present: download of Nina Simone's I Put a Spell on You in tribute to the way 
their sports star-studded Santander ad managed to curse Jessica Ennis-Hill 
(injured), Rory McIlroy (worst season) and Jenson Button (ditto)

Resolution: similar pre-World Cup ad featuring stars of England's opponents, 
eg Suarez, Cavani, Buffon, Balotelli

BBC journalists

that appeared in the Picture Post in 1939. Photograph: Kurt Hutton/Getty Images 
Present: jobs at newspapers, commercial broadcasters or, for the luckiest, 
websites

Resolution: plot return to the Beeb free of the stigma of being a "lifer" with 
no outside experience, and meanwhile delete evidence of misspent years there 
from social media. Even faking gaffes "exposing" you as never having worked in 
TV or radio could be a canny ploy

Tony Hall, BBC director general

race, low section (Digital Enhancement) Stone Photograph: Getty 
Present: indoor running shoes, to aid legendary ability to scarper after 
public appearances – some journalists say Channel 4's Jay Hunt can be even 
quicker off the mark, so improved speed needed to stay No 1

Resolution: develop new signature hand gesture: newspaper picture editors are 
tiring of using "jazz hands" pics of first day photo opp back in April

Lord Patten, BBC Trust chairman

London. Rice pudding with grated chocolate. Photograph: Graham Turner for the 
Guardian 
Present: lorryload of tinned rice pud, prompted by him ruefully recalling that 
his pushing for lower executive pay and payoffs "went down like cold rice 
pudding" with Beeb fatcats - there will be many such rebuffs if he stays on, so 
he might as well develop a taste for it. Oxford marmalade supplied to help.

Resolution: find time to read daily newspaper cuttings; sack person who chose 
photo (multi-chinned, hair askew, beleaguered) forBBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> website

Present: DVD of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, ideal relaxation for editor who has 
turned paper into "Totty Times"

Resolution: further branded merchandising to follow Times gin launch, such as 
Giles Coren speaking doll (selection of potty-mouthed tirades to download), 
Baron Finkelstein duvet covers (ermine-wearing or football fan looks available) 
and My 100 Best Gags for Politicians book, version of whac-a-mole adapted as 
BBC bashing toy (Patten or Hall head pops up instead of mole)

an unproven idea. Photograph: Alamy 
Present: French wealth tax guide 2014, to ease the repercussions of his 
decision to quit London for France (against the flow of rich French tax 
fugitives coming here), which was announced the day after a Monkey item teasing 
him

Resolution: avoid Media Monkey, as well as those ghastly, vulgar English mags 
like Cosmo you were forced to oversee

Martin Clarke, head of Mail Online
 Emperor film still Photograph: Kirsty Griffin 
Present: DVD of (General Douglas) MacArthur, as prep for planned 
MacArthur-like conquest of southeast Asia by the site with imperial dreams

Resolution: install second Sideboob Alley on left side of home page, similar 
but interactive so reader can filter – only nip slips, only twerking, only 
Kardashians, only gingers, only "celebrities" I've actually heard of, etc. 
Derriere Lane to be working title, but Butt Walk might play better in US

Present: DVDs of Star Trek (Patrick Stewart era), Master and Commander: seeing 
parallel situations may help calm tensions in tricky relationship on the 
Telegraph bridge with unconventional new editor-in-chief Jason Seiken. His & 
His naval and Star Fleet uniforms as bonus gift

Resolution: develop lifelike Duchess of Cambridge robot with full wardrobe for 
emergency front-page pics on dull news days – means no longer dependent on her 
actually being out and about. If readers buy it, robots of Emma Watson, Pippa 
Middleton etc to follow

Martin Sorrell, WPP boss
 Writing like a historian: Lee Donaghy uses English to help his students' 
express their knowledge and understanding of history in language. Photograph:

Present: complete poems of Yeats, Dylan Thomas and others, as source of new 
metaphors and similes: though normally a reliable source of entertaining (often 
bath- or football-related) analogies for the state of the economy and other 
trends, the best he could manage in 2013 was the derivative "grey swans", 
meaning known unknowns

Resolution: regular yoga and other calming techniques, as the World Cup makes 
2014 one of his "maxi-quadrennial" years, which always bring a risk of the 
Napoleon of marketing getting over-excited and ordering some equivalent of 
invading Russia in winter

Evgeny Lebedev, publisher, Independent titles, i and London Evening Standard

Present: Girls Aloud don fetching feline outfits and sing Macavity from Cats 
just for him – as homage to the globe-trotting young proprietor's phenomenal 
ability to be "not there" (as GQ foreign reporter, visiting dad in Moscow and 
so on), despite running four papers and preparing to launch a TV station

Resolution: last change of editors was six months ago, so must be time for 
another: Sarah Sands at the Standard looks most vulnerable, as two years as 
editor of a Lebedev title (as with Chelsea managers under Abramovich) is far 
too long.

James Harding, director of news and current affairs, BBC 
 The highlight of the Oscars sale was a best screenplay statuette won by 
Herman Mankiewicz for Citizen Kane in 1941. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/RKO 
Present: video of 60s movie The Virgin Soldiers, reflecting his recruitment of 
beginner broadcasters like himself (Ian Katz, Kamal Ahmed) for key positions in 
empire.

Resolution: continued study of memoirs of John Birt and his 90s lieutenants 
for ideas on inventing obscure, overlapping new jobs; when anyone mentions DQF 
cuts or Hall's "slimmer BBC" mantra, pretend not to understand because arrived 
too recently
