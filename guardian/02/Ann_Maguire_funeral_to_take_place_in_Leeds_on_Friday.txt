The funeral of teacher Ann Maguire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ann-maguire>, who was stabbed to death in 
her classroom last month, will take place on Friday.

Maguire, 61, was attacked during a Spanish class she was teaching at Corpus 
Christi Catholic college in Leeds on 28 April. She died in hospital later that 
day from multiple stab wounds.

She had taught at the school for more than 40 years and was due to retire in 
September.

Tributes to Maguire have poured in from across the world. Thousands of them 
were placed on the railings outside Corpus Christi, stretching 100 metres from 
the school gates to the church next door.

Many of the messages were from current and former pupils but others were 
placed by members of the public. The sentiments were pinned to bunches of 
flowers and other mementos including teddy bears, schoolbooks, football shirts, 
school ties and guitars.

A 15-year-old boy has appeared in court charged with Maguire's murder. He is 
remanded in custody and will go on trial later this year.

Maguire's family have asked for Friday's funeral mass at the Catholic church 
of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, in Moortown, north Leeds, to remain a private 
service for close relatives and friends only.

Mourners will include Maguire's husband, Don, 62, her daughters Emma and 
Kerry, and her nephews Daniel and Andrew, who she brought up after her sister 
died nearly 30 years ago.

The mass will be followed by a private burial.
