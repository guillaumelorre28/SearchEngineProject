A contract to build an eco-friendly Welsh holiday village helped construction 
groupAlfred McAlpine scale new heights and lead the FTSE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse> 250 gainers' board yesterday.

McAlpine said it would draw on its experience on jobs such as building the 
Eden Project "biodomes" in Cornwall for the £44m deal to build Bluestone in 
Pembrokeshire and expects to complete the project by the middle of 2008.

The group also announced it had won a series of contracts worth £60m, putting 
the total additions to its order book at more than £100m. The news sent 
McAlpine's shares soaring and they closed at a high of 574p, up 25.25p, or 
4.8%. They helped buoy the FTSE 250 index of midcap shares, which closed 44.6 
points higher at 10,988.6.

Among the blue chips, Brazil and India were in focus rather than Welsh holiday 
villages. SteelmakerCorus hogged the limelight all day as a dramatic bidding 
war pushed its shares up more than 5% to an all-time high. Brazilian steel 
group Companhia Siderurgica Nacional yesterday morning dramatically leapfrogged 
the previous night's improved Tata Steel bid for Corus, raising its offer to 
£4.9bn.

City bets on the possibility of a higher offer from Tata Steel propelled 
shares in Corus to record of 529.5p in mid-session trading. They closed up 
27.25p, or 5.5%, at 527.25p.

Aside from Corus the FTSE 100 was nearly flat, closing up just 7.4 points at 
6159.8, having dipped into the red earlier in the day.

Not far behind Corus among the top gainers was Shire. The drugmaker gained 
34p, or 3.3%, to £10.65 in thin trading as rumours did the rounds. There was 
speculation Shire could bid for US-based New River Pharmaceuticals, while talk 
also resurfaced of a bid for Shire fromAstraZeneca

AstraZeneca itself was down 22p, or 0.8%, at £28.92 after analysts at 
investment bank UBS downgraded the stock to "reduce" from "neutral" and cut the 
price target to £27.00 from £34.00.

Back among the risers, Financial Times publisher Pearson was up after it 
announced it had sold its government services business to private equity group 
Veritas Capital. Pearson's shares rose 10.5p, or 1.4%, to 772p as the market 
welcomed the group's continued commitment to focusing on its education and 
information businesses.

Lloyds TSB cheered investors by predicting that its 2006 profits were likely 
to be in line with analysts' expectations. But Lloyds shares gave up much of 
their early gains by mid-afternoon, following the trend of the overall index, 
and closed up just 3p at 558.5p.

"While the spectre of vague bid speculation and a whopping 6.2% yield continue 
to lend the shares support, Lloyds TSB's 4% outperformance of the FTSE 100 over 
the last year has left the market concluding that the share price is exactly 
where it should be for now," said Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at 
Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers.

Lloyds rival Barclays managed to hold on to much of the gains made last week 
on intense speculation that it could be taken over by Bank of America for 
£60bn. Having gained 23p on Friday, Barclays shares closed at 723p, down 7p.

Elsewhere in the financial sector, Prudential rose 8.5p, or 1.2%, to 694.5p 
after news that the insurer had rejected an approach for its internet bank, Egg.

Among the top FTSE 100 losers, Cairn Energy shed 31p, or 1.5%, to £20.77 after 
the response to the flotation of its Cairn India unit was less strong than 
expected. Elsewhere in the energy sector, shares inRoyal Dutch Shell slipped 
amid mounting expectation Shell would hand control of the $22bn Sakhalin-2 
project to Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom. Shell shares were down 20p, or 1%, at 
£18.24.

Tobacco companies ran out of puff, with profit-taking setting in after last 
week's gains on the news of bid interest in Silk Cut makerGallaher. British 
American Tobacco was down 19p, or 1.3%, at £14.44, Imperial Tobacco was down 
36p, or 1.8%, at £20.13 and Gallaher was down 4p, or 0.3%, at £11.68.

Further down the market, Virgin Radio owner SMG picked up after it confirmed 
it had received a new merger proposal from TalkSport radio station ownerUTV. 
SMG said it had suspended its search for a new chief executive while merger 
talks with UTV progressed. SMG shares were up 3p, or 5.3%, at 59.75p, while 
UTV's London-listed shares were 8.5p lower at 378p.

Elsewhere in the media sector, shares in EMI were up 3p to 298.75p, buoyed by 
recent news of the music group's talks with private equity fund Permira on a 
potential takeover.

Troubled software group iSoft rose after its results were stronger than 
expected and it said talks on a possible bid were progressing. Market talk is 
that the interest is from Germany's Siemens. ISoft shares were up 6p, or 14.7%, 
at 46.75p.

On junior market Aim, market recruitment and training group Quantica rose 
1.5p, or 4.8%, to 32.5p after it announced the sale of its training business to 
Carter & Carter for £12m cash. Analysts at Quantica's house broker Bridgewell 
raised their rating on the stock to "overweight" from "neutral". "This disposal 
will either lead to the start of an acquisition programme ... or conceivably a 
bid for the company itself," they said.

Missed target

Theratase, which supplies enzymes to the medical diagnostic industry, is 
expected to report full year results today. Its shares stand at 61p but last 
month they jumped from 49p to 63p in the space of a few days. During this 
period, acquisitive diagnostics firmBBI revealed it had almost reached 
agreement to take over a company, but theshare price of its target ran too high 
to make the deal viable. "The BBI board thought it had reached agreement with 
the target company's board on the basis it was prepared to recommend this to 
its shareholders," BBI said at the time. "Since then, the value of the target 
has moved against us and made the transactionfinancially unattractive." 
Analysts believe Theratase was that target, and will be keen to hear further 
news today.
