“essential and enjoyable reading for anyone who wants to understand the shifts 
in modern politics”.

“Their story relies on an impressive amount of data and their analysis has 
been borne out by recent events,” said the judges.

Book Two, a look at the years 1959-1962, while the political fiction gong was 
won by Terry Stiastny’s tale of state secrets gone missing, Acts of Omission.

Former home secretary Charles Clarke’s The Too Difficult Box, a look at “the 
big issues politicians can’t crack”, beat former prime minister Gordon Brown’s 
My Scotland, Our Britain to win the practical politics book of the year; 
Guardian cartoonistMartin Rowson’s The Coalition Book  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/29/martin-rowson-cartoons-coalition-vilest-government>

Inconvenient Genocide: Who Now Remembers the Armenians? was named polemic of 
the year.

Andrew Marr, meanwhile, missed out on the political fiction prize, for which 
his novelHead of State  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/14/head-of-state-review-andrew-marr-political-thriller>
had been shortlisted, but was presented with a lifetime achievement award for 
political writing by his colleague on the Andrew Marr Show, producer Barney 
Jones.

The awards were founded by Iain Dale, who said that “2015 is a massive year 
for everyone in politics, and by definition anyone who writes about it”.

“The role of these awards in showcasing and encouraging the finest political 
writing has never been more significant,” he added. “These are the books that 
have helped shape our thinking and will continue to do so right up to the 
general election and beyond.”
