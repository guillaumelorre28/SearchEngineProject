The Arizona Cardinals beat the Minnesota Vikings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/minnesota-vikings> 23-20 at the University 
of Phoenix Stadium on Thursday to secure a play-off spot. But they need to wait 
until Sunday to know if they have secured the NFC West title.

The Cardinals blew a 10-point fourth-quarter lead, but a 47-yard field goal 
from Chandler Catanzaro, his third of the game, with less than two minutes of 
the match remaining broke a tie and gave the home team a winning margin.

The Vikings had a chance to win it or at least force overtime but the veteran 
pass rusher Dwight Freeney forced a fumble by Teddy Bridgewater that was 
recovered by the Cardinals defensive end Calais Campbell with five seconds to 
go.

The Cardinals (11-2) extended their winning streak to seven games and they can 
claim their first division title since 2009 if the Seattle Seahawks lose or tie 
at Baltimore on Sunday.

The Arizona quarterback Carson Palmer worked over a depleted Minnesota defence 
that was missing a handful of starters, throwing for 310 yards and two 
touchdowns. He has 31 scoring passes for the year, breaking Kurt Warnerâ€™s 
single-season franchise record.

The loss was the third in four weeks for the Vikings, who are now jockeying to 
stay in play-off contention.
