How long do you have to wait to access treatment for an eating disorder in 
England?


Longer than you might imagine, according to newly published NHS data, which 
shows waiting times of up to 182 days 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/07/patients-eating-disorders-waiting-times-182-days-treatment>
; a worrying statistic given the severity of illnesses such as anorexia.

The data also showed that since 2012, 1,576 people, from 41 of 55 NHS trusts, 
have waited 18 weeks to see a specialist. A total of 742 waited for 26 weeks, 
while 99 waited a year. In response, the eating disorder charityBeat 
<https://www.b-eat.co.uk/> has said that early intervention is critical.
