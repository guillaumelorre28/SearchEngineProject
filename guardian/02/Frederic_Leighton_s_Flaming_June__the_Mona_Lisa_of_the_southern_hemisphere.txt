Eyes wide shut

Unconscious women, be they sleeping, entranced or dead, are a bit of a fixture 
in Victorian painting. Frederic, Lord Leighton’s Flaming June is one of the 
most famous; the other is Millais’s drowning Ophelia.

Dream lover

Leighton’s sleeping beauty, though, seems untroubled. The painting is a peachy 
confection. It blooms with tantalising, luxurious life. She’s both physically 
present yet psychically remote, lost in a dream.

Teacher’s pet

Some have suggested that the model is Leighton’s muse, the actor Dorothy Dene. 
He paid for her elocution lessons and their relationship apparently inspired 
George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion.

Rags to riches

The painting is so ubiquitous today, it’s hard to believe it was lost for 30 
years following its removal from the Ashmolean. Andrew Lloyd Webber spotted it 
for £50 in an antiques shop in the 1960s but his granny refused to lend him the 
dosh. Today, Puerto Rico’s Museo de Arte de Ponce is its regular home, where 
it’s known as the Mona Lisa of the southern hemisphere.
