 last week, they’ve seen it shoot up into the US iTunes top five. The news 
follows a string of wildly received live shows by the bluesy band.

This self-titled, full-band album looks set to capitalise on the buzz. It’s 
coming out on Stax, which should give you a rough idea of where Rateliff is 
coming from – steeped in old soul and blues records, it’s music delivered with 
gusto.

Rateliff says the songs are about “the struggles I’ve had in my life – 
drinking too much, that kind of crap … and then the relationships we all have. 
I’m not a great communicator in my personal life, so it’s funny to be writing 
songs that say the things that I’m never very good at saying.”
