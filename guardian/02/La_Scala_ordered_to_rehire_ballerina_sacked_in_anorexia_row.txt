Italy’s top court has ordered the rehiring of a La Scala ballerina sacked 
after suggesting the company’s dance school was responsible for anorexia among 
its young dancers.

 unfairly in 2012, the court of cassation concluded in a definitive ruling on a 
case that turned the spotlight on eating disorders in the high-pressure world 
of professional ballet.

Now 37, Garritano has told Italian media she is ready for a return to the 
stage – even if that looks unlikely to be at La Scala, which has refused 
requests for comment on the written court order since it was issued on Friday.

“All I am waiting for is a call from La Scala,” Garritano said in an interview 
with Milan daily Il Giorno, while acknowledging there had been no contact from 
the company about a ruling that confirms an October 2014 appeal court victory.

“Already in 2014, I expected to be rehired after two years of interruption. 
Now I expect the same thing,” said Garritano, who dances under the stage name 
Mary Garrett. “I never stopped working on my physical condition to be in the 
best condition possible when the moment came.”

The dancer was dismissed for bringing the name of the company into disrepute 
with claims made in a book about her experiences and in related interviews. 
“When I was training as a teenager, the instructors would call me ’mozzarella’ 
and ‘Chinese dumpling’ in front of everyone,”she told the Observer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/04/ballerinas-la-scala-anorexic-claim>
 in December 2011.

“I reduced my eating so much that my period stopped for a year and a half when 
I was 16 and 17, and I dropped to 43 kilos [94lbs].”

Garritano said 70% of dancers who were with her at La Scala’s dance school had 
eaten so little that their periods had stopped, and linked her own recurring 
stomach pains and frequent bone fractures to extreme dieting.
