Fernando Torres <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fernando-torres> and 
Andrés Iniesta were on target as Spain dominated Bolivia for a 2-0 win on 
Friday in the first of two international friendlies before their World Cup 
defence in Brazil.

Torres calmly stroked a 51st-minute penalty, earned by Javi Martínez, down the 
middle as the goalkeeper, Romel Quiñoñez, dived right.

Spain <https://www.theguardian.com/football/spain> controlled play at the 
Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium but found it hard to convert against a well-organised 
Bolivian team before Iniesta charged forward to curl a shot round Quiñoñez in 
the 84th minute to seal victory.

Vicente del Bosque employed an experimental team, trying out different 
combinations with key Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid players still missing 
following the Champions League final last week.

The Spain coach will announce his 23-man squad for next month’s tournament on 
Saturday.
