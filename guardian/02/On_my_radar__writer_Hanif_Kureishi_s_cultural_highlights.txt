The Freud Museum <http://www.freud.org.uk/>, London


This is in the house in Hampstead where Sigmund Freud 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2014/mar/10/neuroscience-history-science>
 lived and died after he came to London. It is a fascinating place. As well as 
significant objects from his life, including his couch, it has a great library 
and a lovely garden. They have fantastic talks given by all sorts of people, 
not only psychoanalysts, but artists, sculptors, writers, on a huge range of 
subjects. Like most artists, from James Joyce to Hitchcock, I have an abiding 
interest in the unconscious and the Freud Museum is a reminder that so much of 
the language we use to talk about ourselves – both words and concepts such as 
neuroses, phobias, fears, excitements, authority figures – derives from him and 
his work.

The Young Vic <http://www.youngvic.org/>, London


One of the main reasons I like the Young Vic is that the audience is 
fantastically diverse, nothing like the Jurassic lot you get at most London 
opera and theatre productions. There are always a lot of young people there and 
a mix of races and backgrounds. They invariably produce top work from some of 
the best actors and playwrights in the world. Highlights for me have been a 
wonderful version ofThree Sisters directed by Benedict Andrew 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/23/love-information-three-sisters-steptoe>
 in 2012 and Chiwetel Ejiofor in a stunning production ofA Season in the Congo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jul/17/a-season-in-the-congo-review> 
two summers ago. I love the way the auditorium looks different for every 
production because they make use of every possible part of the building.

 The Key by Junichiro Tanizaki: ‘cleverly constructed’. 
3 | Book
The Key by Jun’ichiro Tanizaki 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Key_(Tanizaki_novel)>


This is a wonderful novel written in 1956. It’s a classic of world literature, 
about a middle-aged couple, with a daughter, who have been married for a long 
time. The wife is very inhibited but she begins drinking and when she drinks 
she falls into a dead faint. The husband starts to take photographs of her 
drunk and naked and to have sexual relations with her while she’s in that 
state. He shows the photographs to a friend of his daughter who develops them 
and also becomes sexually obsessed with the wife and begins a sexual 
relationship with her. It’s a novel of perversion, not least because the 
husband is obsessed with his wife’s feet, and it is also about inhibition and 
the inability of a couple to really speak to each other. I first discovered it 
about 10 years and I’ve been re-reading it recently because it is so cleverly 
constructed. It is all written through their diaries, so there’s no authorial 
voice, which makes it feel very contemporary.

Notorious (Alfred Hitchcock, 1946) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/18/notorious-hitchcock-review-philip-french>


This is a film made by Hitchcock in 1946, starring Ingrid Bergman and Cary 
Grant, partly set in Rio. Grant plays a British agent who is in love with 
Bergman. Due to a series of misunderstandings, she begins a relationship with 
and marries a man who is a suspect in Grant’s secret investigation into an 
organisation of Nazis who have moved to Brazil after the second world war. I’ve 
recently started watching Hitchcock again because I’m very interested in how it 
was possible for somebody to be a major artist, as he undoubtedly was, but also 
to be a popular artist, making thrillers for mass audiences. And because I am a 
teacher of creative writing I am very interested in structure and I am very 
interested in anxiety. One of the things Hitchcock was unmatched at was 
creating anxiety in the audience. By the time you’re three quarters of the way 
through the film, you’re extremely anxious about the outcome. You really want 
to know what’s going to happen. How did he do that? It’s a fascinating 
accomplishment.

Creation by Keith Jarrett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/14/keith-jarrett-creation-review>


This is Jarrett’s first solo album for a few years, and I think it’s great. I 
have been a fan of his since he played with Miles Davis in the 1960s.The Köln 
Concert is one of my favourite records of all time. I listen to a lot of jazz 
when I am writing, reasonably quiet jazz like Jarrett’s.He’s 70 now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/10/keith-jarrett-70-greatest-living-musican-geoff-dyer>
 and he is a man who has remained creative his whole life. Unlike most of us, 
his work is always surprising and new and refreshed. And he does these amazing 
improvisations. He sits down and makes this stuff up in front of you. It’s very 
exciting to think that this man is pulling something off live in front of you 
and he has no idea where it is going to go next. I’m very interested in that in 
the context of writing because in a sense all writing, at least at the 
beginning, is a form of improvisation. You start with nothing and by the end of 
the day there is a story that you have told almost by mistake, or at an angle 
from yourself, that you didn’t know before.

Café Rouge, Shepherd’s Bush 
<http://www.caferouge.com/french-restaurant/shepherds-bush>, London 


The Café Rouge is, of course, a chain and not known for the delicacy of its 
food or the number of Michelin stars it has won (or not). But it is my local 
and my theory about this – I guess because I grew up in the 1960s when everyone 
went to pubs – is that you need a local. You need a local to go to at the end 
of the day to gossip with your mates. I meet my friends at the Café Rouge three 
or four times a week. I try to avoid the food but I’ll have a beer or a coffee 
and we talk. We talk about politics, the EU, about our friends, our sex lives, 
who’s getting divorced, who’s getting married, the state of the world, how 
terrible things are, about our health, who’s dying, who’s still alive, who’s 
having an operation. This form of gossip, both high and low, is essential for a 
person’s healthy state of mind and relationship with the world. It’s especially 
important for me because writing is so solitary. I sit in a room all day 
scribbling away by myself. By 5pm I need to get out and away from the horror of 
my own imagination.
