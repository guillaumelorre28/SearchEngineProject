Amtrak trains began rolling on Monday on America’s busiest passenger rail 
corridor almost a week after a deadly crash inPhiladelphia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia>, where investigators are 
working to determine the cause of the derailment.


Company president Joseph Boardman said Amtrak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/amtrak> staff and crew worked around the 
clock to restore the service following Tuesday night’s crash that killed eight 
people and injured more than 200 others.

Federal regulators on Saturday ordered Amtrak to expand use of a speed-control 
system long in effect for southbound trains near the crash site to northbound 
trains in the same area.

Federal Railroad Administration spokesman Kevin Thompson said Sunday the 
automatic train control system was now fully operational on the northbound 
tracks. Trains going through that section of track will be governed by the 
system, which alerts drivers to slow down when their trains go too fast and 
automatically applies the brakes if the train continues to speed.

The agency also ordered Amtrak to examine all curves along the Northeast 
Corridor and determine if more can be done to improve safety, and to add more 
speed limit signs along the route.

US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told the 150 people present at 
Sunday’s service that Amtrak’s action on the ordered changes was one way to 
honor the eight passengers killed in the crash. Many were riding home to their 
families, he said.

Almost 20 people injured in the train crash remain in Philadelphia hospitals, 
five in critical condition. All are expected to survive.
