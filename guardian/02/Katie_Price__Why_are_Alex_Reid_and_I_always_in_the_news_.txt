And finally, Lost in Showbiz is delighted to report a lone voice of common 
sense cutting through the madness surroundingKatie Price 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/katieprice>'s divorce from Alex "The 
Reidinator" Reid <http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/alex-reid>: the 
tittle-tattle, the speculation, the gossip mag headlines, of which LiS's 
favourite was "JORDAN EXPLODES", with its tantalising suggestion of spontaneous 
combustion. That lone voice is Price herself, complaining via a social 
networking site: "Wish people would concentrate on real news not what's 
speculated about people's relationships." Of course she does. After all, what 
was she doing selling photographs to the press of herself and the Reidinator at 
dinner in the Maldives over Christmas, other than sending out a plaintive 
message: "Please leave me alone. Concentrate on the real news. Perhaps these 
photographs of myself and the Reidinator at dinner DISCUSSING WHETHER ED 
MILIBAND IS CAPABLE OF LEADING THE LABOUR PARTY TO A NEW MIDDLE GROUND AWAY 
FROM NEW LABOUR'S TARNISHED NEOLIBERAL CONSENSUS will inspire you."
