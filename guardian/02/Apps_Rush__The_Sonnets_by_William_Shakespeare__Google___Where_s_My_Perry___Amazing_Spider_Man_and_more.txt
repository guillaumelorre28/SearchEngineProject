Where's My Perry? 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wheres-my-perry/id528805631?mt=8>

Where's My Water? was Disney's first attempt to create a brand new character 
in a mobile app, rather than rely on Mickey and co. Now there's a sequel, but 
starring an established character this time: Perry the Platypus from cartoon 
show Phineas and Ferb. The gameplay remains physics-based water puzzles.

Belkin @TV for iPad 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/belkin-tv-for-ipad/id532583495?mt=8>

Yes, Belkin really does have a gadget called @TV, which makes me wiggle in 
embarrassment on their behalf. It's interesting though: hardware to enable you 
to watch live and recorded TV on mobile devices. In this case, the app is for 
iPad, streaming over 3G/4G and Wi-Fi, with a channel guide built in.
