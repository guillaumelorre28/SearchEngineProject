 One of the factors contributing to the problems of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a refugee 
from Muslim extremist threats in the Netherlands (News, last week), appears to 
be the undue deference of the Dutch Government to religious leaders who do not 
represent the whole of their community.
In the face of claims by 'community leaders' in the UK to represent their 
communities, the Government should consider the fate of women and young people 
in such groups.

 Schools scandal 


The 'culture of going to Oxbridge' that Charles Clarke identifies (News, last 
week) arises in no small part from the levels of funding that independent 
schools receive.

How does Mr Clarke envisage this culture being created in the state sector 
without a massive increase in funding for state schools?

 No rail strikes 


Richard Ingrams (Comment, last week) refers to the threat of 'suicide boats 
and trains'. Al-Qaeda has yet to engage with the British rail network. The idea 
that it can do anything with pinpoint accuracy will stretch the imagination of 
millions of commuters.
