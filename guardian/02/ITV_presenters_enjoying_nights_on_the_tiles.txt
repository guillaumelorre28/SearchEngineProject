Forget about the Champions League rivalry between Manchester United and Real 
Madrid, the real hotbed of cut-throat competition is going on behind the scenes 
ofITV's live football coverage – a Scrabble tournament between presenter Adrian 
Chiles <https://www.theguardian.com/media/adrian-chiles> and pundit Lee Dixon. 
"I've genuinely always enjoyed Scrabble," Chiles told the new issue of Radio 
Times. "And because we do so much travelling, I thought it would be a good idea 
to entice Lee into playing." It probably didn't feel like quite such a good 
thing after Dixon beat him 13-6 last year, although Chiles – is this too much 
information yet? – is 3-1 up in 2013. Dixon followed Chiles from the Match of 
the Day sofa to ITV. "Match of the Day 2 changed when Adrian left," Dixon told 
the listings mag. "I also missed covering live games and I wasn't looking 
forward to going into work any more. At the BBC you're never commenting on live 
games. It's all studio work, going to Manchester and sitting in a box for two 
days." As for Chiles, he couldn't wait to be working with Dixon again. "Lee was 
the first ex-pro who I never felt was judging me for not having played the 
game," said Chiles. "He respected me as a broadcaster and it just felt right 
between us" But not everyone respects their love of Scrabble, including a 
fellow ITV football pundit. "Roy Keane just won't have anything to do with it," 
said Chiles. "But Gareth Southgate is a decent if somewhat naive player." Naive 
– no bad thing, especially if you land the V on a triple letter score.
