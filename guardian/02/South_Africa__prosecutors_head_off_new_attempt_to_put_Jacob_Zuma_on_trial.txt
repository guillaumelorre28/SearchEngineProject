The National Prosecuting Authority applied to the country’s highest court for 
leave to appeal a high court ruling to restore the charges, set aside in 2009, 
shortly before Zuma came to power.

Zuma has battled several corruption scandals while in office. In the run-up to 
next month’s local elections, he has faced growing criticism over record 
unemployment levels and poor economic growth.

The 783 charges relate to alleged corruption, racketeering, fraud and money 
laundering over a multi-billion dollar arms deal in the 1990s.

“The appeal papers were filed today with the Constitutional Court,” a NPA 
spokeswoman said.

In 2009, state prosecutors justified dropping the charges by saying tapped 
phone calls between officials in then-president Thabo Mbeki’s administration 
showed undue interference in the case.

The move cleared the way for Zuma, leader of the African National Congress 
party, to be elected as South Africa’s president just weeks later.

The tapped phone recordings, which became known as the “spy tapes”, were kept 
secret until they were released in 2014 after a legal battle fought by the main 
opposition party, the Democratic Alliance.

The DA on Friday accused the NPA of “an endeavour to shield the president” and 
said it expected the appeal application to fail.

Zuma, 74, will have completed two terms in 2019 and is not eligible to run for 
president again.
