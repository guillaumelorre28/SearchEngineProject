<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/31/richard-curtis-about-time-retirement>
.

"This probably will be the last film I will direct," he told Empire magazine 
in an interview discussing his latest release,About Time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155249/about-time>. The film features 
Domhnall Gleeson travelling through time in a bid to change his past and have a 
better future – and its plot lead our writer to question why it's almost always 
men who get to be cinematic time travellers, andso rarely women

Curtis wasn't the only big name hinting at retirement this week – Johnny Depp 
is considering quitting acting in the near future,he told the BBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/29/johnny-depp-retire-acting-soon> – 
although, ifthis poll of Guardian readers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/poll/2013/jul/29/poll-johnny-depp-retire-acting>
 is anything to go by, film fans would be sorry to see him go.
