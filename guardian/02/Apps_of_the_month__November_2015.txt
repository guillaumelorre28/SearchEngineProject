iOS <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boomerang-from-instagram/id1041596399?mt=8>

Instagram’s latest spin-off app is Boomerang, a tool for creating “mini 
videos” from 10 photos taken in a fast burst, which then loop. File alongside 
animated gifs and Vine clips, with plenty of potential for creativity – or 
plain silliness.

PAUSE


iOS

Mindfulness is all the rage in tech circles and beyond. Pause aims to bring 
the art of relaxation to the smartphone. Based on tai chi, it gets you gently 
rubbing your finger on the screen for a few minutes: a useful reminder to take 
a break in the day.

Another photography app: this one aimed at anyone running out of space to 
store shots on their smartphone. This promises you 100GB of space on Camra’s 
servers, plus features to share pics privately with contacts. Flickr and Google

of genetics. They’re encouraged to experiment by playing the DNA-based puzzles 
to make different beasts.

Quiz game Trivia Crack has been a global hit, and its developer wasted no time 
in launching a sequel. This time, the questions are arranged in themed 
channels, with an emphasis on challenging friends on their (or your) pet 
subjects for bragging rights.

MINIONS PARADISE

<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/minions-paradise/id922318156?mt=8>

From box-office fame to small-screen stardom: this is actually the second 
Minions mobile game: a resource-management strategy game that takes the genre 
popularised by FarmVille and pumps it full of doozy yellow critters. Lots of 
fun for fans of the film.

LUMINO CITY


iOS <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumino-city/id958604518?mt=8>

Another beautiful adventure ported to mobile, with its handmade scenery giving 
it a look a world away from the average game. The gameplay matches the visuals 
for quality, though: an absorbing collection of mechanical puzzles that works 
marvellously on touchscreens.

There have been several Walking Dead mobile games already, but this one has 
legs – even if they’re dropping off. It’s a tactical battle game with zombies 
galore, and all the characters and settings fans of the TV show will recognise.

MOS SPEEDRUN 2

iOS <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mos-speedrun-2/id835098788?mt=8>

Platform games traditionally work best with a physical controller, but Mos 
Speedrun 2 proves touchscreens can handle the genre. It’s a finely tuned game 
where you can blaze through levels to beat your friends’ best times, or take it 
slower and explore its secrets.
