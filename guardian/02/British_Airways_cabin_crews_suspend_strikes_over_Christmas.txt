Planned strikes by British Airways 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairways> cabin crew on Christmas 
Day and Boxing Day have been suspended.

Members of Unite <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite> were due to walk 
out over Christmas in a dispute over pay. The union said workers employed in 
the so-called mixed crew – who have joined since 2010 – were on lower pay than 
other staff.

Lengthy talks at the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/18/talks-agreed-bid-avert-british-airways-christmas-strikes-unite>
 have led to a revised offer that will be put to a ballot of union members. The 
union is recommending the revised offer to its 2,700-plus mixed fleet members 
at British Airways.

The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: “Over the past four days, 
and indeed the past two years, this union has worked tirelessly to find a 
resolution to the issues causing our members concern. We now have a new offer 
from the company, which we will put to our members. The two-day strike over 
Christmas and Boxing Day is now suspended.

“It will be for our members now to decide if British Airways has done enough 
to meet their concerns. I want to pay tribute to our cabin crew members who 
have been determined to achieve a negotiated settlement. Their commitment to 
secure a better deal for all of their colleagues is something we should all 
admire.”

A BA spokesman said: “We welcome the announcement from Unite that it has 
called off the strikes scheduled for Christmas Day and Boxing Day.”
