Quote of the day

Kevin Rudd on Tony Abbott's capability to deal with international issues: 

I really do question, having known Mr Abbott for a long, long time, if he 
really has the temperament for that sort of thing.

Abbott's answer? 

If you want to know my character, ask my colleagues. If you want to know Mr 
Rudd's character, ask his colleagues.

Stats of the day

Attention accountants:

$31.6bn The savings figure the shadow treasurer, Joe Hockey, says has been 
produced under the accrual accounting method rather than traditional cash 
accounting in the next four years.

$16.6bn The difference between cash and accrual bottom lines over the (same) 
forward estimates, according to the finance minister, Penny Wong.

2015-16 Wong says if federal Labor were to use an accrual bottom line, it 
would be in surplus a year earlier, in 2015-16.

Prop of the day: the Vegemite files

Chocolate  In a grand advertising exercise for Cadbury, Abbott dragged the 
media team down to the company factory in Tasmania to announce a $16m gift – er 
grant – for innovation, manufacturing and tourism. The money will cover a cocoa 
tree trial in the Ord river, a new barcode tracking system and kick-start the 
"chocolate tour". Journos on the road with the opposition leader were busy 
tweeting their booty. It seems everyone has a price.

Candidate of the day

Peter Beattie A team of four has been driving around the Brisbane seat of 
Forde, knocking off up to 100 of Peter Beattie's campaign signs, the former 
premier claimed. Beattie said his staff had noticed the thieves chucking the 
signs in the back of a ute and a four-wheel drive and took down one of the 
number plates. You could say it was the tall poppy syndrome, but if polling is 
to be believed, Beattie won't get within cooee of knocking off the Liberal MP 
Bert van Manen.
