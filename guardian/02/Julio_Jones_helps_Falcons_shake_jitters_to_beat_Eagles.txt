Julio Jones had 141 yards receiving and two touchdowns, Matt Ryan shook off a 
pair of interceptions, and the Atlanta Falcons came back to beat the
Philadelphia Eagles <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/philadelphia-eagles> 
26-24 Monday night after squandering a 17-point halftime lead.

Ricardo Allen’s interception off a deflected pass sealed the victory with 1:11 
remaining, giving Dan Quinn an upset victory in his first game as Falcons 
coach. The Eagles missed a chance to go ahead when Cody Parkey missed a 44-yard 
field goal with 2:27 to go.

Coming off the best season of his career and with a lucrative new contract, 
Jones dominated the Eagles’ revamped secondary as the Falcons raced to a 20-3 
halftime lead. It could have been even more if not for Kiko Alonso’s dazzling 
interception in the end zone.

Ryan had another interception on the first possession of the second half, 
turning the momentum in Philadelphia’s favor.
