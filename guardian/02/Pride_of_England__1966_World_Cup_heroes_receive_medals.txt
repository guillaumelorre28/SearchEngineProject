Members of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad were presented with their 
winners' medals at a reception in Downing Street today.

When England lifted the World Cup it was customary that only the 11 players on 
the pitch at the final whistle were awarded medals. Today, the prime minister, 
Gordon Brown, handed them out to the other players and families of the backroom 
staff after Fifa decided to award medals to every winning squad player from 
1930 to 1974.

George Cohen picked up a medal on behalf of the family of the team's manager, 
the late SirAlf Ramsey <https://www.theguardian.com/football/alf-ramsey>. 
Cohen, who was asked to receive the medal on behalf of Lady Ramsey, said of his 
old manager: "He expected people to behave in a proper manner and he would not 
allow anything to detract from what he was trying to do, which was win the 
World Cup."

The former Tottenham and Chelsea striker Jimmy Greaves also welcomed the move. 
"Sir Alf would have been proud because he would also have got a medal. Had he 
lived, we might have got them a bit sooner."

The players and their families later left Downing Street and boarded an 
England team coach to take them to Wembley, where they were presented on the 
pitch before tonight's World Cup qualifier against Andorra.

The full list of players awarded medals is: Peter Bonetti, Ron Springett, 
Jimmy Armfield, Gerry Byrne, Ron Flowers, Norman Hunter, Terry Paine, Ian 
Callaghan, John Connelly, George Eastham and Jimmy Greaves.

David Cocker accepted a medal on behalf of his father, the team physio Les 
Cocker. Margaret Shepherdson received a medal on behalf of her husband, the 
team trainer Harold Shepherdson.
