I'm typing this through a film of plastic kitchen wrap. No, really. After the 
frenzy oflast month's clickalong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/feb/18/curry> I 
found myself misspelling more than usual and it was only after hockling out a 
red lentil from under the G and H keys I was able to return to my usual 
lapidary prose. This time, as Allegra instructs and I attempt to type 
one-handed, my MacBook is going to be securely protected in a culinary condom.

Yes, tonight, at 8:00pm Allegra will once again take us by the metaphorical 
hand and lead us, skipping lightly through a superb recipe which, for this 
month's clickalong, is pan-fried salmon with chilli bulgar and sweet and sour 
veg. Healthy, filling, full of the sparkling flavours of spring and almost 
guaranteed to winkle its way into your USB socket or Ethernet port. So wrap 
your laptop, sharpen your knife and check the ingredient list below.
As usual events will be simulcast into every dark corner of geekdom via our 
Facebook page orTwitter <http://twitter.com/guardianfood> and we hope you'll 
post your own pictures either on to ourFlickr page 
<http://www.flickr.com/groups/wordofmouth/> or your own - just post us a link 
so we can all take a look.
