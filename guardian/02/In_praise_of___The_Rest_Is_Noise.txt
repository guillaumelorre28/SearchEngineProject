The release of the South Bank Centre's programme for The Rest Is Noise is 
cause for celebration: here is a national institution committinga year of events
 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/27/rest-noise-festival-2013> to 
the idea that the culture of the 20th century cannot be neatly divided into 
high- and lowbrow, difficult and popular. The festival takes its name and its 
curatorial principles from a book and blog by a music critic. By happy 
coincidence, Alex Ross'sThe Rest Is Noise <http://www.therestisnoise.com/> won 
the Guardian first book award four years ago this week; his catholic taste was 
evident that night in a guestlist ranging from classical luminaries to
Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood <https://www.theguardian.com/music/radiohead>. Its 
success and influence places Ross in a line of critic proselytisers that 
stretches back to Ken Tynan and George Bernard Shaw. It's in the nature of a 
proselytising festival to be controversial, so let us pause, before the 
dissonance begins, to consider what an achievement this is, in an age when the 
critic is sometimes written off as a cultural irrelevance.
