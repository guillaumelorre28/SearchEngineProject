The Irish government has intervened to stop the stricken Allied Irish Banks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/allied-irish-bank> paying €40m (£34m) of 
bonuses to some 2,400 staff.

The payments were due to be paid on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/08/allied-irish-banks-pay-bonuses-despite-bailout>
 but the finance minister told the bank's bosses last night that it would not 
provide a further bailout if it made the payments to the bankers.

The bank felt it had to pay the bonuses – which date back to 2008 – after 
legal action by a trader, John Foy, over a deferred €161,000 bonus and had 
legal advice to this effect.

But last night, the finance minister, Brian Lenihan, wrote to the bank to say 
that he would override the court by legislating that further state funding to 
AIB "will be conditional on the non-payment of any bonuses awarded, no matter 
when they may have been paid".

David Hodgkinson, executive chairman of AIB, said: "The board of AIB very much 
welcomes the actions of the minister and is relieved to be in a position not to 
pay these bonuses.

"We are determined to position the bank to play a full role in the recovery 
and development of the Irish economy. In doing so, we are committed to treating 
our customers, staff, the taxpayer and the public in a fair and transparent 
manner."
