Dan Quinn has expressed disapproval of an assistant coach who inquired whether 
former Ohio State defensive back Eli Apple was gay at last week’s NFL scouting 
combine.

“I am really disappointed in the question that was asked by one of our 
coaches,” Quinn said in a statement released Friday.

“I have spoken to the coach that interviewed Eli Apple and explained to him 
how inappropriate and unprofessional this was. I have reiterated this to the 
entire coaching staff and I want to apologize to Eli for this even coming up. 
This is not what the Atlanta Falcons are about and it is not how we are going 
to conduct ourselves.”

Apple had described the interview with Atlanta assistant, whom he declined to 
name, in a Friday interview with Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia.

“The Falcons coach, one of the coaches, was like, ‘So do you like men?’” Apple 
said. “It was like the first thing he asked me. It was weird. I was just like, 
‘No.’ He was like, ‘If you’re going to come to Atlanta, sometimes that’s how it 
is around here. You’re going to have to get used to it.’

“I guess he was joking, but they just ask most of these questions to see how 
you’re going to react.”

A representative for the league office said later Friday that the league would 
investigate the incident.

“This is disappointing and clearly inappropriate as the Falcons acknowledged,” 
NFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> spokesman Brian McCarthy said in a 
statement. “We will look into it.”
