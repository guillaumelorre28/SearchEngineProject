Junglepussy – Pregnant with Success

Junglepussy’s free album is a late contender for one of the best hip-hop 
releases of 2015. Distorted vocals are accompanied by lines about making porn 
to watch while eating popcorn. It’s unlike anything that’s come out this year 
and builds on Junglepussy’s reputation as one of Brooklyn’s best rappers.

Generation rent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/18/generation-rent-home-ownership-generation-britain>
 just got a new anthem, as Wiki – one third ofRatking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/12/ratking-rap-culture-of-punk> – 
releases the first track from his solo project Lil Me. In its video, we get a 
drone shot of him in his mum’s apartment and some backstage japes before he 
flies off into the sunset with Nasty Nigel. Not bad for a day’s work.

Tink – Medicine

Chicago rapper Tink <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/07/tink> takes 
a classic breakup narrative and manages to turn it into no-nonsense commentary 
on what happens if you try to creep on the low. In short, you’ll get kicked to 
the kerb while Tink and entourage do an impromptu photoshoot.

Ghostface Killah v Action Bronson video game

A while back, Ghostface Killah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/22/ghostface-killah-action-bronson-beef-video-teddy-pendergrass>
 andAction Bronson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/16/action-bronson-review-hip-hop-roundhouse-london>
 got into a beef over Twitter. It was a daft back and forth that ended with the 
Wu-Tang MC leaving a scathing YouTube video directed at the former chef and 
sometime TV host. The whole thing has now been turned into a 16-bit platform 
game where Bronson tries to avoid Ghostface (who is a floating head), and 
ghosts while gobbling down Twitter logos to gain points. It’s soundtracked by a 
lo-fi cover of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs Heads Will Roll, which is ace.

A$AP Rocky – Yamborghini High

While at the brilliantly named Clockenflap festival in Hong Kong, A$AP Rocky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/asap-rocky> debuted the unreleased 
Yamborghini High, which continues his off-kilter approach with a track 
dedicated toA$AP Yams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/18/asap-yams-dies-aged-26>. The 
track itself is nice enough, but the fact that he’s performing in astage mockup 
of an American diner, replete <https://www.instagram.com/p/-opm5lpZwm/> with 
waiters and customers, and acts an unsuspecting entourage member makes it all 
the better.
