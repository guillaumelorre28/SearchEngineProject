The NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> ombudsman has severely 
criticised a hospital for disastrous mistakes that led to the death of a young 
woman after A&E staff mistook her diabetic complications for nothing worse than 
a hangover.

The doctor said 'I think she's just got a hangover and needs to sleep it off'. 
I feel badly let down

Phillippa Odlin died hours after doctors at London’s North Middlesex hospital 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/19/north-middlesex-ae-staff-describe-unit-as-unsafe-and-unsupported>
 failed to spot that she had a life-threatening condition called diabetic 
ketoacidosis (DKA), which caused her body to produce poisonous chemicals.

The 26-year-old media studies graduate received severely inadequate care due 
to “unacceptable” failings, which included her being discharged when she needed 
urgent treatment, according to a scathing report by the ombudsman. Odlin was 
found dead in her kitchen by her flatmate the following morning.

Dame Julie Mellor concluded that Odlin’s death in February 2014 was 
“avoidable” because she would have lived if her illness had been diagnosed. 
However, the hospital’s failure to undertake a blood test meant it was missed, 
which led to Odlin going home when she needed life-saving treatment.

“The A&E doctor said to me ‘I think that she’s just got a hangover and needs 
to go home and sleep it off’,” said Jerry Odlin, the dead woman’s father, who 
was with her at the hospital. He accepted that explanation because of his trust 
in doctors but now wishes he had asked more questions.

“Phillippa woke up that morning – a Sunday – with chest pains and wisely 
called an ambulance, which took her to A&E. When I got to the hospital I found 
her lying on a bed in a cubicle moaning and groaning,” he added. Although she 
had been drinking heavily the night before, her symptoms suggested a 
potentially serious illness.

Her father is furious that, despite him telling A&E staff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/14/north-middlesex-hospital-ae-faces-closure-on-safety-grounds>
 that Phillippa was a diabetic, they did not take either blood or urine samples 
to establish what was wrong. The errors were so serious that Mellor has taken 
the unusual step of declaring that she suffered as a result of “service 
failure” by the hospital.

Phillippa Odlin’s case will feature prominently in a detailed dossier that 
Mellor will release on Monday. It will outline 100 cases in which she has found 
serious blunders by hospital and GP surgery staff which, despite harming 
patients, were not investigated properlywhen people complained 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/08/nhs-watchdog-julie-mellor-slams-hospitals-handling-complaints>
. They include avoidable deaths, such as Odlin’s, poor out-of-hours GP care, 
delayed diagnosis of cancer, inadequate hospital discharges and patients being 
given incorrect doses of their medication.

The 100 cases will be anonymous. But Jerry and Jody Odlin, Phillippa’s 
parents, agreed to reveal the details of the NHS’s handling of their daughter’s 
illness to the Observer as a warning to A&E staff across Britain that they need 
to be more aware of the symptoms and risks of DKA.

The ombudsman’s investigation found that: “Although we recognise that the 
unfortunate turn of events within 24 hours and fatal outcome were most unusual, 
we have concluded that the care and treatment provided for Miss Odlin fell so 
far below the applicable standards that it amounted to service failure.

“Miss Odlin’s death would have been avoided if she had been appropriately 
assessed in A&E. If [she] had had the appropriate tests then doctors would have 
admitted her to hospital so she could have received life-saving treatment,” 
Mellor concludes, adding that it was “unacceptable” for staff not to have tried 
harder to obtain blood from Odlin when a nurse’s initial attempt failed due to 
her unusually small veins.

 NHS ombudsman Dame Julie Mellor will release a dossier of 100 cases where

DKA occurs when a diabetic’s lack of insulin means their body cannot use 
glucose to produce energy, which prompts the body to create energy by breaking 
down other bodily tissue. That process creates ketones, poisonous chemicals 
which, unless the condition is tackled with fluids, insulin and glucose, lead 
to the body becoming acidic.

“I think knowing that Phillippa liked a drink, which for her height, weight 
and condition was sometimes excessive, I accepted the doctor’s explanation as 
being true and didn’t unduly worry,” said her father. “But I did so on the 
assumption that all the relevant tests for a diabetic had been performed. Now I 
feel badly let down.”

A hospital spokesman reiterated an apology and said: “We are determined to 
improve our standards and ensure that all our staff are aware of the risks 
associated with a patient who has an underlying condition of diabetes and who 
has consumed a considerable quantity of alcohol. We hope by doing so we will be 
able to help prevent similar tragedies.”
