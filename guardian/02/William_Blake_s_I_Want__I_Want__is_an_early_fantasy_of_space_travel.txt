The man with the child in his eyes

Visionary poet and artist William Blake’s little engraving, smaller than a 
playing card, is an early fantasy of lunar travel. The tiny figure who 
announces their desire to get to the moon with a child’s cry, “I want! I 
want!”, has a similarly child-like solution when it comes to transport: a 
really big ladder.

Simple mind

TS Eliot commended the “extraordinary labour of simplification” Blake used to 
“exhibit the essential sickness or strength of the human soul”. This work, one 
of 18 engravings in For Children: The Gates Of Paradise, is strikingly simple, 
with its pared-down figures and crescent moon.

Brave new world

Its message, though, is ambivalent. Is this would-be astronaut a metaphor for 
the poet’s solitary road? He has the imagination to strike out alone from the 
Earth, leaving the frightened, clinging couple behind. Is his innocence – the 
highest value for Blake – the key to a new world?

Ask for the moon

Or is this a satire, where ambition will be undone by possibility? Its 
historical context suggests so. Like his Romantic peers, Blake had supported 
the French Revolution. In the 1790s, however, the utopian dream had been 
reduced to a violent hell.
