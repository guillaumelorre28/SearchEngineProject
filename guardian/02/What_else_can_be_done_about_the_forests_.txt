Deforestation is thought to account for 18% of global greenhouse gas 
emissions. With present estimates on deforestation in Tanzania at 130,000 to 
500,000 hectares a year, urgent action is required.

"We need a campaign," says Ernest Moshi, PFM co-ordinator for Farm-Africa, "to 
mobilise people to plant more trees outside the forest." They also need to make 
a more informed choice as to which trees to plant. Philemon Herson runs a tree 
nursery, selling seedlings at 100 TZS (50p) apiece. The bestsellers are those 
which are grown for timber, taking 15 to 25 years to reach full height. There 
is no interest in faster growing species (such as acacia), which could quickly 
provide domestic firewood and construction poles, taking pressure off the 
forest. "Forest officers provide education to the community on tree planting," 
Herson says. "I also try to educate, but not all listen."

Another solution is to replace the traditional three-stone open fire with 
fuel-saving built-in stoves. Made of clay, water, sand and sawdust, these are 
cheap and easy to build. Increasing numbers are appearing in villages but it is 
taking time for people to adapt to a new cooking method.

A third possibility is to provide an incentive for not cutting down trees. In 
the Juma sustainable development reserve, Brazil, local families will earn $28 
every month for leaving the trees standing. Such schemes (known as "avoided 
deforestation") are high on the agenda at the Copenhagen Climate Change 
conference in December. Considering the potential cost of global warming, 
they're not expensive.
