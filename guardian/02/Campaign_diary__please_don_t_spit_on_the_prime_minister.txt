Quotes of the day

Tony Abbott, trying to make the point that Labor was a Rudd-man band, whereas 
the Coalition was a united team: "No one, however smart, however well-educated, 
however well experienced, is the suppository of all wisdom."

Kevin Rudd was asked why he didn't flick that fringe in the debate – a habit 
which has been most evident up until now: "We've taken out now some Araldite 
and I find that much more effective."

Tweet of the day

This prize followed Abbott's quote. Remember the retiring independent Tony 
Windsor alleged that in his 2010 discussions with Abbott about forming a 
minority government, the opposition leader suggested, "The only thing I 
wouldn't do is sell my arse but I'd have to give serious thought to it."

@TonyWindsorMP tweeted: "Re: @TonyAbbottMHR's suppository gaffe – I warned him 
about that."
