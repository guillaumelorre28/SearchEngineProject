Bonds: ‘Think of Fathers’ (starts at 00:04) - Australia

It’s healthy for blokes to lay bare their thoughts on occasion, and, with 
Australia’s Father’s Day on the horizon, underwear brand Bonds give this group 
of dads an opportunity to get their talk on while stripped down to their 
briefs. With tongue-in-cheek candour, this circle of trust discusses the 
effects of childbirth on the body – namely, the male body.

McDonald’s: ‘Acting Masterclass’ (starts at 01:35) - France

This year’s crop of summer blockbusters may have failed to set the world 
alight, but this well-performed McDonald’s ad hints at a seat-filler with extra 
bite. One can’t help but wonder how the lead in this watery epic manages to 
summon such raw emotion in each and every take... but the reason has more to do 
with matters of the stomach than the heart.

Subaru: ‘The Boy Who Breaks Everything’ (starts at 03:16) - US

Subaru choose a lovely way to communicate its Legacy model’s enduring 
properties by introducing us to a child whose mere touch turns lifetime 
guarantees to dust. Everything the poor boy touches at home, at school, and on 
the street somehow malfunctions in quietly spectacular fashion. Great if you’re 
a kid after some free candy, but not so great if you can’t open a door, turn on 
a light, or play on a bouncy castle without causing a fuss.

Nike: ‘Sister Madonna Buder’ (starts at 04:21) - US

Nike once again flummox Oscar Isaac in the voiceover booth – this time by 
introducing Sister Madonna Buder aka the ‘Iron Nun’. No, don’t worry, she isn’t 
the latest addition to cinema’s ever-increasing roster of superheroes – 
86-year-old Buder is a triathlete with a spry attitude to the whole mind, body, 
and soul business. Another engaging distillation of the sporting brand’s 
universal message of boundless endeavour.
