When did you last see a film set in Vancouver? You might struggle: the 
Canadian port city may be a lovely place to live, but it’s not exactly an 
exemplar of romance and adventure. When you last saw a film shot in Vancouver, 
however, is another question: so effectively (and economically) does it pose as 
a multitude of US cities in major productions that it’s come to be known as 
Hollywood North. Right now, it’s damply filling in for Seattle inFifty Shades 
of Grey, and working overtime in the much-ballyhooed satire The Interview, 
multitasking as New York, rural China and Pyongyang. (It has not been released 
in Canadian cinemas.)

Kathryn Bigelow deemed it insufficiently authentic for The Hurt Locker 
(heading off to Jordan instead), but Morocco is currently the first choice of 
American film-makers seeking a safe stand-in for the Middle East — a common 
demand these days, with Iraq war films still in heavy supply. Clint Eastwood, 
efficient as ever, turned Rabat into a reasonable substitute for the 
shrapnel-strewn streets of Fallujah inAmerican Sniper, following the likes of 
Body of Lies and Green Zone. Morocco has also successfully masqueraded as 
Somalia (Black Hawk Down), Tibet (Kundun), ancient Rome (Gladiator) and even 
Games of Thrones’s imaginary Westeros.

By shooting his then-risky Lord of the Rings trilogy in the imposing mountains 
of his home country, Peter Jackson knew he was giving the local film industry a 
leg-up. But he couldn’t have counted on giving the Kiwi tourism racket a whole 
new lease of life: with the country now forever branded as the real-life 
Middle-earth by global legions of Tolkienites, the number of themed tours of 
Queenstown, Matamata and the Southern Alps keeps growing. Neither is it just 
Hobbit country in the minds of cinemagoers: with the recent run of Narnia films 
having also rooted themselves here, New Zealand has become a one-stop geek 
mecca.

Admittedly, this South African writer’s eyes are more keenly peeled than most 
for the country’s many Hollywood cameo appearances, but it’s hardly a secret 
that its sunny shores and highly trained local craftspeople (thanks to a 
proliferation of local film academies) make for an attractive alternative to 
locations ranging from the Côte d’Azur to the Sahara. David Lean resorted to 
Cape Town when the drenched coastline of the west of Ireland served up too many 
logistical obstacles to completingRyan’s Daughter, while Robert Towne (filming 
his largely forgotten Colin Farrell noirAsk the Dust) declared that “nothing 
could look more like southern California” than the country’s tourist capital.

 Scene from There Will Be Blood. 
We could have filled this list with the stately English homes that have 
dutifully served as the backdrop to countless corset dramas, but for sheer 
versatility they’re arguably outdone by a gauche Beverly Hills pretender. 
Thanks largely to its immediately recognisable chequerboard floor and grandiose 
descending staircase, this 1928 Tudor revival sprawl has become a go-to symbol 
of American aristocracy, serving as the home of Jeffrey Lebowski Sr inThe Big 
Lebowski, the older Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood (including that 
bowling alley) and even — briefly — Kermit the Frog inThe Muppets.

 A scene from Amadeus, 1984. 
Though hardly an obscure spot, much less an indistinct one, the Czech capital 
has been sportingly posing as other cities for decades, even before the fall of 
communism ushered in a further wave of Hollywood opportunism. It certainly made 
for a lavish Vienna in Czech native Milos Forman’s 1984 Oscar-guzzlerAmadeus, 
whileCasino Royale called upon it to serve as Venice, London and even Miami. 
And theMission: Impossible franchise has made repeat visits to Prague, 
occasionally allowing the city to play itself – though the last instalment took 
the liberty of dressing up Prague castle as the Kremlin.

Needless to say, the Big Smoke gets an awful lot of screen time, usually as 
itself, though film-makers are endlessly repurposing its most iconic buildings. 
Greenwich’s Old Royal Naval College pops up in everything fromThe King’s Speech 
toThe Dark Knight Rises, where it’s rather optimistically relocated to 
Florence. It’s inSkyfall too, though that’s hardly the greatest liberty the 
James Bond <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond> smash took with the 
capital’s architecture: the digitally altered backdrop may have had 
non-Londoners fooled, but no one even passingly acquainted with the Square Mile 
could have failed to recognise the distinctive glassy diagonals of Broadgate 
Tower posing as a Shanghai skyscraper.

Sometimes the American west does a perfectly fine job of representing itself. 
Case in point: the vast, eerie sandstone buttes of Monument Valley on the 
Arizona-Utah state line, an iconic location first put on the Hollywood map by 
John Ford’sStagecoach in 1939. Ford, after whom one of the region’s key lookout 
points is now named, would return there for nine more westerns, includingThe 
Searchers, while Easy Rider, Thelma & Louise and Forrest Gump are among the 
films to have followed his lead. No film-maker made more of the valley’s 
otherworldly potential than Stanley Kubrick; in2001: A Space Odyssey, that’s 
the alien planet waiting at the end of the stargate sequence.

 Yes, a second mention for the City of Angels, but it figures that Hollywood 
studios would exploit their own back yard. And few of its resources have been 
more exhaustively explored than this 4,310-acre municipal park in Santa Monica: 
with its caves, cedar groves, winding back roads, carousel and landmark 
conservatory, it’s an all-purpose godsend for travel-shy location scouts. DW 
Griffith used it for the battle scenes inThe Birth of a Nation a century ago, 
John Ford (again) borrowed the caves for the climax ofThe Searchers, and the 
imposingly domed conservatory will forever be associated with Nicholas Ray’s
Rebel Without a Cause.

 Clint Eastwood in The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. 
The spaghetti westerns with which Italian director Sergio Leone made his name 
may have earned their pasta credentials at Rome’s Cinecittà Studios, but the 
parched, sprawling, baked-clay landscape we associate with them came courtesy 
of Spain’s Andalucían flatlands: Almería, in particular, served repeatedly as 
one of the harshest incarnations of the wild west in film history. Hollywood, 
meanwhile, had already discovered the region as a location for turgid toga 
extravaganzas:El Cid, King of Kings and the infamously extravagant Cleopatra 
all passed through, while Ridley Scott recently revived that tradition with his 
biblical epicExodus: Gods and Kings.
