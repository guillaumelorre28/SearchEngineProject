Essex <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/essex> police authority has awarded a 
£32m deal for crime management systems to Northgate Information Solutions.

The framework agreement contract will see Northgate supply, install and 
maintain an investigation management, intelligence and defendant management IT 
system for Essex and a number of other police authorities, according to a 
notice in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU).

The 10-year agreement will be open to all police authorities and other law 
enforcement agencies within the UK, although eight police authorities are 
expected to be among the early adopters: Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, 
Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, City of London police and Kent police.

The £32m value of the framework agreement is based upon seven authorities 
taking up the framework, but should more bodies become involved, it could 
increase to up to £400m.

The eight would-be early adopters are now engaged in a collaborative project 
to procure systems covering crime management, intelligence and defendant 
management, including custody and case preparation.

According to the notice, the deal will "set the scene" for the six eastern 
region police authorities' IT strategy over the coming years, and will involve 
the region working closely with the National Policing Improvement Agency on its 
information systems improvement strategy programme.
