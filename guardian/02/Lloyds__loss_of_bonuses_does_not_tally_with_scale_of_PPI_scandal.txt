How bad would Lloyds Banking <https://www.theguardian.com/business/banking> 
Group’s failings in handling PPI claims have to be for the executives to lose 
all their relevant bonuses?

The question is worth asking because the bank had withheld deferred bonus 
awards from 2012 and 2013 until this latest regulatory investigation was 
complete. The thinking, we assumed, was that all those awards were at risk if 
the Financial Conduct Authority’s verdict turned out to be damning.

Friday’s document

 would seem to fit the bill as a humdinger. Lloyds’ behaviour is described as 
unacceptable. Some 326,000 customers were initially denied compensation they 
should have received. The £117m fine is the largest, by far, the FCA has 
imposed for this offence. The bank was a repeat offender.

Yet you would hardly say Lloyds’ degree of bonus-docking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/05/record-ppi-fine-for-lloyds-knocks-12-off-horta-osorio-bonus>
 is similarly fierce. The chief executive, António Horta-Osório, recipient of a 
£11.5m pay package last year, will lose £350,000 from the £2.9m earmarked for 
him from the 2012/2013 collection. That’s a 12% deduction. Other executives 
will lose between 8% and 32% depending on how close they were to the PPI action.

As for the £30m reduction from this year’s wider bonus pool, context is 
everything. Last year’s pool was worth £365m and this year’s is very likely to 
be larger.

It’s accountability of a sort, and Lloyds might argue that the FCA reckoned 
these were “level three” offences on a scale that extends to five. But that’s 
hardly a strong plea of mitigation – level five seems to require full-on 
forgery of documentation. Lloyds executives should count themselves lucky. The 
principle of accountability has been acknowledged, but its application won’t 
hurt much.
