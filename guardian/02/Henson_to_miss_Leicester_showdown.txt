The Wales back Gavin Henson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gavin-henson> 
will miss the Ospreys' EDF Cup final clash against Leicester at Twickenham 
tomorrow after failing to recover from ankle ligament damage.

Henson misses out after suffering the injury during his club's Heineken Cup 
quarter-final defeat to Saracens last weekend and will be replaced by Andrew 
Bishop in midfield, although Henson expects be back in time for next Saturday's 
league match with Munster.

"It is disappointing news that we have to go into the game without Gavin 
Henson," said theOspreys <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ospreys> head coach 
Lyn Jones. "He is still suffering from the ankle injury he picked up at 
Saracens, and although he just failed to make it for this weekend, we are 
confident he will be fit for selection next week.

"As is always the case, his absence provides someone else with an opportunity. 
In Andrew Bishop, we have a talented youngster who has a considerable amount of 
experience for a 22-year-old. As part of the matchday squad who lost out to 
Leicester last season, he is looking forward to the opportunity to put the 
record straight."

Jones has also decided to change half the pack after Ospreys' surprise 
European exit. The Wales internationals Duncan Jones, Huw Bennett, Ian Gough 
and Jonathan Thomas all drop to the bench, with Paul James, Richard Hibbard, 
Ian Evans and Filo Tiatia their respective replacements. Filo Tiatia's call-up 
means skipper Ryan Jones moves from No8 to blindside flanker.
