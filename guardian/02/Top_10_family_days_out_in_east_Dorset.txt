National Trust, is a favourite destination for walkers, picnickers, geologists, 
and rock climbers – but not many dancers. There are daily steam trains between 
Wareham and Swanage (swanagerailway.co.uk <http://swanagerailway.co.uk/>) and 
an open-top bus runs from Wareham through to Poole via Sandbanks and then 
crosses the ferry to Swanage (a day rider costs about £6). Wareham Quay has a 
weekly market on Saturdays offering fresh fish and local products, and there 
are regular boat trips offering a sedate trip up the Frome River .

Brownsea Island

This peaceful island in Poole harbour is famous as the birthplace of the 
scouting movement and the inspiration for one of Enid Blyton's Famous Five 
stories. Children will love the adventure of getting there by boat and then 
spotting wildlife including rare red squirrels and a wide variety of birds. 
Grab a tracker pack from the visitor centre or take part in a self-led 
orienteering trail, go beachcombing or just have a game of good old-fashioned 
hide-and-seek. Electric buggy tours are available for the less mobile and there 
are all-terrain pushchairs for hire. You can also go sailing, canoeing or try 
your hand at archery. Take your own picnic or eat at the Villano Café, where 
you can also pick up children's lunch packs.

Corfe Castle

The view towards this romantic ruin is one of Dorset's most iconic sights, 
rising as it does from the valley floor and surrounded by the Purbeck hills. 
It's a 1,000-year-old royal castle shaped by warfare, with tales of treachery 
and treason around every corner. Have fun spotting the "murder-holes" and 
counting the arrow loops, try on medieval costumes and pose with helmets, 
shields and swords. The castle is a short walk from the pretty village, where 
there are plenty of tea shops for sandwiches, cake and souvenirs.

demonstrations, woodland walks, bouncy castles, indoor and outdoor play areas, 
pedal-powered go-karts, a maize maze and a wet "splashzone" – remember to take

Lulworth Cove and Kimmeridge

See nature as sculptor at the eastern gateway of the Jurassic Coast, famous 
for its dramatic cove and the amazing Durdle Door (pictured), a natural arch 
jutting out to sea, just along the cliff path from Lulworth or a short boat 
trip in the summer. It can get pretty crowded, so arrive early and then head on 
to neighbouring Kimmeridge, one of the best places in the country to go rock 
pooling. The oil sands beneath the sea bed form the largest British oilfield 
outside the North Sea. Children will be fascinated by the "nodding donkey", the 
oldest working oil pump in Britain, and displays at the Dorset Wildlife Trust 
marine centre at Kimmeridge.

Bournemouth

It's bucket-and-spade paradise at Bournemouth, which has an incredible seven 
miles of beaches. Nestling beneath the cliffs, the bay enjoys its own 
micro-climate and some of the warmest sea temperatures in the UK. Each section 
of the beach has something different to offer, from watersports to family 
attractions. There are three cliff lifts to take you down to the beach and a 
land train runs along the promenade and gardens.

Tyneham
 Photograph: Alamy 
It's an eerie experience, walking around this ghost village, accessible only 
at weekends when the military firing range is not in use. The village and 7,500 
acres of surrounding heathland and chalk downland were commandeered just before 
Christmas 1943 by the War Office and the 252 inhabitants were never allowed 
back. A visit here leaves a lasting impression, especially on children, when 
they see the old village school. Though littered with scrap used as targets, 
and subject to regular shelling, the land has become a haven for wildlife. Many 
of the buildings have fallen into disrepair or have been damaged by shelling. 
However, the church and school house are preserved as museums.
