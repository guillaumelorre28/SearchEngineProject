 Kevin Pearce in The Crash Reel. Photograph: Dean Blotto Gray 
My brother recommended this: it’s about a pro snowboarder called Kevin Pearce 
and this devastating accident he suffers. The film focuses on the fallout, how 
it affects him and his family and – not to sound too saccharine – the lessons 
learned and his triumph after everything. I’m a huge fan of who he becomes 
after this life-changing event. It’s an extraordinary piece of 
documentary-making: there’s a goodie and baddie, but it happens quite 
naturally. It has an incredible soundtrack to boot. I’ve only skied twice 
before and I’m not a fan of snowboarding so it was a left-field choice, but 
then I also loved The King of Kong and I’m not a gamer either. Brilliant 
documentaries are about so much more than their subject.

 Hannah Kohler: ‘The vocabulary, imagination and depth of understanding is 
quite extraordinary.’ 
This is written by my friend Mike Wozniak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/15/mike-wozniak-edinburgh-festival-standup-comedy-free-sisters-man-down>
’s twin sister. She has managed to create a novel that is deeply detailed and 
transportive to 1960s America, and then Vietnam. The vocabulary, imagination 
and depth of understanding is quite extraordinary. It’s beautiful to read – I 
just got completely lost in it. Again, it starts with a tragedy which happens 
to two children, Jeannie and Kip. It’s about people finding comfort where they 
can and how disillusioned they can become, focusing on the loss the children 
experience and the way it shapes them. Mike gave me the book and it’s very nice 
to give genuine feedback that I loved it.

 Black Mirror: ‘frighteningly accurate’. Photograph: Netflix 
This is something I’m very much into at the minute. I thought the first episode
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/25/reflections-on-black-mirror-by-those-for-whom-science-fiction-became-reality>
 of the new series was the most affecting: it’s about a woman who is so 
desperate to be liked on social media that she loses sight of the bigger 
picture. It externalised all our internal needs and made it profoundly clear 
that we’re doing this to ourselves now. It made me think I must reform my own 
phone addiction – I often find myself watching TV and poking around on 
Instagram for likes, and it’s disconcerting. Depressing as the show is, it is 
frighteningly accurate as to where we’re probably heading – it’s always just 
reachable by the imagination, and that’s what’s so scary. We can just about 
imagine it’s possible.

I saw Christine and the Queens <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2VKaH2sKtU> 
at Brixton Academy, but I first noticed her on Graham Norton as I’m sure many 
did. Often singing acts at the end of chatshows get quite lost, but she made 
such an impact that night and it seemed to launch her into UK public knowledge. 
I love how she is unapologetically herself – she has a strong and independent 
image. She’s a great role model for young people, rather than the pop stars who 
are more manufactured. She’s really strong, culturally interesting and can 
dance as well. I find her very striking in a pop world that is quite ordinary 
now. Her extraordinariness seems to come authentically from who she is.

 PalomaWool: ‘passion and fire’. 
I’ve been following a Barcelona-based artist and designer called Paloma Wool 
on Instagram, and she also has a website. It’s a clothes line but it also shows 
the art of making clothes, wearing clothes and getting dressed. It’s about 
being in the belly of a woman. There are bold prints, pale nudes, silks and 
cottons, but it’s tasteful and stylish.Sometimes they wear shirts in their 
pants and throw paint at the wall. It sounds like student experimental art but 
it shows passion and fire. I just ordered my first dress because I was so 
emboldened by what Wool was doing. Hopefully it will arrive soon and I’ll look 
as sexy and cool as she does.

 R and D: ‘A world run by automatons doesn’t seem completely unrealistic any 
more.’ Photograph: Robert Day 
This was fantastically acted and directed. It’s written by Simon Vinnicombe 
and has a lovely director called Nadia Fall. It’s not dissimilar fromHumans, in 
that a character suffers a loss at the beginning and a robot is introduced 
whose hyper-real nature is confusing and intriguing to him. I’m more frightened 
than interested by artificial intelligence – in fact, perhaps fright and 
interest are not far away from one another. Things can become real in your 
mind, you can be tricked, and you believe things you wouldn’t ordinarily. A 
world run by automatons doesn’t seem completely unrealistic any more. It’s a 
bit chilling.

 Headspace: ‘It helps you to remember what you’ve lost sight of after 
scrambling around in the mornings.’ 
A friend recommended this because I’m working quite hard at the moment. The 
creator Andy Puddicombe went on a long adventure in the Himalayas and became 
very spiritual through meditation and mindfulness. The app is designed around 
taking 10 minutes out of your day to reflect on the sounds you hear and your 
breathing. We’re losing touch with ourselves in the technological world and it 
is increasingly important to take time out. I’ve enjoyed listening to it while 
in the car – he has a lovely calming voice. It helps you to remember what 
you’ve lost sight of after scrambling around in the mornings putting socks on 
the wrong way. And I found the effect stays with you throughout the day.
