In this, their third feature, Joel and Ethan Coen started to grow up, 
jettisoning – or at least honing – many of the over-the-top stylistic tics and 
tropes they had deployed in Blood Simple and Raising Arizona. Here they deal 
with deeper emotions – grief, guilt and despair – but without losing their 
essential, wacky Coen-ness.

Approaching the Depression-era gangster movie with their customary nerve, they 
construct (confect is a better word) a note-perfect, midwestern, "wide open 
town" and fill it with action and characters redolent of wicked-city novels 
such as Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest and James M Cain's Love's Lovely 
Counterfeit (in which people actually do say, "What's the rumpus?"). The town 
is populated with faces (mainly gargoyles and grotesques) reminiscent of Warner 
Brothers character players, or the Ten Most Wanted List. Larded with more 
cartoon "Oirishry" than The Quiet Man, and more gunplay than The Godfather and 
Goodfellas combined, it unfolds in a thoroughly rotten and broken municipality 
over whose still twitching corpse two gangs war mercilessly. Gabriel Byrne's 
independent gangster-gunsel simply sets the factions against one another 
and watches everybody die. Marvellous!
