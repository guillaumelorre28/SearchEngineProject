An Inconvenient Truth, the documentary featuring Al Gore's attempts to alert 
people to the dangers of climate change, triggered a global conversation when 
it was released in 2006, and earned $50m at the box office. Now the film's 
producers are talking up a potential sequel.

"We have had conversations," Lawrence Bender told the Hollywood Reporter

. "We've met; we've discussed. If we are going to make a movie, we want it to 
have an impact." Fellow producer Scott Z. Burns added that he "would only 
support doing a follow-up if we have a really, really amazing way of attacking 
the issue and reinvigorating it."

Bender, who has also frequently produced Quentin Tarantino's movies, argues 
that a sequel is necessary because the headway made by the first film has been 
eaten into by lobbying from the fossil fuel industry. "They did a really good 
job of pushing back and confusing people," he says. "Some people actually 
believe global warming doesn't exist."

An Inconvenient Truth was made after fellow producer Laurie David saw former 
presidential candidateAl Gore <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/algore> 
deliver a slideshow presentation about the impact of fossil fuel consumption on 
global warming; the film is based around that slideshow, with Gore expanding on 
his thesis as well as showing what inspired his environmentalism. It won an 
Academy Award for best documentary, as well as one for best original song.

David also called for a sequel to be made. "God, do we need one," she said. 
"Everything in that movie has come to pass. At the time we did the movie, there 
was Hurricane Katrina; now we have extreme weather events every other week. The 
update has to be incredible and shocking."
