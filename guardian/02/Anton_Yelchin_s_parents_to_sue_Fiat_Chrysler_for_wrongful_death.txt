 for problems with the gear shifter.

According to Variety

, there had been over 700 complaints about the issue, including 266 accidents.

As well as suing the car company, Viktor and Irina Yelchin are filing suits 
against AutoNation and ZF North America, who manufactured the gear shifter. The 
couple are also filing for control of the late actor’s estate as he did not 
leave a will. According toPeople

condolences and kind words and to all who came to celebrate the life of our 
dear son, Anton. We are deeply grateful for your unconditional love for our 
son. He would be surprised by how many hearts and souls he touched.”
