spectacular”, and added he would like to return next year to carry on winning 
prizes.

Pérez was given dispensation by Newcastle to attend the ceremony and walked

, got 16 in 34 appearances for Tenerife last season.

The 21-year-old, who will be back in time for the Capital One Cup match at 
Manchester City on Wednesday, told NUFC TV: “I’m really, really proud to be 
part of the names, because the awards are for players in the Primera and 
Segunda so it’s a very important awards ceremony.”

The Best Coach award was claimed by Atlético Madrid’s Diego Simeone and the 
League Champion award went to last season’s La Liga winners.

The former Tottenham player Luka Modric picked up the prize for best 
midfielder for his performances for Real Madrid while the Best Attacking
