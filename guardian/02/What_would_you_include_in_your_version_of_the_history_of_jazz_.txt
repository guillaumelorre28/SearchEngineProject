Drug busts, razor-sharp tailoring and breathtaking musicianship: yes, it's the 
turn of jazz, completing our seven-parthistory of modern music 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/series/a-history-of-modern-music>. It's a 
journey that stretches back to the early 1900s, and takes us from New Orleans 
to Cuba to Manhattan to Cologne. The greats are included, of course, from Louis 
Armstrong to Miles Davis, from the Duke to Dizzy, Monk and Billie, and racism, 
sexism and the entrenched elitism of the musical world all get tackled on the 
way. And there's a place for Sgt Pepper, as well as an appearance from Justin 
Bieber...

"Jazz is a way of playing," said the great jazz pianist and educator Billy 
Taylor <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brBtTluod_w>. Duke Ellington called it 
the music of surprise – and our history takes in classical music, spirituals, 
the blues, R&B, electronica, punk and world music. We argued when jazz started 
and we argued over who should feature in our story of its continuation – the 
contributors, in this instance, comprising the Guardian's jazz criticJohn 
Fordham 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/19/jazz-journalist-year-john-fordham> 
and the writersRichard Williams 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Moment-Daviss-Remaking-Modern/dp/0571245072/ref=pd_sim_b_1>
,John Lewis <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/john-lewis> and John L Walters 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnlwalters?INTCMP=SRCH>. Note the one 
thing that we all agreed on: that jazz isn't at an end...

So tell us what you think we've missed in the thread below, and thanks for
