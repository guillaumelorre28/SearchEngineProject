i <https://www.theguardian.com/media/i>, the Independent’s little sister that 
eventually morphed - in sales terms - into being its big sister, has reached 
its fifth birthday.

Monday’s issue included pieces by its editor, Oliver Duff, and its owner, 
Evgeny Lebedev (What looks like genius now seemed for a while like madness 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/i-turns-five-what-looks-like-genius-now-seemed-for-a-while-like-madness-a6708581.html>
), in six celebratory pages.

Lebedev revealed that “an experienced and successful newspaper proprietor” 
called his chairman on the paper’s debut to say: “You must be f***ing joking... 
What do you think you’re doing?”

Engagingly, Lebedev admits to having had doubts himself about his “rather 
counter-intuitive” launch and afterwards “had a few dark nights of the soul.”

“Yet,” he wrote, “at the core was an idea, a product, which fundamentally made 
sense then and – given you’re reading these words five years on – makes sense 
now.”

Yes, with circulation of 277,000 at the last count, compared to the 
Independent’s 58,000, it has proved to be a hit with the newspaper-reading 
public.

Its price has risen from 20p at launch to 40p, but it has suffered only a 
relatively mild fall-off in sales in recent times.

I’ll admit that I never expected it to do so well, although I did believe it 
would draw people away from the “mothership” (the Indy), which has surely 
happened.

I note that it quotes me as writing in October 2010 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/i-turns-five-what-the-readers-said-about-britains-youngest-newspaper-a6708596.html>
 that i would prove to be the precursor to the Independent becoming a free 
daily, which has not happened of course.

And I was quick to argue later that month that i was not attracting readers. 
Wrong again and, truthfully, I am happy to have been wrong. So I am pleased to 
wish the paper, its editor and proprietor a happy birthday
