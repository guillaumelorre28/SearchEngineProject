Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh has joined up with actor Robert Carlyle, 
directorAntonia Bird <https://www.theguardian.com/film/antonia-bird> and 
journalist Mark Cousins as a partner in production company Four Way Pictures.

Screendaily reports that Welsh is writing a new screenplay, The Meat Trade, 
for the company, which is now two years old. The new story, set in Edinburgh, 
is being billed as a "big British black comedy horror movie."

"Irvine is genuinely interested in encouraging new writers," said Bird. "He is 
a magnet for a whole generation."

Four Way also has a number of other projects on the go, including Bird's next 
directing project, Faith, which is set against the 1980s miners' strike, and 
two book adaptations. The company, which is apparently aiming to attract 
further partners, has also made a deal with director John Sayles (Lone Star, 
Passion Fish). He is to write and direct A Scottish Western, about highlanders 
who escape English persecution by fleeing to the USA. Unsurprisingly perhaps, 
Robert Carlyle is set to appear in the film.
