Baking and craft workshops at Little Salkeld

The first thing children will notice about The Watermill at Little Salkeld are 
the candy-pink walls. The second might be the chickens foraging for spilt grain 
by the entrance to this restored working mill. Adults will be drawn by the 
smell of baking bread into the child-friendly cafe, which serves wholesome 
lunches made from the Watermill's own stoneground flours (also for sale in the 
shop).

See the mighty water wheel in action on a self-guided tour, or book in advance 
for one of the children's baking and craft workshops that take place throughout 
the year.Long Meg and Her Daughters

Discover Carlisle's horrible history
 Carlisle Castle. Photograph: Nigel Hillier 
Carlisle was once the most north-westerly town in the Roman Empire, and the 
story of the city's occupation is brought playfully to life in the new Roman 
Frontier Gallery at Tullie House Museum. Children can dress up as Roman 
soldiers and Celtic maids, take part in computer quizzes and have their faces 
printed on personalised Roman identity cards – will yours be soldier, farmer or 
slave?

Upstairs, the museum tells the story of the Border Reivers 
<http://www.borderreivers.co.uk/>, who terrorised this region for 300 years – 
they gave us the word "bereaved". And there are more gruesome tales to be heard 
over the road at Carlisle Castle, where the licking stones in the dungeon are 
said to have been eroded by the tongues of parched prisoners who had to lick 
condensation off the walls to stay alive.

Play all day at Walby Farm Park

Your heart will be in your mouth as your offspring hurl themselves down the 
vertical drop slides at this superior children's play farm, especially when 
they dare you to join them. If you can drag them away from the high-thrills 
indoor play zone, young children will spend hours on the go-cart tracks, 
trampolines and adventure playgrounds arranged spaciously outside.

Walby Farm Park is part of a working family farm and accredited by the Rare 
Breed Survival Trust, so the barn is home to friendly and well-cared-for 
livestock, from Shire horses to Tamworth piglets. The cafe is a cut above the 
usual "attraction" standard, too, serving freshly cooked food in generous 
portions.

Walk or cycle round Talkin Tarn
 Photograph: Alamy 
The scenery may not be as dramatic as that surrounding Cumbria's more famous 
lakes, but the 1.3-mile circular walk aroundTalkin Tarn 
<http://www.visitcumbria.com/car/talkin-tarn.htm> is a buggy-friendly, 
bike-friendly route that even the smallest legs will manage. This glacial lake 
is surrounded by 120 acres of mature woodlands crossed by paths and nature 
trails: look out for roe deer, red squirrels and damselflies or hang out in the 
bird observatory to watch ducklings sheltering amid the rushes. Talkin Tarn was 
popular with Victorian rowers, whose sandstone boathouse is now a tearoom and 
ice-cream shop with a first-floor balcony overlooking the North Pennine hills. 
You can still hire rowing boats at weekends and in school holidays.

Hear the toad chorus on the Duddon estuary, near Barrow-in-Furness
 hotograph: Do Van Dijck/Natural England/PA 
Dusk can be deafening on the Duddon estuary between April and June. The 
continuous high-pitched croaking of male natterjack toads carries for miles 
across the sand dunes where they breed in pools: if you close your eyes (and 
ignore the breeze blowing in from the Irish Sea), you could be in the jungle. 
One of the best places for budding naturalists to experience this unforgettable 
sound is the National Trust-managed Sandscale Haws nature reserve near 
Barrow-in-Furness, which is home to a fifth of the UK's natterjack population 
as well as rare butterflies, birds and plants. There are wildflower-rich dunes 
to explore and a sandy beach to run around. Take a flask of hot chocolate and 
stay to watch the sun set over the south-west Cumbrian fells.

Follow in Roman footsteps on Hadrian's Wall
 Photograph: Alamy 
Cumbria boasts some of the best-preserved sections of Hadrian's Wall, the 
world heritage site that once stretched for 73 miles from the Solway Firth to 
the North Sea. They can be found on the 3.5-mile circular walk via Gilsland 
that starts and ends at Birdoswald Roman Fort near Brampton, where the exposed 
gateways and granary houses make for a great game of hide and seek. This is one 
of the most beautifully situated of all the Hadrian's Wall sites. While young 
soldiers march in the footsteps of Roman ghosts and imagine themselves guarding 
the northernmost frontier of the Roman Empire, you can enjoy mesmerising views 
across the Irthing valley towards the Lake District.

Indoor climbing in Kendal
 Lakeland Climbing Centre in Kendal 
If you think you've got as much in common with the human spiders who hang off 
rock faces as you have with an Olympic athlete, you may be surprised to learn 
that anyone can try climbing. At the Lakeland Climbing Centre in Kendal, a 
privately instructed one-hour session is all you need for the whole family 
(fives and over) to experience the thrill of ascending an indoor wall. There 
are group taster sessions, too, and you can ask for a free trial before booking 
a longer slot. The centre has walls and bouldering (rope-free) rooms to suit 
different abilities, and this summer will launch its via ferrata, a kind of 
indoor Go Ape! for over-12s.
• 01539 721766, kendalwall.co.uk <http://www.kendalwall.co.uk/>. Private 
sessions from £58 per hour for four. Taster sessions (weekends and holidays 
only) £15 adults, £12 children (eight and over)

All aboard the South Tynedale Railway
 Photograph: Alamy 
It's just a short hop from Alston to Kirkhaugh on the South Tynedale Railway, 
a narrow-gauge route in the north Pennine hills. But the view through the 
windows will whet your appetite for the journey back – a seven-mile hike along 
the Pennine Way via the evocative earthworks of a Roman fort called Whitley 
Castle. An easier route is the South Tyne Trail, a footpath and cycleway that 
follows the railway line for five miles back to Alston, England's highest 
market town. Alternatively, you could return by train: there's a 40-minute wait 
at Kirkhaugh, time for a short walk to the river. Check the website for steam 
days and special events, such as Teddy Day.

Discover Piel Island, Barrow-in-Furness
 Photograph: Alamy 
Never heard of it? Neither have most Cumbrians, yet this 50-acre island off 
the coast of Barrow has its own castle, king and queen. Take the 12-person foot 
ferry from Roa Island near Barrow to arrive in time for lunch at The Ship, 
where landlord Steve Chattaway (otherwise known as His Majesty) serves locally 
sourced seafood and Piel pork. Go beachcombing on shingle and sandy beaches and 
climb the tower of the 14th-century "castle" – originally a fortified warehouse 
used for smuggling by Furness Abbey – to spot grey seals and gaze across 
Morecambe Bay. You can stay in a family room atThe Ship 
<http://www.pielisland.co.uk/index.php?page=roomrates> (room rates not yet 
available) orcamp inside the castle walls 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2010/may/14/piel-island-wild-camping-cumbria>
. Ferries run daily but are weather-dependent so call Steve in advance to check 
they are running.

Horse ride the Pennine Bridleway
 Pennine Bridleway 
England gets a new national riding trail this summer, and the farm gate at the 
Eden Valley Trail-Riding Centre near Ravenstonedale opens straight onto it. An 
hour-long beginners' ride offers a vertiginous perspective on the beautiful 
limestone fell country sandwiched between the Lake District and the Yorkshire 
Dales; look out for herds of rare-breed ponies roaming freely with their foals. 
Riders (and non-riders) with any level of experience can be catered for. Guided 
rides last between one hour and five days, and there are bikes to hire if you 
prefer two wheels to four legs. The minimum riding age for novices is 10, but 
experienced younger riders may be accommodated by prior arrangement.

<http://www.edenvalleyridingcentre.com/>. From £25 per person for an hour to 
£95 for a full day
