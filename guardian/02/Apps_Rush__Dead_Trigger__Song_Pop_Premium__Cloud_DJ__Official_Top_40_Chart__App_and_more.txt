Madfinger Games' Dead Trigger made a splash on iOS last week, but now it's 
available on Android too. The zombie-strewn first-person shooter looks

Draw-Something-For-Music game Song Pop is still growing fast – 1.9m daily 
active users at the time of writing – but until now its mobile version has been

many matches on the go.

Cloud DJ <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/cloud-dj/id532825892?mt=8>

This is very interesting: an app capable of streaming songs from music service 
SoundCloud, and then mixing, scratching and sampling them in real-time. In 
other words, you can play DJ with whatever tracks have been uploaded to 
SoundCloud, on the fly.
