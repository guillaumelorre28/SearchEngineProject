Trebah was laid out by Charles Fox as a 26-acre pleasure garden in 1831. A 
devout Quaker, Fox wanted to create a piece of "heaven on earth" and was 
particular about the positioning of every tree. A scaffold tower was built to 
represent the eventual height of each new specimen and a young gardener was 
sent to the top to wave a white flag. Armed with a telescope and megaphone, Fox 
would lean from an attic window barking orders to move the tower until he was 
happy.

The next generation saw Trebah capitalise on its warm climate and sheltered 
position in a ravine. Exotic plants were introduced and the garden became well 
known. But in the early 20th century, it became overgrown and virtually 
forgotten.

When the house was sold near the end of the last century, the new owners 
didn't realise what was lurking in the undergrowth. Once they did, however, 
they set about restoring the gardens, and now they boast an impressive 
selection of bromeliads, plants normally found in mostly tropical environments.

The house sits at the top of the slope and there are fine views as you walk to 
the sea through tree ferns and towering gunnera - as close to proper jungle as 
you will find on our islands. (Open all year, 01326 252200,trebah-garden.co.uk
