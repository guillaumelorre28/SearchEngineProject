Q  I have suffered a stomach injury and think I have a sports hernia - there 
is no lump visible but I have discomfort when running and when I sneeze. Will 
it just heal with rest?

A  The sports hernia, as suffered by Ashley Giles and the NFL's Tom Brady, 
came to prominence in the 1980s: it is not taught in medical school and GPs may 
have little experience of it. It is different to a normal hernia: there is no 
bulge or lump, and it can be hard to detect.

The injury itself is a small tear or weakness to the abdominal wall around the 
inguinal canal - a small tunnel leading through the groin - causing a dull ache 
in the groin, and sometimes the testes, that becomes worse with kicking, 
twisting and higher-intensity running. There are no dangers from it and a 
sports physiotherapist can help you try rehab exercises, including core 
stability and work through the adductors, hip and pelvis.

Although athletes can sometimes continue playing and training, a surgical 
repair is now common, especially in professional sports, and is best undertaken 
by a general surgeon with an understanding of the injury. A small 3cm incision 
(rather than keyhole) is normally made and the tear is corrected. Return to 
sport is approximately four weeks for an elite athlete and six to eight weeks 
for others. Specialists are often best found through recommendation and a local 
sports-medicine specialist should be able to make the diagnosis and direct you 
appropriately.
