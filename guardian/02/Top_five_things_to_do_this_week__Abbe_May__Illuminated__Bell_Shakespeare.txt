Illuminated in Melbourne

Sydney Dance Company join the Australian Chamber Orchestra (ACO) to present a 
once-off triple-bill in Melbourne. In an exclusive show, artistic director 
Rafaela Bonachela stages two pieces from his most recent collaborationTriptych 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/02/triptych-review-arthur-rimbauds-homoeroticism-upstaged-by-orchestra>
, plus reprises his 2012 production, Project Rameau. Collaborating with ACO’s 
artistic directorRichard Tognetti 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/09/richard-tognetti-an-anarchist-with-a-chamber-orchestra>
, Project Rameau pulled Jean-Phillippe Rameau’s 18th-century Baroque ballet and 
opera music into the 21st century.

Bonachela’s Les Illuminations is set to Benjamin Britten’s song cycle of the 
same name, based on Arthur Rimbaud’s 1870 poetry suite. Sung by Opera 
Australia’s principal soprano Taryn Fiebig, the work is inspired by both 
Rimbaud and Britten’s male lovers. Variation 10, Bonachela’s most recent 
premiere piece, is also set to Britten’s compositions. Tognetti directs the 
orchestra on stage, to music which Bonachela said seems “almost as if it were 
made to be danced”.

 Bell Shakespeare’s Hamlet starring Josh McConville. Photograph: Daniel Boud 
Damien Ryan’s Hamlet is framed as a cold war political thriller, where the 
private world of Elsinore Castle is turned very public. Josh McConville stars 
as Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark, paralysed by his own inaction and stalted by 
life’s questions.

In a world of insidious surveillance, the audience is spectator to the 
madness, violence and rancour of the “rotten” state. And while modern Denmark 
prepares for war, the enemy sits on the throne.

Ryan has written 
<https://www.bellshakespeare.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/HamletsUnweededGarden-DamienRyan2015.pdf>
: “tragedy teaches us that we spend our lives arming ourselves without 
providing our defences and protecting our interests from external threats, but 
the true threat lies within.” Josh McConville is joined by Sean O’Shea, Doris 
Younane and Matilda Ridgway in this Bell Shakespeare show.

 is at Canberra Theatre Centre until 24 October

Australian producer, director and film critic Richard Kuipers and Margaret 
Pomeranz (of Margaret and David’s At The Movies) are set to teach film fans how 
to become film critics, as part ofAdelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adelaide> film festival. After a 
screening of Pablo Larrain’s 2015 drama, The Club, the pair will help add a few 
critical strings to the audiences’ film discussion bows.

They will bring their own insights to The Club and delve into conversation 
with the audience, honing everyone’s skills in cinematic critique. Any would-be 
critics ambitious enough to step on stage have the opportunity to commit their 
own Margaret and David moment to film. For those after a cheat sheet, here’s the
