 Today's issues of i and Metro - surely a merger would be possible 
In his report yesterday about Mail Online assuming responsibility for Metro's 
website 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/05/metro-website-mail-online>, Mark 
Sweney noted that the move added to speculation that the paper's ultimate 
owner, the Daily Mail & General Trust, may sell off Metro.

He also cited a source who suggested that "the ideal buyer for the title would 
be Alexander Lebedev" because it would be a neat morning fit with theLondon 
Evening Standard <https://www.theguardian.com/media/london-evening-standard>.

But I wonder if there could be an even more tempting scenario for Lebedev to 
consider - a merger between The Independent's sister title, i, andMetro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/metro>. iMetro would be an excellent 
modernist title, would it not?

Though this is only a fantasy, I could imagine it being made to work. They do 
have different agendas, but they both serve up bite-sized chunks of news.i 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/i> has, additionally, serious, longer-form 
reads.

i is selling for 30p after a recent 10p rise. Metro is, of course, free. 
Obviously, iMetro would have to a free morning daily too.

There are two problems for Lebedev, however. First, could he afford to buy 
Metro? Second, should he manage to acquire Metro and create iMetro, what should 
he do withThe Independent <https://www.theguardian.com/media/theindependent>?

I can't offer any suggestion about the former. Either he can raise the money 
or he can't. As to the latter, it strikes me that on the basis of iMetro's 
likely revenue, it might provide a funding lifeline for the Indy.

Perhaps the Indy's distribution could be confined to the major cities served 
by iMetro or even reduced only to London. That could be worked out and may even 
be on the minds of its management right now anyway.

The point is that if Metro is genuinely in play then the Lebedevs ought to 
consider whether it might prove to be their UK newspaper salvation.

They are already in bed with DMGT at the Standard. Their offices are in DMGT's 
headquarters. Surely the two sides could reach some kind of deal. Go for it.
