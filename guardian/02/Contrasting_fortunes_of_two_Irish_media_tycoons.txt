Headline in 2011: "O'Brien is poised for Eircom bid."

What a difference a decade has made in the fortune of Ireland's two media 
entrepreneurs - Tony O'Reilly andDenis O'Brien 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/denis-o-brien>.

Back in 2001, O'Reilly - then chairman of Independent News & Media (INM) - was 
on his way to winning the battle for Eircom, Ireland's dominant telecoms 
company.

O'Reilly's consortium beat off one headed by O'Brien and took the helm for 
five years until Eircom was sold off in 2006 to an Australian investment group, 
Babcock and Brown.

That company later collapsed and a subsidiary, BCM, assumed control and 
rebranded itself as Eircom Holdings.

Meanwhile, O'Brien having lost the 2001 bid battle, went on to build his 
mobile phone network provider, Digicel, into a hugely profitable company.

He also became a thorn in O'Reilly's side by buying into INM and making 
demands that O'Reilly and his successor as chief executive, his son, Gavin, 
have found unacceptable.

However, INM did eventually accede to one persistent O'Brien demand by selling 
offThe Independent <https://www.theguardian.com/media/theindependent> titles in 
Britain.

Overall, O'Reilly's star has fallen while O'Brien's has risen. Now comes 
today's Sunday Times report - unconfirmed by O'Brien's people - that Digicel 
has made an approach for Eircom.

The former state telecom company is in pretty bad shape just now, desperately 
trying to restructure debts reputed to total Â£3.3bn.
