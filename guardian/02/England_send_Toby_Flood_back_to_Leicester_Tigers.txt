Leicester's fly-half Toby Flood has been released from England's squad to face 
France on Sunday. The 26-year-old will instead play for the Tigers against Bath 
in Friday's LV Cup semi-final, with England relying on the Saracens pair of 
Owen Farrell and Charlie Hodgson.

Flood replaced Farrell for the final 15 minutes of England's narrow defeat by 
Wales last month but has played relatively little rugby since returning from 
the knee injury that forced him to miss the start of the championship.

Hodgson, who sat out the Wales game with a gashed finger, was an influential 
figure for Sarries against Wasps and clearly impressed England's interim coach, 
Stuart Lancaster.

Lee Mears, Thomas Waldrom, Paul Doran-Jones and Calum Clark have also been 
released for LV Cup duty this weekend. England are due to name their starting 
XV to face France on Friday.
