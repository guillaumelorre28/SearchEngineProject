As a part-time resident of a small coastal town in East Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/yorkshire>, I was delighted when our newly 
refurbished Meridian Centre was equipped with a decent-sized cinema and began 
showing a regular programme of films. These tend to be screened on Monday 
afternoons and sometimes on Saturday evenings. The Monday sessions are followed 
by a splendid afternoon tea – dainty sandwichs, cakes, as much tea and coffee 
as you can imbibe, all for the sum, film included, of £4. However, audiences 
are not always large and there are times when the money taken does not even 
cover the cost of a screening licence, which can be up to £125 for a one-off 
event. Those running this worthwhile venture tell me that the cinema might have 
to close because of high licensing fees. Nor is Withernsea a place where most 
people can afford to pay, or would pay, £10 a ticket. In Cannes film festival 
week, we should remember there are many such small cinemas in operation now. Is 
it really necessary for the distributors to charge so much for what is 
essentially the loan of a DVD? Surely some discretion could be used in the case 
of small cinema venues which do provide a valuable service to a community?
