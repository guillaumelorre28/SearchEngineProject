BACKGROUND
 liberty central factbox Photograph: liberty central 
The coroners and justice bill 
<http://www.commonsleader.gov.uk/output/page2655.asp> was introduced in the 
House of Commons on 14 January 2009, with the widespread expectation that it 
would revive the plan for so-called "secret inquests", which had been dropped 
from theCounter Terrorism Act 2008 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/19/counter-terrorism-act>
. The charity Inquest had expressed "serious concerns" about the proposal, 
which it said could undermine public confidence in deaths involving state 
agents, such as theshooting of Jean Charles de Menezes 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/feb/04/uk.ukcrime>, and "result in 
inquests into highly contentious deaths in custody taking place without juries 
in private, with government-appointed coroners".

Described by justice secretary Jack Straw as the first major reform of the 
coroners' service in more than 100 years, the bill contained provisions 
enabling inquests to be held without a jury in order, it said, to protect the 
interests of national security, and the relationship between the United Kingdom 
and another country; to assist in preventing or detecting crime; to protect the 
safety of a witness or other person; or to prevent real harm to the public 
interest. The government sought to introduce the concept of "certified 
investigations" into the inquest system. This would allow the secretary of 
state to certify that an inquest (including one where a person has died in 
state custody or at the hands of the state) was to be held without a jury.

The bill also originally contained measures to allow the widespread sharing of 
personal data 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jan/15/sharing-personal-data-whitehall>
 across Whitehall departments and throughout the public sector. Clause 152 was 
designed to introduce a fast-track process to allow ministers to share 
sensitive data held by the government, individuals or private companies "for 
any public policy purpose", reversing the data protection principle that 
information provided to one government agency for one purpose should not 
normally be used by another for a different purpose.

The clause attracted a diverse collection of critics 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/feb/28/convention-modern-liberty-information>
, including former home secretary David Blunkett, who suggested the provisions 
needed to be "examined thoroughly" to determinewhether the powers were likely 
to be misused 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/feb/24/civil-liberties>
, and in March 2009 the government abandoned its data-sharing plans.

As the report stage began, the extremely tight two-day timetable for debate 
proposed by the government sparked angry protests from MPs – ministers were 
accused of showing"reckless disregard for the House of Commons and the proper 
parliamentary scrutiny of legislation" 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090323/debtext/90323-0008.htm>
. Time constraints meant MPs were unable to debate former health secretary
Patricia Hewitt's amendment 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/mar/20/assisted-suicide-human-rights>
 to change the law on assisted suicide, the changes to the laws on murder, and 
free speech concerns over the offence ofstirring up hatred on the grounds of 
sexual orientation 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/mar/24/hate-speech-rowan-atkinson>
.

Instead, debate focused on the "secret inquest" proposal. Straw made a number 
of concessions 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090323/debtext/90323-0011.htm>
. Nevertheless, Labour's John McDonnell denounced the government's amendments 
as a "phenomenon called Strawism'' under which a bill was produced that was "so 
outrageous the house recoils against it'" and then ministers bring forward 
amendments so MPs "happily skip through the lobbies" in the belief they have 
won change.Nineteen Labour MPs  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/mar/24/yesterday-in-parliament> 
rebelled and in May 2009 Straw admitted the provisions did not command the 
necessary cross-party support and announced the government was abandoning its 
plans for jury-free inquests.

However, in October, to the fury of campaigners, the government made clear 
that it intended to use a provision hidden in one of the schedules to the act 
to effectively terminate independent inquests, replacing them with inquiries 
under the Inquiries Act 2005 when it so wished, therebyreviving the prospect of 
secret inquests via the backdoor 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8320976.stm>. The new measures would 
allow the government to suspend an inquest and instead conduct a secret inquiry 
into the death. Under the Inquiries Act 2005, the government would be able to 
restrict the disclosure of documents and withhold parts of the final report of 
any inquiry. TheLords passed <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8356434.stm> the 
measures after the government made the smallest of concessions – giving the 
lord chief justice the power to veto requests for private inquests and to 
appoint the judge.

Time constraints then forced the government to concede defeat 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/14/prison-blogging-law> on 
provisions that would have repealed afree speech clause 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/06/sexuality-free-speech-inciting-hatred>
 inserted by the Lords into the offence of incitement to homophobic hatred 
during the process of theCriminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/13/criminal-justice-immigration-act>
.

CRITICISM

On the resurresction of the secret inquests provisions, Isabella Sankey, 
Liberty's director of policy, said: "It is thoroughly perverse for a government 
that has spent over a decade lecturing the public about victims' rights to 
attempt to exclude bereaved families from open justice. When will New Labour's 
obsession with secret courts and parallel legal systems end? There is no 
accountability without transparency." Liberty's director Shami Chakrabarti 
argued: "Whether in Brixton or Basra, those who die on the government's watch 
are entitled to better than this … national security can be protected within 
the jury system but the political embarrassment of soldiers killed by 'friendly 
fire' should never be camouflaged from public view."
