We are writing to express our deep concern about the threatened closure of the 
New Art Gallery Walsall <http://thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/about/> as a 
result of cuts to public funding (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/26/theres-nowhere-else-for-children-walsall-locals-react-to-library-closure-plans>
, 26 October). Since it opened in February 2000, just before Tate Modern in 
London, the gallery has become a symbol of the social and economic regeneration 
of Walsall. It has been proof that the nation is committed to the principle 
that everyone should have access to the arts wherever they live in the UK.

The gallery is the home of the world-famous Garman Ryan Collection 
<http://thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/collections-library/> – 365 works gifted 
by Kathleen Garman to the people of Walsall in 1973. This donation features 
many works by her husband, the renowned sculptorJacob Epstein 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2012/oct/01/jacob-epstein-torso-metal-rock-drill>
, their friends and family members, including Modigliani and Lucian Freud, 
alongside masterpieces by artists such as Turner, Van Gogh, Monet and Constable.

The gallery has worked with many leading contemporary artists over the years, 
presenting a programme of outstanding commissions and exhibitions. Its closure 
would be a devastating blow to the life of the community and send a signal that 
the authorities have no regard for the value of the arts to those very 
communities.
