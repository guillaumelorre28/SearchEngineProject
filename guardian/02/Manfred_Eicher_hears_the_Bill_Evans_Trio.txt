One day in 1961 an 18-year-old German music student named Manfred Eicher 
descended the steps of the Village Vanguard in Greenwich Village to hear the 
pianistBill Evans <https://www.theguardian.com/music/bill-evans>, the bassist 
Scott LaFaro and the drummer Paul Motian. Breaking away from the conventions, 
they were pursuing an ideal of improvisation as a continuous three-way 
conversation. Inspired by what he heard, Eicher would go on to found theÂ ECM 
label, dedicated to jazz as chamber music.
