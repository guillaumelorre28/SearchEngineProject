.

Some 2,400 staff were to get a share in €40m (£34m) in bonuses today, but the 
payout was cancelled after finance minister Brian Lenihan blocked the pay-out.

He told the AIB board that the continued bailout of the bank was conditional 
on the bonuses not being paid and emergency legislation to support this was put 
through the Dail this week.

But today, it is reported that a group of staff in AIB's capital markets 
division were set to file a claim in Dublin's circuit court before the the new 
Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act comes into force.

One trader, John Foy, has already taken AIB to court in respect of a €161,000 
bonus. His payout was not affected by the government intervention but all the 
others were.

The Irish Times says a number of sources confirmed a second group of capital 
markets staff were planning legal action.
