The fortune of Independent News & Media (INM) shareholder Denis O'Brien 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/denis-o-brien> has been laid bare after 
accounts for his Digicel business showed he personally received a dividend of 
$40m (£24m) from the phone empire last year.

His mobile phone company, which he owns outright, dominates the market in the 
Caribbean – over 10 years he has seen off companies like Cable & Wireless and 
now counts 11.5m customers in 32 countries including Jamaica, Trinidad and 
Tobago, Barbados and St Lucia.

In the year to March 2011, revenues at Digicel were up 27% to $2.23bn with 
similar growth in earnings before interest, tax and depreciation (ebitda), 
which was up from $753m to $954m.

Whatever his local difficulties (he was embroiled in a mobile phone 
controversy relating to a licensing round in the 1990s), there is no doubting 
that O'Brien is one of Ireland's most successful businessmen.

And as the single biggest shareholder in INM 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2011/may/07/independent-news-and-media-mediabusiness>
 – he owns around 22% of the stock – the question everyone wants an answer to 
is whether he willmount a full takeover bid and try to take out Sir Tony 
O'Reilly and his family 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ireland-business-blog-with-lisa-ocarroll/2011/jun/06/ireland-gavin-o-reilly>
, who have built up the newspaper group over the past 30 years.

The recent Sunday Times Rich List put O'Brien's wealth at £2.7bn and his 
business is valued at almost twice that. So on the face of it, it looks as if 
he has the wherewithal.

INM has a current market capitalisation of just over €310m (£270m) and, with 
net debt of €446m, it has an enterprise value (or base price) of €756m. Take 
away the value of O'Brien's 22% existing shares and that's reduced to €688m. 
Add to that the premium he would have to pay for a full takeover and you could 
easily be up to more than €1bn, say financiers in Dublin.

As one pointed out: "One group of shareholders, the O'Reillys, would want a 
very large premium for this stock."

The pertinent question is whether O'Brien wants to make a bid. He has lost 
vast amounts building up a stake in the group – he paid close to €600m for 
shares that are now worth a tenth of that. And for what? The company isn't 
paying dividends and isn't expected to until at least the middle or end of 2012.

The one thing O'Brien does want, however, is more influence at the group – 
yes, his camp take credit for the disposal of the London Independent newspaper, 
but he would dearly love to have much more say in editorial direction and 
particularly digital strategy.

His 22% stake evidently hasn't delivered this – he is resorting to the courts 
to pursue one of the group's most senior journalists, for example. Not 
something you'd see a Rupert Murdoch or even a Richard Desmond doing.

So what does he do next? Sit tight? Make a move or count his losses and move 
on? As one executive I spoke to who knows him said: "His biggest disappointment 
is that he hasn't been able to influence the company."

INM is Ireland's biggest newspaper group, but in terms of world media it 
hasn't got the size and spread, or the accelerated growth, of the likes of a 
News Corp or a Google.

Why on earth does O'Brien want a slice of Irish action, given he has such 
demonstrable success in emerging markets where real progress and profits are 
being made?
