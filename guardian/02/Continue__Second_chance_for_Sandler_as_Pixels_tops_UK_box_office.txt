The fake winner: Pixels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/pixels-review-adam-sandler-comedy>

With £2.66m including previews, Adam Sandler sci-fi comedy Pixels storms to 
the top of the UK box office, dethroningFantastic Four 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/05/fantastic-four-review-marvel-superhero-dawdling>
. However, the key words here are “including previews”, since the Pixels number 
is, in fact, based on seven days of play, including takings the previous 
Saturday and Sunday as well as Wednesday and Thursday last week. All of that 
added up to £1.33m, essentially doubling the Pixels opening tally. Without 
previews, Pixels opened in fourth place, behind Inside Out,Mission: Impossible 
– Rogue Nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/30/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-review>
 and newcomerThe Man from UNCLE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/11/the-man-from-uncle-review-style-paired-with-deathly-boring-substance>
. Even so, the real weekend number represented the best opening for a Sandler 
film since Grown Ups 2 began with £1.65m plus £421,000 previews two years ago. 
That film was an ensemble. For a bigger Sandler star vehicle, you’d have to go 
back to February 2011 and romantic comedy Just Go With It, which began with 
£1.63m. On that occasion, co-star Jennifer Aniston provided another strong 
marketable name.

Ignoring previews from the Pixels total, box-office honours at the weekend 
belong to Inside Out. The Pixar hit declined a very slim 3% from the previous 
frame, for fourth-weekend takings of £1.91m, and a total so far of £27.41m. 
Only three 2015 releases have earned more in their fourth weekend of play:
Jurassic World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/10/jurassic-world-review-chris-pratt-steven-spielberg-dinosaur-movie>
,Minions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/minions-review-boisterous-and-cheery-despicable-me-spin-off>
 and, surprisingly, Disney’sBig Hero 6 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/29/big-hero-6-review>. Inside Out 
has now overtaken DreamWorks Animation’sHome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/19/home-review-rihanna-kids-animation>
 to be the second-biggest animated hit of 2015, behind Minions (£43.24m so 
far). Minions saw a 13% rise in box office at the weekend. Presumably families 
who went abroad at the start of the school holiday are now returning to the UK, 
and catching up on cinema visits. The past week saw Inside Out overtake 
Ratatouille (£24.80m) to rise another place in the Pixar all-time box office 
chart. Next in its sights: A Bug’s Life, with £29.45m.

Two films originating as 1960s TV spy shows are battling for audiences. 
Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation held well in its third week of play, 
declining 34%. After 18 days, its total stands at £14.77m. A place below it in 
the chart is Guy Ritchie’s The Man from UNCLE, which begins with a so-so 
£1.45m. Rogue Nation, of course, is the latest sequel in a star franchise with 
proven box-office appeal. UNCLE represented a significantly riskier proposition 
– reviving a spy property that has been little seen in decades, and without the 
benefit of an A-list star (Henry Cavill is relatively unproven outside his 
Superman role). Ritchie also took the decision to retain UNCLE’s original 1960s 
cold war setting, which makes the film more distinctive, but also potentially 
more niche. For comparison, the first of Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes films began 
with £3.08m in December 2009, earned from just two days of play (the Friday 
that weekend was Christmas Day, when cinemas are closed. That movie had the 
advantage of a more famous character, as well as major star Robert Downey Jr. 
The sequel opened with £3.83m two years later. As for Rogue Nation, franchise 
predecessorGhost Protocol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/22/mission-impossible-ghost-protocol-review>
 stood at £15.37m at the same stage of its run, although that film benefited 
from a more aggressive previews strategy. The film maxed out at £18.31m, which 
is a realistic target for Rogue Nation. It should soon overtake the 
lowest-grossing film in the series,Mission: Impossible 3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/may/05/3> (lifetime of £15.45m).

Few consumers of UK entertainment media in the past month could have been 
unaware that a) Amy Schumer is a rising US comedy star earning comparisons with 
Lena Dunham, and b) she has a new film called Trainwreck. Universal’s 
well-orchestrated publicity campaign translated to a UK opening of £932,000, 
which is a nice number for an actress with zero box-office track record in the 
UK, although unremarkable for director Judd Apatow. His last effort as director,
This Is 40 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/14/this-is-40-review>, 
kicked off with £911,000 plus £319,000 in previews, in February 2013. 
Discounting previews, Apatow’s best opening as director came fromKnocked Up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/24/juddapatow.comedy> in 2007, with 
£1.58m.

Simon Pegg comedy Absolutely Anything, from director Terry Jones, begins with 
a mediocre £487,000 from 314 venues. That’s slightly down on the first frame 
for Pegg’s last lead role, romcomMan Up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/28/man-up-review-simon-pegg-lake-bell>
 (£529,000). But it’s a big improvement on the opening salvo for the one before 
that,Hector and the Search for Happiness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/17/hector-and-the-search-for-happiness-review>
 (£240,000 from 279 cinemas). (Pegg’s 2014 hitman comedy Kill Me Three Times 
has yet to have a UK theatrical release.) Reviews for Absolutely Anything were 
discouraging, with a poor 14% Fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes. “Watch 
absolutely anything else,” advised theObserver’s Jonathan Romney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/16/absolutely-anything-review-squalid-dated-romp>
. “One of the worst movies yet made,” cautioned Kevin Maher in the Times. 
“Lightly feeble,” advised a slightly more positive Robbie Collin in the 
Telegraph.

Following six straight weeks when Amy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/16/amy-review-asif-kapadias-amy-winehouse-film-is-a-tragic-masterpiece>
 was the top attraction for indie cinema fans, the documentary yields to Noah 
Baumbach’sMistress America 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/mistress-america-review-anxieties-of-youth-and-middle-age-on-a-wave-of-zane>
, starring Greta Gerwig and Lola Kirke. The film’s debut of £165,000 from 78 
cinemas doesn’t make an easy comparison with Baumbach’s previous featureWhile 
We’re Young 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/while-were-young-ben-stiller-review-noah-baumbach-adam-driver>
, which opened more aggressively at 250 cinemas, delivering a £427,000 first 
frame. A more apt comparison isFrances Ha 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/25/frances-ha-baumbach-gerwig-review>
, which, like Mistress America, is co-written by and stars Gerwig. It began in 
July 2013 with £151,000 from 60 venues, on its way to a lifetime £743,000. 
Amy’s latest cume is £3.42m, taking it past bothMarch of the Penguins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/dec/09/3> (£3.31m) and Deep Sea 3D 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/mar/03/documentary.johnnydepp> (£3.40m) 
to make it the second-biggest non-concert documentary in the UK, behind
Fahrenheit 9/11 <https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/jul/09/1> 
(£6.55m). Director Asif Kapadia now occupies both second and fifth place in 
this all-time chart, with Senna at £3.17m.

Despite the lack of big new releases, takings are 18% up on the previous 
frame, and level with the equivalent weekend a year ago, when The Inbetweeners 
2 retained the top spot and The Expendables 3 was the biggest newcomer. The 
coming session offers one film that is hard to call:The Bad Education Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/live/2015/aug/07/jack-whitehall-webchat-the-bad-education-movie>
, co-written by and starring Jack Whitehall. It’s hard to imagine it having the 
same impact as The Inbetweeners Movie, but how many of the show’s viewers will 
convert to ticket buyers, and how widely it will appeal beyond the TV base, are 
anyone’s guess. In addition, Fox releasedPaper Towns 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/paper-towns-review-cara-delevingne-is-not-enough>
, from The Fault in Our Stars author John Green, on Monday, giving the teen 
drama a whole week of play in its opening session. Franchise rebootVacation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/27/vacation-review-ed-helms-christina-applegate>
 offers National Lampoon road-trip laughs. Sinister 2 is the latest genre flick 
from prolific producer Jason Blum. Benicio Del Toro stars as the famed drug 
kingpin in Escobar: Paradise Lost, with Hunger Games’ Josh Hutcherson. 
Following Tamara Drewe, Gemma Bovery is the latest adaptation of a Posy 
Simmonds graphic novel playing on a literary classic (in this case Flaubert’s 
Madame Bovary) and starring Gemma Arterton.The Wolfpack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/sundance-2015-review-the-wolfpack-documentary-brothers>
 won the documentary grand jury prize at Sundance. Good People is the latest to 
feature the ever busy James Franco.
