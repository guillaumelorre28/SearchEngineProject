So how did that go?

Malcolm Turnbull got through Q&A still in possession of his voice – tick, and 
even though there was the odd pulse of irritation, he didn’t lose his cool. Two 
ticks. Give that man a barley sugar and a whisky.

His backroom will think that went well enough. He got all the talking points 
up, he pulled theyou elect me to lead formulation when pressed by an asylum 
seeker on Manus Island, which sounds prime ministerial to political advisers. 
He put some distance between himself andTony Abbott, and between himself and 
the right wing of the Liberal party, while insisting he was a team player at 
heart.Malcolm Turnbull is not even close to being a team player at heart, but 
he will be if that’s the price of political leadership. He’s demonstrated that 
amply since taking the prime ministership, that he won’t strain theatrically on 
his leash, he’ll just move his head slowly every now and again just to prove 
he’s still in there somewhere. We saw that tonight. Slow head movements, but a 
whole lot of compliance, in succession. A funny sort of signalling. Not 
terribly convincing to the voters who would like him to be more progressive, 
vaguely irritating to colleagues who think he’s a communist. Such is life, at 
leastMalcolm Turnbull’s life.

This is a very superficial observation but I’ll make it anyway. The head cold 
leant his voice a patrician quality that it doesn’t normally have. If you 
listened to him rather than looked at him he sounded very controlled, entirely 
calculated. This morning he sounded likeNeville Wran. Tonight he sounded a bit 
likeMalcolm Fraser, which was a bit odd.

Less superficial, entirely interesting, is the low balling effort I mentioned 
in an aside during the live call.Malcolm Turnbull is trying to get up this 
concept that you only have to give him another three years. It’s not a lifetime 
commitment. It’s not a tattoo, it’s just three years. I really do find this 
fascinating and the pitch is deliberate. He thinks he can persuade undecided 
voters to shut their eyes, hold their noses, and let him have one term to make 
his case. He thinks this is a compelling pitch, otherwise, why make it? And the 
lack of ambition attached to that says everything about the mood of the 
Australian electorate right now, expectations are low, there is a weariness 
with the shenanigans. Will it work? Well, in two weeks, we’ll find out.

Do-overs

Q: When you took office, I think there was a great sense of optimism in the 
community. If you reflect back now on your past 10 months in your job, are you 
satisfied with your leadership and achievements of you and your government? And 
if you got a do-over, what would you do differently?

Malcolm Turnbull would like to actually answer this question but he knows 
people will shout at him if he doesn’t deliver the talking points as this is 
the final question. This could have been interesting, but it wasn’t, just the 
stump speech.

That’s it from Brisbane. I’ll be back shortly with a couple of quick thoughts.

Arts

Q: Will you commit to funding a strong, completely independent Australia 
Council for the Arts?

Malcolm Turnbull his new arts minister has not directed arts funding 
politically. He’s a bit irritated because the questioner is persistent.

OK, if you let me finish, I’ll just complete the answer.

Abortion

A question on the consequences of late term abortions. Babies dying in 
clinics. Turnbull is clearly horrified, but he holds the line. Abortion is a 
state issue.

Malcolm Turnbull:

The law that relates to abortion is very much within the jurisdiction of your 
parliament here in Queensland.

Plebiscite: show me some leadership, and do your job

A woman with a gay son wants him to get married, like his siblings.

Q: The $160 million plebiscite money is better spent treating depression, 
alcoholism, drugs and suicide prevention. Why are you not amending the law 
within the Marriage Act? It is a parliamentary process. We elect 
representatives into parliament. Just show me some leadership by doing your job.

Malcolm Turnbull says the woman makes a compelling point, but the policy was a 
government decision before his time as leader.

Q: You’re the prime minister!

Malcolm Turnbull:

I am the PM but I’m not the dictator. Some people like the idea of prime 
ministers that ignore their colleagues. I don’t agree with that. I’m a strong 
believer in traditional cabinet government. And that means compromise. That 
means listening to your colleagues. That means being the first among equals and 
respecting the views of those in your cabinet and in your party room that you 
may not agree with.

Equal opportunity social conservatism

Q: Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman has made comments calling homosexuality an evil act 
which brought evil outcomes. How are these anymore abhorrent than the comments 
by Senator Cory Bernardi suggesting that homosexuality leads to beastiality or 
George Christensen saying Safe Schools leads to grooming?

Malcolm Turnbull says he rejects and condemns any comments which disparage any 
group of Australians. By anyone.

NBN

Turnbull is challenged on the NBN. The prime minister gives his standard 
response, Labor mucked this project up. We are fixing it.

Malcolm Turnbull:

We have taken this failed project and we’re delivering it and we’re delivering 
it quickly and at lower cost.

Manus part III

Q: I’m thinking of the homophobia response that you made only last Thursday 
night where you said that we are, our democracy is based on respect. The better 
we are at doing that, and showing love, is the best way for us to go. Why can’t 
you change, and take that concept and put it on to Manus Island?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Thank you. And that’s a very fair question. This is the problem. If we were to 
say to all of the people on Manus: “OK, come and settle in Australia” that 
would be the biggest marketing opportunity for the people smugglers you have 
ever seen.

The boats would be setting off again.

He rounds out with tough choices. You elect me to make them.

Manus, part II

Q: Mr Turnbull, recently a contractor who worked on Manus Island was returning 
to his work there and in very low tones he said to the editor of the Australian 
Adventist Record, “It is terrible the way they treat the people there. They are 
treated worse than animals.” Will you visit this concentration camp and see it 
for yourself?

Malcolm Turnbull says no-one has hearts of stone.

The Manus Island facility is managed by, as you know, by the government of 
Papua New Guinea. We are satisfied that the conditions there are not as 
described by the contractor you referred to. Look, I recognise all of us, every 
one - none of us have hearts of stone. All of us understand how harsh it is, 
our policy is in terms of its impact on particular individuals.

Now he’s into the risks of Labor, restarting the boats.

Malcolm Turnbull:

I grant you [the policy] is tough. It is tough. But the alternative is far 
worse and that is what I, as PM, that’s the tough choice that you entrust me to 
make as this nation’s leader.

Dispatch from Manus island

The prime minister gets a question from a detainee on Manus Island.

Tony Jones explains his background.

He’s an Iranian Kurdish journalist who fled his country to avoid imprisonment 
from his writing. He does meet the criteria to be recognised as a refugee. But 
he’s been detained for three years on Manus. Can you offer him any hope that he 
will be released from there?

Malcolm Turnbull says he’s sure this man would like to come to Australia but 
that isn’t an option for him. He says the policy is firm and it needs to remain 
firm to stop drownings at sea. He says the policy is working.

Q: We have just received an SMS from the gentleman who sent the earlier video 
question. He says that we need firm action, more than soft words. Future reform 
needs to be more bottom up and inclusive. Do you have structure in place for 
this?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, the answer is that we just talked about them, the early psychosis 
centres and Headspace. But I have to say that there is a place for, if not soft 
words, at least kind words.

Destigmatising, removing the taboo on discussing mental illness and being 
alert to it is very, very important. A lot of people can go all too quickly 
from being down to being depressed to being self-destructive. And that warm 
hand of outreach is more than a soft word. It can be a saving word. It can be a

Suicide

The next question is youth suicide. A man who had lost two kids to suicide. 
Completely ghastly.

Mental health is not a partisan issue, Malcolm Turnbull says.

Everybody is committed to this.

A follow up question on why the government is cutting funding for early 
psychosis intervention in the Headspace centres.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, the answer is we’re not. The answer is we are not.

Short termism, an interjection

Very interesting, the short termism in the Coalition’s election pitch. There 
is a ten year plan for tax cuts, butMalcolm Turnbull says you only need elect 
me for another three years. Just like the new advertisement, with#faketradie. 
Give us a go,for a while.

Trickle down

Next question is on the company tax cuts.

Q: Mr Turnbull, your jobs and growth mantra is based on the trickle-down 
economics theory. Your former employer Goldman Sachs, and many other trusted 
sources, have raised serious concerns about these tax cuts and confirmed a 
significant proportion of the windfall will benefit overseas investors, 
shareholders, and not trickle down at all. Over 10 years the plan will cost the 
Australian taxpayer in the vicinity of $50bn. Why should ordinaryAustralians 
support cuts to our services to give companies a tax cut that according to so 
many experts probably won’t create jobs or contribute to growth significantly? 
And elsewhere has been shown to increase inequality in society?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, thank you. Firstly, let me say that the cutting company tax does not 
increase inequality in society. There has been a long trend towards reducing 
company tax right around the world. The biggest cutter of company tax in our 
lifetimes is in fact Paul Keating.

Now we are into the cut throat global competition for capital. And the 
importance of enterprise.

The questioner persists.

Q: There is no requirement on companies to invest in jobs. They could just 
pocket the windfall. So it seems to me to be an experiment at the expense of 
services that Australian taxpayers expect?

Malcolm Turnbull says first up the tax cuts are for small firms. If you don’t 
like the results of the first three years of a re-elected Turnbull government,
you can chuckme out, the prime minister says.

I’m asking for a three year renewal of my government’s job, serving you.

Tax

The next question is about tax reform: why aren’t we looking at income tax 
reform and GST reform.Malcolm Turnbull says the budget did contain income tax 
changes. On the GST, the case wasn’t made to change anything through the 
distributional analysis.

Malcolm Turnbull:

And that is why we are not touching the GST.

We will not touch the GST. It does not stack up from an equitable 
distributional point of view.

Expenditure restraint

Q: Both of the major parties have pledged a return to surplus in 2020, 2021, 
and say their spending promises can be funded. Given treasury forecasts have 
fallen short by billions of dollars, it would seem that future projections are 
unreliable. With this historic reality, it appears a commitment to surplus and 
generous promises are being made on the never, never. Without going far enough 
with necessary spending cuts, are both sides guilty of ignoring economic facts?

Malcolm Turnbull launches a homily on the perils of forecasting. Tricky 
business, forecasting.

Q: We would be sceptical about your promise to come to a surplus then because 
that’s beyond the period of the budget?

Malcolm Turnbull:

No.

Q: It’s a forecast. Isn’t it?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Let me go on.

The prime minister smiles widely when Jones keeps pulling him up before 
launching the sledge, with smile fixed.

Q: I have to jump in here ..

Malcolm Turnbull:

Of course you do. You have to defend the Labor Party, Tony.

But for now, grab a camomile tea and hit the sack. Thanks for reading.
 
Malcolm Turnbull got through Q&A still in possession of his voice – tick, and 
even though there was the odd pulse of irritation, he didn’t lose his cool. Two 
ticks. Give that man a barley sugar and a whisky.

His backroom will think that went well enough. He got all the talking points 
up, he pulled theyou elect me to lead formulation when pressed by an asylum 
seeker on Manus Island, which sounds prime ministerial to political advisers. 
He put some distance between himself andTony Abbott, and between himself and 
the right wing of the Liberal party, while insisting he was a team player at 
heart.Malcolm Turnbull is not even close to being a team player at heart, but 
he will be if that’s the price of political leadership. He’s demonstrated that 
amply since taking the prime ministership, that he won’t strain theatrically on 
his leash, he’ll just move his head slowly every now and again just to prove 
he’s still in there somewhere. We saw that tonight. Slow head movements, but a 
whole lot of compliance, in succession. A funny sort of signalling. Not 
terribly convincing to the voters who would like him to be more progressive, 
vaguely irritating to colleagues who think he’s a communist. Such is life, at 
leastMalcolm Turnbull’s life.

This is a very superficial observation but I’ll make it anyway. The head cold 
leant his voice a patrician quality that it doesn’t normally have. If you 
listened to him rather than looked at him he sounded very controlled, entirely 
calculated. This morning he sounded likeNeville Wran. Tonight he sounded a bit 
likeMalcolm Fraser, which was a bit odd.

Less superficial, entirely interesting, is the low balling effort I mentioned 
in an aside during the live call.Malcolm Turnbull is trying to get up this 
concept that you only have to give him another three years. It’s not a lifetime 
commitment. It’s not a tattoo, it’s just three years. I really do find this 
fascinating and the pitch is deliberate. He thinks he can persuade undecided 
voters to shut their eyes, hold their noses, and let him have one term to make 
his case. He thinks this is a compelling pitch, otherwise, why make it? And the 
lack of ambition attached to that says everything about the mood of the 
Australian electorate right now, expectations are low, there is a weariness 
with the shenanigans. Will it work? Well, in two weeks, we’ll find out.
 
Q: When you took office, I think there was a great sense of optimism in the 
community. If you reflect back now on your past 10 months in your job, are you 
satisfied with your leadership and achievements of you and your government? And 
if you got a do-over, what would you do differently?

Malcolm Turnbull would like to actually answer this question but he knows 
people will shout at him if he doesn’t deliver the talking points as this is 
the final question. This could have been interesting, but it wasn’t, just the 
stump speech.

That’s it from Brisbane. I’ll be back shortly with a couple of quick thoughts.
 
Q: Will you commit to funding a strong, completely independent Australia 
Council for the Arts?

Malcolm Turnbull his new arts minister has not directed arts funding 
politically. He’s a bit irritated because the questioner is persistent.

OK, if you let me finish, I’ll just complete the answer.
 
A question on the consequences of late term abortions. Babies dying in 
clinics. Turnbull is clearly horrified, but he holds the line. Abortion is a 
state issue.

Malcolm Turnbull:

The law that relates to abortion is very much within the jurisdiction of your 
parliament here in Queensland.
 
A woman with a gay son wants him to get married, like his siblings.

Q: The $160 million plebiscite money is better spent treating depression, 
alcoholism, drugs and suicide prevention. Why are you not amending the law 
within the Marriage Act? It is a parliamentary process. We elect 
representatives into parliament. Just show me some leadership by doing your job.

Malcolm Turnbull says the woman makes a compelling point, but the policy was a 
government decision before his time as leader.

Q: You’re the prime minister!

Malcolm Turnbull:

I am the PM but I’m not the dictator. Some people like the idea of prime 
ministers that ignore their colleagues. I don’t agree with that. I’m a strong 
believer in traditional cabinet government. And that means compromise. That 
means listening to your colleagues. That means being the first among equals and 
respecting the views of those in your cabinet and in your party room that you 
may not agree with.
 
Q: Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman has made comments calling homosexuality an evil act 
which brought evil outcomes. How are these anymore abhorrent than the comments 
by Senator Cory Bernardi suggesting that homosexuality leads to beastiality or 
George Christensen saying Safe Schools leads to grooming?

Malcolm Turnbull says he rejects and condemns any comments which disparage any 
group of Australians. By anyone.
 
Turnbull is challenged on the NBN. The prime minister gives his standard 
response, Labor mucked this project up. We are fixing it.

Malcolm Turnbull:

We have taken this failed project and we’re delivering it and we’re delivering 
it quickly and at lower cost.
 
Q: I’m thinking of the homophobia response that you made only last Thursday 
night where you said that we are, our democracy is based on respect. The better 
we are at doing that, and showing love, is the best way for us to go. Why can’t 
you change, and take that concept and put it on to Manus Island?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Thank you. And that’s a very fair question. This is the problem. If we were to 
say to all of the people on Manus: “OK, come and settle in Australia” that 
would be the biggest marketing opportunity for the people smugglers you have 
ever seen.

The boats would be setting off again.

He rounds out with tough choices. You elect me to make them.
 
Q: Mr Turnbull, recently a contractor who worked on Manus Island was returning 
to his work there and in very low tones he said to the editor of the Australian 
Adventist Record, “It is terrible the way they treat the people there. They are 
treated worse than animals.” Will you visit this concentration camp and see it 
for yourself?

Malcolm Turnbull says no-one has hearts of stone.

The Manus Island facility is managed by, as you know, by the government of 
Papua New Guinea. We are satisfied that the conditions there are not as 
described by the contractor you referred to. Look, I recognise all of us, every 
one - none of us have hearts of stone. All of us understand how harsh it is, 
our policy is in terms of its impact on particular individuals.

Now he’s into the risks of Labor, restarting the boats.

Malcolm Turnbull:

I grant you [the policy] is tough. It is tough. But the alternative is far 
worse and that is what I, as PM, that’s the tough choice that you entrust me to 
make as this nation’s leader.
 
The prime minister gets a question from a detainee on Manus Island.

Tony Jones explains his background.

He’s an Iranian Kurdish journalist who fled his country to avoid imprisonment 
from his writing. He does meet the criteria to be recognised as a refugee. But 
he’s been detained for three years on Manus. Can you offer him any hope that he 
will be released from there?

Malcolm Turnbull says he’s sure this man would like to come to Australia but 
that isn’t an option for him. He says the policy is firm and it needs to remain 
firm to stop drownings at sea. He says the policy is working.
 
Q: We have just received an SMS from the gentleman who sent the earlier video 
question. He says that we need firm action, more than soft words. Future reform 
needs to be more bottom up and inclusive. Do you have structure in place for 
this?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, the answer is that we just talked about them, the early psychosis 
centres and Headspace. But I have to say that there is a place for, if not soft 
words, at least kind words.

Destigmatising, removing the taboo on discussing mental illness and being 
alert to it is very, very important. A lot of people can go all too quickly 
from being down to being depressed to being self-destructive. And that warm 
hand of outreach is more than a soft word. It can be a saving word. It can be a 
saving outreach.
 
The next question is youth suicide. A man who had lost two kids to suicide. 
Completely ghastly.

Mental health is not a partisan issue, Malcolm Turnbull says.

Everybody is committed to this.

A follow up question on why the government is cutting funding for early 
psychosis intervention in the Headspace centres.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, the answer is we’re not. The answer is we are not.
 
Very interesting, the short termism in the Coalition’s election pitch. There 
is a ten year plan for tax cuts, butMalcolm Turnbull says you only need elect 
me for another three years. Just like the new advertisement, with#faketradie. 
Give us a go,for a while.
 
Next question is on the company tax cuts.

Q: Mr Turnbull, your jobs and growth mantra is based on the trickle-down 
economics theory. Your former employer Goldman Sachs, and many other trusted 
sources, have raised serious concerns about these tax cuts and confirmed a 
significant proportion of the windfall will benefit overseas investors, 
shareholders, and not trickle down at all. Over 10 years the plan will cost the 
Australian taxpayer in the vicinity of $50bn. Why should ordinaryAustralians 
support cuts to our services to give companies a tax cut that according to so 
many experts probably won’t create jobs or contribute to growth significantly? 
And elsewhere has been shown to increase inequality in society?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, thank you. Firstly, let me say that the cutting company tax does not 
increase inequality in society. There has been a long trend towards reducing 
company tax right around the world. The biggest cutter of company tax in our 
lifetimes is in fact Paul Keating.

Now we are into the cut throat global competition for capital. And the 
importance of enterprise.

The questioner persists.

Q: There is no requirement on companies to invest in jobs. They could just 
pocket the windfall. So it seems to me to be an experiment at the expense of 
services that Australian taxpayers expect?

Malcolm Turnbull says first up the tax cuts are for small firms. If you don’t 
like the results of the first three years of a re-elected Turnbull government,
you can chuckme out, the prime minister says.

I’m asking for a three year renewal of my government’s job, serving you.
 
The next question is about tax reform: why aren’t we looking at income tax 
reform and GST reform.Malcolm Turnbull says the budget did contain income tax 
changes. On the GST, the case wasn’t made to change anything through the 
distributional analysis.

Malcolm Turnbull:

And that is why we are not touching the GST.

We will not touch the GST. It does not stack up from an equitable 
distributional point of view.
 
Q: Both of the major parties have pledged a return to surplus in 2020, 2021, 
and say their spending promises can be funded. Given treasury forecasts have 
fallen short by billions of dollars, it would seem that future projections are 
unreliable. With this historic reality, it appears a commitment to surplus and 
generous promises are being made on the never, never. Without going far enough 
with necessary spending cuts, are both sides guilty of ignoring economic facts?

Malcolm Turnbull launches a homily on the perils of forecasting. Tricky 
business, forecasting.

Q: We would be sceptical about your promise to come to a surplus then because 
that’s beyond the period of the budget?

Malcolm Turnbull:

No.

Q: It’s a forecast. Isn’t it?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Let me go on.

The prime minister smiles widely when Jones keeps pulling him up before 
launching the sledge, with smile fixed.

Q: I have to jump in here ..

Malcolm Turnbull:

Of course you do. You have to defend the Labor Party, Tony.
