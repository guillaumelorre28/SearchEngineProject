Q I bought my Victorian house a couple of years ago as a "project", but never 
really got round to doing it up. Now I need to move and I want to get a 
professional in to sort it out. Which is the best way to fund this: overdraft, 
short-term loan, or remortgage?

A You could apply to remortgage the house to release equity from it and to 
raise money to pay for the building work. This is possible if your house has 
risen in value since you bought it (very likely given the 15-30 per cent rise 
in house prices over the past couple of years).

Remortgaging is by far the cheapest way to fund your borrowing requirement. 
You will be able to borrow at around 4 per cent - around half the rate of the 
best personal loan on the market. You will then hopefully be able to pay off 
the debt when you sell the house at a profit. Overdrafts are very expensive, 
particularly if you need to borrow a large sum, and you may find that you are 
locked into a loan for a five-year term, which you don't want or need.

 There is, however, one thing to bear in mind if you remortgage - the loan is 
secured against your home, and if you fail to keep up with repayments on your 
new mortgage you will put your property at risk. It is important that when you 
make calculations over how much money you need to borrow you are also realistic 
about your ability to meet the extra monthly mortgage payments. You will not be 
able to remortgage if you house is actually up for sale, so get the financing 
in place and the work done first, and then approach an estate agent once it is 
all complete.
