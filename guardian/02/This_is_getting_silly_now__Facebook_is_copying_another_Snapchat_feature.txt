Facebook has, er, “borrowed” a feature from Snapchat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/snapchat>. Again.

 Facebook has tried to take on Snapchat: two clones of Snapchat Stories, two 
attempted acquisitions, four standalone apps, two ephemeral messaging 
implementations, and three new cameras with AR lenses.

Facebook <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> clearly felt like13 
clone attempts could be unlucky, though, so it raced ahead with its14th attack 
on the ephemeral messaging app: custom geofilters! Except they’re called 
“frames” in Facebook’s implementation because even it has some shame.

Users can the visual frames using nothing more than their graphic design 
skills, then upload them to Facebook for others to discover when they’re in the 
right geographic location. That means a concert venue or sports team could 
offer custom frames for users taking pictures at an event, for example.

The UK is one of the first markets to get access to the custom frames, through 
a feature called the Camera Effects Platform, which is launching in Britain as 
well as Ireland, Colombia, Mexico and Taiwan. Apparently those are the 
countries which currently use Facebook’s normal Frames most often.

One day, there will be no more Snapchat features left for Facebook to clone. 
That day is not here yet.
