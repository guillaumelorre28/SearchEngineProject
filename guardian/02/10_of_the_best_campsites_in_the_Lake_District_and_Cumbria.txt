Syke Farm Camping Ground, Buttermere

Syke Farm is tucked away in a quiet Lake District valley to the south-west of 
Keswick in the tiny hamlet of Buttermere. This is an unpretentious, no-frills 
campsite with an unapologetically back-to-basics approach. Facilities are 
fairly basic – there's no reception or shop, and the only source of provisions 
is the farmhouse in the village offering eggs and milk. The remote location and 
scant facilities almost makes it feel like you've stumbled upon a bygone era – 
but spend a few days relaxing in Buttermere, gazing into the bubbling beck and 
eating too many locally made ice-creams, and you'll begin to understand exactly 
why this campsite is so well-loved.

Fisherground campsite, Eskdale
 Fisherground campsite, Eskdale 
The first thing that meets you on arrival is the pond, often full of children 
playing on tyre rafts – it makes a perfect focal point for kids to get to know 
each other. Nearby, a cool playground has everything adventurous young 
daredevils desire including zip wires, climbing frames and tyre-rope swings. 
And there's an added extra: the campsite sits along the route of the Ravenglass 
and Eskdale steam railway line – an excellent way to arrive if you're coming by 
public transport. Campfires are permitted, with bags of logs, kindling and 
firelighters sold on site.

Chapel House Farm, Stonethwaite 
 Photograph: Cool Camping 
Chapel House Farm campsite may be a simple little place, but the view is 
astonishing, thanks to its position in a single open field in the beautiful 
valley of Borrowdale. Cars are banished to the car park, which seems completely 
fitting in such a pure, pristine location; lugging your kit a short distance to 
the camping area is a small price to pay for that special Lakeland serenity. 
Borrowdale is ringed by the high fells, but the wooded valley also offers miles 
of stress-free river and lake-side strolling, making this one of the most 
appealing locations in the Lake District.

Baysbrown Farm, Ambleside

If you're all "laked-out" and find yourself yearning for some good old dry 
land, then the lake-free Langdale valley is where you'll find it. Sitting 
serenely in the heart of the valley is Baysbrown Farm, which looks out over 
three generously sized camping fields. There are no designated pitches here; 
just rock up and find a suitable corner to call home. The site lies beneath the 
humbling rocks of Crinkle Crags, Bowfell and the Langdale Pikes, giving a sense 
of scale rarely found in the Lakes. Peering out from your tent each morning at 
the mist-shrouded peaks is worth the pitch fee alone.

Gillside Farm, Glenridding

One of the finest views in the Lake District can be enjoyed by standing in the 
shadow of Helvellyn and looking out across Ullswater's valley. Being able to 
relish such scenes from your tent just adds to the experience, making Gillside 
Farm a great place to pitch. Rabbits and sheep roam unfettered and unfazed on 
this working farm, so don't be surprised to be woken by the sound of sheep 
snacking on the tasty grass around your tent. Head to the farmhouse each 
morning to stock up on fresh milk and eggs, or visit the small hut down by the 
walking track for a hearty English breakfast. With its picturesque views and 
easy access to water and walking, Gillside Farm is low-key camping at its 
finest.

Piel Island campsite, Barrow-in-Furness
 Piel Island camping, Cumbria 
Accessible only via ferry (or a mile-and-a-half low-tide walk over the sands 
from Walney Island), Piel Island's 52 acres is home to one medieval castle, one 
pub, one brief terrace of Victorian houses, some grassland, a population of 
"four, sometimes five" and a beach. The view from the island stretches all the 
way from the Lake District hills across Morecambe Bay, and along the Fylde 
Coast to Blackpool Tower. While camping is allowed almost anywhere on the 
island, the "official" campsite is in a slight dip and is further protected by 
shrubs, which help divert the Atlantic winds. Walk back across to Walney Island 
during low tide to explore two nature reserves and the largest colony of lesser 
black-backed and herring gulls in Europe.

Great Langdale National Trust Campsite, Ambleside
 Great Langdale Camping, Cumbria 
Set in a wooded glen at the head of the Great Langdale valley lies this 
glorious campsite, surrounded by impressive peaks and slopes on all sides. It's 
a typical National Trust campsite: well-organised, efficiently run, and set in 
some of England's finest scenery. As you would expect, the walking from here is 
first-class, with many visitors here to conquer the Langdale Pikes, the 
triumvirate of peaks that dominate the skyline. For something a bit less 
challenging, grab a map from reception which outlines four easy walks around 
the valley. Or you could just walk to the pub – there are three within 10 
minutes' walk from the site.

Eden Valley campsite
 Eden Valley camping, Cumbria 
The Eden Valley is Cumbria's forgotten secret. While the Lake District grabs 
all the attention, this glacial valley on the eastern side of the M6 slips 
quietly past the hordes of tourists. The campsite at Kirkoswald is home to just 
six simple pitches, two on a raised area and four down among the trees. Just up 
the road from the main site is a very private wild camping spot, which can be 
reserved by private arrangement. But it's the semi-secret walled garden that's 
the place to be as the sun settles. The lush sandstone of the farm buildings 
glows pink, and Eden Valley will seem like a secret you'll want to keep.

Thirlspot Farm, Thirlmere
 Thirlspot Farm camping, Cumbria 
Thirlspot Farm near Keswick feels like it might just be the perfect campsite. 
One reason for this is its location, surrounded by gorgeous English greenery 
and mighty mountains. Helvellyn, the third-highest peak in England, stands high 
and proud right behind the campsite and there are several different ways to its 
summit from the site, each challenging but manageable. Aside from its scenic 
credentials, Thirlspot also come up trumps in the "proximity-to-pub" stakes 
too, with one of the Lake District's finest traditional coaching inns, the 
King's Head (01768 772393), being directly next door. As we said, perfect.

Gill Head Farm campsite, Troutbeck, Penrith
 Gill Head Farm campsite 
Hidden in a quiet corner of the Lake District national park, Gill Head Farm 
offers space for tents and caravans, as well as B&B accommodation and six 
timber camping pods. The main camping meadow has spectacular views of 
Blencathra, a ridge of six separate fell tops stretching down the valley to 
Keswick. The owners have been thoughtful enough to arrange regular on-site 
activities, games, and bushcraft courses, as well as a log cabin (with TV 
lounge and undercover barbecue area) for communal get-togethers and wet-weather 
relaxation. But Ullswater is less than a 10-minute drive away, so you can head 
to the Lakes where a wealth of hiking, biking, ghyll scrambling and water-based 
activities await.
