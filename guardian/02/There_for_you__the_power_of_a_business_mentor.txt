Business mentors can be crucial for entrepreneurs. People who have been there 
– who can offerpractical advice and emotional support

 when required – can mean the difference between success and failure for many 
companies.

Recent research from software provider Sage 
<http://www.sage.co.uk/business-advice/employing-people/free-guide-to-business-mentoring>
 found that startups without an official mentor were twice as likely to go bust 
within their first five years than those with a business adviser.

“If I hadn’t had mentors, I wouldn’t be here today.” This is what Indra Nooyi, 
one of the most powerful chief executives in the world, hassaid of the advice 
of others

. She has been at the helm of PepsiCo for the past 15 years. “I’m a product of 
great mentoring, great coaching,” she adds.

In the Scale-Up Report of 2014 <http://www.scaleupreport.org>, Sherry Coutu, 
who advises the government on helping fast-growth companies to flourish, said 
mentoring was one of the most effective ways to help entrepreneurs reach their 
potential.

“Access to investor capital, debt and equity finance, leadership skills and 
business mentoring determine whether companies can grow and how fast,” she said.

The value of a sounding board

Just talking through a big decision with someone, whether they have the 
expertise or not, can be invaluable
Paul Lindley 
“Starting a business can be a very lonely place – particularly if you are an 
entrepreneur embarking on the journey alone,” says Paul Lindley, founder and 
chairman ofElla’s Kitchen <http://www.ellaskitchen.co.uk/>, the British 
baby-food brand, and founder of kids’ toiletries firm Paddy’s Bathroom.

“It’s easy to feel that no one understands how much you’re juggling – from the 
challenge of acquiring so many new skills to the pressure of making vital 
decisions on a daily basis,” he says.

“I have found that other entrepreneurs, who understand the struggle of 
building a business from scratch, are often eager to offer support, advice and 
encouragement. Never underestimate how much you can benefit from the experience 
and ideas of the people who’ve done this before you. I found there is huge 
power in building and investing your time in such a network.”

Mentors don’t have to be millionaires or top chief executives, he adds. 
Sometimes entrepreneurs just need a sounding board – someone to help them see a 
problem or opportunity from a different perspective andovercome setbacks

.

“Family and friends can play an absolutely key role,” he says. “Sometimes just 
talking through a big decision with someone, whether they have the expertise or 
not, can be invaluable. I know that I owe much of the success of Ella’s Kitchen 
to the sage counsel and empathetic ear of my wife – right from the early days 
of starting the business at our kitchen table.”

Syed Ahmed, former star of TV show The Apprentice and founder of eco 
technology companySavortex <http://www.savortex.com/>, which manufactures smart 
hand dryers, created his own mentoring group a few years ago, made up of 
several successful entrepreneurs, to help them advise each other and make 
better business decisions.

“The mentoring group acts as a leadership team to me and the company to help 
us avoid potential pitfalls and guide the company to success,” he says.

“This allows me to make decisions based on a collective thought process of 
relevant experiences. Each mentor has overcome challenges and achieved success 
within the critical business areas that matter to our business and market.”

But how do you find the right mentor for your business and how do you 
structure the relationship to bring most value?

There are many ways to find a mentor in the UK. There are portals to help 
match entrepreneurs who have been there with up-and-coming company founders, 
such asmentorsme.co.uk <http://mentorsme.co.uk/>, a free service featuring 
around 30,000 potential mentors.

Charities including The Prince’s Trust <https://www.princes-trust.org.uk/> 
also offer free business mentoring to those who qualify. And there are 
companies offering mentors who are paid for their time. These should not be 
discounted, says Ahmed, because both parties are motivated to achieve results 
if there is a financial incentive.

Lindley’s mentoring relationships have come about through a chance 
introduction or meeting, and through research.

“It’s important for budding entrepreneurs to get out and network – you never 
know who you might meet and how they might be able to support you in the 
future,” he says.

“My experience has shown that people are often more willing to help than you 
might imagine – it’s always worth asking for a meeting or a phone call, even if 
the people in question seem far beyond reach. What’s the worst that can happen?”

Ahmed met his business mentors at networking events or through LinkedIn. 
Alongside real-world mentors, he has two imaginary ones – James Dyson and 
Richard Branson. “I ask them questions from time to time if I’m really stuck,” 
he says. “Both inspire me and have overcome challenges to create hugely 
successful enterprises.

“Based on their relevant business skills, I pose imaginary questions to them. 
Sounds crazy I know, however it really is a creative thought process and very 
helpful. You should try it.”
