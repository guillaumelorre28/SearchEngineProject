Mahrez was also named PFA Player of the Year for his fine form in the 2015-16 
Premier League season, when the midfielder helped inspire Leicester to a first 
Premier League title. The Algerian scored 17 league goals and chipped in with 
11 assists.

He has also been in good form for Claudio Ranieri’s team in the Champions 
League and played a pivotal role in Algeria’s qualification for the Africa Cup 
of Nations next year.

Mahrez, who beat competition from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, André Ayew, Sadio 
Mané and last year’s winner Yaya Touré, told the BBC: “It means a lot, it’s 
something big for African players so I am very happy, I am very proud.

“It’s always good to receive awards and for African players it’s a huge 
honour. To all the fans, thank you very much. I just have to carry on and keep 
going with my football and see what I can do.”
