Beautiful freaks

These cast-iron sculptures by the young artist Nicolas Deshayes are oddly 
beautiful. They cling to the gallery wall like the rococo ribbons and twirling 
flora that encrusted 18th-century ceilings. They ripple, like the Thames water 
they’re named after.

Made you look

They are also emphatically repulsive, suggestive of tree fungi, intestines, 
excrement and other things we don’t like to look at.

So hot right now

Touch their hard, metallic surfaces and you’ll get a surprise. They’re warm, 
like a living thing. They have orifices, through which heated river water is 
piped.

Shine on

Like the post-minimal artist Eva Hesse, Deshayes plays up the tension between 
our porous, friable bodies and the shiny industrial materials that fill our 
lives.

City limits

Cast iron is a major element in London’s bone structure, sprawling outwards 
from the river that runs through it: everything from lampposts to the manhole 
covers branded with Thames Water, beneath which the sewers flow.
