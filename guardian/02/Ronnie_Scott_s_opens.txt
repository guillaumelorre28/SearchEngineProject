An East End Londoner, Ronnie Scott was a UK jazz star in the 1950s, playing 
tenor sax with an assurance that rivalled the dominant Americans. But he 
dreamed of a London jazz club like those on New York's 52nd Street, which he'd 
visited as a dance band player on the transatlantic liners. In October 1959, he 
and former sax partner Pete King launched Ronnie Scott's in a Chinatown 
basement. The club – now elsewhere in Soho but still going strong – was to host 
the biggest jazz stars, from Ella Fitzgerald to Sonny Rollins.
