1 The tattoo

Blake Lively <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0515116/>'s arm is strewn with images 
of butterflies on barbed wire. What could this mean? That she's an irresistible 
mixture of delicate and dangerous? That her barbed wire factory was in the 
middle of a honeysuckle meadow? That she has terrible taste in tattoos?

2 Benicio's blade

Benicio Del Toro <https://www.theguardian.com/film/beniciodeltoro> plays a 
violent member of a Mexican drug cartel, but the close cropping of these photos 
makes it impossible to tell how long his blade is. It might be a dagger, or a 
full-on Zorro sword, or it might even be a bespoke 30ft knife that Benicio 
spends the film staggering beneath like a beleaguered caber-tosser. Hopefully 
it's that.

3 Typographical rocket

The "AVA" in "Savages" has been deliberately set to look like a space rocket. 
Could this mean thatOliver Stone <https://www.theguardian.com/film/oliver-stone>
 has adapted Don Winslow's book to add a subplot about the end of Nasa's manned 
space programme? On the other hand, it also looks like one of those fancy 
Philippe Starck juicers. Maybe everyone just drinks a lot of juice.

4 Travolta's hairline

The cropping of John Travolta right below his hairline is the biggest tease. 
What's he going to sport in the film? AGrease

5 What certificate?

"This film is not yet rated" – but that probably doesn't matter. Desert 
heists, scars, swords, scythes, drug dealers, a skeleton holding a gun – from 
the look of this poster, it's probably going to be a U certificate. Or a PG, 
for its scenes of mild peril.

6 Vertical lettering

Notice how each letter of "Savages" corresponds with a separate image. It'd 
make sense to assume that there's more to this than meets the eye. Perhaps the 
"S" in the first image signifies the sand in the picture. And the "A" represents
Taylor Kitsch <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2018237/>'s attitude. "V" obviously 
stands for "very hairy" while the next "A" means "alive?" and the "G" stands 
for "gun". Then there's "E", which stands for "extremely well-groomed" and S, 
which everyone knows stands for "Shout",the 1991 film 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102913/> in which John Travolta played an 
inspirational music teacher. See? Simple.
