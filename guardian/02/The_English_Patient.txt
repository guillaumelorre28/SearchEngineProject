The Academy judges fell for Minghella's epic love story, awarding it nine 
Oscars in 1997.

Adapted from the Booker-winning novel by Michael Ondaatje, it stars Ralph 
Fiennes as a Hungarian count, critically injured at the end of the second world 
war, who retells the story of his doomed affair with an Englishwoman (Kristin 
Scott-Thomas) in prewar North Africa. John Seale's stunning photography of the 
African desert contributes to the mood of sweeping romance.
