Nighty night

Goodness, that’s enough of Monday, with all the usual thanks and salutations. 
Let’s draw the curtains by noting the eventualities of the day.

We can do this fairly simply. Today was meant to be manufacturing day, but for 
the government it evolved into exploding candidate day, and for Labor it 
evolved into penalty rates day, because ... campaigns.

Have a great evening. See you again in the morning.

James Massola from Fairfax Media has been pursuing 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/election-2016-unions-turn-on-shorten-as-labor-leader-concedes-he-cant-guarantee-penalty-rates-wont-be-cut-under-alp-20160516-gow7p0.html?rand=1283189#ixzz48nj9D9OQ>
 the penalty rates issue over the afternoon. From his news report it seems he’s 
rung ten unions for comment aboutBill Shorten not signing up to the Greens 
position, which is legislating to protect penalty rates. Eight are saying 
nothing. Two, the AMWU and the ETU, are saying penalty rates need to be 
protected by any means necessary. Just worth mentioning I think, the ETU has in 
recent times supported the Greens and made donations to the party. The CFMEU 
has also made donations to the Greens. I’m not sure whether the AMWU has or 
not. Obviously trade unions kick in to Labor’s campaigns as well.

I’ve enjoyed a brief dive down into the thread. Looks like everyone had a good

Good podcasts for politics junkies

On my Facebook forum <https://www.facebook.com/murphy.katharine/> on the 
weekend I plugged some politics podcasts that have sprung up for the election 
season.

 * In case you missed it, my colleague Lenore Taylor and I are doing a weekly 
pod during the campaign calledAustralian Politics Live. It’s done quite well 
over this past weekend, which we are grateful for. If you’ve missed it and want 
to tune in for episode one, and then subscribe,you can find us on iTunes here 
<https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/australian-politics-live/id1109943717>.

 * In addition you can find Paula Matthewson and Margo Kingston talking 
campaigns and policy atPidgin Politics 
<http://omnyapp.com/…/turnbull-calls-the-2016-election-and-w…>.

 * You can find the dynamic News Corp duo of Mal Farr and Dennis Atkins at Two 
Grumpy Hacks <https://soundcloud.com/…/episode-2-excuse-me-dennis-your-ph…>.

 * Michelle Grattan of The Conversation has her latest podcast episode here 
<https://theconversation.com/election-podcast-the-battle-for-new-england-59470> 
– this week she looks at the battle for the seat of New England.

 * Patricia Karvelas and Fran Kelly of ABC Radio National have their venture, 
theParty Room, here. <http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/partyroom/> 
I haven’t had a chance to listen to that yet but given the talent I’m sure it’s 
good.

 * Also a regular Guardian Australia podcast, Behind the Lines, is also 
venturing into the campaign.You can find that here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/may/16/women-in-politics-in-a-world-ruled-by-middle-aged-white-men-behind-the-lines-podcast>
. It featuresBridie Jabour, Gabrielle Jackson and Kristina Keneally.

There’ll be others. I’ll keep you posted as I make discoveries. Enjoy.

The brilliance of an elephant kicking Bambi

I’ve mentioned a couple of times today that the immigration minister Peter 
Dutton went the full beat down on Labor’s deputy leader Tanya Plibersek in 
Brisbane earlier. I breezed over the specifics in real time because several 
things were happening at once. I’ll post a portion now so you see I wasn’t 
making it up.

Peter Dutton:

I would love for Tanya Plibersek to be here every day until election day 
because she’s in a Greens seat, inner-city seat inSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>. She’s on a family income 
of $800,000 a year. I would love to know what she has in common with the people 
of Kallangur or Bray Park or Strathpine.

Some silvertail like Ms Plibersek who is by Mr Carr, by his own advice, a 
two-faced person when it comes to important policies, I think she should talk 
to the people of Dickson about her policy on boats.

Why is Ms Plibersek opposed to Bill Shorten? Why does she white ant him from 
behind the scenes? This civil war within the Labor party is now taking place at 
the highest ranks and Ms Plibersek should answer the very fundamental question 
today of why she doesn’t support turning back boats where it’s safe to do so. 
She said as much to Fran Kelly in an interview on the ABC that she was opposed 
to turn backs and that she would only do it where it was absolutely necessary. 
Well the people smugglers would take that as manna from heaven. They want weak 
leadership. She saw it in Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard and they see weak 
leadership now in Tanya Plibersek andBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten>.

(I would have thought a boofy character like PDudds kicking Plibersek in such 
personal terms would be about as popular as a lumbering elephant kicking Bambi, 
but maybe I’m missing the devastatingly brilliant politics of this.)

From BaldwinP in the thread on the other issue of the day – penalty rates.

The Greens care so much about penalty rates they haven’t put a submission in 
to the Fair Work Commission (
https://www.fwc.gov.au/awards-and-agreements/modern-award-reviews/penalty-rates-case/submissions
 
<https://www.fwc.gov.au/awards-and-agreements/modern-award-reviews/penalty-rates-case/submissions>
)

Maybe journalists could try reading even the first couple of pages of the 
ALP’s submission if they want a hitlist of quotes from Turnbull and co 
advocating for the destruction of penalty rates, rather than pretending it’s not
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> policy just 
because they don’t admit to it.


https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/sites/awardsmodernfouryr/AM2014305-sub-FOS-210316.pdf
 
<https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/sites/awardsmodernfouryr/AM2014305-sub-FOS-210316.pdf>
 to spare you the difficulty of finding the submission yourself.

Utterly reasonable point to note the Greens did not make a submission to the 
Fair Work Commission on penalty rates. So noted. So shared. This omission of 
process could be used to underscore the point that today was as much about 
politics as it was about policy, but then I think I’ve already made that clear 
in my analysis through the day.

As to the other points, I don’t need to re-read the Labor submission, I know 
there are members of the Coalition who support the abolition of penalty rates, 
a number of them. I know that business groups support that too. I’ve already 
pointed to that fact that Coalition folks are anti-penalty rates on the blog 
today. But until such time abolishing penalty rates becomes Coalition policy, 
these folks are just expressing views, not articulating policy. Lots of Labor 
folks have views on things that aren’t Labor policy either, doesn’t mean Labor 
has a secret policy on X, Y or Z.

Of course political parties are very capable of saying one thing before an 
election but another thing after it, which I imagine is your point?

Crikey’s political editor Bernard Keane is very good on the mutual tub 
thumping today. Crikey subscribers can read himhere 
<http://www.crikey.com.au/2016/05/16/bow-great-god-manufacturing/#loggedin>. 
Keane points out that there is no prospect of keeping Australia a manufacturing 
powerhouse because we haven’t been one since 2006.

Now [manufacturing] employs just above 7% of Australian workers, and falling — 
fast. It’s now only the sixth largest employer of Australians. If you want a 
powerhouse, try health and caring services, which employ 13% of all workers, or 
the services sector — nearly 9% — or construction, 9%. Or even retail — just 
under 11%. Or mining, which hardly employs anyone but generates tens of 
billions a year in export revenue, or education, which generates nearly $20bn 
in export revenue. These are our economic powerhouses.

But manufacturing is a powerhouse inside Labor. The AMWU and the AWU are 
influential unions and sources of funding for Labor.

And for all of Malcolm Turnbull’s rhetoric about agility and innovation, the 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> isn’t immune 
from this nonsense. The current government started life promising a 
refreshingly rational approach to economic policy, under which multinational 
parasites like the big car companies wouldn’t simply get handouts to prop up 
local manufacturing, and the massive cost of buying a new generation of Royal 
Australian Navy submarines wouldn’t be bloated by building them locally.

Sadly, electoral pressures saw that approach abandoned, to be replaced, under 
Malcolm Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull>, 
with full-blown defence protectionism under which we’ll be spending tens of 
billions of dollars more on defence procurement in order to employ a few 
thousand manufacturing workers locally.

To the government’s announcement now. This from this morning’s press release 
from the prime minister.

A re-elected Turnbull government will use Australian steel to build the first 
fleet of naval vessels commissioned in Australia since 2007.

The $282m contract was signed on May 5 with Austal for its shipyard in 
Henderson, Western Australia, to replace the existing Pacific Patrol Boat fleet 
and is part of Australia’s new Pacific Maritime Security Program.

The contract to build and sustain 19 steel-hulled vessels will create over 120 
jobs and secure Henderson as core to the re-elected Turnbull Coalition’s plan 
for jobs and growth.

Austal will use Australian high-tensile steel to build the Pacific Patrol 
Boats – reinforcing our commitment to Australian built ships, by Australian 
workers and with Australian steel.

The Turnbull government is committed to maximising Australian industry across 
this project and all of our naval shipbuilding projects.

I’ve said quite a bit recently that economic nationalism is seriously in vogue 
this election cycle. Both parties are firmly in #Straya #M8 tub thumping mode, 
it’s just their accompanying stories vary.

The government accompanies its tub thumping with a serve of trickle down 
economics – which really is an odd combo, but if we start getting into the 
fundamental oddness ofAustralian politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics> that’s a 
ravine we never climb out of. Labor for its part is tub thumping with serve of 
investing for growth by investing in social capital, like education and 
hospitals.

The main question I’d have about today’s building ships with Australian steel 
announcement is how much will this commitment add to the bottom line of this 
project?

I suspect it is more expensive to build Australian ships with Australian 
steel. I suspect taxpayers will wear that one in the end.

Now that it’s a bit quieter and we are free of tactics, exploding candidates 
and the rest I can back track on the policies announced today.

Labor has promised $58.6m over the forward estimates to support automotive 
industry workers. This from the policy document 
<http://www.100positivepolicies.org.au/manufacturing_transition_boost_fact_sheet>
. “Funding of $10.5m will boost existing automotive businesses to develop and 
implement plans to plug into new supply chains, bring new products to market 
and improve productivity. A further commitment of $48.1m will promote broader 
advanced manufacturing and related job opportunities and investment. Rather 
than duplicate programs at the state and federal level, Labor will leverage the 
work already done by the states and supplement existing state programs, both by 
increasing the resources these programs can draw on and by expanding their 
scope.”

Reading the policy document it’s clear this money is for both Victoria and 
South Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia> 
for automotive industry transition, with a little bit of money also for NSW and 
Queensland. The document also identifies funding for specific areas in Victoria.

 * North Melbourne $10.6m

 * South East Melbourne $10.0m

 * West Melbourne $5.0m

 * Geelong $7.5m

The Green senator Sarah Hanson-Young has now stopped in to the Sky studios 
after appearing in Melbourne with the leadership in Melbourne Ports earlier 
today. She’s being asked about Labor’s clear declarations over the past few 
days about not forming another minority government with the Greens in the event 
of another hung parliament. Is this for real, she’s asked.

Sarah Hanson-Young:

When the rubber hits the road, wiser heads will prevail.

Goodness, that’s enough of Monday, with all the usual thanks and salutations. 
Let’s draw the curtains by noting the eventualities of the day.

We can do this fairly simply. Today was meant to be manufacturing day, but for 
the government it evolved into exploding candidate day, and for Labor it 
evolved into penalty rates day, because ... campaigns.

Have a great evening. See you again in the morning.
 
James Massola from Fairfax Media has been pursuing 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/election-2016-unions-turn-on-shorten-as-labor-leader-concedes-he-cant-guarantee-penalty-rates-wont-be-cut-under-alp-20160516-gow7p0.html?rand=1283189#ixzz48nj9D9OQ>
 the penalty rates issue over the afternoon. From his news report it seems he’s 
rung ten unions for comment aboutBill Shorten not signing up to the Greens 
position, which is legislating to protect penalty rates. Eight are saying 
nothing. Two, the AMWU and the ETU, are saying penalty rates need to be 
protected by any means necessary. Just worth mentioning I think, the ETU has in 
recent times supported the Greens and made donations to the party. The CFMEU 
has also made donations to the Greens. I’m not sure whether the AMWU has or 
not. Obviously trade unions kick in to Labor’s campaigns as well.
 
I’ve enjoyed a brief dive down into the thread. Looks like everyone had a good 
rest over the weekend.
 
On my Facebook forum <https://www.facebook.com/murphy.katharine/> on the 
weekend I plugged some politics podcasts that have sprung up for the election 
season.

 * In case you missed it, my colleague Lenore Taylor and I are doing a weekly 
pod during the campaign calledAustralian Politics Live. It’s done quite well 
over this past weekend, which we are grateful for. If you’ve missed it and want 
to tune in for episode one, and then subscribe,you can find us on iTunes here 
<https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/australian-politics-live/id1109943717>.

 * In addition you can find Paula Matthewson and Margo Kingston talking 
campaigns and policy atPidgin Politics 
<http://omnyapp.com/…/turnbull-calls-the-2016-election-and-w…>.

 * You can find the dynamic News Corp duo of Mal Farr and Dennis Atkins at Two 
Grumpy Hacks <https://soundcloud.com/…/episode-2-excuse-me-dennis-your-ph…>.

 * Michelle Grattan of The Conversation has her latest podcast episode here 
<https://theconversation.com/election-podcast-the-battle-for-new-england-59470> 
– this week she looks at the battle for the seat of New England.

 * Patricia Karvelas and Fran Kelly of ABC Radio National have their venture, 
theParty Room, here. <http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/partyroom/> 
I haven’t had a chance to listen to that yet but given the talent I’m sure it’s 
good.

 * Also a regular Guardian Australia podcast, Behind the Lines, is also 
venturing into the campaign.You can find that here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/may/16/women-in-politics-in-a-world-ruled-by-middle-aged-white-men-behind-the-lines-podcast>
. It featuresBridie Jabour, Gabrielle Jackson and Kristina Keneally.

There’ll be others. I’ll keep you posted as I make discoveries. Enjoy.
 
Still going. Bantering.

No, reverse ferret. Labor’s Sam Dastyari is protesting. Whether protesting or 
protesting too much remains to be seen.

Let’s talk Malcolm and Tony at the campaign launch.
 
I’ve mentioned a couple of times today that the immigration minister Peter 
Dutton went the full beat down on Labor’s deputy leader Tanya Plibersek in 
Brisbane earlier. I breezed over the specifics in real time because several 
things were happening at once. I’ll post a portion now so you see I wasn’t 
making it up.

Peter Dutton:

I would love for Tanya Plibersek to be here every day until election day 
because she’s in a Greens seat, inner-city seat inSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>. She’s on a family income 
of $800,000 a year. I would love to know what she has in common with the people 
of Kallangur or Bray Park or Strathpine.

Some silvertail like Ms Plibersek who is by Mr Carr, by his own advice, a 
two-faced person when it comes to important policies, I think she should talk 
to the people of Dickson about her policy on boats.

Why is Ms Plibersek opposed to Bill Shorten? Why does she white ant him from 
behind the scenes? This civil war within the Labor party is now taking place at 
the highest ranks and Ms Plibersek should answer the very fundamental question 
today of why she doesn’t support turning back boats where it’s safe to do so. 
She said as much to Fran Kelly in an interview on the ABC that she was opposed 
to turn backs and that she would only do it where it was absolutely necessary. 
Well the people smugglers would take that as manna from heaven. They want weak 
leadership. She saw it in Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard and they see weak 
leadership now in Tanya Plibersek andBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten>.

(I would have thought a boofy character like PDudds kicking Plibersek in such 
personal terms would be about as popular as a lumbering elephant kicking Bambi, 
but maybe I’m missing the devastatingly brilliant politics of this.)
 
From BaldwinP in the thread on the other issue of the day – penalty rates.

The Greens care so much about penalty rates they haven’t put a submission in 
to the Fair Work Commission (
https://www.fwc.gov.au/awards-and-agreements/modern-award-reviews/penalty-rates-case/submissions
 
<https://www.fwc.gov.au/awards-and-agreements/modern-award-reviews/penalty-rates-case/submissions>
)

Maybe journalists could try reading even the first couple of pages of the 
ALP’s submission if they want a hitlist of quotes from Turnbull and co 
advocating for the destruction of penalty rates, rather than pretending it’s not
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> policy just 
because they don’t admit to it.

<https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/sites/awardsmodernfouryr/AM2014305-sub-FOS-210316.pdf>
 to spare you the difficulty of finding the submission yourself.

Utterly reasonable point to note the Greens did not make a submission to the 
Fair Work Commission on penalty rates. So noted. So shared. This omission of 
process could be used to underscore the point that today was as much about 
politics as it was about policy, but then I think I’ve already made that clear 
in my analysis through the day.

As to the other points, I don’t need to re-read the Labor submission, I know 
there are members of the Coalition who support the abolition of penalty rates, 
a number of them. I know that business groups support that too. I’ve already 
pointed to that fact that Coalition folks are anti-penalty rates on the blog 
today. But until such time abolishing penalty rates becomes Coalition policy, 
these folks are just expressing views, not articulating policy. Lots of Labor 
folks have views on things that aren’t Labor policy either, doesn’t mean Labor 
has a secret policy on X, Y or Z.

Of course political parties are very capable of saying one thing before an 
election but another thing after it, which I imagine is your point?

 
Crikey’s political editor Bernard Keane is very good on the mutual tub 
thumping today. Crikey subscribers can read himhere 
<http://www.crikey.com.au/2016/05/16/bow-great-god-manufacturing/#loggedin>. 
Keane points out that there is no prospect of keeping Australia a manufacturing 
powerhouse because we haven’t been one since 2006.

Now [manufacturing] employs just above 7% of Australian workers, and falling — 
fast. It’s now only the sixth largest employer of Australians. If you want a 
powerhouse, try health and caring services, which employ 13% of all workers, or 
the services sector — nearly 9% — or construction, 9%. Or even retail — just 
under 11%. Or mining, which hardly employs anyone but generates tens of 
billions a year in export revenue, or education, which generates nearly $20bn 
in export revenue. These are our economic powerhouses.

But manufacturing is a powerhouse inside Labor. The AMWU and the AWU are 
influential unions and sources of funding for Labor.

And for all of Malcolm Turnbull’s rhetoric about agility and innovation, the 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> isn’t immune 
from this nonsense. The current government started life promising a 
refreshingly rational approach to economic policy, under which multinational 
parasites like the big car companies wouldn’t simply get handouts to prop up 
local manufacturing, and the massive cost of buying a new generation of Royal 
Australian Navy submarines wouldn’t be bloated by building them locally.

Sadly, electoral pressures saw that approach abandoned, to be replaced, under 
Malcolm Turnbull <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull>, 
with full-blown defence protectionism under which we’ll be spending tens of 
billions of dollars more on defence procurement in order to employ a few 
thousand manufacturing workers locally.
 
To the government’s announcement now. This from this morning’s press release 
from the prime minister.

A re-elected Turnbull government will use Australian steel to build the first 
fleet of naval vessels commissioned in Australia since 2007.

The $282m contract was signed on May 5 with Austal for its shipyard in 
Henderson, Western Australia, to replace the existing Pacific Patrol Boat fleet 
and is part of Australia’s new Pacific Maritime Security Program.

The contract to build and sustain 19 steel-hulled vessels will create over 120 
jobs and secure Henderson as core to the re-elected Turnbull Coalition’s plan 
for jobs and growth.

Austal will use Australian high-tensile steel to build the Pacific Patrol 
Boats – reinforcing our commitment to Australian built ships, by Australian 
workers and with Australian steel.

The Turnbull government is committed to maximising Australian industry across 
this project and all of our naval shipbuilding projects.

I’ve said quite a bit recently that economic nationalism is seriously in vogue 
this election cycle. Both parties are firmly in #Straya #M8 tub thumping mode, 
it’s just their accompanying stories vary.

The government accompanies its tub thumping with a serve of trickle down 
economics – which really is an odd combo, but if we start getting into the 
fundamental oddness ofAustralian politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics> that’s a 
ravine we never climb out of. Labor for its part is tub thumping with serve of 
investing for growth by investing in social capital, like education and 
hospitals.

The main question I’d have about today’s building ships with Australian steel 
announcement is how much will this commitment add to the bottom line of this 
project?

I suspect it is more expensive to build Australian ships with Australian 
steel. I suspect taxpayers will wear that one in the end.
 
Now that it’s a bit quieter and we are free of tactics, exploding candidates 
and the rest I can back track on the policies announced today.

Labor has promised $58.6m over the forward estimates to support automotive 
industry workers. This from the policy document 
<http://www.100positivepolicies.org.au/manufacturing_transition_boost_fact_sheet>
. “Funding of $10.5m will boost existing automotive businesses to develop and 
implement plans to plug into new supply chains, bring new products to market 
and improve productivity. A further commitment of $48.1m will promote broader 
advanced manufacturing and related job opportunities and investment. Rather 
than duplicate programs at the state and federal level, Labor will leverage the 
work already done by the states and supplement existing state programs, both by 
increasing the resources these programs can draw on and by expanding their 
scope.”

Reading the policy document it’s clear this money is for both Victoria and 
South Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia> 
for automotive industry transition, with a little bit of money also for NSW and 
Queensland. The document also identifies funding for specific areas in Victoria.

 * North Melbourne $10.6m

 * South East Melbourne $10.0m

 * West Melbourne $5.0m

 * Geelong $7.5m

The Green senator Sarah Hanson-Young has now stopped in to the Sky studios 
after appearing in Melbourne with the leadership in Melbourne Ports earlier 
today. She’s being asked about Labor’s clear declarations over the past few 
days about not forming another minority government with the Greens in the event 
of another hung parliament. Is this for real, she’s asked.

Sarah Hanson-Young:

When the rubber hits the road, wiser heads will prevail.
