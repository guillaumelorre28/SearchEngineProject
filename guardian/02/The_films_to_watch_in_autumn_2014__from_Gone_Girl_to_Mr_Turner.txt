Pride <https://www.theguardian.com/film/pride>

This rousing film from Matthew Warchus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/matthew-warchus> is about the help that gay 
campaigners gave to miners during the strike of 1984-85. It shows how the 
activists broke out of their parochial attitude while mining communities 
questioned their sexual politics, and it makes a bold case that the strike was 
not a Light Brigade charge into oblivion, but a triumphant spur to gay rights 
and human rights generally. Great performances fromBill Nighy

A Most Wanted Man

Philip Seymour Hoffman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/philipseymourhoffman> 
managed what would prove to be a potent, bittersweet swansong in Anton 
Corbijn’s pungent adaptation of the John le Carré thriller. Cigarette in one 
hand, glass of scotch in the other, he stars as Günther Bachmann, the crumpled, 
committed frontman of German intelligence. His air of thunderous gloom pervades 
the entire film like tobacco smoke.Xan Brooks

The Riot Club

Big-screen adaptation of Laura Wade’s play Posh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/may/23/posh-duke-yorks-review-billington>
, about a fictionalised Bullingdon Club, starring up-and-comers Max Irons, 
Douglas Booth, Freddie Fox and Sam Claflin. The danger is that the movie might 
glamorise the leads more than a stage version could – and turn a satire into a 
romance (director Lone Scherfig’s last film wasOne Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141706/one-day>) – but the trailer 
suggests the material is still drawing blood, however rich the matinee gloss.

20,000 Days on Earth <https://www.theguardian.com/film/20-000-days-on-earth>

This quasi-doc self-portrait by Nick Cave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/nick-cave> has startled and entertained 
audiences. It is a picture of Cave on the occasion of his 20,000th day on 
earth, giving a view of his artistic impulses, his friends, his collagues, his 
opinions, his worldview and most importantly, his music. What we get is not 
exactly a snapshot of Cave as he is, nor precisely a day in the life of a rock 
star, but a guide to Cave’s sense of his imaginary and creative self. We see 
him talking to an analyst and also interviewingKylie Minogue 
<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.theguardian.com/music/kylieminogue&sa=U&ei=eFYEVNr5LJPiasnrgdgE&ved=0CAUQFjAA&client=internal-uds-cse&usg=AFQjCNGf_G87iZnN4K2qxen5gHynmxRQHQ>

strapped and steps into the old Edward Woodward role as a justice-obsessed 
former special-ops guy, now out on the street and on a mission to straighten

everymannishness. The director is Antoine Fuqua, who called the shots on 
Washington’s Oscar-winner Training Day, so a superior product is more than

Effie Gray

After getting stuck in legal wrangles, this Emma Thompson-scripted paean to 
celebrated socialite and artists’ model Effie Gray is finally nearing release. 
Dakota Fanning plays Gray – the woman who left critic John Ruskin for painter 
John Everett Millais after establishing her husband was “disgusted with my 
person” – while Thompson plays her friend and confidante Lady Eastlake. 
Thompson’s screenwriting chops were definitively proved by her Oscar-winning 
adaptation of Sense and Sensibility; this darker-sounding study of emotional 
entanglements ought to bring out her best.AP

Jimi: All Is By My Side

12 Years a Slave screenwriter John Ridley hammers out a squalling pre-fame 
biopic of Jimi Hendrix – a twisty, mercurial take on the early days of a rock 
god. There’s none of Hendrix’s music (the estate said no) and it’s factually 
dubious (Kathy Etchingham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/05/kathy-etchingham-hendrix-all-is-by-my-side>
, Jimi’s ex, called it “inaccurate and nonsensical”), but it’s compelling for 
all its flaws. Outkast’s André Benjamin does a decent Jimi, while Imogen Poots 
is on career-high form as Linda Keith, the Vogue model turned talent scout who 
helped introduce Jimi to the UK.Henry Barnes

This Is Where I Leave You

Jonathan Trotter has written four popular novels of moderate family 
dysfunction. This, the first he has adapted for the screen, starsJane Fonda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jun/03/features> as a grieving widow and 
celebrity psychologist and the likes ofTina Fey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tina-fey>, Jason Bateman and Adam 
Driver as the errant children who return home to sit shiva for a week. Secrets 
will out, slapstick will happen, bittersweetness will be served. Look out for 
Rose Byrne, one of the most charming female leads around at the moment, in a 
supporting role.CS

David Ayer, writer-director of brocentric LA cop drama End of Watch, gets more 
macho with a tank movie starring Brad Pitt as “Wardaddy”, the jarhead commander 
of a renegade bunch of soldiers fighting the Germans at the scraggy end of the 
second world war. The trailer shows Pitt and co blowing up, stabbing and 
shooting the enemy, yet Ayer – a US Navy veteran – has promised a thoughtful 
treatise on the corrupting influence of war on the individual. It’ll be buried 
in the rumble there somewhere.HB

An unlikely sounding thriller: Jake Gyllenhaal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jake-gyllenhaal> plays a videojournalist who 
joins the pack hunting for sellable crime footage in Los Angeles – the kind of 
ghouls who hang about waiting for something nasty to happen so they can film 
it. Bill Paxton, Rene Russo and Four Lions’ Riz Ahmed are along for the ride, 
with script and direction from Dan Gilroy, brother of the slightly better-known 
Tony (Michael Clayton, The Bourne Legacy). Gyllenhaal apparently lost quite a 
bit of weight for the role, though perhaps not to a McConaughey-esque extent.AP

Get on Up

Hollywood has been trying to make a biopic of soul legend James Brown for 
years, and this one finally got there. Brits Jez and John-Henry Butterworth 
wrote the script, Mick Jagger is one of the producers, The Help’s Tate Taylor 
got the nod to direct, and Chadwick Boseman, fresh from playing Jackie Robinson 
in 42, nabbed the lead role. It’s already been and gone in the US, with largely 
positive reviews giving particular respect to Boseman – our critic, Tom Shone, 
called it “one of the year’s truly outstanding performances 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/01/get-on-up-review-james-brown-biopic>
”. With a soundtrack of live Brown performances, they could hardly go wrong.AP
