Your report of the prime minister’s speech in Bahrain (Theresa May calls on 
Gulf leaders to press on with economic reforms 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/07/theresa-may-calls-on-gulf-leaders-to-press-on-with-economic-reforms>
, theguardian.com, 7 December) quoted her support for the Iran nuclear deal and 
went on that she said the UK remained “clear-eyed” about Iran’s threat to the 
stability of the Middle East. You did not quote the words that followed: 
“But we must also work together to push back against Iran’s aggressive regional 
actions, whether in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Syria or in the Gulf itself.”

What aggressive actions? In Syria Hezbollah and some Iranian “military 
advisers”, not numerous, have been backing the Syrian government, which may be 
bad but is hardly aggression. In Yemen there have been many reports of Iranian 
arms smuggled to the Houthi rebels, some of them quite convincing, and there 
may be more intelligence, but not to be compared to Saudi actions including 
reported war crimes using British material. InIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>, Iran is taking part in action against 
Isis in Mosul alongside the Iraqi government and the US-led coalition.

These accusations, and more on Lebanon, Bahrain, Iranian naval operations in 
the Straits of Hormuz etc, are common currency in the Saudi-aligned parts of 
the Arab world and in the US. Theresa May’s words look too much like pandering 
to their obsessive confrontation withIran
