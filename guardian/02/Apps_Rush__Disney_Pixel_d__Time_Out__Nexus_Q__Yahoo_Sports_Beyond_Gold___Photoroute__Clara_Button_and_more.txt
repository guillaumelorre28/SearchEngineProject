Pixel'd <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pixeld/id529626244?mt=8>

This is Disney's latest iOS app, and perhaps its most intriguing yet. It's a 
pixel-art app where you create images, including using stamps of Disney 
characters from Mickey Mouse through to Cars. These can be animated over 20 
frames, and shared on various social networks.

Time Out London for iPad 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/time-out-london-for-ipad/id545945632?mt=8>

Earlier this year, Time Out launched a whizzy new iPad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad> app for New York: less about 
presenting the pages of its magazine, and more about a city guide for 
restaurants and tourist hotspots. Now London is getting the same treatment, 
with editors' picks and personalisation features to learn from your preferences 
over time.
iPad

Nexus Q 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.setupwarlock>

As Google's Nexus Q home entertainment device starts to ship in the US, its 
official app should pick up some download steam. Once installed, it enables
Android <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android> users to stream music 
and video from the separate Google Play and YouTube apps to the device, and 
thus onto speakers and screens around the home.
Android

Yahoo! Sports Beyond Gold 2012 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yahoo!-sports-beyond-gold/id542448158?mt=8>

Yahoo's latest iOS app launches just in time for the Olympic Games, promising 
news, results, medal counts, photos and other content. It includes the ability 
to drill down by specific sport.
iPhone / iPad

Photoroute <http://www.photoroute.com/>

This is a really good idea: an app from Enabled City for "accessible, editable 
route maps" in London, aimed at people with physical and learning disabilities, 
as well as people speaking English as a second language. That means step-free 
routes for people using wheelchairs, and photos taken along each route to aid 
navigation.
Android / iPhone

Clara Button and the Magical Hat Day 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/clara-button-magical-hat-day/id543867176>

Clara Button started life in a printed book published by the Victoria & Albert 
Museum in London. Now the V&A has taken her digital, working with developer 
MAPP Editions on this iPad book-app. The story is set in the V&A itself, with 
lovely illustrations and lots of interactivity for children.
iPad

Beat Geek <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/beat-geek/id528361985?mt=8>

Digital music startup TuneWiki has launched a new mobile game, Beat Geek, 
which aims to test the trivia knowledge of music fans around the world. It's a 
freemium title that sees you competing against friends and other players, with 
power-ups to provide a leg-up. The App Store listing alludes to cross-platform 
play against Android, so expect a version for Google-powered devices soon too.
iPhone / iPad

Asphalt 7: Heat 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA7HM>

Gameloft's racing franchise has a long history on mobile phones, with its 
seventh incarnation now available for Android. There are more than 60 cars, 15 
tracks around the world, and a choice of online or local multiplayer.
Android

Bar Fight Live <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bar-fight-live/id536515949?mt=8>

Developer Kempt is billing this as "the world's first crowd-sourced, live app 
development", which means players get to provide feedback on how the game 
should evolve from within the app itself. "The game will star legendary 
Hollywood hero Stunt Guy. It'll be about a fight… in a bar. Beyond that – we 
don't know!"
iPhone / iPad

NHM Evolution <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/nhm-evolution/id531682298?mt=8>

The Natural History Museum in London has debuted an iPad app crunching in 
750MB of content from the last 600 million years of life on Earth. Not just 
dinosaurs, although they're understandably part of the mix. The book-app 
includes data and images on 100 key fossil sites and more than 800 creatures 
and plants.
iPad

Marie Claire Runway A/W/12 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/marie-claire-runway-a-w-12/id530078926?mt=8>

IPC Media's Marie Claire magazine has released its latest fashion app, which 
edits together animation and video from 10 fashion shows in New York, London, 
Milan and Paris showing off clothing for the coming season – complete with 
editors' thoughts on the key clobber.
iPad

Mumderground <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mumderground/id541375326?mt=8>

File this alongside Photoroute when it comes to accessible London travelling, 
although the target audience here is different: mums. It's a journey-planning 
app for the tube to help people choose stations that are more 
pushchair-friendly. Although someone should tell the developer that dads take 
children around London too...
iPhone

Relevance <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/relevance/id541057001?mt=8>

Relevance is the latest mobile app looking to bring more, well, relevance to 
Twitter and Facebook feeds. It promises to analyse your social graph to make 
sure it serves up the tweets and status updates that will be most interesting 
to you, including using data on your actions and reading to refine its 
algorithm.
iPhone

City of Secrets 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.aidemmedia.CityOfSecrets>

"Want to see my Mole?" asks the Google Play listing for City of Secrets. Well, 
that's quite an offer. But this is actually a game about a mole – Mr Moles, in 
fact – who stars in a point-and-click adventure game promising "revolution, 
mystery, and adventure".
Android

Domestos <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/domestos/id541514761?mt=8>

As branded iPad games go, this may take some beating. "Play the germ buster 
game to destroy those 'menacing nasties' that lurk in your home and learn about 
the benefits of Domestos over thin bleach."
iPad

Clarks Kids <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/clarks-kids/id544647104?mt=8>

But while we're on a branded games tip... This one for shoe retailer Clarks 
squeezes in augmented reality, Kimberly Wyatt formerly of the Pussycat Dolls, 
and a matching-shoes memory game. No information about the merits of thin 
bleach, as far as I'm aware.
