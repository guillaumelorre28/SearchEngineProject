Wake Up! is a music and spoken-word hybrid, combining Christian hymns revamped 
by modern musicians and composers with 11 speeches delivered by Francis in 
Italian, Spanish, English and Portuguese. There’s modern music on offer, too, 
from string-laden balladry on ¿Por Què Sufren Los Niños? (“Why do Children 
Suffer?”) to Latin-inspired pop and soft-rock.

The album is to be released on 27 November 
<http://popefranciswakeup.believedigital.com/> via Believe Digital, and part of 
the proceeds from sales are due to be donated to a refugee support fund. Have a 
listen to the pope’s musical debut below – it’s not too late for it to sneak on 
to the album of the year lists, after all.
