 at the 2014 Aria music awards on Wednesday but a day later, the singer is 
empty-handed after giving away all four of her gongs to Twitter followers as a 
reward for ‚Äúgood deeds‚Äù.


The Australian singer, who rarely performs in public without covering her face

, didn‚Äôt show it at all at the Sydney ceremony, where she won awards for best 
female artist, best pop release, best music video and album of the year.

Katy Perry, One Direction and Australia‚Äôs own 5 Days of Summer were among the

. Sia accepted her four awards via a single video-link, leaving Triple J 
presenter Matt Okineto dress up as the singer <https://twitter.com/m_onicatan> 
in her absence.

On Thursday morning, following a barrage of social media criticism, Sia took 
to Twitter to appease those giving her ‚Äúshit for being a ‚Äòno-show‚Äô‚Äù. She 
offered her awards up to the first four people to tweet evidence of a good deed.

I made four thank you/acceptance videos for the arias. They chose to show one. 
I'm saddened to be getting shit for being a 'no-show' üòî.

The other three awards went to Sia super fan @QueenSiaFurler 
<https://twitter.com/QueenSiaFurler/status/537759114219520000> for preparing a 
salad for a family whose child had terminal cancer, US marketing director
@JACQUES901 <https://twitter.com/JACQUES901/status/537735097504370688> for 
volunteering in her local community, and Orlando shopworker@QTLBJ  
<https://twitter.com/QTLBJ/status/537723537075609601>who donated his staff 
discount to a customer buying a gift for a sibling.

Having translated the initial Aria backchat into a torrent of do-gooding, with 
hundreds of replies to her original offer, Sia inspired further good will from
@QTLBJ <https://twitter.com/QTLBJ/status/537723537075609601> who later tweeted: 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a mega fan but@joshrsea <https://twitter.com/joshrsea> sounds like he is 
too. I‚Äôm all about giving so I give mine to him.#HappyThanksgiving
