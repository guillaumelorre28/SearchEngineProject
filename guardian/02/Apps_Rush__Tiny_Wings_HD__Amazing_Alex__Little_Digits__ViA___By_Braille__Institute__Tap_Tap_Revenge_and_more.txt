Tiny Wings HD <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tiny-wings-hd/id541517597?mt=8>

This is slightly complicated. There is a sequel to iPhone hit game Tiny Wings, 
but oniPhone <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> it's been released 
as a free update to the original – something for which developer Andreas 
Illiger deserves every ounce of praise he's currently receiving online. But 
this also means a brand new iPad version of Tiny Wings, complete with the 
ability to play against friends on a single device.

game, The Incredible Machine). Expect 100 levels of physics-puzzling, with an 
editor to create and share your own levels. For more on Amazing Alex, see this

Institute, it sorts apps by category, price and star rating, with a forum for
