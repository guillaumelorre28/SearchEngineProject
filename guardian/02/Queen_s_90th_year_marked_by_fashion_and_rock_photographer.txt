beside the Queen.

Knight, 58, whose debut publication in 1982 was a book called Skinhead 
<http://nickknight.com/publications/skinhead/>, has had his work showcased in 
the Victoria & Albert Museum and the Saatchi Gallery.

“It was a great pleasure and an honour to photograph Her Majesty the Queen and 
the Prince of Wales at Windsor Castle. I wanted to create a modern portrait 
that showed warmth and humanity as well as strength and tradition,” he said of 
his portrait.

The Queen <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/queen> thanked those who helped her 
celebrated her special day with a party in the Mall but said at the time: “How 
I will feel if people are still singing happy birthday to me in December 
remains to be seen.”
