Vital Yurchanka once ran a successful business selling shoes in his hometown 
of Homel, in south-easternBelarus <https://www.theguardian.com/world/belarus>, 
but the deepening economic crisis in the country recently forced him to close 
up shop.

Under a new law, Yurchanka will have to pay $245 (£166) a year to the state in 
lieu of his taxes. 
<http://belarusdigest.com/story/belarus-war-its-social-parasites-22262> 

The legislation, known local as the “social parasite” law, has sparked dismay 
in Belarus, where many struggle to make ends meet. It has previously been 
described as a move tocriminalise unemployment 
<http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/509831.html>. 

For Yurchanka the decree smacks of Soviet times, when “parasitism” was a 
criminal offence known as “tuneyadstvo” which,according to the Moscow Times 
<http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/509831.html>, was based on the notion 
that “every able-bodied person has a duty to work and help build a utopian 
communist society.”

“This is like 1937. Go and work or we will force you to,” he said. “I think 
people will try to express their outrage and they will be right.”

How can such a decree be passed when there are no jobs in the city?

The new rules, signed into law  
<http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/no-job-pay-up-belarus-imposes-fines-for-being-unemployed/518581.html>
by Belarus’ authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko earlier this month, 
aim to “stimulate able-bodied citizens to engage in labour activity and fulfil 
their constitutional obligation to participate in financing state expenditures.”

Adults who have not paid income tax covering at least 183 days of employment 
per year will be fined. Failure to pay will be punishable by additional fines 
and ultimately by detention, followed by community service.

According to the decree, certain categories of citizens are exempt, including 
students, parents caring for three or more children, minors, and people over 
the retirement age.

Yurchanka has launched an online petition 
<https://www.change.org/p/%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%B5%D0%BC-%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8B-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0-no-3-%D0%BE-%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%8F%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5?recruiter=42509868&utm_campaign=signature_receipt_fb_dialog&utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=share_petition&fb_ref=Default>
 on the popular website Change.org demanding that the controversial new law be 
scratched.

The petition says the fines violate the constitution, which protects the 
economic interests of citizens and bans the enforcement of community work 
without a court ruling.


The petition has already been signed by more than 25,000 people, many of whom 
are using the platform to vent their anger.

“So a woman who has three children is good, but a woman who has two children 
and who brings them up and takes care of the house is now a social parasite?” 
wrote one signatory .

“How can such a decree be passed when there are no jobs in the city?” wrote 
another.

Critics are also poking fun at the law with the hashtag, 
#придумайналогдлябеларуси (literally translated as “think up a tax for 
Belarus”) inviting users to propose their own, mock tax initiatives.

The Twitter account @Belaruski_front suggested taxing newborns: 
“Congratulations! You have given birth to another taxpayer! 3200! The cashier 
is on the first floor!”

One proposed a tax on reading. “You read, you pay. Clever people are 
proliferating, the country needs workers.”

Another suggested imposing a tax on stargazing. “Look at the sky... It’s free 
but not in Belarus.”
