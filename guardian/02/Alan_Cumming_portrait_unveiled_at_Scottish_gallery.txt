A portrait of actor Alan Cumming 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alan-cumming> is to be unveiled at the 
Scottish National Portrait Gallery.

The 49-year-old, who was awarded an OBE in 2009 for his services to 
entertainment and his role as an LGBT campaigner, is one of Scotland’s leading 
actors with roles ranging from Taggart and The Good Wife on television, to the 
X-Men films and Cabaret and Macbeth on stage.

The portrait by Christian Hook is the winning commission for the Sky Arts 
portrait artist of the year 2014 competition. The artist, who is from Gibraltar 
where he teaches the subject, painted Cumming in his home city of New York, 
depicting him on stage surrounded by footlights. In a nod to Cummings’ 
celebrated Broadway performance in Cabaret, a top hat sits beside him, while 
the actor’s Scottish heritage is emphasised in a kilt draped around his neck.

Christopher Baker, director of the gallery, said: “This extraordinary portrait 
celebrates the art of performance. It’s a remarkable tribute to a widely 
admired actor and an impressive work of painterly drama, which displays the 
skills of a talented artist, whose work will now become more widely recognised.”

portrait showed Cumming wearing a tartan scarf. It shows him with a kilt, not a 
scarf, around his neck
