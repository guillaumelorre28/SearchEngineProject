Former Gulag prisoner and now feted Russian treasure Alexander Solzhenitsyn is 
in talks to make a film adaptation of his Soviet-era novel Cancer Ward, his 
wife told Izvestia yesterday. The news comes hot on the heels of a hit Russian 
TV adaptation of his The First Circle, broadcast earlier this year. Cancer 
Ward, written between 1966 and 1968, uses the disease as a metaphor for 
totalitarianism. No other details were available.

Paul Greengrass will reportedly be back in the director's chair for amnesiac 
spy Jason Bourne's third outing. According to Empire, the Bourne Supremacy 
director (the second film, in case your brain has wiped out all memory of the 
last two years) is now confirmed to take the reins on The Bourne Ultimatum. 
Work is already under way, with a script by Tony Gilroy and Tom Stoppard. Matt 
Damon returns as the spy.

After taking an oblique swipe at fundamentalism with his last film Kingdom of 
Heaven, directorRidley Scott, he of Blade Runner and Gladiator fame, will next 
be setting his sights on the war on terror. Scott is to direct Penetration, 
based on an espionage thriller by David Ignatius about a CIA spy who must work 
with a Jordanian intelligence chief while pursuing a wanted terrorist. Along 
the way, moral and cultural clashes put the operation at risk.
