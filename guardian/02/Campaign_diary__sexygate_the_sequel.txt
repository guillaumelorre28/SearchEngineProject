Tony Abbott bursting with pride about his star candidate for Lindsay, Fiona 
Scott, who had just answered a question about the five pillars of the Coalition 
policy:

"Obviously from that answer she ain't just a pretty face."

Kevin Rudd on his star recruit, Peter Beattie, campaigning in Townsville 
instead of his seat of Forde:

"As I said when I launched Peter a week ago .... "

â€“ which left his audience with visions of a champagne bottle cracked over 
Beattie's head.

@PetefromHayNSW wondered about Labor's attack ads, particularly the one with a 
woman chopping what appears to be fruit with a very sharp knife.

Prop of the day: the Vegemite Files

Flat shoes: Kevin Rudd visited the Condong bowling club in the Tweed for a 
chat and a bowl. The gathered throng, which included the former press gallery 
stalwart Mungo MacCallum, could not go on to the bowling greens without their 
flatties.

Stat of the day

Abbott's interview with 2GB's Chris Smith focused on the clock. It said:

Wake up call: 5am.
Bedtime: 12am.
Campaign days to go: 19.

Candidate of the day

Queensland Senate candidate Greg Rudd, brother of the prime minister, was 
looking forward to a televised debate with Bob Katter and Clive Palmer at the 
National Press Club. That is, until the ABC pulled the plug and the press club 
announced a debate with Katter and Palmer only.

"I take issue with the way the media is intent on running presidential races 
with leaders of parties when we aren't governed by a presidential system," he 
said.

Has he talked to "el presidente", who was brought back to the ALP leadership 
to campaign in that very style?
