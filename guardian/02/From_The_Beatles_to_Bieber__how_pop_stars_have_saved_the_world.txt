When the news broke that One Direction had launched their very own 
humanitarian project 
<http://www.u.tv/Entertainment/2015/07/08/One-Direction-launch-humanitarian-project-40638>
, we on theGDPN desk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network> found 
ourselves reflecting on the profound contribution that pop has made to 
humanitarian endeavour. We decided, after some discussion, that the moment had 
come to put together the history of this unique relationship, and so compiled a 
timeline tracing the many ways in which pop stars haveliterally saved the 
world, from 1967 to the present. We can only say, with all humility, thank you.


1967 - The Beatles

Ravi Shankar’s Madison Square gig with George Harrison, Bob Dylan and Eric 
Clapton broke new ground with the then-radical but now common-place equation: 
if one pop star equals X amount of awareness, two pop stars will obviously 
equal X times two. For the layman: the more pop stars, the more doolah. Besides 
this epochal step forward in our understanding of the possibilities of 
pop-star-world-saving,The Concert for Bangladesh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jul/28/concert-for-bangladesh-charity-pop>
 also raised awareness for the refugee crisis in Bangladesh after the Bhola 
cyclone in 1970, and the liberation war of 1971, raising $243,000 overnight.


1984 - Bob Geldof (and that Midge Ure bloke)

After a quiet time in pop philanthropy, coinciding, purely by chance, with the 
first oil shock and the 1970s recession, the 80s was the decade when pop stars 
across the world finally felt the urge return to save someone, or something. Or 
just anything.


“Singer” Bob Geldof found his true calling in putting together Band Aid to 
raise money for the Ethiopian famine in 1984, creating the 
people-in-a-studio-together format that has given the world so much (it’s hard 
to imagine life without the melodic harmonies ofFerry Across the Mersey 
<http://www.the-paulmccartney-project.com/song/ferry-cross-the-mersey/>, to 
give just one example).The Live Aid concerts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/1985/jul/15/famine.garethparry> that 
followed reportedly raised £150m, and gave Geldof an ongoing career, and an 
honorary knighthood. Midge Ure was there too, somewhere.


1985 - Stevie Wonder and Lionel Richie Are The World


Following the success of Band Aid, Michael Jackson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson> co-wrote “We are the World” 
with Lionel Richie for USA for Africa. Since its release, the 80s power ballad 
has raised $63m for humanitarian causes.


Harry Belafonte <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/harry-belafonte>, the 
king of Calypso, also sang on that track with MJ and Lionel. A humanitarian and 
activist, he continued to campaign throughout his career, and received a 
humanitarian Oscar last year.


Competing for space in the charts was the ‘Sun City’ charity single. Featuring 
Bruce Springsteen and Lou Reed singing against apartheid – this also showcased
Bono <https://www.theguardian.com/music/bono>, making his tentative first steps 
into a field he would go on to claim triumphantly as his own.

1993 - Yvonne Chaka Chaka

Another global recession, and another lull in pop star world-saving activity. 
Fortunately as the 90s opened out, Yvonne Chaka Chaka was on hand to launch the 
Chaka Chaka Helping Hand. Inevitably, she has since become one of Unicef’s 
goodwill ambassadors (well-known as a front organisation forthe Avengers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-avengers>, by the way). 


1997 - Shakira

Since launching her charity for impoverished children in Colombia, Shakira has 
been hailed as a fully-fledged pop philanthropist – she even has a section 
dedicated to her philanthropy on her personal website. She recently hosted a
charity baby shower

In a move that we can only assume was accidental, Coldplay’s philanthropic

£1 million to children’s charity Kids Company. Once out of the closet however, 
Chris Martin went full throttle. He’s recently pledged a long-term commitment

2013 - Justin Bieber


After those dark days, it was up to Justin Bieber to bring us back from the

work for the crisis following Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, rallying his 
Beliebers to raise over $3million to the relief effort. (This was also the year 
that hepeed in a bucket

2015 - One Direction


Which brings us all to probably the biggest story in the history of 
pop-humanitarian work, with the news yesterday that One Direction had launched 
theirAction 1D <https://action1d.onedirectionmusic.com/> campaign, calling 
their millions of fans to submit a video or photograph of how they want the 
world to be. Already the hating is starting, with the Daily Mail  
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3154523/One-Direction-accused-having-two-faces-climate-change-campaign-despite-using-TWO-private-jets.html>
laying into the popsters for using two private jets while simultaneously 
wringing their hands about climate change. But guys, as Taylor would say: 
“Haters gonna hate ... just shake it off.” And, obviously, save the world too.
