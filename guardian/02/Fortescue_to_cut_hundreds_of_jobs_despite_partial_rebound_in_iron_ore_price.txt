About 700 jobs will be lost at Fortescue Metals, its founder Andrew Forrest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/andrew-forrest> has confirmed.

Forrest described the job cuts, from a workforce of about 4,500, as 
“personally tragic” and “heartbreaking”, but said the iron ore company was 
still making profits, with a break-even price of about US$39 a tonne.


The iron ore price has rebounded to about US$62 a tonne after heading towards 
US$40 last month.


Forrest noted Fortescue’s rivals Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton had a break-even 
price of about US$30 a tonne, and the latter announced plans on Tuesday to 
slash costs at its WA iron ore mines to US$16 a tonne.


The billionaire and philanthropist took another swipe at the mining giants for 
increasing output when prices were low.


He said Tuesday’s federal budget was positive in light of the “debilitating” 
impact on the economy of the “market share game being played by a couple of 
multinationals”.

“They did try and crush all competitors overseas and in Australia to gain, 
what I would say, not worth it points of market share,” he told the ABC on 
Wednesday.


He renewed his call for a parliamentary inquiry into what he called the 
“predatory volume behaviour” of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto which was 
“distorting the free market”.


“When the power of the balance sheet ... meets the power of public office, the 
power of the balance sheet is no match,” Forrest said.


He has been backed by the Australian Workers Union, which has accused BHP 
Billiton and Rio Tinto of anti-competitive and “cartel-like” behaviour.


Forrest was himself investigated by the Australian Competition and Consumer 
Commission for potentially breaching cartel laws after he called on the big 
iron ore miners to cap production to boost the iron ore price. The ACCC later 
dropped the matter.
