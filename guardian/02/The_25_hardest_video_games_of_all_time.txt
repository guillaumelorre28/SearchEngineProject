Games <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/games> used to be harder. That’s 
the lament veteran players now mutter whenever encountering some modern 
shoot-’em-up or action adventure. It sounds like the same sort of nostalgic 
elitism that music snobs indulge in, criticising current bands for lacking the 
legendary quality of yesterday’s heroes. But with games, it’s kind of true.


As the industry has grown, the big titles have moved towards toning down the 
difficulty, in order to give a smooth experience to as wide a range of players 
as possible. Nowadays, if you want a real challenge, you have to select “hard” 
mode, which usually just means more enemies and less ammo. But difficulty is at 
its best when it’s an intrinsic part of the design: players have to think about 
the game in another way – and earn their progress.

That is certainly true for the titles in this list. They’re not all classics, 
but even the plainly unfair ones have unforgettable qualities that made us 
persevere. That’s the thing with difficulty: it only really hurts when you want 
to see what’s next.

When Fromsoft’s Hidetaka Miyazaki set out to rethink the action RPG genre, one 
of the new foundations was serious challenge. His thinking was: how can a 
player feel accomplishment without overcoming real odds? In these games, even 
the most basic enemies murder players again and again, so that the screen 
message “YOU DIED” is imprinted on the brain. The only consolation is that 
death is a staple part of how these worlds work. In other games, dying is 
failure, but here dying is how you learn, how you get better. In Souls, death 
is just part of the journey.

Capcom’s side-scrolling platformer used the ever-present threat of death to 
create a uniquely intense adventure. One hit reduces protagonist knight Arthur 
to his heart-patterned boxers, and the second kills. Unpredictable enemies 
spawn everywhere, power-ups can be traps, and most players never see past the 
first stage. Those that reach the end find out that they’ve either failed to 
bring the holy cross, which means replaying the last two levels, or that in 
bringing it they’ve fallen for “a trap devised by Satan”, and have to do the 
whole thing over again. On an even higher difficulty setting. Capcom, you 
rascal.

Challenge was always part of the Ninja Gaiden series, but 2008’s Ninja Gaiden 
II <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jun/12/microsoft.ninjagarden2> 
hit a new peak of demanding insanity. These enemies rough-house the player on 
even “normal” difficulty but, once the setting is at Master Ninja, they attack 
relentlessly with brutal health-chewing grabs and projectiles. In later levels, 
foes have cannons for arms that are fire with unerring precision and 
regularity. It’s impossible to survive at times, nevermind kill anything. 
Naturally, the internet means someone has done the whole thing in four hours 
without being hit once.

God Hand’s commercial failure means many of the best ideas are yet to be 
stolen, one being the on-screen difficulty meter that responds to a player’s 
skill. There are four gradations, from level one to level DIE (the highest 
level), and if you’re getting smacked around it stays low. Once you get good at 
this (already tough) game however, it amps up how enemies attack, where they’ll 
attack from, how much damage they do, and increases the rewards for defeating 
them. Few games make the demands that God Hand does, and none tie difficulty 
and performance together with such elegance.

 UFO: Enemy Unknown, or XCOM in the US. Photograph: Mythos Games 
This is where the XCOM series began, a deep strategy game with an unforgiving 
attitude towards lax play. The designer, Julian Gollop, had made many great 
turn-based titles in 2D but XCOM’s isometric perspective and implementation of 
fog-of-war added a terrifying strategic dimension – so many soldiers lost to a 
dark corner you never checked. The aliens exploit mistakes, cut down your 
soldiers ruthlessly, and back at base force you into hard choices in the 
desperate scramble to keep humanity safe. If this is anything to go by, we’re 
screwed.

 Fade To Black Photograph: Delphine 
Flashback’s sequel was an early attempt to bring a successful 2D design into 
3D – and underestimated just how important precision controls are. Though a 
forward-thinking third-person design in some respects, Fade to Black was undone 
by many enemies that could kill in a single hit – one terrifying example being 
a tiny hard-to-target blob that flips towards the player character before 
dissolving all their flesh on contact. The lavish cutscenes created by the 
developer for each possible death make you wonder whether the tail was wagging 
the dog.

Perhaps Eugene Jarvis is better represented by Robotron 2084, an impossible 
challenge and a much better game, but that low-fi sci-fi shooter lacks NARC’s 
crude impact. A two-player arcade game starring Max Force and Hit Man, out to 
take down Mr Big, NARC was one of the first games to truly glory in gibs and 
ultraviolence – the various junkies, punks and thugs explode into gory gobbets 
as the guns of justice blaze. Jarvis’s games are always difficult but, with 
NARC,they reached a whole new level of cruel theatre.

Smash T.V. is an arcade classic and exemplifies a school of design that’s now 
largely dead: to make people desperate to see the next screen. The setup is 
perfect, a future gameshow where contestants move through rooms filled with 
death-dealing nasties and gain more prizes the longer they stay alive. Even the 
first room won’t hesitate to kill unwary players and, from then on, the gloves 
come off as Jarvis (again) and co-designer Mark Turmell squeeze as much colour, 
shrapnel, and explosive ordnance on-screen as possible. “Total carnage,” shouts 
the announcer. “IIIIIII love it!”

There could be any number of arcade beat-em-ups in this spot – TMNT, X-Men, 
even Final Fight – but in terms of efficiently guzzling coins through gorgeous 
presentation and artificial difficulty, it’s hard to top The Simpsons arcade 
game. The visuals, animations, enemies and scenarios are exceptional and 
clearly a labour of love (unlike the script) but the game beneath them is a 
brutal slugfest that especially enjoys stunlocking players – where one hit 
leads to many more.

Takeshi’s Challenge (Taito Corporation, 1986)
 Takeshi’s Challenge. Photograph: Taito 
Originally planned as an 8bit version of his TV show Takeshi’s Castle, 
Japanese actor and director Takeshi Kitano instead got hands-on with Takeshi no 
Chōsenjō and created a game unlike any other – one whose packaging warned that 
“conventional gaming skills do not apply”. Loosely following a salaryman who 
dreams of finding treasure, Takeshi’s Challenge serves up a Game Over for 
innocuous “mistakes” like not quitting the character’s job, failing to divorce 
his wife, or not hitting the right people. You can get a Game Over on the 
password screen. Another challenge requires you leave the controller untouched 
for an hour. All games are arbitrary: only Takeshi’s Challenge glorifies in the 
fact.

So original it spawned a genre, Rogue is a procedurally generated dungeon 
crawler where the difficulty – in the sense of what it chooses to throw at you 
– is a huge part of the appeal. Not only will each fresh adventure bring new 
environmental challenges and fights, but potions and weapons are random too – 
meaning just taking a glug is dicing with death. Players have to be adaptive 
rather than memorising specific challenges, and eking out a long adventure when 
the odds are stacked against you becomes part of the fun.

The motto of this game’s community says it all: “losing is fun!” Dwarf 
Fortress is a game that has inspired wholeprose epics 
<http://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/> on the travails of players’ 
ill-fated settlements, most of which start off meagre and then quickly fall 
prey to the thousands of things that can go wrong. Wolves, cave-ins, famine, 
cabin-fever, flooding, burrowing down to a demon god … Failure is inevitable, 
and not only do your dwarves go mad in adversity – they often create works of 
art to reflect what’s happened. There are plenty of tough games, but generating 
psychological scars for fictional characters suggests Dwarf Fortress is

Doomed to curio status by a modest Japan-only release, The Adventure of Little 
Ralph plays like it was forged in the fires of arcade game design, but it is in 
fact exclusive to the originalPlayStation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/playstation> and PSN. Scoring focused, 
hard as hell and shrouded in cult mystique, the traditional platformer today 
courts three-figure sums on the collector market, further denying it the broad 
audience it deserves. It’s “saving the damsel in distress” narrative may be 
hackneyed, but fiercely demanding boss fights that reinvent TAoLR as a 
beat-‘em-up serve to make it mechanically distinct, and cement its reputation 
as one of the most testing platformers yet developed.

Difficulty in games is often a matter of testing the player’s ability to 
control with precision and react at speed. Coktel Vision’s narratively dark 
adventure game, however, is instead a test of semiotic nous. Its 
post-apocalyptic tale is told with an abundance of made up words, many of which 
pass without definition, while its knack for conversation without context make 
it thoroughly confusing. Even Clockwork Orange had a glossary. And if you’re 
tempted to use trial and error to crack its puzzles, be warned that the sheer 
number of inventory items and illogical quirks make it a protracted, 
painstaking process.

Mushihimesama (Cave, 2004)
 Mushihimesama 
If any game genre is most synonymous with difficulty, it is the arcade 2D 
shoot-‘em-up, known today as the shmup. And it is developer Cave that pushes 
devotees of the form like no other. Which Cave game is the hardest is highly 
subjective, but in terms of undiluted difficulty, the insect-themed 
Mushihimesama’s infamous Ultra mode might take it. There’s less of the 
mechanical intricacy that makes other releases by the studio perhaps as 
demanding, but through the sheer number of bullets that fill the screen, Mushi 
Ultra delivers an onslaught that is as bewildering to watch as it is demeaning 
to play.

Any arcade music game has the capacity for towering difficulty. Take on some 
high-BPM electronica on a demanding difficulty setting, and whether you’re 
pounding your feet on a Dance Dance Revolution machine or standing over the 
decks of an oddity like EZ2DJ, the challenge will be immense. Few compare, 
however, to the standard set by the Single modes of In The Groove, the debut of 
a short-lived series from Austin-based studio Roxor. Some of the tracks, when 
played on the game’s X setting, seem to want movement from the player’s body 
that is in no way catered for by human evolution.

If there’s a single moment that defines the experience of playing Super Meat 
Boy, it is quickly prodding the quick restart button. The platformer’s 
undersized stages brim with hazards, yet encourage you to play at furious 
speed. As a result, it’s a game of failing over and over again. However, by 
allowing for split-second restarts, there’s almost no drop in momentum as you 
ride the loop of trying and dying. As such, Super Meat Boy works its players 
into a frenzied trance state from which it can take hours to recover.

For a good while, this side-scrolling motorcycling game feels like a 
meditative experience – and then the difficulty curve suddenly shoots straight 
for the heavens. It is then that the game reveals its true form; a nightmarish 
physics puzzler dressed as a driving game. Just how do you get over that 
vertical wall? How many degrees of rotation are needed to land on that 
upside-down ramp? The answer is intimacy with every nuance of a bike’s 
suspension and weight; an intimacy a handful of players globally are reported 
to have mastered enough to have aced the game’s closing stages.

 Battle Garegga Photograph: 8ing 
At a glance, Battle Garegga appears to sport a difficulty comparable to your 
usual 2D shooter: intensely tough, but nothing absurdly so. However, it is the 
way the game makes you play that pushes it into the “hardest ever” field. 
Battle Garegga has remarkably complex rank, that is, difficulty, that adapts to 
the way you play. Managing rank to keep the game playable means avoiding some 
power ups and bonuses, and even “suiciding”, where lives are lost on purpose. 
Playing properly means playing on the edge, life stocks low and weapon power 
reserved, and it’s acutely exciting. The current world-record holder Kamui has 
held and bettered her leaderboard position through an estimated 18 years of 
devoted play, demonstrating the commitment Garegga demands.

Core’s homage to Indiana Jones is a platformer played a few pixels at a time, 
edging forward to see what will kill you next. There are spikes, pits and 
boulders at every turn, and learning by failing is almost the only way to 
proceed. Your inventory is severely limited too, and there’s some tremendously 
demanding precision needed in a handful of particularly cruel and frustrating 
sections. Years later, Core would go on to craft another tomb raiding game, by 
which time the studio had apparently learned how to treat its fans a little 
more fairly.

Shadow of the Beast II (Psygnosis, 1990)

Mention the first Shadow of the Beast to the right crowd, and you’ll likely 
hear nostalgic musings on how its pioneering use of the parallax scrolling 
technique pushed game visuals into a new era. Ask about it’s sequel, and the 
response may be a little less rosy. The melee-focussed, multi-directional 
platform game would have been straight up demanding if it gave you any 
guidance. But it doesn’t, leaving you to work out everything for yourself. In a 
time before Youtube and walkthroughs, that alone was enough to make Shadow of 
the Beast II one of the toughest of its day.

Time Crisis (Namco, 1995)

Listing a familiar lightgun game might seem out of place on a list like this. 
After all, anybody who’s visited a dilapidated seaside arcade has likely thrown 
a handful of coins into the slot of Namco’s cop blaster, and felt nothing but 
delight. But try and complete the first Time Crisis properly – clearing it in a 
single credit – and it’s difficulty begins to become manifest. The lack of a 
hit indicator leaves a gaping hole in your ability to respond appropriately, 
and some punishingly curt timed sections serve to make it particularly easy to 
fast track to the game over screen.

Those who played this freeware platforming treasure that never officially left 
beta will likely find it hard to forget. Boiling its genre down to its founding 
elements, I Wanna Be The Guy was developed as a response to a then unfinished, 
brutally demanding Japanese flash game named Jinsei Owata. O’Reilly was 
convinced he could push Jinsei Owata’s difficulty a little further, and it 
appears he succeed. As a result, his game has become a reference point for the 
most testing indie titles. Super Meat Boy featured IWBTG’s protagonist, The 
Kid, who also starred as the final boss of the conclusive build of Jinsei Owata.

The greatest sin of this straight-to-console beat-‘em-up was that it tried to 
do things differently. It approached the control conventions of arcade fighters 
from the left field, using a range of weird button combos and d-pad swipes, but 
the result was a complex system too demanding for most ordinary players and 
utterly counterintuitive to committed beat-‘em-up competitors. The 
computer-controlled characters were also rather too good at their own game, and 
Weaponlord was ultimately consigned to its fate as a curio most renowned for 
being the first fighter designed with online play in mind. If you are tempted, 
the MegaDrive port is a little more forgiving than its SNES cousin.

Flywrench (Messhoff, 2015)

While Nidhogg is Messhoff’s most famous game, Flywrench must be its hardest. 
The set-up is deceptively simple; guide an abstract spaceship through minimal 
mazes that look altogether innocent, changing colour as you pass. The reality 
is very different, where constantly dying and restarting is the standard. 
Flywrench is perhaps the most difficult game of the past year, or the past nine 
years, if you were one of the few who played the 2007 original, which saw an 
understated online release and inspired Braid creator Jonathan Blow to craft a 
playfully easy version named Nicewrench.
