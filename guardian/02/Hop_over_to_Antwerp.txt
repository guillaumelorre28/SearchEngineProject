Your determination to ignore beer even extends to travel and holiday offers. 
In the Review (1 February) a travel offer to visit Lille and Antwerp includes 
"dinner with wine" in Antwerp. In case you haven't heard, Antwerp is in 
Belgium, arguably the greatest brewing nation on the planet, with a vast 
portfolio of beers â€“ many of which can be enjoyed in Antwerp's bars and 
restaurants. Just a few metres from the central station,Bier Central 
<http://biercentral.be/home/> is a spacious restaurant that stocks 300 Belgian 
beers and matches them with excellent food. The cafe De Pelgrim is attached to 
the city's major brewery,De Koninck <http://www.dekoninck.be>, and also matches 
beer with food, including a range of Belgian cheeses. To recommend "wine with 
dinner" in Antwerp insults the locals. When the Guardian announced a 
Masterclass on how to become a micro-brewer, the event was sold out within 
days. Pardon the pun, but there's a thirst for beer knowledge among your 
readers and it's time you reflected this in your pages.
