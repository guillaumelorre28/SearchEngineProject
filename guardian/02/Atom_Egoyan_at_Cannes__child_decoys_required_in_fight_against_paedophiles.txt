Director Atom Egoyan revealed that a notorious real life child abduction case 
in his Canadian home town was the inspiration for his latest film, The Captive, 
which was unveiled on Friday at the Cannes film festival. Egoyan did not name 
the specific case, but it is almost certainly that ofMichael Dunahee 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dunahee>, a four-year-old who went 
missing from a play area in Victoria, British Columbia in 1991, and who has 
never been found.

"The boy went missing from a park very close to where I lived. I know the 
park, I know where he went missing and I know the mother just turned her back 
for a moment. Every time I go back I see posters for him, and the parents are 
still very invested in this, believing that the child will emerge from the 
forest one day. That story is at the basis of the film."

The Captive <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-captive> tells the story of 
a married couple whose young daughter is kidnapped and is imprisoned in a 
secure basement room by a paedophile with access to an extensive system of 
webcams and digital surveillance; it also follows the investigating team 
attempting to solve the crime some eight years later. According to the actors 
involved in the film, Egoyan asked them to read One Child at a Time: The Global 
Fight to Rescue Children from Online Predators by Julian Sher as preparation 
for their roles. Rosario Dawson, who plays the
lead investigator, voiced her dismay after reading Sher's contention that 
"there are not literally enough cops in the world, even if they were online 24 
hours a day, seven days a week, they could not protect every child".

Moreover, Egoyan himself said he had identified "an effective block in terms 
of penetrating a [child abuse] ring" in that the police are not allowed to use 
children as decoys. "At some point one of these rings want you to present a 
child, and police technically cannot do that … without that you cannot enter 
into the core, so the police are hampered."

The Captive also allowed Egoyan to deploy once again his themes of 
surveillance and video. "In this film it extends into a place where there is an 
imaginary cult, that is not so hard to imagine, a surveillance group that is 
watching the suffering of the people who have been left behind [after a 
kidnapping] … it seemed so extreme, yet so natural given the psychology the 
film is examining."

The Captive drew boos from the press audience after its first showing, but has 
drawn divided reactions. In a four-star review The Daily Telegraph's Robbie 
Collin called it"a shiveringly tense abduction thriller: half-opaque and 
bitingly cold like the surface of a frozen lake"

,
but the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw said it was "offensively preposterous and 
crass"
