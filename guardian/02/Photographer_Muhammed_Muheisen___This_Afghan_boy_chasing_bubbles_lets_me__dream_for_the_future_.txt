For Pulitzer-winning photographer Muhammed Muheisen, trust is the most 
important part of his job – perhaps even more important than his camera. “Trust 
is not something you can buy, or get in no time,” he says. “It’s a long-term 
investment. It’s a feeling I work hard to earn.” This week, the chief 
photographer in Pakistan for theAssociated Press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/associated-press> was awarded the $10,000 
Oliver S Gramling award for journalism for his remarkable images of refugee 
children – images that are largely the result of his ability to connect with 
his subjects.


“I have spent four years walking, talking and asking, with no language except 
respect and curiosity, about the lives of the people I photographed,” he says. 
“Day by day, I felt their trust growing, just as I saw the children growing 
before my eyes. I became part of their lives, as they became part of mine.”

Muheisen, who has worked in conflict zones in Syria, Yemen, South Africa and 
beyond, has found that with patience and empathy, he can gain access other 
photographers can’t. Now based in Islamabad, the Jerusalem-born photographer

Hundreds of thousands of Afghans have fled wars and fighting since the 80s, 
and there are currently more than 1.6 million Afghan refugees inPakistan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan>. Muheisen had travelled to these 
communities to tell the stories of displaced people and, when he was offered 
the job based in Islamabad, he didn’t need persuading. “I felt attached and 
involved, and I knew there was a lot more I could do by being based there 
instead of visiting,” he says.

His pictures evoke such compassion that they often prompt readers to ask how 
to help his subjects. After publishing a series of portraits of Afghan refugee 
children, for instance, he received dozens of emails. “My pictures created a 
bridge between worlds, created awareness that could lead to change,” he says. 
“My pictures carried the voices of my subjects and said them out loud. That is 
my greatest pleasure as a photographer. This is the real reward.”

According to the UN’s refugee agency, some 3.8 million Afghans have returned 
home since the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2002, but thousands still live 
without electricity and running water – let alone basic services such as 
schooling. Muheisenhas photographed many of the makeshift schools

 Pakistani children head to school in Islamabad over a stream of sewage and 
rubbish that separates their neighbourhood from the main road 
“In some schools,” he says, “children learn how to read and write the alphabet 
and numbers . In others they teach more, with a kind of curriculum; it depends 
on the donations each school receives. Most of them are temporary setups hoping 
to educate the illiterate children living nearby.”

Muheisen’s photographs often focus on the joyful side of life for these 
children, and some of his most moving images are of boys flying kites and 
groups laughing or gangs crowding around their local balloon seller. “Children 
are the real victims of any conflict,” he explains. “Children can never choose 
or decide – children only seek fun and happiness. By portraying their lives, I 
am allowing their voices to be heard by the outside world. A picture of a child 
in Pakistan becomes a message to a child in London.”

Muheisen believes everyone has something to fight for: “That’s what makes us 
strong. People who live in hard conditions simply find ways to adapt, and they 
see that things could be worse. But I hope their future will be better than 
their past and present. Those people opened their doors for me, respected me, 
trusted me to have their pictures taken. If I dream of anything, it is for them 
and their children to have some peace.”

Muheisen says: “I have learned to feel lucky and appreciate everything I have 
in my life. When I see how happy people can be from the limited recourses they 
have, when I hear children laugh and I walk towards them to find out what magic 
has made them happy … We don’t need much to be happy; that is what I have 
learned.”
