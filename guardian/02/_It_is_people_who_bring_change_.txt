A three-hour drive away from Maseru at an altitude of 5,291 feet, Kena clinic 
lies in a mountainous region dotted with goats.

Over the past four years, it has emerged as one of Lesotho's main 
HIV-prevention hubs. Here, 36 care facilitators, along with support group 
members, gather to sing about PMTCT. Some of them have trekked nine hours to 
make the meeting.

"The work of the care facilitators is so important," says home-based care 
officer Ntho Mokone."At the beginning of the project, due to stigma and 
discrimination, people found it hard to accept. But now most are disclosing 
their status," she says.

"It is because most of the volunteers are people living with HIV. When 
community members see how they are living healthily and positively and hear 
them talking about themselves openly, they are encouraged. It is people who 
bring change."

Since 2005, nine mothers have benefited from the British Red Cross project at 
Kena. Each of the mothers gave birth to HIV-negative children. "A 100% success 
rate," smiles Ntho.

Up until now, the project has been entirely reliant financially on NGO 
funding, with the British Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) 
supporting the project and sending doctors to the clinic every fortnight to 
check on clients. Yet funding is only half the story.

"Sometimes we don't have enough money to buy condoms and then I don't know 
what to say to people," says Ntho. "It sometimes happens when the money doesn't 
come through from the main office. I'd rather then put my hand in my own pocket 
than turn clients away."

The sincerity and dedication of individual community members is absolutely 
fundamental to the fight against HIV. Money and people make the world go around.
