Stranger By The Lake <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgcEGKn7waI> (18) 
(Alain Guiraudie, 2013, Fra) Pierre Deladonchamps, Christophe Paou, Patrick 
D'Assumçao, Jérôme Chapatte. 100 mins

Sex and death take a synchronised swim in this bold thriller, shot at a single 
lakeside location. It's a popular cruising spot, and the rituals of its regular 
(and regularly naked) male visitors are observed with a combination of 
frankness, lyricism and mischievous satire. But a more mysterious tone takes 
hold when newcomer Franck sees his Selleck-moustachio'd crush commit a terrible 
crime. The riptide of desire drags him into a dangerous game.

Only Lovers Left Alive <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycOKvWrwYFo> (15) 
(Jim Jarmusch, 2013, UK/Ger/Fra/Cyp/US) Tom Hiddleston, Tilda Swinton, Mia 
Wasikowska. 123 mins

Making Twilight look like Sesame Street, Jarmusch gives us the coolest 
vampires imaginable – too cool to even do much vampire stuff. But these lovers 
are great company: retro-snobs surveying the modern world with a sophisticated 
disdain acquired over centuries – at least until they're jolted out of their 
comfort zone.

Nymphomaniac <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5YekQnGSIs&bpctr=1392826106> 
Volumes I & II (18)
(Lars von Trier, 2013, Den/Ger/Fra/Bel/UK) Charlotte Gainsbourg, Stellan 
Skarsgård, Stacy Martin. 117/124 mins

A sex odyssey of masturbatory proportions, but mercifully Von Trier is as 
interested in the idea as the act. It meanders between being compelling, 
provocative, theatrical, tragic and downright absurd, as Gainsbourg narrates 
her sorry sexual history, punctuated by Skarsgård's intellectual interjections.

A New York Winter's Tale <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCN1IZpoys> (12A) 
(Akiva Goldsman, 2014, US) Colin Farrell, Jessica Brown Findlay, Russell Crowe. 
118 mins

An epic, magical, century-spanning love story with extra cheese, this sees 
Farrell's thief live 100 years after having his heart stolen by a dying girl. 
Throw in flying horses, mystical miracles, cancer, Will Smith as the devil and 
Crowe doing Oirish, and you've got … a real dog's breakfast.

A World Not Ours <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDIyM8XTWUo> (NC) 
(Mahdi Fleifel, 2012, UK/Leb/Den/UAE) 93 mins

Fleifel gives us an unorthodox view of Palestinian history, revisiting the 
Lebanese refugee camp of his childhood, and bringing comedy, history and music 
to a story of a dispossessed, and frustrated, community.

Stalingrad <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcFJvf1biOs> (15) 
(Fedor Bondarchuk, 2013, Rus) Pyotr Fyodorov, Thomas Kretschmann, Mariya 
Smolnikova. 131 mins

Russia renders its totemic wartime battle almost as a blockbuster disaster 
movie – a Band Of Brothers-style war story with faithful detail, spectacular 
action and improbable romance.

The Godfather: Part II <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJr92K_hKl0> (15) 
(Francis Ford Coppola, 1974, US) Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall. 202 
mins

A new restoration for Coppola's mighty sequel/prequel, expanding on the 
original story at both ends with the same quality throughout. Pacino and De 
Niro in their prime take some beating.

Highway <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o66nNnGZ5Rg> (12A) 
(Imtiaz Ali, 2014, Ind) Randeep Hooda, Alia Bhatt. 133 mins

A kidnap develops into romance over the course of this north India-spanning 
road movie.
