A number of media sources are reporting that astronomers have spotted what may 
bea giant megastructure orbiting a distant star 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2015/oct/16/alien-megastructure-could-explain-mysterious-new-kepler-results>
. Such a thing could only be the work of advanced aliens, capable of 
engineering and building on such a scale that it becomes visible from light 
years away.

In fairness, it’s probably not that 
<http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/10/14/weird_star_strange_dips_in_brightness_are_a_bit_baffling.html>
. That’s just one interpretation of the unusual readings from a certain star, 
and an unlikely one at that. But it’s the most interesting interpretation, so 
obviously it’s getting the most attention.

But even if we haven’t found advanced aliens, that doesn’t mean we never will. 
And once they become aware of us in turn, what’s to stop them from coming to 
visit? But this isn’t necessarily a bad thing; tourism and leisure are great 
for an economy, and this would be a whole new market. Alien visitors should be 
encouraged, so here’s a brief not-so-lonely-planet guide for aliens vacationing 
on Earth.

ARRIVAL

Earth is a charming blue-green world on the outskirts of the main galaxy 
<http://www.universetoday.com/65601/where-is-earth-in-the-milky-way/>, away 
from the more busy regions. This does mean the infrastructure for accommodating 
spaceship arrival is very limited. You will be expected to make your own way to 
the planet’s surface. Remember to avoid thefragile satellite network 
<http://www.popsci.com/now-you-can-see-all-space-junk-floating-around-earth-real-time>
 when doing so, and do bear in mind that the atmosphere is quite dense 
(increasingly so) so entering it canbecome incredibly hot if you enter at 
certain angles <http://science.howstuffworks.com/spacecraft-reentry.htm>. 

Please use common sense when arriving at Earth; remember the restrictions and 
abilities of your craft and adhere to them wisely, and try not to arrive in to 
obvious or elaborate a fashion or, upon landing, you’ll find yourself 
surrounded by the local life forms, who will try to steal your craft/dissect you

ACCOMODATION

Earth offers a wide variety of environments for any beings capable of existing 
ina nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere 
<http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html>. Empty spaces 
can usually be found in any of the differing climates, but try to avoid themore 
densely populated areas 
<http://www.kickassfacts.com/17-densely-populated-places-earth/> if you haven’t 
beenthoroughly vaccinated <http://www.vaccines.gov/basics/protection/> or find 
the odour of human sweat unpleasant. Those visitors who photosynthesise are 
advised to stick to the Polar Regions where sunlight isavailable for far longer 
than more equatorial regions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_sun>.

If you’re willing to travel further out, the Sol system has an excellent 
selection of planets to cater for the more exotic metabolisms. Venus is ideal 
for those more used toextreme heat and pressure 
<http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/43-What-is-the-atmosphere-of-Venus-like->
, whereas Mars is better for visitors from more arid climates (although they 
havejust installed water 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/28/nasa-scientists-find-evidence-flowing-water-mars>
). There is also a choice of 4 gas giants, andPluto is a delightful place 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/15/pluto-as-we-know-it-now-nasa-report-unwraps-enigma-of-dwarf-planet>
 for anyone who prefers temperatures around absolute zero.

If you want to stay on Mercury, you’d be advised to book ahead; its small size 
means it tends to fill up fast due to theexcellent views of the Sun 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)>.

 Travelling across space at the speed of light and beyond can cause serious

TRANSPORT

You would be advised to rely on your own forms of transport if you wish to see 
as much of Earth as possible. While there are many transport systems in place, 
operating via road, rail, sea and air, they tend tovary considerably from place 
to place 
<http://gadling.com/2011/11/11/10-unique-modes-of-transportation-around-the-world/>
 and end up being very confusing for anyone not familiar with the 
society/technology/gravity.

Your own craft would be essential if you wish to explore any of the other 
planets in the system. The fastest human vehicles still takeseveral months to 
get to the nearest planet 
<http://www.universetoday.com/14841/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-mars/>, so 
these aren’t going to be any use for a relaxing day trip.

FOOD

Earth has the best selection of foodstuffs you could hope to find anywhere. 
The varying climates give rise to anabundance of different edible plants 
<http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5609e/y5609e02.htm> and animal species, and the 
human inhabitants have worked out countless interesting ways to prepare these 
for consumption. Anywhere you go on the planet, you’re likely to find something 
edible and enjoyable.

For any silicon-based life forms, Earth also offers a wide variety of rock 
types <http://jersey.uoregon.edu/~mstrick/AskGeoMan/geoQuerry13.html>, rich in 
minerals and delicious crystal formations.

A word of warning for the alien visitor; although they may be the most 
numerous species and made up of many useful proteins, please do not eat any of 
the humans. If you do this and are discovered, it’s very likely the rest of the 
humans will declare war on you and your species. They have a habit of doing 
this. This may be of no consequence to you given their primitive technology, 
but it will make for a far less relaxing holiday.

You can help yourself to rats 
<http://www.animalplanet.com/wild-animals/10-worst-rat-cites-in-the-world/> 
though.

CULTURE

Earth is home to humanity, the most sophisticated of the species that inhabit 
it. Humans have a wide variety of cultures and practices to intrigue the 
curious visitor. There are anabundance of religions 
<http://www.humanreligions.info/religions.html> to investigate, different 
cities and dwellings, and numerous means of interaction.

Until recently, humans generally preferred to interact with each other via the 
medium of wars 
<http://www.datesandevents.org/events-timelines/24-timeline-of-war.htm> (see 
above). These days, things have calmed down somewhat and most humans tend to 
communicate via shiny rectangles, which arehighly prized in many cultures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gallery/2014/sep/19/apple-queue-iphone-6-plus-store-in-pictures>
. This is facilitated by the internet, which has resulted in a resurgence of 
the particularly bizarre humanhabit of worshipping cats

THE SIGHTS

There is much to see on Earth. Numerous exotic animal species inhabit the 
planet (although be sure to see these quick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/21/mass-extinction-science-warning>
). Vast bodies of glorious ice can be seen at the poles (although be sure to 
see these quick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/26/collapse-antarcticas-glaciers-ice-melt-sooner-than-thought-scientists-warn>
). Particularly of interest is a total eclipse. Earth has the extremely rare 
privilege of having its single moon be at a distance that makes it the exact 
same size in the sky as the sun, meaning it cancover it entirely when the 
alignment is right 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/find_out/guides/tech/solar_eclipses/newsid_2543000/2543767.stm>
.Be sure to plan ahead for this though 
<http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list.html>.

Failing that, Peter Andre is performing his swing tour in Cardiff this coming 
March 
<http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/strictly-star-peter-andre-bring-10244894>
. Might be worth a look.

Dean Burnett still can’t understand why he didn’t get that job at SETI. He’s
