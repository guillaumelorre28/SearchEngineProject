About 80 descendants of Dr Samuel A Mudd on Friday marked the 150th 
anniversary of his arrival at an isolated Gulf of Mexico fort, where he was 
imprisoned after splinting the broken leg of President Abraham Lincoln’s 
assassin.

Wearing “Free Dr Mudd” T-shirts, the group toured Fort Jefferson, a former 
Union military prison on an island 68 miles west of Key West in the remote Dry 
Tortugas national park. Most visited the cell where Mudd spent four years after 
being convicted as a co-conspirator in Lincoln’s assassination.

The doctor’s great-grandson Tom Mudd, who led the pilgrimage, believes the 
doctor was unaware of John Wilkes Booth’s crime when he treated him.

“You have to really believe that history is not cut in stone,” Tom Mudd said. 
“That history is flexible, it’s pliable – and we sincerely believe that Dr 
Samuel Mudd was innocent.

“That’s why we’re here today – to contest those who have penned Dr Mudd as 
being one of the conspirators in the Lincoln assassination.”

Samuel Mudd left Fort Jefferson, nicknamed the Gibraltar of the Gulf, after 
being granted a pardon in 1869, primarily because of the medical work he did in 
stemming the spread of a yellow fever outbreak. But his conviction was never 
overturned.

“The real champion of the Mudd family was my father, Dr Richard D Mudd,” said 
Tom Mudd of his dad, who waged a seven-decade fight to have his grandfather’s 
name cleared. “My dad, just before he died [in 2002] said, ‘We will never win 
this judicially.’

“But in the court of public opinion, we’re going to win this. As long as there 
is a Mudd alive, we are going to stand as evidence for the innocence of Dr 
Samuel A Mudd and his historic importance.”

Nearly 30 years in the making, from 1846 to 1875, Fort Jefferson was never 
finished nor fully armed and never fired upon. It was abandoned by the army in 
1874 and in 1935, President Franklin D Roosevelt designated the area as a 
national monument.

The monument was expanded in 1983 and, along with six other nearby islands, 
was redesignated as Dry Tortugas national park in 1992.
