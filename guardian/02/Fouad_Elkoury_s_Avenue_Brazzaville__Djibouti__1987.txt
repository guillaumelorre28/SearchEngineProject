Cities

We’re looking at a restaurant in the port city of Djibouti. The image is 
typical of Elkoury’s work: the Lebanese photographer trained as an architect 
and urban space has been a constant feature in his work since he picked up a 
camera in 1979.

Waiting

It’s not certain whether the waiter is expecting any patrons. Is this a moment 
of waiting? Or resigned boredom?

Tension

Elkoury combines a fascination with the mundane aspects of cities with an 
ability to infuse a photograph with philosophical or emotional narratives. In 
this picture, where nothing much seems to be happening, there’s a palpable 
sense of apprehension.

History

The photograph sits in a solo exhibition titled Blues For The Orient. Taken 
from a song by Yusef Lateef, the name reflects the melancholic nature of 
Elkoury’s work, along with his taste for travel, and documenting the history of 
places, and their speculative future.
