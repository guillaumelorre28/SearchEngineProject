A change in the seasons has prompted Allegra to make a cheerful change in 
direction for next week's kitchen clickalong. Following the success of 
February'shearty winter veg curry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/allegra-mcevedy-kitchen-clickalong>
, there's an opportunity next Wednesday to celebrate the arrival of spring with 
some delectable pan-fried salmon accompanied by chilli bulgar and sweet and 
sour veg.

Whilst the very thought of this deliciousness may be sending you dizzy with 
desire, there are ingredients to be bought in preparation.

First of all set your brain a reminder that it all starts at the usual time of 
8pm, on Wednesday 18 March. For those that don't know the drill you'll need a 
computer close at hand, or someone operating a computer nearby so you can 
follow Allegra's calm step-by-step instructions and ask any questions you need 
her to answer. If all goes well, as it surely will, we'll be tucking in at 
about 9 o'clock.
