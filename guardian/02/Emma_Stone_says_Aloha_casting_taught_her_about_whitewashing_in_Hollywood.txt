Emma Stone’s casting as Allison Ng, a character of Hawaiian and Asian 
heritage, in Cameron Crowe’s latest romantic comedy Aloha, received its fair 
share of criticism when the film opened in May. Crowe went so far as toapologize

 “to all who felt this was an odd or misguided casting choice” in ablog post 
<http://www.theuncool.com/2015/06/02/a-comment-on-allison-ng/>. While on a 
press tour for Woody Allen’s Irrational Man, which opens on Friday, Stone for 
the first time addressed the controversy in an interview with anAustralian news 
site

.

“I’ve become the butt of many jokes,” she said, referring to her role in Aloha 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/aloha>. “I’ve learned on a macro level about 
the insane history of whitewashing in Hollywood and how prevalent the problem 
truly is. It’s ignited a conversation that’s very important.”

Emma Stone: the whitest Asian person Hollywood could find

In defense of her casting, she offered: “The character was not supposed to 
look like her background which was a quarter Hawaiian and a quarter Chinese.”

Made for roughly $40m, Aloha has grossed approximately $20m in the US since 
opening on 12 July; not a terrible number for a small-scaled romantic comedy, 
but a poor figure for one starring Stone, Bradley Cooper, Rachel McAdams and 
Bill Murray, from the writer/director of Jerry Maguire, which grossed over 
$150m in 1996. The negative reviews Aloha was met with, plus the controversy 
surrounding Stone’s casting, no doubt played a factor in the film’s 
disappointing box office performance.

Stone and Rachel McAdams 
In addition to discussing the Aloha kerfuffle, Stone spoke of the tendency for 
Hollywood to cast young women as the romantic interests for much older men. In 
both Irrational Man and her first film with Allen, Magic in the Moonlight, the 
26-year-old actor was paired up with significantly older male co-stars (Joaquin 
Phoenix in Irrational Man, and Colin Firth in Magic in the Moonlight). The 
glaring age gaps ledVulture 
<http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/emma-jlaw-and-scarletts-older-man-problem.html> 
to highlight the “older-man problem” in a series of charts that showed how 
Stone, and two similarly in-demand actors, Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett 
Johansson, are frequently cast opposite middle-aged screen lovers.

“It’s rampant in Hollywood and it’s definitely been that way for a long time, 
both culturally and in movies,” Stone said. “But inIrrational Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/irrational-man>, the film is contingent upon 
the age difference; the movie is about that disparity. And when I did Magic in 
the Moonlight Colin Firth and I talked about the gap which was huge, 
absolutely, because he was born the same year as my dad.”

She continued: “There’s a lot of conversation about how we want to see people 
represented on screen and what we need to change as a business to reflect 
culture in a clearer way and not in an idealized way. There are some flaws in 
the system... My eyes have been opened in many ways this year.”
