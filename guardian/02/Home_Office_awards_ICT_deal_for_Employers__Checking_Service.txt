The Home Office has awarded Atos <https://www.theguardian.com/society/atos> IT 
Services a contract for a range of services to support the Employers' Checking 
Service (ECS) programme, including a web-based interface, data storage, 
biometric chip reading technology and related support services.

The ECS is run by the UK Border Agency 
<http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/business-sponsors/preventing-illegal-working/support/ecs/>
 and enables employers to check the eligibility of potential employees to work 
in the UK.

According to a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, the 
four-year deal will include "optional future services" to allow remote checks, 
which include biometric chip-reading technology for download and biometric chip 
reading hardware for sale/rent.A tender notice published by the Home Office in 
August 2011 
<https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2011/aug/08/employers-checking-service-technology-tender>
 said the contract would be worth Â£40m, although no value has been attached to 
the award notice.

Atos is expected to provide a high availability interface to handle data 
gathering and staging, and the secure transfer of data to and from the UKBA in 
"near real time". The contract also involves the display of return data, 
history management checks and maintaining data in storage. Atos will also be 
responsible for producing regular management information and managing payments 
from customers.

The notice goes onto say that the deal may be made available to other 
government departments and agencies. The Home Office also expects time may be 
needed to develop the technology.

"UKBA anticipates a period of technological and service development and 
testing after the award of concession and before the service is offered to the 
public," it says.

A spokesman for the Home Office told Guardian Government Computing that the 
government's decision tosplit the UKBA in two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/feb/20/border-agency-split-vine-report?intcmp=239>
 is "unlikely to affect the ECS since it relates to those employees already in 
the UK". He also said that the agency plans to roll out the biometric residence 
permit for all non-European Economic Area migrants later this year.

"Would be employers will be able to use these with the ECS to make sure 
foreign nationals have the right to work in the UK," he added.
