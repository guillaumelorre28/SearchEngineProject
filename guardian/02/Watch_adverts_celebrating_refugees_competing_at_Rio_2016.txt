Nike: ‘Unlimited You’ (starts at 00:04) - US

When they hit their stride, there are few advertisers who can match Nike and 
they’ve pulled something really special out of the locker to launch their 
Olympics campaign. The first minute or so is pretty great but it pales into 
insignificance compared with what follows ... and it’s all held together by a 
spectacularly brilliant voiceover performance from Oscar Isaac.

UNHCR: ‘Champions Against All Odds’ (starts at 02:44) - UK


As the international community descended on Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 
Olympics, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) assembled a 
10-strong team of refugees to give those in a state of flux a symbol of hope. 
This gripping film serves as a trailer for an upcoming documentary on the 
initiative, but it also stands on its own as an accomplished piece of work.

Visa: ‘The Swim’ (starts at 04:22) - US

Further evidence that Rio 2016 is aiming to unite countries during disunited 
times is provided by this advert for Visa. Syrian swimmer Yusra Mardini’s 
journey to the Olympics is unquestionably inspiring – director Siri Bunford 
reminds viewers that this is the young woman who used her prowess in the water 
to rescue a dinghy full of refugees. Connecting this heroism to her 
participation in Rio is a smart way of suggesting that the Olympic ideal isn’t 
merely a figment of a publicist’s imagination. (Though, obviously, it is.)

Donate Life: ‘World’s Biggest Asshole’ (starts at 04:56) - US

US advertising regulators may have to ban this advert promoting organ donation 
if they receive too many complaints. Not because it’s pretty offensive but 
because anyone who’s been watching the news recently will be fully aware that 
it’s misleading ... after all, Coleman F Sweeney is quite a long way behind the 
Republican party’s presidential candidate when it comes to being the “world’s 
biggest asshole”.
