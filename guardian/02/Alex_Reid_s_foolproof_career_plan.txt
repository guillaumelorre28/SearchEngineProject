And finally, let us amble briefly through the mind of cross-dressing 
cagefighter and Mr Katie Price,Alex "The Reidinator" Reid 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Reid_(fighter)>. First, let us record his 
upbeat thoughts on his acting career, namely, "If Sir Ian McKellen can do it, 
then surely it's not such a big deal." "Who was it that played Gandalf in Lord 
of the Rings?" he asked an interviewer. "He was in Coronation Street and look 
how great he is." Lost in Showbiz is similarly amazed by McKellen's 
unprecedented career path. One minute he's getting a start late in life as
supporting actor in the Rovers 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/mar/10/media.uk>, the next thing you 
know, Hollywood comes a-knocking! It's EXACTLY like the guy who played Reg 
Holdsworth suddenly getting the lead in Avatar! Elsewhere in the interview, the 
Reidinator protests about having his words "twisted by the press" and threatens 
to "become more guarded". Lost in Showbiz can only look at him with tearful, 
pleading eyes and beg him to reconsider, noting that a life in which 
cross-dressing cage fighter Alex Reid no longer shares his golden philosophy 
freely with the world would scarcely be worth living.
