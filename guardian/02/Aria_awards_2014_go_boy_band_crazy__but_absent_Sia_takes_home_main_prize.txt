She didn’t swing from the Chandelier, she didn’t even make an appearance, yet 
Sia was still the biggest winner at the 28thAria awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aria-awards>.


The Adelaide singer won four gongs for best pop release, best video, best 
female artist and the biggest award of the night – album of the year for 1000 
Forms of Fear

The notoriously shy pop star, whose big hit Chandelier dominated airwaves this

Another no-show was Iggy Azalea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/iggy-azalea>, who won the Aria for best 
breakthrough artist. She had herFancy 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-zpOMYRi0w> collaborator Charli XCX accept 
the award.

People criticising @IGGYAZALEA <https://twitter.com/IGGYAZALEA> for not coming 
to the#ARIAs2014 <https://twitter.com/hashtag/ARIAs2014?src=hash> but attending 
the#AMAs2014 <https://twitter.com/hashtag/AMAs2014?src=hash>.... Gee I wonder

“I’m going to drop it off to her and she’s going to enjoy it,” Charli XCX said.


Proving they weren’t too big to show their hometown they still cared, Sydney’s 
5 Seconds of Summer were there to open the ceremony with their hit song She 
Looks So Perfect, which earned them the publicly voted Aria for song of the 
year.

“Every single Australian has been behind our band and we’re just from Sydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> and we can’t believe what’s 
happened to us,” Ashton Irwin said.


They weren’t the only big boyband to light up the stage. One Direction  
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/26/at-the-aria-awards-barricades-with-one-direction-fans>
performed their latest hit Steal My Girl and accepted the award for best 
international artist, to whoops and cheers from the crowd – many of whom had 
been waiting since the early hours of Wednesday to catch a glimpse of the 
British stars.

The best group Aria went to Sheppard.


Music industry legend and Countdown host Molly Meldrum was given a standing 
ovation as he was inducted into the Aria hall of fame.


Meldrum became the first non-recording artist to achieve the honour.


“I am just like everyone in this room. I am here because I love music,” he 
said.
