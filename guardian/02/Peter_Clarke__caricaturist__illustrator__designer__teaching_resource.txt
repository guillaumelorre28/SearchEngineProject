Peter Clarke <https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/peter-clarke> 
(1935-2012) started working in Fleet Street in 1958 after a flying accident 
while in the RAF. An ex-pilot friend helped him find the job of cartoon editor 
with the Daily Express. Before joining the Guardian in 1980 he was political 
cartoonist at theDaily Sketch <http://spartacus-educational.com/Jsketch.htm>. 
At 26 he had the distinction of being the youngest political cartoonist ever 
appointed to a national newspaper. His cartoons were described by one critic as 
“wicked perversions”. He later became picture editor at the Daily Mail and in 
the late 1960s he joinedGemini News Service 
<https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/gemini>. He worked all over Africa and 
became managing director of GeminiScan, a subsidiary of Gemini, which produced 
graphics for the news service.

Clarke left Gemini in 1980 and joined the Guardian where he remained until the 
late 1990s.

Clarke’s development as a cartoonist saw him move from pen and ink, pots of 
glue, scalpels and art board to a very creative use of the photocopier and 
finally the Apple Mac. He was the first at the Guardian to use what was then 
the unsophisticated graphics of the computer.

 In one correspondence Clarke explained that “a little known fact of which I 
am inordinately proud” was that in the mid 1980s when he was illustrator, 
cartoonist and graphic designer at the Guardian the managing editor,Ian Wright 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/21/ian-wright-obituary>, requested 
that he did some research and recommend a computer system for the paper. On his 
advice 2 Apple computers were bought and he was given a small office to learn 
how to use them and show to interested parties. For a short period he added 
computer guru to his curriculum vitae. Eventually other people mastered the 
Apple and Peter returned to his pen and ink. He once commented that he wore 
black, “so that the ink splashes won’t show.”

His inventiveness earned him attention and on one occasion a television crew 
filmed him creating portraits of well known personalities using his unique 
combination of technology and handcraft. Peter Clarke created caricatures 
through the manipulation of photographs. Many of these accompanied Monday 
Profile articles and became classics like his John Major, which accompanied Ian 
Aitken’s 1990 profile of him, just before he became Prime Minister.

 Bobby Robson By Peter Clarke Illustration: Peter Clarke 
Robson had been appointed manager in 1982 and was at this point going through 
a very tricky time.

Clarke was also a talented painter of both portraits and landscapes and in 
1968 his work was exhibited alongside David Hockney. He exhibited in many 
modern art exhibitions in the UK and abroad, including theJohn Moores Biennial 
<http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/johnmoores/>. His caricature work 
also appeared in thePremio Satiri Politica <http://www.museosatira.it>, Forte 
dei Marmi in Italy, a show of work by political cartoonists from all over the 
world, in 1992 and 1993.

Also in 1993 he was invited to take part in Fotofeis, a Scottish International 
Festival of Photography. This extensive show included an exhibition dedicated 
to Peter’s caricatures. He was invited to give a lecture on his work while the 
exhibition was in Inverness. Peter chartered and skippered a ketch to get 
there. His efforts were well rewarded with standing room only at the imposing 
Inverness Library.
