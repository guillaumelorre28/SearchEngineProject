If you are tired of tourist bus tours, I can recommend a ride on tram 12. 
There are eleven trams in Antwerp, but this one is the most interesting. Board 
at its terminus at the famous Antwerp courthouse and you are sure to get a seat.

The route begins at the trendy South, where you can see Antwerp in all its 
glory. Tram 12 drives you over the Leien (also called "den Boulevard"), the 
former ramparts of the city. You pass the nice building of the National Bank 
and the beautifulopera house <http://www.vlaamseopera.be> on Frankrijklei. Then 
you'll see the impressive Central Station.

By now the tram is probably full of people, and you will be travelling into a 
very different part of Antwerp. First: the notorious De Coninckplein. On this 
square addicts and tramps gather. But remember: behind the glass you are safe! 
From here Tram 12 goes on through the poor part of Antwerp where around 161 
different nationalities live.

Eventually you'll get to the Sportpaleis <http://www.sportpaleis.be/>, the big 
arena for events (Proximus Diamond Games, concerts). On its way back Tram 12 
also shows you Chinatown and a piece of Africa. Although it doesn't travel 
through the old city centre it does give the visitor a deeper insight into the 
city.

Tip: A 10-ride card (€8 (£7)) is valid for 10 rides on all city trams for one 
hour.

If you find yourself around the Porta Romana area, this is a good honest 
restaurant to try. I would recommend it as a place to take a small group of 
friends.

They do some good pasta and the pizza isn't bad. Last time I had the 
pappardelle with trevisano and speck and it was very tasty. The range of pasta 
with seafood is also recommended. Good news if you are on a budget – the house 
wine is usually good quality, not always the case in some restaurants.

The waiters can try to joke around a bit, and sometimes their humour is a 
little strange, but regardless, you should enjoy a meal here.

Romana; +39 (0)258312871; Three-course meal with wine €35; Open 7-11pm daily.

Paris: Reclining chairs – enjoy a 'sieste' in public gardens

Green spaces in Paris are divided into parcs, which are big and generally in 
peripheral areas, and jardins which are smaller, more central and beautifully 
decorated by palaces and statues, but generally have no – or very little – 
grass to lie on.

But to me, what makes a critical difference is that in the jardins, you can 
find the greatest piece of (urban) furniture on earth – the reclining Chaise 
Luxembourg. Having a nap on one of these reclining chairs is a must during a 
stay in Paris.

You can find them in the Jardin du Luxembourg 
<http://www.spottedbylocals.com/paris/jardin-du-luxembourg-park>, but also in 
Tuileries (pictured) andJardins du Palais Royal Paris 
<http://www.spottedbylocals.com/paris/jardins-du-palais-royal/>, close to the 
ponds and fountains, the edge of which is an excellent place to stretch your 
legs.

If all chairs are already occupied when you arrive (as often happens at Palais 
Royal):
1) Don't give up by taking another uncomfortable straight chair. 
2) Walk around the pool and carefully observe everyone who is sitting on these 
chairs, using your psychological skills to guess when they might leave.
3) Be the first (run, jump, fight if necessary) when a chair becomes available 
again (usually you won't wait more than five or 10 minutes).
4) Forget gallantry and courtesy towards old people (after all, they can come 
back whenever they want if they're retired).
5) Enjoy! You won't regret it.

Stockholm: Valand – the no 1 retro cafe in Stockholm

Ten years ago Sara, a friend of mine, introduced me to this incredible retro 
experience: at Valand nothing has changed since opening in 1954. Everything, 
from theSvenskt Tenn <http://www.svenskttenn.se/> bracket lamps, the Italian 
stone floor and dark wood panels to the selection and presentation of cakes and 
sandwiches are authentic.

So forget about caffe lattes or paying for your coffee with a credit card – at 
Valand you'll be reminded of how recent the North American/Italian coffee 
culture is to Stockholm's cafe scene. Apparently, the only thing that has 
changed since the 50s is the opening hours; back in the day Valand used to be a 
busy hotspot till 11pm.

When television replaced the cinema, the local four theatres closed down and 
Valand became increasingly empty. Now it is a fairly quiet cafe where mostly 
local teens and the odd visitors go. Valand is a true original and a great 
place for a quiet drink or to indulge in a bit of nostalgia.

• Details about this spot: Valand, Surbrunnsgatan 48, Vasastan. Coffee & tea, 
SEK 25 (£2.35); Mon-Fri 8am-7pm, Sat 9am-5pm.Show on map

Warsaw: Przysmak – the taste of childhood

My first and sweetest memories of a bar in Warsaw are connected to this place. 
My father used to come here for "obiad" (Polish for lunch, but in Poland obiad 
is usually bigger than supper) so I knew the name. Many years passed, my father 
became a great cook himself so lunches at Przysmak are no longer needed.

However, this is still one of my favourite bars for a budget lunch. It is 
located in a flat, which means there is not much space and you sit next to 
people you don't know. There is a huge pot of "Kompot", the drink usually 
served for lunch in Poland, on a windowsill.

The thing that is most important to me, however, is that the ladies working in 
the kitchen and behind the till, can still remember my father and I am always 
called Andrzej's daughter. I don't know many places that can compete with that 
personal service, at least not in Warsaw.
