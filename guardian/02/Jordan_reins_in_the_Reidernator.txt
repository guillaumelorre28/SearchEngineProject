Now for an update on Alex Reid <https://www.theguardian.com/media/alex-reid>, 
Earth's most suggestible human. This week, his wife made him sack his manager, 
after Jordan deemed his booking for the cover of a gay magazine desperately 
infra dig. Whether she feels Alex is more Vanity Fair we shall soon find out, 
as she is now repping him herself – a move recalling the moment in Spinal Tap 
when Jeanine takes over management of the band. Katie was pictured flying out 
to LA to join Alex and assume control over his career, raising the possibility 
that the scriptwriters on her unscripted ITV2 show might soon insert the line: 
"If I told them once, I told them a thousand times . . . It's Reidernator 
first, puppet show second."

(Incidentally, Lost in Showbiz has noticed the styling "Reidinator" creeping 
into dispatches of late, and asks for this practice to cease at once. It's 
Reidernator. Alex specifically chose the imbecile's spelling. Come on, 
newspapers – if you're getting this wrong, then what else are you lying about?)
