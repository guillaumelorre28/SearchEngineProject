Today L, for legacy systems... which needed to be removed if we were to be 
productive. Just adding shiny new things would only add to our workload if we 
didn't also get rid of the old ones.

In fact the most significant legacy systems needed to be removed (or at least 
isolated) before we could even start R2. These included internal dependencies 
on an unsupported browser, a cumbersome (and imminently unsupported) 
application server, and a particularly insidious database table.

Eliminating these was not a glamorous job by external standards, but it was a 
necessary one. And significantly it allowed us to prove and improve our Agile 
skills. Each project was more complicated than the one before. By the time we 
got to the last of these we believed we really could undertake the largest 
software project since the website began.
