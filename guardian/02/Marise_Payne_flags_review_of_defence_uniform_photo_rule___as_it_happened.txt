That’s it from me and him. Him being Mr Bowers. 

 * Parakeelia dominated the political day, with skerricks dribbling out of the 
Liberal party but no definitive statements on the donations/payments made from 
the data company to the party. Shorten increased the pressure today, urging 
Malcolm Turnbull to say whether his allowance had been paid to Parakeelia. 
Labor confirmed its MPs pay their software fees straight to head office, which 
then pays the Labor company Magenta Linas, which is not owned by the Labor 
party.Oh, for a little transparency

.

 * Malcolm Turnbull has knocked a nascent push for Tony Abbott to return to 
the ministry on the head. Peta Credlin says the initial story in the Fin was a 
bit of stirring the pot from within the Coalition. Abbott says he is not going 
into the ministry FYI.

 * Turnbull has also defended Ziggy Switkowski, his appointee as chair of 
NBNCo, for writing an opinion piece during the election campaign which broke 
caretaker conventions. He was defending his staff, says Turnbull. “You have to 
remember, he is a very experienced man, Ziggy.”

 * The Coalition and Labor have agreed on the need for a review of defence 
rules which mean servicemen and women can’t be photographed in their uniforms 
for political careers. Both Mike Kelly resigned from reserve forces andHastie 
was sacked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/09/andrew-hastie-sacked-from-army-reserve-for-wearing-uniform-in-campaign-ads>
 for appearing in campaign material.

 * Tomorrow, the News/Facebook debate at 6pm, just as every innovative young 
person is settling on the lounge for a Friday night in. 
Thanks for your company. It’s been a gas. Call Walquist will be back here in 
the early morning, followed by Katharine Murphy.


Goodnight.

Sky commentator and former Abbott chief of staff Peta Credlin has been asked 
about the story that Abbott should return to the ministry. She says a 
“benevolent” interpretation is it was a “loose yarn” in the midde of an 
election campaign.

The less benevolent take is this is a little bit of stirring the pot from the 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> side.

In other words, a way of definitely ruling out a return by Tony Abbott to the 
ministry.

House of Cards.

Attorney general George Brandis is speaking with David Speers about Orlando 
and terrorism. Brandis says Australians should praiseJohn Howard for our gun 
laws. He updates figures.

 * 110 Australians are estimated to be fighting with Islamist terrorist 
organisations, primarily Islamic State.

 * 54-61 people engaged in fighting have been killed.

 * 40 people engaged in war have returned.

 * 190 people in Australia under surveillance and investigation for 
invovlement with terrorism recruitment/financing.

Brandis says the government has been advised to keep the terrorist threat at 
the same level. He says the nature of the problem has stabilised but its 
incorrect to say the problem has eased.

The whole asylum seeker thing passed me by today. I admit I may have been 
diverting my eyes, after the Daily Telegraph front page story:

LABOR’S MESSAGE TO ASYLUM SEEKERS: WELCOME. 


The breathy “revelations” have been Labor policy for quite some time. They are 
on theparty’s website <http://www.alp.org.au/asylumseekers> and have been 
around since last year as far as I can tell. This is from the website:

Abolishing Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs)

Labor will abolish TPVs which keep people in a permanent state of limbo. Labor 
will commit to processing people as quickly as possible and placing those found 
to be genuine refugees on permanent protection visas.

loathing on asylum seekers. Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP 
The Tele story has mentioned the party’s national security advisor Mike Kelly, 
who is Labor’s candidate in Eden Monaro and a former MP for the bellwether 
seat. It said Kelly opposed boat turnbacks.
 Flags up: Peter Dutton. Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP 
 Later in the morning, Peter Dutton did a Scott Morrison-style attack press 
conference to back in the front page. He also told shock jockRay Hadley that 
Kelly had a chance of winning Eden-Monaro. Is that what all this fear and 
loathing is about? Saving Eden-Monaro?

Parakeelia has other clients...

This is the only conclusion I can draw from this exchange between Sky’s Laura 
Jayes and Liberal trade minister Steve Ciobo.

Jayes: But the Labor party – yes, there is a big difference because the Labor 
party’s platform doesn’t donate half a million - well, I think it’s yeah, 
$500,000 back to theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party>.

Ciobo: So what because the Labor party company is – makes less money, the 
Labor party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> company 
clearly is worse at business, that’s in some way a problem for the Coalition? I 
don’t think so.

Jayes: No, but this is a money go-round essentially.

Ciobo: No, no, it’s not. They’re two entirely separate things.

Jayes: Well Parakeelia doesn’t service anyone but the Liberal Party.

Ciobo: Well that’s your assertion, I’m not sure that’s correct. The fact is 
that the Labor party and all members of the Labor party contribute to a company 
that they use, and all members of the Liberal party contribute to a company 
that we use.

Canberra political blogger Paula Matthewson has reminded me of the case, 
reported byAAP in the SMH 
<http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/ACTU-allowed-to-use-electoral-roll-info/2007/06/21/1182019277659.html>
, when Howard government ministerGary Nairn asked the Australian Electoral 
Commission to investigateMagenta Linus. Here is the story: 

The electoral watchdog has dismissed a federal government complaint about the 
ACTU using electoral roll details to target voters in marginal seats.

Special minister of state Gary Nairn asked the Australian Electoral Commission 
to investigate whether the Labor Party’s database manager, Magenta Linas, had 
broken the law by passing on personal information about voters to the union 
body.

The ACTU is planning a sophisticated campaign to recruit union members in 
marginal seats as activists against the government’s industrial relations laws 
in the lead-up to this year’s election.

Mr Nairn queried whether it was legal for the Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> to pass on the 
electoral roll details to a third party.

The AEC on Thursday ruled that electoral roll information given to political 
parties was “protected information” under section 91B of the Commonwealth 
Electoral Act.

“Protected information provided to political parties may be used for any 
purpose in connection with an election or referendum under the Act,” the AEC 
said.

“As a federal election will take place at some stage this year, there is clear 
evidence that the ACTU campaign ... is intended to influence voters, and is a 
purpose in connection with an election and as such does not breach the Act.”

And while we are on land usage, Lock the Gate has commissioned a survey of 
1,135 residents across South Australia which found 82.3% of the community are 
concerned about the threats of shale gas fracking to water supplies and rich 
farming land.

The poll also found:

 *  74.9% of South Australians believe landholders should have the right to 
say ‘no’ to fracking, including 71.1% of Liberal voters; and

 * 67% of people in the state would support a moratorium on fracking in South 
Australia while more research is done to ensure it will not damage water and 
important agricultural industries, including winemaking. Facebook

Those who watched the Tamworth Q&A might remember the first questioner wanted 
answers from both sides on what governments could do on alleged contamination 
from CSG wells. Joyce said it was a state issue but Fitzgibbon said if there 
was evidence, something should be done. Here is the upshot on Joyce’s Facebook

Weekly Times reporter Natalie Kotsios 
<http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/politics/nationals-stalwart-urges-voters-to-preference-mcgowan-over-mirabella/news-story/0aea7f425a1d5eb85ec3bba98bbe12df>
 reports:

A National party stalwart is encouraging voters to ignore the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> agreement in Indi and 
give their second preference to Cathy McGowan over the Liberal candidate Sophie 
Mirabella.

Former state MP Ken Jasper’s call is another blow to Mrs Mirabella’s shot at 
regaining the north east Victorian seat — and was met by disgust by senior 
Liberals in the region, labelling him a “rogue” and suggested he should be 
expelled from the Nats.

Mr Jasper — who held the Victorian Parliament seat of Murray Valley for 40 
years for the Nationals — made headlines during the last federal election when 
he famously backed Ms McGowan over Mrs Mirabella, giving the independent a 
significant boost.

Jasper supported McGowan in the 2013 election (when there was no National 
party candidate). Now the Nationals have Marty Corboy running, he is doing the 
next best thing for McGowan by suggesting National voters preference her.

That’s it from me and him. Him being Mr Bowers. 

 * Parakeelia dominated the political day, with skerricks dribbling out of the 
Liberal party but no definitive statements on the donations/payments made from 
the data company to the party. Shorten increased the pressure today, urging 
Malcolm Turnbull to say whether his allowance had been paid to Parakeelia. 
Labor confirmed its MPs pay their software fees straight to head office, which 
then pays the Labor company Magenta Linas, which is not owned by the Labor 
party.Oh, for a little transparency

.

 * Malcolm Turnbull has knocked a nascent push for Tony Abbott to return to 
the ministry on the head. Peta Credlin says the initial story in the Fin was a 
bit of stirring the pot from within the Coalition. Abbott says he is not going 
into the ministry FYI.

 * Turnbull has also defended Ziggy Switkowski, his appointee as chair of 
NBNCo, for writing an opinion piece during the election campaign which broke 
caretaker conventions. He was defending his staff, says Turnbull. “You have to 
remember, he is a very experienced man, Ziggy.”

 * The Coalition and Labor have agreed on the need for a review of defence 
rules which mean servicemen and women can’t be photographed in their uniforms 
for political careers. Both Mike Kelly resigned from reserve forces andHastie 
was sacked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/09/andrew-hastie-sacked-from-army-reserve-for-wearing-uniform-in-campaign-ads>

 * Tomorrow, the News/Facebook debate at 6pm, just as every innovative young 
person is settling on the lounge for a Friday night in. 
Thanks for your company. It’s been a gas. Call Walquist will be back here in 
the early morning, followed by Katharine Murphy.


Goodnight.
 
Sky commentator and former Abbott chief of staff Peta Credlin has been asked 
about the story that Abbott should return to the ministry. She says a 
“benevolent” interpretation is it was a “loose yarn” in the midde of an 
election campaign.

The less benevolent take is this is a little bit of stirring the pot from the 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> side.

In other words, a way of definitely ruling out a return by Tony Abbott to the 
ministry.

House of Cards. 
 
As a Queenslander, Brandis says the government’s jobs and growth message is 
cutting through. BTW.
 
Attorney general George Brandis is speaking with David Speers about Orlando 
and terrorism. Brandis says Australians should praiseJohn Howard for our gun 
laws. He updates figures.

 * 110 Australians are estimated to be fighting with Islamist terrorist 
organisations, primarily Islamic State.

 * 54-61 people engaged in fighting have been killed.

 * 40 people engaged in war have returned.

 * 190 people in Australia under surveillance and investigation for 
invovlement with terrorism recruitment/financing.

Brandis says the government has been advised to keep the terrorist threat at 
the same level. He says the nature of the problem has stabilised but its 
incorrect to say the problem has eased.

The breathy “revelations” have been Labor policy for quite some time. They are 
on theparty’s website <http://www.alp.org.au/asylumseekers> and have been 
around since last year as far as I can tell. This is from the website:

Abolishing Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs)

Labor will abolish TPVs which keep people in a permanent state of limbo. Labor 
will commit to processing people as quickly as possible and placing those found 
to be genuine refugees on permanent protection visas.

The Tele story has mentioned the party’s national security advisor Mike Kelly, 
who is Labor’s candidate in Eden Monaro and a former MP for the bellwether 
seat. It said Kelly opposed boat turnbacks.

 Later in the morning, Peter Dutton did a Scott Morrison-style attack press 
conference to back in the front page. He also told shock jockRay Hadley that 
Kelly had a chance of winning Eden-Monaro. Is that what all this fear and 
loathing is about? Saving Eden-Monaro?

Paul Karp has written a story drawing together the threads 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/16/malcolm-turnbull-has-questions-to-answer-over-parakeelia-funds-says-shorten>
 on Parakeelia and Magenta Linas.
 
This is the only conclusion I can draw from this exchange between Sky’s Laura 
Jayes and Liberal trade minister Steve Ciobo.

Jayes: But the Labor party – yes, there is a big difference because the Labor 
party’s platform doesn’t donate half a million - well, I think it’s yeah, 
$500,000 back to theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party>.

Ciobo: So what because the Labor party company is – makes less money, the 
Labor party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> company 
clearly is worse at business, that’s in some way a problem for the Coalition? I 
don’t think so.

Jayes: No, but this is a money go-round essentially.

Ciobo: No, no, it’s not. They’re two entirely separate things.

Jayes: Well Parakeelia doesn’t service anyone but the Liberal Party.

Ciobo: Well that’s your assertion, I’m not sure that’s correct. The fact is 
that the Labor party and all members of the Labor party contribute to a company 
that they use, and all members of the Liberal party contribute to a company 
that we use.
 
Canberra political blogger Paula Matthewson has reminded me of the case, 
reported byAAP in the SMH 
<http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/ACTU-allowed-to-use-electoral-roll-info/2007/06/21/1182019277659.html>
, when Howard government ministerGary Nairn asked the Australian Electoral 
Commission to investigateMagenta Linus. Here is the story: 

The electoral watchdog has dismissed a federal government complaint about the 
ACTU using electoral roll details to target voters in marginal seats.

Special minister of state Gary Nairn asked the Australian Electoral Commission 
to investigate whether the Labor Party’s database manager, Magenta Linas, had 
broken the law by passing on personal information about voters to the union 
body.

The ACTU is planning a sophisticated campaign to recruit union members in 
marginal seats as activists against the government’s industrial relations laws 
in the lead-up to this year’s election.

Mr Nairn queried whether it was legal for the Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> to pass on the 
electoral roll details to a third party.

The AEC on Thursday ruled that electoral roll information given to political 
parties was “protected information” under section 91B of the Commonwealth 
Electoral Act.

“Protected information provided to political parties may be used for any 
purpose in connection with an election or referendum under the Act,” the AEC 
said.

“As a federal election will take place at some stage this year, there is clear 
evidence that the ACTU campaign ... is intended to influence voters, and is a 
purpose in connection with an election and as such does not breach the Act.”
 
And while we are on land usage, Lock the Gate has commissioned a survey of 
1,135 residents across South Australia which found 82.3% of the community are 
concerned about the threats of shale gas fracking to water supplies and rich 
farming land.

The poll also found:

 *  74.9% of South Australians believe landholders should have the right to 
say ‘no’ to fracking, including 71.1% of Liberal voters; and

 * 67% of people in the state would support a moratorium on fracking in South 
Australia while more research is done to ensure it will not damage water and 
important agricultural industries, including winemaking.  
Those who watched the Tamworth Q&A might remember the first questioner wanted 
answers from both sides on what governments could do on alleged contamination 
from CSG wells. Joyce said it was a state issue but Fitzgibbon said if there 
was evidence, something should be done. Here is the upshot on Joyce’s Facebook 
page.

 reports:

A National party stalwart is encouraging voters to ignore the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> agreement in Indi and 
give their second preference to Cathy McGowan over the Liberal candidate Sophie 
Mirabella.

Former state MP Ken Jasper’s call is another blow to Mrs Mirabella’s shot at 
regaining the north east Victorian seat — and was met by disgust by senior 
Liberals in the region, labelling him a “rogue” and suggested he should be 
expelled from the Nats.

Mr Jasper — who held the Victorian Parliament seat of Murray Valley for 40 
years for the Nationals — made headlines during the last federal election when 
he famously backed Ms McGowan over Mrs Mirabella, giving the independent a 
significant boost.

Jasper supported McGowan in the 2013 election (when there was no National 
party candidate). Now the Nationals have Marty Corboy running, he is doing the 
next best thing for McGowan by suggesting National voters preference her.
