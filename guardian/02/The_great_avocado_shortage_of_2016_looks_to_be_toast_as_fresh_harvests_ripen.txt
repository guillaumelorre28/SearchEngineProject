The rise in prices caused consternation among those in the avocado industry, 
who flung accusations back-and-forth about who was responsible.

Reports initially blamed wet weather and bushfires in Western Australia for 
the shortage.

However, a former chief executive of Avocados Australia told Fairfax Media 
<http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/the-truth-behind-the-avocado-shortage-growers-made-innocent-mistake-20160125-gmdbvw.html>
 that growers had tried to manipulate the market by ripening an unusually large 
number before Christmas, leaving a shortage after the holiday.

But avocado growers in Western Australia quickly hit back 
<http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/avocado-growers-reject-market-manipulation-claims-amid-national-shortage-20160126-gmem47.html>
, saying the prices were simply driven by weather and unusually high demand.

Whatever the case, the great avocado shortage of 2016 looks set to end. 
Avocados from Bundaberg in Queensland are about to hit shelves around the 
country, followed by avocados from Cairns,according to News Limited

.

The current chief executive of Avocados 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/avocados> Australia, John Tyas, said 
when that happened, prices would tumble. But he warned it could be hard for 
growers to keep up with local demand.

“Australians seem to be having a love affair with avocados and it shows no 
sign of stopping, Tyastold News Limited

.

 “Even with 1m trees in the ground and many new plantings, we still think 
demand will continue to grow.”
