“I don’t write protest songs in the traditional sense,” says Samantha Crain, 
of her fourth album, “but I’m always listening to the voices of people around 
me. These stories are told from the perspective of the underdog, the 99% of us 
that are working people. They might not be literal protest songs, but the lives 
of the people within these songs speak at the same volume if you listen.”

Under Branch & Thorn & Tree follows 2014’s Kid Face and boasts a musicality as 
gently beguiling as the lyrics. A merging of country (Big Rock) and folk 
(Kathleen) styles, it occasionally strays into stranger territory, such as the 
queasy synth lines that run through opener Killer.
