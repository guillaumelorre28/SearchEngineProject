Two British terror suspects who were extradited to the US after an eight-year 
legal battle plan to change their pleas to guilty next week, a US court has 
said.

Babar Ahmad <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/babar-ahmad> and Syed Talha Ahsan 
faced trial after denying charges of providing material support to terrorists 
but have arranged a "change of plea hearing" at the US district court in 
Connecticut on Tuesday, a clerk at the court confirmed. Ahmad, 38, and Ahsan, 
34, are accused of running websites that allegedly sought to raise money, 
recruit fighters and seek equipment for terrorists in Afghanistan and Chechnya.

The two men, both from London, are accused of operating a network of internet 
sites known as Azzam Publications that attracted worldwide support to the 
jihadist cause.

Ahmad and Ahsan are being prosecuted in the US because of the role American 
authorities played in shutting down the Azzam network.

The men attempted to challenge the extradition in British courts and later in 
theEuropean court of human rights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/european-court-of-human-rights>, as the 
offences were committed in the UK. They were extradited to the US a year ago 
with three other men, including radical preacher Abu Hamza.
