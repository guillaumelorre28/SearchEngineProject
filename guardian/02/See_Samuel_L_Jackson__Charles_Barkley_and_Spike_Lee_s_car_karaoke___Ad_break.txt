Capital One: ‘The Piña Colada Song’ (starts at 00:04) - US

If you’ve ever wanted to see Samuel L Jackson, Charles Barkley and Spike Lee 
singing along to Rupert Holmes’s Escape (aka The Piña Colada Song) then your 
luck’s in. In an advert directed by the last-named of this illustrious trio,

Aldi: ‘Easter Gorilla’ (starts at 00:39) - UK

After hitting the social media jackpot with its hastily put together spoof of 
John Lewis’s Christmas advert <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzsMiCBzciY>, 
Aldi mines the same seam for its Easter advertising. This time it’sthe 
celebrated Cadbury ‘Gorilla’ advert 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnzFRV1LwIo> that’s on the receiving end of 
the German supermarket’s parody and once again it’s bang on target.

Stella Artois: ‘Sebastian’ (starts at 01:23) - UK

A crazy origin story for the reassuringly expensive Belgian lager has a young 
man called Sebastian Artois selling everything he owns to buy the brewery. It’s 
a fun, high-energy romp ending with a message about pursuing our own dreams ... 
something that may prove difficult if we buy into the core proposition: 
drinking lots of the advertised lager.

Wickes: ‘Treehouse’ (starts at 02:27) - UK

This gentle film positions Wickes as a supportive presence as a grandfather 
and a father build a treehouse for the latter’s son. He watches as they use 
their skills and Wickes’s DIY materials to work together, with Channel 4’s 
George Clarke providing a suitably warm commentary.

Heineken: ‘The Dilemma’ (starts at 03:31) - Italy

This advert for Heineken has the Champions League sponsors asking whether 
loyalty still exists in modern football. For once though, it’s the fans rather 
the players whose fidelity is being questioned. Given the opportunity to 
abandon his mates and take advantage of a VIP ticket, the character at the 
centre of this prank-based film has quite the dilemma.
