Birmingham-based independent production company Maverick Media, the producer 
of Channel 4's 10 Years Younger, has been bought byAll3Media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/all3media>.

The deal for Maverick, which was made for an undisclosed sum, will see the 
firm join All3Media's stable of 11 other production companies - including the 
companies behind Shameless, Richard & Judy, Midsomer Murders and Hollyoaks.

Maverick, which also has an office in London, was founded in 1993 and has 
built its name with factual entertainment shows such as How to Look Good Naked 
and Embarrassing Illnesses.

It has recently moved into drama, with a number of projects in development, 
while its new media division has won the contract for the 4Homes site for 
Channel 4.

The company posted a turnover of £8m last year, up from £6.2m in 2005.

The Maverick managing director, Jim Sayer, said the deal would see the company 
retain its identity while helping it to "grow the business and expand our 
output - both in the UK and abroad".

Steve Morrison, the All3Media chief executive, said: "Maverick is one of 
Britain's best factual and features TV production companies.

"Young people in the industry want to work there as they have such a 
high-quality reputation and modern outlook."

Since it was founded in 2003, All3Media has become one of the UK's biggest 
independent producers.

It also owns an international and format programme distribution arm and has 
offices in the US, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand.
