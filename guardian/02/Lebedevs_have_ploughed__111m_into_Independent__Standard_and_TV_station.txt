Evgeny and Alexander Lebedev have pumped more than £111m into the Independent, 
theLondon Evening Standard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/london-evening-standard> and TV station 
London Live.

 The latest figures from their company Lebedev Holdings Ltd show that the 
total amount they have now poured into their media titlesrose by £18m in a year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/04/lebedevs-100m-into-independent-titles-standard-funding>
.

 It includes £12m in interest-free loans by Russian-born businessman Alexander 
Lebedev, exactly thesame figure as the loss made by London Live 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/29/london-live-makes-12m-loss> 
since its launch in March last year.

 It was a rise on 2013, when he made just under £2m of interest-free loans to 
the company.

The accounts for the year ending 28 September 2014, said: “The amount due to 
Mr Alexander Lebvedev, and companies in which he has an interest, and MrEvgeny 
Lebedev <https://www.theguardian.com/media/evgeny-lebedev> at 28 September 2014 
was £104,798,842 ... plus interest payable of £6,790,763.”

 The accounts also reveal that the group benefited from an interest-free loan 
of £12,487,350 from Daily Mail & General Holdings, the Daily Mail owner which 
has a 24.9% stake in the Evening Standard.

 This week, the Standard announced that it had remained in the black for the 
third consecutive year,reporting a profit of £1.4m

 in 2014.

 The Independent made what it called a “dramatic improvement in its financial 
position”,announcing a trading loss of £4.6m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jun/30/the-independent-trading-losses-evgeny-lebedev>
 in the year up to September 2014.

 It was a big improvement on the £9.1m loss it made the previous year and the 
£22.6m loss it made in 2010-11.

 However, the accounts gave a strong warning about the dependence of the 
company on the generosity of the Lebedevs, noting that the group “relies on the 
continued support of its shareholder lenders in order to continue to trade”.

 It added: ‘The company’s shareholder and lenders have expressed their 
willingness to continue supporting the company as and when required, however 
there is no formal funding facility agreed and therefore there is inherent 
uncertainty as to the continued availability of funding.”

The Lebedevs have continued to back London Live 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/london-live> despite the fact it has 
struggled to pull in audiences and significant advertising revenue and was 
forced to cut a third of its staff earlier this year. The annual accounts said 
the business had “taken further measures to ensure that its cost base is 
minimised.”

 Despite its woes, the business said it was on track to halve its losses in 
the current financial year. London Live’s chief operating officer Tim Kirkman 
said: “We planned to lose money, we will again this year, and next year too. 
But we are pleased with the numbers and London Live is now progressing well.”

The Lebedevs bought the Evening Standard in 2009 for £1 and the Independent 
and Independent on Sunday in 2010.


The Standard – which became a free title in 2010 – increased its distribution 
to 900,000 copies per day last year.
