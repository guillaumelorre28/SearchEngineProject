chopped off the tip of his thumb as he prepared a Sunday dinner for Declan 
Donnelly, it has been reported.

The Geordie presenter, who always appears on the left-hand side of TV screens 
when presenting with Dec, was figuring out how to use a vegetable-slicing 
gadget on Saturday night as he planned to make dauphinoise potatoes the next 
day.

"It was a complete disaster. I ended up slicing the top of my thumb off. God 
it was painful,"McPartlin told the Sun

.

The star went to hospital, hoping that the tip could be stitched back on but 
medics were only able to clean and dress the injury.

He said: "It hurt like hell. There was a lot of blood."

Despite his accident, McPartlin, 38, took to the kitchen the next day and the 
Sunday roast went ahead as planned. He said: "I still got the meal on the 
table."
