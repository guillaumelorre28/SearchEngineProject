After an 18-month walk from his tiny Romanian village, the 27-year old 
sculptor arrived in Paris in 1904 and eventually worked under French star
Auguste Rodin <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/auguste-rodin>.

 In 1907, he left Rodin’s studio saying “Nothing grows under big trees” and 
created The Wisdom of the Earth – a sitting female nude – later selling it to 
the Romanian engineer Gheorghe Romașcu.

 The communist regime seized it in 1957 but Romașcu’s heirs retrieved in 2012 
after a protracted legal battle.

Now, Bucharest has launched a campaign to raise €6m to buy the piece, titled 
Cumințenia pământului in Romanian.

 “I am calling on Romanians to take individual responsibility because I want 
Brâncuși to unite us, not divide us,” the prime minister, Dacian Cioloș, said 
on Thursday.

 The fundraising drive carries the slogan “Brâncuși is mine”. Donations come 
with tax exemptions.

 The government will provide €5m (£3.8m) of the €11m () price tag, hoping to 
raise the rest from Romanians by the end of September.

 “This sculpture – representative for his entire work – is the last one that 
the Romanian state can recover and make accessible to the wider public and art 
lovers,” a government spokesperson said.

 Brâncuși was born in Hobița, near the Carpathian Mountains, but lived in 
Paris for most of his life.

He bequeathed his studio and some of his art to the French state after his 
death in 1957. He had wanted to leave his art toRomania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/romania>, but the then communist government 
declined the offer.

 Little of Brâncuși’s art is in Romania, with the notable exception of an 
open-air ensemble that includes the Endless Column in the city of Târgu Jiu, a 
1937 tribute to soldiers killed during the second world war.

 In 2009 one of his sculptures sold for a record €29m.
