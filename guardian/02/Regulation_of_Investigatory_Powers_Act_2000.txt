Aim

"To make provision 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000023_en_1#Legislation-Preamble> 
for and about the interception of communications, the acquisition and 
disclosure of data relating to communications, the carrying out of 
surveillance, the use of covert human intelligence sources and the acquisition 
of the means by which electronic data protected by encryption or passwords may 
be decrypted or accessed; to provide for commissioners and a tribunal with 
functions and jurisdiction in relation to those matters, to entries on and 
interferences with property or with wireless telegraphy and to the carrying out 
of their functions by the security service, the Secret Intelligence Service and 
the Government Communications Headquarters"

Main provisions

• Regulates the circumstances and methods by which public bodies may carry out 
covert surveillance.
• Lays out a statutory framework to enable public authorities to carry out 
covert surveillance in compliance with the requirements of theHuman Rights Act 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/14/human-rights-act>
.
• Defines five broad categories of covert surveillance: directed surveillance 
(includes photographing people); intrusive surveillance (includes bugging); the 
use of covert human intelligence sources (informants and undercover officers, 
including watching and following people); accessing communications data (record 
of emails sent, telephone calls made) and intercepting communications (ie 
reading content of emails, listening to calls).
• Allows the secretary of state to issue an interception warrant to examine 
the contents of letters or communications on the grounds of national security, 
and for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime, preventing disorder, 
public safety, protecting public health, or in the interests of the economic 
well-being of the United Kingdom. This is the only part of the act thatrequires 
a warrant 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/plain/ukpga_20000023_en#pt1-ch1-pb1-l1g5>.
• Prevents the existence of interception warrants, and any and all data 
collected with them from being revealed in court.
• Allows the police, intelligence services, HM Revenue and Customs (and 
several hundred more public bodies, including local authorities and a wide 
range of regulators) to demand telephone, internet and postal service providers 
to hand over detailed communications records for individual users. This can 
include name and address, phone calls made and received, source and destination 
of emails, internet browsing information and mobile phone positioning data that 
records user's location. These powers are self-authorised by the body 
concerned, with no external or judicial oversight.
• Enables the government to demand that someone hands over keys to protected 
information; and makes it a criminal offence to refuse to supply actual 
encrypted traffic or refuse to disclose an encryption key.
• Enables the government to force internet service providers to fit equipment 
to facilitate surveillance.
• Allows the government to demand an ISP provider provide secret access to a 
customer's communication.
• Makes provisions to establish an oversight regime, creates an investigatory 
powers tribunal andappoints three commissioners

.

Background

The government argued the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act was essential 
to allow law agencies to catch up technologically with the increasingly 
sophisticated tools used by terrorists, drug smugglers and organised criminal 
gangs.

The act granted public bodies wide-ranging powers to conduct surveillance 
including intercepting emails, accessing private communications data, and 
planting and monitoring surveillance devices. The government was keen to push 
the bill through parliament before the Human Rights Act became law in October 
2000 in order to ensure that law agencies had a framework for covert 
surveillance that was compliant with the European convention on human rights.

Jack Straw, home secretary, claimed the bill merely formalised existing 
powers. "Covert surveillance by police 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/638041.stm> and other law enforcement 
officers is as old as policing itself," Straw said. "What is new is that for 
the first time the use of these techniques will be properly regulated by law."

The most controversial elements of the bill were the lack of oversight for the 
powers and the government's decision to require ISPs to fit equipment that 
would allow the police and security services to monitor internet traffic and 
intercept email.

After peers raised concern about the bill's implications for business and 
privacy, the government made a series of concessions tightening definitions 
about the kind of information that police can obtain without a warrant

The bill's lack of detail alarmed members of the House of Lords. Liberal 
Democrat Lord McNally suggested the general powers the bill granted lacked 
sufficient safeguards and the bill would "if misused, would certainly infringe 
on civil liberty".

In response to these fears the government agreed an amendment that required 
them to have detailed codes of practice approved by resolutions in both houses 
of parliament.

When the government sought approval for the order related to communication 
data in 2002, privacy campaigners were dismayed to discover that it proposed
extending access 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2002/jun/12/security.humanrights> to 
communications data to hundreds of public bodies including every local 
authority in the country, fire authorities, Jobcentres, the Gaming Board and 
the Charity Commission.

Privacy lobbyists were outraged by the proposal, which they nicknamed the 
"snooper's charter.Simon Davies 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4431109,00.html>, the 
director of the campaign group Privacy International, said: "The Home Office 
has absolutelybreached its commitment 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/jun/11/privacy.politics> that this law 
would not become a general surveillance power for the government."

The proposed measures were denounced as disproportionate by a cross-party 
campaign of opposition.

Lord Strathclyde, the Tory leader in the Lords, urged the government to 
withdraw the draft order. He added: "We support the war on terrorism. We oppose
district councils and quangos 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1584808/Council-spy-cases-hit-1%2C000-a-month.html>
 being given power to survey private communications."

In the face of sustained opposition 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2000/jun/25/internet.comment> the 
government withdrew the order and presented arevised version 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2003/mar/12/internet.comment> to 
parliament the following year. The new order restricted the types of 
information to which public bodies could have access and the reasons they could 
request such data.

Criticism

Civil liberties groups and privacy campaigners claim the act fails to provide 
adequate safeguards to protect individual privacy and offers no way for an 
individual to obtain effective redress if the powers are abused.

When the act was passed in 2000, only nine organisations, including the police 
and security services, were allowed access to communications records but 
privacy campaigners say that too many public bodies now have access to the 
information. In 2007, there were519,260 requisitions 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/privacy.privacy> of 
communications data from telephone companies and ISPs.

The nickname "snooper's charter 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/jun/05/freedomofinformation>" has 
clung to the act amid widespread public anxiety about the misuse of these 
powers. Concern was heightened in June 2008, when 121 councils revealed they 
had used the legislation during a 12-month period to monitor behaviour by 
examining the private communications of residents.

James Welch, legal director for Liberty, said: "It's one thing to use covert 
surveillance in operations investigating terrorism and other serious crimes, 
but it has come to a pretty pass when this kind of intrusive activity is used 
to police school catchment areas.

"This is a ridiculously disproportionate use of RIPA and will undermine public 
trust in necessary and lawful surveillance."
