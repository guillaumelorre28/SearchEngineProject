I first decided to become an actor at school. A teacher gave us a play to do 
and that had a major impact. At first, I wanted to work in the theatre, but 
there was something about the ambience of film, especially American films, that 
always attracted me.

I was a banker in Morocco when I first saw American Graffiti. It was before I 
was an actor, a melancholy time in my life, and this mood was reflected in the 
film. It is about a group of characters who have one night together before they 
leave town, one night to change their futures. It asks questions about where 
life is going and the transition to becoming an adult and how that changes life 
and your responsibility.

Soon after that, I moved to France. I was born in Casablanca and had a French 
passport. I went to drama school in Paris and started doing theatre with a 
friend. Then I moved into movies and slowly but surely I got roles.

American Graffiti stayed in my mind, but I don't think to this day I've done a 
film that captured that same level of melancholy. It was so well done. Talking 
about it has given me the idea I might try harder to make that melancholy film!
