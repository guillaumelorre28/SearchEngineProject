Worries about a gloomy end to the year offset solid gains for energy stocks on 
Friday and left the FTSE 100 to finish a tumultuous week on a rather dim note.

Pressures from the US snuffed out the FTSE 100's early gains and it closed 
down 32.7 points, or 0.6%, at 5190.2.Disappointing results from American

and General Electric combined with a gloomy US consumer sentiment survey to 
knock stocks around the world. TheDow Jones industrial average was down 1%, or 
almost 100 points, at 9965 by the time London closed.

The losses capped a volatile week that had seen the UK bluechip index slump 1% 
one day and jump 2% the next to set fresh one-year highs, while the Dow Jones 
had pushed through the psychologically important 10,000 mark.

The top riser in a falling market was credit checking group Experian, which 
closed up 16.5p, or 3%, at 570p after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on 
the shares to 610p from 560p.

Supermarkets group J Sainsbury was the FTSE 100's biggest faller, slipping 
back 13.8p, or 4%, to 328.7p having gained 10% on Thursday on revived 
speculation.

Luxury goods group Burberry was also lower as profit-taking set in following 
an ascent to a 22-month high earlier in the week following news of a 
forecast-beating first-half. The handbag specialist finished down 3.4% at 557p 
but it is up more than 140% since the start of the year.

Car insurer Admiral updated the market that it was on track to meet profit 
expectations for 2009 as third-quarter turnover rose 22% on last year to £294m. 
But the shares ended down 30p, or 2.7%, at £10.63.

Analyst Nic Clarke at Charles Stanley said the results were "re-assuring" with 
solid customer and turnover growth. But he added:

"The group does face a number of headwinds. The low interest rate environment 
is hurting the net interest income and marketing spend is being increased 
markedly at Confused.com. Although we were pleased to see that turnover in this 
business has grown strongly in Q3."

High oil prices and the threat of strikes by British Airways staff over the 
key Christmas travel season kept the airline under pressure and it ended down 
6.8p, or 3.1%, at 214.1.

Softer metal prices amid worries about the demand outlook dented miners. 
Kazakhmys fell 37p, or 2.9%, to £12.58 and Fresnillo lost 21.5p, or 2.6%, to 
823p.

Oil prices also slipped from their earlier highs but as US crude remained 
above $77 a barrel, UK energy stocks benefited.Royal Dutch Shell added 21p to 
£18.06 andBP edged up 3.5p to 559.1p.

Carphone Warehouse also managed to outperform the wider market, edging up 0.3p 
to 205.7p after it said its Virgin Mobile France venture had agreed to buy 
Tele2 Mobile France for €56m to add customers and cut operating costs.

Midcap engineering software group Aveva was headed higher after it reported 
first-half trading was ahead of its own expectations, prompting a flurry of 
positive broker notes.

David Toms at Numis Securities raised the shares to a "buy" recommenadtion 
from "hold" saying the company's update "implies that trading iswell ahead of 
our expectations and that this is probably the trough period."

"We view Aveva <https://www.theguardian.com/business/avevagroup> as a top 
quality asset in the sector, with a highly regarded management team," he added.

The shares closed up 46p, or 4.7%, at £10.21.
