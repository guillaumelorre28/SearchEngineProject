Allied Irish Banks <https://www.theguardian.com/business/allied-irish-bank> 
has written to former directors who were at the now nationalised bank during 
the financial crisis asking them to take a voluntary cut to their pensions.

David Duffy, the bank's chief executive, told the Financial Times that more 
than 15 former executives directors who worked at the bank in the lead-up to 
the banking crisis would receive letters over the next four to six weeks. "On a 
moral basis we believe that there is a judgment that some individuals can make 
a contribution," Duffy told the FT.

Former AIB chief executive Eugene Sheehy is reportedly paid a pension of 
€529,000 (£423,000) a year, while former managing director Colm Doherty will 
receive a pension of €300,000 a year on reaching his 65th birthday.

AIB is 99.8% state-owned after it was forced to take a €20bn taxpayer bailout 
last year.

The Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, said this week he had no legal 
power to reduce the pensions of the senior bankers involved in the bank 
bailout. "It is not legally possible for the new Government to put them aside 
but that has been said several times before – there is nothing new in that," he 
said.
