Nope, she isn’t!

Sia has sent a video message, with a now signature stand-in wearing a Sia wig. 
Tonight, doing the duty was US comedian Carrot Top, aka Scott Thompson. It’s a 
very short message, thanking her fans and her team.

This was Sia’s fourth win for the night – two more than Chet Faker. And this 
caps off a big year for the Australian artist,whose sixth studio album reached 
No 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/jul/17/sia-1000-forms-of-fear-no-1-us-album>
 on both the Australian and US charts.

But let’s not forget our favourite Sia stand-in from tonight’s Aria awards

have a champagne or two or five!

Best international artist goes to One Direction, who are followed by the final 
performance of the night:Neil Finn and Paul Kelly, first with Don’t Stand So 
Close to the Window. It’s a short but endearing version, before moving straight 
into Four Seasons in One Day (lighters out, everyone).

Katy Perry presents for best female artist, first prefacing that she’s become 
a sort of “honorary Australian” over the last few weeks while she’s been 
touring the country:

“No longer will I use straws in my chocolate milk, I will use Tim Tams. No 
longer will I spread my bread with butter, I will use Vegemite. No longer will 
I eat just plain old chicken, I’ll eat kangaroo. Actually that is disgusting. 
Why do guys you eat the thing that’s actually on one of your flags? Very weird.”

Sia wins the award but the media-shy singer is in Los Angeles and Perry says 
as she is on her way there she can hand-deliver the pyramid.

Although, giant tassel aside, she still has a long way to go in the 
death-stare stakes before she rivals foreign minister Julie Bishop.

Best male artist has been given to Chet Faker, his second win of the night (he 
was up for nine awards altogether). Things we learned from his speech: he went 
to school with fellow nominees Vance Joy and his school counsellor said he 
shouldn’t pursue music as a career.

One Direction are on stage with Steal My Girl. 

I wonder if the Arias tried to get both boy bands on stage at the same time – 
a 1D meets 5SOS boy band orgy? You’d probably be at risk of triggering a mass 
wave of teen girl heart attacks. The kids are so damn cute. They ooze high 
school heartbreak.

Entertainment reporter Angela Bishop (daughter of House of Representatives

Kelly cites Crowded House’s Into Temptation, Fall at Your Feet and Distant Sun. 
Neil Finn waxes about How to Make Gravy – “It’s a song that’s deeply emotional” 
– and You Can Put Your Shoes Under My Bed.

Here’s the pair serenading the Sydney

John Butler is presenting best adult contemporary album and picking up the 
award are two titans of Antipodean music –Neil Finn and Paul Kelly – for their 
live album Goin’ Your Way, which features the musos celebrating each other’s 
songs.

We’re absolutely digging Paul Kelly’s purple suit.

Kind of amazing that we’re looking at a century worth of incredible 
songwriting talent; musical royalty that have outlasted so very many fad bands, 
and will outlast many more.

Plenty of people expressed a similar sentiment on Twitter – some, uh, a tad 
inelegantly:

Chet Faker is now backstage chatting to the press. He’s talking about how 
exhausted he is and how his music seems to resonate in “obscure countries”.

Guardian Australia feels like this is a good moment to get serious here, so we 
ask Mr Faker how he feels about Australia – politically, socially and musically 
– when reflecting back on it while touring overseas.

“Politically it’s not fun talking about it. Socially I think it’s amazing. 

“The current government here doesn’t represent the views of myself and a lot 
of people I would consider true Australians.

“I don’t think the government represents the wants of the people anymore.”

It’s teary-eye time as we pay tribute to the ABC show Countdown (which ran 
from 1974 until 1987) and its host Molly Meldrum, which is being admitted into 
the Arias hall of fame. Many of these kids will be too young to remember 
Countdown – confession, myself included. But I remember Molly fondly from his 
Hey, Hey, It’s Saturday days.
 Many of Australian television’s most memorable moments – including Iggy Pop 
spitting on a live television audience – happened on Countdown. 
Molly is, in fact, getting teary and delivers an incredibly gracious speech: 
“We had some outrageous times, some hairy times, a few disasters (that was me) 
and some of my greatest fumbles, mumbles and tumbles.”

“I’m just like everyone in this room, tonight with you here for the same 
reason. Because I love music. It’s my passion, it’s my life and I’ve been so 
blessed to share it with so many people.

“On behalf of the team of Countdown we owe it all to the people out there, who 
are the fans. Those who came back for more, you are the pride of Countdown and 
so many of us who remember it.”


He also acknowledges cricketer Phillip Hughes who is in a critical condition 
following a game injury.

Finally, Molly’s famous friends are paying tribute via video: AC/DC, Ben 
Elton, Olivia Newtown-John, Kylie Minogue and Rod Stewart, the latter who makes 
a reference to Molly’s accident three years ago where he fell off a ladder in 
his Melbourne backyard while putting up Christmas lights and ended up in 
hospital in a critical condition.

Molly’s looking a bit fragile on stage tonight, but he was all guns blazing on 
the red carpet earlier.
 It’s two thumbs up from Molly Meldrum. Photograph: AAP Image

Nope, she isn’t!

Sia has sent a video message, with a now signature stand-in wearing a Sia wig. 
Tonight, doing the duty was US comedian Carrot Top, aka Scott Thompson. It’s a 
very short message, thanking her fans and her team.

This was Sia’s fourth win for the night – two more than Chet Faker. And this 
caps off a big year for the Australian artist,whose sixth studio album reached 
No 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/jul/17/sia-1000-forms-of-fear-no-1-us-album>
 on both the Australian and US charts.

But let’s not forget our favourite Sia stand-in from tonight’s Aria awards

Best international artist goes to One Direction, who are followed by the final 
performance of the night:Neil Finn and Paul Kelly, first with Don’t Stand So 
Close to the Window. It’s a short but endearing version, before moving straight 
into Four Seasons in One Day (lighters out, everyone).
 
OK we are barreling towards the end of the night, so quick question, who do 
you think is going to take out the big award, album of the year? Leave a 
comment at the bottom of the page.

Here are the five nominees:

 * Chet Faker – Built On Glass

 * Dan Sultan – Blackbird

 * Jessica Mauboy – Beautiful

 * Sheppard – Bombs Away 

 * Sia – 1000 Forms of Fear

Meanwhile, Dan Sultan is giving a rousing performance of his very sexy, rock 
and rolling, whiskey-soaked track Under Your Skin.
 
Katy Perry presents for best female artist, first prefacing that she’s become 
a sort of “honorary Australian” over the last few weeks while she’s been 
touring the country:

“No longer will I use straws in my chocolate milk, I will use Tim Tams. No 
longer will I spread my bread with butter, I will use Vegemite. No longer will 
I eat just plain old chicken, I’ll eat kangaroo. Actually that is disgusting. 
Why do guys you eat the thing that’s actually on one of your flags? Very weird.”

Sia wins the award but the media-shy singer is in Los Angeles and Perry says 
as she is on her way there she can hand-deliver the pyramid.

Although, giant tassel aside, she still has a long way to go in the 
death-stare stakes before she rivals foreign minister Julie Bishop.
 
Best male artist has been given to Chet Faker, his second win of the night (he 
was up for nine awards altogether). Things we learned from his speech: he went 
to school with fellow nominees Vance Joy and his school counsellor said he 
shouldn’t pursue music as a career.

One Direction are on stage with Steal My Girl. 

I wonder if the Arias tried to get both boy bands on stage at the same time – 
a 1D meets 5SOS boy band orgy? You’d probably be at risk of triggering a mass 
wave of teen girl heart attacks. The kids are so damn cute. They ooze high 
school heartbreak.

Entertainment reporter Angela Bishop (daughter of House of Representatives 
speaker Bronwyn) asks them to name their favourite song of each other’s. Paul 
Kelly cites Crowded House’s Into Temptation, Fall at Your Feet and Distant Sun. 
Neil Finn waxes about How to Make Gravy – “It’s a song that’s deeply emotional” 
– and You Can Put Your Shoes Under My Bed.

Here’s the pair serenading the Sydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> Opera House in 2013. 
Something to watch if you’ve perchance got a spare couple of hours:

live album Goin’ Your Way, which features the musos celebrating each other’s 
songs.

We’re absolutely digging Paul Kelly’s purple suit.

Kind of amazing that we’re looking at a century worth of incredible 
songwriting talent; musical royalty that have outlasted so very many fad bands, 
and will outlast many more.

Plenty of people expressed a similar sentiment on Twitter – some, uh, a tad 
inelegantly:

seekers.

Chet Faker is now backstage chatting to the press. He’s talking about how 
exhausted he is and how his music seems to resonate in “obscure countries”.

Guardian Australia feels like this is a good moment to get serious here, so we 
ask Mr Faker how he feels about Australia – politically, socially and musically 
– when reflecting back on it while touring overseas.

“Politically it’s not fun talking about it. Socially I think it’s amazing. 

“The current government here doesn’t represent the views of myself and a lot 
of people I would consider true Australians.

“I don’t think the government represents the wants of the people anymore.” 
 
It’s teary-eye time as we pay tribute to the ABC show Countdown (which ran 
from 1974 until 1987) and its host Molly Meldrum, which is being admitted into 
the Arias hall of fame. Many of these kids will be too young to remember 
Countdown – confession, myself included. But I remember Molly fondly from his 
Hey, Hey, It’s Saturday days.
 Many of Australian television’s most memorable moments – including Iggy Pop 
spitting on a live television audience – happened on Countdown. 
Molly is, in fact, getting teary and delivers an incredibly gracious speech: 
“We had some outrageous times, some hairy times, a few disasters (that was me) 
and some of my greatest fumbles, mumbles and tumbles.”

“I’m just like everyone in this room, tonight with you here for the same 
reason. Because I love music. It’s my passion, it’s my life and I’ve been so 
blessed to share it with so many people.

“On behalf of the team of Countdown we owe it all to the people out there, who 
are the fans. Those who came back for more, you are the pride of Countdown and 
so many of us who remember it.”


He also acknowledges cricketer Phillip Hughes who is in a critical condition 
following a game injury.

Finally, Molly’s famous friends are paying tribute via video: AC/DC, Ben 
Elton, Olivia Newtown-John, Kylie Minogue and Rod Stewart, the latter who makes 
a reference to Molly’s accident three years ago where he fell off a ladder in 
his Melbourne backyard while putting up Christmas lights and ended up in 
hospital in a critical condition.

Molly’s looking a bit fragile on stage tonight, but he was all guns blazing on 
the red carpet earlier.
