Jazz had been evolving for almost a decade before it was recorded – and a 
white New Orleans band called the Original DixielandJazz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> Band beat all the superior Southland 
black bands to it. The ODJB were a raucous but lively five-piece influenced by 
the sound of Louis Armstrong mentor King Oliver's New Orleans groups. In 1917, 
following a successful New York run, the band cut tracks in the Victor studios 
that sold massively and launched a global jazz craze.
