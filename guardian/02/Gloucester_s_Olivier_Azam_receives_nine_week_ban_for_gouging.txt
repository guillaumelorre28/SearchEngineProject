Gloucester <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gloucesterrugby> hooker Olivier 
Azam has been banned for nine weeks after being found guilty of gouging. The 
incident, involving Cardiff Blues' centre Jamie Roberts, took place during the 
EDF Energy Cup final on 18 April, and means Azam will be unavailable for 
selection until mid-September.

A Rugby Football Union disciplinary panel decided that Azam had "made contact 
with the eyes or eye area" of Roberts, and suspended the Frenchman from 8 May 
until 17 September. The ban takes into account a close-season period for 
Guinness Premiership players previously agreed with Premier Rugby Ltd.

The citing had initially been dismissed on the grounds that it had been 
submitted too late by citing commissioner Mike Rafter. However, that decision 
was overturned last week by the RFU's chief disciplinary officer, Judge Jeff 
Blackett, who decided Azam had a case to answer.
