Today M, for milestones... which are important even on an Agile project.

Many people who read just a little about Agile development think there are no 
fixed commitments. It's true that there is constant reprioritisation of work, 
but that generally operates at the task level, and there is still a need to set 
goals and stick to them. After all, how else can you give the people who sign 
the cheques reassurance that you'll deliver what they want?

So when we planned R2 we also set milestones marking when we would make the 
major launches of each section. Each milestone was stated very simply at the 
high level: launch the homepage, launch the Environment section, etc. These 
were the targets we put before our senior stakeholders, and they were what we 
were accountable for.

At a lower level we planned for each launch to include specific features: the 
Culture launch would include a special component to list the critics; the 
Sports launch would include a component showing the latest betting odds from 
Blue Square; and so on. It was these lower level details which were always up 
for reprioritisation. As long as we could deliver sufficient features to allow 
the launch of each section we could fairly be said to be hitting that milestone 
and satisfying our senior stakeholders.
