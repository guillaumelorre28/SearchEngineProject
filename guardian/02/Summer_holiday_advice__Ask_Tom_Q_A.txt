Summer is already in full swing (in some places more than others), and it's 
not too late to get away. Whether you're considering a trip close to home or to 
somewhere with a near-guarantee of sunshine, we are here to help.

Tom Hall of Lonely Planet will be online at 1pm BST on Wednesday 18 June, 
replying to your questions on every style of travel, from activity holidays to 
flopping on beaches. If you've already booked, he can help you get the most out 
of the destination, via day trip ideas, accommodation tips and transport 
advice. Just post your comment below.

Tom will get to as many questions as he can in an hour, but due to the volume 
of questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
