Aim

"An act … brought forward to strengthen border controls 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/ukpga_20090011_en_1>, by bringing 
together customs and immigration powers, and to ensure that newcomers to the 
United Kingdom earn the right to stay."

Main provisions

• Allows immigration officers to perform revenue and customs functions that 
have up to now been exercised by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The 
UK Border Agency will focus on border-related customs matters, while HMRC will 
retain responsibility for revenue and customs functions inland.
• Creates new powers to allow customs officials and immigration officers to 
share information.
• Amends the rules on naturalisation. Those who are resident in the UK will 
need to have a certain residential status for eight years before being 
eligible, and those seeking to naturalise on the basis of marriage will take 
five years. These periods can be reduced to six years or three years 
respectively if the applicant meets the "activity condition" (see below). In 
order to qualify towards naturalisation, the period of time spent in the UK has 
to be while resident on a certain type of visa or entitlement, which will be 
determined by secondary legislation.
• Creates a new category of temporary leave to remain, entitled "probationary 
citizenship leave". This will form part of the new route to citizenship and 
will constitute an additional period for which migrants are denied access to 
services and welfare.
• Introduces the concept of voluntary community service for migrants, whereby 
undertaking an "activity condition" can reduce the length of the naturalisation 
process by up to two years. The type of activity that will count as an 
"activity condition" will be spelt out in secondary legislation.
• Imposes a duty on the secretary of state to safeguard and promote the 
welfare of children 
<http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/UKBA-keeps-children-from-harm> 
in the UK. The duty does not apply outside the UK.
• Allows fresh claim judicial review applications to be transferred from the 
High Court to the upper tribunal.
• Rectifies some irregularities 
<http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/connectasia/stories/200904/s2531938.htm> in 
the awarding of British citizenship and remedies a discriminatory practice that 
allowed citizenship to pass to children born abroad to British fathers before 
1961 but not to children born to British mothers.
• Grants automatic British nationality to a child born in the UK where at 
least one parent is a foreign or commonwealth member of the British armed 
forces.
• Allows conditions restricting studies to be imposed on those given limited 
leave to enter or remain in the UK.
• Allows for fingerprints to be taken from foreign criminals liable to 
automatic deportation under the scheme created in theUK Borders Act 2007

Background
 Factbox Photograph: Factbox 
The act emanates from a wider Home Office project aiming to radically simplify 
immigration law <http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/simplifying>
. The government has acknowledged that thelegal framework 
<http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/managingourborders/makingchangestick.pdf>
[pdf] governing immigration law has become overly complex.

It was initially expected that the act would consolidate existing immigration 
legislation, however the Home Office delayed introducing the draft 
simplification bill – it was eventually announced inNovember 2009 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/nov/18/queens-speech-draft-immigration-bill>
 – and in the interim identified key measures to be quickly pushed forward.

These included the recommendation made in a 2008 Home Office green paper The 
Path to Citizenship 
<http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/consultations/closedconsultations/pathtocitizenship/pathtocitizenship%3Fview%3DBinary&ei=4pSSSdb5IeCGjAeBgoWpCg&sig2=o0h1TYEGO2Mg-ttZEBkqqQ&usg=AFQjCNG0QIkksc62egho1Y1EX_taEMx6ZA>
, which took as its starting point the premise that migrants "earn" their 
citizenship and that only those who demonstrated their commitment to the UK 
"should be allowed to complete their journey to citizenship". Other clauses 
come from a partial (draft) immigration and citizenship bill also published in 
the summer of 2008.

The legislative changes in the act are intended to complement the 
Australian-stylepoints-based system 
<http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/employers/points/whatisthepointsbasedsystem> 
for immigration that was introduced in stages during 2008.

Announcing the act 
<http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsarticles/new-bill-route-to-citizenship>
, the border and immigration minister, Phil Woolas, said: "Migration only works 
if it brings benefits and these measures will ensure that only those migrants 
that make a positive impact on their local community will be able to stay in 
the UK."

But the government's scheme was dealt a blow 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/mar/26/yesterday-parliament> when the 
House of Lords voted 171 to 110 during the report stage for an amendment moved 
by the Conservative Lady Hanham, which required that anyone who applied for 
limited leave to remain in Britain, for indefinite leave to remain or for 
British citizenship before the bill became law should be dealt with using 
current immigration arrangements.

The government also bowed <> to the Lords on a key clause 
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/03/ukba_overseas_fingerprint_exchange> 
that would havereintroduced border checks 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7977911.stm> for those travelling 
in the common travel area (CTA) between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

Criticism

Expressing his disappointment when the bill was first published, the Liberal 
Democrat shadow home secretary, Chris Huhne, said: "This is the eighth 
immigration bill since 1997, but the government is no nearer to solving the key 
problems. Instead of making legal migrants jump through hoops for citizenship, 
the priority should be the immediate reintroduction of exit checks and proper 
border controls". Huhne later suggested that barring people from citizenship 
for engaging in "unpatriotic behaviour" made it look as though the government 
wanted to play the"Thought Police" 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/aug/04/british-citizenship-freedom-expression>
.

Some parliamentarians suggested this was a freedom of speech issue, arguing 
that it was possible that these provisions couldtarget those protesting 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/aug/03/citizenship> against the 
wars in Afghanistan or Iraq.

The Children's Society 
<http://www.cypnow.co.uk/news/ByDiscipline/Social-Care/874001/New-immigration-bill-missed-opportunity>
 described the act as a "missed opportunity" because the government refused to 
alter its policy on the detention of child asylum seekers. Although the charity 
welcomed the clause placing a duty on the UK Border Agency and private 
contractors to promote the welfare of children – in line with section 11 of the
Children's Act 2004 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/13/children-act>
 – it joined other organisations in arguing that the clause was incompatible 
with the government's insistence ondetaining children 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/henryporter/2009/nov/05/children-asylum-home-office>
 seeking asylum. A spokesperson for the charityLisa Mandy 
<http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/whats_happening/media_office/latest_news/18853_news.html>
 argued, "This new legislation needs to trigger a fundamental change in the way 
the UK Border Agency treats the children in its care ... Forcing children into 
detention or destitution is simply incompatible with the UKBA's new duty to 
have regard to their welfare and safety."

Liberty was particularly concerned 
<http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/pdfs/policy-09/liberty-s-second-reading-briefing-on-the-borders-citizenship-immigration-bil.pdf>
[pdf] with the roll out of invasive customs powers to untrained and 
unaccountable immigration officials contained in Part 1 of the act, and reform 
of the naturalisation process for migrants contained in Part 2. Liberty also 
attacked the Home Office's failure to set out which types of limited leave to 
remain would count towards the qualifying period, arguing that these details 
were too important to be left to secondary legislation. It noted: "[T]his 
government has displayed a penchant for secondary legislation. Indeed it has 
become a common theme that the secretary of state, by regulation, may amend or 
create a whole host of rules that have dramatic – often adverse – impacts on 
the rights of large numbers of people."

Liberty and the Immigration Lawyers Practitioners Association also queried the 
decision to allow the Home Office to lead a consultation on whether judicial 
reviews of immigration and nationality decisions should be transferred to the 
upper tribunal. They pointed out that the Home Office was a frequent party to 
litigation in areas relating to immigration, asylum and human rights law. The
IPLA 
<http://www.ilpa.org.uk/briefings/09.01.20%20ILPA%20Initial%20Briefing%20Borders%20Immigration%20Citizenship%20Bill.doc>
 argued that it "seems questionable that the Home Office has been allowed to 
lead a contentious initiative to reform the process of judicial reviews to 
which they are subject".
