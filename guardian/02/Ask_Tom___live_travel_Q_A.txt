Whether you need help planning a weekend break or a long-haul adventure, Tom 
will be online at 1pm (BST) on Wednesday, replying to your questions on any 
travel queries you have. If you have a dilemma or would just like some 
inspiration or general advice, please post a comment below.

Tom will get to as many as he can in an hour, but due to the volume of 
questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
