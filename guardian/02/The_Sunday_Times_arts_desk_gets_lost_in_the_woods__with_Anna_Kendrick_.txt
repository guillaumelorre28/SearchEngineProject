It’s one of the most irritating bits of non-thinking in arts life. Here’s the 
Sunday Times Review with the front and two more pages devoted to Anna Kendrick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/anna-kendrick> – “Up Where She Belongs”, a 
fast-rising star on her way to the A-list.

Why interview her now though? Because she’s Cinderella in the film version of 
Sondheim’sInto the Woods, out now. So what does Camilla Long, reviewing for the 
Review, have to say a few pages on? Kendrick is “screechy and hamsterish” as 
Cinders. In short, a puff of publicity goes poof somewhere between the 
commissioning desk and the critics’ desk. It happens time and again all over, 
and not just in theST. Nil liaison just builds them up to let you down.
