The Warner Bros project is said to be "darker" than its rival, which is set up 
at Disney, and which would appear to be ahead in the race to reach cinemas.

.

As a first timer, Serkis may be a risky choice for a big budget family movie, 
but the actor and CG motion capture specialist won plaudits for his second unit
