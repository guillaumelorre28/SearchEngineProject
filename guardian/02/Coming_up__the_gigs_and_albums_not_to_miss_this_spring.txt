trouble. Debut album,The Whole Family Is Worried, is chock-full of sulky 
goodness.

Katy B

You weren’t likely to get Major Lazer on an album with Floating Points and 
up’n’coming UK MC Novelistany time soon – not untilKaty B 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/katy-b>, inset, went and made Honey, one of 
the busiest albums of 2016. The list of collaborators on the south London 
singer’s latest offering is as deep as it is long, taking a step back from pop 
into clubland.

PJ Harvey

PJ Harvey’s ninth studio album has had an unusually public gestation – its 
recording formed the basis of an art installation – and is the fruit of her 
travels (with videographer Seamus Murphy) around conflict zones and Washington 
DC. Let the world shake.

The Last Shadow Puppets

Last heard circa 2008, Alex Turner and Miles Kane’s side project is back with 
a swagger, in the form of Bad Habits, the raucous first single from new album
Everything You’ve Come To Expect. Producer James Ford and string arranger Owen 
Pallett are also back on board; Isaac Hayes was on the stereo, according to 
Turner.

Nao

In a field teeming with cutting-edge digital R&B sirens, Londoner Nao manages 
to bring a distinct space-age soul to on-point sounds, like FKA Twigs run 
through an Erykah Badu filter. Squired previously by Disclosure – she was on 
theirCaracal album – and now building up nicely to her debut album, scheduled 
for this summer, it’s worth catching her in small venues now.

 Orchestral popper Meilyr Jones. 
Meilyr Jones

Indie <https://www.theguardian.com/music/indie> bards are ten-a-penny, but 
Meilyr Jones (formerly of Race Horses, contributor to Neon Neon) has more flair 
than most. His debut solo album – part confessional, part inspired by art 
history on a trip to Rome – is an ambitious orchestral pop outing. He hits the 
road this month.

Jones plays Rough Trade East, London on 22 March, then tours the UK

They have since added a second, and are putting out their first new music in 20

J Dilla

Detroit producer and rapper J Dilla, inset, died of a rare blood disease in 
2006. Lionised by the likes of Questlove and Flying Lotus, the Slum Village and 
Soulquarians member is frequently cited as an influence both within and outside 
his genre.The Diary is Dilla’s lost 2002 vocal album, on which he raps, 
producing himself and others (Snoop Dogg, Bilal); these are proper tracks, not 
just half-baked ideas.

The Diary is out 15 April

US breakout R&B star Tinashe’s eagerly awaited second album, Joyride – the 
followup to 2014’s laudedAquarius – keeps sliding back in the schedules as she 
juggles increased production and songwriting duties. But she has four UK dates 
firmly inked in; a second London show was added due to demand.
