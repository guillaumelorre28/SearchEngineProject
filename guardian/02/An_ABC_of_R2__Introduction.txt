In September 2008 theguardian.com officially finished the rebuilding of our 
website, which had started (depending how you count it) in October 2005. The 
project wasknown internally as R2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/sep/09/whatsthatcomingoverthehil>
. Over each of the next 26 working days I'll be looking at one aspect of the 
project -- one for each letter of the alphabet, for want of a better structure. 
Here's what's coming up:



 * A is for article editor; 

 * B is for business analysis; 

 * C is for changing requirements; 

 * D is for domain driven design; 

 * E is for education tables; 

 * F is for flexible advertising; 

 * G is for Guardian America; 

 * H is for home page; 

 * I is for iterations; 

 * J is for JFDI; 

 * K is for keyword component; 

 * L is for legacy systems; 

 * M is for milestones; 

 * N is for news section; 

 * O is for opportunity; 

 * P is for pair programming; 

 * Q is for quality assurance; 

 * R is for R2; 

 * S is for sitebuilding; 

 * T is for timeline; 

 * U is for URLs; 

 * V is for video content; 

 * W is for Wiimbledon; 

 * X is for XL;

Tomorrow I'll start with A.
