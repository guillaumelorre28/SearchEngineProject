Whether or not the cornetist Buddy Bolden invented jazz (Jelly Roll Morton is 
one of the best known other claimants to the title), he certainly created the 
enduring archetype of the jazz musician as doomed romantic hero when he 
suffered a mental breakdown in 1907, at the age of 30, and spent his remaining 
years in a Louisiana asylum. The tantalisingly poignant twist to the tale of 
the idiom's first celebrated individual musician is that no one knows what he 
sounded like, since he ceased musical activity 10 years before the first jazz 
recording was made – although some contemporaries alleged that his playing was 
in fact captured on a wax cylinder but never unearthed. Born in New Orleans in 
1877, Bolden is said to have worked as a barber but was leading his own band at 
dances and parties in the city by the age of 18. Photographs show that by 1905 
the lineup of his ensemble – cornet, trombone, two clarinets, guitar and double 
bass – approximated the classic instrumentation of later traditional 
jazz bands. Louis Armstrong, who heard him at first hand, remarked many years 
later that Miles Davis's plaintive tone reminded him of Bolden, which calls 
into question the famous claim that his playing was powerful enough to be heard 
across "14 miles on a clear night". But once committed to the state mental 
institution, he never re-emerged. He died in 1931 and was buried in a pauper's 
grave.
