Monster mash-up

This modern monster collages a blown-up photo of the 1960s Labour party leader 
Hugh Gaitskell with a painted hybrid of monster magazine bogeymen: a Phantom Of 
The Opera mask and an eye from a Jack The Ripper flick. The comically prim 
mouth and buckled chin are very much the politician’s own.

Gone nuclear

Its creator Richard Hamilton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/richard-hamilton> brought politics to 
pop art, beginning with this savaging of Gaitskell. A divisive figure, 
Gaitskell stirred the artist’s anger when he abandoned Labour’s anti-nukes 
stance and sided with the Tory government on nuclear deterrence.

This note’s for you

Hamilton began thinking about a work skewering Gaitskell with his wife Terry 
O’Reilly, a committed CND campaigner. They collected the source material 
together, including newspaper caricatures. When she died in a car crash in 1962 
it took Hamilton a year to return to the project, which he made as a tribute.

Anger management

The work was also a reaction to what Hamilton saw as political apathy among 
his artist peers. It paved the way for searing works including his depiction of 
the dirty protests and hunger strikes of imprisoned IRA members.
