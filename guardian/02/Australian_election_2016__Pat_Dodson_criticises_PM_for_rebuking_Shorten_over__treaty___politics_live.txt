That will do us for this evening

As delightful as today is and you all are, I reckon that will do us for this 
evening. Let’s wrap with our usual summary.

 * Today, the leaders hit the west for a day of campaigning as pre-poll voting 
got underway round the country. Labor’s policy announcement was about 
apprenticeships, the Coalition’s was a baseball field in Gosnells.Bill Shorten 
is pushing through as we fold the Politics Live tent for the evening. He’s 
talking to listeners on JJJ. He’s just been asked to listMalcolm Turnbull’s 
three stirling qualities: they were, for the record, articulate, republican, 
supporter of marriage equality.

 * Apart from the set pieces, Malcolm Turnbull was unhappy with Bill Shorten 
for raising the spectre of a treaty with Indigenous Australians instead of 
focussing on constitutional recognition.Bill Shorten said he was happy to lock 
down recognition as soon as possible but he also thought it was possible to 
talk about more than one thing at the same time. So didPat Dodson and Warren 
Mundine. The prime minister himself forgot to focus exclusively on Indigenous 
recognition and thought, since someone was kind enough to ask, that it was fair 
to describe the colonisation of Australia as an invasion. The sound of various 
people choking on their paninis was muffled by the relentless advance of the 
campaign caravan (as opposed to thecaravan of chaos that Scott Morrison is 
deeply fond of tellingRay Hadley or Ray Hadley’s stand in about – the one Rob 
Oakeshott is somehow implicated in. Best you don’t ask because it really could 
not be less important.)

 * Former Liberal MP Dennis Jensen is continuing to prosecute the relationship 
between Parakeelia and the Liberal party with all the relentlessness of an MP 
scorned. Today he thought there might be double dipping going on: donations and 
tax breaks. No, the Liberal party said, because the payments are not donations, 
they are other receipts. A question from me asking the Liberal party to specify 
the nature of the payments categorised as other receipts went unanswered. 
Turned out the Labor party also had one very modest example of an other receipt 
from its preferred software provider, which sponsored a data conference in 
2014-15.

There was more, but that’s the guts of things. I’m heading to Sydney tomorrow 
for the first of our election live events so you will be in the elegant hands of
Calla Wahlquistand Gabrielle Chan for the next 48 hours while I transact all 
that business. Until we meet again, be well.

While I was face first in Parakeelia and Magenta Linas, Warren Mundine, who is 
the chair of the prime minister’s Indigenous advisory taskforce, has told Sky 
News Australia could manage both recognition and a treaty conversation at the 
same time – although he’s stressed the treaty discussion is at a very 
preliminary stage. This was after the prime minister rebukedBill Shorten 
earlier today for flagging the conversation about a treaty.

Window smashed in Cathy McGowan's Wodonga office

Let’s look elsewhere for a bit. Things are getting a bit hairy in Indi by the 
sounds of thisreport 
<http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/3967070/cathys-campaign-office-windows-smashed/?cs=53>
 from the Border Mail.

Cathy McGowan campaigners will explore new security measures, after their 
Wodonga headquarters was targeted twice in six days. A window in the front door 
of the Beechworth Road building was found smashed on Monday morning, less than 
a week after a glass panel beside it was also shattered. Police say two paving 
blocks from the front garden at property were used to cause the damage. A rock 
was also found inside following the incident, whichThe Border Mail understands 
occurred sometime between Friday afternoon and Monday morning. Wodonga police 
were investigating the determine whether the damage caused on both occasions 
were linked.

Various people are asking me online about other receipts as opposed to 
donations. This is thedefinition the AEC has on its website 
<http://periodicdisclosures.aec.gov.au/Glossary.aspx>.

Other receipts:

 * This term refers to those amounts received by a party or associated entity 
which do not meet the legislative definition of ‘gift’ (commonly referred to as 
donation). Examples of amounts which fall into the category of ‘other receipts’ 
are interest on investments, dividends on shares, market rate rent received on 
properties owned. All other receipts disclosed in the return must show the 
gross amount.

One "other receipt" from Magenta Linas

Back to Labor again and Magenta Linas.

There is one “other receipt” in Labor’s records as well from the party’s data 
mining supplier. Not a donation, a cost recovery exercise.

In 2014/15 the company sponsored a Labor data conference at a cost of $1,018. 
The sponsorship covered the cost of holding the event.

So there are overlaps and differences here. Parakeelia is owned by the Liberal 
party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> and funds are 
being transferred between the entities.

Magenta Linas is privately owned. The transaction with Labor I’ve outlined 
above it the only one I’m aware of. If there are others that people know about, 
get in touch.

Here is a list of Magenta Linas clients <http://www.ml.net.au/clients#list>, 
in the event you are interested. Labor and the unions are a prominent client, 
but there are also governments and corporates.Here’s the company information 
<http://www.aubiz.net/company/magenta-linas-software-pty-ltd-080038482/>.

The Liberal party has come back to me now on the suggestion that Dennis Jensen 
raised on Sky this afternoon that there might be double dipping associated with 
the data mining operation: theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> could be getting a 
donation from Parakeelia and then claiming a tax deduction.

This is the response from a spokesman for the Liberal party. No donations, 
therefore no double dipping.

Payments from Parakeelia Pty Ltd to the Liberal Party were not donations.

It wrong to claim or report that they are.

Mr Jensen’s claims are false.

(I mentioned a couple of posts ago if you look at how the Parakeelia payments 
are characterised in the disclosure logs on the AEC, they are actually 
classified as “other receipts” not donations.)

7.00am BST 07:00  <> 

Speaking of Labor CHQ, I mentioned before I would chase down Bill Shorten’s 
comment during his media conference this morning that the Labor party’s data 
mining operation is a matter of record. I’ve asked a Labor campaign spokesman 
to point me to the record the Labor leader was referring to.

They’ve come back with two sources from Fairfax Media articles. One quote from 
a Herald article, from June 9.

Labor, which runs similar software known as ‘‘Campaign Central’’, licences its 
programs from Magenta Linas and pays the company to use the software under 
licence. The company does not appear to have donated money to Labor.

Another from an Age article dated June 10.

Labor pays a third party for its software, Magenta Linas, which has not 
donated money to the party. SA lower house MPs paid $60,000 to that company in 
2012-13. Labor has confirmed it runs its software at a net cost to the party.

I think two newspaper references is a distance short of a record myself, but 
these references do give readers some information on the Labor data mining 
operation which is called Campaign Central, and it provided by Magenta Linas.

Readers are asking me online what data political parties collect. Basically 
they collect information on contacts with constituents. It helps with targeting 
and micro-targeting if you keep extensive records about what people are 
concerned about. If you know what people are worried about, it helps you 
communicate successfully with them.

There has been loads written about this in the US, but hardly anything in 
Australia, largely because the Australian political scene was perceived to be 
well behind the models and methodologies deployed routinely by political 
parties in the US. Data mining is much more important in America because of the 
importance of the ground game: getting out the vote is half the battle. Less 
critical here because of compulsory voting, but still very important to 
political communication.

On walking and chewing gum at the same time

Labor HQ has released a statement from Pat Dodson criticising the prime 
minister for smacking downBill Shorten on the treaty.

Dodson says Australia can manage both debates: constitutional recognition and 
a debate about treaties.

the Long Walk to the MCG as part of the 2016 election campaign in Melbourne on 
28 May. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP 
Pat Dodson:

Mr Turnbull should lead on these matters, not follow. Bipartisanship is 
critical to going forward on the pathway to reconciliation. These issues aren’t 
mutually exclusive. We need to talk about both. The constitutional change to 
recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is the immediate 
priority and we await the outcomes from the Referendum Council’s Constitutional 
Conventions. But what flows from further parliamentary consideration has to be 
made meaningful in the eyes of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
people. A conversation about these matters is well overdue and essential for 
the good of the nation. Both can be done.

other receipt. I’ll bring you the response from CHQ if one is forthcoming.

I was interested to see the Labor leader Bill Shorten say this morning that 
the Labor party’s data mining practices were a matter of record. I’ve put in a 
question to Labor HQ about which record the Labor leader was referring to. If I 
get an answer to that, I’ll share that too.

Here’s one common element: political parties don’t really like talking about 
their data mining operations. It gives voters an insight into the sausage 
making process that professional politics would regard as unhelpful.

Is there a double dip: Parakeelia

Former Liberal Dennis Jensen, running in this campaign as an independent, is 
on the warpath about Parakeelia, the data mining operation that also makes 
donations to the Liberal party. Jensen is on Sky News now, still on the 
warpath. He’s lost all his data to the Liberal party now he’s out of the flock. 
Today, Jensen wants to know whether the Liberal party is also claiming a tax 
deduction for the donation from Parakeelia,double dipping in essence. The 
double dip comes from taxpayer funds (through allowances) going to the data 
mining company, which then makes a donation to theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party>, then a tax break is 
claimed.

Sky host Peter Van Onselen says why now. You benefitted from this system, why 
are you speaking out now?

Jensen says he only recently discovered the fact of the donations from 
Parakeelia to the Liberal party. He also says his ire was raised when the 
Liberal party “unilaterally pulled my access to Feedback” (which is the 
relevant program which stores the data on constituents) even though it had been 
funded by him through allowances until later in the year.

Let's take stock

Today really has a bit of everything, so I’m glad we are all together. You 
wouldn’t be dead for quids really. Let’s work out where we are in the grand 
scheme of things.
 The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the deputy leader, Julie Bishop, at 
a press conference in the federal seat of Cowan in Perth on Tuesday morning. 
Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian 
 * The first thing to observe is we are now running at conventional campaign 
pace. Blame the opening of pre-polling. I said this last night during the Q&A 
live call, it’s now a sprint to the finish, nostrils flaring, ears pinned back.

 * Today is short, sharp, hand-to-hand combat. Malcolm Turnbull has accused 
Bill Shorten of risking constitutional recognition with his ill-disciplined 
musings on a treaty last night on Q&A.Bill Shorten has responded by saying 
bring me the proposition for the referendum and let’s close the deal next year.
Malcolm Turnbull also allowed a hustings digression of his own on Indigenous 
affairs, thinking it was fair to characterise colonisation as an invasion. I 
suspect that won’t go down exceptionally well in conservative quarters of the 
party.

 * The prime minister has been talking jobs with young folks in Perth in one 
of his roving “yeah baby” sessions which, thus far in the campaign, have 
centred on T-shirt-clad startup gurus, not apprentices in high viz. [Old 
economy, pagingMalcolm Turnbull, report to a campaign event, stat.] The optics 
weren’t terrible by any stretch, but it was all pretty forced.Bill Shorten, 
also in the wild west, has unveiled a policy on apprenticeships and retraining, 
and was peppered with questions about the untidy sections of his Q&A 
performance last night.

 * The Coalition is also reviewing the visa of a controversial cleric in the 
wake of the massacre in Orlando. The prime minister also warned about the 
potential for attacks by lone wolves – self-motivated, self-styled people not 
necessarily taking direct orders from groups like Islamic state.

Ah, look, Peter Dutton is back

I will take stock very shortly because we need it but first, the immigration 
ministerPeter Dutton is speaking to reporters in Queensland. We haven’t seen 
much of the immigration minister since he kicked a hornet’s nest with his 
declaration in about week three that refugees were coming to Australia to both 
steal our jobs and recline on our welfare. It’s been strictlyRay Hadley and 
need to know for PDudds in the national campaign since that edifying outburst.

But today Dutton smells a rat with Bill Shorten talking transparency in 
detention centres. This is all a slippery slope to letting the people smugglers 
control Australia’s immigration program, Dutton thinks. It’s a tough sell to 
tell journalists that allowing them to scrutinise detention centres is the road 
to chaos, butPeter Dutton is a tough seller from way back.

Eventually the question rolls round to the controversial cleric. Dutton says 
the department is reviewing the case and the government has no tolerance for 
hate preaching.

As delightful as today is and you all are, I reckon that will do us for this 
evening. Let’s wrap with our usual summary.

 * Today, the leaders hit the west for a day of campaigning as pre-poll voting 
got underway round the country. Labor’s policy announcement was about 
apprenticeships, the Coalition’s was a baseball field in Gosnells.Bill Shorten 
is pushing through as we fold the Politics Live tent for the evening. He’s 
talking to listeners on JJJ. He’s just been asked to listMalcolm Turnbull’s 
three stirling qualities: they were, for the record, articulate, republican, 
supporter of marriage equality.

 * Apart from the set pieces, Malcolm Turnbull was unhappy with Bill Shorten 
for raising the spectre of a treaty with Indigenous Australians instead of 
focussing on constitutional recognition.Bill Shorten said he was happy to lock 
down recognition as soon as possible but he also thought it was possible to 
talk about more than one thing at the same time. So didPat Dodson and Warren 
Mundine. The prime minister himself forgot to focus exclusively on Indigenous 
recognition and thought, since someone was kind enough to ask, that it was fair 
to describe the colonisation of Australia as an invasion. The sound of various 
people choking on their paninis was muffled by the relentless advance of the 
campaign caravan (as opposed to thecaravan of chaos that Scott Morrison is 
deeply fond of tellingRay Hadley or Ray Hadley’s stand in about – the one Rob 
Oakeshott is somehow implicated in. Best you don’t ask because it really could 
not be less important.)

 * Former Liberal MP Dennis Jensen is continuing to prosecute the relationship 
between Parakeelia and the Liberal party with all the relentlessness of an MP 
scorned. Today he thought there might be double dipping going on: donations and 
tax breaks. No, the Liberal party said, because the payments are not donations, 
they are other receipts. A question from me asking the Liberal party to specify 
the nature of the payments categorised as other receipts went unanswered. 
Turned out the Labor party also had one very modest example of an other receipt 
from its preferred software provider, which sponsored a data conference in 
2014-15.

There was more, but that’s the guts of things. I’m heading to Sydney tomorrow 
for the first of our election live events so you will be in the elegant hands of
Calla Wahlquistand Gabrielle Chan for the next 48 hours while I transact all 
that business. Until we meet again, be well.

The campaigns are rolling on in Perth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/perth-news>. Malcolm Turnbull has 
promised $6m for a baseball park extension in Gosnells.Bill Shorten has sailed 
forth with events this afternoon, he’s just spoken again to reporters briefly, 
but didn’t take questions.
 
While I was face first in Parakeelia and Magenta Linas, Warren Mundine, who is 
the chair of the prime minister’s Indigenous advisory taskforce, has told Sky 
News Australia could manage both recognition and a treaty conversation at the 
same time – although he’s stressed the treaty discussion is at a very 
preliminary stage. This was after the prime minister rebukedBill Shorten 
earlier today for flagging the conversation about a treaty.
 
Let’s look elsewhere for a bit. Things are getting a bit hairy in Indi by the 
sounds of thisreport 
<http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/3967070/cathys-campaign-office-windows-smashed/?cs=53>
 from the Border Mail.

Cathy McGowan campaigners will explore new security measures, after their 
Wodonga headquarters was targeted twice in six days. A window in the front door 
of the Beechworth Road building was found smashed on Monday morning, less than 
a week after a glass panel beside it was also shattered. Police say two paving 
blocks from the front garden at property were used to cause the damage. A rock 
was also found inside following the incident, whichThe Border Mail understands 
occurred sometime between Friday afternoon and Monday morning. Wodonga police 
were investigating the determine whether the damage caused on both occasions 
were linked.
 
I’ve sent a further query to Liberal CHQ to see if I can ascertain what 
category the payments from Parakeelia Pty Ltd to theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> fell into, now that 
I’ve shared the definition of “other receipts.” If I get a response I’ll share 
it.
 
Various people are asking me online about other receipts as opposed to 
donations. This is thedefinition the AEC has on its website 
<http://periodicdisclosures.aec.gov.au/Glossary.aspx>.

Other receipts:

 * This term refers to those amounts received by a party or associated entity 
which do not meet the legislative definition of ‘gift’ (commonly referred to as 
donation). Examples of amounts which fall into the category of ‘other receipts’ 
are interest on investments, dividends on shares, market rate rent received on 
properties owned. All other receipts disclosed in the return must show the 
gross amount.
 
Back to Labor again and Magenta Linas.

There is one “other receipt” in Labor’s records as well from the party’s data 
mining supplier. Not a donation, a cost recovery exercise.

In 2014/15 the company sponsored a Labor data conference at a cost of $1,018. 
The sponsorship covered the cost of holding the event.

So there are overlaps and differences here. Parakeelia is owned by the Liberal 
party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> and funds are 
being transferred between the entities.

Magenta Linas is privately owned. The transaction with Labor I’ve outlined 
above it the only one I’m aware of. If there are others that people know about, 
get in touch.

Here is a list of Magenta Linas clients <http://www.ml.net.au/clients#list>, 
in the event you are interested. Labor and the unions are a prominent client, 
but there are also governments and corporates.Here’s the company information 
<http://www.aubiz.net/company/magenta-linas-software-pty-ltd-080038482/>. 
 
The Liberal party has come back to me now on the suggestion that Dennis Jensen 
raised on Sky this afternoon that there might be double dipping associated with 
the data mining operation: theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> could be getting a 
donation from Parakeelia and then claiming a tax deduction.

This is the response from a spokesman for the Liberal party. No donations, 
therefore no double dipping.

Payments from Parakeelia Pty Ltd to the Liberal Party were not donations.

It wrong to claim or report that they are.

Mr Jensen’s claims are false.

(I mentioned a couple of posts ago if you look at how the Parakeelia payments 
are characterised in the disclosure logs on the AEC, they are actually 
classified as “other receipts” not donations.)
 
Speaking of Labor CHQ, I mentioned before I would chase down Bill Shorten’s 
comment during his media conference this morning that the Labor party’s data 
mining operation is a matter of record. I’ve asked a Labor campaign spokesman 
to point me to the record the Labor leader was referring to.

They’ve come back with two sources from Fairfax Media articles. One quote from 
a Herald article, from June 9.

Labor, which runs similar software known as ‘‘Campaign Central’’, licences its 
programs from Magenta Linas and pays the company to use the software under 
licence. The company does not appear to have donated money to Labor.

Another from an Age article dated June 10.

Labor pays a third party for its software, Magenta Linas, which has not 
donated money to the party. SA lower house MPs paid $60,000 to that company in 
2012-13. Labor has confirmed it runs its software at a net cost to the party.

I think two newspaper references is a distance short of a record myself, but 
these references do give readers some information on the Labor data mining 
operation which is called Campaign Central, and it provided by Magenta Linas.

Readers are asking me online what data political parties collect. Basically 
they collect information on contacts with constituents. It helps with targeting 
and micro-targeting if you keep extensive records about what people are 
concerned about. If you know what people are worried about, it helps you 
communicate successfully with them.

There has been loads written about this in the US, but hardly anything in 
Australia, largely because the Australian political scene was perceived to be 
well behind the models and methodologies deployed routinely by political 
parties in the US. Data mining is much more important in America because of the 
importance of the ground game: getting out the vote is half the battle. Less 
critical here because of compulsory voting, but still very important to 
political communication.
 
Labor HQ has released a statement from Pat Dodson criticising the prime 
minister for smacking downBill Shorten on the treaty.

Dodson says Australia can manage both debates: constitutional recognition and 
a debate about treaties.

28 May. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP 
Pat Dodson:

Mr Turnbull should lead on these matters, not follow. Bipartisanship is 
critical to going forward on the pathway to reconciliation. These issues aren’t 
mutually exclusive. We need to talk about both. The constitutional change to 
recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is the immediate 
priority and we await the outcomes from the Referendum Council’s Constitutional 
Conventions. But what flows from further parliamentary consideration has to be 
made meaningful in the eyes of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
people. A conversation about these matters is well overdue and essential for 
the good of the nation. Both can be done.
 
In the event you want to have a look at the disclosures on Parakeelia on the 
AEC website you can find themcollated here 
<http://periodicdisclosures.aec.gov.au/AssociatedEntity.aspx?SubmissionId=56&ClientId=1109>
. The payments to the Liberal party are recorded not as donations but as other 
receipts, so if we are adhering to the definitions the electoral commission 
uses these payments aren’t donations, strictly speaking. They are classified as 
other receipt. I’ll bring you the response from CHQ if one is forthcoming.

I was interested to see the Labor leader Bill Shorten say this morning that 
the Labor party’s data mining practices were a matter of record. I’ve put in a 
question to Labor HQ about which record the Labor leader was referring to. If I 
get an answer to that, I’ll share that too.

Here’s one common element: political parties don’t really like talking about 
their data mining operations. It gives voters an insight into the sausage 
making process that professional politics would regard as unhelpful.
 
I have approached the CHQ of the Liberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> to see if they are 
commenting on the Jensen intervention.
 
Former Liberal Dennis Jensen, running in this campaign as an independent, is 
on the warpath about Parakeelia, the data mining operation that also makes 
donations to the Liberal party. Jensen is on Sky News now, still on the 
warpath. He’s lost all his data to the Liberal party now he’s out of the flock. 
Today, Jensen wants to know whether the Liberal party is also claiming a tax 
deduction for the donation from Parakeelia,double dipping in essence. The 
double dip comes from taxpayer funds (through allowances) going to the data 
mining company, which then makes a donation to theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party>, then a tax break is 
claimed.

Sky host Peter Van Onselen says why now. You benefitted from this system, why 
are you speaking out now?

Jensen says he only recently discovered the fact of the donations from 
Parakeelia to the Liberal party. He also says his ire was raised when the 
Liberal party “unilaterally pulled my access to Feedback” (which is the 
relevant program which stores the data on constituents) even though it had been 
funded by him through allowances until later in the year.
 
Today really has a bit of everything, so I’m glad we are all together. You 
wouldn’t be dead for quids really. Let’s work out where we are in the grand 
scheme of things.

 * The first thing to observe is we are now running at conventional campaign 
pace. Blame the opening of pre-polling. I said this last night during the Q&A 
live call, it’s now a sprint to the finish, nostrils flaring, ears pinned back.

 * Today is short, sharp, hand-to-hand combat. Malcolm Turnbull has accused 
Bill Shorten of risking constitutional recognition with his ill-disciplined 
musings on a treaty last night on Q&A.Bill Shorten has responded by saying 
bring me the proposition for the referendum and let’s close the deal next year.
Malcolm Turnbull also allowed a hustings digression of his own on Indigenous 
affairs, thinking it was fair to characterise colonisation as an invasion. I 
suspect that won’t go down exceptionally well in conservative quarters of the 
party.

 * The prime minister has been talking jobs with young folks in Perth in one 
of his roving “yeah baby” sessions which, thus far in the campaign, have 
centred on T-shirt-clad startup gurus, not apprentices in high viz. [Old 
economy, pagingMalcolm Turnbull, report to a campaign event, stat.] The optics 
weren’t terrible by any stretch, but it was all pretty forced.Bill Shorten, 
also in the wild west, has unveiled a policy on apprenticeships and retraining, 
and was peppered with questions about the untidy sections of his Q&A 
performance last night.

 * The Coalition is also reviewing the visa of a controversial cleric in the 
wake of the massacre in Orlando. The prime minister also warned about the 
potential for attacks by lone wolves – self-motivated, self-styled people not 
necessarily taking direct orders from groups like Islamic state.

I will take stock very shortly because we need it but first, the immigration 
ministerPeter Dutton is speaking to reporters in Queensland. We haven’t seen 
much of the immigration minister since he kicked a hornet’s nest with his 
declaration in about week three that refugees were coming to Australia to both 
steal our jobs and recline on our welfare. It’s been strictlyRay Hadley and 
need to know for PDudds in the national campaign since that edifying outburst.

But today Dutton smells a rat with Bill Shorten talking transparency in 
detention centres. This is all a slippery slope to letting the people smugglers 
control Australia’s immigration program, Dutton thinks. It’s a tough sell to 
tell journalists that allowing them to scrutinise detention centres is the road 
to chaos, butPeter Dutton is a tough seller from way back.

Eventually the question rolls round to the controversial cleric. Dutton says 
the department is reviewing the case and the government has no tolerance for 
hate preaching.
 
A question is asked of the candidate for Swan about her previous criticism of 
Australia Day being on 26 January.Bill Shorten says Labor has no plans to 
change the date of Australia Day. He adds theLabor party
