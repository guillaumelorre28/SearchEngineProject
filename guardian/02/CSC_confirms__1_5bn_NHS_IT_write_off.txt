CSC has confirmed it is to write-off almost $1.5bn as a result of its 
involvement in the National Programme for IT (NPfIT).

In December 2011 the company, which had been contracted to supply electronic 
patient records systems to a number of NHS trusts,warned shareholders

 it may lose an amount equal to, or in excess of, its $1.49bn investment in the 
NPfIT.

That write-off was listed in its third quarter results, published this week 
<http://www.csc.com/investor_relations/press_releases/78621-csc_reports_third_quarter_2012_results%5C>
, which also recorded a $204m revenue reduction related to CSC's ongoing 
negotiations with the NHS.

The negotiations concern amendments to CSC's NPfIT contract, the results of 
which could see the scope of work the company carries out for the NHS reduced 
and the value of its contact lowered.

"We've been engaged in the discussions as you know for some time, but recently 
with the officials from the NHS as well as representatives from other relevant 
government departments, and I'd say these discussions have evolved into a 
potential go-forward framework that is currently in the government's review 
process," Mike Laphen, chief executive of CSC, told a conference call to 
discuss the company's third quarter results.

"We remain in discussions with UK government officials to reach a satisfactory 
way forward," he added.
