 The authenticity of the recording could not be immediately verified, but it 
bore the hallmarks of an al-Qaida video.

Divisions within the Taliban insurgent movement have emerged since the news 
last month of the death of Mullah Omar. The swift announcement that Mansoor, 
Omar’s longtime deputy, would be the new leader has riled many seniorTaliban 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban> figures, and Omar’s family said 
this month that it did not endorse the move.

 Mansoor’s position could be shored up by the vote of confidence by al-Qaida, 
which has maintained ties with the Taliban for almost two decades since the 
tenure of its founder and late leader Osama bin Laden.

 “As leader of the al-Qaida organisation for jihad, I offer our pledge of 
allegiance, renewing the path of Sheikh Osama and the devoted martyrs in their 
pledge to the commander of the faithful, the holy warrior Mullah Omar,” 
Zawahiri said.
