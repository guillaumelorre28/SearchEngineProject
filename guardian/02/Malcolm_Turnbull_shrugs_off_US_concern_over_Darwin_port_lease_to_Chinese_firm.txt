has shrugged off a “please explain” from the US about the leasing of the port 
of Darwin to a Chinese firm with alleged links to the People’s Liberation Army.

The port sale was raised by Barack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> during the first official 
meeting between the US president and the Australian prime minister on the 
sidelines of the Apec summit in Manila on Wednesday.

Turnbull suggested during a press conference at the start of the final day of 
Apec that he did not really understand the US concern because there was nothing 
at all furtive about theDarwin

The US is attentive to developments in northern Australia because of the 
military assets it has deployed

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/21/obama-foreign-policy-pivots-asia>
 to the Asia-Pacific region, which is a strategic posture concerned with 
countering China’s growing power in the region.


Just as the G20 in Turkey proved to be a summit within a summit about finding 
a political solution to the Syrian crisis

unsubtle assertion of its regional power

.

On the sidelines of Apec late on Wednesday, Obama declared that China must stop
reclaiming lands in the disputed South China Sea

.

After meeting the summit host, the president of the Philippines, Obama said 
the US and Manila had agreed on the need for “bold steps to lower tensions, 
including pledging to halt reclamation, new construction and militarisation of 
disputed islands in the SouthChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> 
Sea”.

 The US and China are also facing off at Apec with duelling proposals on free 
trade.

Obama is advancing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a Pacific rim agreement 
which, if ratified, will deliver the largest free trade zone in the world and 
impose a new set of legal standards in a number of developing countries.

China is meanwhile extolling the virtues of a free trade area in Asia Pacific 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific>. The US once supported the 
free trade zone area, but moved on to prioritising the push for the TPP. China 
is not part of the TPP.

With the periodic public chest bumping between Washington and Beijing, and 
with the specific sensitivities on ample display in Manila, the Obama 
administration told the Australians the US should have been kept in the loop 
about the proposed Darwin port sale.

 But the Australian prime minister shrugged off the critique. He told 
reporters the process surrounding the Darwin port sale was entirely within the 
public domain.

The defence secretary, Dennis Richardson, has said he had no security concerns 
with the sale. Turnbull reiterated that line on Thursday.

“The fact that the Darwin port was being privatised was not a secret. It was 
announced publicly early last year,” Turnbull said.

It was “hardly a secret” that Chinese investors were on the hunt for 
Australian infrastructure, he said.

“All I can say is that, when it was first raised with me not by President 
Obama but by other American officials some weeks ago, it was put to me that the 
first thing they had read about it was in the Wall Street Journal.

“And my observation was only, of course, seeking to encourage the circulation 
of great Australian newspapers, I suggested they should invest in a 
subscription to theNorthern Territory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory> News because it 
was not a secret.”

The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, told reporters Turnbull had mishandled the 
sensitivities of the port sale with the Americans. He said he hoped “this 
government doesn’t still have its training wheels on”.

Turnbull later departed for the leader’s retreat. A communiqué was expected to 
be released later on Thursday.

 Turnbull will then fly on to Darwin and the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur 
before returning home on Monday.
