 (Reports, 18 November). I seem to remember that the army’s theatre equipment 
servicing is being sold off. I can’t keep track of how much public provision is 
now delivered by A4E, G4S, Serco etc, and the various shadowy outfits running 
probation or schools, or receiving lucrative NHS contracts. What I’d like for 
Christmas is a Guardian booklet identifying everything that used to be a public 
service or utility, or social housing or care home, that is now a nice little 
earner for some private company – along with an assessment of how much public 
money goes into these “providers”, how well they function, how much they donate 
to the political parties, which MPs or ministers are sponsored by them, or sit 
on their boards, or are married to their CEOs, and by how much we subsidise 
their low-paid employees. We need to know who owns Britain, who sold it, and 
how much it is costing us.
