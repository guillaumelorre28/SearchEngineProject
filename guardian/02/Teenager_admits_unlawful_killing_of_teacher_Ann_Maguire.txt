A 16-year-old boy has admitted to the unlawful killing of the teacher Ann 
Maguire <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ann-maguire> at a school in Leeds.

The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, did not enter a plea when 
he made a 15-minute video-link appearance at Leeds crown court.

But his barrister, Richard Wright QC, said the boy accepted that he had 
stabbed Maguire, 61, at Corpus Christi Catholic College, Halton Moor, on 28 
April.

A provisional trial date has been set for 3 November. The boy, who was 15 at 
the time of the killing, is due to make another court appearance via video-link 
on 26 September. He remains in custody.

Wright told the recorder of Leeds, Judge Peter Collier: "The position is that 
the defendant has indicated through ourselves and in a written note that he 
accepts responsibility for the unlawful killing of the deceased."

However, a plea will not be entered until expert reports have been completed 
and made available to both the prosecution and defence. Those reports would not 
be available until the end of August.

Wright added that Maguire's family had been informed of the boy's 
acknowledgement that he had carried out the killing.

Paul Greany, QC, prosecuting, said the teenager's position "does not amount to 
an admission that he is guilty of murder. It is that he is guilty of 
manslaughter."

The boy spoke only to confirm his name and say that he could hear the court 
clerk.

The judge issued a warning to bloggers and other users of social media that 
proceedings were active and the teenager must not be identified. Greeny told 
the court that people had already been imprisoned for doing so since the 
killing.
