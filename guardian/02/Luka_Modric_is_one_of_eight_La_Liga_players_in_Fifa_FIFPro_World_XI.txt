The Premier League’s sole representative a year ago, Ángel di María, is no 
longer with Manchester United, having joined Paris Saint-Germain in August, nor 
in the XI. Three players make their debut in the side,Luka Modric 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/luka-modric>, Neymar and Paul Pogba.

The Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer retained his place in goal and is 
the sole Bundesliga representative. The back four is made up of Dani Alves, 
Sergio Ramos, Thiago Silva and Marcelo – with Thiago Silva at PSG blocking 
total domination for La Liga. Similarly in midfield, Andrès Iniesta and Modric 
are joined by Juventus’s Pogba, while the forward three positions are 
unsurprisingly filled by Neymar, Lionel Messi andCristiano Ronaldo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ronaldo> – the latter two for a record 
ninth year.

Barcelona and Real Madrid boast four players each in the team of the year 
whereas last year they had only five representatives between them.

The 26,478 votes received is a new record for the team, with votes collected 
from 68 countries.
