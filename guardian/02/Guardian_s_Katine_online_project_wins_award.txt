Guardian News and Media last night won an award from the Association of Online 
Publishers <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aop> for its work with the 
Ugandan village of Katine.

The theguardian.com project, to follow a three-year scheme by the African 
Medical and Research Foundation and Farm-Africa to improve the lives of 25,000 
villagers, was named launch of 2008, beating projects by Channel 4, Hearst 
Digital and IPC Media; judges praised its innovative and unprecedented depth 
and focus.

Judges praised theguardian.com's innovative Katine site, singling it out its 
unprecedented depth and breadth while maintaining its focus on a single subject.

The project started in October 2007, when the Guardian and Observer agreed to 
support development work carried out by Amref and Farm-Africa in Katine, a 
rural sub-county of north-east Uganda.

The £2.5m project is being funded by donations from Guardian and Observer 
readers and Barclays, which initially gave £500,000 to the project and will 
match-fund donations over the course of the project up to £1m.
