Background

During the 1997 election campaign, Tony Blair made a firm commitment to 
introduce a crime and disorder bill targeting crime and anti-social behaviour 
within his first year in office.Crime was a key election issue 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blair-has-not-been-tough-on-the-causes-of-crime-says-woolf-560922.html>
, and both major parties competed to prove they were tougher on crime.

Labour's manifesto promised fast-track punishment 
<http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml> 
for persistent young offenders and community safety orders (these were later 
called anti-social behaviour orders) to deal with "threatening and disruptive 
criminal neighbours".

Echoing his famous "tough on crime" pledge, Tony Blair told voters that Labour 
would take a "zero tolerance 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/labour_conference/tuesday/182953.stm>" 
approach to crime, promising more convictions and a drop in violent crime.

When he announced the bill, home secretary Jack Straw said he wanted new laws 
to help build safer communities. His aim was to target persistent troublemakers 
and to allow their law-abiding neighbours freedom from fear and harassment.

The bill's key plank was its wholesale reform of the youth justice system. It 
formed the basis for a new youth justice framework document that legally 
enshrined preventing offending by children and young people as the principle 
aim of the youth justice system. The government also introduced a new range of 
penalties aimed at young offenders and associated orders aimed at their parents.

The bill's emphasis on parental responsibility caused embarrassment for the 
government when Straw's17-year-old son was cautioned  
<http://212.58.226.17:8080/1/low/uk/46890.stm>for supplying cannabis in January 
1998. The home secretary made light of the affair, admitting some of his 
cabinet colleagues had joked he was a prime candidate for a "parenting order".

Criticism

Civil liberties groups argue 
<http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/issues/7-asbos/index.shtml> that asbos 
mark an unacceptable blurring of criminal and civil law because while they are 
issued on a civil burden of proof (the "balance of probabilities"), a breach 
can incur criminal penalties including up to five years' imprisonment.

Children's rights campaigners <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4860384.stm> 
argue that asbos are disproportionately used to target young people. They point 
out that although many forms of anti-social behaviour can be alarming or 
distressing, they are often not criminal. Even though the original action may 
not be criminal, for example playing loud music, breaching an asbo can lead to 
a sentence of up to five years in prison.

Liberty has consistently expressed concern about the use of asbos, in 
particular their use against children and vulnerable people who need help and 
support.
