More than 600 suppliers have expressed an interest in joining the G-Cloud 
framework, the Cabinet Office has revealed.

The number, up significantly on previous government figures, was confirmed on 
the same day as the Cabinet Office announced its intent to award.

Notices to successful bidders were posted yesterday. Around one-third of more 
than 600 suppliers which put in bids are likely to have made it onto one of the 
four lots for the G-Cloud procurement. The Cabinet Office could not confirm the 
exact number when contacted by Guardian Government Computing, however.

The Â£60m framework covers four lots: infrastructure as a service, platform as 
a service, software as a service and specialist cloud services.

The G-Cloud procurement process was extended last year to give more suppliers 
the opportunity to participate. At the end of December 2011 there had been in 
excess of 500 expressions of interest in joining the framework from suppliers 
offering more than 1,600 cloud services.

The government plans to launch the first tranche of the G-Cloud catalogue 
later this month
