Move over David Coleman? It would seem football has a new sultan of slip-ups. 
ITV anchorman Adrian Chiles <https://www.theguardian.com/media/adrian-chiles> 
features twice in the top 10 list of pundits' bloopers for the season as chosen 
by a fantasy football firm. His ill-advised joke at the expense of Polish 
builders during an England match came in at number four. A quip made while a 
bore draw was in progress took the six spot after he said that anyone who was 
still bothering to watch the game on TV should write in and they'd get a fiver. 
Topping the chart of foot-in-mouth foul-ups was Southampton legend Matthew Le 
Tissier with this gem "Who'll win the league? It's a coin toss between the 
three of them?" He always did his talking with his feet. Although Adrian is in 
the limelight right now, for Monkey, Coleman is still king with this all-time 
great: "If that had gone in, it would have been a goal."
