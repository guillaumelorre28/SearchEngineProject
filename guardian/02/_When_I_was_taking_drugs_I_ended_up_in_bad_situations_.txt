Sok left home because his mother hit him and he was tired of looking after his 
many siblings. Life on the streets seemed to offer freedom and friendship with 
other children.

The reality was fear and violence, he says. "I was frightened a lot of the 
time. The gangsters on the streets would beat me up. I worked for a recycling 
boss who I'd bring cans for him to sell, if I didn't bring enough he'd also 
beat me."

Sok was introduced to glue sniffing, it made him feel brave and forget his 
hunger. It also made him addicted and ill.

M'Lop Tapang's social workers found him on the beach, he was collecting cans 
and had a deep abscess in his arm. They took him to the health clinic to have 
it drained and cleaned; had it had been left any longer he would have lost his 
arm.

Sok was introduced to M'Lop Tapang's drop-in drug centre and he slept there 
during the day. However he was still hooked on glue and spent the nights 
getting high on the streets. He explains why he quit.

 "One night it was raining so hard that I couldn't get back to the centre and 
I spent the night sleeping under a truck. While I was lying there I realised 
that when I was taking drugs I couldn't make decisions and I ended up in bad 
situations, so I decided to stop."

Sok is now a committed student with plans for his future "I want to learn 
about computers," he says. "All businesses need them and this way I can get a 
good job."
