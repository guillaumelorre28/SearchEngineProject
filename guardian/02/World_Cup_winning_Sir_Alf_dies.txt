England's World Cup-winning manager Sir Alf Ramsey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/alf-ramsey> has died aged 79 after a long 
illness.

 Sir Alf, manager of the national team from 1963 to 1974, guided England to 
football's biggest prize in 1966.

 During the World Cup finals last year he suffered a stroke, and today Ipswich 
Town, the club he used to manage, confirmed he had died in a nursing home 
earlier this week.

 Players who played under him described Sir Alf as a quiet, determined and 
brilliant manager.

 George Cohen, a right-back in 1966, said: "I am shocked and saddened. It is 
terribly sad.

 "Although we knew he was ill it is always going to be a shock when it comes 
around.

 "He was possibly the best manager I have ever played for and I think he is 
going to be sorely missed by all his friends and family."

 Alan Mullery, a midfielder in the 1970 World Cup campaign, said: "He was the 
best manager England have ever had. He was such a nice man and I don't think we 
will see another like him. When he said something he said it quietly but you 
listened - otherwise you didn't play in the next game."
