Robert Downey Jr has topped Forbes magazine’s annual list of the highest paid 
actors for the third year in a row 
<http://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2015/08/04/the-worlds-highest-paid-actors-2015-robert-downey-jr-leads-with-80-million-haul/>
. The Iron Man and Avengers star made an estimated $80m (£51m) over the past 12 
months, beating out fellow Hollywood behemoths such as Vin Diesel, Bradley 
Cooper and Tom Cruise.


However, in a startling development, four out of the top 10 wealthiest male 
film stars now hail from outside Hollywood, according to the latest edition of 
the annual survey. China’s Jackie Chan and Bollywood stars Amitabh Bachchan, 
Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar all finished ahead of established American actors 
such asMark Wahlberg <https://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-wahlberg>, Leonardo 
DiCaprio and Johnny Depp.

 Robert Downey Jr and the Avengers: Age of Ultron cast hit back at superhero 
movie critics 
The surprise results came after the financial magazine featured actors from 
international film industry meccas beyond the Hollywood bubble for the first 
time ever. The prominence of Asian actors comes as something of a shock because 
Chinese and Indian movies rarely feature on annual lists of the 
highest-grossing films across the globe. The most successfulBollywood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/bollywood> film of all time, last year’s PK, 
made just $120m globally, while the highest-grossing Chinese film, this year’s 
Monster Hunt, boasts $290m. Hollywood’s best effort, 2009’s Avatar, scored a 
staggering $2.78bn.

Downey Jr’s $80m earnings were thanks largely to a lucrative profit-share deal 
from the $1.39bn success of superhero epic Avengers: Age of Ultron, and a 
reported $40m payday for upcoming Marvel film Captain America: Civil War. 
“Downey Jr has been able to cut unique, favourable deals that ensure he is well 
compensated for his Tony Stark troubles,” Forbes’ Natalie Robehmed told The 
Guardian. “Movies featuring his Iron Man character still perform astronomically 
at the box office.”


The Hollywood star earned a full $30m more than second-placed Chan. The 
61-year-old Hong Kong-based martial arts star, who is popular in the west but 
an unmatched megastar in east Asia, made his $50m from highly profitable 
franchises such as the upcoming historical action movie Dragon Blade, as well 
as merchandise tie-ins and a cinema chain which trades under his name.

Vin Diesel <https://www.theguardian.com/film/vin-diesel>, star of the Fast & 
Furious movies, landed in third with earnings of $47m during the period 
recorded by Forbes (1 June, 2014 to 1 June, 2015) thanks largely to the box 
office success of the most recent instalment in the street racing saga. Fuelled 
by hype surrounding the death of star Paul Walker, Fast & Furious 7 scored 
$1.51bn globally earlier this year.

The top five was rounded out by Bradley Cooper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradley-cooper>, whose roles in box office 
smashes American Sniper and Guardians of the Galaxy last year helped earn him 
$41.5m, and Adam Sandler ($41m) who is generally considered to be a Hollywood 
star on the wane following a series of box office bombs but who benefited from 
a lucrative deal to screen his next four films exclusively on Netflix.

Sixth place, with $40m, went to Tom Cruise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomcruise>, who remains a high earner thanks 
to the box office success of the Mission: Impossible films, which he also 
produces.

Bachchan, the 72-year-old star of close to 200 Bollywood films, was the 
joint-top Indian actor on the list at No 7. He and Salman Khan, the 
controversial 49-year-old Mumbai-based megastar who has retained his popularity
despite a recent homicide conviction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/06/bollywood-star-salman-khan-found-guilty-over-hit-and-run-crash>
 relating to the drunken killing of a homeless man, both earned $33.5m. Kumar, 
the 47-year-old actor and martial artist who has appeared in hundreds of 
Hindi-language films, made ninth place with earnings of $32.5m, just ahead of 
Transformers star Mark Wahlberg ($32m).

Depp and DiCaprio, who have both topped Forbes’ list in the past, found 
themselves pushed outside the top 10 into 12th and 13th positions with earnings 
of $30m and $29m respectively, and Robehmed said it was no surprise that the 
Hollywood stars had been displaced.

“Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan <https://www.theguardian.com/film/salman-khan> 
and Akshay Kumar are Bollywood legends,” she said. “Bollywood movies gross far 
less at the box office, with nearly all their money from domestic ticketing. 
But movies cover costs by selling satellite rights to TV channels. And unlike 
the US, where first dollar gross deals are a thing of the past, Indian stars 
continue to earn a cut of each film’s ticketing revenue.

“Jackie Chan, meanwhile, has built an empire on brand extensions and East-West 
co-productions - helped by his special relationship with the Chinese 
government.”


The best-remunerated Briton was James Bond star Daniel Craig 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/danielcraig> in 15th, with earnings of $27m. 
Forbes’ list features only male stars. A female-only rundown is promised at an 
unspecified later date.
