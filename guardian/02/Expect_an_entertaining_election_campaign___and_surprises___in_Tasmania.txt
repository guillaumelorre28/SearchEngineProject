Tasmania <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tasmania> will provide an 
intriguing election sideshow to the big island ballyhoo in the battleground 
states.

The state has just five federal electorates – three Liberal, one Labor and one 
independent – but 12 senators for a population of a little over 500,000 people. 
What it lacks in lower house grunt, it more than makes up for in Senate 
firepower per capita.


And it’s the Senate that will provide the main act in what should be an 
entertaining election campaign – particularly in a double-dissolution election 
year.

Tasmania election: Greens and Labor blame each other for poor results

At a normal election, six senators are up for election (as with every other 
state). To win a spot a candidate needs a quota of 14.3%. In 2013 in Tasmania, 
that was about 48,000 votes. At a double dissolution that figure is roughly 
halved to 7.7% – or just 24,000 votes. Compare that with the quota needed in 
New South Wales at the 2013 election of 625,000 and it’s obvious that it 
doesn’t take much to throw results off-course in the diminutive southern state.

The Liberals are still riding high with a commanding lead in opinion polls 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-04/liberals-maintain-strong-lead-in-latest-tasmanian-opinion-poll/7221510>

election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/15/labor-swept-from-power-in-tasmania-after-16-years-in-government>
, which ended 16 years of Labor party rule. And in 2013 the party picked up 
three federal seats, helping propel the former prime minister Tony Abbott to 
victory.

But for all the party’s successes in the traditionally Labor-dominated state, 
the prime minister,Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull>, may struggle for 
an invitation to campaign there.

Out of the seven federal Liberals, only one – Senator Richard Colbeck – 
supported Turnbull’s challenge to become prime minister, winning himself a 
promotion to the tourism portfolio, but a demotion to a career-threatening 
fifth on the Senate ticket by the state’s Liberal headquarters.

The Tasmanian Liberals, led by Eric Abetz and dominated by Abbott-cheering 
conservatives, hold four Senate seats and three lower house seats. Those three 
electorates are all marginal – Lyons is held by just 1.2%, Braddon by 2.6% and 
Bass by 4% – and were all won from Labor at the 2013 election. Butwill the 
self-described “three amigos” holding the seats 
<http://www.themercury.com.au/news/politics/polling-shock-hits-liberals-three-amigos-andrew-nikolic-brett-whiteley-and-eric-hutchinson/news-story/42989a0d13aaa1e1474a67a65f2f04da>
– Eric Hutchinson in Lyons, Brett Whiteley in Braddon and Andrew Nikolic in 
Bass – ride again?

There is no state-focused polling to draw upon, but the Tasmania-based 
election analyst and blogger Kevin Bonham says the effects ofthe sophomore surge
 
<http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/mumble/index.php/theaustralian/comments/todays_cumulative_newspoll/>
 combined with national polling mean it’s unlikely they’ll be unseated.

 “The new members will get a new personal vote at this election, replacing the 
personal vote of the previous Labor members in those seats,” Bonham says. “They 
will get a leg-up from that and those seats are not as marginal as they look 
because of it.”

The University of Tasmania political scientist Dr Richard Eccleston agrees, 
but warns Nikolic could be in for a bumpy ride. “It’s being argued that Nikolic 
is the most vulnerable of [the] three,” Eccleston says.

“He’s been a strong, outspoken supporter of Tony Abbott and the Labor 
candidate Ross Hart is a relatively high-profile local solicitor who has been 
running a strong campaign.”

In the Senate, both experts say the government will hold all four of its 
current seats but Bonham says there might be a few surprises owing to the 
party’s unpopular preselection choices.

“[There were] no women, [they] stacked the ticket with rightwingers, and 
demoted their only moderate senator [Colbeck] to a difficult position,” Bonham 
said. “There could be quite a bit of voting below the line in Tasmania and that 
might provide some interesting results.”

Eccleston says the Liberals’ decision to run an all-male ticket and the 
sidelining of Colbeck was not a good look for the party.

Tasmania election: an uneasy sense of deja vu hangs over Labor

“Eric Abetz is a controversial and divisive figure. Colbeck’s relegation 
raised eyebrows. This could lead to Liberal voters voting below the line and 
allocating their own preferences, leading to leakage from the Liberal ticket.”

Labor can retain its five Senate seats but, both experts say, it will likely 
have to do so by taking the tricky 12th Senate spot, something of a preferences 
lottery.

If it fails, that 12th spot could be left open for a third Green or Jacqui 
Lambie’s running mate, the Rural Health Tasmania chief executive, Rob Waterman.

Lambie’s Jacqui Lambie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/jacqui-lambie> Network is expected 
to gain at least a quota, both experts say, a task made easier for her by the 
double dissolution. In 2013, running under the Palmer United party banner, she 
obtained 22,184 votes in total – or 6.58%, just shy of what she will need for 
an outright quota this time around.

Bonham points out that Tasmania has an affection for electing independents to 
the Senate. The conservative independent Brian Harradine was Australia’s 
longest serving independent senator, representing the state from 1975 until 
2005.

“[Lambie’s] made enough noise to have a high-enough profile, [and] seems to 
have avoided saying so many stupid things as she’s gained experience,” he said.

Eccleston says Lambie is likely to have reasonable support. “It hasn’t been 
tested but it’s your traditional blue-collar support base. Although, 
geographically her stronghold is the north-west coast, a Liberal stronghold. 
The Liberals have more to fear from Lambie than Labor.”

Bonham says the Greens will hold their two Senate spots, while Eccleston tips 
a possible third seat – the same 12th spot that will be decided on a mess of 
preferences.


“If there’s a bitter, underwhelming, opportunistic campaign between the major 
parties then that will certainly benefit the Greens in Tasmania,” Eccleston 
says.

“The Greens could get a third seat. That’s one of the reasons why, for the 
last 20 years, there’s been a reluctance to call a double dissolution, because 
of the worry it will increase the Greens’ Senate representation.”


Meanwhile, the independent Andrew Wilkie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/andrew-wilkie> in the lower house 
seat of Denison should win comfortably. He has already hit the airwaves this 
week saying he wouldn’t support any party to form government in the event of a 
hung parliament, surely a sign of confidence?

If a hung parliament does eventuate, and a Tasmanian holds the casting vote, 
it would be a turnaround for the underdog of the federation. And we’ll find out 
in just 53 days from now. Don’t hold your breath.
