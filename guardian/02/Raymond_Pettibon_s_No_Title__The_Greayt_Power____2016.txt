Writing on the wall

The style is scratchy, suggesting old-fashioned illustration, cartoon and 
doodle. The turquoise and purple colouring vibrates like a bad trip. Then 
there’s the text: fragmentary, poetic, overblown, funny spelling. This ink 
drawing of Joan Crawford could only be the handiwork of Raymond Pettibon.

Punk

Pettibon’s early works graced sleeves and fliers of bands such as Black Flag 
and Sonic Youth and self-published ’zines. Although he’s often been the subject 
of major museum shows, punk’s disaffection still echoes through his distinct 
oeuvre.

Pulp fiction

There are thousands of drawings to his name and their disorienting effect is 
perhaps best experienced en masse. In his unique mesh of oblique cultural 
satire and existential musing, Pettibon collides low and high-brow, the pulpy 
and the philosophical.

Bad dreams

Alongside surfers, Charles Manson and erect penises, the demon mother movie 
star Crawford has been a recurring subject. A femme fatale, she’s a neat symbol 
of the American dream gone toxic. Her image is upended by what seems both grand 
existential outcry and unfinished internal mutterings.
