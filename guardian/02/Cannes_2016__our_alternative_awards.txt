Best unprompted supporting-character speech in The Last Face: “You know that 
girl I was dancing with? She watched her sister get raped to death and she was 
raped as well. They ripped her from her vagina to her anus. She leaks urine but 
she still loves dancing.”

Best nugget of female wisdom in The Last Face: “Being inside me is not knowing 
me.”

Best nugget of male wisdom in The Last Face: “It is not grabbing. It is 
loving.”

Best reassurance to your girlfriend that you have offered comfort to her 
cousin, who you were previously sleeping with, in The Last Face: “I told her I 
loved her but I said I didn’t love her the way I loved you.”

Best moment of very many in the voiceover for The Last Face: “There’s 
something in propinquity perhaps not to be confused with fate.”
