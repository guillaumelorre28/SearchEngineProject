outrage”

 in the States because they are said to have“editorialised the gun violence 
issue”

.

The shoot-from-the-lip pro-guns Texas senator Ted Cruz was pictured by the 
Associated Press <https://www.theguardian.com/media/associated-press> 
photographer Charlie Neibergall while speaking at a “celebrate the 2nd 
amendment” event at a shooting range in Iowa at the weekend.*

Conservatives immediately turned on the news agency, which released a 
statement saying the five photos it issued “were not intended to portray 
Senator Cruz in a negative light”.

After “consideration”, said the statement, “we have decided to remove those 
photos from further licensing through AP Images”.

One prominent conservative, Ann Coulter, was unimpressed with AP’s response. 
She said on Fox News:“That is so outrageous.

 Don’t insult our intelligence by saying, ‘oh, we didn’t even notice’”.


*I should explain that the image - which has been taken down to comply with 
AP’s decision to withdraw its licence - pictured Cruz in the foreground with a 
poster behind him in which a large gun appeared to be aimed at his head.
