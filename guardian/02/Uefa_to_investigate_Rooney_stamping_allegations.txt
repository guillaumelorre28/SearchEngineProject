Wayne Rooney could miss the next round of the Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> after Uefa said it would 
investigate a claim that the striker stamped on Aalborg's Kasper Risgard during 
last night's match at Old Trafford.

"We are aware of the incident and the disciplinary panel will study the 
footage and newspaper reports before deciding whether to take action," said a 
Uefa spokesman today.

Rooney clashed with a number of Aalborg players during the match and he 
appeared to bring down his studs on Risgard when his opponent was on the floor.

"I don't know what he was thinking but he jumped on my chest," said Risgard 
after the game. "I don't know why but I think he was a little bit frustrated. 
But I don't understand it because they were playing good football and the score 
was 1-1 at the time."

Risgard also added that Rooney had shown contrition after the game. "Anywhere 
else but this place it would have been a red card," he added. "These challenges 
happen in football - I have some big marks - but I do think it looks good on 
television. He did come and apologise to me after the game."

A decision is unlikely to be made today, but if found guilty Rooney would face 
suspension for part of the knockout stages of the Champions League.
