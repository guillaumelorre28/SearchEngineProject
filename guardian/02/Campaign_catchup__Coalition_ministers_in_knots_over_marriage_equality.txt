In these closing days of the election campaign, it’s important to present a 
united front. But the divisions in the Liberal camp have been on full display 
this week, giving voters a less than reassuring glimpse of a future under the
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>.

The point of contention continues to be the marriage equality plebiscite. 
Scott Morrison, the treasurer, dug his heels in 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/29/scott-morrison-and-julie-bishop-will-not-confirm-they-will-vote-for-marriage-equality>
 on ABC on Wednesday night, refusing to giveLeigh Sales any answer to “Will you 
vote for same-sex marriage?” other than “I will respect the outcome of the 
plebiscite” – though you might reasonably infer, from his insistence, that the 
answer is: “No.”

Julie Bishop also refused to confirm that she would vote in favour of marriage 
equality, telling ABC’s Lateline she supported the plebiscite and “this is all 
hypothetical” anyway.

On these divisions, Malcolm Turnbull said there may be government MPs who 
“choose to abstain” from a vote – but that there was no question that if people 
voted yes at the plebiscite then parliament would legislate to end the current 
discrimination, maybe even before the end of the year. “It will sail through 
the parliament. Believe me.”

How can you be sure? “Because I have a very good understanding of 
parliamentarians and the realities of politics.”

Could this issue tear your party apart? “Look, I honestly think that you are – 
you are – you run the risk of exaggerating this.”

This isn’t a testy conversation about a single issue, it’s a proxy fight in 
public about the exercise of power post-election, wroteGuardian Australia’s  
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/jun/29/australian-election-2016-morrison-wont-say-whether-he-would-vote-in-line-with-plebiscite-politics-live>

. As such it leaves the prime minister vulnerable: “If Turnbull wins on 
Saturday, he’d better hope the victory is emphatic.”

Richard Di Natale of the Greens argued similarly today – that the division 
over the plebiscite showed that, contrary to the received wisdom, a vote for 
the Coalition is in fact one forinstability. “What Malcolm Turnbull is sitting 
on inside his party room is a ticking time bomb. They are divided. They are a 
party room that will splinter and fragment if they win the election.”

Though Labor is on the record as putting marriage equality to a vote within 
100 days if elected,Bill Shorten hasn’t escaped the fracas unscathed. The 
Australian hasrecorded him expressing support 
<http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/federal-election-2016-bill-shorten-flips-on-gay-plebiscite/news-story/fd7f72809333817973db6448f554e371>
 for a plebiscite on marriage equality three years ago. He doesn’t now.


Robin Thicke was on top of the charts three years ago 
<http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2013-06-29>. He isn’t now.

It seems fairly straightforward to get your head around. Community attitudes 
have moved on in Australia, said Shorten by way of explanation for those who 
demanded one. (He was talking about marriage equality, but it’s true of Thicke, 
too.)

Shorten said he no longer thought a plebiscite was a good idea after seeing 
the “really ugly and repugnant” arguments that emerged during the Irish 
referendum on marriage equality.

Bill Shorten on marriage equality plebiscite: ‘The mood in Australia has 
changed’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jun/29/bill-shorten-on-marriage-equality-plebiscite-the-mood-in-australia-has-changed-video>
Another independents’ day?

Even beyond the marriage equality plebiscite, neither Turnbull nor anyone else 
can really guarantee stability after the election.

The polls show Saturday’s result is a close-run thing with whoever’s 
victorious facing the risk of a hung parliament – and then there’s the Senate. 
Whichever party is elected, both Labor and the Coalitionface challenges 
enacting their election promises 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/29/turnbulls-tax-cuts-and-savings-would-face-senate-roadblock-after-election>
.

In particular, the Coalition’s full company tax cut plan – the centrepiece of 
its budget – and many of its long-stalled “zombie” savings have little chance 
of becoming law after the election, a Guardian Australiasurvey has revealed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/29/turnbulls-tax-cuts-and-savings-would-face-senate-roadblock-after-election>
.

That’s despite Turnbull’s claim that only Labor would face the “chaos” of 
negotiations with minor parties and independents.

And if Shorten was to form government after Saturday, he would be forced to 
negotiate to get his plans to limit negative gearing and capital gains tax 
concessions through the Senate.

The greatest story not yet really told

Remember climate change?

Just about the last time it was mentioned this campaign was during the Sydney 
storms 
<https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2016/jun/08/sydney-storm-beachside-homes-at-risk-of-collapse-as-gales-expected>
 earlier this month, when Turnbull and Shorten both deflected questions over 
the increasing likelihood of severe weather events with variations of “please, 
you vultures, now’s not this time”.

Well, we might not have heard much about it, but it’s still happening.


Here’s Lenore Taylor’s short-and-sharp video explainer of their policies.

 (Fairfax) Fairfax’s photographerNic Walker joined forces with Instagram and 
Facebook to try to “humanise the politicians” by snapping their reactions as 
they were shown pictures of their family, their partners, their political 
nemeses, and figures in pop culture.

Barnaby Joyce, the deputy PM, was reportedly “happy to have gotten off 
lightly” with his (unknown) prompts, reported the Herald: “I was expecting you 
to show me a picture of a naked chick or something!”

Turnbull has been picked as the winner of the election by what else but a 
psychic crocodile. The reptile’s result was reported by what else by the 
Northern Territory News, which suggested in trademark caps on Twitter that this 
was how all election should be held: “HONESTLY, WHERE’S VOTING GOT US THE LAST 
9 YEARS?”

Fair cop – rather, fair croc – as Crikey politics editor Bernard Keane seemed 
to acknowledge 
<https://twitter.com/BernardKeane/status/747916742236737536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>
: “This is about as accurate as every poll available at the moment.”

In Midland, Western Australia, Ken Wyatt, the assistant minister for health, 
and the former prime ministerJohn Howard threw their weight behind another 
alternative. Digital enhancement of the “coffee bean poll” (“a relaxing way to 
have your say”) appears to show the Liberals at second place, behind by a 
margin of approximately 70 beans.
