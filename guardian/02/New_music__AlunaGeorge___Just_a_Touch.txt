Before Aluna Francis and George Reid fused their first names to become 
AlunaGeorge they were taking themselves very seriously in other bands. George 
was in a math rock group, while Aluna was in an experimental electronic 
"collective" whose songs were so complicated they had trouble playing them 
live. One of the great things about AlunaGeorge is you can sense the relief 
they must have felt when they started working together; their music is joyously 
melodic, combining electronic textures, R&B motifs and massive pop hooks.You 
Know You Like It <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmXZuv5BaHg> is a case in 
point: its ping-pong beat, soft synths and inescapable central hook ("You know 
you like it but it drives you insane") sounding like the sort of music you'd 
imagine Aaliyah and Timbaland to be making in 2012. Even better is Just a 
Touch, with Aluna's vocal sounding sensual and sad. Again, it builds towards a 
brilliant, unashamedly massive chorus that separates them from the blog pack.
