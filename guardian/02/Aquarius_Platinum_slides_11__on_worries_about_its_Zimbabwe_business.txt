Shares in Aquarius Platinum have slumped 11% on worries about the future of 
its joint venture in Zimbabwe.

The country's government has rejected a local ownership plan from Mimosa 
Holdings, a 50-50 joint venture between Aquarius and Impala Platinum. Legally, 
foreign miners have to sell a 51% stake to local Zimbabweans but a portion of 
the two companies' plan has been knocked back. Unless an agreement was reached 
within 30 days, a government minister said enforcement mechanisms would be 
activated. Analysts at Numis said:
 This seems to be at odds with recent comments from the minister that Impala 
should dispose of its interest in Mimosa and leave Aquarius as the shareholder 
of reference for funding and technical support. We await further details but it 
appears things are going from bad to worse, with Aquarius flagging its concern 
over the development.

Indeed it did. In a statement Aquarius said:
 [The company] is concerned to note the statement by the minister and advises 
shareholders that negotiations with the minister will be undertaken in an 
attempt to reach a mutually acceptable solution.

Meanwhile analyst Asa Bridle at Seymour Pierce said:
 Though the indigenisation policy has been flagged as an issue for sometime, 
the speed and potential severity of this latest action by the government is 
alarming, particularly as Mimosa has been the stand out operation for Aquarius 
in recent times with itsSouth African operations underperforming.

 As a result we move our recommendation from buy to under review and await 
further news from the company. 
In the market Aquarius shares are currently down 16.6p at 129.5p.
