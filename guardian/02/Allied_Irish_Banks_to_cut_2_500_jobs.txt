Allied Irish Banks <https://www.theguardian.com/business/allied-irish-bank>, 
one of the banks rescued by the Irish taxpayer and the international bailout, 
is to announce 2,500 redundancies on Thursday.

The announcement is a blow to the economy after earlier data on Wednesday 
showed that there had been growth in some sectors towards the last quarter of 
2011.

It is understood that AIB will reveal the extent of the job losses during a 
meeting with staff in Dublin on Thursday.

The union representing bank staff in the Republic, the Irish Bank Officials' 
Association <http://www.iboa.ie/> (IBOA), is seeking urgent meetings with both 
Ireland's department of finance and AIB senior management.

IBOA general secretary Larry Broderick said the union is "unable to comment on 
the accuracy of the recent speculation since the Bank has yet to provide us 
with details of its proposals.

"The union is, therefore, seeking these meetings in order to clarify the 
future direction of the Bank and the likely implications of any change for 
staff and customers."
