Offhand

“Often there’s an offhand quality to the work.” So says Lai about his recent 
output, all of which has involved objects, from lampshades to concrete blocks, 
arranged in an oddly poetic manner that belies and undermines their otherwise 
prosaic nature. Here, a blue bucket, attached to a wall, is partially filled 
with uncooked rice.

An encounter

Art <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art> so often uses a visual 
motif to communicate something else; X represents Y. Yet, for Lai, this is not 
the case. The bucket remains a bucket; the rice remains rice. Yet Lai is no 
Duchamp. Combined, his objects become something else, an invitation perhaps to 
think about our encounter.

Decipher

We look, we grasp for analogy: the rice, perhaps a landmass on the sea-blue 
container. This doesn’t help us with deciphering a meaning, but it helps us to 
process how we are looking. The objects are stripped of their use, and become 
materials in an abstract composition.

Relationships

The bucket and rice will sit among further objects in Lai’s solo show. There 
they will form more relationships, more encounters with other things and also, 
importantly, with bodies as the visitor walks around them, each intuiting them 
in their own way.
