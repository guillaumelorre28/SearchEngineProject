Larry Elliott: China tells Davos 'no hard landing ahead'

And finally.... Larry Elliott has the full story on Chinese premier Li’s 
speech toDavos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> tonight:

China’s premier Li Keqiang said his country would avoid a hard landing as he 
shrugged off concerns about his country’s slowing growth rate.

In his keynote address to the World Economic Forum, Li admitted that 2015 
would be a tough year for the economy as it adjusted to a slower pace of 
expansion.

“China’s economy will face substantial further downward pressure in 2015”, the 
Chinese premier said as he insisted that there would be no deviation from the 
focus on structural reform and better-balanced growth.”

At present, China has entered the stage of the new normal, shifting from high 
speed to medium to high speed. That makes structural reform all the more 
necessary.”

China’s grew at 7.4% in 2014, its slowest rate in 15 years, with the annual 
growth rate in the fourth quarter of the year just above 6%. The slowdown is 
part of a deliberate strategy by Beijing to deal with the problems caused by 
the enormous stimulus programme introduced after the financial crisis of 2008, 
which saw credit expansion and large-scale investment in infrastructure.

Li said: 

“A financial crisis will not happen in China and China will not head for a 
hard landing.”

In answer to a question from the WEF’s founder, Klaus Schwab, Li said that the 
easing of restrictions on the use of China’s currency, the renminbi, would 
continue gradually.

He added:

“Internationalisation is a long term process. China is still a developing 
country”.

And I think that’s all from Davos tonight. We’ll be back in the morning. 
Thanks for reading and commenting.GW.

The Ukrainian government just released a statement, confirming it has asked 
the IMF for more support (as reported earlier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jan/21/davos-2015-day-1-al-gore-matteo-renzi-li-keqiang-live#block-54bfd75de4b05d1b5afaf5c3>
).

In it, Ukraine Minister of Finance Natalie Jaresko argues that investors 
should welcome it (even though Ukraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine> is also planning to restructure its 
debt).

“The markets were expecting this step and should welcome it as it will provide 
the financial support Ukraine requires to jumpstart its economic recovery while 
yielding acceptable outcomes for all of our stakeholders.

Today’s decision gives international financial partners and creditors’ 
reassurance of the Ukrainian Government’s continued commitment to its ambitious 
reform programme and macro-economic stability.”

Lagarde: I intend to support Ukraine's request

Christine Lagarde also spoke, briefly, saying:

I have just received a request from president Porosheko, in the presence of 
his finance minister and the head of his central bank, for a new extended fund 
facility, or EFF, to replace the current SBA or standby arrangement.

This request I will submit to the board, which will be convened as quickly as 
possible in order to review the relevance of this EFF programme which I would 
certainly propose to support.

The EFF is for an extended period of time, so it is longer than the SBA. As a 
result its financing is also larger.

The existing SBA is around $17bn, and not enough to cover the damage suffered 
since the conflict with Russia started. Ukranian bonds have been tumbling in 
value in recent months, with traders concluding that it may default.

Lagarde also offered Poroshenko some support, saying:


This clearly is a demonstration of the Ukranian authorities to conduct serious 
long-term structural reforms in addition to also adjusting their fiscal policy 
to make sure the Ukranian economy is in a position to recover.

Ukraine’s finance minister didn’t say how much this new bailout would be.

But she says the request shows the strength of the partnership between Ukraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine> and the IMF.

The extended fund facility will help Ukraine to return to growth, rebuild its 
foreign exchange reserves, and restore financial stability.

Interesting... Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, just went into a bilateral 
meeting with Petro Poroshenko, presumably to discuss his need for a new bailout 
package (or ‘pillow’ as he dubbed it today).

I managed to squeeze in, briefly....

From Ukraine <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine> to Russia.....


At a session on “volatility as the new normal”, Russia’s deputy prime 
minister, Arkady Dvorkovich, downplayed the impact of crashing oil prices on 
Moscow.

 “There is some level where they will stabilise and that point is not far 
away”, he said.

Dvorkovich attacked sanctions against Russia as “stupid” and admitted that 
lower oil prices were hurting. But he said Moscow would use the reserves built 
up when oil prices were high to cover shortfalls in the budget.

“That’s why the oil price is not important for Russia as it was before,” he 
claimed.

At the same session, Ken Rogoff, Harvard professor and former chief economist 
at the IMF, said the impact of lower oil prices would be “pretty big”

The IMF has just cut its growth forecasts for 2015 but Rogoff argued that :

“People are underestimating how much it (the lower oil price) will help.”

 Larry Summers, former US Treasury Secretary, fears QE might not be a big 
enough boost to the eurozone economy Photograph: Bloomberg Television 
Larry Summers, a leading economist and former US Treasury Secretary, had some 
strong words on the outlook for the eurozone economy. He thinks it looks a lot 
like Japan did 20 years ago.

A day before the European Central Bank is expected to announce full-scale 
quantitative easing through a sovereign bond purchasing programme -€50bn a 
month is the latest speculation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jan/21/davos-2015-day-1-al-gore-matteo-renzi-li-keqiang-live#block-54bfc010e4b05d1b5afaf59f>
 - Summers told Bloomberg Television the cost of disappointing markets would be 
potentially very high.

However, he suspects that QE won’t be enough to prevent a bad situation in the 
eurozone - which is barely growing and has already slipped into deflation - 
from getting worse. The responsibility also rests with individual eurozone 
leaders, Summers said, (also suggesting Germany should relax its stance).

[A disappointment] won’t be good. [ECB President Mario Draghi] is an 
extraordinary guy. He’s had extraordinary pressure for years. The decisions he 
has made have been the right ones, but he’s been getting much less help than he 
should have.

I’m not sure monetary tools are going to be enough to reverse the situation. 
Europe is on the brink of a deflationary spiral that could threaten living 
standards for a decade.

The [eurozone] patient needs a different attitude from Germany, a 
substantially strengthened effort to stand behind its financial institutions, 
and a set of reforms on the structural side. To try and starve the patient with 
austerity is a strategy that will produce spasmodic radicalism. It is setting 
back the cause of reform. Europe needs to change course.

Quantitative easing is one piece of the puzzle. The fundamental truth people 
have to recognise is this: the era of central bank improvisation as a central 
growth strategy has to come to an end if we are to avoid the fate of secular 
stagnation.

What is striking in Europe is how much it looks like Japan several years after 
the bubble. Europe is very much in the place Japan found itself in the mid 
1990s. Japan did not succeed in breaking out of that. That is the risk for 
Europe, if there isn’t a growth strategy beyond Draghi doing his best.

The historical evidence is clear that this idea that austerity drives 
productive reform is not supported by any of experience of human nature. Any 
policy for changing a human institution has to have carrots and sticks.

ECB reportedly planning €50bn a month QE

Kathleen Brooks at Forex.com said:

This would disappoint the market. A €500bn one-off QE package may be 
considered too paltry to make a difference, especially since the Bank of Japan 
has committed to do more than this each year until its CPI rate rises to 2%.

We would expect a sharp knee jerk reaction lower in stocks, bond yields could 
also rise, which could put upward pressure on the euro in the short term. 
Overall, we think a QE disappointment would be a long-term negative for the 
euro, as it would increase pressure to take action in the coming months.

And finally.... Larry Elliott has the full story on Chinese premier Li’s 
speech toDavos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> tonight:
 Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. Photograph: Michel Euler/AP 
China’s premier Li Keqiang said his country would avoid a hard landing as he 
shrugged off concerns about his country’s slowing growth rate.

In his keynote address to the World Economic Forum, Li admitted that 2015 
would be a tough year for the economy as it adjusted to a slower pace of 
expansion.

“China’s economy will face substantial further downward pressure in 2015”, the 
Chinese premier said as he insisted that there would be no deviation from the 
focus on structural reform and better-balanced growth.”

At present, China has entered the stage of the new normal, shifting from high 
speed to medium to high speed. That makes structural reform all the more 
necessary.”

China’s grew at 7.4% in 2014, its slowest rate in 15 years, with the annual 
growth rate in the fourth quarter of the year just above 6%. The slowdown is 
part of a deliberate strategy by Beijing to deal with the problems caused by 
the enormous stimulus programme introduced after the financial crisis of 2008, 
which saw credit expansion and large-scale investment in infrastructure.

Li said: 

“A financial crisis will not happen in China and China will not head for a 
hard landing.”

In answer to a question from the WEF’s founder, Klaus Schwab, Li said that the 
easing of restrictions on the use of China’s currency, the renminbi, would 
continue gradually.

He added:

“Internationalisation is a long term process. China is still a developing 
country”.

And I think that’s all from Davos tonight. We’ll be back in the morning. 
Thanks for reading and commenting.GW.
 
The Ukrainian government just released a statement, confirming it has asked 
the IMF for more support (as reported earlier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jan/21/davos-2015-day-1-al-gore-matteo-renzi-li-keqiang-live#block-54bfd75de4b05d1b5afaf5c3>
).

In it, Ukraine Minister of Finance Natalie Jaresko argues that investors 
should welcome it (even though Ukraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine> is also planning to restructure its 
debt).

“The markets were expecting this step and should welcome it as it will provide 
the financial support Ukraine requires to jumpstart its economic recovery while 
yielding acceptable outcomes for all of our stakeholders.

Today’s decision gives international financial partners and creditors’ 
reassurance of the Ukrainian Government’s continued commitment to its ambitious 
reform programme and macro-economic stability.”
 
Ukraine’s request for fresh funds from the IMF comes six weeks after it 
emerged that it needed an extra $15bn (details here

Christine Lagarde also spoke, briefly, saying:

I have just received a request from president Porosheko, in the presence of 
his finance minister and the head of his central bank, for a new extended fund 
facility, or EFF, to replace the current SBA or standby arrangement.

This request I will submit to the board, which will be convened as quickly as 
possible in order to review the relevance of this EFF programme which I would 
certainly propose to support.

The EFF is for an extended period of time, so it is longer than the SBA. As a 
result its financing is also larger.

The existing SBA is around $17bn, and not enough to cover the damage suffered 
since the conflict with Russia started. Ukranian bonds have been tumbling in 
value in recent months, with traders concluding that it may default.

Lagarde also offered Poroshenko some support, saying:


This clearly is a demonstration of the Ukranian authorities to conduct serious 
long-term structural reforms in addition to also adjusting their fiscal policy 
to make sure the Ukranian economy is in a position to recover.
 
Ukraine’s finance minister didn’t say how much this new bailout would be.

But she says the request shows the strength of the partnership between Ukraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine> and the IMF.

The extended fund facility will help Ukraine to return to growth, rebuild its 
foreign exchange reserves, and restore financial stability.
 
Breaking News: Ukraine <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine> is 
requesting an extended fund facility from the IMF, following the bilateral 
meeting between President Poroshenko and Christine Lagarde.

Natalia Yaresko, finance minister, and Lagarde just met the press to announce 
it.

Yaresko added that “We will also consult with the holders of our sovereign 
debt with a view to improving medium-term debt sustainability”.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told the World Economic Forum on

Moscow to withdraw them.

In a speech to the forum in Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos>
, Switzerland, he said the Russian troops were backed by a range of heavy 
weapons including tanks and artillery systems.

“If this is not aggression, what is aggression?” Poroshenko asked. He called 
on Moscow to comply with a peace plan and cooperate in closing the long joint 
border withUkraine <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine> and withdrawing 
Russian forces.

From Ukraine <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine> to Russia.....


At a session on “volatility as the new normal”, Russia’s deputy prime 
minister, Arkady Dvorkovich, downplayed the impact of crashing oil prices on 
Moscow.

 “There is some level where they will stabilise and that point is not far 
away”, he said.

Dvorkovich attacked sanctions against Russia as “stupid” and admitted that 
lower oil prices were hurting. But he said Moscow would use the reserves built 
up when oil prices were high to cover shortfalls in the budget.

“That’s why the oil price is not important for Russia as it was before,” he 
claimed.

At the same session, Ken Rogoff, Harvard professor and former chief economist 
at the IMF, said the impact of lower oil prices would be “pretty big”

The IMF has just cut its growth forecasts for 2015 but Rogoff argued that :

“People are underestimating how much it (the lower oil price) will help.”

This would disappoint the market. A €500bn one-off QE package may be 
considered too paltry to make a difference, especially since the Bank of Japan 
has committed to do more than this each year until its CPI rate rises to 2%.

We would expect a sharp knee jerk reaction lower in stocks, bond yields could 
also rise, which could put upward pressure on the euro in the short term. 
Overall, we think a QE disappointment would be a long-term negative for the 
euro, as it would increase pressure to take action in the coming months.
