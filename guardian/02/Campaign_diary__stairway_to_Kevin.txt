Quotes of the day

Tony Abbott on Sunday:

We've got a civil war going on in that benighted country between two pretty 
unsavoury sides. It's not goodies versus baddies – it's baddies versus baddies.

Kevin Rudd on Monday:

The last time I used the term goodies or baddies I think when I was playing 
cowboys and Indians in the backyard.

Liberal deputy Julie Bishop trying to explain:

What Tony Abbott was articulating is what many foreign policy analysts are 
saying. The situation in Syria is far more nuanced than the Manichean world 
view of good versus evil. On both sides of this conflict there are the bad guys.

Tony Abbott:

I think the odd use of a colloquialism is perfectly appropriate if you are 
trying to explain to the public exactly what the situation is.

Prop of the day: the Vegemite files

Not a stairway to heaven but a stairway to Kevin. He mounted stairs for a 
photo with apprentices in Gladstone – leading to the obvious analogies.

Candidated of the day

In case you have missed it, anti-pokies campaigner senator Nick Xenophon is in 
a death struggle withsenator Sarah Hanson-Young. They are not against each 
other but Xenophon's decision to preference major parties over Hanson-Young has 
incensed the Greens. The party's former leader Bob Brown has appeared in ads 
claiming a vote for Xenophon is a vote for the Coalition owing to his 
preferences, which has drawn fire from Mr X.

Xenophon, a master of the one-liner, showed he also loves a good stunt. 
Formerly the 'No Pokies' candidate, on Monday Xenophon became the No Porkies 
candidate and arrived with a pig wearing a cape displaying the Greens logo, 
accusing the party of breaching its own policy on political advertising.
