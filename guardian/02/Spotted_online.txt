A couple of weeks ago, our blogs expert, Benji Lanyado, sang the praises of 
Spotted by Locals 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/mar/18/local-city-guides-travel-websites>
 - a network ofEuropean city blogs  <http://www.spottedbylocals.com/>written by 
over 80 local bloggers. Since then they've won the best group authored blog in 
Lonely Planet's awards and have agreed to keep us in the loop with a monthly 
update of their favourite tips. Here's the first instalment

1. Stieg Litz 19 Antwerp by Niko Caignie
 Photograph: Niko Caignie 
Hidden in the beautiful belle epoque neighbourhood of Antwerp is a little 
gallery inside a house. This gallery is owned by a photographic enthusiast who 
wants to enable young photographers to display their work. He goes around the 
world to find them and offers them a jump to Europe/Belgium. It felt really 
strange to just walk up to the door, ring the bell and then enter someone's 
house to see an exhibition. But it also adds charm and value to the concept. 
Take your time to look at the displayed work and talk to the friendly owner of 
the gallery. He can tell you an awful lot about the artists and their work. So 
keep an eye on the website and whenever there's something that you like, don't 
hesitate to check it out. It might be a nice activity for a rainy day. It's not 
big, so you'll be in and out in about 45 minutes.

2. C/O Gallery Berlin by Sarah Curth

The impressive building that has housed the C/O Gallery since 2000 is the 
ancient imperial post office. Founded by a designer, a photographer and an 
architect, the gallery has become one of the biggest private art institutions 
in Berlin with temporary exhibitions of up-and-coming and famous photographers. 
The showrooms and the halls aren't renovated so the rooms contrast with the 
exhibits. Take a look at the bathrooms on the first floor where old and new 
design collides in a very interesting way. Until 24 May, there's a special 
exhibition: Annie Leibovitz, A Photographer's Life, 1990-2005, a collection of 
around 200 photographs of large format landscapes, private family photos and 
small black and white portraits.

3. La Ardosa, Madrid, by Nikko Hinderstein
 Photograph: Nikko Hinderstein 
Just off of busy Fuencarral, La Ardosa has a pleasant jazzy atmosphere. The 
bar is packed with paraphernalia dating back to 1892 when it was founded - a 
picture of the owner's family, famous people who have stopped in over the 
years, and reprints of Goya's "Caprichos" prints (silly, sometimes vulgar 
whimsical images). They serve some of my favourite tapas; sliced ham from pigs 
that have only eaten acorns (Jamon de bellota), dried tuna (Mojama - tuna 
jerky!), and a thick version of gazpacho called Salmorejo. The "raciones" are 
big here, so you can ask for a "media-ración" instead of a full plate. The 
drink menu is extensive as well, white wines, red wines, vermouth and various 
imported beers. If the bar looks full from the street, push through the crowd, 
duck under the bar, and try the back room which is not accessible any other way.

4. Cimitero Acattolico Rome by Annalaura D'Errico
 Photograph: Fabio Fontanella 
If you were Protestant, Jewish, or Christian Orthodox, and happened to die 
while visiting Rome in the 18th or 19th centuries, chances are you would have 
been buried in the Cimitero Acattolico near Piramide, aka the Protestant 
Cemetery. Catholic law prohibited non-Catholics from being buried in Catholic 
cemeteries. Given that there were growing numbers of Danes, Germans, English, 
Americans, Russians and Swedes coming to visit, study or live in Rome during in 
the 1800s, the Cimitero Acattolico became the designated area to bury these 
'stranieri'. Now, it is a place where you can get away from it all while 
contemplating the graves of the great. In what seems like a peaceful garden, 
just metres away from the bustle of the Piramide area, you will find the tombs 
of Shelley, Keats, and Gramsci, to name the most famous of the many poets, 
historians, archaeologists, painters, sculptors, diplomats and intellectuals 
buried here. For a complete listing, visit the cemetery's website or the 
information centre.

5. Basama Prague by Filip Grimm
 Photograph: Filip Grimm 
You may not be familiar with this type of venue - a tearoom where as well as 
tea you can get shisha, coffee, a variety of oriental sweets and snacks and 
also regular food and drinks (including beer as this is the Czech Republic). 
Tearooms are popular in Prague - many people go to them instead of pubs or 
cafes. Basama is a great place to talk, think, read, write, meet up or just 
listen to the music - which can be a surprising mix. I remember hearing 
experimental jazz back to back with the Audio Bullys. The tearoom is run by a 
friendly elderly pair. WiFi Internet is available. On the menu you can find 90 
different kinds of tea and more than 20 different flavours of hookah tobacco. 
As for the prices, tea costs from 30 to 80 CZK and hookah 90 CZK and 5 CZK for 
a charcoal.
