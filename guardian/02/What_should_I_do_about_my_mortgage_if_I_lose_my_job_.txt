Q I think I am about to be made redundant from my job - I work for a big 
pharmaceutical company which is firing a lot of employees in the UK. Although I 
will receive a small payout, it won't be very much, and I am worried because I 
have just completed on a new home. I need my salary to pay my mortgage 
instalments. Do you have any advice for someone in my position?

A First of all, talk to your union representative at work to make sure that if 
you do receive a redundancy notice, you are properly helped and advised. 
Secondly, have a look at the mortgage offer from your building society. You may 
have taken out mortgage protection, an insurance policy which will pay your 
monthly instalments if you lose your job or are too ill to work.

Check the details of this policy, as there may be a three-month exclusion 
period - meaning you won't receive any help for the first three months. Also, 
you may need to be applying for benefits in order to qualify. If in doubt, give 
your mortgage company a ring.

If you don't have this protection, it is still worth taking to your mortgage 
company to warn them about what has happened. Don't wait until the debts and 
arrears mount up - they may be able to reschedule your repayments so that they 
are much lower than normal for the next six months or until you find a new job.

Your next step depends on how quickly you think you might find another job - 
do you have transferable skills, or are to the areas you have been working in 
very specialist? It may be worth signing up with a couple of recruitment 
agencies in order to ensure that you have your CV in circulation to as many 
companies as possible.
