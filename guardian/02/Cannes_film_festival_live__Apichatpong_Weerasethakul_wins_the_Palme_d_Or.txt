6.33pm: We're going short and to the point for this year's Cannes live blog. 
Word has just come in that the Jury prize goes toUn Homme qui Crie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135870/un-homme-qui-crie> (A Screaming 
Man) - Chad's much-applauded entry

6.38pm: Another big shock: Mathieu Amalric takes best director for Tournee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135866/tournee>

6.40pm: Best screenplay goes to Poetry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135874/poetry>

6.44pm: Best actress: Juliette Binoche for Copie Conforme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135872/copie-conforme>

6.47pm: Our sources at the Palais inform us Binoche is holding up a sign 
protesting against the imprisonment of Iranian director Jafar Panahi

6.50pm: Best actor: Jarvier Bardem for Biutiful 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135869/biutiful>.

6.55pm: Word has come in that the best actor was actually awarded jointly - to 
Bardem and to one Illio Garmargo. That's almost certainly not the right 
spelling, incidentally

6.56pm: Grand Prix (ie runner up) to Des Hommes et des Dieux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135867/des-hommes-et-des-dieux> - no 
surprise there, but it means Mike Leigh, Apichatpong Weerasethakul and Rachid 
Bouchareb are all in the running for the big one

6.59pm: Confusion: has the Palme d'Or actually gone to La Nostra Vita 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135878/la-nostra-vita>?!

7.00pm: No - phew - it's Apichatpong Weerasethakul. Uncle Boonmee Who Can 
Recall His Past Lives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135882/uncle-bonmee-who-can-recall-his-past-lives>
 Paddy Power's 9/2 second favourite has won the Palme d'Or

7.04pm: La Nostra Vita mix up cleared up - best actor winner was Elio Germano

7.08pm: Well - some real shocks there. Amalric, especially, winning best 
director, while Leigh and Loach are to go home empty handed. Apichatpong 
Weerasethakul's victory was far from an inevitability, but evidently richly 
deserved. Stand by for analysis from Xan Brooks, a full news story from Mark 
Brown, winners' galleries, video vox pops fro the Croisette, and much more 
tomorrow.
