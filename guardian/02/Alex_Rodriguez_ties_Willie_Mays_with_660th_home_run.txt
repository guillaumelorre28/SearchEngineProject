Alex Rodriguez tied Willie Mays for fourth place in major league history with 
his 660th home run, breaking an eighth-inning tie with a pinch-hit shot that 
sent theNew York Yankees <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/new-york-yankees> 
to a 3-2 win over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night.


Yankees manager Joe Girardi left Rodriguez out of the starting line-up to rest 
him but sent him up to bat for Garrett Jones with one out in the eighth.

Rodriguez ran the count to 3-0, then lined a fastball from Junichi Tazawa 
(0-1) into the left-field seats above the Green Monster – his first career 
homer as a pinch hitter – and jogged around the bases to boos from the Fenway 
Park crowd.

Rodriguez’s record could achievement could cause problems though. He is due a 
$6m bonus for reaching a ‘milestone’ with his 66oth home run. However, the 
Yankees do not want to pay the bonus due to Rodriguez’s history with 
performance enhancing drugs.
