Full-time: Tottenham 5-1 Asteras

Who said the Europa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> was boring? Spurs win 
and well they should have. They were the better side. Kane was very good – 
except when he went in goal, of course – and capped a fine performance by 
taking home the match ball. However, it is Lamela and his utterly outrageous 
rabona that will be gracing your back pages tomorrow morning. Thanks for all 
your emails and tweets and comments. Speak soon! Night!

Barrales rolled the free-kick to the far corner of the net. It’s low and slow 
but Kane failed to get his body behind the ball and it crept over the line.

RED CARD! KANE GOES IN GOAL!

87 mins Lloris walks and well he should. Another ball over the top finds the 
Spurs defence all square like a 1-1 draw. He takes down Tsokanis a few yards 
out of his box, clearly stopping a goal scoring opportunity, and the referee is 
left with little choice. Free-kick to Asteras ...

Kane had broke into the box but Kosicky saved his effort from a few yards out. 
The ball broke across the goal and Fazio galloped to gather it. Once with the 
ball under control, he looked up and chipped a delightful one to the middle of 
the box. Under little pressure, Kane headed it home.

5 - Harry Kane has now scored five goals in his last four games for Tottenham 
(all competitions). Hurricane.

Spurs got a corner. They wasted that but got another. Lamela played it short 
to Dembélé. He drove a rasper at Kosicky, who could only spill the ball into 
the path of Kane. The striker poked the ball in from all of five yards. The 
Asteras defence wanted him done for offside. Never in a month.

69 mins Lamela will get this headlines but this is just as good from Lloris. 
The boys in front of him are caught out once again by a clipped ball over the 
top. This time it is Usero who is on the end of it. He smashes one at the 
French keeper who pulls of a magnificent reaction save at his near post.

When he can be bothered, he is very good and tonight, when scoring at least, 
he has been very good. He won the ball for his side high up the field, gave it 
to Kane and got it back in the box. Quick feet saw him dance around a few 
defenders but when he shoots the ball rebound off one defender’s legs and spins 
up into the air. Lamela kept his eye on the ball and executed a 
perfectly-hammered volley past Kosicky.

who was fouled takes it but it is a foul effort and Asteras get rid of the ball

58 mins Dembélé gets across Rolle and shoulders him to the ground. Asteras 
drift down the right from the resulting free-kick and then switch play to the 
left. Just inside the box, Tsokanis puts a dangerous ball across the face of 
the goal that Vertonghen is forced to hoof to safety. The Greeks are coming 
right back into it.

56 mins Asteras get a corner after some decent covering from Vertonghen. A bit 
of defensive panic kicks in before Kane kicks in and kicks the ball out for 
another one. That is sent to the edge of the box but when Asteras try to put it 
back in, order has been restored in the Spurs back-line and three players are 
caught offside.

fair share of suffering” pains José Bolivar. “I must say that a very famous 
(and somewhat proud national moment) that is rabona related came thanks to 
Andres Vasquez, who played (plays?) in Sweden for IFK Göteborg. He scored this 
beauty then he fell into obscurity and I never heard the name again. Beter than 
Lamela’s, huh?

51 mins Sankaré takes down Adebayor and somehow manages to avoid a yellow 
card. The resulting free-kick (about 35 yards out, just left of centre) is 
aimed, by Lamela, to Fazio but the centre-back is beaten to it by Panteliadis.

Lamela. He shoots but his effort is blocked and diverted out for Spurs’ first 
corner of the second half. Lamela it is who takes it but the Greek side soon 
rid their box of any danger.

47 mins “The best rabona I saw (no video proof, so it never happened, right?) 
was when I was at school and some friends of mine got jobs stocking shelves in 
a local supermarket,” reminisces Scapegoat. “We were playing football in the 
vegetable aisle with a cabbage, and unfortunately the trick shot in question 
hit an old lady who was busy feeling all the apples in a bin. The manager 
thought I’d done the shot in question, grabbed me and said ‘You’re fired’. I 
tried to look contrite, said ‘OK’ and left, but as I wasn’t actually an 
employee, the others kept their jobs … until the manager later caught them 
shoplifting a bunch of whiskey.”

37 mins Panteliadis chops down Townsend as a lumberjack would a tree. Unlike a 
lumberjack though, the defender gets a yellow card beside his name.

34 mins By the way, just moments before Lamela did his thing, Parra missed 
Asteras’ second golden opportunity of the game. In fairness to the striker, 
Lloris saved well at the near post and the rebound was blocked brilliantly by 
Davies but he still should have done better.

26 mins A free-kick to the Greek side is looped to the back post by 
Panteliadis. It finds Rick Rubin  Zisopoulos but his equally looping header 
loops its way over the bar. Speaking of loops, do they still make 
Loop-de-loops? They were great.

23 mins Capoue picks the ball up near the centre circle. He strides forward 
and plays the ball to Adebayor. The striker lays it back to Kane as Capoue 
continues his run. Kane finds that run but brave keeping from Kosicky keeps 
Spurs’ goal count at one.

21 mins Just saw a replay of that Tsokanis chance. It looked like he heard the 
keeper coming and pulled out of the chance. He’ll need to be a bit braver next 
time, he said, typing from the comfort of his office without having a big, 
hairy keeper bearing down on him at speed.

19 mins Spurs counter via Townsend on the right. He cuts inside and passes to 
Lamela. The ball goes back and then to the right to Davies. Adebayor then tires 
to muscle his way into the box but the Greeks repel him. Meanwhile, down the 
other end, Spurs are caught out by another long ball over the top and Tsokanis 
is this close to beating Lloris to the ball. The keeper was forced to clear the 
danger on the edge of his box with his head.

17 mins If you saw Kane’s goal against Besiktas, this one was very similar 
only from the other side.

Tottenham had spent the last few minutes playing a bit of keep ball in the 
Asteras half. Asteras had 10 players behind the ball but no one got out to Kane 
quick enough. He was serviced the ball by Dembélé a good 25 yards out on the 
right. He looked up, shifted the ball forward and struck it low and hard and 
into the far corner of the net. It as a wonderful, wonderful strike from an 
increasingly impressive player.

10 mins Davies concedes a free-kick for a foul on Mazza then Capoue does one 
on Parra. It’s all a bit scrappy at the moment, with no team really finding 
their feet and/or rhythm.

8 mins That was a dead good opportunity for Mazza. Asteras may come to regret 
that later on.

7 mins Spurs get a free-kick, bear the corner flag on the left, after an 
unfriendly shoulder barge by Lluy on Davies. Davies sends it over but Asteras 
deal with it. Moments later, a long ball over the top is misjudged by Dembélé 
and allows Mazza in on goal. He has time and space but at the edge of the area, 
he loses his cool and rolls a shot wide.

2 mins Spurs get an early throw on their left. It lands at the foot of 
Dembélé. He tried to Hollywood it across the pitch and in doing so he hacks it 
right out of play. Asteras get their throw and their first taste of the ball. 
They pass it around, exhibiting few early nerves.

1 mins The referee gives his whistle a short blast and it is off we go. Spurs 
are playing in their usual white number and doing so in a right to left 
fashion. Asteras are decked in a kit that has a solid strip of yellow 
surrounded by a sea of navy. The home side are the one who get us going.

It’s all over in Lille

will be happy as they leave the stadium with a point in their pocket, a point 
that sends them back to the top of their group.

So when you read that March 24 was the day that both Ivan Kruzliak and Chris 
Bosh were born on, the same day that Hickland and Hasselhoff became one and the 
same day that The Breakfast Club is set, you thought that day could not get any 
better, right?How wrong you were. Let Simon McMahon explain why. “Things that 
happen on March 24? It’s National Tree Planting Day in Uganda, you know,” he 
cheers.

Tonight, you shall be watching this mötley crüe do their respective things. 
Tottenham, it would seem, are taking the game pretty seriously by returning 
Adebayor and Townsend to their starting lineup. Joining them is Vertonghen, 
about whom speculation regarding his future just won’t go away, and Kane – who, 
along with Lloris, has been one of Spurs better players in this competition 
this season. Chadli who had been suffering with an unspecified injury makes the 
bench but Danny Rose and Kyle Naughton are not so lucky. As for Asteras, the 
curse of the preamble has struck for Barrales and he too will be watching from 
the comfort of the bench. Those teams in full then are as follows:


Tottenham: Lloris; Dier, Vertonghen, Fazio, Davies; Dembélé, Capoue; Lamela, 
Kane Townsend; Adebayor.Subs: Vorm, Chiriches, Lennon, Chadli, Eriksen, 
Stambouli, Soldado.

Asteras: Kosicky; Lluy, Zisopoulos, Sankaré, Panteliadis; Mazza, Usero, 
Munafo, Rolle, Tsokanis, Parra. Subs: Theodoropoulos, Kiriakopoulos, Fernández, 
Barrales, Bakasetas, Badibanga, Gianniotas.

Referee: Ivan Kruzliak (who is from Slovakia and who was born on the same day 
as Chris Bosh, which is also the same day that Catherine Hickland became the 
envy of all women around the world by marrying David Hasselhoff and also – and 
this isthe best thing you will read tonight – the same day upon which The 
Breakfast Club is set. Seriously. What a day, eh?)

Kick-off: 8:05pm

Hi, how are you?

The common consensus is that most players/fans would prefer to declare 
themselves a god <http://t.co/mNDjXIqGOc>, realise that meant sex was only for 
mortals, study monks and vasectomies and then perform one on themselves before 
jumping off a two-story balcony, rather than be associated with the Europa 
League. And somedays it’s hard to argue against that. In an already pretty 
crowded schedule, there are far too many games to reach the top, there are far 
too many teams trying to reach the top and the idea that a Champions League 
team can be rewarded for their failure in that competition by just swanning in 
and taking a place in the round of 32 makes the whole thing stink of farce and 
taste like that cheap and nasty, yellow pack rot-gut they used to sell in 
Quinnsworth.

And yet, glory is glory is glory is glory is glory is glory. Should Tottenham 
progress past the group stages, navigate the round of 32, do one over another 
in the round of 16, get a decent draw in the quarters, go hard in the semis and 
reach the final, you’d have to be one hella stubborn Spurs supporter/player not 
to get excited about the thought of winning a European trophy, especially given 
the Champions-League tasting carrot that is attached to it. Given their form 
and placing in the league right now ( Mauricio Pochettino wasn’t wrong when he 
called it “a tough period”) could that route be Tottenham’s best chance of 
traipsing across the biggest stage next seasons? Hmmm, yeah, maybe, but if so, 
they have already made life hard for themselves.
Their first game in the group C saw them enter an intimidating atmosphere in 
Belgrade and leave with a point, after some resolute rear-guard action and 
plenty of profligacy up front.Their second game saw them take on Besiktas, saw 
them played off the park and once more saw them end with a point, after Demba 
Ba converted a penalty one minute from time thanks to bone-headed defending 
from Vlad Chiriches. All of which has left Spurs in third place, two points 
behind the group leaders and tonight’s opposition, Asteras Tripoli.
You probably know (the Greece version of) Tripoli as the birth place of former 
Greek prime minister, Konstantinos Georgakopoulos, and for the fact that it is 
twinned with Peine, Germany, but, of late, Asteras Tripoli have been the reason 
for the southern city’s fame. It has been quite the rise for the Arcadians. 
Eleven years ago, they were playing in the fourth flight of the Greek league 
but it took them just another four to secure the back-to-back titles and take 
their spot in the Super League. Their first few season up top were shaky and 
there was a bit of slap and tickle with relegation but the the last three have 
been steadier and seen them record top six finishes, as well finish as 
runners-up in the Greek Cup.
To get where they are today, they have beaten Mainz, Maccabi Tel Aviv, 
Partizan and drawn away to Besiktas, so any one who thinks Spurs are going to 
have it easy tonight best take their thinking back to the drawing board. While 
there, they might want to think about the fact that the Greeks are unbeaten in 
five games. In his pre-match presser, Staikos Vergetis, indicated that his side 
would rock up at White Hart Lane with defence in mind (and that is what they 
worked on in the a cold north London last night) but this is a side that is 
laced with some silky and strong Argentinians, not least their main goal 
threat, Jerónimo Barrales (who know that he has been mentioned here will surely 
be dropped to the bench). They won’t stay back forever – though their back four 
will be hampered by the loss of Dorin Goian to an ankle injury – and they will 
look to hit and hurt Tottenham on the counter (only Mainz have stopped them 
from scoring in Europe this season).

This is going to be a tough one for Tottenham. News of the 11 men that 
Pochettino thinks can do this is on its its way, as is 90 minutes of football. 
Woop!

Who said the Europa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> was boring? Spurs win 
and well they should have. They were the better side. Kane was very good – 
except when he went in goal, of course – and capped a fine performance by 
taking home the match ball. However, it is Lamela and his utterly outrageous 
rabona that will be gracing your back pages tomorrow morning. Thanks for all 
your emails and tweets and comments. Speak soon! Night!

 
90 mins Three more minutes separate Spurs from a win. 

 
Barrales rolled the free-kick to the far corner of the net. It’s low and slow 
but Kane failed to get his body behind the ball and it crept over the line.

 
... and a goal to Asteras.

 
87 mins Lloris walks and well he should. Another ball over the top finds the 
Spurs defence all square like a 1-1 draw. He takes down Tsokanis a few yards 
out of his box, clearly stopping a goal scoring opportunity, and the referee is 
left with little choice. Free-kick to Asteras ...

 
85 mins  Lennon has come on for Townsend.
 
84 mins Squeaky bum time and all that:
Celtic Football Club (@celticfc) 
Celtic 2-1 FC Astra.

<https://twitter.com/celticfc/status/525386849057910784>  
Kane had broke into the box but Kosicky saved his effort from a few yards out. 
The ball broke across the goal and Fazio galloped to gather it. Once with the 
ball under control, he looked up and chipped a delightful one to the middle of 
the box. Under little pressure, Kane headed it home.
OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) 
5 - Harry Kane has now scored five goals in his last four games for Tottenham 
(all competitions). Hurricane.

<https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/525387036023205888>  
There’s the hat-trick.

 
80 mins Celtic, by the way, are two to the good but our Scottish correspondent 
is less than impressed.
Ewan Murray (@mrewanmurray) 
Saving grace for Celtic fans- imagine this team in the Champions League.

78 mins We have some Spurs subs to tell you about. Chadli is on for Adebayor 
and Eriksen replaces Lamela. And we have some Asteras sub news for you. Parra 
goes, Fernández comes.

 
Spurs got a corner. They wasted that but got another. Lamela played it short 
to Dembélé. He drove a rasper at Kosicky, who could only spill the ball into 
the path of Kane. The striker poked the ball in from all of five yards. The 
Asteras defence wanted him done for offside. Never in a month.

 
Too easy for Spurs.

72 mins Rolle is replaced by Barrales. Spurs have a corner. They do nowt with 
it.

 
69 mins Lamela will get this headlines but this is just as good from Lloris. 
The boys in front of him are caught out once again by a clipped ball over the 
top. This time it is Usero who is on the end of it. He smashes one at the 
French keeper who pulls of a magnificent reaction save at his near post.

 
When he can be bothered, he is very good and tonight, when scoring at least, 
he has been very good. He won the ball for his side high up the field, gave it 
to Kane and got it back in the box. Quick feet saw him dance around a few 
defenders but when he shoots the ball rebound off one defender’s legs and spins 
up into the air. Lamela kept his eye on the ball and executed a 
perfectly-hammered volley past Kosicky.
 
And another very, very good goal.

64 mins Is it because he wants to distinguish Harry from Big Daddy?

 
63 mins Can anyone explain why?
Evan Fanning (@evanfanning) 
Andy Townsend never says 'Kane'. It's always always 'Harry Kane'

<https://twitter.com/evanfanning/status/525381590265110528>  
61 mins A foul on Townsend wide on the right leads to a Spurs free-kick. He 
who was fouled takes it but it is a foul effort and Asteras get rid of the ball 
from their area easily enough.

 
58 mins Dembélé gets across Rolle and shoulders him to the ground. Asteras 
drift down the right from the resulting free-kick and then switch play to the 
left. Just inside the box, Tsokanis puts a dangerous ball across the face of 
the goal that Vertonghen is forced to hoof to safety. The Greeks are coming 
right back into it.

 
56 mins Asteras get a corner after some decent covering from Vertonghen. A bit 
of defensive panic kicks in before Kane kicks in and kicks the ball out for 
another one. That is sent to the edge of the box but when Asteras try to put it 
back in, order has been restored in the Spurs back-line and three players are 
caught offside.

 
54 mins “As a Peruvian Spurs fan, you can imagine that I’ve experienced my 
fair share of suffering” pains José Bolivar. “I must say that a very famous 
(and somewhat proud national moment) that is rabona related came thanks to 
Andres Vasquez, who played (plays?) in Sweden for IFK Göteborg. He scored this 
beauty then he fell into obscurity and I never heard the name again. Beter than 
Lamela’s, huh?
 
51 mins Sankaré takes down Adebayor and somehow manages to avoid a yellow 
card. The resulting free-kick (about 35 yards out, just left of centre) is 
aimed, by Lamela, to Fazio but the centre-back is beaten to it by Panteliadis.
 
49 mins A lovely knock-back in the box by Adebayor lands at the feet of 
Lamela. He shoots but his effort is blocked and diverted out for Spurs’ first 
corner of the second half. Lamela it is who takes it but the Greek side soon 
rid their box of any danger.

 
47 mins “The best rabona I saw (no video proof, so it never happened, right?) 
was when I was at school and some friends of mine got jobs stocking shelves in 
a local supermarket,” reminisces Scapegoat. “We were playing football in the 
vegetable aisle with a cabbage, and unfortunately the trick shot in question 
hit an old lady who was busy feeling all the apples in a bin. The manager 
thought I’d done the shot in question, grabbed me and said ‘You’re fired’. I 
tried to look contrite, said ‘OK’ and left, but as I wasn’t actually an 
employee, the others kept their jobs … until the manager later caught them 
shoplifting a bunch of whiskey.”
 
46 mins No changes to tell you about just yet.

 
45 mins And we are back. “On the Rabona Wikipedia page,” says Chris Mapleston, 
“the ‘Players who have completed the skill in competition’ section has already 
been updated with Lamela’s details.” Deary me. Who are these people doing this 
so quickly?

 
That’s your lot for now. One very good goal and one outrageous goal separate 
the sides. Take these 15 minutes to send in your best rabona examples.

43 mins “What’s a rabona?” asks Lionel Faull. Anyone want to enlighten?

 
41 mins Asteras get one corner. And another. Lloris claims the second one with 
ease.

 
40 mins Townsend gets the ball about 30 yards out. He takes one touch, pushes 
the ball forward and then swings one towards the top right corner. Kosicky 
spreads his body but the ball misses its intended target by a whisker.

 
38 mins That rabona though. It was struck so cleanly. 

 
37 mins Panteliadis chops down Townsend as a lumberjack would a tree. Unlike a 
lumberjack though, the defender gets a yellow card beside his name.

 
35 mins Meanwhile in Scotland:
Ewan Murray (@mrewanmurray) 
Celtic making Astra look good here. Slack, sloppy, poor stuff.

<https://twitter.com/mrewanmurray/status/525370653978148865>  
34 mins By the way, just moments before Lamela did his thing, Parra missed 
Asteras’ second golden opportunity of the game. In fairness to the striker, 
Lloris saved well at the near post and the rebound was blocked brilliantly by 
Davies but he still should have done better.

 
This. Is. Unreal. Lamela has just rabona-ed one into the goal from the D. 
Let’s just repeat that. Lamela has just rabona-ed one into the goal from the D. 
One more time? Lamela has just rabona-ed one into the goal from the D. And 
another? Lamela has just rabona-ed one into the goal from the D. Pochettino 
didn’t even smile.

26 mins A free-kick to the Greek side is looped to the back post by 
Panteliadis. It finds Rick Rubin  Zisopoulos but his equally looping header 
loops its way over the bar. Speaking of loops, do they still make 
Loop-de-loops? They were great.

 
23 mins Capoue picks the ball up near the centre circle. He strides forward 
and plays the ball to Adebayor. The striker lays it back to Kane as Capoue 
continues his run. Kane finds that run but brave keeping from Kosicky keeps 
Spurs’ goal count at one.

 
21 mins Just saw a replay of that Tsokanis chance. It looked like he heard the 
keeper coming and pulled out of the chance. He’ll need to be a bit braver next 
time, he said, typing from the comfort of his office without having a big, 
hairy keeper bearing down on him at speed.

 
19 mins Spurs counter via Townsend on the right. He cuts inside and passes to 
Lamela. The ball goes back and then to the right to Davies. Adebayor then tires 
to muscle his way into the box but the Greeks repel him. Meanwhile, down the 
other end, Spurs are caught out by another long ball over the top and Tsokanis 
is this close to beating Lloris to the ball. The keeper was forced to clear the 
danger on the edge of his box with his head.

 
17 mins If you saw Kane’s goal against Besiktas, this one was very similar 
only from the other side.

 
Tottenham had spent the last few minutes playing a bit of keep ball in the 
Asteras half. Asteras had 10 players behind the ball but no one got out to Kane 
quick enough. He was serviced the ball by Dembélé a good 25 yards out on the 
right. He looked up, shifted the ball forward and struck it low and hard and 
into the far corner of the net. It as a wonderful, wonderful strike from an 
increasingly impressive player.

 
Call the doctor because this goal is sick.

Rose/Getty  
10 mins Davies concedes a free-kick for a foul on Mazza then Capoue does one 
on Parra. It’s all a bit scrappy at the moment, with no team really finding 
their feet and/or rhythm.

 
8 mins That was a dead good opportunity for Mazza. Asteras may come to regret 
that later on.

 
7 mins Spurs get a free-kick, bear the corner flag on the left, after an 
unfriendly shoulder barge by Lluy on Davies. Davies sends it over but Asteras 
deal with it. Moments later, a long ball over the top is misjudged by Dembélé 
and allows Mazza in on goal. He has time and space but at the edge of the area, 
he loses his cool and rolls a shot wide.

 
4 mins Lamela picks the ball up in the middle. He cuts inside and beats one 
player. He tries to set up Kane but his pass is behind the young forward.

 
3 mins Contrary to the team sheet, Townsend has started on the right and 
Lamela has started on the left.

 
2 mins Spurs get an early throw on their left. It lands at the foot of 
Dembélé. He tried to Hollywood it across the pitch and in doing so he hacks it 
right out of play. Asteras get their throw and their first taste of the ball. 
They pass it around, exhibiting few early nerves.

 
1 mins The referee gives his whistle a short blast and it is off we go. Spurs 
are playing in their usual white number and doing so in a right to left 
fashion. Asteras are decked in a kit that has a solid strip of yellow 
surrounded by a sea of navy. The home side are the one who get us going.

 
The lads in the studio have some bantz and the players are making their way 
out on to the pitch.Won’t be long now. Excited? No, didn’t think so.

 
Hope for Spurs:
OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) 
0 - Asteras Tripolis have never won an away match in Europe (lost three, drawn 
four, including qualifying matches). Sickness.

It’s all over in Lille 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2014/oct/23/lille-v-everton-europa-league-live>
. It was a deary enough affair – like watching brown paint dry – but Everton 
will be happy as they leave the stadium with a point in their pocket, a point 
that sends them back to the top of their group.

 
So when you read that March 24 was the day that both Ivan Kruzliak and Chris 
Bosh were born on, the same day that Hickland and Hasselhoff became one and the 
same day that The Breakfast Club is set, you thought that day could not get any 
better, right?How wrong you were. Let Simon McMahon explain why. “Things that 
happen on March 24? It’s National Tree Planting Day in Uganda, you know,” he 
cheers.

 
Tonight, you shall be watching this mötley crüe do their respective things. 
Tottenham, it would seem, are taking the game pretty seriously by returning 
Adebayor and Townsend to their starting lineup. Joining them is Vertonghen, 
about whom speculation regarding his future just won’t go away, and Kane – who, 
along with Lloris, has been one of Spurs better players in this competition 
this season. Chadli who had been suffering with an unspecified injury makes the 
bench but Danny Rose and Kyle Naughton are not so lucky. As for Asteras, the 
curse of the preamble has struck for Barrales and he too will be watching from 
the comfort of the bench. Those teams in full then are as follows:


Tottenham: Lloris; Dier, Vertonghen, Fazio, Davies; Dembélé, Capoue; Lamela, 
Kane Townsend; Adebayor.Subs: Vorm, Chiriches, Lennon, Chadli, Eriksen, 
Stambouli, Soldado.

Asteras: Kosicky; Lluy, Zisopoulos, Sankaré, Panteliadis; Mazza, Usero, 
Munafo, Rolle, Tsokanis, Parra. Subs: Theodoropoulos, Kiriakopoulos, Fernández, 
Barrales, Bakasetas, Badibanga, Gianniotas.

Referee: Ivan Kruzliak (who is from Slovakia and who was born on the same day 
as Chris Bosh, which is also the same day that Catherine Hickland became the 
envy of all women around the world by marrying David Hasselhoff and also – and 
this isthe best thing you will read tonight – the same day upon which The 
Breakfast Club is set. Seriously. What a day, eh?)

Kick-off: 8:05pm

 
The common consensus is that most players/fans would prefer to declare 
themselves a god <http://t.co/mNDjXIqGOc>, realise that meant sex was only for 
mortals, study monks and vasectomies and then perform one on themselves before 
jumping off a two-story balcony, rather than be associated with the Europa 
League. And somedays it’s hard to argue against that. In an already pretty 
crowded schedule, there are far too many games to reach the top, there are far 
too many teams trying to reach the top and the idea that a Champions League 
team can be rewarded for their failure in that competition by just swanning in 
and taking a place in the round of 32 makes the whole thing stink of farce and 
taste like that cheap and nasty, yellow pack rot-gut they used to sell in 
Quinnsworth.

And yet, glory is glory is glory is glory is glory is glory. Should Tottenham 
progress past the group stages, navigate the round of 32, do one over another 
in the round of 16, get a decent draw in the quarters, go hard in the semis and 
reach the final, you’d have to be one hella stubborn Spurs supporter/player not 
to get excited about the thought of winning a European trophy, especially given 
the Champions-League tasting carrot that is attached to it. Given their form 
and placing in the league right now ( Mauricio Pochettino wasn’t wrong when he 
called it “a tough period”) could that route be Tottenham’s best chance of 
traipsing across the biggest stage next seasons? Hmmm, yeah, maybe, but if so, 
they have already made life hard for themselves.
Their first game in the group C saw them enter an intimidating atmosphere in 
Belgrade and leave with a point, after some resolute rear-guard action and 
plenty of profligacy up front.Their second game saw them take on Besiktas, saw 
them played off the park and once more saw them end with a point, after Demba 
Ba converted a penalty one minute from time thanks to bone-headed defending 
from Vlad Chiriches. All of which has left Spurs in third place, two points 
behind the group leaders and tonight’s opposition, Asteras Tripoli.
You probably know (the Greece version of) Tripoli as the birth place of former 
Greek prime minister, Konstantinos Georgakopoulos, and for the fact that it is 
twinned with Peine, Germany, but, of late, Asteras Tripoli have been the reason 
for the southern city’s fame. It has been quite the rise for the Arcadians. 
Eleven years ago, they were playing in the fourth flight of the Greek league 
but it took them just another four to secure the back-to-back titles and take 
their spot in the Super League. Their first few season up top were shaky and 
there was a bit of slap and tickle with relegation but the the last three have 
been steadier and seen them record top six finishes, as well finish as 
runners-up in the Greek Cup.
To get where they are today, they have beaten Mainz, Maccabi Tel Aviv, 
Partizan and drawn away to Besiktas, so any one who thinks Spurs are going to 
have it easy tonight best take their thinking back to the drawing board. While 
there, they might want to think about the fact that the Greeks are unbeaten in 
five games. In his pre-match presser, Staikos Vergetis, indicated that his side 
would rock up at White Hart Lane with defence in mind (and that is what they 
worked on in the a cold north London last night) but this is a side that is 
laced with some silky and strong Argentinians, not least their main goal 
threat, Jerónimo Barrales (who know that he has been mentioned here will surely 
be dropped to the bench). They won’t stay back forever – though their back four 
will be hampered by the loss of Dorin Goian to an ankle injury – and they will 
look to hit and hurt Tottenham on the counter (only Mainz have stopped them 
from scoring in Europe this season).

This is going to be a tough one for Tottenham. News of the 11 men that 
Pochettino thinks can do this is on its its way, as is 90 minutes of football. 
Woop!
