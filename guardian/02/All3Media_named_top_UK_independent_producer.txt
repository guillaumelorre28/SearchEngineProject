Midsomer Murders and Richard and Judy producer All3Media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/all3media> has come top in an annual survey 
of the UK's biggest independent producers, with a turnover of £241.6m.

Founded just five years ago by former ITV executives Steve Morrison, Jules 
Burns and David Liddiment, All3Media has moved ahead of rivals such as IMG 
Media and Endemol to become the sector's highest revenue earner and take the 
so-called "super-indie" crown, according to trade magazine Televisual's annual 
Production 100 survey.

Majority-owned by private equity firm Permira, All3Media has been on an 
acquisition spree since its inception in 2003, buying up companies including 
Shameless producer Company Pictures and Cactus, which makes Richard & Judy.

All3Media's other UK-owned companies include Britain from Above producer Lion 
Television and Bentley Productions, maker of ITV1 ratings banker Midsomer 
Murders.

According to Televisual's survey, the annual turnover of All3Media's UK-owned 
companies is £241.6m, up from £174m last year. This rises to £380.4m if its 
international acquisitions are included.

Last year's winner of Televisual's survey, IMG Media - which owns Robin Hood 
producer Tiger Aspect and The Diary of Anne Frank producer Darlow Smithson - 
came second with a UK turnover of £221.7m.

In third place was Big Brother producer Endemol UK, with revenues of £157m.

The total turnover of UK independent production companies taking part in the 
survey was £1.9bn, up from £1.5bn last year.

However, the poll also revealed that the sector is concerned about the credit 
crunch.

About 41% of those surveyed said their business prospects looked worse for the 
year ahead, with 25% predicting a rosier 2008-09 and 34% saying they expected 
business activity to be around the same.

Just 1% of independent producers said broadcaster budgets had risen over the 
past 12 months.

Another 71% said they had fallen, while 28% said they remained the same.

The Production 100 is published in Televisual's September issue, which will be 
launched at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival on 
Saturday, August 23.
