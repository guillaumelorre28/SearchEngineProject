The Vatican looks likely to call for a boycott of Angels and Demons, the 
prequel to the blockbuster film adaptation of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code.

Official Vatican newspaper Avvenire reported on Friday that it "cannot 
approve" of Ron Howard's film, which is based on the eponymous book by Brown 
and opens worldwide on 15 May. The report prompted suspicions that the church 
is gearing up to call for a new boycott, after urging Catholics not to see the 
first film.

However, officials are said to be torn over whether such a move could 
backfire: La Stampa reports Archbishop Velasio De Paolis warning against a 
possible "boomerang effect" which might result in more people being piqued by 
the publicity into seeing the film.

A strong reaction is expected because the Vatican's campaign against The Da 
Vinci Code in 2006 was spearheaded by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, then 
Archbishop of Genoa but now the Vatican's secretary of state and the pope's 
right-hand man. Bertone called The Da Vinci Code "a potpourri of lies, a 
phantasmagorical cocktail of inventions"; nonetheless, the film was one of the 
year's biggest hits, taking $760m (Â£518m) at the worldwide box office.

reprising his role as Harvard professor of symbology Robert Langdon, this time 
summoned to Rome to investigate a murder victim branded with an emblem 
signalling the presence of the shadowy organisation.

The film's producers were banned from entering the Holy See or any church in 
Rome <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jun/17/news.culture> last summer, 
forcing them to use soundstages to film interior scenes set in the churches of 
Santa Maria del Popolo and Santa Maria della Vittoria.
