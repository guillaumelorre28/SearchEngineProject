The news of the death of the Queen was reported in detail on page five of the 
Manchester Guardian (adverts were on the front page until 1952 
<https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/archive-educational-resource-august-2011>
). Eight columns covered announcements of her death, reports from the paper’s 
special correspondent relating events from Osborne House, the proclamation of 
Edward VII as King, the reconvening of Parliament and reactions in London and 
Manchester.

Illustrations were rarely used in the paper. They tended to be small and were 
to mark special occasions. However for the obituary supplementCP Scott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/collection-in-focus-cp-scott> and his 
editorial staff took the decision to use 30 drawings, many of them large, 
across all 12 pages.

The supplement runs in chronological order starting with Queen Victoria’s 
lineage, parents’ marriage, her birth and early life. The large drawing on the 
first page is of her being declared Queen at the age of 18. On subsequent pages 
accompanying an analysis of her reign are illustrations of her childhood, 
coronation and wedding, family life, prime ministers and portraits.

In 1910 the newspaper produced a similar style supplement using only 
illustrations to mark the death of King Edward VII. It did however use a 
photograph of the new King, George V, in the main section of the paper.
