Your novel The Green Road has just been longlisted for this year’s Man Booker 
prize <https://www.theguardian.com/books/booker-prize> - which you won with The 
Gatheringin 2007. How does it feel?
Well, it’s more fun the second time around! Actually, the first time I was 
really delighted, and sort of vindicated. But when it happened, I was working 
all the time to try and pay the bills, and it took a walloping two months out 
of my working life, I couldn’t write a damn thing, so that was a bit 
frightening.

At the start of the year, you also became the first ever laureate for Irish 
fiction...
The laureateship meant an awful lot more to me than any prize I got, because 
it happened at home. It takes Ireland a while to accept one of its writers, 
because there’s a very dissenting tradition in Irish writing. Writers are never 
telling wonderful stories about Ireland, they’re telling interesting stories 
about Ireland, and Ireland doesn’t necessarily appreciate that. So for me to be 
accepted, for a female voice – with all the anxiety there is about the female 
voice in Ireland – for that somehow to dissolve, and this symbolic thing of the 
laureateship, is just lovely.

What’s that anxiety about?
It’s wrong to accuse Irish men of misogyny, because they’re all so nice. So 
it’s difficult, but I do think the anxiety about the female voice comes very 
early; as in, it’s not actually sexualised anxiety. Irish men are more worried 
about their mothers than their girlfriends – and who wants to listen to their 
mother? It’s sensible, really.

In The Green Road, there’s a magnetic but also rather problematic mother - 
whose four children you follow to New York, Africa and over Ireland. Families 
are key to your work, aren’t they?
People say I write about the family all the time, but in fact I just put 
people into that shape, or use that shape to write about deeper truths. I was 
more interested in separation and connection, disconnection and love.

The story of leaving and returning - or not returning - that informs your 
novel runs through the history of Ireland…
Emigration has been a part of Irish life for hundreds of years, and my way 
into it was not through the nostalgia of the emigrants in London or Boston, 
because there’s quite a difficult relationship between the Irish person at home 
and the emigrant abroad; by the second or third generation, those emigrants 
turn Ireland into a certain kind of idea – which informs our own idea of 
Ireland, but also begins to kitschify it a little and sentimentalise it. All of 
that is difficult and above all else there’s an amount of shame swilling around 
all of that situation. The emigrants who left Ireland left because they were 
poor, and they left because there was nothing for them. The emigrants when I 
was growing up in the 80s, when I was a teenager, left not only because there 
weren’t any jobs, but because the moral atmosphere of the country was 
unbearably claustrophobic, and because in order to be themselves, they had to 
leave, in order to possess their own life. You had that feeling in the 80s that 
your life was elsewhere, that your real life was in New York or London, and not 
in this squabbling country that was always talking about goddamn contraception 
like it was the devil’s work.

You’ve had periods away, but never left entirely, have you?
I love Ireland. It is my home, but you know, I sometimes feel I have been 
trying to leave all my life, and never made it. But I don’t know if writers 
ever are properly in the place where they live, they’re always in a slight 
state of exile.

You grew up in Dublin, but The Green Road is centred in county Clare, on the 
west coast. Why was that?
I decided on the west coast of Ireland because it is so much about nostalgia 
and return, but I didn’t do a big sort of tweed-cap, paddywhackery job on that 
at all. It’s written in a town tradition, they’re small-town people.

Irish society has changed enormously, of course, and some of it very recently, 
hasn’t it?
Yes, rather triumphantly, the change was symbolised by a referendum for gay 
marriage, where people were so fed up of all this tired, fake morality of the 
Catholic church that they just said let people live their lives.

How profound a shift do you think it was?
All through my teenage life and beyond there was a disjunction between what 
was really happening in people’s lives and how it was reflected in the 
institutions and the laws of the country. So the change happened first, and 
then the laws changed afterwards. So yes, it is symbolic, but it is symbolic of 
the reality of how people are already living. It’s a confirmation; it’s been 
celebrated, not made.

Ireland has also been through a completely different seismic change - that of 
the financial crisis, which you wrote about inThe Forgotten Waltz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/01/forgotten-waltz-anne-enright-review>
. What does the situation feel like now?
We lost a generation. The pain of austerity was astonishingly real, it is 
still being reflected in people’s bank accounts, people’s negative equity. The 
effect on the children of a generation of people whose bricks and mortar, such 
a treasured thing, became a source of astonishing stress, they became unreal to 
them, and the money became super-real.

Ireland has been held up, by some, as the country that did austerity 
successfully. That’s probably quite infuriating…
After all that stress to now sit up and wag our tails and say, “Aren’t we 
good? Pat us on the head”? I’m not that grateful.

You just don’t accept that “taking your medicine” version of events?
I resist that narrative. The bust was to an extent the ordinary mortgage 
holder, but overwhelmingly it was 20 or 30 billionaire property developers who 
put the hole in the Irish bank debt, and then the government took it on as a 
national debt. So this idea that Ireland had a huge party and then suffered a 
hangover and now we’re coming into a kind of judicious, adult sobriety, that 
annoys me entirely.
