Still standing tall in second place was San Andreas, the disaster movie about 
a massive Californian earthquake, starring Dwayne Johnson. It’s totalled $99.1 
million in the states so far and a ground-rumbling $287.1 million worldwide. 
Pitch Perfect 2 andMad Max: Fury Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mad-max-fury-road> also stayed strong, 
breaking $250m and $300m respectively.

Third place went to new entry Insidious: Chapter 3. The latest in the 
cheap-as-chips horror franchise, known for huge returns from a low budget, has 
already made back its rumoured $10m costs. It opened in 3,002 cinemas, taking 
$23m. Spy star Rose Byrne, who appeared in Insidious and Insidious: Chapter 2, 
elected not to appear in this prequel.

Sinking to the bottom of the chart was Aloha, Cameron Crowe’s critically 
trashed romantic comedy about a defence contractor (Bradley Cooper) falling for 
a pilot (Emma Stone) while working in Hawaii 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/29/aloha-cameron-crowe-trashed-critics-release-hawaii-bradley-cooper>
. The film, which has attracted controversy for casting Stone as Alison Ng, a 
quarter Chinese, quarter Hawaiian, half-Swedish woman, dropped 66% in its 
second week.
