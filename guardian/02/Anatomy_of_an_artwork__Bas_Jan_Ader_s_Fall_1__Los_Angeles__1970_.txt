Witnesses to terrible accidents will sometimes describe seeing them in “slow 
motion”. Viewers of Bas Jan Ader’s 24-second 16mm film actually do. Present, 
too, is the same sense of dawning horror, as we see the artist on a chair 
straddling the roof of a suburban home, then falling off it.

Ader’s work rebuffed the idea that art was there to communicate. Here we see 
Ader’s fall represented on film, yet we can never understand how it actually 
felt.

Ader knew he was entering the slapstick world of Keaton or Chaplin here; like 
those comics, the abiding feeling raised by his film is melancholy.

Shown alongside four other “falling” films, it’s hard not to view these as 
premonitions of Ader’s tragic death: in 1975 he disappeared while sailing 
across the Atlantic.
