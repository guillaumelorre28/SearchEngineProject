This morning’s Chicago Tribune reports that congressional leaders have been 
told by CIA officials that French dissidents approached theCIA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cia> 10 years ago to ask for American help 
in a conspiracy to kill the French President.

The killer was to be an “old soldier.” He was to wear a poisoned ring on one 
of his fingers. And he was to shake theGeneral 
<http://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-de-Gaulle-president-of-France>’s 
hand in what the Tribune said today would have been “a clasp...of lethal 
friendship.”


According to the newspaper in an exclusive copyrighted story that indicates no 
sources or dateline, a CIA officer travelled to Capitol Hill within the past 
fortnight to brief Senators and Congressmen on the kind of stories they can 
expect to unearth when they read the Rockefeller Commission’s censored (by 
President Ford) section on political assassinations; and what to expect when 
the two congressional select committees begin to investigate the subject.


In the secret briefing, the CIA man reportedly told the Congressmen that 
French dissidents – the Algerian connection was not mentioned, but the plot was 
allegedly hatched after the failure of the 1961 and 1962OAS 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_de_l'arm%C3%A9e_secr%C3%A8te> 
attempts on the General’s life – had made contact with the CIA in 1965 and 1966.


At the time, the Johnson administration was less than happy with de Gaulle, 
who was by then an ardent opponent of the Vietnam war, and had thrown US 
servicemen out of French military bases.


The plan, as reportedly put to the CIA, involved infiltrating an agent, 
wearing the poisoned ring – perhaps with acurare 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curare>-tipped needle on its outer surface – 
into a group of old soldiers attending a reception at which the General would 
appear.


The agent would wait in line to have his hand shaken, deliberately lagging so 
that the General would be tired and his hand would be numb from shaking the 
hands of so many more enthusiastic soldiers.


Finally, that “clasp...of lethal friendship,” and the General would fall to 
the ground while the assassin strolled calmly off into the throng.


The tribune’s sources could not say if the CIA had ever done more than 
entertain the plan; no evidence exists, the paper says, to show that Mr Johnson 
knew anything of this; and no one will say if the ring wearing old soldier ever 
existed.


Only one thing is certain: de Gaulle is dead. He collapsed watching television 
at his home in Colombey-les-deux-Eglises.
