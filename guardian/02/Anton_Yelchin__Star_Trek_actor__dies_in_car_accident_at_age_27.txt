Anton Yelchin <https://www.theguardian.com/film/anton-yelchin>, a charismatic 
rising star best known for playing Chekov in the rebooted Star Trek films, has 
died at the age of 27. He was killed in a car accident early on Sunday morning, 
his publicist, Jennifer Allen, confirmed.

Yelchin’s friends alerted police when he failed to turn up to a rehearsal 
scheduled to start on Saturday evening. They then discovered the actor in his 
driveway at around 1am. No other vehicles are thought to have been involved and 
the cause of death is being reported as accidental. Jenny Houser, a spokeswoman 
for the LAPD, told the Hollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anton-yelchin-star-trek-actor-904280?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News_now_2016-06-19%2012:42:05_awashington&utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews>
: “It appears he momentarily exited his car and it rolled backward, causing 
trauma that led to his death.”

Yelchin was an actor whose stock-in-trade was sweetness and even naiveté: his 
career began young, in small films and TV series, before he broke out in 2006 
with crime thrillerAlpha Dog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/apr/20/brucewillis.thriller> and the 
following year as Robert Downey Jr’s troubled pupil inCharlie Bartlett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/16/comedy>. In 2011, he starred 
opposite Felicity Jones inLike Crazy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/like-crazy>, a transatlantic romance that won 
both audience and jury awards at the Sundance film festival, as well as playing 
Mel Gibson’s son in Jodie Foster’sThe Beaver 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-beaver>.

But it was as mathematical brainbox Pavel Chekov in the new set of Star Trek 
films that Yelchin first came to mainstream attention. In JJ Abrams’ critically 
and commercially successful 2009Star Trek 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/star-trek>, and the 2013 follow-up, the actor 
won acclaim for an innocence and humour that characterised many of his roles. A 
third film, Star Trek: Beyond, is due out in July.

theStar Trek <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/star-trek> family, he was 
beloved by so many and he will missed by all. We share our deepest condolences 
with his mother, father and family.”

His Star Trek co-star, John Cho, tweeted that he was “in ruins” at the news of 
Yelchin’s death.

I loved Anton Yelchin so much. He was a true artist - curious, beautiful, 
courageous. He was a great pal and a great son. I'm in ruins.

Despite his age, Yelchin had managed to carve out a career that balanced 
blockbusters with credible independent movies.Speaking to the Guardian in 2009 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/02/anton-yelchin-terminator-salvation>
 to promote the sci-fi movie Terminator Salvation, Yelchin said: “What I watch 
and what I work on are different.”

His own taste veered more towards the films of directors such as Michael 
Haneke, Lars von Trier and Pedro Almodóvar, as well as Martin Scorsese and Jim 
Jarmusch, in whose 2013 vampire romance Only Lovers Left Alive Yelchin went on 
to take a role.

The star of that film, Tom Hiddleston, said he was “absolutely devastated” to 
hear the news of the death of “such a gifted, natural actor [and] a deeply kind 
man”.
