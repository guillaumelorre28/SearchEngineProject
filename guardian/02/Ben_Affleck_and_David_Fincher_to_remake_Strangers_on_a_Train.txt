The team behind Gone Girl <https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl> are 
hoping to capitalise on the film’s success by making another thriller.

Deadline Hollywood reports

 that actor Ben Affleck, director David Fincher and Gone Girl author and 
screenwriter Gillian Flynn are set to create a new version of Alfred 
Hitchcock’s 1951 film, Strangers on a Train.

Based on a 1950 novel by Patricia Highsmith, the original film 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044079/> is predicated on a conversation between 
two men in which they discuss “swapping” murders – agreeing to kill someone 
disliked by the other in order to hide the motive.

The new version, retitled Strangers, will feature Affleck as a film star who 
is offered a lift by a wealthy businessman after his private jet breaks down in 
the middle of an Oscar campaign.

Affleck will also produce the film. The studio, Warner Brothers, will be 
anxious to replicate the success ofGone Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl>, which grossed $350m worldwide, 
almost six times the film’s $60m budget.

Strangers is set to be shot at the end of this year after Affleck has starred 
in and directed his adaptation of the Dennis Lehane bookLive By Night
