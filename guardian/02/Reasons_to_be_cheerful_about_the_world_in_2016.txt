By common consent 2016 has been a challenging year, a year of disasters, what 
with Brexit, the election of Donald Trump as US president and a litany of 
celebrities who have sadly passed away. It is therefore often difficult to 
remember that parallel to this we are living through something of an arc of 
progress. The world is getting richer, with the number of people living in 
extreme poverty falling below 10% for the first time. Indeed, since 1990 almost 
1.1 billion have escaped extreme poverty. World hunger also reached its lowest 
point for 25 years in 2016.

For the first time ever the death penalty has become illegal in more than half 
of the world’s countries and the world got healthier, with a World Health 
Organisation report showing that since 2000 global malaria deaths have declined 
by 60%. Since their peak a decade ago Aids-related deaths have fallen by 45% 
and infant mortality has halved since 1990.Taiwan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/taiwan> is on the verge of becoming the 
first Asian country to legalise same-sex marriage and Tanzania banned child 
marriage.

For many 2016 may have been seen as the worst of times, but let us not forget 
it has been on the best of times too, so let’s not be too pessimistic as we 
enter 2017.

• As we near the end of this dreadful year and face the new one with its 
likely consequences of past decisions, at least we have the Guardian to look 
forward to as a means of trying to retain our sanity. From your considered 
reporting and analysis of events home and abroad to the wicked humour of your 
cartoonists and columnists, there will be much consolation to look forward to. 
And this includes your crossword compilers;Paul’s 22 down, 16 today

tone. Thank you all.

• It’s interesting that, in what appears to be a hierarchy of notable deaths 
in your centre spread (29 December), David Bowie is at the top and the poet Sir 
Geoffrey Hill at the bottom. Arguably both utilised a “recondite vocabulary 
enjoyable for its very strangeness”.  “… All echoes are the same in such 
eternity…” (Funeral Music, 1994, Geoffrey Hill).
