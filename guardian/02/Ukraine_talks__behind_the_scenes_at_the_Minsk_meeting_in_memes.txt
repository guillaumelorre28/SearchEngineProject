Last night the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France, and Germany held an epic 
negotiating session in the Belarusian capital of Minsk in the hopes ofreaching 
political settlement on the future of eastern Ukraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/ukraine-ceasefire-aims-pave-way-comprehensive-settlement-crisis>
.

Vladimir Putin, François Hollande 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-hollande>, Petro Poroshenko and 
Angela Merkel were up all night thrashing out a deal, but unfortunately for the 
restless journalists on the scene, and those following it online, the 
discussion was held behind closed doors.

Of course that did not stop the internet from having some fun with the small 
snapshots that did emerge. Here are RFE/RL’s pick of the best viral moments:

Was hosting president Alexander Lukashenko

passive-aggressive game of musical chairs with Putin, his powerful Russian 
neighbour?

Unfortunately, no. The looped video that went viral was actually set in 
reverse (see Merkel’s backwards step). The original video shows a much more 
innocent – if still a little awkward – gesture by Lukashenko.

Recently Lukashenko has taken a defiant tone against Putin’s politics

. But the next meme suggests that he should, as the “last dictator in Europe,”

 consider teaming up with his Russian neighbour against the other 
western-facing world leaders.

Another photo highlighted the difficultly Lukashenko faced as host, as his 
powerful guests sit waiting for someone to break the ice.

Once the leaders did get talking there was little comment from inside. At one 
point Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters negotiations were 
going “better than super”. Is that what caused Putin’s pencil to snap?

Some journalists, it seemed, were as tense as the politicians. Aleksandr 
Yunashev, a reporter fromLifeNews <http://lifenews.ru/>, an online outlet with 
ties to Russia’s security services, was filmed “barking” at a Ukrainian 
correspondent.

His boss, Anatoly Suleymanov, then tweeted in support and said that he would 
have “pissed” on the Ukrainian journalist.

As the night wore on, the journalists on the scene were left with little to do 
but wait, share online memes – and apparently save a cat.

According to the Moscow-based Russian News Service, bored journalists spent 
the night feeding a stray feline. The cat attempted an escape up a tree but 
then realised he couldn’t get down. Reporters then somehow used a combination 
of ladders, tripods, and microphones to “rescue” her.

Before trying to catch up on some sleep.
