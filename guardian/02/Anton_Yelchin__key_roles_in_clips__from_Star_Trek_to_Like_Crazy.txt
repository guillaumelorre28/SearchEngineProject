Anton Yelchin <https://www.theguardian.com/film/anton-yelchin>, one of

industry, switching between studio films and indies, always stretching his 
scope and impressing with his talent. Here are some of his key roles.

At the age of just 11, Yelchin proved that he could comfortably hold the 
screen opposite Anthony Hopkins in Scott Hicks’ adaptation of Stephen King’s 
fantastical drama. He avoided the precocious child stereotype and hinted at 
great things to come.

While Ben Foster might have nabbed the showier role, Yelchin was the tragic 
heart of this fact-based tragedy about the kidnap and murder of a teenage boy. 
He added depth to the role of a child growing up fast amid an escalating set of 
terrible circumstances.

As the lead in this indie comedy drama, he was finally gifted the limelight 
and he took to it with ease, acting alongside Robert Downey Jr and undoubtedly 
coming out on top. He also showed that he could ground any situation, no matter 
how farcical, and make us easily identify with whichever character he was 
playing.

His progression to blockbusters was well-orchestrated with a funny role as 
Chekov in JJ Abrams’ thrilling reboot of the dusty sci-fi saga. He added his, 
by now, trademark light touch and delivered one of the most memorable turns in 
a large ensemble.

In 2011, he graduated to more adult roles and this painful drama about a 
prolonged long distance relationship gave him his finest performance to date. 
He was one half of the tortured couple, along with Felicity Jones, and he made 
his character’s heartbreak feel believably raw.

Underseen, and unfairly cast off as yet another remake, this witty and scary 
redo of the 80s comedy horror, expertly walked the tightrope between the two 
genres. Yelchin played the geeky kid who suddenly becomes part of the cool 
crowd who has to contend with his vampiric neighbour, and he showcased a 
natural comic touch yet again.

He continued to spend most of his time working in independent cinema and acted 
forJim Jarmusch <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jim-jarmusch> in this elegant 
tale of vampires in decaying Detroit. He had a small role but he held his own 
against Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston and was a believably grungy rocker.

His most recent, and arguably most accomplished, role was the lead in this 
gruesomely entertaining horror film. Yelchin plays a band member facing off 
against neo-Nazis and he showed himself to be a charming lead, maturing into a 
man after breaking out as a young boy 15 years prior.
