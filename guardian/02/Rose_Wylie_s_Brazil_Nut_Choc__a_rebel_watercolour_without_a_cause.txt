Bittersweet 

Rose Wylie’s little chocolate brazil nut is round, shiny and appealing. 
However, it’s also a provocation, a rebel watercolour likely to rile any 
traditionalist critics who might condemn her work as worthy of a four-year-old 
– as Brian Sewell once did.

Life drawing

The everyday subject matter is unapologetic, the rough and ready look 
self-conscious. The octogenarian painter from rural Kent was little known until 
Sienna Miller and then Germaine Greer championed her a decade ago. She depicts 
whatever strikes her – supermodels, arthouse cinema, things off the telly. 
Confectionery is a favourite.

Slow food

The paintings have lightning immediacy and are big on character. As a film 
portrait of Wylie by the artist Ben Rivers revealed, however, they are far from 
quick: formal qualities are carefully debated, colours laboriously built up. 
Her paintings speak of the particular way we each experience the world and the 
challenge of communicating.

Plain and simple

Inspired by a bag of unadorned confectionery purchased in Margate by the 
artist’s daughter, this brazil encased in plain chocolate is rich with 
ordinary, familiar appeal.
