Benjamin Franklin once said: "You may delay, but time will not." This applies 
to job hunting. It could be your mobile phone, too many tea breaks, or social 
media that takes away your most valuable resource - time.

"Organised" tends to be a word that crops up in every job criteria, yet when 
job searching it's a skill that can prove challenging. When you feel like 
you're not getting anywhere, it is often easier to do anything else, apart from 
hunt for work.

We asked our Twitter followers how they struggle with time management and here 
are our favourites, along with some insightful advice on how to job hunt more 
efficiently.

The balancing act
Elizabeth Peddie (@lizpeddie) 
@GuardianCareers <https://twitter.com/GuardianCareers> I struggle with

I'm not getting anywhere. Thx

Hayley Stovold, head of content for CV app and career site Jobulo 
<http://www.jobulo.com/>: "This is a common problem for many people looking to 
change careers. If you are job searching there must be a reason for that, 
whether it's because you are unhappy in your current role, or you are looking 
for an increase in salary, so always keep this in mind to ensure you stay 
motivated during your job search."

Clare Evans, time management coach <http://www.clareevans.co.uk/> and author of
Time Management For Dummies 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-Management-Dummies-UK-Edition/dp/0470777656>: 
"Set clear goals and objectives for what you want to achieve in life – whether 
it's your career or life plans. If you want to change career or improve your 
job prospects, create an action plan and do something every day to move you 
forward – update your CV and learn new skills."

Struggling to get the ball rolling
Young Sandwich (@LangdonOlger) 
@GuardianCareers <https://twitter.com/GuardianCareers> I find I have an 
amazing plan, all well laid out, but when I sit at the computer it can take me 
hours to get going. Help?!

Clare Evans: "Work in short bursts so that you don't get mentally or 
physically distracted. Give yourself mini-targets for what you're going to 
achieve in the next hour and then take a break. When you have a lot to do or 
you're feeling overwhelmed, you need to prioritise. Do important tasks before 
they become urgent and avoid time-wasting tasks. Get support, if you don't have 
the skills to do a particular task, ask someone else or delegate to someone who 
does."

Chris Delaney is a career coach <http://christopher-delaney.com/>: "Make a 
list of what makes putting job searching off painful for you, then make a list 
of the benefits of job searching straight away. This will get you motivated by 
focusing your brain on the pain and benefits of job searching right now."

Hayley Stovold: "Mood boards can really help you to maintain focus and 
motivation. Consider putting pictures of your goals around the house to keep 
you on track during your job search. Whether you're moving jobs to buy your 
dream car, or moving jobs to start your dream career, put reminders of this on 
notice boards and post-it notes to keep you focused and motivated."

Lacking confidence
Sam Whyte (@SamWhyte) 
@GuardianCareers <https://twitter.com/GuardianCareers> Up early to tweak 
applications and search for new opportunities. Leaves afternoons free for 
crying.

Dawn Rosenberg McKay, career planning expert at About.com 
<http://www.about.com/>: "If you are job hunting you should treat it like a 
full-time job. That means you need to spend more than an afternoon tending to 
it. You need to spend the entire work day on it. With that in mind, you should 
take breaks throughout the day."

Chris Delaney: "If job hunting isn't filling up your time you can fall into 
the trap of over thinking. Your self-critique will start playing tricks with 
your head asking: 'Why haven't you got a job yet?' or 'No one would employ 
you!' Not only is this devil in your head demoralising, it can lead to you 
crying all afternoon once your initial job searching activities have been 
completed.

"When working towards a career goal you need a career plan with several 
milestones. Milestones are used so you can see that you are moving forward and 
getting closer to the big goal."
