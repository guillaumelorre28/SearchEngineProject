commercial and local authority premises at the centre of serious and persistent 
disorder or nuisance.

Background

Grounded in the recommendations of two government reports, Simple, Speedy, 
Summary Justice 
<http://74.125.77.132/search?q=cache:ArZD-9K9R50J:www.dca.gov.uk/publications/reports_reviews/delivery-simple-speedy.pdf+simple+speedy+summary+justice&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=uk>
 andRebalancing the criminal justice system in favour of the law-abiding 
majority 
<http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/criminaljusticesystem19.htm>, the 
ministry of justice's bill was intended to put "law-abiding people and 
communities first", to cut crime and reduce re-offending and to protect the 
public. The government aimed to produce a simpler, faster criminal justice 
system.

In addition to creating violent offender orders to provide the "courts with 
tough new powers to manage dangerous violent offenders", the act contains a 
number of changes to sentencing guidelines and court procedures.

The government suffered a key defeat in their attempt to prohibit magistrates 
from imposing suspended sentences for minor offences. Faced with a prolonged 
period of parliamentary ping-pong, the government chose to drop this clause and 
to make a number of other key concessions in order to get a vital clause onto 
the statute books. The act reinstates a statutory ban on strike action by 
prison officers and the government faced industrial action if the bill was not 
passed by 9 May 2008, when their agreement with the Prison Officers Association 
expired.

The Lords did bow to the government on a Liberal Democrat amendment that would 
have made it an offence for public or private sector workers to "intentionally 
or recklessly'' or "repeatedly and negligently'' disclose personal data. This 
followed a number of high-profile data breaches, including HM Revenue and 
Customs admitting it hadlost computer discs 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/nov/21/immigrationpolicy.economy3> 
containing the personal records of 25 million child benefit claimants. Instead, 
peers agreed to a government amendment that allows for data controllers to be 
forced to pay a fine for the mismanagement of personal data.

The act also alters the Data Protection Act 1998 to make unlawfully obtaining 
or procuring personal data an offence punishable by up to two years in prison. 
This change was sought by the information commissioner, Richard Thomas, who 
wanted to close down "a widespread andorganised undercover market 
<http://www.dentonwildesapte.com/en/Publication/undercovermarketintradingpersonalinformationnewcallsfort.aspx>
 in confidential personal information".

The government's decision to outlaw extreme pornography was a response to a 
three-year campaign 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/sep/02/comment.ukcrime> by the 
mother of schoolteacher Jane Longhurst, who wasmurdered 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/6265376.stm> by a man with an 
addiction to hardcore internet pornography. The new laws shift criminal 
responsibility from distributors of extreme pornography to consumers, a change 
the government claims is necessary to deal with the volume of violent 
pornography available on websites based abroad.

Criticism

Justice expressed concern about the government's crackdown on hardcore 
pornography, suggesting the legislation definition wasover-inclusive 
<http://www.justice.org.uk/images/pdfs/CJIBlords2Rbriefing21jan08.pdf>: "While 
legitimately covering much that is already illegal, it could also include much 
that is arguably innocuous". Justice found grounds to suggest the legislation 
may constitute a disproportionate interference with theright to free expression 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/14/human-rights-act>
 under article 10 of the European convention on human rights

The Consenting Adults Action Network <http://www.caan.org.uk/campaigns> argued 
the government was interfering with people's sex lives. The group argues that 
consenting adults have the right to make their own sexual choices "unhindered 
and unfettered by government". Campaigners fromBacklash 
<http://www.backlash-uk.org.uk/>, a libertarian and anti-censorship pressure 
group, warned the act would criminalise thousands of people who use violent 
pornographic images as part of consensual sexual relationships.
