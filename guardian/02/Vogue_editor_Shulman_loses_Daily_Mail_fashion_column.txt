The Daily Mail <https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailymail> has dropped Vogue 
editor Alexandra Shulman's weekly fashion column after budget cuts.

Shulman's hiring from the Daily Telegraph in 2006 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/oct/27/dailymail.pressandpublishing> 
was regarded as a great coup by the Daily Mail and the paper promoted her as 
its voice of fashion on Saturdays.

The paper will now rely on Liz Jones, who also writes a fashion column in the 
Monday Life & Style section.

"They rang me last week and said they were looking at their budget and that 
they wanted to stop the column," Shulman told MediaGuardian.co.uk

"They were very nice about it and I have to say that I think everyone's 
looking at their contributors with what they can do with their budgets and I 
don't bear them any ill will," she said.

"As an editor myself I can hardly be critical of people who drop a column. 
Fleet Street fashion coverage in general is very good. There's masses of it and 
I think it sells papers. I think everybody likes looking at the images you get 
with fashion coverage. I'm sad to lose it but I completely understand as a 
columnist you have to know that this doesn't last for ever."

Shulman – appointed editor of Vogue in 1992 – is one of Britain's most quoted 
authorities on fashion trends.

She started her career in journalism at Tatler in 1982 and spent a year at the 
Sunday Telegraph in 1987. In the 1990s she became editor of GQ and wrote a 
weekly style notebook for the Daily Telegraph from 1996.
