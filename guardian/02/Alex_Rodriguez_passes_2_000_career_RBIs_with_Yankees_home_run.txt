Alex Rodriguez <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alex-rodriguez> has joined 
Hank Aaron to become one of only two players in major league history with 2,000 
career RBIs.


Rodriguez hit a two-run homer Saturday night for the New York Yankees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/new-york-yankees> in a game against the 
Baltimore Orioles. The sixth-inning drive off Bud Norris lifted A-Rod’s career 
RBI total to 2,001. Aaron ranks first on the career list with 2,297 RBIs.

Records get tricky when it comes to runs batted in, partly because RBIs did 
not become an official stat until 1920. So while baseball-reference.com lists 
Babe Ruth with 2,214 and Cap Anson with 2,075, the Elias Sports Bureau – 
baseball’s official statistician – puts Rodriguez ahead of both of them.

It was the 666th career home run for Rodriguez, fourth on baseball’s all-time 
list behind Ruth, Aaron and Barry Bonds.
