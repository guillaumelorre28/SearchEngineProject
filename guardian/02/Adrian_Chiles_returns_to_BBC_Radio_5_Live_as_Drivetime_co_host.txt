Adrian Chiles <https://www.theguardian.com/media/adrian-chiles> is to return 
to the BBC for the first time since quitting The One Show, signing up as a 
co-host of BBC Radio 5 Live.

He jumped ship from BBC1's The One Show in a big-money move to ITV three years 
ago, will co-host the Friday edition of Radio 5 Live's Drivetime show.

Chiles, who was one of the launch presenters on 5 Live, said: "It was a 
privilege to have been there right at the beginning when it launched, and I'm 
thrilled to have been asked back."

He added: "It'll be great to tackle news, current affairs and business stuff, 
as well as sport. All the time I've been away from 5 live I've remained an avid 
fan and it'll be good to be part of it again."

Chiles left the corporation in 2010, unhappy after he was replaced by Chris 
Evans <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/19/adrian-chiles-quits-bbc-itv> 
on the Friday edition of BBC1's The One Show.

He was joined at ITV by his One Show co-presenter Christine Bleakley but they 
failed to work their magic on ITV's Daybreak and have since gone their separate 
ways.

Chiles continues to be a regular face on ITV fronting their UEFA Champions 
League coverage, and also hosted a Sunday night talkshow on the channel.

He will replace Peter Allen in the Friday drivetime slot, co-hosting it with 
Anna Foster, with Allen continuing at the station between Monday and Thursday.
