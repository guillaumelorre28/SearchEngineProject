Maternal deaths are captured by a country's maternal mortality ratio (MMR). 
MMR reports the number of women who die from causes related to or aggravated by 
pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 births. In 2005, the UN reported that Nepal's
MMR <https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr> was 830. It reported that the 
UK's was eight.

Nepal has committed to reducing its MMR by three-quarters to meet MDG5. 
However, according to the WHO, a key challenge for many countries is collecting 
data that accurately represents the number of women who are dying.

The UN census figures for Nepal report a reduction in MMR from 1,500 to 830 
between 1990 and 2005. The Nepalese government uses data from the National 
Demographic Health survey, which reports a drop from 539 to 281 over the same 
period.

"These inconsistencies are important because accurate data is crucial for 
planning effective policies," says Ian McFarlane from UNFPA. "But the geography 
of Nepal means this is especially difficult to collect. First you have to 
assume the district office keeps precise records. Then you have to get to the 
district office. Then you have to hope that the office will be open. If it's 
not? Well, there will be a blank space on the form."

It is expected that the 2011 census will present a more accurate figure for 
Nepal's MMR. This will be invaluable because, in human terms, the difference 
between the two existing figures is huge. While both report a decline of about 
40%, they also report a difference of about 4,000 maternal deaths a year.

Who are these 4,000 women? Do they exist? If so, why don't they count?
