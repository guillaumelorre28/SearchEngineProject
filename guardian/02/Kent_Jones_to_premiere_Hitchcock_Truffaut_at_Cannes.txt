A documentary based on the “Bible of cinema” will premiere at the Cannes film 
festival <https://www.theguardian.com/film/cannesfilmfestival> next month as 
director Kent Jones’s Hitchcock/Truffaut leads the Cannes Classics lineup.

Jones’s film, about the influence of Truffaut’s 1966 book, Cinema According to 
Hitchcock, will include interviews with Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Wes 
Anderson and David Fincher.

The book, based on 12 hours of conversation with Hitchcock about his craft, 
has proved hugely influential. “For me, and for many others, the book was more 
than formative – it was essential,”Jones told Variety

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promenade_de_la_Croisette> will be McQueen: The 
Man and Le Mans, a documentary on the Hollywood icon’s attempt to make the 
definitive motor-racing film. The project, which Steve McQueen started while 
riding high on the success of hits Bullitt and The Thomas Crown Affair, came at 
great financial and personal cost.

Lumet, about the director of 12 Angry Men, Serpico and Network, and Harold and 
Lilian: a Hollywood love story, which tells the story of how the marriage 
between storyboarder Harold Michelson and his film-researcher wife, Lillian, 
survived 60 years in Hollywood.
