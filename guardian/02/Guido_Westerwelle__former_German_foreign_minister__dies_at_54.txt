University Hospital of complications relating to leukaemia treatment.”

Since the 1980s, Westerwelle had been one of the most established and 
well-known political faces in Germany. He once famously attracted the wrath of 
the Belarusian presidentAlexander Lukashenko 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexander-lukashenko> after condemning human 
rights abuses in the country, which he described as “the last dictatorship in 
Europe”.

Lukashenko shot back with: “It’s better to be a dictator than gay.” 
Westerwelle responded by saying Lukashenko’s remark “spoke for itself”.

Westerwelle became leader of the Free Democrats (FDP), a pro-business liberal 
party, in 2001 at the age of 39. He was at the helm when the party entered 
government in 2009 as the junior coalition partner to Merkel’s Christian 
Democrats.

He stepped down in 2011 as party leader and vice-chancellor after a poor 
showing by the FDP in state elections, but stayed on as foreign minister until 
the federal elections of 2013.

He withdrew from public life following those elections, when the FDP failed to 
pass the 5% threshold necessary to enter the Bundestag for the first time since 
1949.

Westerwelle was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in June 2014. He had 
undergone chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant.

He made his last public appearances in autumn to promote his autobiography, 
Between Two Lives, in Berlin. In a four-hour interview with Spiegel magazine he 
talked about his life and his fear of dying.

In 2011, days after David Cameron vetoed an EU-wide treaty change to tackle 
the eurozone crisis, Westerwelle flew to London for crisis talks with his 
British counterpart, William Hague, quoting the Simon & Garfunkel song to 
explain he was there to “build a bridge over troubled water”.

He made a passionate speech in favour of the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> as he tried to convince the British 
public they would be better off within the organisation, which he described as 
being “not only the answer to the darkest chapter in Germany’s history. It is 
also a life insurance in times of globalisation because no country, not 
Germany, not Great Britain, not France, is strong enough … to face the 
challenges of globalisation on its own, so we should stay united.”

A statement issued by Westerwelle’s foundation on behalf of Westerwelle and 
his husband, Michael Mronz, a media manager, said: “We fought. We had a goal in 
front of us.” They added they were “thankful for an unbelievably brilliant time 
together. Love remains”.

Christian Lindner, head of the FDP, held a press conference in which he paid 
tribute to Westerwelle’s “love of life and his immeasurable optimism”, adding 
that he had been a “convinced free-market economist, a defender of a tolerant 
and open society and a staunch European”.

President Joachim Gauck called him a “passionate political person”, praising 
his contribution to European integration and for his campaign to secureGermany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> a permanent seat on the UN security 
council.

Martin Schulz, president of the European parliament wrote on Twitter: “Very 
sad about the death of Guido Westerwelle. The FDP has lost a defining figure. 
Thoughts are with his husband, family and friends.”

Omid Nouripour, a leading member of the Greens, tweeted: “Guido Westerwelle 
was a strident, uncompromising and upright democrat. May he rest in peace.”
