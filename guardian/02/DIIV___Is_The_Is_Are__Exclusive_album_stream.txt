DIIV’s Zachary Cole-Smith certainly stands out from your typical indie rock 
frontman. Just take his comments on the making of this, his band’s second 
album, which are framed in rather disturbing life and death terms: “I know I 
have to stay alive at least until the album’s done,” he told NME. “This is one 
shot at immortality, if I ever have one. I know it’s by far the most important 
thing I’ll ever do.”

Is The Is Are is certainly ambitious. A double album that takes their debut 
Oshin’s obsession with sonic textures and runs with it across 17 tracks. There 
are moments of exquisite beauty – swan-diving guitar lines and vocals that seem 
to be absorbed by the waves of sound – and moments where they just want to rock 
out, like on the melodic Dopamine.
