1952 saw young jazz musicians go straight, when bebop chamber-group the Modern 
Jazz <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> Quartet – formerly Dizzy 
Gillespie orchestra's rhythm section – bought tuxedos to look like classical 
performers. When pianist John Lewis, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bassist Percy 
Heath and drummer Kenny Clarke became the MJQ, a popular hybrid of jazz and 
baroque-like classical forms developed. With one change, the line-up stayed 
together for 43 years.
