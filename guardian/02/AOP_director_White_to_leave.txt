Alexandra White is standing down as director of the Association of Online 
Publishers <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aop> after five years in the role.

Ms White will leave in July to spend three months doing volunteer work for the 
Waterberg Welfare Society, a South African charity working with people with HIV 
and Aids.

She plans to return to work in the media industry in October.

Ms White joined the AOP in 2002 as the sole member of staff. The trade body 
for web publishers now has 160 members, including all the UK's major online 
media organisations, including the BBC, Associated New Media, Emap, Reuters and 
Guardian Unlimited.

The Guardian Media Group director of digital strategy and development, Simon 
Waldman, is chairman of the AOP.

He replaced Bill Murray, the managing director of group business information 
strategy for Haymarket Publishing, who stepped down in October 2006.

"When I joined the AOP there were just seven people on the board, and AOP 
wasn't much more than a twinkle in Simon's and Bill's eyes," said Ms White.

"It's a different industry to five years ago. The AOP is now an established 
organisation representing most of the big digital publishing companies in the 
UK, and it will continue to benefit from growth in the industry and will 
contribute to that growth. I'm very proud of what I've achieved."

The AOP board will meet shortly to discuss recruiting her replacement. 

Ms White said her successor will see the UK's web publishing industry continue 
to grow. The AOP's member census published last week predicted industry growth 
of 72% from January 2007 to January 2008.
