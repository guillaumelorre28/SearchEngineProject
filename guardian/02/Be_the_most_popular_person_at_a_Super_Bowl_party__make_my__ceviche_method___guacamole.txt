Let’s get your first problem out of the way: you are increasingly convinced 
that professional football is animmoral endeavor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/04/american-football-is-too-dangerous-and-it-should-be-abolished>
, representative of thevery worst aspects of American society 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/28/declining-interest-baseball-waning-american-power>
.

But you don’t like the idea of being such a scold. Who are you to so judge? 
You can feel yourself becoming less pleasant to be around. But you genuinely 
like people and find pleasure in taking part in cultural celebrations. You like 
to drink beer and watch the excesses of the television advertising industry at 
their most expensive and ridiculous.

Solution: try to ignore your reservations. Today is not the day to make a 
stand. Accept an invitation to watch theSuper Bowl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/super-bowl> at a friend’s place, even if it 
will be the first football game you’ve watched all year.

Second problem: what to contribute to the food that people will eat at the 
party. Solution: relax. Tell your host that you will make guacamole. Guacamole 
is delicious and easy to make and has become an integral part of the American 
Super Bowl holiday.

Fifteen years ago, Americans ate some 8m avocados while the game was on. This 
yearwe will eat more than 10 times 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/31/avocado-consumption-super-bowl_n_2593831.html>
 that amount.

If your host says, “No, don’t. I’m making my own,” or “No, that’s OK, someone 
else has already promised to make the guacamole,” tell him or her to shut up 
and change the plan. Because I happen to know the best way to make guacamole, 
and I am prepared to share my secret with you. More than prepared: Iinsist on 
sharing it.

Guacamole is the one thing that I am better at making than anybody else. The 
pride I take in my recipe, and how I came to develop it, is frankly a little 
embarrassing. I call it “the ceviche method”.

 ‘I tend to think of one avocado per grownup for this recipe.’ 
Here’s what you need:

1) A bunch of avocados. (How many people will be eating your guacamole? I tend 
to think of one avocado per grownup. Let’s say 10.)

2) Limes, a lot of them. Four? Five? Six? Ten? It’s OK, they’re inexpensive 
and extras can be used to display juggling skills or to make more drinks.

3) Salt.

4) Chili peppers. Serranos for more heat; jalapeños for more fruit – or, hey, 
why not both?!

5) Garlic. Four cloves.

6) One large red onion.

7) Cilantro. Two bunches to be safe.

 ‘Use chili peppers: serranos for more heat; jalapeños for more fruit.’ 
Go shopping the day before you are going to make the guacamole. This way, you 
can err on the side of purchasing slightly under-ripe avocados, and keep them 
in a paper bag overnight to soften them up if need be.

Now this is the important part: bring your ingredients to the party. Do not 
make it at home. Guests will be more than happy to accommodate you, especially 
if you wash the mess you’ve created afterward.

Put the ingredients where your host tells you to while you have your first 
drink and stare at the TV mounted on the wall in the living room and try to 
think about other things than the fact that you are about to engage in 
something that you find morally reprehensible. How about this: “avocado” is 
derived from the Aztec wordahuacate, which means “testicle”. 
<http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5563805>

Perhaps relatedly, avocados have long been considered an aphrodisiac. You 
might want to have another drink. Are there Coronas in the fridge? You’ve 
brought plenty of limes.

Get a large bowl and cut open two or three of the other limes and squeeze 
their juice into the bowl. Important: this happens first! Lime juice goes into 
the bowl first! This is the secret to the “ceviche method” of guacamole 
production. Next, add the chopped garlic and onion.

The pool of lime juice at the bottom of the bowl will serve as an acid bath, 
essentially cooking the garlic and onion, softening their bite while absorbing 
their robust flavors into the base of your guacamole.

Add salt, immediately. You can adjust to taste later, but you want to add some 
now, as salt helps to denature the garlic and onion too. (“Curing” is the word 
usually used here.)


Next: the chilies. Yum! Make sure to slice them lengthwise, and take out the 
seeds before cutting up the flesh.

Give it a stir and then let your ingredients soak for a while. Have another 
drink. Has the game started? Has anyone been concussed yet?Any brain function 
debilitated

? Any lives shortened for the purpose of the American viewing public’s 
entertainment? Did you give your gladiators a thumbs up or thumbs down?

Wait! Sorry! Stop! Don’t think about these things! You have avocados to de-pit 
and quarter!

 ‘I like a pretty smooth mosh, so I slice my avocados into thin pieces – so the 
soft flesh sits in the shell like cards in a Rolodex.’ 
How chunky do you like your guacamole? I like a pretty smooth mosh, so I slice 
my avocados into thin pieces – so the soft flesh sits in the shell like cards 
in a Rolodex that can be easily spooned, or just pushed out with fingers, into 
the bowl. Mosh to desired consistency with a fork.

Chop cilantro. A lot of it, a great deal! Cilantro is delicious! I feel 
terribly for those poor people afflicted with the conditionthat makes this 
fabulous herb taste like soap 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/dining/14curious.html> on their tongues. 
They are missing out on one of the great pleasures the world has to offer. 
Though it leaves more cilantro for the rest of us to enjoy.

Once you have enough, throw that chopped cilantro on the top of your mosh. Mix 
it up a bit to spread all your flavors throughout your bowl, and that’s pretty 
much it.

Walk proudly out into the living room, refraining as best you can from making 
any comments as to the moral turpitude of your host and fellow guests, and 
present your masterpiece. Prepare to be the most popular person at the party.

 ‘Don’t forget to bring chips.’ 
Shit! Chips! Where are the chips?! You forgot tortilla chips?! What’s 
everybody supposed to use to eat this guacamole? Oreos? Jesus Christ you idiot. 
Talk about moral turpitude.

 Don’t forget to bring chips.
