 after the Philippine leader warned him and other leaders against questioning 
his bloody anti-drug campaign with the words “son of a whore”.

On Wednesday, Obama and Duterte shook hands and talked briefly before 
attending a gala dinner at the summit.

“They met at the holding room. They were the last persons to leave the holding 
room,” the Philippine foreign secretary Perfecto Yasay said, insisting that the 
countries’ relationship was “firm, very strong.”

A White House official said the exchange “consisted of pleasantries between 
the two”.

Philippine senator Alan Peter Cayetano said the “warm handshake and good 
conversation” between Obama and Duterte was a sign that “all’s well that ends 
well,” adding: “There was an efforts on both sides to patch things up.”


Marciano Paynor, chief Philippine protocol officer and the country’s incoming 
ambassador to the United States, said Duterte was learning “quick” during the 
summit, his international debut since becoming president on 30 June.
