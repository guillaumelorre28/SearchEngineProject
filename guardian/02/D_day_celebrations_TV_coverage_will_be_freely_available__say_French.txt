Following my posting on Tuesday, TV coverage of D-day commemorations could be 
blacked out in rights dispute 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jun/03/d-day-france>, the 
French embassy has been in touch to point toa statement issued by France's 
foreign ministry: 
<http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/press-room/article/commemoration-of-the-normandy-19314>

"Contrary to information that may have been provided in error, we confirm that 
the international signal will be released free of charge to all foreign 
television channels.

It will be available to the International Press Centre hub, the EBU 
<http://www3.ebu.ch/home> and SERTE.

Satellite reception parameters can also be provided to all foreign channels on 
request.

Viewers from all over the world will therefore have full live access to all 
footage of the ceremonies on 6 June."

I am awaiting a comment from a Thomson Reuters spokesman who has complained, 
along with other news agencies such as AFP and theAssociated Press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/associated-press>, that they will be charged 
for access to re-transmit live coverage of the commemoration.

They said on Tuesday, as I reported, that two French broadcasters – France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> Televisions and TF1 – had been 
granted exclusive live rights to Friday's events and were seeking nearly 
€200,000 (£163,000) as a rights fee.
