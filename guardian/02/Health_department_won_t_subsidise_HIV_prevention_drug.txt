An HIV prevention drug will not be taxpayer-subsidised after it failed to 
receive recommendation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.

An application to list Truvada – a once-daily pill that costs about $750 a 
month and is aimed at preventing HIV transmission – was rejected on Friday by 
the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.

The Department Of Health <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/health> 
said the price requested by the maker, Gilead Sciences, was far too high and it 
was not feasible to limit the drug to a smaller, high-risk subset of the whole 
“at risk” population.

“The PBAC would welcome another submission ... addressing its concerns about 
cost effectiveness and the appropriate eligible population,” a spokeswoman said 
in a statement.

The Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations said it was disappointed with 
the decision, urging Gilead to submit another application.

“People are needlessly getting HIV while we wait for access to this prevention 
pill,” its chief executive, Darryl O’Donnell, said.

The Australian Greens want the government to pay for people to import the drug.


The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, wants a compromise of some sort from the 
government, including funding for personal importation.


“It costs an individual about $1200 each year to import this medication, which 
simply isn’t possible for many Australians who are at risk of HIV 
transmission,” he said.


“We simply cannot leave Australians at unnecessary risk, when this drug gives 
us the chance to end HIV transmission in Australia.”
