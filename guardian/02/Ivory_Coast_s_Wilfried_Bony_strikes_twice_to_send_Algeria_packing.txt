Bony nodded in a cross from Max Gradel in the 26th minute after being left 
completely alone at the far post. The Manchester City forward scored another in 
the 68th, restoring Ivory Coast’s lead by heading in a free-kick taken by his 
new club team-mate Yaya Touré.

Algeria had levelled six minutes into the second half, Hilal Soudani taking a 
pass from Riyad Mahrez and sending in a shot that trickled through a weakIvory 
Coast <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ivorycoast> defence and beat the 
goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo.

Gervinho added a third in injury time as the Algerians pushed forward in a 
desperate attempt to equalise.

The Ivorians will next face Congo in the semi-finals on Wednesday in Bata.
