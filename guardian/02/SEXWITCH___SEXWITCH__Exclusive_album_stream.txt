Iranian folk traditions. Crate-digging in Thailand. The “dark, wild, primal 
feminine”. These are some of the things that have influenced the debut album by 
SEXWITCH, a collaboration between Bat for Lashes’ Natasha Khan, producer Dan 
Carey and the members of psych-rock band Toy.

The six tracks here are all covers, versions of songs that Khan and Carey 
picked up while on jaunts to places as far flung as Morocco, Thailand and Iran. 
The lyrics have been translated, and the songs recorded live in a single 
session. The result is a selection of hypnotic, groove-based tracks that 
feature jagged post-punk guitars (Helelyos), shrieking crescendos (Kassidat El 
Hakka) and even a cover of Skip Spence’s War in Peace.
