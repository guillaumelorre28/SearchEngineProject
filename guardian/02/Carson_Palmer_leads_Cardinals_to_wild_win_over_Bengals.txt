Chandler Catanzaro kicked a 32-yard field goal with two seconds remaining and 
the Arizona Cardinals escaped with a wild 34-31 victory over theCincinnati 
Bengals <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cincinnati-bengals> on Sunday night.

The field goal was considerably closer than it would have been because 
Cincinnatiâ€™s Domata Peko was called for unsportsmanlike conduct for calling out 
the offensive signals as the Cardinals (8-2) were about to spike the ball to 
set up the kick.

Carson Palmer overcame two early interceptions to throw four touchdown passes 
and, with 57 seconds left, completed three quick passes to move the team into 
field goal range after the Bengals rallied to tie it at 31.

Andy Dalton threw two touchdown passes for the Bengals (8-2), both to Tyler 
Eifert. The second, a 10-yarder, cut it to 31-28 with 3:44 to play.
