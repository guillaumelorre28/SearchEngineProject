Last week found the Turkish government trying to send a newspaper editor to 
prison for 525 years on 105 separate counts of saying the wrong thing. This 
week PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan is at it again, telling publishers to say, "Sorry, 
there's no place in our shop" to financial correspondents who don't talk up 
Turkey's coup-quavery currency.

"You cannot say, 'I cannot intervene in what the columnist writes'," says 
Erdogan. "Nobody has a right to increase tension in this country. I cannot let 
such articles upset financial balances. You pay the salary of that columnist 
and tomorrow you will have no right to complain. I am talking to the media 
bosses. No one has the right to turn a country's economy on its head. We won't 
allow it … Please, everyone should be aware of their limits."

Which lends a certain perspective to Andrew Rawnsley

clenched fist between democratic friends?

■ ITV <https://www.theguardian.com/business/itv> takes total control of GMTV 
and announces that some of the breakfast team will be culled. Penny Smith, 
after 17 distinguished years of sofa duty, is leaving to seek other challenges. 
Penny is 51, unlike Kate (42), Emma (32) and even Lorraine (50). If she was a 
Moira working for the BBC, you could predict press reaction. Clear several 
pages for another dissertation on TV's terrible ageism. But, hey! This is the 
private sector. And it's all gone awfully quiet.
