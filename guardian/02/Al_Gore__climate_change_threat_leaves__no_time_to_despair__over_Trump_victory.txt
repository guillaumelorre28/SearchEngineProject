The urgent threat of climate change means there is “no time to despair” over 
the election of Donald Trump, according to former vice-presidentAl Gore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/algore>, who hopes that Barack Obama and 
Hillary Clinton will join an escalated climate campaign against the 
president-elect.

Gore told the Guardian he remained hopeful Trump would reverse some of his 
positions on climate change but predicted an unprecedented backlash from 
environmentalists over the next four years.

Trump, who has called climate change a hoax 
<https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en>, has 
pledged to withdraw the US fromthe Paris climate accord 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/donald-trump-paris-climate-deal-change-open-mind>
, dismantle the Clean Power Plan, slash renewable energy funding and somehow 
prop up the ailing US coal industry.

His advisers have also advocated cutting climate research at Nasa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/22/nasa-earth-donald-trump-eliminate-climate-change-research>
 andcompletely exiting the international climate effort 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/02/trump-break-from-paris-climate-deal-unfccc-exit>
.

Gore said such threats mean there will “likely be a huge upsurge in climate 
activism. I’m encouraged that there are groups that are digging in to work even 
harder. Those groups working in the courts are even more important now; those 
organizing on campuses are even more important now.

“My message would be that despair is just another form of denial. There is no 
time to despair. We don’t have time to lick our wounds, to hope for a different 
election outcome.

“We have to win this struggle and we will win it; the only question is how 
fast we win. But more damaged is baked into the climate system every day, so 
it’s a race against time.”

On Monday, Gore spent around an hour meeting with Trump and his daughter 
Ivanka, who reportedly plans to speak out on climate change despite her 
father’s skepticism of the issue.

“I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect,” Gore 
said, after emerging from the meeting at Trump Tower in New York City.

“It was a sincere search for areas of common ground. I had a meeting 
beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the 
president-elect, Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting 
conversation, and to be continued, and I’m just going to leave it at that.”

Gore said he hoped Obama and Clinton, who was defeated by Trump in the 8 
November 8 despitewinning the popular vote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/04/pence-and-priebus-defend-trumps-claim-that-millions-voted-illegally>
 by more than 2.6m ballots, will join in the effort to call for action to 
combat dangerous climate change.

“I would hope they do get involved. They both have the right positions on 
climate change and in his second term president Obama did a really excellent 
job in highlighting the climate crisis,” he said.

It’s not naive or Pollyanna-ish to express hope that some of Trump's 
statements won’t turn into policies

Gore has devoted himself to the climate issue since his failed presidential 
bid in 2000 – in which he won 500,000 more votes than George W Bush – most 
notably through the film An Inconvenient Truth and more recently via his 
advocacy group theClimate Reality Project 
<https://www.climaterealityproject.org/>.

He said he was “very concerned” by how pro-fossil fuel interests surround 
Trump but remained optimistic that the president-elect could be engaged with on 
climate change.

“Presidents can be vulnerable to the headstrong opinions of appointees and a 
few appointees can take the ball and run with it before a new president can 
undo the damage,” Gore said. “So that concerns me, of course.

“But it’s still premature. It’s not naive or Pollyanna-ish to express hope 
that some of his statements won’t turn into policies after the inauguration.

“Trump has said that he has an open mind to the Paris agreement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/donald-trump-paris-climate-deal-change-open-mind>
. I frankly don’t know how open his mind is. Until hope is foreclosed, it’s 
worthwhile to see if there’s an opportunity to build green infrastructure, for 
example, or eliminate fossil fuel subsidies based on market-based competition.

“Regardless of what he does, a sustainable energy revolution is under way.”

The United Nations has warned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un>
 that global greenhouse gas emissions must be radically cut within the next 
four years if the world is to avoid disastrous heatwaves, sea level rise and 
displacement caused by runaway climate change.

Gore’s Climate Reality Project is hosting its sixth annual 24 Hours of Reality 
<https://www.24hoursofreality.org/> broadcast, starting on Monday evening. Each 
hour of the 24-hour live event will focus on climate change in one of the 24 
largest national emitters of carbon dioxide in the world.

Broadcast across various TV channels and Facebook, the event will feature 
politicians and celebrities including Ryan Reynolds, Jon Bon Jovi and Gisele 
Bundchen.
