Reportedly the first in a trilogy, Pilcrow is a fictional memoir that takes 
the reader on a journey through the early life of John Cromer, who, aged three, 
is struck down by a mysterious illness. Misdiagnosis leads to a protracted 
period of bed rest, and when the discovery that he has Still's disease is 
finally made, his bones have become irreparably set. John promises that he will 
not "fall victim to boredom" and his narrative stands as a testament to this 
vow; the detail in which he describes the minutiae of his coming of age is as 
unyielding as his poor joints. This plethora of observation can feel wearisome 
at times; it is fortunate that Mars-Jones is an exceptional writer and his 
narrator is idiosyncratic and charming.
