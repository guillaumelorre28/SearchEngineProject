The Association of Online Publishers <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aop> 
is to lose its director, Ruth Brownlee, after just 10 months in the job, 
MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal.

The appointment of Brownlee to the role in December 2007 was a significant 
coup for the six-year-old trade body, which felt it would benefit from her 
previous commercial roles at Yahoo, Handbag and Channel 4.

But Brownlee has decided to leave the job to look after her two pre-school 
children, and said the role of coordinating events and industry representation 
for the 160-member group demands far more than its current part-time status.

"I'm a 100% kind of person and though it depends on your circumstances, and 
what your other half does, my style is to get totally under the skin of 
something," she said.

"But I need to give 110% to my kids. Hats off to women who can do both. I'm 
privileged that I had the choice.

"The job involves more than I expected it to but was more than I had hoped. 
Partly that's to do with our amazing industry, which is just on fire."

Brownlee said a headhunter had been appointed to recruit her replacement, who 
is expected to be in place by Christmas.

The AOP chairman, Simon Waldman, who is also director of digital strategy and 
development for the Guardian Media Group, will stay in his role until April 
2009 to oversee the new director.
