Mystery Jets <https://www.theguardian.com/music/mystery-jets> have always been 
a band fond of making music in unusual surroundings – they first emerged, lest 
we forget, from the peculiar Eel Pie island in West London.

This fifth album is no different. Recorded in a disused button factory, it was 
also the product of singer Blaine Harrison locking himself away in a cabin on 
the Thames estuary. Not that it sounds claustrophobic. Rather, the likes of 
Bombay Blue and the Lennon-esque The End Up have an expansive, widescreen 
quality about them.

The band claim that the album is a result of rediscovering their gang 
mentality, and could be their most personal recording to date. “We’ve been 
through quite a lot in the last couple of years,” says guitarist Will Rees, 
“and there have been certain realisations that come with playing in a band that 
has been together for over two decades, I think these songs have real feeling 
about them.”
