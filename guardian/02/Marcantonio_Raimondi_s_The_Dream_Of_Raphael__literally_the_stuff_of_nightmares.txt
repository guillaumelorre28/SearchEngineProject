Total nightmare

The sleeping women exposed to the psycho-sexual horrors crawling from the sea; 
the panic-stricken stick men in the burning building, hopelessly scrabbling up 
walls: this engraving is literally the stuff of nightmares.

Dream man

Did Raphael have dreams like these? The title acknowledges the pioneering 
engraver Marcantonio Raimondi’s famous collaboration with the Renaissance star. 
Yet it’s thought to pre-date their work together in Rome.

Apocalypse now

While the engraving elicits timeless heebie jeebies, it’s thought to tap into 
a contemporary mood. It was made in an era when people thought the apocalypse 
was nigh and, in any case, there was plenty of plague and war.

Pocket rocket

One ambiguous image is the phallic bug. Insects were taken as portents of 
destruction, yet it also recalls flying cock charms from ancient Rome. By the 
15th century, these winged willies had been associated with creativity.

In the mix

Dürer is one possible influence for this work – likely created in Venice – as 
are Giorgione’s reclining nudes.
