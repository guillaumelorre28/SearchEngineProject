That's all folks

I reckon that will do us for today. Thanks very much for your company as 
always.

Let’s reflect on events of the day and try and read the tea leaves.

 * Malcolm Turnbull was in Sydney, talking education, and talking to voters at 
the Penrith Westfield, retracing steps from a less successful foray into the 
marginal seat of Lindsay a couple of weeks back. Turnbull was chased by the 
Chaser, one lady cried and another shouted at him about aged care.

 * Bill Shorten went to Cairns and spoke about the Great Barrier Reef before 
boarding a glass bottomed boat for an ocean adventure.

 * Let’s think about what the leaders are doing as a marker of what might be 
happening in the campaign.Malcolm Turnbull is sand-bagging, he’s basically 
visiting marginal seats with small wads of cash, which is what leaders do when 
they are trying to ensure their opponent is not sneaking up on them. The word 
out of Coalition HQ is things are good in the marginals, so that’s either 
correct and the prime minister is attempting to ensure things stay that way, or 
things are less good than the bunker suggests.

 * Bill Shorten is spending a lot of time in regional Queensland, which is 
where Labor needs to win seats if it is to have any hope of winning on 2 July. 
Does spending a lot of time in Queensland mean things are going well or badly? 
In truth it could mean either, but Shorten is looking confident and relaxed and 
the opposite of harried. So make of that what you will.

It’s an odd campaign, this one, nothing much sticking, so long still to go. 
Anyway enough of the imponderables. Have a relaxing evening. I’ll see you again 
tomorrow.

Bit of cut-through on one of the key issues of the day from my colleague 
Lenore Taylor –regardless of all the posturing, neither side (this far at 
least) is ruling out governing in the event of a hung parliament (as opposed to 
taking us all back to the polls).

All the talk about who will or won’t do post-election deals with independents 
and minor parties misses the point – they might reject formal “deals” but 
neitherMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> nor Bill Shorten 
has yet ruled out leading a minority government reliant on winning enough 
crossbench support for each bill they try to legislate.

Despite the spectacle of both leaders signing a “solemn pledge” drafted by the 
Daily Telegraph 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/federal-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-pledge-to-never-repeat-gillardgreens-experiment/news-story/c62ed14911e5c4b4933934586416adb6>
 ruling out a “deal or alliance” with the Greens, neither has ruled out seeking 
to govern in the event of a hung parliament if enough of the crossbench agreed 
to the two basic prerequisites – to support the money bills needed for the 
government to function and not to support a no-confidence motion moved by the 
other side.

NSW man charged over offensive Peris posts

The ABC is reporting 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-30/federal-election-live-may-30/7457584> 
that Woy Woy-based chiropractor and osteopathChris Nelson, 64, has been 
arrested at his business this afternoon, and charged with using a carriage 
service to cause offence. Nelson is allegedly responsible for posting racist 
comments on the Facebook page of outgoing Labor SenatorNova Peris. Peris shared 
the offensive post through her social media accounts, which said: “You were 
only endorsed by Juliar because you were black. Go back to the bush and suck on 
witchety grubs and yams.” The incident, unsurprisingly, has prompted widespread 
condemnation. Nelson has apparently denied he is responsible, saying his 
account was hacked.

Readers with me last night know that Mike Bowers produced the image of debate 
night – Australian Financial Review political editorLaura Tingle watching on 
with an emotion that could be best characterised as *meh*.
 Journalist Laura Tingle watches the debate between Malcolm Turnbull and Bill 
Shorten held at the National Press Club in Canberra on Sunday evening. 
Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian 
Tingle has written about her experience 
<http://www.afr.com/news/politics/election/election-2016-answer-the-bloody-question-or-why-pollies-are-the-debate-losers-20160530-gp79fh#ixzz4A7YaJtY2>
 on the panel last night, and about election debates mugging themselves largely 
because the political parties mug themselves by their fixation with the 
intricate rules for these contests.

Laura Tingle:

Debates therefore have become a classic exercise in tactics conquering 
strategy. Political spinners will argue after a debate how each leader got 
their big message across. But unfortunately, having made themselves dull as 
dishwater, a declining number of people are actually listening to those 
messages.

Wise heads will say the exercise is about getting in and out in one piece. But 
if this is the case, what is the point in being in politics in the first place?

For example, the overwhelming question about Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> that you get 
asked by voters in the street, and which shows up in focus groups, is the one 
about what he has become: voters want to know what happened to the bloke they 
thought had become prime minister in September, who represented a more centrist 
political path, and a person who could get things done.

It seemed astonishing that Turnbull didn’t expect the question on Sunday 
night, or was not prepared to deal with it. What a golden opportunity to 
address this issue head on.

Instead voters were treated to rote speeches from both leaders that not only 
sounded evasive but like they were a couple of dullards unable to think on 
their feet. Which is not true of either men.

7.48am BST 07:48  <> 

Back briefly to WestConnex, the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has issued a statement 
to correctBill Shorten’s comment this morning that the money has already been 
allocated.

This from the minister for major projects Paul Fletcher.

The facts are as follows:

 * The Commonwealth government has committed $1.5bn in grant funding and a 
$2bn concessional loan to WestConnex.

 * To date only $750m of the grant has been paid to NSW, with another $450m 
due by 30 June – leaving $300m yet to be paid until after the election.

 * None of the $2n concessional loan has yet been drawn down. $38m will have 
been paid by 2 July, leaving $1.962bn of concessional loan yet to be remitted 
until after the election.

Let me decode all this a little. Most of this is a Seinfeld fight, a fight 
about local politics in the inner west ofSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>. Labor – both Anthony 
Albanese and Bill Shorten – are saying they won’t repudiate contracts in the 
event they win government. Taken literally this means that all the money the 
Commonwealth has agreed contractually to pay will be paid, even though Labor is 
unhappy with the design of the project. But because he’s under pressure in 
Grayndler, and because he’s genuinely unhappy with the design of the project, 
Albanese is trying to project the view that he’s drawing a line with 
WestConnex. Here’s the quote from ten days ago I shared with you earlier today 
on Politics Live.


Anthony Albanese:

If we’re going to be successful in this you’ve got to analyse things as they 
are, rather than as you would like them to be...The fact is this is a state 
coalition government project and the way to stop this project, regardless of 
who is elected federally, is to get the state government to stop this project. 
The fact is if I am the transport minister there will be not one dollar from 
the federal Labor government for this WestConnex project.

As I said earlier today the apparently definitive final section of this quote 
is actually ambiguous when you read it in it’s full context (which is doubtless 
why Albanese’s opponents are fond of circulating the end statement without the 
couple of preceding sentences). The Labor man is saying simultaneously here we 
won’t repudiate existing contracts and we won’t give WestConnex money, which of 
course makes not much sense at all, because it is what it is: walking both 
sides of the political street.

But if we strip out the politics, we can conclude the money the Commonwealth 
has already committed for WestConnex, stands, possibly including the last $300m 
due to be paid after the election, although that part is not entirely clear to 
me. Albanese’s office aren’t providing comment beyond what’s been said publicly.

A bit more on will you or won’t you form a minority government after July 2 if 
that’s what the voters deliver, this time with theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> campaign spokesman, 
Mathias Cormann.

Q: Minister, your deputy leader Julie Bishop says the party would be willing 
to negotiate with independents to form a minority government if the 
circumstances arose, which independents and minor parties would be acceptable 
in your mind.

Mathias Cormann:

We are working hard every single day to win the trust of a majority of people 
in a majority of seats. Our ...

Q: Sure but if the polls are to be believed, there could very well be a 
minority government or a hung parliament, so would you rule out doing any deals 
with any independents?

Mathias Cormann:

Our focus in on winning the trust and confidence of a majority of the 
Australian people in a majority of seats. That is why, every single day in this 
campaign, we have been and will continue to, promote the importance of our plan 
for jobs and growth, the importance of our plan to promote stronger growth at 
this point for the Australian people.

Q: Do you agree with Julie Bishop’s comments?

Mathias Cormann:

What I agree with, is that every single day we are campaigning to win the 
trust of a majority of people in a majority of seats. That we are campaigning 
to win this election so that we can continue to implement our plan for jobs and 
growth. That we can continue to implement our plan to secure the successful 
transition in our economy, which is currently taking place.

Q: But surely you must be concerned by the analysis in Newspoll, suggesting 
that 16 seats could be lost across New South Wales, Queensland and Western 
Australia?

Mathias Cormann:

We have always said that this election will be close. What that means is that 
every single vote matters. Every single Australian at this election has a very 
clear choice. They have a choice between our plan for jobs and growth, our plan 
to put Australia on a stronger foundation for the future. Or the alternative 
Labor approach which would bring with it political instability, which would 
bring with it higher taxes, which would bring with it fewer jobs and weaker 
borders. Because a Labor Green government led byBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> will not be stable, 
it will lead to higher taxes, which will hurt jobs and growth and will lead to 
weaker borders, because even just in the Labor party, which is deeply divided 
when it comes to Border protection, about 34 Labor Members and candidates have 
come out against Australia’s strong border protection policies. Labor doesn’t 
believe in our strong border protection policies. They are talking tough before 
an election, the same as Kevin Rudd did in 2007. Remember what Kevin Rudd did 
after the 2007 election? He put the people smugglers back into business.

Q: But if the election is as close as you keep saying you believe it is going 
to be, isn’t it a political reality that you need to think about possible 
negotiations with crossbenchers?

Mathias Cormann:

The focus right now is on doing everything we can, every single day to 
persuade the Australian people that this is the time to keep going with our 
comprehensive plan for the economy, with our plan for jobs and growth. That 
this is not the time to take risks. This is not the time for political 
instability. This is not the time for Labor’s higher taxes which would lead to 
fewer jobs, and weaker borders. That is what I am focussed on. That is what all 
of my colleagues are focussed on every single day.

Q: You criticised Labor for changing its policies to suit the Greens. If you 
won’t rule out a minority government with independents, isn’t the same true of 
the Coalition that you might have to change some of your policies to get back 
into minority government?

Mathias Cormann:

Everybody knows what we are campaigning for. We are campaigning for our plan 
for jobs and growth. It is theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> that is on a unity 
ticket with the Greens on an anti-business, anti-success, anti-investment, 
anti-jobs and growth, weaker borders agenda. Don’t take my word for it. That is 
what senior Labor figures are saying and that is what everyone across Australia 
can see.

Q: Senator Bill Shorten is willing to guarantee and he has said this publicly 
many times, that he won’t sit down and negotiate to form minority government. 
Why won’t you give that guarantee?

Mathias Cormann:

It is very, very clear. We are campaigning to win the trust of a majority of 
the Australian people in a majority of seats. That is what we are focussed on. 
Australia right now needs the Turnbull government to continue to implement our 
plan for jobs and growth. That is what we have been doing over the past three 
years or so. That is what we would like to do over the next three years. That 
is what we are asking the Australian people to allow us to do when they cast 
their vote on the 2nd of July.

Q: But you would work with Mr Katter wouldn’t you? He is a former National 
Party minister.

Mathias Cormann:

Again, our focus is on winning a majority of seats. Our focus is on persuading 
a majority of Australian people in a majority of seats to give us their trust 
to continue to implement our plan for jobs and growth.

It’s one thing to think about what the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> might seek in terms of a 
crossbench deal in the event of a hung parliament, but another to consider what 
independents might be prepared to deliver. Thus far the major independents 
active in this campaign have been at pains to say they aren’t interested in 
deals likeTony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott did in the 43rd parliament. They’ve 
been talking considering legislation case by case.

The vexed issue of hung parliaments: Coalition folks saying different things

Fortunately a transcript has arrived so I can now review the prime minister’s 
entire press conference from earlier today. I mentioned this in the lunchtime 
summary: that various government folks are now being pressed on their position 
in the event the voters deliver a hung parliament.Malcolm Turnbull was 
certainly pressed on his position. The relevant quotes are marked out in bold.

(right), speaking to media during his look at a model submarine built by 
students at McCarthy Catholic College in Emu Plains in the seat of Lindsay, 
western Sydney. Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP 
Q: Mr Turnbull can you guarantee that you would not strike a deal with 
independents to form government if there’s a hung parliament? And if that’s the 
case would you be willing to go back to the polls?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Can I just say to you that we are totally focused on winning this election and 
continuing to govern, delivering our national economic plan. The only party 
that is likely to do a deal with independents and in particular do a deal with 
the Greens is of course the Labor party. The Greens are their political 
brethren. The Greens and theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> are there on the left 
of the spectrum. You can see Labor getting closer to the Greens all the time in 
the course of this election, moving further and further to the left in order to 
protect electorates, seats like Mr Albanese’s and Tanya Plibersek’s and so 
forth. The forgetful Mr Feeney, he’s got to protect his seat from the Greens, 
that’s one thing he is not going to forget to do that. So Labor moves to the 
left and we’ve seen it before. You don’t have to – this is not a theoretical 
thing. Labor will find its friends on the left. If they were to fall over the 
line in this election they would end up governing with the Greens just as Julia 
Gillard did.

Q: What if the governor general did ask you though to have those conversations 
with independents, other parties, if there was a hung parliament?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Look can I just say to you this is a theoretical possibility. The 
independents, you’re basically talking about the Greens here. The Greens are a 
leftwing political party somewhat to the left of the Labor party. Although the 
Labor party keeps on moving closer to them, so the difference is diminishing. 
But if there is any government put together on that basis, we know from 
experience – again we don’t have to theorise – it will be done between Labor 
and the Greens. You’ll end up with a Labor-Green government with all of the 
chaos that ensues. I mean consider this, consider this contrast. You saw last 
night, I set out the key elements of my government’s national economic plan and 
why it’s important, we need a strong economy. We need a strong economy to pay 
for all of the great things that we do. The education services, the programs 
like this, our hospitals and defence. Right across the board. So we need a 
strong economy, we have a plan for that. It’s quite clear that Mr Shorten does 
not. He has nothing to say on that subject, just a series of complaints 
interspersed with a few personal attacks and his trademark zingers. That’s the 
best he can offer.

Now on the other hand, what you have with the Greens, is a party that is 
drawing Labor to it, magnetically drawing Labor to the left. You know what will 
happen if Labor, after the election, if Labor were to win, Mr Bowen has told 
us. He said that there will be a 100-day period during which Labor puts 
together a mini-budget. So we’ve seen Mr Shorten do a backflip on an absolutely 
irrevocable promise to restore the Schoolkids Bonus. We’ve seen him do that 
backflip. If they were to win the election we would have 100 days of complete 
chaos when we would not know what was going to be their economic policy as they 
formulated a mini-budget, no doubt with even higher taxes than the ones they 
are proposing, and do so of course with their coalition partners or their 
likely coalition partners in the Greens.

So the choice is very clear. My government has a plain, straightforward, clear 
economic plan for jobs and growth. We’ve set it out. It’s all fully costed, 
it’s all in the budget, it’s right there. Everyone knows what it contains. 
Everyone knows it will deliver stronger economic growth and more jobs. What do 
we have from Labor? Who knows? Who knows? It’s a backflip from one day to the 
next.

Q: Mr Turnbull why not flatly rule it out? Why not flatly?

Malcolm Turnbull:

What, rule out doing a coalition with the Greens? Of course! There is no way!

Q: No Mr Turnbull, the question –

Malcolm Turnbull:

Yes what is the question?

Q: Mr Turnbull why not just flatly rule out your government doing any deals 
with any Greens or independents? Why not say that to us, because unless I 
misheard you, you did not say that in your first couple of answers.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well I’ve made it very clear. I’ve made it very clear before and I’m surprised 
that you would imagine it was possible that we would be doing deals with the 
Greens or independents.

Q: Well I listened to Julie Bishop, Mr Turnbull.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Julie Bishop was talking about how we would respond, how the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> would respond were we to 
lose the election, to legislation in the Senate. Of course that – she said – is 
judged on its merits, as it always is. Indeed there is nothing new in that.

The simple fact of the matter is we will govern in our own right. We expect to 
win this election because we believe the Australian people will back our 
national economic plan for jobs and growth. What Labor is seeking to do is to 
distract you all from the very clear reality that Labor is a party of the left. 
You saw the policies that they are laying out now, this is the most leftwing, 
anti-business agenda that’s been laid out by a Labor party leader for many, 
many years. What Mr Shorten is doing is attacking business. He is complaining 
about the support we’re giving to business. He seems to think that the 
Australian economy will just continue to grow, notwithstanding everything he 
proposes is designed and calculated to slow that growth, if not turn it back.

For the record, this was Julie Bishop on the AM program this morning. She 
wasn’t actually talking about legislation in the Senate, (although she was 
immediately before she was asked a specific question about the hung 
parliament), which she answered by saying what the Coalition would do in that 
eventuality depended on the “circumstances”.

Q: Well you say that Labor would govern with a coalition with the Greens, 
that’s … Labor says it has ruled out governing in such a coalition again. If 
there was a hung parliament, would you negotiate, or would we be back to the 
polls?

Julie Bishop: 

Well Michael this is all hypothetical. It would depend very much on the 
circumstances. It would depend on the legislation that we were putting forward.

This is a double-dissolution election as you know, and so our anticipation is 
that when the Australian people make their decision as to who they want to 
govern the country, who they trust to govern the country, we would then, on 
this assumption that we were able to win the election, we would then go to a 
joint sitting of both houses of parliament to pass two very important pieces of 
economic and productivity-enhancing measures: the restoration of the Australian 
Building and Construction Commission, and the laws that make union officials as 
accountable as company directors are. So those are two very important pieces of 
legislation. That’s the first thing that we would do, have a joint sitting of 
the Senate and House of Representatives.

Let’s reflect on events of the day and try and read the tea leaves.

 * Malcolm Turnbull was in Sydney, talking education, and talking to voters at 
the Penrith Westfield, retracing steps from a less successful foray into the 
marginal seat of Lindsay a couple of weeks back. Turnbull was chased by the 
Chaser, one lady cried and another shouted at him about aged care.

 * Bill Shorten went to Cairns and spoke about the Great Barrier Reef before 
boarding a glass bottomed boat for an ocean adventure.

 * Let’s think about what the leaders are doing as a marker of what might be 
happening in the campaign.Malcolm Turnbull is sand-bagging, he’s basically 
visiting marginal seats with small wads of cash, which is what leaders do when 
they are trying to ensure their opponent is not sneaking up on them. The word 
out of Coalition HQ is things are good in the marginals, so that’s either 
correct and the prime minister is attempting to ensure things stay that way, or 
things are less good than the bunker suggests.

 * Bill Shorten is spending a lot of time in regional Queensland, which is 
where Labor needs to win seats if it is to have any hope of winning on 2 July. 
Does spending a lot of time in Queensland mean things are going well or badly? 
In truth it could mean either, but Shorten is looking confident and relaxed and 
the opposite of harried. So make of that what you will.

It’s an odd campaign, this one, nothing much sticking, so long still to go. 
Anyway enough of the imponderables. Have a relaxing evening. I’ll see you again 
tomorrow.
 
Bit of cut-through on one of the key issues of the day from my colleague 
Lenore Taylor –regardless of all the posturing, neither side (this far at 
least) is ruling out governing in the event of a hung parliament (as opposed to 
taking us all back to the polls).

All the talk about who will or won’t do post-election deals with independents 
and minor parties misses the point – they might reject formal “deals” but 
neitherMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> nor Bill Shorten 
has yet ruled out leading a minority government reliant on winning enough 
crossbench support for each bill they try to legislate.

Despite the spectacle of both leaders signing a “solemn pledge” drafted by the 
Daily Telegraph 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/federal-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-pledge-to-never-repeat-gillardgreens-experiment/news-story/c62ed14911e5c4b4933934586416adb6>
 ruling out a “deal or alliance” with the Greens, neither has ruled out seeking 
to govern in the event of a hung parliament if enough of the crossbench agreed 
to the two basic prerequisites – to support the money bills needed for the 
government to function and not to support a no-confidence motion moved by the 
other side.

The ABC is reporting 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-30/federal-election-live-may-30/7457584> 
that Woy Woy-based chiropractor and osteopathChris Nelson, 64, has been 
arrested at his business this afternoon, and charged with using a carriage 
service to cause offence. Nelson is allegedly responsible for posting racist 
comments on the Facebook page of outgoing Labor SenatorNova Peris. Peris shared 
the offensive post through her social media accounts, which said: “You were 
only endorsed by Juliar because you were black. Go back to the bush and suck on 
witchety grubs and yams.” The incident, unsurprisingly, has prompted widespread 
condemnation. Nelson has apparently denied he is responsible, saying his 
account was hacked.

<http://www.afr.com/news/politics/election/election-2016-answer-the-bloody-question-or-why-pollies-are-the-debate-losers-20160530-gp79fh#ixzz4A7YaJtY2>
 on the panel last night, and about election debates mugging themselves largely 
because the political parties mug themselves by their fixation with the 
intricate rules for these contests.

Laura Tingle:

Debates therefore have become a classic exercise in tactics conquering 
strategy. Political spinners will argue after a debate how each leader got 
their big message across. But unfortunately, having made themselves dull as 
dishwater, a declining number of people are actually listening to those 
messages.

Wise heads will say the exercise is about getting in and out in one piece. But 
if this is the case, what is the point in being in politics in the first place?

For example, the overwhelming question about Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> that you get 
asked by voters in the street, and which shows up in focus groups, is the one 
about what he has become: voters want to know what happened to the bloke they 
thought had become prime minister in September, who represented a more centrist 
political path, and a person who could get things done.

It seemed astonishing that Turnbull didn’t expect the question on Sunday 
night, or was not prepared to deal with it. What a golden opportunity to 
address this issue head on.

Instead voters were treated to rote speeches from both leaders that not only 
sounded evasive but like they were a couple of dullards unable to think on 
their feet. Which is not true of either men.

Malarndirri McCarthy, a former minister in the Northern Territory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory> government and 
ABC presenter, has won preselection to replace Labor senator Nova Peris. On 
Monday Labor’s national executive selected McCarthy to top the ALP Senate 
ticket in the Northern Territory. McCarthy beat a field of four women: the 
Yothu Yindi Foundation chief executive,Denise Bowden, NT Labor staffer Cathryn 
Tilmouth, former NT Labor minister Marion Scrymgour and Peris’s chief of staff, 
Ursula Raymond.
 
Back briefly to WestConnex, the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has issued a statement 
to correctBill Shorten’s comment this morning that the money has already been 
allocated.

This from the minister for major projects Paul Fletcher.

The facts are as follows:

 * The Commonwealth government has committed $1.5bn in grant funding and a 
$2bn concessional loan to WestConnex.

 * To date only $750m of the grant has been paid to NSW, with another $450m 
due by 30 June – leaving $300m yet to be paid until after the election.

 * None of the $2n concessional loan has yet been drawn down. $38m will have 
been paid by 2 July, leaving $1.962bn of concessional loan yet to be remitted 
until after the election.

Let me decode all this a little. Most of this is a Seinfeld fight, a fight 
about local politics in the inner west ofSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>. Labor – both Anthony 
Albanese and Bill Shorten – are saying they won’t repudiate contracts in the 
event they win government. Taken literally this means that all the money the 
Commonwealth has agreed contractually to pay will be paid, even though Labor is 
unhappy with the design of the project. But because he’s under pressure in 
Grayndler, and because he’s genuinely unhappy with the design of the project, 
Albanese is trying to project the view that he’s drawing a line with 
WestConnex. Here’s the quote from ten days ago I shared with you earlier today 
on Politics Live.


Anthony Albanese:

If we’re going to be successful in this you’ve got to analyse things as they 
are, rather than as you would like them to be...The fact is this is a state 
coalition government project and the way to stop this project, regardless of 
who is elected federally, is to get the state government to stop this project. 
The fact is if I am the transport minister there will be not one dollar from 
the federal Labor government for this WestConnex project.

As I said earlier today the apparently definitive final section of this quote 
is actually ambiguous when you read it in it’s full context (which is doubtless 
why Albanese’s opponents are fond of circulating the end statement without the 
couple of preceding sentences). The Labor man is saying simultaneously here we 
won’t repudiate existing contracts and we won’t give WestConnex money, which of 
course makes not much sense at all, because it is what it is: walking both 
sides of the political street.

But if we strip out the politics, we can conclude the money the Commonwealth 
has already committed for WestConnex, stands, possibly including the last $300m 
due to be paid after the election, although that part is not entirely clear to 
me. Albanese’s office aren’t providing comment beyond what’s been said publicly.
 
A bit more on will you or won’t you form a minority government after July 2 if 
that’s what the voters deliver, this time with theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> campaign spokesman, 
Mathias Cormann.

Q: Minister, your deputy leader Julie Bishop says the party would be willing 
to negotiate with independents to form a minority government if the 
circumstances arose, which independents and minor parties would be acceptable 
in your mind.

Mathias Cormann:

We are working hard every single day to win the trust of a majority of people 
in a majority of seats. Our ...

Q: Sure but if the polls are to be believed, there could very well be a 
minority government or a hung parliament, so would you rule out doing any deals 
with any independents?

Mathias Cormann:

Our focus in on winning the trust and confidence of a majority of the 
Australian people in a majority of seats. That is why, every single day in this 
campaign, we have been and will continue to, promote the importance of our plan 
for jobs and growth, the importance of our plan to promote stronger growth at 
this point for the Australian people.

Q: Do you agree with Julie Bishop’s comments?

Mathias Cormann:

What I agree with, is that every single day we are campaigning to win the 
trust of a majority of people in a majority of seats. That we are campaigning 
to win this election so that we can continue to implement our plan for jobs and 
growth. That we can continue to implement our plan to secure the successful 
transition in our economy, which is currently taking place.

Q: But surely you must be concerned by the analysis in Newspoll, suggesting 
that 16 seats could be lost across New South Wales, Queensland and Western 
Australia?

Mathias Cormann:

We have always said that this election will be close. What that means is that 
every single vote matters. Every single Australian at this election has a very 
clear choice. They have a choice between our plan for jobs and growth, our plan 
to put Australia on a stronger foundation for the future. Or the alternative 
Labor approach which would bring with it political instability, which would 
bring with it higher taxes, which would bring with it fewer jobs and weaker 
borders. Because a Labor Green government led byBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> will not be stable, 
it will lead to higher taxes, which will hurt jobs and growth and will lead to 
weaker borders, because even just in the Labor party, which is deeply divided 
when it comes to Border protection, about 34 Labor Members and candidates have 
come out against Australia’s strong border protection policies. Labor doesn’t 
believe in our strong border protection policies. They are talking tough before 
an election, the same as Kevin Rudd did in 2007. Remember what Kevin Rudd did 
after the 2007 election? He put the people smugglers back into business.

Q: But if the election is as close as you keep saying you believe it is going 
to be, isn’t it a political reality that you need to think about possible 
negotiations with crossbenchers?

Mathias Cormann:

The focus right now is on doing everything we can, every single day to 
persuade the Australian people that this is the time to keep going with our 
comprehensive plan for the economy, with our plan for jobs and growth. That 
this is not the time to take risks. This is not the time for political 
instability. This is not the time for Labor’s higher taxes which would lead to 
fewer jobs, and weaker borders. That is what I am focussed on. That is what all 
of my colleagues are focussed on every single day.

Q: You criticised Labor for changing its policies to suit the Greens. If you 
won’t rule out a minority government with independents, isn’t the same true of 
the Coalition that you might have to change some of your policies to get back 
into minority government?

Mathias Cormann:

Everybody knows what we are campaigning for. We are campaigning for our plan 
for jobs and growth. It is theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> that is on a unity 
ticket with the Greens on an anti-business, anti-success, anti-investment, 
anti-jobs and growth, weaker borders agenda. Don’t take my word for it. That is 
what senior Labor figures are saying and that is what everyone across Australia 
can see.

Q: Senator Bill Shorten is willing to guarantee and he has said this publicly 
many times, that he won’t sit down and negotiate to form minority government. 
Why won’t you give that guarantee?

Mathias Cormann:

It is very, very clear. We are campaigning to win the trust of a majority of 
the Australian people in a majority of seats. That is what we are focussed on. 
Australia right now needs the Turnbull government to continue to implement our 
plan for jobs and growth. That is what we have been doing over the past three 
years or so. That is what we would like to do over the next three years. That 
is what we are asking the Australian people to allow us to do when they cast 
their vote on the 2nd of July.

Q: But you would work with Mr Katter wouldn’t you? He is a former National 
Party minister.

Mathias Cormann:

Again, our focus is on winning a majority of seats. Our focus is on persuading 
a majority of Australian people in a majority of seats to give us their trust 
to continue to implement our plan for jobs and growth.
 
Strange too that I’m spending more time talking to people on the phone and in 
the office than updating the live coverage. Wickedness. This must change.
 
Quite a strange day, this.

It’s one thing to think about what the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> might seek in terms of a 
crossbench deal in the event of a hung parliament, but another to consider what 
independents might be prepared to deliver. Thus far the major independents 
active in this campaign have been at pains to say they aren’t interested in 
deals likeTony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott did in the 43rd parliament. They’ve 
been talking considering legislation case by case.
 
Fortunately a transcript has arrived so I can now review the prime minister’s 
entire press conference from earlier today. I mentioned this in the lunchtime 
summary: that various government folks are now being pressed on their position 
in the event the voters deliver a hung parliament.Malcolm Turnbull was 
certainly pressed on his position. The relevant quotes are marked out in bold.

Q: Mr Turnbull can you guarantee that you would not strike a deal with 
independents to form government if there’s a hung parliament? And if that’s the 
case would you be willing to go back to the polls?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Can I just say to you that we are totally focused on winning this election and 
continuing to govern, delivering our national economic plan. The only party 
that is likely to do a deal with independents and in particular do a deal with 
the Greens is of course the Labor party. The Greens are their political 
brethren. The Greens and theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> are there on the left 
of the spectrum. You can see Labor getting closer to the Greens all the time in 
the course of this election, moving further and further to the left in order to 
protect electorates, seats like Mr Albanese’s and Tanya Plibersek’s and so 
forth. The forgetful Mr Feeney, he’s got to protect his seat from the Greens, 
that’s one thing he is not going to forget to do that. So Labor moves to the 
left and we’ve seen it before. You don’t have to – this is not a theoretical 
thing. Labor will find its friends on the left. If they were to fall over the 
line in this election they would end up governing with the Greens just as Julia 
Gillard did.

Q: What if the governor general did ask you though to have those conversations 
with independents, other parties, if there was a hung parliament?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Look can I just say to you this is a theoretical possibility. The 
independents, you’re basically talking about the Greens here. The Greens are a 
leftwing political party somewhat to the left of the Labor party. Although the 
Labor party keeps on moving closer to them, so the difference is diminishing. 
But if there is any government put together on that basis, we know from 
experience – again we don’t have to theorise – it will be done between Labor 
and the Greens. You’ll end up with a Labor-Green government with all of the 
chaos that ensues. I mean consider this, consider this contrast. You saw last 
night, I set out the key elements of my government’s national economic plan and 
why it’s important, we need a strong economy. We need a strong economy to pay 
for all of the great things that we do. The education services, the programs 
like this, our hospitals and defence. Right across the board. So we need a 
strong economy, we have a plan for that. It’s quite clear that Mr Shorten does 
not. He has nothing to say on that subject, just a series of complaints 
interspersed with a few personal attacks and his trademark zingers. That’s the 
best he can offer.

Now on the other hand, what you have with the Greens, is a party that is 
drawing Labor to it, magnetically drawing Labor to the left. You know what will 
happen if Labor, after the election, if Labor were to win, Mr Bowen has told 
us. He said that there will be a 100-day period during which Labor puts 
together a mini-budget. So we’ve seen Mr Shorten do a backflip on an absolutely 
irrevocable promise to restore the Schoolkids Bonus. We’ve seen him do that 
backflip. If they were to win the election we would have 100 days of complete 
chaos when we would not know what was going to be their economic policy as they 
formulated a mini-budget, no doubt with even higher taxes than the ones they 
are proposing, and do so of course with their coalition partners or their 
likely coalition partners in the Greens.

So the choice is very clear. My government has a plain, straightforward, clear 
economic plan for jobs and growth. We’ve set it out. It’s all fully costed, 
it’s all in the budget, it’s right there. Everyone knows what it contains. 
Everyone knows it will deliver stronger economic growth and more jobs. What do 
we have from Labor? Who knows? Who knows? It’s a backflip from one day to the 
next.

Q: Mr Turnbull why not flatly rule it out? Why not flatly?

Malcolm Turnbull:

What, rule out doing a coalition with the Greens? Of course! There is no way!

Q: No Mr Turnbull, the question –

Malcolm Turnbull:

Yes what is the question?

Q: Mr Turnbull why not just flatly rule out your government doing any deals 
with any Greens or independents? Why not say that to us, because unless I 
misheard you, you did not say that in your first couple of answers.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well I’ve made it very clear. I’ve made it very clear before and I’m surprised 
that you would imagine it was possible that we would be doing deals with the 
Greens or independents.

Q: Well I listened to Julie Bishop, Mr Turnbull.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Julie Bishop was talking about how we would respond, how the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> would respond were we to 
lose the election, to legislation in the Senate. Of course that – she said – is 
judged on its merits, as it always is. Indeed there is nothing new in that.

The simple fact of the matter is we will govern in our own right. We expect to 
win this election because we believe the Australian people will back our 
national economic plan for jobs and growth. What Labor is seeking to do is to 
distract you all from the very clear reality that Labor is a party of the left. 
You saw the policies that they are laying out now, this is the most leftwing, 
anti-business agenda that’s been laid out by a Labor party leader for many, 
many years. What Mr Shorten is doing is attacking business. He is complaining 
about the support we’re giving to business. He seems to think that the 
Australian economy will just continue to grow, notwithstanding everything he 
proposes is designed and calculated to slow that growth, if not turn it back.

For the record, this was Julie Bishop on the AM program this morning. She 
wasn’t actually talking about legislation in the Senate, (although she was 
immediately before she was asked a specific question about the hung 
parliament), which she answered by saying what the Coalition would do in that 
eventuality depended on the “circumstances”.

Q: Well you say that Labor would govern with a coalition with the Greens, 
that’s … Labor says it has ruled out governing in such a coalition again. If 
there was a hung parliament, would you negotiate, or would we be back to the 
polls?

Julie Bishop: 

Well Michael this is all hypothetical. It would depend very much on the 
circumstances. It would depend on the legislation that we were putting forward.

This is a double-dissolution election as you know, and so our anticipation is 
that when the Australian people make their decision as to who they want to 
govern the country, who they trust to govern the country, we would then, on 
this assumption that we were able to win the election, we would then go to a 
joint sitting of both houses of parliament to pass two very important pieces of 
economic and productivity-enhancing measures: the restoration of the Australian 
Building and Construction Commission, and the laws that make union officials as 
accountable as company directors are. So those are two very important pieces of 
legislation. That’s the first thing that we would do, have a joint sitting of 
the Senate and House of Representatives.
 
Meanwhile, to our north. Well, my north. If you are reading in Darwin it will 
be to your south.
