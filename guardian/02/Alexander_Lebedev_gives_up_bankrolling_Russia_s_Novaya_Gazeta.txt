Alexander Lebedev, the Independent’s owner, has given a candid interview to 
the Times <http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article4387422.ece> 
in which he reveals that he is no longer bankrolling his Russian investigative 
newspaper, Novaya Gazeta.

Although the former Russian billionaire and ex-KGB operative remains a 
shareholder, he said he had stopped funding it because of the expense and also 
the strain.

It “probably explains why I’m being left alone” by the authorities, he told 
the Times’s Moscow correspondent, Ben Hoyle, who points out that Lebedev’s 
decision may also explainthe announcement by its editor last Thursday (12 March)
 
<http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/russian-kremlin-critical-newspaper-novaya-gazeta-may-go-out-of-print/517381.html>
 that it will probably stop being published in print from 9 May.

The paper has been acutely critical of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, in 
the past. And Lebedev has faced business difficulties that many observers link 
to his support for Novaya Gazeta, which is co-owned by another critic of Putin,
Mikhail Gorbachev <https://www.theguardian.com/world/mikhail-gorbachev>.

In his interview with Hoyle, Lebedev avoided criticising Putin. He joked: “I 
would rather do a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad”.

His careful statements about Putin echo an interview with the Guardian’s Luke 
Harding three weeks ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/25/independent-owner-general-election-alexander-lebedev>
 in which he insisted: “Don’t call Putin a thug”.

Lebedev also revealed that he suffered a prolonged bout of depression after 
years of pressure from the Russian authorities that resulted in the wrecking of 
his business empire. He told the Times’s reporter:

“I woke up one morning in May; it coincided with what happened in Crimea and I 
suddenly started reflecting and I kept reflecting for six months. You have a 
feeling you’re a complete failure.

“Everything you’ve been standing for, fighting for. Nobody cares. It’s kind of 
an illness but it comes not from purely chemical or biological things”.

But he now feels he is “a freer character”. He said: “Having lost all of your 
businesses you don’t have this heavy weight on your feet... It’s nice not to be 
attacked on a daily basis”.

Lebedev also revealed that he has suffered attempts on his life over the 
years, including one “quite recently”.

In company with his son, Evgeny, he owns the the three Independent titles and 
theLondon Evening Standard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/london-evening-standard>, plus the London 
Live TV channel.


In January 2014, I reported that the Independent was up for sale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jan/16/theindependent-alexander-lebedev>
. But no serious buyer has emerged in the 15 months since.
