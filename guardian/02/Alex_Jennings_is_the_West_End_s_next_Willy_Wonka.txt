Alex Jennings <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alex-jennings> has found the 
golden ticket: he will arrive at Roald Dahl's famous Chocolate Factory when he 
takes over as the West End's Willy Wonka later this year.

Jennings will replace Douglas Hodge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/nov/08/my-dressing-room-douglas-hodge-charlie-chocolate-musical>
 as the crackpot confectioner from 19 May, almost a year after Hodge first 
performed the role in Sam Mendes's big-budget production at the Theatre Royal 
Drury Lane.

It means a return to musicals for Jennings who also recently reprised the role 
for which he won an Olivier award a decade ago, Professor Henry Higgins in My 
Fair Lady, which he performed again first as part of the National Theatre's 
50th anniversary special and then, over Christmas, at theThéâtre du Châtelet in 
Paris

. Jennings has also won Olivier awards for straight dramatic performance (Peer 
Gynt in 1996) and comic performance (Too Clever By Half in 1988). He is an 
associate artist at the National Theatre, where he recently played Alan Bennett 
in the autobiographical double-bill Untold Stories, which transferred to the 
West End.

David Greig's adaptation of Dahl's novel, with music and lyrics by Marc 
Shaiman and Scott Wittman, gives the children's classic a contemporary facelift 
and, while critics were not especially enamoured of the show, it has become one 
of the West End's biggest sellers. Last month, producers claimed that the show 
hadbroken the West End's weekly box-office record for the second time

 . The run has been extended until May 2015.
