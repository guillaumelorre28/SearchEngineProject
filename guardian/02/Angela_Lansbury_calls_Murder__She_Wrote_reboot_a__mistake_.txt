Angela Lansbury says "it's a mistake" for NBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/nbc> to call a new series Murder, She Wrote.

The network recently announced plans to reboot the show

 with Oscar-winner Octavia Spencer as its star. Spencer acknowledged her new TV 
project on Twitter last month.

Lansbury, who will accept an honorary Academy Award later this week, said 
Murder, She Wrote was her "greatest doorway to the world."

"I suddenly became a worldwide-known character as Jessica Fletcher and really 
built an enormous audience, which I have to this day," the 88-year-old said in 
a weekend telephone interview from her New York home. "That was the thing that 
really made me a star in the minds of everybody."

Lansbury had three Oscar nominations and four Tony Awards when she joined the 
CBS drama, which aired from 1984 to 1996, earning her 12 consecutive Emmy 
nominations and international acclaim.

She's sensitive about the show's reinvention.

"I think it's a mistake to call it Murder, She Wrote," Lansbury said, "because 
Murder, She Wrote will always be about a Cabot Cove and this wonderful little 
group of people who told those lovely stories and enjoyed a piece of that 
place, and also enjoyed Jessica Fletcher, who is a rare and very individual 
kind of person ...

"So I'm sorry that they have to use the title – even though they have access 
to it and it's their right."

Lansbury said she admires Spencer's work.

"I saw her in 'The Help' and thought she was absolutely wonderful, a lovely 
actress," Lansbury said. "So I wish her well, but I wish it wasn't in Murder, 
She Wrote."

Representatives for Spencer didn't respond to an email from the AP seeking 
comment.
