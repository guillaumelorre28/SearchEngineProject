At today's annual Association of Online Publishers' one-day conference a 
number of speakers used the opportunity to weigh-in on industry issues or 
reveal major digital-initiatives.

Duncan Edwards, the chief executive of Hearst-owned publishing company NatMags,
revealed a major ramping up of digital investment 
<http://media.theguardian.com/newmedia/story/0,,2182772,00.html> across its 
portfolio titles that will see the launch of Handbag TV - powered by Brightcove 
- and new-look websites for Cosmopolitan and Bazaar.

In a similar vein Caroline Little, chief executive of Washingtonpost.Newsweek 
Interactive, announced that its newspaper websitewould undergo a relaunch in 
the Spring. <>

Plans include increasing "web 3.0" engagement with new tools and taking 
advantage of mobile, an area she admitted the company had been lagging.

And Peter Bale, the executive producer at MSN, took a swipe at Google News <> 
warning major British newspaper websites that its new content deals could mean 
a dip in web traffic.

Mr Bale made the warning in reference to a Google News deal struck at the end 
of last month with agencies - including Agence-France Presse, Press 
Association, and Associated Press - to scan their news stories and omit from 
search results any duplicated versions of stories from these agencies that 
other news sites host.
