It’s almost a decade since Teeth of the Sea first formed, but that certainly 
hasn’t led to a softening of their sound. Highly Deadly Black Tarantula, their 
fourth album, is as uncompromising as ever – a menacing brew of icy synth 
lines, brutal mechanical rhythms and blistering noise.

From the spidery post-rock guitar lines of opener All My Venom – adorned with 
foreboding drums and bursts of South American brass – you’re instantly made 
aware that this is not music for the faint of heart. Widescreen and atmospheric 
throughout, but with a sense of dread running through its veins, think of it as 
a more malevolent Morricone.
