In 1928, at 18, Belgian gypsy musician Django Reinhardt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/django-reinhardt> lost the use of the third 
and fourth fingers of his left hand in a caravan fire, forcing him to abandon 
both the violin and banjo and concentrate on the guitar, playing solos with 
only his index and second finger. He developed a unique style full of 
vibrato-humming fast runs, piano-like trills and sax-like speed. Reinhardt 
later led the celebrated Quintette du Hot Club de France with violinist 
Stéphane Grappelli, toured the US in 1947 with Duke Ellington, and is regarded 
as Europe's first jazz improvising genius.
