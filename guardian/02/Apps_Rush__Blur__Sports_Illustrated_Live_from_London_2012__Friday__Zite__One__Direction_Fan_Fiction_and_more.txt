One Direction Fan Fiction 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/one-direction-fan-fiction/id541759835?mt=8>

Included half out of sheer disbelief, this really is an iPhone app just for 
fan fiction about boy-band One Direction. I'm not sure how saucy it gets. The 
app is the work of mobile fiction startup Movellas, which has clearly spied a 
trend in the stories being submitted to its main service. The app includes the 
ability to rate and comment on stories, and sign up for updates as they're 
published.

As a former staff writer on Official Dreamcast Magazine in the UK, I have fond 
memories of Fur Fighters on Sega's console. Now it's been revived for iPad, 
with more than 30 levels to romp through as the six animal commandos. Now, can
