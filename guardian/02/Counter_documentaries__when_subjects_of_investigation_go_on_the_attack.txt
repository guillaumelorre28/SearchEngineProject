Recently Louis Theroux <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/louis-theroux>
 revealed that the Church of Scientology is looking to neutralise his 
forthcoming documentary about them by producing their very own film about him. 
In the US there’s a saying that “the best defence is a good offence” and L Ron 
Hubbard, the founder of the religion, was a believer: “Don’t ever defend, 
always attack,” he once instructed his followers.

It’s not surprising then, that such “counter-documentaries” are a staple of 
the Church. They’ve done one on John Sweeney,the Panorama presenter who 
memorably lost his cool <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxqR5NPhtLI> while 
interviewing Scientology’s then chief spokesman; they’ve done one on CNN’s 
Anderson Cooper and they’re likely to do one on any public figure who comes 
even remotely close to criticising them in broad daylight.

One imagines that somewhere in the belly of the Church’s “spiritual 
headquarters” in Florida, a rapid-response unit of counter-documentarians 
waits, ready to defend its honour. At the moment, it’s being kept on its toes: 
HBO recently released a hatchet-jobScientology 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/scientology> documentary, Going Clear, and 
now Theroux, backed up by the producers of Man on Wire and Searching for Sugar 
Man, is having a go at the subject as well.

In the right hands, a film about Theroux would be fascinating. As a presenter, 
he’s uniquely skilled at getting people to bare their souls on camera and, 
despite the usually pally relationships he strikes up, you wonder whether they 
always thank him for it after seeing the TV version of themselves. He’s made so 
many films that most people are familiar with his style but, as he’s always the 
one asking the questions, you realise you don’t actually know that much about 
him.

Judging by their past output, it’s unlikely the Church of Scientology will 
produce a nuanced or fair-minded investigation into Theroux’s methods. The 2007 
counter-documentary about John Sweeney was an odd mixture of personal 
mudslinging and a more schoolmasterly tone that reprimanded the reporter for 
breaking the BBC’s code of conduct. Theirpiece on Anderson 
<http://youtu.be/FHpVDa7WI34> Cooper <> opened with a shameless dog-whistle: 
“Anderson Cooper pulled from his closet and dusted off a year-old media story.”

With such high-profile subjects, will the genre of the counter-documentary 
start to gather steam? With the possible exception ofThe Great Global Warming 
Swindle <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-m09lKtYT4> in 2007, which aimed to 
rebutAn Inconvenient Truth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/15/climatechange.documentary>
, there have been very few comeback movies that have made as big a splash as 
the originals.

Given the enormous financial and reputational damage documentaries can do, 
this is surprising. In recent years, major businesses have been scalped by 
exposé-style docs: in the wake of Blackfish, which revealed the danger of 
keeping killer whales in captivity, SeaWorld’s shares tanked and its CEO 
resigned; the unforgettable grotesquery ofSuper Size Me 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/aug/20/advertising.edinburghfilmfestival2004>
 forced McDonald’s to alter its image as well as its menu. So there’s every 
motive for organisations that have been put in the spotlight to give their side 
of the story.

Just as celebrities endorse products in adverts, one can imagine trustworthy 
presenters being hired to make documentaries by, say, a church or NGO. To work, 
these would need to avoid out-and-out spin (Church of Scientology take note). A 
crude propaganda film, along the lines of Leni Riefenstahl’s infamous Triumph 
of the Will, won’t appeal to a modern audience, but a more balanced piece, done 
by a well-known face, could make a compromised organisation look credible.

Now that documentaries are able to bypass traditional broadcasting media, 
there is nothing stopping more counter-films from being made. They could reach 
large audiences without having to adhere to editorial guidelines. In which 
case, the genre may turn into a wild west of clashing points of view, with each 
investigatory film sparking a counter-film from the accused.

JG Ballard made the point in his novel High Rise that a documentary can be 
used as a weapon. Playing with the idea of a knight storming a castle, he has a 
character, Richard Wilder, climb up a postwar point-block building to confront 
the villain at the top, but instead of wielding a sword, he carries a camera to 
shoot a documentary as he goes.

In Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry, a documentary about the Chinese artist-activist, 
you see him confronting local authorities in the aftermath of an earthquake in 
Sichuan; he is trying to gather the names of each young victim, which have been 
withheld by the state. As he squares up to the police, they film him while his 
supporters film them. It gets a bit meta: multiple stories are being recorded 
which will then do battle to present an official version of events.

 The film team review Ai WeiWei: Never Sorry 
Although counter-documentaries are likely to sometimes come from unpalatable 
places, they may still be valuable, if only because they reveal what has been 
left out of a discussion. Documentaries can take years to shoot, but in the 
editing room they must eventually be whittled down to just an hour or two. 
Theroux was candid about this process in 2008, when he said: “In all 
journalism, you are taking an encounter and packaging it as something else.” 
The making of any film involves leaving out bits that don’t quite fit into the 
neatly parcelled story. For an audience, it’s useful to know what has been cut 
out and what has been chosen to be gift-wrapped. If and when 
counter-documentaries do take off, we should embrace them for the depth of 
coverage they’ll add to any given story.
