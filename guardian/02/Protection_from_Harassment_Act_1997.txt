"An act to make provision for protecting persons from harassment 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1997/ukpga_19970040_en_1#Legislation-Preamble> 
and similar conduct."

MAIN PROVISIONS

• Defines harassment as conduct causing alarm or distress – including speech – 
and must involve the behaviour being repeated on at least two occasions.
• Creates four new criminal offences, including the offence of harassment, a 
summary-only offence that carries a maximum prison term of five years, and 
causing a fear of violence, which carries a maximum term of five years.
• Post conviction, a magistrate can issue a restraining order. Breaching these 
orders is punishable with up to five years' imprisonment.
• Allows a victim of harassment to apply to a civil court for a civil 
injunction to prevent future harassment and for damages.
• Breaching a civil injunction barring an individual from a particular area 
also carries a maximum prison term of five years.
• The original act of parliament has been amended in several important ways by 
theCriminal Justice and Police Act 2001 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/14/criminal-justice-police-act>
 and later by theSerious Organised Crime and Police Act  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2008/dec/16/serious-organised-crime-act>
[Socpa] 2005. The amendments introduce new offences, including harassment of a 
person in their home, and also confer additional powers on the police to issue 
directions for the purpose of stopping such harassment.
• These powers make it an offence for a person subject to a direction to 
return to the vicinity of the premises within three months for the purposes of 
representing to, or persuading, the resident or another that they should not do 
something they are entitled to do, or that they should do something they are 
not obliged to do (by amending the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, 
Section 42 (7)).
• The Criminal Justice and Police Act also extends the Protection From 
Harassment Act to cover harassment of two or more people who are connected (eg 
employees of the same company) even if each individual is harassed on only one 
occasion.

BACKGROUND
 Act's Progress: Protection from Harassment 
 A number of pressure groups were responsible for the introduction of 
Britain's first anti-stalking laws, including the National Anti-Stalking and 
Harassment campaign led by Evonne Von Heussen. Von Heussen founded the National 
Anti-Stalking and Harassment Support Association (Nash) in 1993 and immediately 
began a public campaign to get government to offer the victims of harassment 
greater protection. Her campaign was born out of bitter personal experience; 
she was stalked for 17 years.

A personal safety charity, the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, also campaigned on the 
issue <http://www.rjerrard.co.uk/law/tottel/tottel.html>, following the case of 
Tracey Morgan <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/apr/16/ukcrime.weekend7>. 

Over time, the campaign garnered the support of the Association of Chief 
Police Officers (ACPO) and the Police Federation, lobbied MPs and in 1996, the 
Labour MP Janet Anderson made an attempt to introduce ananti-stalking bill 
<http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:01nMJimHU4YJ:www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960306/debtext/60306-30.htm+%22That+leave+be+given+to+bring+in+a+Bill+to+make+provision+for+a+new+criminal+offence+of+stalking+and+for+a+prohibitory+order+with+criminal+sanctions+against+stalking%3B+and+for+related+purposes.%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk&client=firefox-a>
 using the 10 minute rule. Her bill was dismissed by the Conservative 
government as unworkable but the home secretary, Michael Howard, recognised the 
need for anti-stalking laws. In late 1996 the government introduced an act that 
incorporated many of Anderson's suggestions.

Amendments to the act made by the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 and the 
Serious Organised Crime and Police Act were designed to target radical animal 
rights activists campaigning to closeHuntingdon Life Sciences 
<http://www.huntingdon.com/>, the controversial drug testing company. These 
amendments created a new criminal offence torestrict protest 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3984711,00.html> outside 
residential premises.

The changes to the act made by section 125 of SOCPA allow companies to seek 
injunctions to prevent protests – they must only show that someone feels "
alarmed or distressed 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/feb/22/ukcrime.uk>" by the protesters. 

CRITICISM

Although the act was designed to protect people from stalkers, in recent years 
the act has been widely criticised as being a weapon for corporations against 
peaceful protesters to stifle legitimate protest. Companies have used the act 
to apply for very broad injunctions to prevent any sort of protest against 
them. These injunctions can be granted not just against an individual or a 
specified group but also against anyone with notice of the injunction.

The act has been used to shut down protests against militarism and climate 
change. The Guardian columnist George Monbiot argues that it criminalises 
protest, claiming the legislationblurs the distinction 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/feb/05/anti-stalking-liberty-central>
 between civil and criminal offences. The victim of the course of conduct may 
take a civil claim to the high court. On the basis of far less evidence than a 
criminal case requires, the court can grant an injunction against the 
defendant. If the defendant then breaks that injunction – by continuing to talk 
to the people he is seeking to dissuade, or to march, picket or protest – he 
then commits a criminal offence carrying up tofive years' imprisonment 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/mar/06/comment.politics>.

In the most infamous case, the British Airports Authority (BAA) applied for 
the "mother of all injunctions 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/aug/07/comment.business>" against 
AirportWatch, an umbrella organisation of groups including the National Trust, 
the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Woodland Trust. 
Had BBA been granted the injunction, the five million members of these 
charities could have been banned from Heathrow airport and its surrounding 
areas as well as transport links to Heathrow including the Piccadilly line, 
large sections of the M4 and land surrounding Heathrow.

Liberty, the civil rights group, called it an example of a "dangerous and 
undemocratic trend" by large companies to seek to limit the right to protest.

Women's rights campaigners described the trend as a legal hijacking, arguing 
that lawsdesigned to protect women 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/13/gender.prisonsandprobation> were 
been commandeered to stifle protest and undermine other rights.

In January 2009, Edward Countryman 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/07/harassment-law>, whose 
wife Yvonne Powell-Von Heussen was instrumental in drafting the act, wrote in 
the Guardian that "the act is being used to stifle dissent seems indubitable". 
He went on to say thatparties responsible for the act 
<http://www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/harassment-and-interference-with-contracts.html>
 did not intend it to be used to "protect faceless entities from the normal 
processes of politics and society."
