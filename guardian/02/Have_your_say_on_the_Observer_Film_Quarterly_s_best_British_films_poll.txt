We've had a terrific response to our provocative British issue of Observer 
Film Quarterly.

Firstly, that list 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/gallery/2009/aug/30/best-british-films-25-years>
 of the25 best British films of the last 25 years 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/aug/30/best-british-films-poll> - well, it 
sparked debate in the pubs and foyers of the nation. I've had people shaking 
heads at me about the inclusion of Four Weddings and a Funeral, wailing about 
the exclusion of The Talented Mr Ripley. What did we forget, overlook or get 
wrong? We put Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and Terence Davies in there - but did we 
sometimes pick the wrong films from the right artists? Should Atonement have 
made the grade?

I'm pleased to report that almost as much nodding, cheering and booing was 
triggered bymy own essay on the state of British film 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/aug/30/jason-solomons-british-film-industry>
. The film-makers' web site www.shootingpeople.org and various Facebook pages 
have been thrumming with suggestions and alternatives, all prompted by my 
nagging concerns for the future of British film.

I think we may have started something here, so do join in the debate, now 
available here.Here's a reminder of our top choices

. We look forward to hearing what you have to sayâ€¦
