Denis O'Brien is believed to have made a revised proposal to the bondholders of
Independent News & Media (INM) as an alternative to the one proposed by chief 
executiveGavin O'Reilly.

O'Brien is eager to avoid existing shareholders, such as himself, having their 
stakes diluted under the O'Reilly deal.

His revised plan is unclear, but it's understood to include an improved 
package for bondholders.

One source said the latest approach, which would give O'Brien majority control 
of INM, included a proposal to sell the South African outdoor advertising 
business that O'Brien has previously opposed.

There is no word of the fate of The Independent and Independent on Sunday in 
the leaks about the plan. O'Brien has always said they should be sold off or 
closed.

O'Brien's move comes after O'Reilly won board support for his plan to settle 
an overdue €200m bond in full.

At a speaking engagement in Dublin yesterday, O'Brien said O'Reilly's 
restructuring plan would make it a "zombie" company. He also said INM was "an 
old-style company that has been run into the ground".

The O'Reilly deal with bondholders involves a debt-for-equity swap with and a 
follow-on rights issue. Both O'Brien, who owns 26.14% of the group, andTony 
O'Reilly, father of the chief executive, will therefore see their stakes in INM 
significantly diluted.

Perhaps I'll hear more from O'Brien today because he and I are both speaking 
at theConnacht Tribune centenary journalism conference in Galway 
<http://www.nuigalway.ie/news/main_press.php?p_id=1110>. 

O'Brien's Communicorp Group <http://www.communicorp.ie/> owns several radio 
stations in Ireland and has a portfolio of media interests in seven other 
European countries.

But everyone there will want to know more about his battle with the O'Reillys 
and, on recent form, he is unlikely to button his lips.

The latest issue of Dublin's satirical magazine, The Phoenix 
<http://www.thephoenix.ie/phoenix/welcome.do>, carries a critical two-page 
profile of O'Brien, pointing out that he has paid €510m (£466m) for his INM 
stake plus €5m in stamp duty.

For that total outlay of €515m he is now sitting on a stake worth just €58m 
(£53m). It concludes that "2010 could be a very bad year forDenis O'Brien 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/denis-o-brien>."

I'll try to ask him about that later today.
