There‚Äôs no getting around it now. The major storyline of the 2016 NFL season 
at the midway point is this:the NFL is bad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/28/nfl-football-tv-ratings-drop>
. Even one of the league‚Äôs paid PR flacks tacitly acknowledged the negative 
feeling around the product by tweeting out a passive-aggressive ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù 
hashtag after Week 8 happened to deliver a handful of entertaining games.

So while we all can admit the NFL hasn‚Äôt been good this season, it also isn‚Äôt 
all bad. Even the darkest clouds have silver linings, right? (I don‚Äôt know if 
that is actually true, I‚Äôm not trained in meteorology or motivational cat 
posters, but it sounds like something you say to a league that‚Äôs hurting.) 
Outside of still dominating all competitors in TV ratings and revenues ‚Äì which, 
let‚Äôs admit, are pretty noteworthy accomplishments! ‚Äì theNFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> in 2016 has a few good things going for 
it.

1) The future of quarterbacking may be OK

If Tom Brady grows old one day and the NFL doesn‚Äôt stop defensive players from 
hitting Cam Newton in the head 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/30/cam-newton-quarterback-hits-alex-smith-nfl>
 and the Seahawks never bother to get around to providing Russell Wilson with 
some capable offensive linemen, the league is going to need some new marquee 
players at the sport‚Äôs most important position. Thankfully, it‚Äôs looking more 
and more like there is some legitimate young QB talent in Roger Goodell‚Äôs NFL. 
Cowboys rookie Dak Prescott has helped Dallas get to 6-1 in Tony Romo‚Äôs absence 
and, if he‚Äôs not the short-term answer at the position, is most definitely the 
quarterback of the future forAmerica‚Äôs Typically Underachieving Team 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/dallas-cowboys-nfl-rich-profitable>
. A winning Cowboys franchise is good even for the millions who root against 
them: it keeps the fires of hate burning strong.¬†

While Prescott has been eased into the league behind Dallas‚Äô standout line and 
skilled players around him in Ezekiel Elliott, Dez Bryant and Jason Witten, his 
NFC East rookie counterpart Carson Wentz has exceeded expectations with a 
patchwork line and subrate skill position talent. Wentz‚Äôs production has dipped 
in recent weeks, but as rookie seasons for quarterbacks go ‚Äì especially for 
those plucked out of the FCS ‚Äì there‚Äôs zero reason Eagles fans should not be 
excited.¬†

Mediocrity on turf: the NFL is stumbling, but will it recover?

Prescott and Wentz are still mostly about potential, but Derek Carr of the 
Raiders is already unquestionably one of the NFL‚Äôs top 10 quarterbacks at age 
25 and in the MVP discussion. His 513 yards and 4 TDs Sunday knocked off the 
Bucs in overtime and kept Oakland on pace with Denver in the AFC West at 6-2. 
We could be at the start of an era in which the Raiders and Cowboys are both 
good simultaneously for the first time since the mid-1970s. You can bet that 
would raise some interest in the NFL. In fact, you will actually be able to bet 
on that when the Raiders move to Las Vegas.

2) Bills fans

In a world gone mad, Bills fans are going with it and staking their claim as 
the most depraved fanbase in the modern NFL.Sunday‚Äôs on-field dildo

 ‚Äì hurled with accuracy not seen in Buffalo since Jim Kelly‚Äôs heyday ‚Äì was the 
logical next step for a fanbase that hasdestroyed every folding table in 
upstate New York <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyPStAI_prA> and, at their 
last home game two weeks ago, earned national attention forusing human buttocks 
as a beer luge

. It‚Äôs very ... entertaining? And also somewhat horrifying based on the fact 
that Colin Kaepernickdidn‚Äôt receive an especially welcoming

response from some of the Bills Mafia when he came to town in Week 6. It‚Äôs 
exactly the kind of stuff you expect to occur around a franchise thatchampions 
Rex Ryan and Richie Incognito 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/19/rex-ryan-donald-trump-new-york-primary>
. So where is the positive? It‚Äôs this: every Bills home game now provides an 
update on the exact state of American societal decline. Thanks for the status 
checks, Buffalo!

3) No daily fantasy ads

It‚Äôs hard to remember way back to the autumn of 2015. Millennials were making 
fortunes on Vine, Donald Trump was a punchline that no one thought would get 
anywhere near the presidency, and every second on every TV sports network in 
America was inundated by FanDuel and DraftKings promotions. It was a simpler 
time. But if you can remember that long ago era, you‚Äôll recall that instead of 
complaining about the quality of football, everyone was bitching about the 
unrelenting daily fantasy ads that came during every commercial break. Now, 
thanks to investigations across the country andmounting cash flow problems 
<http://www.businessinsider.com/draftkings-and-fanduel-reportedly-running-out-of-cash-and-cant-make-payments-2016-10>
, the absence of daily fantasy ads have changed our Sunday and made thema 
lllllllllot less annoying <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnvTXsqLxoE>. Be 
grateful.

4) Parity

I say parity. You say mediocrity. Most want to call the whole season off. But 
before we do that, realize that this awful NFL season is probably going to have 
monster ratings in December when three-quarters of the nation‚Äôs NFL fans have 
their favorite team still in playoff contention. As it stands now, we‚Äôre 
halfway through the regular season and of the 32 teams in the NFL, only four 
have nothing to play for: the Browns, Bears, 49ers and ‚Äì because they‚Äôve 
essentially won their division already ‚Äì the Patriots. The fortunes of 28 teams 
still hang in the balance, including even the awful Jaguars and Colts because 
just getting to eight wins could take the AFC South. There likely won‚Äôt be much 
more separation either. The supposedly Super Bowl-contending Seahawks just lost 
to the Saints. The Steelers have already lost to the Eagles and Dolphins. As 
the saying goes: on any given Sunday, a bad team can beat a 
slightly-better-than-bad team.

So while we complain about all the bad match-ups now and the TV ratings dip, 
we‚Äôll undoubtedly gobble up that Week 16 Thursday night game between a 6-8 
Giants team and a 6-8 Eagles team with wildcard contention on the line. What 
are your better options on 22 December? The Famous Idaho Potato Bowl? Talking 
to your relatives visiting for the holidays? No, it will be Ben McAdoo v Doug 
Pederson in a battle of wits on national TV and we‚Äôll watch it and whatever 
other mediocriparity the NFL puts on our holiday plates. We might not be served 
a lot of good football, but we‚Äôll have all the consequential football we could 
ever want.

5) Receivers

Flags, replays, commercials, Goodell, player protests that don‚Äôt follow your 
particular political leanings: there are undoubtedly many legitimate reasons to 
be down on the current NFL. It is also true that this is the golden age of 
receivers. Julio Jones, AJ Green, Antonio Brown, Odell Beckham, Amari Cooper, 
Rob Gronkowski, Larry Fitzgerald and on it goes, meaning there is very rarely a 
single NFL game that goes by without at least one amazing catch that makes you 
want to jump up and yell. Just don‚Äôt jump up and yell if you‚Äôre the actual 
player who has pulled off the amazing catch. You‚Äôll get a flag.
