The Creation Records founder, Alan McGee, has been told by police 
investigating phone hacking that he may have been targeted by theNews of the 
World <https://www.theguardian.com/media/newsoftheworld>.

In an article for Huffington Post UK 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/alan/phone-hacking-news-of-the-world-now-im-involved_b_1078860.html?ref=tw>
, McGee said he will sue the now-defunct paper's publisher, News International, 
if the Metropolitan police confirms there is evidence that his phone was hacked.

News International is already facing more than 60 civil cases for invasion of 
privacy over alleged phone hacking by the News of the World.

"I recently returned to Wales after a trip to London and as I stepped foot 
through the door, I was greeted with a letter from the Metropolitan police in 
London," the formerOasis <https://www.theguardian.com/music/oasis> and Primal 
Scream manager said.

"It turns out that my name has popped up in the News of the World 
phone-hacking case and they are investigating as I type."

He added: "Joking aside, if the police confirm that I have indeed been hacked, 
and even though this will have been years ago, I will still sue. I couldn't 
abide NoW, so I won't be losing sleep in suing them."

McGee did not reveal exactly when his phone was allegedly targeted by the News 
of the World, but said that during the period the police were talking about his 
voicemail would have been full of "hour-long Courtney Love rambles from LA 
about her new songs at 5am UK time".

McGee signed Courtney Love to his post-Creation record label, Poptones 
Records, in early 2000, before the label closed in 2007.

He added: "In a couple of weeks, I'll be taking a trip to see the cops in 
Putney about the News of the World bollocks and then, to really start taking a 
walk on the wild side, our book project where we come clean on my bizarre 
little life in book form with the gentleman and scholar – Mr Harry Mulligan."

Detectives from Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard's phone-hacking 
investigation, are in the process of notifying people whose names are among 
some 11,000 documents seized from former News of the World private investigator 
Glenn Mulcaire.

Last week the Met confirmed that the number of possible victims named in 
Mulcaire's note is now close to 5,800 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/03/phone-hacking-victims-police> – 
2,000 more than previously identified.

Mulcaire worked for the News of the World from about 2000 until mid-2006, when 
he was arrested and later jailed for hacking into the voicemails of members of 
the royal household.
