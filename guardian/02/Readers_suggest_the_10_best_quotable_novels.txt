Joseph Heller coined a term for absurd contradictions in Catch-22, the novel 
most missed from last week’s list. “There’s a catch,” says Yossarianspal, 
“Catch-22 doesn’t get a mention.” The term has entered common parlance and 
would win Heller recognition on its own, but Catch-22 is replete with other 
oft-quoted phrases. Mattd72 picks the famous description of Major Major: “Some 
men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have 
mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three.”

Mark Twain worked to capture the spoken voice in all his books, but nowhere 
did he manage it so gracefully as in Huckleberry Finn, written entirely in the 
regional vernacular of a teenager from the backwoods of Missouri. 
Philbertdelamorgue remembers the passage where Huck relates a conversation 
between two pesky conmen: “Hain’t we got all the fools in town on our side? And 
ain’t that a big enough majority in any town?”

An accomplished parody by NewZealandTown draws attention to an important 
ommission: “Viddy this bezoomy list. Why if only it included a real horrorshow 
novel, I’d be creeching from the roof.” The masterful linguistic inventions in 
A Clockwork Orange created a unique list of quotable phrases that saw almost 
excessive take-up in the 70s and 80s. From “droogs” to “horrorshow” to “o my 
brothers”, the slurs of Alex and his friends have been kicked around and 
printed on to T-shirts for as long as most of us can remember.

His only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray is more sobering than Oscar Wilde’s 
other works. The hubristic decline of the novel’s hero casts a mournful shadow 
over Wilde’s writing, which instead becomes the source of near-proverbial 
truth-telling: “to define is to limit”; “nowadays people know the price of 
everything and the value of nothing”. Jamesdrodger remembers a horribly ironic 
quote from one of Dorian’s ardent admirers: “The curves of your lips rewrite 
history”.

JackSlater and munquinight both nominate the same quote from fantasy novel The 
Princess Bride: “Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare 
to die.” The book’s no-nonsense tone has been a hit with teenagers and adults, 
and it has inspired a film, orchestral suite and computer game. Last year it 
was even turned into a board game, The Princess Bride Prepare To Die!. In it 
players pick cards to construct sentences that mimic Montoya’s line above (eg. 
“Hello, my name is James Blunt. You dissed my upbringing. Prepare to die”).

Tolstoy’s weighty exploration of familial love charts the imaginative 
withdrawal of an aristocratic woman faced with unbearable pain and loss. Anna’s 
isolation produces philosophical reflections that are often quoted as universal 
wisdom, but work best when taken in context. NorthUist77 remembers the novel’s 
famous opening line: “All happy familes are alike; each unhappy family is 
unhappy in its own way.”

One of the single most quoted lines from a novel, and the inspiration behind 
Katy Perry’s No 1 single Firework, this quotation from Jack Kerouac’s On the 
Road stands alone as a beautiful piece of writing: “The only people for me are 
the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, 
desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a 
commonplace thing but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles 
exploding like spiders across the stars.” Thank you to Kerocusack for pointing 
it out.

Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita is responsible for some singly breathtaking 
descriptions, not least of all the famous opening line: “Lolita, light of my 
life, fire of my loins.” Dragonluck selects a more comprehensive example of the 
tortured contradictions that produce the novel’s beauty: “Despite our tiffs, 
despite her nastiness, despite all the fuss and faces she made, and the 
vulgarity, and the danger, and the horrible hopelessness of it all, I still 
dwelled deep in my elected paradise – a paradise whose skies were the colour of 
hell-flames – but still a paradise.”

Not always thought of as the most quotable or succinct book, The Leopard is 
rightly recognised by HouseofTiles for the insightfulness of quotations we do 
remember – for example, “If we want things to stay as they are, things will 
have to change.” As the Salina family are faced with upheaval in 19th-century 
Sicily, Lampedusa gives his reader plenty of bitter food for thought: “Of 
course, love: flames for a year, ashes for 30.”
