StubHub: ‘Your Tickets Out’ (starts at 00:04) - US

Carpe diem, as they say. Don’t sit at home moping about what could have been 
when you could be at a gig or a sports event that you’ll be able to talk about 
for the rest of your life! Martin Werner convincingly brings this proposition 
to life with energy and humour.

Royal Danish Theatre: ‘Creation’ (starts at 01:08) - Denmark

Handel’s Sarabande forms the backbone of this intriguing advert for the Royal 
Danish Theatre. The music incorporates sounds originating from a vast array of 
theatre-related activities: vocal exercises, costume-making and dance practice 
all contribute their unique aural texture to remind us that a performance is 
about far more than the actors on stage.

League Against Cruel Sports: ‘Silent Enemy’ (starts at 02:47) - UK

Graphic depictions of animal cruelty and neglect tend to make us avert our 
eyes rather than face the unpalatable truths they convey. So it’s no easy feat 
to successfully serve up such messages in ways we can swallow – but that’s 
exactly what this spot for the League Against Cruel Sports manages. Swapping a 
wild animal for a human animal, it demonstrates how snaring kills... and leaves 
us in no doubt we should back the campaign calling for snares to be made 
illegal.
Director: Paul Murphy


Bepanthen: ‘10th Month’ (starts at 04:38) - UK

This extremely moving film for Bepanthen takes a look at the first month of 
motherhood and provides some pretty startling insights which are cleverly 
underlined by the way it’s presented. The first half is as baby-centric as 
these mothers have come to expect. Close-up photography disembodies the voices 
of mothers speaking different languages and they are effectively – if 
affectionately – reduced to the nurturing machines their babies require. But 
they are stopped short when asked how they are doing.
