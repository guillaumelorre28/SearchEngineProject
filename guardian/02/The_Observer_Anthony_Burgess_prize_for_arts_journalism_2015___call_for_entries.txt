The aim of the competition is to reward new and exciting writing on arts and 
cultural subjects. The winning piece will be a 1,500-word review of a book, 
film, a concert, a ballet, a stage play or a TV show. The winner will receive 
£2,000 and the opportunity to have their work published in print and online 
editions of theObserver and on the International Anthony Burgess Foundation 
website. You can read more about Burgess’s journalism in the Observer here

When choosing the winner, the judges will be looking for imaginative, 
original, and thought-provoking arts journalism that would be suitable for 
publication in the Observer. They will be looking for emerging talent, 
innovative approaches and writing from outside the mainstream, and they are 
especially keen to read entries from those who have not previously had work 
published by major media organisations. They are also, as William Boyd 
commented while judging the 2012 entries, looking for “some Burgessian fizz and 
crackle and a bit of well-displayed erudition”.

The prize will be judged by a panel chaired by Kate Mosse and including Ruth 
Scurr, Alexandra Harris, as well as Robert McCrum from the Observer and Will 
Carr from the Burgess Foundation.
