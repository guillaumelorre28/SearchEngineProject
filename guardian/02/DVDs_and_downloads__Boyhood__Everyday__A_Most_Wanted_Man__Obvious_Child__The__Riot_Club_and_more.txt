Thursday brought us this year’s Oscar nominations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/oscar-nominations-2015-boyhood-clips-birdmans-wings-birdman-soars-over-boyhood-selma-steals-a-march-on-boyhood-and-birdman>
, kicking off the second phase of a campaign season that has already been at a 
full simmer since – believe it or not – September. Yes, a single night of 
celebrity back-patting has evolved into a six-month industry in Hollywood – a 
wearisome process that at least seems more worthwhile when thepresumed 
frontrunner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/08/boyhood-oscars-favourite-new-york-la-boston-critics-circle-awards-richard-linklater>
is as marvellous asBoyhood (Universal, 15). Richard Linklater’s sprawling, 
sweet-and-sour chronicle of a life in progress has chugged along insouciantly 
since the summer, raking in prizes as sundry supposed awards magnets have 
fallen.

You know the trick by now. Working annually with the same quartet of actors 
over 12 years, Linklater’s film examines the shifting makeup and mood of an 
ordinary Texan family, concentrating its attention on youngest son Mason (Ellar 
Coltrane) – who enters the film a bright, unusual six-year-old, and exits a 
still-precocious college freshman.Boyhood’s (admittedly few) detractors have 
attributed its success thus far to stunt value, but the film is novel rather 
than a novelty. As in hisBefore Sunrise trilogy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/17/before-midnight-john-patterson>, 
Linklater creases his time-lapse gimmick with such loose, humane humour and 
recognisably specific surges of feeling that we barely notice the practical 
magic he’s pulling off before our eyes. Everything and nothing happens across 
nearly three hours of changing circumstances, relationships and hairdos; it’s 
the tension between such progress and the fundamental constant of a person’s 
character that makesBoyhood languidly riveting.

For those bowled over by Boyhood’s unassuming experiment, Michael 
Winterbottom’s undervaluedEveryday is essential companion viewing, comparable 
if more compact in form – and happilyavailable to stream on 4OD 
<http://www.channel4.com/programmes/everyday/on-demand>. Filmed over five 
years, with a peak-form Shirley Henderson and John Simm intricately tracking 
the psychological evolution of hard-bitten spouses separated by a prison 
sentence, it’s among the most conceptually and emotionally complete efforts in 
Winterbottom’s extensive oeuvre.

If the machinations of awards season have thus far done well in bringing 
Boyhood to the fore, they’ve been inexplicably remiss in other areas: I remain 
surprised that the seemingly irresistible combination of posthumous sentiment 
and extraordinary merit has reaped no recognition whatsoever for the late 
Philip Seymour Hoffman’s wry, crackling, finally gut-twisting performance as a 
curdled German espionage agent in Anton Corbijn’s superbA Most Wanted Man (E1, 
15) – a John Le Carré adaptation to stand proudly alongside the more celebrated
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tinker-tailor-soldier-spy> in its crisp, 
gruff intelligence.

Meanwhile, in a best actress race declared the sparsest in years 
<http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/2015-oscars-academy-awards-best-actress-new-york-critics/>
 by many pundits, the invisibility of formerSaturday Night Live star Jenny 
Slate – a fizzing, fiercely fast-witted revelation in Gillian Robespierre’s
Obvious Child(Koch Media, 15) – shows up voters’ ongoing resistance to comedy. 
Or at least to romantic comedy as blithely progressive and freshly feminist as 
this one, in which a shambolic standup comedian’s life is brought into focus by 
an unwanted pregnancy – though not in the tidily conservative way you might 
expect. Wise and even-handed in parsing the choices of contemporary womanhood, 
it’s a milestone too full of raucous gags to ever announce itself as one.

The week’s other releases have been more justifiably ignored in the trophy run 
– though if anyone wants to hand a most well-sculpted ensemble prize to The 
Riot Club (Universal, 15), Lone Scherfig’s diverting but insight-challenged 
portrait of elite Oxford hedonism, I shan’t stand in their way. Liam Neeson is 
angling for some kind of consistent-performance certificate inA Walk Among the 
Tombstones(E1, 15), the umpteenth scowling, storm-hued revenge thriller of his 
later career; by degrees, it’s more tasteful and articulate thanNon-Stop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/27/non-stop-review-liam-neeson> or 
Unknown <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140395/unknown>, but rather 
less fun. Still, he’s giving it more gusto than two of his contemporaries this 
week, Academy Award winners both. InThe Giver (Ev, 12), Phillip Noyce’s 
crushingly inert adaptation of Lois Lowry’s gleaming children’s sci-fi classic, 
Jeff Bridges plays his every scene as if recently roused from a nap; Jeremy 
Irons, on the other hand, appears on the brink of falling into one throughout
Night Train to Lisbon (Bulldog, 12), a hilariously flaccid queen of 
Europuddings that traces a fusty classics professor’s journey of moderate 
self-discovery with all the conviction of cold caldo verde. Congratulations to 
this year’s Oscar class – but consider these films a cautionary tale.
