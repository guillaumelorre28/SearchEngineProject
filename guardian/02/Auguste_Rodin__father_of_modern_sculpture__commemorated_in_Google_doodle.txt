Google's latest doodle marks the 172nd birthday of Auguste Rodin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/auguste-rodin>, the French sculptor 
whose best known works included The Thinker and The Kiss.

Rodin, who was born in 1840 and died in 1917, is widely considered the father 
of modern sculpture. The child of a working-class Parisian family, he was 
schooled traditionally and took a craftsman-like approach to his work but was 
also a figure who courted controversy in his lifetime.

When The Kiss, which depicts an embrace between a naked man and a woman, went 
on display in a gallery in East Sussex at the beginning of the last century, it 
caused such an outcry that it was removed from public view.

Other works by the sculptor, who was carried on producing pieces almost until 
his death, include The Gates of Hell, a monumental sculpture which was 
commissioned in 1880 and which he worked on for 37 years. The Gates of Hell was 
the inspiration for a new dance productionthat opened at Sadler's Wells in 
London last month

The Kiss has also proved to be a huge

hit over the past year in Kent after it was loaned by the Tate to Margate's 
Turner Contemporary year.
