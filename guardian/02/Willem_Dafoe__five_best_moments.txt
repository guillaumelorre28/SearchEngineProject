Willem Dafoe <https://www.theguardian.com/film/willem-dafoe> stands out as a 
champion villain. If it’s a curling lip, a leer or a chilling laugh you’re 
after, he’s got more than enough acting ammunition in his arsenal.

Anton Corbijn’s A Most Wanted Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/a-most-wanted-man-review-philip-seymour-hoffman>
, out in UK cinemas this week and starring Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his 
last roles, sees Dafoe delicately play a complex character toeing the line 
between good and evil, and inspired us to look back at some of his greatest 
past performances.

Wild at Heart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,544593,00.html>

With David Lynch <https://www.theguardian.com/film/davidlynch> behind the 
camera, Dafoe took on one of his early bad-guy roles. He played Bobby Peru, a 
slimy and creepy gangster terrorising Nicolas Cage’s Sailor Ripley and Laura 
Dern’s Lula Fortune, with memorable menace.

Antichrist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/24/antichrist-lars-von-trier-review>

Though Charlotte Gainsbourg bagged the Cannes film festival award for best 
actress in this horrifying 2009 Lars von Trier creation, Dafoe’s performance 
shone, too.Critics jeered and laughed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/18/cannes-film-festival-antichrist-lars-von-trier>
 at the film’s talking fox and booed during its closing credits, but Dafoe 
pulled off a captivating, disturbing and impactful role as Gainsbourg’s 
husband. Dafoespoke of <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g86fSQiLw4> the film’s 
extreme “gross-outs” as a device to make viewers connect to the characters, and 
not just as pieces of gratuitous gore.

Platoon <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091763/>

Dafoe was cast against type as a compassionate good guy, and not a villain, in 
his Oscar-nominated performance as Sgt Elias. Platoon received high praise from 
critics, bolstered by Vietnam war veteran and director Oliver Stone’s personal 
experience adding to the film’s gravitas and authenticity.

Spider-Man <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jun/14/1>

Dafoe occupied familiar dastardly territory in Sam Raimi’s 2002 superhero 
film. As the Green Goblin, or Norman Osborn to his nan, he mustered up a 
deliciously villainous cackle and sneer – it was over-the-top Hollywood baddie 
fare, but Dafoe added a level of nuance to the role.

The Grand Budapest Hotel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/06/the-grand-budapest-hotel-wes-anderson-review>

Dafoe barely said a word as JG Jopling, in Wes Anderson’s 2014 stylised caper, 
but played his murderous role with truly Anderson-like precision. His 
bloodthirsty performance stood out in a film (typically) bursting at the seams 
with fleeting cameos by secondary characters.
