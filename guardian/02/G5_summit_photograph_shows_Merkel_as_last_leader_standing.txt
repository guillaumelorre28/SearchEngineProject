Reasons vary for the western world’s political convulsions, but one photograph 
leaves little doubt how quickly its ruling elite has changed beyond recognition.

The smiling faces at a summit in Hanover in April

 represented the four largest European economies and a United States then 
confident of political continuity. But theresignation

 of the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, on Monday now means all but one 
of the G5 leaders will leave office under very different circumstances.

David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> was perhaps 
the clearest casualty of a populist rebellion against the establishment, driven 
from office after losing a referendum that became a surprise plebiscite on the 
status quo. Barack Obama was leaving office in January whatever happened but 
risks seeing his legacy destroyed by a similar backlash that elected Donald 
Trump.

Like Renzi

, François Hollande said last week that he wouldnot seek re-election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/01/francois-hollande-not-seek-second-term-president-france>
 as French president for more complex reasons – not least the fact that he 
would probably lose by a landslide – but both leaders are struggling to 
convince economically struggling electorates wary of incumbents.

Only Angela Merkel, who announced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/20/angela-merkel-expected-stand-for-re-election-germany>
 last month that she would seek a fourth term as German chancellor, could be at 
a future meeting of the G5.
