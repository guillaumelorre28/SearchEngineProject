December is the season of list-making and Top 10 compiling, but when I mention 
this to other critics, it's been getting winces and shrugs and mutterings that 
2010 hasn't been a vintage year. I'm not so sure about that. It's true that the 
huge arthouse hits like The White Ribbon and A Prophet are now a very distant 
memory — A Prophet in fact was released at the very beginning of this year, but 
has been so extensively discussed, that I don't mention it below. Some huge 
crowd-pleasers, like Danny Boyle's127 Hours 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/137863/127-hours>, Tom Hooper's The 
King's Speech <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/137858/king-s-speech> and 
Darren Aronofsky'sBlack Swan 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/137726/black-swan>, haven't yet had a 
full release and neither has Kelly Reichardt's western,Meek's Cutoff 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/138470/meek-s-cutoff>. These things may 
combine to produce the impression that 2010 is in itself a thin year. But this 
wouldn't be true.

This year we have seen UK releases of three stunning films by three of the 
world's most talented directors: Gaspar Noé, Apichatpong Weerasethakul and 
Lucrecia Martel. Their work seems to me to be pushing at the limits of what 
cinema can do. Mike Leigh gave us another gem in what is becoming a gloriously 
fruitful and accomplished "late period". There were brilliant and very 
different animations in the form ofToy Story 3 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/137307/toy-story-3> and The Illusionist 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/136866/illusionist>. And there were two 
instant pop-culture classics in Matthew Vaughn's crackingly goodKick-Ass 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/135252/kick-ass> and Adam McKay's comedy 
The Other Guys <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/137862/other-guys>. (My 
double thumbs-up for these two last films caused some disapproval in certain 
quarters, and yet I have to say my only regret is that I couldn't have given 
them six or seven stars each.) AndThe Social Network 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/137709/social-network> was mainstream 
American film-making of the smartest, most sophisticated and yet accessible 
sort.

So anyway, instead of the conventional Top 10, I have compiled an Oscar-style 
nomination list, which, in keeping with the new AMPAS directive about the best 
film list, has 10 nominations in each category: best film, best director, best 
documentary, best actor, best supporting actor, best actress and best 
supporting actress. It applies to films which have had a UK release, however 
limited. (There has inevitably been a little doubling-up in the first two 
categories.) Commenters are invited to vote — early and often — in each 
category, or of course to make alternative suggestions. The winners will be 
announced just before Christmas, though a massive ceremony at theBFI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/bfi> Southbank won't be possible.

And the nominees are…..
