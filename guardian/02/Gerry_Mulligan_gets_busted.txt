Gerry Mulligan was busted for heroin at his north Hollywood home by the 
notorious John O'Grady, head of the local narcotics squad, on 13 April 1953. 
Mulligan was young, white, seemingly clean-cut, and leading a quartet – his own 
baritone saxophone, Chet Baker's trumpet, bass and drums. The band had soared 
to popularity thanks to its streamlined, weightless, improvised counterpoint 
between the two horns.

But Mulligan's arrest showed how far the heroin epidemic had penetrated the 
jazz world. Evidence suggests that the mafia targeted jazz musicians as a 
suitable market in the 1940s, with outstanding success. Charlie Parker, who 
invented a new way to play jazz, was a notorious junkie – his younger disciples 
reasoned that if he took it, there must be something to it. Perhaps it provided 
a temporary escape from the cultural and social insecurity caused by a lack of 
proper acknowledgment for what they believed to be work of significant 
intellectual value.

Mulligan served jail time, cleaned up and rebuilt his career, but those of 
countless others were permanently blighted or prematurely extinguished by drugs.
