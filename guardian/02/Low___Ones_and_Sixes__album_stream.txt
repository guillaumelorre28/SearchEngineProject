For more than two decades, Low <https://www.theguardian.com/music/low> have 
experimented with the intricacies and finer details of music. In a musical 
landscape of overindulgence and audio compression, it certainly makes a change 
to hear a band for whom every strum and drumbeat sounds delicately poised.

Ones and Sixes is their 11th album and has been garnering impressive reviews 
already: Mojo said it was “one of the most impressive albums of their career, 
and still feels like their best work is ahead of them.”

At times, the album feels as hushed and unobtrusive as ever, but at others Low 
retain the power to surprise. What Part of Me, for instance, is a wonderful, 
chugging pop song that shines brightly over a metronomic beat.
