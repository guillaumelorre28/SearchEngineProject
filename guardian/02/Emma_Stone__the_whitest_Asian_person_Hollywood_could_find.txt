Name: Emma Stone <https://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-stone>

Age: 26

Appearance: Blonde, freckled.

The Hollywood actor, right? Don’t I know her from such films as Superbad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/superbad>, Zombieland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/09/zombieland-review>, The Amazing 
Spider-Man <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140156/spider-man-reboot>, 
The Help <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142864/help> and Birdman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/birdman>? You do. She also stars as Allison 
Ng in Cameron Crowe’s new movie, Aloha, which opened in the US last week, and 
is due for UK release in September.

Ng? Yes. It’s a common surname in China and east Asia, and among 
Asian-Americans. Stone’s character is a quarter Chinese, quarter Hawaiian and 
half Swedish.

Ri-ight. Erm … Yes?

Nothing. It’s just, you know … Emma Stone? Is she a quarter anything but white?
Nope. Not even a 64th. As she toldRefinery29 <http://www.refinery29.com/40227> 
a few years ago, “I’m so white. My hair grows out blonde, but my colouring is 
similar to that of a redhead.”


Aloha review – inspiration overdose at the pixie-dust buffet

Could someone who is half Chinese/Hawaiian actually look like that? Dunno. I 
guess that’s what the Swedish half is for. And it kind of matters, because the 
film is all about “the rich culture and history of Hawaii”, according to Crowe, 
and 60% of Hawaiians are ethnically Asian/Pacific Islander. Stone’s character 
is there to represent their perspective. All the other stars –Bill Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/bill-murray>, Bradley Cooper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradley-cooper>, Rachel McAdams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/rachel-mcadams>, Alec Baldwin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alec-baldwin>, John Krasinski 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/05/1> – are also white.

I see. Needless to say, the internet is fuming 
<http://themuse.jezebel.com/emma-stone-playing-a-half-asian-character-in-aloha-lit-1708174302?utm_campaign=socialfow_jezebel_twitter&utm_source=jezebel_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow>
 about it. The Media Action Network for Asian Americans hasissued a statement 
<http://manaa.org/?p=1544> calling for a boycott of the film.

Perhaps if they had dyed Stone’s hair black and digitally altered the shape of 
her eyes, that would have been more sensitive.Less sensitive, if anything, I’d 
say.

I thought pretending to be people you’re not was the whole point of acting? Up 
to a point. I mean, it might be a bit odd to see a black actor playing, say,Don 
Corleone <http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000791/>. So it would be nice if an 
Asian-American actor could be found to play an important Asian-American role, 
on the rare occasions one comes up.

Meanwhile, lots of people have to imagine that Emma Stone looks a bit Chinese. 
No, they don’t.Aloha has flopped 
<http://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/01/four-reasons-aloha-flopped-box-office>, 
taking just $10m on its opening weekend.

So the boycott worked? Perhaps. It’s probably a bit easier to boycott terrible 
movies.

Don’t say: “There just aren’t many bankable Asian-American stars to choose 
from.”

Do say: “MAYBE THIS IS WHY!!”
