It was over a decade ago that Kano released his debut album, Home Sweet Home 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/jun/17/popandrock.shopping5>, but he’s 
not lost his connection to his birthplace. Made in the Manor, the grime icon’s 
fifth album and his first since 2010’sMethod to the Madness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/26/kano-method-to-the-maadness-cd-review>
, is billed not just as a comeback album but a “forensic portrayal of 
inner-city England”.

References to the rapper’s formative years are scattered throughout – from 
growing up in east London (T-Shirt Weather in the Manor) to family tensions 
(Little Sis). But it’s not a one-man project, and Made in the Manor features 
production sheen from the likes of Rustie, Melé and the Grammy-winning Adele 
producer Fraser T Smith. There are also some thrilling guest spots, such as the 
sound ofKano <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kano>, Wiley and Giggs 
colliding on 3 Wheel-Ups, and the collaboration with Damon Albarn that is Deep 
Blues.
