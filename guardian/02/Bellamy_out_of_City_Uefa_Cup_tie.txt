Craig Bellamy <https://www.theguardian.com/football/craig-bellamy> will miss 
the second leg of Manchester City's Uefa Cup last-16 tie with Aalborg tomorrow.

Some reports had suggested the striker, who has been out since the start of 
the month with a knee injury, could make a surprise return in Denmark tomorrow, 
but he did not travel with the squad.

Vincent Kompany (toe) will be given a late fitness test while Robinho (ankle) 
has been passed fit. Nigel de Jong is not registered. City lead 2-0 from the 
first leg.

Provisional squad: Given, Hart, Schmeichel, Richards, Onuoha, Dunne, Bridge, 
Garrido, Zabaleta, Wright-Phillips, Elano, Caicedo, Ireland, Fernandes, 
Vassell, Weiss, Robinho, Evans, Bojinov, Berti, Etuhu.
