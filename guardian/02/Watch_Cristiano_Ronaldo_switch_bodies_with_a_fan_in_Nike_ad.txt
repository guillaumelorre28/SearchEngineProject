Johnsonville: ‘Car Chase’ (starts at 00:04) - US

For the second week running, the Ad Break begins with an advert for 
Johnsonville from the US. Once again, they’ve asked someone who works at the 
company itself to sketch out an idea for a commercial... and then made it 
exactly as he’s described, even incorporating his corrections and hesitations. 
The result is attention-grabbingly funny.

Halfords: ‘For Life’s Journeys’ (starts at 01:07) - UK

The disappointing nature of our weather during the so-called British summer 
has long been a favourite meme of UK advertising and it’s used extremely well 
in this advert for Halfords. It’s thirty seconds of triumphant misery and if it 
doesn’t have you nodding in recognition then you haven’t lived here long enough.

The Prince’s Trust: ‘Parallel Lives’ (starts at 01:41) - UK

It’s difficult to recall a more effective use of split-screen than that seen 
in this admirably restrained film highlighting the role of The Prince’s Trust 
in guiding young people away from potential disastrous lifestyle choices. The 
parallel lives it depicts belong to a young woman living in a high rise. In one 
version of her life, she eagerly awaits the arrival of a young man on whom she 
has pinned her highest romantic hopes. In the other, she faces the dismal 
prospect of being paid for sex.

Nike: ‘The Switch’ (starts at 03:15) - UK

Ronaldo’s graceless response to Iceland pluck may have confirmed our worst 
fears about the Portuguese footballer’s true nature but set that aside for a 
few minutes and enjoy this epic commercial for Nike that echoes the Tom Hanks 
film Big. It turns out Ronaldo is a pretty good actor, as those who’ve watched 
him rolling around the turf in “agony” may have long suspected.
