Boom!

This 3D film is a fever dream of race and revolution. Set to Alton Ellis’s 
reggae refrain “I was born a loser”, it begins with Rodin’s Thinker, projected 
in a void. But its feet are mangled, blown off by Black Power supporters the 
Weather Underground, believed to have dynamited this particular cast in 
Cleveland, 1970.

Natural history

The scene shifts to LA where Hollywood junipers wave their shaggy limbs in 
slow motion against the nocturnal city lights. The dense, rippling foliage 
resembles aliens or billowing smoke.

Sparks fly

Next, it’s fireworks in the night sky above the stadium used for Berlin’s 1936 
Olympics. And, finally, another tree, a tangled German oak.

Remix

Gaillard’s films seduce with intense mood while trailing intricate 
backstories. Here, the images refer to cultural narratives rewritten by rebels 
and underdogs. The trees are unwanted east Asian invaders; the stadium not the 
intended site of Nazi supremacy but where the black American athlete Jesse 
Owens scored four gold medals. The song was reimagined, too, recorded as I Was 
Born A Winner in 1971.
