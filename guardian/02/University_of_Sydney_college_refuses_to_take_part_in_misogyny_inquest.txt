A prestigious college at the University of Sydney has refused to participate 
in a university-wide inquest into cultural attitudes of misogyny led by former 
sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick.


The male-only St Paul’s college will instead conduct its own internal review, 
whose results will be kept confidential.

The university’s residential colleges have long been plagued with reports of 
sexism, scandal and misbehaviour, whichvice-chancellor Michael Spence described

 as “a thorn in our flesh” in May.

Earlier this year, students at the co-educational Wesley College were 
condemned for producing a journal that shamed female students who had slept 
with the most men, while in 2009 students at St Paul’s set up a “pro-rape” 
Facebook page.

The Students’ Representative Council women’s officer, Anna Hush, criticised 
the St Paul’s boycott.

“We’ve known for decades that colleges have an issue with misogyny, but part 
of the problem is their insularity. When these institutions aren’t open to 
external scrutiny, the sexism inside them is allowed to go unchecked,” she said.

“The Broderick review is a good start, but we need to remember that none of 
the recommendations will be binding to the colleges. This is why transparency 
is so key.”

A university spokeswoman said Broderick had begun working with the remaining 
five residential colleges and had established a confidential email address for 
students to share their experiences.

“Ms Broderick and her team advise they have been impressed by the colleges’ 
openness and enthusiasm for the project and are confident about the long term 
benefits”, she said.

Broderick has previously led investigations into the treatment of women in the 
Australian Defence Force

Rather than signing up to the Broderick review, St Paul’s has opted for 
male-focused workshops led by former students in a bid to reform its internal 
culture, it is understood.

The sessions would be run on the lines of the UK-based Good Lad 
<http://www.goodladworkshop.com/> workshops. The project manager of Good Lad 
Australia, Alistair Kitchen, said he organised with the college to conduct 
workshops that help “men start conversations around consent, sexual harassment, 
masculinity and peer pressure”.

He said he would have been happy for the workshops to be delivered alongside 
the Broderick review process, and that they aimed to establish a “robust, 
feminist, moral framework” for male students’ relationships with women.

“We have an in-depth and intimate understanding of the issues unique to that 
environment and how to improve it,” he said.

Hush said the workshops were a “a positive thing for colleges to recognise”.

“I think men do need on take on the responsibility of educating their peers 
about gender, sexism and consent. As long as we keep shying away from it, women 
will keep getting hurt.”

The colleges are independent of the university. The warden of St Paul’s, Dr 
Ivan Head, did not respond to Guardian Australia’s request for comment, buttold 
Fairfax Media

 the college had “exercised its liberty as a self-governing body” in deciding 
not to take part in the review.

In August, it was announced that Universities Australia would commission a 
landmark nationwide survey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/23/study-to-determine-sexual-assault-prevalence-in-australian-universities>
 into the prevalence of sexual assault on campuses. A survey of 1,926 
University of Sydney students from May reported that one in four had 
experienced sexual harassment or assault, but only 18.9% of those reported the 
incident.
