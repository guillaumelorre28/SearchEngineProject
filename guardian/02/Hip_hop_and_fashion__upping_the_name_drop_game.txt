Ever since Grandmaster Flash name-dropped Calvin Klein back in 1982 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQdg9fwO8Yk>, rappers haven't stopped shouting 
about their designer allegiances. Over the past 20 years it has become almost 
compulsory for rap songs to be peppered with references to established fashion 
houses such as Louis Vuitton, Prada and Gucci. 

It is easy to dismiss many of Kanye West's claims as pompous 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/23/kanye-west-zane-lowe-interview>, 
but there is no denying that ever since he donneda womenswear Celine shirt in 
2011 <http://style.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kanye-west-celine.jpg> 
and started bringing brands such asMartin Margiela to the forefront of his songs
 <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/04/martin-margiela-rumours>
, rap's attitude to fashion has shifted sideways, to the more obscure end of 
the fashion spectrum.

The aspirational name-drop game has been upped. Nowhere is this more evident 
than in ASAP Rocky's Fashion Killa, where obscurer-than-thou designer names are 
delivered in a machine-gun round of verses. The song calls out 27 designers in 
total, most of which are avant-garde and many womenswear-only. And I could be 
wrong, but I'm pretty sure it is the first song to namecheck Belgian minimalist 
designer Ann Demeulemeester.

Admittedly, the video is kind of boring 
<http://video.gq.com/watch/a-ap-rocky-rihanna-fashion-killa-video>, but then 
this is a song about taking your hot girlfriend on a shopping spree (Rihanna 
stars in the video and Rocky is dating model Chanel Iman in real life). Perhaps 
the mundanity of the video is also the perfect illustration of how tired and 
arbitrary rap's relationship with fashion has become. It was exclusively 
launched by GQ, after all.

Jean Touitou, the head designer of APC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/02/apc>, delivered a 
particularly gloomy 
<http://www.style.com/stylefile/2013/07/kanye-west-for-a-p-c/> verdict on the 
issue when talking about his collaboration with Kanye earlier this year: 
"Fashion killed rock'n'roll. Fashion killed contemporary art and turned it 
vulgar. And if hip-hop artists are not careful, it will also kill hip-hop". 

With designers latching on to rappers before they're even established in the 
mainstream – seeAlexander Wang and Azealia Banks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/aug/02/azealia-banks-fashion-poster-girl>
 – the rappers are treated as a brand themselves.  Braggadocio has gone beyond 
rap aspiration and is now knowingly co-opted by designers. And if the designer 
rejects your attention? Well,then you'll write a diss track about it 
<http://fashionista.com/2013/09/confirmed-kanye-west-wrote-i-am-a-god-about-hedi-slimane/>

Migos – Versace
Minimalism and leather jogging trousers aren't for everyone. Opulent 
baroque-print clothing is still huge, and this ode to the champions of the 
unsubtle, Versace, has become one of the biggest rap songs of 2013. Donatella 
has embraced it, played it at the end of the most recent Versace show.

Jay Z – Tom Ford
No one's name carries quite as much weight as Tom Ford's, with his highly 
exclusive fashion shows, limited pieces and some of the most expensive beauty 
products and fragrances around. This song was released at around the timeOprah 
revealed she was shunned by an allegedly racist shop assistant while trying to 
buy a Tom Ford handbag 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/09/oprah-winfrey-swiss-apology-racist-treatment>
, which is pretty mindblowing when you think about it.
