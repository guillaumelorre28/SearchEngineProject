The romantic heist tale, which co-stars The Wolf of Wall Street’s Margot 
Robbie, delivered one of Smith’s lowest-ever tentpole openings. The 
Independence Day star is renowned for his box office clout, or at least had 
been until sci-fi passion project After Earth became his first major film not 
to open at No 1 for two decades in May 2013.

Previous chart-topper Fifty Shades of Grey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey> fell to fourth place 
with another $10.9m in its third week of release, but still looks on course to 
pass the $500m mark at the global box office this week. Sam Taylor-Johnson’s 
controversial erotic romance has made $147.7m in north America and $486m 
worldwide.

Matthew Vaughn spy caper Kingsman held up well to retain second spot with 
another $11.7m in its third week for a total of $85.6m. Offbeat children’s 
animated sequel The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water landed in third with 
$11.2m in its fourth week for a total of $140.3m.

The only other new film to make the top 10 was low-budget horror The Lazarus 
Effect, which centres on a group of scientists who discover a method for 
raising the dead. Starring Olivia Wilde, Mark Duplass, Evan Peters and Donald 
Glover, David Gelb’s $3.3m film secured fifth place with a bow of $10.6m.

Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood war biopic American Sniper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/american-sniper> enjoyed a post-Oscars bounce 
despite failing to pick up prizes in any of the major categories last month. 
The blockbuster drama took another $7.7m in seventh place in its 10th week on 
wide release. Eastwood’s film now has a gargantuan $331.1m in north America and 
$470.2m worldwide.
