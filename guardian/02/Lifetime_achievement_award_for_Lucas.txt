George Lucas, the creator of the Star Wars series, Raiders of the Lost Ark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/raiders-of-the-lost-ark> and American 
Graffiti, is to receive the American Film Institute's lifetime achievement 
award at its prize ceremony next June.

Lucas, 60, joins the likes of Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro and Tom Hanks, and 
his Raiders cohort Steven Spielberg, all of whom have been honoured by the 
institute.

"I've been very fortunate to have had a long career doing what I love to do, 
and being recognised by the AFI for it is really an honour," said Lucas. "I'm 
proud to be counted among such an extraordinary group of people, whose lives 
are dedicated to the art of making movies."

The award marks a busy year for Lucas. Last month, his original Star Wars 
trilogy debuted for the first time on DVD (and became a bestseller) along with 
a revised version of his first film, the dystopian sci-fi thriller THX 1138.

And in May, he will wrap up his Star Wars prequels with the release of Episode 
III: The Revenge of the Sith, which reveals how Darth Vader became a scarred, 
half-human, half-machine villain.
