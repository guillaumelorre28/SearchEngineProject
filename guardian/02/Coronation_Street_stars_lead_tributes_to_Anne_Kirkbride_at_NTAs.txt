Coronation Street <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/coronation-street> 
stars led the tributes to their late colleague Anne Kirkbride at Wednesday 
night’s National Television Awards, though the ITV soap ended the night 
empty-handed.

Kirkbride’s screen husband William Roache - who worked alongside her for 40 
years - declared “I love you Anne” after speaking warmly of his “vibrant, 
warm-hearted, loving” colleague in a speech that left many in tears.

And as EastEnders <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eastenders> beat 
Corrie to the best soap prize actor Adam Woodyatt said the BBC1 show would be 
nothing without its ITV competitor.

In reference to a celebrated storyline in which Kirkbride’s character Deirdre 
was wrongly jailed, Woodyatt (who plays Ian Beale) said: “If you don’t mind, 
we’d like to accept this for the Weatherfield One.”

Other winners at the annual ceremony staged at London’s O2 Arena included the 
Great British Bake Off, for its first series on BBC1 after switching from BBC2, 
Channel 4’s Gogglebox andDavid Tennant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-tennant>, who received the special 
recognition award.

Ant and Dec <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ant-and-dec> were double 
winners as they took the best entertainment presenter prize for the 14th 
successive year, while their series I’m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! 
landed the best entertainment programme trophy - beating another of their 
shows, Saturday Night Takeaway.


Actor Sheridan Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sheridan-smith> 
landed the best drama performance prize for ITV biopic Cilla, but failed to 
make it to the ceremony on time after her taxi got stuck in traffic en route, 
causing her to turn up late with an apology.

And The X Factor <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-x-factor> beat 
Strictly Come Dancing to the best talent show prize despite trailing in the 
ratings to the BBC1 show last year.

Viewers of the ceremony were able to see Strictly host Claudia Winkleman mouth 
the word “what?” when her BBC1 show was beaten to the prize.

But it was the death of Kirkbride on Monday that cast a long shadow. Street 
colleagues including Barbara Knox and Sally Dynevor attended the ceremony 
despite still grieving, and just a day after filming on the soap was abandoned 
as the cast came to terms with their loss.

Roache, standing beneath a huge image of Kirkbride’s face, told guests from 
the TV world: “I feel so blessed, honoured and privileged to have had those 
years working with Anne.

“What we’ll remember the most is the vibrant, warm-hearted, loving person who 
came to work each day, gave us all a hug and brightened up our lives.

“Together with Anne’s brother John and his family, David, and her Coronation 
Street family, and especially Beverley Callard – who was very close to Anne in 
her last days – we’ve been deeply touched by the outpouring of love for Anne 
since she passed away on Monday evening.”

His voice trembling with emotion, he said: “We share your grief and sadness at 
losing such a beautiful person who’ll be so greatly missed by us all.” He 
added: “I love you, Anne. Thank you.”

Woodyatt, collecting the top soap prize for EastEnders, acknowledged the key 
role of its TV rival.

BBC1’s Mrs Brown’s Boys took the comedy prize, with star and creator Brendan
