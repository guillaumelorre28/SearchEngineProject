Emmanuel, 24, Ivory Coast

There was too much violence in Ivory Coast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ivory-coast>. You can’t live there. All my 
friends have left.

My parents divorced and didn’t look after me. I was nine when I had to drop 
out of school. I started working to look after myself and put some money aside, 
little by little. I went toLibya <https://www.theguardian.com/world/libya>. I 
worked as an upholsterer so I could pay my rent and buy food. But at the end of 
the day, they would stop me in the street and take my money. I lived on eggs: 
they were cheap. But that wasn’t the problem. After almost two years, it became 
too violent and dangerous. Libyans don’t like anyone who is not Libyan. I was 
feeling bad; I had no choice but to leave again.

I looked for someone who could help me. I asked around, paid lots of money, 
and in three days I left. It was at night. There were more than 500 of us on 
that boat. Far too many. I didn’t see anything when I boarded, it was dark; but 
once I was inside, I immediately thought, I’m going to die. Two hours into the 
journey, the engine broke. I thought, it’s over now. The sea, you know, it’s 
not just a bit of water. I was ready for the end.

After two days, they rescued us. They gave us food – macaroni. I hadn’t eaten 
in two days, so it was good. You must go to a country where there is security 
and where human rights are respected, even if the risk is dying in the water.

 Ibrahim, 29, and Sidibe, 10, Mali: ‘On the night we departed, I saw lots of 
people dying around me.’ Photograph: Gideon Mendel 
Ibrahim I was born in Congo-Brazzaville 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/congo-brazzaville>. My father died in the 
Congo war and I moved to Mali with my mother. My brother Sidibe was born to 
another dad.

One day, on television, I saw people who had made it to Italy. I was working 
in Congo-Brazzaville and decided to go there via Libya. I stopped inMali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mali>, and during my stay my mother died. My 
brother was left alone, so I took him with me. But the journey was long and 
once we arrived in Libya, it was terrible.

Sidibe It was a very long journey. We travelled by bus from Algeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/algeria> to Libya. The dust was so much – I 
really suffered. Then I had to walk for three hours across the border. I was 
tired. When we arrived in Ghadames, on the Libyan border, they gave me bread 
and cheese. That was so nice. Then they put us on a truck and I had to sit on 
sheep’s poo. I threw up. Later, we found a house. One night, at midnight, some 
policemen knocked at our door and took my brother away. I stayed alone at home 
for four days. I didn’t know what to do. I had only biscuits and water. I was 
frightened and thought I was not going to see Ibrahim again. I only have him.

Ibrahim I had done nothing, but they were armed and took me to prison. They 
said nothing, only asked for lots of money – 500,000 West African CFA francs 
(£555) – if I wanted to be freed. Once I was out, I started putting money aside 
for the journey by boat. On the night we departed, I saw lots of people dying 
around me. To get on board, you need to walk from the shore into the sea until 
the water reaches your shoulders. Then you are pushed on the dinghy. It’s there 
that people fall and die. The boat was crowded. I jumped on it and put Sidibe 
between my legs. We spent three days like this. The sea was going up and down, 
we were taking on water. When the rescue ship arrived, Sidibe was pulled to 
safety first. The Italians gave us food and water. They are good people. Now I 
want Sidibe to go to school.

 Promise, 26, Nigeria: ‘Libya is a Muslim country; they don’t like Christians 
like me.’ Photograph: Gideon Mendel 
There was plenty of war in Nigeria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria>
. I lost my mother and father, my sisters and my brothers – we all ran away 
during the war, and I don’t know where they are now.

A man saved me from the war and took me to his house, but his wife thought I 
was sleeping with him. He gave me some money and told me to flee to Libya. But 
when I got there, I saw there was war, too. I found myself in Tripoli. There 
was fighting and killing all around us. Libya is a Muslim country; they don’t 
like Christians like me.

Somebody brought me to his house and told me to stay. They said they would 
help me go to Italy. But that house wasn’t a good one. It was very big and 
there were other people. I stayed for a long time, I can’t remember how long. 
Then somebody paid for me to get on a boat and come here. The journey was very 
long. I thought I was going to die. The sea was very big and dark. I was crying 
inside that boat: God help me, God save me. I prayed with another woman – we 
didn’t know each other. Finally we saw a ship coming. It was in the afternoon. 
We thought they were fishermen, but it was a rescue boat. We were waving, 
crying, shouting: help, help! And so [the Italians] came and rescued us. A man 
from the ship grabbed my hand – don’t rush, don’t rush, he said. I still 
remember him: he was slim and had a cap on his head. Thank God, I said. I’m 
happy now, but I feel very alone.

My dad went to Canada when I was born. A year later, I moved with my mum to 
Kenya; there was fighting in Somalia. I have a sister and four brothers. We 
stayed in a UNHCR refugee camp. That’s where I learned English; I studied 
there. We wanted to get visas for America, but we are Africans, you know? They 
sent us back toSomalia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia> instead.

One day, a few years ago, al-Shabaab  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab>brought our house down. There was 
an explosion. My mother died; I still miss her. I have a husband back home and 
two children. They live in a town between Somalia and Ethiopia.

I didn’t tell anyone that I wanted to leave, initially – only a friend. She 
helped me organise my travel to Libya, then to Italy, to go to America. I want 
to give my family a good life. While moving countries and phone numbers, we 
lost contact with my dad. But I want to find him now. I have an aunt, his 
sister, in the US. That’s where I want to go.

 Faith, 25, Nigeria: ‘When we reached Sabha, I was kidnapped together with 
another woman.’ Photograph: Gideon Mendel 
My mother died when she gave birth to me. I was four when I also lost my dad. 
I was staying with my grandma – no school, nothing – but six years ago, she 
died as well. I went to stay with one of my aunties in Kano, northern Nigeria, 
but there was fighting all over.Boko Haram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/boko-haram> was there, so I came back home.

One of my friends said she was going to Libya, so I followed her in December 
last year. When we reachedSabha <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabha,_Libya> [a 
hub of the trafficking trade in the south-west], I was kidnapped together with 
another woman. They kept us in a room with five more women. No food to eat, 
nothing for four days. Until, one night, a man we didn’t know helped us escape. 
He told us to run, that the place was not safe for us.

It was night-time. We ended up by the sea. The man said we should get on a 
boat – there were lots of people. The next day, around two in the afternoon, 
they came to rescue us. I’m OK now, but every time I think of my past, I stop 
eating. People call their mum and dad. I didn’t know my mum. I have no one to 
call.

way to Italy than to stay in Libya.’ Photograph: Gideon Mendel 
I came to find a better future in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. Because of the bad governance, 
corruption and poverty in our country – in all African countries. This makes 
people run away.

I come from a very extended family. My father is not alive, there are 17 of 
us, and they all rely on me. I’m a mobile technician – I repair phones. Out of 
the little money I was earning, three-quarters went to the family. It was not 
enough to satisfy me, let alone them. I heard you could make a lot of money in 
Libya. All my friends in the Gambia left to go there.

They told me that the province was safe, that you can work and earn money. I 
stayed almost three years, but then the problems spread across the country. 
They kidnapped blacks everywhere, demanding £1,200-£2,000 as a ransom. After a 
year, my brother joined me in Libya, but he was injured at work and died. There 
was no hospital to take him to. It was too dangerous. They kidnap you in the 
street, but it’s better to be taken by the bandits than the police; at least 
the kidnappers want to keep you alive to get the money from your family.

I was put in prison, and given very little food. My family didn’t have any 
money to pay. Once I was out, I started working, but didn’t get paid. Then I 
was offered a chance to come to Italy. The people who do this don’t hide; they 
approach you in the street. Even the police approach people. My boat was a 
dinghy. We were more than 100 people, and my family knew nothing about it. 
Nobody on the boat expected such a bad journey, but it would have been better 
to die in the water on the way to Italy than to stay in Libya. One day, I will 
go back home.

I didn’t want to come to Europe. I wanted to work in Libya. I stayed there for 
two years. But then I thought I was going to die, so I decided to leave. But 
from Libya you can’t get a car or jump on a plane. If you try to cross the 
border, you will be shot.

I took a boat to Italy because it’s near. If I knew more about the journey, I 
would never have come. They pushed us on the boat; there were 93 of us, 
fighting for our lives in that tiny boat. We didn’t know if the captain was 
qualified. I cried. The boat began to sink and the captain called the rescue 
ship. It was eight o’clock when it arrived.

They took me to a reception centre. There were 400 of us at the beginning. Now 
they have moved 300 people, taking them to Rome and Milan. I don’t have 
anything with me here. I don’t have my family’s phone numbers. All I had was a 
memory card that they stole from me before I jumped on the boat. We’ve been 
sitting here for two weeks now. We spend the day walking up and down. You don’t 
know what is going on. I want to work. My family in Ghana has nothing. I am 
hopeful that something will change.

This dress is the only thing I have with me. It’s old, but it’s my favourite 
and reminds me of my three girlfriends back home. I bought it for New Year’s 
Eve. We had fun that night, watching the fireworks. I washed it after the 
journey by boat. It was soaked.

I left Ivory Coast because my parents were planning a forced marriage. I’m a 
Muslim, and I refused. My father kicked me out. I decided to join my brother in 
Tripoli. I travelled across Burkina Faso and via Agadez in Niger [part of a 
well-known traffickers’ route], then through Libya.

Every time you come into contact with the “police”, you have to pay. I spent a 
week in Sabha, where we paid people to take us to Tripoli. There, we were sold 
again to different people, who then sold us on.

When they take you, they make you work. In Libya I was kidnapped and put in 
prison for a month. I was raped many times. There were lots of women like me. I 
was sharing a cell with a girl from Mali and one from Nigeria. We communicated 
with our hands, and the Nigerian girl became a friend.

Our dream was to come to Europe. My brother paid £218 to help me – his friends 
had raised some money to free me. But then I became ill – I couldn’t eat, I 
couldn’t sleep. I was worried the people from the prison would come again. So 
he organised my travel to Europe. I’ve been here two weeks. I just want to work.

I left Nigeria because of Boko Haram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/boko-haram>. We need your help: they killed 
my parents, my sisters, my brothers. My friend and I didn’t know where to go, 
we wanted to save our lives. A man took us to Libya, but he put us into 
prostitution. I had no food, and if I refused to do what he wanted, he would 
beat me and threaten me with a gun.

I was forced to work as a prostitute for a year. We managed to run away and 
met a man who paid for us to get on a boat. I was praying to my God. Now I’m 
here with my best friend. But I’m sad when I think about my family. I want to 
become a journalist, a newscaster. I will try my best.

I’m here because of the war. In Mali, I was repairing motorbikes. One day I 
came home after work and found that my mother had been killed. My little sister 
had been killed. They were dead on the floor. I asked myself, why wasn’t I 
there?

Then I thought, if I had been there, they would have killed me, too. I ran out 
and flew to Algeria. But once I arrived, I discovered that it was difficult to 
find a job and make a living. There are no motorbikes there, only cars. I 
became worried. I moved to Tripoli to be able to eat. There’s more work, but 
it’s also more dangerous.

In the street, if they see you’re a foreigner, they will shout, “Come here!” 
If you don’t run, they’ll beat you. They hit me many times, once with the back 
of a gun. I found a job cleaning the houses of wealthy people. But on the way 
back from work, they would strip me of my clothing and take the money I had 
earned. Once, I went three days without eating. I had to look for food in the 
rubbish.

One day, a man offered to pay for me to go to Italy. There was war in Libya. 
Even that night – boom boom – you could hear it. I thought, I’ll leave. That’s 
why I’m here. But I still have so much sorrow. My life is finished without my 
mother and sister. There was a time when I wanted to get married and have a 
family, but now I don’t. My children would ask me, “Where is grandma?” I loved 
my mother. I don’t care about finding a woman.

 Rose, 21, Nigeria: ‘Now I want the UN to help me. I don’t want to sell myself 
for money.’ Photograph: Gideon Mendel 
I wanted to become a nurse in Nigeria, but when my family was murdered right 
in front of me, I decided to escape. I met a man and told him I needed help, 
since I was an orphan – no one to talk to, just me. He said he was going to 
take me to Libya to work in a restaurant with him. I went, not knowing that he 
was bringing me there to work as a prostitute and make money for him. He told 
me that when we arrived in Libya.

I said to him, “I can’t do it.” He locked me up for some months and beat me 
every night and day. There was nowhere to escape. There were lots of people 
like me in the same room. No one could hear us. Sometimes, they didn’t even 
give us food.

One day, a man came to the house. I told him, “I can’t continue staying in 
this place. Please help me.” He said OK, on the condition that I follow him to 
his house. I went, not knowing he was taking me to the seaside. So, all of a 
sudden, I found myself on the Mediterranean sea.

We were many; I was really scared. The water has no end and no beginning. A 
lot of people were fighting with sharp objects. There were Muslims and 
Christians. They said they didn’t want Christians on the boat. I was one of 
them. Then the heat burned one of the girls. I cried. God, did this man bring 
me out of that place to kill me in the water? I can’t even explain it. A lot of 
things happened before we saw the rescue ship. I was very happy then. Now I 
want the UN to help me. I don’t want to sell myself for money.
