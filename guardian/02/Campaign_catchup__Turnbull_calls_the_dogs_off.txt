In one of his last major speeches of the campaign, Malcolm Turnbull took the 
opportunity to urge the next parliament to “offload the ideology, to end the 
juvenile theatrics, and gotcha moments, to drop the personality politics”. 
Wouldn’t that be nice?

Pity the PM’s call for civility has come about so long after Peter Dutton on 
“illiterate and innumerate” refugees andScott Morrison on Labor’s “toxins on 
growth” and “tax bullets”, not to mention Morrison on the “hate speech” he’d 
received over same-sex marriage and, well,Morrison on plenty of topics this

Remember this? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jun/16/scott-morrison-a-vote-for-labor-is-a-vote-for-a-return-to-chaos-video>
The prime minister told the National Press Club in Canberra on Thursday 
afternoon that Australians want their representatives to focus on “the issues 
that matter to them”, and that they were “entitled to expect that of their 
parliament”.

“In these uncertain times, we need to stick together,” he said, in the gently 
rebuking tone of your favourite high school teacher – not mad, just 
disappointed.

Turnbull went on to accuse Shorten of “setting out deliberately and 
dishonestly to fuel fear and division”. By now, you might be picking up on a 
logical inconsistency at the heart of this presentation.

As Lenore Taylor observed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/30/malcolm-turnbull-to-claim-high-ground-in-final-election-set-piece-speech>
, the call for more mature politics and an end to “division for division’s 
sake” is quite similar to the speech Turnbull made after seizing the leadership 
from his predecessor,Tony Abbott.


In his ongoing bid to make himself useful, Abbott told Sky News that this 
hasn’t been the campaign he would have run, singling out budget repair and 
border security as two issues that had been in his view overlooked.

But there’s never been a campaign quite like this one before, writes Katharine 
Murphy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/jun/30/australian-election-2016-turnbull-claims-a-mandate-and-calls-for-maturity-politics-live>
, pointing out that the Coalition has managed to do the distance while 
announcing almost no new policies. If you thought it was impossible to talk 
about one thing for eight consecutive weeks, well, now we know it isn’t.

More power to your Albo? 

Of course the outcome of the election won’t be known until Saturday, it’s a 
close-run contest, etc etc – butBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> is facing questions 
over his future, assuming a Labor loss.

The Daily Telegraph reported this morning that “key NSW right kingpin Senator 
Sam ‘Dasher’ Dastyari” is among the “factional powerbrokers” in support of 
backing a leadership challenge fromAnthony ‘DJ Albo’ Albanese. (Dastyari 
“vehementlydenied” the reports 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/federal-election-2016-albo-expected-to-challenge-shorten-if-labor-is-defeated/news-story/489448d8bab759bd6c5983abede3069b>
.)

The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, and the deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, are 
among the other names being bandied about.

Shorten was doubtless thrilled to be asked to pick how many seats he’d have to 
win to ward off a challenge from Albo – sort of like asking someone to take a 
punt on what distance they could comfortably miss a bullet by.

He said it was a “silly question” and that he was “in this election to win 
it”, which, well, fair enough. He said Labor had not only “been united for the 
last three years”, it was “more united now than ever”.Pretty united indeed, 
then.

Asked whether he was confident Dastyari supported him as leader, Shorten said 
it had been a “great privilege” to be elected party leader; that he thought 
Labor had probably exceeded some people’s expectations already; and that there 
was “not a single member” of his team that he would swap – so he didn’t answer 
the question, basically, but what’s new there!

Cape of good hope 

A hapless election campaign by incumbent David Feeney has fuelled the Greens’ 
hopes of winning the seat of Batman in Melbourne.The party’s polling two weeks 
ago even gave candidate

Alex Bhathal a commanding lead in the inner-Melbourne enclave.

<https://twitter.com/MelissaLDavey/status/748305162746228736> 
But the Labor powerbroker Feeney might survive – for now. The Greens leader, 
Richard Di Natale, conceded on Thursday. “You will see the Greens vote increase 
here in this election and if we don’t get it this election we’ll get it in the 
next one,” he said.

“I mean, we require a 10% swing. That’s a herculean effort. What we need to do 
now, because the Labor party and theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> have joined together 
with preferences that might get David Feeney over the line, the challenge for 
us is to get over the Labor and Liberal vote combined. That’s a hard ask.”

.)
Melissa Davey (@MelissaLDavey) 
"I definitely need some jam donuts before my next stop. I'll only have two." 
-Di Natale

<https://twitter.com/MelissaLDavey/status/748329823957721088> 
Since he was in the clarifying mood, Di Natale also cleared up – sort of – the 
confusion around his remarks on Wednesday, saying the Greens would be utterly 
opposed to offshore processing centres, in any negotiations with Labor, then 
adding that position was merely a “starting point”.

“Let me be absolutely clear,” he said on Thursday. “Our policy will never 
change. We want those camps closed. That is a bottom line that we will never 
negotiate on.”

But he added, in what might be interpreted as wriggle room: “That shouldn’t 
stop us from trying to get the other two parties to change their position”.
