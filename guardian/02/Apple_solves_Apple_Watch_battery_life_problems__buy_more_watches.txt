Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> has solved the problem of 
smartwatch battery life with its latest software update iOS 9.3 and WatchOS 2.2.

Users will now be able to pair more than one Apple Watch 
<http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/01/12/inside-ios-93-auto-switch-lets-you-use-multiple-apple-watches-with-one-iphone>
 to an iPhone and automatically switch between them, which means the faithful 
can now replace a watch that has run out of battery by hot-swapping to a fresh 
one.

It will of course involve owning multiple Apple Watches.


This may suit some Apple Watch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple-watch> wearers, who could now 
have one for day and one for night – or perhaps one for every day of the week.

The hot-swapping feature will roll out in the latest version of Apple’s iPhone 
software iOS 9.3 and within the latest version of its Apple Watch software, 
WatchOS 2.2.

All a user needs to do is put a watch on and raise their wrist in order to 
activate a pre-registered Apple Watch.

Apple Watch Edition users will finally be able to quickly switch to their 
Apple Watch Sport, should they enter a less than desirable area or wish to go 
running with a slightly lighter, less gaudy version, without having to switch 
their iPhone too.
