For all the chat about selling up and baling out, the Lebedev Indy/Standard 
empire keeps pounding on. Enter Steve Auckland fromMetro, one of the smartest 
media managers around, as new chief executive. Enteri100 
<http://i100.independent.co.uk>, a bright BuzzFeed clone of a news website for 
thei. Enter the Lebedevs pledging further investment.

Perhaps London Live <https://www.theguardian.com/media/london-live>, the local 
TV station that Jeremy Hunt invented, hasn't set the ratings alight yet. Two 
out of three top programmes on the latest count are re-runs of oldCouplings, 
with even olderLondon's Burnings trooping in behind. Barb panel metering isn't 
any help, to be sure: there are just too few respondents on the capital panel 
for a convincing verdict. But primetime audiences well under 20,000 betoken 
disappointment and struggle. Yet there's still a sense of opportunity and 
excitement around.

What next? The arriving Auckland may wonder why an improved Evening Standard 
website and an unimproved London Live site are separate. He may ponder on the 
common sense in running two sites using reprocessedIndependent material. The 
Lebedevs could own London if they got their web, print and screen act together. 
But not out of site and out of mind.
