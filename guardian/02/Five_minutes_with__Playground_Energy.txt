Can you tell us a bit about Playground Energy?
Playground Energy <http://www.playgroundenergy.com/> was founded at the end of 
2012 with one simple but important task – to motivate children to play more at 
playgrounds.

What was your inspiration for founding the company?
We see that more and more children are playing at home with electronic devices 
instead of going outside and enjoying playgrounds. This fact together with the 
changes in our diets are the two main reasons for the increasing level of 
obesity among children. The latest figures, for 2012-13 from theNational Child 
Measurement Programme <http://www.noo.org.uk/NOO_about_obesity/child_obesity> 
show that 18.9% of children in Year 6 (aged 10-11) were obese and a further 
14.4% were overweight. We decided to do something about this by creating new 
and exciting experiences for kids at the playground.

You describe one of the goals of Playground Energy as 'reinventing the first 
gaming platform – the playground'. How are you doing this?
Playground Energy produces a device (kinetic generator) that transforms 
kinetic energy from the children's playing on various playground equipment into 
electricity that can activate various playground-installed applications such as 
light, sounds etc. For example, when children play on ourLumi spring toy 
<http://www.reuters.com/video/2013/07/30/children-power-playground-toys?videoId=244482418>
 the body of the toy is illuminated by light and part of the produced energy 
powers a built-in speaker, which can play music from mobile devices via 
bluetooth.

In developing Playground Energy, what challenges have you faced and how have 
you solved them?
There were many challenges at the beginning but one in particular stood out – 
how to harvest kinetic energy from the movement of the playground equipment 
without sacrificing the gaming experience? If it is more difficult to play with 
our equipment compared to existing equipment, then the kids will avoid it.

Our way of solving this problem is to use a special kind of electricity 
generator for which we have a patent pending in Europe and the US. This 
generator does not create extra resistance so for the kids it is not more 
difficult to play with our equipment. At the same time, the generator is safe 
and practically maintenance-free.

What tips would you give to someone thinking about starting their own venture 
like yours?
Starting a new business is always exciting and challenging and our way of 
dealing with these challenges is by being persistently creative and creatively 
persistent.

What's next for the Playground Energy?
We are now developing six new products and we expect that these will be ready 
by the end of the year. Our next project for interactive playgrounds is in 
Milton Keynes as a part ofMK:Smart City project <http://www.mksmart.org/>. We 
are also working on a second round of investment with three potential investors.
