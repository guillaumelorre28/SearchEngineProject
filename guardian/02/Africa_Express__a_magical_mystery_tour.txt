It's late afternoon in west London and the Senegalese star Baaba Maal and 
Damon Albarn, from nearby in the neighbourhood, are lounging on a scrap of 
grass in the sun. Messing about on a bike beside them is east London rapper 
Kano, while tottering by on a pair of heels isShingai Shoniwa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/26/shingai-shoniwa-africa-express-noisettes>
 from the band the Noisettes. She's another Londoner, although her mum comes 
from Zimbabwe.

There's one important question on Albarn's mind and it's nothing to do with 
what is, just now, his day job – although rehearsals forBlur's closing show for 
the Olympics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/13/blur-olympic-closing-concert-review>
 are in full swing. "What I really need to know," he says in earnest, "is 
whether there's a proper bar on this train…"

The train to which he refers is the Africa Express, the name now given to a 
Class 47 diesel-electric locomotive 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_47> secured from waste haulage 
specialistsDirect Rail Services <http://www.directrailservices.com/> for what 
everyone now agrees is, in Albarn's words, "a ridiculous idea... it's 
completely mad".

On Sunday 2 September the train will pull out of Euston station with 
approximately 80 musicians on board, roughly half of whom comprise a who's who 
of African talent. As well as Baaba Maal, fresh from hosting his own Africa 
Utopia festival at the Southbank in London, there will be the blind 
husband-and-wife duo Amadou and Mariam from Mali; their compatriot, the kora 
player Toumani Diabaté; South African producer Spoek Mathambo; Ghanian rapper 
M.anifest; Egyptian rapper Karim Rush; Congo-born singer Baloji and dozens 
more. Wandering out of the photographer's studio now is another,Jupiter Bokondji
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/26/jupiter-bokondji-africa-express-congo>
, tired from playing a stunning show with his band Okwess International at the 
Womad festival in Wiltshire the previous afternoon. But peering into the 
sunlight, this rangy figure perks up. "Ah, Damon!" he begins, and they hug, 
before swiftly running out of words, his English being little better than the 
Englishman's French.

The pair first met on a trip Albarn made to the Democratic Republic of Congo 
in 2007 with the collective of musicians known as Africa Express. Conceived as 
a way of bringing western and African acts together, and run by an informal 
coterie of producers, promoters, managers and journalists, as well as Albarn 
himself, Africa Expressplayed a surprise set at Glastonbury that year  
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/26/worldmusic.glastonbury2007>which 
proved the hit of the festival. Since then, there has been a further series of 
occasional shows, usually involving a cast of several dozen acts and lasting 
several hours: in London as part of the BBC's Electric Proms; in the middle of 
Paris; on a beach in northern Spain in front of a crowd of 40,000.

The western acts have included everyone from Franz Ferdinand to John Paul 
Jones, Led Zeppelin to Johnny Marr, Björk and members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. 
Those joining the enterprise next week will include Charli XCX, Rizzle Kicks 
and Jack Steadman from Bombay Bicycle Club, as well as Shingai Shoniwa and Kano.

"The purpose as I see it," says the rapper, between shots in the photo studio, 
"is to show Africa at its best, at its most creative."

According to the journalist Ian Birrell, one of Africa Express's co-founders: 
"There are so many stereotypes in the west about Africa, but we hope that by 
opening people's ears to the music they will then open their eyes a little to 
reality. After all, seven of the world's fastest-growing economies are African, 
and there is so much we can learn from there."

Then there's a stray figure who won't be on the train, isn't a musician, but 
who wants to show his support regardless. Suddenly, through the garden gate 
looms Rio Ferdinand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/26/rio-ferdinand-africa-express-interview>
, the Manchester United footballer. Introduced to Albarn through a mutual 
friend, the pair haven't simply become improbable table tennis partners. 
Rather, Ferdinand wants to see if his support can further spread the word about 
this venture.

"I wish I could be on the train," he says, "but it's too near the start of the 
football season. I'd only get in trouble."

The train will tour the UK for a week, with one big show each night before the 
circus rolls back into London for a final gig in the new Granary Square in 
King's Cross. Rehearsals will take place on board, in a baggage car salvaged 
from the old Orient Express. As far as the fabulous Malian singer Fatoumata 
Diawara, who's also here and will be on board, is concerned: "It will all be 
beautiful."

En route, the plan is also for a series of impromptu gigs in city squares and 
workplaces, for pop-up workshops and more. "Logistically," says Lauren Roth de 
Wolf, one of the organisers, "yes, it's going to be a nightmare."

Albarn interrupts: "Or if not a bar... I hope there'll at least be an 
old-fashioned tea trolley."
