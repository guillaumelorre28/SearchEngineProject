Today E, for education tables... which is one of the features central to the 
Eduction section. An example isthis page of GCSE results

Education tables are a great example of how one specialist requirement can 
reap rewards for so many others. We decided the Education section couldn't be 
launched until we had created the ability to display and manage tables, and 
that's one reason why we waited until August 2008 to launch it -- there were a 
lot of other features to build before we got to tables.

Since launching tables for the Education section we've extended them for wider 
use. For example, they now feature more flexible formatting and the ability to 
click on a column for sorting. They're also being used in other sections, such 
as in the Media section to displaynewspaper circulation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2008/nov/07/abcs-pressandpublishing>, 
and the Football section tocompare recent Spurs managers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/table/2008/oct/26/tottenham-hotspur-managers>
.

Journalism used to be about writing articles; these days it includes not just 
text, nor just audio and video, but also -- as people likeAdrian Holovaty

andJeff Jarvis <http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/07/04/data-are-news/> have long 
said -- managing and exposing data. This is one example of how that can happen.
