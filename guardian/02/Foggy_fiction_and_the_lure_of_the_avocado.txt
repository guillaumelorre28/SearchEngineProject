It’s surprising, after your delightful feature on how London fog has “seeped 
into fiction” (Beyond the pall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/31/beyond-pall-how-london-fog-seeped-into-fiction>
, Review, 31 October), that no one has mentioned Margery Allingham’s superb 
1952 novel, The Tiger in the Smoke. In it Albert Campion hunts for a killer 
through a muffling London particular. I urge you to read it, and her other 
Campion novels. They remain lively and beguiling.

• Oi! Lay off us old folks as being ignorant and louche about avocados (Ripe 
and ready: how ‘evil geniuses’ got us hooked on avocados, 2 November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/02/avocados-ripe-ready-evil-geniuses-hooked>
). Check out André Simon, who in 1942 recommended eating them with a 
vinaigrette, and Jane Grigson, who in her book on vegetables gives some very 
good recipes. The avocado became rather a dinner party cliche in the 70s. It 
all comes round again.

• Not only does the new UK passport feature only two women (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/03/new-uk-passport-design-features-just-two-women>
, 4 November) but, remarkably, it manages to celebrate the “Creative United 
Kingdom” by failing to include any Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish people at 
all.

• Never again will I encounter a man so generous of spirit as Colin Welland (
Obituary, 4 November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/03/colin-welland>). Most writers are 
fiercely protective of their work. Not so Colin, always open to any thoughts to 
improve his Chariots of Fire screenplay. It was a privilege to have known him.

• Thanks to all the Guardian readers who have enhanced my “customer 
experience” and taken me on so many “learning journeys” (Letters, 3 November).

• I can probably put up with “oven chips” and even a “replacement bus” as long 
as they’re not “hand crafted”.
