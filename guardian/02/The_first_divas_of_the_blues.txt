In 1912, the 18-year-old Bessie Smith had an audition with the Stokes troupe, 
a travelling African-American company. She was hired as a dancer, because the 
company already had a powerful singer in Gertrude "Ma" Rainey. Rainey, perhaps 
the most significant female blues singer of the first generation, was also one 
of the first African-American women to record. She had her own sound, a mix of 
an almost operatic power and the rough, moaning style drawn from early black 
folk music. Rainey taught the talented teenager Smith stagecraft and confidence 
and she went on to become the most acclaimed jazz/blues singer 
of her generation.
