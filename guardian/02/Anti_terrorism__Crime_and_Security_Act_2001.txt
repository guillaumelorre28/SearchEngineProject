Background

The Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act was the Blair government's response 
to the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre. Tony Blair 
described Britain as being "at war with terrorism" and this bill was intended 
to arm the government to fight it. The bill – portrayed as a vital package of 
measures that would bolster Britain's security and assist the security services 
to detect and prosecute terrorists – was rushed through parliament. It was 
first published on 13 November 2001 and entered the statute book on 14 December 
2001. The first foreign nationals were interned under the act on 19 December 
2001.

The key element of the bill was the government's determination to find a way 
to deal with foreign nationals whom the security services suspected of 
committing, organising or supporting terrorism.Under the European convention on 
human rights <http://www.justiceinitiative.org/db/resource2?res_id=104053>, 
many of these individuals could not be deported because they came from 
countries with poor human rights records and faced torture or the death penalty 
if forced to return. Faced with suspected terrorists who they could neither 
prosecute nor deport, the government created provisions to indefinitely detain 
foreign nationals deemed to threaten national security without charging them or 
bringing them to trial. MPs were told that intelligence services had drawn up a 
list of approximately 20 Islamic fundamentalists who would be detained when the 
new legislation came into force.

The act also enables communication service providers to retain data – not 
content – so that it can be accessed under existing legislation by law agencies 
investigating criminal and terrorist activity. It was governed by a voluntary 
Code of Practice later codified into theRetention of Communications Data (Code 
of Practice) Order 2003 <http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2003/20033175.htm>, which 
was developed in consultation with the Information Commissioner and industry.

Communications data can include the identity and location of the caller, 
texter or web user. The government emphasised retained data was a vital tool 
for the security services and was necessary in order to safeguard national 
security and investigate crime.

In order to shepherd the bill through the House of Lords, the government made 
a series of concessions including a "sunset clause" for the controversial 
detention provisions and the communications data clause that meant elements of 
the act would expire unless they were renewed within five years. Other clauses 
in the act would be reviewed by a privy council committee after two years, and 
any areas the committee had concerns about would be referred to and debated in 
parliament. If they were not reaffirmed they would cease to be law within six 
months.

The most controversial element of the bill proved to be the government's 
attempt to make a new criminal offence ofinciting religious hatred 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2001/oct/24/race.religion>. The home 
secretary was forced to abandon the provisions, which would have extended race 
hate laws to cover religion, after peers twice voted against the measure.

In October 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown invoked elements of the act 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/who-are-you-calling-terrorists-mr-brown-971471.html>
 to freeze the British assets of Icelandic bank Landsbanki during the Icelandic 
financial crisis.

Criticism

On 16 December 2004, a specially-convened committee of nine law lords held 
that detaining foreigners without trial 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/dec/16/terrorism.humanrights> breached 
the European convention on human rights incorporated into domestic law by the
Human Rights Act 1998 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/14/human-rights-act>
. The appeal was made on behalf of nine foreigners who had been detained in 
Belmarsh prison for almost three years. The legal decision was based on a 
finding that the act was discriminatory (as it only applied to foreign 
nationals) and that it breached the right to liberty guaranteed under Article 
5. The law lords were scathing in their summing up.

Lord Nicholls said in his ruling 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/16_12_04_detainees.pdf>: 
"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country 
which observes the rule of law.

"It deprives the detained person of the protection a criminal trial is 
intended to afford."

Lord Hoffmann 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/law-lords-condemn-blunketts-terror-measures-691986.html>
, one of the panel of nine law lords, said: "[This case] calls into question 
the very existence of an ancient liberty of which this country has until now 
been very proud: freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention."

In response to government arguments that the anti-terrorism act was necessary 
to protect the life of the nation, Lord Hoffmann said: "The real threat to the 
life of the nation ... comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these.

"That is the true measure of what terrorism may achieve. It is for parliament 
to decide whether to give the terrorists such a victory."
