<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRwuD68NHoI&list=PL-DfNcB3lim9IZmUXEjE1Ov0Ir1NDa3Yr&index=34>
. The blockbuster, set about 30 years after the Return of the Jedi, stars John 
Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, 
and Max von Sydow. Actors from previous film, including Harrison Ford, Carrie 
Fisher, Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Kenny Baker, also 
feature in JJ Abrams’ movie.

One Hollywood legend who isn’t in the film – but probably wishes he was – is 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, who joins James Corden toact out snippets from all his 
films in six minutes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXmYdAm9Vjs>. From Conan 
the Barbarian to Jingle All the Way and from Twins to Terminator, it’s 
powerhouse cinema classics.

Young patients at a Texas children’s hospital got a special surprise when 
members of the Austin Police Department SWAT teamdressed up as comic book 
legends <https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10153221013826336>, such as 
Superman, Batman, and The Joker, and abseiled down the side of the building 
before acting out an adventure for them.


Staying in Texas, there were laughs galore in the council chamber when the 
mayor went for a bathroom break

and forgot to turn off his microphone and we’ve got more chuckles from Jack 
Black and Jimmy Fallonrecreate Extreme’s More Than Words <http://

Meanwhile, it’s the goal everyone wants to score. Colin Quaner of VfR Aaalen 
back-heeled the ball into the top corner of the net 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uNAkEwuR_Y&list=PL-DfNcB3lim9IZmUXEjE1Ov0Ir1NDa3Yr&index=63>
 - the only problem was it was his own net - providing an own goal which 
eventually led to a 4-2 defeat against VfL Bochum. Quaner still manages a smile.
