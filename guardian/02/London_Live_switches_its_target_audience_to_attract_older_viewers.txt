London Live, the "local TV" channel launched by ESI Media, is to switch to a 
new target audience,according to an article in Campaign. 
<http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/1307558/london-live-move-closer-evening-standard/>

The repositioning will see the channel forsaking the youth market to appeal to 
an older audience closer to the 25 to 44 age range, which happens to be the 
core readership of its print stablemate, theLondon Evening Standard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/london-evening-standard>.

Tim Kirkman, London Live's chief operating officer, is quoted by the magazine 
as saying:

"We started younger, and I think we were wrong to do that. We tried to 
activate a young audience with a relatively old asset in the Evening Standard – 
we've moved away from that and they're becoming much more in line."

He also said: "We've been going for four months – bits of it are working, bits 
of it aren't. My job is to make the bits that aren't working work."

One example of is the launch of a 20-part property series, which builds on the 
Standard's status as the bible for the capital's estate agents.

Kirkman also told Campaign's writer, Arif Durrani, of the problems he faces 
with audience measurement: "The amount of money I'm getting through from 
straight 30-second spots to media agencies is less than I was hoping for... 
because of the issues that sit around Barb."

It was a problem aired by the outgoing chief executive, Andrew Mullins, back 
in April.

 Barb's London panel of 855 people is said by ESI Media, to be too small a 
sample to provide figures of its true audience.

But Kirkman says nothing can, at present anyway, be done about that:

"We've had conversations with Barb, [its stakeholders] Sky, BBC and ITV, and 
it won't make any difference at all. It's cost-prohibitive to change the 
set-up. We're fishing in a pond which is governed by Barb."

Kirkman is obviously willing to nail his colours to the mast. He told Durrani: 
"If, in nine months' time, I can't prove to my shareholders that there's a 
sustainable business here, I'll hold my hands up."

He also said ESI Media's ultimate owners, Kirkman, Alexander and Evgeny Lebedev
 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/evgeny-lebedev>, remain committed to London 
Live. "They have been very clear that they don't set up a business to shut it 
down," he said.

NB: I write a weekly column on the media for the Standard.
