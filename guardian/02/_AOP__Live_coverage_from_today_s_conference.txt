It's that time of year again - the one-day Association of Online Publishers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/aop> annual conference from London's Park 
Lane Hilton.

The AOP event is one of a handful of UK-organised events in this area, and 
always puts on a good show. Somewhere between the rabble-rousing keynotes and 
the nitty gritty of the panel sessions (probably around lunchtime) we do seem 
to actually learn some stuff, which is always a bonus when you spend an entire 
day at the conference.

Anyway, lined up today is Washingtonpost and Newsweek chief executive Caroline 
Little on managing both a hyper local and global brand, a discussion on 
aggregators including Joshua Cohen from Google News and a session exploring 
exactly what has changed in the digital era. Speakers include, well - just 
about everyone from UK online publishing. Let's hope they're on form.
