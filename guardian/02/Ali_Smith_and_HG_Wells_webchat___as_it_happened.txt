"For the restoration and modernisation of human civilisation, this exaggerated 
outlawing of the fellow citizen whom we see fit to suspect as a traitor or 
revolutionary and also of the stranger within our gates, has to be restrained 
and brought back within the scheme of human rights."HG Wells

'The very notion of the dismantling of human rights is an obscenity.'

Our very own samjordison <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/669781> has 
a question:

This might be an impossible question to answer briefly, but could you say 
something about why you think Wells’s The Rights of Man remains so important...
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13818475> Guardian contributor 
AliSmith1  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13818475> 27 September 2016

Hi Sam
Right now they're working on dismantling the Human Rights Act again. The very 
notion of the dismantling of human rights is an obscenity. Look at the movement 
of 65 million people across the world. Then look up Shakespeare's speech for 
the play of Sir Thomas More, its description of refugees, and its final words: 
"Mountainish inhumanity". Think about Wells's long life and his visionary 
capability. The man who could see everything coming, and whose visionary acumen 
proves itself time after time. At the end, facing fascism, in the middle of the 
second world war, he began drafting what would become, after his death, the UN 
International Declaration of Human Rights. He was a man who learned from his 
own history. We have to be sure we don't act numbly and blindly towards ours.

Ali wrote a piece for the Guardian in 2015 about The Rights of Man, if you’d 
like to read about it further:

'Scottish writing is vibrantly generous, multivoiced, multiformed. What a time 
to be a reader.'

RabBurnout <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4547976> asks a few 
questions:

Hi Ali, would it be true to say that you share with Wells a concern with the 
marginalised in society in your work? Do you like Wells more for his 
‘progressive’ ideas than for his novel writing?

I read somewhere that you moved away from Scotland because you felt it wasn’t 
conducive to your writing - is this true? and if so, why was this?

Are there any past or present Scottish writers who have influenced you? I 
think I see similarities with quite a few modern Scottish writers, such as 
Janice Galloway for instance. Do you think you are a part of something in 
Scottish culture in the 80’s/90’s that enabled this fine body of work to come 
to fruition? Or do you not feel a relationship with it at all?

Hello Rab (I like your name).
I love Wells's pull towards the democratic, even at his most pessimistic, his 
interest in "our collective life", plus his eye for the notion that "our true 
nationality is mankind". And I like very much how he finds fictional form for 
things so contemporary they haven't even happened yet. I don't feel like I've 
ever left Scotland. I'm there all the time. And wherever I am in the world I 
write because I'm Scottish, and what I write is formed of the time and the 
place that made me, and the people - above all, if there's any originality in 
it, it originates in the gift of a Scottish literary inheritance which gives 
its writers the ability and the tools to do anything they like. Grassic Gibbon, 
Spark, McIlvanney, Gray, Lochhead, George Mackay Brown - look at the range, 
vocal and formal, and the engagement of just these few writers; for me it's 
just the tip of the influence, and I know how lucky I am to have had that gift 
straight to the bloodstream. Scottish writing is vibrantly generous, 
multivoiced, multiformed. What a time to be a reader. I remember sitting in a 
theatre in Aberdeen in 1984 or 5, Kelman and Gray reading to us, and thinking 
to myself anything and everything is possible now. That's how formative. That's 
how freeing. That's how part of it I feel. Thank you Rab for asking so kindly.

Swelter, I ask myself the same question. Probably Wells wants us to question 
the word, and whether it rhymes with crap or not.

Did Wells’ contemporaries interpret “The War of the Worlds” as a jab at 
imperialism?

Dear Robert
I don't know. Patrick Parrinder will, though - find one of the Critical 
Heritage books where they collect reviews and critical pieces, contemporaneous 
to publication. It's hard to see how his contemporaries could have avoided its 
clear critique, though.

Rattandy <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3883997> wants to know:

For writers in general, what can we learn from HG Wells 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/hgwells> of the craft, at whatever stage of 
experience we are? Also, are there any must-read Wells passages for learning 
writers?

Hello Rattandy
We can learn an open double-mindedness. Wells is never one-sided and his 
idealism and hope are always tempered by pessimism and vice versa. Passages? I 
like the opening of War of the Worlds.

Ali, I have read Hotel World, Artful and How to Be Both. A friend of mine who 
does not read living writers is currently loving How to Be Both. This 
constitutes a crisis. You have unleashed the unexpected and her cat has taken 
to sleeping across the book. When I read you I am not only at play or part of 
an experiment or finding warmth or meeting parts of myself or being sung to. 
There is an utter lack of snobbery in your work that enables it to transcend 
and to resonate.

Rebekah!
What a lovely question. Title: Penetrate my Heart (from the first song in 
"Once More with Feeling", of course) Buffy still amazes me - a masterclass in 
creating an essentially good character whose side we're on - likeHG Wells 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/hgwells> an understanding of heroism as 
flawed and human. Its theme would be how we are drawn to empathise, sympathise, 
by stories which get us by the heart and mean a change of heart.

Kudos to machenbach <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16064333> for 
suggesting an excellent alternative title:

How to Be Both (Vampire Slayer and Teenager)?

Yes and no. I'm terribly concerned about the loss to all of us of public 
library richness. But Wells will never be left behind. And hard copy books will 
never lose out to their cousin e-books. We love books as objects. But we have 
to be canny now, preserve their availability for all of us, in whatever form. 
Wells exists because of a culture that worked to form a mass readership and 
that's why I exist too, and you, and the public library system is a big part of 
that, a true historic amelioration for all of us. What we need to find is a way 
to replicate, preserve and adapt that open availability and fairness right now. 
Wells saw human history as "more and more a race between education and 
catastrophe". The library, the "world encyclopaedia" - we need it more than 
ever right now, when education in this country is turning its head towards the 
selective mode again.

I’d like to ask Ali Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alismith> why she

Hi Magpie and Eric
I like all the streams, and Wells's stream is deceptive. While he looks like a 
clunky stage conjurer sometimes, and you're shaking your head at the visible 
machinations, suddenly you realise that somehow, invisibly, while you were 
looking elsewhere, he's made magic happen.

'I bet Rebecca West took HG Wells to task every day for his sexism.'

Goldendays49 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12196965> had a couple 
of questions directed to the man himself (bit problematic, since he died a 
while back):

I’d like to ask HG Wells more about his relationship with Rebecca West 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jun/10/rebecca-west-forgotten-vorticist>
 and what he thinks of Kindle.

Hello Goldendays
I looked up what he wrote especially for you and it sounds like they had some 
very golden days together as well as some pretty fierce ones. They met when he 
invited her to come and explain why she'd called him "pseudo-scientific" in a 
critical piece. "We came to like each other extremely and to be extremely 
exasperated and antagonistic". In the end he called it "the warmest, liveliest 
and most irreplaceable of fellowships... the world was full of men she couldn't 
talk to as she talked to me, and of women I had only a brief and simple use 
for." I bet she took him to task every day for his sexism. But I get the sense 
too that he was quite a chap, since so many intelligent women took so 
warmheartedly to him. ps. I'd say he thinks Kindles are great since he foresaw 
them after all in World Brain.

Hello Modernista
The US wanted to create their own copy - Canada kept Vartan and Hardy. But I 
was really happy the US publisher chose a Del Cossa - St Lucy's eyes. Such a 
striking image.

And that cover now, for those who haven’t seen the US version:

question:

Borges said The Invisible Man, The First Men in the Moon, The Time Ma­chine, 
and The Island of Dr. Moreau were Wells’ best novels. Do you think they are? 
Borges also said Wells’ books were the first ones he ever read, and might be 
the last.

Hi Eric (again)
He also said he thought they outlanguaged language - that they'd transfer 
through time and last like fables, pass "into the general memory of the species 
and even transcend" the extinction of English! I find the first books Wells 
wrote astonishing. Classic after classic, and that was his debut period.

Hi Sam
Right now they're working on dismantling the Human Rights Act again. The very 
notion of the dismantling of human rights is an obscenity. Look at the movement 
of 65 million people across the world. Then look up Shakespeare's speech for 
the play of Sir Thomas More, its description of refugees, and its final words: 
"Mountainish inhumanity". Think about Wells's long life and his visionary 
capability. The man who could see everything coming, and whose visionary acumen 
proves itself time after time. At the end, facing fascism, in the middle of the 
second world war, he began drafting what would become, after his death, the UN 
International Declaration of Human Rights. He was a man who learned from his 
own history. We have to be sure we don't act numbly and blindly towards ours.

Ali wrote a piece for the Guardian in 2015 about The Rights of Man, if you’d 
like to read about it further:

hello trueshortstory
Form is the shape that feeling takes. Thank you for your lovely and 
beautifully-formed question.
 
RabBurnout <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4547976> asks a few 
questions:

Hi Ali, would it be true to say that you share with Wells a concern with the 
marginalised in society in your work? Do you like Wells more for his 
‘progressive’ ideas than for his novel writing?

I read somewhere that you moved away from Scotland because you felt it wasn’t 
conducive to your writing - is this true? and if so, why was this?

Are there any past or present Scottish writers who have influenced you? I 
think I see similarities with quite a few modern Scottish writers, such as 
Janice Galloway for instance. Do you think you are a part of something in 
Scottish culture in the 80’s/90’s that enabled this fine body of work to come 
to fruition? Or do you not feel a relationship with it at all?

Hello Rab (I like your name).
I love Wells's pull towards the democratic, even at his most pessimistic, his 
interest in "our collective life", plus his eye for the notion that "our true 
nationality is mankind". And I like very much how he finds fictional form for 
things so contemporary they haven't even happened yet. I don't feel like I've 
ever left Scotland. I'm there all the time. And wherever I am in the world I 
write because I'm Scottish, and what I write is formed of the time and the 
place that made me, and the people - above all, if there's any originality in 
it, it originates in the gift of a Scottish literary inheritance which gives 
its writers the ability and the tools to do anything they like. Grassic Gibbon, 
Spark, McIlvanney, Gray, Lochhead, George Mackay Brown - look at the range, 
vocal and formal, and the engagement of just these few writers; for me it's 
just the tip of the influence, and I know how lucky I am to have had that gift 
straight to the bloodstream. Scottish writing is vibrantly generous, 
multivoiced, multiformed. What a time to be a reader. I remember sitting in a 
theatre in Aberdeen in 1984 or 5, Kelman and Gray reading to us, and thinking 
to myself anything and everything is possible now. That's how formative. That's 
how freeing. That's how part of it I feel. Thank you Rab for asking so kindly.

Swelter, I ask myself the same question. Probably Wells wants us to question 
the word, and whether it rhymes with crap or not.

Dear Robert
I don't know. Patrick Parrinder will, though - find one of the Critical 
Heritage books where they collect reviews and critical pieces, contemporaneous 
to publication. It's hard to see how his contemporaries could have avoided its 
clear critique, though.
 
Rattandy <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3883997> wants to know:

For writers in general, what can we learn from HG Wells 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/hgwells> of the craft, at whatever stage of 
experience we are? Also, are there any must-read Wells passages for learning 
writers?

Hello Rattandy
We can learn an open double-mindedness. Wells is never one-sided and his 
idealism and hope are always tempered by pessimism and vice versa. Passages? I 
like the opening of War of the Worlds.

Whatever I read of Wells, I'm left surprised and unpreconcepted. Forgive that 
new word.
 
KathrynMartins <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16749278> is a fan:

Ali, I have read Hotel World, Artful and How to Be Both. A friend of mine who 
does not read living writers is currently loving How to Be Both. This 
constitutes a crisis. You have unleashed the unexpected and her cat has taken 
to sleeping across the book. When I read you I am not only at play or part of 
an experiment or finding warmth or meeting parts of myself or being sung to. 
There is an utter lack of snobbery in your work that enables it to transcend 
and to resonate.

I’m a big fan, of both your fiction and your hybrid/essay-fiction, and I know

Rebekah!
What a lovely question. Title: Penetrate my Heart (from the first song in 
"Once More with Feeling", of course) Buffy still amazes me - a masterclass in 
creating an essentially good character whose side we're on - likeHG Wells 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/hgwells> an understanding of heroism as 
flawed and human. Its theme would be how we are drawn to empathise, sympathise, 
by stories which get us by the heart and mean a change of heart.

Kudos to machenbach <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16064333> for 
suggesting an excellent alternative title:

How to Be Both (Vampire Slayer and Teenager)?
 
FrozenWilds <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3628698> asks:

I am reading (and really enjoying) your Public Library collection just now. 
Are you concerned that classics like Wells’ books will be left behind as 
libraries shut and as hard copy books become less popular than e-books? I am.

Hello Frozenwilds
Yes and no. I'm terribly concerned about the loss to all of us of public 
library richness. But Wells will never be left behind. And hard copy books will 
never lose out to their cousin e-books. We love books as objects. But we have 
to be canny now, preserve their availability for all of us, in whatever form. 
Wells exists because of a culture that worked to form a mass readership and 
that's why I exist too, and you, and the public library system is a big part of 
that, a true historic amelioration for all of us. What we need to find is a way 
to replicate, preserve and adapt that open availability and fairness right now. 
Wells saw human history as "more and more a race between education and 
catastrophe". The library, the "world encyclopaedia" - we need it more than 
ever right now, when education in this country is turning its head towards the 
selective mode again.

I’d like to ask Ali Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alismith> why she 
likes Wells as a writer. She writes such flowing, stream-of-consciousness, 
poetic prose. I’d say it’s almost the exact opposite of Wells’ more ponderous, 
plan and illustrate an idea style.

Hi Magpie and Eric
I like all the streams, and Wells's stream is deceptive. While he looks like a 
clunky stage conjurer sometimes, and you're shaking your head at the visible 
machinations, suddenly you realise that somehow, invisibly, while you were 
looking elsewhere, he's made magic happen.
 
Goldendays49 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12196965> had a couple 
of questions directed to the man himself (bit problematic, since he died a

I’d like to ask HG Wells more about his relationship with Rebecca West 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jun/10/rebecca-west-forgotten-vorticist>
 and what he thinks of Kindle.

Hello Goldendays
I looked up what he wrote especially for you and it sounds like they had some 
very golden days together as well as some pretty fierce ones. They met when he 
invited her to come and explain why she'd called him "pseudo-scientific" in a 
critical piece. "We came to like each other extremely and to be extremely 
exasperated and antagonistic". In the end he called it "the warmest, liveliest 
and most irreplaceable of fellowships... the world was full of men she couldn't 
talk to as she talked to me, and of women I had only a brief and simple use 
for." I bet she took him to task every day for his sexism. But I get the sense 
too that he was quite a chap, since so many intelligent women took so 
warmheartedly to him. ps. I'd say he thinks Kindles are great since he foresaw 
them after all in World Brain.

Erm, I’m just going to try and sneak in a non-HG Wells related question

Hello Modernista
The US wanted to create their own copy - Canada kept Vartan and Hardy. But I 
was really happy the US publisher chose a Del Cossa - St Lucy's eyes. Such a 
striking image.

And that cover now, for those who haven’t seen the US version:
 
Eric Batt <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15177998> has another 
question:

Borges said The Invisible Man, The First Men in the Moon, The Time Ma­chine, 
and The Island of Dr. Moreau were Wells’ best novels. Do you think they are? 
Borges also said Wells’ books were the first ones he ever read, and might be 
the last.

Hi Eric (again)
He also said he thought they outlanguaged language - that they'd transfer 
through time and last like fables, pass "into the general memory of the species 
and even transcend" the extinction of English! I find the first books Wells 
wrote astonishing. Classic after classic, and that was his debut period.
