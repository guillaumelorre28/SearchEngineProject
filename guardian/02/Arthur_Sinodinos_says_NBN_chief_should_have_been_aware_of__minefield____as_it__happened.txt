Night time politics

 * Ziggy Switkowski is in hot water after a letter from the head of the 
department of prime minister and cabinet (PMC) Martin Parkinson revealed PMC 
had advised Switkowski that his opinion piece published during on the NBN 
breached elements of the caretaker conventions. At the same time, NBN CEOBill 
Morrow may have to return 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/15/nbn-co-executive-likely-to-be-called-as-witness-after-us-utility-disaster>
 to the US as a witness in legal action over a utility disaster. Cabinet 
secretary Arthur Sinodinos says Switkowski should have realised he was walking 
into a minefield. Both Morrow and Switkowski were appointed by Malcolm Turnbull 
as communications minister. Tomorrow’s campaign presser will be riveting.

 * The Liberal software data company Parakeelia has been referred to the 
auditor general by Labor after a week of questions over payments by the company 
to the Liberal party. Liberal MPs pay for services rendered, then Parakeelia 
makes payments back to the party. Liberal party insists the payments are not 
donations but the opaque nature of law means we don’t know. Questions to 
Liberal HQ have gone unanswered.

 * Scott Morrison conducted another pantomime press conference bollocking 
Labor and the Greens. He released an attack ad.

 * Bob Katter has caused a stir with an ad that suggests the indie MP shooting 
two people representing the major parties.

That is it for today. To those of you going to the Guardian Live event in 
Sydney with the keeper of this blogKatharine Murphy and our political editor 
Lenore Taylor - enjoy. 


Thanks for your company.

NBNCo answers for Ziggy Switkowski

The NBNCo has put out a statement regarding its chairman Ziggy Switkowski.

A spokeswoman said:

The Caretaker Guidelines state that: “[government companies] …should observe 
the conventions and practices unless to do so would conflict with their legal 
obligations or compelling organisational requirements”.

Building the nbn is an unprecedented task and can only be achieved with a 
highly engaged and motivated staff.Inaccurate comments that accuse the company 
of deliberately misleading, deliberately concealing, and then persecuting 
innocent whistle-blowers have a tremendously corrosive effect on morale and 
jeopardise the great gains made over the last few years. The opinion piece 
addressed misleading claims to restore the trust of its 5000 employees.

Any accusation that the company’s staff, management, its board and (by 
implication) its shareholder departments have conspired to keep large cost 
increases secret from the Australian people is not only plainly and 
demonstrably false, but is a serious accusation in light of the Corporations act
 (for example section 184). This is obviously not acceptable and the opinion 
piece addressed the allegations in a manner commensurate with the mode in which 
they were made; that is, publicly in the national media.

Sinodinos defends Switkowski

Arthur Sinodinos has defended Ziggy Switkowski on the NBN.

(Ziggy Switkowski) and Martin (Parkinson) have taken slightly different 
interpretations (of caretaker conventions).

When pushed, Sinodinos says Ziggy probably is “uncomfortable” about it.

Q: Should he have done this?

I’m not inside his head. 

Q: Do you think he did anything wrong

I don’t think he did anything wrong but I think he should have realised he was 
walking into a minefield.

Why plunge Australia into worse deficits, asks Speers?

We are not taking the sledge hammer approach to the economy that Malcolm

Cabinet secretary Arthur Sinodinos says he believes Britain should stay in the 
EU but it is a matter for the British people. But given Britain has a “very 
special place in Australian history”, that will not change.

Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon agrees it is up to the British people and also agrees, 
it is not in the interests of Britain to exit the EU.

They are speaking to David Speers on Sky. Sinodinos says the fundamentals of 
the Australian economy are good, in the case of an “external shock” from a 
Brexit. Speers wants to know whether there would be any stimulus to protect 
Australia from recession. Steady as she goes, is the Sinodinos message. 
Fitzgibbon is not being drawn in either.

Double back to Parakeelia. Those with the blog yesterday will know Katharine 
was trying to ascertain some details regarding the payments made from 
Parakeelia to the Liberal party. You may remember theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> spokesman said the 
payments were not donations but fell into the category of “other receipts”.

Katharine reported the definition of other receipts, according to the AEC. 


This term refers to those amounts received by a party or associated entity 
which do not meet the legislative definition of ‘gift’ (commonly referred to as 
donation). Examples of amounts which fall into the category of ‘other receipts’ 
are interest on investments, dividends on shares, market rate rent received on 
properties owned. All other receipts disclosed in the return must show the 
gross amount.

Yesterday she sent this question: which category [above] do the payments from 
Parakeelia to the party fall into?

I sent the same question today. Nada.

No answer came the stern reply.

Lenore Taylor has rolled out a few facts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/15/election-2016-scott-morrison-coalition-greens-scare-campaign-parody>
 regarding the Coalition’s Labor/Greens/independents scare ads, so ably 
unveiled byScott Morrison this morning. Lenore points out that the Coalition 
may well have to govern with the help of independents so best not ramp up the 
rhetoric too high. The conclusion, maybe the result will be closer than we 
think.

NBN Co's chief executive, Bill Morrow, likely to be called as witness for US 
utility disaster

From Katharine Murphy and Gareth Hutchens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/15/nbn-co-executive-likely-to-be-called-as-witness-after-us-utility-disaster>
:

The executive appointed by Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> to run NBN Co 
appears likely to be called as a witness in legal actions now under way in the 
US, flowing from one of the worst utility disasters in the country’s history.

Legal actions have begun 
<http://www.eastbaytimes.com/breaking-news/ci_30014347/pg-e-criminal-trial-linked-san-bruno-disaster?source=rss&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter>
 in San Francisco involving Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), a company Bill 
Morrow joined in 2006 as chief operating officer, before becoming chief 
executive a year later. Morrow left PG&E in September 2008.

Morrow was appointed to run Australia’s largest infrastructure project, the 
NBN rollout, in December 2013, by the then communications minister, Malcolm 
Turnbull.

NBN Co confirmed on Wednesday that Morrow expected to be called as a witness 
in the PG&E proceedings in the US, which are expected to last between six and 
eight weeks.

According to US media reports, PG&E faces 13 criminal counts in the trial, 
including 12 charges the gas utility violated safety regulations and one charge 
of obstruction. The company has pleaded not guilty.

 * Ziggy Switkowski is in hot water after a letter from the head of the 
department of prime minister and cabinet (PMC) Martin Parkinson revealed PMC 
had advised Switkowski that his opinion piece published during on the NBN 
breached elements of the caretaker conventions. At the same time, NBN CEOBill 
Morrow may have to return 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/15/nbn-co-executive-likely-to-be-called-as-witness-after-us-utility-disaster>
 to the US as a witness in legal action over a utility disaster. Cabinet 
secretary Arthur Sinodinos says Switkowski should have realised he was walking 
into a minefield. Both Morrow and Switkowski were appointed by Malcolm Turnbull 
as communications minister. Tomorrow’s campaign presser will be riveting.

 * The Liberal software data company Parakeelia has been referred to the 
auditor general by Labor after a week of questions over payments by the company 
to the Liberal party. Liberal MPs pay for services rendered, then Parakeelia 
makes payments back to the party. Liberal party insists the payments are not 
donations but the opaque nature of law means we don’t know. Questions to 
Liberal HQ have gone unanswered.

 * Scott Morrison conducted another pantomime press conference bollocking 
Labor and the Greens. He released an attack ad.

 * Bob Katter has caused a stir with an ad that suggests the indie MP shooting 
two people representing the major parties.

That is it for today. To those of you going to the Guardian Live event in 
Sydney with the keeper of this blogKatharine Murphy and our political editor 
Lenore Taylor - enjoy. 


Thanks for your company.

The NBNCo has put out a statement regarding its chairman Ziggy Switkowski.

A spokeswoman said:

The Caretaker Guidelines state that: “[government companies] …should observe 
the conventions and practices unless to do so would conflict with their legal 
obligations or compelling organisational requirements”.

Building the nbn is an unprecedented task and can only be achieved with a 
highly engaged and motivated staff.Inaccurate comments that accuse the company 
of deliberately misleading, deliberately concealing, and then persecuting 
innocent whistle-blowers have a tremendously corrosive effect on morale and 
jeopardise the great gains made over the last few years. The opinion piece 
addressed misleading claims to restore the trust of its 5000 employees.

Any accusation that the company’s staff, management, its board and (by 
implication) its shareholder departments have conspired to keep large cost 
increases secret from the Australian people is not only plainly and 
demonstrably false, but is a serious accusation in light of the Corporations act
 (for example section 184). This is obviously not acceptable and the opinion 
piece addressed the allegations in a manner commensurate with the mode in which 
they were made; that is, publicly in the national media.

Arthur Sinodinos is asked about Parakeelia, which has now been referred to the 
auditor general by Labor.

Q: You don’t think it looks bad?

On the basis of the info provided to me, I don’t think it does.
 
Arthur Sinodinos has defended Ziggy Switkowski on the NBN.

(Ziggy Switkowski) and Martin (Parkinson) have taken slightly different 
interpretations (of caretaker conventions).

When pushed, Sinodinos says Ziggy probably is “uncomfortable” about it.

Q: Should he have done this?

I’m not inside his head. 

Q: Do you think he did anything wrong

I don’t think he did anything wrong but I think he should have realised he was 
walking into a minefield.
 
Joel Fitzgibbon is talking about the delicate nature of the global economy. 
Why plunge Australia into worse deficits, asks Speers?

We are not taking the sledge hammer approach to the economy that Malcolm 
Turnbull has chosen.
 
Cabinet secretary Arthur Sinodinos says he believes Britain should stay in the 
EU but it is a matter for the British people. But given Britain has a “very 
special place in Australian history”, that will not change.

Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon agrees it is up to the British people and also agrees, 
it is not in the interests of Britain to exit the EU.

They are speaking to David Speers on Sky. Sinodinos says the fundamentals of 
the Australian economy are good, in the case of an “external shock” from a 
Brexit. Speers wants to know whether there would be any stimulus to protect 
Australia from recession. Steady as she goes, is the Sinodinos message. 
Fitzgibbon is not being drawn in either.

Double back to Parakeelia. Those with the blog yesterday will know Katharine 
was trying to ascertain some details regarding the payments made from 
Parakeelia to the Liberal party. You may remember theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> spokesman said the 
payments were not donations but fell into the category of “other receipts”.

Katharine reported the definition of other receipts, according to the AEC. 


This term refers to those amounts received by a party or associated entity 
which do not meet the legislative definition of ‘gift’ (commonly referred to as 
donation). Examples of amounts which fall into the category of ‘other receipts’ 
are interest on investments, dividends on shares, market rate rent received on 
properties owned. All other receipts disclosed in the return must show the 
gross amount.

Yesterday she sent this question: which category [above] do the payments from 
Parakeelia to the party fall into?

I sent the same question today. Nada.

No answer came the stern reply. 
 
Lenore Taylor has rolled out a few facts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/15/election-2016-scott-morrison-coalition-greens-scare-campaign-parody>
 regarding the Coalition’s Labor/Greens/independents scare ads, so ably 
unveiled byScott Morrison this morning. Lenore points out that the Coalition 
may well have to govern with the help of independents so best not ramp up the 
rhetoric too high. The conclusion, maybe the result will be closer than we 
think.

:

The executive appointed by Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> to run NBN Co 
appears likely to be called as a witness in legal actions now under way in the 
US, flowing from one of the worst utility disasters in the country’s history.

Legal actions have begun 
<http://www.eastbaytimes.com/breaking-news/ci_30014347/pg-e-criminal-trial-linked-san-bruno-disaster?source=rss&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter>
 in San Francisco involving Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), a company Bill 
Morrow joined in 2006 as chief operating officer, before becoming chief 
executive a year later. Morrow left PG&E in September 2008.

Morrow was appointed to run Australia’s largest infrastructure project, the 
NBN rollout, in December 2013, by the then communications minister, Malcolm 
Turnbull.

NBN Co confirmed on Wednesday that Morrow expected to be called as a witness 
in the PG&E proceedings in the US, which are expected to last between six and 
eight weeks.

According to US media reports, PG&E faces 13 criminal counts in the trial, 
including 12 charges the gas utility violated safety regulations and one charge 
of obstruction. The company has pleaded not guilty.
