Watch the ads. Win the ads. Bob your head and cross your eyes as the programme 
and the ads melt into an unending dazzle-loop of brand ambassadorship. Suzuki, 
eminent sponsor of Saturday Night Takeaway, isn’t gonna be banjaxed by the show 
resting between series: all year it’s been aggressively synergising via Suzuki 
Saturdays, shortform vids in which punters are merked by bothAnt and Dec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ant-and-dec>.

A new episode takes us to a manicured brick estate in Derbyshire, where a 
bride has somehow been inveigled into being filmed watching a Suzuki draw up, 
but does not expect Ant and Dec to be inside. This delighted stooge is then 
driven to a village church by the nation’s favourite two-headed presenting unit 
– in a Vitara, a car that can boast sufficient legroom for Ant and Dec. Not 
even Ant’s beard, which after four months on public display is still at the 
scraggly “student” level, dents the joy.

For the happy couple, confetti moments like their exit from the ceremony and 
the wedding-party photos are enhanced by the inclusion of Dec and, indeed, Ant, 
while the car for sale gleams in the road outside. Watch the ads. Win the ads. 
Marry the ads.
