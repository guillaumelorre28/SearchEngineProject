The apartment wasn't much to look at when the young composer Gil Evans took it 
over in 1947, just a room with bare heating pipes behind a Chinese laundry at 
14 West 55th Street in midtown Manhattan. Over the next two years, however, it 
would be the headquarters for a group of adventurous young musicians and 
composers, including John Lewis, Gerry Mulligan and George Russell, as well as 
giving Charlie Parker a place to stash his drugs.

The most salient manifestation of this informal salon was Miles Davis's 
short-lived but influential nine-piece band, which made its debut at the Royal 
Roost club on Broadway in 1948. Featuring such up-and-coming individuals as JJ 
Johnson on trombone, Lee Konitz on alto sax and Max Roach on drums, it served 
primarily as a showcase for its young arrangers.

Although the project was not a commercial success, the following year a dozen 
sides were recorded for the Capitol label. Eventually assembled into an album 
titled Birth of the Cool, the airy, unhurried arrangements by Evans, Lewis and 
others inspired the "cool jazz" movement of the 1950s.
