Before Commontime was made, Field Music brothers Peter and David Brewis spent 
some time apart, working on solo projects or collaborations. It seems absence 
makes the creative juices flow faster, as their first release since2012’s Plumb 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/09/field-music-plumb-review> is 
perhaps their most accessible to date, without sacrificing any of their skewed 
pop vision.

“As much fun as we might have had on our own or collaborating, we missed just 
spending time in the studio, the two of us, trying things out together,” says 
David.

Commontime is surprisingly funky – with shades of James Chance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/18/mofo-2016-the-jay-gatsby-of-hobart-opens-his-doors-to-the-avant-garde>
 and Talking Heads – but it’s not just the music that has shifted its focus. 
Moving away from Plumb’s broader, more political subject matter, Field Music 
are now focusing on more domestic concerns: growing up, settling down, looking 
after family members and – on Stay Awake – the effect of late-night nappy 
changes on your relationship with your wife.

To those in the know, Field Music 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/field-music> are one of the country’s most 
cherished alternative bands, and this album only serves to make that case 
stronger. Have a listen using the player below and let us know your thoughts.

Commontime is released through Memphis Industries. The band are on tour from 
25 February <http://www.field-music.co.uk/>.
