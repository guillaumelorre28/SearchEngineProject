Today K, for keyword component... which was the first visible feature we 
released as part of the R2 project. That was way back in May 2006, and it 
appeared on articles in the Travel section.

The keyword component was simply a box listing keywords associated with the 
article, but to get even to that modest point was a long journey. Here are some 
of the things we needed to build to get there.



 * A continuous integration pipeline, which automatically took the software at 
any time from source code to deployable bundle via automated testing and 
reporting; 
 * A tool to create and manage keywords -- some keywords would need to take 
the user to specific landing pages, others to a page of search results; 
 * A tool to add keywords to articles -- the tool running in our new system, 
the article editor running in our old system, and the two integrating 
seamlessly; 
 * A manageable abstration layer at the web server level that allowed pages 
from the legacy content management system to include components from the new R2 
system. 
Naturally this component didn't change the world, but it did provide 
validation for our entire development pipeline. And the component survives 
today, in a more sophisticated form, on all our content, where you can use it 
to navigate to related subjects.
