The Australian share market has plunged at the start of trade, with losses 
felt across the board from banks to resources stock as uncertainty grips global 
markets.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 and the All Ordinaries indices fell more than 2.4% 
in the first 20 minutes of trade on Monday.

Banking giants including the Commonwealth, Westpac, National Australia Bank 
and ANZ along with the big miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton all shed about 2% 
each.

Telstra also dropped, by more than 1%.

Wall Street endured a torrid stretch last week when the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average lost more than 1,000 points and the S&P 500 fell below 2,000 points for 
the first time since January 30.

As well as fielding renewed fears about China’s economy and a possible exit 
from the eurozone by Greece, investors were unsettled by US oil prices, which 
on Friday dipped below $US40 for the first time in six years.

CommSec chief economist Craig James said that despite the uncertainty on 
global markets, the US and Australian economies remained in good shape.

He also believed worries about Greece and China were overdone.

“At present, we would view the global sharemarket correction as a correction 
we had to have – a situation that will be beneficial in injecting more value 
into markets,” James said.

“There are clearly risks, but the data indicate that US and European economies 
continue to recover, lower oil prices will serve to boost consumer and business 
spending, and Chinese authorities are trying a range of measures to maintain 
momentum in their economy.”

Treasurer Joe Hockey <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/joe-hockey> 
said that while markets would go up and down, the fundamentals were still good 
for the global economy, particularly the US.

He said several factors would cause volatility in the markets in the next few 
months, particularly if the US Federal Reserve decided to move on interest 
rates in September.

“If they do increase their interest rates, then you’ll see movement of money 
from equity markets, probably into bond markets,” he said.

Such volatility would hit confidence in Australia, he said, and that’s why the 
government had to keep reminding people that our economy is one of the 
fastest-growing in the world right now.

In profit results, Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Metals suffered an 88% slide in 
its full-year profit in the face of sliding iron ore prices.

The iron ore miner made a net profit of US$316m (A$433.29m) for the year to 30 
June, down from US$2.74bn a year ago.

The company has cut its fully franked dividend to two cents a share, from 10 
cents a share last year.
