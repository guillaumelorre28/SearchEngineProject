Beverley Knight, the pop singer who has forged a strong second career in the 
West End, is to star as Grizabella in the ongoing London Palladium production 
of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical Cats.

Nicole Scherzinger previously starred in the role when the revival opened last 
year, and was succeeded by Wicked star Kerry Ellis. Knight’s rumoured 
involvement was confirmed by Baz Bamigboye of the Daily Mail, who posted an 
image of Knight in full feline getup on Twitter:

Knight was first known for her soul-pop hits like Shoulda Woulda Coulda and 
Greatest Day, but has recently made a successful transition to the West End 
stage. She starred in The Bodyguard in 2013, and then took the lead in Memphis, 
a musical charting the rise of R&B in the deep south of the US. It garnered the 
most nominations of any one production at theOlivier awards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/olivier-awards> this year, including one for 
Knight who eventually lost out to Katie Brayben in the best actress in a 
musical category.

Knight will play Grizabella – whose songs include the classic Memory – from 23 
October onwards, for a ten week run.
