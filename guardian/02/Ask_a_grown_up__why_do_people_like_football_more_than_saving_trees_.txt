replies: I love football very much, but I'm also keen on trees. And if God said 
to me, "You can have a world without football or a world without trees: you 
choose", I'd have to save the trees.

If people do prefer football to trees, I think it's an indication that human 
beings crave uncertainty. They want to feel the joy of triumph and the pain of 
failure. Football gives you that; trees don't. Trees are truly beautiful things 
and bring much pleasure, but where's the excitement? Year in, year out, they 
grow leaves and grow a little taller, then shed leaves, and they do it all over 
again the following year. They don't set your pulse racing.

You can love both football and trees equally, though. And to prove it I'm 
going to give the charityTrees For Cities <http://www.treesforcities.org/> £25 
for every goal West Brom score between now and the end of the season. That 
won't buy a forest, to be sure, but it might make a bit of a difference.
