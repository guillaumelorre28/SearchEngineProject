Fans of the unsettling thrillers of Patricia Highsmith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/highsmith-patricia> – and their many movie 
adaptations – should prepare for a new classic among Highsmith movies in Carol, 
Todd Haynes’s sombrely rapturous filming of the most atypical work in the 
author’s oeuvre, her early lesbian romance The Price Of Salt.

Carol: the women behind Patricia Highsmith's lesbian novel

Published in 1952 under a pseudonym 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/08/patricia-highsmith-tom-ripley-carol-price-of-salt-glass-cell>
, it enjoyed cult bestseller status with a largely lesbian readership for 30 
years. The pseudonym is understandable: only four years earlier, Gore Vidal was 
banished from the New York Times’ book review pages 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/14/gore-vidal-gripped-a-nation> for 
his gay melodrama The City And The Pillar, and Highsmith was no doubt aware of 
the vicious national anti-gay witch-hunts of the period. Worse, The Price Of 
Salt was published the same year that the American Psychiatric Association 
classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. And, unlike Vidal, Highsmith 
left open the possibility of a happy ending for her lovers – scandalous!

To call The Price Of Salt atypical isn’t quite true, though. There is no 
murder and none of its characters are tortured Dostoyevskian doppelgangers but 
there is plenty of the anxiety you find in her thrillers. Here it concerns the 
young protagonist Therese’s gradual, nervous acceptance of her sexuality in a 
world where she’s terrified even to discuss it, and whether or not her growing 
love for Carol will be reciprocated. It feels absolutely right that this 
project landed up in Haynes’s hands; it is tailor-made for his intelligence and 
sensibility, and is beautiful to boot.

Cate Blanchett as Carol and Rooney Mara 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/rooney-mara> as Highsmith’s alter ego Therese 
are the kind of actors essential to a successful Highsmith adaptation, the 
subtlest kind, whose inner emotions are legible on the outside. Therese’s 
yearning for the older, maternal Carol, torn apart by her divorce and custody 
battle, makes for a real emotional battlefield. Haynes has embedded them within 
a magically melancholy evocation of the vanished Gotham of the early postwar 
period, one of the most pleasurable aspects of Highsmith’s early novels, and 
one feels a humming atmosphere of bigotry, disapproval and misunderstanding all 
around them.

Todd Haynes: ‘She said, there’s a frock film coming up, with Cate attached … 
It sounded right up my alley’

Carol is one of the finest Highsmith adaptations, of which there have been 
many over the years. It belongs with Hitchcock’sStrangers On A Train 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/strangers-on-a-train>, with Liliana Caviani’s 
Ripley’s Game and Wim Wenders’s The American Friend (based on the same novel), 
and alongside Claude Chabrol’s The Cry Of The Owl and an excellent latecomer, 
Hossein Amini’s The Two Faces Of January. These movies succeeded because the 
malign spirit of Highsmith made it on to the screen intact (something not true 
of The Talented Mr Ripley, for example). Carol succeeds because it keeps intact 
the opposite: the youthful heartache of its as yet unbroken author.
