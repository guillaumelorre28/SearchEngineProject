The first performance of George Gershwin's concerto Rhapsody in Blue was given 
by Paul Whiteman's orchestra with the composer on piano at New York's Aeolian 
Hall on 12 February 1924, as part of a concert titled An Experiment in Modern 
Music, and marked the first significant partial rapprochement between jazz and 
classical music. Gershwin was not a jazz musician; his music is not jazz, but 
his inherent sensitivity to African-American music allowed him to createÂ music 
that was intelligently and rewardingly coloured by its textures and tonalities.
