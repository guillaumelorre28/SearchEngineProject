A rare diary chronicling a controversial stopover by American civil war 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/american-civil-war> sailors in Melbourne 
could soon be in Victorian hands.


Uncovered in Nashville by an Australian dealer, the diary of young lieutenant 
Dabney Scales tells the story of the Confederate ship CSS Shenandoah.

The highly successful commerce raider, which sank 38 Union merchant ships, 
only stopped in port once, inMelbourne

The three-week visit was divisive, with the crew honoured at gala balls while 
the US consul pleaded with Victorian authorities to impound the ship.

Though the stopover was well-documented by Victorian newspapers, no original 
material from the ship is held in Australian collections.

Making that a reality will cost about $75,000.

“Civil war documents like this very rarely come on to the market and would 
usually be snapped up by an American institution or private collector,” the 
State LibraryVictoria <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria> 
chief executive, Kate Torney, said in a statement on Monday.

The diary contains first-hand observations by Lieutenant Dabney M Scales as 
well as sketches, sailors’ accounts and photographs from his time on the 
Shenandoah crew.

The Shenandoah captured or sank 38 Union merchant ships before its surrender 
in Liverpool in November, 1865.
