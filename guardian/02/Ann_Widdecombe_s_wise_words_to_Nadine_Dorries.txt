Some sage words from Ann Widdecombe to the Conservative MP Nadine Dorries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nadine-dorries> who has just accepted 
ITV's invitation to be the first sitting MP to take part in I'm a Celebrity. 
According to the Daily Express, she cites several reasons not to do it, 
including time away from the constituency and the possibility that her dignity 
will not survive intact and she will be a figure of fun next time she has to 
deal with chief constables, ministers and media who will have a field day. Ann 
of course has some experience after letting Louis Theroux into her home, but 
she does speak with some degree of authority. She reveals she has turned down 
all requests to appear in I'm a Celebrity and Big Brother.
