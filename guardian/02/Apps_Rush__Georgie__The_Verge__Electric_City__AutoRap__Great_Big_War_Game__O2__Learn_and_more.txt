AutoRap <http://www.smule.com/autorap>

Music apps developer Smule's latest app apparently "turns speech into rap, and 
corrects bad rapping". Which means you talk or rap into your smartphone's 
microphone over beats and samples from the likes of Snoop Dogg and Outkast, and 
then have your mumblings snapped to the beat with a touch of Auto-Tune-style 
audio manipulation.
Android / iPhone

, now sprinter Usain Bolt has followed suit. It's an endless-runner game that 
sees Bolt trying to outrun a gang of "Caribbean pirates who are after his 
gold". Developer Rock Live hopes fans will spend their own money on in-app 
purchases of virtual coins.

<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobage.ww.a804.RAGNABREAK_Android>

of Bahamut leading the charge. Now its publisher DeNA has launched a new one on 
Android: Deity Wars. It involves collecting cards and fighting co-operative 
battles with friends.
Android

Mutant Roadkill 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glu.wasteland>

And still the Android games keep coming – it's a good week for Google-powered 
gaming. This is Glu Mobile's latest freemium game: a racing title set in "an 
apocalyptic wasteland overrun with mutants and other hazards". Or Bishop's 
Stortford's one-way system, as I know it.
Android

Toy Shot 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamevil.toyshot.glo&feature>

And one more for the road! Gamevil's Toy Shot is essentially Angry Birds meets 
definitely-not-Lego-because-that-would-spark-a-lawsuit. Firing rockets, 
cannonballs and other projectiles at toys and bricks, basically.
Android

Chirp <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chirp/id529469280?mt=8>

Intriguing: an app to "share your stuff – using sound". Chirp claims to sing 
information from one iPhone to another, including photos, links and notes. "The 
super-simple way to share that everyone's talking about," according to its 
blurb – optimistic, given that the app has only just been released.
iPhone

StyleTap <http://www.styletap.com/product_android.php>

Okay, so Android is fine, but what it's lacking is the ability to run apps 
written for the Palm OS platform, right? If you're nodding in agreement, 
StyleTap is worth a look: it's an emulator for apps written for the Palm OS 5.2 
platform and earlier versions. A snip at... $49.95?
Android
