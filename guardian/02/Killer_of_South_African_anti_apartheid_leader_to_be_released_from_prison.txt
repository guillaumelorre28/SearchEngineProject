igniting bitter memories of racial unrest during white rule as well as fresh 
scrutiny of the punishment for crimes committed in that era.

You may free apartheid killers but you can't force victims to forgive

A Pretoria judge ordered that Janusz Walus should be given parole within two 
weeks. His killing of Chris Hani stirred fears of all-out racial conflict at a 
time when delicate talks about a democratic transition were under way. Hani was 
head of the South African Communist party and of the military wing of the 
African National Congress, which became South Africa’s ruling party.

While Nelson Mandela <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nelsonmandela> and 
other leaders at the time managed to dampen the anger affecting the country, 
and euphoria ran high after the first all-race elections in 1994, the country 
still grapples with its troubled legacy. Recently there have been calls for 
prosecutions of figures from the apartheid-era government, reflecting a belief 
that the drive for reconciliation let some perpetrators off the hook and failed 
to improve the lives of many in the black majority.

The news that 60-year-old Walus, who has served 23 years of a life sentence, 
would be freed on parole this month is likely to add to the anger.

Hani’s wife, Limpho Hani, criticised the white judge who heard an appeal from 
Walus’s lawyer and overruled the South African justice ministry’s refusal to 
grant parole.

“She is nothing but a racist,” Hani’s wife said in an interview. “To her, 
black lives don’t matter. She hardly made mention of my husband’s murder in her 
judgment.”

She said: “The judiciary wants to rule this country through the back door 
because they undermine executive decisions.”
