Tony O'Reilly is finally severing his links to Independent News & Media, the 
Irish newspaper publisher he turned into a global media company.

According to articles in the Sunday Business Post <http://www.businesspost.ie/>
 andin the Irish edition of the Sunday Times 
<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/article1406715.ece>, he has 
begun selling down his holding in INM.

They report that his stake - held by Indexia, his investment vehicle - fell 
last week below 5% after the disposal of more than 9m shares for a reputed 
€1.5m (£1.2m). It is believed to be the first time he has sold off INM stock.

O'Reilly and his family lost control of INM in a bitter struggle with Denis 
O'Brien <https://www.theguardian.com/media/denis-o-brien>, the telecoms 
billionaire who is now Ireland's major media tycoon through his newspaper and 
radio interests.

It was in 1973 that O'Reilly first bought into Independent Newspapers, buying 
stock from descendants of the Irish Independent's founder, William Martin 
Murphy. He eventually created an international empire, with media outlets in 
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Britain, includingThe Independent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/theindependent>.

O'Reilly, who celebrates his 78th birthday on Wednesday, was forced to 
relinquish his roles as chief executive and director in 2009. His son, Gavin, 
took over as CEO but was ousted in 2012.
