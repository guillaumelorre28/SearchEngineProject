The Super Bowl <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/super-bowl> hospitality 
folks may have made it easy to stick close to the University of Phoenix’s 
Glendale stadium – where the game is to be held – and its entertainment 
district, with food and beer concessions. But to get to know the greater 
Phoenix area, you’ve got to tear yourself away and explore its neighbourhoods. 
I know what you’re thinking: “Wait, it’s a desert out there!” But the Valley of 
the Sun’s cultural dry spell is over, and a boozy loop through these bars will 
convince you that the desert can be cool.

PHOENIX

Jade Bar

Can a bar be Zen? Ponder this as you take in mountain views through 
floor-to-ceiling windows or from the secluded patio. You’ll find this slice of 
serenity at Sanctuary on Camelback, one of the world-class spas for which the 
valley is justifiably famous. The spa’s Jade Bar has great desert views and a 
4pm-6pm happy hour called The Pour, when late-afternoon sunshine bathes the 
desert in coppers, pinks, and purples. Drinks at Jade Bar are in keeping with 
the spa setting: fruity and herbaceous “muddles” (alcoholic or not) are a 
speciality, and the bartenders host mixology sessions on Sundays, or by 
appointment.

Though desert-modern style has helped the Phoenix area reset its architectural 
identity, you’ll still find herds of western-themed bars. For south-west 
ambience without the kitsch, seek out the Hermosa Inn and its Last Drop 
cocktail bar for drinks with a Sonoran desert twist. Mixologist Travis Nass 
creates award-winning recipes, sometimes adding ingredients fresh from the 
chef’s on-site garden. Try a Mango Mescal Madness, or a Haboob, a gin and 
cactus syrup concoction named after the epic sandstorms that roll across the 
valley each summer. An all-day menu of salads, burgers and pizzas will soak up 
the alcohol.

Bitter & Twisted and Crescent Ballroom, Downtown
 Bitter & Twisted cocktail bar 
Downtown Phoenix is an epicentre for Super Bowl events. Those looking for a 
more sophisticated option than the official beer garden can venture a few 
blocks west to Bitter & Twisted, where the drinks menu runs to 24 pages, and 
the modern-Asian small plates are as thoughtfully prepared and presented as the 
cocktails. The delicious irony is that this stylish brick-walled speakeasy sits 
below the former headquarters of the Prohibition Department. If you can’t get a 
seat (reservations are accepted Tues-Thurs, but on Super Bowl weekend you’ll 
need to plop down $20 for an all-day pass), head a few blocks north to for the 
capacious Crescent Ballroom, which combines a lounge, music hall and Cocina 10 
restaurant in a renovated century-old mechanic’s garage. The atmosphere is 
lively, the drinks are reasonably-priced, and the modern roadhouse menu was 
designed by two of the city’s culinary stars, Chris Bianco and Doug Robson.

 Angel’s Trumpet Ale House 
Downtown workers once used to flee for the ’burbs at the end of happy hour. 
But the 2008 real estate bust was something of a boon for downtown 
reinvestment, and now people linger to enjoy coffee bars, pubs and restaurants 
linked by the metro light rail. Ride it north to artsy Roosevelt Row (known as 
RoRo), where neighbourhood bars rub elbows with galleries and independent 
boutiques. Angel’s Trumpet Ale House, a couple of blocks from Roosevelt 
station, has a well-curated collection of on-tap brews from Arizona and 
elsewhere. Or head a few blocks east to the 1922 bungalow that houses The Lost 
Leaf. You’ll find live music nightly and a lengthy beer list, but the Leaf’s 
unique draw is, well, drawing. This bar-cum-gallery hosts life-drawing 
sessions, and artists who show their work here get to keep 100% of their sales.

Windsor, Uptown

The Central Avenue/Camelback light rail station is the gateway to another 
neighbourhood of great eats and drinks. Windsor, a couple of blocks north, is a 
winner here, a gastropub where you can make yourself (and the kids) at home on 
the patio and enjoy the desert winter weather. Cocktails, wine, and pitchers 
are $5 till 5pm. Order a pitcher of Pimms or the current craft beer, or devise 
your own salad-in-a-glass from the Bloody Mary cart.

Got wheels and a designated driver? Take Camelback Road toward Scottsdale 
(about 10 miles) and you’ll pass cathedrals of upscale consumerism, with 
countless options for shopping, dining and imbibing, from happy hours with 
killer small plates, to celebrity-spotting near the Biltmore district’s fancy 
hotels. If you’re a whiskey drinker, your happy place is The Gladly, which has 
a worldly collection of more than 200 varieties of scotch, bourbon and rye. Its
hautecomfort food is earning raves from Zagat and other reviewers. The Gladly 
closes for a private party on Super Bowl Sunday.
• thegladly.com <http://www.thegladly.com/>. Open Mon-Fri for lunch and 
dinner, closes Mon-Thurs 10pm, Fri-Sat 11pm

The Vig (Arcadia)

Further east, Camelback Road edges the Arcadia neighbourhood, where 
thirtysomethings have been busy rehabbing houses on 1950s and 1960s 
developments and transforming them into retro-cool mid-century digs. The 
neighbourhood’s adaptive reuse of architecture has inspired a number of stylish 
spots for eating and drinking. The Vig (now with four locations) started at the 
40th Street site, tucked behind screen walls and shaded by mesquite trees. It’s 
a comfortable spot to hang out for an hour or three, a bit like getting invited 
to your neighbour’s backyard barbecue. Linger over brunch, join in a game of 
bocce (boules) or just laze by the fire pit.

Downtown Scottsdale’s hip hotel lounges and nightclubs go in and out of favour 
faster than a pair of Jimmy Choo’s. To keep up with the beautiful young crowds, 
follow the throbbing bass to find the latest “in” spot. But unless you’re under 
30 or making an anthropological study of youthful drinking and mating rituals, 
opt for Kazimierz, a cosy candlelit wine bar tucked behind its sister 
restaurant, Cowboy Ciao. While the wine list runs to a staggering 2,000+, it’s 
perfectly acceptable to sip one of the well-crafted cocktails instead.

Not your dad’s sports bar, RnR in Old Town, Scottsdale, is stylish and airy, 
with a surprisingly good wine list. It’s brunch and bloodies, however, that 
keep customers coming back. At weekends RnR opens early, and bottomless bloody 
marys and mimosas accompany dishes such as chorizo-and-egg tacos or protein 
pancakes. TV screens abound, but if you want to take your eyes off the ball, 
grab a seat on the first-floor deck for some fresh air and bird’s-eye views of 
Scottsdale’s original neighbourhood.

The handcrafted cocktail craze may be sweeping across the Valley, but beer is 
still king south of Scottsdale in Tempe, where the Four Peaks Brewing Company 
caters to students and staff at Arizona State University, and anyone who loves 
a good brew. Kilt Lifter, a Scottish-style ale (pale, low hop content, malty), 
goes down easily. If you like your brew with a bite, however, opt for Hop Knot 
IPA (6.7% alcohol). The list of brews includes seasonals, and the beer of the 
moment is ¡Odelay!, a Mexican-style ale with a hint of chocolate. This brewpub 
(a former creamery) proves that “great beer”, “kid-friendly” and “good food” 
needn’t be mutually exclusive.
