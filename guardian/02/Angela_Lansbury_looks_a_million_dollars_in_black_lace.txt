We’re not alone in harbouring a soft spot for Murder She Wrote super-sleuth, 
the Gentlewoman magazine

 cover star and, as of Sunday night, Olivier-award-winning stage actor Angela 
Lansbury. Her outfit deserves a standing ovation, too. First curtain call for 
putting a slim, scalloped-edge black lace jacket over a slinky, bias-cut dress 
– that, ladies and gentlemen, is how to layer with panache.

Take another bow, Lansbury, for those accessories: pointed, ruby red slippers 
with a French-blue clutch, sheer black tights and a sparkling flying bird 
brooch. It’s all a far cry from the usual corseted dresses and blush-coloured 
court shoes seen on the red carpet – suggesting that this winning ensemble was 
not conceived by a styling team but put together by the woman herself.

As Lansbury herself said: “Here I am, creeping up to 90, feeling like a 
million dollars.” And looking it, too.
