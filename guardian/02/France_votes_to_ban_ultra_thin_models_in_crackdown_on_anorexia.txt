French MPs have approved tough measures in an attempt to combat anorexia that 
will make it a crime for fashion agencies to use dangerously thin or 
undernourished models.


Members of the lower house of parliament also voted on Friday for measures 
that will make it illegal to promote anorexia on the internet and will oblige 
agencies to clearly mark all photographs of models that have been retouched to 
alter their body shape.

 French parliament seeks to prevent the use of ultra-thin models - video. 
The legislation will attempt to impose an as-yet-unspecified minimum body mass 
index (BMI) for models employed by agencies, who will be under threat of prison 
and a fine for flouting the law.

Although the measures will only apply within France 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>, they will have a symbolic impact on 
the fashion industry given Paris’s role within it.

French health minister Marisol Touraine supported the ban on overly thin 
models – most of whom are women – presented as an amendment to her health bill, 
saying their use was worrying.

The legislation has yet to define the minimum BMI below which the law will 
apply. UnderWorld Health Organisation guidelines 
<http://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/bmi_text/en/> an adult with a BMI 
below 18.5 is considered underweight, 18 malnourished, and 17 severely 
malnourished. The average model measuring 1.75m (5ft 9in) and weighing 50kg 
(7st 12lb) has a BMI of 16.

Agencies who use models whose BMIs fall below the stipulated figure will face 
a fine of €75,000 (£55,000) and staff face up to six months in prison. Failure 
to state when photos have been retouched will incur a fine of €37,500 or up to 
30% of the amount spent on the advertising featuring the model.

French MPs also voted for a further clause in the health bill making it 
illegal to glorify anorexia on the internet. It fixes a maximum fine of €10,000 
and a year in jail for “provoking people to excessive thinness by encouraging 
prolonged dietary restrictions that could expose them to a danger of death or 
directly impair their health”.

The amendments were immediately lambasted by French model agencies who warned 
against confusing anorexia and thinness, and accused the government of 
stigmatising agencies.

“It’s very serious to conflate anorexia with the thinness of models and it 
ignores the fact that anorexia is a psychogenic illness,” Isabelle Saint-Felix, 
secretary general of Synam, which represents around 40 modelling agencies in 
France, told AFP.

An attempt to legislate against “inciting someone to excessive thinness” in 
2008 was voted on by MPs but the bill ran out of time to be presented to the 
upper house, the senate.

Xavier Pommereau, a psychiatrist, told Libération he was doubtful the measure 
against internet sites would make much difference.

“The girls who go on to these sites are already sick. They are already 
suffering from an obsession to impress others and show off their incredible 
thinness,” Pommereau said.

“It passes the message that showing dangerous images of suicide or other such 
things is wrong, but we are in a world that is completely internationalised and 
these sites and images are not confined to our borders.”

Marie-Rose Moro, psychoanalyst and psychiatrist, agreed the law would solve 
nothing. “It would be better to provide more resources to care for anorexic 
patients,” she said, adding that there should be “more awareness to eating 
disorders in society”.

As many as 40,000 people suffer from anorexia in France; 90% of them are 
women, according to health ministry figures.

Spain already bars models below a certain BMI from taking part in Madrid 
fashion shows and Italy demands health certificates for those on the catwalk.
