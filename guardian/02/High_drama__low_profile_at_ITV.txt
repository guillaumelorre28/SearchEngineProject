Attendees at Simon Shaps' leaving do last night who wanted to quiz Michael 
Grade and Dawn Airey about this week's shenanigans were sadly disappointed. 
Both were absent. Grade had something on at his son's school, while Airey 
presumably thought it best not to attend, all things considered. Perhaps it was 
just as well they weren't there - the canap√©s might have been flying. Those who 
did make the packed do in the old LWT bar included All3Media's Steve Morrison - 
prompting speculation Shaps might take a job there - plus TalkBack boss 
Lorraine Heggessey, prompting speculation she might be up for Airey's old job 
at ITV.
