The Boy Behind the Curtain 
<https://penguin.com.au/books/the-boy-behind-the-curtain-9781926428765> by Tim 
Winton (Penguin)

Tim Winton <https://www.theguardian.com/books/tim-winton> is one of 
Australia’s most popular contemporary novelists, but his most recent offerings 
have been in the realm of nonfiction. The Boy Behind the Curtain continues this 
trend, offering a collection of essays – including some previously unpublished 
– that examine life through Winton’s eyes. Not only are there the meditations 
on the natural world that infuse so much of his other work, but he also lends 
his pen to Christianity, guns, asylum seekers, and road accidents. That 
Winton’s nonfiction is as lyrical as his fiction goes without saying.

Andrew P Street is a commentator and critic, whose weekday column View from 
the Street has made him a permanent fixture of the Australian critical 
landscape.

The Curious Story of Malcolm Turnbull, the Incredible Shrinking Man in the Top 
Hat is Street’s second book of political commentary, following up his similarly 
loquacious The Short and Excruciatingly Embarrassing Reign of Captain Abbott.

For this new political era and not-so-new cutthroat political landscape, 
Street offers his signature brand of political commentary with a healthy dose 
of sarcasm and snark on the not-so-smooth rise andskin-of-his-teeth electoral 
success of our illustrious prime minister

Fight Like a Girl

 by Clementine Ford (Allen & Unwin)

Prolific commentator and popular Australian feminist Clementine Ford’s 
much-anticipated first book is less a memoir than a manifesto. Ford shot to 
fame through her feminist columns on Fairfax’s Daily Life website, and her 
first full-length book project is infused with the same distinctive attitude 
and agenda.

Guardian Australia’s Brigid Delaney wrote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/australia-books-blog/2016/sep/28/clementine-ford-theres-something-really-toxic-with-the-way-men-bond-in-australia>
: “Part memoir, part polemic, Fight Like a Girl details Ford’s growth from a 
girl with an eating disorder who wanted to be liked by the boys (‘Being 
complicit in your own silence,’ she writes), to a woman finding her voice, 
feminism and a sisterhood of ‘girl gangs’.”

The Explosion Chronicles 
<https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/the-explosion-chronicles> by Yan 
Lianke, translated by Carlos Rojas (Text)

A master satirist and with a keen eye for cultural absurdities, Yan Lianke’s 
30-year writing career has resulted in a swag of awards, including some of 
China’s most prestigious literary prizes. Most recently, his novelThe Four 
Books was shortlisted for the 2016 Man Booker Prize 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/29/the-four-books-yan-lianke-review>
, cementing his reputation as one of China’s pre-eminent fiction writers.

The Explosion Chronicles is a satirical examination of power, community and 
dynasty, as three families set about creating their fortunes in the 
millenia-old town of Explosion. Originally founded by refugees from a volcanic 
eruption, in the post-Mao era, the community transforms rapidly from village to 
unwieldy bustling metropolis, full of corruption and vice.

Double Dissolution: Heartbreak and Chaos on the Campaign Trail 
<http://www.echopublishing.com.au/titles/double-dissolution/> by Lee Zachariah 
(Echo)

At the end of April, Lee Zachariah left behind his marriage of three years and 
dove onto the campaign bus for the 2016 Australian federal election. Out of the 
ensuing political and emotional turmoil, a book emerged.

Part political analysis, part self-exploration, Double Dissolution takes the 
sense of humour and gonzo-style journalism that characterised Zachariah’s 
election coverage for Vice and fuses it to the personal. The result is a 
critical and heartfelt attempt to come to terms with the parallel failures of a 
romantic relationship and the Australian government.

In December 2010, 24-year-old Phoebe Handsjuk was found dead, face-down in a 
garbage chute, twelve floors below her apartment in a St Kilda Road block. Her 
death fascinated the public and the media, even more so when the coroner ruled 
it an accident. Not everyone believed it was an accident, however, including 
Phoebe’s grandfather, a former detective.

Into the Darkness is true-crime writer Robin Bowles account of Phoebe’s death

Bridget Jones’s Baby: The Diaries 
<https://penguin.com.au/books/bridget-joness-baby-9781911214564> by Helen 
Fielding (Jonathan Cape)

Bridget Jones is back, she’s single again, and now she’s pregnant. This is the 
fourth literary instalment of Bridget, but comes chronologically after the 
events of the second book, with Bridget stuck between an old flame and new 
spark, between her career and her love life, between what she wants and what 
life delivers her.

Helen Fielding recently told Guardian books editor Sian Cain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/05/bridget-joness-baby-on-the-way-into-print-helen-fielding-says>
: “At heart, Bridget Jones is about the gap between how we all feel we’re 
expected to be and how we actually are; and – as Bridget discovers with her 
somewhat bumpy pregnancy – how we expect life to turn out and how it actually 
does.”


The release of this next Bridget fix is timed to tie in with the release of 
the film of the same name 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/03/bridget-joness-baby-working-title-1bn-uk-box-office-eric-fellner-tim-bevan>

Hag-Seed: The Tempest Retold 
<https://penguin.com.au/books/hag-seed-9781781090237> by Margaret Atwood 
(Hogarth)

The Hogarth Shakespeare series, in which renowned authors rework Shakespeare’s 
classic plays for a contemporary readership, has given us Anne Tyler’s Vinegar 
Girl (The Taming of the Shrew), Howard Jacobsen’s Shylock Is My Name (The 
Merchant of Venice) and Jeanette Winterson’s The Gap of Time (A Winter’s Tale). 
Now, we have Margaret Atwood’s Hag-Seed, her version of the Tempest, reimagined 
as a wronged theatre director’s quest for vengeance.According to Alexandra 
Harris for the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/06/hag-seed-the-tempest-retold-by-margaret-atwood>
, Atwood approaches this “with gusto and extravagance”.

Margaret Atwood recently wrote for the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/24/margaret-atwood-rewriting-shakespeare-tempest-hagseed>
: “Hag-Seed is set in the year 2013, in Canada, in a region somewhat close to a 
town where there is an actual Shakespeare festival. It opens with a video ofThe 
Tempest that’s been made in a prison and is being watched by an unseen audience 
inside the prison. Act 1, Scene 1 – the actual tempest, with sailors running 
around and yelling – is in progress on screen, when suddenly there are sounds 
of a prison riot. Lockdown!”

) is known for her unconventional and imaginative prose. Her newest novel is 
the first of a quartet, Seasonal: four independent but interlinked novels 
drawing on ideas about the nature of time and the shifting, cyclical elements 
in culture and nature that mark the moments of our lives.

Daniel is 100 years old; Elizabeth is a child of the 80s. In Smith’s 
distinctive style, these characters draw past and present together as they take 
the reader deep into the heart of a post-summer UK, into the belly of the 
cultural products that shape our experiences and understanding of the world.
