Primark <https://www.theguardian.com/business/primark> has shown it is not 
immune from the chill blowing through the retail sector after trading was hit 
by the unseasonably warm autumn.

The discount clothing chain, which recently toasted a ”magnificent” year with 
sales of nearly £5bn and a 29% rise in profits 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/04/primark-profits-surge-magnificent-year>
, achieved like-for-like sales below the expectations of Associated British 
Foods, its owner.

The weather conditions, which have also affected rivals such as Next, were 
blamed for the disappointing performance, although AB Foods said store 
expansion meant total sales were still up 10% over the past two months.

Primark’s profit estimate for the year to September was also unchanged because 
the company budgeted for a higher level of markdowns this year.

The chain’s rapid expansion over recent years has given it 278 stores in nine 
countries, including 164 shops in the UK. It is planning an increase in store 
space of 1m sq ft this financial year, having grown to 10m sq ft – seven times 
the size of its entire footprint in 2000.

Primark’s on-trend ranges have made it a winner in the sector in recent years, 
with analysts praising its ability to mix low prices with high fashion.

Today’s trading update came during AB Food’s annual meeting, when shareholders 
were told operating profits for the group were broadly in line with 
expectations for the first two months of the financial year.

The FTSE 100-listed conglomerate, which employs 118,000 people in 47 countries

, also has operations in sugar, agriculture, grocery and ingredients. Brands 
include Ryvita, Ovaltine, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill and Patak’s.

Shares in AB Foods fell by 4% at one stage today.

Rae Ellingham, an analyst at Charles Stanley, said: “The announcement may 
serve as a reminder to investors that consistent growth at Primark is not 
guaranteed and we remain concerned at the high valuation being applied by 
investors.”
