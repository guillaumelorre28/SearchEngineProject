Pokémon Go <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon-go> hit the UK app 
store right smack in the middle of Brighton’s game developer conference 
Develop, and it seemed suddenly the entire indie community was flicking 
Pokéballs into hotel corners to try and snag some of the city’s omnipresent 
Voltorbs and Magnemites.

“I hope some of my friends get well-paying work making doomed clones of 
Pokémon Go <https://twitter.com/v21/status/752631452337135617>,” 
<https://twitter.com/v21/status/752631452337135617> tweeted indie developer 
George Buckenham (Beasts of Balance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/30/video-games-2016-dishonored-2-uncharted-4-xcom-2>
) in the wake of Go’s release. We thought we’d ask those from the indie studios 
here at Develop how they were planing to capitalise on its success and what 
kind of pitches they had at the ready for when augmented reality (AR) investors 
come knocking for their own revamps of Pokémon Go.

Despite the game’s widespread popularity, and a Gyarados and a Ponyta in the 
press room, some remain unconvinced that it has opened the doors for a new wave 
of AR games. There are those who question whether it’s simply taking a new kind 
of Pokémon game on to a new platform, while others hope that the social aspect 
ofPokémon <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon> Go’s AR might 
encourage more fun, silly, and joyful AR play.

Robin Hunicke, Funomena (Woorld, Luna), formerly thatgamecompany (Journey)

What would you do with Pokémon Go?
I would probably introduce some selection and choice so that not everything 
that you found was perfect for you. I just think it’s nice to design games 
where you can choose and curate and design your experience, and instead of just 
thinking you want to get all of them maybe you want to get the ones that are 
perfect for you.

What kind of augmented-reality game would you make?
I think that you could make augmented-reality games that make the world more 
silly and joyful, and less logical. That’s what Woorld is.

Mitu Khandaker-Kokoris, The Tiniest Shark (Redshirt)

What would you do with Pokémon Go?
Pokémon Go is the game that I wanted to make, like, 10 years ago when people 
were doing ARGs as a thing and you’re like, ‘You know what, only Nintendo can 
do this, or whoever gets the Pokémon brand,’ because the thing about it is it’s 
so successful because of the Pokémon brand, right? It’s not necessarily because 
of doing anything new or fancy with AR. I mean, it’s Pokémon. People want to 
catch Pokemon in the real world. It’s like the most natural game-to-real-life 
equivalent there is.

How would you improve it?
Just having more opportunities for social interaction within the game. There’s 
a lot of emergent social interactions that happen just around the game, which 
is really cool, but I think some way of being able to team up with your friends 
in the game would be pretty cool – bringing some of the real-world richness of 
social interactions into the game somehow.

What kind of augmented-reality game would you make?


I don’t know, that’s a weird one for me because I’m obviously interested in 
social simulation as a thing, basically, so I’m almost taking the real world 
and putting it into games. I guess I would have non-player characters just, 
like, projected in the real world and you don’t know who’s real and who’s not, 
and it would all just be this big weird mystery. LikeSpyParty

 in real life, maybe.


Jo Haslam, Mediatonic (Hatoful Boyfriend, Heavenstrike Rivals)

What kind of augmented-reality game would you make?

If we did a kind of Hatoful Boyfriend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/12/hatoful-boyfriend-review-love-pigeons-japanese-dating-sim>
 version, rather than Pokémon it would be more of a pigeon-collecting app, 
because I love pigeons. I’m a Brightonian. I feel bad for pigeons in London. 
They get a lot of stick. But I think they’re lovely creatures, and in Brighton 
they get picked on by the seagulls, so I fight for pigeons. Go round and just 
collect lots of different lovely pigeons, and try to, I suppose, romance them a 
little bit. It’s a bit weird but, you know, make them happy.

Richard Franke, Magic Notion (Kitty Powers’ Matchmaker)

What kind of augmented-reality game would you make?
So, being a gay man and well-acquainted with Grindr, which is a similar kind 
of game to Pokémon Go, with gay men especially it’s kind of realistic to go 
wandering about in secluded places looking for people loitering about so you 
can catch ’em all, do you know what I mean? What you’re going to catch is 
debatable.

Because I’m, I guess, specialising in dating games, I would probably make a 
dating game where you could bump into people, like in a Hollywood romcom where 
people bump into each other at the coffee shop, and then you have a little 
exchange, a bit like in Matchmaker, I guess, where you have an awkward 
conversation and hopefully the stars will align and you’ll have something in 
common, or maybe you’ll drop something and do the bend and snap to impress 
them, that kind of thing.


I think if you’re going to have a game that encourages people to socialise in 
real life, maybe you could turn it into a real dating thing but in a kind 
ofcomical way where there wasn’t really any pressure. Make it fun and silly. A 
lot of people said to us, ‘Why don’t you make [Kitty Powers’ Matchmaker] into a 
real dating game? Because it could totally work,’ and it probably could, but 
then you’re kind of making it a bit too real. Love is a dangerous thing, 
because it can hurt people really badly, and I don’t want to do that. So you’re 
better off encouraging them to make friends. Maybe they’ve got little 
characters that they can make fall in love but they don’t feel like they’re 
falling in love themselves. You could totally translate that to a Pokemon-style 
thing, I think.


Cherie Davidson, Media Molecule (LittleBigPlanet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/13/little-big-planet-3-review>)

What would you do with Pokémon Go?
Definitely more UGC (user-generated content), customisation, people injecting 
themselves more and their personality more into the game. The first step is 
avatars. They’re way oversimplified at the moment. It’s good, but you want to 
go to the gym and be like, ‘”Oh, that’s who that person is. I understand that’s 
that totally punkass person who keeps being top of that gym in my town,” so 
that when you see them you kind of make that relationship between their avatar 
and person, and that adds to that social aspect, which I think is really core 
to Pokémon Go.

This is just me, but I just like to put little accessories on pets, so being 
able to put accessories on your Pokémon, oh my goodness ... And then just more 
of the Pokémon breeding, kind of Tamagotchi aspect, because I’m a big fan of 
that.

)

What would you do with Pokémon Go?
One idea is a faux documentary that follows Team Rocket on their quest of 
crime. The player directs the action, and they may or may not catch them all.

Mark, one of our techs who has wonderful ideas, came up with the festival that 
we’re doing now, actually, Election “We’d go about setting up the Ministry for 
Pokémon Equality,” he said, within Fallen London. “Where the great minds of the 
age could debate whether the ancient bloodsport has gone too far. Pokémon are 
disappearing all over the city, meanwhile, and there’s a strange new rubbery 
lump recipe being sold in street stalls that has a distinctly sweet and 
altogether new flavour.’ So that’s standard Fallen London.

I would add a really lovely luscious character creation with lots of different 
options, because Failbetter are really well known for having a third gender 
option and it’s a bummer that there isn’t one in Pokémon Go. Lots more colours, 
and grey hair, because there’s never enough hair colours in Nintendo character 
creation options.


I think I would like to see a Fallen London layer to it, so if you had the 
world of Pokémon Go, what would happen if the entire thing was laid over the 
landscape that we’ve built? There’d be a whole new range of Pokémon. We have an 
animal in our game called the Bifurcated Owl that can split itself in half. 
That would be cool.


Haley Uyrus: I think it would have to be that Pikachu would have escaped and 
gone to Fallen London, and you would follow his story as he discovers what the 
city is like, which I can only imagine would be epic because you’d have the 
cheerful Pikachu discovering all the nitty-gritty of London.


And he would bring electricity to Fallen London, because it’s gaslit.

What would you do with Pokémon Go?
If I owned it, I would sell it. AR has never proven to be popular, and I don’t 
think it has just now. I think Pokémon proved to be popular and this AR just 
happens to be exactly the right metaphor for Pokémon, right? Like, you have 
Pokémon, which is this game about walking around in the wild finding cutesy 
animals, and that sounds like a pretty cool thing to do in real life, and I 
think that initial burst made AR accessible to a lot of people around it, but I 
don’t think they’ll switch. Unless you can get that same momentum behind a 
thing, I don’t really believe that AR has proved anything. I believe that it 
proved that it applies very well to Pokémon.

How would you improve it?
I think the thing that works about it is that it’s not really formally a video 
game, right? It’s a collection game. It misses all of those things that people 
think about when they think “game”, and that’s why it’s accessible and 
pleasant. The first thing a game designer would say is, like, ‘Add fights,’ so 
you could fight with other players. That’s the first thing a game designer 
would say. And it would probably be the worst possible thing you could 
implement in it, because it’s exactly not what Pokémon Go is. So it’s this 
really weird thing where I think game developers might actually be the worst 
humans to ask this question.

What would you do with Pokemon Go?
I would tattoo a QR code to my face, and code Pokémon Go to track my face and 
superimpose a digital replica that would be forever young. By the time my body 
starts to grow old, humanity will be viewing the world via the cypher of 
Pokémon Go. All will love me and despair.
