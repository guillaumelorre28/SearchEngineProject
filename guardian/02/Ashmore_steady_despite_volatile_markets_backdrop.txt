Emerging markets focused asset management group Ashmore has been vying for top 
spot on on the FTSE 100 leader board for much of the early afternoon after a 
flurry of analyst notes confirming the business had done a good deal to calm 
investors fears that the strong performing stock my be about to falter.

Assets under management were up 2.5% over the second quarter, the company 
revealed this morning, rising to $60.4bn after net inflows of $500m. Analysts 
at Killik & Co were among those to suggest the figures were "slightly better 
than expected given the ongoing market uncertainty".

Stuart Duncan at Peel Hunt said agreed. "Despite being subject to short-term 
volatility, the stock remains uniquely exposed to structural growth in emerging 
market debt, an attribute the current rating is not acknowledging."

The stock had lost a little ground last week after some analysts expressed 
nervousness about the volatility of the markets in which it operates. Duncan 
yesterday said: "Ashmore remains well positioned for what we see as the 
long-term structural growth of EM debt as an asset class. There is a compelling 
argument that EM is actually less risky than many investors perceive, and that 
this will drive increased allocations to investors who can deliver long-term 
superior investment performance."

Shares were leading the FTSE 100 list of climbers at 3pm, up 18.4p at 344.3p.
