Good night and good luck

As delightful as the late afternoon heart starter was, I think it’s time to 
say enough from Politics Live for today. Thanks toMel Davey and to Gabi Chan 
for their services to live coverage today, and thanks to all of you for reading.

Let’s close out by reflecting on the events of the day.

federal seat of Lindsay, in Sydney, Wednesday, May 25, 2016. Photograph: Matt

 * The Coalition unveiled a package for dairy farmers smacked about by low 
milk prices. Labor was unimpressed because the centrepiece was a concessional 
loans package, and concessional loans haven’t to date been roaringly successful.

 * The issue of black holes persisted throughout the campaign news cycle after 
the Coalition fluffed its attack on Labor on Tuesday. The ALP had more or less 
punched a hole in the Coalition’s main attack lines until a late afternoon 
performance from the Labor manDavid Feeney derailed the venture. Feeney had no 
idea about his party’s position on key measures including pensions and the 
school kids bonus. Before he collapsed into plaintive cluelessness on live 
television over spending and savings proposals Feeney had admitted he’d 
produced the major own goal of the Labor campaign to date by forgetting to 
declare he owned a $2m house, well before this afternoon, in any case.

 * The gaffe-o-metre also expanded in different directions, with the 
Coalition’s campaign spokesmanMathias Cormann delivering a floral endorsement 
of the Labor leaderBill Shorten entirely by accident, and Barnaby Joyce 
declaring that every man could use a couple of au pairs. Don’t ask, it doesn’t 
matter.

Mel Davey will be back at first light then I will be back live from 8.30am 
tomorrow. Have a lovely evening.

Quickly to other matters. Malarndirri McCarthy, a former ABC journo and member 
of the Northern Territory legislative assembly, has thrown her hat in the ring 
to replaceNova Peris. Peris resigned as a Labor senator for the Norther 
Territory on Tuesday to pursue a job in the AFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/24/nova-peris-resigns-from-the-senate-after-reports-she-was-seeking-afl-job>
. McCarthy is a Yanyuwa Garrawa woman from Borroloola in the NT. Between 2005 
and 2012, she was a member of the NT legislative assembly and was a minister in 
the Labor government. There’s already been a bit of a stir around the fact 
McCarthy currently lives in Sydney, although a spokesman said she had done so 
since 2012 to stay with her sick father and she will move back to the NT if she 
is selected for the Senate spot. Guardian Australia also understandsCathryn 
Tilmouth is considering running for the spot. Tilmouth is a former adviser to 
Labor resources minister,Martin Ferguson, and currently works for Ken Vowles, a 
member of the NT legislative assembly. Tilmouth is the daughter of Aboriginal 
former Central Land Council director, the lateTracker Tilmouth. According to 
reports 
<https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/31687998/nova-peris-replacement-search-starts/> 
Peris’ chief of staff,Ursula Raymond, is also considering a run. Raymond has 
worked for the Fred Hollows Foundation, the ABC, and the Northern Land Council.

While Mathias Cormann is out speaking to reporters he slots in a correction to 
his own stumble earlier in the day, when he accidentally delivered a glowing 
endorsement to the Labor leaderBill Shorten. Malcolm Turnbull is an extremely 
caring fellow. Cormann looks ever so slightly sheepish, but mostly, amused.

What a time to be alive.

'I don't have the answer'

Just rolling back to nail the Feeney segment on the budget.

Q: Will Labor keep the school kids’ bonus?

David Feeney:

The... well we... in terms – the baby bonus?

Q: School kids’ bonus...


David Feeney:

The – well I – you’d have to refer to our relevant shadow. I’ve been a little, 
ah, distracted over the last few days.

Q: This is a $4.5bn measure it stops, the last payment goes out the door in 
July, Labor has railed against it and we don’t know whether you’re going to 
keep it or not!

David Feeney:

Chris Bowen – Tony Burke – have extensively discussed the shambolic press 
conference that was yesterday –

Q: I’m not talking about that, I’m asking you about the school kids’ bonus, 
real policy, this is a real policy, real payment, that according to Labor the 
families rely on week by week, are you going to keep it or not?


David Feeney:

I refer to the relevant shadow, I don’t have the answer.

Feeney was on the program with the cabinet secretary Arthur Sinodinos, who 
enjoyed a brief moment of discomfort when Speers asked him aboutMichael 
Yabsley’s comments to Four Corners about political donations earlier this week.

Yabsley, a former fundraiser for the Liberal party, suggested on Four Corners 
he knew banned donations from property developers were coming in through the 
Free Enterprise Foundation. “In a couple of cases, yes. We’re talking about 
property developers, owners of certain licensed premises. I don’t think it was 
a great secret about the fact that that was happening,” Yabsley said.

Speers then wondered what Arthur Sinodinos, a former Liberal party treasurer, 
knew about the donations. Nothing, he said. Sinodinos said Yabsley’s statement 
to Four Corners was at odds with his sworn evidence in Icac on the donations 
issue. “It varies with his sworn evidence to Icac.”

Sinodinos then revealed himself as a supporter of campaign finance reform. He 
said he favoured real time disclosure of donations, and restricting donations 
to people on the electoral roll.

Feeney came on the program to sweep up the remaining debris from last week. 
There was a complete mea culpa on the Northcote house. The Labor man noted for 
the record that he had never forgotten that he owned a $2m house, he had only 
forgotten to declare it, a bout of absentmindedness that had achieved nothing 
more than “three days of humiliation.” He said he’d initially declined to 
confirm whether he was negatively gearing the Northcote property because his 
wife did the finances in his house.

David Feeney:

I didn’t want to wing it.

house imbroglio.

Unfortunately that’s a trophy I managed to secure last week.

'You haven’t got the cabinet on today, you’ve just got little old me.'

Sky News made much last week of the Labor man, David Feeney, pulling out of a 
regular segment when the controversy blew up about his undeclared $2m Northcote 
house. Feeney has crept back into the Sky studios this afternoon, but likely 
regrets that decision now.

Sky political editor David Speers has just completely carved him up over 
Labor’s budget plans. Feeney had no idea about Labor’s position on several 
issues, and he knew he was in terrible trouble.

Feeney said Labor would produce budget repair that was fair (which is Labor’s 
holding formulation.) Speers thought the viewers might like some detail.

Q: What will we get under Labor?

David Feeney:

You haven’t got the cabinet on today, you’ve just got little old me.

And on it went for three or four excruciating minutes of abject cluelessness.

'All men should have a couple of au pairs'

The deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce has just been on 2GB for a brief chat 
ahead of tonight’s regional debate in Goulburn withJoel Fitzgibbon and Richard 
Di Natale.

Joyce has offered some general advice concerning the weedy little man wearing 
too much jewelry (that would be Johnny Depp) after Depp noted on a US chat show 
that Joycelooks like he’s “inbred with a tomato” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/25/johnny-depp-says-barnaby-joyce-looks-like-inbred-with-a-tomato>
 – the best approach to interpersonal relations with the movie star is “let him 
blow himself out.”

Joyce’s host on 2GB moved on to other matters, expressing astonishment that 
the Greens leader would be part of tonight’s debate, noting, delicately: “What 
the hell is he doing there?” Joyce made some observations about the Greens and 
rural issues that that weren’t entirely easy to follow. The conversation 
swerved then into the recent controversy surrounding the Greens leader and the 
hiring of au pairs.Barnaby Joyce seemed keen on some home help.

All men should have a couple of au pairs.

~Someone~ Complained To The AEC About Those Turnbull Posters

I’m not quite sure who had this story first today but Buzzfeed is reporting 
the artist has been contacted by the Australian Electoral Commission. The 
graphic designerMichael Agzarian has told BuzzFeed “he was contacted by the AEC 
almost as soon as the posters went up, to be told they violate electoral 
advertising laws. The issue, Agzarian was told, was that the posters didn’t 
contain the necessary authorisation disclosures - something the designer says 
he completely understands.”

The identity of the person making the complaint remains mysterious, but if you 
are collector, you might want to get them while they’re hot.

Given Mathias Cormann’s entirely accidental endorsement of Bill Shorten has 
been running on a high rotation on the live news channels since the moment the 
slip happened, the Coalition’s campaign spokesman is out now with the Dyson on 
the twitters.

As delightful as the late afternoon heart starter was, I think it’s time to 
say enough from Politics Live for today. Thanks toMel Davey and to Gabi Chan 
for their services to live coverage today, and thanks to all of you for reading.

electorate of Maribyrnong, Melbourne this afternoon, Wednesday 25th May 2016.

Let’s close out by reflecting on the events of the day.
 Former prime minister John Howard (centre) and Member for Lindsay Fiona Scott 
(right) pose for a selfie during a visit to Westfield Penrith Plaza in the 
federal seat of Lindsay, in Sydney, Wednesday, May 25, 2016. Photograph: Matt 
Coughlan/AAP 
 * The Coalition unveiled a package for dairy farmers smacked about by low 
milk prices. Labor was unimpressed because the centrepiece was a concessional 
loans package, and concessional loans haven’t to date been roaringly successful.

 * The issue of black holes persisted throughout the campaign news cycle after 
the Coalition fluffed its attack on Labor on Tuesday. The ALP had more or less 
punched a hole in the Coalition’s main attack lines until a late afternoon 
performance from the Labor manDavid Feeney derailed the venture. Feeney had no 
idea about his party’s position on key measures including pensions and the 
school kids bonus. Before he collapsed into plaintive cluelessness on live 
television over spending and savings proposals Feeney had admitted he’d 
produced the major own goal of the Labor campaign to date by forgetting to 
declare he owned a $2m house, well before this afternoon, in any case.

 * The gaffe-o-metre also expanded in different directions, with the 
Coalition’s campaign spokesmanMathias Cormann delivering a floral endorsement 
of the Labor leaderBill Shorten entirely by accident, and Barnaby Joyce 
declaring that every man could use a couple of au pairs. Don’t ask, it doesn’t 
matter.

Mel Davey will be back at first light then I will be back live from 8.30am 
tomorrow. Have a lovely evening.
 
Quickly to other matters. Malarndirri McCarthy, a former ABC journo and member 
of the Northern Territory legislative assembly, has thrown her hat in the ring 
to replaceNova Peris. Peris resigned as a Labor senator for the Norther 
Territory on Tuesday to pursue a job in the AFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/24/nova-peris-resigns-from-the-senate-after-reports-she-was-seeking-afl-job>
. McCarthy is a Yanyuwa Garrawa woman from Borroloola in the NT. Between 2005 
and 2012, she was a member of the NT legislative assembly and was a minister in 
the Labor government. There’s already been a bit of a stir around the fact 
McCarthy currently lives in Sydney, although a spokesman said she had done so 
since 2012 to stay with her sick father and she will move back to the NT if she 
is selected for the Senate spot. Guardian Australia also understandsCathryn 
Tilmouth is considering running for the spot. Tilmouth is a former adviser to 
Labor resources minister,Martin Ferguson, and currently works for Ken Vowles, a 
member of the NT legislative assembly. Tilmouth is the daughter of Aboriginal 
former Central Land Council director, the lateTracker Tilmouth. According to 
reports 
<https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/31687998/nova-peris-replacement-search-starts/> 
Peris’ chief of staff,Ursula Raymond, is also considering a run. Raymond has 
worked for the Fred Hollows Foundation, the ABC, and the Northern Land Council.

 
While Mathias Cormann is out speaking to reporters he slots in a correction to 
his own stumble earlier in the day, when he accidentally delivered a glowing 
endorsement to the Labor leaderBill Shorten. Malcolm Turnbull is an extremely 
caring fellow. Cormann looks ever so slightly sheepish, but mostly, amused.

What a time to be alive.
  ‘I’ve been distracted over the past few days”  
The Liberals have already stood up their campaign spokesman, Mathias Cormann, 
in the Mural Hall.

Labor is in complete chaos!
 
Just rolling back to nail the Feeney segment on the budget.

Q: Will Labor keep the school kids’ bonus?

David Feeney:

The... well we... in terms – the baby bonus?

Q: School kids’ bonus...


David Feeney:

The – well I – you’d have to refer to our relevant shadow. I’ve been a little, 
ah, distracted over the last few days.

Q: This is a $4.5bn measure it stops, the last payment goes out the door in 
July, Labor has railed against it and we don’t know whether you’re going to 
keep it or not!

David Feeney:

Chris Bowen – Tony Burke – have extensively discussed the shambolic press 
conference that was yesterday –

Q: I’m not talking about that, I’m asking you about the school kids’ bonus, 
real policy, this is a real policy, real payment, that according to Labor the 
families rely on week by week, are you going to keep it or not?


David Feeney:

I refer to the relevant shadow, I don’t have the answer.
 
Feeney was on the program with the cabinet secretary Arthur Sinodinos, who 
enjoyed a brief moment of discomfort when Speers asked him aboutMichael 
Yabsley’s comments to Four Corners about political donations earlier this week.

Yabsley, a former fundraiser for the Liberal party, suggested on Four Corners 
he knew banned donations from property developers were coming in through the 
Free Enterprise Foundation. “In a couple of cases, yes. We’re talking about 
property developers, owners of certain licensed premises. I don’t think it was 
a great secret about the fact that that was happening,” Yabsley said.

Speers then wondered what Arthur Sinodinos, a former Liberal party treasurer, 
knew about the donations. Nothing, he said. Sinodinos said Yabsley’s statement 
to Four Corners was at odds with his sworn evidence in Icac on the donations 
issue. “It varies with his sworn evidence to Icac.”

Sinodinos then revealed himself as a supporter of campaign finance reform. He 
said he favoured real time disclosure of donations, and restricting donations 
to people on the electoral roll.
 
Never a truer word.
 
Feeney came on the program to sweep up the remaining debris from last week. 
There was a complete mea culpa on the Northcote house. The Labor man noted for 
the record that he had never forgotten that he owned a $2m house, he had only 
forgotten to declare it, a bout of absentmindedness that had achieved nothing 
more than “three days of humiliation.” He said he’d initially declined to 
confirm whether he was negatively gearing the Northcote property because his 
wife did the finances in his house.

David Feeney:

I didn’t want to wing it.
 
Before Speers rolled round to the budget discussion, Feeney admitted he had 
produced the major own goal of Labor’s campaign to date with the undeclared 
house imbroglio.

David Feeney:

Unfortunately that’s a trophy I managed to secure last week.
 
Sky News made much last week of the Labor man, David Feeney, pulling out of a 
regular segment when the controversy blew up about his undeclared $2m Northcote 
house. Feeney has crept back into the Sky studios this afternoon, but likely 
regrets that decision now.

Sky political editor David Speers has just completely carved him up over 
Labor’s budget plans. Feeney had no idea about Labor’s position on several 
issues, and he knew he was in terrible trouble.

Feeney said Labor would produce budget repair that was fair (which is Labor’s 
holding formulation.) Speers thought the viewers might like some detail.

Q: What will we get under Labor?

David Feeney:

You haven’t got the cabinet on today, you’ve just got little old me.

And on it went for three or four excruciating minutes of abject cluelessness.
 
The deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce has just been on 2GB for a brief chat 
ahead of tonight’s regional debate in Goulburn withJoel Fitzgibbon and Richard 
Di Natale.

Joyce has offered some general advice concerning the weedy little man wearing 
too much jewelry (that would be Johnny Depp) after Depp noted on a US chat show 
that Joycelooks like he’s “inbred with a tomato” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/25/johnny-depp-says-barnaby-joyce-looks-like-inbred-with-a-tomato>
 – the best approach to interpersonal relations with the movie star is “let him 
blow himself out.”

Joyce’s host on 2GB moved on to other matters, expressing astonishment that 
the Greens leader would be part of tonight’s debate, noting, delicately: “What 
the hell is he doing there?” Joyce made some observations about the Greens and 
rural issues that that weren’t entirely easy to follow. The conversation 
swerved then into the recent controversy surrounding the Greens leader and the 
hiring of au pairs.Barnaby Joyce seemed keen on some home help.

All men should have a couple of au pairs.

~Someone~ Complained To The AEC About Those Turnbull Posters

I’m not quite sure who had this story first today but Buzzfeed is reporting 
the artist has been contacted by the Australian Electoral Commission. The 
graphic designerMichael Agzarian has told BuzzFeed “he was contacted by the AEC 
almost as soon as the posters went up, to be told they violate electoral 
advertising laws. The issue, Agzarian was told, was that the posters didn’t 
contain the necessary authorisation disclosures - something the designer says 
he completely understands.”

The identity of the person making the complaint remains mysterious, but if you 
are collector, you might want to get them while they’re hot.
 
I know we are #ausvotes all the way here, however reader Benton Wecker has 
shared some mildly astonishing news (astonishing to me at least, because I 
haven’t had time to glance in the direction of the US since our election 
contest opened, so I am seriously behind the times.)

Given Mathias Cormann’s entirely accidental endorsement of Bill Shorten has 
been running on a high rotation on the live news channels since the moment the 
slip happened, the Coalition’s campaign spokesman is out now with the Dyson on 
the twitters.

I was clearly feeling some sympathy for Mr Shorten this morning, given the
