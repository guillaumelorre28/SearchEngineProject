Most of the UK had a fantastic run of late summer sun and a gorgeously mild 
early autumn â€¦ but it's time to admit that the fair weather game is up for 
another year.

Time to start thinking long-haul: northern lights viewing, affordable tropical 
sunshine, and getting away over Christmas without breaking the bank. Tom Hall 
will be answering questions on these subjects plus the latest on everything 
from floods in Bangkok to what's hot at this week'sWorld Travel Market 
<http://www.wtmlondon.com/> trade fair in London and, of course, trying to 
answer any other questions you throw at him

Tom will get to as many as he can in an hour, but due to the volume of 
questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
