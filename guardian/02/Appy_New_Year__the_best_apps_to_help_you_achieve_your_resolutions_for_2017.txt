Stick to your reading goals

Bookout 
<https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bookout-reading-made-better/id1085047737?mt=8> 
(iOS – free)
A common New Year resolution is a vow to read a new book every week and 
Bookout could keep your literary motivation high. You can set goals for how 
much time you want to spend reading (or how many books) and track your progress 
over the year. Its social features may also turn you into a bookworm bragger 
before 2017 is done.

Organise your writing

Bear <http://www.bear-writer.com/> (iOS – free)
Bear is great for anyone looking to start 2017 with a fresh page. Whether 
you’re writing short notes, longer pieces or even that long-planned novel, its 
simple-but-slick interface helps you concentrate on tapping in your thoughts, 
then organising them so they’re easy to come back to at a later date.

Sort out your security

1Password <https://1password.com/> (Android/iOS – free)
High-profile hack attacks were a feature of 2016, so one of your more useful 
New Year resolution might be to improve your online security. 1Password 
generates strong passwords for you to use online and stores them securely, 
accessible through a single password (hence the name).

Stick to all your resolutions

Streaks <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/streaks/id963034692?mt=8> (iOS – 
£2.99)
Streaks is the perfect app to keep you on all the straight and narrow paths 
you’ve chosen for 2017, whether it’s a daily run, drinking more water or eating 
more healthily. You set up to six daily tasks then let the app know when you’ve 
completed each one, notching up daily “streaks” as you go. A simple way to keep 
on track.

more features and an offline mode.

Keep a digital diary

worth trying. It does some of the work for you, pulling in your posts from 
Facebook, Instagram and other social apps. You can write extra notes and save 
important photos, building up an archive of what you’ve done, where you’ve been 
and what you were thinking at the time.

Go to more gigs

Dice <https://dice.fm/about> (Android/iOS – free)
Dice is one of the best ways to jog you out of only seeing bands you liked 
when you were 18. It recommends concerts by emerging artists and learns your 
preferences over time. Plus the tickets are sold within the app, so no bits of 
paper to lose before your night out.

Get out jogging

C25K <http://www.c25kfree.com/> (Android/iOS – free)
Those experienced at keeping New Year resolutions know that a concrete goal is 
always best. For example, aiming to complete a 5k run is better than a vague 
vow simply to run more. C25K is a carefully crafted app with a program of 
runs that will take you from a Christmas Day turkey-coma to a 5k run by the 
end of February.

Track your fertility cycle

exercise and sleep patterns – with the welcome promise of “no butterflies, 
euphemisms or pink”.

Get more sleep

A mindfulness app with a specific goal: getting you a full eight hours (or at 
least, however many you need) of sleep every night. It’s a collection of audio 
tracks designed to help you drop off, including (via in-app purchase) extra 
packs for specific issues such as anxiety and pain. It’s a spin-off of the 
meditation appBuddhify <http://buddhify.com/>, which is also worth a try.

Find new podcasts

Pocket Casts 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts&hl=en_GB>
 (Android/iOS – £2.99)

travel time, podcasts may be the answer. And yes, there is more to the 
podcasting world thanSerial <https://serialpodcast.org/>. Pocket Casts is one 
of the best ways to discover new podcasts from around the world, then download 
them for offline listening.

bits.

Learn an instrument

Yousician <http://yousician.com/> (Android/iOS – free trial)
A vow to learn an instrument is a common New Year resolution and a new wave of 
apps can teach you not only the basics of piano, guitar and other instruments, 
but also “listen” to your efforts and highlight errors. Yousician is an 
excellent mix of video lessons and game-like practising. It’s free to try, with 
a £14.99 monthly subscription for full access.

Learn to code

Lrn <http://lrnapp.com/> (iOS – free)
Boldly going into 2017 with the intention of becoming an expert programmer 
from scratch might be a little overambitious, but Lrn could be a good way of 
stretching your brain cells. It is one of a number of learn-to-code apps that 
breaks up its lessons – in HTML, JavaScript, Python and other languages – into 
bitesize quizzes.

Try out new recipes

Kitchen Stories <https://kitchenstories.io/en> (Android/iOS – free)
If you want to jog yourself out of cooking the same five meals in 2017 – and 
find some healthy alternatives – Kitchen Stories is a good place to start. It’s 
a collection of recipes with new ones to try every week and video tutorials 
that are an excellent way of gauging how difficult a recipe is before you start 
making it.

Let AI help you get organised

Gluru <https://gluru.co/> (Android – free)
Gluru is a fascinating spin on the to-do list genre: it claims to use AI 
technology to dig into your email and productivity apps, and create tasks for 
you, predicting what you will need to do next. It’s early days for this 
technology, but it is worth a try.

Get more active and relaxed

Spire <https://spire.io/> (Android/iOS – free)
Like Fitbit, Spire is an activity-tracking gadget as well as an app. Clipped 
on to your waist, it measures your breathing as well as your steps, with the 
aim of understanding how calm you are as well as how much exercise you’re 
getting. The results may help you think about when you get stressed and how to 
address the reasons.

Give your diet a health boost

Shoptimix <http://shoptimix.com/> (Android / iOS – free)
This is a shopping-list app, but it’s also perfect for anyone trying to eat 
more healthily in 2017. You can use it to identify food and drink in several 
categories, from healthier ingredients for kids to good buys for a vegan 
lifestyle. It’s quick and easy to use, with sharing features to co-ordinate 
with your family or housemates.

Spend less time on your smartphone

BreakFree <http://www.breakfree-app.com/> (Android/iOS – free)
The irony of a roundup of apps for New Year’s resolutions in 2017 is that many 
people might be trying to spend less time lost in their mobile. But BreakFree 
may be able to help: it tracks how much you’re using your smartphone and 
presents you with the evidence that (hopefully) helps you to spend more time in 
the real world.
