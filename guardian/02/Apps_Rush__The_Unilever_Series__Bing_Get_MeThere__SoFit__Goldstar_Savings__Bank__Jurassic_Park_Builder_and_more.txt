SoFit <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sofitmobile>

SoFit is the latest social fitness app (hence the name, presumably), which 
awards points every time you exercise. It promises real-life rewards for this: 
"exclusive products from your favorite brands; downloads like music, videos and 
games; as well as fundraise for the causes you care about".
Android

Goldstar Savings Bank 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/goldstar-savings-bank/id540685895?mt=8>

This iPad <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad> app wants to teach 
children about financial basics, without making it dry and boring. A tall 
order, but Goldstar Savings Bank may just have nailed it: the idea being it's 
an app for children to record their savings and earn money for household 
chores, in order to buy rewards.
iPad

Jurassic Park Builder 
<http://itunes.apple.com/app/jurassic-park-builder/id499250722>

The latest family-friendly brand to spawn its own freemium game is Jurassic 
Park, with this new iOS game from Ludia. It follows the Smurfs' Village / 
FarmVille template with players building their own parks, buying virtual bucks 
through in-app purchases to fund it. $99.99 IAP in a game that's likely to 
appeal to children? Hmm. The game is US-only for now.
iPhone / iPad

<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/around-the-clock/id541576187?mt=8>

Swedish developer Wombi Apps <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apps> has 
a characterful new iOS app for children all about clocks. It includes a 
mini-game for each hour of the day, from teeth-brushing and biking home from 
pre-school to hammering nails and slicing butter. The idea being to familiarise 
children with the clock, rather than overtly teach them how to read it.
iPhone / iPad

Android owners concerned about nasty malward have a number of apps to choose

this app focuses on going beyond 5k races to "give you feedback and motivation 
to go farther, be healthier, and live longer".
iPhone

Party Wave <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/party-wave/id517432320?mt=8>

Cartoon-surfing game Party Wave looks fun on iOS, getting you to position a 
bunch of surfers to ride a big wave in top-down view, before switching to a

Historables: Marie Ant-toinette

Yes, Marie Antoinette re-imagined as a cartoon "ant queen" in a story-app for 
children. No, I have no idea how they handle the guillotine part. But yes, the 
app sees Marie baking and decorating a cake, setting up a castle room and 
wander through underground ant tunnels. More Historables apps are following 
from developer Base Camp Films: stand by for Teddy Bear Roosevelt and Lionardo 
Da Vinci...
