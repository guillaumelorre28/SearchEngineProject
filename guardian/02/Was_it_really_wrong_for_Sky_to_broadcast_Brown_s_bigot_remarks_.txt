Kenneth Roy argues that Sky News should not have broadcast and released the 
recording ofGordon Brown's bigot remark. He writes: 
<http://www.scottishreview.net/KRoy246.html>

To record a private conversation is one thing; to transmit it is quite 
another. The former was, by all accounts, one of life's little accidents; the 
latter was an invasion of privacy, unless there was some public interest 
defence for the action.

It is hard to see any such defence in the words broadcast. Gordon Brown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown> said nothing which cast 
doubt on the integrity of his political beliefs; all he did was express a 
personal distaste for the opinions of someone he had just met...

The ethics of transmitting a private conversation with no obvious public 
interest defence have not been explored, least of all by the perpetrators.

I have to say I can't agree with Roy on this. I do believe you can make out a 
public interest case. First, there is the obvious matter of hypocrisy or, at 
least, insincerity. Brown did not argue the immigration point withGillian Duffy
, nor take her up on her supposed bigotry. Instead, he told her it was good to 
talk to her and then said what he really thought of her afterwards.

Second, on the matter of immigration itself, Brown was exposed as having 
sought to avoid the topic that - whether one likes it or not - is high on the 
agenda for many traditional Labour supporters.

Third, there was the revelation of Brown appearing to blame his aides for 
having created the situation in which he met Duffy. This provided valuable 
evidence to back up journalists, most notably Andrew Rawnsley, who have been 
rubbished for suggesting that the prime minister is high-handed with his staff.

Together, I believe these form a perfectly reasonable public interest defence, 
for Sky and for theBBC, which took up the story.
