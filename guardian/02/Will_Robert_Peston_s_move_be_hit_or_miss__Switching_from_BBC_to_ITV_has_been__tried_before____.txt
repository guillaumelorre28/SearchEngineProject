The path from the licence fee funded uplands of Broadcasting House to the 
choppy commercial waters of “Britain’s most popular button”,as it was once known
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5mKPOBwI7Y>, is a notoriously tricky one. 

Peston, the BBC’s outgoing economics editor, is leaving to become political 
editor of ITV News and will present a new Sunday morning talk show to take on 
his old colleague, Andrew Marr. It seems like as good a time as any to look at 
those who have survived such a transition. And those who have not.


HIT

After various children’s shows on the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, Ant and Dec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ant-and-dec> made their primetime 
debut on BBC1’s Saturday night show, Friends Like These. It was a modest-sized 
hit but was relegated to a career footnote by their track record (I’m A 
Celebrity, Saturday Night Takeaway, Britain’s Got Talent, Pop Idol) after 
signing an exclusive ITV deal at the turn of the century.

Tell you what. It’s not easy dealing with these commercial breaks, as Des 
Lynam discovered to his cost when he followed the Premier League highlights 
rights out of the BBC to ITV. “It was not an overwhelming success” he later 
reflected ofITV’s The Premiership <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mOax7-bO5A>.

HIT

That unfortunate list of Tory MPs he handed David Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/08/phillip-schofield-sorry-tory-names>
 aside, Phillip Schofield never looked back after making a full-time switch 
from the BBC to ITV a decade ago. Back on the Beeb he was Testing The Nation 
with Anne Robinson, while on ITV he can be found talking about sex toys, among 
other things, on daytime flagship This Morning.

Adrian Chiles quietly became one of the BBC’s biggest stars, making an 
unlikely teatime hit out of The One Show before quitting for ITV in 2010 after 
Chris Evans was given the BBC1 show’s Friday night gig. ButDaybreak didn’t work 
out <https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/04/curse-of-itv-strikes-again> 
and a few years later he was alsoreplaced as the face of its Champions League 
football 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/23/adrian-chiles-replaced-by-mark-pougatch-itv-bbc>
coverage. Now back on BBC radio – with more TV to come.

HIT

History repeats itself department. When Nick Robinson quit the BBC to join ITV 
as political editor in 2002, the BBC reportedly tried to persuade him to stay – 
with a gig on Newsnight. Robinson, like Peston, went anyway, but was back at 
the BBC three years later 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jun/20/tvnews.itv>, much to the fury of 
his ITV bosses. Will Pesto also be back?

MISS

What’s not to like? Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine’s What Not To 
Wear, was an all-conquering hit for first BBC2 and then BBC1. But they went out 
of fashion after switching to ITV in a big-money deal in 2005. Shows such as 
Undress The Nation failed to repeat their early success and the contract was 
not renewed four years later.

<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/03/mondaymediasection3>, the list 
of misses won’t stop people trying to become a commercial hit. Just ask Susanna 
Reid, theformer BBC1 Breakfast presenter who joined ITV 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/03/bbc-breakfast-susanna-reid-joins-itv-daybreak>
 to front its Daybreak successor, Good Morning Britain, which is still waking 
up the nation – just not so many of them –with or without co-host Piers Morgan
