Ashmore, the fund management group which specialises in emerging markets, has 
unveiled a dip in full year profits, which is unlikely to help it maintain its 
place in the FTSE 100.

The latest quarterly changes in the leading index are announced on Wednesday 
but based on tonight's closing prices. At the momentAshmore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ashmoregroup> is in danger of being 
demoted to the mid-cap index, as is interdealer brokerIcap.

News that Ashmore's pretax profits had slipped from £245.9m to £243.2m has 
only served to provoke another slip in its share price, down 1.9p to 337.8p.

Icap <https://www.theguardian.com/business/icap> meanwhile is 3.5p lower at 
339.9p.

Interestingly both of this quarter's potential departures from the FTSE 100 
are financial groups, and could be replaced by industrial groups. In line for 
promotion are energy services businessWood Group - albeit it is currently down 
14.5p at 834p - and engineerMelrose, up 0.8p to 251.9p.
