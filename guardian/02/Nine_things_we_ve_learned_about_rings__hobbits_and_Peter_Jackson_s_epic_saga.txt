Thirteen years, six movies, 18 hours of footage, thousands of beards, wigs and 
bushy eyebrows, not to mention hundreds of miles of toupee tape to attach them 
to actors’ faces. And now, with the release ofThe Hobbit: The Battle of the 
Five Armies, the saga of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit is finally over — 
at least until the extended versions in special-edition embossed Blu-ray boxed 
sets, possibly festooned with hair shaved from the feet of an actual living 
hobbit, arrive on the shelves in time for next Christmas.

But rather than carping about the myriad ways in which audiences will be 
entreated to pay again for these films or about the pernicious effects of money 
and riches on the souls of mortals, let us think instead of all the ways in 
which Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies changed the landscape of cinema. Just 
as there are nine members of the Fellowship, here are nine things we have 
learned from Peter Jackson’s six-picture behemoth …

1 It’s big. But how big?

There are other franchises ahead of Jackson’s Tolkien films in the box-office 
stakes. But that hardly seems fair when those outrunning it include Harry 
Potter (eight films), Marvel’s Avengers and its offshoots (10) and the James 
Bond series (23). $1.6bn and counting doesn’t look too shabby for five films — 
with one yet to open.

2 Good things come to audiences who wait

In this Netflix-fixated age of instant gratification, the Lord of the Rings 
and Hobbit trilogies did something both antiquated and radical: they restored 
to cinema-going the old-fashioned thrill of the serial cliffhanger. The 
difference is that 1940s and 1950s audiences had only to wait a week to find 
out the resolution. Middle Earth enthusiasts, on the other hand, had to while 
away an entire year between episodes.

Future generations consuming the whole shebang over several days of 
binge-watching will do well to remember that – and to raise a tankard of mead 
to those comrades who fell before the finishing line, or who said: “Sod this 
for a game of soldiers, I’ll wait for the DVDs so I can fast-forward through 
all the boring bits.” (One character in Kevin Smith’s comedyClerks II described 
the first trilogy as: “Three movies of people walking to a fucking volcano!”)

Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was released in November 2001, a mere 
month before the first Lord of the Rings film (The Fellowship of the Ring).

But with the exception of the seventh and eighth outings, the Harry Potter 
films are self-contained, with no explicitly loose threads left dangling 
between pictures.

Audiences had experienced little to compare with the protracted suspense at 
the end ofThe Two Towers, when the slithering Gollum is apparently poised to 
murder Frodo and Sam. Jackson played the long game and took a gamble that 
audiences might want to play it, too.

Other parties had tried to adapt Lord of the Rings, including the Beatles. 
(Their 1965 film,Help!, which revolves around a sacrificial ring lodged on 
Ringo Starr’s finger, pictured left, could be seen as the nearest they came to 
Tolkien: it certainly has better songs.) In the 1970s, John Boorman shopped 
around a script featuring a scene in which Frodo Baggins has sex, which is as 
incongruous as having dinosaurs running through a second world war movie. Ralph 
Bakshi made an atmospheric 1978 animated version, but its commercial failure 
precluded any follow-ups. So it would be uncharitable to mock the various 
studios and financiers who rejected Jackson’s idea of making the project as two 
movies. Wizard hats off to Bob Shaye at New Line Cinema, who took a leap of 
faith by suggesting a trilogy might work better.

Earlier this year, Viggo Mortensen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/viggo-mortensen> (drafted in at the 11th hour 
to play Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings films after Jackson was unhappy with 
the Irish actor Stuart Townsend) revealed what was really unfolding behind the 
scenes onThe Fellowship of the Ring. “Anybody who says they knew it was going 
to be the success it was, I don’t think it’s really true,” Mortensen told the
Telegraph. “They didn’t have an inkling until they showed 20 minutes at Cannes 
in May of 2001. They were in a lot of trouble, and Peter had spent a lot. 
Officially, he could say that he was finished in December 2000 – he’d shot all 
three films in the trilogy – but really the second and third ones were a mess. 
It was very sloppy – it just wasn’t done at all. It needed massive reshoots, 
which we did, year after year. But he would have never been given the extra 
money to do those if the first one hadn’t been a huge success. The second and 
third ones would have been straight to video.”

When it came to adapting The Hobbit, Jackson and his co-writers (including 
Guillermo del Toro, who was originally scheduled to direct the Hobbit films 
until extended production delays forced him to pull out) settled on a two-part 
format. But in 2012, after viewing a finished cut ofAn Unexpected Journey and 
part ofThe Desolation of Smaug, Jackson announced that the project had put on 
weight: “I’d like to announce that two films will become three.”

Once again, it might seem that Harry Potter got there first, splitting one 
novel (Deathly Hallows) into a pair of movies. But that was 607 pages. The 
Hobbit is only 300 in total. To flesh out the world on screen, Jackson 
incorporated Tolkein’s notes, appendices and, quite possibly, his discarded 
shopping lists and telephone doodle-pads. Jackson himself had travelled in the 
opposite direction, shedding a large amount of his bulk after finishing the 
third Lord of the Rings film — anywhere between three and five stone depending 
on whom you read and whether the director removed his shoes before stepping on 
the scales.

One of the revelations in these movies has come in the form of eyefuls of 
handsome New Zealand landscapes previously unexploited in cinema. And the 
movies have done wonders for the country’s tourism industry: 13% of those who 
visit identify the Hobbit films as a key factor in their decision, an 
improvement on the 6% rise in the wake of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, 
according to Tourism New Zealand. Wellington is also home to the director’s 
production facility, Stone Street Studios, which employs more than 500 people.

Motion-capture technology has advanced immeasurably in the years that Jackson 
has been making Tolkien movies, but even at the time of the first film it was 
evident that Andy Serkis’s performance as Gollum was a formidable piece of 
acting. No wonder Serkis has bemoaned the Academy’s decision to declare 
motion-capture ineligible for Oscar consideration. He had to play his scenes in 
a blue bodysuit peppered with dots, each corresponding to a different joint. 
Whenever he moved before the camera, the computer-generated Gollum, modelled on 
Serkis’s body, would move correspondingly.

“Peter and I agreed early on that Gollum was an addict,” the actor revealed. 
“I thought it was a good idea to use the ring as a metaphor for addiction.” 
James Cameron has said the Gollum scenes gave him the confidence to makeAvatar. 
It continues in the Hobbit films where Benedict Cumberbatch is technically 
unrecognisable but there in essence as Smaug the dragon.

The films owe much to the various spectacles patchworked together through the 
use of miniatures, CGI, motion-capture, studio sets and even polystyrene models 
(which explains how Osgiliath, the former capital of Gondor, once blew away in 
a high wind during filming).

But the decision with the Hobbit films to experiment with 48 (rather than 24) 
frames-per-second was not popular. Critics were shown a 48fps version of the 
first Hobbit film, only to complain in their reviews that it resembled an 
over-lit BBC studio production. The remaining two, while still available for 
audiences in 48 or 24fps, have tended to be shown to critics only in the latter 
format.

 Gollum 
Have a drink every time Gandalf says “fool of a Took”. Or whenever there’s a 
bromance moment between Frodo and Sam. Or whenever you hear a Ring Wraith 
scream (a noise based on co-writer Fran Walsh shrieking through a throat 
infection) or when Gollum says: “My precious.” Take your pick. Whichever you 
choose, you’re likely to end up feeling worse than Gimli the dwarf being tossed 
over Helm’s Deep.

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies opens on Friday
