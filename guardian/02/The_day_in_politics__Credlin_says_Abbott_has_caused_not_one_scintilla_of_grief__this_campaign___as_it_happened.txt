Nighty night

Well folks it’s been great but it’s also enough for now. If you are hanging on 
every word of the campaign, don’t forget to watchBill Shorten on the 7.30 
Report tonight. Our ownMike Bowers is also on Kitchen Cabinet on the ABC later 
on this evening.

Let’s assess the sum of today’s parts.

 * It was a blergh muck day: leaflets, scares and counter scares, bucket jobs 
– every variety of low road got an outing at some point today, the day perhaps 
reaching its zenith when the justice ministerMichael Keenan bucketed a Labor 
candidate but refused to speak to said candidate when she rung in to one of his 
radio interviews bucketing her seeking a right of reply.

 * Malcolm Turnbull concentrated his efforts on Victoria, specifically 
Corangamite, before tracking further south.Bill Shorten concentrated his 
efforts on Adelaide and harvesting some of the protest vote currently flowing
Nick Xenophon’s way before flying north. The current mantra is leave no stone 
unturned. 
Helen Davidson will be back early tomorrow morning, and I’ll be joining you 
after I’ve been on the Radio National politics panel withFran Kelly after 8am. 
Til we meet again, go well.

Peta Credlin says Tony Abbott has caused Malcolm Turnbull not one scintilla of 
grief in this campaign

A couple of other pieces to bring to your attention from colleagues. Calla 
Wahlquistlooks at the contest in Tasmania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/23/coalitions-fight-for-tasmania-three-seats-under-threat-in-states-north>
. “Ten days out from the 2 July poll, theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> is predicted to lose 
anywhere between one and three of the three northern Tasmanian seats it won 
with a 9.4% statewide swing in 2013.”

My colleague Paul Karp looks at 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/23/a-civil-marriage-equality-debate-only-if-leaders-call-out-homophobia-wherever-it-occurs>
 the looming marriage equality plebiscite, in the event the Coalition is 
returned on July 2. Leadership is required to prevent the people’s vote 
descending into something more ugly, Paul says. “That’s what we need now. Not 
hope that the plebiscite campaign will be civil, in the face of obvious 
evidence to the contrary. But leadership to condemn homophobia wherever it 
rears its head, not just around one’s own dinner table but in one’s own 
political party and around the country.”

While I’m posting, Tony Abbott’s former chief of staff, Peta Credlin is on Sky 
News saying her former boss has been much kinder toMalcolm Turnbull in this 
campaign than he ever was to Abbott. Credlin says Abbott has caused Turnbullnot 
one scintilla of grief in this campaign. Peace, love, and harmony.

More leaflets. A contributed report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/labor-and-greens-promoting-extreme-sex-education-of-safe-schools-says-flyer>
 fromLucy Johnson. Flyers accusing the Greens and Labor of promoting “extreme 
sex education” by backing the Safe Schools initiative aimed at reducing 
homophobic bullying have been distributed by a conservative activist to homes 
across Victoria’s marginal electorates.Patrick Shea, an Inverloch resident, has 
claimed responsibility for authorising the flyer’s distribution and said he 
stands by its claims. “I have been involved with Australian Family Association 
and [conservative Christian lobby group] National Civic Council for a long 
time. We have people who do research and lobbying and so forth and they put the 
flyer together and made sure it was accurate so I was happy to sign off on it,” 
Shea said.

Live blogging in a time of flux

As well as my job here at Guardian Australia, I also contribute a quarterly 
piece to Meanjin, which is one of my favourite Australian publications. An 
essay I contributed about reporting this election campaign has just escaped the 
pay wall this afternoon. It’s a piece about this project, Politics Live, and 
how I approach it, and it’s also about election campaigns being linear events 
in my life, and it’s about this election campaign being the first break with 
the old certainties. This is the first campaign I can remember where I have no 
certainty about what journalism will be like by the time the next one rolls 
around.

Here’s my conclusion.

Structural change has stolen these temporal certainties. We’ve entered a state 
of constant flux, and we’ve cleaved into camps. Some of us are powered by 
nostalgia, eking out what’s left of the glory days of industrial journalism 
crouching from the wind, in some protected zone, holed up in some cosseted 
folly, belching faux gravitas. Others are possessed by a foraging 
instinct—pushing out full tilt into the gale, shapeshifters and entrepreneurs 
and iconoclasts, improvising madly.

As this election rolls round, I’m conscious of a new experience. I really 
can’t predict what journalism will be like three years from now. I don’t know 
when the next signpost rolls around, whether I’ll be fighting still, whether my 
current fight and the good fight going on in newsrooms around the world will 
take us any closer, collectively, to a place of safety and flourishing, or 
whether this will be a burst of activity signifying not very much, a fireworks 
display honouring a dying ritual.

But for now, I know this much. When we step up to cover a campaign, integrity 
is the only certainty we have. And it remains the only thing that matters.

If you’d like to read the whole piece, you can find it here

Back to Michael Keenan and Anne Aly: just a self-evident statement – things 
must be bad for the government in the west to launch such a sortie. What’s the 
textbook definition of low rent? Unleash the hounds, and then lack the 
conviction to actually go toe to toe.

Two international developments are slightly distracting today. I’ve been 
transfixed by a bunch of Democrats staging a sit-in in the US to try and force 
a vote on guns, and the polls have just opened in the United Kingdom for the 
Brexit deliberations. Could be a wild 24 hours. Who knows, we’ll just have to 
wait and see.

Over on my Facebook forum <https://www.facebook.com/murphy.katharine/> reader 
Nick Storr has chimed in on the subject of the Nationals registering Rob 
Oakeshott’s domain name – the development my colleague Amanda Meade brought to 
our attention a couple of posts back.

Take it away Nick Storr:

Just skimming the liveblog and noticed your post about the Nats registering 
roboakeshott.com.au. IIRC that’s against the rules set out by the regulatory 
body for .au domains, which state: “2. Domain names in the com.au 2LD must be:

a) an exact match, abbreviation or acronym of the registrant’s name or 
trademark; or

b) otherwise closely and substantially connected to the registrant, in 
accordance with the categories of “close and substantial connection” set out in 
the Guidelines on the Interpretation of Policy Rules for the Open 2LDs”

https://www.auda.org.au/.../index-of.../2012/2012-04/ 
<https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.auda.org.au%2Fpolicies%2Findex-of-published-policies%2F2012%2F2012-04%2F&h=PAQEzkHaE>

As far as I’m aware there’s no penalty applicable (beyond the risk having the 
domain licence revoked), so it’ll cause no real harm to the National party. But 
it is interesting to note they’re happy to break rules for cheap political 
shenanigans.

Talk to the hand, Anne Aly

There’s been a theme today of fear and smear both at the national level and 
locally. I’ve dropped in a couple of times on a fight in the WA seat of Cowan 
today – the justice ministerMichael Keenan making claims about Labor’s 
candidate in Cowan, the anti-radicalisation expertAnne Aly.

Here’s an exchange from a radio interview Keenan has done in Perth today. The 
Labor candidate called in to ask for a right of reply. Keenan wouldn’t speak to 
her. Fair to say this didn’t go very well.

Here’s the relevant section of the interview.

Q: Dr Anne Aly is on the other line would you be interested in discussing this 
with her on air? Because you weren’t keen to do so before.

KEENAN: Well look I’m very happy to debate my opposition counterpart who is 
David Feeney and I’ve been trying to debate him…

Q: But not the person to whom you’ve made this allegation.

KEENAN: Well look it’s very unusual for a government minister to debate a 
Labor candidate Geoff as you’re well aware. I’m very happy to…

Q: What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that?

KEENAN: I’m very happy to debate David Feeney who is my opposite number within 
the opposition about this and if you could facilitate that I would be very 
happy to do that

Q: But Michael you also know that this is the allegation you’re making against 
Dr Aly, she wants to defend it and you won’t debate her on it. It does rather 
look as if you’re seeking to control the nature of the discussion and I just 
wondered whether people weren’t entitled to be aware of that.

KEENAN: Well it doesn’t Geoff as you’re well aware it would be very unusual 
for a government minister to debate a Labor candidate…

Q: She’s here and waiting you can talk to her now…

KEENAN: …I’m, I’m very happy to debate my opposite number who happens to be 
David Feeney in fact we were due to have a debate in Canberra today but he 
cancelled. Now if you would like to facilitate that I would be very interested 
to know, for example, whether Mr Feeney supports the thoughts of the views of 
their candidate for Cowan.

Q: There is one thing that I would like to ask you before we finish up and 
that is, you would also be aware that Dr Aly has been targeted in an anti-Islam 
social media campaigning, nothing to do with your party or the government, but 
I’ve got a post in front of me which depicts Dr Aly’s face on to a picture of a 
gun-toting, Quran waving, ISIS fighter saying she’s not the best choice for 
Cowan so vote for someone else, I’m just wondering: as the federal justice 
minister and the minister assisting the prime minister for counter-terrorism, 
is this, is this a slightly dangerous game to be playing?

KEENAN: Well I don’t think it’s dangerous to point out the fact that the Labor 
party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> has candidates 
that don’t support their stated position on national security laws. That would 
actually be a very standard thing for political parties to do during an 
election. Um, the question is whether the Labor party’s candidates supports the 
sorts of things the Labor Party says that they support, now clearly in the case 
of their candidate for Cowan, that is not the case.

Q: But would you also acknowledge too that your government has provided 
considerable support for Dr Anne Aly and the work that she does?

KEENAN: But as I said Geoff we funded an organisation that she has something 
to do with, to run an early intervention program we certainly have not funded 
her to provide letters of support for known hate preachers and for people who 
are convicted criminals.

Q: This is the end of our discussion. I’m sorry you can’t continue it with Dr 
Anne Aly but for now, thank you for your time.

KEENAN: Well as I said Geoff I’m very happy to debate my opposite number any 
time you can get him on the program…

Q: I really don’t think that is particularly relevant at this time, with 
respect Michael Keenan is the federal justice minister, Dr Anne Aly is Labor’s 
Cowan candidate. Dr Aly, good morning to you….

ALY: Good morning Geoff.

Q: What do you make of what you’ve just heard?

ALY: Oh well I think it’s all a bit bizarre that a government that has 
supported my program, has supported a non-government organisation that I more 
than just a little something to do with, I was the founding chair of that 
organisation, a government that has in parliament, there in Hansard, applauded 
the work that I do, their minister applauding the work that I do, a government 
where I have worked with backbencher and frontbencher, MP, on the work that I 
do, and that suddenly now at the pointy end of an election the minister for 
justice turns around and tried this pretty despicable smear campaign. I think 
it debases the whole election and I think it debases his role as the minister.

When imitation is not the most sincere form of flattery

A bit of news from the world of political independents.

When Rob Oakeshott decided to run for the seat of Cowper he investigated 
possible domains to promote his campaign. Unfortunatelywww.roboakeshott.com 
<http://www.roboakeshott.com/> had been left idle by the former independent MP 
who has been working for the UN in recent years and had beensnapped up 
<http://www.sbs.com.au/news/thefeed/article/2016/06/10/rob-oakeshott-announces-hes-standing-parliament-probably-should-have-bought-his>
 by a penis pump company. No, really.

But now Oakeshott’s team has discovered another possible domain 
www.roboakeshott.com.au <http://www.roboakeshott.com.au/> is also unavailable. 
And who would want a website calledRob Oakeshott? The website was registered by 
the National Party of Australia this week.

Better late than never, let's take stock

Let’s work through today, thus far. This selection of pictures gives you the 
tempo of the day very effectively.Malcolm Turnbull has been zapped with a 
cattle prod. Bouncy bouncy.

manufacturer, Quickstep, in Geelong, on Thursday. Photograph: Lukas Coch/EPA

Bill Shorten is less bouncy bouncy. But then his tempo isn’t hugely variable 
out on the hustings. He’s upped the ante since last Friday but he’s been loping 
at a steady but quick tempo since day one.

To the sum of the parts. We are into scares, sand bagging, and shoring up at 
this point of the campaign.

Let’s keep this simple. Malcolm Turnbull is throwing everything but the 
kitchen sink at Corangamite in Victoria, dragging the CFA dispute back into 
proceedings both as a local tactic and a national one: wickedBill Shorten owned 
by the unions. Oh, and boats. Labor is very bad on boats.

Bill Shorten is trying to peel back votes from the NXT in South Australia 
before moving on to the next marginal seat, up north, in the territory. In the 
national conversation, it’s still Medicare. WickedCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, up to no good.

The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, wants to clean up politics with more 
donations and disclosure reform and a federal Icac that he may or may not 
insist on as part of any hypothetical minority government conversation that may 
or may not happen after 2 July.

Ho, ho, here we go.

'You are voting for a rag tag militia of candidates'

One more before a summary. I mentioned in the coverage earlier today that 
Labor is trying to claw back ground in South Australia because the opposition 
is not performing strongly enough. Interesting in this context to seeBill 
Shorten going after the NXT on penalty rates.

We are not like Senator Xenophon’s candidate ... you are voting for a rag tag 
militia of candidates.

Medicare, today's developments

I did promise I would work through Labor’s latest effort on the Medicare 
anti-privatisation campaign. Let’s do that now.

Today the dispute has been over the school vaccination register. As my 
colleaguePaul Karp reports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/23/coalition>, from 2017 
the national cervical cancer vaccination register will be expanded to become 
the Australian school vaccination register, which will capture all adolescent 
vaccinations given through school programs. The register is currently run by 
the Victorian Cytology Service, a not-for-profit health organisation.

The government has issued a tender 
<https://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.atm.showClosed&ATMUUID=C188C3CB-0C03-C3BC-37F7268CA73F3A94>
 for organisations to bid to run the register, which Labor has warned “could 
mean that, for the first time, the vaccination details of school children could 
be in for-profit hands”. A Coalition spokeswoman has told Guardian Australia 
the government does not have to pay to access information on the register, and 
this will not change when a tender contract is ultimately awarded.

More generally, I’ve said earlier this week that Labor’s offensive on Medicare 
is clear over reach. Outsourcing the payments system does not equate to 
privatisation. It really doesn’t. Again today, this micro sortie on the 
register feels like a stretch.

Basically Labor is trying to pull the government over into a discussion of 
issues that favour Labor electorally. The backroom judgment is ifMalcolm 
Turnbull is sounding defensive on health, you can score that day to Labor. 
Health really resonates with voters, and theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has known throughout the 
campaign that it is not on strong political ground if the conversation veers to 
health. Quite apart from that issue, Shorten had to punch through and create 
some combat in this closing stage of the campaign to counter the government’s 
efforts to lull voters into sticking with the incumbents.

We see it with the Coalition’s over-egging on boats and Labor’s over-egging on 
Medicare: facts are for wimps.

A bit more on fear and smear in Cowan

Michael Safi

Murph drew your attention earlier today to the federal justice minister, 
Michael Keenan, criticising Labor’s candidate in Cowan for writing a “letter of 
support” last year forJunaid Thorne, a self-styled Muslim preacher who was 
appealing against a jail sentence for flying under a false name.

Anne Aly, the Labor candidate, is an expert in violent extremism who has 
received federal government funding for her work. Guardian Australia has 
obtained a copy of the letter in question. It deals primarily with Thorne’s 
co-conspirator,Mostafa Shiddiquzzaman, who was aged 19 when the pair flew to 
Sydney from Perth using false names. Here are the references to Thorne, which 
Aly made after meeting both men in Sydney:

“During the meeting [with the pair] I advised both clients that they should 
pursue re-entry into higher education and offered assistance to help them 
re-enrol in university courses in Sydney and/or Perth.

“I also advised the clients that they should access mentoring and counselling 
services and offered to provide these support services to them in Perth.”

She encouraged Thorne “to develop his family attachments with his mother and 
siblings in Perth”.

“I have also discussed the possibility of Mr Thorne making regular monthly 
visits to Perth to meet with me as part of a mentoring program designed to 
facilitate his reintegration and assist him in pursuing his studies and 
developing positive attachments,” she said.

Thorne’s sentence was reduced by one month on appeal, the judge making 
reference to Aly’s letter in his reasoning.

Keenan’s use of it on Thursday has angered Lydia Shelly, the solicitor who 
engaged Aly’s services in the case. “Shiddiquzzaman has followed her 
recommendations. He’s gone back to Perth, disassociated his radical links, 
returned to university and reunited with his family,” she says.

“Anne has essentially given back a family their son. She has saved that young 
person and put him back on the right track.

“I’m very disappointed the justice minister would use this to score cheap 
political points,” she says.

Well folks it’s been great but it’s also enough for now. If you are hanging on 
every word of the campaign, don’t forget to watchBill Shorten on the 7.30 
Report tonight. Our ownMike Bowers is also on Kitchen Cabinet on the ABC later 
on this evening.

Let’s assess the sum of today’s parts.

 * It was a blergh muck day: leaflets, scares and counter scares, bucket jobs 
– every variety of low road got an outing at some point today, the day perhaps 
reaching its zenith when the justice ministerMichael Keenan bucketed a Labor 
candidate but refused to speak to said candidate when she rung in to one of his 
radio interviews bucketing her seeking a right of reply.

 * Malcolm Turnbull concentrated his efforts on Victoria, specifically 
Corangamite, before tracking further south.Bill Shorten concentrated his 
efforts on Adelaide and harvesting some of the protest vote currently flowing
Nick Xenophon’s way before flying north. The current mantra is leave no stone 
unturned. 
Helen Davidson will be back early tomorrow morning, and I’ll be joining you 
after I’ve been on the Radio National politics panel withFran Kelly after 8am. 
Til we meet again, go well.
 
A couple of other pieces to bring to your attention from colleagues. Calla 
Wahlquistlooks at the contest in Tasmania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/23/coalitions-fight-for-tasmania-three-seats-under-threat-in-states-north>
. “Ten days out from the 2 July poll, theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> is predicted to lose 
anywhere between one and three of the three northern Tasmanian seats it won 
with a 9.4% statewide swing in 2013.”

My colleague Paul Karp looks at 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/23/a-civil-marriage-equality-debate-only-if-leaders-call-out-homophobia-wherever-it-occurs>
 the looming marriage equality plebiscite, in the event the Coalition is 
returned on July 2. Leadership is required to prevent the people’s vote 
descending into something more ugly, Paul says. “That’s what we need now. Not 
hope that the plebiscite campaign will be civil, in the face of obvious 
evidence to the contrary. But leadership to condemn homophobia wherever it 
rears its head, not just around one’s own dinner table but in one’s own 
political party and around the country.”

While I’m posting, Tony Abbott’s former chief of staff, Peta Credlin is on Sky 
News saying her former boss has been much kinder toMalcolm Turnbull in this 
campaign than he ever was to Abbott. Credlin says Abbott has caused Turnbullnot 
one scintilla of grief in this campaign. Peace, love, and harmony.
 
More leaflets. A contributed report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/labor-and-greens-promoting-extreme-sex-education-of-safe-schools-says-flyer>
 fromLucy Johnson. Flyers accusing the Greens and Labor of promoting “extreme 
sex education” by backing the Safe Schools initiative aimed at reducing 
homophobic bullying have been distributed by a conservative activist to homes 
across Victoria’s marginal electorates.Patrick Shea, an Inverloch resident, has 
claimed responsibility for authorising the flyer’s distribution and said he 
stands by its claims. “I have been involved with Australian Family Association 
and [conservative Christian lobby group] National Civic Council for a long 
time. We have people who do research and lobbying and so forth and they put the 
flyer together and made sure it was accurate so I was happy to sign off on it,” 
Shea said.
 
As well as my job here at Guardian Australia, I also contribute a quarterly 
piece to Meanjin, which is one of my favourite Australian publications. An 
essay I contributed about reporting this election campaign has just escaped the 
pay wall this afternoon. It’s a piece about this project, Politics Live, and 
how I approach it, and it’s also about election campaigns being linear events 
in my life, and it’s about this election campaign being the first break with 
the old certainties. This is the first campaign I can remember where I have no 
certainty about what journalism will be like by the time the next one rolls 
around.

Here’s my conclusion.

Structural change has stolen these temporal certainties. We’ve entered a state 
of constant flux, and we’ve cleaved into camps. Some of us are powered by 
nostalgia, eking out what’s left of the glory days of industrial journalism 
crouching from the wind, in some protected zone, holed up in some cosseted 
folly, belching faux gravitas. Others are possessed by a foraging 
instinct—pushing out full tilt into the gale, shapeshifters and entrepreneurs 
and iconoclasts, improvising madly.

As this election rolls round, I’m conscious of a new experience. I really 
can’t predict what journalism will be like three years from now. I don’t know 
when the next signpost rolls around, whether I’ll be fighting still, whether my 
current fight and the good fight going on in newsrooms around the world will 
take us any closer, collectively, to a place of safety and flourishing, or 
whether this will be a burst of activity signifying not very much, a fireworks 
display honouring a dying ritual.

But for now, I know this much. When we step up to cover a campaign, integrity 
is the only certainty we have. And it remains the only thing that matters.

If you’d like to read the whole piece, you can find it here

Back to Michael Keenan and Anne Aly: just a self-evident statement – things 
must be bad for the government in the west to launch such a sortie. What’s the 
textbook definition of low rent? Unleash the hounds, and then lack the 
conviction to actually go toe to toe.
 
Two international developments are slightly distracting today. I’ve been 
transfixed by a bunch of Democrats staging a sit-in in the US to try and force 
a vote on guns, and the polls have just opened in the United Kingdom for the 
Brexit deliberations. Could be a wild 24 hours. Who knows, we’ll just have to 
wait and see.
 
Over on my Facebook forum <https://www.facebook.com/murphy.katharine/> reader 
Nick Storr has chimed in on the subject of the Nationals registering Rob 
Oakeshott’s domain name – the development my colleague Amanda Meade brought to 
our attention a couple of posts back.

Take it away Nick Storr:

Just skimming the liveblog and noticed your post about the Nats registering 
roboakeshott.com.au. IIRC that’s against the rules set out by the regulatory 
body for .au domains, which state: “2. Domain names in the com.au 2LD must be:

a) an exact match, abbreviation or acronym of the registrant’s name or 
trademark; or

b) otherwise closely and substantially connected to the registrant, in 
accordance with the categories of “close and substantial connection” set out in 
the Guidelines on the Interpretation of Policy Rules for the Open 2LDs”

https://www.auda.org.au/.../index-of.../2012/2012-04/ 
<https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.auda.org.au%2Fpolicies%2Findex-of-published-policies%2F2012%2F2012-04%2F&h=PAQEzkHaE>

As far as I’m aware there’s no penalty applicable (beyond the risk having the 
domain licence revoked), so it’ll cause no real harm to the National party. But 
it is interesting to note they’re happy to break rules for cheap political 
shenanigans.

 
There’s been a theme today of fear and smear both at the national level and 
locally. I’ve dropped in a couple of times on a fight in the WA seat of Cowan 
today – the justice ministerMichael Keenan making claims about Labor’s 
candidate in Cowan, the anti-radicalisation expertAnne Aly.

Here’s an exchange from a radio interview Keenan has done in Perth today. The 
Labor candidate called in to ask for a right of reply. Keenan wouldn’t speak to 
her. Fair to say this didn’t go very well.

Here’s the relevant section of the interview.

Q: Dr Anne Aly is on the other line would you be interested in discussing this 
with her on air? Because you weren’t keen to do so before.

KEENAN: Well look I’m very happy to debate my opposition counterpart who is 
David Feeney and I’ve been trying to debate him…

Q: But not the person to whom you’ve made this allegation.

KEENAN: Well look it’s very unusual for a government minister to debate a 
Labor candidate Geoff as you’re well aware. I’m very happy to…

Q: What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that?

KEENAN: I’m very happy to debate David Feeney who is my opposite number within 
the opposition about this and if you could facilitate that I would be very 
happy to do that

Q: But Michael you also know that this is the allegation you’re making against 
Dr Aly, she wants to defend it and you won’t debate her on it. It does rather 
look as if you’re seeking to control the nature of the discussion and I just 
wondered whether people weren’t entitled to be aware of that.

KEENAN: Well it doesn’t Geoff as you’re well aware it would be very unusual 
for a government minister to debate a Labor candidate…

Q: She’s here and waiting you can talk to her now…

KEENAN: …I’m, I’m very happy to debate my opposite number who happens to be 
David Feeney in fact we were due to have a debate in Canberra today but he 
cancelled. Now if you would like to facilitate that I would be very interested 
to know, for example, whether Mr Feeney supports the thoughts of the views of 
their candidate for Cowan.

Q: There is one thing that I would like to ask you before we finish up and 
that is, you would also be aware that Dr Aly has been targeted in an anti-Islam 
social media campaigning, nothing to do with your party or the government, but 
I’ve got a post in front of me which depicts Dr Aly’s face on to a picture of a 
gun-toting, Quran waving, ISIS fighter saying she’s not the best choice for 
Cowan so vote for someone else, I’m just wondering: as the federal justice 
minister and the minister assisting the prime minister for counter-terrorism, 
is this, is this a slightly dangerous game to be playing?

KEENAN: Well I don’t think it’s dangerous to point out the fact that the Labor 
party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> has candidates 
that don’t support their stated position on national security laws. That would 
actually be a very standard thing for political parties to do during an 
election. Um, the question is whether the Labor party’s candidates supports the 
sorts of things the Labor Party says that they support, now clearly in the case 
of their candidate for Cowan, that is not the case.

Q: But would you also acknowledge too that your government has provided 
considerable support for Dr Anne Aly and the work that she does?

KEENAN: But as I said Geoff we funded an organisation that she has something 
to do with, to run an early intervention program we certainly have not funded 
her to provide letters of support for known hate preachers and for people who 
are convicted criminals.

Q: This is the end of our discussion. I’m sorry you can’t continue it with Dr 
Anne Aly but for now, thank you for your time.

KEENAN: Well as I said Geoff I’m very happy to debate my opposite number any 
time you can get him on the program…

Q: I really don’t think that is particularly relevant at this time, with 
respect Michael Keenan is the federal justice minister, Dr Anne Aly is Labor’s 
Cowan candidate. Dr Aly, good morning to you….

ALY: Good morning Geoff.

Q: What do you make of what you’ve just heard?

ALY: Oh well I think it’s all a bit bizarre that a government that has 
supported my program, has supported a non-government organisation that I more 
than just a little something to do with, I was the founding chair of that 
organisation, a government that has in parliament, there in Hansard, applauded 
the work that I do, their minister applauding the work that I do, a government 
where I have worked with backbencher and frontbencher, MP, on the work that I 
do, and that suddenly now at the pointy end of an election the minister for 
justice turns around and tried this pretty despicable smear campaign. I think 
it debases the whole election and I think it debases his role as the minister.

A bit of news from the world of political independents.

When Rob Oakeshott decided to run for the seat of Cowper he investigated 
possible domains to promote his campaign. Unfortunatelywww.roboakeshott.com 
<http://www.roboakeshott.com/> had been left idle by the former independent MP 
who has been working for the UN in recent years and had beensnapped up 
<http://www.sbs.com.au/news/thefeed/article/2016/06/10/rob-oakeshott-announces-hes-standing-parliament-probably-should-have-bought-his>
 by a penis pump company. No, really.

But now Oakeshott’s team has discovered another possible domain 
www.roboakeshott.com.au <http://www.roboakeshott.com.au/> is also unavailable. 
And who would want a website calledRob Oakeshott? The website was registered by 
the National Party of Australia this week.
 
Let’s work through today, thus far. This selection of pictures gives you the 
tempo of the day very effectively.Malcolm Turnbull has been zapped with a 
cattle prod. Bouncy bouncy.

Bill Shorten is less bouncy bouncy. But then his tempo isn’t hugely variable 
out on the hustings. He’s upped the ante since last Friday but he’s been loping 
at a steady but quick tempo since day one.

To the sum of the parts. We are into scares, sand bagging, and shoring up at 
this point of the campaign.

Let’s keep this simple. Malcolm Turnbull is throwing everything but the 
kitchen sink at Corangamite in Victoria, dragging the CFA dispute back into 
proceedings both as a local tactic and a national one: wickedBill Shorten owned 
by the unions. Oh, and boats. Labor is very bad on boats.

Bill Shorten is trying to peel back votes from the NXT in South Australia 
before moving on to the next marginal seat, up north, in the territory. In the 
national conversation, it’s still Medicare. WickedCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, up to no good.

The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, wants to clean up politics with more 
donations and disclosure reform and a federal Icac that he may or may not 
insist on as part of any hypothetical minority government conversation that may 
or may not happen after 2 July.

Ho, ho, here we go.
 
One more before a summary. I mentioned in the coverage earlier today that 
Labor is trying to claw back ground in South Australia because the opposition 
is not performing strongly enough. Interesting in this context to seeBill 
Shorten going after the NXT on penalty rates.

I did promise I would work through Labor’s latest effort on the Medicare 
anti-privatisation campaign. Let’s do that now.

Today the dispute has been over the school vaccination register. As my 
colleaguePaul Karp reports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/23/coalition>, from 2017 
the national cervical cancer vaccination register will be expanded to become 
the Australian school vaccination register, which will capture all adolescent 
vaccinations given through school programs. The register is currently run by 
the Victorian Cytology Service, a not-for-profit health organisation.

The government has issued a tender 
<https://www.tenders.gov.au/?event=public.atm.showClosed&ATMUUID=C188C3CB-0C03-C3BC-37F7268CA73F3A94>
 for organisations to bid to run the register, which Labor has warned “could 
mean that, for the first time, the vaccination details of school children could 
be in for-profit hands”. A Coalition spokeswoman has told Guardian Australia 
the government does not have to pay to access information on the register, and 
this will not change when a tender contract is ultimately awarded.

More generally, I’ve said earlier this week that Labor’s offensive on Medicare 
is clear over reach. Outsourcing the payments system does not equate to 
privatisation. It really doesn’t. Again today, this micro sortie on the 
register feels like a stretch.

Basically Labor is trying to pull the government over into a discussion of 
issues that favour Labor electorally. The backroom judgment is ifMalcolm 
Turnbull is sounding defensive on health, you can score that day to Labor. 
Health really resonates with voters, and theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has known throughout the 
campaign that it is not on strong political ground if the conversation veers to 
health. Quite apart from that issue, Shorten had to punch through and create 
some combat in this closing stage of the campaign to counter the government’s 
efforts to lull voters into sticking with the incumbents.

We see it with the Coalition’s over-egging on boats and Labor’s over-egging on 
Medicare: facts are for wimps.
 
Murph drew your attention earlier today to the federal justice minister, 
Michael Keenan, criticising Labor’s candidate in Cowan for writing a “letter of 
support” last year forJunaid Thorne, a self-styled Muslim preacher who was 
appealing against a jail sentence for flying under a false name.

Anne Aly, the Labor candidate, is an expert in violent extremism who has 
received federal government funding for her work. Guardian Australia has 
obtained a copy of the letter in question. It deals primarily with Thorne’s 
co-conspirator,Mostafa Shiddiquzzaman, who was aged 19 when the pair flew to 
Sydney from Perth using false names. Here are the references to Thorne, which 
Aly made after meeting both men in Sydney:

“During the meeting [with the pair] I advised both clients that they should 
pursue re-entry into higher education and offered assistance to help them 
re-enrol in university courses in Sydney and/or Perth.

“I also advised the clients that they should access mentoring and counselling 
services and offered to provide these support services to them in Perth.”

She encouraged Thorne “to develop his family attachments with his mother and 
siblings in Perth”.

“I have also discussed the possibility of Mr Thorne making regular monthly 
visits to Perth to meet with me as part of a mentoring program designed to 
facilitate his reintegration and assist him in pursuing his studies and 
developing positive attachments,” she said.

Thorne’s sentence was reduced by one month on appeal, the judge making 
reference to Aly’s letter in his reasoning.

Keenan’s use of it on Thursday has angered Lydia Shelly, the solicitor who 
engaged Aly’s services in the case. “Shiddiquzzaman has followed her 
recommendations. He’s gone back to Perth, disassociated his radical links, 
returned to university and reunited with his family,” she says.

“Anne has essentially given back a family their son. She has saved that young
