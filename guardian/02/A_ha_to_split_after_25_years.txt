After 25 years of pouting and posing, A-ha 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/a-ha> are calling it quits. The Norwegian 
pop trio have announced that they will go their separate ways at the end of 
2010.

"Change is always difficult and it is easy to get set in one's ways," the 
group said. "Now it is time to move on." Of course, A-ha are not moving on 
quite yet. Morten Harket, Paul Waaktaar-Savoy and Magne Furuholmen will stage a 
global farewell tour over the next 13 and a half months, finishing with a 4 
December gig in Norway in 2010. Tickets for the final concert, at Oslo's 
Spektrum arena,went on sale this morning <http://www.billetservice.no/>.

Beginning with their 1985 debut, Hunting High and Low, A-ha have been one of 
the most enduring acts in pop. Buoyed by early hits like Take On Me and The Sun 
Always Shines On TV, A-ha have sold more than 35m albums worldwide. Their ninth 
studio album, Foot of the Mountain, reached No 5 earlier this year.

"We've literally lived the ultimate boy's adventure tale," the group said, 
overlooking most boys' preference for swords and spaceships over fancy 
haircuts. "[Splitting up] will give us a chance to get more involved in other 
meaningful aspects of life, be it humanitarian work, politics, or whatever else 
â€“ and, of course, through new constellations in the field of art and music."

A-ha have broken up once before, after the commercial flop of 1993's Memorial 
Beach. Around that time, members of the band began recording side- and 
solo-projects; this continued even after the group re-formed at the Nobel Peace 
Prize concert in 1998. With the promise that "[A-ha] are retiring as a band, 
not as individuals," further solo releases seem likely.
