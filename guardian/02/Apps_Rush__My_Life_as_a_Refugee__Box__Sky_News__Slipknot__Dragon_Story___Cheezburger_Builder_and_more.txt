GetTaxi <http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/46787/?lang=en>

A thought: why have so many of the taxi-hailing apps focused on iOS and 
Android, when a lot of the people taking taxis everywhere (in London at least) 
are still on BlackBerry smartphones? GetTaxi is hoping to capitalise with its 
BlackBerry app, which is currently available in London and Tel Aviv.

Travel Angel from Orange 
<http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/125926/>

Here's another useful BlackBerry app, from UK operator Orange. It tracks data, 
text and call usage when you're abroad: "giving you total control so you can 
see how much you've spent to date". Okay, so cutting roaming rates for all of 
the above would be good too, but at least being able to track usage is a start.

Play by AOL <http://www.playbyaol.com/>

AOL has launched a new version of its music app Play by AOL for Amazon's 
Kindle Fire tablet. it's a music player with social features built in, and 
while the news isn't much use for people in the UK – where the Kindle Fire 
isn't available – the fact that the app has been revamped for a seven-inch 
tablet hints that it could also be coming to Google's Nexus 7 in the near 
future.
