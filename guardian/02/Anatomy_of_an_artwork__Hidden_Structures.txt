Folding

The work featured in the illustration above is a frottage drawing on paper, 
and is a single element of a series of six pencil rubbings. Each element traces 
a different set of folds in the paper, creating individual, geometrically 
abstract patterns.

Maths

In all six drawings, diamonds, squares and triangles cut over each other. 
There’s a sense of both endless possibility – so a case of mathematic 
abstraction as well as artistic – and that Maurer has been very careful about 
her decisions on where to fold.

Human presence

The fact that we are reminded of Maurer’s presence is not a coincidence. There 
is a performative element to all her work, and she constantly reminds us that 
the art we see is the product of a human body, and human decision-making.

Politics

It is perhaps worth noting that this ode to personal autonomy and subjective 
determination was made in communist Hungary. It is political art, but of a type 
that is more than subtle enough to fly under the radar of state repression.

Fame

“I don’t want to be a star or suchlike,” Maurer has said. Increasingly, 
however, she’s looking like one. Now 78, and long respected at home, her work 
is striking a chord with a wider audience.
