Australia Post <https://www.theguardian.com/business/australia-post> has 
warned its losses will amount to $6bn over the next 10 years unless the 
government allows it to change the price of sending letters.


The national carrier is forecasting its first full-year loss in 30 years, or 
since before it was corporatised.


Its chief executive, Ahmed Fahour, said Australia Post had a competitive 
parcel business, but losses from its letters business were swallowing up 
profits.


Fahour said the government understood the scale of the problem. “They either 
fund the next 10 years of losses, which could amount to $6bn, or we’re out of 
business,” he told Fairfax radio on Monday.

Australia Post reported a first-half profit after tax of $98m, down 56% on the 
first-half result of the previous year.


The letters business lost $151m, 57% worse than the loss in the first half of 
last financial year.


Fahour said Australia Post wanted to offer regular customers two-speed letter 
pricing, similar to that which businesses and the government sector uses.


He said that would allow the company to focus its resources on competing with 
the growing number of multinational parcel companies entering Australia.


“We’ve said that we need a decision this financial year. Right now we’re in 
February and the clock is ticking,” he said.


 Fahour said Australia Post had never been subsidised and had always paid 
dividends to the government, but the world had changed.


“Either we get a massive injection from the government to keep the business 
going, or they give us the permission to manage the business and therefore no 
subsidy is required and the business can continue,” he said.


Letter volume decline accelerated to 8.2% year-on-year, the largest fall 
recorded since Australia Post’s letter volumes started falling in 2008.
