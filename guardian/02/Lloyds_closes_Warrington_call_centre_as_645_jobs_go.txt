Lloyds Banking Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group> has blamed the 
closure of a call centre in Warrington – part of an announcement of 645 job 
cuts – on customers preferring to bank online. Call volumes are down 11% so far 
this year, although trade unions have warned that the job losses risked 
damaging customer service.

The 645 job cuts take the number lost since António Horta-Osório took the helm 
of the bank in 2011

 to 13,055. He has earmarked 15,000 cuts as part of a three-year strategy, on 
top of 30,000 lost as a result of Lloyds TSB's rescue of HBOS in 2008 to create 
the larger group.

About 180 jobs are going from Warrington – which will close – with 120 moving 
to Speke, Liverpool. In total 645 jobs are going across several areas, although 
65 will be created.

"This is the third tranche of job losses since the beginning of the year and 
is in danger of sending staff morale to an all-time low," said Rob MacGregor, 
of Unite. "The closure of the Warrington centre will hit the local economy and 
risks damaging customer service," he added. Officials at the Accord union said 
there was "no end in sight" for job cuts.

A Lloyds spokesperson said: "Telephone banking call volumes are falling as 
digital banking continues to grow, and we are refocusing the business to 
reflect these changes in our customers' habits, while ensuring we maintain our 
high standards for those who wish to continue using our telephone banking 
systems by bringing our telephone banking colleagues together at fewer, more 
specialised sites."
