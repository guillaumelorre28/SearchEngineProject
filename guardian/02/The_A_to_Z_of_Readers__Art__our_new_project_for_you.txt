We have been enjoying your artistic talent for three years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/series/readers-art> now. From light 
to still lives, we have offered you a theme every month – and you have sent us 
your brilliant artworks around it. We are now putting the finishing touches on 
our London exhibition, which will open on 15 September in our headquarters at 
Kings Place.

Coinciding with this landmark, our monthly assignments will now change. 
Introducing the A to Z of Readers’ Art: from now on, we will ask guest artists, 
curators and critics to choose our monthly themes, in alphabetical order. Those 
will include artistic movements, ideas, art history milestones, and more. We 
will have a piece introducing each theme and, at the end of the month, our 
guest will choose a few of their favourites.

Let’s start! For our September challenge, critic Jonathan Jones invites you to 
surprise us 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/01/share-your-artworks-about-art-readers-art-a-to-z-assignment>
: create your own self-referential work of art about art.
