A terminally ill child has become the first minor to be helped to die since 
Belgium voted to allowvoluntary euthanasia for children 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/13/belgium-law-extends-euthanasia-children-all-ages>
 in 2014.

The head of Belgium’s federal euthanasia commission, Wim Distelmans, gave no 
details other than to say it was an exceptional case of a child with a terminal 
illness that a local doctor had reported last week.

“Fortunately there are very few children who are considered, but that does not 
mean we should refuse them the right to a dignified death,” Distelmans told a 
Belgian newspaper.

Belgium legalised euthanasia in 2002 and two years ago amended the rules to 
become the first country in the world to permit doctors to help terminally ill 
minors of any age to die.Children <https://www.theguardian.com/society/children>
 of any age are allowed to choose to end their suffering, as long as they are 
able to make rational decisions and are in the final stages of an incurable 
disease.

The amendment, which was passed after much debate – notably over the meaning 
of a required “capacity of discernment” – offers the possibility of euthanasia 
to children “in a hopeless medical situation of constant and unbearable 
suffering that cannot be eased and which will cause death in the short term”.

Any request for euthanasia must be made by the minor, be studied by a team of 
doctors and an independent psychiatrist or psychologist, and have parental 
consent. In the Netherlands the practice is allowed for children aged at least 
12.

Between 2003 and 2013, the number of patients being euthanised in Belgium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/belgium> rose nearly eight-fold to 8,752 , 
according to the national euthanasia control committee’s records.
