Everything on the internet gets paid for, one way or another. If you’re not 
paying yourself, you’re some other player’s currency. The customer is the 
advertiser, andyou, your friendships and your beliefs

 are what is being very profitably sold. This is why Facebook and Google and 
all the rest are so keen to track you on screen and off. This is how they know 
or make very well-informed guesses at your sex, age, location, relationships, 
ethnicity and sexual preference, and that is howFacebook in the US has been 
caught

 offering real estate ads that discriminate against named ethnic groups. The 
American investigative journalism site ProPublica was able to place an ad 
targeted very precisely at people in New York who were looking for housing, but 
not black, Asian or Hispanic. Facebook defended itself by saying that “ethnic 
affinity” was not the same as race, which the company does not ask about 
directly: it is instead a measure derived from looking at what stories people 
like, who they are friends with, and which websites they visit. There’s no 
reason to suppose the company intended to facilitate or condone illegal 
discrimination. But the story remains a chilling illustration of the power and 
reach ofbig data <https://mathbabe.org/>. Imagine what will happen when this is 
bent to political ends.
