American Splendor <https://www.theguardian.com/film/american-splendor>, the 
story of a grumpy file clerk turned comic book superhero, has staked its claim 
for an Oscar after being voted best picture by America's prestigious National 
Society of Film Critics.

Starring Paul Giamatti <https://www.theguardian.com/film/paul-giamatti> as 
Harvey Pekar, the hospital clerk who turned his everyday life into a comic 
series, the film has already received a Golden Globe nomination and an award 
from the New York film critics' circle.

 Both those bodies chose to honour Hope Davis for her performance as 
Giamatti's soulmate Joyce Brabner. The NSFC is the first major US organisation 
to reward Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini's movie in the best film 
category. It also won best screenplay.

Other early contenders for the Academy Awards best film gong include The 
Return of the King, which won the corresponding New York film critics' circle 
award. Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain and 
horse racing drama Seabiscuit have all received Golden Globe nominations and 
the Bill Murray vehicle Lost in Translation is also hotly tipped after winning 
the San Francisco film critics' circle best film award.
