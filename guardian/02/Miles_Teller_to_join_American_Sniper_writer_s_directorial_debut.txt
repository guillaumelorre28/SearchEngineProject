The Hollywood Reporter suggests 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/miles-teller-talks-star-ptsd-812009> 
Teller will play one of three servicemen struggling to cope with their return 
to civilian life in the drama, which is based on the2013 non-fiction book 
<http://us.macmillan.com/thankyouforyourservice/davidfinkel> by Pulitzer 
prize-winning Washington Post reporter David Finkel.Hall was named as the 
director last month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/01/american-sniper-scriptwriter-jason-hall-debut-director-thank-you-for-your-service-david-finkel>
 following the remarkable success of American Sniper, Clint Eastwood’s biopic 
of the late US navy seal Chris Kyle, which scored thehighest US box office 
gross of any film released in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/10/american-sniper-biggest-film-of-2014-us-box-office>
.

DreamWorks studio may hope to tap into a patriotic fervour on Thank You for 
Your Service, as American Sniper’s key events also played heavily on the 
struggles faced by military personnel upon returning from battle zones.

The high-profile gig comes for Teller following the miserable failure of 
superhero epic Fantastic Four at the global box office earlier this month

, taking only $26.2m (£16.8m) in its first weekend. Josh Trank’s film, whichthe 
director has alleged suffered heavy studio interference 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/07/fantastic-four-director-josh-trank-blames-studio-for-poor-reviews>
, received derisive reviews from critics and has been hugely unpopular with 
fans. Teller played the lead role of Reed Richards, AKA Mr Fantastic.
