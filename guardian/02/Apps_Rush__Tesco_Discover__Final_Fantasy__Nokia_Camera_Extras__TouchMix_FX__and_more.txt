TripLingo UK Edition <http://appshopper.com/travel/triplingo-uk-edition>

It's a shame this app doesn't appear to be available in the UK App Store, 
because its description is a hoot. "Top of the morning and tally ho young lad! 
Have a laugh and a jolly good time learning some well good British phrases to 
make sure you don't get Kate Mossed in London!" The idea being travel and 
Olympic-related phrases in "four classic London accents: Posh, Cockney, Scouse, 
and Jafaican (think Ali G!)." Wait, what: Scouse?
