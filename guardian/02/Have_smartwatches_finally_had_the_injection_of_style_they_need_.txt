Smartwatches <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/smartwatches> are still a 
technology niche loved by a few early adopters, but considered ugly, expensive 
and pointless by the majority of people.

 were considered chunky and ugly even by many technology enthusiasts, but 
designs improved a little with Google’s first wave ofAndroid Wear watches 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/02/best-android-wear-smartwatches-ifa-show-berlin>
, with the roundMotorola Moto 360 being a highlight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/15/motorola-moto-360-review-smartwatch-poor-battery-life>
.

Compared to traditional watches, which smartwatches are attempting to replace, 
the chunky profiles and lack of premium fit and finish of last years’ models 
made them a significant downgrade in personal style.

For something worn on you wrist, what it looks like (and thus what it says 
about you) is more important than most technology enthusiasts appreciate.

Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> launched its smartwatch 
in April. It met with mixed reviews, but its industrial design – the look and 
feel, manufacturing and finish – was a cut above the competition.

Now the rest of the market is catching up, as Motorola, Huawei and Samsung 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/samsung> all launch smartwatches with 
design and style front and centre.

Motorola has launched not one, but three new Moto 360 smartwatches. They have 
round screens, come in two sizes and a Sport variant ditches metal for silicone.

Ian Fogg, director of mobile analysis at IHS Technology said 
<https://twitter.com/ianfogg42/status/639150189622640640>: “The new Moto 360 
smartwatch offers female and sport-focused models to increase appeal, plus user 
changeable watch straps and extensive ‘mass customisation’ options similar to 
the company’s Moto X smartphones.”

The round screen still has the flat tyre shape with a piece at the bottom 
housing the watch’s sensors, which was criticised in last year’s model. But 
having two different sizes will appeal to more users, while the all-metal and 
screen design is certainly attractive.

Huawei’s Watch also has a premium look and feel to it that is more reminiscent 
of a man’s metal watch, and a €300 and up price tag to match. It, like all the 
new Android Wear watches, can connect to both Android smartphones and Apple’s 
iPhone.

It’s large circular display is more pixel dense than its rivals, so will 
appear sharper, while its fit and finish is approaching traditional watchmaker 
standards.

Apple’s chief rival Samsung has also improved its smartwatch considerably. 
Gone is the chunky curved oblong that resembled a prisoner ankle bracelet and 
instead Samsung has produced its first round smartwatch, with a premium design 
and innovation in the form of a rotating bezel.

Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight said: “The Gear S2 is a breath of 
fresh air compared to Samsung’s previous smartwatches. It follows the trend set 
by the Moto 360 for a circular display, and at a glance it looks much more like 
a traditional watch than the geek-ware that has characterised most other 
smartwatches to date.”

After having tried out the watch at its launch at the IFA trade show in 
Berlin, Wood described the rotating bezel as “really addictive” and found it 
“reminiscent of how consumers used to idly fiddle with flip and slider phones 
back in the day”.

Samsung has also ditched its requirement of connecting the Gear S2 to a 
Samsung-branded smartphone. Despite running Samsung’s Tizen operating system, 
it will work with any Android smartphone.

Now Android Wear works with the iPhone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/01/android-wear-smartwatches-work-with-iphones>
, the Apple Watch has some direct competition.

While the case for using a smartwatch has yet to be proven, for most 
consumers, at least now the design of the devices is approaching something 
closer to that of watches worn as jewellery.
