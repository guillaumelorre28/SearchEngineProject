The actor, whose last big screen role was alongside Katherine Heigl in the 
2010 comedy Killers, had allegedly stolen from a public hydrant during a 
serious drought inCalifornia <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california>. 
The Calleguas municipal water district spent $22,000 on a private investigator 
to find out whether he had taken it illegally over district boundaries to his 
60-acre estate.

But he has now reached a confidential settlement after lawyers for both sides 
came to an agreement on Thursday. The water district’s resource manager Eric 
Bergh said: “We’re happy about it. It’s good news.”

It brings to an end a case which saw both Selleck and his wife sued for costs 
associated with the investigation as well as legal fees and undetermined 
damages.

Despite growing avocados, the actor has confessed that he actually hates them. 
“Honestly, they make me gag,” he said toPeople 
<http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20595693,00.html> in 2012.

Selleck has been best known for his role in 80s TV show Magnum, P.I. as well 
as film roles in Three Men and a Little Baby, In & Out and Coma. He has most 
recently returned to the small screen for hit show Blue Bloods.
