What would you do if a quarter-tonne bear came charging towards you? Run away 
as fast as you can, or stay where you are and cross your fingers?

If you chose immobility, congratulations! You have what it takes to survive 
the wilds of Alaska. Just ask the touristswhose video of an unpleasantly close 
encounter with a grizzly in Katmai National Park in 2010 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QAh5YQgrXs> has gone viral this week. Larry 
Griffith and his friends were supposed to be watching bears from a safe 
distance when suddenly one of the beasts came racing over to see what they were 
up to. "I could hear and smell his breath and see bits of fish on his teeth," 
said Griffith. The bear circled the group several times, near enough to sniff 
their clothes, before returning to its salmon-fishing.

Throughout, the tourists stayed in their camping chairs. Were they paralysed 
by fear? Not entirely, though Griffith admits he has had nightmares since. In 
fact, they were following their guide's advice to ignore a "bluff charge" that 
was unlikely to end in violence. If they had run away, this would have 
encouraged the bear to see them as prey. And, unlike even the most highly 
motivated human, a hungry grizzly can reach a speed of 30 miles an hour. 
Anyway, what do you think the bear might be saying?
