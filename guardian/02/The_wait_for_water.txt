Lokwawi opens her hands to reveal a pile of hard wild berries. She boils them 
in black sludgy water for four hours for them to soften. This will be her only 
meal for the day. Sixty-five years old and completely blind, she relies on her 
children and a stick to get by.

"I started going blind when our MP visited us for the first and last time, 
when he got elected in 1997," she says with some contempt and almost blaming 
the visit for her disability.

Strips of rotten meat hang on a string in her hut. "That is for days when I 
cannot stand the hunger" she says, plucking one, smelling it and depositing it 
back safely on the string.

Too weak to walk to the water source 16 km away, she has to rely on water 
brought by her children and neighbours, who sometimes do not return for days, 
preferring to stay on, watering their animals at the source.

She has to save the water that is given to her and use it judiciously. She 
says things were better before, there was always water and pasture for the 
animals.

Unaware that she is only 2km from the Ugandan border and oblivious to the 
dangers beyond the mountains where the fierce Dodo tribe lie in wait, she does 
not understand why the chief of her village will not take them there, for she 
says she senses abundant rain and pasture there.
