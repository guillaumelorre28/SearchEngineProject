Aquarius Platinum has suspended operations at the Marikana mine in South 
Africa after five miners were killed in an accident yesterday.

In all seven miners were trapped by a major fall of ground at the project, 
with one in hospital but not in a life-threatening condition and the other 
sustaining minor injuries. The five who were killed were employees of the 
mining contractor, Murray and Roberts Cementation. Work at the Markiana 4 shaft 
where the accident occurred has stopped pending an investigation.

The Marikana project is a joint venture between Aquarius - the world's fourth 
largest platinum producer - andAnglo American's Anglo Platinum division. 

This is the second accident in a month for Aquarius after two deaths led to 
the company suspending operations at its Blue Ridge mine and cutting output 
targets by a fifth. Analyst John Meyer at Fairfax said:

This is terrible news for the families affected and is also terrible news for 
the company. Fatalities significantly affect the morale of a company and union 
and government officials will want to take a close look at the processes which 
have led to the occurrence of two sets of fatalities. We expect platinum group 
metal production to be further affected by these fatalities.

Platinum mining is a hazardous occupation. It is not generally as deep as gold 
mining in South Africa but ground conditions are harsh and mistakes are easily 
made in the underground environment.

The South African government has made health and safety a key priority since 
Zuma came to power and is to investigate fatal incidents thoroughly.

Aquarius shares have fallen 18.5p to 296.3p while Anglo American
