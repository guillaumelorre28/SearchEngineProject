Karin Forseke and Katherine Garrett-Cox have a remarkable talent for 
compromise. Back in the spring, the chair and (for a little while yet) chief 
executive ofAlliance Trust <https://www.theguardian.com/business/alliancetrust>
, spent £3m of shareholders’ funds fighting proposals from Elliott Advisors, a 
New York hedge fund that thought the grand old Dundee-based investment trust 
required a shake-up.

The sport was excellent. Forseke denounced the rebels as “destructive” and 
“aggressive” and the Elliott camp made hay with Garrett-Cox’s £1.4m pay packet, 
an outsized reward for middling investment performance, it argued.

Sadly, Forseke and Garrett-Cox, realising their support among rank-and-file 
investors was not what they hoped or expected, spoiled the fun before the vote. 
They negotiated a truce that saw two of Elliott’s three nominees, previously 
denounced as short-termist yes men, ushered into the boardroom.

Katherine Garrett-Cox to step down from Alliance Trust board

That was the first compromise and inevitably it has led to a second. As 
before, Elliott has got about two-thirds of what it wanted. Costs will be cut; 
the trust will be separated from its fund management division; that fund 
manager can be fired at six months’ notice; share buy-backs will be used to 
narrow the discount to asset value; non-core assets will be sold; and the board 
will comprise only non-executive directors.

That last change means Garrett-Cox will soon have to adapt to a humbler role 
as mere boss of Alliance Trust Investments (ATI), the fund manager. One can 
admire her appetite to stay and prove her stock-picking skills – but, given the 
past fuss, she’d gain more kudos if she told us she was a taking a pay cut to 
do the smaller job.

The reforms could work; the proof, of course, will be the trust’s performance. 
But the process of getting to this point has been tortuous. The Elliott 
nominees, shamefully, never spoke during the battle in the spring.

Forseke, by contrast, has performed verbal gymnastics. She spent those 
millions trying to defend the old system but now says change leaves the trust 
“significantly better positioned”. Her next compromise will surely have to be 
her own departure.

Fast cars, slow response 

Hot news out of Wolfsburg. The top brass at Volkswagen didn’t spent Wednesday 
evening watching their football team lose at Old Trafford. No, they were 
engaged in important business: “[Wednesday] evening, the members of executive 
committee discussed the membership of the committee which had already been 
discussed last week.”


That sentence needs to be deciphered for those who aren’t following every 
twist of Volkswagen’s response to its emissions crisis. The five-strong 
executive committee of the supervisory committee, a sub-set of the full 
20-strong supervisory committee, is establishing yet another committee to 
investigate the scandal.

That’s an awful lot of committees, and an awful lot of discussion about 
committees. No wonder Thursday’s statement also carried the news that 
“completion of investigations will take at least several months”.

In the meantime, someone at Volkswagen – probably not sitting in a committee 
meeting – realised that there were still cars on sale which may have the dodgy 
software.About 4,000 vehicles with EA 189 engines have been pulled from sale in 
the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/01/vw-suspends-4000-vehicles-sale-uk>
 as “a voluntary measure”.

This is less than reassuring. It is now two weeks since the company learned 
that it had been caught cheating by US regulators, and it probably knew the 
game was up several months before that.

The corporate confessions came promptly after public disgrace but energy was 
wasted in the few days attempting the impossible task of keeping chief 
executive Martin Winterkorn in his job.

It should have been an obvious first step to establish which new cars might 
still have the defeat devices and then yank them from forecourts. Volkswagen is 
not helping itself in its response to the crisis.

A Shire thing

As we await the $100bn (£66bn) bid for SAB Miller, let’s not overlook the 
other big takeover battle involving a FTSE 100 company.

On second thoughts, Shire’s $30bn attempt to buy Baxalta of the US, to create 
“the leading biotech company focused on rare diseases,” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/aug/04/shire-joins-biotech-bonanza-with-baxalta-bid>
 may be best forgotten. This one has been running since early August and Shire 
appears no nearer to bagging its prey.


The message in Baxalta’s share price is not encouraging – it’s back to where 
it stood beforeShire <https://www.theguardian.com/business/shire> proposed an 
all-share combination and decided to appeal directly to its target’s investors.

Flemming Ornskov, Shire’s chief executive, can keep pushing if he wishes but 
US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, by vowing to reduce the prices of 
specialist medicines, seems to have deflated this bid, as well as Shire’s share 
price.

Baxalta’s stock has suffered, too, so perhaps there is still hope in an 
all-share bid structure. But, after nine fruitless weeks, Ornskov’s best policy 
may be an orderly retreat.

At least Anheuser-Busch’s takeover attempt of SABMiller  
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/16/anheuser-busch-inbev-sets-sights-on-sabmiller>
will be conducted under British rules, which require a bidder to put up or shut 
up within a month. It’s a much better system.

How much?

Typical banker one-upmanship. Poor old Tony Hayward, chair of Glencore, 
cobbles together a few quid to buy 100,000 shares 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/sep/30/glencore-chairman-shares-governance>
in the embattled mining-cum-trading house, then boardroom colleague John Mack, 
former Morgan Stanley hard-man, dips into into his back pocket to snap up 
550,000. Just to rub it in, Hayward paid 90.9p a share but Mack got his at 
80.8p.
