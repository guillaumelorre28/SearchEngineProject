The winner


Despite a hefty fall of 66% from its opening frame, Fifty Shades of Grey led 
the field by a clear margin on its second weekend of release. After 10 days, it 
has grossed a spectacular £25.24m, overtakingThe Wolf of Wall Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/16/wolf-of-wall-street-review> 
(£22.70m lifetime) to be the biggest ever 18-certificate title at the UK box 
office.

Between 16-22 February, Fifty Shades earned £11.69m, indicating that audiences 
were still lining up to see it following a strong opening weekend when it 
earned £13.55m). In percentage terms, it suffered the biggest drop for a 
number-one title sinceThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/14/twilight-saga-breaking-dawn-part-2-review>
 fell an identical 66% in November 2012. That film ended up achieving a rather 
slim 2.26 times its opening weekend by the end of its run. Fifty Shades should 
show slightly stronger legs, but a similar rate of decay would deliver a 
cumulative total around £31m.

 Fifty Shades of Grey - video review 
In the UK, Fifty Shades is far ahead of the pace it’s achieving in the US. By 
industry rule of thumb, an equivalent UK result to the US box-office of $129m 
would be about £13m. In fact, it’s nearly double that figure, perhaps 
reflecting local enthusiasm for the source material and actorJamie Dornan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/02/jamie-dornan-the-fall-fifty-shades-of-grey>
, or just an exceptional release campaign by Universal UK.

The half-term surge

All the family films in the market enjoyed excellent business over the 
February half-term holiday. Disney’s Big Hero 6 rose 40% from the previous 
frame, and added £6.31m over the seven days. Aardman animation Shaun the Sheep 
the Movie rose 39%, and added £5.98m over the seven days. Totals for the films 
stand at £16.18m forBig Hero 6 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/big-hero-6> 
and £10.35m for Shaun.

 Shaun the Sheep the Movie - video review 
Now that kids are back at school, numbers for both these titles should drop, 
but Big Hero 6 is already past the lifetime total ofCars 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/21/cars-2-review> (£15.65m) and 
should push past £20m, matching the likes ofKung Fu Panda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jul/04/filmandmusic1.filmandmusic2> 
(£20.29m) andTangled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/27/tangled-review> (£20.47m).

Paddington rose 36% at the weekend – perhaps a last hurrah for a film that has 
been on release for three solid months, and arrives on DVD on March 23. 
Cumulative total is a sensational £36.95m.

Disney pushed Tinker Bell and the Legend of the Never Beast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/11/tinker-bell-and-the-legend-of-the-neverbeast-review>
 back into cinemas, nabbing 15th place in the chart with £127,000 – a 20-fold 
rise on the previous frame. Peppa Pig: The Golden Boots fell 27%, but 
nevertheless added a handy £504,000, and now stands at £2.02m. Given what can 
be assumed to be a modest production budget, this looks likean easy cash win 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/18/peppa-pig-brand-merchandising-1bn-wal-mart>
 for the rights holders, with rich ancillary to follow.

The middling new releases

In the second weekend of Fifty Shades’ release, UK distributors didn’t risk 
any of their major assets, but Sony went out with broad comedy The Wedding 
Ringer, and Paramount offered teen time-travel flick Project Almanac.The 
Wedding Ringer <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wedding-ringer>, starring 
Kevin Hart and Josh Gad (who voiced the snowman in Frozen) collected an OK 
£827,000 plus previews of £164,000. Project Almanac managed £495,000 plus 
previews of £373,000. Both landed mid-table in the chart.

Pinterest  
<http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKG5CnCgnplU&media=>
The result for The Wedding Ringer is good enough to confirm Kevin Hart as a 
marketable comedy star here in the UK (he has long been that in the US), 
although the gross is below the opening of last year’s Ride Along (£1.42m), 
co-starring Ice Cube.

The most apt comparison for Project Almanac is Chronicle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/02/chronicle-film-review>, given the 
teen characters, self-filmed conceit and genre storyline. Chronicle debuted in 
February 2012 with a much richer £1.58m plus previews of £617,000.

The disappointments

Despite a release on more than 100 screens, both Blackhat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/19/blackhat-review-michael-mann> and 
Cake <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/19/cake-review-jennifer-aniston>
 landed outside the top 10. Blackhat, a pricey thriller directed by Michael 
Mann, went out on a surprisingly tight 149-print release, presumably a result 
of the disappointing US performance (just $8m). An opening gross of £147,000 
delivered a weak screen average of £988. Given the narrow release, it’s 
reasonable to assume that marketing spend was reined in, the studio not wishing 
to throw good money after bad.

Jennifer Aniston drama Cake <https://www.theguardian.com/film/cake-film> did 
similarly badly, with £114,000 from 118 screens, an £969 average. However, with 
a much lower production spend, the result barely represents a fiscal blip for 
distributor Warners.

The arthouse alternative

Venues seeking an alternative to Fifty Shades – as well as to family films, 
mainstream new releases and the many middlebrow awards-bait films still in play 
– were offered one in the shape of Peter Strickland’s defiantly arthouseThe 
Duke of Burgundy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/19/the-duke-of-burgundy-review-peter-strickland>
. The stylish, narratively light, obscurely playful depiction of two lesbian 
entomologists debuted with a so-so £43,200 from 23 cinemas. The film did best 
in London, in venues such as Curzon Soho and Curzon Mayfair. The result is 
almost identical to the start of Strickland’s previous film,Berberian Sound 
Studio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/30/berberian-sound-studio-review>, 
which kicked off in August 2012 with £43,100 from 23 venues.

Beyond the Oscar <https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars-2015>-nominated 
films such asThe Theory of Everything 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/01/the-theory-of-everything-review-stephen-hawking-biopic-gravity>
,Selma

 andWhiplash <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/whiplash-review>, 
the top indie title in holdover play isLove Is Strange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/12/love-is-strange-review-john-lithgow-alfred-molina-gay-couple>
, which fell a slim 21%, for weekend takings of £55,000 from 38 venues, and a 
10-day total of £207,000.

The future

Thanks to Fifty Shades of Grey, the market is an acceptable 5% up on the 
equivalent weekend from 2014, when family filmsThe Lego Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/the-lego-movie-review> and Mr 
Peabody and Sherman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/06/mr-peabody-and-sherman-review>

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/18/the-second-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-slightly-reshuffled-replica>
 lands in cinemas, with a built-in audience from the earlier hit. Will Smith’s
