The second week of ABT's season sees the UK premiere of its production of Le 
Corsaire. This promises to be a different beast from the version recently 
danced by the Bolshoi, which was the result of diligent research into the 
original plot detail and choreographic structure of Petipa's 1899 ballet. This 
one is based on the cheerfully unreconstructed Soviet staging, with its 
ebulliently tweaked storyline and substantive, beefed-up dance numbers. It 
retains the essential scenario of Conrad, his swaggering pirate friends and 
lively girlfriend Medora, but does so in the virtuosic bright colours of a 
cartoon. As a result, it promises lots of family-oriented pleasure as well as 
extended showcases for the company's principal dancers, who include in this 
week's run Gillian Murphy, Paloma Herrera, Angel Corella Herman Cornejo and 
Ethan Stiefel.
