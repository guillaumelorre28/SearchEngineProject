Channel 4 Paralympics Coverage: ‘We’re the Superhumans’ (starts at 00:04) - UK

Channel 4’s coverage of the 2012 Paralympic Games was a turning point for the 
broadcaster. Within its immensely positive and inclusive coverage of the 
events, the station rediscovered its purpose and it was all kicked off byan 
amazing piece of marketing <https://vimeo.com/46732057>. Not surprisingly, 
Channel 4 has gone for more of the same to promote its Rio coverage ... and, 
once again, they’ve put together a fantastic piece of communication.

Samsung Galaxy: ‘Snail’ (starts at 03:01) - US

Samsung return to their partnership with the World Surf League in this 
gripping commercial. You’ll look at molluscs on the pavement in a whole new 
light after watching a snail trying to conquer its own horizontal Everest: by 
crossing the road in one piece.

Old Spice: ‘Stand-Off’ (starts at 04:27) - US

Old Spice present another helping of madness packed into an aerosol container 
as a Wild West desperado looks set to meet his maker at the hands of the local 
tyrant. Being a connoisseur of a certain male grooming brand, however, the 
shackled protagonist is fully intent on walking into the sunset. Bonkers.

Under Armour: ‘Numbers’ (starts at 05:01) - US

Baseball star Bryce Harper’s numbers are put under the spotlight in this 
arresting film for sportswear giant Under Armour. The stats don’t lie in a 
mesmerising sequence put together by director Aoife McArdle and editor Dan 
Sherwen but – as this advert beautifully demonstrates – it’s something more 
ethereal which ultimately determines greatness.
