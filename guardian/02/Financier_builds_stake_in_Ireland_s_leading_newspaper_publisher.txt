An Irish Times headline this morning raised my eyebrows, Desmond builds up INM 
stake of over 2% 
<http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/0507/1224296378329.html>.

But Richard Desmond, the owner of Express Newspapers has not been buying 
shares inIndependent News & Media, the Dublin-based media company run by Gavin 
O'Reilly. 

The story refers instead to Dermot Desmond, the businessman and financier 
reputed to be Ireland's sixth-wealthiest person (according to a rich list
compiled by one of INM's major titles, theSunday Independent 
<http://www.independent.ie/business/rich-list/irelands-rich-list-110-2116314.html>
).

It appears that D Desmond has "quietly built up a stake of more than 2%", 
which means he holds more than 11m shares and is therefore one of the company's 
biggest shareholders.

INM's leading shareholders are Denis O'Brien with 21.6% and Tony O'Reilly, the 
company's founder, with 14.7%. And international asset managers, such as 
Investec, Marathon and Pioneer, have stakes above 3%.

The Irish Times report says: "It is not clear why Mr Desmond would choose to 
build a stake in INM at this time.

"Market sources suggested he could see it as a value play, or he might be 
trying to position himself strategically in the event INM becomes a takeover 
target."

There have been signs of renewed boardroom unrest recently. O'Brien's three 
nominated directors have indicated that they intend to vote against the receipt 
and adoption of the directors' report and the financial statements at the 
annual meeting on 3 June.

This will raise questions again about the relationship between O'Brien and the 
O'Reilly family, which was fractious before a 2009 detente.

One result of their dispute was the selling off, for a nominal sum, of the 
company's British national title,The Independent

, toAlexander Lebedev in March last year.
