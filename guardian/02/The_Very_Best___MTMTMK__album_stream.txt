It's been three years since we fell in love with  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/sep/06/very-best-warm-heart-africa>the 
Very Best 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/7b29dcf8-ef5f-4656-a3ba-07d9b4c343d3>'s 
debut album Warm Heart of Africa – a collaboration between Radioclit and 
Malawian singer Esau Mwamwaya that refused to be pigeonholed. The good news for 
those not fond of either pigeons or holes is that MTMTMK continues the band's 
bright, genre-skipping pop, providing a shiny electronic backdrop to the sweet 
African harmonies.

Featuring Amadou and Mariam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/amadou-and-mariam>, Baaba Maal and K'naan – 
not to mention a co-write with Bruno Mars on We OK – the album was recorded in 
five weeks in Mwamwaya's hometown of Lilongwe. The result is as refreshing as 
Warm Heart of Africa, but even more euphoric. We love it – let us know your 
thoughts in the comment section below.

You can read an interview with the band in the Guide on Saturday.
