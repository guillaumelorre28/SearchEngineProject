Chrome <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chrome/id535886823?mt=8>

Google sprang a surprise in its second-day I/O conference keynote by revealing 
a version of its Chrome browser for iOS, and then releasing it the same night. 
As with all third-party iOS browsers, it has to use Apple's Safari's core, but 
the key feature here is the ability to sync open tabs, bookmarks, passwords and 
other data withChrome <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chrome> on the 
desktop.

NaturalMotion's CSR Racing was the only game to be played on-stage at Apple's 
WWDC keynote earlier in June. Now it's out: a freemium drag-racing game 
starring a host of cars, eye-popping graphics and lots of customisation.
iPhone / iPad

<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.revolution.bs1dc>

Here's a treat for adventure-game fans who own Android

IMAG-N-O-TRON: 'The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore' Edition 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/imag-n-o-tron-fantastic-flying/id534396897?mt=8>

US firm Moonbot Studios had a big iOS hit with book-app The Fantastic Flying 
Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, then bagged an Oscar for its animated short. Now 
the company has launched an augmented reality app to be used with the physical 
book: "Simply point the IMAG•N•O•TRON at it and watch the pages come to life. 
Get swept up in a storm! Transport to another world! Play music! Fly!!! It's a 
wonder of the ages!"
iPhone / iPad

Sidecastr for iPad <http://itunes.apple.com/app/sidecastr-for-ipad/id532233516>

Just ahead of Zeebox's debut in the US, it has a new second-screen social TV 
app rival: Sidecastr. The app pulls in and organises tweets around specific 
shows, but more importantly shows them in sync with an episode. Say you're 
watching a recorded episode of Breaking Bad a day after it aired – Sidecastr 
will show you what people were saying at the time.
iPad

Broadgate Stories 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/broadgate-stories/id531124982?mt=8>

Wander around London's Broadgate zone near Liverpool Street station, and 
you'll overhear a few stories – many of them from tipsy City-boys gabbling 
about bonuses. The Broadgate Stories app thankfully looks beyond that: an audio 
guide to the art and architecture of Broadgate, collected and produced by young 
people in Hackney.
iPhone

Dead Trigger <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dead-trigger/id533079551?mt=8>

Grr! Dead Trigger is a zombified first-person shooter so frightening, it's 
capitalised as DEAD TRIGGER on the App Store. The plot is familiar: collapsed 
civilisation, strange virus, zombies all over the shop. Your job is to shoot 
them, while rescuing other humans and securing supplies. It looks beautiful. 
Well, beautiful in a guts-flying way.
iPhone / iPad

Final Fantasy III 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFIII_GP>

Square Enix is certainly brave, charging £10.99 for the Android version of 
Final Fantasy III – an RPG first released in 1990. The game has been updated 
for the smartphone era with touchscreen controls and exclusive "story 
sequences".
Android

The Amazing Spider-Man 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftAMHM>

A few hours after The Amazing Spider-Man was in yesterday's Apps 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apps> Rush (29 June) for iOS, it was 
also released on Android. The game is the same: 3D web-slinging action across 
New York, based on the new Spider-Man movie.
Android

Ninja Ranch <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ninja-ranch!/id520105806?mt=8>

We've had Mafia Farm, so Ninja Ranch is a logical next step, perhaps. Not that 
this is a farming game: instead, it's a puzzler that sees your ninja swiping 
animals into groups: a match-three puzzle game that swaps gems for, er, farting 
cows. And ninjas, obviously.
iPhone / iPad

Seeker <http://www.seeker.info/uk/>

Seeker describes itself as a business and residential directory service, and 
has just launched in the UK. It aims to help people find businesses while out 
and about, with additional info on Borisbike hire in London, and the Olympic 
Games.
