NHS Supply Chain is leading a procurement on behalf of various authorities for 
picture archiving and communications systems (Pacs) and radiology information 
systems (RIS), including hardware and software.

The four year framework agreement, worth between £171m and £363m, will also 
include additional lots for x-ray workstations and a storage system including 
related hardware, software and managed services. The workstations will be used 
for viewing and manipulating images stored in the Pacs system, according to a 
notice in the Official Journal of the European Union

Where hardware and software options are procured through the framework, the 
provision of associated professional services may be included, according to the 
notice. Suppliers chosen for certain lots may also be expected to provide a 
managed service.
