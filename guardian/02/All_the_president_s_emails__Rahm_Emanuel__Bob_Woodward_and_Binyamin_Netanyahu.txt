Subject: Re: Woodward's [expletive deleted] book

 You know what? In a way I'm glad the world now knows what I have to work 
with: some of the most insecure, spiteful, back-stabbing whiners ever to be 
charged with safeguarding our national defence. Honestly, it's like Gossip Girl 
in uniform. Yes, the book will probably make things worse for us in the midterm 
elections, but if it stops one child from wanting to grow up and become 
president of the Untied States, it will have been worth it. Sorry, bad day. B

 Well done, Bob, for leaking the book in such a publicity-friendly manner. I 
wish you all success. Just one thing: in future, when I preface a remark by 
saying "OTR", that stands for "off the record". Pretty common shorthand round 
here. I realise the same letters could also stand for "on the record", so I 
guess it's my fault for being naive. Under the circumstances, I should probably 
thank you for not telling the world I wear Spider-Man pajamas. That's still 
very much OTR (off the record), BTW (by the way). Barack

Re: UN speech

 Hey, Bibi. I just thought I'd send you a link to my UN speech the other day. 
I noticed none of your people were there – some sort of holiday or something, 
wasn't it? Anyway, you might find it interesting –tinyurl.com/39msnjm

for lasting peace, instead of MORE SETTLEMENTS. Check it out. BHO

 I don't know even who Serena is. I've never seen Gossip Girl. I was just 
saying that these generals are all like . . . Oh God, I'm too tired to finish 
this. Hold my calls. B
