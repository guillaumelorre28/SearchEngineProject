The winner

While this summer’s box-office doldrums have been partly blamed on a relative 
lack of big family titles, the scarcity has certainly been good news for Laika’s
The Boxtrolls <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-boxtrolls>, which retains 
the UK crown for a second week, thanks to a week-on-week rise of 2%. After 12 
days of play, the stop-frame animation has grossed a handy £3.62m. Laika’s 
previous effort, ParaNorman, stood at a slightly softer £2.95m at the same 
stage of its run, while 2009’s Coraline had reached a sturdier £4.21m at this 
point.

Thanks to some surprisingly hostile reviews from the international trade 
press, The Boxtrolls’ Metacritic score currently stands at a lowly 51/100. The 
Rotten Tomatoes rating of 71% fresh includes positive reviews from the 
Observer, Guardian, Telegraph, Financial Times, Radio Times and Little White 
Lies, none of which were surveyed by Metacritic.

 Monster hit … Laika’s The Boxtrolls has topped the UK box-office chart for the 
second week in a row. Photograph: PR 
The Boxtrolls sits atop one of the charts showing the least disparity – in 
terms of weekend box-office takings – we’ve seen for a while. Its £1.33m 
weekend gross is only 4.35 times the tally for 10th-placedBefore I Go to Sleep 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/before-i-go-to-sleep>. As recently as early 
August, we witnessed a box-office chart with the top film (The Inbetweeners 2) 
delivering weekend takings that were 72 times those for the title in 10th place.

The runner-up

Landing just below The Boxtrolls with £1.32m, A Walk Among the Tombstones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-walk-among-the-tombstones> extends the 
proposition for Liam Neeson as a dynamic man of action. The 1999-set crime 
thriller, based on the Laurence Block novel series, performed less well than 
recent Neeson actioner Non-Stop (debut of £2.65m), although that Joel Silver 
production benefited from a higher concept and a more mainstream positioning. 
Another comparison might be the grittier The Grey, which kicked off with £1.09m 
in January 2012.

After Pride <https://www.theguardian.com/film/pride> triumphantly premiered at 
the close of the Cannes Directors Fortnight in May, UK box-office expectations 
were at a height. But it was always hard to predict how audiences would respond 
to a historical film about gay political activism and trade unionism. In the 
event, a UK opening of £657,000 plus previews of £62,000 proved a sobering 
riposte to earlier giddy speculation. So distributor Pathe will be more than 
happy with a drop of just 12% for the second weekend of play, as it will 
likewise be with a strong weekday performance last week and a 10-day tally of 
£1.86m. After a somewhat shaky start, Matthew Warchus’ film is displaying signs 
of solid traction with audiences. The challenge will be to keep the film in 
cinemas and sustain the buzz.

With its evident allusions to Oxford University’s Bullingdon Club, The Riot 
Club, based on Laura Wade’s play Posh, certainly benefits from rich media 
currency. But converting all that attention into ticket sales was always going 
to be a challenge, since audiences tend to prefer relatable or even sympathetic 
protagonists, whereasThe Riot Club 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-riot-club> offers drunk young aristocrats 
engaging in an orgy of destruction and abuse. A package of marketable elements 
– the buzzy source material, director Lone Scherfig (An Education) and a 
photogenic young cast (including Max Irons, Sam Claflin and Douglas Booth) – 
helped the film to a so-so £497,000 debut from 378 cinemas. The film shares two 
principal cast members – Ben Schnetzer, Freddie Fox – with Pride, and observers 
will be playing close attention to how audiences respond to the two Brit flicks 
as the theatrical runs progress.

Picturehouse’s distribution arm will be plenty happy that its latest release, 
Nick Cave documentary20,000 Days on Earth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/20-000-days-on-earth>, managed £72,000 from 
32 screens at the weekend, delivering a solid site average of £2,252. But more 
notable is the film’s confirmation of the potency of live-event cinema. The 
picture played two days before release together with a live Cave performance at 
the Barbican in London, an event carried by 142 cinemas nationwide. Takings 
from this live-satellite event, together with an open-air preview last month at 
London’s Somerset House, kick in an extra £284,000, bringing the overall total 
to £356,000.

The flop

Landing in lowly 14th place, with £187,000, The Giver suggests that the market 
has already been amply served with young-adult literary adaptations set in 
dystopian futures, or at least is being picky about which ones it embraces. 
Lois Lowry’s 1993 novel perhaps didn’t have the currency of other recent 
adaptations, and cinemas certainly hope to do a lot better next month with The 
Maze Runner, already a significant hit in the US and other territories. The 
Giver opened in the US last month with $12.3m (£7.5m), suggesting a UK debut of 
around £1.2m, far ahead of the actual achieved result.

Also landing outside the top 10, albeit with a much better screen average, is 
Woody Allen’s Magic in the Moonlight. A debut of £274,000 from 178 cinemas 
compares with £834,000 (including £41,000 in previews) from 188 venues for Blue 
Jasmine last autumn. Magic is, however, well up on 2012’s To Rome With Love, 
which began its run with £141,000 from 107 venues.

Thanks to the paucity of commercially potent new titles, weekend box-office 
adds up to the sixth worst frame of the past year. However, this is par for the 
course for September, and takings are only 3% down on the equivalent session 
from 2013, when Rush topped the chart and Diana was the top new title. Cinema 
owners will be hoping that Denzel Washington can deliver some much-needed fresh 
muscle this week with The Equalizer. Britcom What We Did on Our Holiday comes 
from the makers of TV’s Outnumbered. David Cronenberg’s Cannes competitor Maps 
to the Stars offers an upscale alternative.
