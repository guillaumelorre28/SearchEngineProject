See you in a couple of hours

Now it’s early I know but I’m not nearly finished for the day, even though I’m 
folding this edition of Politics Live for now. I need to duck off for a bit and 
record one segment for this week’s campaign podcast, and then come back for 
another burst of live coverage this evening.

I will be covering the Labor leader Bill Shorten, live and solo at the 
people’s forum in Brisbane, and I’ll also cover the prime ministerMalcolm 
Turnbull’s interview on the 730 Report this evening. I’ll be back in the live 
chair from about 6.30pm. I hope you’ll join me.

Let’s wrap the day.

 * Today, Labor stopped circling around the economy and budget management, and 
engaged directly, setting some parameters about a return to budget balance. 
Labor admitted their numbers would be worse than the government’s over the 
forward estimates, but better than the government’s over the ten year cycle, 
courtesy of structural savings, like curbing negative gearing concessions. We 
still haven’t seen the numbers of course, and likely won’t for another couple 
of weeks. It’s a significant political gamble by Labor: will voters look at the 
four year position or the ten year position?

 * The Coalition argued voters should look at the four year position (because 
that is what is required under the charter of budget of honesty and because ten 
year positions are inherently unreliable) – perhaps forgetting their own 
election centrepiece is a ten year plan to cut taxes for business, boosting 
growth and jobs, notwithstanding recent rebadging.Malcolm Turnbull and Scott 
Morrison warned that Labor’s stance over the forward estimates would threaten 
Australia’s AAA credit rating, and Labor had no plans for growth, only plans to 
thump the economy with taxes on investment.

That’s been the day. The evening beckons. See you then.

I don’t entirely understand all the interpretations in this story but it’s 
interesting. Fairfax isreporting this afternoon 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/election-2016-mps-directing-taxpayer-funds-towards-liberal-partylinked-company-and-donor-20160608-gpe87q.html#ixzz4Axfjv2li>
 that Liberal MPs are using their taxpayer-funded office allowances to pay a 
company, Parakeelia Pty Ltd, $2500 a year to use “Feedback” software. This is a 
data mining operation basically. Intriguing.

Also the environment minister Greg Hunt is hitting back (not quite the right 
characterisation I know) at the US talk hostEllen Degeneres, who has been 
campaigning to save the Great Barrier Reef.

On the floods, the early advice from the prime minister’s office is both 
leaders are likely to be in Tasmania tomorrow, provided conditions on the 
ground are amenable to that, but they may not appear together. There may be 
separate programs.

But in any case, it looks like both the campaigns will head south tomorrow.

Labor folks are also telling me this afternoon that Bill Shorten plans to 
travel to flooded areas in Tasmania tomorrow. He’s apparently approached the 
prime minister with a view to making it a joint visit. I’ll check withMalcolm 
Turnbull’sfolks to see what they are saying.

Now we are on the other side of the National Press Club an update on 
preferences. Greens MP for Melbourne,Adam Bandt, has confirmed his party will 
give Labor its second preference in five inner city seats. The seats affected 
are: Batman and Wills, both Labor seats targeted by the Greens; Melbourne 
Ports, held by Labor’sMichael Danby; Higgins, held by Kelly O’Dwyer for the 
Liberals and targeted by the Greens; and Bandt’s seat of Melbourne. However, 
the big unanswered question is whether the Greens will preference Labor or run 
open tickets in other marginal Liberal seats.There have been reports that the 
Greens may run open tickets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/10/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-coalition-greens-labor-catchup>
 in Liberal suburban marginals in return for Liberal preferences in the inner 
city. Expect more details of preference deals by all parties to ooze out over 
the weekend, as nominations close Thursday and parties lock down how-to-vote 
cards before pre-poll opens on Tuesday.

Into closing statements now.

Mathias Cormann looks well pleased with his hour, he says it’s been a good 
discussion, and the results are Labor hasn’t answered key questions and we are 
superior budget managers so vote one Coalition, July 2.

Tony Burke says he’s not sure if the debate ever climbed out of the talking 
points.

Moments of the debate have been like an argument with Siri.

Eighth question is on spending growth. The Coalition has increased spending 
growth since coming to office, how does it account for that record, and will 
Labor send a signal on the spending cuts stuck in the Senate? Will Labor back 
some of those cuts?

Mathias Cormann says the government has worked to constrain the growth in 
expenditures – and whatever you think of the Coalition’s record, it is always 
better than Labor’s.

Tony Burke says of the zombie measures, the government is only interested in 
binary arguments. It’s not either/or. You can come up with alternative savings 
measures, in other words. He says it’s a long campaign. Don’t leave town. (Well

Mathias Cormann says the government is confident it has the policies to combat 
avoidance by multinationals.

Tony Burke says the Coalition was slow to act on avoidance. Now, he says, some 
of the assumptions don’tpass the laugh test. Burke says companies aren’t going 
to pay more tax because the rate is reduced to 25%.

Sixth question is the fragility of the forecasts and the limits of ten year 
plans. Cormann is asked why the Coalition has put a ten year business tax cut 
on the credit card in the current climate, and Burke is asked why he’s ruling 
out spending cuts post election given the current budgetary climate.

Mathias Cormann says the company tax cut is funded. He says Labor isn’t 
supporting it for political reasons, not economic reasons.

Tony Burke says by year ten, the cost is escalating to “a $13bn hit to the 
budget in a single year.” You don’t get tax cuts for free, Burke says, and you 
can’t do what the Coalition is proposing on company taxes without a massive hit 
to the budget. On spending, Burke says Labor is confident about its structural 
savings, confident that they will do the job.

Fourth question is on the super guarantee. What are your plans?

Mathias Cormann goes through the purpose of super. He says Labor’s plans to 
increase the guarantee to 12% weren’t funded, so the Coalition delayed the 
proposed ramp-up by six years. The government remains committed to that 
timetable, Cormann says.

Tony Burke says super is one of the great Labor reforms. Further announcements 
on the guarantee are coming, he says. Burke says whatever Labor does on this 
will be affordable.

Fifth question is on return to balance. How can Labor or the government claim 
a return to balance in five years if the budget numbers are dodgy? Do you 
reserve the right to delay the path back to surplus?

Tony Burke says he hopes the budget assumptions are right, but if they are 
wrong, it’s a much bigger problem for the government than it is for Labor, 
because of the impact of structural savings over the medium term. He says Labor 
has promised a mini-budget if it wins.

Mathias Cormann says the budget forecasts are the best available data. He says 
the government has full confidence in the forecasts. If forecasts don’t 
translate to lived reality that’s often because there are external factors 
outside the control of Australia.

The two men are tangling now about spending growth. Trajectories at 20 paces.

Second question is on the merit of 10-year plans. Both sides have them but 
suggest the other side shouldn’t have one. What gives?

Mathias Cormann says the test in the charter of budget honesty is the forward 
estimates, not 10 years. Thus far there’s lots of rhetoric and not a lot of 
substance about numbers over the four years, he says.

Tony Burke says if 10 years is off the table then we can never have a serious 
discussion about long-term budget repair. Take Labor’s negative gearing policy. 
It doesn’t yield much over the forwards because people’s investments are 
grandfathered. But over time, there is heavy lifting, Burke says.

Third question is spending cuts. What assurance can you give the voters that 
you won’t spring spending cuts on them after the election, like happened in the 
2014 budget?

Tony Burke says Labor has given “the hard message first.” It has been upfront 
about revenue measures.

Mathias Cormann says Labor has not laid out how it will improve the budget 
bottom line, not with any specifics. And tax increases hamper economic growth. 
How much lower will economic growth be under Labor?

Now it’s early I know but I’m not nearly finished for the day, even though I’m 
folding this edition of Politics Live for now. I need to duck off for a bit and 
record one segment for this week’s campaign podcast, and then come back for 
another burst of live coverage this evening.

I will be covering the Labor leader Bill Shorten, live and solo at the 
people’s forum in Brisbane, and I’ll also cover the prime ministerMalcolm 
Turnbull’s interview on the 730 Report this evening. I’ll be back in the live 
chair from about 6.30pm. I hope you’ll join me.

Let’s wrap the day.

 * Today, Labor stopped circling around the economy and budget management, and 
engaged directly, setting some parameters about a return to budget balance. 
Labor admitted their numbers would be worse than the government’s over the 
forward estimates, but better than the government’s over the ten year cycle, 
courtesy of structural savings, like curbing negative gearing concessions. We 
still haven’t seen the numbers of course, and likely won’t for another couple 
of weeks. It’s a significant political gamble by Labor: will voters look at the 
four year position or the ten year position?

 * The Coalition argued voters should look at the four year position (because 
that is what is required under the charter of budget of honesty and because ten 
year positions are inherently unreliable) – perhaps forgetting their own 
election centrepiece is a ten year plan to cut taxes for business, boosting 
growth and jobs, notwithstanding recent rebadging.Malcolm Turnbull and Scott 
Morrison warned that Labor’s stance over the forward estimates would threaten 
Australia’s AAA credit rating, and Labor had no plans for growth, only plans to 
thump the economy with taxes on investment.

That’s been the day. The evening beckons. See you then.
 
I don’t entirely understand all the interpretations in this story but it’s 
interesting. Fairfax isreporting this afternoon 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/election-2016-mps-directing-taxpayer-funds-towards-liberal-partylinked-company-and-donor-20160608-gpe87q.html#ixzz4Axfjv2li>
 that Liberal MPs are using their taxpayer-funded office allowances to pay a 
company, Parakeelia Pty Ltd, $2500 a year to use “Feedback” software. This is a 
data mining operation basically. Intriguing.

Also the environment minister Greg Hunt is hitting back (not quite the right 
characterisation I know) at the US talk hostEllen Degeneres, who has been 
campaigning to save the Great Barrier Reef.

On the floods, the early advice from the prime minister’s office is both 
leaders are likely to be in Tasmania tomorrow, provided conditions on the 
ground are amenable to that, but they may not appear together. There may be 
separate programs.

But in any case, it looks like both the campaigns will head south tomorrow.
 
Labor folks are also telling me this afternoon that Bill Shorten plans to 
travel to flooded areas in Tasmania tomorrow. He’s apparently approached the 
prime minister with a view to making it a joint visit. I’ll check withMalcolm 
Turnbull’sfolks to see what they are saying.

Catching up again, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has been meeting 
apprentices in Brisbane ahead of his people’s forum outing later this evening.

Now we are on the other side of the National Press Club an update on 
preferences. Greens MP for Melbourne,Adam Bandt, has confirmed his party will 
give Labor its second preference in five inner city seats. The seats affected 
are: Batman and Wills, both Labor seats targeted by the Greens; Melbourne 
Ports, held by Labor’sMichael Danby; Higgins, held by Kelly O’Dwyer for the 
Liberals and targeted by the Greens; and Bandt’s seat of Melbourne. However, 
the big unanswered question is whether the Greens will preference Labor or run 
open tickets in other marginal Liberal seats.There have been reports that the 
Greens may run open tickets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/10/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-coalition-greens-labor-catchup>
 in Liberal suburban marginals in return for Liberal preferences in the inner 
city. Expect more details of preference deals by all parties to ooze out over 
the weekend, as nominations close Thursday and parties lock down how-to-vote 
cards before pre-poll opens on Tuesday.

 
Into closing statements now.

Mathias Cormann looks well pleased with his hour, he says it’s been a good 
discussion, and the results are Labor hasn’t answered key questions and we are 
superior budget managers so vote one Coalition, July 2.

Tony Burke says he’s not sure if the debate ever climbed out of the talking 
points.

Moments of the debate have been like an argument with Siri.

Club in Canberra, Wednesday, June 8, 2016. Photograph: Stefan Postles/AAP  
Eighth question is on spending growth. The Coalition has increased spending 
growth since coming to office, how does it account for that record, and will 
Labor send a signal on the spending cuts stuck in the Senate? Will Labor back 
some of those cuts?

Mathias Cormann says the government has worked to constrain the growth in 
expenditures – and whatever you think of the Coalition’s record, it is always 
better than Labor’s.

Tony Burke says of the zombie measures, the government is only interested in 
binary arguments. It’s not either/or. You can come up with alternative savings 
measures, in other words. He says it’s a long campaign. Don’t leave town. (Well 
that last bit was me, not Burke.)
 
Mathias Cormann says the government is confident it has the policies to combat 
avoidance by multinationals.

Tony Burke says the Coalition was slow to act on avoidance. Now, he says, some 
of the assumptions don’tpass the laugh test. Burke says companies aren’t going 
to pay more tax because the rate is reduced to 25%.
 
Seventh question is on avoidance.

Mathias Cormann:

The Coalition gets tax avoidance.

Tony Burke:

That’s certainly true.
 
Sixth question is the fragility of the forecasts and the limits of ten year 
plans. Cormann is asked why the Coalition has put a ten year business tax cut 
on the credit card in the current climate, and Burke is asked why he’s ruling 
out spending cuts post election given the current budgetary climate.

Mathias Cormann says the company tax cut is funded. He says Labor isn’t 
supporting it for political reasons, not economic reasons.

Tony Burke says by year ten, the cost is escalating to “a $13bn hit to the 
budget in a single year.” You don’t get tax cuts for free, Burke says, and you 
can’t do what the Coalition is proposing on company taxes without a massive hit 
to the budget. On spending, Burke says Labor is confident about its structural 
savings, confident that they will do the job.
 
Tony Burke is blasting trickle down economics.

Mathias Cormann:

It used to be your policy.

Burke ploughs on. He says the government has taken to announcing Labor policy.

Mathias Cormann:

I’m better at it than you.
 
Fourth question is on the super guarantee. What are your plans?

Mathias Cormann goes through the purpose of super. He says Labor’s plans to 
increase the guarantee to 12% weren’t funded, so the Coalition delayed the 
proposed ramp-up by six years. The government remains committed to that 
timetable, Cormann says.

Tony Burke says super is one of the great Labor reforms. Further announcements 
on the guarantee are coming, he says. Burke says whatever Labor does on this 
will be affordable.

Fifth question is on return to balance. How can Labor or the government claim 
a return to balance in five years if the budget numbers are dodgy? Do you 
reserve the right to delay the path back to surplus?

Tony Burke says he hopes the budget assumptions are right, but if they are 
wrong, it’s a much bigger problem for the government than it is for Labor, 
because of the impact of structural savings over the medium term. He says Labor 
has promised a mini-budget if it wins.

Mathias Cormann says the budget forecasts are the best available data. He says 
the government has full confidence in the forecasts. If forecasts don’t 
translate to lived reality that’s often because there are external factors 
outside the control of Australia.

The two men are tangling now about spending growth. Trajectories at 20 paces.
 
Second question is on the merit of 10-year plans. Both sides have them but 
suggest the other side shouldn’t have one. What gives?

Mathias Cormann says the test in the charter of budget honesty is the forward 
estimates, not 10 years. Thus far there’s lots of rhetoric and not a lot of 
substance about numbers over the four years, he says.

Tony Burke says if 10 years is off the table then we can never have a serious 
discussion about long-term budget repair. Take Labor’s negative gearing policy. 
It doesn’t yield much over the forwards because people’s investments are 
grandfathered. But over time, there is heavy lifting, Burke says.

Third question is spending cuts. What assurance can you give the voters that 
you won’t spring spending cuts on them after the election, like happened in the 
2014 budget?

Tony Burke says Labor has given “the hard message first.” It has been upfront 
about revenue measures.

Mathias Cormann says Labor has not laid out how it will improve the budget 
bottom line, not with any specifics. And tax increases hamper economic growth. 
How much lower will economic growth be under Labor?
