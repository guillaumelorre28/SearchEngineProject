Ian McEwan states that “the possession of a penis or, more fundamentally, the 
inheritance of the XY chromosome [sic], is inalienably connected to maleness”. 
His statement is not, as he claims, “biologically unexceptional” (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/06/penis-comment-was-biologically-unexceptional>
, 7 April). For instance, the sex-determining region (SRY gene) of the Y 
chromosome may be transferred to an X chromosome, resulting in an XX normal 
male, or it may undergo mutation making it non-functional, resulting in an XY 
female. Other genetic conditions such as androgen insensitivity syndrome and 
5-alpha reductase deficiency result in a mismatch between XY genotype and 
biological structure, or in biological ambiguity. Although the determinants of 
psychosexual gender identity are probably complex, it is clear that a 
testosterone surge that occurs in males during late foetal and early postnatal 
life has significant effects on regions of the brain that are strongly 
correlated with gender identity. Because testosterone levels affect the brain 
when gender of the body is already fixed, the two are not unexceptionally 
correlated.
