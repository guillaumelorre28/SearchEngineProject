Myth world 

The Judgement Of Paris, where mortal Paris gets to decide whether a nude Hera, 
Aphrodite or Athena is best looking, doesn’t sound like obvious feminist fare. 
Yet, in this take on the myth, Paris kneels small and demure; the women rule.

Hair and now

Instead of the interchangeable eye-candy of old masters, their faces are 
characterful, their bodies individualised. Somewhat radically, they are shown 
with pubic hair.

Paranormal activity

This predates the surrealism that would transform Colquhoun’s work in the 
1930s. She is perhaps best known as an occultist, a passion that led to her 
expulsion from the British surrealist group.

Cut and paste

That did nothing to dispel her interest in surrealist techniques, however, 
which she wrote about in texts with fabulous titles such as Children Of The 
Mantic Stain.
