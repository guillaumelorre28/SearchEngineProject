 I think what balances me out more than anything is long walks and eating well. 
I like a bit of yoga, too - I've just started to get back into it after a hip 
operation. I do it once every few weeks; it's just a case of finding the time. 
I am quite good, though, in the mornings - I do ankle curls and stretch. It 
makes one 'regular' first thing.
I used to take vitamins, but I think diet is the most important thing. If you 
have a good diet, there's no need for that stuff. I like my wine and 
occasionally go to the pub for a few beers, but I don't go mad. I think 
everyone knows that I'm the type of person who can have a good time without 
drinking.

People who drop litter really stress me out. I have been known to chase after 
people and say, 'Sorry, but you've forgotten something', and then hand it back 
to them.
