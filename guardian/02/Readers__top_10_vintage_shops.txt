1. Cinedoc, Paris

For lovers of vintage film posters and stills going back to the early days of 
cinema, Cinedoc is the place to head. Drawers of amazing French posters vie for 
attention with scene stills and photographs of the stars. The shop is crammed 
from floor to ceiling - a treasure trove. Cinedoc is in the Passage Jouffroy, a 
wonderful almost secret network of covered glazed shopping arcades dating from 
the 19th century. Each of the 30 passages has its own architectural style - 
some, like the Galerie Vero-Dodat, are very grand with black marble columns and 
painted shopfronts. Others, such as the Passage des Panoramas, are a little run 
down but contain delightful bric-a-brac shops and stamp dealers. The Passages 
of Paris are hidden gems well worth discovering away from the traffic clogged 
boulevards.

2. Jutka & Riska, Antwerp

A vintage shop I adore! They sell high-end brands such as YSL and Dior but 
also normal vintage stuff. Lots of accessories (sunglasses, bags, boots, belts) 
and their own unique line called Jutka & Riska. I saw some other young 
designers' stuff as well.

3. Lunettes Brillenagentur, Berlin

When you are in Berlin, make sure to stop by Uta Geyer's vintage eyewear shop 
Lunettes. She has the most amazing range of never-worn designer vintage 
eyewear. She stocks it all: from extreme 80s retro nerdy specs, original 
Ray-Ban Wayfarers to classic 60s Dior sunglasses. The customer service is 
spot-on and Uta and her girls know exactly which fashion trend suits you best.

An east London-based vintage shop, just off fashionable Brick Lane, with a

musical instruments among other weird and wonderful things.

5. Milgi & Northcote Lane Market, Cardiff

A monthly market (held every first Sunday) either inside or outside the Milgi 
bar on City Road (an eclectric bar/bistro with video art, squashy sofas, 
chandeliers and a good line in cocktails and homemade pop).
It's a bit of a hotchpotch of jumble, young designers, live music, DJs, the 
odd random performance artist and sometimes a BBQ. It's really great for 
hand-printed T-shirts and pumps, jewellery, second-hand books, vinyl, 
vintage-rummaging, people-watching, cake-eating, cocktail-drinking. And 
sometimes it happens at night too, which can be very, very good.

Los Angeles is great for vintage/retro clothing, and these two stores, right 
across the road from each other in Venice Beach, are definitely worth a visit.

has more dresses, vintage knitwear and accessories.

7. Laura Dols, Amsterdam

If you like vintage clothes and accessories, you'll love Amsterdam. One of the 
best places to go for second-hand bits and pieces is Laura Dols. It's a no-go 
area for men, but women will love this shop. You'll enjoy browsing the dresses 
and skirts they sell here. From the Thirties all the way up to the Eighties: if 
Marilyn Monroe were still alive, she would be shopping here.

8. Beyond Retro, Stockholm

In its stock and atmosphere this vintage clothing store typifies the 
'bohemian" nature of the surrounding area of this part of Sodermalm with its 
cafes, restaurants, bars, shops and green spaces where artists, writers and 
students hang out. There are also free gigs on Sunday afternoons.
