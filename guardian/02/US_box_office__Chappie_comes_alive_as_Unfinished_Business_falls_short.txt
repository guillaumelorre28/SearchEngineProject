Offbeat science-fiction action movie Chappie came in at No 1 with a relatively 
weak opening of $13.3m (£8.8m) on a disappointing weekend at the North American 
box office 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-chappie-no-1-779768>.

The Johannesburg-set dystopian tale, from District 9 and Elysium director 
Neill Blomkamp <https://www.theguardian.com/film/neill-blomkamp>, knocked Will 
Smith heist caper Focus off the top spot despite mostly negative reviews.

Chappie stars Dev Patel, Sigourney Weaver, Hugh Jackman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/hugh-jackman> and Sharlto Copley (via 
mo-cap), as well as the South African rap rave duo Die Antwoord, in the 
futuristic tale of a police robot who becomes sapient. The film’s bow compares 
to superior $37.4m and $29.8m openings for District 9 and Elysium in 2009 and 
2013, though the film-maker will hope to do better outside north America.

 The film team review Chappie 
Patel also features heavily in The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-second-best-exotic-marigold-hotel>, which 
opened impressively in third place with $8.6m, despite showing in around half 
as many screens as Chappie. The British actor once again plays ambitious young 
Indian hotelier Sonny, who attempts to expand his empire with the help of his 
elderly ex-pat guests in the sequel. Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Celia Imrie and 
Bill Nighy return for the followup to 2011’s The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, 
while Richard Gere and Tamsin Greig play two new arrivals.

Great publicity campaign, shame about the movie

The top five was rounded out by Matthew Vaughn spy thriller Kingsman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/kingsman-the-secret-service>, with another 
$8.3m in its fourth week for a total of $98m, and The Spongebob Movie: Sponge 
out of Water, with another $7m in its fifth week for a total of $148.9m.

Chappie’s travails were nothing in comparison to those faced by poorly 
reviewed Vince Vaughn comedy Unfinished Business, which opened way down in 10th 
spot with just $4.8m. The weak figures represent the latest in a string of poor 
performances for movies starring the former Swingers actor, and the worst of 
his career for a major release.

There were no other new films in the top 10 this weekend. However, the 
controversial Iraq war biopicAmerican Sniper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/american-sniper> became the highest grossing 
film of 2014 at the North American box office, the film’s $337m total 
surpassing the $336.9m haul taken by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1. Clint 
Eastwood’s Oscar-nominated film also passed $500m worldwide.
