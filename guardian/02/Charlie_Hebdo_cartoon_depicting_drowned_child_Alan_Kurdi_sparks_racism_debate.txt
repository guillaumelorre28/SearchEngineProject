A cartoon in the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/charlie-hebdo> has caused online shock by 
suggesting drowned toddler Alan Kurdi would have grown up to be a sexual abuser 
like those immigrants allegedly involved in the assaults in Cologne.

Under the headline “Migrants”, the drawing shows two lascivious pig-like men 
with their tongues hanging out chasing two terrified, screaming women who are 
running away.


An insert at the top the cartoon contains the famous image of the 
three-year-old Syrian boy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/shocking-image-of-drowned-syrian-boy-shows-tragic-plight-of-refugees>
laying face down dead in the sand. The question at the top of the drawing “What 
would little Aylan have grown up to be?” is answered at the bottom by “Ass 
groper in Germany”.


The implication that all refugees grow up to be gropers has outraged many, but 
some people have defended the cartoon and interpreted it as a satire on tabloid 
perceptions of refugees.


Kurdi’s death on a beach in Turkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> 
last year galvanised public opinion, and the widespread sympathy for the 
humanitarian crisis put pressure on European governments.


But public opinion has turned in places after hundreds of claims of assaults 
by immigrants on women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/11/two-pakistanis-and-a-syrian-man-injured-in-attacks-by-gangs-in-cologne>
 on New Year’s Eve in Cologne, Germany. Police and the media have been accused 
of deliberately under-reporting the events in order not to encourage 
anti-immigrant sentiment.


The cartoon was published a week after the anniversary of the attacks on the 
offices of Charlie Hebdo, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/07/charlie-hebdo-pen-reporters-borders-free-speech-right-to-offend>
when free speech organisations came together to proclaim the importance of 
protecting dissenting voices.

Tweets by a number of writers with a photograph of the Charlie Hedbo cartoon 
provoked intense debate about whether the cartoon is overtly racist or is an 
attempt to satirise media coverage of refugees inEurope

Sunny Hundal called it “disgusting”.

Financial Times journalist Christopher Thompson suggested it may be a satire 
on “sweeping stereotypes about migrants” and not racist at all.

@NesrineMalik <https://twitter.com/NesrineMalik> Or it could be satirizing 
sweeping stereotypes about migrants, i.e. not racist at all. Just saying. It's 
a possibility.

But Libyan American Hend Amry took offence and interpreted the cartoon as 
Charlie Hebdo saying “this drowned baby Syrian refugee would have grown up to 
sexually harass German women”.

Another Twitter commenter, @the_itch1980, said the magazine was hiding behind 
the principles of satire and free speech but was actually racist.

Not Chris Taylor (@the_itch1980) 
Charlie Hebdo reminding us it's fine to be racist if you claim it's satire and 
scream freedom of speech.

The ABC’s Middle East correspondent Sophie McNeill said on Twitter the cartoon 
was “outrageous”, and many agreed with her.
