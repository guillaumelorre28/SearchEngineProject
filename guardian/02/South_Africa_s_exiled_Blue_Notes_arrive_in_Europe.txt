Jazz <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> in South Africa was hampered by 
apartheid's racist system, but musicians nonetheless developed vibrant styles 
splicing US jazz, township dance grooves drawn from marabi and kwela music, 
and, from the early 60s, free improvisation. The best known were the Blue 
Notes, driven into exile in 1964. First in Switzerland, then in London, the 
band developed an exhilarating and influential sound.
