British auteur Arnold hits the open road for a dreamy, dishevelled cruise 
through the US midwest, her gift for sensual storytelling and marginalised 
landscapes still intact. The long, loose journey of lost teen Star (newcomer 
Sasha Lane) and pals including Shia LaBeouf’s Jake might frustrate impatient 
viewers, but it’s easy to get swept away with it all.

A documentary about an actor preparing for a role might sound dull, but not 
here. The subject is Christine Chubbuck, a Florida newscaster who shot herself 
live on air in 1974. Actor Kate Lyn Sheil’s preparations to recreate the event 
spiral out into matters including identity, spectatorship and gun violence in 
this surprisingly complex and gripping tale.

Seedy, offensive, cheap, repetitive and completely absurd, this studiously 
artless indie reaches for the gutter and gets there. Focusing on a father and 
son – the former of whom regularly slathers himself in lard and goes out 
killing people – it’s a guilty, gross-out pleasure.

 It’s hardly a forensic takedown, but Louis Theroux’s stumbling investigation 
into the church of Scientology delivers damning testimonies, scary 
re-enactments and some absurd confrontations with the organisation’s minions, 
whose infamous intimidation tactics fall pathetically flat.

Mel Gibson’s real-life woes add an intriguing autobiographical element to this 
punchy dad thriller. His ravaged, ex-alcoholic tattoo artist has his work cut 
out when his estranged daughter comes knocking at his trailer door; she’s 
brought a whole heap of trouble with her.
