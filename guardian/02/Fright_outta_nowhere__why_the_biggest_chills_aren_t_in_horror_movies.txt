There’s nothing I enjoy more than being condescended to on Twitter, so I’ve 
filled my new film Fear Itself – notionally a journey through horror cinema, 
available now on BBC iPlayer – with movies that stretch the definition of 
horror to its limit. Already my life is a stream of tweets reading: “I think 
you’ll find Enduring Love is a psychological thriller, actually.” But I’ve 
always found the scariest moments in cinema to be those that occupy the spaces 
outside horror, and here are just a few of them…

Roald Dahl <https://www.theguardian.com/books/roalddahl> was famously 
dissatisfied with the first big-screen adaptation of Charlie And The Chocolate 
Factory, though if the film’s most notorious sequence is anything to go by, he 
was probably just annoyed to be outdone in the freaking-out-small-children 
stakes. About 45 minutes into the film, just as you start to get a feel for its 
basically good-natured tone, Wonka invites his guests on a supposedly 
“wondrous” boat ride that’s more of a voyage into the very bowels of hell, 
throughout which the chocolate baron barks unintelligible free-association 
poetry at the children like some kind of intellectually unravelling 
circus-clown Ginsberg.

 The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button. 
David Fincher’s three-hour campaign ad for the best makeup Oscar may have all 
the subtlety of a Mr Men book when it comes to conveying life lessons, but it 
captures the devastating inevitability of ageing with rare clarity. The story 
of a man who ages backwards – much as the film’s starBrad Pitt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradpitt> does every time he shaves off that 
godawful moustache – The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button allows solipsistic 
millennials like myself to comprehend the ravaging onslaught of old age by 
putting it in youthful terms we can understand, most notably in the haunting 
moment an elderly Pitt finally degenerates into a baby.

 Christopher Walken and Adam Sandler in Click. Photograph: Allstar/Sportsphoto 
Many credit Punch-Drunk Love with drawing out the sinister undertones in Adam 
Sandler’s belligerent comic persona, ignoring the fact that Sandler’s most 
unnerving film lies squarely within his mainstream oeuvre. The trailers for 
Click may have foregrounded the mischievous japes that Sandler’s character 
enacts with his magical time-shifting remote control, but they failed to touch 
on the utterly harrowing series of events that constitute the film’s last 
half-hour. By the time the credits roll, Sandler has developed chronic obesity, 
undergone chemotherapy and suffered two heart attacks. For what’s essentially a 
feature-length episode of Bernard’s Watch, it’s a jarringly bleak outcome.

Michael Moore’s breakthrough film is – like most of the capped crusader’s work 
– an often riveting, occasionally irritating study of how people in power make 
life miserable for those at the bottom of society. In the film’s most infamous 
scene, we’re shown how the closure of auto plants in Flint, Michigan has 
affected the life of a single resident, Rhonda Britton, who sells rabbits from 
her home. Moore has barely introduced himself before she leans across the 
threshold of her home and utters what becomes a macabre sort of catchphrase: 
“pets or meat?”

 Tom Hanks in Big. Terrifying. Photograph: REX 
All body-swap comedies are essentially horrific, imbued as they are with the 
existential despair inherent in the exchange of identities between two human 
vessels. Even then, the conclusion of the classicTom Hanks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomhanks> vehicle Big makes for an especially 
disturbing case study. In the film’s final moments, Elizabeth Perkins watches 
as the adult man she’s been fucking for the last two months transforms back 
into a 12-year-old boy, rendering her a statutory rapist and him a tragic 
figure who – having known life as a post-pubescent – must now return to the 
body of a hairless child.

Major illnesses are easy to capture on screen because they’re inherently 
momentous. Harder to get right are those minor ailments – from paper cuts to 
sore throats – that bring with them a special kind of terror. Charlie Kaufman’s 
supremely self-absorbed opus Synecdoche, New York captures the feeling of a 
trivial malady with remarkable precision, introducing its protagonist Caden 
Cotard in the midst of a flurry of psychical imperfections, from cosmetic head 
wounds to worryingly yellow bowel movements. The cumulative effect is a reality 
in which everything is very, very slowly going wrong.

 Mads Mikkelsen in The Hunt. Photograph: courtesy/REX Shutterstock 
Essentially a Danish adaptation of the Brass Eye Paedogeddon special, The Hunt 
sees an entire village descend into hysteria after a young girl mistakenly 
accuses her nursery-school teacher of sexual abuse. And if Noel Edmonds has 
taught us anything, it’s that nothing is more horrific than people who 
mistakenly believe they’re on the side of right. Leading manMads Mikkelsen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mads-mikkelsen> winds up on the receiving end 
of more brutality than he ever meted out as a Bond villain, not least in the 
tenser-than-all-get-out scene in which he unwisely elects to attend a local 
church service.

When a memorable scene crops up in the middle of an otherwise unremarkable 
movie, it’s hard not to suspect that the screenwriter had a single good idea 
and decided to build an entire motion picture around it. In which case, whoever 
wrote The Forgotten must have briefly been filled with the creative talents of 
Almighty God before forgetting how to write altogether, because an hour into 
this nothingyJulianne Moore <https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliannemoore> 
thriller you’ll find one of the most shocking scenes in cinema history. Words 
can’t do it justice, so do yourself a favour and have a look.
