The BBC has injected a small slice of redemption into the bleak ending of JK 
Rowling’s first adult novel, The Casual Vacancy, for its miniseries adaptation, 
produced with HBO. Screenwriter Sarah Phelps told the Radio Times 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/10/jk-rowling-casual-vacancy-bbc-changes-grim-ending>
: “It’s still heartbreaking, but I had to find some kind of redemptive moment 
at the end, that sense that after the tragedy, someone gets to stand with a 
slightly straighter back.”

Rowling’s story of the dark underbelly of an English town is not the first to 
be given a good shakedown by screenwriters. We won’t know how Phelps’s version 
matches up to the novel until 15 February, when its first episode airs, but 
here’s our selection of five screen versions that failed to stick to the 
original story.

The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2014/apr/02/hans-christian-andersen-little-mermaid-frozen>


Ah come on, Disney. Didn’t you even consider using Hans Christian Andersen’s 
wistfully sad original 
<http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheLittleMermaid_e.html>, in which 
the little mermaid sacrifices herself so her prince can be happy? “With eyes 
already glazing she looked once more at the Prince, hurled herself over the 
bulwarks into the sea, and felt her body dissolve in foam.” Instead, we have 
singing crabs and happy ever after.

I Am Legend by Richard Matheson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/jun/25/i-am-legend-author-richard-matheson>


The Will Smith film version 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/21/willsmith.drama>’s ending is much 
more straightforward and heroic than the book’s, in which hero Neville ends his 
story imprisoned. The greatRichard Matheson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/25/richard-matheson-i-am-legend>’s 
conclusion is morally complicated, utterly haunting and makes far more sense of 
the story’s title. “I don’t know why Hollywood is fascinated by my book when 
they never care to film it as I wrote it,” the novelistis reported to have said

The Shining by Stephen King
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/21/stephen-king-shining-sequel-interview>

King is not complimentary about Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/06/king-kubrick-shining-adaptation>. 
The novelist’s version ends with the Overlook in flames; Kubrick’s haunted 
hotel survives, but the director kills off a key character, alive in King’s 
version and featuring in recentsequel Doctor Sleep

A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess

Kubrick again; Burgess 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/aug/06/archive-clockwork-orange-burgess>
 hated the adaptation too, calling it “a film which seemed to glorify sex and 
violence” and which “made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what 
it was about”, so much so that he repudiated the novel entirely. He 
particularly objected to the ending, which leaves off his final chapter of 
redemption for an adult Alex.

From Russia With Love by Ian Fleming
 <https://www.theguardian.com/books/ian-fleming>

Fleming’s conclusion left Bond on the floor, having been kicked in the shins by
Rosa Klebb 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/dec/23/baddies-in-books-rosa-klebb-the-spy-filled-with-ian-flemings-poison>
 and her poisoned boots. “The inference was that Ian was keeping his options 
open,” writes Andrew Lycett in his biography. “He was again undecided whether 
to continue his hero’s exploits in the future.” Film-makers had no such qualms, 
and made sure 007 was saved by his Bond girl.
