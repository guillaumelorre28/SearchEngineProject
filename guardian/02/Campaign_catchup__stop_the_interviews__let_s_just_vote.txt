It’s the final countdown. Hours before election day, the last batch of opinion 
polls – and the bookies –suggest a very close race 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/01/sophomore-surge-by-first-term-mps-could-push-coalition-over-the-line>
 with the Coalition just ahead. Another term ofMalcolm Turnbull was also 
endorsed byalmost every metropolitan masthead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/01/election-editorials-overwhelmingly-endorse-malcolm-turnbull-and-coalition>
.

But Turnbull did not end the campaign on a high note. At first reporters were 
told he’d be forgoing his daily press conference, having “done enough 
interviews today”.

Then he had a change of heart, deciding to get the band together, one last 
time.

This, media were told, was no backflip – just crossed wires. But it did follow 
Turnbull’s, er,bold declaration on national television that the cost of going 
to see the doctor would “absolutely” not rise under theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> due to the Medicare 
freeze.

Malcolm Turnbull guarantees that cost of seeing a GP will not rise

"Can you guarantee our viewers won't pay more to see the doctor due to this 
freeze?"

Turnbull: "Sam, absolutely."

Worth bookmarking..
 <https://twitter.com/GrogsGamut/status/748702496495767553> July 1, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/GrogsGamut/status/748702496495767553> 
Campaign spokesman Mathias Cormann would not repeat the prime minister’s 
personal guarantee that patients would not pay more under the Coalition’s 
policy when it was put to him on the ABC, instead stating that “doctors will 
get a tax cut”.

Naturally, it was top of the agenda for Turnbull’s eventual press conference.

The prime minister said his point was “clear”: patient fees would of course 
rise if doctors wanted them to. But doctors wanting to charge their patients 
more could not be “credibly [attribute]” to the freeze on indexation or, by 
extension, the Coalition, oh no, of course not.

“If a doctor wishes to charge more, he or she may attribute that higher charge 
to whatever they like but they cannot credibly attribute it to not getting an 
extra 60 cents.”

Earlier, the Australian Medical Association president, Michael Gannon, had 
said the freeze had brought GPs to “breaking point” and fees could rise by as 
much as $15: “We know there are some GPs that are changing their billing 
practices and that commences today, on July 1.”

All in all, it was a bit of a bum note in the final 48 hours of the campaign. 
Bill Shortencalled it a “new low”: “It is outrageous. It is untruthful. And 
[Turnbull] knows the facts are different to what he said on television this 
morning.”

Turnbull had also called Shorten a liar, which he refused to acknowledge 
beyond this withering rejoinder: “I am running for prime minister. I am not 
running for chief name caller of Australia.”

If the last eight weeks have taught us anything, it’s that there are plenty of 
different names for the same thing.

Free with the facts 

About 24 hours after his call for a more united, civil approach to politics, 
and within hours of his calling Shorten a liar, Turnbull said Labor opposed the 
China free-trade agreement – “extraordinary”, he said, and also untrue.

Though Labor sought amendments to elements of the deal, to say it opposed it 
is a complete fiction. At the time the major parties came to an agreement on 
the deal,Andrew Robb even praised the “constructive” discussions that had been 
“had in good faith” withPenny Wong, the opposition trade spokeswoman.

Here are some suggestions for criticisms that can be made of Labor’s approach 
to free trade, all with the added benefit of being actually true: its link to 
the trade union movement, which did oppose the FTA. The sensitivity stemming 
from its competition with the Greens. The very real danger of its backsliding 
on trade liberalisation.

Or, you know, you can just make something up.

Marathon not a sprint

Shorten’s future, should the Coalition be re-elected on Saturday, continues to 
be the subject of rampant speculation, which he must be just delighted about, 
it being the eve of the election and all.

Following reports that Shorten can expect a challenge from Anthony Albanese if 
he doesn’t win by at least 10 seats, the Herald Sunhas quoted a 
<http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/cfa-dispute-cruels-labors-federal-election-chances-as-mps-turn-on-daniel-andrews/news-story/5abe19517b4433439f02cd0cb3188a88>
 Labor MP who said Albo’s supporters are actively attempting to undermine the 
campaign.

Shorten continued to deflect questions on this topic on Friday, because, well, 
what else can he do? Reiterating his intention to win the election, he said he 
did not believe in “an honourable second place”.

He did clarify that if he were to lose the election he would keep on jogging. 
Shorten has reportedly gone for a run every day of the campaign – no mean feat, 
given that he’s probably the busiest he’s ever been, too (“Bill Shorten’s 
Running Regime Will Actually Inspire You

” – BuzzFeed).

Known unknowns 

As much as a Coalition win is being touted as a foregone conclusion, it’s 
worth stating the obvious: it’s not over until the last vote is counted. 
There’s another major player in this contest, and that’s voter dissatisfaction 
– people who simply don’t know, even now, where their vote is going to.

As Guardian Australia’s Katharine Murphy has pointed out, it’s the biggest 
unknown of this campaign, complicating any predictions for the final result – 
not that that’s stopping anyone.

Laura Tingle of the Australian Financial Review has also remarked on the 
<http://www.afr.com/opinion/columnists/laura-tingle/election-2016-the-greatest-story-will-be-the-voters-themselves-20160630-gpv6l8>
 “huge undecided vote”, reportedly as much as 10% – about double the normal 
levels. “There has never seemed such a big gap between what the published polls 
tell us – a tight race and a hung parliament – and the overwhelming expectation 
of a now comfortable win for the Coalition.”

“All will be revealed tomorrow night,” said Turnbull sagely. “Everyone has had 
a view about what the Australian people think. Tomorrow they will tell us. And 
they will tell us emphatically and decisively.”

He hopes. Check in with us at Guardian Australia for the action as it happens.

The world’s first known amphibious centipede – which grows up to 20cm (nearly 
8in) long and has an excruciating bite – has been discovered by accident by a 
scientist on his honeymoon in Thailand.

Entomologist George Beccaloni said the discovery was “quite a surprise” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/01/giant-swimming-venomous-centipede-found-south-east-asia>
, and not necessarily a pleasant one: “It was pretty horrific-looking: very big 
with long legs and a horrible dark, greenish-black colour.”
