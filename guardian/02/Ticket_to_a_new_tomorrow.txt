The floodlights click on and light up the stage. A man is shouting names and 
handing out tickets to boys and girls, who run to collect them. The actor 
represents fate and these tickets are the children's futures. Some are given 
parents who work hard and love and support them, others receive a harsher fate, 
parents who neglect and beat them.

The performance has been organised by M'Lop Tapang and the actors are all 
former street children and staff. Tonight it is held in M'Lop Tapang's own 
theatre but it will be staged in slums and beaches across the town. It is part 
of an effort to educate parents and the wider community about the need to 
protect vulnerable young people and to consider the forces that have driven 
them to live and work on the streets.

The show also features traditional Cambodian dancing, acrobatics and a pair of 
Charlie Chaplinesque clowns. It receives thunderous applause and the parents in 
the audience are lavish in their praise.

Maggie Eno hopes that this play and other arts shows will encourage both 
tourists and Cambodians "to think about the stories behind the children when 
they see them working and begging."
