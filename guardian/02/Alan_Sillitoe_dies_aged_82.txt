Novelist Alan Sillitoe <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alan-sillitoe> died 
today at the age of 82, his family said.

The Nottingham-born writer, whose novels marked him out as one of the Angry 
Young Men of British fiction who emerged in the 1950s, died at Charing Cross 
hospital in London.

His son, David, said he hoped his father would be remembered for his 
contribution to literature.

Sillitoe is also survived by his wife, the poet Ruth Fainlight, and a 
daughter, Susan.

Sillitoe left school at 14 and worked in a bicycle factory in his native 
Nottingham before serving in the RAF.

His breakthrough came with the publication of the novel Saturday Night and 
Sunday Morning in 1958.

It was made into a film, starring Albert Finney, as was his next novel The 
Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner, which featured Tom Courtenay in the 
lead role.

Both are seen as classic examples of kitchen sink dramas reflecting the 
reality of life in Britain at the mid-point of the 20th century.

Sillitoe also published several volumes of poetry, children's books and plays.
