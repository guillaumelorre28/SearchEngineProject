Who is going to win the World Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football>?
Germany. No European team has ever won in South America but I think that if 
anyone can, Germany can. If it's not Brazil, it will be Germany.

Who are you most looking forward to watching?
My mum's Croatian, so I always like watching Croatia. They're playing the 
opening game against Brazil, which will be a massive thing.

Do you have a favourite strip?
To see the Brazilians in their strip will make the heart flutter for 
a football fan of any vintage.

Who's the most stylish footballer?
I know Theo Walcott's not going, but he's a pretty dapper young man. But they 
all know how to dress – they all make me feel like a right lump.

Who's the best pundit?
I couldn't choose between Lee Dixon  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Dixon>
andRoy Keane <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roy-keane>. Lee is 
a brilliant analyst and Roy is just brilliant television.

What would you change about footballers?
I think they should be able to speak much more frankly in post-match 
interviews.

What kind of vegetable will the Sun compare Roy Hodgson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/roy-hodgson> to?
I don't think they will – there's too much respect for him. But he's quite a 
sophisticated man, so if they did perhaps it would be that romanesco 
cauliflower.

Which pundit would you most like to share an apartment with in Rio?
Lee Dixon, because we're close friends. We'd sit up in bed in our pyjamas like 
Morecambe and Wise <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morecambe_and_Wise>, and play 
Scrabble long into the night.

Who is going to win the World Cup?
The favourite is still Brazil. They're at home, so they'll really want to do 
it for the fans and supporters and the people of Brazil.

Who are you most looking forward to watching?
Belgium. They could be a surprise. If you look at all the players in the 
Premier League who are also playing in the Belgium national team –Hazard 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Hazard>, Lukaku 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romelu_Lukaku>, Dembélé 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousa_Demb%C3%A9l%C3%A9>, Mirallas 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mirallas>, Kompany 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Kompany>, Mignolet 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Mignolet> – they have a great team.

Can you say anything in Portuguese? 
Yes, but it's too rude to repeat.

Who's the most stylish footballer?
Ronaldo. He likes his fashion, but he needs to work on his haircut.

What's the worst football player cliche?
"We're playing for the three points."

Who's the best pundit?
Apart from me? Jamie Redknapp <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Redknapp>.

Who has the worst haircut in football?
Paul Pogba <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pogba>.

Who's your all-time football hero?
Johan Cruyff <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff>. I grew up watching 
him. He was one of the best players in the world, so I've tried to imitate him.

How far will England get?
I hope they will get as far as possible. There are low expectations, but I 
hope people are wrong with their predictions.

Which pundit would you most like to share an apartment with in Rio?
Lee Dixon. We fought on the football pitch, but we're good friends and we'd 
have a good time.

Who is going to win the World Cup?
I hate to admit it but Germany are up there, to be honest. They've gone 
through their boom, their bust, and now they're back again.

Who are you most looking forward to watching?
Refreshingly, without any expectations, England. Otherwise, Spain.

Who's the most stylish footballer?
It's got to be Beckham.

What's your worst fashion moment?
On The Football League Show <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mfmt9>, 
I occasionally slip on a blue shirt with black trousers, and then get hammered 
for it. You don't realise how fashion-savvy a lot of the viewers are: you can't 
get away with anything.

What's the worst football pundit cliche? 
"Take it one game at a time."

Who's your all-time football hero?
Former Leicester captain Steve Walsh 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Walsh_%28footballer%29>.

Who has the worst haircut in football?
The mohicans that are shaved round the sides are just horrendous.

Which pundit would you least like to have a fight with?
Graeme Souness <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Souness>. He's as tough 
as nails.

Which pundit would you most like to share an apartment with in Rio?
David Ginola. He's just Mr Cool.

Who is going to win the World Cup?
Brazil.

Can you say anything in Portuguese?
"Natas", a lovely little custard tart. You can get them at Nando's.

Do you have a favourite strip?
My favourite strip is yellow – not Brazil but Norwich City.

Who's the most stylish footballer?
Frank Lampard. He wears a suit well.

What's your worst fashion moment?
When I was a CBBC presenter, all I ever wore were brightly coloured T-shirts 
with big slogans, which in the mid-90s were all the rage.

What's the worst football player cliche?
When people say "for me". They'll say, "For me, I think…" and that really gets 
on my nerves.

Who has the best haircut in football?
David Luiz. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Luiz> He's got brilliant 
Sideshow Bob hair – it's very cool.

Who's your all-time football hero?
The former Norwich City midfielder Jeremy Goss 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Goss>.

What would you change about footballers?
I'd force them to do more interviews.

What kind of vegetable will the Sun compare Roy Hodgson to?
Hopefully sprouting broccoli as he "sprouts" an incredible victory at the 
World Cup.

Which pundit would you least like to have a fight with?
Roy Keane <https://www.theguardian.com/football/roy-keane> – super-hard as a 
player and super-hard as a pundit.

Which pundit would you most like to share an apartment with in Rio?
Alan Shearer. We spent a lot of time together at Euro 2012 and he was good at 
putting his hand in his pocket and buying the drinks.
