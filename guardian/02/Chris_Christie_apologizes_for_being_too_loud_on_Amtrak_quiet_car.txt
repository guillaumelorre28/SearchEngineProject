A spokeswoman for the New Jersey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/new-jersey> governor, Samantha Smith, said 
he accidentally took a seat in the quiet car while traveling from Washington 
back to his state on Sunday morning.

Smith said that after breaking “the cardinal rule of the quiet car”, Christie 
promptly left for the café car. She offered sincere apologies to any train 
passengers who were offended.

One such passenger told CNN he heard Christie saying “this is frickin’ 
ridiculous” and “seriously?” over the phone. Another told Gawker he had raised 
his voice towards two secret service agents travelling with him.

The Republican presidential candidate had appeared on CBS’s Face the Nation 
earlier in the morning. He attracted controversy during his appearance by
criticising the Black Lives Matter movement

, which he said was “calling for the murder of police officers”.


Amtrak <https://www.theguardian.com/business/amtrak> conductors generally urge 
passengers to maintain a “library-like atmosphere” in the quiet car. It is not 
uncommon for conductors to ask noisier passengers to change cars.
