After belting out Memory throughout the festive season, Nicole Scherzinger is 
set to step down from her role as Grizabella in Cats. But the West End musical 
has been extended to the end of April.

Scherzinger is to be replaced by Kerry Ellis, best known for her long-running 
role as Elphaba in Wicked, which she played in both the West End and on 
Broadway. Ellis is a musical theatre mainstay, having also played major roles 
in We Will Rock You, Oliver!, and Les Misérables. She takes over from 
Scherzinger on 9 February.

Cats is one of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s most successful musicals, spending 21 
years in the West End after its debut in 1981. The current staging, based on 
Trevor Nunn’s original version, earneda four-star review

 from the Guardian’s Michael Billington, who called it “an invigorating 
dance-spectacle”.

Lloyd Webber has been full of praise for Scherzinger’s take on Grizabella, 
telling the Daily Mail
