The North Sea joins the English Channel at the Belgian coastal city of Ostend. 
J.M.W. Turner visited Ostend on three occasions. Two paintings were the product 
of his last visit in 1840; Ostend Harbour and Ostend. They both capture the 
town twenty years before its most celebrated artist, James Ensor (1860-1949), 
was born and also before the small fishing port was transformed under the 
patronage of Leopold II, King of Belgium, into a bustling, fashionable resort 
popular with English tourists known as the ‘Queen of Belgian Beaches.’

Like Turner, Ensor was drawn to the light of the North Sea with its dramatic 
seasonal changes, from clear blue skies in the summer to dark foreboding clouds 
in the winter. In his collected writings Ecrits, published in 1921, Ensor wrote 
“I have no children, but light is my daughter, light one and indivisible, 
light, the painter’s bread, light, the painter’s crumb, light, queen of our 
senses.”

Although Ensor was a rare traveller, he came to London for four days in 1892 
to study Turner and he undoubtedly became an influence on his work. Ensor 
captured the alluring light of the North Sea in his beachscapes, for example, 
the Bathing Hut (1876) when he was still only sixteen and studying at the 
Académie des Beaux Arts d’Ostend.

His painting Large View of Ostend (Rooftops of Ostend) (1884) reveals the 
depth of his interest in Turner. The view of his home town, from the attic 
studio of his parent’s house, is dominated by the vast sky complete with 
boiling clouds. Closer inspection reveals the roof tops and church spire 
cowering under this brooding sky. Curated by celebrated contemporary Belgian 
artist Luc Tuymans, ‘Intrigue: James Ensor by Luc Tuymans,’ presents a rare 
opportunity to reappraise the extraordinary career of an artist who has, 
despite having an English father, been surprisingly overlooked in the UK.

With James Ensor’s visions of the sea in mind we’d like to see your own work 
on the theme of North Sea.
