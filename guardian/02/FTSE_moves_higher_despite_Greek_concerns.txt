Leading shares are moving higher after Thursday’s dip and despite continuing 
worries about Greece’s precarious financial situation.

Among the risers is ITV, as analysts at Liberum listed it as one of its group 
of potential takeover targets. The broadcaster has been buying up programme 
makers, including the company behind The Voice, Talpa Media, in an attempt to 
broaden its studio business and reduce its dependence on advertising. But this 
could put it in the takeover spotlight, said Liberum:

ITV’s recent content diversification makes it an attractive M&A target 
[although]ITV <https://www.theguardian.com/business/itv> has been called very 
pricey by a couple of conglomerates.

But Liberum still has a buy recommendation with a 330p target price. In the 
market ITV has added 3.2p to 269.3p.

Overall the FTSE 100 has climbed 18.51 points to 7078.96, with UK unemployment 
rate falling to 5.6%, its lowest since July 2008.

Investors will be watching out later for US inflation figures and a sentiment 
index, for further signs about when the Federal Reserve might raise interest 
rates.

And of course the continuing attempts by Greece and its creditors to resolve 
the country’s debt crisis before its cash runs out will also be crucial to 
market sentiment.

Trading volumes were likely to be lower than normal after technical issues at 
Bloomberg.

Among the risers Severn Trent has added 42p to £21.63 as investors sought 
defensive stocks amid the uncertainty.

Consumer shares were also in demand, with Primark owner Associated British 
Foods up 34p to £29.92 and Whitbread climbing 55p to £52.80.

Rolls Royce has risen 15p to 995p after it won its largest ever order, worth 
$9.2bn, to supply Trent 900 engines and service support to Emirates.
