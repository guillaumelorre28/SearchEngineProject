Q: What is the science behind Petr Cech's scrum cap? Considering that he 
suffered a skull fracture, would it be cynical to think of a small piece of 
padded material as just another sponsorship opportunity?

A: My eldest son has just started contact training in rugby and I have joined 
the well trodden parental trek to the club shop for headgear, body armour and 
gumshields, which are considered cool and de rigueur.

How the cultural map is changing. The attitudes of Aussie rules footballers to 
wearing scrumcaps tends to be that, although it is probably a good idea, you 
are a big girl's blouse if you consider it. Even now, opinion among rugby 
players and coaches remains divided.

The risk of concussion, the most common form of traumatic brain injury, is 
certainly high in sports such as rugby and some sports make helmets compulsory. 
But there is little evidence that headgear reduces the incidence of concussion 
and there is even debate as to whether it might increase it. Yes, it safeguards 
against cuts, but, with what amounts to no more than 1cm of padding, it could, 
it is argued, create an inappropriate feeling of invulnerability.

There may be positive psychological benefits important to those more hesitant 
to undertake contact sport, those recovering from a significant head injury or, 
even more rarely, neurosurgery, as in Cech's case. I for one will not be 
stopping my son wearing his new 'gear' this week, provided I can still afford 
it.
