So here's the full list of gear and goodies you'll need to join the kitchen 
clickalong on Thursday of this week. Being an Italian seaside classic it's a 
chance to catch one last whiff of summer holidays before autumn starts to turn 
everyone's minds to heavier fare.

There's nothing hard to find on the list, and there are still a few days to 
make sure your tomatoes are good and ripe (put them in a bowl with a banana for 
a couple of days if they need a little encouragement) and have a word with the 
fishmonger to make sure what you need will be available tomorrow or Thursday.

We'll reconvene shortly before 8pm on Thursday to whip up a Mediterranean 
storm, and there'll be a delicious meal for four on the table at 9 o'clock.


Kit

Food processor/electric whisk
Griddle (nice but optional)
A wide, heavy bottomed saucepan
2 shallow trays
Sieve
Slotted spoon

Ingredients

250g squid, cleaned weight
8 tiger prawns, about 250g 
250g salmon 
450g white fish: haddock, cod, coley, whiting or something which is quite 
dense and not too mealy

For the aioli

4 anchovy fillets
2 egg yolks
Juice of a lemon
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
200ml light olive oil
50ml extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper

For the salad

A couple of handfuls of rocket
1-2 heads of chicory 
1 head of radicchio

For the bruschetta

4 slices of sourdough
3 large very ripe vine-ripened tomatoes
A small red onion, finely chopped
A handful of basil leaves, roughly torn/chopped
1 red chilli if you feel like it
A glug of extra virgin olive oil
A splash of red wine vinegar
1 clove garlic

For the frying

An egg
Some plain flour (around 100g)
A small bottle sparkling water, cold
1-1.5l (depending on the width of your pan) groundnut, rapeseed or veg oil 

2 lemons, cut into wedges for serving

THE PREP

Prep the fish first and get it good to go. For your squid, it should come in 
three pieces. Keep the wings whole, cut the main body into rough 2 cm rings (or 
whatever you think looks right) and the tentacles cut into whatever you feel 
like.
