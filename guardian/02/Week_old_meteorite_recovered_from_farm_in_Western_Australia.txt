Scientists have recovered a freshly fallen meteorite from a farm several 
hundred kilometres north-east of Perth.

Members of Curtin university’s desert fireball network team tracked the 
1.15kg, squashed brick-shaped meteorite, which fell to Earth near Morawa just 
after 8pm on 31 October.

It was found less than a week after it landed, thanks to swift reports by 
members of the public to the network’s Fireballs in the Sky citizen science app.

DFN founder Prof Phil Bland said the fireball was picked up by four of the 
team’s cameras in Perenjori, Northam, Badgingarra and Hyden, which helped it 
find where the meteorite hit the ground.

“Our team was able to track the fall line and calculate its landing spot to 
within 200 metres of where it was subsequently found,” Bland said.

The meteorite is predicted to have been 50-100 times bigger than its current 
size before it it fell through the atmosphere.


Martin Towner from Curtin’s department of applied geology described the rock 
as a pristine, unweathered, fresh sample.

Towner said there was no visible impact on the ground where it was found.

Prof Bland said of the 50,000 meteorites that have been discovered, scientists 
have only worked out the origins of between 20 to 30.

“Meteorites tell us pretty much everything we want to know about the solar 
system ... but unless we know where they came from, there’s a really big piece 
of that puzzle left,” he said.


Meteorites have decelerated to a free-fall velocity by the time they hit the 
earth, travelling at the same speed as a rock thrown from a tall building.

Under federal government law, the meteorite belongs to the state and the 
trustees of the Western Australian Museum will become the custodians.
