Eweleaze Farm, Osmington, Weymouth

The best way to enjoy Dorset's Jurassic coastline is to get your walking boots 
on, and you'd be hard pressed to find a better base than Eweleaze Farm. 
Situated along the stretch of coastline between Durdle Door and Weymouth, 
Eweleaze is one of the loveliest places to camp in England. Campfire smoke 
wafts through the air, and there's a real sense of shared energy; a community 
with a purpose – like some kind of cult celebrating the outdoors. And let's not 
forget the location. From many pitches, you can view the curved coastline, and 
there's the added luxury of a private beach, which is perfect for swimming, 
paddling, snorkelling and sandcastling.
• 01305 833690. Adults £6-12 a night, children £3-6. Open end July-end August

Burnbake, near Corfe Castle
 Photograph: Alamy 
It's the small touches at Burnbake that quietly add up to make it a truly 
exceptional campsite. The main attraction is the woodland location; while some 
areas have been cleared for easy pitching, most of the site has simply been 
left untouched, so you can seek out your perfect shady spot. A small play area 
provides some old-school fun, including every kids' favourite, the swinging 
tyre. During school holidays, make sure you visit the on-site cafe; a cosy 
little joint that's perfect when you need a night off from cooking.
• 01929 480570. An adult with tent, car or camper van £8-10 a night, extra 
adults £2-4 and children £1-3. Open March-September

Downshay Farm, near Swanage
 Downshay Farm, near Swanage 
No trip to Downshay Farm would be complete without taking the Swanage to 
Norden steam locomotive (swanagerailway.co.uk <http://www.swanagerailway.co.uk/>
), which stops close to the campsite. It's a fitting way to arrive, as Downshay 
Farm isn't a modern, manicured kind of site, mainly because it isn't very flat. 
But sloping campsites are often on higher ground and higher ground often means 
views, and these views stretch out across the Dorset countryside like a 
landscape painting. Enjoy looking out across the rugged hills, the medieval 
ruins of Corfe Castle, and glimpse the chugging steam train as it snakes 
through the valley below.
• 01929 480316. Adults £4 per night, children £1-£2, plus £2-4 per tent. Open 
mid-July to early September

Hook Farm, Uplyme, Lyme Regis
 Hook Farm, Uplyme, Lyme Regis 
After a warm welcome at reception, you'll be ushered into a beautiful terraced 
garden valley, where campers are privy to one of the best-kept camping secrets 
on the south coast. Spacious pitches allow plenty of room to spread out, with a 
dozen or so tucked in among various nooks and crannies, offering a little more 
privacy. Early risers should head west to enjoy the morning sun, and night owls 
looking for a lie-in can camp east, where the morning rays fall last. Sunsets 
are best viewed from the top of the hill, and the lower area is better shielded 
from the elements.
• 01297 442801. Tent plus two adults £15-26 a night, children £2.50, under-5s 
free. Open March-October

Riversidelakes, Horton, Wimborne
 Riversidelakes, Horton, Wimborne 
Riversidelakes has managed to retain an aura of secrecy, aided by low-key 
signposting that helps to conceal its magic. The camping area comprises 12 
acres of meadow and woodland, with three lakes enclosed by circumferential 
paths and thick shrubbery. Mown pathways lead to clusters of pitches separated 
by long, wild grasses that offer great privacy; all that sedentary campers can 
see of their neighbours are the wafts of smoke rising from their braziers. 
Junior campers can be found tearing along the paths on their bicycles, climbing 
trees, or playing on rope swings. As for everyone else, they're just kicking 
back and enjoying the magic.
• 01202 821212. Adults £7-£10 a night, children £5-£7, under-5s free. Open

Sea Barn Farm, Fleet, Weymouth

This gorgeous little tenters' campsite, neatly contained by a low stone wall, 
has the most fantastic panorama as a backdrop; the view of Fleet Lagoon, Lyme 
Bay and the Jurassic Coast can be seen from many of the pitches. A friendly, 
family atmosphere permeates throughout; kids will be in their element with a 
great playground, use of a swimming pool and an adjacent field full of amiable, 
prize-winning cattle to admire. Facilities are shared with the adjacent touring 
park, so families can get the best of both worlds – quiet and peaceful camping,

Acton Field, Langton Matravers, Swanage
 Acton Field, Langton Matravers, Swanage 
Hidden behind a discreet residential slip road in Langton Matravers, random 
tufts of wild flowers adorn the natural bumps and curves of Acton Field on the 
Purbeck Hills. The unspoilt – verging on wild – terrain comprises a wide, 
sloping, and grassy campsite where you can see Swanage Bay glistening in the 
distance. Essential day trips include the scenic cliff-top walk from the 
village to swim at the Dancing Ledge tidal rock pool and caves. In 40 minutes 
you can walk along Priests Way down to Swanage Bay for a fish-and-chip supper 
by the beach.
• 01929 439424. £6-12 per adult per night (depending on tent size). Open 
spring bank holiday week, then late July-late Aug.

Tom's Field, Langton Matravers, Swanage
 Tom's Field, Langton Matravers, Swanage 
Tom's Field comprises just over four acres of gently rolling grass with old 
stone walling around much of its perimeter. It's divided into a flat lower 
field, and a slightly more undulating higher field, which is compensated for by 
the outlook. If you're looking the right way, you can see a long view seaward 
across Swanage Bay, and on a clear day you might see the Isle of Wight. No stay 
is complete without visiting theSquare and Compass 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/13/the-square-and-compass-north-matravers-dorset>
 in Worth Matravers, a traditional country pub that has become a local 
attraction in its own right.
• 01929 427110. Pitches (including one or two adults) £7-£18 per night, extra 
adults £5-£6, children (four-13) £2. Open March-October

 Smuggler’s Inn, near Rosewall Camping 
Rosewall Camping is a highly polished, lovingly-manicured camping ground with 
plenty of awards and accolades to prove it – perfect for a comfortable, easy, 
hassle-free family holiday. Such perfection won't suit all campers, but the 
cracking views and coastal location will. There is a small rocky beach about 
200m from the site. It's fun for rock-pooling or catching crabs, otherwise the 
shingle beach at Ringstead Bay is ideal for swimming. Head down the road to the

a little stream running through a pleasant garden kitted out with swings and 
slides.
