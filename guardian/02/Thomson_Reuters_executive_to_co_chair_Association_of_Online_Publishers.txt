Thomson Reuters executive Tim Faircliff will be the new co-chair at the 
Association of Online Publishers <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aop>.

Faircliff, who is general manager for consumer media at the financial 
information and news provider, will be AOP co-chair until March next year, 
working alongside the Telegraph Media Group's digital and multimedia director, 
Alison Reay, to lead the trade body.

Both executives take over the role previously held by Simon Waldman, director 
of digital publishing at Guardian Media Group, who has stepped aside after two 
years chairing AOP.

AOP chose to divide the role late last year so that a wider group of 
representatives could bring their influence to the role. Reay brings experience 
from the advertising sector, while Faircliff has worked in a variety of roles 
around digital content online and on mobile.

"Reuters has long supported AOP's focused and varied efforts on behalf of 
online publishing," said Faircliff. "It is truly an honour to be appointed as 
co-chair of such an impactful organisation, at such a crucial time for our 
industry."
