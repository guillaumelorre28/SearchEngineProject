Winning tip: General Burgoyne, Great Urswick


In the un-touristy and stunning south Lakes, Great Urswick is a sleepy, pretty 
village, with whitewashed cottages and a tarn complete with ducks, and this pub 
is a cracker. Roaring fires, flagged floors and cosy snugs, well-kept beer and 
a menu that might surprise you. Chef/owner Craig Sherrington is doing clever 
things with local produce (expect sea bass, mackerel and rabbit) in an 
innovative but unpretentious way.

The Cuckoo Brow Inn, Far Sawrey
The Sawrey Hotel between Hawkshead and the Windermere ferry has been revamped 
as the Cuckoo Brow Inn. Food, served noon-9pm, is sourced as much as possible 
from within a 20-mile radius – and with good local beers to boot. They 
genuinely welcome walkers, cyclists, wet dogs and noisy children. Best enjoyed 
when it's cold outside and a roaring fire's blazing – so July or August then.

The Punch Bowl, Crosthwaite
Many visitors to the Lake District never see the lovely Lyth Valley, near 
Kendal. They're missing a treat, especially in spring when the damson trees are 
in blossom. The quality of the food at the Punch Bowl is, on its own, reason 
enough to visit. It's a traditional Lakes building with stylish and welcoming 
interiors, and an interesting menu.

The Golden Rule, Ambleside
If you're not wanting a full three-course meal, there can be no finer pub in 
Lakeland than the Golden Rule, off the town's main street. Beautifully 
unchanged in decades, it is a haven for locals, walkers and tourists. Food is 
limited to excellent pork pies and scotch eggs and the ale is all from local 
breweries. Evening guests can join in impromptu singsongs.

The Beer Hall, Hawkshead Brewery, Staveley
This is a modern pub attached to the Hawkshead Brewery (which moved to 
Staveley from Hawkshead some years ago), backing on to the river Kent. 
Excellent cask and bottled beer to drink there or take away. Pub grub with a 
regional twist, and informative brewery tours.

 The Drunken Duck ... 'seventh heaven for beer lovers' 
The Drunken Duck Inn, Ambleside
Most free houses have real ales, but this pub has its own on-site brewery (try 
the Tag Lag). It's seventh heaven for beer lovers. And foodies. The restaurant 
is stuffed with delicious locally sourced food (the game pie is to die for) and 
the wine list will suit all tastes and pockets. After all the fine dining and 
imbibing at lunchtime you won't want to move, so book a room and enjoy it all 
again at dinnertime.

The Mortal Man, Troutbeck
This is a truly welcoming pub – we've visited in autumn when the open fires 
provided much needed warmth after a day on the fells. Our last visit was on one 
of the few days the sun shone earlier this summer, when the splendid garden 
proved a suntrap.

The Masons Arms, Cartmel Fell
If you like a middle-of-nowhere, cosy, traditional Lakeland pub with good 
food, this is it. If you like a fellside pub with comfy rooms and a view, this 
is it. If you like to sip a local beer in the open air, overlooking the 
damson-laden Lyth Valley ... you've guessed it.

The Kirkstile Inn, Loweswater
This place is a must for anyone seeking excellent food (and real ale) in 
glorious scenery. Much of the food is locally sourced: Cumbrian steak-and-ale 
pie, slow-roasted Lakeland lamb. Vegetarians are well catered for, and do try 
the Eton Mess with damson sloe gin berry compote. It also serves the award 
winning Loweswater Gold ale.

The Prince of Wales, Foxfield
This friendly pub with its own brewery, pub games, papers and comfy chairs 
prides itself on "food for drinkers" – on Fridays and at weekends. After a hike 
up Black Combe, to contemplate the lateHarry Griffin 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/jul/12/guardianobituaries.media>'s 
favourite view, the pies, with a filling of your choice, are well worth the 
half-hour wait.

Old Dungeon Ghyll Hotel Hikers Bar, Great Langdale
This is my favourite pub, great after a long walk. Beer – Theakstons and Black 
Sheep among others – is looked after properly. Food is simple but well-cooked 
and plentiful – cumberland sausage, veg lasagne, soups. Inside there are bare 
floorboards and wooden benches and tables, just right if you have muddy boots 
on. The beer garden at the front is quiet with great views, and sparrows, blue 
tits, and other small birds come up to your tables.

Kings Arms, Keswick
The courtyard behind this pub has a sports bar (Casa's) and a pizzeria (LB's) 
that was perfect for a family. We dined outdoors, watched sport on TV, and 
could order from any of these three places. Along with pints of ale and cider 
from the bar, we ate thin and crispy pizza from a wood-fired oven.

Dog and Gun, Keswick
This old-fashioned and busy pub has an in-house menu for dogs which includes a 
mouth-watering range of treats and chews at reasonable prices (biscuits 5p) plus
free drinks (non-alcoholic). Tell your human to try the real ales and the 
delicious homemade goulash. The portions are so large that dogs will get lots 
of tasty bites. Slide your spare change into the cracks in the walls to support 
mountain rescue. A perfect ending to a day on the Fells.

The Black Bull Inn, Coniston
The Black Bull Inn is in the heart of Coniston, on the main junction in the 
village. You can happily watch the world, and their dog, go by in the suntrap 
beer garden, get a bit more cosy in one of the many rooms inside, or grab a 
seat at the bar. It does good grub, but the reason you should stop off here is 
for the beers – theConiston Brewing Company <http://www.conistonbrewery.com/> 
brews next door (spy its hydrometers and tanks from the car park if you are a 
real real ale fan) and so they serve lots of their beers on tap or by the 
bottle.
