Cry freedom

The letters that scream from a makeshift-looking sackcloth and plaster base 
have the desperate energy of graffiti in the red of a bloodied handprint. The 
central “E” hollers at you – E for Ellas (Greece), for Eleftheria (freedom) and 
for EAM, the resistance movement that challenged the Axis occupation of Greece 
during the second world war.

Journey without end

Created in 1959, this was not just a work about the past. The dot dot dot in 
its title suggests ongoing struggles of oppressed peoples, including the 
military dictatorship that had forced Caniaris to leave Greece.

Agit-prop poetry

Today the late Caniaris is celebrated in his homeland for his idiosyncratic 
use of the everyday materials favoured by Italy’s arte povera movement, 
marrying its poetry with politics.

Lonely roads

His best-known work could scarcely be more apt today: its subject is the 
plight of migrants. He created human-scale assemblages using everything from 
rusted bikes to children’s drawings found in their dwellings, conjuring an 
itinerant life where social movement was cruelly mired by deprivation.
