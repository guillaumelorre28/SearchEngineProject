Thanks for joining today’s special edition of Politics Live, but that will do 
us for today. I’ll be back tomorrow with the campaign day, followed by another 
special edition in the evening forMalcolm Turnbull’s solo effort on Q&A

Let’s summarise today.

 * Bill Shorten launched Labor’s campaign in Sydney’s west with a speech that 
was heavy on the themes of unity, of rapprochement with the “true believers”, 
and core Labor values, like education and health care. The Labor leader also 
made an effort to present an alternative tax cut and jobs plan with the 
campaign launch centrepiece, which was a tax break for small companies taking 
on a job seeker, either a young person or a mature aged worker.

 * Before signalling Labor’s pitch to protect Medicare would be a core focus 
over the final fortnight, Shorten also appealed to the party faithful to 
believe the party could win on July 2, and rise up in support of the effort 
over the final stretch of the campaign. “It’s our time, our chance to be more 
than just a face in the crowd, our chance to make this a better country, our 
moment to dig a little deeper, to try a little harder, to be part of something 
bigger than just ourselves,” Shorten told the crowd in Penrith, and the crowd 
watching on at home.

 * Looking on in the audience was Julia Gillard, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, 
but notKevin Rudd, who, sadly, had to zip.

Also, a flu question.

Q: Your voice is a bit croaky today. Are you going to make it to the end?

Malcolm Turnbull:

That is very touching. I’m glad that you’re so concerned. Do you have any flu 
remedies for me? I would be happy to receive some advice.

While we were all preoccupied with the Labor launch the prime minister has 
been out on the hustings. Two questions about Medicare at his press conference.

Q: On the Medicare issue, you have ruled out outsourcing the payments system 
to the private sector. The whole reason for that was the modernise the systems. 
Will it require more spending from the government to upgrade the systems?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Medicare will never ever be privatised. It will never ever be sold. Every 
element of Medicare services that is being delivered by government today, will 
be delivered by government in the future. Full stop. That is the fact. WhatBill 
Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> is doing, is 
peddling an extraordinary lie, so audacious, is defies, it defies belief. This 
is the first time I’ve been asked about this issue by this press pack, and we 
do one of these everyday. You all know it’s nonsense. But Labor has been 
pushing this. They had trade union officials calling up older Australians at 
night, trying to frighten them with a scare campaign. Every single element that 
is delivered by government for Medicare, as part of Medicare, will continue to 
be delivered by government.

Q: The whole idea was the modernise the system. Will you now have to upgrade 
that and how much are you looking to spend on that?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Every delivery system of government has to be upgraded and improved, so that 
people are able to access services on digital platforms. I announced that when 
I was talking about our digital policy just a few days ago. We will continue to 
improve the way that Medicare interfaces with their customers, with citizens, 
and patients, but it also all be done by government and within government. I 
repeat, there will be no outsourcing of any elements of the Medicare service 
that are currently delivered by government. Improvements and efficiencies will 
be undertaken within government. There is no privatisation of Medicare or any 
part of Medicare. Any element of Medicare that is delivered by government will 
be delivered by government. Full stop.

 * Small businesses will be able to claim a tax deduction of up to $20,000 per 
worker to offset the wages of up to five new employees. Businesses will be able 
to claim a 40% deduction on top of the amount they can currently claim for 
their employees.

 * To qualify for the deduction, the employees will need to be a net addition 
to the company’s average full-time equivalent staffing level for the previous 
year. An employer will deduct 140% of the wages expenses of a new employee when 
doing their accounts.

 * Labor’s policy will be targeted to small businesses with turnover of less 
than $2 million which have been operating for more than two years. The tax cut 
will be available to businesses hiring Australians who face real barriers to 
finding work, including:

 * Unemployed jobseekers aged under 25 or over 55, and parents or carers 
returning to work after more than six months away.

Bill Shorten's four key messages

Lenore Taylor

The Labor leader had four key messages for the faithful in western Sydney.
 Opposition leader Bill Shorten acknowledges the crowd with Chloe, Rupert and 
Clementine Shorten after the ALP campaign launch this morning at the Joan 
Sutherland Performing Arts centre in Penrith, Sunday 19th June 2016.

First, to refute the growing idea that the Liberals have this contest won. “Mr 
Turnbull says he’s got this in the bag, he claims he’s already won – I say to 
him – you ain’t seen nothing yet. After three years of opposition and six weeks 
of campaigning we can win and we must win,” he said – to wild applause from the 
audience, including past prime ministers Bob Hawke, Paul Keating andJulia 
Gillard <https://www.theguardian.com/world/julia-gillard>. (Kevin Rudd was in 
Russia. He got an honourable mention, but no applause.)

Second, to attack the $48bn tax cut that is the centrepiece of the Coalition’s 
“jobs and growth” slogan - highlighting the analysis that shows much of the 
benefit will flow overseas andTreasury analysis suggesting its impact on 
economic growth would be around 0.6% of gross national income over decades. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/19/company-tax-cuts-are-not-a-knight-in-shining-armour-to-save-the-economy>


Third, to offer his alternative ideas for job creation. Top of the list was a 
new promise to give small businesses an additional $20,000 a year tax deduction 
for taking on a new employee who is under 25, over 55 or a parent returning to 
employment and parental leave. (The $255m cost comes from money that has not 
been spent in the government’s existing wage subsidy programs.) But the 
economic benefits of delivering the full promised funding for the Gonski 
education and Labor’s version of the national broadband network also got an 
airing.

And Labor’s accusation that the Coalition intends to privatise Medicare (it is 
actually considering outsourcing Medicare’s payment system) is obviously biting 
and set to feature large in the final two weeks, with Shorten declaring the 
election a “referendum on the future of Medicare”.

Shorten’s fourth aim was to try to counter Turnbull’s most potent line of 
attack, that Labor poses a threat to the economy because it would be a “big 
taxing and big spending’ government.

Labor has admitted its deficits over the forward estimates will be higher than 
the Coalition’s, but insists that as its big ticket savings ideas ramp up – for 
example reducing tax concessions fornegative gearing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/18/labor-seizes-on-treasury-advice-that-wealthy-get-most-from-negative-gearing>
 and superannuation – it will be able to deliver a surplus in 2021, the same 
year surplus is being promised by the Coalition. But this promise is going to 
come under heavy scrutiny over the next two weeks when Labor releases its 
detailed costings. “We will not be a big spending government,” Shorten 
insisted, promising Labor would reduce the deficit every year.

How things looked inside the Joan

Gabrielle Chan

I’m here at the “Joan” in Penrith, otherwise known as the Joan Sutherland 
Performing Arts Centre. It is a grey day, brightened only by the sea of red 
Labor volunteer T-shirts. The Labor luminaries walked down the concrete carpet, 
which was lined with corflutes, hiding the construction site next door to Joan.
Security was tight and a lone Nick Xenophon candidate in a sandwich board was 
asked to stand off the concrete.

The theatre is smaller than those used for past campaign launches, which 
provided a little extra energy to the event. The highest cheers began when the 
former PMJulia Gillard entered the room and carried on as Shorten introduced 
“the one and only”Paul Keating and finally Bob Hawke.

Campaign Launch at the Joan Sutherland Performing Arts Centre in Penrith this 
morning, Sunday 19th June 2016. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian 
Chris Bowen, whose seat of McMahon is nearby, got a big cheer and pushed the 
theme of Labor’s policy work - asking for points for eschewing the small target 
policy of past oppositions. He made much of Labor’s frontbench, particularly 
the comparison of deputy prime ministerBarnaby Joyce, when put up against a 
possible future prime ministerTanya Plibersek.

Plibersek herself underlined Labor’s unity and when Shorten finally came on at 
midday, he won a sustained standing ovation. His delivery showed how far he had 
come from the clunky earlier performances as opposition leader. He warmed to 
the task and got louder and more strident - yelling the final lines above the 
crowd. His was an appeal to the volunteers to stay strong in the face of 
mounting evidence that Labor might not reach the 21 seats needed to win 
government.

Thanks for joining today’s special edition of Politics Live, but that will do 
us for today. I’ll be back tomorrow with the campaign day, followed by another 
special edition in the evening forMalcolm Turnbull’s solo effort on Q&A 
tomorrow night.

Let’s summarise today.

in Penrith this morning for the ALP campaign launch, Sunday 19th June 2016. 
Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian 
 * Bill Shorten launched Labor’s campaign in Sydney’s west with a speech that 
was heavy on the themes of unity, of rapprochement with the “true believers”, 
and core Labor values, like education and health care. The Labor leader also 
made an effort to present an alternative tax cut and jobs plan with the 
campaign launch centrepiece, which was a tax break for small companies taking 
on a job seeker, either a young person or a mature aged worker.

 * Before signalling Labor’s pitch to protect Medicare would be a core focus 
over the final fortnight, Shorten also appealed to the party faithful to 
believe the party could win on July 2, and rise up in support of the effort 
over the final stretch of the campaign. “It’s our time, our chance to be more 
than just a face in the crowd, our chance to make this a better country, our 
moment to dig a little deeper, to try a little harder, to be part of something 
bigger than just ourselves,” Shorten told the crowd in Penrith, and the crowd 
watching on at home.

 * Looking on in the audience was Julia Gillard, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, 
but notKevin Rudd, who, sadly, had to zip.

Have a lovely Sunday evening. See you in the morning.

Speaking of video, if you’d like to see how it looked as well as reading the 
rolling report, here’s a short compilation of bits from the Shorten speech.

launch

A short bit of video from Mr Bowers capturing Bill Shorten’s arrival and 
greeting by the former prime ministers.
 Hello Bill.  
I gather the prime minister was at a truck rally, with grandson, Jack.

Sydney Trucks & Machinery Centre in the electorate of Macarthur on June 19, 
2016 in Sydney, Australia. The Prime Minister announced that the $4 million 
saved from abolishing the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal will be diverted to 
the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. Photograph: Pool/Getty Images  
Also, a flu question.

Q: Your voice is a bit croaky today. Are you going to make it to the end?

Malcolm Turnbull:

That is very touching. I’m glad that you’re so concerned. Do you have any flu 
remedies for me? I would be happy to receive some advice.
 
While we were all preoccupied with the Labor launch the prime minister has 
been out on the hustings. Two questions about Medicare at his press conference.

Q: On the Medicare issue, you have ruled out outsourcing the payments system 
to the private sector. The whole reason for that was the modernise the systems. 
Will it require more spending from the government to upgrade the systems?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Medicare will never ever be privatised. It will never ever be sold. Every 
element of Medicare services that is being delivered by government today, will 
be delivered by government in the future. Full stop. That is the fact. WhatBill 
Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> is doing, is 
peddling an extraordinary lie, so audacious, is defies, it defies belief. This 
is the first time I’ve been asked about this issue by this press pack, and we 
do one of these everyday. You all know it’s nonsense. But Labor has been 
pushing this. They had trade union officials calling up older Australians at 
night, trying to frighten them with a scare campaign. Every single element that 
is delivered by government for Medicare, as part of Medicare, will continue to 
be delivered by government.

Q: The whole idea was the modernise the system. Will you now have to upgrade 
that and how much are you looking to spend on that?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Every delivery system of government has to be upgraded and improved, so that 
people are able to access services on digital platforms. I announced that when 
I was talking about our digital policy just a few days ago. We will continue to 
improve the way that Medicare interfaces with their customers, with citizens, 
and patients, but it also all be done by government and within government. I 
repeat, there will be no outsourcing of any elements of the Medicare service 
that are currently delivered by government. Improvements and efficiencies will 
be undertaken within government. There is no privatisation of Medicare or any 
part of Medicare. Any element of Medicare that is delivered by government will 
be delivered by government. Full stop.

In case you weren’t with me from the beginning of the coverage, here are 
details of the jobs initiative whichBill Shorten unveiled during the launch.

 * Small businesses will be able to claim a tax deduction of up to $20,000 per 
worker to offset the wages of up to five new employees. Businesses will be able 
to claim a 40% deduction on top of the amount they can currently claim for 
their employees.

 * To qualify for the deduction, the employees will need to be a net addition 
to the company’s average full-time equivalent staffing level for the previous 
year. An employer will deduct 140% of the wages expenses of a new employee when 
doing their accounts.

 * Labor’s policy will be targeted to small businesses with turnover of less 
than $2 million which have been operating for more than two years. The tax cut 
will be available to businesses hiring Australians who face real barriers to 
finding work, including:

 * Unemployed jobseekers aged under 25 or over 55, and parents or carers 
returning to work after more than six months away.

First, to refute the growing idea that the Liberals have this contest won. “Mr 
Turnbull says he’s got this in the bag, he claims he’s already won – I say to 
him – you ain’t seen nothing yet. After three years of opposition and six weeks 
of campaigning we can win and we must win,” he said – to wild applause from the 
audience, including past prime ministers Bob Hawke, Paul Keating andJulia 
Gillard <https://www.theguardian.com/world/julia-gillard>. (Kevin Rudd was in 
Russia. He got an honourable mention, but no applause.)

Second, to attack the $48bn tax cut that is the centrepiece of the Coalition’s 
“jobs and growth” slogan - highlighting the analysis that shows much of the 
benefit will flow overseas andTreasury analysis suggesting its impact on 
economic growth would be around 0.6% of gross national income over decades.

come under heavy scrutiny over the next two weeks when Labor releases its 
detailed costings. “We will not be a big spending government,” Shorten
