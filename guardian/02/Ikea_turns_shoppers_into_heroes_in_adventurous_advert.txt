Natural Resources Defense Counci: “The Extraordinary Life and Times of 
Strawberry” (Starts at 01:42) – USA

Compellingly filmed, this insight into the life of a strawberry captures your 
attention and doesn’t let go. It moves at such a pace that you don’t really 
know where it’s headed … which makes its message about food waste all the more 
effective.

Com Hem: “Astronaut” (Starts at 03:40) – Sweden

Lou Reed’s ‘Satellite of Love’ proves the perfect musical accompaniment to 
this lovely homage to childish imagination. A young girl pictures herself as an 
astronaut and her fantasy is fully indulged by director Tobias Granström’s 
impressive use of in-camera trickery and VFX.

Ikea: “Wonderful Life” (Starts at 04:44) – UK

We are all involved in our own life adventure according to this charming 
advert for Ikea. While the young couple at the heart of this film have a pretty 
conventional life, in their heads they see themselves as racing drivers and 
champion tennis players … and, in a way, they are. (Though they’re not, 
obviously.)
