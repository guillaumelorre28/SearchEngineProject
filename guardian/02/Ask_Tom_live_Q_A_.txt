This week, Tom will be kicking off his live Q&A with an update on travelling 
to the US, post-Sandy, and also looking at the general strike due to begin 
across Europe on Wednesday 14 November, which is likely to disrupt many flights 
to Greece, Portugal, Spain and the Canary Islands.

He will then move on to answer all the travel queries he can get through in an 
hour. So, whether you already have a destination in mind and need some advice 
about where to stay or what to do there, or are looking for inspiration for an 
affordable break, send us a question by posting a comment below. Tom will be 
online on Wednesday at 1pm (GMT)
