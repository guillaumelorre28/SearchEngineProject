The UK’s energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, says the news shows countries 
are getting serious on climate change ahead of Paris. There’s also some 
bragging about UK role in the EU’s carbon target, though he omits theUK also 
fought efforts to make a related energy-saving binding and to reduce its 
ambition

These climate announcements from the US and China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> are a clear sign that major economies 
are serious about getting a global deal in Paris next year.

The UK led the drive to achieve an ambitious new EU target, and others are now 
following the EU’s lead and putting targets on the table.

I’m looking forward to discussing with the US and China how we can achieve our 
shared goal of keeping the global temperature rise under 2C, and avoid the most 
dangerous effects of climate change.

UN climate chief says US-China deal will help achieve a 'secure future'

The UN’s climate change chief, Christiana Figueres, says that coming on the 
heels of theEU’s promise last month to cut emissions 40% by 2030 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/eu-leaders-agree-to-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-40-by-2030>
, the China-US deal is extremely good news for next year’s Paris climate summit.

These two crucial countries have today announced important pathways towards a 
better and more secure future for humankind. Allied to the European Union’s 
recent announcement, this signals an increasingly positive determination 
towards addressing the climate change challenge from a growing number of key 
economies.

This joint announcement provides both practical and political momentum towards 
a new, universal climate agreement in Paris in late 2015 that is meaningful, 
forward-looking and recognises that combating climate change is not a five or 
ten year plan—but is a long term commitment to keep a global temperature rise 
under 2C throughout this century.

Here’s some more UK reaction. Most commentators thing this is A Big Deal, 
especially in terms of the UN climate summit at Paris at the end of 2015, where 
countries are expected to agree a deal to cut carbon emissions post-2020.

Joss Garman, associate fellow on climate change at the thinktank IPPR, and a 
former aviation campaigner, said:

For decades a wall has separated political action from the scientific 
imperative on climate change. But with one handshake, the leaders ofChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> and the US have breached that wall. 
When the world meets in Paris next year for a landmark UN climate summit, it 
may finally crumble.

Liz Gallagher, climate diplomacy programme leader at thinktank E3G, said:

These two countries shape the global emissions trajectory. Their collaboration 
makes the prospects of a deal in Paris a safe bet. But a G2 agreement won’t get 
us a good enough deal. Paris will be a negotiation, not an array of emissions 
reduction offers. This negotiation will need to include elements such as 
Finance, a long-term target, legal form, transparency and adaptation. Others 
can’t kick back and relax, there is still much work to be done ahead of 
December next year.

The Guardian’s head of environment, Damian Carrington, hails the deal as 
historic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/nov/12/china-us-carbon-deal-a-historic-milestone-in-the-global-fight-against-climate-change>
:


Be in no doubt, the agreement struck by the US and China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> on Wednesday to cut their carbon 
emissions is historic. It is the biggest step towards achieving a meaningful 
global deal to fight climate change in 20 years of tortuous negotiations. But 
also be in no doubt that, while absolutely necessary, it is a long way from 
being sufficient.

...

The significance of the China-US deal is that they have now put their first 
serious offers on the table. In fact they have done so early – the deadline for 
these bids set by the UN was March 2015. The deadline for a final global deal 
is December 2015 in Paris. Until now, it was unclear that deal would be done. 
But the US-China agreement has injected that most precious and rare of 
commodities into global climate negotiations: momentum.

Reuters’ market analyst, by contrast, plays down the significance of today’s 
news 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/12/us-china-usa-climatechange-idUSKCN0IW07Z20141112>
:

The joint statement by the United States and China on climate change, issued 
on Wednesday, is more important for its political and diplomatic symbolism than 
any practical effect it might have in reducing emissions.

The statement reiterates policies China and the United States have been 
developing on their own and contains no new binding limits on greenhouse 
emissions.

...

For China, climate action remains subordinate to the primary goals of economic 
development and political and social stability. The joint statement enshrines 
China’s right to tackle climate change in its own way and at its own pace.

Jennifer Duggan, who is based in Shanghai and blogs for the Guardian at 
China’s Choice <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chinas-choice>, has 
been speaking to Ma Jun, one of China’s most well-known environmentalists and 
director of the NGO the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. He says 
today’s announcement is very important and China’s well-documented 
‘airpocalypses’ caused by coal-burning are part of the motivation:

It is positive for China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> for the 
first time to make a commitment on the peaking of carbon emissions. It is very 
important because the previous commitment was only on carbon intensity.

It will be challenging because China’s energy is very much focused on coal and 
the economy is very focused on heavy industry which is carbon intensive so 
restructuring won’t be easy.

But I think that the momentum generated to solve the local air pollution 
problem is a push for such a commitment. To deal with local pollution, China 
has put on the agenda the capping of coal, which has long been a sensitive 
issue.

I think the recognition that this is not sustainable globally to continue this 
kind of coal consumption and the recognition that the local environment also 
can’t afford it, this combination has helped to push for such a commitment.

It [coal consumption] will still grow quite a lot by 2030 so hopefully with a 
joint effort it could be achived even earlier. I think the momentum generated 
in China is quite major, people want blue sky to come faster than the original 
plan of 20 years.

Here’s what today’s US emissions target and China’s promise to peak emissions 
look like. The US was the world’s biggest emitter untilChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> overtook it in 2008, and as this 
graph shows, even if Chinese emissions peak in 2030, they’re still going to be 
huge.

(The figure for China’s 2030 emissions is taken from a Chinese government 
adviser’s comments earlier this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/03/china-pledges-limit-carbon-emissions>

Greenpeace UK appears to be more encouraged by the deal than its colleagues in 
East Asia.

Executive director John Sauven hailed the announced as a “major political 
breakthrough” that many thought impossible”.

Earlier Greenpeace’s East Asia’s senior climate and energy campaigner, Li 
Shuo, also welcomed the deal but said itfell short of a game changer and called 
for more ambitious targets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/nov/12/united-states-and-china-reach-landmark-carbon-emissions-deal-live#block-5462e9f3e4b0bdf901692611>
.

Sauven appeared more encouraged, and urged the UK government to do more. 


The targets announced are not yet as ambitious as scientists say they should 
be if we are to stop the worst ravages of climate change, but this a solid 
foundation stone for world leaders to build on. The EU should now lead the 
charge for greater ambition, building on its historical leadership and in the 
interests of its own clean tech sector.

For the UK government, this should be a wake-up call. The global race to a 
clean energy future and its huge rewards is on, and it won’t be won by 
pandering to the fossil fuel lobby and a minority of anti-wind and anti-solar 
Tory backbenchers.Slashing support for wind and solar isn’t just bad for the 
climate, it’s bad for Britain’s economy and our place in the world.

Here’s a summary of the main points of the deal and the reaction to it:

 * The US and China have unveiled a secretly negotiated deal to reduce their 
greenhouse gas output, with China agreeing to cap emissions for the first time 
and the US committing to deep reductions by 2025. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/12/china-and-us-make-carbon-pledge>
Barack Obama said the deal was an “historic agreement”. China’s premier, Xi 
Jinping, said the US and China had agreed to make sure a global climate deal is 
reached in Paris next year. 
 * Under the deal the US committed to a cut in carbon emissions of between 26% 
and 28% on 2005 levels by 2020. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/nov/12/united-states-and-china-reach-landmark-carbon-emissions-deal-live#block-5462fecce4b0058909044d71>
 This represents an an acceleration of its existing goal to reduce emissions 
17%. 
 * China said it “intends” to start cutting carbon emissions in 2030 and make 
“best efforts” to peak emissions before 2030. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/nov/12/united-states-and-china-reach-landmark-carbon-emissions-deal-live#block-5462e90fe4b0c6f7ffe34b44>
It also agreed to increase the share of non-fossil fuels energy consumption to 
around 20% by 2030.

 * The newly elected Republican dominated Congress in the US has threatened to 
undermine the agreement. 
<http://news.yahoo.com/us-republican-leader-says-climate-target-agreement-unrealistic-050314597.html>
The US Senate’s Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said the plan was 
“unrealistic”. 
 * Analysts have pointed out that Beijing’s commitments lack ambition.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/nov/12/united-states-and-china-reach-landmark-carbon-emissions-deal-live#block-54630f99e4b0c6f7ffe34b54>
Some have claimed that China was already on course to produce a fifth of its 
energy from renewable sources by 2020 and that its carbon emissions were 
already expected to peak in 2030. 
 * The UN has welcomed the deal claiming it increases the chances of a 
meaningful global deal in Paris next year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/nov/12/united-states-and-china-reach-landmark-carbon-emissions-deal-live#block-54631e0ae4b04484e857936b>
. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon urged other countries to make ambitionous 
climate commitments.

Vox has a useful explainer on the importance of the deal 
<http://www.vox.com/2014/11/11/7200909/US-china-climate-deal-cutting-emissions> 
and the questions that remain about it.

The agreement falls far short of solving climate change, it says, but it does 
suggests an end a diplomatic standoff on climate negotiations.


This deal is a step away from the long-standing deadlock 
<http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/in-joint-steps-on-emissions-china-and-u-s-set-aside-you-first-approach-on-global-warming/>
 between the two nations on climate. Many US politicianshave long argued 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD_6DNS_UA&feature=youtu.be&t=16s> against 
cutting greenhouse-gas emission on the grounds that China would never act — so 
what was the point? And China, for its part, has long insisted that rich 
countries should cut their own emissions and give developing countries like 
China time to grow. With this deal, the two countries are beginning to 
cooperate rather than play an endless game of chicken.

For all the wiggle room in the language of the deal, it could prove a 
“watershed” moment, according to climate change analyst Ben Adler.

Writing on the US environment blog Grist, he says: 


The US and China are the world’s two biggest economies, and showing that they 
will play their part in reducing emissions is essential to getting an 
international agreement 
<http://grist.org/climate-energy/will-obamas-power-plant-rules-lead-to-an-international-climate-agreement/>
 at the next round of big climate negotiations in Paris in December 2015. Now 
the prospects are looking a lot better.

Adler also responds to those who point out that the US is making a bigger 
commitment than China. 
<http://www.theage.com.au/environment/climate-change/ross-garnaut-climate-deal-marks-acceleration-by-us-20141112-11l898.html>

Thanks to our longstanding development and wealth, the U.S. has produced 
<http://pdf.wri.org/navigating_numbers_chapter6.pdf> 29.3 percent of global 
cumulative carbon emissions, while China has been responsible for only 7.6 
percent. What China is planning — starting on a path of renewable development, 
so that it can transition from fossil fuels as quickly as possible without 
damaging economic growth — lays out a model for emerging economies such as 
India, Brazil, and Indonesia to follow.

Likewise, the U.S. is sending a message to those countries, and to the 
pro–fossil fuelgovernments 
<http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119896/canada-australias-climate-change-record-leaders-deniers>
 in Canada and Australia, that we are serious about putting climate at the

We welcome today's US-China #climate

The UK’s energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, says the news shows countries 
are getting serious on climate change ahead of Paris. There’s also some 
bragging about UK role in the EU’s carbon target, though he omits theUK also 
fought efforts to make a related energy-saving binding and to reduce its 
ambition

These climate announcements from the US and China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> are a clear sign that major economies 
are serious about getting a global deal in Paris next year.

The UK led the drive to achieve an ambitious new EU target, and others are now 
following the EU’s lead and putting targets on the table.

I’m looking forward to discussing with the US and China how we can achieve our 
shared goal of keeping the global temperature rise under 2C, and avoid the most 
dangerous effects of climate change.
 
The UN’s climate change chief, Christiana Figueres, says that coming on the 
heels of theEU’s promise last month to cut emissions 40% by 2030 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/eu-leaders-agree-to-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-40-by-2030>
, the China-US deal is extremely good news for next year’s Paris climate summit.

These two crucial countries have today announced important pathways towards a 
better and more secure future for humankind. Allied to the European Union’s 
recent announcement, this signals an increasingly positive determination 
towards addressing the climate change challenge from a growing number of key 
economies.

This joint announcement provides both practical and political momentum towards 
a new, universal climate agreement in Paris in late 2015 that is meaningful, 
forward-looking and recognises that combating climate change is not a five or 
ten year plan—but is a long term commitment to keep a global temperature rise 
under 2C throughout this century.

Here’s Figueres on film when I interviewed her earlier this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/05/extreme-weather-climate-change-political-christiana-figueres-un>
:
 Christian Figueres on extreme weather and climate change.  
Here’s some more UK reaction. Most commentators thing this is A Big Deal, 
especially in terms of the UN climate summit at Paris at the end of 2015, where 
countries are expected to agree a deal to cut carbon emissions post-2020.

Joss Garman, associate fellow on climate change at the thinktank IPPR, and a 
former aviation campaigner, said:

For decades a wall has separated political action from the scientific 
imperative on climate change. But with one handshake, the leaders ofChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> and the US have breached that wall. 
When the world meets in Paris next year for a landmark UN climate summit, it 
may finally crumble.

Liz Gallagher, climate diplomacy programme leader at thinktank E3G, said:

These two countries shape the global emissions trajectory. Their collaboration 
makes the prospects of a deal in Paris a safe bet. But a G2 agreement won’t get 
us a good enough deal. Paris will be a negotiation, not an array of emissions 
reduction offers. This negotiation will need to include elements such as 
Finance, a long-term target, legal form, transparency and adaptation. Others 
can’t kick back and relax, there is still much work to be done ahead of 
December next year.
 
The Guardian’s head of environment, Damian Carrington, hails the deal as 
historic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/nov/12/china-us-carbon-deal-a-historic-milestone-in-the-global-fight-against-climate-change>
:


Be in no doubt, the agreement struck by the US and China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> on Wednesday to cut their carbon 
emissions is historic. It is the biggest step towards achieving a meaningful 
global deal to fight climate change in 20 years of tortuous negotiations. But 
also be in no doubt that, while absolutely necessary, it is a long way from 
being sufficient.

...

The significance of the China-US deal is that they have now put their first 
serious offers on the table. In fact they have done so early – the deadline for 
these bids set by the UN was March 2015. The deadline for a final global deal 
is December 2015 in Paris. Until now, it was unclear that deal would be done. 
But the US-China agreement has injected that most precious and rare of 
commodities into global climate negotiations: momentum.

Reuters’ market analyst, by contrast, plays down the significance of today’s 
news 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/12/us-china-usa-climatechange-idUSKCN0IW07Z20141112>
:

The joint statement by the United States and China on climate change, issued 
on Wednesday, is more important for its political and diplomatic symbolism than 
any practical effect it might have in reducing emissions.

The statement reiterates policies China and the United States have been 
developing on their own and contains no new binding limits on greenhouse 
emissions.

...

For China, climate action remains subordinate to the primary goals of economic 
development and political and social stability. The joint statement enshrines 
China’s right to tackle climate change in its own way and at its own pace.
 
Jennifer Duggan, who is based in Shanghai and blogs for the Guardian at 
China’s Choice <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chinas-choice>, has 
been speaking to Ma Jun, one of China’s most well-known environmentalists and 
director of the NGO the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. He says 
today’s announcement is very important and China’s well-documented 
‘airpocalypses’ caused by coal-burning are part of the motivation:

It is positive for China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> for the 
first time to make a commitment on the peaking of carbon emissions. It is very 
important because the previous commitment was only on carbon intensity.

It will be challenging because China’s energy is very much focused on coal and 
the economy is very focused on heavy industry which is carbon intensive so 
restructuring won’t be easy.

But I think that the momentum generated to solve the local air pollution 
problem is a push for such a commitment. To deal with local pollution, China 
has put on the agenda the capping of coal, which has long been a sensitive 
issue.

I think the recognition that this is not sustainable globally to continue this 
kind of coal consumption and the recognition that the local environment also 
can’t afford it, this combination has helped to push for such a commitment.

It [coal consumption] will still grow quite a lot by 2030 so hopefully with a 
joint effort it could be achived even earlier. I think the momentum generated 
in China is quite major, people want blue sky to come faster than the original 
plan of 20 years.

<mailto:adam.vaughan@theguardian.com>. 

Here’s what today’s US emissions target and China’s promise to peak emissions 
look like. The US was the world’s biggest emitter untilChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> overtook it in 2008, and as this 
graph shows, even if Chinese emissions peak in 2030, they’re still going to be 
huge.

(The figure for China’s 2030 emissions is taken from a Chinese government 
adviser’s comments earlier this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/03/china-pledges-limit-carbon-emissions>
).

Greenpeace UK appears to be more encouraged by the deal than its colleagues in 
East Asia.

Executive director John Sauven hailed the announced as a “major political 
breakthrough” that many thought impossible”.

Earlier Greenpeace’s East Asia’s senior climate and energy campaigner, Li 
Shuo, also welcomed the deal but said itfell short of a game changer and called 
for more ambitious targets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/nov/12/united-states-and-china-reach-landmark-carbon-emissions-deal-live#block-5462e9f3e4b0bdf901692611>
.

Sauven appeared more encouraged, and urged the UK government to do more. 


The targets announced are not yet as ambitious as scientists say they should 
be if we are to stop the worst ravages of climate change, but this a solid 
foundation stone for world leaders to build on. The EU should now lead the 
charge for greater ambition, building on its historical leadership and in the 
interests of its own clean tech sector.

For the UK government, this should be a wake-up call. The global race to a 
clean energy future and its huge rewards is on, and it won’t be won by 
pandering to the fossil fuel lobby and a minority of anti-wind and anti-solar 
Tory backbenchers.Slashing support for wind and solar isn’t just bad for the 
climate, it’s bad for Britain’s economy and our place in the world.
 
Here’s a summary of the main points of the deal and the reaction to it:

 * The US and China have unveiled a secretly negotiated deal to reduce their 
greenhouse gas output, with China agreeing to cap emissions for the first time 
and the US committing to deep reductions by 2025. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/12/china-and-us-make-carbon-pledge>
Barack Obama said the deal was an “historic agreement”. China’s premier, Xi 
Jinping, said the US and China had agreed to make sure a global climate deal is 
reached in Paris next year. 
 * Under the deal the US committed to a cut in carbon emissions of between 26% 
and 28% on 2005 levels by 2020. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/nov/12/united-states-and-china-reach-landmark-carbon-emissions-deal-live#block-5462fecce4b0058909044d71>
 This represents an an acceleration of its existing goal to reduce emissions 
17%. 
 * China said it “intends” to start cutting carbon emissions in 2030 and make 
“best efforts” to peak emissions before 2030.

It also agreed to increase the share of non-fossil fuels energy consumption to 
around 20% by 2030.

 * The newly elected Republican dominated Congress in the US has threatened to 
undermine the agreement. 
<http://news.yahoo.com/us-republican-leader-says-climate-target-agreement-unrealistic-050314597.html>
The US Senate’s Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said the plan was 
“unrealistic”. 
 * Analysts have pointed out that Beijing’s commitments lack ambition.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/nov/12/united-states-and-china-reach-landmark-carbon-emissions-deal-live#block-54630f99e4b0c6f7ffe34b54>
Some have claimed that China was already on course to produce a fifth of its 
energy from renewable sources by 2020 and that its carbon emissions were 
already expected to peak in 2030. 
 * The UN has welcomed the deal claiming it increases the chances of a 
meaningful global deal in Paris next year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/nov/12/united-states-and-china-reach-landmark-carbon-emissions-deal-live#block-54631e0ae4b04484e857936b>

climate commitments.

Vox has a useful explainer on the importance of the deal 
<http://www.vox.com/2014/11/11/7200909/US-china-climate-deal-cutting-emissions> 
and the questions that remain about it.

The agreement falls far short of solving climate change, it says, but it does 
suggests an end a diplomatic standoff on climate negotiations.


This deal is a step away from the long-standing deadlock 
<http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/in-joint-steps-on-emissions-china-and-u-s-set-aside-you-first-approach-on-global-warming/>
 between the two nations on climate. Many US politicianshave long argued 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyD_6DNS_UA&feature=youtu.be&t=16s> against 
cutting greenhouse-gas emission on the grounds that China would never act — so 
what was the point? And China, for its part, has long insisted that rich 
countries should cut their own emissions and give developing countries like 
China time to grow. With this deal, the two countries are beginning to 
cooperate rather than play an endless game of chicken.

“watershed” moment, according to climate change analyst Ben Adler.
