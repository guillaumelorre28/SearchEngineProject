James Blunt squared up to Chris Bryant. On paper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/19/james-blunts-letter-chris-bryant-in-full>

What a world we live in. Monday began as normal, perhaps with stereotypical 
grumbling about another week, and quickly descended into a class-based 
open-letter tiff on privilege between a formerly floppy-haired 
singer-songwriter and amember of parliament 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/19/chris-bryant-letter-james-blunt-in-full?CMP=share_btn_tw>
, the shadow culture minister. Let us always remember this as the week when 
James Blunt publicly, and unashamedly, used the work wazzock.

Björk dominated our news coverage, repeatedly

Last week, the Icelandic musician announced details of new album Vulnicura. 
Days later sherush-released the recordiing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/20/bjork-rush-releases-new-album-vulnicura-after-online-leak>
, spoke tearfully and honestly to Pitchforkabout gender and heartbreak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/22/bjork-gender-feminism-vulnicura-pitchfork-interview>
, and inspired us to publish not one, but two, album reviews. Oh, and let’s not 
forget thepicture gallery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/jan/22/bjorks-album-artwork-in-pictures-vulnicura-biophilia>
 of her past album artwork. Yes, we got a bit carried away and no, we will not 
apologise for it.

A$AP Yams, of rap’s A$AP Mob, left behind a legacy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/19/asap-yams-asap-mob-asap-rocky-new-york-rap>

Yams, born Steven Rodriguez, died at 26 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/18/asap-yams-dies-aged-26> last 
weekend. For fans of New York’s A$AP Mob, a collective of rappers and producers 
that counts A$AP Rocky and A$AP Ferg among its ranks, the news was devastating. 
For fans of hip-hop and Rodriguez’s extensive catalogue of music knowledge 
shared on his old Tumblr blog, it represented the loss of one of the genre’s 
rising talents.

Pharrell and Al Gore threatened to enable global harmony 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/21/pharrell-williams-announces-live-earth-2015-davos>

Pharrell Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/music/pharrellwilliams> and 
Gore took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, announcing Live 
Earth 2015. By the sound of it, there are going to be people performing and 
singing on all seven continents at the same time, to remind us of the sanctity 
of Earth and the brutality of time zones. “We literally are going to have 
humanity harmonise all at once.” OK Pharrell, we’ll take your word for it.

Disclosure are not even a little bit interested in being sued 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/21/disclosure-stolen-lyric-allegations-are-completely-false>

The pop-house sibling duo are reportedly being sued by a singer-songwriter who 
claims they repurposed her song lyrics in hits featuring industry darling Sam 
Smith and duo AlunaGeorge. And, inhale. The Lawrence brothers logged into 
Facebook to dispel the rumours and slip in a quick mention of their forthcoming 
album. As you were, I suppose.

TLC are crowdfunding their final album on Kickstarter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/20/tlc-announce-return-kickstarter-funded-album>


And somehow this news feels very depressing – let Lindsey Weber of New York 
magazine’spop culture site Vulture 
<http://www.vulture.com/2015/01/oh-no-tlc-is-kickstarting-their-final-album.html>
 explain more on that. On Monday 19 January the R&B, rap-tinged girl group 
announced their search for $150,000 (£100,000) to make their fifth and final 
album. Fun fact: within the campaign’s first hour or so online, one of the 
first bidders had opted for a $7,500 photoshoot with group members T-Boz and 
Chilli. The more you know.

Kanye’s childhood poem about Martin Luther King, Jr surfaced

Kanye West <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest>, now known to his 
fans as a god and to his detractors as that self-proclaimed genius who won’t be 
quiet, was already on the mic as a child. On Tuesday his wife, internet-breaker 
Kim Kardashian West, tweeted a school video in which a pint-sized Kanye 
dedicated a poem to civil-rights hero Martin Luther King Jr. To be fair, he 
even spat fire all that time ago.

The Sonics began phase one of their comeback 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/22/the-sonics-to-release-first-album-of-new-material-since-1967>

Guys, it only took almost 50 years but garage rockers the Sonics are back with 
new material. Ignore the sceptics who claim one can’t leap around on stage in 
their late 60s or early 70s. The Guardian’s online music editor Tim Jonzeasked 
the hard question 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jan/22/has-anyone-ever-taken-longer-than-the-sonics-to-release-a-new-album>
 that you didn’t have to: has anyone in the history of humanity ever taken this 
long to write new songs?

David Byrne’s famous friends are going to perform with teenagers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/22/david-byrne-colour-guard-show-kelis-st-vincent-contemporary-color>

Byrne’s latest project might not make much sense to his fans: he’s combining 
music performances with “colour guard” routines this summer. Colour guard 
essentially looks like a lot of flag-waving and spinning set to song, and is 
favoured by small-town American high-school troupes. But they’ve hit the big 
time now, in gigs featuring Kelis, St Vincent and others. This is what 
non-Byrne-related colour guard looks like:

A video editor partially edited Sia’s face with a bunch of bananas

The Australian singer and songwriter is famous (perhaps paradoxically) for 
limiting images of her face in the promotion of her music, but this just feels 
silly. Earlier this weeka dance community’s <http://danceon.com/> YouTube 
channel published a video, going behind-the-scenes on the shoot of Sia’s
controversial Elastic Heart video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/08/sia-apologises-to-those-who-feel-triggered-by-provocative-elastic-heart-video>
 with paper bag-wearer Shia LaBeouf and dancing child Maddie Ziegler. As well 
as a glut of platitudes on “energy levels and dynamics”, catharsis and 
“auxiliary arts stuff” the video features a clip art-style bunch of bananas 
hovering over Sia’s face in several shots. Enjoy.

• This article was amended on 30 January 2015. An earlier version of the item 
on TLC said it was the first and only bidder, rather than one of the first, who 
had opted for a $7,500 photoshoot with T-Boz and Chilli.
