Split Decision 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dennis.splitdecision>

source: magazine firm Dennis Publishing, of The Week, Viz and MacUser fame. 
This isn't about magazines though: it's a "nonsense vs knowledge" trivia game, 
asking you to assign things to their correct category – for example, is Breathe 
On Me a Sylvia Plath poem or a Britney Spears song? It's based on an existing 
board game, with new question packs sold in-app. The link above is for Android,

launch one a week – is EA's Roll In The Hole. It's a 72-level puzzle game
