Last night neighbourhood policing teams from across Cardiff tried a new 
experiment to increase public awareness of their foot patrols.

Teams in Adamsdown <https://www.theguardian.com/cardiff/adamsdown>, Roath, 
Tremorfa and Splott used social networking site Twitter to send out realtime 
messages about what they were up to on the streets.

Using the hashtag #heddluestreet  
<http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23heddluestreet>PCSOs and officers sent 
live updates from 5pm-7.30pm, posting using the@swpolice 
<http://twitter.com/swpolice> account. 

Police said the hashtag was chosen as 'heddlu' is the welsh word for police, 
'e' represents the online aspect, and 'street' is what the work of 
neighbourhood policing is all about.

Following the experiment, police said it had been a success. Splott

Neate said:

"The twitter trial went well last night, it provided people with a different 
way of communicating with us, finding out about local priorities, and kept them 
informed about our street patrols.

"Social media use is growing rapidly and it provides a real opportunity for 
policing to engage with our communities, and have a two way conversation."


 The team also felt the online tool could be used for maintaining face-to-face 
contact. PCSO Frances Richards said:

"We even received a message asking where I was patrolling, and this is 
brilliant because the community can find me quickly to discuss issues and get 
crime prevention advice."

We gathered some of their tweets and resident responses in this storify:
