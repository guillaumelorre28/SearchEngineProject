I posted a piece on Friday  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2011/jul/01/simon-kelner-theindependent>
looking back at Simon Kelner's 13 years at the helm of The Independent.

To date, it has generated only three public comments, one critical of Kelner's 
poster-style front pages, another calling him "a great editor" but complaining 
about his egotism and a third taking me to task for not giving him due credit 
for his paper's opposition to the invasion of Iraq.

Privately, I received several calls. One pointed out that there was a long 
list of friends with whom Kelner had fallen out and I should have listed them. 
(I'll come back to that).

But there were two calls from journalists I know well who said I had not 
properly reflected Kelner's good points, particularly his cleverness at keeping 
the Indy afloat when it could so easily have gone under.

A similar point was made by Peter Preston in The Observer 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/03/independent-simon-kelner-alexander-lebedev-comment>
. He wrote that without "bustling, dynamic" Kelner guiding the paper through 
"the traumas of Tony O'Reilly... in all probability, there'd be nothing left to 
cheer for."

Furthermore, an email arrived from another journalist friend, now an academic, 
who was upset that I had failed to be as positive about Kelner as I should have 
been. He echoed one of the callers who had said: "You damned him with faint 
praise."

I did believe that I had been fair, but those calls, the email message and 
Preston's generous comment have given me pause for thought. I need therefore to 
give Kelner his due.

Let me place on record my admiration for what Kelner achieved, especially 
throughout the O'Reilly years of ownership, in which money was always in short 
supply.

It was tough to maintain a sense of mission during the lengthy Independent 
News & Media stand-off between Tony andGavin O'Reilly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/gavin-o-reilly> on one side and the 
dissident shareholder, Denis O'Brien, on the other, with the latter 
persistently calling for the disposal of the Indy.

Though I mentioned it in the last posting, the boldness of turning the paper 
into a compact and the way Kelner carried it out did make a huge impact across 
the whole industry (and around the world).

His front pages advocating a point of view did set his paper apart from the 
rest of the quality titles. It certainly made the paper's agenda transparent.

And, yes, I do think the paper's consistent stand against the war on Iraq is 
worthy of praise. Principle was yoked to passion, and that is to Kelner's 
credit.

Indeed, it is Kelner's journalistic passion that I didn't convey in my 
original posting. He truly loves newspapers. The ink is in his veins.

One caller said: "You have to hand it to him - he's held that paper together 
by the force of his will. Call it ego if you must, but it worked."

That view was balanced by a caller who thought Kelner too willing to sacrifice 
his friends. Aside fromRoger Alton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/rogeralton>, whom I referred to, he 
mentioned Kim Fletcher, Tristan Davies and Ian Birrell as victims of Kelner's 
self-centred approach. However, fences have been mended in most of those cases 
and friendships renewed.

Finally, an emailer urged me to point out that Kelner is a unique editor - at 
the serious end of the press - in not having gone to university. After taking 
his A-levels at Bury grammar school, he went to Lancashire Polytechnic [now the
University of Central Lancashire <http://www.uclan.ac.uk/>] to study journalism.

In one sense, you might call him the last of a breed because it is unlikely to 
happen again. On the other hand, it didn't happen too often in the past (some 
examples: Harry Evans of theSunday Times 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/sundaytimes> and Times; Charlie Wilson of 
The Times; and, surprisingly, Charlie Douglas-Home of The Times).

Then again, that throws up a couple of questions: does the lack of a 
university degree make any difference to a journalist's fortunes?

And, in Kelner's specific case, surely going to a polytechnic is very 
different from starting out as a 14-year-old copy boy, as Wilson did, or 
stepping straight from school on to a paper as Evans did, aged 16, (and I did, 
aged 17)?

Anyway, Kelner has university status now: he is a fellow at Uclan and his 
picture is on the boardroom wall.
