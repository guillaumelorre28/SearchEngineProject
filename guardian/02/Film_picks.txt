Breaking and Entering 
1.45pm, Sky Movies Indie 
(Anthony Minghella, 2006) 

After the grand visions of The English Patient and Cold Mountain, a more 
parochial drama from Minghella. Jude Law's married, north London landscape 
architect begins an affair with a Bosnian emigre (Juliette Binoche) whose son 
has burgled his office; it makes for an entertaining tale of cross-cultural 
life, without greatly engaging the emotions.

The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance 
4.55pm, Film4
(John Ford, 1962) 

This key Ford western introduces a late note of cynicism to his romantic 
vision. It's about how idealistic lawyer James Stewart brings law and literacy 
to the town of Shinbone, his confrontation with the villain of the title (Lee 
Marvin), rancher John Wayne's part in it, and how the truth gets lost: "When 
the legend becomes fact, print the legend."

Interview With the Vampire 
9pm, BBC3
(Neil Jordan, 1994) 

A seductive adaptation of Anne Rice's cult novel in which a vampire offers a 
San Francisco hack a bite-and-tell scoop to die for: an account of 200 years of 
necking. With Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst as the bloodsuckers, it's 
not short on charm, but lacks the visceral energy of Jordan's earlier 
fang-tasy, The Company 0f Wolves.
