American Ballet Theatre's season at Sadler's Wells broke one very significant 
box office record: top ticket prices of £70, the highest the theatre has ever 
charged for non-fundraising performances.

Director Alistair Spalding says that the Wells' policy is primarily to "keep 
prices affordable" but believes that "occasionally we need something at the 
glamorous end of things". Only a week before, the theatre'sSampled Weekend 
<http://www.playstationseason.com/feature_sadlers.php>, with tickets pitched 
between £5 and £10, attracted a uniquely young public, some of them first-time 
dance goers. It was a brilliant coup for Spalding. But does it matter that for 
ABT's season, the average age of the audience went up in almost direct 
proportion with the ticket prices?

There is a good argument for the Wells spreading its remit and opening its 
doors to as wide a variety of dance as it can. Someone needed to give stage 
room to ABT, since neither Covent Garden nor the Coliseum have been able to 
present the company during the last 17 years. There is also a good argument for 
the Wells mixing up its repertory and attracting a wider range of punters - 
some of the ballet purists who came to ABT might in future come back to try 
some more challenging or contemporary performances. But there also may be a 
danger of such a policy rebounding. If theatre's image gets too glamorous, and 
too pricey, will the younger punters, whom the Wells are doing so much too 
attract, simply be frightened away?
