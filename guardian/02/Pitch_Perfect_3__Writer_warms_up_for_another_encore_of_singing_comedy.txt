The Pitch Perfect films centre on Beca (Anna Kendrick), a cynical college 
student who is gradually seduced by the dorky pleasures of a cappella pop 
singing. Neither Kendrick, nor her co-star Rebel Wilson, who plays the Bellas’ 
powerhouse soloist, Fat Amy, has confirmed that they will return for a third 
film, but Kendrick has previously tweeted a suggestion as to where the story 
could go.

Hailee Steinfeld, who made her Pitch Perfect debut in the most recent film, 
will definitely be involved. Pre-empting the sequel’s success, the studio made 
sure that she was contracted for a follow-up prior to her appearance as 
freshman Emily Junk inPitch Perfect 2
