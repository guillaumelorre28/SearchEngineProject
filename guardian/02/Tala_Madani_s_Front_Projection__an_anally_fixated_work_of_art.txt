Dancing in the dark

In Tala Madani’s painting, a cartoonish naked man stands with his back to us. 
Before him is a black void, illuminated by the glowing outline of prancing 
deer. Depicted in the red and green of cheap 3D glasses, they hang in the air 
like neon cave art.

Man emission

The painting is ruder than it sounds, though. It’s from the Iranian artist 
latest series where light and imagery shoots from the bums and willies of her 
signature balding little men. Colourful spotlights are blasted around like 
lasers. Men do curly poos and make abstract art. Sometimes, it’s hard to tell 
the two apart. And art history is in the mix, from cave painting to 3D film.

Ordure ordure

All of this feels very “Freud’s anal stage”. The middle-aged men who play with 
their faeces (and in her previous paintings have followed their impulses to 
more extreme ends) are returning to infanthood.

Reality check

Madani draws a line between image-making’s origins in base matter and its most 
sophisticated manifestations today, in the form of photography and film’s 
so-called “painting with light” and now 3D, a medium whose fantastic stories 
avoid reality as much as replicate it.
