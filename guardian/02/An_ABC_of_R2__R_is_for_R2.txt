Today R, for R2... which people often think stood for the fact that we were 
building "revision 2" or "release 2" of theguardian.com. It didn't stand for 
that, not least because this is actually the third or fourth such revision 
since we launched in 1999. In fact, it stood for "rebuild and redesign".

However, while plans for the project were still being hatched, and for just a 
very short time, it had another name. We were just finishing a day planning the 
project's priorities and were aware that when The Guardian newspaper changed to 
its Berliner format the transformation was called internallyProject Kennedy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/11/theguardian.pressandpublishing>. 
With slightly too much levity at the end of a long day in single room we chose 
another 60s icon to provide the name for this project. At the time it seemed 
like a jolly good idea.

Next morning the cold, fluorescent office light of reality hit: no-one wanted 
to go in front of the board and ask for a large amount of money for something 
calledthat. After a flurry of e-mail Mina came up with R2, and everyone liked 
that -- it was neutral and serious.

So R2 it was, and remained.
