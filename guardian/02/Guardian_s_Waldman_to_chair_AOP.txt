The UK Association of Online Publishers <https://www.theguardian.com/media/aop>
 has appointed Simon Waldman, the group director of digital strategy and 
development for Guardian Media Group, as its new chairman.

Mr Waldman takes over from Bill Murray, the managing director of group 
business information strategy for Haymarket Publishing, who has chaired AOP 
since its creation in July 2002.

He will chair the AOP for two years, with the fifth AOP online publishing 
conference, taking place on October 4, marking the official handover point.

The AOP has also released the shortlist for its annual awards.

This year's awards attracted a record number of entries - more than 230.

Of those, 108 have been shortlisted from 46 companies for awards across 14 
categories.

The Guardian <https://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian> has had 12 
entries shortlisted, the most of any member, followed by Emap on 11.

The AOP said that this year's awards reflected the rise in user-generated 
content over the past 12 months and that publishers had moved to embrace the 
trend.

The Guardian's Comment is free blog was shortlisted in three categories.

BBC.co.uk/radio1, Guardian.co.uk, NewScientist.com, NME.com, 
Reuters.co.uk/worldcup, RunnersWorld.co.uk, Soundjunction.org, TopGear.com and 
WSJ.com will compete for the top prize of consumer web site of the year.

The awards will be held on October 4 at the London Hilton on Park Lane.
