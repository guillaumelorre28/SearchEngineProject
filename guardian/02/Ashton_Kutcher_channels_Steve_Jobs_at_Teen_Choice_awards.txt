Ashton Kutcher <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ashton-kutcher> stunned his 
young audience at the Teen Choice awards on Sunday night by offering a stream 
of "insider secrets" from the podium inspired in part by Steve Jobs, the Apple 
co-founder who Kutcher has recently portrayed on film.

There to receive the Ultimate Choice award, Kutcher decided to use his status 
as a tech pioneer and investment guru to impart some worldly advice. First he 
revealed felt like a "fraud", and that until he was 19 he was known by his 
first name, Chris. But then he launched into an extraordinary life primer 
compressed into a few minutes.

First he listed his pre-acting jobs, including sweeping a factory floor, 
saying "I believe that opportunity looks like hard work". "Every job I had was 
a stepping stone to the next one, and I never quit a job before I had the next 
one."

Then he turned to "sexiness". "The sexiest thing in the entire world is being 
really smart. And being thoughtful. And being generous. Everything else is 
crap! … It's just crap people try to sell to you to make you feel less."

And finally, citing Jobs <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jobs> as a specific 
inspiration, he told his screaming audience that "everything around us that we 
call life was made up people who were no smarter than you… so build a life, 
don't live one. Build one. Find your opportunities and always be sexy."

No doubt Kutcher was spurred on by the fact that, at 35, he is likely to have 
less influence over young people in the immediate future . After all, he 
referred to his appearance as the "old guy award… after this I go to the 
geriatric home."
