The big story
 Time flies … Harry Potter then and now 
It was all about Harry Potter this week; from the UK premiere 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/gallery/2010/nov/11/harry-potter-deathly-hallows-premiere>
 to thefirst official review 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/nov/11/harry-potter-deathy-hallows-review>
. Even David Cameron went a little Potty, urging UK film-makers to try and 
emulate the boy wizard's lucractive formula (if they wanted to benefit from 
state funding). Many of you were appalled by the Prime Minister'sstatement on 
Wednesday that British films should aim to make money and lure tourists to our 
country 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/nov/17/david-cameron-harry-potter-funding>
; others thought he had a point; a few were amused. Earlier today, Stuart 
Heritage imagined a world in which Cameron's vision had come to fruition 
(readers with a Danny Dyer allergyshouldn't click this link 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/nov/18/david-cameron-british-film-ideas?intcmp=239>
). In other Harry Potter-related news this week; studios on both sides of the 
pond dealt with the consequences of being too frightened to release much in the 
run-up (here'sCharles Gant's UK box office analysis 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/nov/16/skyline-harry-potter-box-office>
, and here's Jeremy Kay's Hollywood Report 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/nov/15/megamind-fox-unstoppable-dreamworks>
).

Plus, Warner came down hard on the leak of 36 minutes online 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/nov/11/harry-potter-deathy-hallows-review>
, and Helena Bonham Carterrevealed to us that she doesn't want to be remembered 
as a sado-masochistic witch

.

The big story half a century ago
 Take cover … Michael Powell on set 
Was the critics' damning of Michael Powell's Peeping Tom, which led to the 
film going underground and Powell not really working again, until Martin 
Scorsese rehabilitated his image in the late 70s.John Patterson ran us through 
the history 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/nov/13/peeping-tom-john-patterson?intcmp=239>
;Peter Bradshaw had his own take on why the critics got so hot under the collar 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/nov/16/peeping-tom-pornography-press-camera>
, and we hada gallery of behind-the-scenes photos
