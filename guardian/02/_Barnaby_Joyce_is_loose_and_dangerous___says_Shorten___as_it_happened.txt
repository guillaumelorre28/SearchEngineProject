So long

The multi-tasking is now getting mildly dysfunctional so I’ll fold the 
Politics Live tent for today and trot off to record this week’s episode of our 
campaign podcast. Thanks to Mel and thanks to the readers for your company. 
Most marvellous.

Shall we summarise?

Today, Thursday:

 * Malcolm Turnbull picked up the fog horn and shouted in the direction of 
Jakarta that Australia’s position was there was no (N-O) link between asylum 
boats and live exports. This became necessary after the deputy prime minister
Barnaby Joyce told the good people of Goulburn there was a link between the two 
issues, the live exports stopped and then the asylum boats came. Pretty much 
everyone said this contention was completely ridiculous, and the Indonesians, 
unsurprisingly, were not amused given this analysis had been presented as fact 
by the deputy prime minister of Australia. When the prime minister wasn’t 
gagging his deputy prime minister and launching a major diplomatic offensive he 
was promising dams in Queensland to sandbag the Coalition’s position up north. 
 * Bill Shorten had to clean up his Victorian colleague David Feeney’s amnesia 
and his departing Senate colleagueNova Peris’ inconvenient departure from 
public life and proceeded to do that by first sending outChris Bowen to say 
Labor would not (N-O-T) restore the school kids bonus and would not alter the 
government’s pensions assets test (promptly superseding Feeney’s Sky News 
offering on Wednesday of *no idea, sorry*) and next standing supportively next 
to Peris while she tearfully told reporters that no-one should judge her for 
departing politics. When Shorten wasn’t doing that, there was funding for 
indigenous initiatives in Darwin.

Sorry, bit of multi-tasking on this afternoon, which means I haven’t really 
dived into the Coalition’s policy announcement today very extensively.

agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull,

Thursday. Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/EPA 
Fortunately Michael Slezak is on the job.

Malcolm Turnbull has promised to spend $150m on dams in Queensland as part of 
a plan to double the agricultural output of northern Australia, but 
conservationists say it would mean thousands of tonnes of pollution would be 
dumped on to theGreat Barrier Reef 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/great-barrier-reef>.

The prime minister committed 
<http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/coalition-begins-rollout-of-2.5-billion-dams-policy-in-queensland>
 $130m to one dam near Rockhampton and another $20m for feasibility studies for 
14 others across the state.

The government said the Rockwood weir project near Rockhampton would create 
2,100 farming jobs. The list of 14 possible dams, which will proceed to 
feasibility studies, runs the length of the state and was touted as having the 
potential to drought-proofQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland>.

But the environmental group WWF said if the six proposed dams in the Great 
Barrier Reef catchment were built, nitrogen pollution on the reef would 
increase by more than 2,500 tonnes each year as a result of increased 
fertiliser use.

Simon Birmingham was also asked to disavow Barnaby Joyce’s comments on boats 
and live exports. He didn’t exactly do that. Birmingham just reframed Joyce 
slightly. He said it was just a fact that diplomatic relations soured between 
Jakarta and Canberra during the live export suspension, and poor diplomatic 
relations made everything harder to deal with. The prime minister said this 
morning there was no link between these issues at all.

Sky News political editor David Speers sticks with gaffes and asks Nick 
Xenophon does he regret saying a while ago on donations and influence that if 
someone gives a political party $100,000 they own them. BusinessmanIan Melrose 
has donated more than $100,000 to Xenophon, which makes his remark somewhat 
inconvenient. Xenophon says sometimes he gives a line that’stoo clever by half, 
and that was a too clever by half line.

Is it embarrassing, Speers wonders?

Nick Xenophon:

I’m embarrassed about what I say all the time.

out of its current wheel- spinning and get on to big announcements.

If it’s not already obvious, there is a big focus on South Australia in this 
contest because of the four-way contest between the two major parties, the 
Greens and the Xenophon team.

A journalist wants to know whether this will be a transient phenomenon – all 
eyes on South Australia.Nick Xenophon says his aspiration is get more Xenophon 
candidates elected, and that will keep South Australia firmly in the national 
game.

Oh no, here we go into questions now.

The first is whether there should be capital investment in Arrium Steel, which 
is in trouble in Whyalla?

Nick Xenophon has the microphone. He says there’s nothing wrong with 
concessional loans, or even a direct leg-up if the alternative is workers at 
Whyalla on the dole queues.Penny Wong says Labor will work constructively with 
the state government.Simon Birmingham says this shouldn’t get into a bidding 
war, a message repeated bySarah Hanson-Young. Hanson-Young adds government 
projects should source Australian steel, and the trans-Pacific partnership 
won’t let us do that.Wong is asked for her view on that given she’s opposition 
spokeswoman on trade. She says Australian projects should use Australian 
standard steel.

'So look I find myself on the same page with Malcolm Turnbull in terms of 
keeping strong borders … '

Before we plug into South Australia, a short recap from the Ray Hadley program 
this morning. I did forget to tune in this morning for the regular fireside 
chat between Hadley and the immigration minister,Peter Dutton. Let’s join this 
duo just as Hadley notes he’s read somewhere thatMalcolm Turnbull is keeping 
Dutton close.

Q: Is that what I read the other day? Is that right that you have been taken 
into the inner sanctum by the prime minister? That you’re now one of the key 
advisers on quite a number of matters? It’s a wonderful turnaround in fortune 
for you.

Peter Dutton:

RayI have got a good working relationship with Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> …

Q: … Well should I congratulate you on that because you came from the other 
side of the fence and there are plenty that are appreciative of the fact that 
you are showing some strength in your portfolio and I guess that gives credit 
to the prime minister – he recognised your strength and to a certain extent he 
has let you off the leash, so to speak, with your various comments. I know that 
no one has to let you off the leash, that you are a very strong-minded man 
anyway, but it’s good to know that Mr Turnbull, who I have described as 
Labor-lite here, is listening to someone from the right.

Peter Dutton: 

Well Ray look, all I can tell you is of my experience with Malcolm Turnbull 
and on this issue and many others he is rock solid. I mean, it’s a disaster in 
my mind thatBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> would become prime 
minister because you know the Labor party wrecked our economy last time – look 
at what they’re doing in Queensland. They’re now raiding superannuation 
accounts. They’re taking money out to put into recurrent expenditure. That is a 
sure way of getting a credit downgrade, of making sure that you’re paying more 
interest on the debt that they run up, and I just don’t want to see that for 
our country at a federal level.

I think Malcolm Turnbull has demonstrated to people that he does have a very 
firm view in relation to keeping the boats stopped, stopping kids drowning, 
making sure that people are out of detention.

So, look, I find myself on the same page with Malcolm Turnbull in terms of 
keeping strong borders, I’m proud of the relationship that we’ve got and I 
think at this election there’s a big difference between what is an old Labor 
model and what has been proven to work, and that’s what we’re presiding over in 
border protection.

I find myself on the same page is an odd locution from a minister about a 
prime minister. #JustSaying

The multi-tasking is now getting mildly dysfunctional so I’ll fold the 
Politics Live tent for today and trot off to record this week’s episode of our 
campaign podcast. Thanks to Mel and thanks to the readers for your company. 
Most marvellous.

Shall we summarise?

Today, Thursday:

 * Malcolm Turnbull picked up the fog horn and shouted in the direction of 
Jakarta that Australia’s position was there was no (N-O) link between asylum 
boats and live exports. This became necessary after the deputy prime minister
Barnaby Joyce told the good people of Goulburn there was a link between the two 
issues, the live exports stopped and then the asylum boats came. Pretty much 
everyone said this contention was completely ridiculous, and the Indonesians, 
unsurprisingly, were not amused given this analysis had been presented as fact 
by the deputy prime minister of Australia. When the prime minister wasn’t 
gagging his deputy prime minister and launching a major diplomatic offensive he 
was promising dams in Queensland to sandbag the Coalition’s position up north. 
 * Bill Shorten had to clean up his Victorian colleague David Feeney’s amnesia 
and his departing Senate colleagueNova Peris’ inconvenient departure from 
public life and proceeded to do that by first sending outChris Bowen to say 
Labor would not (N-O-T) restore the school kids bonus and would not alter the 
government’s pensions assets test (promptly superseding Feeney’s Sky News 
offering on Wednesday of *no idea, sorry*) and next standing supportively next 
to Peris while she tearfully told reporters that no-one should judge her for 
departing politics. When Shorten wasn’t doing that, there was funding for 
indigenous initiatives in Darwin.

That was Thursday. Do join us Friday. See you then.
 
Sorry, bit of multi-tasking on this afternoon, which means I haven’t really 
dived into the Coalition’s policy announcement today very extensively.

Fortunately Michael Slezak is on the job.

Malcolm Turnbull has promised to spend $150m on dams in Queensland as part of 
a plan to double the agricultural output of northern Australia, but 
conservationists say it would mean thousands of tonnes of pollution would be 
dumped on to theGreat Barrier Reef 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/great-barrier-reef>.

The prime minister committed 
<http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/coalition-begins-rollout-of-2.5-billion-dams-policy-in-queensland>
 $130m to one dam near Rockhampton and another $20m for feasibility studies for 
14 others across the state.

The government said the Rockwood weir project near Rockhampton would create 
2,100 farming jobs. The list of 14 possible dams, which will proceed to 
feasibility studies, runs the length of the state and was touted as having the 
potential to drought-proofQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland>.

But the environmental group WWF said if the six proposed dams in the Great 
Barrier Reef catchment were built, nitrogen pollution on the reef would 
increase by more than 2,500 tonnes each year as a result of increased 
fertiliser use.
 
Speaking of Barnaby Joyce, some free advice: eating raw produce doesn’t work 
well for a long political career.

Simon Birmingham was also asked to disavow Barnaby Joyce’s comments on boats 
and live exports. He didn’t exactly do that. Birmingham just reframed Joyce 
slightly. He said it was just a fact that diplomatic relations soured between 
Jakarta and Canberra during the live export suspension, and poor diplomatic 
relations made everything harder to deal with. The prime minister said this 
morning there was no link between these issues at all.
 
The protagonists are asked for their views on a high-level nuclear waste dump 
for the state. Hanson-Young is against it; Wong says it will need a social 
licence and if people are ultimately for it, then Labor won’t get in the way; 
Birmingham says theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> will work with the state 
government to get it done, and Xenophon says there should be a referendum in 
South Australia before it proceeds.
 
Sky News political editor David Speers sticks with gaffes and asks Nick 
Xenophon does he regret saying a while ago on donations and influence that if 
someone gives a political party $100,000 they own them. BusinessmanIan Melrose 
has donated more than $100,000 to Xenophon, which makes his remark somewhat 
inconvenient. Xenophon says sometimes he gives a line that’stoo clever by half, 
and that was a too clever by half line.

Is it embarrassing, Speers wonders?

Nick Xenophon:

I’m embarrassed about what I say all the time.
 
Tory Shepherd from the Advertiser wants to know whether the campaign will get 
out of its current wheel- spinning and get on to big announcements.

Green senator Sarah Hanson-Young.

There’s been a lot of focus on gaffes because there’s been a lot of gaffes.
 
If it’s not already obvious, there is a big focus on South Australia in this 
contest because of the four-way contest between the two major parties, the 
Greens and the Xenophon team.

A journalist wants to know whether this will be a transient phenomenon – all 
eyes on South Australia.Nick Xenophon says his aspiration is get more Xenophon 
candidates elected, and that will keep South Australia firmly in the national 
game.
 
Oh no, here we go into questions now.

The first is whether there should be capital investment in Arrium Steel, which 
is in trouble in Whyalla?

Nick Xenophon has the microphone. He says there’s nothing wrong with 
concessional loans, or even a direct leg-up if the alternative is workers at 
Whyalla on the dole queues.Penny Wong says Labor will work constructively with 
the state government.Simon Birmingham says this shouldn’t get into a bidding 
war, a message repeated bySarah Hanson-Young. Hanson-Young adds government 
projects should source Australian steel, and the trans-Pacific partnership 
won’t let us do that.Wong is asked for her view on that given she’s opposition 
spokeswoman on trade. She says Australian projects should use Australian 
standard steel.
 
Over in Adelaide <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adelaide> we are 
still on opening statements.
 
Before we plug into South Australia, a short recap from the Ray Hadley program 
this morning. I did forget to tune in this morning for the regular fireside 
chat between Hadley and the immigration minister,Peter Dutton. Let’s join this 
duo just as Hadley notes he’s read somewhere thatMalcolm Turnbull is keeping 
Dutton close.

Q: Is that what I read the other day? Is that right that you have been taken 
into the inner sanctum by the prime minister? That you’re now one of the key 
advisers on quite a number of matters? It’s a wonderful turnaround in fortune 
for you.

Peter Dutton:

RayI have got a good working relationship with Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> …

Q: … Well should I congratulate you on that because you came from the other 
side of the fence and there are plenty that are appreciative of the fact that 
you are showing some strength in your portfolio and I guess that gives credit 
to the prime minister – he recognised your strength and to a certain extent he 
has let you off the leash, so to speak, with your various comments. I know that 
no one has to let you off the leash, that you are a very strong-minded man 
anyway, but it’s good to know that Mr Turnbull, who I have described as 
Labor-lite here, is listening to someone from the right.

Peter Dutton: 

Well Ray look, all I can tell you is of my experience with Malcolm Turnbull 
and on this issue and many others he is rock solid. I mean, it’s a disaster in 
my mind thatBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> would become prime 
minister because you know the Labor party wrecked our economy last time – look 
at what they’re doing in Queensland. They’re now raiding superannuation 
accounts. They’re taking money out to put into recurrent expenditure. That is a 
sure way of getting a credit downgrade, of making sure that you’re paying more 
interest on the debt that they run up, and I just don’t want to see that for 
our country at a federal level.

I think Malcolm Turnbull has demonstrated to people that he does have a very 
firm view in relation to keeping the boats stopped, stopping kids drowning, 
making sure that people are out of detention.

So, look, I find myself on the same page with Malcolm Turnbull in terms of 
keeping strong borders, I’m proud of the relationship that we’ve got and I 
think at this election there’s a big difference between what is an old Labor 
model and what has been proven to work, and that’s what we’re presiding over in 
border protection.

I find myself on the same page is an odd locution from a minister about a 
prime minister. #JustSaying
