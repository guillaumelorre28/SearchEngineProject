The shareholder spring returned on Thursday when 35% of shareholders voted 
against the remuneration report at the engineering data and design companyAveva 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/avevagroup>. The protest is the latest in 
a series of investor revolts at pay deals and comes as six pay policies were 
voted down this year â€“ the most since the "say on pay" was introduced 10 years 
ago. The company is part of the FTSE 250 and was founded by the government and 
Cambridge University in the 1960s before being privatised by Margaret 
Thatcher's government. Earlier this year it threatened to relocate in protest 
at UK employment laws.
