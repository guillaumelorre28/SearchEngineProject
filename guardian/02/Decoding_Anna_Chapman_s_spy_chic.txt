Has there ever been a better excuse for a broadsheet to publish a photograph 
of a Russian twenty-something, pouting with her finger to her lips wearing a 
blue corset?

Admittedly Anna Chapman's Facebook-fox-meets-naïve-tourist chic is 
fascinating. There she is snapped in front of Big Ben in her silky apple hoodie 
and a cross-body bag looking as though she is off to a retro rave. The look is 
more KLF than KGB. Next up in the Chapman sartorial repertoire is the "sexy 
Skype look" – tiger print skin tight vest, tousled hair and seductive 
cigarette. Was Chapman getting more into her James Bond baddie stride here?

Marriage-era Chapman is a little more demure. Her long hair is tied back and 
there is no sign of the studenty experimental henna. Instead it's all dorky 
sandals, sporty vests, bad denim and er, chaps. Clearly, she was deep 
undercover.

But New York era Chapman is full-on spy chic – realistically what more 
evidence does MI5 need? There she is smouldering in front of the Manhattan 
skyline in a FromRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> With Love 
fur-trimmed coat and some billionaire-look sparkly earrings. And that snap of 
her in the military-influenced coat and belt? A few years ago high street 
labels were actually referring to this kind of style as a "spy coat" if memory 
serves.

Tellingly the wardrobe details of the rest of the alleged spy ring are scarce, 
if not non-existent.

But then without Chapman's attractive face, luscious red hair and the 
extensive photographic records of her Euro spy-chic would we really care about 
the spying? In truth it seems that we care more about the corset than the crime.
