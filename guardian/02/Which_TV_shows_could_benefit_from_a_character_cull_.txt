 Stannis Baratheon. 
After four wearying seasons of constantly cutting back to whatever the hell 
Bran is up to – spoiler: absolutely nothing interesting – the second Stark son 
is being sin-binned for all of season five. Thank the old gods, and the new! 
But among GoT’s sprawling cast, there’s another dramatic makeweight: Stannis 
Baratheon, the least engaging antagonist of them all – a stiff, humourless clod 
who can’t even convince himself that he deserves the Iron Throne. It’s weird 
because Stephen Dillane is a great actor, but the sooner Stannis’s entrails 
become ex-trails in a GoT mega-slaying, the better.

Part of the push-pull appeal of HBO’s hipster angst-soap is wondering which of 
the core Girls quartet is most likely to make you want to bash your head 
against a wall week-to-week. It’s been a particularly rocky road with Marnie, a 
former super-striver now shacked up with her crusty songwriting partner. How 
best to explain Marnie vanishing? Perhaps a bit of art mimicking life, since 
Allison Williams recently took the lead in TV musical Peter Pan Live! During 
their next brunch, the otherGirls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/girls> could snark about how the 
absent Marnie is busy rehearsing for the first ever Williamsburg panto, 
alongside hot imports the Krankies and Barry from EastEnders.

It’s not just fictional characters who need to be chopped to make shows 
better. Over the last eight years on Mock The Week, Andy Parsons has slowly 
devolved from a three-dimensional person into a one-note caricature. Putting 
aside the James May shirts and musketeer beard, the up-and-down cadences of his 
abrasively nasal, cod-indignant routine have become so familiar, the actual 
words don’t even matter any more; it’s just a braying noise, an ululating 
waveform, a schtick that’s become stuck. A handy byproduct: ditching Parsons as 
a Mock The Week fixture could also free up a seat for a regular female 
panellist.

It’s too late for any major retooling of the deluxe ads/fags/shags time 
capsule, with the second half of its seventh and final season imminent. But to 
paraphrase Ram Jam, Mad Men might have had some extra bam-a-lam if it had – 
wo-oah! – lacked Betty, since the inveterate moper, callous mother and 
unpredictable comfort eater seemed to drag the narrative away from husband Don, 
who everyone loves despite him being a bastard. The natural juncture would have 
been at the end of season three, when the Drapers consciously uncoupled: 
where’s a ride-on lawnmower when you need one?

This might seem like straight-up crazy talk, especially as one of the only 
things that’s actually been confirmed about the next season ofBroadchurch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/broadchurch> is that David Tennant 
and Olivia Colman will return as glum-cop cufflinks DI Hardy and DS Miller. But 
one way this former heavyweight drama champ could recover from its 
second-season wobble would be to engineer a gripping narrative to power season 
three. With no warning, push Hardy off a cliff at the end of episode one: 
Miller finally gets that promotion – and can also righteously avenge his death.

 Ant and Dec. Photograph: Julie Holder 
Ant and Dec <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ant-and-dec> are now so 
slick, frictionless and interchangeable, it’s almost impossible to imagine them 
apart – which is precisely why it would be interesting to attempt it. Imagine a 
Saturday Night Takeaway where the thing that was taken away was Dec. Would Ant 
be able to function independently or would his brain simply shut down all 
higher functions and revert to a fallback position, delivering pally feeder 
lines into empty space and leaving awkward pauses for his partner’s comebacks 
before an increasingly uncomfortable audience? After a lifetime worshipping Vic 
and Bob, this could be Ant’s masterpiece of anti-comedy.
