Aim

"To increase the effectiveness and public accountability of policing 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/ukpga_20090026_en_1#Legislation-Preamble>
, to reduce crime and disorder, and to enhance airport security."

Main provisions

 Makes local police forces more accountable to their local communities by 
placing an explicit duty on police authorities to reflect their communities' 
priorities in their activities; makesthe HMIC 
<http://inspectorates.homeoffice.gov.uk/hmic> responsible for monitoring this 
requirement.
 Simplifies the authorisation procedures specificed in the Regulation of 
Investigatory Powers Act 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/14/regulation-investigatory-powers-act>
.
 Amends the laws on extradition to allow the government to give an 
undertaking to any foreign country that, when seeking the extradition to the UK 
of a person, that after the person's trial they are to be returned to that 
country, which may include to serve the sentence imposed in the UK.
 Reclassifies lap-dancing clubs so they require a sex establishment licence. 
This gives local people a say in their location and will allow local police 
forces to shut down clubs near sensitive locations like schools.
 Establishes a mandatory code of practice for alcohol retailers and amends 
police powers to allow them to effectively target young people drinking in 
public.
 Creates a new strict liability offence of paying for sex with a prostitute 
when a third person has used "exploitative conduct" (including force, threats 
and other coercion) to ensure the prostitute provides the sexual services, and 
modifies existing offences, such as soliciting.
 Amends legislation to make it easier to recover criminal assets 
<http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-2007-asset-recovery/asset-recovery-consultation.pdf?view=Binary>
 and to ensure international judicial cooperation.
 Widens the circumstances in which civil orders can be used to restrict the 
activities of sex offenders and to strengthen foreign travel orders.
 Grants the UK Border Agency officers wider powers to question travellers and 
to require the production of passports and travel documents for customs 
purposes.
 Makes football banning orders in England and Wales enforceable in Scotland 
and Northern Ireland.
 Adds "reducing re-offending 
<http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/partnerships2.htm>" to the 
statutory responsibilities ofcrime and disorder 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/13/crime-disorder-act>
 reduction partnerships.
 Introduces gang injunctions (or gangbos) which empower a court to issue a 
civil injunction against a person, on the civil standard of proof, if the court 
thinks the person has been involved in gang-related violence. These injunctions 
can prevent a person doing something and require them to do something.
 Amends the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2006/ukpga_20060047_en_1> to require the ISA 
to notify an employer if they are considering barring a person but is awaiting 
them making representations to them, and for other purposes.

Background
 Factbox liberty central Photograph: n/a/guardian.co.uk 
Enacted in November 2009, the Policing and Crime Act 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/ukpga_20090026_en_1> emanated from 
recommendations made in a series of government reports onpolice jurisdiction 
<http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/police-reform/Policing_GP> and 
reform, and on how toengage local communities 
<http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/crime.aspx> in fighting crime. It also made 
provisions for enacting recommendations onimproving 
<http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/airportpolicing/> airport security, 
 reducing prostitution 
<http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-paying-the-price/> and implementing
 <http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/news-events/latest-news/alcohol-action-plan> 
the government's youth alcohol action plan. Commenting on the bill, the home 
secretary, Jacqui Smith, said: "The public is our best weapon in fighting crime 
and this bill gives them the right to expect the police to focus on the crimes 
that matter to their community. The measures in the new policing and crime bill 
will ensure that the police and local authorities tackle ... alcohol related 
crime and disorder, prostitution and lap dancing clubs."

Originally, the principal aim of the bill was to increase police 
accountability. Initially the government planned to allow the public to elect 
police chiefs to the 43 police authorities in England and Wales. Critics of 
this plan, including the National Police Association, the Local Government 
Association and the Association ofPolice <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police>
 Authorities, warned that it would compromise "operational independence" and 
could lead to extremists or single-issue campaigners gaining excessive 
influence.

Amid fears that the plan could lead to groups like the BNP gaining authority, 
theidea was dropped 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/22/bmp-membership-nick-griffin-decentralisation>
 and not included in the bill. Speaking to the Guardian, Smith expressed her 
disappointment and attacked the Conservatives, claiming the London MayorBoris 
Johnson's role <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/oct/03/blair.london>in 
forcing the resignation of Sir Ian Blair as head of Scotland Yard and the 
Conservative's behaviour following the arrest of the Tory frontbencherDamian 
Green 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/nov/28/damian-green-arrest-conservatives>
 had caused widespread public concern. Smith said: "The Tories' behaviour 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/dec/18/police-communities-elections> 
has raised fears that the police were being politicised, making it more 
difficult to win public support for my proposals for some members of the police 
authority to be directly elected."

After the bill had its second reading, the government introduced new 
provisions to enable courts to impose injunctions on those it considers, on the 
balance of probabilities, to have been involved in or encouraged "gang-related 
violence" in order to prevent future violence or to protect the person. The 
injunctions are a mix between an Asbo and a control order, as they give the 
courts the power to prohibit a person from doing certain things (which they can 
already do under an Asbo) but also require a person to do certain things, 
including house arrest for up to eight hours a day, mandatory reporting to the 
police etc. All of this can be imposed without the need for any criminal 
conviction. Breach of an injunction is a contempt of court and can be dealt 
with under those procedures.

The government also used this bill to introduce provisions in relation to DNA, 
to enable the home secretary to make regulations setting out the retention and 
destruction of DNA. After sustained objection by all sides of the house and 
after concerted pressure by human rights campaigners, these provisions were 
dropped from the bill. Provisions have now been introduced to thecrime and 
security bill 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmbills/003/10003.i-ii.html> 
to allow for primary legislation regarding DNA retention.

Criticism

Members of the police force were among the first to criticise some of the key 
elements of the act. The head of the Metropolitan police's anti-trafficking 
unit, Alan Gibson, argued that the law criminalising men who pay for sex with 
trafficked prostitutes would be"very difficult to enforce" 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/dec/10/sex-trafficking-law-enforcement>
 and that the unit would need to commission research to discover whether the 
majority of sex workers were indeed controlled for gain (which was the original 
definition).

The Liberal Democrats were also critical 
<http://www.libdems.org.uk/home/policing-and-crime-bill-fails-to-deliver-on-local-accountability-huhne-133817131;show>
, claiming the act fails to deliver the local accountability promised in the
policing green paper 
<http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/police-reform/Policing_GP/> and 
that it fails to empower local communities. According toChris Huhne 
<http://www.libdems.org.uk/home/policing-and-crime-bill-fails-to-deliver-on-local-accountability-huhne-133817131;show>
, the Liberal Democrat's shadow home secretary, the act's greatest failure lies 
in its reforms of legislation relating to prostitution. He claimed it would 
"drive sex workers underground, into less safety, more isolation".

Human rights organisation Liberty was concerned by the amendments made to the 
Extradition Act 2003 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2008/dec/16/extradition-act>
, particularly the ability to allow the secretary of state to give an 
undertaking when seeking a person's extradition to return that person to any 
country, either to serve a sentence of imprisonment imposed in the UK or after 
having served that sentence.

Liberty also expressed serious concerns at the proposed introduction of a 
power to make secondary legislation to set out the government's position on DNA.
Liberty said at the time 
<http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/pdfs/policy-09/policing-and-crime-2nd-reading-lords.pdf>
 that "an issue of such importance – the retention of DNA profiles on a 
centralised database – should be properly debated and considered by parliament 
and not left to secondary legislation."

Liberty raised further concerns at the introduction of gang injunctions 
(gangbos). It said: "The government should not be resorting to civil orders to 
tackle violent behaviour when we have existing criminal law for this purpose. 
There is no need, other than to cut corners and erode important safeguards, to 
introduce further legislation."
