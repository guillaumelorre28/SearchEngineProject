The ITV presenter Adrian Chiles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/adrian-chiles> was at the centre of a 
Twitter storm on Friday night after making potentially offensive remarks about 
Polish supporters live on air.

Chiles, 46, who had anchored ITV's coverage of England's World Cup qualifying 
4-1 victory over Montenegro at Wembley was discussing Tuesday's final group 
game against Poland with the pundit and formerEngland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/england> defender Lee Dixon. After Dixon 
said he was sure Poland fans would be 'crying at the end' of Tuesday's game 
Chiles said he hoped they would not be too upset as 'I am trying to get some 
building work done at the moment'.

Chiles had already called the game 'practically a home game' for Poland, 
referring to the large number of Poles living in and around London. England 
must beatPoland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland> on Tuesday to be 
sure of automatically qualifying for the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil.

In a statement, Chiles later said: "I made the remark in relation to the nice 
Polish builders currently working at my place, who I knew would already be fed 
up having watched their team lose to Ukraine. No offence was intended â€“ apart 
from anything else I could hardly be prouder of my own East European 
background. But to anyone who thought what I said constituted some kind of lazy 
stereotyping, and was offended by it, I certainly apologise."
