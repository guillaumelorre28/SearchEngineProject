A tree may fall in a forest and not make a sound; but at the University of 
Sydney <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> they send out a 
press release.


Past and present students of the university are mourning the loss of a tree 
that collapsed overnight after 88 years.

The jacaranda had bloomed in the main quadrangle since 1928 but on Saturday 
morning was found uprooted.

The university issued a press release (“We are saddened to advise the 
University community...”) and has been sharing tributes to the “beloved” tree 
on social media.

Our beloved jacaranda sadly collapsed last night, but not without one last 
bloom for final weeks of study for 2016.https://t.co/qtD7zyZgmY

It had featured in the backdrop of “thousands” of graduation and wedding 
photos over its lifetime, a spokeswoman for the university told Guardian 
Australia – photos that, for a time, will be doubtless too painful to look at.

She said the tree was thought to have died “of old age” and that people were 
“very emotional”.

The jacaranda has been remembered on social media as “famed”, “iconic”, 
“magical” , “beautiful” and “Sydney Uni’s only redeeming feature”.

“Oh my gosh... literally the saddest day. Say it isn’t so,” tweeted a science 
student <https://twitter.com/starloz/status/792195089380487169>.

It is just the latest loss in a year already marred by high-profile deaths, 
including the other Purple One.

“I mean, you gotta admit that the jacaranda falling is VERY 2016,” one woman 
suggested <https://twitter.com/courtneyypearl/status/792192479386742792>.

Jacaranda, the tree who died

<https://twitter.com/peripeteda/status/792227677004378112> 
Mark Scott, former managing director of the ABC and now secretary of the NSW 
Department of Education,said the jacaranda was 
<https://twitter.com/mscott/status/792193636519649281> “the most famous tree in 
Australian education” (“Vale”).

This is a subjective honour, though the tree was one of 1931 trees listed on 
the City of Sydney’s Significant Tree Register in 2005. It also made the city’s 
chief aborist’s Top 10 Trees list in 2012.

The jacaranda had lived a “truly great life,” as one lecturer 
<https://twitter.com/dtsmith_sydney/status/792218940294307840> put it.

Journalist Annabel Crabb said 
<https://twitter.com/annabelcrabb/status/792235589068218368> the loss was “very 
sad”. “But Lordy, I hope when I keel over I look this beautiful.”

Peter FitzSimons, head of the Australian Republican Movement and former 
Australian rugby international,also said the loss 
<https://twitter.com/Peter_Fitz/status/792239036161155074> of the tree was 
“very sad”, while also evoking happy memories of him passing his exam in 1980.
Peter FitzSimons (@Peter_Fitz) 
Very sad. 
In 1980, I saw it was blooming, and realised I hadn't yet started studying. 
Went to my room, and emerged six weeks later. PASSED!https://t.co/qoKlfAaZFg

<https://twitter.com/Peter_Fitz/status/792239036161155074> 
FitzSimons’ tribute, and many others, referenced folklore that any 
undergraduate who failed to study before the tree’s first bloom appeared would 
fail their exams.

“Students are reminded that the current tree had begun to bloom and we wish 
them all well for their final weeks of study for 2016,” the university 
concluded its press release.

It is not known whether this is indicative of the university’s teaching on 
causal relationships.

So the fact the whole tree has collapsed and died is probably a bad omen for 
the upcoming exam period, right? 😢@Sydney_Uni <https://twitter.com/Sydney_Uni>

The student newspaper Honi Soit produced a moving video tribute 
<https://twitter.com/honi_soit/status/792239581303189504> to “The Jacaranda, 
1928-2016”.

It quoted section 42.1 of the University of Sydney’s Tree Management 
Procedure: “Trees are living organisms so it is inevitable that they will die.”

It is not known whether the tree will be pulped to make paper on which future 
editions of Honi Soit can be printed, thus continuing the circle of student 
life.

But Lisa Pryor, former journalist and doctor, tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/pryorlisa/status/792253130431877120> expressed 
disappointment at the apparent callousness – and lack of foresight as to 
monetiseable opportunities –with which the tree was disposed of.

“Can’t believe they just got rid of the dead jacaranda. So many would like a 
piece of that wood as a momento, like a piece of the Berlin Wall.”

Already, with the tree not long out of the ground, there are demands for 
answers as to the cause of death – and rampant speculation.


“I think we all know that leftism killed that jacaranda tree,” tweeted 
cartoonist Jon Kudelka 
<https://twitter.com/jonkudelka/status/792226121693573120>.

The demise of the iconic and much-loved figure so suddenly after Honi Soit 
spoofed the Australian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/28/gold-coast-mayor-ups-the-ante-in-campaign-against-privileged-editors>
 has also prompted suspicion.
Rob Stott (@Rob_Stott) 
Incredible that News Corp operatives murdered the Sydney uni jacaranda just 
because Honi killed off Rupert

But the editors of Honi Soit denied involvement to Guardian Australia in a 
statement.

“This has left a gaping hole in the hearts of students, and University PR 
brochures alike. Contrary to reports, we did not do it. We solemnly call on the 
Vice-Chancellor to release the arborist’s report. It was almost as if the 
removalists were waiting in the wings. This whole thing smacks of an inside 
job.”

The university community may be comforted by the fact that the tree will, 
eventually, be replaced by one of its own.


“In 2014 the University advised that that the jacaranda was nearing the end of 
its natural life and hired a specialist jacaranda grower to take cuttings,” 
said its statement. “Grafted onto the base of other jacarandas, the cuttings 
have produced two clones. This means that the University will be able to 
replace the jacaranda with genetically identical stock.”

A spokeswoman rejected Guardian Australia’s suggestion that this was excessive.

“If you ask any Sydney graduate, they’re all very attached to it.”

In the meantime, Sydney residents are advised to take solace in the shade of 
the hundreds of similar jacaranda trees able to be found outside university 
grounds.
