From Spirituals to Swing was the title of a concert at Carnegie Hall on 23 
December 1938, marking the first time jazz had made a formal recognition of its 
own history. The concert, intended to present music of African-American origin 
to a mixed audience, was the brainchild of John Hammond, a scion of the 
Vanderbilt dynasty who had fallen in love with jazz during his youth. He worked 
as a jazz critic before beginning a distinguished career as an A&R man, and was 
also active in the civil rights movement.

The concert, and a second instalment held on Christmas Eve the following year, 
were representative of his inclusive taste, featuring the country blues 
performers Big Bill Broonzy and Sonny Terry, the "blues shouter" Big Joe 
Turner, the gospel singing of the Golden Gate Quartet and the boogie woogie 
pianists Meade Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons alongside the bands of Count Basie 
and Benny Goodman and many others. Having had his requests for sponsorship 
turned down by many bodies, Hammond eventually secured backing from New Masses, 
a periodical produced by the American Communist party. The concerts would be 
seen as a milestone in the presentation and appreciation of jazz.
