That’s a serious win for England, who were down to 14 men for 76 minutes after 
Daly’s red card. Argentina had a man sent off of their own with four minutes 
remaining, and one sense that he will be in more trouble than Daly.

Ben Youngs says that is the most satisfying of England’s 12 wins under Eddie 
Jones. They can’t have had to dig deeper in many.

Ben Youngs: 'We want to make history & next week we have the opportunity to do 
that' (Eng need to beat Aus for record-equalling 14th win).

Full time! England 27-14 Argentina

80 min Argentina are back to 14 by the way, with Matera back on the field. 
This scrum is a mess, unsurprisingly. England go right with the clock red, but 
knock on and Argentina break through De La Fuente. Argentina aren’t going to 
put it out, this is the end of the year. But eventually they knock on and thast 
is that. Extraordinary game, that.

79 min Argentina go quickly but eventually get a crosskick goes wrong and it 
goes out. England are going from deep! Joseph has spotted a gap, and boots it, 
but Argentina mop up.

78 min Care is marshalling England and they go left, but Wood knocks on. 
Argentina will run it from deep. Landajo half-break, then Isa fully breaks 
until running into Slade. Argentina go left, and Lezana breaks. England knock 
on.

76 min Marler took that very well. He knew what he was doing. We have 13 v 13 
for the last four minutes. Farrell finds touch and England win the lineout on 
the right on the 22.

Red card! Pieretto 75! England 27-14 Argentina

What has happened here is that Pieretto has been held by Marler. His boot has 
found his head. Was it intentional? If so, red. He’s tumbling. But he knows 
what he’s doing.

Marler has been yellowed for holding.

Pieretto has been sent off for the stamp.

75 min Slade is on for Brown, who pulled up a little groggily after nearly 
scoring. England win the lineout and Sinckler carries, then Lawes. Care goes 
left, then May offloads and Sinckler breaks! Eventually there is an 
interception as England launch it around but we are going back to look at 
something. Offside, but something more, maybe? 18 white in the dock for 
stamping here ... Pieretto the naughty boy.

74 min They have gone miles here Argentina, right down to England’s 22, where 
May makes a fine tackle. On they go, and they are rewarded with a penalty 10m 
out. Ref wants to know if there has been a neck roll, though, and Dan Cole is 
the victim. Penalty reversed. Great coutnerattack ruined by that. Farrell finds 
touch.

72 min The scrum is steady and Robshaw is loud. England go right! They come 
back left and Brown is in space, straightens and swats a couple of men off! He 
doesn’t quite get to the line but wriggles there. Has he scored?

The question, which is good for England, is “is there any reason why I cannot 
award the try?” Well, yes there is actually. Brown has knocked on. 5m scrum for 
Argentina.

Now we are having a look see if an England player - Care - has been tackled 
off the ball. The answer is no.

70 min Wow! Hernandez’s kick off has gone backwards! He’s sliced it and it’s 
landed in his own half! England scrum.

Try! (May 68) England 27-14 Argentina

69 min Kruis carries well for England and they have an overlap out left! It 
goes through the hands of Ford, Wood and Joseph, who draws the man and frees 
May, who streaks home to finish! From 5m in on the left, Farrell cannot convert.
 Jonny May runs with the ball on his way to scoring the second try.

Yellow card! Matera 65! England 22-14 Argentina

66 min From the maul, Argentina are collapsing. England play the advantage - 
there’s a chip gathered by Joseph then a knock from Ford. But we are going back 
for the penalty! And there’s a yellow card for Matera!

63 min That’s a turnaround! Dan Cole has Argentina on the hop at scrum time 
and there’s a penalty. That will please Marler and George too. Farrell - is he 
captain now? - will go for the posts.

61 min Argentina run left from their own half. A miss pass doesn’t go to hand 
but is recovered. They go right but that’s a huge tackle from Farrell. On they 
go.

59 min Blood falling from Cole’s ear but the ref hasn’t noticed. Better scrum 
for England, and Ford sends up a huge high bomb which May chases well. But he 
can only knock on. Good effort from Ford and May. Hartley and Mako off for 
George and Marler.

Springboks for the first time, last week – by 19-17. What a day

are steady and go right. Kruis tackles Creevy very well as they come up the 
middle but there is space out left until they knock on! Hartley still out there.

48 min Cole brings Wood with him, and Sinckler goes. Farrell was playing

47 min A clean put-in is handy for England. They win the ball and go right,

45 min Joseph does well to claim a crosskick but throws a slightly wild

bin.

breaks up the left! Lovely stuff. Cordero, who started it, is there for him, 
then Cubelli is on his shoulder and Cordero takes it back and runs in easily 
under the posts. Hernandez converts.

That’s a serious win for England, who were down to 14 men for 76 minutes after 
Daly’s red card. Argentina had a man sent off of their own with four minutes 
remaining, and one sense that he will be in more trouble than Daly.

Ben Youngs says that is the most satisfying of England’s 12 wins under Eddie 
Jones. They can’t have had to dig deeper in many.

Ben Youngs: 'We want to make history & next week we have the opportunity to do 
that' (Eng need to beat Aus for record-equalling 14th win).

80 min Argentina are back to 14 by the way, with Matera back on the field. 
This scrum is a mess, unsurprisingly. England go right with the clock red, but 
knock on and Argentina break through De La Fuente. Argentina aren’t going to 
put it out, this is the end of the year. But eventually they knock on and thast 
is that. Extraordinary game, that.
 
79 min Argentina then knock on on their own 22. Twickenham goes mad as Robshaw 
is named man of the match.
 
79 min Argentina go quickly but eventually get a crosskick goes wrong and it 
goes out. England are going from deep! Joseph has spotted a gap, and boots it, 
but Argentina mop up.
 
78 min Care is marshalling England and they go left, but Wood knocks on. 
Argentina will run it from deep. Landajo half-break, then Isa fully breaks 
until running into Slade. Argentina go left, and Lezana breaks. England knock 
on.
 
76 min Marler took that very well. He knew what he was doing. We have 13 v 13 
for the last four minutes. Farrell finds touch and England win the lineout on 
the right on the 22.
 
What has happened here is that Pieretto has been held by Marler. His boot has 
found his head. Was it intentional? If so, red. He’s tumbling. But he knows 
what he’s doing.

Marler has been yellowed for holding.

Pieretto has been sent off for the stamp.

75 min Slade is on for Brown, who pulled up a little groggily after nearly 
scoring. England win the lineout and Sinckler carries, then Lawes. Care goes 
left, then May offloads and Sinckler breaks! Eventually there is an 
interception as England launch it around but we are going back to look at 
something. Offside, but something more, maybe? 18 white in the dock for 
stamping here ... Pieretto the naughty boy.
 
74 min They have gone miles here Argentina, right down to England’s 22, where 
May makes a fine tackle. On they go, and they are rewarded with a penalty 10m 
out. Ref wants to know if there has been a neck roll, though, and Dan Cole is 
the victim. Penalty reversed. Great coutnerattack ruined by that. Farrell finds 
touch.
 
73 min So we have another scrum. Eventually the ball emerges and Argentina 
break!

Scotland won 43-16 btw. 
 
72 min The scrum is steady and Robshaw is loud. England go right! They come 
back left and Brown is in space, straightens and swats a couple of men off! He 
doesn’t quite get to the line but wriggles there. Has he scored?

The question, which is good for England, is “is there any reason why I cannot 
award the try?” Well, yes there is actually. Brown has knocked on. 5m scrum for 
Argentina.

Now we are having a look see if an England player - Care - has been tackled 
off the ball. The answer is no.

71 min That scrum, of course, gets the reset it deserves. 
 
70 min Wow! Hernandez’s kick off has gone backwards! He’s sliced it and it’s 
landed in his own half! England scrum.
 
69 min Kruis carries well for England and they have an overlap out left! It 
goes through the hands of Ford, Wood and Joseph, who draws the man and frees 
May, who streaks home to finish! From 5m in on the left, Farrell cannot convert.

67 min Eesh. Farrell’s missed again, from out right. That’s an ugly one. 
Landajo on for Cubelli.
 
66 min From the maul, Argentina are collapsing. England play the advantage - 
there’s a chip gathered by Joseph then a knock from Ford. But we are going back 
for the penalty! And there’s a yellow card for Matera!
 
65 min England win another penalty from the kick-off! Great work from Robshaw, 
and England find touch, and win the lineout!
 
38m out, just to the left. Farrell scores and England are eight points clear.
 
63 min That’s a turnaround! Dan Cole has Argentina on the hop at scrum time 
and there’s a penalty. That will please Marler and George too. Farrell - is he 
captain now? - will go for the posts.
 
62 min Hernandez sends it very high but they knock on as it comes down. Creevy 
is going off, replaced by Montoya. Pieretto replaces Herrera.
 
61 min Argentina run left from their own half. A miss pass doesn’t go to hand 
but is recovered. They go right but that’s a huge tackle from Farrell. On they 
go.
 
60 min Hartley missed four tackles there. Another scrum, then. New cast in the 
front row. I’m going to shock you here - we are resetting.

59 min Blood falling from Cole’s ear but the ref hasn’t noticed. Better scrum 
for England, and Ford sends up a huge high bomb which May chases well. But he 
can only knock on. Good effort from Ford and May. Hartley and Mako off for 
George and Marler.

Tonga have beaten Italy! 
Rugby World (@Rugbyworldmag) 
Huge result for Tonga in Padua. They've just beaten Italy – who defeated the 
Springboks for the first time, last week – by 19-17. What a day

58 min Cole back for his first look at a scrum since being binned. Argentina 
are steady and go right. Kruis tackles Creevy very well as they come up the 
middle but there is space out left until they knock on! Hartley still out there.
 
56 min This one’s just inside Argentina’s half and pretty straight, but 
Farrell sends it to the right. Harrison knocks on the 22 drop-out! Poor from 
England.
 
55 min Argentina go up the middle through Creevy, who is everywhere. But they 
give away another penalty! They will go for goal, again.

54 min Argentina win the ball and Hernandez sends up a bomb. Brown safely 
under it and England probe up the right on halfway. Youngs snipes, but is 
turned over by Creevy.
 
53 min England claim the kick-off and Youngs boxkicks. Isa naively lets it 
land and it goes into touch on halfway, much to the crowd’s delight.
 
This is on the left and 40m out. Farrell sticks it through.

George is coming on, which is fascinating.
 
51 min England win the lineout and roll. Lawes has it. There’s an advantage 
for coming in at the side. And the penalty comes. Farrell is going to go for 
goal. Jamie George is going to come on for Dylan Hartley ...
 
50 min Cubelli gets them moving with a quick tap, but after a grubber, Jonny 
MAy is tackled illegally by Orlando and England win a penalty. Bold tackle from 
a man who has already spent 10 in the bin. Farrell hammers it into touch on 
halfway.
 
49 min Another scrum, then. Argentina win the free-kick.
 
48 min Cole brings Wood with him, and Sinckler goes. Farrell was playing 
flanker there. Argentina win the lineout and keep it tight until England knock 
on.
 
47 min A clean put-in is handy for England. They win the ball and go right, 
and Ford tries a chip, but it’s over May’s head and into touch. Dan Cole is 
back!
 
46 min Lawes wins the lineout and England maul. Youngs snipes. Mako carries. 
Then an Argentina knock on comes. Back to scrums ...
 
45 min Joseph does well to claim a crosskick but throws a slightly wild 
offload that England do well to gather. After a boxkick, England bundle 
Argentina into touch in their own territory. Three minutes left on Cole’s sin 
bin.
 
44 min Orlando stretches England on the right, but there’s a knock on and 
turnover. England go up the left, then Ford kicks deep and Argentina come back.
 
43 min England’s 13 men are struggling. Argentina barge their way out of the 
22, then into England’s half.
