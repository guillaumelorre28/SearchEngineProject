It's 131 years since the gunfight at the O.K. Corral but Tombstone is still 
milking that most famous of western shootouts – between the Earps and the 
Clantons – for every cent. And the latest piece of Earpsploitation is Virgil's 
Corner. Now a boutique B&B, it was once the home of Virgil Earp. Virgil was the 
kingpin of the Earp family. When things reached a head with the Clanton gang, 
he deputised his younger brother Wyatt and his friend "Doc" Holliday to help 
him sort things out. We have heard of Wyatt because, unlike his brothers, he 
lived to a ripe old age, long enough to spin the tale.

Virgil was senior lawman in Tombstone and built a house a couple of blocks 
from the O.K. Corral in 1880. The More family took on the house in 1969 – but 
it was badly damaged by fire in 1998. Timbers that survived, including original 
doors, had been put into storage. And all of them have now been incorporated in 
the B&B's front section, which replicates Virgil's original 14ft x19ft house.

"I started planning and dreaming of the B&B because of the location and 
historical significance of the property," said Diane More. "I hated to think it 
would just be a vacant lot. What better way to allow people to experience the 
wild west than to build a B&B on a historic site in Tombstone?"

Diane scoured antique shops across Arizona and Texas for authentic items for 
the B&B. And when it eventually came to decorating the place, she chose paint 
colours that had been available in the 1880s.
 Virgil's Corner, former Earp family home 
That probably explains why, to contemporary eyes, the decor looks a bit on the 
drab side: cheap but not overly cheerful. Remember, though, that this would 
have been the height of sophistication in the late-19th century – and still 
wild – west, where mud, wood and sawdust were established style statements.

The silver stars on the bedheads are a little tacky, especially the big one 
saying "US Marshal" over the bed in Virgil's room. But this is a town for 
western fans, and Virgil's Corner is as close as you're going to get to the 
homely ambience of the old days.

If, like me, you're a sucker for the Wyatt Earp legend, you get a hell of a 
kick knowing that you're sleeping on the spot where he and his brothers used to 
get together of an evening.

Some parts of Tombstone have been "restored" to the point where you feel like 
you're in a theme park. The O.K. Corral is still there and, inevitably, there 
is a daily re-enactment of the gunfight. Big Nose Kate's saloon on East Allen 
Street, named after Holliday's girlfriend, is a very touristy version of its 
original incarnation as the town's Grand Hotel, but it still has the same long 
bar at which the Earps and the Clantons would have taken their drinks.

There is probably nothing better after a night at the saloon than breakfast at 
Virgil's Corner …
