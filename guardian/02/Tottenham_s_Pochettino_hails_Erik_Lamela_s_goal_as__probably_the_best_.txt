Érik Lamela scored a superb rabona goal on Thursday night during Tottenham’s 
5-1 victory over Asteras Tripolis in theEuropa League

receiving plaudits for the wonder strike despite Mauricio Pochettino showing no 
emotion at the time.

Lamela, Spurs’ record signing at £30m from Roma, got the first of his two 
goals against the Greek side on 29 minutes,producing a remarkable piece of 
skill by wrapping his left foot behind his right

outside the penalty area to send the ball arcing into the net.

It was certainly his best moment for the north London club after he missed a 
large portion of last season through injury and failed to live up to his hefty 
transfer fee. Pochettino, who soon after the goal berated Lamela when the 
forward should have passed, defended his initial reaction.

 Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino says he is happy with the result 
“Maybe it is the best [from one of my players],” said Pochettino. “Probably 
the best. Only a player with his skill can score like the goal he scored today. 
I never show emotion even with a goal like that. I will enjoy it at home in my 
bed.”

The Tottenham manager then joked: “One time I scored one like that. You can 
find it on YouTube, maybe. It was a great goal, I am happy for him and it 
helped us get the three points.”

Lamela’s team-mates were blown away by the finish. Jan Vertonghen tweeted: “I 
was stunned, for two minutes I was just thinking about that goal… I think the 
Puskas award [best goal of the year] is already his. 100% best goal I’ve seen 
live. I’ve seen a lot of YouTube clips but I’ve never seen a goal like it.”
