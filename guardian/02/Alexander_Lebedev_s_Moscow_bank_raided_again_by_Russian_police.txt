His Moscow-based National Reserve Bank was searched by armed police and 
officials from the powerful Russian Investigative Committee, and documents were 
taken away.

The bank has been accused of evading about Â£6.2m in tax, but Lebedev says the 
whole sum in dispute has been paid, suggesting that the raid was a personal 
attack on him by the authorities.

"Apparently, they decided to increase the pressure," Lebedev is quoted in the 
Mail on Sunday <https://www.theguardian.com/media/mailonsunday> as saying. His 
friends believe he has been targeted for political reasons because of his 
co-ownership of the independent Russian investigative newspaper, Novaya Gazeta.

The paper also quotes a spokesman for the investigation as saying: "The bank 
leadership committed tax evasion amounting to over 380m roubles in 2011. The 
bank's assets worth the unpaid taxes have been frozen."

Lebedev has been dogged in recent years by official hostility from Vladimir 
Putin's administration. His bankwas raided in 2010
