I wasn’t allowed to watch TV as a child. I watched films that my parents 
suggested: Truffaut, Godard, a lot of Hitchcock and Italian movies. I sawPsycho 
when I was around eight. I heard my parents say: “You can’t watch this.” I 
remember going to America with them when I was 13 and visiting the house of
Psycho and being really excited. I learned very early on that a piece of art is 
just an expression.

What’s your favourite film?

Opening Night by John Cassavetes. It’s very touching: it’s about a woman who’s 
at an age where new questions start to arise about her work as a stage actress. 
She disagrees with her role, with the play. What I like about it is that she’s 
fearless about expressing her disagreement.

What’s the worst film ever?

Amélie. It’s a lie from start to finish. I hate the portrayal of this young 
lady waiting for the perfect love and being so naive, being an absolutely 
boring child. And I hate people who love that film, too.

Who’s your favourite director?

Cassavetes and Kubrick. The two masters, for me.

What’s your favourite environment for watching films?

The cinema, you can’t beat it.

What’s your favourite film snack?

Popcorn, always. But not sugary - salty.
