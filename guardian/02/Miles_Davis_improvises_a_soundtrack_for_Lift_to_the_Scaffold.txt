It was in the late 1950s that film directors began to call on jazz musicians 
to provide atmospheric soundtracks. Among the most notable were the scores for 
Shadows (Charles Mingus), Anatomy of a Murder (Duke Ellington), The Sweet Smell 
of Success (Chico Hamilton), Odds Against Tomorrow (John Lewis) and Louis 
Malle's Lift to the Scaffold, improvised byMiles Davis
