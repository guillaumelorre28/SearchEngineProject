Another first for me up here in the Arctic - today I experienced a husky dog 
sleigh ride and I realised what I've been missing.

When I first arrived at the kennels and saw the dogs chained in their pens, I 
was a little conscious of taking advantage of a dog to get me from A to B. But 
all it took was for the keepers to bring out their harnesses for me to realise 
that it's not about their ability to run, it's about their lust to run.

For a two-person sled (one driver and one passenger) you are equipped with a 
six-dog engine. As soon as they're hooked up to the sled all they want to do is 
get going. Once the coast is clear, you lift the brake and it's like driving an 
automatic - you're off. You don't have much say in the matter.

We set out across the flat plains of the arctic desert and my breathe was 
taken away by the sheer crispness of the scenery. The air gets colder and 
colder as you head further out. The wind brought tears to my eyes and just 
seconds later they had frozen - it was roughly -25°C out there.

I won't lie - we're not talking super speeds here but this is sustainable 
transport at its best.
