"Perhaps Addison Cresswell should be on this list instead," we said midway 
through Jonathan Ross's entry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/10/jonathan-ross-mediaguardian-100-2009>
 in last year's MediaGuardian 100. Now he is.

Agent, producer and deal-maker extraordinaire, Cresswell was responsible for 
Ross's infamous three-year contract with the BBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/31/jonathan-ross-russell-brand1>
worth almost £6m a year. Legend has it Cresswell was spotted celebrating the 
deal burning money at the bar of Edinburgh's Assembly Rooms.

But having revived his career at the BBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/23/comment.media> not even 
Cresswell could stem the opprobrium heaped on his clientin the wake of 
"Sachsgate" 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/03/russell-brand-jonathan-ross-bbc-fine>
 and Ross's 13-year run at the BBC came to an end. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/07/jonathan-ross-quits-bbc> Ross 
will not be off our screens for long, havingsigned a deal with ITV 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/07/itv1-jonathan-ross-chat-show> 
after a return to Channel 4fell through 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/07/itv1-jonathan-ross-chat-show>.

Ross is the most high profile of Cresswell's roster of clients at his agency, 
Off The Kerb <http://www.offthekerb.co.uk/>, which also includes Alan Carr, 
Jack Dee, Lee Evans and Dara Ó Briain.

Cresswell also has a production company, Open Mike Productions, whose series 
of comedy shows starring Michael McIntyre, another Cresswell client, 
single-handedlywhetted broadcasters' new-found appetite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/05/comedy-roasts-channel-4> for 
standup.

Variously described as loud, volatile, larger than life and the "Darth Vader 
of the [Edinburgh] fringe", Cresswellonce said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/31/jonathan-ross-russell-brand1>: 
"I don't see us as in any way different from the people who run the channels. 
They're complete bastards as well but we all have to work with each other."

It is more than 30 years since Cresswell took on his first client, John 
Hegley, after a stint as entertainments officer at Brighton University. Other 
Off The Kerb clients include Jo Brand, Rich Hall, Phill Jupitus and Sean Lock.

Cresswell set up his first production company, Wonderdog Productions, with 
Julian Clary and Paul Merton, and Clary's Channel 4 show Sticky Moments was one 
of his first big hits.

He went on to executive produce Ross's long-running BBC1 chatshow, a role he 
was allowed to keep 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/05/bbc-presenters-agents-banned-own-shoes>
 despite a BBC ban on presenters and their agents producing their own 
television shows.

Cresswell was offered his own moment in the spotlight when the BBC wanted him 
to beits answer to Simon Cowell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/19/mediadiary> on a BBC1 talent 
show. But Cresswell prefers to stay out of the limelight, and turned them down.
