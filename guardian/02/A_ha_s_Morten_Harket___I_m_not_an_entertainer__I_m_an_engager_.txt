Hi, Morten. Where are you, and what can you see?
I’m on my way to Manchester in my car, with my driver. I can see motorway.

How’s the tour going?
We’ve just come through Russia, which was good.

What percentage of the audience are there for the hits, and how many want 
B-sides and “deep cuts”(1)?
It’s a difficult one that we’ve never really solved. We’d love to do a tour 
where we do album tracks, not the catalogue of hits. There’s quite a lot to 
choose from after 30 years.

Do you secretly dream of doing a whole set of Uriah Heep 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btDHH3tRqR8> covers(2)?
I don’t secretly dream of that but I did dream consciously of taking up the 
position as lead singer of Uriah Heep when I was in my teens. I knew I could do 
it, too.

A-ha’s music is quite gloomy. Are you the missing link between Joy Division 
and One Direction?
Heh-heh. I think we are a different branch altogether.

The saddest boyband ever?
Not the saddest, no. Now melancholy, that’s an entirely different thing.

You were appointed Knights of the 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St 
Olav <http://a-ha.com/the-band/the-norwegian-royal-order-of-st-olav/> for your 
contribution to Norwegian music. Do they call you “sir” back home?
No. We’re Norwegians, not British. We don’t have that in our culture at all. 
But it’s an honour to have it.

Do you get better seats in restaurants?
No. It has no practical, functional value. Even King Harald, when he presented 
us with it, said, “I know this is a bit of an odd thing here, but what else can 
a poor king do?”

You studied theology, but did you want to enter the priesthood?
No. I studied theology and I jumped on the course because I’d been drafted for 
military service and I’d finally achieved long, massive hair that I’d been 
wanting for years. But in the end I did go in the army because I was convinced 
it was the right thing to do.

Are you a theologian-philosopher in the body of a pop pinup?
Well, how do you define your terms? What does it actually mean to be a 
theologian? To be of a religious nature, or theological? Do you understand the 
step from nothing to something, and how that came about?

I never sell myself. I’m a barefoot human being, walking across the planet, 
touching the heart of things

Er … no. Did you really see (A-ha keyboardist) Magne Furuholmen’s dad die in a 
plane crash when you were a boy?
That is very close to the truth. I was about seven at the time but I didn’t 
actually see the plane. My brother, who was a bit older than me, was sat next 
to me in the car on the window side; I was inside the car but couldn’t see out 
of the window. He spotted the small Cessna, and then all of a sudden something 
startled him. He said, “There’s a problem with the plane!” He realised that the 
pilot – in the plane with Mags’ father – was having real difficulties and was 
about to drop out of the sky, which is what then happened. My dad was a doctor 
and so he turned the car around and drove to the site, but by the time we got 
there, there were already ambulance personnel there. It was strange and 
obviously very shocking, not knowing that I would meet Mags later in life.

In the early days of A-ha <https://www.theguardian.com/music/a-ha>, were you 
really so poor you had no money for food and fainted on the street?
Yes. Our resources dwindled to nothing and we had no back-up any more.

You were living in London at the time. How squalid was your flat?
In Forest Hill [south-east London], we had mice inside and rats outside. The 
flat had a strange vibe. We started painting one of the walls and within 
minutes this gooey substance came out, like out of boils. They popped and brown 
liquid seeped out. I’ve yet to understand what on earth that was. To get some 
heat we had to keep the electric oven on. The hob would glow red and there’d be 
a gassy smell that made us a little concerned. We were gulping gas.

Despite the poverty, you were hanging round London with the glamorous new 
romantic stars of the day. Did Steve Strange really have a crush on you?
How big it was, I don’t know, but he did have a crush on me. He was very open 
about it. He asked if I was gay. I said, “Steve, I’m perfectly straight.” And 
his response was, “How boring.”

What did Boy George et al make of the pre-fame Morten Harket 
<http://a-ha-live.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Morten_Batcave_1983.jpg>?
Everyone was eyeing everyone else up, checking out the atmosphere. Just 
hanging.

Did you think, “This is a scene I want to be part of”?
I was hugely confident that I would be part of my own scene, quite honestly. I 
knew this was the quiet period before everything would happen, so I was 
enjoying it, being both anonymous and looked at by everybody – I was heavily 
made up to have fun, being photographed incessantly by paparazzi on the street 
because people thought I was some sort of celebrity even though they couldn’t 
quite figure out who. That was very amusing to me.

Meanwhile, you were into Stoke City, weren’t you?(3)
My brother was an avid Stoke City fan, and a good footballer. We shared a room 
growing up and the walls were covered with 1970s Stoke players, like Peter 
Shilton, Gordon Banks andJimmy Greenhoff 
<http://www.mightyleeds.co.uk/images/greenhoffstoke.jpg>.

I hear you were in a public loo once and a man in the urinal was so pleased to 
see you he turned to say hello and accidentally peed on your foot. True story?
No, that’s not true. It may have happened to Mags, but don’t quote me on that. 
No, no one’s peed on me accidentally. Not wilfully either. Yet.

What is the most startled reaction you’ve ever had when you’re out and about?
There are so many.

Fainting?
Yeah.

Screaming?
Of course.

Vomiting?
I haven’t seen vomiting, not in that context anyway. What is typical is that 
people lose control of their body and just slide on to the floor. They 
dissolve. You’re always responsible for the scene and have to make sure they 
land well.

Have you had a bad landing?
Oh, that can happen at gigs, when the gates are opened and people start piling 
on top of each other – that can get dangerous. People have a sort of panicky 
reaction – they lose it. It happens even now, and I’m 56 years old.

Your video for the (2000 single) Velvet 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1dTWmosbXA> was disturbing, and not just 
because of your boyband image. It had scenes of embalming and showed you being 
zipped up in a body bag.


I don’t find it that disturbing. It’s meant to be a murder scene. The director 
wanted a little juice so he instructed that old lady to kiss me. And she went 
for it. I was lying there with my eyes closed and she just stuck her tongue 
down my throat. She was no spring chicken. Still, you know what they say: once 
you’ve tasted raisins, you don’t go back to grapes.

Did you enjoy your recent BBC Radio 2 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075rvt7> concert?
No, I was very uncomfortable because I had a really bad sound in my ears and 
my sound man was fighting throughout the gig to sort it out but he didn’t 
really succeed. It was deeply frustrating because it was a great crowd, there 
was a lot of excitement, and it should have been a great moment – and it was a 
great moment, for most of the people there. But not for me.

Are you uncomfortable being the frontman?
I’ve never been uncomfortable being a frontman. I’ve always known that to be 
my position, but I’m not a showman. I’m not an entertainer,I’m an engager 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/27/a-ha-review-joyful-comeback-puts-sincerity-over-showbiz>
. I never sell myself, in a sense. I’m a barefoot human being, walking across 
the planet, touching the heart of things. I’m an exponent of the fact that we 
don’t know who we are, and that we’re looking for it. That’s a central part of 
being a human being. The rest of the animal kingdom lives by answers. We live 
by questions.

Do A-ha really sit around quoting Kierkegaard(4)?
Kierkegaard’s fantastic. To study something in the typical empirical way a 
science would, you don’t understand much of what makes life actually work by 
just pulling it to pieces. The mystery and magic of life is something else, and 
the way we actually connect has not been discovered yet fully. You can see two 
birds leaving the nest: one plummets to the ground, the other flies off. If you 
dissect both of them they will both look the same. There is nothing wrong with 
the one that fell, except that it didn’t fly.

Do you think Harry Styles is currently having a conversation similar to this?
I wouldn’t know. I haven’t gotten into his world.

Have you ever cursed your good looks?
No. I look the way I look. It would be disrespectful to do that, quite 
honestly.

Haven’t they been a barrier, in a way?
A barrier, yeah. But I’ve never cursed them. I accept them. It is what it is. 
A lot of things would have been easier if I’d looked different. People assume a 
ton of things.

There were some excruciating TV interviews with you back in the 1980s 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDdpY5HRGwY> where they made a lot of 
assumptions …
Yeah, most of the time they do. It’s like, a woman with slightly larger 
breasts than she should have, they will get in the way; whatever room she has 
to go into, they will enter before her. It will always influence – heavily – 
whatever it is she does. I get frustrated because you sit there on the couch 
and people watch and you could have done something interesting. Anything can be 
interesting as long as you access it from the right angle.

Did John Barry (5) really call you The Hitler Youth?
I didn’t hear him say that, but apparently he did, yeah. He was not an easy 
guy to like, quite honestly. He was very strange in that he started to befriend 
us by talking bad about Duran Duran. He made some degrading comments about them 
and what they’d been doing and that didn’t sit well with any of us.

Did you join in?
Of course not. What for? Then he made some derogatory comments about women and 
it was all uncalled for. There will be people who knew him who will have a very 
different view of him. But he didn’t go down well with us.

Is there a record of yours that came out exactly as you intended?
There are songs you’re happy with in retrospect. But if anything I feel the 
potential of the band has never fully been met, artistically or commercially.

But you’ve sold more than 100m records!
I know the potential of what could be between Paul (Waaktaar-Savoy, songwriter 
and guitarist), Magne and myself and there is so much greatness there that has 
not been met.

What gets in the way?
Personalities. Mindsets.

Didn’t Mags once put your head through a window?
Yeah, but that was a loving move.

Blimey. If that’s him being loving, what’s he like when he’s angry?
He doesn’t get angry. And he never acts violently. None of us do.

Mags once said about you: “Morten as a rocker lacks 60 cigarettes a day and an 
alcohol problem. In an orchestral setting [his voice] tends to end up as 
schmaltzy, it becomes opera. But in the cool, distanced synth landscape, he is 
perfect. Morten is a fantastic weapon to have in your arsenal.” Thoughts?
A-ha makes you what you are in A-ha. I would be something else in a different 
setting. You respond differently to what is there. A-ha doesn’t ask for a 
rocker. U2 don’t have to be the way they are. They’ve chosen to do what they 
do, to suit their trade. You can’t be a carpenter one day and a milkman the 
next.
