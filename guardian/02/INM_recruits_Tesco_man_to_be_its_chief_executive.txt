The Irish-based newspaper publisher, Independent News & Media (INM), has 
appointed a formerTesco <https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco> executive, 
Robert Pitt, to be its chief executive. The experienced supermarket executive 
will take up the position in the autumn.

Pitt, a 43-year-old Irishman, is currently chief operations officer of Tesco 
in the Czech Republic and previously held senior management positions with Lidl.

He replaces Vincent Crowley, who left in May, and has much to do at INM, an 
indebted group that has been contracting for years since its peak under former 
chairman and chief executive, Tony O'Reilly.

It remains Ireland's biggest newspaper group, owning the country's two 
largest-selling titles, theIrish Independent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/irish-independent> and Sunday Independent, 
plus the Belfast Telegraph. It also has a 29% stake in Australian media group 
APN.

Belatedly, INM has been building an online audience in order to attract 
digital ad revenues, which rose 18% year-on-year in its last report. It has 
avoided erecting a paywall.

Since Crowley departed, the company has been run by a sub-committee of its 
board: chairman Leslie Buckley plus three non-executive directors, Triona 
Mullane, Allan Marshall and Terry Buckley.

INM is controlled by Denis O'Brien 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/denis-o-brien>, Ireland's richest man. Since 
taking control, he has sold off various assets, restructured the group and 
replaced the former management.

He also owns Ireland's largest network of commercial radio stations through 
his company Communicorp.

Pitt will doubtless meet his predecessor because Crowley has been appointed 
chairman of the industry's trade body

Ireland.
