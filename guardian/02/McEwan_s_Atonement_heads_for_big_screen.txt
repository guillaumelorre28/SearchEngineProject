acclaimed novel Atonement.

whose fates are forever changed on a hot summer day in 1934.

McEwan has adapted his novel to the screen in collaboration with Les Liaisons 
Dangereuses writer Christopher Hampton.

silver screen debut Pride and Prejudice. WithAtonement

Knightley, who played Elizabeth Bennet.

Knightley is said to have refused numerous film roles for the chance to work 
with Wright again. Their collaboration on the Jane Austen adaptation earned her 
a best actress Oscar nomination this year.

Silk, a love story set in 19th century Japan.

Scottish-born McAvoy, who had impressed British TV viewers with his energetic 
performances in Shameless and State of Play, hit the Hollywood jackpot last 
year when he scored the role of Mr Tumnus in The Chronicles of Narnia: The 
Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.

He is currently working with Anne Hathaway on Becoming Jane, a biopic of the 
young Jane Austen and her romance with an Irishman.
