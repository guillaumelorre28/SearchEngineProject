The plane marks a new chapter for Japan’s aviation sector, which last debuted

Firms in Japan were banned from developing aircraft by US occupiers following 
its defeat in the second world war.

Mitsubishi Heavy, a military contractor, built Japan’s “Zero” fighter plane.

The developer boasts that the MRJ, a fuel-efficient, next-generation aircraft, 
will offer more passenger comfort with lower operating costs, eyeing the 
booming regional jet sector.

Neighbouring China recently unveiled its C919 jetliner
