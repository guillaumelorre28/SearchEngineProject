VW: 'Take on Me' (starts at 00:06) - US

If you're old enough to remember A-ha's iconic song and its ground-breaking 
video, this will whisk you straight back to 1985. And then – just as speedily 
as you were plunged into the past – you'll be yanked back to the here and now 
as you realise that the clever reproduction of the famous pop promo is a set-up 
for a deft moment of comedy.

Adobe: 'Encyclopedia Atlantica' (starts at 00:55) - US

An ailing producer of encyclopaedias seems to have hit the motherlode in this 
amusing ad for Adobe which advises us to be wary of any online trends that we 
don't fully understand. Seasoned ad-watchers may anticipate the ending but that 
doesn't necessarily diminish its impact and it still proves a powerful pitch 
for the properly informed research provided by the company.

Mercedes-Benz: 'Sensations' (starts at 01:59) - France

Mercedes-Benz's recent effort to aim their cars at a younger audience in the 
UK is mirrored by this French commercial which uses XTC by the Chemical 
Brothers and some stunning imagery to suggest that the German-made cars aren't 
exclusive the domain of weary executives and retirees. Not that they're 
entirely willing to let go of the brand's traditional virtues – watching the 
car being forged out of a solid piece of granite allows Mercedes to cling to 
the notion of solidity.

Johnnie Walker: 'From the Future' (starts at 03:33) - UK

Are you destined to be an office drone or will you manage to carpe diem with 
the help of Johnnie Walker? That's the question posed by this dramatic 
commercial for the Scotch whisky which – like the Mercedes-Benz advert in this 
compilation – feels like it's part of a concerted effort to lower the average 
age of those who appreciate the brand.
