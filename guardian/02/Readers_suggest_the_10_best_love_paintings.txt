A couple locked in a passionate embrace is the main focal point of this symbol 
of Italian Romanticism. Their faces and any other identifying details are 
obscured, but the passionate intensity of their kiss remains obvious. Some 
interpretations say the piece is meant to symbolise the unification of the 
kingdom of Italy.

This portrait of the painter’s wife was likely created for private use, rather 
than display. Van Eyck’s wife is painted in fashionable dress for the era, with 
lace adorning her head garment and fur on her dress. User doesnotexist praised 
the painting for showing “a love which has no fear of honesty”.

Salome Dancing before Herod

This elaborate painting, depicting extravagant-looking biblical figures Herod 
and Salome, tells a tale of seduction and desire. Herod is seated on a colossal 
throne in the centre of the picture, as the beautiful Salome dances before him. 
The story goes that Salome’s dance was so seductive that Herod offered her 
anything she wanted, so the femme fatale requested the head of John the 
Baptist. MadelaineFungDuLac said: “Moreau’s painting is a tour de force of 
indirect narrative exposition and it helped to launch the fin-de-siècle 
fixation on the femme fatale as a subject.”

Brown’s painting depicts a love steeped in trust and understanding. As the 
pair leaves England behind, along with all of the comforts of their middle 
class life, the wife clings to her husband’s hand, and their infant clings to 
its mother. The wife displays trust in her husband and the decision to leave 
their homeland behind. Brown modelled the subjects in the painting after his 
own family. Reader Beesimo says Brown’s painting is their favourite, “because 
it shows the deepest love. They [will] be steadfast and will stand loyal, come 
what may.”

Cadmus’s painting shows a variety of relationships between a wide range of 
people. The relationships have varying degrees of passion and intensity. A 
heterosexual couple is at the centre of the painting, but on the left there are 
scenes of largely homosexual love. The painting also seems to feature 
interracial pairings in the background. Some of the people are drawing, some 
couples wrap their arms around each other, while others laze about with their 
infants.

Reader Bochi believes the luxury of the painting’s settings indicates a form 
of passion that could not have been displayed in human form during the 
Victorian era. In contrast with the softness of the couple’s faces, the 
surroundings are sharply defined and the painter’s hands are shown in great 
detail. Bochi says: “The artist can’t help but hold his new bride’s hand, even 
while he sketches a new work.”

In this piece Hockney depicts long-time lovers Isherwood and Bachardy sitting 
near each other. The romantic implications of the painting are subtle, but the 
soft and comfortable atmosphere gives the feel that this is a couple that has 
been together for many years. When Hockney made, this painting Isherwood and 
Bachardy had been together for 15 years; they remained together until 
Isherwood’s death.

While this work is not a painting, readers argued it deserved a spot in the 
top 10. The sculpture depicts lovers Paolo and Francesca, made famous by 
Dante’s Inferno: the 13th-century noblewoman fell in love with her husband’s 
younger brother and they were killed for the affair. In the sculpture, the 
lovers are entwined in each other’s arms, but their lips do not touch. Reader 
Palfreyman says nothing compares to the romance of the statue: “I spent an hour 
slowly walking around it, soaking up the love and passion that seemed to 
radiate from it.”

Elizabeth Siddal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/aug/21/art.fashion> was featured 
prominently in Rossetti’s early works, but this particular piece marked a new 
style. Rossetti began work on the piece shortly after he and Siddal married. 
The title means “the Queen of Hearts” in Latin. Rossetti would later reprise 
the Queen of Hearts theme when textile manufacturer John Aldam Heaton 
commissioned him to make a painting of his wifein the same guise

Although Caravaggio’s painting does not display romantic love, several readers 
expressed dismay at the lack of his works on the list. Romantic love may be 
missing from this piece, but a love of wine certainly is not. The painting 
shows Bacchus in a somewhat seductive pose, with grapes and ivy leaves in his 
hair and a glass of red wine in his hand. Reader bangor1 says: “Love takes many 
forms for many people.”
