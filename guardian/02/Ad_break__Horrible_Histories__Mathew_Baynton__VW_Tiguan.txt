Pepephone: ‘Horse: Maximillian’ (starts at 00:03) - Spain

If the initial purpose of television advertising is to catch viewers’ 
attention then this commercial for Spanish telecoms company Pepephone should 
have no trouble clearing the first hurdle. Having aid that, in another more 
literal sense, the protagonists in this advert would very much have trouble 
clearing the first hurdle or any other hurdle... as you’ll see when you watch 
it.

VW Tiguan: ‘School Run’ (starts at 00:47) - UK

Last year’s shocking revelations about VW’s use of technology to avoid 
accurate emissions readings was one of the most humiliating episodes in 
corporate history. Finding a way back from that kind of reputational 
self-sabotage was never going to be easy. Interestingly, they’ve opted for this 
bright and breezy film rather than going for the hand-wringing approach adopted 
by the banks after 2008.

Williams Syndrome: ‘Nephew’ (starts at 01:51) - UK

The tone of this excellent awareness film for Williams Syndrome is set in the 
first moments when actor Mathew Baynton (who also wrote and co-directed it) is 
asked “How’s James Corden?” in lieu of an inquiry into his own well-being. This 
gag and those that follow aren’t merely funny, they serve as a useful metaphor 
for the difficulty of raising awareness of little-known ailments.

Optus: ‘Thorpedo Pool Cleaning’ (starts at 04:29) - Australia

This sweet piece of spoofery from Australia makes great use of charismatic 
Olympian Ian Thorpe. The man known as Thorpedo during a brief but extraordinary 
career as a swimmer has proven a breath of fresh air in the commentary box so 
it’s not entirely a surprise to discover he’s a highly capable comedy actor.
