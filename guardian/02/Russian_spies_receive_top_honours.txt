in July.

The most famous of the agents, Anna Chapman

cosmodrome in Kazakhstan this month for the launch of a Russian spaceship, 
fuelling her celebrity status at home and abroad.

FondServisBank, which works with Russian companies in the aerospace industry, 
said it had hired Chapman as its celebrity face to bring innovation to its 
information technologies.
