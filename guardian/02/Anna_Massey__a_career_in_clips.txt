Anna Massey <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/anna-massey>, who has died 
aged 73, had two distinct stages to her career: first as the innocent victim in 
the films of two master directors trying their hand at horror, and then as a 
wily, wide-eyed staple of period TV drama. Yet the two seemed absolutely 
apiece: Massey was such a singular actor, with a constant, unafraid gaze and 
keen intelligence, that looking back it's hard not to be struck by her curious 
agelessness.

Her screen debut in 1960 was as the heroine of Michael Powell's once-loathed, 
now-lauded Peeping Tom. She doesn't get much airtime in this trailer, but her 
almost bolshie naivete is startling: a clang of reality beside Carl Boehm's 
killer.

Twelve years later she accepted Alfred Hitchcock's invitation to all but 
reprise her role in "necktie murders" chiller Frenzy. This deeply disturbing 
scene highlights similarities between the characters. Yes, Babs is a 
worldly-wise cockney barmaid, but as she ascends the stairs to the flat where 
she is to meet her end, her eyes show that same misguided trust as 
sweet-natured, middle-class Helen in Peeping Tom.

A year later: a less highbrow horror, but fine nonetheless. In The Vault of 
Horror, Massey starred alongside real-life brother Daniel as a woman caught in 
a dysfunctional sibling relationship.

 … these were the highlights of Massey's early film career – a result perhaps 
of a difficulty to pigeonhole her, plus an energetic theatre career (Richard 
Eyre's 1980 production of The Cherry Orchard can be seen online).

The late-70s were a boom time for Massey on the small screen: a key role in 
The Mayor of Casterbridge (1978) oppositeAlan Bates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alan-bates> was followed by a standout turn 
as a skeletal, terrifying Mrs Danvers in Rebecca (opposite her ex-husband 
Jeremy Brett).

One of her finest hours was in the BBC adaptation of Hotel du Lac in 1986: a 
pitch-perfect performance for which she won a Bafta.

It's hard not to sense Massey might have got short shrift from the silver 
screen in recent years. But, added together, the cameos and bit parts seem 
remarkable: this was an actor game for anything, from the predictable (Miss 
Prism in 2002's The Importance of Being Earnest) …

But Massey's reputation was not dinted by such films. She was an actor you 
trusted, whose voice reverberated with good sense and that same confidence 
Powell and Hitchcock saw all those years ago. She was a veteran of the 
audiobook and of radio dramas …
