Good night and good luck

Unbelievably, we’ve made it through eight weeks, and through the last business 
day of#ausvotes 2016. Of course election day and the night of nights looms, and 
we will be covering it all live, from the sausage sizzles through the day to 
the sound and the fury of the evening of election night.Helen Davidson will 
have the day shift tomorrow, and I will be calling the results live from about 
5pm tomorrow evening until the results are known.

Given I posted a summary late today I won’t be exhaustive about Friday’s 
events.Malcolm Turnbull had a rough day, Bill Shorten had a better day. The 
campaigns have over the past 48 hours have just pushed out into the community 
to try and get their respective operations over the line. Whether that works is 
now up to you folks. Use your votes wisely and well, the only thing worse than 
democracy is the alternative.

There are many people I need to thank for the live coverage over the past two 
months. This has been a team effort. First up I want to thank the early morning 
shift:Bridie Jabour, Melissa Davey, Calla Wahlquist, Helen Davidson. I need to 
thank the woman with whom I share a brain,Gabrielle Chan, who has steered the 
Politics Live ship when I have been doing live events, or trying to record 
podcasts – and will inherit this project when I retire from live coverage after 
tomorrow night. I need to thank all the reporters who have made contributions, 
particularlyPaul Karp and Gareth Hutchens, who have put up with barked 
instructions from me with enormously good grace. There are also wonderful 
production folks in Sydney who tidy up my mess when I make it and roll 
headlines – you know who you are, and I’m grateful.

This project is nothing without Mike Bowers, who brings the narration to life 
every day with his visual storytelling. Working with him has been one of the 
great joys of my professional life. He’s worked every single day of this 
campaign, and no-one pushes himself harder to bring you the news as it happens. 
Thank you Bowers. And I couldn’t have done the last eight weeks without the 
leadership, friendship and forbearance ofLenore Taylor. There are never enough 
thank you’s in the world to cover the debt of gratitude I owe Lenore.

The biggest thanks, of course, go to the readers. Thanks you for coming every 
day in such large numbers, whether you hate read or whether you want to be part 
of a rolling conversation about national affairs in convivial spirit, you are 
all welcome. You are the reason we do it. There is no other agenda we serve in 
this operation. We’ve worked our backsides off to serve your interests, so we 
hope we’ve helped bring you the information you need. So thanks, for reading.

One more big 24 hours to go. Rest up. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow 
night.

I just saw on Sky News political editor David Speers telling colleagues that 
voters at a forum in Rooty Hill last night had no idea who the Greens leader
Richard Di Natale was, when they were shown a photograph of him.

Fortunately Pete knows exactly who Di Natale is.
Melissa Davey (@MelissaLDavey) 
Pete is thrilled to meet @RichardDiNatale <https://twitter.com/RichardDiNatale>

I’ve been avoiding election signage all day because it feels like a bridge too 
far. Today I’ve been concentrating efforts on what you absolutely need to know 
today, the information you need to help you make a decision.

You don’t really need to know about signage, but in the interests of being 
comprehensive: signage, it’s a jungle out there. That’s it really. All day I’ve 
been seeing references to various parties ripping down each other’s signs. 
Because, you know, it’s time in professional politics to go crazy with your own 
adrenalin filled outrages. The Liberals are out and about in the Sydney suburb 
of Earlwood, staking their claims.

Mind the sophomore surge

Ben Raue

Either side has a chance of winning the election on Saturday night, but the 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> is more likely 
to win if the national two-party-preferred vote is effectively a tie.

Labor, on the other hand, would need to significantly outpoll the Coalition to 
be likely to win a majority. This is in part because the personal vote of 
first-term MPs will give theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> a boost in many of its 
marginal seats.

In 2013, Tony Abbott’s Coalition won 53.5% of the vote after preferences were 
distributed. If there were a uniform swing of 3.5% in every electorate from the 
Coalition to Labor, the Coalition would win 75 seats and Labor 71. But thanks 
to a phenomenon known as “sophomore surge”, the Coalition would likely win more 
than 75 seats if they won exactly half of the two-party-preferred vote.

A majority of voters usually vote based on broad national trends – most seats 
within a state tend to swing in the same direction. But each MP also has a 
personal vote that can give them a boost above their party’s general support 
base. MPs develop personal votes for a variety of reasons. Sitting MPs are 
prominent personalities in their community. They appear regularly in local 
media and sometimes in the national media, they attend events and they will do 
a variety of campaigning outside of election time. The same is not normally 
true of their opponents.

Federal MPs also benefit from a tremendous financial advantage over their 
opponents. The federal parliament employs a number of staff for each MP, along 
with a well-resourced office. Federal MPs also have large budgets for 
communicating with their constituents. Federal MPs also play a role in 
providing government assistance to constituents.

If someone has represented their electorate for a long time, you can assume 
that their personal vote is factored in to their electorate margin. But if 
there is a change in the person who represents an area, this can lead to what 
is sometimes called a “sophomore surge”.

A first-term MP is expected to have some kind of personal vote after 
representing their electorate for three years. That personal vote didn’t exist 
at the previous election, so it wasn’t factored into the margin. Thus, you 
should expect a first-term MP to do slightly better than the national or 
statewide trend would suggest.

This effect is more substantial if they defeated an MP of the opposing party 
at the previous election. The effect isn’t quite as strong when the sitting MP 
(of either party) had retired at the last election.

Personal votes can also be a factor when a sitting MP retires. With the party 
no longer benefiting from that candidate’s personal vote, that seat will often 
see a less favourable swing for the party holding the seat.

Electoral analyst Peter Brent (who has written a lot 
<http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/mumble/index.php/theaustralian/comments/personal_votes_2013/>
 about the sophomore surge) estimates that an MP’s personal vote can be worth 
around 1-2%.

Sophomore surge is most evident when first-term governments are seeking a 
second term. If a government is in its first term, most of its marginal seats 
will be held by new MPs who are building a new personal vote. If a sophomore 
surge happens in a series of key marginal seats, it can concentrate any 
anti-government swing in least marginal areas.

Independent Tony Windsor has just been on Sky News and he rates his prospect 
of victory on Saturday night as 50-50. He ratesRob Oakeshott as having a higher 
chance, he thinks 70% prospect of Oakeshott victory in Cowper. (Just imagine if 
Oakeshott wins,Ray Hadley will explode like the Australia day fireworks 
display.)

Windsor is asked whether he’ll retreat from the political battlefield if he 
doesn’t win tomorrow night. Nope, doesn’t look like it.

Tony Windsor:

Never say never.

the prime ministerial fist in that closing submission, Mike thought we should 
zoom in given the hands were a key feature of the presentation.

Let's take stock

Okedokes, let’s take a moment to work out what’s happened today.

Sofitel Wentworth on July 1, 2016 in Sydney, Australia. Photograph: Ryan 
Pierse/Getty Images 
Malcolm Turnbull planned his final day to be a couple of breakfast television 
spots and a bit of radio, a cheer session with a bunch of fresh faced young 
Liberals at a factory somewhere, a light lope through Burwood, minus press 
conference. After fluffing on consultation fees during said breakfast 
television, guaranteeing somewhat rashly fees would not rise for patients going 
to the doctor, a press conference was convened. Fees would of course rise, if 
doctors wanted them to, the prime minister clarified, but they couldn’t 
possibly blame the freeze in the GP rebate for that. No, that was all about 
doctors wanting to charge their patients more. The PM also declared earlier in 
the day that Labor had opposed the China free trade deal, which is a complete 
fiction, but I suspect a fiction that only a pedant like me cares about 
ultimately. Doubts about health – more dangerous, even at this late stage.

Bill Shorten spent Thursday fighting through a fog, with a conventional wisdom 
descending that the election was all over bar the shouting. But the Ipsos poll, 
showing the major parties locked in a dead heat, put a surge of energy through 
the Labor campaign on the final day. Shorten hit the hustings in Martin Place 
with the Medicare rally, before sticking on health through the day. He shrugged 
off leadership questions and criticised the prime minister’s “absolute” 
guarantee that consultation fees would not rise if theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> won on Saturday as an 
untruth.

Onwards, upwards.

I just need to catch my breath for a minute before I post a summary of the 
day’s play thus far, but I stand by my view that’s a bad stumble on 
consultation fees by the prime minister today. It’s a hip pocket issue. If 
people are watching, they will have logged it. Back shortly with a stocktake 
before we push on.

Q: Prime minister, 30% of voters are set to choose an Independent or minor 
party. We have already heard many times your view on what that could lead to. 
The question is, why do you think fewer people are engaging with the major 
parties in this election particularly?

Malcolm Turnbull:

All will be revealed tomorrow night. All will be revealed tomorrow night. The 
Australian people, everyone has had a view. Everyone has had a view about what 
the Australian people think.

Tomorrow they will tell us. And they will tell us emphatically and decisively 
and I thank you all for accompanying me on this 8-week campaign, and we look 
forward to the judgement of the Australian people tomorrow.

Unbelievably, we’ve made it through eight weeks, and through the last business 
day of#ausvotes 2016. Of course election day and the night of nights looms, and 
we will be covering it all live, from the sausage sizzles through the day to 
the sound and the fury of the evening of election night.Helen Davidson will 
have the day shift tomorrow, and I will be calling the results live from about 
5pm tomorrow evening until the results are known.

Given I posted a summary late today I won’t be exhaustive about Friday’s 
events.Malcolm Turnbull had a rough day, Bill Shorten had a better day. The 
campaigns have over the past 48 hours have just pushed out into the community 
to try and get their respective operations over the line. Whether that works is 
now up to you folks. Use your votes wisely and well, the only thing worse than 
democracy is the alternative.

There are many people I need to thank for the live coverage over the past two 
months. This has been a team effort. First up I want to thank the early morning 
shift:Bridie Jabour, Melissa Davey, Calla Wahlquist, Helen Davidson. I need to 
thank the woman with whom I share a brain,Gabrielle Chan, who has steered the 
Politics Live ship when I have been doing live events, or trying to record 
podcasts – and will inherit this project when I retire from live coverage after 
tomorrow night. I need to thank all the reporters who have made contributions, 
particularlyPaul Karp and Gareth Hutchens, who have put up with barked 
instructions from me with enormously good grace. There are also wonderful 
production folks in Sydney who tidy up my mess when I make it and roll 
headlines – you know who you are, and I’m grateful.

This project is nothing without Mike Bowers, who brings the narration to life 
every day with his visual storytelling. Working with him has been one of the 
great joys of my professional life. He’s worked every single day of this 
campaign, and no-one pushes himself harder to bring you the news as it happens. 
Thank you Bowers. And I couldn’t have done the last eight weeks without the 
leadership, friendship and forbearance ofLenore Taylor. There are never enough 
thank you’s in the world to cover the debt of gratitude I owe Lenore.

The biggest thanks, of course, go to the readers. Thanks you for coming every 
day in such large numbers, whether you hate read or whether you want to be part 
of a rolling conversation about national affairs in convivial spirit, you are 
all welcome. You are the reason we do it. There is no other agenda we serve in 
this operation. We’ve worked our backsides off to serve your interests, so we 
hope we’ve helped bring you the information you need. So thanks, for reading.

One more big 24 hours to go. Rest up. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow 
night.
 
I think we are almost there folks. I’ll post a summary next.
 
I just saw on Sky News political editor David Speers telling colleagues that 
voters at a forum in Rooty Hill last night had no idea who the Greens leader
Richard Di Natale was, when they were shown a photograph of him.

Fortunately Pete knows exactly who Di Natale is.

I’ve been avoiding election signage all day because it feels like a bridge too 
far. Today I’ve been concentrating efforts on what you absolutely need to know 
today, the information you need to help you make a decision.

You don’t really need to know about signage, but in the interests of being 
comprehensive: signage, it’s a jungle out there. That’s it really. All day I’ve 
been seeing references to various parties ripping down each other’s signs. 
Because, you know, it’s time in professional politics to go crazy with your own 
adrenalin filled outrages. The Liberals are out and about in the Sydney suburb 
of Earlwood, staking their claims.

Either side has a chance of winning the election on Saturday night, but the 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> is more likely 
to win if the national two-party-preferred vote is effectively a tie.

Labor, on the other hand, would need to significantly outpoll the Coalition to 
be likely to win a majority. This is in part because the personal vote of 
first-term MPs will give theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> a boost in many of its 
marginal seats.

In 2013, Tony Abbott’s Coalition won 53.5% of the vote after preferences were 
distributed. If there were a uniform swing of 3.5% in every electorate from the 
Coalition to Labor, the Coalition would win 75 seats and Labor 71. But thanks 
to a phenomenon known as “sophomore surge”, the Coalition would likely win more 
than 75 seats if they won exactly half of the two-party-preferred vote.

A majority of voters usually vote based on broad national trends – most seats 
within a state tend to swing in the same direction. But each MP also has a 
personal vote that can give them a boost above their party’s general support 
base. MPs develop personal votes for a variety of reasons. Sitting MPs are 
prominent personalities in their community. They appear regularly in local 
media and sometimes in the national media, they attend events and they will do 
a variety of campaigning outside of election time. The same is not normally 
true of their opponents.

Federal MPs also benefit from a tremendous financial advantage over their 
opponents. The federal parliament employs a number of staff for each MP, along 
with a well-resourced office. Federal MPs also have large budgets for 
communicating with their constituents. Federal MPs also play a role in 
providing government assistance to constituents.

If someone has represented their electorate for a long time, you can assume 
that their personal vote is factored in to their electorate margin. But if 
there is a change in the person who represents an area, this can lead to what 
is sometimes called a “sophomore surge”.

A first-term MP is expected to have some kind of personal vote after 
representing their electorate for three years. That personal vote didn’t exist 
at the previous election, so it wasn’t factored into the margin. Thus, you 
should expect a first-term MP to do slightly better than the national or 
statewide trend would suggest.

This effect is more substantial if they defeated an MP of the opposing party 
at the previous election. The effect isn’t quite as strong when the sitting MP 
(of either party) had retired at the last election.

Personal votes can also be a factor when a sitting MP retires. With the party 
no longer benefiting from that candidate’s personal vote, that seat will often 
see a less favourable swing for the party holding the seat.

Electoral analyst Peter Brent (who has written a lot 
<http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/mumble/index.php/theaustralian/comments/personal_votes_2013/>
 about the sophomore surge) estimates that an MP’s personal vote can be worth 
around 1-2%.

Sophomore surge is most evident when first-term governments are seeking a 
second term. If a government is in its first term, most of its marginal seats 
will be held by new MPs who are building a new personal vote. If a sophomore 
surge happens in a series of key marginal seats, it can concentrate any 
anti-government swing in least marginal areas.

Independent Tony Windsor has just been on Sky News and he rates his prospect 
of victory on Saturday night as 50-50. He ratesRob Oakeshott as having a higher 
chance, he thinks 70% prospect of Oakeshott victory in Cowper. (Just imagine if 
Oakeshott wins,Ray Hadley will explode like the Australia day fireworks 
display.)

Windsor is asked whether he’ll retreat from the political battlefield if he 
doesn’t win tomorrow night. Nope, doesn’t look like it.

Tony Windsor:

Never say never.
 
Good afternoon to Mike Bowers, who has caught the caravan now. We saw lots of 
the prime ministerial fist in that closing submission, Mike thought we should 
zoom in given the hands were a key feature of the presentation.

Okedokes, let’s take a moment to work out what’s happened today.

Sofitel Wentworth on July 1, 2016 in Sydney, Australia. Photograph: Ryan 
Pierse/Getty Images 
Malcolm Turnbull planned his final day to be a couple of breakfast television 
spots and a bit of radio, a cheer session with a bunch of fresh faced young 
Liberals at a factory somewhere, a light lope through Burwood, minus press 
conference. After fluffing on consultation fees during said breakfast 
television, guaranteeing somewhat rashly fees would not rise for patients going 
to the doctor, a press conference was convened. Fees would of course rise, if 
doctors wanted them to, the prime minister clarified, but they couldn’t 
possibly blame the freeze in the GP rebate for that. No, that was all about 
doctors wanting to charge their patients more. The PM also declared earlier in 
the day that Labor had opposed the China free trade deal, which is a complete 
fiction, but I suspect a fiction that only a pedant like me cares about 
ultimately. Doubts about health – more dangerous, even at this late stage.

Bill Shorten spent Thursday fighting through a fog, with a conventional wisdom 
descending that the election was all over bar the shouting. But the Ipsos poll, 
showing the major parties locked in a dead heat, put a surge of energy through 
the Labor campaign on the final day. Shorten hit the hustings in Martin Place 
with the Medicare rally, before sticking on health through the day. He shrugged 
off leadership questions and criticised the prime minister’s “absolute” 
guarantee that consultation fees would not rise if theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> won on Saturday as an 
untruth.

Onwards, upwards.
 
Actually while I’m gathering, let me share our final podcast episode for the 
campaign. This episode is quick final thoughts, some on the road reflections 
fromMike Bowers, and a primer for things to watch on Saturday night when you 
are having your election parties.

We will record another episode over this weekend, once the results are known. 
Enjoy!
 
I just need to catch my breath for a minute before I post a summary of the 
day’s play thus far, but I stand by my view that’s a bad stumble on 
consultation fees by the prime minister today. It’s a hip pocket issue. If 
people are watching, they will have logged it. Back shortly with a stocktake 
before we push on.
 
Q: Prime minister, 30% of voters are set to choose an Independent or minor 
party. We have already heard many times your view on what that could lead to. 
The question is, why do you think fewer people are engaging with the major 
parties in this election particularly?
