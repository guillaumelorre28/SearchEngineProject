Banks are leading the market higher after the German constitutional court 
ruled in favour of the proposed eurozone bailout fund, albeit with expected 
conditions.

Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 9p to 273.7p as Liberum Capital issued a buy 
note on the bank, following positive noises from JP Morgan Cazenove earlier in 
the week.

Liberum raised its target price from 260p to 270p and said the European 
Central Bank's bond buying plan unveiled last week would imply a lower risk for 
RBS's Irish assets. Analyst Cormac Leech said:
 While £39bn of Republic of Ireland assets still imply obvious credit risk 
(particularly if Ireland's 'bank-friendly' bankruptcy laws are reformed), the 
share price already reflects an adequate margin of safety in our view. We see 
further upside as/when the Eurozone shifts towards a more pro-growth fiscal 
strategy. If Eurozone integrity were assured, we estimate a fair value/share of 
around 310p.

Liberum said the proposed flotation of Direct Line in the fourth quarter would 
also be a positive catalyst, as would a potential disposal of Citizens in the 
US for some $12bn.

Other banks have benefited from the positive news from the eurozone, with 
Lloyds Banking Group 1.25p higher at 38.315p - a new 52 week peak - and Barclays
 4.8p better at 218.3p.

Overall, after a weak start, the FTSE 100 has climbed 14.91 points to 5807.10 
after the German news and better than expected UK unemployment figures.

Accountancy software firm Sage has added 7p to 312.8p on renewed takeover 
talk, with speculation of a 450p-a-share offer from private equity. Germany's 
SAP and Microsoft have previously been mentioned as potential predators.

Kingfisher recovered from early falls following a disappointing update

and is now unchanged at 272.3p.

Icap, whose ejection from the FTSE 100 is likely to be confirmed after the 
market closes, has fallen 5.7p to 332.5p following Morgan Stanley cutting its 
rating from equal weight to underweight. The bank said:
 We see risks to market expectations as we believe estimates are not 
calibrated for recent volume weakness and likely recovery pace given ongoing 
cyclical headwinds from low rates/foreign exchange volumes. 
Fellow demotee Ashmore has added 7.5p to 338.5p, however.

Admiral is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 26p to £10.93 as the shares went 
ex-dividend.
