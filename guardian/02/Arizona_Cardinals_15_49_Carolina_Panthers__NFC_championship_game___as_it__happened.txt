The Panthers are NFC Champions!

Final score: Panthers 49-15 Cardinals. I’d love to say it was a good game, but 
it was not.

We’ll have Panthers-Broncos, CAM VS. PEYTON !!! in two weeks. 

Thanks for following the live blog!

Panthers 49-15 Cardinals, 2:00, 4th quarter

The Panthers have the ball, so Carson Palmer hasn’t thrown an interception. In

Palmer picked! Again!

4:30 left. And Palmer has thrown another interception. Really. This is not an 
accidental re-post.

Touchdown! Panthers 49-15 Cardinals, 5:11, 4th quarter

Carson Palmer and the Cardinals start their drive at the 13 ... and Palmer 
quickly ended it on the first play with a pick-six to Luke Kuechly.


This Carson Palmer performance will go down in bad history.

Touchdown! Panthers 42-15 Cardinals

Newton hits Devin Funchess on a slant for a 5-yard TD. 

This game has not been very Funchess for the Cardinals. (I was trying for a 
pun that’s as bad as Arizona has been in this game. Really! Honest.)

Newton then hit Tolbert for a 2-point conversion because you don’t want the 
Cardinals to get within 27 points with just 5:26 left, obviously.

Panthers 34-15 Cardinals, 6:00, 4th quarter

Newton ran the ball to get the Panthers 1st and goal and then dabbed. (In case 
you’re worried I haven’t given you enough dabbing updates.)

Panthers 34-15 Cardinals, 9:30, 4th quarter

Panthers are down to Arizona’s 23 already after a 54-yard pass to Greg Olsen. 

The 34-15 score is actually misleadingly close.

Another! Carson! Palmer! Interception!

11:38 left in the game, Palmer has his fourth turnover, this one forced deep 
into the end zone with two Panthers defenders on John Brown.

That’s the second pick by Kurt Coleman. And the disaster continues for Carson 
Palmer.

Panthers 34-15 Cardinals, 11:48, 4th quarter

Cardinals had 3rd and 10 at midfield after two near-INTs by Carson Palmer, but 
will now have a 1st down at the Carolina 44 thanks to defensive holding. Tick

Touchdown! Panthers 34-15 Cardinals

Carson Palmer found Darren Fells across the middle for a 21-yard TD. Then JJ 
Nelson took a handoff for a 2-point conversion ... Arizona’s first 2-point 
conversion attempt of the season. Hey, they’re 100% on the year!

Panthers 34-7 Cardinals, 1:10, 3rd quarter

Arizona has a first down out to their 35 on a catch by Larry Fitzgerald. 
Fitzgerald dropped the pass just before that. Thankfully he redeemed himself, 
or someone was going to have to stop the fight.

Touchdown! Panthers 34-7.

On 3rd and 10 from the 23, Newton saw no one open and took on the Arizona 
defense himself and picked up a 1st down.


Then he ran it in from the 13 on the very next play, leaping into the endzone 
for extra style points.

The game is over. 

Please feel free to stick around for whatever I put up in here for the next 
hour, though! Thanks!

Panthers 27-7 Cardinals, 4:15, 3rd quarter

Carolina is down to Arizona’s 40 after a 39-yard pass to Ted Ginn. 

The crowd is as quiet as you’d expect it to be if this game was being played 
in Arizona. This game is so one-sided, the Panthers are boring their own fans.

Arizona goes three-and-out after Fitzgerald drops a catchable ball on 3rd

Field goal! Panthers 27-7 Cardinals.

Gano knocks one through from 21 yards. The Cardinals have 22:50 left to save 
their season. A point a minute and you’ll be fine, boys.

Panthers 24-7 Cardinals, 9:59, 3rd quarter

First and goal now after a 14-yard reception to Mike Tolbert. Watching Mike 
Tolbert run in open space is a delight, I don’t care who you’re rooting for.

Panthers 24-7 Cardinals, 12:07, 3rd quarter

The Panthers are already down to Arizona’s 28. Newton and Olsen just hooked up 
on a 29-yard pass. This drive is exactly what Arizona didn’t need. Well, this 
and not having the first half wiped from history.

The second half is underway!

Carolina opens with the ball and at their own 17. 

Panthers LB Thomas Davis is now OUT for the rest of the game with a right arm 
injury.

Bruce Arians said Carson Palmer can’t make throws like he did in the first 
half. He’s only a 36-year old, 13-year veteran, Bruce. Give the man some time 
to develop.

The Panthers have a big lead, but it’s important they don’t call plays with 
their “butt tight” in the second half.

Halftime! Panthers 24-7

Arizona’s defense kept trying to turn the momentum late in the 2nd quarter and 
did it. Twice. But Carson Palmer would have none of it.

At the half, he’s 9-for-17 for 86 yards, an interception and two lost fumbles.

Yikes. Carson Palmer gives it right back.

With less than a minute left in the half and Arizona set up deep in Carolina 
territory after Patrick Peterson’s 72-yard return ... Palmer turns it over 
again with an awful pick into the end zone.

This has to be up there with the worst QB performances in conference title 
game history.

Patrick Peterson just picked off the passer.

Palmer fumbled again. Carolina gets the ball with 1:47 left in the half at 
Arizona’s 31. Yikes.

I’m not a Panthers fan. I don’t intend to show bias. I don’t believe I’m 
showing any more bias than the scoreboard is. One team is playing well, the 
other is awful.

Oh, hey! Another Carson Palmer fumble!

Touchdown! Panthers 24-7!

Cam Newton took the snap, took two steps and leaped up over the line and 
extended the ball across the line.

I didn’t see if he dabbed after the score, however. I’m sorry for failing in 
my journalistic duties.

Two-minute warning! 

Carolina is still at the 1-yard line on 3rd down after the wonderfully and 
effectively portly Mike Tolbert and Stewart got stopped on back-to-back runs. 
We’ll find out after the break exactly how big Arizona’s deficit will be at the 
half.

Panthers 17-7 Cardinals, 4:38, 2nd quarter

On Carolina’s first play after the turnover, Patrick Peterson hold Ginn to 
give Carolina 5 more yards. Peterson is usually a playmaker, just not in this 
way.

TURNOVER! Arizona's Patrick Peterson muffed the punt catch.

Carolina gets the ball right back on Arizona’s 46. 

Yes, muffed. It’s tough-guy football term.

Panthers 17-7 Cardinals, 5:28, 2nd quarter

Panthers will get the ball at the 20 after the kickoff sails through the end 
zone.

Carolina linebacker Thomas Davis is getting x-rays on his right forearm after 
Fells slammed into him on the TE’s reception last drive. Momentum is heading 
the direction of the tiny, red songbirds.

Panthers 17-0 Cardinals, 7:28, 2nd quarter

Another Arizona first down, down to the 13, on a completion to TE Darren Fells 
on crossing pattern. Palmer is now 7 for his last 9. Forget my “direct snap to 
David Johnson idea,” I guess.

Panthers 17-0 Cardinals, 8:57, 2nd quarter

Another big run by David Johnson gets Arizona down to Carolina’s 28. Johnson 
has 80 total yards now.

Maybe it’s time to bypass Palmer completely and just direct snap to Johnson?

Huge conversion by Arizona on 3rd-and-11 from their own 20. Palmer hits J.J. 
Nelson out to the 35. Arizona’s defense is getting its longest rest of the

Okay ... time for some horrible pre-draft Cam Newton analysis!
Pete Prisco (@PriscoCBS) 
After breaking down Christian Ponder and Cam Newton on tape, I would take 
Ponder over Newton. That's just me. '

Long term give me Josh Freeman over Cam. Better leader, more consistent 
passer, more clutch, more poised under fire, more careful with ball.

Palmer’s fumble was reviewed ... and the fumble stands. 

Winning a review was probably Arizona’s best chance to win something today.

Turnover! Carson Palmer fumbles.

Luke Kuechly scoops up the fumble and Carolina continues its domination. 

Anyone who didn’t buy into the idea that Carson Palmer had transformed into a 
legit top-tier QB late in his career, you are looking wise. Congrats.

Panthers 49-15 Cardinals, 2:00, 4th quarter

The Panthers have the ball, so Carson Palmer hasn’t thrown an interception. In 
case you were waiting for the next Carson turnover update.
 
4:30 left. And Palmer has thrown another interception. Really. This is not an 
accidental re-post.
 
A Panthers fan was so excited by that touchdown that he/she fell out of the

Carson Palmer and the Cardinals start their drive at the 13 ... and Palmer 
quickly ended it on the first play with a pick-six to Luke Kuechly.


This Carson Palmer performance will go down in bad history. 
 
And the Cardinals hit a new low point in this game:

Newton hits Devin Funchess on a slant for a 5-yard TD. 

This game has not been very Funchess for the Cardinals. (I was trying for a 
pun that’s as bad as Arizona has been in this game. Really! Honest.)

Newton then hit Tolbert for a 2-point conversion because you don’t want the 
Cardinals to get within 27 points with just 5:26 left, obviously.
 
Panthers 34-15 Cardinals, 6:00, 4th quarter

Newton ran the ball to get the Panthers 1st and goal and then dabbed. (In case 
you’re worried I haven’t given you enough dabbing updates.)
 
Panthers 34-15 Cardinals, 9:30, 4th quarter

Panthers are down to Arizona’s 23 already after a 54-yard pass to Greg Olsen. 

The 34-15 score is actually misleadingly close.

11:38 left in the game, Palmer has his fourth turnover, this one forced deep 
into the end zone with two Panthers defenders on John Brown.

That’s the second pick by Kurt Coleman. And the disaster continues for Carson 
Palmer.
 
Panthers 34-15 Cardinals, 11:48, 4th quarter

Cardinals had 3rd and 10 at midfield after two near-INTs by Carson Palmer, but 
will now have a 1st down at the Carolina 44 thanks to defensive holding. Tick 
tick tick.
 
Panthers 34-15 Cardinals, 12:58, 4th quarter

Panthers go three-and-out and the Cardinals will get the ball back. Hey,

Panthers 34-7 Cardinals, 1:10, 3rd quarter

Arizona has a first down out to their 35 on a catch by Larry Fitzgerald. 
Fitzgerald dropped the pass just before that. Thankfully he redeemed himself,

On 3rd and 10 from the 23, Newton saw no one open and took on the Arizona 
defense himself and picked up a 1st down.


Then he ran it in from the 13 on the very next play, leaping into the endzone 
for extra style points.

The game is over. 

Please feel free to stick around for whatever I put up in here for the next 
hour, though! Thanks!

Carolina is down to Arizona’s 40 after a 39-yard pass to Ted Ginn. 

The crowd is as quiet as you’d expect it to be if this game was being played 
in Arizona. This game is so one-sided, the Panthers are boring their own fans.

First and goal now after a 14-yard reception to Mike Tolbert. Watching Mike 
Tolbert run in open space is a delight, I don’t care who you’re rooting for.
 
Panthers 24-7 Cardinals, 12:07, 3rd quarter

The Panthers are already down to Arizona’s 28. Newton and Olsen just hooked up 
on a 29-yard pass. This drive is exactly what Arizona didn’t need. Well, this 
and not having the first half wiped from history.
 
Carolina opens with the ball and at their own 17. 

Panthers LB Thomas Davis is now OUT for the rest of the game with a right arm 
injury.

Bruce Arians said Carson Palmer can’t make throws like he did in the first 
half. He’s only a 36-year old, 13-year veteran, Bruce. Give the man some time 
to develop.
 
The Panthers have a big lead, but it’s important they don’t call plays with 
their “butt tight” in the second half.

Arizona’s defense kept trying to turn the momentum late in the 2nd quarter and 
did it. Twice. But Carson Palmer would have none of it.

At the half, he’s 9-for-17 for 86 yards, an interception and two lost fumbles.
 
With less than a minute left in the half and Arizona set up deep in Carolina 
territory after Patrick Peterson’s 72-yard return ... Palmer turns it over 
again with an awful pick into the end zone.

This has to be up there with the worst QB performances in conference title 
game history.
 
Patrick Peterson just picked off the passer. 

Try to say that five times fast. 
 
Palmer fumbled again. Carolina gets the ball with 1:47 left in the half at 
Arizona’s 31. Yikes.

I’m not a Panthers fan. I don’t intend to show bias. I don’t believe I’m 
showing any more bias than the scoreboard is. One team is playing well, the 
other is awful.

Oh, hey! Another Carson Palmer fumble! 
 
Cam Newton took the snap, took two steps and leaped up over the line and 
extended the ball across the line.

I didn’t see if he dabbed after the score, however. I’m sorry for failing in 
my journalistic duties.
 
Two-minute warning! 

Carolina is still at the 1-yard line on 3rd down after the wonderfully and 
effectively portly Mike Tolbert and Stewart got stopped on back-to-back runs. 
We’ll find out after the break exactly how big Arizona’s deficit will be at the 
half.
 
Panthers 17-7 Cardinals, 3:55, 2nd quarter

Back-to-back long runs by Johnathan Stewart puts Carolina at the 1-yard line. 
Peterson made the tackle at the 1, though! Progress!
 
Panthers 17-7 Cardinals, 4:38, 2nd quarter

On Carolina’s first play after the turnover, Patrick Peterson hold Ginn to 
give Carolina 5 more yards. Peterson is usually a playmaker, just not in this 
way.
 
Carolina gets the ball right back on Arizona’s 46. 

Yes, muffed. It’s tough-guy football term.
 
Panthers 17-7 Cardinals, 5:54, 2nd quarter

And that’s a three-and-out for the Panthers. Newton missed a wide open Fozzy 
Whittaker down the right sideline.
 
Panthers 17-7 Cardinals, 5:28, 2nd quarter

Panthers will get the ball at the 20 after the kickoff sails through the end 
zone.

Carolina linebacker Thomas Davis is getting x-rays on his right forearm after 
Fells slammed into him on the TE’s reception last drive. Momentum is heading 
the direction of the tiny, red songbirds.
 
David Johnson plunges through the middle to finish off a 10-play, 79-yard 
drive. Johnson now has 58 rushing yards on 13 carries.

Game on! Great news for liveblog traffic! 
 
Panthers 17-0 Cardinals, 7:28, 2nd quarter

Another Arizona first down, down to the 13, on a completion to TE Darren Fells 
on crossing pattern. Palmer is now 7 for his last 9. Forget my “direct snap to 
David Johnson idea,” I guess.
 
Panthers 17-0 Cardinals, 8:57, 2nd quarter

Another big run by David Johnson gets Arizona down to Carolina’s 28. Johnson 
has 80 total yards now.

Maybe it’s time to bypass Palmer completely and just direct snap to Johnson? 
 
Panthers 17-0 Cardinals, 10:00, 2nd quarter

Huge conversion by Arizona on 3rd-and-11 from their own 20. Palmer hits J.J. 
Nelson out to the 35. Arizona’s defense is getting its longest rest of the 
night.
 
Okay ... time for some horrible pre-draft Cam Newton analysis!

Great work by everyone. 
 
Panthers 17-0 Cardinals, 11:57, 2nd quarter

Carolina goes three-and-out after Palmer’s fumble and will be punting from 
their own 37.
 
Palmer’s fumble was reviewed ... and the fumble stands. 

Winning a review was probably Arizona’s best chance to win something today. 
Too bad.
 
Luke Kuechly scoops up the fumble and Carolina continues its domination. 

Anyone who didn’t buy into the idea that Carson Palmer had transformed into a 
legit top-tier QB late in his career, you are looking wise. Congrats.
 
Panthers 17-0 Cardinals, 13:35, 2nd quarter

Arizona has 1st down at Carolina’s 37 after a great run for 24 yards by David 
Johnson.

The last four NFC champions won after trailing at the end of the 1st quarter.
