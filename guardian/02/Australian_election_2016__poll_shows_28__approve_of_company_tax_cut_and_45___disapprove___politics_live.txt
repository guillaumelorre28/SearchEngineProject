Given the campaigns are in bed, let's say farewell for this evening

I think we’ll pull up stumps for today. Let’s take stock.

 * Malcolm Turnbull stepped outside his campaign to visit flood effected areas 
in NSW, but he did manage to tie up the question of the third election debate. 
Would it be a Sky News people’s forum in Brisbane tomorrow night or would it be 
something else? Something else was the verdict. Turnbull said the next 
head-to-head of the campaign would be online, hosted by news.com and Facebook, 
because he wasn’t going to respond to “decrees” from Sky News. Presumably it’s 
ok to make decrees yourself. Call that a benefit of Lodge occupation.

 * Bill Shorten did think the day would be about the economy and apprentices 
and it was for him until he relocated for the flood tour in the afternoon. 
Shorten grabbed the opportunity of the third debate and also banked the Sky 
appearance tomorrow night, because .. birds in hand. It would be aninsult to 
Queenslanders to do anything else was the rationale.

 * The latest opinion poll shows the campaign still locked in a dead heat. The 
prime minister has gone backwards in terms of voter perceptions,Bill Shorten 
has gone both forward and backwards, because nothing is ever simple, is it? 
Here, for the record, are the primary votes for the combatants at the campaign 
mid-point – noteNick Xenophon who is just under half way to Greens levels and 
independents are on 10%. (Liberal/National 41%; Labor 36%; Greens 10%;Nick 
Xenophon Team 4%; Other/Independent 10%.)

 * Speaking of Xenophon, he must be completely delighted by the attention he’s 
getting this campaign. You can take that as a comment.

Thanks for your company throughout the day. Let’s resume in the morning.

Bill Shorten is speaking to reporters now.

It sometimes takes a disaster to bring out the best in people but I’ve got no 
doubt that what we will see here is, this club will rebuild, and damaged 
communities right through Australia will rebuild.

He’s repeating the emergency services advice: stay away from rising water.

Bill Shorten:

Do not enter these flooded rivers and water courses and creeks. The current 
can be deceptive. Once a vehicle loses traction with the ground it becomes a 
diabolical trap. People must listen to the experts. There is nothing so 
important or so timely that you can’t afford to wait. We don’t want to see any 
more people lost to this terrible weather. Please, we have got the SES, they 
are not there just for the sake of it. If they give you good advice, please 
follow it.

Attitudes to the leaders. Interesting, this. Malcolm Turnbull going backwards, 
Bill Shorten polarising voters.

 * 33% of the survey say they have become less favourable toward Malcolm 
Turnbull over the last few weeks and 7% say they have become more favourable.

 * While most (65%) Liberal voters say they have not changed their opinion, 
19% say they have become less favourable.

 * 20% say they have become more favourable toward Bill Shorten over the last 
few weeks and 21% say they have become less favourable.

 * 42% of Labor voters have become more favourable and 6% less favourable.

This is also mildly interesting. Who do you trust to better handle a range of 
issues. The ALP have picked up on two of the Coalition’s core issues over the 
course of the campaign.

 * The Liberal party is trusted more to handle security and the war on 
terrorism (+18), management of the economy (+12) and controlling interest rates 
(+12).

 * The Labor Party is trusted more to handle ensuring a quality education 
(+14%) and ensuring the quality of the health system (+13).

 * Since this question was asked last month, Labor has improved its position 
on management of the economy (up 8) and security and the war on terrorism (up 
5).

Let’s look at the new Essential poll 
<http://www.essentialvision.com.au/category/essentialreport/page/2> which has 
landed this afternoon. We can start with the company tax cuts.

 * 28% approve of the Coalition’s tax cuts to medium and large business and 
45% disapprove. 
The government has repositioned on the tax cuts significantly. The reposition 
began at the leaders’ debate at the National Press Club: now the policy is 
being dressed up as a small business boost, with the benefits to big business 
to flow waaaaay waaaaay off in the distance.

Yes, Malcolm, you Queensland insulter

Labor CHQ has issued a statement about the Facebook/news.com debate.

Bill Shorten is having his cake and eating it too: stage all to himself in 
Brisbane, another debate opportunity with Turnbull, and a slap to the prime 
minister on the way through.

Bill Shorten:

I’m happy to debate Mr Turnbull anytime, anywhere. But if he doesn’t front up 
at the people’s forum tomorrow, he is turning his back on Queenslanders – plain 
and simple. He’s been in hiding from voters this election, refusing to justify 
his plans for a tax handout for big business and cuts to schools and Medicare. 
If he doesn’t turn up tomorrow, it’s an insult to Queenslanders.

I think we’ll pull up stumps for today. Let’s take stock.
 The Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at a press conference Picton NSW after he 
had seen the flood damage for himself this afternoon, Tuesday 7th June 2016. 
Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian 
 * Malcolm Turnbull stepped outside his campaign to visit flood effected areas 
in NSW, but he did manage to tie up the question of the third election debate. 
Would it be a Sky News people’s forum in Brisbane tomorrow night or would it be 
something else? Something else was the verdict. Turnbull said the next 
head-to-head of the campaign would be online, hosted by news.com and Facebook, 
because he wasn’t going to respond to “decrees” from Sky News. Presumably it’s 
ok to make decrees yourself. Call that a benefit of Lodge occupation.

 * Bill Shorten did think the day would be about the economy and apprentices 
and it was for him until he relocated for the flood tour in the afternoon. 
Shorten grabbed the opportunity of the third debate and also banked the Sky 
appearance tomorrow night, because .. birds in hand. It would be aninsult to 
Queenslanders to do anything else was the rationale.

 * The latest opinion poll shows the campaign still locked in a dead heat. The 
prime minister has gone backwards in terms of voter perceptions,Bill Shorten 
has gone both forward and backwards, because nothing is ever simple, is it? 
Here, for the record, are the primary votes for the combatants at the campaign 
mid-point – noteNick Xenophon who is just under half way to Greens levels and 
independents are on 10%. (Liberal/National 41%; Labor 36%; Greens 10%;Nick 
Xenophon Team 4%; Other/Independent 10%.)

 * Speaking of Xenophon, he must be completely delighted by the attention he’s 
getting this campaign. You can take that as a comment.

Thanks for your company throughout the day. Let’s resume in the morning.
 
Bill Shorten is speaking to reporters now.

It sometimes takes a disaster to bring out the best in people but I’ve got no 
doubt that what we will see here is, this club will rebuild, and damaged 
communities right through Australia will rebuild.

He’s repeating the emergency services advice: stay away from rising water.

Bill Shorten:

Do not enter these flooded rivers and water courses and creeks. The current 
can be deceptive. Once a vehicle loses traction with the ground it becomes a 
diabolical trap. People must listen to the experts. There is nothing so 
important or so timely that you can’t afford to wait. We don’t want to see any 
more people lost to this terrible weather. Please, we have got the SES, they 
are not there just for the sake of it. If they give you good advice, please 
follow it.
 
The Labor leader has made it to Sydney this afternoon.

Attitudes to the leaders. Interesting, this. Malcolm Turnbull going backwards, 
Bill Shorten polarising voters.

 * 33% of the survey say they have become less favourable toward Malcolm 
Turnbull over the last few weeks and 7% say they have become more favourable.

 * While most (65%) Liberal voters say they have not changed their opinion, 
19% say they have become less favourable.

 * 20% say they have become more favourable toward Bill Shorten over the last 
few weeks and 21% say they have become less favourable.

 * 42% of Labor voters have become more favourable and 6% less favourable.

This is also mildly interesting. Who do you trust to better handle a range of 
issues. The ALP have picked up on two of the Coalition’s core issues over the 
course of the campaign.

 * The Liberal party is trusted more to handle security and the war on 
terrorism (+18), management of the economy (+12) and controlling interest rates 
(+12).

 * The Labor Party is trusted more to handle ensuring a quality education 
(+14%) and ensuring the quality of the health system (+13).

 * Since this question was asked last month, Labor has improved its position 
on management of the economy (up 8) and security and the war on terrorism (up 
5).
 
Let’s look at the new Essential poll 
<http://www.essentialvision.com.au/category/essentialreport/page/2> which has 
landed this afternoon. We can start with the company tax cuts.

 * 28% approve of the Coalition’s tax cuts to medium and large business and 
45% disapprove. 
The government has repositioned on the tax cuts significantly. The reposition 
began at the leaders’ debate at the National Press Club: now the policy is 
being dressed up as a small business boost, with the benefits to big business 
to flow waaaaay waaaaay off in the distance.
 
Suspect being crashed by BuzzFeed was not part of the campaign plan.
 
It looks like the prime minister is now back in Sydney, at Watson’s Bay.

I’m so for the future it’s not funny, I’m a paid up member of the virtual 
world, that’s a given – but all the Facebook live streams I’ve seen this 
campaign have been buggy as anything.#JustSaying
 
Labor CHQ has issued a statement about the Facebook/news.com debate.

Bill Shorten is having his cake and eating it too: stage all to himself in 
Brisbane, another debate opportunity with Turnbull, and a slap to the prime 
minister on the way through.

Bill Shorten:

I’m happy to debate Mr Turnbull anytime, anywhere. But if he doesn’t front up 
at the people’s forum tomorrow, he is turning his back on Queenslanders – plain 
and simple. He’s been in hiding from voters this election, refusing to justify 
his plans for a tax handout for big business and cuts to schools and Medicare. 
If he doesn’t turn up tomorrow, it’s an insult to Queenslanders.
