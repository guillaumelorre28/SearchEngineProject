In 2012 husband and wife Grahame Penny and Maggie Taylor paid £500,000 for one 
of Britain’s few private toll bridges, crossing the River Wye in Herefordshire. 
At the time it was making around £65,000 a year, but after costs there was 
little left for its owners.

Nearly four years on, things look a lot brighter: this year’s turnover is 
forecast to reach £120,000 and the couple estimates that the operating profit 
will be in the region of £75,000. But that only tells part of the story because 
the bridge comes with a remarkable bonus. The 1780 and 1797 Acts of Parliament 
that granted permission for the bridge also gave its owners exemption from all 
taxes – which means the profit is completely tax-free.


What’s more, the bridge also comes with a two-bedroom house and just under two 
acres of grounds and river frontage in countryside just outside Hay-on-Wye, 
famous for its book festival.


During the Hay festival, which is 10 days a year, we take 10% of our income

“When we sold our previous business we were too young to retire and our 
pensions wouldn’t have kicked in, so we had to do something,” says Taylor. 
“There was a great big advertorial in one of the nationals’ property sections 
about the bridge being for sale. I turned round to Grahame and said ‘We’ll buy 
that’. We knew it was going to be a challenge. It would be classed ‘a failing 
business’ and had been in probate for two years. But we knew it had potential.”


Whitney Bridge is one of only eight privately-owned toll bridges in the UK 
that are exempt from all taxes: income tax, VAT, stamp duty, capital gains tax, 
inheritance tax and business rates.


The toll fee is still governed by parliament and cannot be increased without a 
new Act being passed by the secretary of state. The last increase – taking the 
daily charge car drivers pay to cross the bridge from 80p to £1 – took effect 
at the end of June. However, regular users such as locals pay 60p or 70p, 
depending on how many tokens they buy in advance; there is also an annual pass 
costing £120.


Taylor says: “We’ve diversified and now use all the land for camping, fishing 
and canoeing, and we’ve opened up a lodge. We had a derelict shed which we 
converted into an outside kitchen, so we now do food and camping barbecues.


“The number of cars crossing we get each day is hugely seasonal. During the 
Hay festival, which is 10 days a year, we take 10% of our income. On the whole, 
though, we have around 200 crossings a day, but those aren’t independent payers 
because people cross back and forth. Yesterday we had 400 crossings, but during 
the festival it’ll be up to 1,700.”

But the toll bridge is not without its critics. “I absolutely believed people 
would love it here, that it’s a part of social history. The toll fee is nothing 
– not much more than a Mars bar – and it saves miles on petrol. People say, 
‘It’s tax-free, so why should I pay you?’ I didn’t realise there would be an 
anti-toll feeling,” says Taylor.


But she adds: “I think [buying the bridge] has been worth it; it’s part of 
social history rather than a mass money-making scheme. When we bought it, one 
of the angles the vendor was taking was that it is tax-free income and that you 
could sit back and watch the money roll in. But that’s not why we bought it. We 
bought it because it was a failing business and we could see that we could turn 
it around. It is a lifestyle business and a beautiful place to live.”


Last month the couple put the toll bridge up for sale for £850,000. Having 
accomplished what they set out to do, they say they now have their eyes on 
another unusual business which is failing but which they hope to turn around.


Despite being nearly 240 years old, the bridge has had only four owners – 
including one family who held on to it for 180 years – prompting Colliers 
International, the agents handling the sale, to claim that this is a genuine 
“once in a lifetime opportunity”.

Thirteen years ago farmer Tom Pearcy made a tentative move into the visitor 
attraction business. He turned one of his fields on the outskirts of York into 
a maize maze and watched in wonder as thousands of paying visitors flocked 
through his gates.

Back then he was charging £2.50 for admission. However, over the years the 
maze (and the maize) has grown – this year it covers 15 acres – and the 
­concept has morphed into a family day out ­costing up to £13.50 for adults and 
£12.50 for children. It’s now one of the area’s key tourist destinations and 
thought to be the largest maze of its type in Europe, attracting tens of 
­thousands of visitors from July to September (its last day this year is 7 
September).

Pearcy, who doesn’t want to divulge precise figures, says he makes seven times 
more revenue from the maze than he did farming his parents’ tenanted 400-acre 
farm, and 30 times more than in his first year of opening.

“I needed a new mental challenge – it wasn’t stimulating driving up and down 
in a tractor all day,” he says. “When I lived in Suffolk I’d seen a handmade 
sign on a roundabout which said ‘maize maze’ on it. I went to have a look and 
found a guy sat in a caravan in a field in the middle of nowhere trying to 
charge people to go around it. The concept was interesting but no one was going 
to it. My idea formulated there – that was two years before I moved back to 
York.”

He adds: “My father [a farmer] tried to persuade me not to do it. All my 
[farming] neighbours said they couldn’t understand why someone would pay to 
walk around a field, because they walk around fields all day looking at crops.

“In the first year it was very much a farm diversification. It wasn’t a 
­business, it was an idea I thought I’d give a whirl. It attracted 9,000 to 
10,000 people, which I was surprised about. The outlay wasn’t great because we 
didn’t put in any facilities. It was ­literally just a field and the standard 
cost of growing a crop.”

Pearcy says he began by charging £2.50 per person “which, it transpired, was 
hugely undervalued. I didn’t really understand what I was offering and what 
value it had, so the transition from farmer to tourist attraction has been 
huge. I’ve gone from producing a ­commodity that the market sets the price of, 
to running a business where I dictate the price.”

He adds: “The dwell time has gone up massively from when we opened. Back then 
people were probably spending an hour to an hour and a half with us. Now they 
come for around five hours, and the maze is only a small component of the day 
out. We offer activities that ­children and adults can do together. That’s 
where we score over other ­attractions – if you go to an indoor play park, the 
parents have a cup of coffee while the kids run around. What we do is 
inclusive.”

This year the maze is in the shape of the Thunderbird 2 aircraft. But it is 
weather-dependent so heavy rain ­sometimes closes the main maze.

“Turnover goes up and down ­depending on the weather,” Pearcy says. “Last year 
was fine, the year before was awful, so if you take somewhere in the middle, 
our turnover has probably gone up 30 times from the first year. I had no 
concept of what the business could do when I started out. My attitude has 
always been if it’s good fun and I enjoy doing it and it makes money, 
brilliant.”

Making money from renewable energy generated by his home has been an added 
bonus for 41-year-old architect Richard Hawkes, who designed and built his 
self-sustaining eco-friendly family house in Kent in 2008.

He and his wife, Sophie, had quit ­London with the aim of living a greener 
life. Their striking house, which they live in with their children, 
seven-year-old Oscar and Verity, five, is now so ­sustainable it has 
effectively eliminated energy bills. But it’s better than that.

“At the end of the year the running costs, including water and everything to 
do with electricity and heating (other than council tax), leaves us in net 
profit,” Hawkes says.
While annual outgoings add up to £1,350, the income they receive from 
harnessing the power of the sun totals £1,770 – which is £420 more.

“The whole idea of trying to be more sustainable and having low running costs 
obviously involves generating your own energy,” Hawkes says. “We initially­ 
didn’t explore doing solar electricity PV [photovoltaic] panels because we 
couldn’t afford them, but we decided to put our money into making the building 
as efficient as possible.

“It’s best to focus on needing as ­little energy as possible before plugging 
on technology. We installed PV thermal panels to generate electricity and hot 
water. We stored the sun’s heat in ­paraffin wax ‘phase change’ ­materials and 
generated more electricity as a byproduct of the panel cooling. As the 
temperature of the wax rises and it starts to melt, it changes phase from solid 
to liquid and takes on more energy as latent heat. It’s clever technology.”

However, Hawkes adds: “Just at the time we were building our house the 
government was talking about feed-in tariffs: getting money back for 
­generating your own energy. So we thought, we’ll put this technology in and 
get paid for it, but we got a bit short-changed. Our system was ­commissioned 
on 22 June 2009 and when the scheme came out the government said the new 
[higher rate] tariffs would only apply to systems ­commissioned after 15 July 
2009. So for the sake of three weeks our feed-in tariff, instead of being 36 
pence per unit, was 9 pence.”

The technology Hawkes installed includes a 3.4kW PV/T system (PV and thermal 
combined) that ­generates two incomes – the feed-in tariff and the renewable 
heat ­incentive; a ­conventional 4.5kW PV system; a lithium-ion battery storage 
system to harness energy during the day; an 11kW wood pellet boiler; an 
energy-saving Immersun unit; and a phase change thermal store.
The house, with its impressive tiled arch, has been featured on Channel 4’s 
Grand Designs programme.
