 across the country in local elections that could rewrite the country’s 
political landscape.

Twenty-two years since the party came to power, South Africans used the local 
government elections to warn the ANC that its historic achievement of 
overturning the apartheid system no longer guaranteed it the right to govern.

They cast their ballots for the Democratic Alliance (DA), a party once 
considered a champion of the white middle classes that now has its first black 
leader, Mmusi Maimane.

South Africans also voted in smaller but significant numbers for the Economic 
Freedom Fighters, a radical far-left party led by the former ANC firebrand 
Julius Malema that is likely to serve as kingmaker in areas where the ANC or DA 
are forced to form coalitions.

Although voters were only choosing local councils, the elections were widely 
seen as a referendum on more than two decades of ANC rule.

Eyewitness News quoted Malema telling party activists 
<http://ewn.co.za/2016/08/05/We-are-happy-that-we-humbled-the-ANC>: “We are 
happy that the EFF is the first organisation to humble the ANC – the most 
arrogant organisation.”

The first victory the DA claimed was the Nelson Mandela Bay area, named after 
the revered former president and once home to other heroes of the 
anti-apartheid movement.

The DA will have to rule in coalition, but the loss was still difficult for 
the ANC to digest. Long after it was clear that support for the party had 
collapsed there, the deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said it was too early 
to analyse the election results. It would be like reading “somebody’s tombstone 
before they die,” he said.

“It was a hotly contested area, where we as the ANC had a number of challenges 
and problems. We accept that the people have spoken.”


In Johannesburg and the urban sprawl around Pretoria, results were still being 
counted nearly two days after polling stations closed, with support for the ANC 
and the DA too close to call.

Even if the ANC ultimately only loses control of one city, it will have been 
chastened by the election result. It looks set to hold on to a slim overall 
majority nationwide, but this is the first time since Mandela took power that 
it has secured less than 60% of the vote.

“We need to have a serious introspection,” the ANC chief whip, Jackson 
Mthembu, told reporters at the main counting centre in Pretoria.

The challenge, particularly for the DA, as it takes power in new areas as part 
of a coalition, will be coming good on election promises to rule for all, 
including the poorest black communities frustrated by inequality.

About 80% of South Africa’s 54 million citizens are black, but most land and 
companies remain in the hands of white people, who make up less than 10% of the 
population.

“We’ve given the DA a chance to show what they can do. I hope they don’t let 
us down,” said one township voter, who spoke to Reuters, but asked to be named 
only as Tando because of the stigma still attached to his choice. “Where I come 
from, there is a lot of pressure to vote for the ANC.”

The DA has built up a reputation for competent management in Cape Town, its 
only power base until now, but has been dogged by lingering accusations of 
racism.

As recently as last year, a shadow cabinet member was demoted after sharing a 
Facebook postpraising the apartheid president

 PW Botha.

The DA has worked hard to distance itself from that legacy. In a major speech 
at the start of the year, Maimane spelled out that the party did not want votes 
from anyone not committed to a diverseSouth Africa

“If you’re a racist and you are thinking of voting for the DA, please don’t. 
We are not the party for you,”he told an audience

museum, in a landmark speech on identity and race.
