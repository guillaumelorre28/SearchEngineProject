 A shout of fury against American global dominance by the dying French 
playwright Antonin Artaud, censored by French radio over half a century ago, 
will be restaged tomorrow night at Tate Modern in the ominous shadow of Anish 
Kapoor's giant sculpture depicting the flayed red flesh of Marsyas.
The evening, which includes the world premiere of LamenTate, a composition by 
Estonian composer Arvo Part, also inspired by Marsyas, was originally planned 
last summer as Kapoor completed his huge sculpture, but has been shaped against 
the gathering clouds of war.

Yesterday the internationally renowned American director Peter Sellars said: 
"Democracy is something that rarely works at the point of a gun. Somalia, 
Haiti, Afghanistan, this is a very bloody path of nation wrecking. The record 
would suggest that this is not the way to go."

He added that he was "pretty much in solidarity with most people on the 
planet" in opposing war in Iraq.

For the event, which will also be given on Saturday night, he has made his own 
new translation of the Artaud text.

Artaud wrote For an End to the Judgment of God in 1947, his health shattered 
by years in mental hospitals and dozens of electric shock treatments, looking 
ahead to 50 years of American armies trampling across the globe.

At a time when the American forces were seen in Europe as liberating heroes, 
it was remarkably prophetic but was "of course" banned, Mr Sellars said.

Artaud died a few weeks later, and his very last writings were letters of 
protest against the ban.

Kapoor described the evening as "provocative rather than propaganda". 

"In this country we are quite afraid to stand up and say what we think. I 
think that to have Peter on board has given me the courage to be less afraid 
about standing up on this issue."

The evening is part of the Tate & Egg Live performance series, of which the 
Guardian is media sponsor.
