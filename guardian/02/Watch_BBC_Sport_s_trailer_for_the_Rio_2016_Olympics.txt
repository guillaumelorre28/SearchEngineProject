Campofrio Finisimas: ‘Proposal’ (starts at 00:04) - Spain

A young couple give their forthcoming marriage a solid base by negotiating a 
bizarre verbal pre-nup in this funny Spanish commercial. British director James 
Rouse has a well-deserved reputation for delivering great comedy performances 
in UK adverts but here he demonstrates he can translate those nuanced skills 
into another language.

Virgin Media: ‘9.58 Seconds’ (starts at 01:07) - UK

9.58 seconds. One of the most famous times in the world after Usain Bolt’s 
astonishing run at the 2009 World Athletics Championships. As the man primes 
himself for another surge at glory, Michael Johnson asks, “Do you know what 
9.58 seconds feels like?” Thanks to this kinetic piece of work for Virgin 
Media, we’ve got plenty of illustrations to help us grasp the idea.
