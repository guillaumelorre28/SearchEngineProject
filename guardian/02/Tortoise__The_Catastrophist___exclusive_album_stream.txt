Experimental rockers Tortoise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/17/mogwai-stuart-braithwaite-interviews-tortoise-doug-mccombs>
 are back with a new album inspired by the jazz scene of their native Chicago. 
You can hear it below. We were going to tell you all about it, but then we had 
a better idea: why not let the group’s Doug McCombs do that instead? Here are 
his thoughts on The Catastrophist ...

“About one-third of The Catastrophist originated from a commission for the 
City of Chicago. The idea was for us to write a new set of material that would 
work in collaboration with musicians from the jazz community in Chicago. When 
we decided to work some of this material into our new record we re-evaluated 
what was interesting about the songs and added and rearranged parts 
accordingly. Basically, in the absence of the extra musicians, we found the 
material needed more detail to become ‘Tortoise-like’. We have been a band for 
25 years and it works because we’re friends and have respect and admiration for 
each other’s abilities. I’ve seen great bands that are ‘led’ by one person, but 
often those bands dissolve in animosity, jealousy and squabbles about money. We 
want to make money but we try to stay focused on pushing ourselves to make the 
most interesting music we can. It helps keep us grounded.”

Have a listen to the album using the player below, and let us know what you 
think in the comments.
