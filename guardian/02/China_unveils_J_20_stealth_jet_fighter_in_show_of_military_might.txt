China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> showed its Chengdu J-20 
stealth fighter in public for the first time on Tuesday, opening the country’s 
biggest meeting of aircraft makers and buyers with a show of its military clout.

Two J-20 jets, Zhuhai’s headline act, swept over dignitaries and hundreds of 
spectators and industry executives gathered at the show’s opening ceremony in a 
60-second flypast, generating a deafening roar that was met with gasps and 
applause and set off car alarms in a car park at the site.

Airshow China, in the southern city of Zhuhai, offers Beijing an opportunity 
to demonstrate its ambitions in civil aerospace and to underline its defence 
ambitions. China is set to overtake the US as the world’s top aviation market 
in the next decade.

Bradley Perrett of Aviation Week, a veteran China watcher, said: “It is 
clearly a big step forward in Chinese combat capability.”

 Analysts say it is too early to say to what extent the new Chinese fighter 
can match the radar-evading properties of the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor 
air-to-air combat jet – developed for the US Air Force and the J-20’s closest 
lookalike – or the latest strike jet in the US arsenal, Lockheed’s F-35.

 Unofficial shots of a J-20 prototype fuelled discussion about the region’s 
power balance when first glimpsed by planespotters in 2010. Experts say China 
has been refining designs in the hope of narrowing a military gap with 
Washington.

 Cao Qingfeng, an aircraft engineer watching the flypast, said the “stunning” 
display was a show of China’s strengthening aircraft industry and manufacturing 
– and western officials agreed.

 “This shows they now have confidence to put it out in public,” said a western 
industry official who has monitored the biennial show from its inception 20 
years ago.

 “This is the airplane for China in the way that the J-31 is not; this is the 
one they develop for themselves,” he added.

 The export-oriented J-31, was unveiled at Zhuhai in 2014.

President Xi Jinping has pushed to toughen the armed forces as China takes a 
more assertive stance in the region, particularly in the South China and East 
China seas.

 It remains unclear whether or how the J-20 would be displayed after the 
flypast, or to what extent foreign executives and media would be allowed a 
close look as they try to figure out its role and effectiveness. Some foreign 
observers have questioned its stealth capabilities.

 Aircraft that are already scheduled to be on display alongside the latest 
Chinese weapon systems, radar and drones include the Xian Y-20 strategic 
airlifter, and what organisers say is the largest amphibious plane now in 
production, the AG600.

 The flying boat is officially promoted as a fire-fighting or search and 
rescue plane. But analysts note the AG600 – first unveiled 10 days after a Hague
tribunal ruled against China’s claim to parts of the South China Sea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china>
 in July – is well suited to resupplying military outposts in the disputed area.

 Notably absent from the airshow schedule is the Comac C919 passenger jet, 
designed to compete with Airbus and Boeing, the rivals which dominate the 
global supply of airliners.

 The 150-seater C919 is scheduled to stage an often-delayed maiden flight this 
year, but industry sources say this will now slip to 2017 – three years behind 
original plans.

 Airbus and Boeing continue to expand in China with recent plant 
announcements. Boeing is expected to announce a new supplier partnership at the 
show, which runs until 6 November.
