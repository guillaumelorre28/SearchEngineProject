Q I have been paying a County Court Judgement (CCJ) since September 1999 and 
will be for another eight years. Will the details remain on my credit file for 
only three more years, or until the debt is paid off in full?

A If you pay the debt in full within one month of a CCJ is issued then the 
details will be removed from your credit file straight away.

Otherwise, details of debts remain on your file for six years, whether or not 
your debt is paid off, from the date you defaulted.

James Jones, spokesman for Experian, one of the largest credit reference 
agencies, says: "If you are paying off the debt for eight years, the final two 
years of those payments will not appear on your credit file, as you will have 
passed the six year stage." When you have cleared the debts you can write to 
the two credit reference agencies, Experian and Equifax, to let them know that 
you have finished paying up and that your debts are paid off. In the interim 
(if there were any mitigating circumstances) you can write a note of no more 
than 200 words and send it to the credit reference agencies explaining what 
happened. This will be held on your file alongside details of the CCJ.

You may find that lenders are reluctant to extend credit to you until the six 
years have passed. You could choose to pay off your debts more quickly in order 
to improve your credit rating if you wished.
