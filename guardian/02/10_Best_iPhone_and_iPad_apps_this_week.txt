<http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/aug/20/best-android-apps-sky-pinterest>
).

Both offer a selection of the 10 most interesting new apps from the last week 
for their respective platforms, focusing on non-game apps – a separate post on 
the Guardian's Games Blog will offer a weekly 10 Best selection for all 
smartphones and tablets.

On with today's selection for iPhone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> and iPad:

designed to be used while watching the WWE's weekly TV shows.

appearing on British stamps? The Royal Mail's Smilers service has a brand new 
app from developer Intelligent AR, helping people turn their iPhone or iPad

iPhone / iPad

Fleksy <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fleksy-happy-typing/id520337246?mt=8>

Android has had all the fun when it comes to innovative keyboard apps, due to 
Apple's stricter rules on developers taking over the native iOS keyboard. 
Fleksy is very interesting though: a predictive texting app designed for blind 
and visually impaired people, but attracting rave reviews from a wider range of 
reviewers for its smartness.
iPhone

Fairy Magic <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fairy-magic/id513891862?mt=8>

Startup Inlifesize has pulled in some top-tier film and games talent for this 
augmented reality app aimed at children. It gets them to hunt for 
beautifully-animated fairies in their local surroundings, with more than 50 to 
collect and play with.
iPhone / iPad

Seven Poets <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/seven-poets/id534475311?mt=8>

Edmund Pevensey is the latest developer experimenting with interactive fiction 
in an app. This is a "real-time, serialised story" with new chapters due to be 
released every week, starting on 15 August and running into October. There's 
even a fictional newspaper from the story's world that delivers new articles 
every day, in between the arrival of chapters.
iPhone / iPad

Salon.com <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/salon.com/id549374205?mt=8>

Good news for fans of news and entertainment site Salon.com: there's now an 
app for that. In its current incarnation, it pulls in articles from the site, 
as well as images and video, and provides sharing features for Facebook, 
Twitter and LinkedIn. More features are promised regularly.
iPhone

Vodio <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/vodio/id486185699?mt=8>

Lots of startups are trying to sell the merits of social video discovery apps, 
even if evidence is still relatively slight on whether there's a big demand 
– as opposed to people simply watching videos from within apps like Facebook 
and Twitter. Still, Vodio looks slick, tracking videos and sorting them into 
categories, while learning from your habits and your social graph to serve up 
more relevant suggestions. It's new on iPhone, although it's been out oniPad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad> for a while.
iPhone

CityBeats <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/citybeats/id533800173?mt=8>

Having nicked the Premier League in the final minute last season, now 
Manchester City have designs on the world of music apps. CityBeats is a 
club-branded remix app from Bounce Mobile promising to showcase "the great up 
and coming bands from around the UK", while enabling you to make them sound 
even more (or less) up and coming by messing about with their beats and 
melodies.
iPhone / iPad

Talking Ginger <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/talking-ginger/id531323947?mt=8>

Expect lots of children to be getting very excited about Talking Ginger, the 
latest in Outfit7's Talking Friends series – 400m downloads and 115m monthly 
active users at the time of writing – and a virtual nephew for the 
equally-virtual Talking Tom Cat. Kids can interact with Ginger by tapping and 
talking, while guiding him through his bedtime routine (showering, teeth 
brushing and having a poo, rather than slaughtering a mouse on the living-room 
rug like most cats I know).
iPhone

AppFlow 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/appflow-crowdsourcing-app/id539183053?mt=8>

App-discovery app AppFlow has been a hit on Windows Phone, but now it's 
venturing onto iOS, where there's considerably more competition. The idea: 
"discovering apps in a social way" through recommendations from other users, 
while creating your own curated "App Lists" for other people to browse.
