, artist-turned-poet-turned-rapper Mykki Blanco has taken a stride towards the 
mainstream with a first artist album. Imagine a trap remix ofAnohni

, and you’re maybe a quarter of the way to this album’s vibe.

 Pinup turned serious artist Justin Bieber. 
How did the world’s brattiest child star reinvent himself as a brooding R&B 
innovator? A short answer may be “good producers”. But 2015’sPurpose was both 
gripping and commercial, spawning the ubiquitous Sorry (more than 1bn views). 
Expect delirium on this long-awaited UK tour.

Stockport’s Blossoms are the first in what is sure to be a long, long line of 
post-Catfish and the Bottlemen outfits, bringing back guitars, but with an ear 
cocked to The 1975’s production values. Their debut album was released at the 
start of the summer; the five-piece are shopping its charms in earnest during 
term-time.

ordinary songwriter. Conceptual, digital, and at once her “most fictional and 
most personal” album, Hval’sBlood Bitch looks set to add to the Norwegian 
innovator’s reputation.

the Guardian 
Minimal R&B singer Banks made ripples with her 2014 album, Goddess, taking on 
relationships in an intimate whisper scored by icy digitals. Album two comes 
hot on the heels of Fuck With Myself, a glacial tune whose twin motifs – 
self-love and self-loathing – add a new twist to the genre.

As-yet untitled album out 30 September
