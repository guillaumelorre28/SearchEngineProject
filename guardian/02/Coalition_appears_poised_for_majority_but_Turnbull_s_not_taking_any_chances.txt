The Coalition is now confident it can get to 76 seats as the election count 
stretches into the weekend – and the Labor leader,Bill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten>, has also conceded 
the Coalition is likely to “scrape over the line”.


But while a majority appears to be in reach, Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> has spent the 
week focused on locking in support from the new crossbench as he approaches the 
practical difficulties of governing in the new parliament at a time when 
internal tensions within the Coalition remain high.

On Friday, the independents Cathy McGowan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/08/cathy-mcgowan-offers-to-support-coalition-after-meeting-with-malcolm-turnbull>
 and Andrew Wilkiejoined Bob Katter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/07/election-2016-bob-katter-promises-to-support-coalition-in-hung-parliament>
 in backing Turnbull’s government on matters of supply and confidence. 
McGowan’s move to publicly back the prime minister without any expressed 
conditions attached took her fellow crossbenchers by surprise.

South Australian Nick Xenophon, who will have one MP in the house and a voting 
bloc in the Senate in the new parliament, has yet to make any public 
declarations about supporting Turnbull.

He has continued talking to the prime minister about the future of the 
troubled steel manufacturer Arrium. “We hope to find common ground,” Xenophon 
told Guardian Australia on Friday night. “We want to go through a number of 
issues.”

Bob Katter <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bob-katter> also told 
Guardian Australia on Friday night that he had made it absolutely clear to the 
prime minister that his guarantee of support was conditional on Turnbull 
proceeding with his wish list, which includes two big irrigation projects in 
north Queensland, a rail line into the Galilee Basin, a canal and land tenure 
rights for Indigenous Australians in Cape York.

“Malcolm Turnbull left me with the distinct impression he was very sincere 
about developing infrastructure ... it seems to me that he realises they’ve 
been going in the wrong direction,” Katter said of their discussion in Brisbane 
on Thursday.

He said he would have no hesitation in withdrawing support if the undertakings 
were not honoured, but he believed Turnbull had now become “disabused of free 
market theory”.

Labor met in Canberra for the first time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/08/labor-caucus-smiles-mask-shorten-albanese-tensions>
 since the election on Friday, and Shorten warned that any new Coalition 
government would be inherently unstable. He predicted that Australians would be 
back at the polls within a year owing to Turnbull’s lack of authority.

“The combination of a prime minister with no authority, a government with no 
direction and a Liberal party at war with itself could see Australians back at 
the polls within the year,” he told the caucus.

The Labor leader said the opposition would “respect the judgment of the people 
and be true to our policies and propositions upon which we sought the support 
which we received”.

“But we will be campaign-ready from this day onwards,” he said.

The Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> faces 
many difficulties if it goes on to form government, the most pressing of which 
involves the lack of broad-based parliamentary support for key elements of its 
budget and election manifesto.

Following a warning by S&P on Thursday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/07/scott-morrison-digs-in-behind-corporate-tax-cuts-despite-standard-poors-credit-warning>
 that the chances of a credit downgrade had increased post-election, Xenophon 
said on Friday the government should keep the 2% temporary deficit levy in 
place until the deficit was under control.

“If you’re earning more than $180,000 a year, I don’t think it’s too onerous 
to be paying an extra couple of per cent in tax to pay your fair share,” he 
said.

“That’s something that will only affect a very small percentage of taxpayers, 
including all federal MPs who are over that threshold. And I’m happy to pay 
that levy.”

Labor and the Greens proposed keeping the deficit levy permanently as part of 
their recent election commitments, but the government opposed the move. 
Xenophon said the Coalition should consider raising the Medicare levy a 
“smidgin” too, for the same reason.

 He also wants the government to consider giving the auditor-general powers to 
monitor the effectiveness of government spending and programs – “including the 
billions of dollars the commonwealth provides to the states,” he said.

“Taxpayers need to be able to demand both transparency and a greater 
efficiency in the way that government programs are implemented.”

By Friday afternoon, the latest official election count had the Coalition 
sitting on 72 declared seats, with one more seat, Gilmore in New South Wales, 
likely to increase that count to 73.

The party needs 76 seats to form majority government.
Labor was still sitting on 66 seats, but Cowan looks likely to fall its way.

If Gilmore and Cowan go as expected, that would leave the Coalition three 
seats short of a majority, with five seats left in play.

These five are:

 * Capricornia - Labor leads by 175 
 * Flynn - Labor leads by 7 
 * Forde - LNP leads by 471 
 * Herbert - Labor leads by 352 
 * Hindmarsh - Labor leads by 71 
On Friday night, the Coalition was bullish about the prospect of holding at 
least some of its Queensland seats, which would bring the final tally to 76, or 
perhaps 77. The AEC will continue counting in close seats on Saturday, and 
possibly into Sunday.
