So, here's the full lowdown on this Thursday evening's live cookery class. For 
anyone new to the party, here's how it works. We'll assemble via the miracle of 
the internet at a little before 8pm on the night with ingredients and equipment 
to hand for an hour of frantic food-based fun. I'll be here to guide you 
through the process step-by-step, answer any questions you may have and avert 
any looming calamities, and at around 9 o'clock we'll all sit down to a 
fantastic two course dinner.

Have a look at the last session

new and springy)
