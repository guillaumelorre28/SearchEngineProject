The New England Patriots 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/new-england-patriots> have traded defensive 
end Chandler Jones to the Arizona Cardinals for guard Jonathan Cooper and a 
second-round draft pick.

The Cardinals announced the deal on Tuesday, saying it was pending the two 
players passing physicals.

The acquisition of Jones would fill the Cardinals biggest need â€” someone to 
rush the passer off the edge. He thanked the Patriots and their fans on Twitter 
on Tuesday.

The 26-year-old Jones ranked fifth in the NFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> last season with 12.5 sacks. Cooper was 
Arizonaâ€™s first-round pick, the seventh selection overall, in the 2013 draft. 
He missed his rookie season with a broken leg and never reached the level of 
play the Cardinals had envisioned for him.

The Patriots are without a first-round draft pick this year following the 
Deflategate scandal.
