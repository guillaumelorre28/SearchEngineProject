NZCA Lines may be the brainchild of Michael Lovett, but for this album he’s 
joined by former Ash guitarist Charlotte Hatherley and Sarah Jones, who has 
played with NYPC and Hot Chip. The result is a record that aims to “marry 
sci-fi futurism to personal intimacies”.

It comes billed as a concept album, and takes inspiration from sci-fi greats 
such as Arthur C Clarke, JG Ballard and Philip K Dick, as well as the more 
musical likes of Daft Punk, Prince and even prog-era Genesis.

 “The album is based around the idea of a far-future Earth, where the sun has 
expanded to the size of a red giant and our extinction is imminent,” explains 
Lovett cheerfully. “Half of the world is covered by a city that clings to the 
past and embraces its destruction, while the other half is trying to rebuild, 
create and make something new. Yet, it’s good on both sides because it’s warm 
everywhere and people just party most of the time.”
