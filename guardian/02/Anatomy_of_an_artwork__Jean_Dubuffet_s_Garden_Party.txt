1 - Nightmares

This is not the kind of gentle get-together that the title suggests. Instead, 
the scene is a muddled one in which the partygoers’ cartoonish faces grimace or 
stare blankly, their bodies distorted or entirely absent. Painted in the red, 
white and blue palette Dubuffet almost solely utilised from the 60s on, this 
party is one of nightmares.

2 - Outside

Despite being immersed in the early 20th century Parisian art scene, by the 
time this work was made in 1976, Dubuffet had long established his art brut 
style. It was an embrace of what he viewed as an outsider aesthetic, inspired 
by his travels to Algeria.

3 - Chance

This is a painting, but its process of production is closer to collage. 
Dubuffet cut up his earlier works and scattered them on the floor before 
piecing the results of this random composition together on a canvas mount.

4 - Subconsicous

The work is from his series Théâtres de mémoire, which comprises close to 100 
works. Other methods from this period include paintings developed from doodles 
he would make while on the phone. Dubuffet was interested in removing the 
conscious author from the process, relying on the subconscious instead.
