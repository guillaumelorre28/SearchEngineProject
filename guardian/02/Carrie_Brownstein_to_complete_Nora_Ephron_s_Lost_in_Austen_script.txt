Carrie Brownstein, the creator and star of Portlandia, will complete an 
unfinished screenplay by the late film-makerNora Ephron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/nora-ephron> for a movie in which an American 
woman finds herself transported back to the time of Jane Austen,according to 
The Hollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/portlandias-carrie-brownstein-finish-nora-723599>
.

Lost in Austen was left incomplete when Ephron – the three-time 
Oscar-nominated writer ofWhen Harry Met Sally 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/when-harry-met-sally>, and writer-director of 
Sleepless in Seattle <https://www.theguardian.com/film/sleepless-in-seattle> and
Julie and Julia <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/130330> – died in 2012. 
The film's producer is the Oscar-winning British directorSam Mendes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sam-mendes>, who said of Brownstein: 
"Carrie is smart and funny and original, and the project is very lucky to have 
her."

Brownstein, previously a guitarist and singer with the indie-rock band Sleater 
Kinney, is a musician, writer and actor; Portlandia, her US satirical sketch 
series, has won several awards. She is making her feature film debut as 
screenwriter on the project.

Lost in Austen centres on a Brooklyn woman named Amanda who is transported 
back in time to the regency era, when Austen published novels such as Sense and 
Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice and Emma. Each of those books has received the 
big-screen treatment over the past two decades, testament to Hollywood's 
enduring fascination with the English author.

Last year's Austenland <https://www.theguardian.com/film/austenland> told the 
story of a fan who travels to a British Austen theme park and meets a Mr 
Darcy-like potential suitor, while the forthcomingPride and Prejudice and 
Zombies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/06/pride-prejudice-zombies-grahame-smith>
 takes a mashup approach to the 1813 novel. The latter will starSam Riley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/sam-riley> as Darcy, with Downton Abbey's 
Lily James as Elizabeth Bennett in a version of the tale where the undead 
invade early 18th-century Hertfordshire.
