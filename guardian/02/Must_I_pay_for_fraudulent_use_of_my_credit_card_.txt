Q I'm in dispute with my credit card company over fraudulent use of my card. I 
feel that I am being pressured into paying for this fraud even though I have 
done nothing untoward. Is there a credit card regulator or someone I can talk 
to for advice?

A You don't say what alleged fraud has taken place, or which card provider you 
are dealing with. Most credit card companies have clear rules about when they 
will and will not compensate you for fraudulent use of your card. The majority 
will make good any loss you suffer if the loss was due to a security breach or 
system error by the card company, or happened while you were making a purchase 
online with a reputable internet trader.

Where it gets more complicated is when you use a site which is insecure or 
when the security breach can be traced back to you. So always look for a locked 
key or padlock at the bottom of the screen when you are making a purchase 
online, and never give anyone details of your credit card PIN number.

In your case, you will need to take your dispute to the Financial Services 
Obudsman as there is no regulator which deals specifically with credit card 
complaints. You must first exhaust the complaints procedure at the card company 
before you turn to the ombudsman for help. You can find details of how to 
complain to the ombudsman on the FSA website atwww.fsa.gov.uk
