PlayART by Tapook <http://itunes.apple.com/app/playart-by-tapook/id535129847>

Art purists may shudder at the thought of children mashing up Van Gogh's 
sunflowers with Monet's waterlillies, but that's the idea behind Tapook's 
PlayART app. Aimed at 5-13 year-olds, it lets them resize, rotate and flip 
elements from classic artworks by Van Gogh, Monet, Cézanne, Rousseau and Klee, 
to be saved and shared with family and friends.
iPad

VLC Beta 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc.betav7neon>

Open source media player VLC has launched in beta for Android devices, 
although its developers warn it's "intended for power users and hackers. This 
version is NOT stable and is slower than the final version. It might kill your 
kitten, destroy your house and start the mayan apocalypse." It promises to play 
most audio and video file formats, as well as streaming files.
Android

Samsung S Health

Samsung showed off its "personal wellness" app earlier this year, but it's now 
available to download for the company's Galaxy S III smartphone. The app tracks 
various health metrics, and can connect to blood glucose meters, blood pressure 
monitors and body composition scales to pull in more data. In the UK, it's 
available through the handset's More Services store.
Android

Critical Strike Portable 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioOnMars.CSPortable>

Craving a Counter Strike-style FPS fix for your Android device? Critical 
Strike Portable is well worth a look. Studio OnMars' free-to-play game offers a 
mixture of single-player and online deathmatching modes, while enabling people 
to create their own maps using Unity 3D.
Android

Flutterby Butterflies 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/flutterby-butterflies/id532772013?mt=8>

There are hordes of cheap'n'nasty flash-card and alphabet apps for kids on the 
App Store. Flutterby Butterflies stands out for its craft, though: its colour 
and letter-matching games include illustrations by former Beatles collaborator 
Alan Aldridge, while the team at developer FeeFiFoFun has a background making 
light-shows for the likes of Pink Floyd and Cirque du Soleil.
iPhone / iPad

Speedball 2 Evolution 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vividgames.speedball2>

Here's a retro fix for Android gamers, as classic 16-bit title Speedball 2 
pops up on the Google Play store. Having been a hit on iOS in 2011, the Android 
edition keeps its key features, including a range of solo modes including a 
10-season career.
Android

CouchSurfing 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.couchsurfing.mobile.android>

CouchSurfing describes itself as a "social travel network", helping people 
connect when on their travels to find food, parties and beds for the night (or, 
indeed, sofas). The app helps people find likeminded users and communicate 
before turning up at their gaff.
Android

Traffic Panic London 
<http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/traffic-panic-london/id524086769?mt=8>

Nothing to do with the Olympic Games, despite the title. This freemium game 
from British publisher Neon Play is part of its existing Traffic Panic 
franchise, getting players to control traffic lights to ensure everything flows 
smoothly on the capital's streets. Or, alternatively, to manipulate massive 
great pile-ups.
iPhone / iPad

Encyclopaedia Britannica 
<http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/78b37401-4b6e-4554-961e-cfc9b33e86a9>

Fresh from announcing plans to shift from print to digital, the Encyclopaedia 
Britannica has made its debut on Windows Phone. This 2012 edition includes 
80,000 articles and tens of thousands of images and charts, as well as an 
offline-reading mode. A one-year subscription is bundled into the download 
price.
Windows Phone

Chasing Yello <http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chasing-yello/id508314901?mt=8>

Alas, nothing to do with the pioneering Swiss band Yello – although their The 
Race single would be an apt soundtrack to an endless runner game. Actually, 
this is less running and more swimming: a colourful arcade game focused on a 
fish named Mathilda. Power-ups and social challenges are included.
