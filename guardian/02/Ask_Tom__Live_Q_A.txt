A fortnight ago Tom was inundated with questions on where to go this 
September, so he'll be giving more advice and suggestions on the subject this 
time around. He'll also be giving updates on the current travel situation in 
Greece and Egypt before moving on to answer whatever questions you throw at him.

Tom will get to as many as he can in an hour, but due to the volume of 
questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
