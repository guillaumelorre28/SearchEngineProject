For the past 15 days, Emuriya Lodea has been digging a well on the vast and 
dried bed of the Kakuma river in Turkana. Temperatures sometimes soar beyond 
40C. A large mound of sand lies beside concentric rings excavated deep into the 
bed. Women, children and a herd of goat look expectantly into it. He says he 
will reach water in a day or two. The parched river bed is sporadically 
punctuated by holes dug into it. Each well dug by a family belongs solely to 
it. Depending on the depth and the excavation, water in the well, though murky, 
can last for a few months.

Eberhard Zeyhle of Amref thinks the technology is simple and economical. But 
he also warns of its dangers. Only a week ago, the loose sand of a poorly 
excavated well caved in, taking the lives of an entire family, labouring in its 
depths. Eberhard says if concrete rings are used with the surface sealed, 
uncontaminated water can be drawn from it.

"I don't understand why the government has not thought about this. But I'm not 
going to wait for them," Emuriya says, calling out from deep inside the well. 
He shovels another bucket of sand and pounds the cascading rings firmly to 
prevent it from collapsing.

"I'm going to sell a few of my cows and build a proper well for next year's 
dry season," he says. Livestock is the wealth of the Turkana. Only in extreme 
situations are cattle and goat sold or slaughtered. But some like Emuriya, 
having waited years for the government to take some interest in them, have 
decided to take matters into their own hands. They have realised that there is 
enough water to be harvested.
