Hira Lal Yadav sits in the ghostly shell of the factory where he once employed 
100 weavers. You can still make out the remnants of their looms in the 
half-light. It is eerily quiet.

There is anger in Hira's voice when he speaks about what happened here, and 
dismay at where he now finds himself. "I used to be a skilled worker. I was an 
artisan. I provided jobs for 100 people. Now I live hand-to-mouth." He blames 
the influx of cheap silk from China for the failure of his business. "When we 
produced a sari, the market price would be less than it cost to make. How were 
we supposed to survive?"

Now the only money he makes is from his cow. Every morning he milks the cow 
before cycling 20km to the marketplace in Varanasi. If he does not sell the 
milk that day it will curdle, and he will not be able to eat. Hira knows he has 
few other options. On his route he passes the people looking for construction 
work each morning. "They stand on the road side waiting to be chosen. They look 
like slaves."

"When the factory was open, I made 25,000 rupees every month," he explains. 
"Now, I am lucky to make 3,000. That is just 100 rupees a day. I have four 
children to support, how can I fill their stomachs? Even one man's stomach will 
not be filled with 100 rupees."
