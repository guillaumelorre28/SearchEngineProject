In 1932, a musician called Gage Brewer began performing on one of the first 
electrically amplified Hawaiian guitars. The idea soon appealed to guitarists 
rendered almost inaudible in big swing bands, but six years passed before a 
jazz guitarist, George Barnes, first recorded on a Spanish instrument with 
magnetic pick-ups in 1938. The next year 23-year-old guitarist Charlie 
Christian joined Benny Goodman's hit-making big band playing the 
ground-breaking Gibson ES-150. Christian's stunning solos were phrased like sax 
lines, making the guitar a front-line jazz instrument. In 1940, Christian 
joined the coterie that created bebop, but he died of TB aged only 25.
