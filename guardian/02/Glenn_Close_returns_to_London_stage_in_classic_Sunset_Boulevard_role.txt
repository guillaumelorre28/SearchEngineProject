More than 20 years after first playing the faded silent screen star Norma 
Desmond,Glenn Close <https://www.theguardian.com/film/glenn-close> is ready for 
another close-up. The actor will return to the part in a semi-staged production 
of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical Sunset Boulevard, based on Billy Wilder’s 
classic film noir, at the Coliseum in London in April 2016.

The run of 43 performances, directed by Lonny Price, will be presented by ENO 
and the GradeLinnit Company, the partnership who produced a sell-out run of
Sweeney Todd with Emma Thompson and Bryn Terfel

 earlier this year. It’s a West End debut for Close, who played Blanche Dubois 
in afive-star production of A Streetcar Named Desire

National Theatre in 2002.

With music by Lloyd Webber and book and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher 
Hampton, Sunset Boulevard follows the increasingly queasy relationship between 
a down-on-his-luck screenwriter (William Holden 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bE6iAJt77g> in Wilder’s 1950 film) and the 
reclusive Desmond (played on screen byGloria Swanson 
<http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/gloriaswanson.html>) who is plotting a 
cinematic comeback as Salome.

Directed by Trevor Nunn, and starring Patti LuPone as Desmond, the musical 
premiered in London in 1993 at the Adelphi theatre. LuPone was replaced by 
Close when the production transferred to Broadway the following year, a 
decision that led to acostly settlement 
<http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/30/theater/a-diva-s-life-isn-t-always-happy-ask-callas-and-lupone.html>
. Sunset Boulevard cleaned up at the Tony awards, winning best musical and, for 
Close, best actress in a musical.

Close’s most recent stage role was in an all-star revival of Edward Albee’s A 
Delicate Balance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/21/edward-albee-a-delicate-balance-review>
, which closed earlier this year on Broadway.

Tickets for Sunset Boulevard go on sale on 29 September with 100 available at 
£12 for each performance.
