The first audio samples have emerged from the debut album by Apparatjik, a 
side project unitingColdplay <https://www.theguardian.com/music/coldplay> 
bassist Guy Berryman, A-ha keyboardist Magne Furuholmen, Mew frontman Jonas 
Bjerre and producer Martin Terefe. The band has emailed a new song, Electric 
Eye, to just 30 fans, promising a full release on 30 November.

Apparatjik first appeared in 2008, recording one track for Amazon Tribe, a 
benefit CD launched in conjunction with Bruce Parry's Amazon TV series. 
However, they have kept working and, according toColdplay fan sites 
<http://www.coldplaying.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=6830>, the 
debut album is imminent. The band are certainly putting work into their 
deliberatelyesoteric website <http://apparatjik.com/> and Twitter account 
<http://twitter.com/Apparatjik>, the former hiding dozens of videos, images and 
audio snippets <http://apparatjik.com/eyeoncommittee/fort-knox/00100100.html>. 
Since September, fans have been encouraged to submit their theories linking the 
disparate images and sounds â€“ and 30 of the most creative have reportedly been 
rewarded with the first single.

Though we haven't heard the single in its entirety, one generous fan has 
shared asample of Electric Eye <http://www.mediafire.com/?zzitez15m4h> that we 
have dutifully analysed. Recalling the style of Belfast DJ David Holmes, the 
track's got a shoegazey parade of sequenced synths, moody guitar riffs and an 
unidentified singer. While it's clearly not Bjerre's usual singing voice, we're 
not used to hearing the warbling of Coldplay's bassist or A-ha's keyboardist, 
so it's difficult to tell who is behind the mic. Even more mysterious is the 
voice of Terefe, a man best known for producing acts like Martha Wainwright and 
Jason Mraz.

But what Electric Eye definitely does not sound like is a cross between Viva 
La Vida and Take On Me. And for that, we must admit, we are sorely disappointed.
