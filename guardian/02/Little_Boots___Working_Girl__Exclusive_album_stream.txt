Working Girl is more than just the title of Little Boots’ third studio album. 
It’s a reflection of Victoria Hesketh’s status in charge of her own label, On 
Repeat Records, through which this latest LP is being released. It’s also a 
reference to the sonic theme that runs through this record – from the 
interspersed voicemail messages to song titles such as Business Pleasure and 
Get Things Done.

The executive theme comes soundtracked by subtle grooves, spacey falsetto and 
Kylie-esque disco pop. Have a listen using the player below and let us know
