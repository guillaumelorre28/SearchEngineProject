This is very important, Joe. I'm staking my presidency on ratifying the New 
Start treaty with Russia, and we desperately need some GOP votes. Right now 
they're playing politics, but they must be made to see it's their duty to 
uphold national security. That's why I'm putting you in charge of this one. 
I have every faith in you; go get 'em. Barack.

No, Vlad, that's the point: by making a stand on the treaty vote I'm hitting 
the ball into the Republicans' court. If they want to be responsible for 
destabilising relations with Russia and making the world a more dangerous 
place, let them. Then you do a little sabre-rattling in the new year, Congress 
freaks out, and in the spring I'll overcome an even bigger Republican 
majority to get the treaty passed. It's a long game, I know, but it can't miss 
unless we accidentally win the vote the first time. I've put Biden in charge of 
it, so don't worry. Barack.

I know! The Republicans attack the American justice system, and I'm the one 
who's made to look bad. Is it my fault that we can't pin anything on any of the 
people Bush rounded up? Did they actually catch any bad guys out there? B

TGIF!!!!!!!!

Hey, Pete, I almost forgot – I put Joe in charge of the campaign to get New 
Start ratified, so we need to follow the usual procedure: reroute all his 
incoming and outgoing emails through me, and make sure he can't get an outside 
line on his phone for the next three weeks. If he persists we might have to get 
an actor to pose as a New York Times reporter, but he usually just gets 
frustrated and gives up. Nice weekend, B
