gyms. Here’s some advanced tips to help you get the best out of what you’ve got.

It sounds obvious, but levelling up your trainer experience will make a big 
difference in the strength ofPokémon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon> you can capture.

Getting experience points is easy, but can be a bit tedious. Hit every 
Pokéstop, even if your bag is full as you get 50XP from each, capture every 
Pokémon you encounter as you get at least 100XP from successfully bagging them 
and try and use advanced capture techniques to gain even more.

Finally, if you’re using a lure or incense, or are about to hatch some eggs, 
use a lucky egg to get a double XP boost.

2. Get that ball in the circle

You can increase the number of XP points you get from captures by landing the 
Pokéball in the closing circle, gaining at least 10 extra XP points per 
capture. The smaller the circle is when you hit it the greater the chance of 
the Pokémon staying locked in the ball too.

3. Curveball

 Throw a curve ball or get it in the circle to gain extra experience points.

There are several ways to throw a curveball. One is to simply bend your throw 
on the screen before releasing, but another is to make small circles on the 
screen with the Pokéball before releasing it. Landing a capture with a 
curveball gives you an extra 10XP and increases the chances of keeping the 
Pokémon in the ball. A curveball can be combined with the closing circle above 
for the more skilled.

It can be quite difficult to hit the Pokémon with a curveball, so make sure 
you have plenty of Pokéballs to hand before trying for the first couple of 
times.

4. Power up before evolving

The strength of an evolved Pokémon is directly related to the strength of the 
starting beast. Try to capture starting Pokémon with as many combat power (CP) 
as possible before evolving them. It can also be cheaper to power them up with 
candy and stardust before evolving them.

5. Match your type for battle

 Different types of Pokémon fare better against others in battle so choose 
wisely. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian 
Pokémon belong to a couple of classes 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay_of_Pok%C3%A9mon#/media/File:Pokemon_Type_Chart.svg>
 that offset each other in battle in a rock-paper-scissors-type mechanic. Grass 
is vulnerable to fire, while fire is vulnerable to water and water is 
vulnerable to grass, for instance. Attacks on vulnerable Pokémon do at least 
twice as much damage. Some are immune to attacks, while others have two types, 
which can either be good – one type negating the weakness of the other – or not 
so good when weaknesses are combined.

It’s worth checking out which Pokémon are in the gym you want to attack before 
choosing to go into battle to make sure you have the right types of Pokémon to 
succeed.

6. Only start fights you can win

As well type you have to be aware of the opponent’s CP. Like-for-like the 
higher CP Pokémonshould always prevail. It is possible to beat Pokémon with 
higher CP if type or luck is on your side, however, but big differences in CP 
are almost impossible to overcome.

7. Be quick on the taps and swipes

In battle, your ability to tap and swipe could be the difference between 
winning and losing. A single tap on the opponent’s Pokémon launches the 
standard attack. Once the attack bar fills up you can press and hold to unleash 
a special attack.

Meanwhile, swiping left and right will dodge an opponent’s attack if timed 
right, which can help save your Pokémon from being knocked out.

8. Hold gyms to gain Pokécoins

You can buy Pokécoins with real money, but you can also earn them by holding 
gyms, including those that you’re just supporting as part of your team, which 
makes it worth seeking them out.

Pokécoins can then be used to buy a bigger bag or Pokémon storage upgrade. A 
bigger bag helps with carrying all the lures, potions, revives incense, lucky 
eggs, razz berries and Pokéballs.
