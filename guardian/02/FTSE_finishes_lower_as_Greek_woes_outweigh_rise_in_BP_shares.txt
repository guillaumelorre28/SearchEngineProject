After a bright start, leading shares went into reverse as Greece's financial 
crisis took a turn for the worse.

With ratings agency Fitch downgrading Greek debt with a negative outlook, 
Norway suspending a $42m grant to the beleaguered country and talk of a 
possible default, theFTSE 100 finished 7.50 points lower at 5948.49 having 
earlier climbed as high as 6017. There were also renewed worries about Spain's 
finances ahead of regional elections. Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City 
Index, said:
 Traders [were] unwilling to hold buy positions over the weekend on continued 
instability in sentiment over Greece.
The decline would have been worse if not for a 12.1p rise in BP to 460p after 
partner Mitsui agreed to pay $1.1bn towards the costs of the Gulf of Mexico 
disaster, a move which added nearly 9 points to the leading index.
Among the fallers Lloyds Banking Group lost 1.52p to 51.61p as Goldman Sachs 
removed the bank from its buy list, whileAmec fell 13p to £11.74 as analysts 
suggested the oil services and engineering group was on the lookout for large 
deals, at the expense of any special dividend to shareholders.

Next dropped 42p to £22.26 following a warning from US retailer Gap that 
rising cotton prices would hit its profits, butAssociated British Foods, the 
owner of Primark, added 33p to £10.90 after Exane BNP Paribas raised its rating 
on the company from neutral to outperform.

ITV continued its rise after this week's positive note from Bernstein 
Research, up another 1.05p to 70.75p. There was also a spot of renewed bid 
speculation. Analysts at Liberum said:
 With net debt likely to be virtually zero by the year end and the market cap 
now down to £2.7bn, ITV may start attracting external interest. We see 
potential investors as including RTL, US TV companies and – less likely – 
Mediaset. 
There were a number of other takeover tales circulating. Micro Focus 
International jumped 28.8p to 398.6p as the IT group confirmed it has received 
separate approaches from private equity groups Bain Capital and Advent 
International. Software specialistMisys added 3.1p to 360p on continuing talk 
of a possible bid. Credit Suisse said in a recent note that rival Temenos or 
another banking specialist could be interested.

Lower down the market Jubilee Platinum, a South African miner, added 18% to 
30.875p after revealing a takeover approach, while longtime targetMinerva, the 
property developer, rose 7p to 302p as it confirmed it was in advanced talks 
with a number of possible bidders.

Elsewhere Imperial Tobacco fell 28p to £21.86 after the company cut prices on 
its cigarettes in Spain, suggesting a possible return to price wars.

Glencore fell below its 530p flotation price on the second day of dealings in 
the commodity trader's shares, down 6p at 524p. Even so, it will be 
fast-tracked to join the FTSE 100 at the close of business on Tuesday, the day 
unconditional dealings begin, at the expense ofInvensys, which will drop to the 
mid-cap index despite a 2.8p rise to 302.6p today.Investec, which was the other 
possible candidate for ejection, added 8p to 495p.

Alliance Trust dipped 0.9p to 380.8p as it defeated an annual meeting 
resolution from rebel investor Laxey Partners. Around two-thirds of 
shareholders in the investment trust rejected a proposal to set up an automatic 
share buyback programme.

Mitchells & Butlers dropped 17.4p to 319p following its results, with analysts 
blaming the fall on its failure to restart dividend payments or unveil a new 
chief executive.

But ITE added 9.2p to 243.6p after Goldman Sachs issued a positive note on the 
exhibitions and conference organiser. The bank said:
 [ITE] represents an attractive emerging markets play. With around 65% of its 
revenues derived in Russia, we believe ITE is well positioned to benefit from 
ongoing recovery in this region. 
Finally, energy efficiency group Energetix was steady at 18.75p as it 
announced former Ofgas boss Clare Spottiswoode would become its non-executive 
chair, while technology groupParseq put on 1.75p to 7.625p, continuing the 
gains made followingThursday's news of a multi-million pound contract
