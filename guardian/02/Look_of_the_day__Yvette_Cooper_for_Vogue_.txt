Alexandra Shulman, editor of Vogue revealed in a recent interview 
<http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/alexandra-shulman-i-wont-tell-women-they-need-surgery-or-diets-to-be-attractive-7614732.html>
 that the woman she's most like to see in Vogue is Shadow Home Secretary Yvette 
Cooper. Shulman described her as "a really good-looking woman, and it would be 
great to photograph her in some fantastic clothes, but I think she would feel 
it would damage her." Guardian fashion reckon Cooper would kill it in a bit of 
Stella McCartney tailoring and a Tabitha Simmons shoe. But alas, Shulman is 
right. It's unlikely.
