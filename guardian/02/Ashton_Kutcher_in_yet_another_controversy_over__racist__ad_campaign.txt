Don't expect Ashton Kutcher to appear in a remake of The Party 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOGx3P5THJs> any time soon. 

Part of an ad campaign starring the former Mr Demi Moore for the potato 
chip-style snack Popchips has been yanked over an outcry that a character he 
portrays is inherently racist.

In the campaign, which debuted Wednesday, the Two and a Half Men star appears 
as four drastcally different characters looking for love. One of them, "Raj", 
is a Bollywood producer played by Kutcher in brown face and stereotypical 
Indian garb, speaking with a sing-songy accent.

The ad, which is equally as offensive for attempting to pass itself off as 
funny, makes barely any mention of the Popchips product. Three related ads 
feature Kutcher playing other stereotypes: a Karl Lagerfeld-style fashionista, 
a stoner named Nigel, and a biker.

Outcry in the Indian community was immediate, and it spread from there. 
Complaints about the ad, which was developed by Popchips with Kutcher and an ad 
agency namedZambezi <http://www.zambezi-la.com/#/2495>, began appearing on the 
company's Facebook page almost immediately as well as on the brand's Twitter 
feed.

Anil Dash, a tech entrepreneur with considerable reach online, wrote in his 
blog <http://dashes.com/anil/> that the ad is "a hackneyed, unfunny 
advertisement featuring Kutcher in brownface talking about his romantic 
options, with the entire punchline being that he's doing it in a fake-Indian 
outfit and voice. That's it, there's seriously no other gag."

He added: "I can't imagine I have to explain this to anyone in 2012, but if 
you find yourself putting brown makeup on a white person in 2012 so they can do 
a bad 'funny' accent in order to sell potato chips, you are on the wrong 
course. Make some different decisions."

Multiethnic New York hip-hop group Das Racist also vented online, tweeting 
directly at Kutcher:
DAS RACIST (@dasracist)

video you talentless, pretending to care about sex trafficking piece of shit?

Later, they tweeted: "Hey if you care, call popchips...and register your 
concern, they got to pull this shit and apologize, that's it."

A spokesperson for the company initially released a statement defending the 
campaign "The new popchips worldwide dating video and ad campaign featuring 
four characters was created to provoke a few laughs and was never intended to 
stereotype or offend anyone," the statement went.

"At popchips we embrace all types of shapes, flavors and colors, and 
appreciate all snackers, no matter their race or ethnicity. We hope people can 
enjoy this in the spirit it was intended."

But ultimately the company bowed to pressure. The Raj character has been 
pulled the campaign, which will still go ahead with the other characters.

Popchips CEO Keith Belling apologized, writing on his blog: "I take full 
responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended."
