Night time politics: blessed are the mattress makers

 * My colleague Gareth Hutchens has a wonderful story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/02/institute-of-public-affairs-likens-coalition-to-bernie-sanders-over-superannuation>
 which has just surfaced. Hutchens writes: The Institute of Public Affairs has 
accused the Coalition of relying on the same language as Bernie Sanders and 
Jeremy Corbyn to defend its superannuation changes. The free market thinktank 
also says the public is seeing the fruits of the campaign it began waging 
against the government’s super changes three weeks ago, as more Coalition MPs 
start to understand how unfair the proposed changes are. 
 * Today, as the remains of 33 Australian soldiers were returned home, the 
government’s election campaign took a dive when Scott Morrison tried to make a 
political mileage against Labor. He decried Labor’s war against business (by 
opposing corporate tax cuts) and Bill Shorten’s toxic tax cuts. There were 
bullets flying, in ScoMo’s mind but in the end, the head of the Vietnam 
Veterans Association of Australia Ken Foster told him to pull his head in. 
Inappropriate, people. God knows I love a metaphor as much as the next person 
but ScoMo was left looking rather rather silly.

 * Better though was the enunciation of superannuation policy, putting unnamed 
Coalition backbenchers in their box. Malcolm Turnbull and Steve Ciobo argued 
giving superannuation policy a haircut was entirely reasonable. Bill Shorten 
still hammered the point that the retrospective nature of the $500,000 lifetime 
cap was unfair. Why does the tax office only make you keep receipts for five 
years and the Coalition want to reach back into your super contributions for 
nine years?

 * But never mind the super. A major seniors’ lobby group has warned the 
Coalition there is“red hot” anger over changes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/02/pension-changes-coalition-warned-of-red-hot-anger-election#comments>
 that will push 100,000 people off the aged pension and said seniors would 
rally during the election campaign. 
 * Shorten announced under Labor, the government would derive 50% of its 
energy mix from renewable sources by 2030. He also spent a bit of time at the 
fish markets eating oysters. He stayed away from a rat though. Not a good 
picture for a leader.

 * Malcolm Turnbull went to a mattress factory in Sydney to sing the praises 
of artisan mattress makers, namely Neville, the bearded stitcher. According to 
the PM, Neville is practically a celebrity in China, where the company ships 
many mattresses.

That’s it for us. Mel Davey will see you in the morning, followed by Katharine 
Murphy at 8.30am. 


Good night.

Michael Kroger, Victorian president, says the issue of superannuation changes 
is well down the list reported to him by Liberal members

Two this week have said they have had a couple of people complain...It is a 
low level issue, seventh or eighth down the list.

Helen Davidson

Earlier this morning the head of the Northern Land Council let rip on the 
Indigenous affairs minister,Nigel Scullion.

Addressing a native title conference in Darwin, Joe Morrison said Scullion was 
“not up to the job” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/02/nigel-scullion-not-up-to-job-of-indigenous-affairs-minister-says-land-council-chief>
 and that if the Coalition won governmentMalcolm Turnbull should replace him.

The speech was fiery, but not unexpected - the two have history.

This afternoon Scullion has returned fire.

In a statement to Guardian Australia the minister said he was sorry he’d 
missed Morrison’s speech and he hadn’t yet had a chance to read it.

But I understand he spent most of it focusing on me instead of some of the 
real successes we are seeing in the Indigenous Affairs space - including here 
in the NT.

Just today, I was at Wadeye ... what a remarkable turnaround there has been 
there! People are engaged through our CDP program in things such as painting 
houses and looking after gardens.

This is the same CDP Joe said the NLC didn’t like - although we all know Joe 
didn’t tell his chairman or the full council that he planned to oppose the CDP 
in the NLC’s submission to the Senate enquiry.

I had an obligation to tell the NLC Council at its meeting in Ngukurr that Joe 
had lodged that submission without letting his chairman know what was in it.

And I suppose Joe is still a little cranky about that, so I wonder if that 
helps to explain his motivation for today’s rant.

Joe hasn’t had the best of starts as CEO, but I have to say, I am truly hoping 
he gets better at his job. His council, but more importantly, his constituents 
deserve better and I just hope Joe has it in him to lift his performance so 
that the Aboriginal people living here are better served.

On to superannuation policy.

Peta Credlin has previously said the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> needs to defend the 
super policy or fix it. Credlin thinks Turnbull did a decent job today at 
explaining the super policy. She was not so flattering aboutArthur Sinodinos.

The issue isn’t Malcolm Turnbull here, the issue is his colleagues who have 
been all over the place.

Sky commentator Peta Credlin is speaking with David Speers and Kristina 
Keneally now. (She reminds us that Tony Abbott made the decision to repatriate 
the remains of 33 casualties of the Vietnam war).

Asked whether the leaders should have been there, both Credlin and Keneally 
say yes.

Credlin says the war was a tough issue in many families. 

The point Tony Abbott made...was it would be a way to unite Australia 
particularly ahead of the anniversary of Long Tan.

The ABC reports the president of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia,
Ken Foster, has taken exception to the “war” language used by Malcolm Turnbull 
andScott Morrison, particularly today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/australian-war-dead-to-finally-reach-home>
.

To be over there with the families and for them to go home tonight and see a 
comparison of the war that their family members were killed in and have just 
been brought home from around 50 years later for a political argument, I see 
that as tasteless in the extreme.

Bill Shorten has accepted an invitation to attend a Sky News people’s forum 
next Wednesday. We await news from the prime minister’s office as to whether he 
will attend. Given the people’s forum is win cahoots with the Courier Mail, we 
can assume it will be in Brisbane.

Labor's renewables policy: take advantage of our advantages

Paul Karp

A pull together of Labor’s renewables policy from Paul Karp.

The policy announcement from Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek at the 
University of New South Wales is about the government using renewable energy.

Today I will be announcing that a Commonwealth government by 2030 will be 
deriving 50% of its energy mix from renewable sources. What we will do is put 
markers in the ground, pegs in the ground so we help create a market for 
investment in renewable energy.

So that’s a bit like a household picking the green option from their power 
provider, except on a much larger scale. Labor says that 10-15 year contracts 
from the Commonwealth government will give the certainty needed for long term 
investment in the renewable energy sector.

The research which we’ve been privileged to see this morning is going to drive 
a new wave of investment, advanced manufacturing, helping households have lower 
prices for their energy and also cutting pollution. The University of NSW 
should be congratulated.

We’re the sunniest continent in the world but last year the United Kingdom had 
four times the amount of solar roof top installation that Australia had because 
of uncertainty under the Liberals.”

Shorten said Australia should take advantage of its advantages - sunny climate 
and solar research.

Australians should have a government in Canberra who is determined to take 
real action on climate change by focusing on renewable energy.

Back to the Labor policy of the day, Bill Shorten was asked for a costing. 
Don’t you worry about that chaps, was the response.

Q: How can you say there’ll be no net cost on the policy today, we don’t know 
what renewables is going to cost in 10 years?

Bill Shorten:

Well, I would just submit to you history and evidence. Back in 2000 barely 100 
suburban rooftops had solar panels now there’s 1.5 million. If you look at 
every examination at the startling and significant improvements in the scale 
and the cost of renewable energy, again I’m giving a shout out to the 
professors and researchers here, they are now getting 35% efficiency in terms 
of conversion of sunlight to energy. They’re not stopping at 35% or 34.7%. 
These guys and girls are going to deliver remarkable outcomes. I’m very 
confident when you watch the impact, the combination of our natural resources, 
sunlight, great researchers, and a Labor government, all the trendline is down 
in terms of the cost.

Q: So has it been costed then?
Bill Shorten:

In terms of what I said, everything. Warburton did a review which showed that 
renewable energy has a downward pressure in terms of household prices –

Q: But some of –
Bill Shorten:

I just want to keep unpacking this, Tommy, I’m going to keep unpacking it and 
then you can sort of give me your opinion. Yesterday, we were up in Brisbane. 
You saw those lithium batteries, the technology is practically changing in 
front of our eyes and we saw the range of new technologies. I have no doubt if 
you look at the tipping point about investment and renewable energy I could 
submit to you another number which shouldn’t be ignored in this debate about 
real action on climate change. Two million jobs have been added around the 
world in renewable energy jobs. One country has managed to lose nearly 3000 
jobs. That’s Australia. Now Australians, we’ve got the best in the world 
research here and yet we’re coming towards the bottom of the world in terms of 
jobs, the missing link between converting our natural advantages, our 
scientific genius, the hard work of a lot of people, the desire by Australian 
families to have lower household electricity prices is a government who is 
going to take real action on climate change.

Today there has been a solemn repatriation ceremony 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/australian-war-dead-to-finally-reach-home>
 where 21 Vietnam veterans, three killed in Malaysian conflicts, two spouses 
and six children, have been returned to Australia. The bodies had been buried 
at the Terendak cemetery in Malaysia, on what is still an operating military 
base. While prime minister,Tony Abbott pledged to allow the repatriation to 
occur, and it was carried out this morning.

The shadow treasurer Chris Bowen referred to that event in a media conference 
a little while ago, indicating that if the prime minister and the treasurer 
wanted to get into the war metaphors for a bit of intra-day campaigning, they 
might chose another day.

Chris Bowen:

The prime minister and treasurer might want to reflect on the use of that 
language today. Especially today. They might want to reflect on that. The 
Australian people have a right to be disappointed in the prime minister’s 
language. I don’t intend to add anything further to that. They might want to 
reflect about the use of that language on a day when we are considering war in 
another context.

There’s been some criticism around today that neither the prime minister nor 
the opposition leader went to the ceremony today. The governor-general 
presided. I’m not outraged about it, but everyone is obviously free to have 
their own views about it. The prime minister was asked about it during his 
press conference earlier, and this is what he said.

Malcolm Turnbull:

It’s a very solemn moment. It’s the largest - as you know, a very large 
repatriation of remains of former servicemen and their families. The 
governor-general is representing the Commonwealth as our head of state and the 
defence minister and minister for veterans’ affairs and their shadow 
counterparts are there as well.

That is an appropriate and very dignified and respectful representation of the 
nation, as we bring the remains of those who served our nation bravely, home.

 * My colleague Gareth Hutchens has a wonderful story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/02/institute-of-public-affairs-likens-coalition-to-bernie-sanders-over-superannuation>
 which has just surfaced. Hutchens writes: The Institute of Public Affairs has 
accused the Coalition of relying on the same language as Bernie Sanders and 
Jeremy Corbyn to defend its superannuation changes. The free market thinktank 
also says the public is seeing the fruits of the campaign it began waging 
against the government’s super changes three weeks ago, as more Coalition MPs 
start to understand how unfair the proposed changes are. 
 * Today, as the remains of 33 Australian soldiers were returned home, the 
government’s election campaign took a dive when Scott Morrison tried to make a 
political mileage against Labor. He decried Labor’s war against business (by 
opposing corporate tax cuts) and Bill Shorten’s toxic tax cuts. There were 
bullets flying, in ScoMo’s mind but in the end, the head of the Vietnam 
Veterans Association of Australia Ken Foster told him to pull his head in. 
Inappropriate, people. God knows I love a metaphor as much as the next person 
but ScoMo was left looking rather rather silly.

 * Better though was the enunciation of superannuation policy, putting unnamed 
Coalition backbenchers in their box. Malcolm Turnbull and Steve Ciobo argued 
giving superannuation policy a haircut was entirely reasonable. Bill Shorten 
still hammered the point that the retrospective nature of the $500,000 lifetime 
cap was unfair. Why does the tax office only make you keep receipts for five 
years and the Coalition want to reach back into your super contributions for 
nine years?

 * But never mind the super. A major seniors’ lobby group has warned the 
Coalition there is“red hot” anger over changes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/02/pension-changes-coalition-warned-of-red-hot-anger-election#comments>
 that will push 100,000 people off the aged pension and said seniors would 
rally during the election campaign. 
 * Shorten announced under Labor, the government would derive 50% of its 
energy mix from renewable sources by 2030. He also spent a bit of time at the 
fish markets eating oysters. He stayed away from a rat though. Not a good 
picture for a leader.

 * Malcolm Turnbull went to a mattress factory in Sydney to sing the praises 
of artisan mattress makers, namely Neville, the bearded stitcher. According to 
the PM, Neville is practically a celebrity in China, where the company ships 
many mattresses.

That’s it for us. Mel Davey will see you in the morning, followed by Katharine 
Murphy at 8.30am. 


Good night.
 
Michael Kroger, Victorian president, says the issue of superannuation changes 
is well down the list reported to him by Liberal members

Two this week have said they have had a couple of people complain...It is a 
low level issue, seventh or eighth down the list.
 
Earlier this morning the head of the Northern Land Council let rip on the 
Indigenous affairs minister,Nigel Scullion.

Addressing a native title conference in Darwin, Joe Morrison said Scullion was 
“not up to the job” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/02/nigel-scullion-not-up-to-job-of-indigenous-affairs-minister-says-land-council-chief>
 and that if the Coalition won governmentMalcolm Turnbull should replace him.

The speech was fiery, but not unexpected - the two have history.

This afternoon Scullion has returned fire.

In a statement to Guardian Australia the minister said he was sorry he’d 
missed Morrison’s speech and he hadn’t yet had a chance to read it.

But I understand he spent most of it focusing on me instead of some of the 
real successes we are seeing in the Indigenous Affairs space - including here 
in the NT.

Just today, I was at Wadeye ... what a remarkable turnaround there has been 
there! People are engaged through our CDP program in things such as painting 
houses and looking after gardens.

This is the same CDP Joe said the NLC didn’t like - although we all know Joe 
didn’t tell his chairman or the full council that he planned to oppose the CDP 
in the NLC’s submission to the Senate enquiry.

I had an obligation to tell the NLC Council at its meeting in Ngukurr that Joe 
had lodged that submission without letting his chairman know what was in it.

And I suppose Joe is still a little cranky about that, so I wonder if that 
helps to explain his motivation for today’s rant.

Joe hasn’t had the best of starts as CEO, but I have to say, I am truly hoping 
he gets better at his job. His council, but more importantly, his constituents 
deserve better and I just hope Joe has it in him to lift his performance so 
that the Aboriginal people living here are better served.
 
On to superannuation policy.

Peta Credlin has previously said the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> needs to defend the 
super policy or fix it. Credlin thinks Turnbull did a decent job today at 
explaining the super policy. She was not so flattering aboutArthur Sinodinos.

The issue isn’t Malcolm Turnbull here, the issue is his colleagues who have 
been all over the place.
 
Sky commentator Peta Credlin is speaking with David Speers and Kristina 
Keneally now. (She reminds us that Tony Abbott made the decision to repatriate 
the remains of 33 casualties of the Vietnam war).

Asked whether the leaders should have been there, both Credlin and Keneally 
say yes.

Credlin says the war was a tough issue in many families. 

The point Tony Abbott made...was it would be a way to unite Australia 
particularly ahead of the anniversary of Long Tan.
 
The ABC reports the president of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia,
Ken Foster, has taken exception to the “war” language used by Malcolm Turnbull 
andScott Morrison, particularly today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/australian-war-dead-to-finally-reach-home>
.

To be over there with the families and for them to go home tonight and see a 
comparison of the war that their family members were killed in and have just 
been brought home from around 50 years later for a political argument, I see 
that as tasteless in the extreme.
 
Bill Shorten has accepted an invitation to attend a Sky News people’s forum

A pull together of Labor’s renewables policy from Paul Karp.

The policy announcement from Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek at the 
University of New South Wales is about the government using renewable energy.

Today I will be announcing that a Commonwealth government by 2030 will be 
deriving 50% of its energy mix from renewable sources. What we will do is put 
markers in the ground, pegs in the ground so we help create a market for 
investment in renewable energy.

So that’s a bit like a household picking the green option from their power 
provider, except on a much larger scale. Labor says that 10-15 year contracts 
from the Commonwealth government will give the certainty needed for long term 
investment in the renewable energy sector.

The research which we’ve been privileged to see this morning is going to drive 
a new wave of investment, advanced manufacturing, helping households have lower 
prices for their energy and also cutting pollution. The University of NSW 
should be congratulated.

We’re the sunniest continent in the world but last year the United Kingdom had 
four times the amount of solar roof top installation that Australia had because 
of uncertainty under the Liberals.”

Shorten said Australia should take advantage of its advantages - sunny climate 
and solar research.

Australians should have a government in Canberra who is determined to take 
real action on climate change by focusing on renewable energy.
 
And with that, I’m going to bid you a fond farewell for this evening because I 
need to return to podcast duties. Again, you will be in the marvellous hands of
Gabrielle Chan. Thanks for your company. I’ll see you again in the morning.
 
Back to the Labor policy of the day, Bill Shorten was asked for a costing. 
Don’t you worry about that chaps, was the response.

Q: How can you say there’ll be no net cost on the policy today, we don’t know 
what renewables is going to cost in 10 years?

Bill Shorten:

Well, I would just submit to you history and evidence. Back in 2000 barely 100 
suburban rooftops had solar panels now there’s 1.5 million. If you look at 
every examination at the startling and significant improvements in the scale 
and the cost of renewable energy, again I’m giving a shout out to the 
professors and researchers here, they are now getting 35% efficiency in terms 
of conversion of sunlight to energy. They’re not stopping at 35% or 34.7%. 
These guys and girls are going to deliver remarkable outcomes. I’m very 
confident when you watch the impact, the combination of our natural resources, 
sunlight, great researchers, and a Labor government, all the trendline is down 
in terms of the cost.

Q: So has it been costed then?
Bill Shorten:

In terms of what I said, everything. Warburton did a review which showed that 
renewable energy has a downward pressure in terms of household prices –

Q: But some of –
Bill Shorten:

I just want to keep unpacking this, Tommy, I’m going to keep unpacking it and 
then you can sort of give me your opinion. Yesterday, we were up in Brisbane. 
You saw those lithium batteries, the technology is practically changing in 
front of our eyes and we saw the range of new technologies. I have no doubt if 
you look at the tipping point about investment and renewable energy I could 
submit to you another number which shouldn’t be ignored in this debate about 
real action on climate change. Two million jobs have been added around the 
world in renewable energy jobs. One country has managed to lose nearly 3000 
jobs. That’s Australia. Now Australians, we’ve got the best in the world 
research here and yet we’re coming towards the bottom of the world in terms of 
jobs, the missing link between converting our natural advantages, our 
scientific genius, the hard work of a lot of people, the desire by Australian 
families to have lower household electricity prices is a government who is 
going to take real action on climate change.
 
Today there has been a solemn repatriation ceremony 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/australian-war-dead-to-finally-reach-home>
 where 21 Vietnam veterans, three killed in Malaysian conflicts, two spouses
