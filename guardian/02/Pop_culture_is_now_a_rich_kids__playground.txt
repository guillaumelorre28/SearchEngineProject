To John Harris’s misgivings about the affordability of pop culture (Pop music 
was a great leveller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/16/pop-music-bespoke-plaything-wealth-divide>
, 16 November) might be added misgivings about who’s making it. The children of 
the rich are increasingly dominating the popular arts. The writers of the 
popular culture explosion of the late 50s and 60s came from the backgrounds 
that they wrote about, and its musicians, photographers and stylists grew up 
with one foot in the street and the other in art school. Even grammar school 
products like Mick Jagger were a bit of a rarity. If this continues, we will 
end up with a fossilised popular arts scene dominated in drama by modern-day 
Cowards and Rattigans, and in music without the periodic kick-starts provided 
by the Beatles and punk.
