Oliver Stone <https://www.theguardian.com/film/oliver-stone> has defended his 
latest film, Alexander, saying its themes and approaches are too complex for 
Hollywood tastes. The movie has had disappointing box office in the US.

The director told attendees at a film festival in Marrakech that the bold 
themes were too risqu√© for filmgoers with "conventional minds".

The three-hour epic starring Colin Farrell as Alexander 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alexander> the Great was filmed in Morocco, 
India and London and was backed largely by European funds.

It has been a flop in the US, taking roughly $29m in its first two weeks, 
having cost $150m to make. Many reviewers in the US laid into the film, some 
taking issue with depictions of Alexander and his male confidant and lover 
Hephaistion.

Quite naturally, the Oscar winning director of Platoon, Wall Street and JFK 
has been unflagging in his defence of the film. According to Screendaily.com he 
told an audience at the Moroccan event: "The script was just too ambiguous, too 
questioning about an action-hero who was masculine/feminine.

"These are tough qualities in Hollywood.

"It's just too big a life. It doesn't fit in into the Hollywood formula."

Stone speculated that Hollywood producers and studios would have transformed 
the story into a revenge saga as Alexander pursued the men who killed his 
father. "Revenge movies are the western ethos," he said "One of the problems 
with the movie for the conventional mind is there is no villain."

Stone also denied rumours circulating in the press that he was preparing to 
direct a biopic of Margaret Thatcher.

Alexander opens in the UK on January 7 2005.
