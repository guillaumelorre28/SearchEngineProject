Investors are suing Hewlett-Packard for failing to spot alleged accounting 
irregularities at Autonomy

, the British software company it bought for £7.1bn last year.

In a class action lawsuit filed in San Fransisco late on Monday night the 
investors claim HP concealed alleged accounting manipulation atAutonomy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/autonomycorporation> between the 
announcement of the deal last summer and last week when it took a $8.8bn 
(£5.4bn) writedown against the deal.

"At the time Hewlett-Packard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/hewlettpackard> agreed in principle to 
acquire Autonomy, defendants were looking to unwind the deal in light of the 
accounting irregularities that plagued Autonomy's financial statements," the 
lawsuit states.

HP said the alleged manipulation of financial performance at Autonomy had not 
been spotted at the time of the deal, and was only revealed later by a 
whistleblower. It said $5m of the writedown was related to the alleged 
accounting improprieties.

Mike Lynch, Autonomy's founder and former chief executive, has strongly denied 
the claims

. "They've had to do a very big writedown and they tried to blame it on the 
accounting but obviously something else is going on. People realise I'm 
certainly not going to be used as HP's scapegoat when it's got itself in a 
mess," he said.
