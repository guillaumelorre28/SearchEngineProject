Andrew Lloyd Webber confirmed she dropped out to return to the UK’s X Factor 
judging panel andadmitted he was “furious” about it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/13/andrew-lloyd-webber-gets-claws-out-after-nicole-scherzinger-pulls-out-of-cats>
.

At the time he told The Economist Radio: “I mean, she’s crazy. But the 
American producers just took a view – ‘Well, fine, we’ll get somebody else,’ 
because she’s actually not very well known in America, amazingly. She’s much 
better known here.”

The musical theatre supremo said Scherzinger’s move had made him look foolish.

He said: “I’m furious, because I really believe she’s the most fantastically 
talented girl, and I went out on a limb to get her for the London Palladium 
here, and it makes me look like an absolute twot with them all.

“But never mind, there’ll be another girl on Broadway and Nicole will not get 
her Tony award.”

Lloyd Webber tweeted: “Very excited to welcome @leonalewis to the CatsMusical 
family in CatsBroadway. #TeamALW.”

Lewis won the third series of The X Factor in 2006 and went on to achieve 
success with singles including Bleeding Love, Run and Better in Time.
