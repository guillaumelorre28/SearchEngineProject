Aim

"To facilitate a secure and reliable record of registrable facts 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2006/ukpga_20060015_en_1> about individuals in 
the United Kingdom and to ensure a convenient method for individuals to prove 
registrable facts about themselves."

Main provisions

• Provides the legal framework to establish a national identity register and 
to issue identity cards.
• Lists more than 50 possible categories of information for the register 
including date and place of birth, principal place of residence, every other 
place of UK or overseas residence, head and shoulder photograph, signature, 
fingerprints, and other biometric information (which might include iris scans, 
and a facial measurement template).
• Enables the government to authorise additional information categories by 
regulation, on a single vote of each house.
• Permits the home secretary to "designate" any document issued under a 
statutory power, making it a condition of applying for such a document that you 
join the national identity register.
• Requires a cost estimate for the following 10 years of the identity card 
scheme to be presented to parliament once every six months.
• Empowers the government to create regulations to make "public services 
conditional on identity checks 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060015_en_2#pb5-l1g13>" in 
England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

personal details can be punished by a penalty of up to £1,000.
• Enables a number of public authorities access 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060015_en_2#pb6-l1g17> to the 
information on the database, including the Secret Intelligence Service, GCHQ, 
Serious Organised Crime Agency, and HM Revenue and Customs and any government 
department.
• Provides for the Home Office to pass information 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/feb/20/immigrationpolicy.idcards> on 
the register toany other public authority 
<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/idcard/uk/hobenefitsjun2005.pdf> 
where deemed necessary for security, law enforcement, prevention of crime or 
government efficiency.

Background

Within weeks of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, home secretary David 
Blunkett waspublicly discussing proposals 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blunkett-giving-high-priority-to-compulsory-id-cards-670573.html>
 to introduce a compulsory identity card, though the government went on to 
reject them.

In 2002 the Home Office began a consultation exercise on the introduction of "
entitlement cards <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2084860.stm>" and in 
November 2003, itpublished a report 
<http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.archive2.official-documents.co.uk%2Fdocument%2Fcm60%2F6020%2F6020.pdf&ei=Y5RrSaqoFtzFjAeGw9izBw&usg=AFQjCNFB9VYkQLrlT59KinZNt3cSy0heTg&sig2=VVwboUGevaE6AQAnGe_Y9Q>
 laying out the government's plans for a "national, compulsory ID card".

The government said the scheme was essential to protect Britain against 
terrorism, organised crime and prevent identity theft, illegal immigration and 
illegal working but acabinet wrangle  
<http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/identitycards/Cabinet-split-over-plan-to.2513463.jp>
 over whether it should becompulsory or voluntary 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1572026.stm> or indeed whether it was 
worthwhile 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/oct/13/freedomofinformation.humanrights>
 delayed the publication of a draft bill until April 2004. Thebill itself was 
published 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/apr/26/immigrationpolicy.humanrights> 
in November 2004.

After Blunkett's resignation 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/dec/15/davidblunkett.immigrationpolicy1>, 
just prior to the bill's second reading in December 2004, the new home 
secretary, Charles Clarke, rejected a Liberal Democrat call to "pause for 
thought" on identity cards.Clarke described the bill 
<http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article404360.ece>
 as a "profoundly civil libertarian measure because it promotes the most 
fundamental civil liberty in our society, which is the right to live free from 
crime and fear".

The bill had the formal support 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4095471.stm> of Conservatives, under 
the leadership of Michael Howard, although several senior members of the shadow 
cabinet had expressed severe misgivings about the ID cards. The Tories 
attempted to reconcile this cabinet split by maintaining support for identity 
cards in principle but saying they could not support the legislation unless it
passed five tests <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/mar/22/lords.idcards>
: robust technology; clarity of purpose; cost-effectiveness; efficient 
organisation; and the safeguarding of civil liberties.

Time constraints in a busy legislative calendar meant the government was 
unable to push the bill through parliament before theApril 2005 election 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/election2005>. Labour's 2005 manifesto 
stated <http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/LAB_uk_manifesto.pdf>: 
"We will introduce ID cards, including biometric data like fingerprints, backed 
up by a national register and rolling out initially on a voluntary basis as 
people renew their passports."

By the time the new parliament convened, opposition to ID cards had hardened 
on several fronts. The scheme's detractors argued registering individuals when 
they applied for a designated document (for example, a passport) amounted to "
compulsion by the back door 
<http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-24.htm>
". Fears also began to grow that the government's costing analysis, £6bn over 
10 years, was optimistic. In June 2005, the London School of Economics released 
a report estimating the cost over 10 years at between £10.6bn and £19.2bn, a 
figuredismissed by Clarke 
<http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=News&tBrand=edponline&tCategory=news&itemid=NOED03%20Sep%202005%2010%3A09%3A19%3A520>
 as "complete nonsense".

The bill received its third reading  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/oct/18/humanrights.idcards>in the 
Commons on 18 October 2005. The home secretary promised to guard against 
"function creep", assuring the house that sensitive information like criminal 
convictions, financial records and religious faith would be excluded from the 
national identity register. The bill passed by309 votes to 284 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/oct/19/idcards.immigrationpolicy>. 

Peers voted five times to reject plans to require applicants for passports to 
accept an ID card but in March 2006, they passed the bill. Tory peers had been 
mollified by a government concession that delayed issuing the first cards for 
British nationals until January 2010, giving David Cameron a chance to campaign 
against a project he described as "profoundly unBritish 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/sunday_am/4614218.stm>" and a "monument 
to thefailure of big government 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/jan/18/houseofcommons.uk>". 

Since March 2006, the scheme has been beset by delays 
<http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/managingourborders/astrongnewforceattheborder/strongnewforce.pdf?view=Binaryf>
.

In December 2007, the Identity and Passport Service, the branch of the Home 
Office responsible for delivering the scheme, announced they haddropped plans 
to utilise iris scans 
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/09/government_drops_iris_scans_for_id_cards>
. Plans tocompulsorily register 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2008/mar/06/wrap.idcards> on the National 
Identity Register the details of people who apply for a passport have drifted 
to 2012.

In November 2008, the UK Border Agency began issuing the first identity cards 
– visas designed to form part of the ID scheme when it is established – to some 
foreign nationals from outside the European Economic Area (students and those 
applying for a spouse visa). The home secretary Jacqui Smith has announced 
plans to begin an 18-month pilot scheme this year for airside workers at 
Manchester and London City airports. Both the Conservatives and Liberal 
Democrats have both announced they would scrap the scheme but home office 
minister Meg Hillier has said there "isn't aneasy way to unpick 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7712275.stm> this scheme."

Criticism


NO2ID, the campaign group set up by opponents of the scheme, was angered by 
the bill's enabling agenda. Early drafts of the bill did not require new 
primary legislation in order to make the scheme compulsory. The final act 
allows the home secretary to make changes by an order, meaning they would 
receive only cursory parliamentary oversight.

Liberty vigorously opposed the introduction of the act and has consistently 
campaigned against it, noting that the privacy implications of the scheme are 
profound and that it has "far reachingimplications for the relationship 
<http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/pdfs/policy04/id-card-draft-bill-response.pdf>
 between the individual and the state". The government's official privacy 
watchdog,Richard Thomas, told MPs 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3787971.stm> that identity cards would 
represent a "sea change in the relationship between state and every individual 
in this country."

There are myriad concerns about the future security of the government's 
database. Privacy campaigners argue the database will create an enormous target 
for abuse: in particular thatvulnerable groups 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/3615768/Daily-Telegraph-letters.html>
 such as members of the witness protection programme, scientists involved in 
animal experimentation, celebrities andvictims of domestic violence 
<http://www.no2id.net/TakeJane/nothing2hide> will find that their personal 
details are sold to the highest bidder or circulated among interested parties. 
There is already a substantial body ofanecdotal evidence 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/11/british-asian-forced-marriages> 
that existing government databases are used to trace victims of domestic 
violence.

In December 2007, Thomas told the justice select committee that the government 
needed to review its plans for the identity scheme in the wake of the loss of 
25m child benefit records, which included names and addresses of recipients.

Thomas said: "Keeping this massive database with records of every time the 
card is swiped through a terminal is distinctly unattractive and would increase 
the risks."

This idea of an audit trail is of key concern to privacy campaigners who point 
out the register could provide a detailed log of every identity check creating 
a map of individual's movements and transactions.

The Identity and Passport Service provides a list 
<http://www.ips.gov.uk/identity/how-organisations.asp> of other organisations 
and businesses it expects to utilise the scheme. In total they estimate that 
265 government departments and 44,000 private sector organisations will be 
accredited to verify identity using the national identity register. In May 
2007, James Hall, chief of the Identity and Passport Service, admitted that the 
government intended toallow the audit trail 
<http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:EMFDCqZrvZAJ:www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page10969.asp+%22I+sort+of+feel+'damned+if+you+do,+damned+if+you+don't'+with+this.+The+audit+trail+is+an+important+protection+so+that+citizens+can+see+who+has+accessed+their+record+and+when.+But+on+the+other+hand,+I+understand+there+is+also+a+concern+that+it+could+be+used+to+infer+something+about+a+pattern+of+activities.&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=uk&client=firefox-a>
 to be used by the police or security services in the case of serious crimes.

Phil Booth, national coordinator of the NO2ID campaign <http://www.no2id.net/>
, says: "Each time anyone checks on your ID, it will be recorded. That means 
that over time the authorities could build up a very accurate picture of 
everything you do."
