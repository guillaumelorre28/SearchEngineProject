Would-be Manhattan socialite Brooke (Gerwig) is 30 and almost over-the-hill: 
none of her dreams have panned out, and now she is frantically trying to raise 
funds to open a restaurant. Into her life walks her stepsister-to-be, Tracy 
(Kirke), who needs a friend and mentor. What starts as a breezy, French New 
Wave-influenced comedy in the style of Baumbach and Gerwig’s Frances Ha soon 
spirals off into screwball delirium in a second half, which has all the creaky 
mechanics of a Broadway farce. Not all of it gels, but Gerwig is spectacular.
