Good night and farewell for the #ausvotes week

The campaigns have gone to bed (well not really, let’s say the public face of 
the campaigns in any case) so let’s part ways for now, and prepare for a brief 
moment of weekend zen.

But first, let’s take stock of the day.

 * Labor bookended a week of focus on the economy and costings with the 
release of new savings measures, which include more means testing for family 
payments, restrictions on private health insurance rebates and savings across a 
range of portfolios. Labor has also grabbed some of the Abbott government’s 
savings measures from the 2014 budget, namely a cut to R&D concessions and 
three university measures – and is now trying to turn pressure on the 
government for carrying forward more than $5bn worth of “zombies” savings that 
will never pass the senate unless the Senate becomes occupied by a new bunch of 
people.

 * The Coalition had a quieter day. Malcolm Turnbull gave his stump speech to 
the Menzies Research Centre and used the opportunity to launch a plea for 
voters to back the government in both houses if they wanted to avoid a hung 
parliament. Resist the temptation of a protest vote, the prime minister said, 
otherwise .. chaos.

 * Round the country, ballot orders were sorted, and independent Rob Oakeshott 
announced a comeback to politics in the seat of Cowper.

 * That was the guts of Friday. Thanks so much for hanging in today and over 
the course of the week. I’ll be back next week. A reminder that thefirst of our 
live election events kicks off in Sydney, next week, we’d love it if you’d join 
us. In Sydney,Lenore Taylor and I will be joined by Tanya Plibersek, deputy 
leader of the opposition and shadow minister for foreign affairs and 
international development,Trent Zimmerman, the Liberal MP for North Sydney (Joe 
Hockey’s successor) andCassandra Goldie, chief executive of Australian Council 
of Social Service. We’ll be talking about fairness, a key election theme. I 
suspectMike Bowers might stop by, and if you would like to as well, you can 
find the details here.

The thing that needs to be mentioned about Labor and cuts that I haven’t yet 
mentioned is today is not the end of the matter. There are more cuts to come. I 
suspect we’ll see more into next week as Labor steams through to the official 
campaign launch, which will likely see the unveiling of another big spending 
policy.

For the purposes of illustration, we can compare the impact of the Labor cuts 
with the government’s cuts that are still built into the budget. Given the 
government says it is seeking a mandate for its savings measures let’s remind 
people what they are.

 * The Family Tax Benefit A end of year supplement of $726 per child is paid 
to around 1.5m families. That will cease.

 * Family Tax Benefit B end of year supplements worth $354 per family goes to 
around 1.3m families. That will cease.

 * Reducing Family Tax Benefit B for single parents whose youngest child is 
over 13 translates to a cut of around $1,700 a year.

I’ve been chasing particulars on who is impacted by Labor’s announcements on 
family tax benefit.

 * The measure reducing Family Tax benefit A end of year supplements by 50% 
for families earning over 100,000will impact 137,000 families. These families 
will lose $366 per child per year.

 * Labor continuing the current freeze on the top income limits for family tax 
benefits means families on more than around $94,000 a year will receive a 
reduced payment if their income increases over time.

Resurrecting the zombie of Tony Abbott

Now we are passed the treasurer, some comments from the Greens leader Richard 
Di Natale.

We are hearing a lot about zombie measures in the budget, well today the Labor 
party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> are resurrecting 
the zombie of Tony Abbott by refusing to join with the Greens and the community 
in saying no to harsh cuts for students, families and research. Four billion 
has been slashed from higher education funding, leaving Australians that want 
to access higher education through the HECS-HELP benefit scheme without 
support. The $5.5bn of savings announced today pale in comparison to the $13bn 
of savings measures the Greens have identified that could be achieved by 
phasing out the private health insurance rebate to be reinvested into our 
public health system.

The Greens believe that we should be raising revenue and investing in the 
foundations of a decent society. We are disappointed that Labor has sided with 
big business and theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> when it comes to 
standing up for everyday people. While the old parties are cutting away parts 
of our family payments system, the Greens have announced policies that would 
see a real funding increase in income support, including for the most 
vulnerable in our society.

Any good savings measures there you can pick up? No.

Q: With respect to the spending side of things, in respect to savings, were 
there any new measures that the government can support, including cutting the 
health rebate to natural therapies?

Scott Morrison:

Our measures are set out in our budget and we stand by that.

Scott Morrison:

I mean, it is really embarrassing what we saw here today. These numbers don’t 
add up. At the end of the dayBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> keeps digging a hole 
on his spending, and the hole gets deeper and deeper. And what they announced 
today doesn’t cover it, it doesn’t come close to covering it, and so the 
Australian people, I think, are faced with a very straightforward choice.. They 
can vote for Labor and vote for higher deficits and higher debt, or they are 
support the government’s economic plan which will keep us on that positive 
trajectory towards a budget balance by 2021 based on the current assumptions 
around the parameters.

What we saw today frankly was embarrassing.

Scott Morrison opens with bluff and bluster

The treasurer is opening his rebuttal with bluff and bluster. Labor’s bluff 
and bluster. But thus far he’s pretty heavy on the bluff and bluster himself. 
He gets to some numbers eventually.

Scott Morrison:

They have gone from a cumulative figure of $16.3bn in improvements to $16.9bn 
in improvements, from the additional savings measures they have outlined today.

(Have they? Not sure where that comes from.)

They have announced a net improvement on their previous position of just 
$2.4bn. Now, that’s before they have even spent a cent, even spent a cent.

(I honestly have no idea where the treasurer is getting these numbers from.)

Before that, I should pull my head out of the calculator and the campaign fact 
sheet to give you the top line political perspective and consumer perspective: 
Labor has announced cuts to family tax benefits and health insurance benefits 
and some higher education things in order to send a signal to voters on budget 
management. Additionally it has clarified its position on the zombie savings 
from the Abbott government’s first budget in an effort to flush out the 
government, which is now carrying savings that it will not be able to pass in 
all likelihood.

Labor’s been big target for the whole election cycle. It remains big target.

Net position: take your pick +$8.9bn or -$3.4bn

Now, to the net budget position. What the net position is depends on whether 
you include the bunch of savings and revenue measures we already knew about, 
like negative gearing and CGT and abolishing the emissions reduction fund and 
so forth. If you include previously announced commitments and today’s material 
you get the figureChris Bowen cited earlier on, over the forward estimates, an 
improvement of $8.9 bn.

But if you take those things out (assuming we knew about them already) then 
the net budget impact of the measures we learned about today is -$3.4bn over 
the forward estimates.

Labor obviously wants to take the $8.9bn figure, which isn’t an outrage by any 
means, they are entitled to count their own savings and revenue measures of 
course, but the impact oftoday (in isolation) is negative, not positive. Why? 
Because Labor continues to oppose the bulk of the Coalition’s savings measures 
from that first budget, and theyhave now accounted for the impact of that 
decision in their own budget numbers.

The purpose of doing this, of coming clean as it were, is so they can now turn 
the attack back on theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> for including measures 
in their budget numbers which have absolutely no prospect of passing the Senate 
(unless this election brings in a new bunch of parliamentarians with a 
different attitude to Labor, the Greens andNick Xenophon.)

In the process of trying to get facts I missed the Q&A from the press 
conference but I don’t think we missed much in a news sense. I’ll check once 
I’ve got to the bottom of what the net budget position is. It’s actually quite 
difficult to discern.

Zombie measures Labor will support

Again, from labor’s campaign materials, Labor has picked up this batch of 
“zombie” savings measures from the first Abbott budget.

R&D Tax <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tax-australia> Incentive – 
reducing the rates of tax offsets

 * The government’s measure would reduce the rates of the refundable and 
non-refundable tax offsets available under the R&D Tax Incentive for the first 
$100m of eligible expenditure by 1.55%. This means the refundable rate would 
drop from 45% to 43.5% and the non-refundable rate would drop from 40% to 38.5%.

 * This measure has a budget improvement of $860 m over the forward estimates, 
and $2.8bn over the medium term.

Expanding opportunity – Higher Education Indexation – revised arrangements

 * Funding for programs under the Australian Research Council Act and the 
Higher Education Support Act, excluding superannuation grants, will be indexed 
to the Consumer Price Index in place of the Higher Education Grants Index.

 * This measure has a budget improvement of $119m over the forward estimates, 
and $3.7bn over the medium term.

A sustainable Higher Education Loan Program – repayment thresholds and 
indexation measure

 * This measure would set a new minimum threshold for repayment of HELP debts, 
set at 90% of the minimum threshold that would otherwise have applied in 
2016-17, being $50,638. A new repayment rate of 2% will apply to debtors with 
incomes above the new minimum threshold. The current minimum threshold is 
$54,126.

 * This measure has a budget improvement of $9m over the forward estimates, 
and $129m over the medium term.

Education Loan Program – HECS–HELP benefit – cessation

 * This measure would end the HECS-HELP benefit which currently applies to 
those studying early childhood education and maths, science, education or 
nursing. The benefit is used to either reduce the amount of compulsory HELP 
repayment through income tax, or the accumulated HELP debt directly.Labor has 
already announced our plan to fund 100,000 scholarships over five years to 
encourage more Australian students to undertake STEM degrees. We will also 
examine alternative ways to incentivise study in areas of workforce demand, 
like nursing and early childhood. 
 * This measure has a budget improvement of $24m over the forward estimates, 
and $159m over the medium term.

Family payments

The end result of today is most of the government’s family benefits changes 
proposed in the first budget will be opposed. But will Labor will impose more 
means testing. These are the developments today in the event the first run 
report (minus materials) wasn’t clear.

 * Labor will not proceed with the new baby bonus and $5 weekly increase to 
Family Tax Benefit A.

 * Labor will reduce the FTB-A supplement by 50% for families with incomes 
greater than $100,000.

 * Labor will continue the existing threshold freezes out to 2019-20.

close  
The campaigns have gone to bed (well not really, let’s say the public face of 
the campaigns in any case) so let’s part ways for now, and prepare for a brief 
moment of weekend zen.

But first, let’s take stock of the day.

 * Labor bookended a week of focus on the economy and costings with the 
release of new savings measures, which include more means testing for family 
payments, restrictions on private health insurance rebates and savings across a 
range of portfolios. Labor has also grabbed some of the Abbott government’s 
savings measures from the 2014 budget, namely a cut to R&D concessions and 
three university measures – and is now trying to turn pressure on the 
government for carrying forward more than $5bn worth of “zombies” savings that 
will never pass the senate unless the Senate becomes occupied by a new bunch of 
people.

 * The Coalition had a quieter day. Malcolm Turnbull gave his stump speech to 
the Menzies Research Centre and used the opportunity to launch a plea for 
voters to back the government in both houses if they wanted to avoid a hung 
parliament. Resist the temptation of a protest vote, the prime minister said, 
otherwise .. chaos.

 * Round the country, ballot orders were sorted, and independent Rob Oakeshott 
announced a comeback to politics in the seat of Cowper.

 * That was the guts of Friday. Thanks so much for hanging in today and over 
the course of the week. I’ll be back next week. A reminder that thefirst of our 
live election events kicks off in Sydney, next week, we’d love it if you’d join 
us. In Sydney,Lenore Taylor and I will be joined by Tanya Plibersek, deputy 
leader of the opposition and shadow minister for foreign affairs and 
international development,Trent Zimmerman, the Liberal MP for North Sydney (Joe 
Hockey’s successor) andCassandra Goldie, chief executive of Australian Council 
of Social Service. We’ll be talking about fairness, a key election theme. I 
suspectMike Bowers might stop by, and if you would like to as well, you can 
find the details here.

The thing that needs to be mentioned about Labor and cuts that I haven’t yet 
mentioned is today is not the end of the matter. There are more cuts to come. I 
suspect we’ll see more into next week as Labor steams through to the official 
campaign launch, which will likely see the unveiling of another big spending 
policy.
 
Now, just in time for your Friday commute home, here is the latest episode of 
our campaign podcast, Australian Politics Live. This weekGabrielle Chan joins 
me as we go bush to examine the political contest west of the divide, and we 
are joined by Labor’sMike Kelly, an MP attempting to win back a regional and 
marginal seat on July 2. What’s it like to try and win a regional seat that 
swings with the prevailing government? Tune in to find out.

For the purposes of illustration, we can compare the impact of the Labor cuts 
with the government’s cuts that are still built into the budget. Given the 
government says it is seeking a mandate for its savings measures let’s remind 
people what they are.

 * The Family Tax Benefit A end of year supplement of $726 per child is paid 
to around 1.5m families. That will cease.

 * Family Tax Benefit B end of year supplements worth $354 per family goes to 
around 1.3m families. That will cease.

 * Reducing Family Tax Benefit B for single parents whose youngest child is 
over 13 translates to a cut of around $1,700 a year.
 
I’ve been chasing particulars on who is impacted by Labor’s announcements on 
family tax benefit.

 * The measure reducing Family Tax benefit A end of year supplements by 50% 
for families earning over 100,000will impact 137,000 families. These families 
will lose $366 per child per year.

 * Labor continuing the current freeze on the top income limits for family tax 
benefits means families on more than around $94,000 a year will receive a 
reduced payment if their income increases over time.
 
Now we are passed the treasurer, some comments from the Greens leader Richard 
Di Natale.

We are hearing a lot about zombie measures in the budget, well today the Labor 
party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> are resurrecting 
the zombie of Tony Abbott by refusing to join with the Greens and the community 
in saying no to harsh cuts for students, families and research. Four billion 
has been slashed from higher education funding, leaving Australians that want 
to access higher education through the HECS-HELP benefit scheme without 
support. The $5.5bn of savings announced today pale in comparison to the $13bn 
of savings measures the Greens have identified that could be achieved by 
phasing out the private health insurance rebate to be reinvested into our 
public health system.

The Greens believe that we should be raising revenue and investing in the 
foundations of a decent society. We are disappointed that Labor has sided with 
big business and theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> when it comes to 
standing up for everyday people. While the old parties are cutting away parts 
of our family payments system, the Greens have announced policies that would 
see a real funding increase in income support, including for the most 
vulnerable in our society.
 
Q: With respect to the spending side of things, in respect to savings, were 
there any new measures that the government can support, including cutting the 
health rebate to natural therapies?

Scott Morrison:

Our measures are set out in our budget and we stand by that.
 
Scott Morrison:

I mean, it is really embarrassing what we saw here today. These numbers don’t 
add up. At the end of the dayBill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> keeps digging a hole 
on his spending, and the hole gets deeper and deeper. And what they announced 
today doesn’t cover it, it doesn’t come close to covering it, and so the 
Australian people, I think, are faced with a very straightforward choice.. They 
can vote for Labor and vote for higher deficits and higher debt, or they are 
support the government’s economic plan which will keep us on that positive 
trajectory towards a budget balance by 2021 based on the current assumptions 
around the parameters.

What we saw today frankly was embarrassing.
 
The treasurer is opening his rebuttal with bluff and bluster. Labor’s bluff 
and bluster. But thus far he’s pretty heavy on the bluff and bluster himself. 
He gets to some numbers eventually.

Scott Morrison:

They have gone from a cumulative figure of $16.3bn in improvements to $16.9bn 
in improvements, from the additional savings measures they have outlined today.

(Have they? Not sure where that comes from.)

They have announced a net improvement on their previous position of just 
$2.4bn. Now, that’s before they have even spent a cent, even spent a cent.

(I honestly have no idea where the treasurer is getting these numbers from.)
 
Before that, I should pull my head out of the calculator and the campaign fact 
sheet to give you the top line political perspective and consumer perspective: 
Labor has announced cuts to family tax benefits and health insurance benefits 
and some higher education things in order to send a signal to voters on budget 
management. Additionally it has clarified its position on the zombie savings 
from the Abbott government’s first budget in an effort to flush out the 
government, which is now carrying savings that it will not be able to pass in 
all likelihood.

Labor’s been big target for the whole election cycle. It remains big target. 

 
We were going to have both the prime minister and the treasurer rebutting 
Labor savings.Malcolm Turnbull will now not be appearing. Scott Morrison, 
shortly.

Now, to the net budget position. What the net position is depends on whether 
you include the bunch of savings and revenue measures we already knew about, 
like negative gearing and CGT and abolishing the emissions reduction fund and 
so forth. If you include previously announced commitments and today’s material 
you get the figureChris Bowen cited earlier on, over the forward estimates, an 
improvement of $8.9 bn.

But if you take those things out (assuming we knew about them already) then 
the net budget impact of the measures we learned about today is -$3.4bn over 
the forward estimates.

Labor obviously wants to take the $8.9bn figure, which isn’t an outrage by any 
means, they are entitled to count their own savings and revenue measures of 
course, but the impact oftoday (in isolation) is negative, not positive. Why? 
Because Labor continues to oppose the bulk of the Coalition’s savings measures 
from that first budget, and theyhave now accounted for the impact of that 
decision in their own budget numbers.

The purpose of doing this, of coming clean as it were, is so they can now turn 
the attack back on theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> for including measures 
in their budget numbers which have absolutely no prospect of passing the Senate 
(unless this election brings in a new bunch of parliamentarians with a 
different attitude to Labor, the Greens andNick Xenophon.)
 
In the process of trying to get facts I missed the Q&A from the press 
conference but I don’t think we missed much in a news sense. I’ll check once 
I’ve got to the bottom of what the net budget position is. It’s actually quite 
difficult to discern.
 
Again, from labor’s campaign materials, Labor has picked up this batch of 
“zombie” savings measures from the first Abbott budget.

R&D Tax <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tax-australia> Incentive – 
reducing the rates of tax offsets

 * The government’s measure would reduce the rates of the refundable and 
non-refundable tax offsets available under the R&D Tax Incentive for the first 
$100m of eligible expenditure by 1.55%. This means the refundable rate would 
drop from 45% to 43.5% and the non-refundable rate would drop from 40% to 38.5%.

 * This measure has a budget improvement of $860 m over the forward estimates, 
and $2.8bn over the medium term.

Expanding opportunity – Higher Education Indexation – revised arrangements

 * Funding for programs under the Australian Research Council Act and the 
Higher Education Support Act, excluding superannuation grants, will be indexed 
to the Consumer Price Index in place of the Higher Education Grants Index.

 * This measure has a budget improvement of $119m over the forward estimates, 
and $3.7bn over the medium term.

A sustainable Higher Education Loan Program – repayment thresholds and 
indexation measure

 * This measure would set a new minimum threshold for repayment of HELP debts, 
set at 90% of the minimum threshold that would otherwise have applied in 
2016-17, being $50,638. A new repayment rate of 2% will apply to debtors with 
incomes above the new minimum threshold. The current minimum threshold is 
$54,126.

 * This measure has a budget improvement of $9m over the forward estimates, 
and $129m over the medium term.

Education Loan Program – HECS–HELP benefit – cessation

 * This measure would end the HECS-HELP benefit which currently applies to 
those studying early childhood education and maths, science, education or 
nursing. The benefit is used to either reduce the amount of compulsory HELP 
repayment through income tax, or the accumulated HELP debt directly.Labor has 
already announced our plan to fund 100,000 scholarships over five years to 
encourage more Australian students to undertake STEM degrees. We will also 
examine alternative ways to incentivise study in areas of workforce demand, 
like nursing and early childhood. 
 * This measure has a budget improvement of $24m over the forward estimates, 
and $159m over the medium term.
 
The end result of today is most of the government’s family benefits changes 
proposed in the first budget will be opposed. But will Labor will impose more 
means testing. These are the developments today in the event the first run 
report (minus materials) wasn’t clear.

 * Labor will not proceed with the new baby bonus and $5 weekly increase to 
Family Tax Benefit A.

 * Labor will reduce the FTB-A supplement by 50% for families with incomes 
greater than $100,000.

 * Labor will continue the existing threshold freezes out to 2019-20.
