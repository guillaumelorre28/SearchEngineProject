As a new version of the exhibition David Bowie Is  
<http://www.ago.net/david-bowie-is/>opens this week at the Art Gallery of 
Ontario, curators have revealed a list of his top 100 must-read books, giving a 
fascinating insight into the mind of the influential musician and style icon.

The show, which offered unprecedented access to Bowie's own archive, became 
the most popular ever mounted by London's V&A when it ran there earlier this 
year.

As the Guardian's Alexis Petridis pointed out at the time, the Bowie story is 
so well-known that "unless it's content to retell a very hackneyed story indeed,
David Bowie <https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie> Is has to find a way 
of casting new light on some of the most over-analysed and discussed music in 
rock history."

The reading list, with books presented in chronological order rather than 
order of preference, provides Ontario with a new angle. American classics of 
the 50s and 60s are strongly represented – On the Road by Jack Kerouac, Truman 
Capote's In Cold Blood – as are tales of working-class boys made good, which 
emerged in the postwar years:Keith Waterhouse's Billy Liar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780141041735/billy-liar> 
andRoom at the Top by John Braine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099445364/room-at-the-top>
, andThe Outsider by Colin Wilson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780753814321/the-outsider>
, a study of creativity and the mindset of misfits.RD Laing's The Divided Self 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780422705400/divided-self>
 speaks to a fascination with psychotherapy and creativity, as doesThe Origin 
of Consciousness in the breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, by Julian Jaynes. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780140174915/the-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind>
 There is no evidence that Bowie's scientific inquries extend beyond psychology 
– Stephen Hawking's cosmic theories are out – but his tastes are otherwise 
broad.

Political history features, in titles such as Christopher Hitchens' The Trial 
of Henry Kissinger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9780857898357/the-trial-of-henry-kissinger>
, and Orlando Figes'A People's Tragedy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9780712673273/a-peoples-tragedy-the-russian-revolution>
, as well as collections of interviews.

A broad taste for fiction emerges, too, from early Ian McEwan (In Between the 
Sheets <http://www.ianmcewan.com/bib/books/sheets.html>) and Martin Amis's 
definitive 1980s novel,Money 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/may/15/martin-amis-money-tv-series>, 
to 21st-century fictions such as Sarah Waters' Fingersmith andOscar Wao 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview20>
 by Junot Diaz.

He also displays a penchant for irreverent humour, with the inclusion of Spike 
Milligan's comic novelPuckoon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780140023749/puckoon>, 
and the entire oeuvres ofViz <http://www.viz.com/> and Private Eye 
<http://www.private-eye.co.uk/>. 

And, of course, there's music – with soul music especially prominent. Bowie 
selectsSweet Soul Music: Rhythm and Blues and the Southern Dream 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/music/9781841952406/sweet-soul-music-rhythm-and-blues-and-the-southern-dream-of-freedom>
 of Freedom by Peter Guralnick,and Nowhere to Run: The Story of Soul Music 
<http://www.djhistory.com/books/nowhere-to-run-the-story-of-soul-music-gerri-hirshey-1994>
 by Gerri Hirshey, as well as Charlie Gillett's The Sound of the City: The Rise 
of Rock and Roll.
