The very last moments before its petals begin to drop are when a rose is at 
its most beautiful. This was the idea at the core of Sarah Burton’s latest
Alexander McQueen <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexander-mcqueen> 
collection, staged at the Conciergerie in Paris, the vaulted dungeon where 
Marie Antoinette was held before being taken to the guillotine.

“I started by looking at women and the female form and the rose, and the idea 
that something can be so beautiful as it is on the verge of decay,” said Burton 
after Tuesday’s show.

The collection began with models belted firmly into textured coats worn over 
dresses and boots, each outfit coloured head-to-toe in the exact same shade of 
blush pink or blood red, garments layered like petals.

“And then she peels away, the way a rose peels away,” as Burton put it, so 
that the next wave of models wore leather dresses, with knife-sharp pleated 
skirts and heavily boned, but skimpily cut, bodices. From there, the petals 
became three-dimensional, outsize organza rosettes quivering on cocktail 
dresses.

This is a delicate moment for Sarah Burton to navigate. The brand’s big show 
taking place this week is not this one, but Savage Beauty, the V&A’s Alexander 
McQueen retrospective, which opens in three days’ time.

Her task at this moment is to balance respect for the retrospective with a 
firm hand on the tiller guiding the label into the future. The beauty of a 
fading flower was a fittingly melancholic nod to love and loss, but Burton made 
it not just about any flower but about the rose, symbol of femininity. It 
brought the story full circle: not just about her predecessor but about herself 
and about the more feminine mood she has ushered in as the queen of McQueen.

Thirteen years ago, Alexander McQueen staged a show in this venue. Then, the 
milkmaid necklines, oversized hoods and powdered beauties holding wolves on 
chains brought to life the building’s French Revolution past.

Burton’s show was more Victorian than 18th century, and more British than 
French. Fuzzy Miss Havisham hair and nineteenth-century tailoring – both, as 
Burton described, “very of-the-house” – leant the feel of an eerie attic rather 
than a nightmarish dungeon. And the rose is of course the ultimate English 
flower – although the pleated leather skirts, with their confusing 
masculine/feminine dynamic, called to mind a kilt, which in turn calls 
Alexander McQueen’s Highland Rape-era Scottish references into play.

After the show, Burton was keen to show reporters a knitted dress with 
scissor-edged pleats. In the shadowy recesses of each pleat, the knit was 
delicately and deliberately laddered, giving a volume and sheerness to the 
fabric which enhanced its beauty even while destroying it.

At that moment, Burton was almost knocked to the ground by a waiter who in the 
backstage hustle dropped a tray of champagne glasses. “There is beauty in 
imperfection,” she laughed.
