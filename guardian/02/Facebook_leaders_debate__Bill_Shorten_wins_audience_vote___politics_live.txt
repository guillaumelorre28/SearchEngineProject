before rolling into the final fortnight. And don’t forget the live event in 
Melbourne next Tuesday night, would be great tosee you there at the Malthouse

Mr Consensus is awake, and wants a fight: my quick verdict

The first quick take was that was a good debate. The second is in every forum, 
the questions from voters indicate Labor is much more on the zeitgeist than the 
Coalition when it comes to the policy concerns of voters. That has been 
entirely consistent throughout the campaign. Labor’s agenda is the one that is 
resonant at this moment in Australia’s history.

But the field evidence also shows us that the polls have hardly moved over the 
past several weeks. People are not giving Labor an affirmative bounce for being 
in touch.

Which brings me to the main take out of tonight. We saw it this morning. We 
saw it again tonight.Bill Shorten has taken a decision to try and punch it up 
as we head into the final fortnight. He’s leaning in to the prime minister, and 
starting to demand a contest, a fight, a clash of values.

The government’s objective is to keep this campaign as flat as possible, as 
tamped down, as reassuring, as dull as possible. The Coalition wants torpor not 
confrontation, because torpor guarantees a Coalition victory. Labor is 
evidently positioning to fight in the home stretch, which is interesting, 
because it’s against the grain for Shorten, who like consensus and commonality, 
not confrontation – it’s not his cadence.

But in my view, fight is the only chance Labor has of getting the contest by 
the throat. Judging by the Labor leader’s performance tonight, that’s what he 
thinks too. It was a feisty performance from Shorten, a few left hooks, a 
couple of risks, some high visibility contrast with his opponent, some 
assertive negativity.

But the prime minister didn’t stumble, didn’t take any wrong turns, he just 
followed the battle plan: keep it tight and tidy, stick with the messages, be 
reassuring, and all will be well on polling day.

Let’s see how that all goes.

Bill Shorten crams in as much as possible.

I want to save Medicare. I want to make sure that every school is a great 
school properly resourced so kids get the best start in life. I want to make 
sure that working parents, especially working mums get relief from the cost of 
childcare. I want to make sure that our TAFE sector is revitalised. I want to 
lead a country which makes steel products and has a steel industry as well as a 
ship and sub-building industry I want to make sure we have innovations for 
infrastructure, public transport in our big cities to help improve productivity 
and relieve congestion, a national broadband network so that small businesses 
can compete in our region, I want to make sure people go to work and are paid 
properly including penalty rates and shift allowances. I want to make sure that 
in this country we generate sustainable jobs for the future, but on the basis 
of rigid budget discipline, and making sure we have a highly skilled workforce 
and making sure we have jobs for the future and we will do not by not having a 
corporate tax cut and by the way, vote for us, we will have a banking royal 
commission.

Summations now in response to a question about vision. The prime minister 
delivers the stump speech, with this added burst of enthusiasm, or over reach, 
depending on your level of tolerance on a Friday night.

Malcolm Turnbull:

What I’m doing is enabling the dreams of every Australian.

Question ten is on parliamentary perks, pensions and the like.

Malcolm Turnbull says an independent tribunal governs the system and the 
alternative is politicians police themselves. He says he’s the worst person to 
ask about entitlements because he didn’t come into politics to make more money.

Bill Shorten echoes the sentiment on the tribunal, but he inflects his point. 
He doesn’tunderstand why the Liberal party keeps freezing increases to everyone 
else’s superannuation.

I’m committed to lifting the superannuation, but I’m the Labor guy and I want 
to see people do better.

been terrific. Mr Bowers and I will be back with you for another special 
edition of Politics Live on Sunday for Labor’s campaign launch from Penrith 
before rolling into the final fortnight. And don’t forget the live event in 
Melbourne next Tuesday night, would be great tosee you there at the Malthouse

The first quick take was that was a good debate. The second is in every forum, 
the questions from voters indicate Labor is much more on the zeitgeist than the 
Coalition when it comes to the policy concerns of voters. That has been 
entirely consistent throughout the campaign. Labor’s agenda is the one that is 
resonant at this moment in Australia’s history.

But the field evidence also shows us that the polls have hardly moved over the 
past several weeks. People are not giving Labor an affirmative bounce for being 
in touch.

Which brings me to the main take out of tonight. We saw it this morning. We 
saw it again tonight.Bill Shorten has taken a decision to try and punch it up 
as we head into the final fortnight. He’s leaning in to the prime minister, and 
starting to demand a contest, a fight, a clash of values.

The government’s objective is to keep this campaign as flat as possible, as 
tamped down, as reassuring, as dull as possible. The Coalition wants torpor not 
confrontation, because torpor guarantees a Coalition victory. Labor is 
evidently positioning to fight in the home stretch, which is interesting, 
because it’s against the grain for Shorten, who like consensus and commonality, 
not confrontation – it’s not his cadence.

But in my view, fight is the only chance Labor has of getting the contest by 
the throat. Judging by the Labor leader’s performance tonight, that’s what he 
thinks too. It was a feisty performance from Shorten, a few left hooks, a 
couple of risks, some high visibility contrast with his opponent, some 
assertive negativity.

But the prime minister didn’t stumble, didn’t take any wrong turns, he just 
followed the battle plan: keep it tight and tidy, stick with the messages, be 
reassuring, and all will be well on polling day.

Let’s see how that all goes.
 
Mike Bowers: all kinds of fabulous coming out of that room.

Now they are over and out.

I’ll share some pictures and some thoughts very shortly.
 
Bill Shorten crams in as much as possible.

I want to save Medicare. I want to make sure that every school is a great 
school properly resourced so kids get the best start in life. I want to make 
sure that working parents, especially working mums get relief from the cost of 
childcare. I want to make sure that our TAFE sector is revitalised. I want to 
lead a country which makes steel products and has a steel industry as well as a 
ship and sub-building industry I want to make sure we have innovations for 
infrastructure, public transport in our big cities to help improve productivity 
and relieve congestion, a national broadband network so that small businesses 
can compete in our region, I want to make sure people go to work and are paid 
properly including penalty rates and shift allowances. I want to make sure that 
in this country we generate sustainable jobs for the future, but on the basis 
of rigid budget discipline, and making sure we have a highly skilled workforce 
and making sure we have jobs for the future and we will do not by not having a 
corporate tax cut and by the way, vote for us, we will have a banking royal 
commission.
 
Summations now in response to a question about vision. The prime minister 
delivers the stump speech, with this added burst of enthusiasm, or over reach, 
depending on your level of tolerance on a Friday night.

Malcolm Turnbull:

What I’m doing is enabling the dreams of every Australian.
 
Question ten is on parliamentary perks, pensions and the like.

Malcolm Turnbull says an independent tribunal governs the system and the 
alternative is politicians police themselves. He says he’s the worst person to 
ask about entitlements because he didn’t come into politics to make more money.

Bill Shorten echoes the sentiment on the tribunal, but he inflects his point. 
He doesn’tunderstand why the Liberal party keeps freezing increases to everyone 
else’s superannuation.

I’m committed to lifting the superannuation, but I’m the Labor guy and I want 
to see people do better.
