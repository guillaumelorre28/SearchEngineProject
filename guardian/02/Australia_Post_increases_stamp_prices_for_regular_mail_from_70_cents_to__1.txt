Sending a letter within Australia is now slower and more expensive. Australia 
Post <https://www.theguardian.com/business/australia-post> has increased the 
cost of stamps for sending regular letters within the country from 70 cents to 
$1 – a rise of nearly 43%.

The change to the

 “Basic Postage Rate”, effective on Monday, comes with the introduction of 
three delivery speeds for sending letters within Australia: express post, 
priority and regular.

The regular service is now slower by up to two business days. A letter could 
take as many as six business days to arrive at its destination.

The new priority service is up to two days faster, with an estimated delivery 
time of between one and four days – but costs an extra 50 cents for a priority 
label.

Express Post remains the fastest service, with “guaranteed next-business-day 
delivery*” – to approximately 80% of Australian addresses, as part of its 
network operating “between all capital cities (except Darwin and in Perth CBD 
only) and some major centres”.

In an explanatory video posted on YouTube, Australia Post says the changes are 
designed to give consumers “more choice over the speed at which you send 
letters”.

Almost-instantaneous delivery of correspondence of any size, to any 
destination, is not being offered by the postal service.

Concession card holders can continue to buy regular stamps for 60 cents; the 
priority service will cost them $1.10.

The price of seasonal greeting stamps remains unchanged.

The increases were expected after Australia Post recorded an annual after-tax 
loss of $222m in late September – its first loss in 30 years – that group CEO 
Ahmed Fahoursaid reflected 
<http://www.smh.com.au/business/australia-post-posts-222m-loss-letter-posting-in-terminal-decline-20150925-gjup78.html>
 “terminal and structural decline” in the sending of letters.

Australia Post signalled its intention to increase stamp prices at the time, 
but first had to secure the approval of the Australian Competition and Consumer 
Commission. The government granted it regulatory approval to introduce 
different speeds of service.

Fahour has not commented on the change to services on Twitter, although he had 
posted on the site on Sunday.

Unusually for the forum, there were no cries of outrage expressed on Twitter 
over the price increases, but theywere discussed 
<https://conversation.auspost.com.au/national/forum_topics/when-the-new-mail-services-start-in-january-2016-will-you-use-regular-or-priority-service-and-why>
 with some bitterness on Australia Post’s “National Conservation” forum.

User “Jodiandbrett” said all services bar regular were now “expensive” and 
“unaffordable”.

“My goodness. I really feel helpless here, does giving my opinion actually 
make a difference or is it just a place Australia Post have put here for people 
to ‘feel’ like they can voice their opinions? ... Thank you for letting me 
vent, as I am sure that’s all this will be good for.”

User “Danny” compared the introduction of the priority label to the pink 
sticker service offered “back in the 1990s”.

In response, user “Rubblesby” said Fahour “should be sacked”. “He took what 
was once a proud Australian institution that people loved and trusted and 
turned it into a self serving honey pot”.
