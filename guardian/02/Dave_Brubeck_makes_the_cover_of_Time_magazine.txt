On 8 November 1954, pianist and composer Dave Brubeck 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/dave-brubeck> became only the second jazz 
musician (after Louis Armstrong) to make the cover of the revered Time 
magazine, despite the music having flourished for nearly four decades. Brubeck 
would soon create one of jazz's biggest hits with the catchy Take Five, but his 
quartet was already a big draw on the college circuit for an innovative style 
using bebop, and featuring a quietly dazzling saxophone improviser in Paul 
Desmond.
