West Lothian council has launched a free app that provides news, events, 
alerts and information on council services for residents.

The app, which is for iPhones, iPads and iPods and can be downloaded from 
Apple's App Store. It also includes addresses, contact details and opening 
times for council services. Residents will also be able contact the council via 
email using the app. West Lothian said it is one of the first council's in the 
country to launch its own app specifically for Apple devices.

Graham Hope, chief executive of West Lothian, said: "We have taken the first 
step by developing the App for Apple devices as almost three times as many 
people are using iPhones, iPads or iPods than other devices to access our 
website.

"This new service is the latest online development and follows the 
introduction of social media websites Facebook, Twitter, You Tube and Flickr 
which have proved to be very popular, and the new eNews Service which provides 
regular council information and alerts. It is our intention to continue to 
develop this service in the future."
