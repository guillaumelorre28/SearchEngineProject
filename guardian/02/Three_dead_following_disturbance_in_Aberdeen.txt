Three people have died following a disturbance in Aberdeen.


Police were called to a flat in a 19-storey high rise called Donside Court, in 
the Tillydrone area of the city, at about 8.15pm on Tuesday evening.

Det Supt Dave McLaren, from Police Scotland’s major investigation team, said: 
“As a result of this incident three persons are now known to have died.

“At this time the investigation is in its very early stages, however the 
circumstances as they present at this time would indicate that this is a 
contained incident and we are not looking for any other person in relation to 
the deaths.

“Further information will be released in due course.”

Police Scotland confirmed they are investigating reports that someone had 
fallen from the building.

Pictures from the scene show forensics officers surrounding the high rise, and 
a blue forensic tent close to the main entrance to the building.

Police have dismissed reports on social media that a police officer had been 
physically injured.
