Ayaan Hirsi Ali <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayaan-hirsi-ali>, the 
Somali-born Dutch activist facing death threats for her outspoken criticism of 
Islam, is to come under national police protection anywhere in the European 
Union, the top justice official in Brussels said last night.

Franco Frattini, the European commissioner for justice and home affairs, said 
that Hirsi Ali and any other persons facing threats to their lives because of 
their opinions or writings, would be guaranteed protection wherever they went 
in Europe and that the host country would bear the expense.

The issue was discussed at a lunch of all 27 interior ministers of the EU in 
Brussels yesterday after being raised by the Dutch. Frattini said the ministers 
agreed and that the pact would be effective immediately based on "unanimous 
consensus".

Hirsi Ali has demanded that the EU pay for her protection when living in the 
US. Her colleague, Theo Van Gogh, was murdered in Amsterdam in 2004 after he 
and Hirsi Ali made a film attacking Islamic treatment of women.
