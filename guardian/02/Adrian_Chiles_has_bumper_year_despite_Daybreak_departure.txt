Adrian Chiles's finances have flourished despite being ditched from ITV1's 
Daybreak <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/daybreak>, with the 
presenter netting more than £2.5m from his private company last year.

Chiles, who along with Christine Bleakley was ousted from Daybreak late last 
year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/25/adrian-chiles-christine-bleakley-daybreak>
, reported profits at his company Basic Broadcasting of £2.58m for the year to 
the end of January 2012.

Basic Broadcasting, which is used to channel Chiles's earnings, had a bumper 
year despite the loss of his reported £6m deal to front Daybreak.

Profits climbed more than 80% year on year from the £1.4m reported in 2011, 
according to documents filed at Companies House and made publicly available on 
Wednesday.

Chiles, who bought out his ex-wife Jane Garvey's share in the company for 
£335,000 in 2009 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2011/feb/10/adrian-chiles-jane-garvey?INTCMP=SRCH>
, is listed as the only director of Basic Broadcasting.

The filing shows that Chiles took a loan of £542,246 from the company last 
year, repaying £397,045 by the end of Basic Broadcasting's filing period of 31 
January.

Since leaving Daybreak Chiles's main work for ITV has been anchoring the 
broadcaster's football coverage

 including Euro 2012, the FA Cup and Champions League, and his satirical 
programme That Sunday Night Show.
