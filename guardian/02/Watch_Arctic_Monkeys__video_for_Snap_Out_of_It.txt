It might not be the best day for an independent artist to unveil their new 
video viaYouTube 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/17/youtube-indie-labels-music-subscription>
, but the Arctic Monkeys have posted their latest single taken from their No 1 
album, AM.

Snap Out Of It was directed by Focus Creeps <http://www.focuscreeps.com/>, 
who've previously worked with artists as eclectic as KD Lang, Girls, King Krule 
and Trash Talk – and features Stephanie Sigman –star of Miss Bala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/27/miss-bala-review>, a film about a 
young woman whose only path away from poverty is the local beauty contest.


Arctic Monkeys recent videos have included drug addled imaginings of 
ex-girlfriends incompromising situations 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6366dxFf-Os>, and sleazy, smoky club scenarios 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj8r3qmOoZ8#t=125>, but Snap Out Of It 
portrays a far more visceral picture – the insanity of a broken heart.


Sigman is filmed staring into nothingness, cooking meat, frantically replaying 
grainy footage of the band in rehearsal and sobbing excessively while dressed 
in the official uniform of the mournful ex-girlfriend: a big bra.
