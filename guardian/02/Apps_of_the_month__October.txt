FIFA 16 ULTIMATE TEAM <https://www.easports.com/uk/fifa/ultimate-team/features>

Android/iOS

The latest mobile FIFA game focuses solely on its ultimate team mode, where 
you build a squad by earning and buying virtual “packs” of players. An acquired 
taste, but the match action is pretty good: with excellent graphics and 
un-fiddly controls.

SPL-T <https://itunes.apple.com/app/spl-t/id1021971213?mt=8>

iOS

SPL-T is a puzzle game that looks simple: you tap the screen to create lines 
dividing up the space. But it’s one of the most absorbing mobile puzzlers in 
recent memory, giving your grey cells a thorough workout as you figure out its 
strategy.

future updates .

THE DEER GOD <http://store.steampowered.com/app/328940/>

Android/iOS

A beautiful pixel-art adventure with a unique pitch: “Live as a deer. Survive 
as a deer.” Note, the latter is very hard: the game’s difficulty level isn’t 
for the faint-hearted. A few bugs have niggled early players, but they’re being 
fixed.
