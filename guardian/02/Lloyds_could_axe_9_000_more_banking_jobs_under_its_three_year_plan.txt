Fears that Lloyds Banking Group is preparing to announce up to 9,000 job cuts 
– more than one in 10 of the workforce – swept the industry last night as
António Horta-Osório <https://www.theguardian.com/business/antonio-horta-osorio>
 put the finishing touches to a three-year plan for the bailed-out bank.

Some 45,000 roles have already been axed since Lloyds TSB rescued HBOS during 
the 2008 banking crisis – 30,000 were lost as a result of the deal and a further
15,000 earmarked by Horta-Osório 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/30/lloyds-boss-unrepentant-job-losses>
 after he took the helm in March 2011 as part of cost cuts.

Horta-Osório is expected to blame the latest round of cuts to the 
85,000-strong workforce on the move by customers towards using branches less 
and the internet more, meaning the bank has been forced to become more 
digitally focused.

Branches are also expected to be closed to respond to what bankers say is 
falling demand for high street outlets.

Lloyds, which is 24% owned by the taxpayer, would not comment on the scale of 
the job cuts, reported on Sky ahead of the announcement on Tuesday, when the 
bank will also publish its third quarter results.

Ged Nichols, general secretary of the Accord union said: “If this story is 
correct, it will create further anxiety for a workforce that has been reduced 
by around 40% already in a little over five years. The bank is supposed to be 
trying to rebuild trust and confidence with its customers and employees. This 
isn’t the way to do it.

“We are seeking urgent talks with Lloyds Banking Group about this issue. The 
loyal, hardworking and often low paid employees ofLloyds Banking Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group> deserve better.”

The board of the bank, originally bailed out with £20bn of government money, 
is expected to meet on Monday to ratify the new strategic direction drawn up 
Horta-Osório, when a final decision on the scale of the job reductions will be 
made.

That will come after the results of a health check of 100 banks across the EU 
– including the major UK banks – are published on Sunday by the EuropeanBanking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/banking> Authority, a move that could 
result in some banks being forced to raise more capital or sell off operations 
to preserve their capital cushions.

There were reports that one in 10 banks subjected to the stress tests could 
fail, prompting the European Central Bank to try to dampen speculation.

“Any inferences drawn as to the final outcome of the exercise would be highly 
speculative until the results are final on 26 October,” a spokesman for the ECB 
told Reuters.

All the UK’s major banks are due to publish their results for the third 
quarter in the next fortnight.

Barclays announced 19,000 job cuts in May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/08/barclays-to-cut-19000-jobs-scale-back-investment-bank-antony-jenkins>
 as a result of a scaling back of its investment banking division and has 
already blamed the need to automate services for job cuts in branches. After 
Antony Jenkins was first promoted to chief executive at Barclays he is said to 
have told investors that he could envisage a total of 40,000 fewer staff – 
taking the workforce to 100,000 – as a result of the impact of new technology.

The government has been selling down its stake in Lloyds – it stood at over 
40% after the bailout – buthas now ruled any further reductions before next 
year’s general election
