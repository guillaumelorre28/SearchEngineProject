Lest it pass us by after all the hullabaloo of recent months, it should be 
recorded thatIndependent News & Media's chief executive, Gavin O'Reilly, is on 
the verge of comprehensively defeating the troublesome shareholderDenis O'Brien.

O'Brien has been outmanoeuvred at every turn. While he has been waging a 
public battle against O'Reilly and his father,Tony O'Reilly, their strategy has 
been to negotiate with banks and bondholders in private.

Now O'Brien looks set to lose every vote at the series of emergency general 
meetings he demanded to discuss a series of proposals aimed at undermining 
O'Reilly's strategy to rescue INM from its financial difficulties.

At the first egm a week ago, O'Brien's bid to unseat two INM board members was 
defeated by the overwhelming majority of shareholders 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/nov/03/independent-news-media-chairman-vote>
.

Another egm is due on Friday, when shareholders are expected to reject 
O'Brien's proposals to restrict the company from issuing shares.

It may also vote on the disposal of INM Outdoor, the company's lucrative South 
African advertising business, which O'Brien originally opposed. But that matter 
may the subject of yet another separate egm.

There will be a further egm on 23 November to allow shareholders to vote on 
the company's restructuring plan.

O'Reilly, unlike O'Brien, remains committed to owning and publishing The 
Independent and Independent on Sunday. It would appear that O'Reilly has won 
that argument too.

Ireland's Sunday Business Post also reported 
<http://www.thepost.ie/story/eyojojmhey/> this weekend that INM's banks and 
bondholders have rejected O'Brien's various debt restructuring plans.

The paper further argues that O'Brien is running out of options to wrest 
control of INM. His only other options would appear to be some sort of 
unspecified legal action or buying more shares in the upcoming rights issue 
that is part of INM's restructuring plans.

He has a 26% stake at present, but this will be diluted under the proposed 
debt-for-equity swap deal negotiated by O'Reilly with bondholders.

Meanwhile, O'Brien has won few friends among the shareholders. In a second 
story, <http://www.thepost.ie/story/eyojeyeyql/> the Business Post reports that 
there was general disenchantment with O'Brien at last week's egm and, at one 
moment, "palpable tension in the room" at Dublin's Green Isle hotel.

One shareholder, Joe O'Keeffe, challenged O'Brien's board representatives, 
Lucy Gaffney and Paul Connolly, to say whether they agreed with a public 
statement by O'Brien in which he advised people not to invest in INM.

The two directors "resisted the pressure to comment" and also declined to 
speak to reporters after O'Brien's resolutions were voted down.
