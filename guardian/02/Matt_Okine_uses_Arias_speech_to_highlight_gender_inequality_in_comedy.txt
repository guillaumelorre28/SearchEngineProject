The Aria awards <https://www.theguardian.com/music/aria-awards> have come 
under fire for not including in its televised broadcast an acceptance speech by 
comedian Matt Okine in which he called out sexism in his industry.

Accepting the award for best comedy release – beating Bondi Hipsters, Buddy 
Goode, Ronny Chieng and Sammy J & Randy to the pointy statue – the Triple J 
presenter used his speech to highlight how there wasn’t a single woman 
nominated in the category.

“I didn’t feel great reading that list of people,” he told the audience at

Matt Okine wins best comedy & makes the point there wasn't a single woman 
nominated. It's 2015. Nervous silence from the power seats#ARIAs

Okine later told reporters backstage he felt “silly” about his speech but it 
was everyone’s duty to speak up about gender inequality.

“Now I feel silly and judged about it ... but I feel like, what am I supposed 
to do? Be passive about it? [Speaking up] is absolutely necessary.

“I think a lot of guys my age, you think you’re doing enough by not doing 
anything bad. I don’t hit women, I don’t discriminate.”

Okine said White Ribbon Day on 25 November, which is dedicated to raising 
awareness around domestic violence, had him wondering if he was doing enough. “[

 chains himself to a tree. What am I doing? I’ve got to start [doing 
something].”

Okine said if he didn’t get asked back to the Arias, “that’s fine”.


Some viewers tweeted their disappointment that Okine’s speech wasn’t included 
in Channel Ten’s nationwide broadcast of the music industry awards ceremony.

Disappointed at #ARIAs <https://twitter.com/hashtag/ARIAs?src=hash> for not 
playing@mattokine <https://twitter.com/mattokine> acceptance speech. How about 
embracing gender equality & maybe the industry can progress?

For the sake of brevity, the national broadcast of the Arias never includes 
all the awards presented in the show.
