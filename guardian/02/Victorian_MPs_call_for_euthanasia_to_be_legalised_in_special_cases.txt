Victoria <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria> should change 
its criminal laws to allow doctors to euthanase people, a parliamentary report 
has said.

A cross-party committee of MPs has recommended legalising assisted dying in 
limited circumstances.

The committee examined euthanasia laws in other countries and found they had 
robust regulations to protect against abuse.

“We found no evidence of institutional corrosion or the often-cited ‘slippery 
slope’,” a Liberal MP, Ed O’Donohue, said.

The committee’s report – tabled in parliament on Thursday – said adults with 
incurable and insufferable diseases should be allowed to request assistance to 
end their lives.

It suggested the Crimes Act be changed to allow euthanasia. The report also 
called for better palliative care and end-of-life treatment.

The premier, Daniel Andrews, whose father recently died from cancer, said he 
would consider the recommendations.

“Personal views are informed by personal experience, and I know that for me, 
and my family, we’ve been doing a lot of thinking about these issues,” he said.

The report said safeguards should be in place to protect vulnerable people and 
ensure they were not pressured or coerced into making a decision.
