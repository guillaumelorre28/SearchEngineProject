Subject: Re: Can you help me with my logic homework?

Of course I'm happy to help â€” they're really pushing you at Sidwell Friends, 
huh? But this one's pretty simple: it's just about the concept of logical 
opposites. Ifx is true, then not-x is false by definition. So to take a topical 
example, I'm opposed to attempts to outlaw same-sex marriage, but on the other 
hand, I'm opposed to making same-sex marriage legal, because . . . wait, that's 
weird. Now I think about it, that's not logical at all. Huh. Let me get back to 
you on this one, sweetie, OK?

The part I never understand is this: if you're going to blame some sinister 
organisation for surreptitiously creating a terrifying socialist world 
government through bike-sharing and farmers' markets . . . why pick the UN? 
Least efficient organisation in the history of the planet. If those guys tried 
to organise even one bike-sharing scheme, it'd take 20 years and several 
billion dollars just to agree on an acronym for the coordinating committee. As 
for authorising the purchase of a fleet of black helicopters? Never. Gonna. 
Happen.

It was a joke, and he was talking about my leftwing critics. What are you 
acting so worried about? Also, can we talk about the disgusting quantities of 
air freshener you seem to be spraying in the corridor right outside your office 
recently? I could barely breathe when I walked past this morning.

PS. Your plane KNOCKED OVER ANOTHER PLANE at the airport? Is your whole staff 
on drugs or something? Is that what you're worried about?
