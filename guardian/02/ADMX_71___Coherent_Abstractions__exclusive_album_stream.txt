ADMX-71 is the industrial alias of techno pioneer Adam Mitchell aka Adam X. 
Since the early 90s, Mitchell has been a key figure on the New York scene, 
opening the Sonic Groove Records store and throwing huge warehouse parties 
across the city.

Coherent Abtractions is Mitchellâ€™s third album as ADMX-71, an atmospheric trip 
that moves from the gently menacing throb of Virtuality Continuum to the airy 
explorations of MGM - 41 - 85.
