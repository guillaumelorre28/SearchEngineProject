Pussy willows are out, the small furry catkins of grey or goat willows, and a 
sure sign of spring. The grey-coloured catkins are now bursting with golden 
yellow pollen, but have probably come out too early for Palm Sunday, which 
falls on 13 April this year, when sprays of pussy willow are often used as 
"palms" for processions in churches.

Willows are much underrated. Growing in wet ground by rivers, canals and 
lakes, their tangle of roots helps to bind the soil and stops the ground 
slipping. But this winter was so wet that many willows suffered in the 
floodwaters, and a willow farm on the Somerset Levels was devastated after 
sinking under water.

Willows have also been used for weaving into baskets, wickerwork furniture and 
even coffins. And the wood of fast-growing willows is being used for biomass 
burning to generate electricity, for example at the Drax power station in 
Yorkshire.

We also owe a huge debt to willows for giving rise to the world's most widely 
used medicine. The ancient Egyptians and many other old civilisations used 
willow bark for rheumatism and headaches, and in 1763 Edward Stone, a vicar 
from Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, made the first scientific study of the 
effects of powdered willow bark when he treated patients suffering from 
rheumatic fever. The active ingredient was salicin, named after the Latin name 
for willow, Salix, and eventually led to the manufacture of acetyl salicylic 
acid, better known as aspirin.
