Another awards ceremony, another award for Atonement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/atonement>. The plush Ian McEwan adaptation 
was last night named best film at the Richard Attenborough film awards, a 
newly-named event that is voted for by UK regional journalists.

For good measure, Atonement also picked up prizes for best film-maker (Joe 
Wright), best actor (James McAvoy) and screenwriter (Christopher Hampton), 
further buttressing its status as one of the frontrunners for next month's 
Oscars. But in the latest snub to the film's star, Keira Knightley missed out 
on the actress award, which went to Cate Blanchett for Elizabeth: The Golden 
Age. Initially tipped as an Oscar favourite, Knightley failed to pick up an 
Academy Award nomination.

Sam Riley won the rising star award for his role in Control. The 28-year-old 
actor impressed the critics with his performance as Ian Curtis, the troubled 
frontman of the post-punk band Joy Division.

"The last year has shown the cinema to be both resilient and innovative," Lord 
Attenborough said in a statement. "It has also brought a superb crop of 
terrific films with compelling performances from both experienced and fresh 
talents."

Atonement has seven nominations for this year's Academy Awards, which take 
place on February 24. The Coen brothers' No Country For Old Men and Paul Thomas 
Anderson's There Will be Blood are tied in first place on eight nominations 
apiece.
