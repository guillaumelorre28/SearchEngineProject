Aquarius Platinum is missing out on the market rally after it announced it was 
suspending some of its operations in South Africa, due to the low prices 
currently commanded by the metal.

The company's shares are down 0.3p at 73.2p following the move, as well as its 
comments that trading conditions would remain difficult in the short to medium 
term. Aquarius and its partner Anglo Platinum are placing the Marikana 
operations on a care and maintenance basis, to preserve its ore reserves until 
the platinum price recovers and the site becomes economic once more. Analyst 
Dominic Okane at Liberum Capital said Marikana accounted for around 18% of the 
company's annual production, and its temporary closure would reduce 2013 
earnings estimates by around 13%. He said:
 Further closures are likely - specifically Everest which is around 30% higher 
cost.

But Panmure Gordon kept its buy rating on the company, saying the Marikana 
move was a sensible one. Analyst Alison Turner said:
 Marikana is uneconomic at current platinum group metal prices and as such we 
believe that mothballing that operation is a rational and prudent response to 
market conditions, which will help Aquarius to preserve cash through the 
current downturn.

With the platinum industry in surplus and the price well below marginal cost, 
a key issue is how industry leader Anglo Platinum will respond. On its own 
Marikana (which produces just over 1% of world supply) is insufficient to right 
the balance, but mothballing this operation is certainly a step in the right 
direction and demonstrates a willingness on the part of Anglo Platinum to shut 
loss making capacity.
