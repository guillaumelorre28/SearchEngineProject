It’s been seven years since Robert Forster last released a solo album. During 
that time, the Go-Betweens founder has been busying himself producing albums 
(The John Steel Singers, Halfway), publishing music criticism (The Ten Rules of 
Rock and Roll) and compiling what will eventually be three boxsets charting the 
lifespan of his former band .

He’s also spent time writing music, and Songs To Play is the result of that – 
recorded on a studio atop a mountain close tohis Brisbane home

. According to Forster, the gap between albums has only helped the creative 
process: “I wanted time to pass, for there to be a cut-off. I knew what 
happened next would be the start of something new.”

It will be identifiably Robert Forster to longtime fans – melodic, sharp and 
literate. But there are surprises too: Love Is Where It Is experiments with a 
bossa nova backdrop, whereas A Poet Walks is decorated with mariachi horns.
