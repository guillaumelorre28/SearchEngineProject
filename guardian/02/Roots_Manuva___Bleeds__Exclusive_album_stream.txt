Roots Manuva’s Bleeds is an album that doesn’t sit still long enough to pin it 
down. One minute you’re listening by the spooky dub of Crying, the next an 
explosion of patois, cockney rhyming slang and typically far-out Four Tet 
production for Facety 2:11. From there, you’re straight into Don’t Breathe Out, 
a soulful, Barry White sampling affair packed with melody.

Rodney Smith has long been hailed as the leading light of UK hip-hop but he’s 
never allowed himself to be enveloped into the mainstream. This sixth album is 
no different, and features a range of forward-thinking collaborators including 
Adrian Sherwood, With You and young British producer Fred. You can listen to it
