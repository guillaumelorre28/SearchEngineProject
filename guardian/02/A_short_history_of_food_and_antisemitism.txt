Thank you for running the Associated Press photograph of Mayor La Guardia 
eating with his hands, which was used by the Nazis for antisemitic propaganda (

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/30/associated-press-cooperation-nazis-revealed-germany-harriet-scharnberg>
, 31 March). It reminded me of someone eating a bacon sandwich, but I can’t now 
remember who that was. How lucky we are that this sort of thing happens so much 
more subtly nowadays.

• With the mention of the lack of a particular brand of fast food outlet 
within the Lake District National Park (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/30/on-the-right-tracks-about-brokeback-mountain-and-brief-encounter>
, 31 March), I am minded of the tale of one hungry French-Canadian lady who 
arrived late one Sunday night in Ballachulish, just to the north of Glencoe. 
Finding all restaurants closed and in desperate need of sustenance, she 
inquired of a local as to whether there were any McDonald’s in the area. The 
pithy response was: “Not any more, no!”

• Our friends’ father certainly doesn’t miss C&A (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/28/remembering-the-indy-and-ca>, 29 
March), despite his insistence of wearing nothing but C&A underwear. He 
instructs friends to buy a year’s supply of underpants from the shop just 
outside Munich station every time they pass through on their way to the ski 
slopes.
