Girl, Girl, Girl, Girl, Girl, Girl, Girl, Girl. On the Train

– I’m Rachel. I’m on a train. I wanted to call this book Rachel on the Train 
but the publishers insisted I call it Girl on the Train. They said it would 
cash in on the Gone Girl market. I asked if they could persuade Gillian Flynn 
to change the name of her book to Gone Rachel. They said that was unlikely. 
Sorry, I’m rambling. I’m a bit pissed as usual. Oh look, the train has stopped 
and there’s the house I used to live in with Tom who’s now run off with that 
bitch Anna. Fuck me! Some new people have moved in down the road. They look 
well fit. I bet they are called Jason and Jess.

– I’m not called Jess, I’m called Megan. And I think I’m about to disappear. 
Yup, there I go. Going, going, gone girl.

– Anna, here. I’m sick of that fat pissed slag coming round and bothering me 
and Tom. It’s not nice of me to say that, but I feel I must be honest.

– Steady on girls. Girls! See what I did there. Anyway, I know it’s meant to 
be a three-way narrative but it’s basically my book, right? So why don’t you 
two shut up for a moment? Bloody hell, I’m sure I’d be able to remember more 
about Megan’s disappearance if only I hadn’t blacked out.

– I’m not as reliable as I first suggested.

– Me neither.

– I’ve stopped drinking and am having a bit of therapy. I guess my memory 
might come back soon.

– I’m losing the will to live.

– Just as well.

– Yay! I now remember everything. I’ve solved the mystery.

The Buried Giant

Kazuo Ishiguro

Think of a world as full of magical creatures as Middle-Earth. Then make it 
really dull

In the years after the Romans left, the land was full of ogres. I do not want 
to give the impression there were no fine-dining experiences to be had, but 
most endured miserable lives underground.

Let us now turn to Axl and Beatrice, two elderly Britons. A deep growl rent 
the air. “That’s just Oliver the Not-Very-Scary Ogre,” said Axl. “Now where was 
I? I forget.”

“That’s the trouble with this mist sent to us by Querig the Queer She-Dragon – 
it makes us forget everything.”

“I seem to remember, though, Princess, that we might have once had a son.”

Verily, Beatrice and Axl set out on their awfully big adventure, even though 
they knowest not what they were doing due to the mist. Ere long, they chanced 
upon Brian the Boatman, who took them across the river. A large young man 
appeared before them. “I am Wistan the Warrior,” he said. “And you must leave 
now with me and this young boy, Edwin the Eejit, who has been bitten by an 
ogre.” The four slipped away through the mist until they came across an elderly 
knight with Horace the Horse.

“Who goes there?” said Sir Gawain, for it was he. “Bugger me,” Axl replied. 
“Didn’t you once sleep with my Princess when I was off killing someone?”

Sir Gawain and Wistan the Warrior engaged in mortal combat. Sir Gawain fell. 
“You know what, Axl?” he said as he lay dying. “I think I did shag your wife. 
This remembering lark isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.”

“We’d give anything to forget this,” said the readers.

Go Set A Watchman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/12/go-set-a-watchman-review-harper-lee-to-kill-a-mockingbird>
Harper Lee

The unwanted, unloved elder sibling of To Kill A Mockingbird

It was an elegantly written first sentence worthy of the most earnest 
unpublished first novel. Jean Louise settled back into a sophisticated New York 
silence, breathing in the fragrance of the heavy southern air as the train 
reached Maycomb.

“Please can we just sit down and talk about how you defended the Negro Tom 
Robinson 20 years ago, Atticus,” she said. “It’s not ringing any bells.” Only 
the singing of a few startled finches broke the heavily pregnant silence.

The next morning a desperate Negro came running to the door. “My son has run 
over and killed a white man. Please help.”

“Sure.”

Jean Louise’s heart filled with joy. Atticus was a good man after all!

“Thing is, Scout,” Atticus said later. “It’s far better for me to come along 
and take the case than leave it to some civil rights lawyer. Them lawyers are 
causin’ a whole heap of trouble round here.”

“If you won’t defend a Negro properly then come to the aid of an 89-year-old 
lady who has had a stroke and is almost totally deaf and blind. Poor Miss Nelle 
was determined not to let anyone read another word she’d written and now her 
lawyer and publishers have decided to cash in on a piss-poor, first-draft 
manuscript.”

Atticus yawned. His rheumatoid arthritis was tiring him out. “It’s not one for 
me, Scout. I hate geriatrics even more than I hate Negros. Now, if you don’t 
mind, I’ve got a Klu Klux Klan meeting to go to.” Racialism was more difficult 
than Jean Louise had initially thought.

EL James

Come again? If you insist ...

I can’t get away from that recurring dream where I’m rewriting the same book 
as before. The thought of the pain on readers’ faces when they realise just how 
badly they’ve been screwed makes my enormous cock harden.

“Hello,” says a young woman called Anastasia. “I’m here to interview you. Are 
you gay?”

“No,” I say. “But I do have a sudden insatiable desire to mercilessly 
fist-fuck you.”

“I’m only a virgin,” Anna replies. “Can we take things more slowly?

I instruct her in the basic rules of our relationship. I will buy her a laptop 
and in return she will allow me to abuse her in whatever way I want.

“Sounds reasonable,” she says, “though I’d like to go easy on the crucifixions 
early doors. What happens now?”

“While I am wondering whether to fall in love with you, I shall take you off 
on pointless trips while my enormous cock continues to explode inside you at 
regular intervals.”

“Is there anything I can do to help?”

“You could always let me be steadily more abusive.”

“Very well,” she sobs. “Flog me until I yelp because I understand this is the 
only way you can be emotionally healed.”

I am so proud of her as she literally explodes into the biggest orgasm anyone 
has ever had.

“I love you so much, but I’m not sure I can do this again,” she cries, running 
out the room.

I am distraught. I think about my Mum.

“Let’s give it another go,” she says. My enormous cock erupts in delight.

My Brilliant Friend
Elena Ferrante

The first part of the Neapolitan trilogy in which almost nothing happens

Rino called in the fetid heat of the Neapolitan night. His mother had gone 
missing. Everyone else called her Lina. Not me. I call her Lila. Two weeks 
passed. The fetid heat became more fetid. Where was she?

We had met more than 60 years ago. I feel no nostalgia for my childhood. Life 
was brutal. Blood flowed like rivers through the backstreets. Characters 
wandered in and out of the novel so randomly it was hard to remember who they 
were. Or care.

I was lucky. I was allowed to carry on going to school. Each day I made my way 
past strangers stabbing one another and the bloated carcasses of rotting cats. 
Lila wasn’t so lucky. She had to leave school and work in the family shoe 
factory.

Blood poured from my vagina. “I’m having my period too,” Lila told me. That 
knowledge made us feel close.

“Why are people reading this book?” she asked one day. “I’ve no idea. 
Apparently someone from the New Yorker thought it was a masterpiece. I’m told 
it’s brilliantly translated.”

“Shame we don’t speak English then.”

Life became hard. Someone I had barely mentioned died. Blood, dirt and dust 
was everywhere. We were living in the real Naples. “I’m getting married to 
Stefano,” Lila said, her cuts and bruises coated in dried blood.

“I’ve got some new shoes.”

I was jealous. I was also 14 and wanted to be married.

“So where is my mother, then?” asked Rino.

“I’ve no idea. This is only the first book in a trilogy and I’ve reached my 
word count. You’ll have to go and buy the others.”

“You might have told me.”

The relentlessly downbeat family saga that puts your own miserable holiday in 
perspective

Hanna trudged wearily along the country road. This was an Ireland deeply 
evocative of the 1980s, she thought. Mainly because that’s where this opening 
section of the novel was set. “Has the old matriarch got a headache?” the 
chemist asked. “To be sure,” she replied. “Rosaleen is very upset Dan is going 
to be a priest.”

It was now 1991 and Dan was living in New York and had become one of the most 
cliched gay men in literature. “I love cock me, oh my you’ve got a big one, I 
will try and fit you in. Though I am worried about Aids because it is 1991.”

“Phew,” said Emmet, “thank God I’ve got away from the lot of them by moving to 
Mali.”

Ireland was becoming more modern, though Constance was still five years behind 
the rest of her siblings in 1997. She couldn’t help thinking she ought to get 
out more. “Happy fucking Christmas,” Rosaleen shouted in 2005. “Now you’ve all 
finally come home, I’m going to sell the house.” Hanna, Dan, Emmet and 
Constance all pondered this deeply and felt they had learned something about 
the nature of fractured family life in Ireland.

Napoleon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/13/napoleon-the-great-andrew-roberts-review>
 the Great
Andrew Roberts

Little man writes big book about a little man

Although only 5ft 4¾in tall, Napoleon was actually a giant among men 
considering the standards of the day. Obviously he was a bit smaller than that 
when he was born in Corsica in 1769, but he quickly grew to his full height and 
went on to become the greatest person to have ever lived. It is a little – I 
use that word advisedly – known fact that many British people actually quite 
admired Napoleon despite him being a Frenchie, though obviously they drew the 
line at all that revolutionary nonsense.
 Napoleon the Great. Photograph: PR 
Despite being only 5ft 4¾in tall, Napoloeon was also an incredibly attractive 
man whom no woman could resist. This was an immense burden to him all his life; 
one that he bore stoically. It was hugely disappointing that, after winning so 
many battles, he should have lost the one that really mattered at Waterloo. It 
is my belief that Wellington cheated by taking away Napoleon’s ladder, thereby 
ensuring he couldn’t see properly. Andrew Roberts is 5ft ¾in tall.

 Hot Feminist. Photograph: PR 
I ain’t going to tell a lie. I think about the way I look, like, a lot. Like 
maybe all the time. Because, let’s face it, who wouldn’t if they were as hot as 
me? Even modern feminism – with all its CAPITAL LETTERS, being totally 
prescriptive about how hairy your bush can be and what you can and can’t do 
ironically – is just totes dullssville when you’re really hot. Look, I’m not 
saying you can’t be a hot feminist if you’re chubby but, like, take a reality 
check. Yes you, fatso in the size 10. So what is hot? Hot is when you look like 
me. Hot is when you just have the slutty urge to wear next to nothing and you 
are so waxed there is not a pube in sight. Hot is when you are over 40 and you 
can just tell every male half your age is still gagging to fuck you but you let 
them down ever so gently by reminding them you’re already in a relationship 
with someone who picks up your clothes. So that’s it; hot feminsism is about 
being ME and not being pushed into a corner by everyone in the sisterhood who 
is a bit uglier than me.

It was an overcast morning in late March 1974 when Robert Caro pronounced 
himself happy with the 1,174 page manuscript. It had just been confirmed to him 
by three independent witnesses that, as he had suspected, the legal notebook 
Robert Moses had used in his planning depositions of 1937 had, indeed, been 
yellow and not pale orange and the final alterations had been made.

Caro felt sure that Moses would have approved: the man who had risen from 
obscurity to build and reshape the New York landscape had never left anything 
to chance. The power lay in the detail and power was Caro’s subject, every bit 
as much as Moses. Surely it was only a matter of time before a future president 
would come to cite his work as a seminal influence.

No matter then that by the time this book would be published in Britain more 
than 40 years later, almost no one outside America would have a clue who Moses 
was. This was not a book to be read on a summer holiday. Had he intended it to 
be, Caro would have made sure it was published on Kindle to save using up 
one-third of the Ryanair baggage allowance. Nor was it a book he necessarily 
ever imagined anyone having the time to read, as the print was so small.

No, this was a book worthy to stand shoulder to shoulder with Moses. An object 
to be admired every bit as much as the Triborough bridge. And just as visible.

More Human

Steve Hilton

I’ve got this really big idea about how politics should really be a bit, like, 
more human

When I was working as David Cameron’s director of strategy at No 10, I had 
this moment of revelation. Deep down, we are all human and if only we could get 
away from some of the things that make us less human then we could all be a bit 
more human. That is the circle of life.

Education is a really big subject, one that is at the heart of becoming more 
human. That’s why I was happy to help Michael Gove start a profound revolution 
to test children ever more rigorously in profit-making schools that are free to 
do whatever they want as long as they get good results and if it just so 
happens that all the middle-class children end up learning Latin in the same 
school then that’s cool because the market can be more human too.

Health is a really big subject, one that is at the heart of becoming more 
human. Food is a really big subject, one that is at the heart of becoming more 
human. Inequality is a really big subject, one that is at the heart of becoming 
more human. Too much of big business and government depends on nepotism and 
unfair life chances. I know this as well as anyone. That needs to change, which 
is why I would like to be Mayor of London. Being more human means loving nature 
and ourselves and recognising that deep down we are simultaneously both the 
same and completely different and that we must embrace our humanity in a good 
way, not a bad way. Vote Steve. A better world is a Hiltworld.

At 9.33am on 23 May 1995 Dell Glover parked his Cherokee jeep in the parking 
lot numbered 36G at the North Carolina record processing plant where he worked. 
He was perspiring, though not freely, because the ambient outside temperature 
was still only 19.52C. He went into his office, helped himself to several new 
CDs and took them home. At 17.08 he parked his Cherokee jeep outside his 
nextdoor neighbour’s house because the spot outside his own house was being 
used. Dell went indoors and switched on his computer, a Dell 4000 running the 
latest Windows 95 operating system. He put the CDs into an external CD drive, 
because the internal drive wasn’t working, and then downloaded some music.

Almost at the same time in Germany, where the ambient temperature was several 
degrees lower, Karlheinz Brandenburg cunningly invented the MP3 file in a 
process described at length over 30,000 pages. This was the single most 
exciting thing that had ever happened in world history since Pink Floyd 
accidentally turned up the red dial in Abbey road’s studio at 11.17pm on 23 
April 23 1974, as it meant that no one had to pay for their music any more.

How to be an MP
Paul Flynn

Bloody SNP. They come down to Westminster, sit in the wrong seats and start 
clapping. I ask you. They should read this

When I was first elected to the house, Maggie was in her pomp in 1984 and I 
just didn’t have a clue how to fiddle my expenses properly or even which lobby 
to walk through during a division. I was reminded of all this just after this 
year’s general election when you couldn’t have a quiet G&T in the Stranger’s 
bar without some new Scots Nat MP spoiling things by getting rather rowdy. Some 
of them even clapped in the chamber and tried to steal other members’ seats. 
Poor show, really. If only they’d read this marvellous little book that some 
chappy called Flynn – he’s a decent sort even though he is Labour – wrote back 
in the 90s about how to survive as an MP.

 How to be an MP. Photograph: PR 
It’s really frightfully good, if a little sardonic at times for my liking, as 
it tells you everything you need to know about how to get round the party 
whips, how to ask the prime minister the kind of question he doesn’t mind being 
asked, how to keep your annoying constituents at arm’s length – I mean, happy – 
how to make sure you get your name in the local paper, how to make sure you are 
re-elected (clearly not enough Lib Dems read this bit) and climb the jolly old 
greasy pole if that’s your sort of thing. Obviously I’m not going to read it 
myself as it’s all terribly old hat to an old lag like me, but I’m told it 
hasn’t dated at all and would be of tremendous value to a new MP. What’s that? 
There’s a chapter on how to get a bunk up to the Lords. Hmm. I might just have 
a look at that. Bring on the dissolution honours list, I say.
