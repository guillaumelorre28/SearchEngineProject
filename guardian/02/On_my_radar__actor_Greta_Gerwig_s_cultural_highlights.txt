Greta Gerwig <https://www.theguardian.com/film/greta-gerwig>, 31, was born in 
California. After graduating from Barnard College, plans to become a playwright 
were derailed by involvement in themumblecore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/07/mumblecore-andrew-bujalski-computer-chess>
 scene. The awkward and naturalistic film genre saw her collaborate with 
director Joe Swanberg on films such as 2007’sHannah Takes the Stairs 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf0ksFCaeI8>. Her role in Noah Baumbach’s 
Greenberg <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmTZmGrXRNk> (2010) earned her an 
Independent Spirit nomination for best female lead. She co-scripted 2013’s 
Frances Ha <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpu6Sg5GT_U> with her by now 
partner Baumbach, her part in which saw her nominated for a Golden Globe and a 
London Film Critics’ Circle award. Her new filmEden, directed by Mia 
Hansen-Løve, is out now.

A$AP Rocky – At.Long.Last.A$AP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/01/stream-listen-new-albums-jamie-xx-asap-rocky-florence-machine>


I don’t have my finger on the pulse of what’s popular in music at the moment. 
I’m not a hip person. I discover music in the way nerdy kids discover music. 
It’s not like I heard A$AP at the club! I’ve just always really liked him. I 
felt like A$AP and Kendrick [Lamar] came out at the same time. I love the 
Kendrick album [To Pimp a Butterfly], too. At.Long.Last.A$AP 
<https://soundcloud.com/at-long-last-asap-album> is A$AP’s second album and 
it’s beautiful and strange. The songL$D 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEG2VTHS9yg> was the first track I heard. I 
don’t think I’ve heard any song that explicitly sexy since the days of Prince. 
When I first heard it I thought, This is the sex jam of the summer! It’s got 
that languid but directed vibe. The way it’s arranged is really lush and vivid.

On Elizabeth Bishop by Colm Tóibín 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285547/s/on-elizabeth-bishop/>


I love his writing. I love Brooklyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/28/brooklyn-colm-toibin-review-bookclub>
 and I recently readNora Webster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/05/nora-webster-review-colm-toibin-powerful-study-widowhood-love-letter-to-ireland>
. He’s one of my favourites right now.On Elizabeth Bishop is just so beautiful. 
I feel like poetry is something I love, but I don’t have enough of a knowledge 
base to appreciate it as deeply as I know it can be appreciated.On Elizabeth 
Bishop is great because there’s something so special about writers illuminating 
poetry. I love reading other poets writing about poetry too. Mary Oliver wrotea 
book called The Poetry Handbook 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/A-Poetry-Handbook-Mary-Oliver/dp/0156724006> where she 
broke down different poems and explains why they’re great. But it’s not from 
the perspective of an academic, it’s from the perspective of a writer. I find 
that more interesting; they’re more intimately connected with it because 
they’re building stuff from the same material. That’s how I felt aboutColm 
Tóibín <https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/09/colm-toibin-brooklyn>.

Peaky Blinders <https://www.netflix.com/title/80002479>


I don’t really watch TV. The sheer volume of episodes and seasons that a show 
has is overwhelming. There is just so much of a show like Mad Men. 
I’ll occasionally tune back into Season 7 and I’ll think: What, they’restill in 
that office? Because of that, I really like BBC shows. They will just do six 
episodes a season. It’s much more approachable. I can wrap my head around 
watching six hours of content. On a friend’s recommendation, I watchedPeaky 
Blinders in two days. It’s really fun. Cillian Murphy is electric in it. I’ve 
never felt turned on by men who fix horse races but now I totally am! I spend a 
lot of time talking about the slow-motion walking shots with my friend. There 
is always one man pulling a sack of grain across the road. You know there is an 
assistant director telling him: “Drag that sack now!”

The Apu trilogy <http://www.janusfilms.com/aputrilogy/>


There was a recent rerelease of this Satyajit Ray trilogy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/05/satyajit-ray-pather-panchali-restoration-apu-trilogy>
. It was made in the 50s. It’s three films about this boy who was changing 
really rapidly. It’s very emotional. The negative prints of the films were 
stored in a film laboratory in London. There was a fire in the vault in 1993 
and the negatives were lost in the blaze. Damage was done, but they were partly 
salvaged and sent to LA. Criterion restored the negatives by rehydrating them. 
They made these new prints and they rereleased it. It was just amazing because 
the footage was so pristine. It was so beautiful. The restoration was just 
gorgeous. They showed the trilogy in New York and it was tremendous to be able 
to watch it on the big screen in the way it was meant to be seen.

His photographs are incredible. They are black-and-white street photography 
from New York in the 1950s and 60s. Winogrand had this ability to capture these 
bursts of energy. Looking at a picture by him is like being at a baseball game 
at the moment when all the bases are loaded and things are about to happen. His 
photographs feel like a match lit under dynamite, and he had an ability to 
capture that key moment. When you look at his work it is almost kinetic. It 
feels like listening to a song and being awoken by it. You really get a contact 
high from his photographs.

The Flick <http://www.barrowstreettheatre.com/index.asp>


It’s a revival of a play by Annie Baker at the Barrow Street theatre, New 
York. It won the Pulitzer prize for drama in 2014. It’s set in a movie theatre 
in Massachusetts and the plot concerns film employees who clean up the 
theatre after the shows. It’s a play that is filled with silences, but it’s 
incredibly funny and moving. I’d go as far as to say that it is one of the best 
things I’ve ever seen and that Baker is my favourite playwright at the moment. 
It’s interesting that she actually wrote the part for the lead actor Matthew 
Maher. In film that happens quite a lot, but it happens less in theatre, I 
think because theatre is so transient and authors always try to write things 
that are “actor-proof”.
