the Jamaican “vivandiere” who aided soldiers on the battlefront during the 
Crimean war and set up a “British Hotel” from which she sold food, drink and 
other supplies to the army, featured regularly in the pages of the Observer and 
the Manchester Guardian, both during the war and afterwards when she was living 
in London.

The reports, notices and classified ads in which she appears show how she was 
well-loved by servicemen and the wider public. So well-loved, in fact, that 
when she returned from the war in 1856 bankrupted by her activities, there were 
several attempts to raise money to support her. One of the most successful was 
her autobiography,The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wonderful-Adventures-Seacole-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140439021>
.

As soon as the book was published in July 1857, the Observer printed an 
extract and was full of praise for her and her autobiography, beginning: “Those 
who would wish to know what special claims of interest Mrs Seacole possesses on 
our sympathies cannot do better than refer to her ‘Memoirs’”.

 Observer 27 July 1857 Extract from Mary Seacole’s memoirs 
The extract includes a moving description of how Seacole was affected by the 
deaths of soldiers who referred to her as “mother”: “I used to think it was 
like having a large family of children ill with fever, and dreading to hear 
which one had passed away in the night.”

The book was a huge hit, selling out its first run and being reprinted in 1858.

The troops’ enduring high regard for Seacole is shown in a short report in the 
Manchester Guardian of her visiting “military and naval heroes” in 1859, which 
describes how she was “received with the best feelings by officers and men 
[who] cheered her most enthusiastically.”

 Manchester Guardian 4 Feb 1859 Mary Seacole visits servicemen 
There had been previous attempts to raise money in aid of Seacole. As early as 
November 1856 a notice appeared in the Observer about a Reform Club member 
offering £20 to start a subscription on her behalf, and in 1857 a Seacole Fund 
was set up.
