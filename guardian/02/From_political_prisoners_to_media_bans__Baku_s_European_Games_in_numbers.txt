The European Games in Azerbaijan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/azerbaijan>
 have been shrouded in controversy from the start, amid questions about whether 
a country with such a poor human rights record should host an international 
sporting event.

The run-up to the Games saw President Ilham Aliyev’s government crack down on 
dissenting voices, locking up journalists and activists on a scale unparalleled 
in the post-Soviet era, according to Human Rights Watch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/11/azerbaijan-bans-guardian-european-games-baku-2015>
.

Amnesty International was blocked from visiting, and a number of media outlets,
including the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/11/azerbaijan-bans-guardian-european-games-baku-2015>
, were refused permission to report on the Games.

Writing after his visa was denied, the Guardian’s chief sports correspondent 
Owen Gibson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jun/11/baku-2015-european-games-human-rights-issues-azerbaijan-ilham-aliyev>
pointed to the irony inherent in the government’s heavy handed efforts to 
prevent negative coverage of the event.

As the athletes make their way home after Sunday’s closing ceremony, we look 
at the legacy of the Games - from the millions spent to cover athletes’ 
expenses to the dozens who remain behind bars because of their political 
activities.

£6.5bn bill

Baku was the only bidder <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33120445> for 
the first ever European Games. The inaugural event, reputed to have cost 
£6.5bn, saw6,000 athletes from 5o European countries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2015/jun/11/european-games-flame-opening-ceremony-azerbaijan-video>
 take part in20 sporting events 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jun/11/baku-2015-european-games-human-rights-issues-azerbaijan-ilham-aliyev>
.

The Guardian revealed in February that Azerbaijan would foot the bill for the 
travel andaccommodation of all of the competing athletes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/feb/26/azerbaijan-european-games-baku-athletes-bill-human-rights>
.

Azeri-based news organisation Medyan TV later highlighted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/20/azerbaijan-european-games-shadow-poverty>
 the stark contrast between the Games budget and that of a family of five 
living in the shadow of construction, who struggle to get by on 300 Azerbaijani 
manats ($175) a month.

‘$2m’ for Lady Gaga 

The glitzy opening ceremony took place in Baku’s 68,000-seater stadium, which 
took workers 20.5 million hours to build, according to theofficial Baku 2015 
website 
<http://www.baku2015.com/news/article/lady-gaga-perform-opening-ceremony-baku-2015-european-games.html>
.

Lady Gaga was reported 
<http://www.eurosport.co.uk/athletics/lady-gaga-paid-2m-to-sing-at-opening-of-european-games_sto4784576/story.shtml>
 to have been paid $2m (£1.3m) to perform one song – Imagine by John Lennon. 
“She can now add an appearance at the historic first European Games to that 
glittering CV,”said the organisers 
<http://www.baku2015.com/news/article/lady-gaga-perform-opening-ceremony-baku-2015-european-games.html>
.

Another 2,000 performers joined Lady Gaga on the opening night in a production 
that used 2,000 lighting fixtures, 12,000 earpieces for the staff and 
performers and 800 speakers.According to the Azeri sports minister Azad Rahimov 
<http://www.rferl.org/content/european-games-cost-azerbaijan-ceremony/27070753.html>
, it cost $95m (£60m) to stage. In contrast, London’s 2012 Olympic opening 
ceremony cost $42m (£26m).

Few European leaders attended the ceremony, but there were several 
long-serving heads of state. Together Russia’s Vladimir Putin; Turkey’s Recep 
Tayyip Erdogan; Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko; Kazakhstan’s Nursultan 
Nazarbayev and Tajikistan’s Emomali Rahmon, all in attendance, have ruled for a 
combined 71 years,wrote Buzzfeed’s Max Seddon

There are currently about 100 political detainees, at least 20 of whom are 
identified as “prisoners of conscience” 
<https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/azerbaijan/report-azerbaijan/>
 by Amnesty International.

Human Rights Watch points  
<http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/06/11/azerbaijan-baku-games-begin-amid-widespread-repression-0>
to 35 incidents in 2014 alone of human rights defenders, political activists 
and journalists being detained, prosecuted or imprisoned.

There are 161 places in the world where it is better to be a journalist than 
Azerbaijan, according to the2015 World Press Freedom Index 
<https://index.rsf.org/#!/>.

Reporters Without Borders points out that Azerbaijan has no independent TV 
stations, and that two of the four independent media outlets were shut down in 
2015 – with the remaining ones being “throttled economically”. The leading 
opposition newspaper, Azadliq, has been fined more than €1.4m in the past five 
years.

One delegation raises human rights

There were 253 medal events at the Games, held in 18 competition venues and 
six temporary arenas. Russia topped the medal table with 164 gold, silver and 
bronze medal wins, followed by Germany with 66 and Azerbaijan in third with 56.

Baku 2015 laid on 7,351 beds in the athletes village and, while most came and 
went quietly, a group of German athletes spoke to the newspaperFrankfurt 
Allgemeine 
<http://www.faz.net/aktuell/sport/sportpolitik/europa-spiele-deutsche-sportler-fordern-freiheit-13629392.html>
 to demand the release of the political prisoners.

150,000 people say #HelloBaku in hashtag war 

An official campaign asking people to say #HelloBaku on social media to win 
tickets to the opening ceremony was derailed in Aprilby rights campaigners 
<https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2015/04/twitter-users-hijack-hellobaku-to-shine-spotlight-on-azerbaijans-human-rights-abuses/>
 sharing government attempts to clamp down on freedoms.

In run up to the games hashtags including #HelloBaku, #Baku2015, 
#EuropeanGames and #RealBaku became a battlefield,reported the BBC 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-33081088>, as those loyal to the 
government orchestrated a campaign to get the conversation back to sport.

According to social media tracking site Topsy, the three most popular hashtags 
of the games were #HelloBaku <http://topsy.com/s?q=%23hellobaku>, #Baku2015 
<http://topsy.com/s?q=%23Baku2015> and #RealBaku 
<http://topsy.com/s?q=%23realbaku>.

One fake British tourist? 

The average ticket price ranged from two to five mannats (£1.20-£3), with the 
“family friendly” Games offering free tickets to under 16s in most venues. 
Opening ceremony tickets cost 200 mannats (£120), with the closing ceremony 
costing half that.

A spokesperson for the ministry of culture and tourism said “many more 
tourists” were enjoying Baku and its museums as aresult of the Games 
<http://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/baku2015/2409394.html>. 

The ministry said that they hoped tourism would increase by 30-40% in the next 
few years, resulting in 5 million visitors a year by 2020. Real tourist numbers 
are hard to ascertain and questions have been raised about the authenticity of 
some of those quoted on TV.

A “British tourist” giving his name as James Bonar was featured on national 
television dishing out effusive praise for “wonderful” Azerbaijan, but his 
shaky command of English cast doubt on his authenticity,leaving some to question
 <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-33203120> whether he’d been used 
prop to promote the games.
