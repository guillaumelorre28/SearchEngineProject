Q I would like some advice on debt collection agencies because I have been in 
debt since January 2002. My debts were due to various credit card companies, 
mail order agencies, and several loans.

I am confused and frustrated because the companies to whom I owe money have 
transferred my debts to a debt collection agency, rather than continuing to 
accept my monthly payments. What advice do you have on how I should deal with 
these organisations?

A Debt collection agencies are increasingly used by companies to claim back 
the money owed to them by customers. If you have been late paying a credit card 
bill or have fallen into arrears with a loan, there is a chance that your case 
may be transferred to a debt collection agency.

It can be quite unpleasant to have these agencies hassling you for money, 
particularly if you are struggling with debts or have cashflow problems.

If you are facing problems with debt, your first port of call should be a free 
appointment with a money adviser at your localPayPlan 
<http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/>, who will provide a free service that 
involves negotiating with your creditors.

Then you can contact the company to whom you owe the money and agree a 
manageable repayment plan. You may need to take legal advice and have a 
solicitors' letter to send to the debt collection agency to make sure they 
leave you alone, but the money adviser will be able to tell you whether this 
would be appropriate in your case.
