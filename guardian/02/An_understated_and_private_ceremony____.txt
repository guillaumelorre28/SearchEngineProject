Katie Price and Celebrity Big Brother 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/big-brother> winner Alex Reid took 
their wedding vows in Las Vegas, saying they had not agreed to a magazine deal 
for wedding photos because they wanted to show they were marrying for love and 
not money. So much so that they were accompanied by not one but two ITV film 
crews.
