Fats Waller and Wild Bill Davis were among the earliest jazz pianists to 
experiment with the organ, but it was not until Jimmy Smith, then an unknown 
Philadelphia musician, made the switch in 1951 that the instrument began to 
migrate from churches into the nightclubs of black America. Smith's 
blues-drenched albums on the Blue Note label started a trend and inspired such 
followers as Jimmy McGriff, Jack McDuff and John Patton.
