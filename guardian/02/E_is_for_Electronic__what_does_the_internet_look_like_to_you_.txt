When we talk about the internet, much like when we talk about other
unseeable things, we often resort to metaphors. In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee’s 
notion of the “web” allowed us to conjure a mental image, but it never quite 
explained how we move through it. Al Gore’s popularisation of the term “the 
Information Superhighway” was more descriptive, but since then we’ve surfed a 
chaotic path that has led us through “cyberspace” to the unknowable and 
untouchable “cloud”. What do these metaphors really mean, and how do they alter 
art?

Let’s consider the electronic superhighway – a metaphor that represents the 
internet as something we can both see and touch. We know how to give and 
receive instructions.
We can see others on the road, and we are informed when others are watching 
us. The rules of the system are clearly communicated and apply equally to 
everyone.

Korean American artist Nam June Paik is considered the first to coin the 
phrase when he described an “electronic superhighway” that would connect New 
York to Los Angeles through a telecommunication network that relied on laser 
beam fibre optics. His landmark sculpture of the same name poignantly commented 
on current and future media landscapes, yet is accessible to audiences not 
necessarily versed in art or media theory. Paik’s sculpture, much like Gore’s 
phrase, was designed to draw people into a conversation.

The “cloud” metaphor seems to serve the opposite purpose. It visualises the
internet as something we cannot fathom, touch or alter. This benefits the 
companies that give us small amounts of data storage in exchange for access to 
our emails and browsing behaviours. To sell us on the cloud, they need us to 
believe that they are the only ones capable of making and maintaining it. 
Though many of us do not fully understand the implications, the “cloud” is 
sadly becoming an
increasingly accurate metaphor for our current relationship with the internet.

Our acceptance of the “cloud” idea affects how we live and make art online. 
But the electronic superhighway is still there, even if it is becoming harder 
to see through the mist. As artists and global citizens, we should question how 
we are told to think about the internet and decide ourselves how we want to 
depict the online landscape.

So this month’s challenge, as part of The A to Z of Reader’s Art 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/01/a-to-z-of-readers-art-new-project-share-your-art>
, is to create artworks that show your vision of the internet.
