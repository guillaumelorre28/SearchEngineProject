Australia Post <https://www.theguardian.com/business/australia-post> hopes a 
$51.4m lifeline for struggling small post offices and agents will help sustain 
services in rural and remote areas.


Ahmed Fahour, the chief executive and managing director, said the money would 
be delivered by increasing annual payments to almost 1,000 small post offices 
across the country.

Parcel-handling rates will also be raised to better reflect the cost of 
delivering the service.


“We’ve been working closely with our licensees to identify how to best support 
them in the face of digitisation, a significant challenge facing our 
traditional letters business,” Fahour said in a statement.


“The new small Post Office support plan will immediately strengthen the future 
sustainability of 478 LPOs [local post offices] and 495 CPAs [community postal 
agencies] across rural and remote Australia.”


The announcement followed an independent review which examined the cost of 
running these services, and how the revenue compared to expenditure.


The $51.4m increase will be delivered from 1 July, but the long-term future of 
the scheme depends on postage rates rising to $1 for a standard letter.


Australia Post announced in March it would introduce a two-speed mail service 
that will slow the delivery of regular letters.


Fahour said the internet had made Australia Post regulations outdated, as 
letter volumes dropped rapidly. Without reform, the letter delivery business 
would lose $1bn each year, Fahour said.
