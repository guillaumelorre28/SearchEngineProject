Duke Ellington's orchestra, a dominant creative force from the 1920s to the 
40s, was struggling with changing tastes. A midnight show after thunderstorms 
at the 1956 Newport jazz festival didn't seem like the time for a comeback. But 
tenor saxophonist Paul Gonsalves blew 27 consecutive improvised choruses on 
Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue in a rousing, R&B-like style, driving the 
crowd into a frenzy  and reviving the band's fortunes.
