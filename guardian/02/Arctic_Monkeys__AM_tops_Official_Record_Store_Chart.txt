 has topped the Official Record Store Chart which takes into account album 
releases since last year's Record Store Day.

Published by the Official Charts Company, the list features the biggest 
selling albums in the UK's independent record shops, and is lead by the 
Sheffield band’s fifth studio album, which was released in September last year.

 Random Access Memories and Robbie Williams’ big band Swings Both Ways to the 
top spot. All three albums debuted at No 1 during their release weeks.

While purchases in independent record stores could be typically affiliated 
with fans of counter culture, the chart features an abundance of mainstream pop 
artists this year: Gary Barlow's Since I Saw You Last clocks in at No 6, Olly 
Murs' Right Place Right Time enters at No 17 and One Direction, whose last 
album was thebestselling album in the UK last year

, reaches No 9 in the charts. The Columbia signed boyband have perhaps tapped 
into their music's collectable indie appeal, and are releasing a Midnight 
Memories 7" picture disc at this year's Record Store Day.

Elsewhere, Lana Del Rey and Emeli Sande both feature in the latter half of the 
top 40, despite releasing albums in 2012 and 2011 respectively.

Newcomers Bastille, Jake Bugg, Disclosure, London Grammar, Haim, Tom Odell, 
the 1975 and Temples also enjoyed success with their debut albums. Findthe full
