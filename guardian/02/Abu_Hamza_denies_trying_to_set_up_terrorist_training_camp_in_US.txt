Abu Hamza <https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-hamza> al-Masri, the radical 
Islamist cleric extradited to the US from Britain, has pleaded not guilty to 
charges that he conspired with American citizens to set up a terrorist training 
camp in Oregon.

Abu Hamza entered the plea shortly before US district judge Katherine Forrest 
set an August 2013 trial date. Abu Hamza is also accused of helping to abduct 
16 hostages, two of them American tourists, in Yemen in 1998.

Earlier, two other men brought from Britain to face terrorism charges made 
their first appearance before a New York judge. Their trial was set for October 
next year.

Khaled al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul Bary denied participating in the bombings of 
embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in August 1998 which killed 224 people, 
including 12 Americans.

They were indicted in a case that also named Osama bin Laden.
