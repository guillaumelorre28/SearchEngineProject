Let's get this right. Ireland has agreed a €85bn rescue package from the EU 
and the IMF; Britain, Sweden and Denmark are chipping in with bilateral loans. 
One of the largest portions of the bailout fund will be used to support 
Ireland's banks, includingAllied Irish Banks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/allied-irish-bank>, which is to be saved 
via 95% nationalisation. Now, just in time for Christmas, AIB will dispatch 
€40m in bonuses to employees.

Yes, that's the story, roughly speaking: in a roundabout fashion, EU 
taxpayers, including Britain's, will be funding AIB's bonuses from 2008, a year 
when the bank was already extremely sick. If the bust Irish banks had been 
allowed to go to the wall, the bankers owed bonuses would have had to join a 
long list of creditors.

The craziness is not lost on Ireland's opposition politicians, who today 
called fora 99% supertax on the bonuses.

 Such a retrospective measure might struggle to get through the Irish courts – 
one AIB trader has already taken legal action to secure his €161,000.

But the payment defies common sense. It could also be electric – an 
easy-to-understand affair that may ensure prime minister Brian Cowen's Fianna 
Fáil party slumps to an even bigger defeat in next year's general election.
