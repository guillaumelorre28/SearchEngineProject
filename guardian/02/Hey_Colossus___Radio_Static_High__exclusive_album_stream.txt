Some bands like to challenge themselves by becoming increasingly experimental. 
But Hey Colossus, a six piece from London/Somerset who’ve long specialised in 
concocting an unholy racket, have found it more stimulating to head the other 
way.

As guitarist Jonathan Richards puts it: “After 12 years functioning in a 
noiserock/doom/kraut/whatever scene of sorts and being aware of unwanted 
repetition, we feel it is more subversive for us to compose songs with rigid 
song structures than it is to absentmindedly clang off another riff-athon.”

Fans worrying that Radio Static High – their second album this year – could be 
giving Taylor Swift a run for her money can relax. The band may cite Fleetwood 
Mac and Cypress Hill as influences here, but any effect those artist’s may have 
had on this record remain muted. Or, more accurately, bludgeoned under the kind 
of piledriver riffs so brutally delivered on tracks like the aptly named March 
of the Headaches.

Elsewhere, the Can-esque Hop the Railings and the hazy, meandering psych of 
Memories of Wonder do allow chinks of pop light to shine through, but this is 
still raw, uncompromising stuff.
