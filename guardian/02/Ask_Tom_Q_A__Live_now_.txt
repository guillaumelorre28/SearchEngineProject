About the only sure way of avoiding this dismal British summer at the moment 
is to flee the country. There are still a few weeks left before the school 
holidays start and holiday prices go through the roof – and with the weather 
forecast making such grim reading now is the ideal time to go and find some sun.

Tom will be here tomorrow with plenty of advice for sun-seekers – including 
where to go, last-minute deals and cheap flights.

And of course, Tom is up for tackling anything travel related – so if you have 
a query for him, please post a comment below.

Tom will be live online at 1pm BST on Wednesday.
