Richard Thorpe scored two tries as London Irish 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/londonirish> trounced a young Worcester 
side, the flanker striking in each half as both sides produced attacking rugby 
in testing conditions.

Irish scored the first try of a dead rubber when Bob Casey broke clear and 
Sailosi Tagicakibau sent Gonzalo Tiesi over in the corner, Eoghan Hickey 
converting.Worcester <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/worcesterrugby> replied 
when Joe Carlisle and Kai Horstmann put the winger Miles Benjamin in out wide. 
The home flanker Steffon Armitage then crashed over.

The Warriors fought back with another score, Carlisle freeing Marcel Garvey, 
but Thorpe scored his first before the break. After the re-start Tiesi put 
Tagicakibau over and Hickey kicked a penalty before Horstmann scored for the 
visitors.

The Exiles scored quick-fire tries from Nils Mordt and Thorpe before the hour 
and despite a Worcester try from the lock Will Bowley, Irish sent Warren Fury 
in for a final home try. Substitutions saw an increasing amount of errors creep 
into the game late on and it was the visitors who had the final word, Bowley 
again on hand to end a flowing move.
