When Storm Boy was released in 1976, the film was an instant hit. Australian 
audiences

 rushed to see the film adaptation of Colin Thiele’s novel, about a motherless 
boy, his recluse father, his secret friend Fingerbone Bill and a pelican named 
Mr Percival .

Storm Boy went on to take $3m at the Australian box office (equivalent to more 
<http://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualDecimal.html> than $17.5m in 2015), was 
shown at Cannes film festival and took home an AFI for best film.

Henri Safran’s film was also part of the new wave of Australian cinema. 
Hundreds of Australian films were made between 1970 and 1985, with many both 
critical and popular successes, and it remains a much-reminisced about time. 
Storm Boy is regarded as a classic of the era along with Walkabout, Picnic at 
Hanging Rock and My Brilliant Career.

As the Australian film industry celebrates a bumper year at the box-office 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-01/australian-film-industry-celebrates-best-year-in-two-decades/6660270>
 and a slate of acclaimed films, we ask if it’s currently going through a 
similar resurgence? Is this the new golden age of Australian film-making? As 
part of our ongoing film club series, Guardian Australia andAdelaide film 
festival <https://adelaidefilmfestival.org/> is hosting a screening of Storm 
Boy and a panel discussion around the topic.

Guardian Australia film critic Luke Buckmaster will be joined by Margaret 
Pomeranz and Michael Loebenstein, CEO of the National Film and Sound archive. 
Buckmaster is currently writing a book about the ‘lost wave’ of Australian 
cinema, asking why Australian audiences have ignored many of the best 
Australian films ever made.

 * Guardian Australia Film Club and Adelaide film festival’s screening of 
Storm Boy and panel discussion will take place at 11am on 25 October at the 
Mercury cinema in Adelaide.Click here
