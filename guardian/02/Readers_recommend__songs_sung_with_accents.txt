Slade’s ever-smiling frontman, Noddy Holder, at the height of the midlands 
glam rock band’s fame in the 1970s, went into a fashionable menswear boutique 
in London’s King’s Road to get a new outfit. Having chosen a brightly colourful 
stripy suit and an equally conspicuous pair of boots, the shop assistant then 
enquired of him: “Would you also like a kipper tie, sir?” “Ooh ta,” replied 
Holder. “Milk and two sugars, please.”

Accents do make the heart grow fonder. Old jokes and stereotyping aside. Above 
all, there seems to be something heart-warming and miraculous about how, for 
example in the UK, even if a digitally connected culture of American TV and 
global marketing tends to turn high streets and much else into general 
homogeneity, the diversity of dialect somehow endures.

No matter how great the voice, whether it’s Adele or Amy Winehouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse>, singing can have a bleaching 
effect on spoken accent in much popular song, with a common tendency towards 
the North American-sounding model. But this is not what we’re after this week. 
Instead your nominations should all be of songs where a discernible accent is 
audible, whether in general expressiveness or particular meaning. The songs in 
question could even refer to accents. But overall it would be best to go beyond 
simply name particular bands or frontmen, such as the Fall’s Mark E Smith, Ian 
Dury, or Arctic Monkeys’s Alex Turner, even though they may qualify. This week 
it is about the detail of a particular phrase or a moment in a song when the 
accent is inextricably linked - and adds to - the music.

Certain words and phrases may also place a performance in a particular region. 
In Manchester’s fish ‘n’ chip shops, for example, you might ask for a chip 
barm, (and always with gravy), as opposed to the more general chip butty. That 
may be just salt ‘n’ vinegar semantics, but why is that the word? A whole sea 
of other local vocabulary might also wash up, in other regions’ phraseology or 
songs for example, in Cornish sea shanties or in the Northumbrian burr of 
ballads affectionately dredged up by the Unthanks.

But above all, accents somehow provide meaning beyond the words they actually 
pronounce. Who can deny, for example, the humour and sense of relish that 
exists in hearingJohn Cooper Clarke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/john-cooper-clarke> utter a phrase that 
might seem bland from other lips? Or the magical delivery of each phrase of 
Richard Burton’s reading of Under Milk Wood? And would I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) 
carry the same popular distance if not belted out though the Leithian lilt of 
the Proclaimers’ Reid twins? And how could Stir It Up sound remotely as stylish 
if not with the Jamaican accent of Bob Marley?

The UK alone of course provides a wealth of timbres. And it is curious to 
wonder why, with sense of humour and culture so undeniably similar, and with 
only 30 miles apart, even the inner-city nasal Mancunian and Liverpudlian 
accents are so different. When I was 15 and having just finished my O-level 
exams, I set off with two school mates and walked the 286-milePennine Way 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jun/23/simon-armitage-poet-walking-pennine-way>
 from Edale in the Peak District to Kirk Yetholm just north of the Scottish 
Borders. Apart from the beautiful countryside and unpredictable weather, I 
remember noticing the extraordinary variety of incremental dialectical changes 
every few miles, from Derbyshire to Lancashire to Yorkshire to Northumberland. 
And there were many hybrids. So even 50 miles south of the border it was easy 
to pick out elements of Geordie, Northumberland, Cumbria and Scotland. Of 
course with any area there is no such thing as a one general Scottish accent. 
Travelling from the east to the harder, rainier west, the Glasgow accent brings 
its own kind of vitality and humour.

Q: What’s the difference between Bing Crosby and Walt Disney?
A: Bing sings, but Walt Disney.

So the entire palette of the UK, including Wales, Scotland and Northern 
Ireland, as well as the rest of Ireland, is at your disposal. But there is also 
a whole world out there. So your examples might include Australia or New 
Zealand. Note also the differences here, as highlighted, for example in the 
seriesFlight of the Conchords 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/flight-of-the-conchords>, where the 
phrase “He maybe did” gets confused with “He may be dead”.

 Flight of the Conchords. He maybe did? 
Regional accents of the US also count, particularly where southern accents 
lend a particular meaning or quality. And your suggestions may also take in 
German, Dutch, Swedish, Icelandic, French, Russian, Japanese or any other 
foreign accents. But please note, unless you can amply provide proof that a 
regional accent in a foreign language song is particular, and especially for 
the sake of this week’s guru, try to confine your suggestions largely to songs 
in the English language so it is discernible to all.

Perhaps the most interesting accents are those that mix different influences. 
The actor Christopher Walken’s rather unique delivery is marked by him 
stressing unexpected words, strange rises and pausing at odd moments. It might 
stem from a hybrid experience of growing up in Queens but having a Glaswegian 
mother and a German father. As he explains: “Both my parents had heavy accents, 
and so did everybody they knew. It’s a rhythm thing - people who speak English 
where they have to hesitate and think of the right word. And I think it rubbed 
off.” You might then throw into the mix any song performers who have an unusual 
accent delivery, which also might put the rhythmical accent in unexpected 
places.
