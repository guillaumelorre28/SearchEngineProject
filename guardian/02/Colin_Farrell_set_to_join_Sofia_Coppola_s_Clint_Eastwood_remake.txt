Colin Farrell is set to join the cast of Sofia Coppola’s remake of 1971 drama 
The Beguiled <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066819/>.

According to Variety 
<http://variety.com/2016/film/news/colin-farrell-eyes-sofia-coppolas-the-beguiled-remake-1201792411/>
, the actor is in talks to star alongside Nicole Kidman, Elle Fanning and 
Kirsten Dunst in the Lost in Translation director’s take on the civil war-set 
film that originally starred Clint Eastwood.

The plot centres on an injured soldier who takes refuge at an all-girls 
boarding school, where he becomes the object of sexual desire. The original was 
directed byDon Siegel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Siegel>, known for 
Dirty Harry and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and was a commercial misfire 
but a critical hit.

It will be Coppola’s first full-length film since The Bling Ring 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/04/the-bling-ring-review> in 2013. 
She had been attached to direct a live-action version of The Little Mermaid but
dropped out of the project 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/04/the-bling-ring-review> last year 
due to creative differences.

Farrell is coming off some of the best reviews of his career for Yorgos 
Lanthimos’ dystopian dating satireThe Lobster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/15/the-lobster-review->. He is set 
to reunite with the director for psychological thrillerThe Killing of a Sacred 
Deer
