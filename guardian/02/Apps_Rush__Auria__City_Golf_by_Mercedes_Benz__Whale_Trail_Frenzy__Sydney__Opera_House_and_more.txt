The latest brand grappling with augmented reality technology is Mercedes-Benz, 
with an AR golf game foriPhone <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> 
released for this week's The Open Championship (it's a sponsor). The idea: "Use 
your camera to set your pin against a real world setting" and "swing your 
device like an actual golf club to play through 27 par-3-style holes". There is 
absolutely no chance you will look ridiculous playing this in your local high 
street. No chance at all.
