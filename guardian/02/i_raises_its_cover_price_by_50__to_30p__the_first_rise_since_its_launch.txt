The i <https://www.theguardian.com/media/i> is to increase its cover price by 
50%. The Independent's little sister, which has been selling for 20p since its 
launch in October 2010, will cost 30p from next Monday.
 The last boast - i carries a 20p tag on today's front page 
In announcing the price rise to readers yesterday, i's editor, Oliver Duff, 
wrote: "Only a fool takes readers for granted... We know this won't be popular 
- who wants to pay more for anything? – but we hope that it is not a 
prohibitive increase for you, and that you can support us in this move."

The Saturday issue, which currently costs 30p, will be increased to 40p. 
Subscriptions will continue at £45 per year or £25 for six months.

Duff wrote: "i has prospered editorially... but it has become essential for 
us, after such a long freeze, to raise our cover price to meet overheads and 
further invest in our journalism."

i is published by Independent Print, a company ultimately owned by Alexander 
Lebedev <https://www.theguardian.com/media/alexander-lebedev> and his son, 
Evgeny.
