From apprentice prize draws to YouTube video applications and apprenticeship 
schemes, we've rounded up our Twitter followers' highlights from National 
Apprenticeship Week 2014.

All week we've been busy celebrating the campaign and spoke to seven 
apprentices about what they wish they'd known before starting 
<http://careers.theguardian.com/careers-blog/gallery/apprenticeships-all-you-need-to-know-before-getting-started>
, as well as recruiters to find outwhat they look for when choosing the best 
people for their apprenticeship schemes

Organisers of the week @Apprenticeships <https://twitter.com/Apprenticeships> 
announced employers have collectively pledged more than 20,000 apprenticeship 
vacancies. While the week's hashtag,#NAW2014 
<https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NAW2014&src=typd>, was even trending on 
Twitter.

So we asked our Twitter followers what they've enjoyed the most or learned 
this week, and put the best ones together below.
