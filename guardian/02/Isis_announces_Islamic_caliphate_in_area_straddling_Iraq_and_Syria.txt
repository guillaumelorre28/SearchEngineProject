Islamist militants have declared an Islamic "caliphate" 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/29/uk-syria-crisis-iraq-idUKKBN0F40SD20140629>
 in an area straddling Iraq and Syria, trumpeting the declaration in several 
videos.

One slick video, mostly in English 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzYF1AyFHgk>, features a bearded fighter with 
an AK-47 on his back, explaining the new caliphate.

"This is not the first border we will break, we will break other borders," a 
jihadist from theIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/jun/17/isis-what-is-sunni-islamic-state-mission-video>
 (Isis) warned in the video called End of Sykes-Picot, a reference to the
agreement between France and Britain that divided up the Ottoman empire 
territories <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement> after 
the first world war.

Later the fighter pledges that jihadists will free Palestine. "We are not here 
to replace an Arab cahoot with a western cahoot. Rather our jihad is more lofty 
and higher. We are fighting to make the word of Allah the highest," the 
spokesman said.

He is filmed showing abandoned Iraqi army badges and vehicles left by fleeing 
soldiers. "There is no army in the world that can withstand the soldiers ofIslam
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/islam>," he said.

The video features about a dozen men in a cell said to be captured troops and 
border police. A building, said to be a police station, is shown being blown 
up, as well as US-made Humvees captured from the border police. "Look how much 
America spends to fight Islam, and it ends up just being in our pockets," the 
spokesman taunted.

Isis, a breakaway group from al-Qaida, is notable for its hardline anti-Shia 
sectarianism, declaring Shia Muslims and other rivals as heretics that deserve 
death.

Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, an Isis spokesman, defined the Islamic state's 
territory as running from northern Syria to the Iraqi province of Diyala 
north-east of Baghdad, a vast stretch of land straddling the border that is 
already largely under Isis control. He also said that with the establishment of 
the caliphate, the group was changing its name to theIslamic State 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis>, dropping the mention of Iraq and the 
Levant.

"The legality of all emirates, groups, states and organisations becomes null 
by the expansion of the caliph's authority and the arrival of its troops to 
their areas," he said in an audio statement posted online, AP reported. "Listen 
to your caliph and obey him. Support your state, which grows every day."

Adnani said the group's chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/12/baghdadi-abu-bakr-iraq-isis-mosul-jihad>
, is the leader of the new caliphate and called on Muslims everywhere, not just 
those in areas under the organisation's control, to swear loyalty to him.

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/26/al-qaida-ayman-zawahiri-kidnapping-westerners>
, after al-Baghdadi ignored al-Zawahiri's demands that the Islamic State leave 
Syria.

Since the Ottoman collapse, Sunni Islam has lacked an internationally 
recognised clerical hierarchy and senior figures generally hold authority 
within a single country. Among the most prominent of these is the Grand Mufti 
of Egypt, whose spokesman dismissed the new caliphate in Iraq andSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> as an "illusion".

"What they called the Islamic caliphate is merely a response to the chaos 
which has happened inIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> as a direct

result of the inflammation of sectarian conflict in the entire region," 
Ibrahim Negm said in Cairo.

Another video called Breaking of the Borders showed Isis fighters killing 
Iraqi border guards, Reuters reported.

Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said 
Islamic State fighters crucified eight men said to be rival rebel fighters in 
the town square of Deir Hafer in Syria's Aleppo province on Saturday as a 
warning to others.

An analyst said the declaration of a caliphate by the Islamic State posed a 
huge challenge to al-Qaida.

"Put simply, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has declared war on al-Qaida," said Charles 
Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Centre. "While it is now 
inevitable that members and prominent supporters of al-Qaida and its affiliates 
will rapidly move to denounce Baghdadi and this announcement, it is the 
long-term implications that may prove more significant.

"Taken globally, the younger generation of the jihadist community is becoming 
more supportive of Isis, largely out of fealty to its slick and proven capacity 
for attaining rapid results through brutality."

The Islamic State's declaration came as the Iraqi government tries to claw 
back some of the territory gained by the jihadists and disaffected Sunnis.

On Sunday, Iraqi helicopter gunships struck suspected insurgent positions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/28/iraqi-forces-launch-attacks-tikrit>
 for a second consecutive day in the northern city of Tikrit, the predominantly 
Sunni hometown of former dictator Saddam Hussein. The insurgents appeared to 
have repelled the military's initial push and remain in control of the city.

Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has voiced support for Kurdish 
statehood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/29/israel-prime-minister-kurdish-independence>
, calling for the establishment of an independent Kurdistan as part of a 
broader alliance with moderate forces across the region. The US, however, has 
said Iraq should stand together in the face of Isis and other jihadists.
