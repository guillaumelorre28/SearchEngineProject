Angela Lansbury, to whom you pay deserved tribute (Lithe spirit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/16/dame-angela-lansbury-marks-90th-birthday-with-oscar-hammerstein-award>
, 16 October), came to lunch with me at the House of Commons last year during 
her West End run in Blithe Spirit, met the Speaker, and was shown round his 
apartments. She said it was her first visit to the Palace of Westminster since, 
as a teenager, she was entertained to tea on the terrace by her grandfather. 
She said she was as Labour as ever and gave me a kiss.

â€¢ So, 74% of the population identify more strongly with unselfish rather than 
selfish values (Opinion, 14 October 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/14/selfish-proof-ego-humans-inherently-good>
). Could this have anything to do with the fact that, in the general election, 
approximately 26% of the electorate voted for the Tories? I do hope not.
