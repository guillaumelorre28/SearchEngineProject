You know that feeling when you’re trying to give an inspirational speech but 
everyone takes their clothes off? No? Well, the Belarusian president does.

Alexander Lukashenko was talking about the importance of technology to the 
national economy <http://42.tut.by/501844> when he urged citizens “to get 
undressed and work till you sweat”.

But citizens took the words of their authoritarian president literally 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/lukashenko-president-for-life-belarus>
, and started posting pictures of themselves naked at work, using laptops and 
other office equipment to protect their dignity.

Thousands of Belarusians have now shared pictures on Twitter, Instagram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram> and Facebook using the 
hashtag #раздеватьсяиработать (#getnakedatwork).

“The president said this was necessary,” insisted one Instagram user.

Handymen and musicians got in on the action too: 

Others imagined what would happen if Lukashenko followed his own advice:


The president may not have been expecting his citizens to follow the advice so 
faithfully. He had been intending to encourage people to “develop themselves” 
–which sounds very similar to “get undressed” in Russian,according to the Mail 
online

The BBC reported <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-36643725> that the 
hashtag has now spread as far as the Baltic states and eastern Europe.
