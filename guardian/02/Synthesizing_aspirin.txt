This lovely video is especially for those of you who use aspirin for pain 
relief, as I am (I am recovering from surgery to repair multiple fractures to 
my elbow). In this video (below the jump), a chemist synthesizes aspirin -- 
acetylsalicylic acid -- in the lab whilst describing its chemistry, history and 
function in the body to relieve pain.
