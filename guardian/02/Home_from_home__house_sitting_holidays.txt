Feel at home on the range

Rusty is an all-American, 82-year-old cowboy with a trail-riding business in 
the desert near Lake Pleasant, Arizona. He and his wife need help shifting hay 
bales and doing maintenance in the stables. In return for a few hours' work per 
day, volunteers under the international Workaway scheme can horseride, swim in 
the lake and hike, with meals and camping included.

Other Workaway placements (there are dozens available around the world) 
include an "off-grid" creative retreat in the mountains of Almeria, Spain, 
where volunteers help with childcare, language practice, cooking, farming and 
art projects; and looking after tourists and farming at an eco-hostel in the US 
Virgin Islands in the Caribbean.

Be a host in South America

Fancy living in a cute house in Costa Rica with a pool and a veranda in the 
mountains of Heredia? All this will be yours (temporarily) if you sign up to 
this house-sit. Responsibilities include cleaning and maintenance, paying bills 
and hosting guests from time to time (the owner is turning the house into a 
B&B). You can revel in the views, visit San Jose, and even have your own mates 
to stay (on approval).

Escape to the South Pacific



If you thought Wwoofing (volunteering with World Wide Opportunities on Organic 
Farms) was all about planting mung beans in Wales, think again. On Tonga, in 
the South Pacific, a fishing lodge with log cabins for guests, plus a bar and 
restaurant catering for passing boat trade needs help in the garden and 
kitchen. This placement is for those who want to seriously chill – it's two 
hours to the nearest town – but who needs clubs and bars when there's kayaking, 
diving and swimming from the white sand beach on the doorstep?

Run away to sea

A week on the Norfolk Broads may not be enough to quell your desire for life 
on the waves, and getting hired as a crew member is the next best thing to 
owning your own Caribbean-bound yacht. Sailing, engineering or cooking 
qualifications and experience will massively ease your voyage towards the most 
attractive jobs, on the poshest boats and the best routes. Monthly salaries on 
a top-notch luxury yacht can exceed $3,500 for a deckhand or $2,000-$5,000 for 
a hostess.

Up for grabs down under

No one wants to make a flying visit to Oz, so find free accommodation to stay 
longer. Current house-sits include a three-acre estate near Montville, inland 
from Queensland's Sunshine Coast – yours in exchange for a spot of dog-walking 
and feeding horses and guinea fowl.
