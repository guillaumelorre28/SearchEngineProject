Finch among equals

This little bird is one of art history’s superstars, thanks to Théophile 
Thoré-Bürger, a 19th-century critic whose writing cemented the posthumous rep 
of its painter Carel Fabritius and fellow Delft School artist Vermeer. Most, 
however, will know it from Donna Tartt’s best-seller, though for much of the 
novel the painting is under wraps, more concept than object.

Flights of fancy

Fabritius employed masterful optical effects in the pursuit of everyday 
realism. The life-sized bird seems poised to seduce its audience into thinking 
it’s a real creature perched against a whitewashed wall.

Shine a light

At the same time, Fabritius draws our attention to the mechanics of this 
illusion. Showing his teacher Rembrandt’s influence, he conjures its body from 
a flurry of intentionally visible brushstrokes, in both gossamer dashes and 
thick daubs. The serene light however is his particular innovation.

Rare bird

The painting is very rare. Fabritius left few works, having died young in a 
gunpowder blast that decimated his corner of Delft; The Goldfinch was created 
in his final year.

The Goldfinch is at the Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, Fri to 18 Dec
