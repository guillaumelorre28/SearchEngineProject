Érik Lamela has said his rabona against Asteras Tripolis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/24/tottenham-pochettino-erik-lamela-goal-europa-league>
 was the best goal of his career, even though he scored asimilar effort in the 
youth ranks at River Plate <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoU0oCoG4w8>. The 
Argentinian forward hopes the wonder strike will prove to be a catalyst that 
sparks his Tottenham Hotspur career into life after a difficult start to life 
in north London.

Lamela scored the remarkable effort, his first of the night, with Spurs 
leading 1-0 against the Greek side in the Europa League, although his manager,
Mauricio Pochettino <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mauricio-pochettino>, 
showed no emotion as the ball arced into the net.

Spurs went on to win 5-1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/23/tottenham-asteras-tripoli-europa-league-match-report>
 and, although Harry Kane scored a hat-trick and ended up in goal following the 
sending-off of Hugo Lloris, the game will be remembered for Lamela’s 
brilliance. The former Roma forward struck the ball with his left foot in the 
29th minute, wrapping it around his standing right to make a pure and decisive 
contact.

 Erik Lamela’s wonder goal against Asteras Tripoli 
Lamela scored a rabona playing for River Plate as a youngster but when asked 
if the effort against Asteras was the best of his career, he said: “Yes, I 
think so. I’ve scored like that before, when I was playing in the junior sides 
at River Plate. It just happened in a flash.

“I wasn’t thinking about doing something like that, I just wanted to score and 
it was the most effective, comfortable way of making it happen. It’s something 
I’ll always remember because it’s something different from the other goals I’ve 
scored.”

Lamela struggled last season with injury following his record £30m move from 
Italy, but has shown signs of quality this year. He added: “The goal was 
important for me but also because I needed to score, any type of goal. I’m 
happy for the goal and the win. I hope to continue in this way but it’s just 
one game for me. I need to think about doing other things well and continuing 
to improve.”

 Lamela’srabona goal for River Plate. 
Kane was guilty of a woeful piece of goalkeeping in the closing stages, 
letting a 25-yard free-kick squirm through his arms and into the net, but the 
comical denouement to an enthralling match did not dampen the young forward’s 
spirits following a fine hat-trick.

“It was eventful to say the least,” Kane said. “It was great to get my first 
professional hat-trick, and to do it for Spurs as well. Probably letting in 
that goal was one to forget, but I am obviously happy with the evening. I 
actually fancied myself a bit [as a goalkeeper], to be honest. I was hoping it 
would hit the wall, to be totally honest, and when it came bobbling towards me 
I probably should have just kicked it away instead. I was a bit disappointed 
and felt bad for the defenders who had done well all night. But it is something 
that happens and something I will have to live with.”

On Lamela’s goal, he added: “It was unbelievable technique for him to pull 
that off. For him to even try it on the big stage. I am delighted for him 
because both his goals were top, top finishes. I probably won’t be trying it – 
I will leave it to him. Same as I will leave goalkeeping to Hugo and Michel 
[Vorm].”
