The latest addition to London's locations map, this is the "Harley Street" 
consulting room where Geoffrey Rush cured Colin Firth's Oscar-winning stammer 
in The King's Speech. Beneath the mouldering paintwork, it's actually a 
beautifully preserved Georgian townhouse – with a fine vaulted ceiling, 
generous leaded windows and distinctive curved skylights. The property was also 
used for Amy Winehouse's Rehab video, not to mention the occasional gay porn 
film – though that attracts fewer pilgrims. There's no easy way to get in, but 
it's often hired for corporate functions, so you've got options.

Whatever David Hemmings did or didn't see through his camera in
Antonioni's Swinging London milestone, here's where he saw it, or
didn't. It doesn't quite look the same since Antonioni apparently had
the paths and even the grass painted, and built false houses in the
background. You can retrace Hemmings' footsteps up to the fateful
clearing where he snaps Vanessa Redgrave in a clandestine clinch, then
back down the steps where she confronts him. "You can't photograph
people like that … This is a public place, everyone has the right to be
left in peace," she says, betraying the film's bygone intrusion-free
era. The tennis courts where the students have their game of imaginary
tennis are still there, too.

London's oldest public bathhouse is a soothing place to visit even if you're 
not a movie buff, though you might want to erase from your memory its 15 
minutes of excruciating fame in David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises. "It's a 
good place for business meetings," a Chechen gangster tells Mortensen, "because 
you can see what tattoos a man has." Not such a good place to be assaulted by 
two knife-wielding Russian thugs when you're naked, mind. If you weren't 
wincing from the violence, you might have had time to appreciate the 
well-appointed steam rooms and handsome deco tiling. It's currently being 
refurbished, but will open to the public again in May 2012.

South Kensington doesn't look quite so posh from Catherine Deneuve's 
(admittedly skewed) perspective in Roman Polanski's 1965 thriller. She lives 
and works and gets ogled by workmen around the area in the movie, but the best 
moment is seeing the future French diva confronted with the decidedly 
unglamorous local cuisine when she visits Dino's, next to the tube station. 
"You can't eat stuff like this. Come on, I'll take you to Wheeler's," says her 
suitor John Fraser, eyeing her battered cod and chips. The restaurant's 
virtually unchanged since – so the food can't be bad.

Everyone knows Gotham City is in America, right? In most of Christopher 
Nolan's two Batman movies, Chicago is the doppelganger for the exterior shots 
of the city, but many of the locations are actually closer to home. The Gotham 
City State Courts, for example, is the Jewelers Building in downtown Chicago on 
the outside, but inside, it's the art deco lobby of Senate House, the 
University of London's handsome 1930s building in Bloomsbury. It's here that 
Christian Bale's plan to avenge the death of his parents is pre-empted, when 
the killer, "Joe Chill", is gunned down by Tom Wilkinson's hoods.

The beautiful Georgian Chandos House, off Wimpole Street, fits the bill 
perfectly as Imelda Staunton and Hugh Laurie's London pad in Ang Lee's Austen 
drama par excellence. They probably didn't need to change a thing inside, as 
the restored interiors are just as well-preserved as the outside. It's here 
that Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet have their tearful showdown after learning 
of Hugh Grant's engagement – if you weren't too distracted by the tasteful 
paint colours and antique furnishings. It's available for hire, so if you 
really love the film, you could even have your wedding here.

Home to one of the most illustrious studios in British cinema, Ealing was 
already pretty well-established on the movie map (the studio is still in 
operation). But Carey Mulligan's rendition of Lynn Barber's 1960s coming of age 
showed us the full suburban splendour of the area – even if it was standing in 
for Twickenham. Mulligan's house is on Carbery Avenue, and her school is the 
Japanese School on Creffield Road, while her local shops are at St John's 
Parade – dressed up for the period. Surprisingly, the cafe where she brushes 
off her schoolboy would-be suitor is practically unchanged.

Crouch End was such a nice place to live before the zombie infestation brought 
property prices down. Still, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost give you a fine guided 
tour of the area – albeit with marauding undead in shuffling pursuit. From 
their flat on Nelson Road, the newsagent really is just round the corner, on 
Weston Park. It's a bit more of a walk to their "local", The Winchester, 
however: it's several miles away, south of the river in New Cross (Duke Of 
Albany, on Monson Road).

Thamesmead in south-east London, is one of the best movie sites in the city 
and a grim day out for all the family. Stanley Kubrick didn't have to look far 
for futuristically dystopian locations in the early 1970s, and this brutalist 
London landscape is pretty much as he left it. Stroll along the "Flat Block 
Marina" (Southmere Lake) beside which Malcolm McDowell tolchucked his upstart 
droogs, and look for the Tavy Bridge Centre, which doubled as McDowell's 
apartment. If you're looking for the famous underpass where they assault the 
tramp, though, it's over in Wandsworth.

You could go and view the trolley protruding from the wall at "Platform 9¾" in 
King's Cross Station for your dose of Potter tourism, but a more pleasant stop 
on the trail is the City of London's beautiful Victorian Leadenhall Market. The 
curved-fronted entrance to the Leaky Cauldron is at 42 Bull's Head Passage – 
it's actually an optician's. Then the secret "Diagon Alley" was filmed in the 
market itself, though being a muggle, you might not recognise it as such. If 
you're disappointed that there's no Eeylops Owl Emporium or Quality Quidditch 
Supplies, you can always have a pint in The Lamb, where John Wayne started a 
bar-room brawl in the 1975 film Brannigan.
