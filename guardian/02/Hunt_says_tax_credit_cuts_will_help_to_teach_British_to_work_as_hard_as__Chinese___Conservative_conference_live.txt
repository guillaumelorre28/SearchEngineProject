Summary

 * Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has said British people will learn how 
to work as hard as the Chinese and Americans because the Conservatives have cut 
the money people can make from tax credits. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/05/hunt-tax-credit-cuts-make-britons-work-like-chinese-or-americans>
 AsRowena Mason reports, speaking at a fringe meeting at the Conservative party 
conference, Hunt strayed from his brief to defend the government’s tax credit 
cuts of up to £1,300 for some of the poorest workers in the UK. Hunt told his 
audience that reducing tax credits was not just about saving money, and when 
asked whether the pace of the cuts should be slowed, he said: “No. We have to 
proceed with these tax-credit changes because they are a very important 
cultural signal. My wife is Chinese. We want this to be one of the most 
successful countries in the world in 20, 30, 40 years’ time. There’s a pretty 
difficult question that we have to answer, which is essentially: are we going 
to be a country which is prepared to work hard in the way that Asian economies 
are prepared to work hard, in the way that Americans are prepared to work hard? 
And that is about creating a culture where work is at the heart of our success.”
 * George Osborne has announced the biggest transfer of power from central to 
local government in recent history by allowing councils to retain all the money 
they raise from business rates – a total of £26bn.

 * Osborne has announced that the public will be offered cut-price shares in 
Lloyds Banking Group as the government moves to complete the sale of its stake 
in the bailed-out bank more than eight years after the financial crisis.

 * John Whittingdale, the culture secretary, has confirmed that the BBC will 
be stripped of its power to adjudicate on allegations of political bias in its 
coverage.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

It’s unfair to pick on a Freudian slip, especially one by a rather promising 
new MP, so apologies toLucy Frazer. But when she ended her remarks to a Policy 
Exchange fringe meeting on low income squeezed middle voters by saying the 
Tories could win many victories ‘if we see that people are on our side’ (I 
suspect she meant ‘if people see we are on their side’) she inadvertently put 
her finger on the problem in Manchester.

The Tories know they have a historic opportunity to reach C2 voters who don’t 
like what Jeremy Corbyn has to say on defence or immigration but are suspicious 
of Tory economic policy. What they’ve not quite grasped is that announcing 
you’re on working people’s side, while staying in your own comfort zone, isn’t 
enough; you have to visibly move towards them or it looks like you don’t mean 
it. With tax credit cuts for those people looming, the policy hasn’t yet caught 
up with the new political positioning.

George Osborne's speech - A reading list

Here are three good articles about George Osborne’s speech.

 * George Eaton at the Staggers says Labour should take George Osborne’s 
attempts to win over Labour-leaning voters seriously. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2015/10/george-osborne-s-love-bombing-labour-voters-should-terrify-opposition>
It would be an error for Labour to merely dismiss this as empty rhetoric. 
Rather, it must craft a positive and relevant vision that overpowers Osborne’s. 
And as he woos the 9.3 million who voted Labour, it should ponder what it is 
doing to appeal to the two million more who voted Conservative. As Osborne 
showed today, a good start is to stop insulting them.

 * Jeremy Cliffe at the Economist says Osborne’s speech reveals his thinking 
about how Britain is changing. 
<http://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2015/10/george-osborne?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/the_metropolitan_line>
What Mr Osborne is saying, then, is: allow the failing places to fail, but 
help people move to the boomtowns. Mothball Wolverhampton, Blackpool and Great 
Yarmouth and make it easier for Leeds, Milton Keynes and Cambridge (not to 
mention London and Manchester) to build bypasses, new railway stations, housing 
estates, tramlinks and cycle lanes. Why? Britain’s strength lies in city-based 
clusters of service industries, many employing university graduates; such 
places, in other words, possess the alchemical mix that allows them to capture 
the advantages of globalisation. Where places are failing it is usually because 
they are too small, too out of the way or too low-skilled. In government 
Labour’s answer was to let the boomtowns boom, cream off the benefit in taxes 
and pass it down to places without an invite to the party. Mr Osborne’s answer 
is different: work with the grain of economic change, not against it. Pump up 
the places doing well and help people in the places doing less well to relocate 
there and throw themselves into the forwards churn of globalisation, rather 
than merely compensating them for it. This carries the additional benefit of 
raising the national growth rate (research suggests that the biggest single 
reason for the gap in GDP per capita between America and Europe is that the 
former has more big cities); in an interview withProspect, Jim O’Neill, a 
former banker now in the chancellor’s ministerial team, estimated that focusing 
on the big cities would “translate into an additional 0.2 per cent of GDP 
growth on average per year up to 2030.” Much of the broader thinking behind the 
move is articulatedin this paper from Policy Exchange 
<http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/cities-unlimited> 
(Mr Osborne’s favourite think-tank) in 2008.

 * Larry Elliott has a Q&A on Osborne’s business rates decentralisation.

Here is some more reaction to George Osborne’s business rates decentralisation 
announcement.

From Gary Porter, chair of the Local Government Association

Today’s announcement by the chancellor is great news for councils and shows 
that the Government has listened to the arguments set out by local government. 
The LGA has long-argued that the current system of business rates needed reform 
so councils could effectively support small businesses and boost high streets.

 Councils have been hugely restricted in their ability to introduce local 
discounts with government setting the charge and keeping half of business rates 
income. With greater local control, councils will have flexibility to reduce 
business rates for the types of shops and businesses that residents want in 
their high streets and neighbourhoods.

From Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the Local Government Information 
Unitthinktank

Today George Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> has 
proved his credentials as a devolutionary chancellor. Decentralising business 
rates could mean greater independence for councils across the country, the 
opportunity for many of them to unleash their economic potential locally. Until 
very recently, Treasury officials were briefing that decentralising business 
rates was out of the question, so this represents a huge step towards a more 
localised tax system in line with other developed economies.

question was phrased differently and the figure was 37%.

Excluding don’t knows, remain are on 52% and leave on 48%.

Liz Truss, the environment secretary, said in her speech to the conference 
that free markets help to preserve the environment.

 It’s free markets that enable people to pursue their dreams and create 
prosperity.

 It’s access to information and free speech that helps us understand the world 
and make progress.

 Where people don’t have these freedoms, we have seen the greatest declines in 
the natural world.

 With species driven to extinction and habitats despoiled.

 And as countries become wealthier, they want to invest in the environment, 
planting trees, cleaning up rivers and tackling air pollution.

 I believe that a strong economy and a healthy environment go hand in hand.

Hunt suggests people on tax credits lack dignity and self-respect

Rowena Mason

Here’s another quote from the Jeremy Hunt fringe meeting. He suggested that 
those reliant on tax credits and benefits lack dignity and self-respect.

Dignity is not just about how much money you have got ... Officially children 
are growing up in poverty if there is an income in that family of less than 
£16,500. What theConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> say is how that £16,500 is 
earned matters. It matters if you are earning that yourself, because if you are 
earning it yourself you are independent and that is the first step towards 
self-respect. If that £16,500 is either a high proportion or entirely through 
the benefit system you are trapped. It is about pathways to work, pathways to 
independence. It is about creating a pathway to independence, self-respect and 
dignity.

 * Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has said British people will learn how 
to work as hard as the Chinese and Americans because the Conservatives have cut 
the money people can make from tax credits. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/05/hunt-tax-credit-cuts-make-britons-work-like-chinese-or-americans>
 AsRowena Mason reports, speaking at a fringe meeting at the Conservative party 
conference, Hunt strayed from his brief to defend the government’s tax credit 
cuts of up to £1,300 for some of the poorest workers in the UK. Hunt told his 
audience that reducing tax credits was not just about saving money, and when 
asked whether the pace of the cuts should be slowed, he said: “No. We have to 
proceed with these tax-credit changes because they are a very important 
cultural signal. My wife is Chinese. We want this to be one of the most 
successful countries in the world in 20, 30, 40 years’ time. There’s a pretty 
difficult question that we have to answer, which is essentially: are we going 
to be a country which is prepared to work hard in the way that Asian economies 
are prepared to work hard, in the way that Americans are prepared to work hard? 
And that is about creating a culture where work is at the heart of our success.”
 * George Osborne has announced the biggest transfer of power from central to

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
It’s unfair to pick on a Freudian slip, especially one by a rather promising 
new MP, so apologies toLucy Frazer. But when she ended her remarks to a Policy 
Exchange fringe meeting on low income squeezed middle voters by saying the 
Tories could win many victories ‘if we see that people are on our side’ (I 
suspect she meant ‘if people see we are on their side’) she inadvertently put 
her finger on the problem in Manchester.

The Tories know they have a historic opportunity to reach C2 voters who don’t 
like what Jeremy Corbyn has to say on defence or immigration but are suspicious 
of Tory economic policy. What they’ve not quite grasped is that announcing 
you’re on working people’s side, while staying in your own comfort zone, isn’t 
enough; you have to visibly move towards them or it looks like you don’t mean 
it. With tax credit cuts for those people looming, the policy hasn’t yet caught 
up with the new political positioning.
 
Here are three good articles about George Osborne’s speech.

 * George Eaton at the Staggers says Labour should take George Osborne’s 
attempts to win over Labour-leaning voters seriously. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2015/10/george-osborne-s-love-bombing-labour-voters-should-terrify-opposition>
It would be an error for Labour to merely dismiss this as empty rhetoric. 
Rather, it must craft a positive and relevant vision that overpowers Osborne’s. 
And as he woos the 9.3 million who voted Labour, it should ponder what it is 
doing to appeal to the two million more who voted Conservative. As Osborne 
showed today, a good start is to stop insulting them.

 * Jeremy Cliffe at the Economist says Osborne’s speech reveals his thinking 
about how Britain is changing.

What Mr Osborne is saying, then, is: allow the failing places to fail, but 
help people move to the boomtowns. Mothball Wolverhampton, Blackpool and Great 
Yarmouth and make it easier for Leeds, Milton Keynes and Cambridge (not to 
mention London and Manchester) to build bypasses, new railway stations, housing 
estates, tramlinks and cycle lanes. Why? Britain’s strength lies in city-based 
clusters of service industries, many employing university graduates; such 
places, in other words, possess the alchemical mix that allows them to capture 
the advantages of globalisation. Where places are failing it is usually because 
they are too small, too out of the way or too low-skilled. In government 
Labour’s answer was to let the boomtowns boom, cream off the benefit in taxes 
and pass it down to places without an invite to the party. Mr Osborne’s answer 
is different: work with the grain of economic change, not against it. Pump up 
the places doing well and help people in the places doing less well to relocate 
there and throw themselves into the forwards churn of globalisation, rather 
than merely compensating them for it. This carries the additional benefit of 
raising the national growth rate (research suggests that the biggest single 
reason for the gap in GDP per capita between America and Europe is that the 
former has more big cities); in an interview withProspect, Jim O’Neill, a 
former banker now in the chancellor’s ministerial team, estimated that focusing 
on the big cities would “translate into an additional 0.2 per cent of GDP 
growth on average per year up to 2030.” Much of the broader thinking behind the 
move is articulatedin this paper from Policy Exchange 
<http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/cities-unlimited> 
(Mr Osborne’s favourite think-tank) in 2008.

In her speech to the conference this afternoon Amber Rudd, the energy 
secretary, announced that the government will work with Ofgem and Citizens 
Advice to strengthen the Energy Ombudsman so that it can address systemic 
problems in the energy industry, as well as the individual complaints it deals 
with now.
 
Here is some more reaction to George Osborne’s business rates decentralisation 
announcement.

From Gary Porter, chair of the Local Government Association

Today’s announcement by the chancellor is great news for councils and shows 
that the Government has listened to the arguments set out by local government. 
The LGA has long-argued that the current system of business rates needed reform 
so councils could effectively support small businesses and boost high streets.

 Councils have been hugely restricted in their ability to introduce local 
discounts with government setting the charge and keeping half of business rates 
income. With greater local control, councils will have flexibility to reduce 
business rates for the types of shops and businesses that residents want in 
their high streets and neighbourhoods.

From Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the Local Government Information 
Unitthinktank

Today George Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> has 
proved his credentials as a devolutionary chancellor. Decentralising business 
rates could mean greater independence for councils across the country, the 
opportunity for many of them to unleash their economic potential locally. Until 
very recently, Treasury officials were briefing that decentralising business 
rates was out of the question, so this represents a huge step towards a more 
localised tax system in line with other developed economies.
 
ICM has released some new polling figures on EU membership. The results are:

Remain: 42%

Leave: 38%

Don’t know: 20%

Apparently this is the lowest figure for remain since December 2013, when the 
question was phrased differently and the figure was 37%.

Excluding don’t knows, remain are on 52% and leave on 48%.
 
Liz Truss, the environment secretary, said in her speech to the conference 
that free markets help to preserve the environment.

 It’s free markets that enable people to pursue their dreams and create 
prosperity.

 It’s access to information and free speech that helps us understand the world 
and make progress.

 Where people don’t have these freedoms, we have seen the greatest declines in 
the natural world.

 With species driven to extinction and habitats despoiled.

 And as countries become wealthier, they want to invest in the environment, 
planting trees, cleaning up rivers and tackling air pollution.

 I believe that a strong economy and a healthy environment go hand in hand.

Here’s another quote from the Jeremy Hunt fringe meeting. He suggested that 
those reliant on tax credits and benefits lack dignity and self-respect.

Dignity is not just about how much money you have got ... Officially children 
are growing up in poverty if there is an income in that family of less than 
£16,500. What theConservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> say is how that £16,500 is 
earned matters. It matters if you are earning that yourself, because if you are 
earning it yourself you are independent and that is the first step towards 
self-respect. If that £16,500 is either a high proportion or entirely through 
the benefit system you are trapped. It is about pathways to work, pathways to 
independence. It is about creating a pathway to independence, self-respect and 
dignity.
