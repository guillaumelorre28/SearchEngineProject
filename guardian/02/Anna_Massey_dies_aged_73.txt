The veteran actor Anna Massey <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/anna-massey>
 has died at the age of 73, her agent said.

Massey won a string of awards for her stage and TV roles, including a Bafta 
for her performance as a lonely spinster in the 1986 TV adaptation of Hotel du 
Lac.

Her agent said in a statement: "Actress Anna Massey CBE passed away peacefully 
on Sunday 3rd July, with her husband and son by her side.

"She will be remembered as a loving wife and mother, a cherished grandmother, 
a generous colleague and, always, a consummate professional. She will be 
greatly missed."

Massey had been suffering from cancer, her agent said.

Her film work included roles in Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy, Possession with 
Gwyneth Paltrow and an adaptation of The Importance Of Being Earnest.

Massey was well-known for her supporting roles, often playing a spurned or 
repressed maiden aunt. She received a CBE for services to drama at Buckingham 
Palace in 2005.

Divorced from the late actor Jeremy Brett, she was alone for 27 years until 
she met the Russian scientist Uri Andres at a dinner party and married him 
three months later.

Massey's TV period dramas included Tess Of The D'Urbervilles in 2008, Oliver 
Twist in 2007, and the BBC's version of Anthony Trollope's He Knew He Was Right 
in 2004.

Most recently, she appeared in Poirot and Midsomer Murders in 2009.

In 2006, she played Baroness Thatcher in the TV film Pinochet In Suburbia.

Massey was born into the business â€“ both of her parents were actors and her 
godfather was the veteran director John Ford.
