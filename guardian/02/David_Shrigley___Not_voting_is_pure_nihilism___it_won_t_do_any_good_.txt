If you take the weather out of the equation, Glasgow is a really good place to 
live. I lived there until last month and I’ve just moved to Devon. Glasgow was, 
and probably still is, a really good place to be a young artist because it’s 
cheap enough to live, so you can get things done. It felt as if Glasgow was a 
significant place in the art world in a way that other provincial cities in 
Britain aren’t.

Glasgow doesn’t have the problems of London – having to commute and spend all 
your money on rent. Culturally, it’s an interesting place and it has all those 
Victorian tenements which are really nice spaces to live in – big windows, big 
doors, albeit a bit chilly. I grew up in the Midlands which could be anywhere 
in the UK but Glasgow has a distinctive style about it in its residential 
architecture.

Sometimes you just don’t get a summer in Glasgow. Now we live in East Devon 
and they moan about the weather here but me and my wife laugh because it’s so 
much warmer – particularly in the summer.

We used to watch River Cottage on the telly and thought: “Wow, where’s that? 
Why don’t we go there?!” We paid off the mortgage on our flat in Glasgow and, 
as we don’t have any kids, we have a few more financial options. We found a 
place that’s rural, near the sea and has a dog-friendly beach for our dog. 
There are 200 people in our village, all of whom we know now.

We’re all getting a lot older as a population and that makes a huge difference 
to the economy of the country and to the way that social services and theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> function. Ukip would have us believe 
it’s all down to immigrants but obviously it isn’t, because most of those 
people are of working age and are going to pay tax for a long time. I suffer 
from chronic anxiety about quite irrational things but the real thing that’s 
most likely to have an impact on my life in the near future is having to look 
after my parents and thinking about what care I’ll need to provide.

Having been a very political year for those of us in Scotland, you have cause 
to consider what politics is. That was the first time in my life where it 
really felt like it made a difference, at least since maybe 1997. It made me 
think about the nature of politics and politicians and how everybody is arguing 
a corner and suggesting policy, but they’d all be a lot better off if there 
were no political parties and they were all independents, because then they 
could at least be honest about things that they agree upon. But I think it’s 
very important still to vote. I don’t agree with someone like Russell Brand who 
advocates not voting – it’s pure nihilism, it’s not going to do any good.

My choice is to be optimistic about what lies ahead for Britain. It’s not 
really based on anything, but then again, why be pessimistic if you have the 
choice?

I live between Somerset and London, but call Somerset home – I love the open 
spaces and how I can disappear there. But the thing I love about it is also the 
thing I like least: it can get too lonely for me. I’m a social person – I love 
work and interacting with other people, which is why I’m glad to have London – 
I enjoy its vibrancy.

Something rather ugly boiling in Britain is this widening gap between the rich 
and poor and the accompanying dialogue – there’s a lot of rhetoric widening the 
gulf. Sometimes when I try to voice an opinion, the response is: “What would 
you know – you’re wealthy?” But I live in the world; I care about society. I 
think it’s a dangerous road because everybody ends up resenting everybody else 
– that’s not a great place for a country to be in.

The impact we’re having on the environment makes me shudder; I’m really 
worried about how we’re burdening our next generation. We’re spending their 
money, charging them to be educated and burning their fuels without any thought 
of how they’re going to deal with it all. We have to show the next generation 
more respect and help them to get out of the hole we’ve got them into.

I’ve met some very good politicians and it must be awful being in an 
environment where there’s a presumption that you’re dishonest and ripping 
people off. I find if you don’t trust somebody, they live up to that 
expectation. We should trust that they’re actually working on our side – and 
they should earn that trust.

The institutions we most trust are the ones we’re always having a pop at – 
we’re always complaining about the NHS, yet we maintain the belief that it will 
be there for us. In my experience, they are there for us. In the times I’ve 
been in an emergency, they’ve been there and they’ve been phenomenal.

What happens in Britain’s future is entirely up to us. Flexibility will be one 
of the most important things for individuals and countries to survive and in 
Britain we’re flexible: we’re great innovators. We have to get away from this 
almost colonial opinion that “we’re a big part of the world” – we’re really 
quite tiny. You aren’t respected for your size, you’re respected for what you 
say and do – we should use our voice well.

 Gemma Cairney: ‘Everything feels tough. People feel despondent and let down.’

I’ve lived in east London for the last 10 years and I love that the city is 
such a big mishmash of addictive yet exhausting experiences. But sometimes I 
feel as though all these incredible things are dangled in your face like a 
distant carrot, but getting anywhere is insane: getting from east to west can 
take up to three hours.

The rise in property prices has added a twinge of gloom and desperation that 
doesn’t match the energy and vibrancy of what London should be.

I think the biggest issue in politics is that people feel despondent and let 
down, everything feels tough. We’re bombarded with stats and figures and 
doom-mongering from people on the telly who we can’t connect with, but the 
decisions made by the people in charge affect our day-to-day wellbeing. I think 
the language and presence of politicians could be mixed up a little bit. It 
would be really good to see people like me or the people I know reflected. I 
think that would make me naturally more inclined to trust politicians.

For me, the most difficult thing is to switch off. I love working on many 
projects at once, but sometimes it’s a bit of a stretch, particularly as I get 
up at 3am to do early breakfast on Radio 1. Sometimes you get to the point in 
the middle of a week and you feel fearful of your mind. I think work pressures 
are very much attached to health.

Years ago I worked on a documentary about the after-effects of the riots and 
was troubled by the breakdown of relationships between the police and many 
young people across the country. I went to a workshop in Tottenham held by 
someone who had been stopped and searched his whole life and wanted to teach 
some of the younger people how to act in this situation. When I told them that 
I’d never been stopped and searched everybody’s jaw dropped – it happens to 
them so regularly just because of the way they look or carry themselves, even 
though most of them are totally law-abiding, decent, brilliant people. That was 
quite upsetting to discover.

it.’ Photograph: Geraint Lewis/Rex Shutterstock

I have lived in rural Ceredigion, six miles from the sea, for 30 years. It is 
beautiful, a classless, deeply rooted community proud of its bilingual literary 
culture. Neighbours here watch out for one another in an old-fashioned way. We 
pay for the beauty of the landscape by being completely dependent on the car. I 
was born in Cardiff and we still have family there and a “pad”. I love its 
friendly, multiracial, talkative people. If I could no longer manage country 
life I would return to my home city.

Britain is more divided than I ever remember it. It feels less like a country, 
more like a fractured society. The risk is that racism, religious bigotry, 
selfishness, class and corporate greed will destroy for ever that old, easy, 
get-along-with-each-other friendliness, where people’s differences could be 
battled out on the rugby field or somewhere.

Climate change is the biggest worry in my life – nothing personal compares 
with it. When I was young it was fear of nuclear war that kept me awake.

No institution is to be trusted. Not the police, not universities. An 
institution is as good as the people who run it and the way it is governed. At 
my happy school, we saw no bullying because we had the best head teacher in the 
world, loving, watchful and organised. Politicians have reduced language to 
hollow mantra. My favourite institutions are the NHS and the BBC, but I trust 
only individuals – my postman, the kind policeman, the good nurse.

We have to hope that things will improve because so many good people are angry 
enough to make things change, and the time has surely come for the young to 
wake up, stand up, think, argue, wave a banner – and VOTE.

Manchester has a real sense of community. It’s always good to knock about 
there and be with the people you’ve been friends with a long time.

Manchester’s still run by the old guard and by that I mean the people who talk 
about what was good in the Haçienda days. We don’t live in those days any more 
– it’s 2015. That can’t be the only story we’re hearing – there are new things 
going on, new underground raves, but there needs to be more money going into 
making the arts and culture more prominent, so people can get involved more 
easily.

People are disillusioned with our leaders. There’s no connection – they’re all 
Eton choirboys. Homes for people, making sure the elderly are looked after and 
that we’re looking after anyone who has problems with their health should be at 
the top of the agenda, but they’re not. I just want people to break down back 
to the fundamentals. Looking after people should always be No 1, but it seems 
like that’s just a dream.

There is an issue between the police and young black males in the UK, as much 
as people would love to say that there isn’t. One time I was walking through 
Manchester city centre, it was as busy as it gets, and the police came running 
round the corner and must have thought I’d taken something from a shop because 
then I had my hands up on the wall and no idea what was going on. Then they 
just shrugged me off and acted like nothing had happened. I was really young, 
about 15, and when you have those moments, your trust has gone.

There is something great about Britain, but we need new ideas. The system 
doesn’t really work. It might be OK for people who are financially all right, 
but I think about the people on the streets, the average folk scraping money 
together, the single mother who’s been told that her benefits have been cut.

I live in London now. The air quality is very poor and I have allergies for 
the first time in my life. My specific neighbourhood has a ferocious community 
spirit and that’s great. Still, I would rather live in Glasgow, or Nairn.

Britain today is afflicted by a kind of perfect storm of problems. Our access 
to accurate and timely information is poor. This has allowed our political 
class to degrade almost completely. Pain, hardship and waste are more and more 
acceptable. Activities that don’t make a profit are presented as laughable 
indulgences. Caring for the sick, protecting children, ensuring we have 
breathable air and potable water, carrying out effective work for a fair charge 
– we are intended to find these things bizarre.

The state of things is worrying, but worry is a waste of my energy. It also 
allows those inadvertently and deliberately making my country miserable, 
punitive and ugly to dominate my interior state. I’d rather not give vandals 
and spivs power over my emotions, so I try to keep my mind clear.

I’m getting older and the savage environment we’ll create in the next decade 
or two will make that tough. The NHS has, in many areas, passed beyond the 
point where it can operate effectively. Like all enterprises that made our 
lives simpler, happier and cheaper, it has suffered from decades of attack. My 
NHS experiences have either been wonderful or deeply disappointing, depending 
on whether the individuals treating me were still fighting a broken system or 
had already burnt out.

I now have private health insurance – it disgusts me that such a thing should 
be necessary or that I should have sunk so low.

I hope that the energy and ingenuity of our newer and most harshly punished 
generations can break through and save us. In a way, we don’t deserve saving – 
we’ve been willing to forget every lesson history could have taught us about 
maintaining a functional, sustainable civil society. Then again, one of those 
forgotten lessons is that everyone is worth saving.

I love London because it is so diverse and busy and so many cities in one – 
you can meet people from all over the world. I think it’s a great advert for 
how people could live together all over the world. Where I live in Lambeth is a 
mixed area so you see lots of different aspects of life there and you don’t get 
too cocooned, which I think it’s very easy to do when you are a privileged 
professional.

The inequality of London is something that I like least, because you’ve got 
some of the wealthiest people in the world, but that extreme inequality between 
the City of London and some of the other people making their money there is 
something that’s quite difficult to stomach sometimes. I hate the fact that for 
the first time in my life I see the necessity for a food bank across the road 
from me in Lambeth.

One of the great things about my job is that it gets me up and down and left 
and right around the country. Manchester is a city I’ve got to know a bit 
recently. There’s a youthful optimism, a radicalism about it. And let’s be 
honest, there is a particular warmth in the north. Americans will talk to you 
about their perceptions of the British and that stiff-upper-lip stereotype, but 
that isn’t Britain or even England – it’s class-ridden, old-fashioned.

Can Britain wake up to the fact that this is a shrinking, interconnected 
planet and that the answer to the world’s challenges and opportunities is more 
interconnectedness, not less? The rise of xenophobia, parochialism, Little 
England – it comes from fear, but it also probably comes from a great country 
that never quite got over the end of empire.

I have a son who’s nearly 13, so when I’m worried about the future of Britain, 
I’m thinking about the kind of society that he’s going to inherit. What will it 
be like for kids coming out of college in 10 years’ time? Will there be work? 
And will there be work for people who don’t just want to make money in the City 
but want to teach, or study, or do caring professions, or do art? I worry about 
that. I’m not naive, I do worry about security too. I just see the answers as 
different to politicians who think clamping down on civil liberties is the way 
to make a safer society.

I have met decent politicians in all the main parties who are prepared to 
stand on principle and to take unpopular positions and defend the vulnerable. 
We do have some great institutions but we need to cherish and scrutinise them a 
bit more – we need the kinds of checks and balances that some members of those 
elites don’t like very much.

I live in Finedon – it’s either a big village or a small town, no one’s ever 
sure. It’s a very distinctive place with a very idiosyncratic character. It’s 
big enough for there to be a lot going on and small enough for everyone to know 
everybody, and it retains the virtues of an old-fashioned community – built 
around the church, cricket club, the school – that make it a very good place to 
be.

I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else. There’s a place my partner David and I 
go every year in Scotland on the Kintyre peninsula, which is about as remote as 
you can get without leaving Earth’s orbit. I would like to spend more time 
there because it’s very quiet, it’s very beautiful, you’re surrounded by 
nature, and as you look out across Kilbrannan Sound you can see schools of 
porpoises go past. There are deer, too. Up there, you have no sense of there 
really being anything going on at all apart from a distant light chucking up 
from Glasgow. It’s beautiful.

Spiritual hunger is the single biggest issue affecting Britain today. I think 
we know very well the effect of being deprived of love, food, shelter. I think 
we sometimes forget that we are also spiritual creatures and if we are deprived 
of a spirituality then the important parts of us can start to wither.

The nature of my job is to spend a lot of time around people who are in health 
crises of one kind or another, and it has taught me to be highly conscious of 
the blessings of reasonable health. I’ve got a bicycle and sometimes cycle 
around the parish, a bit like Miss Marple. But I hate that when I get up in the 
morning about a second later my paunch follows.

We’ve got very hardworking constituency MPs and I wish people would see more 
of that. I can quite understand how your view of politics might be soured when 
you see the way political leaders behave, particularly when they’re having to 
interact with the media, but I’m very impressed on the whole by local 
politicians.

I love our great public sector institutions and hate seeing them buckle, which 
they’re doing a lot of.

I live in Bristol; what a great city. Near to London, good connections, good 
countryside nearby, with a thriving arts and restaurant scene. Perhaps the only 
drawback is that the city knows it is good and therefore a bit smug.


Sustainability does worry me: we are all living beyond our means. Contrary to 
the propaganda put about,Observer readers are as guilty of this as anyone else.

I’m getting to the age (62) where things start to go wrong on the health 
front. So far reasonably well staved off, but sooner or later it will catch up 
with me. That’s one reason why I’m a workaholic; do it while you can, kind of 
thinking.

I am very proud of the NHS and it is comforting that all parties support this 
great British organisation. My biggest concern is the creeping privatisation 
and hope this can be curtailed after the election.

I have nothing inherently against politicians; I believe many have great 
aspirations and integrity, but once in office the inevitable reality takes 
over. Obama is a shining example of this, he was defeated more by circumstances 
than anything else and ended up being a disappointment.

It is always comforting to return to the UK. I couldn’t really live anywhere 
else. I do believe our ability to integrate is a real triumph and feel 
depressed by Ukip propaganda telling us otherwise. However some things are 
getting worrying, such as the rents getting so high that smaller shops are 
forced out of bigger cities, but I hope a sense of decency can still prevail.
