All this weekend, we are livestreaming Lollapalooza from Chicago, in 
association with Red Bull TV. All through Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights 
you can see the best bits on three channels within our player – if one act 
doesn’t tickle your fancy, just switch over to another one, or watch some of 
the video on demand that’s available all weekend. The live music kicks off from 
8pm BST/3pm ET on Friday night, and continues till the end of the weekend.

Among the shows you’ll be able to watch are:


 * Lorde

 * Arctic Monkeys 
 * Outkast 
 * Calvin Harris 
 * Kings of Leon 
 * Skrillex 
 * Chance the Rapper
