 Somali-born lawmaker Ayaan Hirsi Ali, whose citizenship came under question 
because she falsified information on her asylum application in 1992, will 
retain her Dutch nationality, the Netherlands immigration minister said 
yesterday.
The reversal came six weeks after immigration minister Rita Verdonk said Hirsi 
Ali's naturalisation was invalid because she gave a false name and birthday 
when she came to the Netherlands, escaping an arranged marriage.

Ms Verdonk's decision created an uproar in parliament, which demanded that she 
find a way out of the embarrassment.
