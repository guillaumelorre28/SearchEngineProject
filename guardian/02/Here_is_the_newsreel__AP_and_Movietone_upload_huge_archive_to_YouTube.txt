One million minutes of historical video dating back to 1895 – from footage of 
a hover scooter floating on a cushion of air to Mussolini calling for world 
peace –have been uploaded onto YouTube 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jul/22/ap-releases-a-million-minutes-of-filmed-history-to-youtube>
.

In what is the largest upload of historical news content on the video-sharing 
platform to date, theAssociated Press 
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTK-2W11Vh1V4uwofOfR4w/videos> and British 
Movietone <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHq777_waKMJw6SZdABmyaA/videos> are 
to host a collection of 550,000 video stories on two YouTube channels.

The digitised archival footage includes coverage of political milestones and 
historical moments in sport, fashion, science and entertainment.

The channels will be continually refreshed with up-to-date contemporary 
footage, according to AP, offering a “view-on-demand visual encyclopedia”.


From grainy black-and-white newsreel clips of the San Francisco earthquake in 
1906, to more modern high-definition video of Taylor Swift “shaking it off” at 
Madame Tussauds alongside her new waxwork, it could take around two years to 
watch all of the footage.


Here is a tiny selection from the vast archive:

the fashion field, says the AP archive caption, “but when it comes to 
sunglasses – they really excel.” The designs include elephant glasses,

brandy glasses. Très chic!

“Very often it’s the owner what leads a dog’s life,” says the voiceover, as he 
introduces a contraption to make the dogs think they are really running, “so 
the inventor of this little gadget deserves to be the benefactor of the human 
race.” The home exercises for Fido and Rover seem a bit of “all right”, while 
others seem to think they are going up the down escalator.
