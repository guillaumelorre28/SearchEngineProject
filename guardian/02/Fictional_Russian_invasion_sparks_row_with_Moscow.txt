A Norwegian TV channel says it will air a TV drama depicting a Russian 
invasion of Norway after environmentalists seize power and freeze the nation’s 
oil and gas industry. TV2 says the production company has already soldOccupied 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4192998/> – a 10-episode, £7m drama by thriller 
writer Jo Nesbø – to European stations.

Vyacheslav Pavlovsky, the Russian ambassador in Oslo, told Russia’s Tass news 
agency that “Russia, regrettably, has the role of the aggressor. In the worst 
traditions of the cold war, [this show] decided to scare Norwegian viewers with 
a nonexistent threat from the east,” he said. TV2 drama chief Christopher Haug 
said he was “surprised by the reaction”. “It is obviously a fiction, everyone 
can see that,” he said, adding that the Russian embassy had been told about the 
series “at an early stage, three years ago, I believe”.

“(It’s) an engaging character drama about people put under great pressure,” 
Haug added, stressing it “doesn’t aim to reflect the current geopolitical 
situation in a realistic way.”
