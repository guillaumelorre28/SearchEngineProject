The actor Anna Massey has revealed for the first time how she clashed with 
Edward Bond <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edwardbond> during rehearsals 
for his play Summer at the National Theatre in 1982. In her autobiography, 
Telling Some Tales, Massey describes eight weeks of "intensive and agonising 
rehearsals" that culminated in stand-up rows in front of the cast.

"Edward lambasted me in front of the other actors, and I could take it no 
more," she writes. "I stormed off the stage and went to my dressing room. I had 
never done anything like this before or since, but I really wanted to leave the 
production ... I was literally sobbing and shaking with fear and rage."

Bond's play deals with a fraught encounter between a wealthy eastern European 
woman and her former servant, who is terminally ill. Massey says Bond insisted 
that she perform her role as "pure evil". "He wanted me to play her like the 
wicked witch ... with fire streaming from my nostrils. My instincts were 
against every note he gave me and I was in despair."

When the production opened, Massey tried to introduce softer elements to the 
character. Whenever she did, she says, an admonitory note would arrive from 
Bond. Massey won an award for her performance, but she says Bond took his 
revenge: when Summer was published in paperback, Massey's character was omitted 
from the cover photograph. Bond declined to comment.
