Nelson Mandela’s family has denounced South Africa’s main opposition 
Democratic Alliance (DA) party for using the Nobel laureate’s voice in a 
television advert in the campaign for local elections next month.

The DA hopes to make major gains in municipal elections on 3 August, tapping 
into widespread discontent over South Africa’s weakening economy and embattled 
president, Jacob Zuma.

The advertisement shows a woman hesitating over whether to vote for the ruling 
African National Congress before choosing the DA after recalling a quote of the 
former president: “Let there be justice for all, let there be peace, let there 
be work, let there be bread for all.” But Mandela’s family criticised the 
“desperate lengths” used by the opposition to “dupe” voters, insisting that 
Mandela had always remained “a loyal and committed member of the ANC”.

“[It] is not only an attempt by the DA to usurp his moral stature for its own 
ends; it is an assault on his character,” said the ANC’s Mandla Mandela, 
Mandela’s grandson, who demanded that the advert be withdrawn.

DA spokeswoman Refiloe Nt’sekhe said the party had not violated the electoral 
code and had no intention of withdrawing the clip. “We don’t think we’re 
abusing Mandela’s legacy; we think we’re honouring it,” she said. “This is 
about saying that his legacy must live on, and if others have forgotten what 
it’s about, we will take that baton and move forward.”

The DA rules in the Western Cape province and the strategic Cape Town. The 
latest Ipsos opinion polls suggest that the ANC, which has ruled since the end 
of apartheid in 1994, could be under threat in three more major cities – 
Pretoria, Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth – at the election.
