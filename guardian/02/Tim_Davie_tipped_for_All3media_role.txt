BBC audio and music director Tim Davie has emerged as one of the contenders to 
become the chief executive ofAll3Media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/all3media>, the super indie behind shows 
including Midsomer Murders and The Only Way is Essex.

It is understood that headhunter Egon Zehnder – the company involved in the 
search for the newBBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> director general, 
which led to the appointment of George Entwistle earlier in July – is 
conducting the worldwide search for the right person to run the company.

Davie was one of the candidates shortlisted by Egon Zehnder for the director 
general job. He was interviewed but did not make it through to the final round.

But sources say it appears that he may now be on Egon Zehnder's radar for the 
All3Media role.

He has also been linked to a job running a revamped version of the BBC's 
commercial arm, BBC Worldwide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/22/bbc-worldwide-revamp-george-entwistle>
, that is being considered by Entwistle.

It emerged in February that All3Media's majority owner, private equity house 
Permira, was looking to appoint a headhunter to begin the search for a 
candidate to succeed chief executive Steve Morrison, the former senior Granada 
and ITV executive, who helped found the company in 2003 and will remain as its 
chairman.

He also retains a large minority holding in All3Media.

Davie had not commented at the time of publication.
