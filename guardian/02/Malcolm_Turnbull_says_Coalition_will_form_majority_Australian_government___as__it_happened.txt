Well, that's certainly a night

How do you end a night like tonight? You say well done Australia for giving 
the status quo a right good shake. I said when we kicked off the live coverage 
this evening disaffection was a major factor in this result, the only question 
was how the disaffection would ultimately manifest itself. We still don’t quite 
know and we won’t for several days.

What can be known right now is this. The prime minister is in trouble. The 
Coalition could well get over the line in its own right, or scrape together a 
governing coalition, butMalcolm Turnbull is damaged as of this evening. He 
embarked on this election seeking a mandate from the people and it’s not clear 
whether or not he’ll emerge with one.

The Coalition has lost at least 11 seats, including Bass, Braddon, Lindsay, 
Lyons, Macquarie, Eden-Monaro, Longman, Macarthur, Herbert, Burt and Solomon.

Labor has lost the Victorian seat of Chisholm to the Liberals.

Four independents are back in the parliament: Andrew Wilkie, Cathy McGowan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/cathy-mcgowan>, Bob Katter and a 
new NXT candidate,Rebekha Sharkie. Green Adam Bandt is back in Melbourne.

One Nation polled strongly. Pauline Hanson seems certain to be in the Senate.

On a two-party preferred basis, Labor is tonight leading the Coalition on 
50.06% to 49.94% on a two-party preferred basis.Bill Shorten has probably done 
enough to make a strong case to remain as leader of the ALP but, like 
everything, that remains to be seen.

So, as election nights go, this one was a doozy. It’s been beyond fantastic to 
have your company on this, my last night on Politics Live. Almost certainly. 
Like the election, one can’t have too many certainties. Perhaps I’ll be back. 
Perhaps I won’t. Most likely I won’t.

Thanks too to all the colleagues who pitched in with contributions: Lenore 
Taylor, Gabrielle Chan, Ben Raue, Helen Davidson, Michael Safi, Mel Davey, 
Gareth Hutchens and Paul Karp. To Mike Bowers, of course. And anyone I’ve 
forgotten.

And to you the readers. You are the heart of the project. Thanks for taking me 
around the world, into your lounge rooms and hot tubs, and dinners and the rest 
this evening. And thanks for being the best community going in national 
affairs. I will miss communicating with you in this form. It’s been a privilege.

Onwards, upwards.

PS: Go to bed, it’s late.

Can the Coalition get to a majority? It’s possible, certainly, but no one can 
make a definitive call on that tonight.

Malcolm Turnbull tries to end on a conciliatory note, with a pitch to unity.

I want to say to all Australians those that voted for us, those that voted for 
other parties or candidates, this is a time when we must come together. We must 
stick together. We face enormous challenges. We face, we face challenges in a 
rapidly evolving global economy that we do not anticipate, that will surprise 
us, the opportunities will surprise us, but so will the headwinds. We need have 
a common purpose. We need to have a commitment to the economic plan that sets 
us up for success. We have that plan and we will in government be seeking the 
support of all Australians, all members of the parliament, to the program that 
alone can deliver us success in the years ahead.

The prime minister thanks his family, ministers, his ministerial office and 
his campaign team. He also defends the decision to call a double-dissolution 
election. He says the objective of the double dissolution was not to clean out 
the Senate, the objective was to reassert the rule of law on building sites.

Malcolm Turnbull:

For those that say we shouldn’t have called a double-dissolution election are 
saying we should have just let the CFMEU with get on with doing what they like 
and never challenge them. And that is not in Australia’s interests. It’s not 
right. It’s weak. We have to stand up for what is right to restore the rule of 
law in an industry that employs over a million Australians.

'The Labor party has no capacity in this parliament to form a stable majority 
government'

Malcolm Turnbull:

So, my friends, I’m sure that as the results are refined and come in over the 
next few days with all of the counting, we will be able to form that majority 
government.

But, let me say this, let me say this without any fear of contradiction.

The Labor party has no capacity in this parliament to form a stable majority 
government. That is a fact.

'The circumstances of Australia cannot be changed by a lying campaign from the 
Labor party'

Malcolm Turnbull:

The circumstances of Australia cannot be changed by a lying campaign from the 
Labor party. The challenges, the fact that we live in times of rapid economic 
change, of enormous opportunity, enormous challenges, a time when we need to be 
innovative, when we need to be competitive, when we need to be able to seize 
those opportunities, those times are there.

No politician can give a speech, can write a policy, can send a message and 
change the reality of the circumstances in which we live and the policies that 
will enable us to meet those times with success. And they are the values of our 
party because they are the values of freedom, of business, of enterprise and 
entrepreneurship. And the alternative, the idea, the idea, the idea that the 
answer to Australia’s economic challenges, as Labor would have it, Labor with 
the second lowest primary vote in its history, but Labor would say that the 
answer is more debt, more deficit and higher taxes.

Seriously. Seriously.

How do you end a night like tonight? You say well done Australia for giving 
the status quo a right good shake. I said when we kicked off the live coverage 
this evening disaffection was a major factor in this result, the only question 
was how the disaffection would ultimately manifest itself. We still don’t quite 
know and we won’t for several days.

What can be known right now is this. The prime minister is in trouble. The 
Coalition could well get over the line in its own right, or scrape together a 
governing coalition, butMalcolm Turnbull is damaged as of this evening. He 
embarked on this election seeking a mandate from the people and it’s not clear 
whether or not he’ll emerge with one.

The Coalition has lost at least 11 seats, including Bass, Braddon, Lindsay, 
Lyons, Macquarie, Eden-Monaro, Longman, Macarthur, Herbert, Burt and Solomon.

Labor has lost the Victorian seat of Chisholm to the Liberals.

Four independents are back in the parliament: Andrew Wilkie, Cathy McGowan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/cathy-mcgowan>, Bob Katter and a 
new NXT candidate,Rebekha Sharkie. Green Adam Bandt is back in Melbourne.

One Nation polled strongly. Pauline Hanson seems certain to be in the Senate.

On a two-party preferred basis, Labor is tonight leading the Coalition on 
50.06% to 49.94% on a two-party preferred basis.Bill Shorten has probably done 
enough to make a strong case to remain as leader of the ALP but, like 
everything, that remains to be seen.

So, as election nights go, this one was a doozy. It’s been beyond fantastic to 
have your company on this, my last night on Politics Live. Almost certainly. 
Like the election, one can’t have too many certainties. Perhaps I’ll be back. 
Perhaps I won’t. Most likely I won’t.

Thanks too to all the colleagues who pitched in with contributions: Lenore 
Taylor, Gabrielle Chan, Ben Raue, Helen Davidson, Michael Safi, Mel Davey, 
Gareth Hutchens and Paul Karp. To Mike Bowers, of course. And anyone I’ve 
forgotten.

And to you the readers. You are the heart of the project. Thanks for taking me 
around the world, into your lounge rooms and hot tubs, and dinners and the rest 
this evening. And thanks for being the best community going in national 
affairs. I will miss communicating with you in this form. It’s been a privilege.

Onwards, upwards.

PS: Go to bed, it’s late.
 
Can the Coalition get to a majority? It’s possible, certainly, but no one can 
make a definitive call on that tonight.
 
He ends on this note.

Malcolm Turnbull:

The election is over. Only the counting remains. And now is the time to unite 
in Australia’s aid, in Australia’s service, to ensure that we can have truly 
the very best years for our country ahead of us.
 
Malcolm Turnbull tries to end on a conciliatory note, with a pitch to unity.

I want to say to all Australians those that voted for us, those that voted for 
other parties or candidates, this is a time when we must come together. We must 
stick together. We face enormous challenges. We face, we face challenges in a 
rapidly evolving global economy that we do not anticipate, that will surprise 
us, the opportunities will surprise us, but so will the headwinds. We need have 
a common purpose. We need to have a commitment to the economic plan that sets 
us up for success. We have that plan and we will in government be seeking the 
support of all Australians, all members of the parliament, to the program that 
alone can deliver us success in the years ahead.
 
The prime minister thanks his family, ministers, his ministerial office and 
his campaign team. He also defends the decision to call a double-dissolution 
election. He says the objective of the double dissolution was not to clean out 
the Senate, the objective was to reassert the rule of law on building sites.

Malcolm Turnbull:

For those that say we shouldn’t have called a double-dissolution election are 
saying we should have just let the CFMEU with get on with doing what they like 
and never challenge them. And that is not in Australia’s interests. It’s not 
right. It’s weak. We have to stand up for what is right to restore the rule of 
law in an industry that employs over a million Australians.
 
Malcolm Turnbull:

So, my friends, I’m sure that as the results are refined and come in over the 
next few days with all of the counting, we will be able to form that majority 
government.

But, let me say this, let me say this without any fear of contradiction.

The Labor party has no capacity in this parliament to form a stable majority 
government. That is a fact.
 
Malcolm Turnbull:

The circumstances of Australia cannot be changed by a lying campaign from the 
Labor party. The challenges, the fact that we live in times of rapid economic 
change, of enormous opportunity, enormous challenges, a time when we need to be 
innovative, when we need to be competitive, when we need to be able to seize 
those opportunities, those times are there.

No politician can give a speech, can write a policy, can send a message and 
change the reality of the circumstances in which we live and the policies that 
will enable us to meet those times with success. And they are the values of our 
party because they are the values of freedom, of business, of enterprise and 
entrepreneurship. And the alternative, the idea, the idea, the idea that the 
answer to Australia’s economic challenges, as Labor would have it, Labor with 
the second lowest primary vote in its history, but Labor would say that the 
answer is more debt, more deficit and higher taxes.

Seriously. Seriously.
