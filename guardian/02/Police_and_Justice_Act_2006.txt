Background

A part of the government's much-vaunted Respect Action Plan 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/jan/10/immigrationpolicy.ukcrime>, the 
Police and Justice Act was intended to deliver a police reform programme. The 
act makes wide-ranging changes to police governance and policing powers. It 
also allows the home secretary to more tightly manage local police forces, a 
change sought after the Soham inquiry, when David Blunkett had difficulty
suspending 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2004/jun/24/childrensservices.soham> the 
chief constable of Humberside.

Plans in the bill to merge the five regulators of the criminal justice system 
into one super-inspectorate, responsible for inspecting the police, courts, 
probation, prisons and the crown prosecution weresavaged 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/oct/11/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation> in 
the Lords and were scrapped by the government in favour of "enhanced joint 
working <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6060354.stm>". 

As the bill passed through parliament, a political row blew up over the 
extradition of three UK bankers – the so-calledNatWest Three 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/jul/13/politics.usnews> – to the US on 
fraud charges. Critics claimed the Anglo-American Extradition Treaty, signed by 
the government in 2002, was weighted in America's favour because although 
America does not have to provide prima facie evidence, Britain must provide 
American courts with evidence of "probable cause".

In response to the outcry the Tories tabled a series of amendments in the 
House of Lords, which if adopted, would have modified theExtradition Act 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2008/dec/16/extradition-act>
 to end America's fast-track extradition privileges. The amendments were passed 
by the Lords and received support from the CBI's director general, Richard 
Lambert, who called on parliament to protect Britain from these "unjust 
extradition proceedings 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/oct/25/houseofcommons.lords>" but the 
government later succeeded in overturning these changes in the Commons.

Criticism

Civil liberties groups argued that granting the Home Office power to exercise 
control over operational policing matters would politicise policing. These 
charges were echoed by attacks from the Association of Chief Police Officers 
and the Association of Police Authorities, who expressed "considerable concern 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/jun/20/immigrationpolicy.ukcrime/print>
" that the bill would reduce the number of checks and balances designed to 
prevent politicians from directly interfering in policing in England and Wales.

Liberty described the decision to place conditions such as electronic tags and 
curfews on conditional bail (pre-charge) as amounting to "police summary 
justice". The group also expressed concern that power to impose punitive 
conditions on cautions would create a "two-tier 
<http://www.lalkar.org/issues/contents/jan2000/labour.html> criminal justice 
system" in which those who are unable to pay the fines attached to a 
conditional caution end up with a criminal conviction.
