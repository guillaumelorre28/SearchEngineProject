Norway's ruling party celebrated its election victory in a rock venue; more 
than 20% of the population attends a music festival every year; and it's not 
unusual to find gigs taking place in a mausoleum. Oslo is the music-mad capital 
of this music-mad nation, and the city's modest population of 550,000 sustains 
numerous venues, outstanding record shops and countless festivals.

Annual events cater for a wide range of tastes including metal, jazz, folk, 
world and electronica, while theØya rock festival 
<http://oyafestivalen.com/pages/eng/1-news> puts most larger UK equivalents to 
shame when it comes to bands, organisation and environmental credentials. And 
while showcase industry eventsFolkelarm 
<http://www.folkelarm.no/2009/content/view/69/23/> and by:Larm 
<http://www.bylarm.no/pages/eng/1> attract music business figures from around 
the world to check out the talent, Norway's social democratic principles ensure 
that the gigs are also open to the public.

Before the late 90s there were few places catering for the left-field sounds 
in which Norway now specialises, although trailblazing venues Palace Grill, 
Last Train, Blitz and So What (now called Garage) continue to be pillars of the 
Oslo music establishment.

"There are more than 20 music venues in Oslo now – nine years ago there were 
four," says Runar Eggesvik. "By:Larm alone uses 40 stages in the centre of the 
city." Eggesvik has been a lynchpin in the local scene for the past decade. A 
former partner in the Café Mono venue (see below), he continues to serve on the 
board of theOslo Jazz Festival <http://www.oslojazz.no/indexENG.php> and 
co-founded Øya in 1999 to provide a platform for Norwegian talent.

These days local musicians are everywhere, be it at venues, performing in art 
museums or even taking advantage of the acoustics of the mausoleum of artist
Emanuel Vigeland <http://www.emanuelvigeland.museum.no/museum.htm>. And the 
walk between many of the key music destinations is shorter than between the 
main stages at T In The Park. Here's our pick of the best places to listen to, 
and buy, music in the city:

Bare Jazz



Even avowed haters of the genre get an insight into its appeal at this 
charming shop tucked away in an alley. Boasting an extensive selection of 
music, its friendly owner is on hand to dispense advice, and the shop hosts 
occasional live performances. A cosy, licensed cafe upstairs stays open until 
midnight from Wednesday to Saturday.
Grensen 8 (00 47 22 33 20 80, barejazz.no <http://www.barejazz.no/>)

Blå

Located in a 19th-century industrial zone now full of practice rooms and small 
music businesses, Blå started life 10 years ago as a jazz venue and swiftly 
expanded into a home for gigs and clubs of all types. The building once served 
as a diamond vault and the toilets are in a former safe.
Brenneriveien 9C (+47 98 25 63 86, blaaoslo.no <http://www.blaaoslo.no/>)

Funhouse

This unpretentious basement rock bar opened last year and swiftly established 
itself as an excellent late-night watering hole, where one barman manages to 
simultaneously serve beers and DJ a superb range of punk, rock and indie. Its 
small proportions lend an intimacy to the regular gigs which focus on touring 
guitar bands.
St Olavs Gate 32, enter via Pilestredet (+47 98 01 94 47, funhouseoslo.no 
<http://www.funhouseoslo.com/>)

Café Mono

This 160-capacity venue is massively popular with local bands, thanks to its 
practice of hiring musicians to work behind the bar, giving regulars discounted 
beer and inviting artists to DJ. It is famed for its egalitarian door policy 
(Franz Ferdinand were asked to queue with everyone else) and has a great diner 
around the back.

Kampen Bistro

Kampen boasts a shrine to Elvis, a giant painting of Norwegian rock legends 
Turbonegro and a menu which regularly includes shark and horse. It is co-owned 
by rock'n'roll chef and occasional band-booker Roar Møst who has catered for 
everyone from Morrissey to the Pet Shop Boys.
Bøgata 21 (+47 22 19 77 08, kampenbistro.no <http://www.kampenbistro.no/>) 

Oslo Opera House

Designed by local architects Snøhetta, Oslo's Opera House is worth checking 
out for non-classical concerts, too: in August it staged an Antony & the 
Johnsons show, with the band performing on a barge and the audience watching 
from the roof. Tickets start from NOK 100 (£10).

Parkteatret



One of the oldest cinemas in Europe (dating back to 1907), Parkteatret is now 
a 400-capacity music venue with an excellent reputation for Norwegian and 
international acts. The former projection room is now a tiny recording studio 
but much of the original decor remains. On Sundays it downsizes to a small 
stage and showcases local talent.

Råkk & Rålls

A time capsule containing all forms of popular music made since the 50s, 
this three-storey shop is like a museum where you can buy all the exhibits – 
and every type of device to play them. When the aural feast gets overwhelming, 
there are numerous sofas for a lie down.

The Villa

Sample Oslo's best pizza at Hell's Kitchen before heading downstairs to The 
Villa, a regular fixture in DJ Magazine's top 100 clubs in the world. Scottish 
expat Jen McConachie and local knob‑twiddler extraordinaire Tore have a policy 
of booking cutting-edge DJs and electronica bands.
