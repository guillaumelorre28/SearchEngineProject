The South Acute Programme, a collaboration of 21 acute trusts, have formed six 
groups to invest in a range of new technology, including e-prescribing, a 
clinical portal and a patient administration system.

The trusts, which were poorly served by the NHS National Programme for IT, 
have applied for central funding for the new systems.

They had intended to purchase systems through the NHS's Additional Supply 
Capability and Capacity framework, but did not get the systems they needed.

At three events in July, IT suppliers were invited to show-case their products 
to clinicians, managers and other staff from the programme

The events were designed to enable the NHS staff involved in specifying, 
buying or using the new IT to see what is available, before the formal 
procurement starts.

The six groups and their requirements are as follows:

Group A –Salisbury, Poole, Royal Bournemouth & Christchurch, Southern, 
Portsmouth, Royal Surrey, and University Hospitals Bristol – are seeking 
e-prescribing and medicines administration systems.

Group B - Queen Victoria, East Sussex and Western Sussex – are seeking 
e-prescribing, clinical documentation, order communications and an integrated 
clinical portal.

Group C - South Devon, Torbay and South Devon Care, South West Ambulance 
Service, Rowcroft Hospice and Southern Devon GP practices (via commissioners) – 
are seeking e-prescribing systems.

Group D – Dartford and Gravesham, Medway, East Kent Hospitals and Maidstone – 
are seeking patient administration systems, e-prescribing, a clinical portal 
and maternity systems.
