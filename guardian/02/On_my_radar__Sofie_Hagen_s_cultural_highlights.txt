 Positive role model: Lindy West. Photograph: Jenny Jimenez for the Guardian 
Lindy West is an American journalist, and she’s a woman who is confidently 
fat, which is a rare thing. I think she must have been my first body-positive 
role model. This is a feminist, empowering book; I cried the whole way through, 
though it’s very funny as well. We live in a culture where so many people 
criticise political correctness: they make it sound like those of us who care 
about it are angry and bitter, whereas she sees this deep sadness and 
hopelessness in people who think that way about others. It’s nice to read 
something that you know would have changed your life for ever if you’d read it 
when you were 16.

 ‘The funniest thing’: Ian Boldsworth and Barry Dodds. 
This is made by two comedians, Ian Boldsworth and Barry Dodds: it’s two 
friends talking about the paranormal, and it’s the funniest thing. The first 
season is about ghosts, the second is about mysteries, and the new one is 
conspiracy theories. Ian is a sceptic and disproves everything that Barry 
brings up, and Barry believes in everything, he needs no evidence. When I was a 
child I bought all these books about ghosts and I loved them so much, then I 
grew up and became a boring adult. So you hear the two parts of your brain, the 
one that wants to believe in magic and Santa Claus and ghosts, and the other 
part that goes “none of this real”.

 ‘Magical’: The Phoenix Artist Club in London. Photograph: Alamy 
I was really conflicted about including this because I love it so much I don’t 
want anyone else to be there. It’s mainly a bar but it’s a lot of things: in 
the daytime it’s a hub, around the late afternoon it turns into an amazing 
restaurant, and in the evening it becomes a space for gigs and cabarets. It 
used to be this very exclusive members-only club for people in musical theatre. 
You’ll have people playing the piano, you’ll have a drag queen and someone who 
still has their makeup on after their show, and then the whole cast ofStomp 
will come down and someone will start drumming on something. It’s this magical 
thing you wouldn’t really know happened just in central London.

 Talkshow host Alison Spittle. 
Alison Spittle is an Irish comedian and the funniest person I know. She’s 
started this talk show in Dublin where she has a live band and brings on 
special guests, including some quite big names, and she is apparently bringing 
the show to the UK next year. You don’t often see female talkshow hosts, and 
Alison manages somehow to be like an alpha, but without the ego of the straight 
white male. It’s such a warm show – she’s a positive person and very interested 
in people so it becomes a nice, intimate chat about people’s lives and careers. 
It can also be very silly.

 ‘Joyful jumpy music’: The Spook School. 
I think they’re described as a post-punk indie pop band, but I just call it 
joyful jumpy music. It’s very happy and positive, and they sing about sexuality 
and queer issues. It’s so progressive and fun: you don’t have to have read all 
the books to understand it, you can just listen and dance. On my tour I’m 
trying to make all the venues have gender-neutral toilets, and I got that idea 
because the Spook School did this. I have women coming up to me with tears in 
their eyes saying: “Thank you, because my daughter or son is transgender and it 
feels so good knowing they’re going to grow up in a world that has a bit more 
respect for them.”

 Your rubbish, their profit: the Gone for Good app. 
I’m really into decluttering. I live in London so I live in basically a shed: 
I have one single bed and everything’s tiny and there’s no space anywhere, but 
if you want to get rid of a well functioning mattress or something you have to 
call the council and it’s expensive. But with this app you choose your 
favourite charity – I always go for Mind – and then tell them what you have: 
clothes, furniture, jewellery. They send a volunteer to pick it up, and they 
sell it and make a profit. It’s such a lovely thing.

I mean no disrespect but British food is not the best in the world. I really 
do miss Danish food. Scandinavian Kitchen is a cafe close to Oxford Circus 
where you can go have coffee and eatsmørrebrød [rye bread sandwiches] and 
Danish chocolate. The rye bread is the thing I miss the most, because at home 
you have that every single day, sometimes for breakfast and lunch, it’s even 
part of Christmas dinner. You can put anything on top of it and it tastes 
amazing.
