Broadgate House, Broughton-in-Furness

One for those who aspire to a grand country house hotel but don't quite have 
the funds to match, the five bedrooms at this stately Georgian B&B are dressed 
with antique beds, rocking chairs and chests of drawers and lined with 
comfortingly chintzy wallpaper. None is en suite but, with access to several 
private bathrooms, no one has to share unless they opt to (owner Diana only 
lets out all the rooms if their occupants are well-acquainted enough to share a 
loo). The other big attraction here is the garden, a huge 300-year-old affair 
that overlooks an estuary and includes a walled area.

The Angel Inn, Bowness-on-Windermere
 Angel Inn, Lake District 
A bit of a surprise in Bowness-on-Windermere, where the competition tends to 
do a good trade in scampi and chips and frozen lasagnes – at this pub with 
rooms you're more likely to find Morecambe Bay potted shrimp, or wild boar and 
apple sausages, on the menu. In the summer grab one of the tables in the 
terraced garden for a meal with a view. On chillier evenings, sit by the fire 
in the bar and warm up after a blusteryboat trip across Windermere 
<http://www.windermere-lakecruises.co.uk> with a pint of Coniston Bluebird. 
Neither are the bedrooms your average pub lodgings. These have properly big 
beds, bright, patterned wallpapers and some very bling chandeliers; a couple 
have lake views.

Littletown Farm, Newlands
 Littletown Farm, Lake District 
The name of this simple but cosy farmhouse B&B in the Newlands Valley will 
ring bells with Beatrix Potter fans; "Little-town" farm features in the Tale of 
Mrs Tiggy-Winkle and its surroundings are said to have inspired the book. Brass 
bedsteads, embroidered throws and toys (books for adults, games for children) 
set a homely tone but most guests don't linger. Instead they come to clamber up 
Catbells or to tackle one of the other straight-from-the-door walks and, with 
owner Sarah having trained as a chef, it's worth ordering one of her packed 
lunches (£6), even if you started the day with the full Littletown monty. 
Dinners can also be arranged with a bit of notice.

Doubles from £76, B&B. Two course meals from £15pp, meat or cheese platters 
from £7

Sandhills Farm, Keswick
 Sandhills Farm, Lake District 
On first appearances this is your typical Lake District farm, surrounded by 
fells and fields on the shores of Bassenthwaite Lake. Step closer, however, and 
you see that the property's barn has been re-imagined as a contemporary, 
three-room B&B. Deep carpets, wooden floors, kingsize beds and a colour scheme 
that, like the bedrooms' names, takes its cue from the farm's creamy Charolais 
and Limousin cows and Texel sheep, set a cosseting tone. Breakfasts are also a 
big deal; the owners are passionate about the local Cumbrian produce they serve.

The Masons Arms, Cartmel Fell
 Masons Arms, Lake District 
Looking out over the Winster Valley, at Windermere's southern edge, this 
gastropub with rooms is great if you're swithering between B&B and 
self-catering. Its two cottages and five suites are scattered between the pub 
and its adjacent buildings and each come with kitchens, though most guests 
don't use them unless they want a full cooked breakfast, which the pub doesn't 
offer. It's worth upgrading to the Strawberry Bank Suite if you want to sleep 
in a four-poster and soak in a glossy, free-standing tub. A word of warning; 
the Masons Arms has just won the Good Pub Guide's Pub of the Year 2012 for the 
northwest and gets busy so be prepared for a wait on tables, and food orders, 
or go early.

Irton Hall, Eskdale
 Irton Hall, Lake District 
In the Eskdale Valley, the vast crenellated pile that is Irton Hall dates back 
to the 14th century (though much of it was reconfigured in the 19th), and both 
Oliver Cromwell and Henry VI are down on its roll-call of former guests. The 
hall is now mostly divided into self-catering apartments but they've recently 
started offering B&B too. Rooms are comfortable, if bland, with their dark 
leather headboards, built-in wardrobes, suburban bathroom doors and 
fresh-from-the-hotel-furniture-depot bedside tables, mirrors and desks. They're 
good value for the Lakes, though, and with all beds at least kingsize and 
dressed with thick white linen, it's hard not to sleep well here. If you don't 
want to spend every day hiking up a fell,Muncaster Castle 
<http://www.muncaster.co.uk> and its quirky owl sanctuary is close by.

The Crown at High Newton
 The Crown, Lake District 
Not everyone wants to be in a Beatrix Potter-style world of bedside posies, 
flagstone floors, Farrow & Ball paintwork and artfully mismatched furniture 
when they come to the Lakes. If you prefer your 17th-century coaching inns to 
come with an ultra-modern makeover, this seven-bedroom bolthole in the southern 
Lakes is just the place, all swirly wallpapers, shiny cushions and leather 
sofas. The food, too, puts a sophisticated, if slightly fussy, spin on 
gastropub favourites, with dishes such as roast duck breast and confit leg with 
sweet potato puree, pak choi and sticky honey jus.
• Newton-in-Cartmel, Newby Bridge, 01539 530613, crownathighnewton.co.uk

Apple Pie Rooms, Ambleside
 Apple Pie Rooms, Ambleside, Lake District 
The bedtime equivalent of comfort food, the eight modern rooms here aren't 
trying to reinvent the wheel but simply to provide a decent night's sleep. And 
they do. None are especially huge and their boxy wooden furniture and aubergine 
cushions, chairs and throws aren't going to appear in World of Interiors 
anytime soon, but thoughtful add-ons – thick curtains that properly block out 
Lake District sunrises and fresh milk from a shared fridge, iPod docks, Wi-Fi 
and homemade gingerbread – raise this above much of the local competition. Set 
beside Ambleside's quirkyBridge House 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/bridge-house>, a dolls house-sized former 
apple store that picturesquely straddles a stream, the other great attraction 
here is the attached cafe and bakery, the Apple Pie. Rather meanly (especially 
in high season when the rates soar), breakfast isn't included in the room 
prices but guests do, at least, get a 10% discount on the cafe's menu prices.

The Lodge in the Vale
 The Lodge in the Vale, Lake District 
Opened last year on the site of a former youth hostel, The Lodge bills itself 
as a hotel but it's better approached instead as a smart, contemporary hostel; 
there's just a coffee shop on site, breakfast is continental-only and the decor 
is functional rather than all-out stylish, with laminate flooring, wall-mounted 
TVs and headboards that pay direct homage to the Travelodge aesthetic. Be 
warned that not all rooms have views of the hotel's sweeping Lakeland setting. 
It's not really up to the job, then, if you're looking for hotel where you can 
sit by an open fire reading coffee table tomes by Lake District photographers. 
If you just want a decent bed for the night, though, it's a good choice and, 
with 40 beds, it's popular with groups. For dinner the nearest town is Keswick, 
around four miles away, or there's a pub around 15 minutes' walk away.

Rosemount, Windermere
 Rosemount B and B, Lake District 
Newly revamped, this pretty Victorian B&B fills a handy niche for weekending 
singles travelling by public transport. Not only are three of its nine rooms 
singles but, within 20 minutes' walk or so, you can get to Windermere's train 
station, pubs and cafes or Bowness-on-Windermere, where there's anart-house 
cinema <http://www.nm-cinemas.co.uk>, more restaurants and shops and boats 
across to Ambleside <http://www.windermere-lakecruises.co.uk>; owners Andrew 
and Louise will fill you in if you're not sure where to start. You don't have 
to be single to stay here, though. Doubles, a four-poster suite and a family 
room are also part of the package; all are subtly decorated in shades of taupe, 
grey, moss or violet, with funky wallpapers and plenty of little luxuries, from 
free Wi-Fi to a library of walking books and maps. Stay for two nights or more 
and you get access to a swankypool and spa down in Bowness
