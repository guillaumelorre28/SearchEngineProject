Cristiano Ronaldo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ronaldo> became the 
record goalscorer in European Championship football asPortugal beat Armenia 1-0 
in Group I. The Real Madrid forward took his tally in qualifying and tournament 
matches to 23, passing Denmark’s Jon Dahl Tomasson’s total with a close-range 
finish on 71 minutes. Portugal are a point behindDenmark, who won 3-1 in Serbia 
with two goals from the former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner.

The surprise result of the night undoubtedly came in Athens where Greece’s 
miserable start to Group F continued with a shock 1-0 home defeat by theFaroe 
Islands. European champions in 2004, Greece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/greece> again looked barely recognisable 
as the team that reached the last 16 of the World Cup as they were 
embarrassingly beaten by Joan Edmundsson’s second-half goal.

There was another unhappy home crowd in Rennes where the Euro 2016 hosts France
 needed a 73rd-minute equaliser from the substitute Antoine Griezmann to 
salvage a 1-1 friendly draw againstAlbania.
