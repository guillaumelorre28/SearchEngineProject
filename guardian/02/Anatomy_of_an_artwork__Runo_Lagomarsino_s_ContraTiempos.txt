Cracks

This work documents a walk the artist took under the architectural canopy that 
connects some of Oscar Niemeyer’s buildings in São Paulo’s Ibirapuera Park. 
Presented as a slide show, it reveals the cracks that he chanced upon in the 
pavement, many of which bore a striking resemblance to the South American 
continent.

Utopic dreams

The location these 27 images were taken at is key. Lagomarsino is asking us to 
see the modernist project, here symbolised by Niemeyer’s buildings and Roberto 
Burle Marx’s park design, as an essentially cracked dream of progress.

Hangover

Lagomarsino was born in Sweden to Argentine parents but has lived between 
Malmö and São Paulo for many years. His work, often performative and involving 
some sort of journey, deals with the European origins of Latin America and the 
colonial hangover the continent still suffers from.

Self-reflection

The work is included by Pablo León de la Barra in his curation of Under The 
Same Sun, a survey of Latin American art, at the South London Gallery. In it, 
de la Barra is questioning what Latin America is, as well as the influence of 
the western gaze.
