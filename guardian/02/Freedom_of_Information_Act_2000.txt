Aim

"To make provision for the disclosure of information held by public 
authorities or by persons providing services for them and to amend the Data 
Protection Act 1998 and the Public Records Act 1958; and for connected 
purposes."

Main provisions

• Creates a statutory right of access 
<http://www.foi.gov.uk/yourRights/coverageguide.htm> to information held by 
public authorities, which include central and local government, the health 
service, schools, colleges and universities, the police, courts, tribunal and 
inquiries and other non-departmental public bodies, including executive 
agencies, committees and advisory bodies.
• Exempts some classes of information from the duty of disclosure. Some of 
theseexemptions <http://www.foi.gov.uk/yourRights/exemptions.htm> are absolute, 
others are subject to a public interest test. Absolute exemptions to the right 
of access include matters relating to security or parliamentary privilege, 
court records and personal information (which is normally covered by the Data 
Protection Act).
• Requires public authorities to assist those who wish to access information 
and allows them to charge a fee for treating a request in accordance with 
regulations set by the secretary of state.
• Requires public bodies to adopt a scheme for the publication of information, 
including listing the information the authority intends to publish and the 
manner of publication.
• Renames the data protection commissioner the information commissioner 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/information-commissioner>. 
• Grants the new information tribunal (formerly the data protection tribunal) 
powers to enforce the new rights.


Background 

The Freedom of Information Act implements one of Labour's manifesto promises 
to end a culture of secrecy in government. Before its introduction, the UK had 
no legislation obliging the public sector to make information available to the 
general public. Instead, the code of practice on access to government 
information of 1994 provided a voluntary framework in which information might 
be shared with the public.

The legislative detail of the act emanates from the 1997 white paper, Your 
Right to Know <http://www.foi.gov.uk/reference/yrtksum.htm>. While the white 
paper was met with widespread enthusiasm, the draft bill introduced in November 
1999 was met with equal amounts of disappointment. Freedom of information 
campaigners accused the government ofwatering down 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/information-bill-attacked-as-toothless-1095736.html>
 the white paper's recommendations, and argued that the bill represented a 
significant step backwards from the government's initial proposals.

There were particular concerns about the unexpectedly high number of 
exemptions and thatthe proposed ministerial veto 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2000/apr/04/freedomofinformation.uk> 
undermined the spirit of the act.

The bill received six separate rebellions, the largest of which saw 36 Labour 
MPs vote against the government. The Liberal Democrats - who held the balance 
of power in the Lords - agreed acontroversial deal 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2000/nov/11/uk.politicalnews> with the 
government, in return for four concessions which Lord Goodhart, the party's 
home affairs spokesman, described as "significant".

The Conservative's leader in the Lords accused 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2000/nov/15/uk.freedomofinformation> the 
Liberal Democrat peers of "double dealing and twisting in the starkest form" 
and the peer's agreement was disowned by the Liberal Democrat leadership in the 
Commons. Finally, in order to force the bill through parliament, Jack Straw 
guillotined debate after MPs tabled 118 last minute amendments designed to 
strengthen the legislation.

The act came into force in January 2005. Prior to the full implementation of 
the act in 2005, there were widespread allegations thatseveral public bodies 
were shredding or otherwise destroying documents 
<https://www.theguardian.com/international> before it came into full effect. A 
second act, passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2002, extends the same 
jurisdiction to Scottish public bodies.

Arguably the biggest test of the act came in May 2008 when the Commons 
Speaker, Michael Martin, lost a high court battle to prevent the disclosure of 
the details of second-home expenses claimed by 14 prominent MPs. The Commons 
authorities had challenged a demand by the information tribunal to provide a
detailed breakdown 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/may/16/houseofcommons> of MPs' 
allowances under the Freedom of Information Act.

A proposal to exempt the full details of MPs expenses from the Freedom of 
Information Act was abandoned in January 2009, at the time both Labour and the 
Tories haverefused to rule out 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jan/22/freedom-of-information-mps-expenses>
 such a move in the future.



Criticism

Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, Tory deputy leader in the Lords, said: "This is a 
bad bill. It's been universally condemned." He and other critics claimed the 
provisions that allow ministers to veto applications create a "get-out clause 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2000/may/16/uk.freedomofinformation>" which 
renders the bill "toothless".

Elizabeth France, data protection commissioner - who was later responsible for 
enforcing the legislation - attacked the bill for being "over complex" and 
drafted "back to front". France claimed even her own lawyers found the 
legislation difficult to comprehend. Although she described the bill as 
offering "some important new rights", she argued it lacked purpose, which would 
make it difficult for the new information commissioner to make decisions on 
what information should be released.

When the freedom of information bill was introduced, Liberty described it as 
"a huge disappointment" as it proposed a much more restrictive regime than had 
previously been promised. Liberty criticised the act for replacing the original 
white paper test for when information can be witheld. The test was changed from 
"substantial harm to the public interest" to the far weaker test of "prejudice 
to the public interest". The act also excluded legal and policy advice given to 
government and made intelligence services entirely exempt from the act. Liberty 
criticised the wholly unjustifiable blanket exemptions for large amounts of 
information held by the police and other public bodies involved in 
investigation and argued that the act failed to serve the purposes of providing 
the governmental cultural change required for a truly open information regime.
