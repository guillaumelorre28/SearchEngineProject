 conducting andJonas Kaufmann 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/21/jonas-kaufmann-i-feel-like-an-ambassador>
 and Anja Harteros among the singers, feels like a very special event. The 
recording of Verdi’s grand opera, first performed in 1871 at Cairo’sKhedivial 
Opera House <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khedivial_Opera_House>, took place 
earlier this year in Rome’s 2800-seat concert hall theSala Santa Cecilia 
<http://www.santacecilia.it/en/auditorium/sala_santa_cecilia.html> with the 
orchestra and chorus of theOrchestra of Santa Cecilia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/20/oasc-antonio-pappano-review>.

“Aida is an intimate piece … but the intimacy is placed in large spaces,” says 
Pappano. “My role was to become the stage director creating an imaginary 
production.” Kaufmann makes his debut in the role of Egyptian general Radamès, 
Anja Harteros also makes her role debut as the captive Ethiopian princess Aida.

 (as Ramfis) and Ekaterina Semenchuk (Amneris) and Marco Spotti (King of Egypt) 
are among the other singers in a starry cast.
