The Odessa American reports <http://bit.ly/1UEF2Ek> crews worked on Thursday 
to replant the live oaks in Odessa, where Kyle was born.

The trees, costing more than $3,000 each, were purchased from Bush’s ranch 
near Crawford. Architect Kelly Cook said the trees are symbols of patriotism.

“There’s a lot of hidden symbolism behind the other elements that are going to 
be in the plaza,” Cook told the Odessa American. “A lot of that we are going to 
reveal at the dedication.”

Organizers of the project expect the Chris Kyle Memorial Plaza to open in 
July. The site will also feature a bronze statue of Kyle and, the Odessa 
American reported, “limestone from a Garden City quarry engraved with the names 
of the 50 states and woven into a Navy Seal trident”.


The newspaper also reported that Kyle family members including his wife, Taya 
Kyle

, had given input to the project, which was crafted by Vic Payne, a 
Wyoming-based sculptor.

Kyle and a friend, Chad Littlefield, were shot and killed in 2013 at a Texas 
shooting range. Eddie Ray Routh, a former marine whom Kyle and Littlefield took 
to the range, wasconvicted and sentenced to life in prison
