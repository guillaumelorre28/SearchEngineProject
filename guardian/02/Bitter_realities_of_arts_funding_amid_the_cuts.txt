I am writing to ask those people who set out their concerns so passionately 
about Walsall council’s proposal to end local authority funding to its art 
gallery (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/nov/30/closure-of-new-art-gallery-walsall-would-be-a-devastating-blow>
, 30 November) what they would do if they found themselves in the horns of such 
a truly awful dilemma. Funding to all authorities in the Black Country has been 
hard-hit by swingeing budget cuts since 2010 and it’s been hard for all of them 
to choose which services to cut and which to carry. The situation in Walsall, 
however, has been made worse by three changes in administration in 27 months 
which has made long-term planning in relation to the arts, among other 
“non-essential” services, impossible for the present incumbents.

These are not excuses. They are realities. I am a passionate defender of the 
arts and I get completely the incalculable benefits that exposure to them 
brings – especially to the less advantaged, of which there are many in the 
borough. But I cannot see how the council can choose the gallery over 
continuing to provide services to very needy adults and children. I don’t have 
the answers and so I will wait with bated breath to hear the outcome. It all 
saddens me deeply and is made worse as the real villains of the piece – the 
Tories, supported for five years by the Lib Dems - seem to be getting off 
scot-free. Tell me what is the answer?
