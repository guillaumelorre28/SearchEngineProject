Enough .. for now

I’m going to land the Politics Live bird now for a couple of hours to just 
break up the day shift from the night shift. I will be back at 5.30pm for live 
coverage of tonight’s Facebook/news.com debate. I hope to see you then. Until 
then, let’s recap Friday.

and Minister for Agriculture Barnaby Joyce speak to the media after a visit to

 * Malcolm Turnbull launched a jobs package, swept up after inviting a sheikh 
who had expressed negative views about homosexuality to a multi-faith dinner, 
and accused Labor of lying about Medicare privatisations.

 * Bill Shorten launched a different jobs package, picked up the negative 
rhetoric about the prime minister, and popped in on shipbuilding workers before 
heading to Sydney for debate preparation.

 * Workplace minister Michaelia Cash and shadow Brendan O’Connor faced off at 
the National Press Club. Both had bits to announce: Cash said she’d give the 
courts the powers to disqualify union officials from continuing to hold office 
where they have been repeatedly found to have breached workplace laws. She also 
flagged a ban on secret payments between unions and employers – what the Heydon 
royal commission termedcorrupting benefits. O’Connor flagged a review of the 
designation “casual” in an effort to stamp out the practice of employers 
pretending their permanent workforce were actually casuals.

That’s the day. See you in a couple of hours.

Calling Melbourne

Here’s the bad news. You’ve already missed the first of our Guardian Live 
election events. The first was this week in Sydney, where we discussed fairness 
in some depth before allowing ourselves a laugh. Here’s the good news. We 
treated the event as a live recording of our weekly campaign podcast, so you 
didn’t actually miss anything, except all the bits we did edit out, likeMike 
Bowers and a photographic update, and a guess the election jingle competition, 
and the conversation I anchored about the home stretch of the campaign. You 
don’t get those, but you get the main panel discussion and the Q&A, and some 
fun from the Hansard Monologues to finish.

<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/jun/16/is-australia-a-fair-country-australian-politics-live-in-sydney-podcast>
Now, for some more good news. There’s still one of these events to go. We’ll 
be in Melbourne next Tuesday night at the Malthouse Theatre in Southbank for 
the second of these events, which will be a conversation about the economy.You 
can purchase tickets online for that event here. 
<https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/guardian-live-election-special-june-21-tickets-19958593691?ref=ebtnebtckt>
Now you could easily say to me why not just wait for the podcast? Well, that’s 
true, except a couple of things are also true: it’s much more fun to be there, 
trust us, we actually had great fun and so did the audience, you will get 
segments that we don’t subsequently rebroadcast just because it would make the 
podcast too long, and if you aren’t there, you can’t hang about and say g’day 
afterwards. So, if you are in Melbourne next Tuesday, why not book?

My kingdom for a policy

Just tracking backwards to the workplace debate at the National Press Club, it 
really is extraordinary two weeks out from polling day that we don’t have a 
fleshed out policy from either side on industrial relations, which is a heavily 
contested area of public policy.

My colleague Paul Karp has had this to say on Twitter and he’s exactly right.
Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) 
Govt responded to #turc <https://twitter.com/hashtag/turc?src=hash> but 
refused to give policy on min wage, contracts. Very late to announce IR policy
#ausvotes <https://twitter.com/hashtag/ausvotes?src=hash> #ausunions 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/ausunions?src=hash> #NPC 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/NPC?src=hash>
 <https://twitter.com/Paul_Karp/status/743660290768703488> June 17, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/Paul_Karp/status/743660290768703488> 
But I’d argue the same applies to Labor. I watch politics for a living and I 
have no clear idea how far theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> will seek to deregulate 
the labour market in the next parliament and how far Labor might propose to 
shift the needle in the opposite direction. If I don’t know, given it’s my job 
to watch and report politics, how on earth will voters know? We have bits and 
pieces of each side but we don’t have the big picture. And voting is already 
underway. 220,000 people have already voted. My colleagueGreg Jericho tells me 
that’s a 65% increase on the pre polls at the same time in the last election 
cycle. So, any time now, folks, with the policies. Go you good things.

Given the discussion I’ve been having with readers about the impact of the 
super changes it’s worth reporting the relevant section from the prime 
minister’s interview withNeil Mitchell this morning.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Can I say this to you though people on low incomes don’t use TRIS [transition 
to retirement income stream]. Neil – you’ve got to be realistic here.

Q: I’ve had consecutive callers the other day. One is a diesel mechanic, the 
other is a supermarket manager, both on about 70 grand, both using it.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Okay, can I just make this point to you – if you are on a low income, a lower 
income, then you are likely to have a lower balance in your super account – 
correct?

Q: Yep.

Malcolm Turnbull:

If you have a low balance in your super account you should be putting money 
into super – not pulling it out. Those people that rang in that spoke to you, 
if that is their situation they have not been well advised because we are 
living for much longer than you know the actuarial tables told us we were 30 
years ago. If you were on, if you’ve got a low super balance as long as you are 
working you should be putting money into it rather than pulling money out. So 
what the TRIS has been used for overwhelmingly has been by people on the top 
marginal rate.

Q: But you do accept it can affect lower income earners?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, Neil, it could but I would say it would only be a small number of cases 
and people on low incomes who are pulling money out of super in a TRIS while 
they are still working are not being well advised because what they are doing 
is they are running down their super while they are still working and then what 
is going to support them when they retire.

So, a bit like Neil Mitchell, I have readers saying they are on Newstart 
(which would certainly meet any definition of low income), supplementing their 
benefit with superannuation funds through transition to retirement schemes. I 
would be fascinated to know how many people there are out there in this 
category, because conceptually it makes sense that there would be some people 
close to retirement age who might struggle to get a new job in the event they 
lost employment, and who might be in a position to draw on income from 
accumulated super savings – but would be better placed, as the prime minister 
says, leaving those funds in place. If they had a choice that is, which is the 
point here.

Back to the discussion on superannuation I’ve been having with readers on and 
off all day. I have another reader who reports to me that he’s on Newstart, 
plus a transition to retirement scheme, while trying to retrain as a mental 
health worker. If there are more of you, sing out.

I’ve also heard from people unhappy with the super changes for a range of 
reasons, but I’m particularly interested in people having to supplement benefit 
income with their super money.

There were a couple of skirmishes on penalty rates towards the end. Brendan 
O’Connor wanted Michaelia Cash to sign a petition about protecting penalty 
rates,Michaelia Cash wanted O’Connor to adopt all of the findings of the Hayden 
royal commission, “and we will both be very happy.”

Neither occurred, obviously.

It’s a wrap now at the club.

Q: Would either of you or are either of you considering adopting a form of 
enterprise contract for small and medium businesses that would make it easier 
for employers and employees to strike deals? Secondly, are either of you 
looking at creating a workplace standards commission and, thirdly, the report 
found that strikes are relatively low in Australia but it recommended the 
simplification of ballots to decide whether to have a strike. Is that something 
that either of you are looking at?

These are recommendations from the Productivity Commission. Michaelia Cash 
doesn’t answer the question. She says there’s still fifteen days to go. She 
says theCoalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has 
said it will release a response to the PC in “due course.”

Q: We will hear about enterprise bargaining and ballots before the election?

Michaelia Cash:

We’re certainly looking at the ballots issue. There shouldn’t be any unfair 
impediments for any party to these matters in that area.

A question about what the government intends to do about volunteers. The 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has flagged 
changes to the federal workplace laws flowing from the acrimonious fire dispute 
in Victoria.

Michaelia Cash gives no specifics at all but says this:

It is basically just making some changes to the list of terms under the Fair 
Work Act to ensure that volunteers are protected, but in particular, emergency 
services are able to conduct themselves in – the appropriate manner when they 
need to. That’s it. The changes are very, very simple. And I would hope we 
would have your support, Brendan, in relation to those changes.

Brendan O’Connor says this in all likelihood can’t be done.

Whilst it is true there are federal instruments that may well be involved, 
enterprise agreements, these are employees of state governments. If the 
minister now is announcing changes about the way in which the commonwealth is 
going to deal with employees of state governments, then I think that is 
certainly opens up a whole series of questions about how she will deal with 
other matters in the future.

A question about whether the ABCC bill will get through given the uncertainty

Michaelia Cash says we’ll have a mandate, so it should pass. The conversation

Brendan O’Connor wants to know how the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> intends to get these 
changes through the next parliament given it had an opportunity to bowl them up 
pre-election so they could be considered at a joint sitting, but failed to do 
so.

Moderator Chris Uhlmann follows this up.

Q: How do you imagine getting this legislation through the next parliament, 
given you will have to make changes to the law? And what are the penalties you 
propose for business? It takes two to tango?

Michaelia Cash:

Absolutely and business will be subject to the same penalty. Corrupting 
benefits involve two parties to a transaction - the person providing the 
benefit and the person receiving the benefit. That is why it’s both the 
employer and the union who are potentially liable.

Just in relation to Brendan’s point, though, I’m assuming Brendan are you 
saying you wholeheartedly support the government’s adoption of the Hayden royal 
commission recommendations, given you said you don’t tolerate this type of 
behaviour? If you do, that is great. It’s going through the parliament very 
easily!

There’s an obvious question on the Heydon recommendations and my colleague 
Paul Karp asks it.

Q: My question is to Senator Cash. You’ve spoken about banning corrupting 
benefits. Would this extend to banning payments from unions to employers such 
as ones from the SDA for pay roll deductions? And are you worried that there 
are some unintended consequences of this that it might be a recipe for union 
militancy because you would stop seeing cooperation between more moderate 
unions like the AWU and encourage more militant ones like the CFMEU on sites?

Michaelia Cash:

In relation to the policy that we’ve announced today, it’s all about 
transparency, transparency in relation to the deals that are being done by the 
employers and the unions. This is about both parties to any transaction, not 
one particular side of the transaction. Where legitimate payments are being 
made, and you referred to unintended consequences, if the payments are 
legitimate, they’re transparently made, they will not fall foul of the 
corrupting benefits law.

A couple of developments in the workplace policy arena

The two workplace spokespeople, Michaelia Cash for the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> and Brendan O’Connor for 
the ALP, have made their opening statements in the workplace debate.

O’Connor is flagging that Labor will examine the definition of casual work by 
setting an objective test for determining when a worker is a casual and when he 
or she is not. This review is designed to address the phenomenon of “permanent 
casuals”, which O’Connor says is an oxymoronic concept. The new definition, he 
says, will be developed in full consultation with industry, “something the 
Coalition government knows nothing about.”

Cash says the government will proceed with more recommendations from the 
Hayden royal commission. These include giving the courts the powers to 
disqualify union officials from continuing to hold office where they have been 
repeatedly found to have breached workplace laws. She’s also saying the 
government will adopt the recommendations to ban secret payments between unions 
and employers – what the royal commission has termedcorrupting benefits.

Michaelia Cash:

It is an obvious conflict of interest for money or reward to be changing hands 
between an employer and a union at the same time that they are negotiating a 
workplace agreement, and when they both have responsibilities to their 
workforce. Workers deserve to know that the union rep cannot go into the 
bosses’ office and do a dodgy deal behind their backs to cut their wages. When 
money changes hands in this way between a union and a company, there is always 
a loser and that is the worker. This is unacceptable and it has to change.

Campaign this Friday lunchtime

As I stop for the summary a workplace debate is under way at the National 
Press Club. I’ve got an ear on that but let’s recap.

he visits Macadamia Processing Cooperative near Ballina in the seat of Page,

 * Malcolm Turnbull has gone north, to the north coast of NSW, with a jobs 
package. The prime minister has had to clean up after inviting a sheikh to a 
multi-faith dinner who once made negative remarks about homosexuality. He’s 
also keen to get the message out that the Coalition will not privatise 
Medicare, which suggests health is biting as an issue in the electorate.

 * Bill Shorten has been south, with a youth jobs package and a Tasmania 
package. He’s decided today to pick up the aggro againstMalcolm Turnbull, 
picking fights this morning on the prime minister’s reluctance to participate 
in debates, the government’s parsimonious attitude to young job seekers, the 
government’s secret plan to privatise Medicare (the one the government says it 
doesn’t have, and really doesn’t have. At least on current intelligence, it has 
a plan to outsource delivery of the payment system, which is not the same as 
flogging the lot), and a bunch of other things.

I’m going to land the Politics Live bird now for a couple of hours to just 
break up the day shift from the night shift. I will be back at 5.30pm for live 
coverage of tonight’s Facebook/news.com debate. I hope to see you then. Until 
then, let’s recap Friday.

and Minister for Agriculture Barnaby Joyce speak to the media after a visit to

 * Malcolm Turnbull launched a jobs package, swept up after inviting a sheikh 
who had expressed negative views about homosexuality to a multi-faith dinner, 
and accused Labor of lying about Medicare privatisations.

 * Bill Shorten launched a different jobs package, picked up the negative 
rhetoric about the prime minister, and popped in on shipbuilding workers before 
heading to Sydney for debate preparation.

 * Workplace minister Michaelia Cash and shadow Brendan O’Connor faced off at 
the National Press Club. Both had bits to announce: Cash said she’d give the 
courts the powers to disqualify union officials from continuing to hold office 
where they have been repeatedly found to have breached workplace laws. She also 
flagged a ban on secret payments between unions and employers – what the Heydon 
royal commission termedcorrupting benefits. O’Connor flagged a review of the 
designation “casual” in an effort to stamp out the practice of employers 
pretending their permanent workforce were actually casuals.

That’s the day. See you in a couple of hours.
 
Here’s the bad news. You’ve already missed the first of our Guardian Live 
election events. The first was this week in Sydney, where we discussed fairness 
in some depth before allowing ourselves a laugh. Here’s the good news. We 
treated the event as a live recording of our weekly campaign podcast, so you 
didn’t actually miss anything, except all the bits we did edit out, likeMike 
Bowers and a photographic update, and a guess the election jingle competition, 
and the conversation I anchored about the home stretch of the campaign. You 
don’t get those, but you get the main panel discussion and the Q&A, and some 
fun from the Hansard Monologues to finish.

<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/jun/16/is-australia-a-fair-country-australian-politics-live-in-sydney-podcast>
Now, for some more good news. There’s still one of these events to go. We’ll 
be in Melbourne next Tuesday night at the Malthouse Theatre in Southbank for 
the second of these events, which will be a conversation about the economy.You 
can purchase tickets online for that event here. 
<https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/guardian-live-election-special-june-21-tickets-19958593691?ref=ebtnebtckt>
Now you could easily say to me why not just wait for the podcast? Well, that’s 
true, except a couple of things are also true: it’s much more fun to be there, 
trust us, we actually had great fun and so did the audience, you will get 
segments that we don’t subsequently rebroadcast just because it would make the 
podcast too long, and if you aren’t there, you can’t hang about and say g’day 
afterwards. So, if you are in Melbourne next Tuesday, why not book?
 
Just tracking backwards to the workplace debate at the National Press Club, it 
really is extraordinary two weeks out from polling day that we don’t have a 
fleshed out policy from either side on industrial relations, which is a heavily 
contested area of public policy.

My colleague Paul Karp has had this to say on Twitter and he’s exactly right.

<https://twitter.com/Paul_Karp/status/743660290768703488> 
But I’d argue the same applies to Labor. I watch politics for a living and I 
have no clear idea how far theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> will seek to deregulate 
the labour market in the next parliament and how far Labor might propose to 
shift the needle in the opposite direction. If I don’t know, given it’s my job 
to watch and report politics, how on earth will voters know? We have bits and 
pieces of each side but we don’t have the big picture. And voting is already 
underway. 220,000 people have already voted. My colleagueGreg Jericho tells me 
that’s a 65% increase on the pre polls at the same time in the last election 
cycle. So, any time now, folks, with the policies. Go you good things.
 
Given the discussion I’ve been having with readers about the impact of the 
super changes it’s worth reporting the relevant section from the prime 
minister’s interview withNeil Mitchell this morning.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Can I say this to you though people on low incomes don’t use TRIS [transition 
to retirement income stream]. Neil – you’ve got to be realistic here.

Q: I’ve had consecutive callers the other day. One is a diesel mechanic, the 
other is a supermarket manager, both on about 70 grand, both using it.

Malcolm Turnbull:

Okay, can I just make this point to you – if you are on a low income, a lower 
income, then you are likely to have a lower balance in your super account – 
correct?

Q: Yep.

Malcolm Turnbull:

If you have a low balance in your super account you should be putting money 
into super – not pulling it out. Those people that rang in that spoke to you, 
if that is their situation they have not been well advised because we are 
living for much longer than you know the actuarial tables told us we were 30 
years ago. If you were on, if you’ve got a low super balance as long as you are 
working you should be putting money into it rather than pulling money out. So 
what the TRIS has been used for overwhelmingly has been by people on the top 
marginal rate.

Q: But you do accept it can affect lower income earners?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well, Neil, it could but I would say it would only be a small number of cases 
and people on low incomes who are pulling money out of super in a TRIS while 
they are still working are not being well advised because what they are doing 
is they are running down their super while they are still working and then what 
is going to support them when they retire.

So, a bit like Neil Mitchell, I have readers saying they are on Newstart 
(which would certainly meet any definition of low income), supplementing their 
benefit with superannuation funds through transition to retirement schemes. I 
would be fascinated to know how many people there are out there in this 
category, because conceptually it makes sense that there would be some people 
close to retirement age who might struggle to get a new job in the event they 
lost employment, and who might be in a position to draw on income from 
accumulated super savings – but would be better placed, as the prime minister 
says, leaving those funds in place. If they had a choice that is, which is the 
point here.
 
Back to the discussion on superannuation I’ve been having with readers on and 
off all day. I have another reader who reports to me that he’s on Newstart, 
plus a transition to retirement scheme, while trying to retrain as a mental 
health worker. If there are more of you, sing out.

I’ve also heard from people unhappy with the super changes for a range of 
reasons, but I’m particularly interested in people having to supplement benefit 
income with their super money.
 
There were a couple of skirmishes on penalty rates towards the end. Brendan 
O’Connor wanted Michaelia Cash to sign a petition about protecting penalty 
rates,Michaelia Cash wanted O’Connor to adopt all of the findings of the Hayden 
royal commission, “and we will both be very happy.”

Neither occurred, obviously.

It’s a wrap now at the club.
 
Q: Would either of you or are either of you considering adopting a form of 
enterprise contract for small and medium businesses that would make it easier 
for employers and employees to strike deals? Secondly, are either of you 
looking at creating a workplace standards commission and, thirdly, the report 
found that strikes are relatively low in Australia but it recommended the 
simplification of ballots to decide whether to have a strike. Is that something 
that either of you are looking at?

These are recommendations from the Productivity Commission. Michaelia Cash 
doesn’t answer the question. She says there’s still fifteen days to go. She 
says theCoalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has 
said it will release a response to the PC in “due course.”

Q: We will hear about enterprise bargaining and ballots before the election?

Michaelia Cash:

We’re certainly looking at the ballots issue. There shouldn’t be any unfair 
impediments for any party to these matters in that area.
 
A question about what the government intends to do about volunteers. The 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has flagged 
changes to the federal workplace laws flowing from the acrimonious fire dispute 
in Victoria.

Michaelia Cash gives no specifics at all but says this:

It is basically just making some changes to the list of terms under the Fair 
Work Act to ensure that volunteers are protected, but in particular, emergency 
services are able to conduct themselves in – the appropriate manner when they 
need to. That’s it. The changes are very, very simple. And I would hope we 
would have your support, Brendan, in relation to those changes.

Brendan O’Connor says this in all likelihood can’t be done.

Whilst it is true there are federal instruments that may well be involved, 
enterprise agreements, these are employees of state governments. If the 
minister now is announcing changes about the way in which the commonwealth is 
going to deal with employees of state governments, then I think that is 
certainly opens up a whole series of questions about how she will deal with 
other matters in the future.
 
A question about whether the ABCC bill will get through given the uncertainty 
about the composition of the Senate post-election, the likelihood of more 
crossbenchers.

Michaelia Cash says we’ll have a mandate, so it should pass. The conversation 
then veers off into violence against women, with some unedifying finger 
pointing.
 
Brendan O’Connor wants to know how the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> intends to get these 
changes through the next parliament given it had an opportunity to bowl them up 
pre-election so they could be considered at a joint sitting, but failed to do 
so.

Moderator Chris Uhlmann follows this up.

Q: How do you imagine getting this legislation through the next parliament, 
given you will have to make changes to the law? And what are the penalties you 
propose for business? It takes two to tango?

Michaelia Cash:

Absolutely and business will be subject to the same penalty. Corrupting 
benefits involve two parties to a transaction - the person providing the 
benefit and the person receiving the benefit. That is why it’s both the 
employer and the union who are potentially liable.

Just in relation to Brendan’s point, though, I’m assuming Brendan are you 
saying you wholeheartedly support the government’s adoption of the Hayden royal 
commission recommendations, given you said you don’t tolerate this type of 
behaviour? If you do, that is great. It’s going through the parliament very 
easily!
 
There’s an obvious question on the Heydon recommendations and my colleague 
Paul Karp asks it.

Q: My question is to Senator Cash. You’ve spoken about banning corrupting 
benefits. Would this extend to banning payments from unions to employers such 
as ones from the SDA for pay roll deductions? And are you worried that there 
are some unintended consequences of this that it might be a recipe for union 
militancy because you would stop seeing cooperation between more moderate 
unions like the AWU and encourage more militant ones like the CFMEU on sites?

Michaelia Cash:

In relation to the policy that we’ve announced today, it’s all about 
transparency, transparency in relation to the deals that are being done by the 
employers and the unions. This is about both parties to any transaction, not 
one particular side of the transaction. Where legitimate payments are being 
made, and you referred to unintended consequences, if the payments are 
legitimate, they’re transparently made, they will not fall foul of the 
corrupting benefits law.
 
The two workplace spokespeople, Michaelia Cash for the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> and Brendan O’Connor for 
the ALP, have made their opening statements in the workplace debate.

O’Connor is flagging that Labor will examine the definition of casual work by 
setting an objective test for determining when a worker is a casual and when he 
or she is not. This review is designed to address the phenomenon of “permanent 
casuals”, which O’Connor says is an oxymoronic concept. The new definition, he 
says, will be developed in full consultation with industry, “something the 
Coalition government knows nothing about.”

Cash says the government will proceed with more recommendations from the 
Hayden royal commission. These include giving the courts the powers to 
disqualify union officials from continuing to hold office where they have been 
repeatedly found to have breached workplace laws. She’s also saying the 
government will adopt the recommendations to ban secret payments between unions 
and employers – what the royal commission has termedcorrupting benefits.

Michaelia Cash:

It is an obvious conflict of interest for money or reward to be changing hands 
between an employer and a union at the same time that they are negotiating a 
workplace agreement, and when they both have responsibilities to their 
workforce. Workers deserve to know that the union rep cannot go into the 
bosses’ office and do a dodgy deal behind their backs to cut their wages. When 
money changes hands in this way between a union and a company, there is always 
a loser and that is the worker. This is unacceptable and it has to change.
 
As I stop for the summary a workplace debate is under way at the National 
Press Club. I’ve got an ear on that but let’s recap.

 * Malcolm Turnbull has gone north, to the north coast of NSW, with a jobs 
package. The prime minister has had to clean up after inviting a sheikh to a 
multi-faith dinner who once made negative remarks about homosexuality. He’s 
also keen to get the message out that the Coalition will not privatise 
Medicare, which suggests health is biting as an issue in the electorate.

 * Bill Shorten has been south, with a youth jobs package and a Tasmania 
package. He’s decided today to pick up the aggro againstMalcolm Turnbull, 
picking fights this morning on the prime minister’s reluctance to participate 
in debates, the government’s parsimonious attitude to young job seekers, the 
government’s secret plan to privatise Medicare (the one the government says it 
doesn’t have, and really doesn’t have. At least on current intelligence, it has 
a plan to outsource delivery of the payment system, which is not the same as 
flogging the lot), and a bunch of other things.

Let’s get into the workplace debate now.
