In what was a media breakthrough for an African-American woman, the pianist, 
composer and arranger Mary Lou Williams signed up with New York's WNEW radio 
station in 1945 to present a weekly show, Mary Lou Williams' Piano Workshop. 
Williams, who had worked with Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey, 
espoused the controversial new jazz style of bebop, and was a friend and mentor 
to many of its young stars, including Thelonious Monk and CharlieÂ Parker.
