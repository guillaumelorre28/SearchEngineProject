British Airways <https://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairways> will 
operate all its long-haul services to and from Heathrow during a three-day 
cabin crew strike this week and cancel a small number of short-haul flights, 
the airline has announced.

Members of the Unite union will take industrial action

 from Thursday in a long-running dispute over pay.

BA cancelled 44 flights last week because of a 48-hour stoppage by members of 
the mixed fleet, made up of workers who have joined the airline since 2010.

BA said: “We have further strengthened our schedule for January 19-21, the 
days for which mixed fleet Unite has called strike action, and will fly all 
customers to their destinations.

“We will operate all our long-haul services to and from Heathrow and all 
services to and from Gatwick, London City and Stansted.

“We will merge a small number of our short-haul services at Heathrow, 
resulting in the cancellation of only 1% of our total scheduled flights across 
the three days. Customers affected will be able to fly slightly earlier or 
slightly later.”

Unite claims the mixed fleet crew are on “poverty” pay rates, with many forced 
to take on second jobs or turn up for shifts if they are sick because they 
cannot afford to be off ill. BA has said its pay offer for mixed fleet crew was 
consistent with deals agreed with Unite for other BA workers, reflected pay 
awards by other companies and will ensure rewards for mixed fleet remain in 
line with those for cabin crew at its competitors.

Unite said more than 800 mixed fleet cabin crew workers had joined the union 
since the start of the dispute, taking membership to more than 2,900.
