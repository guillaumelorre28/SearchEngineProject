Background

The aftermath of the second world war brought demands for an international 
forum to safeguard basic human rights. Influenced by theUniversal Declaration 
of Human Rights <http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html> adopted by the UN 
General Assembly in 1948,Council of Europe <http://www.coe.int/> states created 
their own Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms in 1950 (theEuropean convention on human rights 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=005&CL=ENG>). 

The UK was active in ratifying the treaty 
<http://www.dca.gov.uk/peoples-rights/human-rights/faqs.htm> in 1950. Cases 
were to be presided over by theEuropean court of human rights 
<http://www.echr.coe.int/echr> in Strasbourg. Domestic courts in the UK could 
not hear cases because, under the UK's dualist system of law, the convention 
remained an international treaty with no domestic effect.

In 1997 the Labour government, honouring a manifesto pledge 
<http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml> 
announced their intention to incorporate the convention into domestic law. It 
published a white paper,Rights Brought Home: The Human Rights Bill 
<http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/hoffice/rights/intro.htm>
, which would:

"mean that the British people will be able to argue for their rights in the 
British courts – without … inordinate delay and cost. It will also mean that 
the rights will be brought much more fully into the jurisprudence of the courts 
throughout the United Kingdom and will thus be far more subtly suited and 
powerfully woven into our law."

Opponents expressed fears that the bill would shift authority from parliament 
to the judiciary. William Hague, leader of the Conservatives, stated that it 
would replace "the rule of law with the rule of lawyers".

The bill sought to preserve parliamentary sovereignty by allowing the courts 
to interpret laws in a mannercompatible with the convention 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1#pb2-l1g3> "so far as 
it is possible to do so" but ultimately requiring the courts to make a 
"declaration of incompatibility" if such an interpretation is not possible. 
This mechanism then gives parliament the opportunity to amend any incompatible 
law.

The press argued that the right to a private and family life would become a 
"back door" for a privacy law that could be used to curtail press freedom. The 
government responded byannouncing an amendment 
<http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n14146198> designed to 
reassure critics.

The government also tabled amendments to allay church leaders' fears that the 
bill could be used to change church policies on homosexuality, education and 
the ordination of woman priests.Section 13 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1#pb5-l1g13> affords 
"particular regard" to the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.

Criticism

Ten years on, there remain contrasting views as to the effectiveness and 
constitutionality of the Human Rights Act. The allocation of power between the 
judiciary and the government remains a controversial issue. In 2007 a 
parliamentary select committee said that the act had materially contributed to
recent tensions 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldselect/ldconst/151/15110.htm>
 between the executive and the judiciary: "Senior judges are now required to 
police constitutional boundaries and determine sensitive human rights issues in 
a way which would have been unthinkable 40 years ago."

In cases where law has clearly been found to violate convention rights, the 
House of Lords has issued declarations of incompatibility. The most 
controversial of these judgements was a2001 case 
<http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/56.html> where the House of Lords 
found that the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 was incompatible 
with human rights by providing for the indefinite detention of terrorist 
suspects and discriminating against them on the ground of nationality or 
immigration status.

Other areas that remain subject to controversy 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/jun/20/longtermcare.uknews> are the 
meaning of "public authority" – significant because only public authorities are 
obliged to act in accordance with convention rights under the act.

Although the act only covers public bodies, the courts have also applied it to 
private law actions between individuals or private companies. Although a 
violation of rights in private law does not create a cause of action, if there 
is a pre-existing cause of action in UK law then the court as a public 
authority must interpret it in line with the act.

One of the most significant areas in which this has been used is the 
protection of celebrities from alleged invasions of privacy by the media. In 
July 2008, Formula One boss Max Mosley won a privacy action against the News of 
the World. High Court judge Mr Justice Eady decided that the newspaper had
violated Max Mosley's right to a private and family life 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/jul/24/mosley.privacy>by publishing footage 
of his sex session with prostitutes.

Following the case Daily Mail editor-in-chief Paul Dacre attacked the act, 
criticising it for allowing a judge tointroduce a law on privacy 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/nov/10/pauldacre-dailymail> "with a 
stroke of his pen". The government believes thisfeeling is widespread 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/dec/08/human-rights-act-straw> and 
hopes to appease it by introducing a "bill of rights and responsibilities" – 
thoughstrong opposition from the cabinet  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/nov/04/rights-bill-jack-straw>in 
November 2008 underlined the unpopularity of the proposal.
