Day 36 (pretty much) done

Both Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten have wrapped up their public events for 
the afternoon, so we might leave the daily political grind there for now.

For a public holiday (in most states) it has been quite a big day, headlined 
by Labor’slong-awaited announcement on the NBN 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/13/labor-pledges-to-fix-nbn-mess-and-link>
.

We’ve also seen the Coalition’s first environment announcement of the 
campaign, although according to my colleagueMichael Slezak, the policy looks 
less like a way to save the Great Barrier Reef than “a rescue mission for the 
government’s credibility on reef policy”.

It may not even be legal to use money from the Clean Energy Finance 
Corporation fund in this way.

Mikey writes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/13/when-you-poke-the-coalitions-great-barrier-reef-rescue-mission-it-crumbles>
:

According to the CEFC Act 
<http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/cefca2012297/>, lending that 
money to water quality projects would be illegal. The CEFC can spend money only 
on “clean energy technologies”, which are defined in the act as 
energy-efficiency technologies, low-emission technologies or renewable energy 
technologies.

It’s not at all clear how some of the projects spruiked as part of the 
announcement could be spent in accordance with that law.

Mikey says that Labor’s promise of $500m over five years, as opposed to $1bn 
over 10 years under theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, was marginally better 
because it was “actual funding,” not loans, but both fall far short.

Says the Australian Marine Conservation Society’s Imogen Zethovan:

Scientists and economists have said we need billions – not millions.

I’ll leave you on that cheerful note. Katharine Murphy will be back with 
Politics Live to coverBill Shorten’s appearance on Q&A tonight. So we’ll see 
you then, politics fans.

Let’s take a break from the federal election for a moment to look at a 
candidate for the 2017 West Australia election, who is in trouble for 
describing a woman in a skin-care advertisement as having “a head like a 
half-eaten pie”.

Liberal candidate Daniel Parasiliti came within 24 votes of winning the state 
seat of Midland from Labor’sMichelle Roberts in 2013 and has been endorsed to 
run again next March. He has been pulled up twice in the past two weeks for 
inappropriate comments on social media.

According to a report on the ABC 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-13/liberals-midland-candidate-offensive-tweets-prompts-sacking-call/7505424>
, the latest round referred to a critique of an advertisement, which said: 
“Kristina Bell on neutrogena, if you want to sell skin care don’t have a 
d-class celebrity with a head like a 1/2 eaten pie to sell ur product.”

Deputy premier and women’s interests minister, Liza Harvey, said the tweet was 
“not terribly professional”.

She told the ABC 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-13/liberals-midland-candidate-offensive-tweets-prompts-sacking-call/7505424>
:

Once you put it out on social media it is there forever. In that context if 
there is more of these matters with Daniel Parasiliti, he may need to 
reconsider his position.

I’m going to assume Parasiliti actually meant Kristen Bell, aka Veronica Mars, 
who is a Nutrogena “ambassador”.

On Sky News, Ed Husic has been asked to answer the raven-writing desk riddle: 
how canBill Shorten argue that he should stay out of the CFA dispute in 
Victoria, on the basis that it’s a state issue, and simultaneously involve 
himself in council amalgamations in NSW, which is also clearly a state issue?

Husic, shockingly, said Shorten was right in both cases. 

He said that on the one hand, the CFA dispute is an industrial agreement 
between the United Firefighters Union and the state-controlled CFA, while on 
the other, there was “an ongoing interest by federal government in local 
government”.

In contrast, Malcolm Turnbull got involved in the CFA debate but not in the 
council amalgamation debate.

Take that with whatever measure of salt you deem appropriate.

If you are thoroughly sick of the election campaign, take heart: pre-polling 
opens in fewer than 20 hours. You could, theoretically, vote tomorrow and then 
retreat to your pillow fort until Sunday, 3 July.

I am not endorsing that course of action, but if you are so inclined here is a 
list of the pre-poll voting places

The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, has just given a press conference. 
He says Labor is incorrect to say that it will deliver its rejigged version of 
the NBN at the same time as the Coalition. TheCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, he said, was on track 
to complete the NBN by 2020.

Labor thinks the Coalition will take until 2022, which is also the deadline it 
adopted.

Fifield said the NBN was badly managed under Labor and well managed under the 
Coalition.

The story of the NBN under this government has been a good one, with a new 
board, a new management, a new attitude and a new mandate.

Under Labor the NBN would be delayed by two years and probably be more 
expensive to recover the extra money spent on it. (“I’m being generous in 
accepting Labor costings on face value ... I would hazard a guess that ... 
whatever Labor does will be substantially more than $8bn.”)

We’ve got the $8 billion from their own mouth for today’s proposition, but how 
much is their proposition to retrofit other properties that have fibre to the 
node going to cost? Labor need to come clean on that.

Is the Coalition’s NBN a short-term fix?

No, says Fifield, but it will be delivered “sooner and faster”, and more 
quickly, too.

opinionated trailer on the blog last week.

Some in Launceston have taken offence to his decision to drive the trailer 
around today after LGBTI people were targeted by the worst mass shooting in US 
history.

3.59am BST 03:59  <> 

In Western Australia, Greens senators Larissa Waters and Rachel Siewert are 
touring the Women’s Health and Family Services in Northbridge, Perth.

They are there to announce funding for specialist family violence services. 
The promise is for $54m a year for 10 years, or $5.4bn over 10 years, just for 
services in WA. I understand funding announcements for other states will follow.

That’s obviously a significant amount of money. The Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has pledged $200m over 
four years, and Labor about $420m.

But, as both Labor and the Coalition would undoubtedly comment, $200m-$400m of 
actual money is better than a $5bn promise that will never be delivered.

Still, specialist family violence services are massively underfunded and, if 
we care about family violence, it’s a problem we should address.

Says Siewert:

Australia can afford to make sure women receive the support they need to 
escape domestic violence services by raising revenue from those who can afford 
to contribute their fair share, for example through reforming negative gearing.

It’s grossly unfair that women fleeing domestic violence are being left 
homeless, while the very wealthy get taxpayer-funded subsidies for their 
multiple investment homes.

The government’s campaign spokesman, Mathias Cormann, has been on Sky News 
talking about Labor’s new Medicare ad, whichfeatures former PM Bob Hawke 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ9EfrpPcQs>.

Hawke says in the ad:

And now the Liberals have set up a Medicare privatisation taskforce. Everybody 
knows you don’t set up a Medicare privatisation task force unless you plan to 
privatise Medicare.

Cormann said there was no such taskforce.

There is no such taskforce. It’s a complete Labor invention ... Bill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> has misled Bob Hawke 
over that and he should hang his head in shame.

What was happening, Cormann said, was the government was reviewing the 
administration system to ensure the efficiency of Medicare.

A final note on those two press conferences before we move on. Both Malcolm 
Turnbull and Bill Shorten were asked to comment on Donald Trump’s tweet on the 
Orlando shootings.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't 
want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!
 <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/742034549232766976> June 12, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/742034549232766976> 
Shorten hadn’t seen the tweet (“I haven’t been keeping up with the Trump”) but 
once briefed said that he did not agree.

I do not support demonising a whole group of people, a billion people, based 
on faith, with the acts of stupid, random, terror events such as this.

Compared to Shorten’s previous criticisms of Trump, it was fairly weak, and 
framed as the essential difference between US andAustralian politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics>.

Turnbull was even more cautious.

I would simply say that we stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States, 
on this day today, in solidarity, and as we do in the Middle East and as our 
intelligence services cooperate every hour of every day in the battle against 
extremism, in the battle against terrorism.

Interesting that Malcolm Turnbull received absolutely no questions on the 
Great Barrier Reef, which also meant thatGreg Hunt’s earlier comments that the 
reef was healthier under theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> were not challenged.

That seems extraordinary, given what we know about the level of coral 
bleaching on the reef this year, and given that experts have said this election 
is thelast chance to secure promises that could save the reef 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare>
.

I suppose it’s possible a flurry of questioning occurred off camera. If it 
did, please, let me know.

3.05am BST 03:05  <> 

A number of questions on the Coalition’s announcement of $100,000 for a new 
sports stadium in Townsville, which has provoked suggestions of pork-barrelling.

Is there any particular reason the PM decided to make this announcement the 
day before pre-poll voting opens in the electorate of Herbert, where goodwill 
toward incumbent Liberal MPEwen Jones is waning? 

Turnbull says the funding will be delivered under the cities policy, and: 
“Townsville is a city. It’s a great city.”

And with that, the press conference is over. Team Turnbull is set to fly to 
Perth this afternoon.

A question on preferences, specifically the announcement that the Greens would 
preference Labor in every seat except for the 11 with empty how-to-vote cards.

Turnbull couldn’t help but interrupt that question.

You’re surprised by this? They are both left-wing parties. They sail together. 
Sorry, please ...

Labor is set to preference the Greens across the country and run an open 
ticket in South Australia. What does that say about its concern for the 
national interest?

Turnbull says he won’t run a commentary on the Labor party before offering the 
following commentary:

[The alternative to the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> is a] return to the 
Labor/Greens/independent minority government steering further and further to 
the left.

So that’s why we are putting the Greens last or certainly behind Labor, 
because we want Australians to understand there’s a very clear choice: the 
government I lead with a clear plan, stable government, forging ahead; on the 
other hand, the chaos of theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> and of course 
Shortenomics getting shorter and shorter on economics every day.

(He seems quite pleased with Shortenomics. Expect to see it on T-shirts soon.)

Both Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten have wrapped up their public events for 
the afternoon, so we might leave the daily political grind there for now.

For a public holiday (in most states) it has been quite a big day, headlined 
by Labor’slong-awaited announcement on the NBN 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/13/labor-pledges-to-fix-nbn-mess-and-link>
.

We’ve also seen the Coalition’s first environment announcement of the 
campaign, although according to my colleagueMichael Slezak, the policy looks 
less like a way to save the Great Barrier Reef than “a rescue mission for the 
government’s credibility on reef policy”.

It may not even be legal to use money from the Clean Energy Finance 
Corporation fund in this way.

Mikey writes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/13/when-you-poke-the-coalitions-great-barrier-reef-rescue-mission-it-crumbles>
:

According to the CEFC Act 
<http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/cefca2012297/>, lending that 
money to water quality projects would be illegal. The CEFC can spend money only 
on “clean energy technologies”, which are defined in the act as 
energy-efficiency technologies, low-emission technologies or renewable energy 
technologies.

It’s not at all clear how some of the projects spruiked as part of the 
announcement could be spent in accordance with that law.

Mikey says that Labor’s promise of $500m over five years, as opposed to $1bn 
over 10 years under theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, was marginally better 
because it was “actual funding,” not loans, but both fall far short.

Says the Australian Marine Conservation Society’s Imogen Zethovan:

Scientists and economists have said we need billions – not millions.

I’ll leave you on that cheerful note. Katharine Murphy will be back with 
Politics Live to coverBill Shorten’s appearance on Q&A tonight. So we’ll see 
you then, politics fans.
 
Malcolm Turnbull is in the air now headed for Western Australia. This is what 
awaits him.

Let’s take a break from the federal election for a moment to look at a 
candidate for the 2017 West Australia election, who is in trouble for 
describing a woman in a skin-care advertisement as having “a head like a 
half-eaten pie”.

Liberal candidate Daniel Parasiliti came within 24 votes of winning the state 
seat of Midland from Labor’sMichelle Roberts in 2013 and has been endorsed to 
run again next March. He has been pulled up twice in the past two weeks for 
inappropriate comments on social media.

According to a report on the ABC 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-13/liberals-midland-candidate-offensive-tweets-prompts-sacking-call/7505424>
, the latest round referred to a critique of an advertisement, which said: 
“Kristina Bell on neutrogena, if you want to sell skin care don’t have a 
d-class celebrity with a head like a 1/2 eaten pie to sell ur product.”

Deputy premier and women’s interests minister, Liza Harvey, said the tweet was 
“not terribly professional”.

She told the ABC 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-13/liberals-midland-candidate-offensive-tweets-prompts-sacking-call/7505424>
:

Once you put it out on social media it is there forever. In that context if 
there is more of these matters with Daniel Parasiliti, he may need to 
reconsider his position.

I’m going to assume Parasiliti actually meant Kristen Bell, aka Veronica Mars, 
who is a Nutrogena “ambassador”.
 
On Sky News, Ed Husic has been asked to answer the raven-writing desk riddle: 
how canBill Shorten argue that he should stay out of the CFA dispute in 
Victoria, on the basis that it’s a state issue, and simultaneously involve 
himself in council amalgamations in NSW, which is also clearly a state issue?

Husic, shockingly, said Shorten was right in both cases. 

He said that on the one hand, the CFA dispute is an industrial agreement 
between the United Firefighters Union and the state-controlled CFA, while on 
the other, there was “an ongoing interest by federal government in local 
government”.

In contrast, Malcolm Turnbull got involved in the CFA debate but not in the 
council amalgamation debate.

Take that with whatever measure of salt you deem appropriate. 
 
If you are thoroughly sick of the election campaign, take heart: pre-polling 
opens in fewer than 20 hours. You could, theoretically, vote tomorrow and then 
retreat to your pillow fort until Sunday, 3 July.

I am not endorsing that course of action, but if you are so inclined here is a 
list of the pre-poll voting places 
<http://www.aec.gov.au/about_aec/cea-notices/pre-poll-voting-centres.htm>.
 
The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, has just given a press conference. 
He says Labor is incorrect to say that it will deliver its rejigged version of 
the NBN at the same time as the Coalition. TheCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, he said, was on track 
to complete the NBN by 2020.

Labor thinks the Coalition will take until 2022, which is also the deadline it 
adopted.

Fifield said the NBN was badly managed under Labor and well managed under the 
Coalition.

The story of the NBN under this government has been a good one, with a new 
board, a new management, a new attitude and a new mandate.

Under Labor the NBN would be delayed by two years and probably be more 
expensive to recover the extra money spent on it. (“I’m being generous in 
accepting Labor costings on face value ... I would hazard a guess that ... 
whatever Labor does will be substantially more than $8bn.”)

We’ve got the $8 billion from their own mouth for today’s proposition, but how 
much is their proposition to retrofit other properties that have fibre to the 
node going to cost? Labor need to come clean on that.

Is the Coalition’s NBN a short-term fix?

No, says Fifield, but it will be delivered “sooner and faster”, and more 
quickly, too.
 
We mentioned Family First Senate candidate for Tasmania, Peter Madden, and his 
opinionated trailer on the blog last week.

Some in Launceston have taken offence to his decision to drive the trailer 
around today after LGBTI people were targeted by the worst mass shooting in US 
history.

In Western Australia, Greens senators Larissa Waters and Rachel Siewert are 
touring the Women’s Health and Family Services in Northbridge, Perth.

They are there to announce funding for specialist family violence services. 
The promise is for $54m a year for 10 years, or $5.4bn over 10 years, just for 
services in WA. I understand funding announcements for other states will follow.

That’s obviously a significant amount of money. The Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has pledged $200m over 
four years, and Labor about $420m.

But, as both Labor and the Coalition would undoubtedly comment, $200m-$400m of 
actual money is better than a $5bn promise that will never be delivered.

Still, specialist family violence services are massively underfunded and, if 
we care about family violence, it’s a problem we should address.

Says Siewert:

Australia can afford to make sure women receive the support they need to 
escape domestic violence services by raising revenue from those who can afford 
to contribute their fair share, for example through reforming negative gearing.

It’s grossly unfair that women fleeing domestic violence are being left 
homeless, while the very wealthy get taxpayer-funded subsidies for their 
multiple investment homes.

Gareth Hutchens (@grhutchens)

<https://twitter.com/grhutchens/status/742185054890131456>  
The government’s campaign spokesman, Mathias Cormann, has been on Sky News 
talking about Labor’s new Medicare ad, whichfeatures former PM Bob Hawke 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ9EfrpPcQs>.

Hawke says in the ad:

And now the Liberals have set up a Medicare privatisation taskforce. Everybody 
knows you don’t set up a Medicare privatisation task force unless you plan to 
privatise Medicare.

Cormann said there was no such taskforce.

There is no such taskforce. It’s a complete Labor invention ... Bill Shorten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> has misled Bob Hawke 
over that and he should hang his head in shame.

What was happening, Cormann said, was the government was reviewing the 
administration system to ensure the efficiency of Medicare.

A final note on those two press conferences before we move on. Both Malcolm 
Turnbull and Bill Shorten were asked to comment on Donald Trump’s tweet on the 
Orlando shootings.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't 
want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!
 <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/742034549232766976> June 12, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/742034549232766976> 
Shorten hadn’t seen the tweet (“I haven’t been keeping up with the Trump”) but 
once briefed said that he did not agree.

I do not support demonising a whole group of people, a billion people, based 
on faith, with the acts of stupid, random, terror events such as this.

Compared to Shorten’s previous criticisms of Trump, it was fairly weak, and 
framed as the essential difference between US andAustralian politics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics>.

Turnbull was even more cautious.

I would simply say that we stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States, 
on this day today, in solidarity, and as we do in the Middle East and as our 
intelligence services cooperate every hour of every day in the battle against 
extremism, in the battle against terrorism.
 
Interesting that Malcolm Turnbull received absolutely no questions on the 
Great Barrier Reef, which also meant thatGreg Hunt’s earlier comments that the 
reef was healthier under theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> were not challenged.

That seems extraordinary, given what we know about the level of coral 
bleaching on the reef this year, and given that experts have said this election 
is thelast chance to secure promises that could save the reef 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare>
.

I suppose it’s possible a flurry of questioning occurred off camera. If it 
did, please, let me know.
 
A number of questions on the Coalition’s announcement of $100,000 for a new 
sports stadium in Townsville, which has provoked suggestions of pork-barrelling.

Is there any particular reason the PM decided to make this announcement the 
day before pre-poll voting opens in the electorate of Herbert, where goodwill 
toward incumbent Liberal MPEwen Jones is waning? 

Turnbull says the funding will be delivered under the cities policy, and: 
“Townsville is a city. It’s a great city.”

And with that, the press conference is over. Team Turnbull is set to fly to 
Perth this afternoon.

 
A question on preferences, specifically the announcement that the Greens would 
preference Labor in every seat except for the 11 with empty how-to-vote cards.

Turnbull couldn’t help but interrupt that question.

You’re surprised by this? They are both left-wing parties. They sail together.
