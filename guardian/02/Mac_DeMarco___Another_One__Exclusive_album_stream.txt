Mac DeMarco might have a slacker reputation, but there’s nothing slack about 
his output. It was only last year that he wowed fans – andthe Guardian’s music 
critics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/nov/26/-sp-the-best-albums-of-2014>
 – with Salad Days, and already he’s back with another selection of laidback 
indie rock.

Just as he hides his workrate behind a scruffy exterior, so the woozy vibe of 
his songs help camouflage what is a fierce melodic nous. In fact, the album 
owes a lot to the Beatles and the classic pop songwriters of the 1970s who 
followed them. No Other Heart especially has a glorious George Harrison-esque 
guitar line and a melody that trembles: “Give this loverboy a try, I’ll put the 
sparkle right back in your eye.”

Soulful and deft, it’s a masterclass in making songwriting sound effortless.
