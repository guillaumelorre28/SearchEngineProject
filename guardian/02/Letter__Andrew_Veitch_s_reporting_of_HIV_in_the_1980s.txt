stood out then, and subsequently, as the most responsible writer and observer 
of the unfolding epidemic. As professor of sexually transmitted infections at 
the Middlesex hospital and medical school, I spoke to him frequently and 
trusted him completely. Andrew took great trouble to understand the scientific, 
medical and social consequences of HIV/Aids, for which we opened the first ward 
in the UK, and was always well prepared. He knew what he wanted, and could be 
mischievous, but I never refused his calls. An ally to the gay and medical 
communities, in helping to educate the public about the issues he showed his 
belief in honest journalism.
