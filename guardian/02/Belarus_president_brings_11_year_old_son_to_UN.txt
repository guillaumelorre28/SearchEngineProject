Alexander Lukashenko <https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexander-lukashenko> 
may be running for his fifth consecutive term as president of Belarus this 
month, but he’s already well ahead of the game when it comes to grooming a 
successor.

The self-admitted “authoritarian” leader 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm> has brought his 11-year-old son 
Kolya to the United Nations general assembly in New York this week, giving his 
chosen heir a firsthand look at the fine points of international diplomacy.


Seated between the foreign minister and presidential press secretary, Kolya 
watched attentively from the gallery as his father decried western military 
interventions in the Middle East.

On Saturday, father and son visited the memorial to the victims of the 
terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.

Often called Europe’s last dictator, Lukashenko has ruled Belarus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/belarus> with a heavy hand since 1994, 
jailing critics and opposition leaders. Although he has two adult sons, he has 
indicated that the young Kolya, whose mother has never officially been 
identified, will be his preferred successor.

Russian-French-Belarusian movie about second world war fighter pilots, starring 
Gerard Depardieu. The news comes after the scandal-prone French actor, who has 
taken Russian citizenship, visited Belarus in July.
