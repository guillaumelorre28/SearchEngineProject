There are few castles more evocative than Corfe Castle (
nationaltrust.org.uk/corfe-castle <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/corfecastle/>
), an imposing ruin perched high on the hill, which is thought to be the 
inspiration for Kirrin Castle in Enid Blyton's Famous Five books. It's a 
formidable defensive, and the common around the castle has been shaped by human 
activity over thousands of years, leaving an interesting archaeological 
landscape. Cream teas for the tired walker await in the Bankes Arms Hotel (
dorset-hotel.co.uk <http://www.corfecastlehotel.co.uk/>) or, for something 
stronger, the beer garden overlooking the castle at the Greyhound Inn (
greyhoundcorfe.co.uk <http://www.greyhoundcorfe.co.uk/>) is the perfect place 
to relax with a pint.

Inland Dorset is Thomas Hardy country, with landscapes right out of his 
novels. You can still visit his birthplace and his later home, Max Gate, (
nationaltrust.org.uk/hardy-country 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hardy-country/>) but the essence of Hardy is 
found in the surrounding countryside that inspired his semi-fictional Wessex. 
This walk takes you through the Downs in which his novels of the Blackmore Vale 
are set, featuring far-reaching views and an ancient landscape. For a nearby 
pick me up, The Fontmell (thefontmell.com <http://thefontmell.com/>) is a good, 
newly-refurbed country pub.

Few geological formations on the Dorset coastline are as instantly 
recognisable as the chalk sea stack of Old Harry and his wife. Formed by sea 
erosion, which now threatens the formation itself, the chalk headland offers 
spectacular views across Poole harbour to Bournemouth and the Isle of Wight. 
This easy walk takes you along the clifftop and through the chalk grassland of 
the surrounding area, with the added benefit of starting and ending at the 
Bankes Arms (bankesarms.com <http://www.bankesarms.com/>).

Following a short stretch of the South West Coast Path, this walk takes in the 
area around Chesil Beach, an 18-mile long "barrier beach" that shelters 
Weymouth from the erosion caused by the prevailing wind and waves. Fishermen 
are a common sight on the coastline. Further inland, the wide hedgerows offer 
excellent habitats for birds, and the nearby nature reserve (
chesilbeach.org/cbfnr <http://www.chesilbeach.org/cbfnr/>) offers further 
bird-spotting opportunities.

Start Lambert's Castle car park, grid ref: SY366988 
National Trust downloadable route and map  
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/article-1356404044656/>
Dorset's countryside is scattered with forts, castles, gun emplacements and 
other fortifications. There are several recognisable ancient monuments in the 
county, including the two Iron Age hill forts featured in this walk. Lambert's 
Castle offers fine views of the surrounding area, with the coast visible on 
clear days. The medieval fishpond is also well worth a visit – it is now a 
wildlife habitat, with kingfishers known to visit on occasion.

A "ware" is a traditional term for land for rough grazing, but the full 
meaning of the intriguingly ancient named field of Scratch Arse Ware has sadly 
been lost. This walk follows the natural limestone grassland through Scratch 
Arse Ware and surrounding fields to Dancing Ledge – a former quarry that now 
exists as a stone "dancefloor" ledge. The area is an evocative one – a nearby 
sycamore tree was thought to have been once used as a hangman's tree and the 
coast nearby was smugglers' territory. The historic Ship Inn (
shipinnlangton.co.uk <http://www.shipinnlangton.co.uk/>) nearby provides 
refreshment for tired walkers, while nearby Swanage is a delightful seaside 
town.

National Trust downloadable route and map

The sand spit of Studland is a unique spot – the only place in the British 
Isles where all six native species of reptile can be found. This walk takes in 
areas of the fascinating heath, which is also home to a diverse array of 
insects and birdlife. Studland (nationaltrust.org.uk/studland-beach 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/studland-beach/>) is the start point for the 
South West Coast Path, and is also home to some fantastic beaches, with 
barbecue spots and views across to Sandbanks (a short journey away on the chain 
ferry), Bournemouth, and the Isle of Wight. The wide open Shell Bay is a 
popular spot, with gently sloping waters backed by dunes, while for those who 
prefer slightly more freedom, the most popular naturist beach in Britain is 
nearby.

Located in the middle of Poole harbour, Brownsea (
nationaltrust.org.uk/brownsea-island 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/brownsea-island/>) is a dramatically located 
wildlife refuge with a rich history and great views of the surrounding area. 
The birthplace of the Scouting movement, it has plenty to divert families, with 
the Baden-Powell Outdoor Centre providing excursions and activities. The real 
star, however, is the wildlife, with red squirrels, deer, lizards, insects and 
birdlife all in residence. This short walk takes you through some of the best 
spots, but further wandering may result in its own wildlife-spotting rewards.

This short circular walk along golden Burton Cliff takes in some spectacular 
clifftop views of the Jurassic coast. Hive beach below is part of the 
fascinating stony beach coastline around Lyme Bay. It was a key landing stage 
for smugglers, and folklore says that a local fisherman or smuggler could tell 
exactly where he was on the beach at night or in fog simply by looking at the 
size of the pebbles. The regular rock falls often expose fascinating fossils; 
you can compare finds or simply enjoy the view with some fine fresh fish at the 
Hive Beach Café, (hivebeachcafe.co.uk <http://www.hivebeachcafe.co.uk/>).

This leisurely stroll takes in views towards Golden Cap (
nationaltrust.org.uk/golden-cap <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/golden-cap/>), 
pictured, the highest point on the south coast, which gets its name from 
minerals in the rock that glisten a rusty-gold when exposed in the sunlight. 
This is another stretch of countryside full of history, from burial mounds to 
ancient landscape, while the woods fill with wild flowers in the summer months. 
Stonebarrow Hill, close by, is a great starting point for a network of 
footpaths, including the family-friendly interactiveSmugglers' Trail 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/home/view-page/item853837/249737/>.
