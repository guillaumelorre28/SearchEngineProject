Royal Devon and Exeter foundation trust has signed a deal with technology firm 
Atos <https://www.theguardian.com/society/atos> that will see existing 
patients' records scanned and stored electronically.

Atos' partner Fortrus will be responsible for providing the software, which 
works by using the latest Adobe technologies and will allow Royal Devon and 
Exeter to integrate all of its existing IT systems. This includes the use of 
Adobe LiveCycle, which is a suite of software that will provide workflow, 
systems integration, eForms and forms, PDF rendering and distribution. Web 
conference and e-learning components also form part of the package.

The system application, called Mobius, that clinicians will see on their 
desktop, aims to bring together all the underlying patient record-related 
technology and information into one portal. The scanning function of paper 
records will use Kodak Capture.

A spokeswoman for the trust told GGC: "Electronic document management 
technology creates a digital information repository from existing paper case 
notes or medical records. The contract provides software and services which 
will achieve integration of electronic copies of paper files with patient 
information held electronically.

"This three-year programme should improve efficiency, enable us to be 'paper 
light' and support clinical care at the point of delivery across the whole 
organisation when it is first adopted at the end of this year."

The trust did not disclose the value of the five year contract.
