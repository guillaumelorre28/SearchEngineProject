A man who posted an offensive message on Facebook about Ann Maguire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ann-maguire>, the teacher who was stabbed 
to death in her classroom, has been jailed for six weeks.

Jake Newsome, 21, wrote the message on the social media site after Maguire was 
killed at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds on 28 April.

He wrote that he was glad she had been stabbed and he felt sorry for the boy 
accused of her murder.

Newsome, from Leeds, pleaded guilty at the city's magistrates court last month 
to sending an offensive message. Court officials confirmed that he was jailed 
when he appeared before a district judge on Wednesday.

The court heard that Newsome posted the message on Facebook on the afternoon 
of 1 May. Facebook users quickly posted a range of comments in response, 
objecting to what he was saying, and he was reported to West Yorkshire police.

He admitted to officers that he put the message on the site but claimed he did 
not think it was offensive.

Tributes from around the world have poured in for Maguire, 61, who was stabbed 
a number of times as she taught a Spanish lesson.

She had taught at Corpus Christi for more than 40 years and was due to retire 
in September.
