Eleven alleged Russian spies have been arrested 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/29/russian-spies-suburban-america>, 
but just one of them gets all the attention – the pretty one. Anna Chapman has 
become the face of the story. Photographs of her appear on the front pages of 
all the British papers today. The phrases "femme fatale", "flame-haired" and 
"Bond girl" are liberally trotted out in the English-speaking press the world 
over.

She is also being much ogled at online. "She can spy on me anytime," is one of 
the milder comments on aYouTube video of her.

The Huffington Post collects some of the many "risqué pics" that Chapman 
posted of herself onher Facebook page <http://www.facebook.com/chapmananya>. It 
invites readers to rate them ona scale of one to 10, with one being "nyet" and 
10 being "red hot"

The New York Daily Post admires her "Victoria's Secret body" 
<http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/spy_ring_qzWW8bImf9yEDTbtXcQnUL> while its 
rival the New York Daily News describes photos of her as"sexy profile pictures 
that could easily be headshots in a casting call to find the next Bond girl"

Over here in the UK, Chapman prompts the imagination of the Daily Mail's 
reporters to run wild

.

"Miss Chapman is emerging as the femme fatal [sic] of the James Bond-style 
plot which saw ' sleepers' embedded in American cities, some more than a decade 
ago.

"And she appears every inch the part, using her charm, beauty and high-society 
connections to move with ease through the circles of power and use other people 
to find out state secrets."

It falls to the New York Times to hose down all this excitement. "The only 
things missing in more than a decade of operation were actual secrets to send 
home to Moscow," <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/world/europe/30spy.html?hp> 
it notes.

Citing officials, it adds: "None of the 11 people accused in the case face 
charges of espionage, because in all those years they were never caught sending 
classified information back to Moscow."

Simon Jenkins in the Guardian is one of the few newspaper columnists not 
getting carried away. He writes: "The FBI and the CIA have bust an operation 
that must have cost the Russians millions and yielded nothing that could not 
have been gleaned from the New York Times, Washington Post and political blogs. 
Why not leave the spies at it? I am sure they were paying tax.It is laughable 
that they posed any threat to the American people.

The Daily Beast tracks down a man who was interviewed by Chapman for a job. 
Scott Beauchamp suggests that the reality behind Chapman's facade was more 
humdrum than the media would like to imagine.

Disappointingly the interview was "rather boring" 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-06-30/russian-spy-anna-chapman-the-job-interview/>
, he says.

"There were no bags of cash exchanged. She didn't once use a radio 
transmitter, and I never asked her if she was a Bond girl."

When Beauchamp told his wife that he had been interviewed by Chapman, her 
first response was: "You didn't tell me that she was hot!"
