There’s some time to play in the remaining games but Seattle look like locks 
for the first seed in the NFC - they’re leading St Louis 20-6 with two mintues 
to go. Green Bay are all but champions of the NFC North - they’re leading the 
Lions 28-14.

Bad loss and more...bad. Sewage system broke near the Falcons locker room 
inside Georgia Dome.

A completely deserved win for the Panthers, who ran all over the Falcons at 
the start before their defense took control - Ryan was simply given no time to 
set his feet.

Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 0:50, 4th quarter

On 4th and 9, Toilolo picks up 11 yards and the Falcons continue to fight. 
They just need to score 28 points in a little under a minute. Easy.

Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 2:40, 4th quarter

The Panthers go for it on 4th and 8 because, why not? Whittaker’s run is ended 
four-yards short of the first down, much to the annoyance of everyone who wants 
to see this monstrosity of a game end as soon as possible. There are now 14 
people in the crowd, 13 of them Panthers fans, the other person someone who got 
lost on the way to lunch.

Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 3:40, 4th quarter

The Panthers amble into Falcons territory. Aaron Rodgers has just crossed for 
a rushing touchdown against the Lions - it looks like the Packers have wrapped 
up the NFC North.

So, it’s looking like the Panthers will play the Cardinals next week, who are 
curently losing to the 49ers. You wouldn’t bet against the Panthers at home, 
would you?

Right, the Seahawks are now 13-6 up, and it’s difficult to imagine St Louis 
staging a dramatic comeback. The NFC No1 seed looks locked in.

I would say the Falcons stadium is now 40% full. A good judge of 
probabilities, those Falcons fans. Jones drops a catch in the end zone and the 
stadium is now 39% full.

This is the first time the Panthers have had two defensive touchdowns in a 
single game. The Falcons play U2 in an attempt to rev their team up. This may 
be one of their problems.

TOUCHDOWN! Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 0:23, 3rd quarter

The Falcons pick up six yards on 3rd and 8 and they’ll go for it - they don’t 
have much choice. Top marks for aggression, no marks for execution. Ryan is 
AGAIN under pressure and the Panthers get their second defensive TD of the game 
(and year) with an 84-yard interception return.

Ooof. Another near interception from Ryan, he’s hit again and his wobbly throw 
is almost picked off. The Panthers call time out on 2nd and 15 with the Falcons 
on Carolina’s 46.

Seattle are now level with St Louis, amd moving towards No1 seed in the NFC. 
Green Bay, however, are ahead of Detroit. Meanwhile, the Falcons are showing 
some fight. “Showing some fight” in this instance meaning “getting a first 
down”. Julio Jones is the man who earns it with a 20-yard reception. Then, 
ahhhhh, it’s another pick six. No! The comeback is on! It’s pass interference 
and first down to Falcons. The comeback is still on! Maybe.

Cam Newton pretty much has his hands in his pockets and is whistling a jaunty 
tune right now. The tune being “We’re in the playoffs, la-la-la, we’re in the 
playoffs, ha-ha-ha.” Lyrics aren’t his strong point. The Falcons do record a 
three and out though. They’ll start deep in their own territory after a 72-yard 
(woah!) punt.

The Lions have tied the game against Green Bay. Matt Flynn’s not going to stay 
on the field now, right? Falcons are forced to punt. They fail to get into 
Panthers territory again. Ryan just can’t get away from the pressure the 
Panthers’ defense is putting him under.

FIELD GOAL! Carolina Panthers 27-3 Atlanta Falcons 10:20, 3rd quarter


The Falcons stop the Panthers from getting into the end zone, but Carolina 
edge that little bit further towards the playoffs. And they had already gone

Carolina Panthers 24-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 10:46, 3rd quarter

An excellent throw from Newton helps Benjamin past 1,000 yards in his rookie 
season. Not too bad at all. At the other end of the age spectrum, a man old 
enough to be his father - if he matured freakishly early. I mean freakishly 
early - Jerricho Cotchery picks up another 18 yards with a nice catch. We’re on 
the Atlanta 30.

Carolina Panthers 24-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 12:20, 3rd quarter

The Panthers start on their own 41. That smell wafting around Cam Newton’s 
nostrils right now is the playoffs.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 13:20, 3rd quarter

Good news for the Falcons! They start the second half. Bad news for the 
Falcons! They’re 24-3 down. Worse news for the Falcons! Ryan just got sacked 
and their offensive line appears to be made out of paper! Worst news for the 
Falcons! The paper has blown away! Ryan sacked again! The Falcons will punt.

Scores around the NFL:

Carolina 24-3 Falcons

Oakland 7-20 Denver

Detroit 7-14 Green Bay

St Louis 6-0 Seattle

Arizona 17-13 San Francisco

At the moment, by my calculations, the Packers will claim top seed in the NFC 
if scores stay the same. They’d get the bye week, which could come in handy if 
Rodgers’s injury is serious.

The Panthers take no risks going into half-time and rund down the clocks. 
There are boos in the stadium from the Falcons fans.

Carolina Panthers 24-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 0:51, 2nd quarter

Third and 6 for the Falcons, looking to score before half-time and keep their 
season alive-ish. Ryan is under pressure though and they’ll have to punt. 
Carolina have all their time outs too and will start on their own 10. 
Meanwhile, bad news for Green Bay:

Rodgers has a calf injury, per the team, and his return is questionable.

TOUCHDOWN! Carolina Panthers 24-3 Atlanta Falcons 1:47, 2nd quarter

Newton burrows, barrels and generally employs lots of other impressive verbs 
starting with B as he gets into the endzone. With plenty of help from his 
offensive line.

Carolina Panthers 17-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 1:54, 2nd quarter

Just to make things trickier for themselves, the Falcons give up a penalty and 
start at their own 12. Ryan, who has missed on his last four throws, soon finds 
himself at 3rd and 6. He finds Hester for 12 yards and they continue to brea... 
Ah. White fumbles and the Panthers snaffle the ball. The Falcons may well have 
stopped breathing. But at least they’re going out with the fantastic 
incompetence we’ve come to expect from the NFC South.The play is under review 
but the fumble and recovery stand - the Panthers will start on the Atlanta 5.

TOUCHDOWN! Carolina Panthers 17-3 Atlanta Falcons 4:18, 2nd quarter

Falcons pick it up on their own 25 after the Panthers are forced to punt. It 
doesn’t starttoo well, with Ryan sacked. Then gets worse as he throws a pick 
six. Ryan is under huge pressure and Harper takes a stooping catch that he runs 
back to leave the Falcons in deep trouble.

Carolina Panthers 10-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 6:07, 2nd quarter

In more positive news for the Cardinals, Lindley does have his first career 
touchdown [mumbles] to go with his eight interceptions. You’re only as good as 
your last throw though, right? A 28 yard throw to Brown helps the Panthers to 
their own 47. Their running game, so dominant in the first quarter, is slowing 
down though

Just in case you think that the winner of this game is doomed in the playoffs, 
they could be facing Arizona in the postseason. That Ryan Lindley’s Arizona. 
Falcons can’t do anything with the ball and punt. Panthers will start on their 
own 15.

Carolina Panthers 10-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 9:40, 2nd quarter

Benjamin drops another one, his second easy-ish catch of the day. Cam picks up 
the baton though and makes nine yards with his feet. On third and one, though, 
his pass is batted down by Trufant and the Panthers punt. Falcons will start at 
their own 30.

FIELD GOAL! Carolina Panthers 10-3 Atlanta Falcons 10:41, 2nd quarter

INCOMPETENCE ALERT! Di Marco has an area the size of South Sudan to run into 
as he trots towards the end zone. He then attempts to catch the ball with his 
helmet, which is really tricky because helmets don’t have hands. The Falcons 
end the drive with a field goal.

Kuechly then stops some of that momentum with a typically thunderous tackle to 
make it 2nd and 11. Meanwhile, we have an ELITE QUARTERBACK ALERT! The CBS team 
has just confirmed that’s what Ryan is. In response to my snarky comments Ryan 
then wriggles out of a tackle to throw for a first down. And earns millions of 
dollars. And has a thrilling, fulfilling job. So there, me. Ball on the 
Carolina 28.

TOUCHDOWN! Carolina Panthers 10-0 Atlanta Falcons 0:10, 1st quarter

2nd and 4 on the Atlanta five. Newton drifts back, and throws to Dickson who 
bounces over into the endzone. All too easy for the Panthers at the moment.

The Packers lead the Lions 7-0. Meanwhile, in Atlanta ... MORE INCOMPETENCE! 
Hooray! Benjamin drops an easy catch - he would have been away for a touchdwn 
if he’d held on to it.



Thoughts from the Guardian’s very own Jeb Lund on next year’s Draft.
Jeb Lund (@Mobute) 
I hope The Buccaneers draft Jameis Winston and permanently remove that 
periodic sensation I have to root for them.

That’s more like it! Matt Ryan nearly throws a pick: this is the kind of 
ineptitude we expect from the NFC South. Falcons punt and the Panthers take the 
fair catch on, oooh, their own 13.

Matt Ryan starts at the 20. Rather disappointing that the first drive of a 
travesty of a playoff decider actually resulted in points. A field goal, but 
still points. Anyway, Roddy White picks up two receptions and we’re on the 
Carolina 45.

FIELD GOAL! Carolina Panthers 3-0 Atlanta Falcons 8:30, 1st quarter

On 3rd and 9, Cam powers forward but is a yard short of moving the chains. The 
short field goal is good.

Newton is showing no after-effects from that car crash - he sustained back 
fractures in the accident - and picks up 20 yards with his feet. Meanwhile, 
some people aren’t that impressed with Geno’s perfect day. 
We’re on the Atlanta 10 now

Note that Nick offsets his insults with some nice self-deprecation, just in

Carolina Panthers 0-0 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 15:00, 1st quarter

And we’re off in our featured game. The Panthers start at the 20 and they get 
off to a zingy opening with an 18-yard throw to Greg Olsen. He only needs one 
more yard to bring up 1,000 yards for the season. And next play he goes to 
1,007 with an eight-yard reception. A Stewart run takes the ball – and Stewart, 
come to think of it – to the Carolina 47.

An email! “Of course Geno played brilliantly today,” writes Rob Coster. “It 
gives Jets fans just enough hope that things will be different next season 
before he throws nine interceptions in his first game of 2015. And the Jets go 
2-14. And still miss the first pick in the Draft.” In more Jets news, Woody 
Johnson was asked about Rex’s future after the game. “Today’s all about the 
players,” he replied. Which is owner speak for “I feel a firing coming on”.

Rex Ryan is looking very chipper on the sidelines at the Dolphins, they’re 
heading to a 37-24 win over the Dolphins. It’s fairly obvious the players want 
Rex to stay - I think Woody Johnson would be making a big mistake to sack him. 
Geno Smith, meanwhile, has shown that he can pull off big games at quarterback. 
Admittedly in meaningless games.

Right. The Titans have lost to the Colts. They’re now guaranteed the No1 pick 
next year. The Bucks also tank... failed to beat the Saints and with have the 
second pick. The Colts will move up to third seed in the AFC in the unlikely 
event the Steelers and Bengals tie this evening.

Talking of people getting sacked, Justin Houston and JJ Watt both have three 
sacks today - meaning Houston is on course to lead the league this season with 
[does complex maths] 21. Watt is due to end with [does even harder maths

So, what’s happening so far on the final day of the playoffs. Well:

1) The Patriots (a weakened, we’ve rested everyone Patriots, mind) lost to the 
Bills. They had already secured the top seed in the AFC though.

2) San Diego are losing to the Chiefs. With the Ravens currently beating the 
Browns, that means the Ravens would get in at the Chargers expense.

3) The Titans are currently losing comfortably to the Colts, meaning they look 
like they’ve got Marcus Mar... the first pick of the Draft.

4) Geno Smith is actually having a good game for the Jets! He has a perfect 
passer rating and three touchdowns, including a big one to Eric Decker who has 
over 200 yards receiving. Will it be enough to save Rex Ryan’s job? Probably 
not. Hang on? Eric Decker too?

Hello! And welcome to live coverage of two bad teams battling it out to see 
who can pass themselves off as a good team. Neither team can end the season 
with a record above .500 but a victory will send the winner to a home playoff 
game. Where they will be destroyed.


So, who will triumph? Well, despite the Falcons’ struggles this season, Matt 
Ryan has been in good form with 28 touchdowns against 12 interceptions this 
season. His team also looked good while beating the Saints last week. Then 
again, that’s the same Saints who are currently being handed a beating by the 
shambling shambles that are the Bucs.

The Panthers, meanwhile, are on a roll with three victories in a row. Cam 
Newton has recovered from a recent car crash and a wobbly period in October and 
November when he was picked seven times in four games. Still, I think they’ve 
just about got the momentum to carry them through today.

We’ll have a round-up of the day’s games - and playoff picture - in just a 
moment. In the meantime, thanks for your company this evening.

 
There’s some time to play in the remaining games but Seattle look like locks 
for the first seed in the NFC - they’re leading St Louis 20-6 with two mintues 
to go. Green Bay are all but champions of the NFC North - they’re leading the 
Lions 28-14.
 
And the Falcons’ pain continues:

Bad loss and more...bad. Sewage system broke near the Falcons locker room 
inside Georgia Dome.

 <https://twitter.com/BrittMcHenry/status/549355235723182080>  
A completely deserved win for the Panthers, who ran all over the Falcons at 
the start before their defense took control - Ryan was simply given no time to 
set his feet.

 
And that’s it! Carolina Panthers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/carolina-panthers> 34-3 Atlanta Falcons. 
CAROLINA ARE IN THE PLAYOFFS

 
Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 0:50, 4th quarter

On 4th and 9, Toilolo picks up 11 yards and the Falcons continue to fight. 
They just need to score 28 points in a little under a minute. Easy.


 
Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 2:40, 4th quarter

The Panthers go for it on 4th and 8 because, why not? Whittaker’s run is ended 
four-yards short of the first down, much to the annoyance of everyone who wants 
to see this monstrosity of a game end as soon as possible. There are now 14 
people in the crowd, 13 of them Panthers fans, the other person someone who got 
lost on the way to lunch.


 
Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 3:40, 4th quarter

The Panthers amble into Falcons territory. Aaron Rodgers has just crossed for 
a rushing touchdown against the Lions - it looks like the Packers have wrapped 
up the NFC North.


 
Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 5:00, 4th quarter

The Panthers are running everything now - good news for people who still need 
to do their Sunday night laundry after the game finishes.


 
Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 8:00, 4th quarter

So, it’s looking like the Panthers will play the Cardinals next week, who are 
curently losing to the 49ers. You wouldn’t bet against the Panthers at home, 
would you?


 
Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 11:00, 4th quarter

Ryan is sacked on 4th and 18. He’s now been sacked six times on the day. As 
I’m sure you’re all aware, the Falcons are now well E-F-F-E-D


 
Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 11:18, 4th quarter

Right, the Seahawks are now 13-6 up, and it’s difficult to imagine St Louis 
staging a dramatic comeback. The NFC No1 seed looks locked in.


 
Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 12:07, 4th quarter

I would say the Falcons stadium is now 40% full. A good judge of 
probabilities, those Falcons fans. Jones drops a catch in the end zone and the 
stadium is now 39% full.

 
Carolina Panthers 34-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 12:50, 4th quarter

Atlanta rumble up the field, Hester stoops for a catch and suddenly - what’s 
this? - the Falcons are in Panthers territory.

 
This is the first time the Panthers have had two defensive touchdowns in a 
single game. The Falcons play U2 in an attempt to rev their team up. This may 
be one of their problems.

 
The Falcons pick up six yards on 3rd and 8 and they’ll go for it - they don’t 
have much choice. Top marks for aggression, no marks for execution. Ryan is 
AGAIN under pressure and the Panthers get their second defensive TD of the game 
(and year) with an 84-yard interception return.


 
Carolina Panthers 27-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 1:36, 3rd quarter

Ooof. Another near interception from Ryan, he’s hit again and his wobbly throw 
is almost picked off. The Panthers call time out on 2nd and 15 with the Falcons 
on Carolina’s 46.


 
Carolina Panthers 27-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 2:49, 3rd quarter

Seattle are now level with St Louis, amd moving towards No1 seed in the NFC. 
Green Bay, however, are ahead of Detroit. Meanwhile, the Falcons are showing 
some fight. “Showing some fight” in this instance meaning “getting a first 
down”. Julio Jones is the man who earns it with a 20-yard reception. Then, 
ahhhhh, it’s another pick six. No! The comeback is on! It’s pass interference 
and first down to Falcons. The comeback is still on! Maybe.


 
Carolina Panthers 27-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 5:59, 3rd quarter

Cam Newton pretty much has his hands in his pockets and is whistling a jaunty 
tune right now. The tune being “We’re in the playoffs, la-la-la, we’re in the 
playoffs, ha-ha-ha.” Lyrics aren’t his strong point. The Falcons do record a 
three and out though. They’ll start deep in their own territory after a 72-yard 
(woah!) punt.


 
Carolina Panthers 27-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 7:31, 3rd quarter

The Lions have tied the game against Green Bay. Matt Flynn’s not going to stay 
on the field now, right? Falcons are forced to punt. They fail to get into 
Panthers territory again. Ryan just can’t get away from the pressure the 
Panthers’ defense is putting him under.

 

The Falcons stop the Panthers from getting into the end zone, but Carolina 
edge that little bit further towards the playoffs. And they had already gone 
pretty far before that.


 
Worry no longer, Packers fans.

An excellent throw from Newton helps Benjamin past 1,000 yards in his rookie 
season. Not too bad at all. At the other end of the age spectrum, a man old 
enough to be his father - if he matured freakishly early. I mean freakishly 
early - Jerricho Cotchery picks up another 18 yards with a nice catch. We’re on 
the Atlanta 30.

 
Carolina Panthers 24-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 12:20, 3rd quarter

The Panthers start on their own 41. That smell wafting around Cam Newton’s 
nostrils right now is the playoffs.

 
Carolina Panthers 24-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 13:20, 3rd quarter

Good news for the Falcons! They start the second half. Bad news for the 
Falcons! They’re 24-3 down. Worse news for the Falcons! Ryan just got sacked 
and their offensive line appears to be made out of paper! Worst news for the 
Falcons! The paper has blown away! Ryan sacked again! The Falcons will punt.

 
Scores around the NFL:

Carolina 24-3 Falcons

Oakland 7-20 Denver

Detroit 7-14 Green Bay

St Louis 6-0 Seattle

Arizona 17-13 San Francisco

At the moment, by my calculations, the Packers will claim top seed in the NFC 
if scores stay the same. They’d get the bye week, which could come in handy if 
Rodgers’s injury is serious.

 
Carolina Panthers 24-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons>. End of 2nd quarter

The Panthers take no risks going into half-time and rund down the clocks. 
There are boos in the stadium from the Falcons fans.

 
Carolina Panthers 24-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 0:51, 2nd quarter

Third and 6 for the Falcons, looking to score before half-time and keep their 
season alive-ish. Ryan is under pressure though and they’ll have to punt. 
Carolina have all their time outs too and will start on their own 10. 
Meanwhile, bad news for Green Bay:
SI NFL (@si_nfl) 
Rodgers has a calf injury, per the team, and his return is questionable.

Newton burrows, barrels and generally employs lots of other impressive verbs 
starting with B as he gets into the endzone. With plenty of help from his 
offensive line.



 
Carolina Panthers 17-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 1:54, 2nd quarter

Just to make things trickier for themselves, the Falcons give up a penalty and 
start at their own 12. Ryan, who has missed on his last four throws, soon finds 
himself at 3rd and 6. He finds Hester for 12 yards and they continue to brea... 
Ah. White fumbles and the Panthers snaffle the ball. The Falcons may well have 
stopped breathing. But at least they’re going out with the fantastic 
incompetence we’ve come to expect from the NFC South.The play is under review 
but the fumble and recovery stand - the Panthers will start on the Atlanta 5.

 
Falcons pick it up on their own 25 after the Panthers are forced to punt. It 
doesn’t starttoo well, with Ryan sacked. Then gets worse as he throws a pick 
six. Ryan is under huge pressure and Harper takes a stooping catch that he runs 
back to leave the Falcons in deep trouble.

 
Carolina Panthers 10-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 6:07, 2nd quarter

In more positive news for the Cardinals, Lindley does have his first career 
touchdown [mumbles] to go with his eight interceptions. You’re only as good as 
your last throw though, right? A 28 yard throw to Brown helps the Panthers to 
their own 47. Their running game, so dominant in the first quarter, is slowing 
down though


 
Carolina Panthers 10-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 8:11, 2nd quarter

Just in case you think that the winner of this game is doomed in the playoffs, 
they could be facing Arizona in the postseason. That Ryan Lindley’s Arizona. 
Falcons can’t do anything with the ball and punt. Panthers will start on their 
own 15.


 
Carolina Panthers 10-3 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 9:40, 2nd quarter

Benjamin drops another one, his second easy-ish catch of the day. Cam picks up 
the baton though and makes nine yards with his feet. On third and one, though, 
his pass is batted down by Trufant and the Panthers punt. Falcons will start at 
their own 30.

 
INCOMPETENCE ALERT! Di Marco has an area the size of South Sudan to run into 
as he trots towards the end zone. He then attempts to catch the ball with his 
helmet, which is really tricky because helmets don’t have hands. The Falcons 
end the drive with a field goal.


 
Carolina Panthers 10-0 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 11:23, 2nd quarter

Around the league:

Oakland 7-10 Denver, Detroit 0-7 Green Bay, St Louis 3-0 Seattle, Arizona 7-7 
San Fran.

Harry Douglas takes a short throw to the two-yard line. 





 
Carolina Panthers 10-0 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 13:16, 2nd quarter

Kuechly then stops some of that momentum with a typically thunderous tackle to 
make it 2nd and 11. Meanwhile, we have an ELITE QUARTERBACK ALERT! The CBS team 
has just confirmed that’s what Ryan is. In response to my snarky comments Ryan 
then wriggles out of a tackle to throw for a first down. And earns millions of 
dollars. And has a thrilling, fulfilling job. So there, me. Ball on the 
Carolina 28.


 
Carolina Panthers 10-0 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 15:00, 2nd quarter

Hester pulls off some brilliance to give the Falcons some much needed energy, 
pinging off tackles on a 66-yard kickoff return.

 
2nd and 4 on the Atlanta five. Newton drifts back, and throws to Dickson who 
bounces over into the endzone. All too easy for the Panthers at the moment.


 
Carolina Panthers 3-0 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 1:30, 1st quarter

Brown picks up 28 yards on an end around. The Panthers’ running game looks 
good today - they already have 83 rushing yards. Nine more for Cam and they’re 
on the Atlanta 22.


 
Carolina Panthers 3-0 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 3:25, 1st quarter

The Packers lead the Lions 7-0. Meanwhile, in Atlanta ... MORE INCOMPETENCE! 
Hooray! Benjamin drops an easy catch - he would have been away for a touchdwn 
if he’d held on to it.



Thoughts from the Guardian’s very own Jeb Lund on next year’s Draft.

Carolina Panthers 3-0 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 4:57, 1st quarter

That’s more like it! Matt Ryan nearly throws a pick: this is the kind of 
ineptitude we expect from the NFC South. Falcons punt and the Panthers take the 
fair catch on, oooh, their own 13.

 
Carolina Panthers 3-0 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 6:19, 1st quarter

Matt Ryan starts at the 20. Rather disappointing that the first drive of a 
travesty of a playoff decider actually resulted in points. A field goal, but 
still points. Anyway, Roddy White picks up two receptions and we’re on the 
Carolina 45.

 
On 3rd and 9, Cam powers forward but is a yard short of moving the chains. The 
short field goal is good.


 
Carolina Panthers 0-0 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 8:50, 1st quarter

Newton is showing no after-effects from that car crash - he sustained back 
fractures in the accident - and picks up 20 yards with his feet. Meanwhile, 
some people aren’t that impressed with Geno’s perfect day. 
We’re on the Atlanta 10 now

 <https://twitter.com/PlymouthNick/status/549315362660298753> 
Note that Nick offsets his insults with some nice self-deprecation, just in 
case Geno gets upset.

 
Carolina Panthers 0-0 Atlanta Falcons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atlanta-falcons> 15:00, 1st quarter

And we’re off in our featured game. The Panthers start at the 20 and they get 
off to a zingy opening with an 18-yard throw to Greg Olsen. He only needs one 
more yard to bring up 1,000 yards for the season. And next play he goes to 
1,007 with an eight-yard reception. A Stewart run takes the ball – and Stewart, 
come to think of it – to the Carolina 47.

 
An email! “Of course Geno played brilliantly today,” writes Rob Coster. “It 
gives Jets fans just enough hope that things will be different next season 
before he throws nine interceptions in his first game of 2015. And the Jets go 
2-14. And still miss the first pick in the Draft.” In more Jets news, Woody 
Johnson was asked about Rex’s future after the game. “Today’s all about the 
players,” he replied. Which is owner speak for “I feel a firing coming on”.

 
And the Ravens are in the playoffs after they beat the Browns and the Chiefs 
beat the Chargers.
Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) 
Playoffs here we come. https://t.co/fKwUK43HSY <https://t.co/fKwUK43HSY>
 <https://twitter.com/Ravens/status/549312220245786625> December 28, 2014 
<https://twitter.com/Ravens/status/549312220245786625>  
Rex Ryan is looking very chipper on the sidelines at the Dolphins, they’re 
heading to a 37-24 win over the Dolphins. It’s fairly obvious the players want 
Rex to stay - I think Woody Johnson would be making a big mistake to sack him. 
Geno Smith, meanwhile, has shown that he can pull off big games at quarterback. 
Admittedly in meaningless games.

 
Right. The Titans have lost to the Colts. They’re now guaranteed the No1 pick 
next year. The Bucks also tank... failed to beat the Saints and with have the 
second pick. The Colts will move up to third seed in the AFC in the unlikely 
event the Steelers and Bengals tie this evening.

 
Talking of people getting sacked, Justin Houston and JJ Watt both have three 
sacks today - meaning Houston is on course to lead the league this season with 
[does complex maths] 21. Watt is due to end with [does even harder maths 
involving fractions] 20.5.

 
So, what’s happening so far on the final day of the playoffs. Well:

1) The Patriots (a weakened, we’ve rested everyone Patriots, mind) lost to the 
Bills. They had already secured the top seed in the AFC though.

2) San Diego are losing to the Chiefs. With the Ravens currently beating the 
Browns, that means the Ravens would get in at the Chargers expense.

3) The Titans are currently losing comfortably to the Colts, meaning they look 
like they’ve got Marcus Mar... the first pick of the Draft.

4) Geno Smith is actually having a good game for the Jets! He has a perfect 
passer rating and three touchdowns, including a big one to Eric Decker who has 
over 200 yards receiving. Will it be enough to save Rex Ryan’s job? Probably 
not. Hang on? Eric Decker too?

 
Hello! And welcome to live coverage of two bad teams battling it out to see 
who can pass themselves off as a good team. Neither team can end the season 
with a record above .500 but a victory will send the winner to a home playoff 
game. Where they will be destroyed.


So, who will triumph? Well, despite the Falcons’ struggles this season, Matt 
Ryan has been in good form with 28 touchdowns against 12 interceptions this 
season. His team also looked good while beating the Saints last week. Then 
again, that’s the same Saints who are currently being handed a beating by the 
shambling shambles that are the Bucs.

The Panthers, meanwhile, are on a roll with three victories in a row. Cam 
Newton has recovered from a recent car crash and a wobbly period in October and 
November when he was picked seven times in four games. Still, I think they’ve 
just about got the momentum to carry them through today.
