Kyoto is famous for having the most inspirational Japanese gardens in the 
world. For the Japanese, a successful garden is one that represents nature in 
its limited space. Every object has a meaning, every plant significance. But it 
is the atmosphere they create that visitors remark upon far more than the 
detail.

Creating a pure Japanese garden in this country, meanwhile, can be a tall 
order, because it requires a profound understanding of what is, in essence, an 
artform. But if you follow a few basic principles, you are more likely to be 
successful.

A garden should be created in the likeness of nature - the plants, rocks and 
water should echo the shapes and features of the landscape. It should be 
asymmetrical or off-balance - organic shapes are dominant and rigid formality 
is a no-no. Finally, the garden should capture the spirit of its location.

This last point is something that contemporary western garden design has 
picked up on only recently - the idea of blurring inside and out and connecting 
the building with the landscape. With their sliding rice paper screens, or 
shoji, opening up vistas within the house and framing views into the garden and 
beyond like three-dimensional pictures, the Japanese remain the masters of this.
