Both actors, however, are conspicuously absent from the official cast 
photograph, which nonetheless appears to be overseen by a familiar droid. Fans 
will doubtless be reassured by the news that Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony 
Daniels (C3PO) and Kenny Baker (R2D2) will also be returning for action.

We start shooting in a couple of weeks, and everyone is doing their best to 
make the fans proud."

Star Wars: Episode VII is set for worldwide release on December 18 2015.
