METAMORPHABET <http://metamorphabet.com/>

Android/iOS

This wonderful children’s app has been out for a while on iOS, but is new to 
Android <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android>. It’s an interactive 
alphabet designed for touchscreens, with animations illustrating words for 
children as they tap and swipe their way through the letters.

KICKSTARTER <https://www.kickstarter.com/mobile>

Android/iOS

Another app belatedly making its way on to Android, this belongs to 
crowdfunding service Kickstarter. It’s a great way to browse new projects 
trying to raise money, as well as seeing what friends are backing.

MOVESUM <http://movesum.com/>

Android/iOS

There are plenty of apps and gadgets – and often gadgets with apps – for 
tracking your steps and helping you get more active. Movesum is a smart twist, 
showing how many calories your walking has burned, and encouraging you to 
revise your daily goals.

MUSIC MEMOS  <http://www.apple.com/music-memos/>

iOS

A brand new music app from Apple, but for recording songs rather than 
listening to them. Aimed at songwriters of all levels, it helps you record 
songs or short ideas, add a virtual drummer and bassist; tag the clips to find 
them later; then export or share them.

ONCE: ONE MATCH PER DAY <https://getonce.com/>

Android/iOS

Tinder isn’t the only app in town for dating. Once’s schtick is that it 
recommends you one match every day: you can only see one another, with the 
promise of human matchmakers rather than just algorithms helping out.

PLAYLIST A DAY  <http://playlists.net/apps>

Android/iOS

“One a day” is clearly a theme this month. This app comes from Warner Music 
Group, delivering a new music playlist every 24 hours. You’ll need to be a 
paying Spotify subscriber to use it, and expect plenty of Warner’s artists to 
feature.

MILLIE MAROTTA’S COLOURING ADVENTURES 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/millie-marottas-colouring/id1064432319?mt=8>

iOS

Look away now if the trend for adult colouring books gets your goat: this 
takes the idea to iPad. The pictures that you’re colouring are beautiful, 
though: nature images from the work of illustrator Millie’s popular books. 
Other apps do it, but this feels the most like real colouring.

MIMICKER ALARM 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.mimickeralarm&hl=en_GB>


Android


It’s not all work at Microsoft: the tech giant’s experimental apps team has a 
new way for you to wake up. To turn off the app’s alarm clock, you have to 
“mimic” something: from pulling a certain face to saying a certain phrase. 
Silly? A bit, but it does wake you up.

CRASHLANDS <https://www.crashlands.net/>

Android/iOS

Its description as a “crafting RPG” may remind you of Minecraft, but 
Crashlands is a different beast. After crash-landing on an alien planet, you 
have to forage for tools, battle wildlife and build your base while uncovering 
a gripping story. A real treat.

TWOFOLD INC <http://twofoldinc.com/>

Android/iOS

If you like puzzlers but are tiring of the match-three “Saga” formula, Twofold 
Inc is the antidote. It sees you tracing lines of coloured squares with your 
finger to fill up bars at the top of the screen, against increasingly tough 
“moves” limits. Original, and very addictive.

THE WESTPORT INDEPENDENT <http://www.doublezeroonezero.com/westport.html>

Android / iOS

Papers, Please remains one of the most thought-provoking mobile games, and 
this is cut from the same cloth. You edit a newspaper in a “postwar” country 
sliding into dictatorship, and have to swap headlines and censor stories as you 
see fit. Or, if you’re brave, leave them alone …

DOWNWELL <http://downwellgame.com/>

Android/iOS

If you grew up in the era of the Spectrum home computer, Downwell’s retro 
graphics will bring pangs of nostalgia. But even if not, its simple but clever 
falling-down-a-well gameplay will soon cast a spell on you. Power-ups play a 
key role as you play, die and repeat.

EXPLODING KITTENS <http://www.explodingkittens.com/app>

iOS

Exploding Kittens is a quirky card game that was funded to the tune of $8.8m 
on Kickstarter. That success has helped its creators turn it into a mobile 
game, which is just as fun. Be warned: you need two players with it installed 
on their iPhones to even play.

ADVENTURES OF MANA <http://www.jp.square-enix.com/seiken/en/>

Android/iOS

Fans of the Final Fantasy console RPGs have had plenty of chances to play 
older games in the series on their mobile devices. Adventures of Mana is the 
latest remake – of a game that more casual players may not know – and offers a 
colourful slice of RPG history.

COUNTDOWN: THE OFFICIAL APP 
<http://www.itv.com/games/countdown-app-for-iphone-ipad-and-ipod-touch>


Android/iOS


Plenty of people play Countdown on their sofas – by playing along in their 
heads with the TV game show. Now there’s an alternative: this official mobile 
game, with letters and numbers rounds as well as conundrums to solve. It works 
well, including a two-players-on-one-device mode.

POCKET MORTYS 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.turner.pocketmorties&hl=en_GB>

Android/iOS

You’ll get most out of this game if you’re already familiar with Adult Swim’s 
Rick and Morty cartoon, but it’s fun for newcomers too. Unashamedly inspired by 
Pokemon, it’s packed with humour as you catch and train different versions of 
the Morty character.

CIRCA INFINITY <http://circainfinitygame.com/>

iOS

Want a new twist on a platform game? This provides it: your tiny 
stick-character runs and leaps around a series of circles, working your way 
into the centre while avoiding enemies. It seems tough at first, but as you get 
used to the rhythm, it becomes a compelling challenge.

PRIDEFEST <http://pridefestgame.com/>

Android/iOS

An inventive new take on the city-building strategy that’s become a familiar 
genre on mobile. This game, from famous gaming brand Atari, celebrates the 
LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) community, complete with 
Pride festivals as its centrepoints.
