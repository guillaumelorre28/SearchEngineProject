The NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> 111 non-emergency helpline, 
which was criticised this week following the death of a baby from sepsis, is 
under increasing pressure, figures suggest.

NHS England said 111 had seen a huge rise in calls last weekend, up between 
24% and 30% on the same weekend last year.

Just 79.9% of calls were answered within 60 seconds, against a target of 95%. 
NHS England said this was because of the rise in the number of calls handled by 
the helpline on Saturday and Sunday.

The number of emergency admissions to English hospitals has also risen, 
compared with last week, and A&E attendances are also up.

Richard Barker, interim national director of commissioning operations for NHS 
England, said: “As planned for, the recent bad weather has brought a sharp 
increase in A&E attendances and emergency admissions. Despite this, A&E 
performance remains steady. The pressures remain very real, however, and we 
don’t expect those to abate in the run-up to spring.

“This is reflected in the huge rise in calls faced by NHS 111 last weekend – 
up between 24% and 30% on the same weekend last year. Despite this, our 
frontline staff are doing a remarkable job as they continue to provide 
high-quality services to patients.”

The data shows that across England there were 338,287 A&E attendances this 
week at trusts with a major A&E department, up by almost 20,000 on the previous 
week. There were 94,804 emergency admissions, up from 90,813 in the previous 
week.

There were 290,783 calls to 111 in the week ending 24 January, a 13% increase 
on the the previous week. The figure is up 20% on the same week the previous 
year.

Some 66,189 calls were received on Sunday 24 January, (a 23% increase on the 
previous Sunday). Of the calls, 12% had an ambulance dispatched and 8% resulted 
in the person being sent to A&E.

Levels of flu and norovirus remain low, although the number of people having 
their flu vaccine appears to be down compared to the same period last year.

On Tuesday the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, apologised to the family of a 
12-month-old boy who died following a string of NHS failings, saying they had 
been let down in the “worst possible way”.

William Mead died in December 2014 after GPs, out-of-hours services and a 111 
call handler failed to notice that he had sepsis caused by an underlying chest 
infection and pneumonia.

A report found opportunities were missed to save the boy’s life after his 
parents were repeatedly told he just had a cough. Hunt said recommendations 
relating to 111 should be “treated as a national and not a local issue”, and 
changes would be made to the script used by call handlers.

Call handlers on 111 are not medically trained and follow a set series of 
questions to identify patients who need further help.
