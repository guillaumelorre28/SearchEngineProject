Angels and Demons, the prequel to Ron Howard's church-baiting blockbuster The 
Da Vinci Code, is not due in cinemas for almost another month. But the studio 
behind it is already planning a third film in the series based on Dan Brown's 
bestsellers, according to US reports.

Brown's next instalment in the Da Vinci saga, The Lost Symbol, is due to be 
published on 15 September

says Columbia, whose parent company Sony owns the rights to the central 
character of symbologist Robert Langdon, will move smartly to produce the film 
adaptation.

The Da Vinci Code, based on Brown's 2003 novel, grossed $758m worldwide in 
2006, despite damning reviews. Columbia has high hopes for the prequel, which 
once again featuresTom Hanks <https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomhanks> as 
Langdon, with Howard back in the director's chair.

Angels and Demons is based on an earlier book, published in 2000, in which 
Langdon teams up with a beautiful physicist to try to stop a secret society 
called Illuminati from wielding the power of antimatter to destroy the Vatican 
City. The film opens in the UK on 14 May.
