Arrayed on the Ladies’ Day banquet table were yellow-green avocado pear halves 
stuffed with crabmeat and mayonnaise, and platters of rare roast beef and cold 
chicken, and every so often a cut-glass bowl heaped with black caviar. I hadn’t 
had time to eat any breakfast at the hotel cafeteria that morning, except for a 
cup of overstewed coffee so bitter it made my nose curl, and I was starving.

I spent last weekend on the coast in Kent with my sister. I haven’t been to 
the east coast before, apart from what I once glimpsed from an overnight bus on 
a trip to Paris. I am only now aware of quite how much of an oversight this has 
been. This weekend, we took our time exploring woodlands, cliffs, beaches and 
winding country roads. We stayed in a B&B, stretching breakfasts out until they 
could be more accurately defined as lunch, taking long baths every evening and 
reading books – on recommendations after my recipe a fortnight ago I hadmore

 to occupy my time.


On Saturday evening, we found ourselves in Whitstable, hovering outside 
Wheeler’s Oyster Bar. They’re undergoing renovations at the moment, and have 
only four bar stools propped up at the fish counter. They’re booked out weeks 
in advance. But somehow, Luce and I managed to talk our way into a pair of 
seats. I dashed across the road to get a bottle of fizz, and we ate our way 
through oysters, John Dory ceviche with apple and crab, tuna carpaccio and soft 
shell crab in tempura. It was bliss.

It was also the first time I’ve eaten crab since last year, when I made this 
dish from The Bell Jar. After visiting Billingsgate Market last June, and 
taking two live brown crabs home with me for less than £5, I vowed never to buy 
picked crabmeat again. The thing is though; going to Billingsgate is an event. 
It involves getting up before 4am on a Saturday. And now that I’m in South 
London, it’s even more of a faff on public transport. The reason you pay more 
at a fishmonger is because they’re doing the “getting up early and travelling 
on a night bus at dawn” bit for you. So I’m biting the bullet and buying some 
crabmeat, so I can make this very summery salad again.

A couple of tips:

If you’re buying a live crab, I found these instructions 
<https://www.fishforthought.co.uk/Crabs.htm> helpful.

And, to avoid the food poisoning that this dish causes in The Bell Jar, do 
keep your crabmeat in the fridge, rather than under powerful lights.

1 Place your crab upside down on the table in front of you. To get at the 
white meat, twist the legs and claws off the body. Work with them one by one. 
Crack their shells with the hammer, and pull the meat out, then set it aside. 
The claws have a significant amount of meat in them, so make sure you crack 
each part, and use a skewer to get into the crevices.


2 You don’t need the brown meat for this recipe but, to access it, keep the 
crab facing belly-up. Place your thumbs under the base of the centre piece of 
the shell and push up. The body will come out. Discard the white gills and 
scoop out the brown meat. Set aside for use in another recipe.


3 To make the mayonnaise, whisk the egg yolk until thick and creamy. Whisk in 
the lemon juice and mustard, along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Very slowly 
add the oil to the yolk, whisking continuously. Keep your eye on the oil, 
rather than the mayonnaise, and don’t let it pour out too quickly. You just 
want a couple of drops every few seconds. Once the mayonnaise has started to 
thicken, you can pour a little faster. Continue whisking until you have used 
most of the oil and the mayonnaise is very thick.

4 Finely chop the spring onion, parsley and dill. Combine the crabmeat, two 
tablespoons of the mayonnaise and the yoghurt, herbs and spring onion in a 
bowl. Taste for seasoning.

5 Cut the avocado in half, remove the stone and peel off the skin. Take a 
small slice off the base of the avocado, so it will sit on the serving plate 
with a bit of stability. Spoon a generous amount of the crab mixture into the 
hole left by the shell. Squeeze some lemon over the top and serve. With a 
martini, of course.
