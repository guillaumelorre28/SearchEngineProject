Adelaide’s Windmill Theatre <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre> 
creates work for children, families and teenagers, and at the city’s festival 
are performing a trilogy of works created for teenagers; adolescent 
coming-of-age stories with a very distinct aesthetic. The newest of these, Girl 
Asleep, is set on the evening of Greta’s 15th birthday as she struggles to come 
to terms with leaving childhood behind. Here the Windmill team talk to us – and 
their younger selves – about their 15th year, and their memories of it.

Rosemary Myers, director of Windmill Theatre Trilogy and artistic director of 
the company

My 15th year was the year I discovered David Bowie. He represented such a 
mind-altering, gender-bending counter culture and opened a gateway to a world 
way bigger than my family and life in the Melbourne suburbs. I also discovered 
Bob Dylan and The Velvet Underground, and became obsessed with pop art and Andy 
Warhol. It all seemed so subversive and exciting and I loved it.


My friends were my world, my best friend was Penny Chisholm who was in love 
with a guy called Dale Burrows. I loved his best friend, Stuart Johnson; they 
were in year 12 and totally unattainable but my knees literally went weak when 
Stuart would walk past. We used to spend hours fantasizing about us double 
dating.

I would describe myself as quite audacious. I loved drama at school and was 
lucky to have amazing teachers. They took us to see lots of what was the birth 
of the Australian avant-garde at venues like La Mama and the Pram Factory. It 
was a hugely influential time, which unlocked my mind and fed my obsession for 
art and theatre.

Dear 15-year-old me,


The battle of the bands night was probably your best idea yet. Shame about the 
technical difficulties but we got there. Next you’ll have to get cracking on 
the years nine to 11 art exhibition. This may be a problem as we want to have 
it at night so you are going to have to do some major sucking up to the 
teachers…. and your parents.

You should probably pay more attention in maths because no matter what you 
think now you actually use it heaps in your 20s. Who would have thought?

You can already see who of your friends are real and true and hilarious fun, 
so stick with them and you’ll continue to have a blast in high school.

Finally, Weezer, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Counting Crows, Depeche Mode, Stone 
Roses and Queen are perfectly excellent bands to love. Perhaps try listening to 
some classical stuff too. One day you will like country music … you’ll just 
have to deal with this later. :o)

Love, Jude

Jonathon Oxlade, designer Windmill Theatre and Windmill Theatre Trilogy

I can’t really remember a great deal about turning or being 15. I do, however, 
remember spending quite a bit of time in the art block in high school – at 
lunch, and after hours. They had all the stuff there, and I used ALL the stuff 
there. I think I may have even taken some of that stuff home. By mistake. For 
projects. I loved art, I loved making marks and I think for a time it really 
obsessed me. Still kind of does.


I was very good friends with a girl called Maria, who used to collect garden 
gnomes. Well, she would steal them and put them in her own backyard, a shrine 
to all of the made-up concrete creatures in the neighbourhood. It was her art. 
This “art” was a bit of a thing where I grew up in Capalaba, Brisbane. Heaps of 
people would decorate their front yards with gnomes, deer, Santas, wizards, 
frogs, wizard-frogs, wizard-santa-frogs. Kinda spooky.

Maria’s parents just thought she was using her own money (from working at 
Bakers’ Delight) to fuel her art. In one haul we “obtained” a fully painted 1m 
high concrete dad-gnome that had two kid-gnomes attached. It probably weighed 
as much as me (a very skinny 40kg) and was almost impossible to move. We lost 
one of the kids on Currumbin avenue when we dropped the family on the curb.

I guess I do remember a bit.

Wow. Hello. Fancy meeting you here. How’s it going, 15-year-old me? Where to 
begin? This should be easy – we’re the same person, after all. But you would be 
surprised how much you have changed.


We look similar, but probably not as much as you would think. Yes, Supre does 
still exist, but these days I prefer to not get around in a fluro mini with 
matching bike pants. Word of advice from future you: don’t throw away those 
1980s pantsuits you found at the op shop. You will regret this for the rest of 
your days.

Music? Ah yes. I hate to tell you that your Pixies/Nirvana cover band will 
never reach the dizzying heights you hoped it would. Perhaps consider getting a 
bass player … or actually learn to play the guitar properly. This may help.

Important things for the next few years: stop stressing out all the time. In a 
few short years you will be free of your adolescence and well on your way to 
having a ridiculously good time as an adult. There are lots of adventures ahead 
(but they’re for you to discover on your own).

Just whatever you do, don’t throw away those 80s pantsuits.

A made-up but quite accurate representation of a page from my personal diary 
on the eve of turning 15


Today is the 364th day of me being 14. It’s been a good ride but 15 is gonna 
be amazing! Stuff I’ve liked while being 14:

* Jazz. I LOVE jazz and refuse to believe that any other genre of music 
exists. It’s jazz or nothin’. That other stuff is rubbish. I shall name my 
first born The Count. Or Duke. Note to self: must find a boyfriend. Another 
note to self: wait until after 15 to breed. No one likes a hussy.

* Old school movies. Using all of my year nine debating skills, I convinced 
the parents that it was in the interest of my drama education to watch every 
midday matinee movie and so always got out of Saturday chores - much to the 
chagrin of my brother.

* Mum and dad selling the service station. Having to be there every day after 
school since prep has driven me nuts. But I will never forget the looks on the 
other kids’ faces when dad’s head mechanic Phil would pick me up from school – 
a) because he’s a scary looking bikie (with a heap of tatts and a heart of 
gold) and b) because he drives a hearse.

So, 15. You’ve got a lot to live up to. Game on.

Dear 15-year-old Eamon,


I know you’re sitting in a demountable building on the Gold Coast, staring at 
a blackboard full of maths. And you just don’t get it. Despite your seats being 
forcefully allocated at opposite sides of the classroom, your best mate Damo is 
texting you on your Nokia 3310 (from his Nokia 3310) about how good the party 
was on Saturday night.

Remember? How good was it when we convinced everyone on the back balcony at 
2am that you were possessed after a misguided attempt at the ouija board? 
Apparently, your acting skills were so good, so convincing, that our petrified 
friend Amanda freaked out and screaming, started squirting lemon juice in your 
eyes to “wake you up”. See, already suffering for your art.

I know you’re now in class, planning and hoping for the weekend. And you’ll 
have great ones. You’ll also have tough ones. You’re sitting there wondering 
what lies outside the Gold Coast, and if you’ll see it. If you want to.

But most of all you’re hoping that you get to do all the things you dream of 
doing. You’re also scared of leaving these friends and this place. But you have 
to. You have to be brave enough to chase what you dream of.
