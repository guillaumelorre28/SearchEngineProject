Innovation is often cited as an enabler of sustainable development. Donors, 
NGOs and governments support new initiatives and technologies to reach the 
millions who lack access to water and sanitation, and a number of prizes and 
challenges encourage entrepreneurs to develop solutions to the same problems.


But does the water, sanitation and hygiene sector (Wash) need such innovation? 
“There isn’t much that needs improvement about having a tap connected to mains 
water and using a toilet that flushes into a sewer,”says Remi Kaupp, urban 
sanitation specialist at WaterAid 
<http://www.wateraid.org/news/blogs/2015/november/does-the-wash-sector-need-innovation>
. “The main ingredients needed to achieve universal water and sanitation 
coverage are well known, and they are not glamourous.”


The problem, it seems, is equating innovation and invention. “I think the 
technologies [we need] exist today,” says Jayanthi Iyengar of Xylem. “What we 
need is innovation around how we speed up their implementation, and how we 
unlock financial opportunities for local communities or countries.” Indeed, new 
approaches to financing access to water and sanitation, such as levies and 
development impact bonds,are gaining traction as solutions

 in the sector.


So where is innovation needed most? What are the interesting inventions that 
work? How can obstacles to innovation be addressed? And how can we ensure that 
any new initiatives are meaningful and do not cover the same ground as others?
