Nirmala is proud to have been elected treasurer of her microcredit group, but 
the role brings great responsibility. Each month, she must collect savings and 
balance the books. Microcredit works by encouraging village groups to pay small 
amounts into a collective pot. The money is then doubled with a grant from an 
agency such as Find Your Feet. It is up to the group to decide who to lend to. 
Families put forward proposals and a vote is taken to decide whether to back 
it. It is Dragons' Den on a community level.

When the group first formed three years ago, each of the 17 members paid in 20 
rupees a month. It is a measure of how successful their loans have been in 
stimulating employment that they recently voted to increase their contributions 
each month to 50 rupees.

The group is all female, and at first the men were sceptical. Now, it has 
transformed the way the men see their wives. Nirmala tells me: "Now they treat 
us with more importance. Before this, we had no say and were not valued. We 
were like insects."

Now, when Nirmala speaks about the future it is with hope. A loan helps her 
children get a good education, and in time she thinks even the politicians will 
change. "All the political parties come here and make big promises, but after 
the election they just disappear. So what hope can we have?" She smiles. 
"Perhaps if we put all our efforts into educating our own children they can 
become ministers. Then we'll be able to get rid of all our problems."
