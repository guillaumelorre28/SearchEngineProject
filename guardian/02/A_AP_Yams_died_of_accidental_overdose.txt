Yams, whose real name was Steven Rodriguez, operated behind the scenes in A$AP 
Mob, but played a crucial role in A$AP Rocky’s stardom. A 2013 profile in the 
New York Times observed: “Much of what you hear in Rocky — a fully assimilated 
take on hip-hop styles from across the country and from across time periods — 
can be traced back to Yams.”

The hip-hop world was shocked by the death, with stars including the Weeknd, 
Drake, Mac Miller and Azealia Banks paying tribute. “ASAP YAMS should be 
remembered as a leader, an innovator and most importantly as an important part 
of NYC youth culture,” Banks wrote on Twitter.
