In 2008, Tatyana Novikova bought a wooden house near the border between 
Belarus andLithuania <https://www.theguardian.com/world/lithuania>. She chose 
the area carefully, she says. It’s next to a lake, untouched by industry and – 
crucially for the mathematician who worked on contamination models in the 
aftermath of Chernobyl – unaffected by the fallout from the world’s worst 
nuclear disaster in 1986.

But six months after she bought her dream home, Belarus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/belarus> announced that a new nuclear power 
station, financed by Russia, would be built nearby in Ostrovets.

“I’m completely devastated,” says Novikova, who says the government bypassed 
official planning regulations, ignored safety concerns and failed to carry out 
an adequate environmental impact assessment for the plant.

Her experience with Chernobyl, when radioactive contamination 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/04/-sp-the-long-shadow-of-chernobyl>
 forced around 350,000 people to leave their homes and led to an unknown number 
of deaths, have left her cautious about nuclear power and distrustful of 
government safety promises.

“Another Chernobyl cannot happen,” she says. 

Novikova has appealed to international environmental authorities to try to 
stop the NPP project, without any success. In the meantime authorities have 
already started work on construction.

"The problem is that [Belarusian president Alexander] Lukashenko does not give 
his citizens a voice," she says.

In a country which does not tolerate activism or public protest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/09/-sp-belarus-remains-revolution-behind>
 – the annual Chernobyl anniversary marches she organises often end in arrests 
– Novikova has taken her opposition abroad.

She is in London to raise awareness about the issue and hopes to spur the EU 
to put pressure on Belarus, as the plant would be 60km from Vilnius, the 
capital of Lithuania.

A group of Belarusian activists, including the theatre company Belarus Free 
Theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/20/belarus-free-theatre-battling-dictatorship-twitter>
, have launched a petition against the power station – and have won support 
from some high-profile figures:
Stephen Fry (@stephenfry) 
Another Chernobyl?! No thanks! Join me - sign petition to block dodgy new 
nuclear plant in Belarushttp://t.co/lHTUIP09lp <http://t.co/lHTUIP09lp>
 <https://twitter.com/stephenfry/statuses/482091285533454336> June 26, 2014 
<https://twitter.com/stephenfry/statuses/482091285533454336> 
The petition cites several problems with the plant:


 * Construction was started before design plans were in place, and before a 
license had been issued

 * The design is experimental and has not been properly tested

 * An assessment by more that 15 independent experts found gaping holes in the 
government's environmental impact assessment 
Novikova says the plans flaunt international regulations; Belarus is a 
signatory of theEspoo 
<http://www.rac.org.ua/en/priorities/compliance/belarus-nuclear-power-plant-and-espoo-convention/>
 andAarhus 
<http://aarhusclearinghouse.unece.org/resources/www.madridparticipa.org/?sortby=da&c=&c=1000006&c=&c=1000035>
 conventions, which specify environmental protections and monitor requirements 
such as public consultations over construction projects.

She approached the Aarhus committee in Maastricht in June, asking them to 
prevent the power plant because Belarus had violated the convention by not 
discussing the issue with concerned citizens. The committee came back to her 
with bad news; they would only issue what she calls a "caution of a caution" to 
Belarus, believing the government wouldn't listen anyway.


"Lukashenko says [the plant] is important for energy security," she says. "But 
if technology is so advanced, why not solve [the problem of] nuclear waste? We 
could improve our energy system by modernising gas plants, or using bioenergy 
from agriculture."

Presidential elections next year won’t change anything, she says, although she 
is hopeful that the conflict in Ukraine might change the politics of the region 
and ultimately loosen Lukashenko's power: "We and Ukraine have the same problem 
– [the Russian president, Vladimir] Putin."

The proposed new plant in Belarus will be funded by Russia. Belarus's official 
cost estimate is9.4 billion US dollars 
<http://www.nuclear-heritage.net/index.php/Ostrovets_NPP>, with one third of 
this to be spent by 2015. Its reactors would be constructed by the Russian 
company AtomEnergoMash.

Novikova is critical of the EU for not clamping down on nuclear power in the 
wake of the Fukishima nuclear disaster of 2011, and points out that some 
countries are steering away from nuclear energy. "Germany is phasing out of 
nuclear power; it produced 50% of all electricity generation from more 
renewable sources last year. The Italians said no in their nuclear referendum."

Like many Belarusian activists, Novikova has faced severe harassment. She was 
detained in her own home in Minsk during anti-nuclear protests. Her elderly 
mother has received prank calls which the police confirmed came from the KGB. 
In Russia, she was arrested and jailed for five days for trying to hand in an 
environmental petition to the Russian embassy.


She was also was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2011, and can't tell if she 
was contaminated from radiation exposure from Chernobyl. The WHO says the
disaster will cause 50,000 new cases of the cancer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/04/-sp-the-long-shadow-of-chernobyl>
 among young people living in the worst-affected region. Increased rates of
thyroid cancer are also being reported in Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/09/fukushima-children-debate-thyroid-cancer-japan-disaster-nuclear-radiation>
, post-Fukushima.

But she refuses to dwell on her own problems: "I’m still alive. Mine is not 
the worst case of persecution of people."


"What should I do? Stop my fight? I lost my health, now I have lost my house," 
she says. "Why should I run from this problem? I could go to the US orEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, but it won’t change if I run – 
maybe I will, if my life will be in danger. Nobody knows. Right now, I have an 
opportunity to do something."

• This article was amended on 29 July to make clear that Belarus had not 
violated the Aarhus convention 'by not obtaining official planning permission', 
in Tatiana Novikova's eyes, but by 'not discussing the issue with concerned 
citizens'.
