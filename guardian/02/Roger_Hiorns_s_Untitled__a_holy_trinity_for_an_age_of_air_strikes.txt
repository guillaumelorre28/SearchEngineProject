The power of three

This work from the sculptor’s Youth series has three distinct elements in 
play: the brutal military engine, the delicate naked young man and the 
flickering flame.

Light my fire

In this sculpture-cum-performance, a simple series of ritualistic actions are 
followed: the youth undresses, sets and lights the fire, and then sits either 
watching the flame or watching his audience until the fire goes out.

Holy hell

There’s a piercing clarity of vision to the trinity: a sort of father, son and 
holy ghost for our age of military surveillance and air strikes. As with 
depictions of the crucifixion, here we have death and beauty hand in hand with 
one another.

The crystal world

Typically for the British sculptor, there’s a dance going on between the 
seemingly invincible and the mortal and pliable, where loveliness tips into 
decay. He is best known for dumping 75,000 litres of copper sulphate into a 
condemned council flat in Elephant & Castle, creating a glittering blue crystal 
grotto that would slowly lose its shine.

Eternal flame

While the boy’s skin is in precarious contrast with the metallic engine, its 
pipes, cylinders and motors unavoidably call to mind the vulnerable human 
organs that pulse and flutter beneath his exposed flesh.
