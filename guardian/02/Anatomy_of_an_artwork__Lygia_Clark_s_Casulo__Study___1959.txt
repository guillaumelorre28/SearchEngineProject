Escaping

With her Casulo (Cocoon) series of folded metal sculptures – of which this is 
one example – the Brazilian artist took her first radical escape from the flat 
plane of the canvas, while retaining much of the geometric abstraction of her 
earlier paintings.

Architectural

The work demands interaction: to fully appreciate its multifaceted nature, 
viewers have to move around it and peek inside. In this way it is 
architectural, possessing both an interior and an exterior.

Interaction

This sculpture marks not just an important moment in Clark’s career but in the 
development of the neo-concretist movement, a defining school of thought in the 
Brazilian avant garde during the postwar era. It called for the viewer’s 
interaction and sensitivity to activate a work.

Emergence

Clark was a major figure in Brazilian art as it emerged from the shadow of 
European modernism. The exhibition that this work is taken from focuses on her 
output during the 50s, a key period in that revolution.

Transition

Here we see how Clark came to achieve the kineticism of her later Bicho 
series. To this angular complexity she added hinges, allowing the viewer to 
reshape and reimagine her pieces at will.
