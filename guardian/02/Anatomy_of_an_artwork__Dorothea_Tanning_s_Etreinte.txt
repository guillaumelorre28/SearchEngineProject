Super furry

Fashioned from fake fur and peach flannel, Tanning’s 1969 “soft sculpture” 
resembles a nudist grappling with a Wookiee. But that initial impression belies 
its yin yang elegance: this is ego and id as beauty and the beast. Like her 
paintings of giant lapdogs (a recurring motif) and naked young women, its 
teddy-bear hide suggests a domestic world where desire finds odd outlets and 
fetishes take hold.

The grande dame

Tanning, who died aged 101 in 2012, has been dubbed the last of the 
surrealists. She brought a feminine edge to the dream worlds pioneered by her 
New York circle, which included André Breton, Salvador Dalí and her husband Max 
Ernst.

Let’s dance

There’s a balletic swirl to Etreinte, a form Tanning was well versed in, 
having created costume sketches for the choreographer George Balanchine.

Softly, softly

It was the experimental daring of a Stockhausen concert that inspired Tanning, 
whose paintings often featured surreal attire, to turn to actual cloth. Fabric 
was the opposite of the traditional boys’ club materials of hard bronze and 
stone. Typically worn next to the body, its sensuous quality was perfect for 
her explorations of sex and the psyche.
