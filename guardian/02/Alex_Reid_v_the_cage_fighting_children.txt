Lost in Showbiz finds itself profoundly shocked by the video of those 
cage-fighting kiddies in Preston 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/21/eight-year-old-children-cage-fight-preston?newsfeed=true>
. It's not so much that they're eight years old, surrounded by baying adults 
and uninterested paramedics, and that one of them is crying. It's that the tape 
has allowed Alex Reid to disport himself as a news pundit.

There he was, the former Mr Katie Price, giving his expert medical view on Sky 
News

 yesterday. Eamonn Holmes actually got through the entire interview without 
once stopping, ripping out his earpiece, and telling viewers: "I'm sorry, I've 
just realised I'm conducting a serious interview with someone given to wearing 
gold mankinis to promote his ex-wife's novels. If you'll excuse me, I'm off to 
kill and eat my producer."

A pattern appears to be forming. Barely a fortnight ago, a reader tweeted me 
to say he'd just seen Reid outside Portcullis House in Westminster, where it 
turned out he'd been asked as the guest of Tory MP Daniel Poulter, to help 
launch his Better Breakfast campaign. The Reidernator's traction on the public 
discourse is clearly strengthening by the day. How long before he is linked 
with the Question Time job?
