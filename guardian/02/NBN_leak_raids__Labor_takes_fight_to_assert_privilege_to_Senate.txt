Conroy’s letter, sent on Tuesday, says the scope of the privilege claim 
“extends to all words spoken, and acts done, in the course of, or for the 
purposes of, or incidental to, parliamentary proceedings”.

The letter also makes plain that Labor intends to pursue the privilege claim 
in the Senate as opposed to pursuing a court action.

Conroy tells Colvin in the correspondence he intends to write to the clerk of 
the Senate, Rosemary Laing, “to commence an action to seek a ruling from the 
Senate on the claim”.

He says his expects the material “to remain in the clerk’s possession until 
the Senate rules on my privilege claim”.

The documents seized during the raids have been sealed in the parliament since 
alegal wrangle with the AFP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/20/labor-furious-that-nbn-staff-member-sent-photos-of-police-raid-to-colleagues>
 ended last Friday.

Colvin has publicly acknowledged the claim of privilege. He told reporters 
last week the documents would be lodged in the Senate “and a process will be 
put into play by the parliament to determine if parliamentary privilege is 
afforded to those documents”.

Colvin said last week that although the claim has been made, it does not 
necessarily follow that privilege will be granted.

“It is not necessarily the case that parliamentary privilege will be afforded 
to those documents,” he said at the time.

The AFP had no further comment when contacted by Guardian Australia on Tuesday.

Conroy’s decision to punt the resolution of this issue into the parliament, as 
opposed to the courts, means there is a strong likelihood that senators will 
have to vote on whether privilege should apply or not after the coming election.

The process for resolving the issue is not yet clear, but options would 
include the chamber voting on a resolution to appoint an independent arbiter to 
determine whether privilege applies or not; or voting on a reference to 
parliament’s powerful privileges committee to determine the merits of the issue.

A spokesman for the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/richard-di-natale>, said the party 
would not adopt a formal position on the issue before a party room discussion 
after the election.

The South Australian senator Nick Xenophon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/nick-xenophon> strongly backed 
Conroy’s move to push resolution of the issue back to the Senate.

Xenophon told Guardian Australia the Senate was there to act as a check on the 
“excesses of the executive” and he would be urging all parliamentary 
colleagues, including members of theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, to vote in favour of 
this issue being determined by the Senate.

“It must be determined by the Senate. This is not about politics. This is 
about the Senate being able to go about its business,” he said on Tuesday.

Pushing the issue back in the parliament will force a more wide-ranging 
discussion about the obligations politicians have to whistleblowers who produce 
material on a confidential basis to assist questioning during parliamentary 
inquiries.

Conroy’s letter to Colvin is required by processes determined in a memorandum 
of understanding between the parliament and police about the execution of 
warrants where parliamentary privilege may be involved.
