One lucky author will receive the Man Booker prize tonight 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booker-prize>, walking away with £50,000.

The award began in 1968 when Booker McConnell Ltd, a firm "dealing in sugar, 
rum, mining machinery, and James Bond", announced a £5,000 prize for fiction to 
be awarded to a British or Commonwealth author. WL Webb, the Guardian's 
literary editor at the time, was one of five judges.

 announcing the award in 1968 
The inaugural winner, in April 1969, was PH Newby, a BBC controller, for his 
work Something to Answer For.In an interview with the Guardian 
<http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/7/1344358174951/Booker-prize-1969-001.jpg>
 when the prize was announced, he said that he might "build a new study" with 
his winnings.

The Booker has been mired in controversy almost from the beginning. In 
November 1972, winning authorJohn Berger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/john-berger> protested against Booker 
McConnell's activities in the Caribbean by donating half of his £5,000 prize to 
the British Black Panther movement.

).

Perhaps the biggest literary battle came in October 1980, when William Golding 
(Rites of Passage) squared off againstAnthony Burgess 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/anthonyburgess> (Earthly Powers). Burgess 
refused to attend the ceremony unless he could be guaranteed a win. He 
couldn't, and Golding triumphed on the night.

In 1981, nominee John Banville <https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnbanville>
 wrote a letter to the Guardian requesting that the prize be given to him 
forthwith; with the prize fund he would buy every copy of the longlisted books 
in Ireland and donate them to libraries, "thus ensuring that the books not only 
are bought but also read - surely a unique occurence." Sadly the judges didn't 
comply, but he did win in 2005, for The Sea.

 John Banville's letter to the Guardian in full 
As the prize grew, so did its influence on sales, particularly once the 
ceremony was televised. With popularity came ridicule, as in this cartoon from 
1980.

A leading article in 1984 called for "a year of wit and dexterity and literary 
larking", for a winner to be judged on "pure enjoyment" rather than "assumed 
grandeur".

By 1994, the tide had turned and the Booker was losing credibility, Richard 
Gott describing the prize as "a significant and dangerous iceberg in the sea of 
British culture that serves as a symbol of its current malaise."

The 2011 shortlist, denounced by some as "too readable" 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/oct/16/booker-prize-cricitism-andrew-motion>
, prompted the announcement of a newLiterature prize 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2011/oct/13/man-booker-prize-fresh-challenger>
, to be awarded to more literary works.

More recent shortlists have returned to more literary ground; who will be next 
to join the list of greats is, until tonight at least, anybody's guess.
