The Ashton Kutcher-starring biopic of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/stevejobs> has rather dropped off the 
radar after its premiere at Sundance - but now it's poked its head above the 
parapet as its August release date nears.

Fittingly, for the life story of a tech pioneer, Jobs-the-film has found a way 
to break a little ground itself. Its new 15-second teaser trailer is the first 
ever to debut on picture-oriented social networking appInstagram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram>, which only began sharing 
video a month ago.

So what do you think? is this the wave of the future, or a road to nowhere?
