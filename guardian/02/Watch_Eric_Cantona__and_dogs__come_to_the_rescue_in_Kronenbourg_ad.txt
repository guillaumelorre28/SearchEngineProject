Currys PC World: ‘Box Room’ (starts at 01:08) - UK

The Christmas commercials for Currys PC World featuring Jeff Goldblum 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8k2ZtzpMns> have been picking up lots of 
advertising awards so agency AMV/BBDO are determined to maintain the comedy 
momentum. No Hollywood star for this advert pushing new TVs ahead of the 
European Championships this summer but plenty of laughs nonetheless.

Co-op: ‘BBQs’ (starts at 01:51) - Switzerland

With the sun finally shining after a dismal spring, we can all enjoy the 
prospect of renewing our relationship with charred sausages as we gather around 
the family barbecue to watch dad behave as though he’s just discovered fire. 
This lovely Swiss commercial imagines barbecues returning from warmer climes 
and bringing joy into all our lives.

P&G: ‘Rio’ (starts at 03:13) - US

Don’t panic when you watch this advert for P&G ... you haven’t forgotten 
Mother’s Day. It’s on a different date in the US and this emotional commercial 
is designed to make us all appreciate what our mums do by depicting how 
maternal devotion gave this summer’s Olympians the self-belief they need to win 
gold medals. Not all of them obviously, most will go home with nothing... but 
their mothers will still love them!
