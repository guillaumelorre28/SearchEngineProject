<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kellan-lutz-taryn-manning-anton-715764> 
actor William Shatner in Experimenter, a biopic about psychologist Stanley 
Milgram.

In Milgram's famous 1961 experiment exploring obedience, ordinary members of 
the public were made to inflict what they believed were painful electric shocks 
to other human subjects. In thrall to the orders of those leading the 
experiments, many participants ended up administering major shocks of 450 volts 
to the subjects, even when they could hear screams of pain – though in reality, 
there were no shocks being administered.

Shatner portrayed Milgram in a 1970s TV movie, hence his appearance in the 
film, while Milgram himself will be played by Peter Saarsgard. Other cast 
members include Winona Ryder,Anton Yelchin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/anton-yelchin>, and Taryn Manning as a 
rebellious participant. Its director is Michael Almereyda, who is still best 
known for his film version of Hamlet starring Ethan Hawke in 2000; he and 
Hawke, along with Yelchin, are returning to Shakespeare in a forthcoming 
adaptation of Cymbeline, co-starring Dakota Johnson and Milla Jovovich.

Lutz meanwhile, who played one of the vampiric Cullen clan in the Twilight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/twilight> movies, continues to portray alpha 
males: as well as recently voicing Tarzan and taking the lead in Renny Harlin's 
The Legend of Hercules, he also completed filming on the forthcoming 
Expendables 3 alongside a raft of 80s beefcake.
