The Irish secretary of the National Union of Journalists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/nationalunionofjournalists>, Séamus Dooley, 
has given a guarded welcome to what the union believes are “lamentably late” 
draft guidelines covering media ownership in Ireland.

The guidelines, as I noted yesterday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/dec/08/ireland-to-introduce-cross-media-ownership-rules>
, will not be retrospective and therefore cannot alter the current media 
landscape in Ireland.

In a lengthy statement, Dooley said: “Since the acquisition of Independent 
Newspapers <https://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers> by Tony O’Reilly in 
1974 the NUJ has been demanding greater vigilance by the state in ensuring 
media plurality, in terms of ownership and editorial control.

“While we welcome the publication of today’s consultation document the words 
‘horse’ ‘door’ and ‘bolted’ spring to mind... We have witnessed the transfer of 
power from one baron to another in the face of appalling political cowardice.”

The post-O’Reilly baron is a reference to Denis O’Brien, the biggest 
shareholder in Ireland’s largest newspaper publisher, Independent News & Media 
(INM), and through his company, Communicorp, also Ireland’s largest commercial 
radio owner.

Dooley is concerned about “the narrow time frame for consultation” on the 
draft guidelines. Submissions must be made by 22 January 2015.

But he said that “from an initial reading there is little in the guidelines 
that will disturb the tranquillity of dominant media players.”

 He complains that the communications minister, Alex White, “has been given 
the task of introducing checks and balances after the harm has been done.”

 Dooley continues: “Successive governments have allowed a small group of 
powerful people to gain control of the media and the draft is incapable of 
undoing that damage.

“That said, the emphasis on the public interest and the recognition of the 
importance of plurality, diversity and editorial structures, rather than just 
competitive factors, is to be welcomed.”

The NUJ believes there is a need for a wider public debate on editorial 
control of the media. Dooley said: “We need to look at editorial structures and 
how economic control is exercised, we need to look at training, at employment 
standards and at access to journalism, including the issues of gender and 
ethnic origin.

“This could best be achieved by an independent commission on the future of the 
media inIreland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland>.”

The draft guidelines can be found here

 on the department’s website. They will apply across print, broadcast and 
online.
