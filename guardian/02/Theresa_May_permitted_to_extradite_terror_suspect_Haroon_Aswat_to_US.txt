The home secretary, Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay>, has been given the go-ahead 
to extradite the terror suspect Haroon Aswat to the United States, following a 
high court hearing in London.

Earlier this year, judges had put extradition plans on hold, saying they 
wanted US government assurances about the way Aswat, who is mentally ill, would 
be treated.

But on Thursday they said Aswat – who comes from Batley in West Yorkshire, and 
is wanted for allegedly conspiring with the convicted terroristAbu Hamza 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-hamza> to establish a jihadi training 
camp in Oregon – could be sent to America for trial.

The judges heard that Aswat, thought to be in his late 30s, had been 
transferred from prison to a psychiatric hospital in 2008, suffering from 
paranoid schizophrenia.

Aswat's lawyers argued that he might be held in a "supermax" American jail.

At a high court hearing in April, judges decided that Aswat might suffer

 if he was held in prison.

They said they wanted assurances that he would be held in a psychiatric 
referral centre pending examination by doctors.

Hamza, who is in his 50s, was extradited from Britain to America nearly two 
years ago and found guilty of terrorism charges in May after a trial in New 
York.

Two judges – Lord Thomas, the lord chief justice, and Mr Justice Mitting – on 
Thursday said they were satisfied with assurances given by American government 
officials about the way Aswat would be treated prior to and during any trial.

Thomas said Aswat could be extradited in accordance with arrangements made.
