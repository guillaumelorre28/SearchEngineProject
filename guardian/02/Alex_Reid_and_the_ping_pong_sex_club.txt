. It doesn't stand in judgment on other people's peccadilloes: whatever gets 
you through the night, to paraphrase the late John Lennon, is all right with 
Lost In Showbiz. And thus we come to his latest pronouncement. As part of the 
round of interviews that Lost in Showbiz likes to think of as Alex Reid's Tour 
Of Dignity, he related that, while on honeymoon, he and his ex-wife Katie Price 
visited something he referred to as a "ping pong sex club". By this, it assumes 
he means one of those places in Thailand where women perform tricks with their 
pelvic muscles. Lost in Showbiz looks at him fondly and asks: what could be 
more soppy and romantic? Here we are presented with the soft-focus image of a 
couple that celebrated their lifelong commitment to each other by going to 
watch a woman – who,according to a report by the Pulitzer Centre 
<http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/untold-stories/price-sexual-torture-usd-181month>
, probably earned around £115 a month and had likely been trafficked from Laos 
or Cambodia – fire things out of her vagina. Given that start, who could have 
predicted their union would flounder so soon?
