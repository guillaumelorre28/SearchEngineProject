In a ramshackle air hangar in a windswept field on the east coast of Scotland, 
Bernard Ginty, 83, is frowning in concentration at an intricate wooden carving.

“They were an absolute devil to get right,” he says. “But everything has to be 
exact. We can’t afford any mistakes.”

The tiny carving is actually a wing part for a magnificent replica of one of 
the first ever first world war fighter planes, the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, 
designed to counter the German air threat and defend the British coastline from 
enemy attack.

 More than 2,750 other such parts form what amounts to a huge Airfix kit of 
the plane, currently under construction in the hangar of the National Museum of 
Flight in East Fortune, East Lothian. For 13 years, Ginty and his fellow 
volunteers have devoted their time to rebuilding the 1½ Strutter piece by 
piece. Next year, on the 100th anniversary of its maiden flight, the men hope 
their Strutter will take to the skies.

 Aged between 68 and 93, the 13 volunteers must be among the oldest 
self-educated aeronautical engineers in the world. Their skillset ranges from 
metal work and carpentry to draughtsmanship and radar expertise, though some 
were simply Meccano enthusiasts as children.

Speaking from their hangar, Ginty explains: “Our goal is to have the aircraft 
flying by next year. Most men when they retire don’t have giant toys like this 
to play with. I consider us extremely fortunate to have a place to indulge our 
hobbies– and decent wives for putting up with us.

Tom Ferguson, a retired Ferranti radar expert, first offered his services as 
an engineer: “The aircraft had to be built to certain specifications and 
regulations and I told the boys I would follow the paper trail to keep them on 
track. But I got fed up sitting on my bottom and seeing them doing the exciting 
work. So now I do a bit of everything.” At 82, he still fully intends to test 
out the plane when it goes up in the air: “If we haven’t got the confidence to 
go up in it, we can’t have the confidence to build it.”

The team had already spent many years as members of the Aviation Preservation 
Society of Scotland <http://www.apss.org.uk/> restoring historic planes such as 
Tiger Moths, Spitfires and Vulcan bombers for the museum when a former curator 
suggested they turn their skills to a working replica of a first world war 
biplane.

Initially they looked at the Blériot, built by a Frenchman of the same name 
and the first heavier-than-air plane to cross the Channel in 1909. But the 
unwieldy craft was notoriously tricky to fly and cost many lives in development.

The 1½ Strutter, which spawned the famous Sopwith Camel – the machine that 
felled the Red Baron, the German flying ace Manfred Von Richthofen – was the 
next obvious choice, especially given its historical links to the region.The 1½ 
Strutter was piloted for many years in East Fortune, near Edinburgh, to protect 
the Royal Navy base in Rosyth, the Forth rail bridge and the Scottish capital 
from attack. It was the first plane ever to be launched from an aircraft 
carrier.

Ginty says: “We have had to learn skills that aircraft builders would have 
used 100 years ago and there was no one to ask if we were doing it right. We 
used historical drawings from 1916.”

A particular challenge has been finding parts that were often discontinued 
decades ago. Ken Sharpe, 72, a former power station engineer, says: “When it 
was impossible to source these things, we often had to learn how to make them 
ourselves, to start a little manufacturing line in our garden sheds. Every step 
was a learning curve.”

The 1½ Strutter was launched in January 1915 by the Sopwith Aviation Company 
as engineers scrambled to counter the superior aeronautical might of the 
Germans.

The lightweight biplane came hot-on-the-heels of the experimental Sigrist Bus, 
which had already set a new altitude record. The Strutter was so-called because 
its top wings were linked to the fuselage by one long strut and a shorter half 
strut.

 Used primarily by the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps, the 
prototype biplane was introduced into British service in April 1916.

A multi-roled craft, it was the first to enter military service with a 
synchronised front-mounted machine gun made by Vickers, using an interrupter 
gear to fire at the enemy through the propeller. Gerard Lohan, who is making a 
documentary about the project, said: “German planes could already fire through 
the propeller which had made them superior, so this was a great advance. It 
also used airbrakes and had a trimming mechanism so that the balance changed as 
the fuel, bullets and oil ran out.

“It carried incendiary bullets to help explode Zeppelins and is known to have 
shot at least one down and scared many away. Most aircraft before this were 
really out of date.”

Since the machine gun was so intrinsic to the aircraft, the team have been 
keen to track down an original. If one cannot be found, the plane will be 
fitted with a realistic-looking alternative. The volunteers are also appealing 
for help locating authentic cockpit instruments that people may have lying 
around their homes without knowing their significance, or which may be isolated 
in museums.

During the war, around 80% of those building the aircraft were women, while 
the men were away fighting. Their jobs included stitching the linen and 
painting the bodywork, but they also assembled frames and completed the 
intricate stringing. The engineering was down to former shipworkers.

None of the women will be alive today but the men want to contact surviving 
children or grandchildren who may have information or photographs to help them 
make their craft as realistic as possible.

Sharpe says: “It would be fantastic to get any old photographs or stories 
passed down the generations from these women. Many died from the toxic paints 
that were used in those days on the plane: they used to lick their paintbrushes 
to get a finer finish and it made them ill.”

 Among the few compromises on authenticity have been a nine-cylinder engine 
imported from Australia along with some modern cockpit instruments to comply 
with stringentLight Aircraft Association 
<http://www.lightaircraftassociation.co.uk/> licensing regulations. A 
plasticised fabric skin is also likely to replace the Irish linen, glue, pins 
and lacquer of the original.

Other considerations surround takeoff. Many of the men have glider pilot 
licences but are too old to take the machine up independently, which meansthey 
are angling for dual controls to be installed. Sharpe, however, is keenly aware 
that safety comes first: “A lot of the early planes crashed and killed young 
pilots who often had no more than six weeks’ training in the rush to get them 
flying. The engine early on would just conk out. It was a risk, almost like 
going into space. We now know better and our plane has a modern engine.”

The next step is to find another hangar for the machine, which has outgrown 
the current space.

The whole project has so far cost in excess of £40,000, which has come from an 
initial loan from the museum, private and commercial donations and 
crowd-funding, and the men will need further financial support to get the 
Strutter in the air and maintain it. They hope eventually to take the plane on 
an international tour for educational purposes.

Quinty says: “There will be a few butterflies when we finally see it flying 
but it will be such a pleasure. Our inspector just keeps saying ‘make it to the 
specification of the drawings. If it flew 100 years ago, it will fly again.’”
