Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> can build a mass movement 
of up to half a million supporters and members – giving it an activist base 
five times bigger than the Conservatives' – if delegates back Ed Miliband's 
party reforms next weekend, a leading figure from the right of the party has 
said.

, former transport secretary Lord Adonis, who is now conducting a review of 
policy on growth and jobs, says the controversial changes have the potential to 
"electrify" the centre-left by reconnecting huge numbers of people to the 
political process.

Under the reforms

, to be voted on at a special conference on Saturday, a new breed of affiliated 
member will be created from the 2.7 million union members who choose to pay a 
political levy, in addition to the separate existing category of registered 
members. Both will be able to take part in a range of party events.

For the first time, affiliated members will have to actively agree to pay a £3 
levy to the party, rather than having money taken automatically from their 
union dues – a move Miliband acknowledges could lead to a drop in party income.

"If they succeed Labour could be electrified by a surge of energy," Adonis 
writes. "These reforms could help Labour outnumber Conservatives on the ground 
by three, four or even five to one in years to come."

Miliband has said he wants to be prime minister at the head of a "movement" 
rather than one who simply "pulls levers" from Downing Street.
