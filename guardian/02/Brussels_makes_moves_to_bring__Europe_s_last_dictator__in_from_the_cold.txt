Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko’s hosting of Ukraine peace talks may be 
having a side effect – thawing relations between theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and a man the west calls “Europe’s last 
dictator”.

A meeting in Minsk on Friday with the foreign minister of neighbouring Latvia, 
travelling in his capacity as chair of the EU ministerial council, marked 
another step in what diplomats say is an accelerating process that could see 
some easing of sanctions on Lukashenko and even an invitation to a May summit.


“We’d like to do all we can to give a new momentum to relations with Belarus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/belarus>,” Latvia’s Edgars Rinkevics told 
his host.

Lukashenko told the minister, who chairs EU meetings until June: “If Latvia 
helps us come even closer to the EU during its presidency, we won’t be the only 
ones who are very grateful.”

Unlike Ukraine and other ex-Soviet republics tempted by free trade with the 
EU, Lukashenko has remained broadly aligned with Russia, signing up for 
President Vladimir Putin’sEurasian Union

 but also criticising Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.

Brussels is in no rush to repeat the embrace of Ukraine which led to Russia 
seizing Crimea

He has shown no haste to address complaints over electoral and human rights 
abuses at home that have seen him and some 200 of his supporters banned from 
travelling to the EU since 2011.

But EU diplomats said discussions are under way on how to improve relations. 
And internal document setting out possible steps was agreed by EU member states 
last month. They said Lukashenko will have to reform. However, Brussels is in 
no rush to repeat the kind of embrace of Ukraine which led to its president 
being ousted a year ago andRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> 
seizing Crimea.

Nonetheless, Lukashenko’s efforts to help in resolving the conflict in eastern 
Ukraine, including hosting peace talks last week involving French president 
Francois Hollande and German chancellor Angela Merkel, have raised a 
possibility of detente.

“There are growing signs that Belarus is opening up to Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. Lukashenko has been very 
helpful during the Minsk negotiations,” one EU source said. “Member states are 
discussing whether the EU should unfreeze relations with Belarus.”
Lukashenko, 60, has let it be known he would like to attend a summit between 
EU countries and six ex-Soviet states planned for Riga in May, EU sources say. 
To go, he would need a waiver of the EU travel ban that was renewed only three 
months ago.

Latvia, which hosts the Eastern Partnership Summit on 21-22 May, has said it 
is willing to invite Lukashenko. But some EU states are opposed. Rinkevics said 
it was too early to say at precisely what level Belarus would be represented at 
the summit.

However, speaking to reporters after meeting Lukashenko, he said of the 
summit: “We reached an understanding that it will be an opportunity where we 
can broaden relations with Belarus.”

EU officials are well aware, after his 21 years in power in Minsk, of 
Lukashenko’s reputation as a wily operator adept at playing off the EU and 
Russia for his own advantage. And it still bears scars from thelast such summit

, in Vilnius in 2013, which was a crucial moment in Ukraine’s descent into 
crisis.

The EU says the release of political prisoners is essential for any 
significant improvement in relations. Nonetheless, year-old negotiations to 
ease short-stay visas for Belarussians may be wrapped up by the Riga summit, 
one EU diplomat said.

Rinkevics stressed that the EU was handling relations with each ex-Soviet 
republic on an individual basis: “We know which path Belarus has chosen,” he 
told reporters. “We respect it.”

Some Belarus opposition figures would welcome closer EU ties. Former 
presidential candidate Alexander Milinkevich said: “Human rights need to be 
kept in mind - but it’s also necessary to do all we can to integrate Belarus 
more into Europe.”

Lukashenko appears keen to explore ways to boost an economy that is exposed to 
problems in Russia 
<http://belarusdigest.com/story/belarusian-economy-sinks-uncertainty-belarus-economy-digest-20579>
. His foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, indicated after talks with Rinkevics on 
Thursday that Belarus would keep its distance from the European Union.

“Some want to join the EU tomorrow,” he said of ex-Soviet states. “Some want 
to have a prospect of doing so. And some just want to normalise relations with 
it.”
