Loach’s film, which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/22/ken-loach-cannes-2016-palme-dor-win-i-daniel-blake>
, is about a man trying to negotiate Britain’s labyrinthine benefits system. As 
well as the nominations for best film and director, it has picked up 
nominations for actors Dave Johns and Hayley Squires, who are also competing 
for the most promising newcomer award. Loach’s longtime collaborator Paul 
Laverty is nominated for best screenplay.

This is the fifth time Loach

 has been nominated as best director at the Bifas, although he has not won since
the inaugural edition of the awards in 1998 
<https://www.bifa.film/awards/winners/1998>, when he won for My Name Is Joe.

Michael Fassbender 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/22/michael-fassbender-worrywart-work-on-that>
 is nominated in the best actor category for Trespass Against Us. It is his 
third consecutive Bifa nomination and his sixth overall, with two victoriesin 
2008 <https://www.bifa.film/awards/winners/2008> and 2011 
<https://www.bifa.film/awards/winners/2011> for Hunger and Shame.

The nominations for best international independent film are all high-profile 
choices: Maren Ade’s comedy-drama Toni Erdmann was a Palme d’Or favourite; 
Moonlight and Manchester By the Sea are likely Oscar contenders; Mustang was 
nominated for best foreign film at last year’s Oscars; and Hunt for the 
Wilderpeople has become New Zealand’s highest-grossing film.
