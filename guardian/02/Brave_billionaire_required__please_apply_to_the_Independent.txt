The Independent, which could easily be London's morning paper (if anyone 
follows this column's advice last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/12/lebedev-capital-idea-indy-london>
) may soon not be a newspaper at all as"for sale" signs are tentatively posted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jan/16/theindependent-alexander-lebedev>
 with Lebedev cash and commitment running low. When Paddy Power makes Dickie 
Desmond the shortest-odds buyer in town, you know you're in trouble.

But why despair so easily when internet entrepreneurs and bored billionaires 
are busy buying up papers across the States? The dailyIndy may have a paid 
circulation of only 50,000 or so, but it has nearly 30 million unique followers 
on the net and nearly 300,000 readers for itsi edition each day. Note, too, 
that some of that strength has been manipulation, stripping the mothership 
edition of bulks to boost thei figures. And the two editions – the fat and the 
thin – are inextricably linked: same staff and same advertising, with the i 
numbers theoretically boosting rates.

Of course there are other problems. A newsroom increasingly integrated with 
the LebedevEvening Standard and new London TV station is one. A chequered 
history of constant change and constant losses is another. But there's nothing 
here that a very rich man with a taste for adventure need fear. He'd find 
innovative management and many good journalists in place: good partners in any 
rescue mission. What they need is, sadly, what the Lebedevs haven't got any 
longer: a deep pocket to go with their ambition.
