Background

The Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 implements the key 
legislative aspects of the Home Office's five-year strategy for asylum and 
immigration. Published in 2005,Controlling our borders: Making migration work 
for Britain 
<http://74.125.77.132/search?q=cache:btDlBScGqsgJ:www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm64/6472/6472.pdf+controlling+our+borders+migration+work+britain&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=uk>
 aims to further reform the immigration and asylum system, building on and 
amending the measures introduced in the immigration acts of 1999, 2002 and 2004.

Although asylum applications had fallen by 67% in the previous two-and-a-half 
years, the government aimed to further refine the immigration system in line 
with their objectives of stronger immigration controls and policies of "managed 
migration". This would be achieved by allowing immigration officers more power 
to obtain information, andintroducing penalties 
<http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/employersandsponsors/preventingillegalworking/currentguidanceandcodes/comprehensiveguidancefeb08.pdf?view=Binary>
 for businesses that employed illegal workers.

The provisions to remove British citizenship for dual nationals were widely 
believed to have been inspired by thecase of Abu Hamza 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/apr/27/terrorism.religion>, the radical 
Muslim who wasfighting attempts 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/apr/06/humanrights.immigrationpolicy> 
to remove him from Britain under similar measures created by theNationality, 
Immigration and Asylum Act 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/15/nationality-immigration-asylum-act>
.


Criticism

Liberty opposed several of the measures designed to tackle terrorism, in 
particular the ability of the home secretary to remove British citizenship if 
"conducive to the public good". It argued that if British citizens are 
suspected of having committed crimes they should be dealt with by the criminal 
justice systems, not by stripping them of citizenship. To the extent that this 
was mean to deal with international terrorism, "we do not believe it would be 
an effective and proportionate solution to attempt to export the problem by
declaring people to be 'non-citizens' 
<http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/pdfs/policy06/ian-bill-3rd-reading-lords-citizenship-clauses.pdf>
 so that they can be deported".

It also warned that the requirement to refuse asylum to anyone who has carried 
out, or encouraged others to carry out, "acts of committing, preparing or 
instigating terrorism" was too broad and did not take into account " the 
breadth of the definition of terrorism" around the world. This measure they 
said would sweep up individuals "who face persecution at home because they have 
supported political organisations, like the ANC, which have opposed repressive 
regimes".
