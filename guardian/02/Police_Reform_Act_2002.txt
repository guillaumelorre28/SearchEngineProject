"alarm, distress or annoyance to members of the public".



BACKGROUND

Community support officers are civilians employed and trained by local police 
forces but to a different standard than police officers. Unlike police 
constables, community support officers do not have a duty to act: they make a 
discretionary decision in each situation. They only have powers when they are 
on duty and in uniform, and their powers are limited to their force's 
boundaries.

The government said CSOs would free police officers for frontline duties as 
well as tackling anti-social behaviour, low-level crime and providing an extra 
police presence in local communities.

The Home Office initially intended CSOs to have the power to detain members of 
the public for up to 30 minutes without arresting them, but the Lords struck 
down this proposal.

Rank-and-file police officers opposed their introduction, calling them "an 
excuse for policing on the cheap" and the new civilian force was caustically 
dubbed "Blunkett's Bobbies" and "plastic policeman".

The bill's proposals on police working conditions coincided with a separate 
shake-up of the police pay structure – including the Home Office's decision to 
pursue a reduction in overtime – and sparked widespread anger among front-line 
police. The reforms were overwhelmingly rejected by members of thePolice 
Federation <http://www.polfed.org/aboutus/3F50565BF05A4721847B8A0D3D1517F7.asp> 
of England and Wales: 91% of the federation's 84,000 membersvoted against 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/feb/22/ukcrime.immigrationpolicy> the 
changes.

After Conservative and Liberal Democrat peers voted down elements of the bill 
that allowed the home secretary the power to directly intervene by taking 
operation control of individual force's activities, the home secretary, David 
Blunkett, was forced to introduce some last-minute amendments. These included 
involving the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association ofPolice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> Authorities in decisions on when to 
intervene at failing police forces.

Proposals to enable police forces to confer special authority on members on 
private security staff were rejected by the Lords. Opposition peers insisted 
that they receive council accreditation. This clause had already been the 
subject of anger in the Lords after allegations the government had deliberately 
misled parliament over secret plans tooutsource some police duties 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2002/apr/25/ukcrime.immigrationpolicy2> to 
private companies.

CRITICISM

Critics of the bill said the home secretary's proposed new powers compromised 
police autonomy and created the risk that the police could be manipulated for 
political purposes.

Conservatives described the reforms granting the home secretary the power to 
interfere in day-to-day policing as another New Labour bid to centralise power. 
The shadow home secretary Oliver Letwin warned that the home secretary's new 
powers to sack chief constables would undermine senior officers' independence.

The Police Federation, representing rank and file officers, warned that the 
government's use of civilian officers in high-visibility patrols would create a 
"second-tier, second-rate police service". Fred Broughton, chairman of the 
Police Federation, said: "Modernisationcannot be an excuse 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1781055.stm> for policing on the cheap."
