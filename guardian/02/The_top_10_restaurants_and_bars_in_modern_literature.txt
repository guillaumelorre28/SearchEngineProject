The world of cooking is a vast, enchanted province, full of interesting 
characters engaged in fascinating activities. Tattooed ballerinas dealing in 
flames and blades, red-eyed mad scientists obsessing over plates they've made. 
There is passion and addiction in the kitchen, aspiration and imagination. 
There is energy and exhaustion, discovery and defeat. There is triumph and 
failure and ugliness and love. There is everything we need for a wonderful 
story.

Artists of all sorts have been capitalising on the rich subject matter for 
centuries. A flip through any decent library reveals how, time and time again, 
authors turn to these motifs to complete their books' worlds.; whether it's 
Proust's madeleine orEmma Bovary's pineapple

In writing Sous Chef, my rendition of a day in the life of a professional 
cook, I naively believed that I was onto something new. That I alone could see 
the jewels buried in the rough of my profession, and that I alone was equipped 
to tell a story that takes place there. I realised quickly, though, that I was 
wrong—that restaurants and bars, with all their nuance and beauty, abound in 
modern writing, and that I've merely added my own voice to a conversation 
that's been underway for quite some time. Some other authors have spoken up 
thus:

1. Hotel X in Down and Out in Paris and London by George Orwell 
<http://www.telelib.com/authors/O/OrwellGeorge/prose/DownandOut/downandout_14.html>

The Menu: Oeufs brouillés; Chateaubriand aux pommes sautées; maquereau.
The Appeal: "The chargings to and fro in the narrow passages, the collisions, 
the yells, the struggling with crates and trays and blocks of ice, the heat, 
the darkness, the furious festering quarrels which there was no time to fight 
out", and two litres of wine a day each.

2. The Dingo in A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/19/a-moveable-feast-ernest-hemingway-review>

The Menu: Several bottles of champagne

The Appeal: The Dingo is where whiskey-sodden weeks spent with completely 
worthless characters are sporadically punctuated by run-ins with the Princeton 
elite – the great moundsman Dunc Chaplin, as well as the occasionally poignant, 
pretty-faced, wavy-haired, high-foreheaded, friendly-eyed, Irish-mouthed, 
built-chinned, good-eared, capable-handed, unmarked-nosed, lightly-built F 
Scott Fitzgerald.

3. Milliways in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams 
<http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780330508599>

The Menu: "Large fat meaty quadrupeds of the bovine type, with large watery 
eyes, small horns and what might almost be ingratiating smiles."
The Appeal: "A very agreeable and sophisticated answer to that question 'Where 
shall we have lunch?', Milliways is a place where one can meet and dine with a 
fascinating cross-section of the entire population of space and time."

4. The Farolito in Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/18/reading-group-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano>

The Menu: Mescal
The Appeal: Literally in the shadows of the volcano Popocatepetl, the shadowy 
Farolito is a place where the delicious Mescal and its companion hallucinations 
just might be worth the mortal cost of admission.

5. The cabman's shelter under Loop Line bridge in Ulysses by James Joyce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum>

The Menu:  "A boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on 
the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun."
The Appeal: Where a bacchanalian son in search of a father might find a 
woebegone father in search of a son.

6. Lantenengo Country Club smoking room in Appointment in Samarra by John 
O'Hara <https://stanleyreynolds.wordpress.com/tag/appointment-in-samarra/>

The Menu: "The liquor, that is, the rye, was all about the same: most people 
bought drug store rye on prescriptions (the physicians who were club members 
saved 'scrips' for their patients), and cut it with alcohol and colored water. 
It was not poisonous, and it got you tight, which was all that was required of 
it and all that could be said for it.
The Appeal: Watching the moth-eaten storytelling Harry Reilly get pelted in 
the eye with the round-cornered ice cubes from Julian English's scotch and soda.

7. O'Connell's in White Teeth by Zadie Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/28/zadiesmith>

The Menu: "O'Connell's is an Irish pool house run by Arabs with no pool tables 
… there are reasons why the pustule-covered Mickey will cook you chips, egg and 
beans, or egg, chips and beans, or beans, chips, eggs and mushrooms but not, 
under any circumstances, chips, beans, eggs and bacon."
The Appeal: "A place to discuss everything from the meaning of Revelation to 
the prices of plumbers. And women. Hypothetical women."

8. Charlie Bathcellar's Poolroom in Studs Lonigan by James T Farrell

The Menu: Beer; cigarettes.
The Appeal: Just off the el train at 58th and State, this is where the mopes 
and bums'll give you the horse laugh for going to a swell dance with a hot 
dame, and where gassing with the wrong punks is liable to get you pasted in the 
mush.

9. Korova Milk Bar in A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/14/clockwork-orange-anthony-burgess-review>

The Menu: Moloko peeted with vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom
The Appeal: "Veshches which give you a nice quiet horrorshow fifteen minutes 
admiring Bog And All His Holy Angels and Saints in your left shoe with lights 
bursting all over your mozg."

10. Dorsia in American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jul/14/bret-easton-ellis-american-psycho>

The Menu: Lobster with caviar and peach ravioli; blackened lobster with 
strawberry sauce; quail sashimi with grilled brioche; baby softshell crab with 
grape jelly.
The Appeal: "My priorities before Christmas include the following: (1) to get 
an eight o'clock reservation at Dorsia with Courtney, (2) to get myself invited 
to the Trump Christmas party aboard their yacht, (3) to find out as much as 
humanly possible about Paul Owen's Fisher account, (4) to saw a hardbody's head 
off and Federal Express it to Robin Barker – the dumb bastard – over at Salomon 
Brothers and (5) to apologize to Evelyn without making it look like an apology."
