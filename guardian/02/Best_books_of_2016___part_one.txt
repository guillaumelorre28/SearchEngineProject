I particularly loved three beautiful books of non-fiction this year: Ngũgĩ wa 
Thiong’o’sBirth of a Dream Weaver (Harvill Secker), exquisite in its honesty 
and truth and resilience, and a necessary chronicle from one of the greatest 
writers of our time.Tash Aw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/mar/15/tash-aw-life-in-writing>’s The 
Face (Restless), so wise and so well done, made me wish it were much longer 
than it is. And Hisham Matar’sThe Return: Fathers, Sons and the Land in Between 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/14/the-return-father-sons-and-the-land-in-between-hisham-matar-review>
 (Viking), which moved me to tears and taught me about love and home.

Ramachandra Guha 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/09/gandhi-before-india-ramachandra-guha-review>
 is widely considered India’s finest intellectual, and his new book of essays,
Democrats and Dissenters (Allen Lane), reminds us why. The subjects are as 
diverse as the career of Eric Hobsbawm and the plight of India’s tribal people; 
the prose is exquisite. Both measured and passionate, Guha’s is the most 
important voice of dissent in Narendra Modi’s India.Mark Greif 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/23/how-to-live-well-in-age-of-plenty>
’s essay on the Kafkaesque nature of the modern gym, Against Exercise, is 
already a classic; and his new book,Against Everything (Verso), tells us it’s 
not just the gym, it’s also our music, our culture, our political life – 
everything about us, in fact – that is right out of Kafka. Many fine novels 
were published this year, but Sebastian Barry’sDays Without End 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/28/days-without-end-by-sebastian-barry-review>
(Faber), a gay romance set amid the bloody mayhem of mid-19th century America, 
was more wrenching and beautiful than anything I’ve read in a long time.

The underground railroad that took runaway slaves to freedom was a metaphor, 
but by making it into a real railroad, Colson Whitehead’s brutal, tender, 
thrilling and audacious novel,The Underground Railroad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/09/the-underground-railroad-by-colson-whitehead-review-american-slavery>
(Fleet), turns it into a different kind of metaphor. We follow Cora on her 
long, terrifying journey to escape the plantation that keeps reaching out to 
grab her back. Freedom, for this novel, cannot be a destination but a 
neverending, constantly rebuilt journey. Maggie Nelson’s allusive and 
thoughtful memoir,The Argonauts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/23/the-argonauts-maggie-nelson-review-harry-dodge-transgender>
(Melville House), is a timely meditation on gender. Her sentences are perfectly 
wrought, each word carefully chosen. It’s as much philosophy as life narration, 
and insists on the irreducible complexity of human experience, and especially 
our experiences of sex and gender. If I’ve made it sound dry, it’s not; it’s 
sexy and intense and has stayed with me all year.

Grand Hotel Abyss: The Lives of the Frankfurt School 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/03/grand-hotel-abyss-frankfurt-school-adorno-benjamin-stuart-jeffries-review>
 (Verso) by Stuart Jeffries may not be a title to quicken the pulse of the 
common reader, but this common reader found it marvellously entertaining, 
exciting and informative. Jeffries is no idolator of great reputations, and his 
treatment of Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse and Jürgen Habermas is 
refreshingly breezy, though never less than serious and carefully judged. In 
the same general area, Roger Scruton’s characteristically titledFools, Frauds 
and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/10/fools-frauds-and-firebrands-thinkers-of-the-new-left-roger-scuton-review>
 (Bloomsbury) is a splendidly invigorating assault on the likes of Eric 
Hobsbawm, Jacques Derrida and Edward Said. For even more laughs, Philip Eade’s
Evelyn Waugh: A Life Revisited 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/27/evelyn-waugh-ann-pasternak-slater-life-revisited-philip-eade-william-boyd>
 (Weidenfeld & Nicolson) demonstrates that Waugh’s life, already done by 
diverse hands, really is worth another visit.

<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/06/east-west-street-philippe-sands-a-passing-fury-at-williams-review>
(Weidenfeld & Nicolson), Philippe Sands has not only woven together striking 
and important stories, leading from the city of Lviv to the Nuremberg tribunal, 
he has achieved an almost unbelievable miracle in his research. Norman Ohler, in
Blitzed: Drugs in Nazi Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/16/blitzed-drugs-in-nazi-germany-by-norman-ohler-review>
 (Allen Lane), has succeeded in a remarkable scoop, by studying in detail the 
notebooks of Hitler’s personal doctor and demonstrating that Hitler was a far 
worse junkie than we had ever imagined. He has also unearthed the way that the 
German army did not march on its stomach, but on methamphetamine. The 
supposedly clean-living Nazis, who accused the Jews of corrupting German youth, 
were the real pushers. The book, written with delightful irony, is an 
eye-opener.

A hundred years ago, the battle of the Somme had just ground to its sanguinary 
halt. How can we make what is now ancient history vivid and compelling? Two new 
books do exactly that, illuminating the conflict with remarkable honesty.The 
Lost Tommies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/29/lost-tommies-ross-coulthart-review-first-world-war-photographs-soldiers-louis-antoinette-thuilliers>
 by Ross Coulthart (William Collins) presents us with a revelatory cache of 
photographs recently found in a French farmhouse. These are casual images of 
British and empire troops of amazing quality. Their common, vulnerable humanity 
has never been more visible or more haunting. However, one solitary photograph 
forms the catalyst for Andrew Tatham’s astonishingA Group Photograph (Arvo 
Veritas). This is a formal portrait of some 40 officers in one battalion taken 
in 1915. Two decades of research have uncovered the extraordinary details and 
contexts of these young men: their lives, their families and their fates. My 
find of the year has been a proper monthly magazine,Scoop 
<http://www.scoopthemag.co.uk/>. For those of you with younger readers (aged 
8-14) in your circle, it is a tremendous boon. Real words on real pages, not on 
a screen. A transforming experience.

Perhaps it’s because I’ve been writing a novel about return that fate took me 
to two books this year, both published decades ago – A Sport and a Pastime 
(Picador) by James Salter, an author belatedly recognised not long before his 
death in 2015, and The Moon and the Bonfires (NYRB Classics), by the great 
Italian novelist and poet, Cesare Pavese. Salter’s novel has to do with the 
sense of intimacy and strangeness emanating from a small town in France; 
Pavese’s with a village that the protagonist returns to from America after the 
war. Both narrators know the wider world, but both ask how much of that 
knowledge really matters when it’s the immediate border of the town that always 
looks impossibly distant and unpassable. From this year’s new books, Teju Cole’s
Known and Strange Things 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/07/known-and-strange-things-teju-cole-review-essays>
(Faber) made me reflect on the provenance of the sensibility contained in its 
pages: a possible world history of modernism of which we have only a skewed 
understanding, leaving out, as it does, Africa and India. Jamie McKendrick’s 
remarkableSelected Poems (Faber) is a reminder, in this time of Brexit, of a 
cosmopolitan restiveness, a sophistication, that’s also very English. Finally, 
I must recommend books by two of the shrewdest thinkers and artists writing 
now: the poet Charles Bernstein’s essays,Pitch of Poetry (Chicago), and the 
novelist Kirsty Gunn’s terrific extended essay,My Katherine Mansfield Project 
(Notting Hill).

so far this year is Anna Pallai’s70s Dinner Party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2016/nov/12/70s-dinner-party-food-in-pictures>
 (Square Peg). The pictures of what people used to cook to impress 40 years ago 
are astonishing – lurid, grotesque food sculptures which would defy the darkest 
imaginings of a Hitchcock or a Dalí – while the accompanying captions have a 
perfect deadpan wit. Part social history, part dadaist artwork.The Good 
Immigrant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/22/good-immigrant-review-nikesh-shukla-britain-racist>
(Unbound), edited by Nikesh Shukla, is that rarest of beasts, a truly necessary 
book: 21 enlightening, upsetting, anger-provoking essays by BAME writers about 
what it really feels like to be perpetually aware of your “otherness” in 
Britain today. And I thoroughly enjoyedIt’s the Pictures That Got Small 
(Columbia), a collection of Charles Brackett’s diaries, expertly edited by 
Anthony Slide to paint a multifaceted portrait of Brackett’s long-term 
collaborator Billy Wilder. This feels as close as we can get to being in the 
presence of Wilder’s genius, and he emerges as the cruellest as well as the 
wittiest of men. I especially liked the story of him receiving an anguished 
love letter from one of his mistresses, tearing it up in front of Brackett, 
then retrieving one scrap of light-grey paper from the basket: preserved so 
that he could show it to his wife that evening, as it was just the shade he 
wanted her to use to redecorate their sitting room.

Fiona Stafford’s The Long, Long Life of Trees (Yale) is beautifully produced, 
and each chapter describes a different species, from the dark yew to the 
friendly apple. I particularly enjoyed the story of the willow, which told me 
many things I did not know, including the fact that Alexander Pope has been 
traditionally credited with introducing the weeping willow to Britain. A 
chapter a day of this deeply calming book will keep panic away. Sarah Moss’s 
new novel,The Tidal Zone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/09/the-tidal-zone-sarah-moss-review-novel-nhs-parental-anxiety>
 (Granta), in contrast, is full of anxiety, mostly parental, although it is at 
times also very funny. I have admired and read all her works, with their double 
time frames and sharp eye on the strange way we live now – an adventurous and 
original novelist.

When we can’t rely on our governments to defend our best interests, we have to 
turn to the unacknowledged legislators. Poetry, like Adrienne Rich’s – in her
Collected Poems (Norton), edited by Claudia Rankine – or Rankine’s, can awaken 
us to the kinds of deeper truths that are unsayable in prose, and “remind us of 
all we are in danger of losing”, as Rich once pointed out. I can’t say enough 
good things about Yelena Moskovich’s debut novelThe Natashas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/14/the-natashas-yelena-moskovich-review-debut-novel>
(Serpent’s Tail). The language is fresh, playful and alive; Moskovich captures 
what it is to be a living, desiring body in the city, as well as a body sold 
into the sex trade, in which life and desire flicker faintly, freakishly. Teju 
Cole hits it out of the park over and over inKnown and Strange Things, his 
essay collection on photography, travel, race and being. I know I’ll be 
rereading and engaging with the ideas here for years to come.

The Lonely City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/19/the-lonely-city-the-art-of-being-alone-olivia-laing-review>
 by Olivia Laing (Canongate) takes a great theme, solitude and the city, and 
uses it to open up the work of artists from Hopper to Warhol. The chapter on 
David Wojnarowicz is both wonderful and necessary, for gathering what we know 
of the early days of the Aids epidemic among the East Village avant garde. I 
read this in New York and felt the opposite of lonely, until I knew it had to 
end.The Glass Shore (New Island), edited by Sinead Gleeson, is a companion 
volume to last year’s anthology, The Long Gaze Back, which brought many Irish 
female writers back into focus. This one collects work by women from Northern 
Ireland – a neglected group if ever there was one. No one outside Ireland could 
believe (or does when I mention it) what things are like for female writers 
here.Selected Poems by Paul Muldoon (Faber) – how do you bring out a small book 
of poetry by Muldoon, whose work has been so much about being various? This 
personal selection by the poet himself is exemplary for showing how you can be 
important and playful at the same time. Reading it brings not just joy, but 
also a kind of relief for the way he sets language free.

Two of my favourite books in 2016 have been novels set in contemporary 
California, both of them seriously funny and extraordinarily well written. 
Elizabeth McKenzie’sThe Portable Veblen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/18/the-portable-veblen-elizabeth-mckenzie-review>
 (4th Estate), which has received awards attention in the US, is the story of a 
young woman with a hilariously difficult mother and a boyfriend who’s neck deep 
in the military-industrial complex. The less visibly receivedPrivate Citizens 
(Oneworld), by the first-time novelistTony Tulathimutte 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/14/private-citizens-by-tony-tulathimutte-review>
, tracks four recent Stanford graduates as they make their way through the twin 
horror shows of Silicon Valley and the San Francisco hipster scene. The flaws 
of these novels are minor and forgivable, their virtues many.

The Tusk That Did the Damage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/25/the-tusk-did-damage-tania-james-review-fable>
 by Tania James (Harvill Secker) is one of the most compelling and unusual 
novels I’ve read this year. An ivory poacher, a documentary film maker and a 
legendary south Indian elephant called The Gravedigger combine narrative 
perspectives to create a fascinating story of hunters and observers, old 
mythical gods and modern politics. James moves with grace, intelligence and 
curiosity through the moral and cultural complexities of capitalism and 
conservation, love and ambition, and the “minds of others”. Humour, philosophy, 
feminism and the natural world might not necessarily make for comfortable 
poetry bedfellows, but Rebecca Watts’ debut collection,The Met Office Advises 
Caution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/29/saturday-poem-turning-rebecca-watts>
(Carcanet), has them fitting together perfectly. The contents of wheelie bins, 
Zen trees, a suffragette audaciously mounting a penny farthing bicycle, 
athletic tracks and the fate of country moles – the poems offer levity and 
depth, always revealing a “clear hard road, made for going along”.

Ioan Grillo’s Gangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields, and the New 
Politics of Latin America (Bloomsbury) is a gripping narrative of Latin 
America’s new crime wars. It challenges our basic concepts of politics, 
economics and even religion, recounting how criminality mutates into warfare, 
how drug cartels mutate into multinational corporations, and how gangsters 
mutate into politicians and even into religious prophets. Cathy O’Neil’sWeapons 
of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/27/cathy-oneil-weapons-of-math-destruction-algorithms-big-data>
(Allen Lane) is a fascinating and deeply disturbing book. O’Neil explains how 
authority is shifting from humans to big data algorithms, which now decide 
whether to give you a loan, offer you a job or even lock you in jail. The 
algorithms promise scientific objectivity, but they have their own built-in 
biases, which often cause even greater harm than old-fashioned human prejudice. 
Ben Ehrenreich’sThe Way to the Spring: Life and Death in Palestine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/09/west-bank-tales-way-to-the-spring-ben-ehrenreich-palestine>
 (Penguin) is a heartbreaking account of the brutal and often surreal realities 
of life under the Israeli occupation. After reading it, you don’t know whether 
to despair at the callousness and self-righteousness of human beings, or to 
wonder at their resilience and creativity.

I had recently re-read Raymond Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/may/28/featuresreviews.guardianreview33>
’ Border Country (Chatto & Windus), by now the most enduring novel of the 
1960s, so I was primed for the idea that much of what’s deepest in British 
literature is regional. Barney Norris’s debutFive Rivers Met on a Wooded Plain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/22/five-rivers-met-on-a-wooded-plain-barney-norris-review-novel>
 (Doubleday) is about the lives of five people briefly linked by a motor 
accident in Salisbury. The technical command and emotional weight would be 
impressive in a writer who had written 20 books, not one. Lovers of cinema 
desperately miss David Thomson’s weekly column about film in the Guardian, but 
now he’s moved on to tackling a whole new medium inTelevision: A Biography 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/24/television-biography-david-thomson-review-anecdotal-history>

The best biography of the year was Edmund Gordon’s luminous The Invention of 
Angela Carter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/22/the-invention-of-angela-carter-a-biography-by-edmund-gordon-review>
 (Chatto & Windus). He beautifully drew the best from Carter’s friends and 
acquaintances, and the result will become a classic. Stanley Price’sJames Joyce 
and Italo Svevo: The Story of a Friendship (Somerville) was a simply adorable 
book; I was chuckling for days afterwards whenever I thought of the absurd 
fairytale ending, as both his heroes, against all likelihood, gained immense 
international fame. I hugely admired Srinath Raghavan’sIndia’s War (Allen 
Lane); his energy and rigour told a story only familiar (to most of us) in 
patches. The best novels of the year were Zadie Smith’sSwing Time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/13/swing-time-zadie-smith-review> 
(Hamish Hamilton) – the chapters about childhood sang off the page with truth –

David Szalay’s All that Man Is was a revelation to me – not only of a 
brilliantly inventive and observant writer, whose three previous novels I then 
immediately consumed, but of new possibilities for the novel as a form. Just 
one weak link in Szalay’s sequence of unrelated stories would have ruined the 
effect, but he writes with equal calm command of his nine disparate men, from 
an InterRailing student to a retired civil servant, each in a different 
European location. The magic is that the stories prove not to be unrelated, but 
form a mysteriously resonating whole. I can’t stop thinking about it. A 
masterpiece of a different kind is Hisham Matar’sThe Return, an unstintingly 
truthful account of his protracted attempts to discover the facts about the 
disappearance of his father, a prominent opponent of Muammar Gaddafi. The book 
has an involvingly complex time scheme, rich in a sense of what might be and 
what might have been, and the natural delicacy of Matar’s writing, its 
concision and reserve, only heighten the power of a gripping and agonising 
story. I was dazzled by Luke Kennard’sCain (Penned in the Margins) – its 
central sequence of 31 prose-poems, each an anagram of the same few verses of 
Genesis, is the cleverest and funniest thing I’ve read this year.

Edmund Gordon’s The Invention of Angela Carter takes a fascinating journey 
through layers of English and Japanese bohemia while triumphantly bringing us 
closer to the brilliantly wayward personality and mind of one of the finest, 
most original writers of the last 50 years. Yuval Noah Harari’sHomo Deus: A 
Brief History of Tomorrow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/24/homo-deus-by-yuval-noah-harari-review>
(Harvill Secker) sets out with enviable (and alarming) lucidity the massive 
challenges now facing our species as genetic technologies, AI and robotics 
alter forever our relationships with one another and with other species. It’s 
even more readable, even more important, than his excellent Sapiens. My 
favourite novel this year remains Sebastian Barry’s magnificentDays Without End 
– a lyrical, sometimes savage, often achingly tender western about two young 
gay Irishmen adrift in the American west before, during and following the civil 
war.

Inquiry, elegy, lyric, abstract narrative: Voyage of the Sable Venus and Other 
Poemsby Robin Coste Lewis (Knopf) probes the brutalities, contradictions and 
ecstasies of race, sexuality and gender. Each poem is a controlled yet 
passionate exploration of history and aesthetics. “A man who wants the truth 
becomes a scientist; a man who wants to give free play to his subjectivity may 
become a writer; but what should a man do who wants something in between?” 
Robert Musil posed the question; Darryl Pinckney’sBlack Deutschland (Farrar 
Straus & Giroux) is a fascinating answer: a dramatic and essayistic novel. Its 
restless narrator, Jed, moves from Chicago’s black bourgeoisie, with its wary 
pride, to west Berlin, with its watchful arrogance. Every civilisation and 
psyche here is imperilled, and in thrall to its discontents.

Autumn; Christodora; Darling Days

The novel of the year is obviously Ali Smith’s Autumn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/12/autumn-ali-smith-review> (Hamish 
Hamilton), which managed the miracle of making at least a kind of sense out of 
post-Brexit Britain. I also fell hard for Tim Murphy’sChristodora (Picador), 
out now in the US and in the UK next year. A sprawling account of New York 
lives under the long shadow of Aids, it deals beautifully with the drugs that 
save us and the drugs that don’t. Sticking in Downtown, I missed an 
unprecedented two subway stops because I was so engrossed in iO Tillett 
Wright’s East Village memoir Darling Days 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/02/darling-days-io-tillett-wright-memoir-review>
 (Virago). A riveting story about growing up trans with a mentally ill mother, 
it will make you fall for the precocious, streetwise iO.

In a year that contained an unusual number of notable cultural deaths, The 
Violet Hour: Great Writers at the End 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/13/violet-hour-great-writers-at-the-end-katie-roiphe-review>
 by Katie Roiphe (Virago) combined close reading with even closer family access 
to describe how authors including John Updike, Susan Sontag and Maurice Sendak 
faced mortality: readers will dream of a future volume that takes in David 
Bowie and Leonard Cohen. Setting on the page the life and death of someone 
unknown until its publication,You Will Not Have My Hate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/16/antoine-leiris-you-will-not-have-my-hate-interview-paris-attacks-helene-bataclan>
(trans Sam Taylor, Harvill Secker) is a desperate but precise account by 
Antoine Leiris of the death of his wife, Hélène, in the terrorist attack on the 
Bataclan in Paris: sadly, in every sense, a book for our times. Unless pop 
lyricists have the lock on the Nobel prize in literature from now on, then a 
leading future candidate must be David Grossman, whoseA Horse Walks into a Bar 
(trans Jessica Cohen, Jonathan Cape) is a daring tragicomedy about an Israeli 
standup comic who struggles to keep standing as the gig goes on. It contains a 
joke about a parrot that tops the Monty Python one.

Rachel Cusk’s innovation in Transit (Jonathan Cape) is to invent a novelistic 
form to give voice to an almost absent (or societally erased) female narrator, 
who seamlessly creates (via the stories of others) a lucid, connecting 
conversation about the demolition of one sort of life and the rebuilding of 
another. Lauren Elkin’s part memoir, part cultural History,Flâneuse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/25/flaneuse-by-lauren-elkin-review-how-women-walk>
(Chatto and Windus) is an uplifting, gender-bending critique of how women (past 
and present) negotiate public space. Elkin describes the flâneuse as “a 
determined, resourceful woman keenly attuned to the creative potential of the 
city, and the liberating possibilities of a good walk”. Darian Leader’s 
scholarly and entertainingHands: What We Do with Them and Why 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/13/hands-what-we-do-with-them-darian-leader-review>
 (Hamish Hamilton) riffs on examples from modern technology, psychoanalysis, 
popular culture and child development to investigate how our hands often do the 
talking for us. Finally, Kirsty Gunn’sMy Katherine Mansfield Project (Notting 
Hill) remains one of my top books for every year. This is a magnificent stretch 
of intimate writing on modernism, Mansfield and migration. Also, the design of 
the book itself is as beautiful as the mind of the author.

Sarah Bakewell’s At the Existentialist Café 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/17/at-the-existentialist-cafe-by-sarah-bakewell>
 (Chatto & Windus) has a lot more heft than its breezy title suggests. The 
author successfully juggles history, biography and weighty philosophical ideas, 
all the while maintaining a tone which suggests she might be chatting over 
apricot cocktails at the famous Café de Flore in Paris. One of Bakewell’s 
protagonists, Simone de Beauvoir, was a fan of Madeleine Bourdouxhe and the 
latter’s 1943 novelMarie (reissued by Daunt Books, trans Faith Evans) is an 
existential novel par excellence, telling the story of its young protagonist’s 
quest for freedom from domestic and marital life. It’s clear-eyed and austere, 
and more than a match for the novels of Bourdouxhe’s more renowned 
contemporaries. Finally, Martin MacInnes’s debutInfinite Ground 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/05/infinite-ground-martin-macinnes-review>
 (Atlantic), ostensibly a detective story, is a dazzling novel of ideas, 
brimming with passages of jaw-dropping brilliance.

As the economic gloom deepens to the pitch-black night of geopolitical crisis, 
in the economics departments of the world there can still be heard the 
confident chuckle: “but capitalism always survives”. Based on empirical 
evidence it is true: the capitalist system has survived every major period of 
depression by mutating – from the child labour capitalism of the early 19th 
century to the skilled labour capitalism of the 1860s; from free trade to 
monopolies and state control after 1900; and through massive state intervention 
after 1945. Wolfgang Streeck’s bookHow Will Capitalism End? (Verso) is an 
extended riff on the possibility of the mainstream economists being wrong. 
Streeck, emeritus director of the Max Planck institute in Cologne, synthesises 
the various strands of left crisis theory into a convincing proposal: “a 
diagnosis of multimorbidity, in which different disorders exist and, more often 
than not, reinforce each other.” Streeck’s insight is as strong psychologically 
as it is on economics. Published before Brexit, Corbyn or Trump, it describes 
the result of capitalism’s unaddressed failures since 2008 as a period “in 
which unexpected things can happen any time … due to long-valid causal 
relations having become historically obsolete”. For Streeck, declining growth, 
rising inequality and debt point to the possibility of yet another global 
crisis. But the structural crisis that could kill capitalism lies beyond this: 
in the plunder of society’s wealth by oligarchs; the plunder of the public 
domain by privatisation and monopoly power – plus rampant corruption and 
anarchy replacing geostrategic order. InThe Levellers’ Revolution (Verso), John 
Rees, a former SWP leader and figurehead of Stop the War, has written a 
profound and scholarly account of the Levellers – the nonconformist republican 
radicals who clashed first with the monarch and then with Oliver Cromwell 
himself. The book combines the military-political history of the English 
revolution with an account of the social and ideological struggles that 
produced, out of the backstreets of 17th-century London, one of modernity’s 
first revolutionary social movements.

Being a writer turns one into a critical reader; it’s harder to get lost in a 
book. But there are always a few every year that make me forget myself.His 
Bloody Project 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/12/his-bloody-project-by-graeme-macrae-burnet-review>
(Contraband) by Graeme Macrae Burnet sucked me in from the first page with its 
compelling narratives about a triple murder in the Scottish Highlands in the 
19th century. A series of convincing but unreliable voices circles the central 
event and left me breathless. Another narrative carried by different voices was 
the surprising and daringAnatomy of a Soldier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/26/anatomy-of-a-soldier-harry-parker-review>
 (Faber) by Harry Parker, where inanimate objects tell the story of a soldier’s 
catastrophic tour of Afghanistan and its aftermath. It sounds odd but it’s 
entirely engaging, thought provoking and moving. And for lighter relief,The 
Improbability of Love

My cooking, cleaning and driving hours have been filled with Hillary Huber 
reading Elena Ferrante’s Naples quartet (trans Ann Goldstein, 
Europa/Blackstone). Not all writers adapt well to unabridged audiobookery; 
Ferrante, translated, does. The insouciant audacity of Megan Bradbury’sEveryone 
Is Watching 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/22/everyone-is-watching-megan-bradbury-review-novel>
 (Picador) took me by surprise. It has darknesses but its spirit of joy and the 
sheer sense of purpose of the famous characters lifted me in this bleak year. A 
book written 600 years ago, thememoir of the King’s Lynn mystic Margery Kempe 
reminded me of Jeanette Winterson and Eimear McBride in the way its protagonist 
faces into the flow of the immanent forces of existence.

This has turned out to be one of those years when old assumptions, moral as 
well as political and economic, collapse, and we are ushered into a new epoch. 
It will take time to even understand the implications of this transformation, 
which reach deep into the literary and cultural realms, let alone figure out 
where we are headed. In the meantime, we must look for writing that illuminates 
the era that has just ended. David Kennedy’sA World of Struggle: How Power, Law 
and Expertise Shape Global Political Economy (Princeton) can hardly be bettered 
as a description of how the world has been run and why it is so difficult to 
change its dysfunctional ideologies and institutions. Timothy Nunan’s
Humanitarian Invasion: Global Development in Cold War Afghanistan (Cambridge) 
is a groundbreaking study of a little understood experience of modernity in 
what used to be called the third world. Finally available in an English 
translation, Jean Guéhenno’sDiary of the Dark Years, 1940-1944: Collaboration, 
Resistance, and Daily Life in Occupied Paris (trans David Ball, Oxford) is 
eerily resonant with the dilemmas of writers in many neofascist countries 
today. InBlood and Sand: Suez, Hungary and the Crisis That Shook the World, 
Alex von Tunzelmann <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alexvontunzelmann> 
shows why she is one of our most skilful and resourceful young historians. I 
was also fascinated by Joel Whitney’s ingeniously researchedFinks: How the 
C.I.A. Tricked the World’s Best Writers.

Hisham Matar’s The Return recounts the author’s search to find the truth about 
what happened to his father Jaballa, a prominent opponent of the Gaddafi regime 
last heard of in the Abu Salim prison in Libya in 1990: a haunting and 
terrifying story, told with courage, anger, dignity and unswerving 
determination. The letters and interviews in Elena Ferrante’sFrantumaglia: A 
Writer’s Journey

(trans Ann Goldstein, Europa), reveal all you ever need to know about the 
author of the Neapolitan Quartet, apart from the trifling matter of her 
identity. At a time when Irish fiction has never been so fertile, I was pleased 
to discover a novel right up there with those of Colm Tóibín, Anne Enright and 
Eimear McBride: Mike McCormack’s Solar Bones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/04/solar-bones-by-mike-mccormack-review>

<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/19/the-letters-of-samuel-beckett-1966-1989-review>
(Cambridge), edited by George Craig, Martha Dow Fehsenfeld, Dan Gunn and Lois 
More Overbeck, brings to an end one of the most impressive editorial feats of 
recent times, and preserves a marvellous word-hoard. Bleak yes, often, but also 
always pointed and arresting, and sometimes – in Beckett’s inimitably 
self-aware way – extremely funny (“I’d give up if I hadn’t.”) Frances Wilson’s 
sympathetic, clever and well-wrought biography of Thomas De Quincey,Guilty Thing
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/23/guilty-thing-frances-wilson-review-thomas-de-quincey-biography>
 (Bloomsbury) makes him start and startle as never before. Anyone wanting a 
guide across the expanses of contemporary American poetry should turn to 
Stephen Burt’sThe Poem Is You (Harvard), which offers cogent summaries of large 
tendencies, and brilliant readings of individual poems.

My favourite book of 2016 was You Are Having a Good Time by Amie Barrodale 
(FSG Originals). In this debut collection of short stories, Barrodale proves to 
be a talent beyond measure, and her genius for capturing our complex and 
hilarious humanity is refreshing and staggering. Another book I’d recommend 
full-heartedly isAmong Strange Victims (trans Christina MacSweeney, Coffee 
House) by the Mexican writer Daniel Saldaña París. MacSweeney’s brilliant 
English translation of this odd, Kafkaeque and conniving novel is not to be 
missed.

It is hard not to put Han Kang’s Human Acts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/13/human-acts-han-kang-review-south-korea>
 (trans Deborah Smith, Portobello) at the top of the list. Her way of telling 
about the events of a 10-day insurgency in Gwangju, South Korea, in 1980 and 
its psychological, spiritual and political aftermath opened my eyes to the 
cruelty and viciousness perpetrated on the youth of that city. Her writing is 
spare and yet clotted with emotion. I had to stop, and then I had to carry on. 
Looking at human acts from another perspective, I greatly enjoyed Brett Kahr’s
Tea with Winnicott (Karnac), an imagined encounter with the psychoanalyst and 
paediatrician Donald Winnicott, after his death. Formal yet playful with 
beautiful drawings by Alison Bechdel – a brilliant present for anyone 
interested in the life and work of this great clinician and thinker. In light 
of the US election, a read of Andrew SamuelsA New Therapy for Politics? 
(Karnac) wouldn’t go amiss.

I am an indefatigable reader of crime novels, and Susie Steiner’s Missing, 
Presumed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/07/missing-presumed-review-susie-steiner>
 (Borough) is the best I’ve read in a very long time. It has everything one 
could ask, and more: it’s stylish, witty and compelling; has an infuriating yet 
likable lead detective; and is also terribly good at skewering contemporary 
class anxieties and manners. Francis Spufford’sGolden Hill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/01/golden-hill-by-francis-spufford-review>
 (Faber) is every bit as superb as everyone says. As a reader, I was in a 
delighted swoon at the verve and prose; as a writer, I had a fit of infuriated 
envy that anyone could be so outrageously good. I read Fred Uhlman’s novella
Reunion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/11/fred-uhlman-reunion-epic-tale> 
(Vintage) for the third time this year. It is, quite simply, a perfect work of 
art. With the utmost delicacy and care, Uhlman distils all the rage and tragedy 
of the second world war into one brief childhood friendship, and the final line 
is the most shattering of any novel I know. It is one of those books that is an 
unfailing test of character: if you give it to someone, and they don’t like it, 
you should sever all ties, and possibly call the police.

Graeme Macrae Burnet’s His Bloody Project was a welcome surprise on the Booker 
shortlist, a brilliantly written story of rural hardship, fractured community 
and eventual, inescapable bloodshed. Anita Nair uses the whodunit to explore 
social, political and economic issues in present-day India.Chain of Custody 
(Bitter Lemon) concerns child slavery in Bangalore and is both brutal and 
sympathetic, with an all-too-human (and not entirely likable) cop hero. In Rob 
Ewing’sThe Last of Us 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/15/the-last-of-us-by-rob-ewing-review>
(Borough), set in a dystopian present, a plague has killed off all the adults 
on a Scottish island. Do the surviving children cooperate and thrive, or do 
they descend into tribalism? Gripping and utterly believable.

Two of my favourite illustrators have produced wonderful books this year. 
Alexis Deacon draws with a grace and fluency that instantly pulls the viewer 
in. With his masterly graphic novel,Geis: A Matter of Life and Death (Nobrow), 
Deacon has reached a new peak. This 18th-century parallel universe fantasy has 
touches of Jonathan Swift and Mervyn Peake but is uniquely Deacon. It is the 
first part of a trilogy charting the troubled succession struggles that follow 
the death of the great chief matriarch. I can’t recommend it highly enough. My 
second choice is the utterly charmingHow to Find Gold (Walker) by Viviane 
Schwarz, one of the most innovative and creative picture-book makers we have. 
Anna and Crocodile are on the hunt for gold and we follow their progress 
through eyecatching illustrations and wonderfully funny dialogue. Finally, the 
incomparable Sarah Crossan’s free verse novelOne (Bloomsbury) took my breath 
away. Ever since reading this exceptional YA novel, my pencil has been itching 
to decorate its beautifully sparse pages.

At a dark moment of identity politics and resurgent nationalism, the books 
that have left the deepest impression have been those that offer a sense of 
what we might learn from times past. Nothing I have read is more affecting than 
Mihail Sebastian’s magnificent, haunting 1934 novel,Two Thousand Years (trans 
Philip Ó Ceallaigh, Penguin), now available in English (and best read with his
Journal 1935-1944). Han Kang’s Human Acts is no less piercing: an exquisite, 
painful and deeply courageous account of the 1980 Gwangju massacre. On a 
lighter note,Le Roi René (Odile Jacob) recalls the extraordinary life of the 
great jazz pianist René Urtreger, who played with Miles Davis, disappeared, and 
is once more going strong, at 82. Agnès Desarthe’s enthralling biography evokes 
another age, and deserves an English edition, with soundtrack!

I loved Megan Bradbury’s debut novel, Everyone Is Watching, a book ostensibly 
about a century or so of life in New York, but really about how cities 
themselves are works of communal action and art, and about how, even in the 
most draconian and reactionary of times, the vibrancy of these two things will 
light, reveal, challenge and reshape the fabrics of where and how we live. It’s 
a beating heart of a novel. And Sara Taylor’s The Lauras (William Heinemann) 
just persuaded me even more that Taylor is a writer of real gravitas and 
potency. It feels, to read her, uncanny – a bit reminiscent of reading early 
Atwood three decades ago. She’s a writer whose talent, a fusion of sure-footed, 
calm and uncompromising, is both quiet and prodigious.

Garth Greenwell’s What Belongs to You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/02/what-belongs-to-you-garth-greenwell-review>
 (Picador) is a lyrical contemplation of desire, love and identity, a chronicle 
of the relationship between the protagonist, a gay American teacher, and a 
Bulgarian hustler. Written in meditative, generous prose, it is at once 
formally accomplished and intimate, high-minded but personal, witty but 
substantive. It’s the best first novel I’ve read in a generation.Soul Machine 
(Norton) is George Makari’s examination of the way we moved from 
conceptualising our core humanity in terms of a soul to conceptualising in 
terms of a mind. It’s a history not of psychiatry but of consciousness, 
magisterial and pellucid and often wise. Joshua Gamson’sModern Families (NYU) 
is a gleeful romp through the changing notions of what constitutes family: 
single mothers by choice, gay families, complex adoption narratives. It finds 
the point of contact between emotional and legal strictures, and points towards 
an encouraging new liberalism.

The book that will live on in me from this year is Christina Sharpe’s In the 
Wake: On Blackness and Being (Duke), on living in the wake of the catastrophic 
violence of legal chattel slavery. In the Wake speaks in so many multiple ways 
(poetry, memory, theory, images) and does so in language that is never still. 
It is, in part, about keeping watch, not unseeing the violence that has become 
normative, being in the hold, holding on and still living. I have also been 
thinking a great deal about Ben Ehrenreich’sThe Way to the Spring. I think both 
books take a long time to absorb, they are profoundly powerful not only in 
their observations and stories, but in how courageously and carefully they 
speak to our present moment.

First, Falling Awake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/19/falling-awake-by-alice-oswald-review>
 by Alice Oswald (Cape). I fell in love with Oswald’s work in 1996 when her 
first collection, The Thing in the Gap-stone Stile, made the hairs rise on the 
back of my neck. She says that poetry is what happens when language becomes 
impossible. If you’ve never read her – get this collection now. Kate Tempest’s
Let Them Eat Chaos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/09/kate-tempest-let-them-eat-chaos-review>
 (Picador) is this year’s antidote to Brexit and Trump. Across genre, across 
politics, across imagination. Rapper. Ranter. Run-a-way. Runway. Every wondered 
why you haven’t got a tail? Sara Pascoe’s Animal: The Autobiography of a Female 
Body (Faber) covers sex, makeup, feminism, men, pubic hair – it’s a very funny 
and secretly serious look at being a real woman in a plastic world. Lastly,The 
History Thieves: Secrets, Lies and the Shaping of a Modern Nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/06/the-history-of-thieves-by-ian-cobain-review>
by Ian Cobain (Portobello). If you think that we are just at the start of a 
post-truth world, read this terrifying account of politics and coverups since 
the 1889 Official Secrets Act. Spin? This is dizzying, disturbing stuff.
