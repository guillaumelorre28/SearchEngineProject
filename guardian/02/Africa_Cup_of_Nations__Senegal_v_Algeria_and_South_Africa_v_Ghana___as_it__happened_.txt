A long ball comes down the right wing. Belfodil, just on, takes it down and 
squares it to Feghouli. At the corner of the box, he has enough time to pick 
out Bentaleb. The Tottenham player has enough time to read War and Peace but he 
eschews that and instead shifts the ball onto his right foot and smacks it into 
the net with a beautiful strike from long range.

It had indeed been coming. After a corner to Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>, the ball was cleared only as far 
as Ayew. He screwed a shot into the box but he completely mis-hit it. No need 
to worry about that though as Boye, inside the box, controls the ball and then 
puts it through Khuzwayo’s legs.

South Africa’s Rantie has spent the last 20 or so seconds holding the ball up 
near the corner flag. Bit early for that. Meanwhile, Brahimi is on the turf and 
then on the back of the emergency cart after taking a heavy fall going up for 
the ball. It does not look like he will carrying on.

Algeria look to clear the ball from a dangerous attack but only manage to 
divert it into the path of aSenegal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> player via a deflection off the 
referee.The ball is switched out to the right and Badji – I think – squares one 
into the box in the direction of Mané, hovering in the six-yard box. It is just 
behind him but as he looks to wrap his foot around the ball he slips. Ho hum.

Soudani takes a nibble at Gueye’s ankles. The result is a free-kick wide on 
the left just inside theAlgeria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> 
half. That is swung into the box and swung right back out again. Bit of a waste 
that.

South Africa look to be playing very deep inside their own half already. This 
could be a long half for their defence. Elsewhere, Cissé has come on forSenegal

Algeria win a free-kick wide on the left in the Senegal half. It looks like 
Taïder is going to lump it into the box but instead the play it short and pass 
it around a bit, much to the frustration of Senegal who will be a bit nervous 
right about now. Moments after that Taïder takes out Diouf and the referee 
notes his name in the naughty novel. Meanwhile, there has been some swinging of 
handbags betweenSouth Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southafrica> 
and Ghana. It all comes to nothing.

There is some early action in the Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> game after Gyan gets the slightest

pace but there is too much on it and over the bar it goes.

Some housekeeping. South Africa’s Ngcongca has a yellow card beside his name 
(for a fairly innocuous foul) and so too does Senegal’s Badji.

South Africa attack down the right-hand side. A long cross is floated to the 
back post. It finds the head of Ndulula. He nods it down, as he should, but 
Brimah channels Gordon Banks v Pelé in 1970 and he tips the ball away. A fine 
save that.

Senegal have woken up and put some pressure on the Algeria goal but M’bolhi 
does the necessaries.From that Algeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> counter with speed and win a 
corner. That is punted into the Senegal box but they deal with the danger 
easily enough and lamp the ball clear.

Big blow for Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>. Injury means 
Amartey has had to do one and he has been replaced Boye. As for Khuzwayo, he 
has just pulled off a very good save in a crowded box that has kept his side in 
the lead for now.

At the other end of the pitch, Jali has been absolutely chopped down on the 
edge of the box by Wakaso. He could have been sent off but the referee decides 
the challenge is not even worthy of a yellow.

Souaré – soon to be of the Crystal Palace parish – has come on for M’Bengue. 
South Africa are in a spot of goalkeeping bother right now. Khuzwayo is down on 
the ground, holding his hamstring with one hand an beating the ground with the 
other. He stays on for now but if that beating of the ground is anything to go 
by, it does not look like he will be staying on for too long.

Senegal’s M’Bengue is down and looks to be in some amount of pain, or perhaps 
in a concussed state, after Mandi bundled him to the ground when challenging 
for the ball. The medics try to pick him up but his legs like jelly. That is a 
concussion. He won’t be coming back on.
Jonathan Wilson (@jonawils) 
That looked pretty reckless from Mandi on Mbengue - blood all over. Seechurn, 
a crisp, bottled ale with notes of lemon, offers no card.

Well well, who saw this coming? A long ball – yes they haven’t stopped – was 
lumped up towards the Ghana goal and landed on the edge of the box. Masango 
challenged for it but was knocked to the floor. However, his fleetness of foot 
saw him back on his toes once again and he took charge of Mensah’s half-hearted 
headed clearance to hit a belter of a dipping volley that soared over Braimah 
in theGhana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> goal and into the back 
of the net.
 Mandla Masango rightly celebrates his quality finish. Photograph: Khaled

Oh this is awful from the Senegal defence, who have looked shaky on more than 
one occasion this evening.A free-kick on the half-way line is launched from 
right to left by Bougherra and Mahrez just strolls in behind theSenegal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> defence into acres of space 
where he collects the ball with a wonderful first touch and then just tucks it 
under Coundoul with ease.

There are a lot of long balls being lumped around the pitch in the Estadio de 
Mongomo. Meanwhile, back in Senegal v Algeria some decent hold-up play from 
Diouf, down near the corner of theAlgeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> box, sees him set up Mané. He 
takes a touch but a divot in the ground takes the ball away from him.

That was an absolute shocker of a miss from Feghouli. It was like he panicked 
and missed when scoring seemed to be the easiest option. He also threw himself 
on the floor afterwards, pretending to be injured. Think it might have been his 
pride, rather than anything physical.

Senegal have been dominating the early possession but it is Algeria who have 
the first opportunity.Senegal fumble around the back and Algeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> close them down quickly and gain 
possession just outside the box. Feghouli is through on goal and only has 
Coundoul to beat but he dallies on the ball and tries to go around the keeper 
but Coundoul dives at his feet and recovers the ball.

we will not be covering one game exclusively but we will be doing our best to 
cover the main events from both.

The four teams are out on the pitch and ready to belt out their respective 
anthems.Hands are raised to hearts, eyes are deadened and the words are 
whispered quietly. No John Hayes style crying over there.

Elsewhere in Africa, countries will vote overwhelmingly for Sepp Blatter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sepp-blatter> in this year’s Fifa 
presidential election, senior officials said on Tuesday. Sigh.

“Africa is solidly behind Blatter. You will find he is very popular on the 
continent,” said Kwesi Nyantakyi, the president of theGhana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> FA and a Confederation of African 
Football (Caf) executive committee member.

Blatter faces four challengers in his bid for re-election on 29 May, when he 
seeks a fifth term as president, which would take him past his 80th birthday.

“The continent is united behind him,” added the former South African FA 
president Molefi Oliphant, who still serves on the Caf executive. “We made a 
formal endorsement of his candidacy last year at our meeting in Rio de Janeiro 
already.”

Previous endorsements from Caf, however, have not necessarily translated into 
votes. African football’s controlling body promised Lennart Johansson a block 
of votes in 1998 but member associations took no heed and helped Blatter to 
victory. In 2002, the Caf president, Issa Hayatou, failed to muster significant 
support from his own continent and lost heavily by 139-56 votes at theFifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa>congress in Seoul.

Affection for Blatter stems from the generous financial assistance he has 
given Africa during his 17-year tenure. “He has done a lot for the continent. 
It is he who has set up the financial assistance programmes and who through the 
Goal project has built infrastructure in all of the countries,” added Nyantakyi.

If you, like me, thought that South Africa playing three different keepers in 
the one tournament was unusual,then the Knowledge is on hand to expose your 
ignorance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/26/world-cup-2010-three-goalkeepers>
.Still waiting on some team news from the Senegal and Algeria camps by the way. 
Will get that to you as soon as it lands.

Hello and welcome to this evening’s coverage of the Africa Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> and the final games in 
group C. Let’s start by getting the permutations out of the way.

As it stands, Senegal top the group on four points; Ghana have three; Algeria 
also have three; and South Africa are lagging behind in last with just one 
point.Senegal only need a draw from their match with Algeria to be assured of 
their place in the last eight. Of course, a sharing of the spoils would be good 
enough for Algeria too, should Ghana slip up against South Africa. And of 
course, should Algeria lose to Senegal and Ghana do one over South Africa, it 
will be the Black Stars that keep on shining. Heck, even South Africa could go 
through should they win and Senegal win or in the case of an Algeria win once
South Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southafrica> can overturn 
their goal difference deficit to Senegal. But to be quiet frank that seems 
about as likely as your uncle Liam calling around to your house to say that he 
has always felt trapped in his man’s body and that he is off to Vegas for the 
requisite surgery and then he is going to work in a casino as a cocktail server 
where he can fulfil his ambitions to sing and dance and make people happy.

Some news for you and some good news for fans of Senegal. Algeria will be 
without their striker Islam Slimani – the guy who caused Germany so many 
problems in the World Cup – who is still knacked after picking up some thigh 
knack in the match against Ghana. That ain’t going to help Algeria one bit but 
at least they still have the likes of Yacine Brahimi and Sofiane Feghouli, even 
if they have failed to live up to expectations so far in this tournament, and 
the surface in Malabo should suit their passing game better than the one in 
Mongomo. “If you’re on the pitch in Mongomo, try to put together three passes,” 
moaned Christian Gourcuff. “I’m not even sure [Lionel] Messi would manage 
that.” Incidentally, Senegal andAlgeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> have met only once before in 
this tournament, with the Desert Warriors winning 2-1 in the semi-final way 
back in 1990.

Some news for you and some good news for fans of Ghana. The Bafana Bafana 
defender, Thulani Hlatshwayo, took a floggin’ on the noggin in the draw against
Senegal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> so he will be watching 
from the stands – or wherever it is the place the injured players – this 
evening (although given his OG efforts the other day, maybe that is not a bad 
thing.) The wonderfully named, Rivaldo Coetzee, will slot in as his 
replacement, despite being taken off injured in the opening game. That is one 
of four changes for Ephraim Mashaba’s side. The others are, the even more 
brilliantly named, Brilliant Khuzwayo, who will take over from Jackson 
Mabokgwane in goals (that is South Africa’s third goalkeeping change of the 
tournament); Mandla Masango replaces Oupa Manyisa in midfield; and finally, up 
front, Bongani Ndulula comes in for Sibusiso Vilakazi. “We still have another 
game to play, so don’t write us off just yet,” warned Ephraim Mashaba. 
“Football has its own miracles. With one game to go, we can still surprise a 
lot of people.” (Hey, what’s uncle Liam doing at the door?)

Hold still people, more team news and plenty of football action are on their 
way. Woop!

Kick-offs: 6pm

What a whirl that was. That’s all from me folks. Match reports will be on the 
website soon enough. Enjoy the rest of your evening. Bye!
 
And Algeria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> join them.
 
It’s all over. Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> are through.
 
The Senegal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> subs can’t watch 
the game. They are facing the crowd. They know what is coming.
 
We are into time added on. Four minutes for the Algeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> game, three minutes for the 
Ghana game.
 
It is South Africa’s turn to pick up the kitchen sink and aim it at the 
opposition’s defence. They throw and throw but it comes to nothing. Eventually, 
Ayew takes what might be called a smart tumble that buys his side some time and 
takes the sting out of South Africa’s attack.
 
Senegal and South Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southafrica> 
are going out.As it stands. Senegal deserve to as well, they have been poor.
 
A cross is swung in from the left by Rahman and a brave Ayew gets his head on 
the ball and nods his side into the lead.

What a comeback this is.
 
A long ball comes down the right wing. Belfodil, just on, takes it down and 
squares it to Feghouli. At the corner of the box, he has enough time to pick 
out Bentaleb. The Tottenham player has enough time to read War and Peace but he 
eschews that and instead shifts the ball onto his right foot and smacks it into 
the net with a beautiful strike from long range.

range effort. Photograph: Issouf Sanogo/AFP/Getty Images  
Oh this is very nice.
 
Furman puts his and to the ball and is rewarded with a yellow card. He will 
miss the next match shouldSouth Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southafrica> make it through. Soudani has 
been called to the bench. He is replaced by Belfodil.
 
As it stands, Algeria and Senegal are going through. Ghana are throwing the 
kitchen sink atSouth Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southafrica>.
 
It had indeed been coming. After a corner to Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>, the ball was cleared only as far 
as Ayew. He screwed a shot into the box but he completely mis-hit it. No need 
to worry about that though as Boye, inside the box, controls the ball and then 
puts it through Khuzwayo’s legs.

It had been coming.
 
The second and third sub of the game for Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>. Jordan Ayew and Acquah go and 
Appiah and Badu come. Lacen, by the way, has come on to replace Brahimi.
 
South Africa’s Rantie has spent the last 20 or so seconds holding the ball up 
near the corner flag. Bit early for that. Meanwhile, Brahimi is on the turf and 
then on the back of the emergency cart after taking a heavy fall going up for 
the ball. It does not look like he will carrying on.
 
A sub for Senegal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal>. Mané goes 
and N’Doye comes. Diouf, meanwhile, has been handed a yellow card after 
protesting too much about a penalty not given.
 
Algeria look to clear the ball from a dangerous attack but only manage to 
divert it into the path of aSenegal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> player via a deflection off the 
referee.The ball is switched out to the right and Badji – I think – squares one 
into the box in the direction of Mané, hovering in the six-yard box. It is just 
behind him but as he looks to wrap his foot around the ball he slips. Ho hum.

that.

South Africa look to be playing very deep inside their own half already. This 
could be a long half for their defence. Elsewhere, Cissé has come on forSenegal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> in place of Diop.
 
Algeria win a free-kick wide on the left in the Senegal half. It looks like 
Taïder is going to lump it into the box but instead the play it short and pass 
it around a bit, much to the frustration of Senegal who will be a bit nervous 
right about now. Moments after that Taïder takes out Diouf and the referee 
notes his name in the naughty novel. Meanwhile, there has been some swinging of 
handbags betweenSouth Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southafrica> 
and Ghana. It all comes to nothing.
 
There is some early action in the Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> game after Gyan gets the slightest 
of touches but tumbles like he has been shot. A free-kick on the edge of the 
box is the reward for his theatrics. Gyan it is who takes it. He curls it with 
pace but there is too much on it and over the bar it goes.

Back in a few minutes folks.
 
Some housekeeping. South Africa’s Ngcongca has a yellow card beside his name 
(for a fairly innocuous foul) and so too does Senegal’s Badji.
 
South Africa attack down the right-hand side. A long cross is floated to the 
back post. It finds the head of Ndulula. He nods it down, as he should, but 
Brimah channels Gordon Banks v Pelé in 1970 and he tips the ball away. A fine 
save that.
 
Senegal have woken up and put some pressure on the Algeria goal but M’bolhi 
does the necessaries.From that Algeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> counter with speed and win a 
corner. That is punted into the Senegal box but they deal with the danger 
easily enough and lamp the ball clear.

Big blow for Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>. Injury means 
Amartey has had to do one and he has been replaced Boye. As for Khuzwayo, he 
has just pulled off a very good save in a crowded box that has kept his side in 
the lead for now.
 
At the other end of the pitch, Jali has been absolutely chopped down on the 
edge of the box by Wakaso. He could have been sent off but the referee decides 
the challenge is not even worthy of a yellow.
 
Souaré – soon to be of the Crystal Palace parish – has come on for M’Bengue. 
South Africa are in a spot of goalkeeping bother right now. Khuzwayo is down on 
the ground, holding his hamstring with one hand an beating the ground with the 
other. He stays on for now but if that beating of the ground is anything to go 
by, it does not look like he will be staying on for too long.
 
Senegal’s M’Bengue is down and looks to be in some amount of pain, or perhaps 
in a concussed state, after Mandi bundled him to the ground when challenging 
for the ball. The medics try to pick him up but his legs like jelly. That is a 
concussion. He won’t be coming back on.
Jonathan Wilson (@jonawils) 
That looked pretty reckless from Mandi on Mbengue - blood all over. Seechurn, 
a crisp, bottled ale with notes of lemon, offers no card.

Gyan has gone done in the box. He wants a penalty. Never ever, as the All 
Saints would say.
 
Well well, who saw this coming? A long ball – yes they haven’t stopped – was 
lumped up towards the Ghana goal and landed on the edge of the box. Masango 
challenged for it but was knocked to the floor. However, his fleetness of foot 
saw him back on his toes once again and he took charge of Mensah’s half-hearted 
headed clearance to hit a belter of a dipping volley that soared over Braimah 
in theGhana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> goal and into the back 
of the net.

Oh this is awful from the Senegal defence, who have looked shaky on more than 
one occasion this evening.A free-kick on the half-way line is launched from 
right to left by Bougherra and Mahrez just strolls in behind theSenegal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> defence into acres of space 
where he collects the ball with a wonderful first touch and then just tucks it 
under Coundoul with ease.

The first of the evening.
 
There are a lot of long balls being lumped around the pitch in the Estadio de 
Mongomo. Meanwhile, back in Senegal v Algeria some decent hold-up play from 
Diouf, down near the corner of theAlgeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> box, sees him set up Mané. He 
takes a touch but a divot in the ground takes the ball away from him.

That was an absolute shocker of a miss from Feghouli. It was like he panicked 
and missed when scoring seemed to be the easiest option. He also threw himself 
on the floor afterwards, pretending to be injured. Think it might have been his 
pride, rather than anything physical.
 
Senegal have been dominating the early possession but it is Algeria who have 
the first opportunity.Senegal fumble around the back and Algeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> close them down quickly and gain 
possession just outside the box. Feghouli is through on goal and only has 
Coundoul to beat but he dallies on the ball and tries to go around the keeper 
but Coundoul dives at his feet and recovers the ball.
 
Peeeeeeep go the whistles and it is off we go. Just in case you are wondering, 
we will not be covering one game exclusively but we will be doing our best to 
cover the main events from both.
 
The four teams are out on the pitch and ready to belt out their respective 
anthems.Hands are raised to hearts, eyes are deadened and the words are 
whispered quietly. No John Hayes style crying over there.
 
Elsewhere in Africa, countries will vote overwhelmingly for Sepp Blatter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sepp-blatter> in this year’s Fifa 
presidential election, senior officials said on Tuesday. Sigh.

“Africa is solidly behind Blatter. You will find he is very popular on the 
continent,” said Kwesi Nyantakyi, the president of theGhana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> FA and a Confederation of African 
Football (Caf) executive committee member.

Blatter faces four challengers in his bid for re-election on 29 May, when he 
seeks a fifth term as president, which would take him past his 80th birthday.

“The continent is united behind him,” added the former South African FA 
president Molefi Oliphant, who still serves on the Caf executive. “We made a 
formal endorsement of his candidacy last year at our meeting in Rio de Janeiro 
already.”

Previous endorsements from Caf, however, have not necessarily translated into 
votes. African football’s controlling body promised Lennart Johansson a block 
of votes in 1998 but member associations took no heed and helped Blatter to 
victory. In 2002, the Caf president, Issa Hayatou, failed to muster significant 
support from his own continent and lost heavily by 139-56 votes at theFifa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa>congress in Seoul.

Affection for Blatter stems from the generous financial assistance he has 
given Africa during his 17-year tenure. “He has done a lot for the continent. 
It is he who has set up the financial assistance programmes and who through the 
Goal project has built infrastructure in all of the countries,” added Nyantakyi.

Hello and welcome to this evening’s coverage of the Africa Cup of Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> and the final games in 
group C. Let’s start by getting the permutations out of the way.

As it stands, Senegal top the group on four points; Ghana have three; Algeria 
also have three; and South Africa are lagging behind in last with just one 
point.Senegal only need a draw from their match with Algeria to be assured of 
their place in the last eight. Of course, a sharing of the spoils would be good 
enough for Algeria too, should Ghana slip up against South Africa. And of 
course, should Algeria lose to Senegal and Ghana do one over South Africa, it 
will be the Black Stars that keep on shining. Heck, even South Africa could go 
through should they win and Senegal win or in the case of an Algeria win once
South Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southafrica> can overturn 
their goal difference deficit to Senegal. But to be quiet frank that seems 
about as likely as your uncle Liam calling around to your house to say that he 
has always felt trapped in his man’s body and that he is off to Vegas for the 
requisite surgery and then he is going to work in a casino as a cocktail server 
where he can fulfil his ambitions to sing and dance and make people happy.

Some news for you and some good news for fans of Senegal. Algeria will be 
without their striker Islam Slimani – the guy who caused Germany so many 
problems in the World Cup – who is still knacked after picking up some thigh 
knack in the match against Ghana. That ain’t going to help Algeria one bit but 
at least they still have the likes of Yacine Brahimi and Sofiane Feghouli, even 
if they have failed to live up to expectations so far in this tournament, and 
the surface in Malabo should suit their passing game better than the one in 
Mongomo. “If you’re on the pitch in Mongomo, try to put together three passes,” 
moaned Christian Gourcuff. “I’m not even sure [Lionel] Messi would manage 
that.” Incidentally, Senegal andAlgeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> have met only once before in 
this tournament, with the Desert Warriors winning 2-1 in the semi-final way 
back in 1990.

Some news for you and some good news for fans of Ghana. The Bafana Bafana 
defender, Thulani Hlatshwayo, took a floggin’ on the noggin in the draw against
Senegal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> so he will be watching 
from the stands – or wherever it is the place the injured players – this 
evening (although given his OG efforts the other day, maybe that is not a bad 
thing.) The wonderfully named, Rivaldo Coetzee, will slot in as his 
replacement, despite being taken off injured in the opening game. That is one 
of four changes for Ephraim Mashaba’s side. The others are, the even more 
brilliantly named, Brilliant Khuzwayo, who will take over from Jackson 
Mabokgwane in goals (that is South Africa’s third goalkeeping change of the 
tournament); Mandla Masango replaces Oupa Manyisa in midfield; and finally, up 
front, Bongani Ndulula comes in for Sibusiso Vilakazi. “We still have another 
game to play, so don’t write us off just yet,” warned Ephraim Mashaba. 
“Football has its own miracles. With one game to go, we can still surprise a 
lot of people.” (Hey, what’s uncle Liam doing at the door?)

Hold still people, more team news and plenty of football action are on their 
way. Woop!

Kick-offs: 6pm
