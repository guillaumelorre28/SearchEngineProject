1959 saw the release of several key jazz albums, each of which found new ways 
of developing and challenging the innovations of bebop. Dave Brubeck's Time Out 
transformed baffling time signatures into hummable songs. Charles Mingus's Ah 
Um placed bebop in an African-American tradition, adding gospel hollers and 
civil rights radicalism, while Ornette Coleman's The Shape ofJazz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> to Come took bebop to its logical 
extreme, dispensing with piano and leaving the saxophone and trumpet to 
negotiate the harmony. But none of these albums had quite the effect on the 
record-buying public as Miles Davis's totemic Kind of Blue, which remains the 
biggest selling jazz album of all time.

Amazingly, when the likes of John Coltrane, Bill Evans and Cannonball Adderley 
entered Columbia's studios on 2 March 1959, none of them knew what they were to 
play; Miles only gave them rough outlines of each song seconds before the tape 
was rolling, leaving them to improvise spontaneously over his chord changes. To 
this day, listeners experience the freshness and spontaneity of the recording 
process.
