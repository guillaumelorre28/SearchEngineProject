The rendition of Antonio Carlos (Tom) Jobim's The Girl From Ipanema by João 
Gilberto, his then wife Astrud Gilberto and US saxophonist Stan Getz is one of 
the sexiest recordings ever made; an enduring example of "less is more".

The way the track grows from Astrud's delicate verse to Getz's rhapsodic tenor 
solo is a masterclass in consensual seduction. This gentle fusion of cool jazz 
and Brazilian balladry (conceived within the paper-thin walls of Rio's 
apartment blocks) continues to inspire (music) lovers worldwide.
