Ann Widdecombe <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ann-widdecombe> has 
called on parents to encourage their children to write thank-you letters for 
their Christmas gifts – even if they only do so by text message.

The former MP has lamented society’s loss of manners in a column for Radio 
Times, and urged parents to get their children writing to acknowledge their
Christmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> presents.

She wrote: “There are those who lament the substitution of text for the 
handwritten letter, but ‘thanks Gran, u r gr8’, sent in the moment of 
unwrapping, has a glorious spontaneity and gratitude, which the ritual letter 
does not.”

The 68-year-old’s treatise discussed the minefield of manners but she risked 
irking some as she mourned that men would now be “greeted with a lecture on 
equality” if they opened a door for a woman or gave up a seat on a train.

She wrote: “Those of a certain age can remember when opening a door for a 
lady, rising when one entered a room and giving up your seat to her on a train 
were mandatory for any well-brought-up man. Then he was rewarded by a smile. 
Now he’d be greeted with a lecture on equality.”

Widdecombe will be exploring the art of manners in her new BBC Radio 4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio4> series, The Etiquette Guide. She 
noted that rules varied through history and geography on everything from how to 
address royalty to whether the milk goes in before or after the tea.

Her experience in the House of Commons provided her with a wealth of knowledge 
on the subject, she wrote.

“I spent my working life in a place of profound rudeness disguised by 
elaborate manners,” she said. “‘The right honourable gentleman is in danger of 
misleading the house’ means ‘he’s a blinking liar’.”

But she admits to at least one rude habit that she has been unable to stop: 
mopping up her gravy with a bit of bread.
