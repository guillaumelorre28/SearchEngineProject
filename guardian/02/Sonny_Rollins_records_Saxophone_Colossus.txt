Sonny Rollins is still a full-blown saxophone giant today at the age of 80, 
but they were calling him the Saxophone Colossus back in 1956.

Rollins is one of the few surviving links to jazz's formative years, as a 
neighbourhood friend and playing partner of Thelonious Monk, and sideman with 
Miles Davis and the popular ModernJazz <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> 
Quartet in the early 1950s. Splicing the huge sound and harmonic subtlety of 
swing-era tenorist Coleman Hawkins to Lester Young's lyrical looseness and 
Charlie Parker's momentum, Rollins offered a new agenda for the tenor saxophone.

But with 1956's Saxophone Colossus (which debuted one of his signature tunes, 
the calypso St Thomas), Rollins revealed an improvising imagination some 
compared with Charlie Parker, notably on the slow-building, faintly sinister 
Blue Seven. Rollins (a famous eccentric in earlier years who would play gigs in 
raincoats, or hats with corks, or proto-mohican haircuts) had a free jazz phase 
in the 60s, and a jazz-funky one in the 70s and 80s, but styles are almost 
irrelevant to a jazz genius who could make an epic improvisation out of Three 
Blind Mice.
