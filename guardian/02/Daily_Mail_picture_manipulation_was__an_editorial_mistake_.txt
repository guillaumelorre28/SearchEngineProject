The Daily Mail has conceded that the picture manipulation I reported on 
yesterday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/apr/08/daily-mail-tottenham-hotspur-emmanuel-adebayor>
 was "an editorial mistake",according to Press Gazette.

The image showed Tottenham footballer Emmanuel Adebayor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/emmanuel-adebayor> saluting manager Tim 
Sherwood after he had scored a goal during Tottenham's 5-1 defeat of Sunderland.

But the Mail - unlike The Guardian and the Daily Telegraph 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailytelegraph> - deleted the man standing 
next to Sherwood, a member of Spurs' coaching squad, Chris Ramsey.

A spokesman for the Daily Mail <https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailymail> 
quoted by Press Gazette said it was not the paper's policy to manipulate news 
images and that it had been a "mistake". An internal investigation is underway.

The original picture was taken by Kirsty Wigglesworth and distributed to 
newspapers byAssociated Press 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/associated-press>, which prohibits digital 
manipulation of its photographs.

The Daily Mirror <https://www.theguardian.com/media/daily-mirror> also ran the 
image, choosing to obliterate Ramsey with a headline.
