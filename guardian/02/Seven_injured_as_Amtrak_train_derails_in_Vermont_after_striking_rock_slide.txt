Central Vermont Medical Center’s CEO, Judy Tartaglia, said the patients have 
injuries that are not life-threatening. They include neck, back and shoulder 
pain, lightheadedness and a wrist injury. She said she does not expect more 
patients.

Train 55, traveling from St Albans, Vermont, to Washington DC, derailed near 
the town of Roxbury, about 10.30am, after reportedly striking a rock slide on 
the tracks,Amtrak said

locomotive and one passenger car went over an embankment, and three other cars 
left the track but remained upright. Vermont state police and local fire and 
rescue services are responding at the scene.

At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Governor Peter Shumlin said, “This 
was a freak of nature.”


A Montpelier fire department spokeswoman, Dana Huoppi, told WPTZ-TV: “There 
are some people that are shaken up, but it sounds like they are only going to 
transport four by ambulance at this time.”

At least several dozen passengers were loaded on to school buses to be taken 
to an armory at nearby Norwich University.

The incident follows another derailment last May near Philadelphia, which 
killed eight people
