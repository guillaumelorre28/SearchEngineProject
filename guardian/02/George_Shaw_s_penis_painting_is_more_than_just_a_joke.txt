Running joke

Shaw’s phallus-themed gag is far from a one-liner. Here, the landscape painter 
is the wag scrawling penises on the landscape – a tradition that surely goes 
back aeons.

Sylvan scene 

What about those other old masters, though? Shaw’s 20th-century backwoods are 
a tatty double of the painted rural idylls where sylphs of yore romped.

The home county

Famously, Shaw almost exclusively paints the landscape of his youth – a 
Midlands residential suburb called Tile Hill – from memory, using humble DIY 
shop enamel. Be it garages or low-rise redbrick dwellings, those scenes are as 
distinctly British as it gets, but rarely celebrated.

A kind of magic

In his nature paintings, Shaw imbues the brambly copses – where his boyhood 
self would find discarded porn mags – with something bigger. With their 
suggestive stumps and nooks, his trees might have been worshipped by an ancient 
fertility cult. Partly, it suggests a satire on an Olde England fantasy 
enshrined in new age folklore. Yet, as old and new worlds collide, a hidden 
magic is revealed.
