Two weeks ago I was preparing to report that the Sunday Post 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/sunday-post>, the Dundee-based newspaper, 
was closing its London office.

It represented a landmark moment in the history of newspapers - the clichéd 
“end of an era” - because its two staff are thought to be the last newspaper 
journalists working in Fleet Street.

Having been tipped off that the paper’s editor, Richard Prest, had visited the 
London office on 30 June to talk to staff about the decision to close the 
office, I called the publisher,DC Thomson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/dc-thomson>.

But I was told firmly by one of the company’s communications team that the 
London office was not closing. So I didn’t report it.

Now it transpires that my tipster was correct and, strictly speaking, so was 
the company’s spokesperson. Although the editorial presence is indeed to 
disappear, “the London office” will remain in existence because advertising 
staff will go on working there.

DC Thomson has since confirmed that its two London-based journalists and 
another one working in the north of England are to leave the newspaper. But two 
English-based sports journalists will be retained.

Meanwhile, three new roles are being created: an investigations co-ordinator 
in Glasgow, plus reporting posts in Edinburgh and Inverness. And a new deputy 
editor role is being created as well.

Aside from the Sunday Post, DC Thomson publishes the Dundee Courier and the 
Aberdeen <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/aberdeen> Press & Journal plus, of 
course, several iconic comics.
