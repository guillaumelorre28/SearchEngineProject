 she was in her 15th year as editor and the magazine had just celebrated its 
90th birthday. Now she has been in the job for more than 20 years and is 
preparing for Vogue's centenary celebrations in 2016.

Vogue recently published its biggest issue for five years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2013/aug/18/conde-nast-vogue-upmarket-magazine>
. It has launched aspin-off teen title, Miss Vogue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/may/03/miss-vogue-launch-teenage>, as 
well as a burgeoning live event, the Vogue Festival

, and even itsown school of style

. Shulman has also taken a more hands-on role in Vogue's digital operations.

"One of the most influential editors around," said our panel, Shulman making 
it into the listjust ahead of another female magazine editor, Grazia's Jane 
Bruton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/15/jane-bruton-mediaguardian-100-2010>
. "She wields a lot of power in the fashion world."

Shulman, whose early career encompassed Tatler, the Sunday Telegraph and a 
stint as features editor of Vogue, was editor of GQ when she returned to the 
fashion bible as editor, aged just 34.

The high-end glossy's sales continue to hover around the 200,000 mark in a 
difficult magazine market.

Her first novel, Can We Still be Friends 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/15/can-still-friends-alexandra-shulman-review>
, a gently satirical tale of the lives of three London women in the 1980s, was 
published last year.
