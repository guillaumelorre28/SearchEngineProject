A “gentle and caring” 16-year-old boy has died following an alleged stabbing 
at a school in Aberdeen.

Police had been called to Cults Academy in the west of the city at 1.30pm on 
Wednesday after reports of a serious incident. The teenager, named locally and 
on social media as Bailey Gwynne, was taken by ambulance to Aberdeen Royal 
Infirmary where he died from his injuries.

Another 16-year-old pupil was detained by police and was assisting officers 
with their inquiries.

Cults Academy’s headteacher, Anna Muirhead, said pupils and staff were “in a 
state of total shock”. She said: “The boy involved was a very gentle and caring 
pupil with a lot of friends. I think it’s fair to say the whole school 
community is totally devastated but at the moment of course our thoughts are 
all with the boy’s close family and friends and what they must be going through 
at this tragic time.”

A Police Scotland statement confirmed that a 16-year-old boy had died, that 
his family had been informed and that officers were treating the incident as a 
murder investigation.


Ch Insp Graeme Mackie said: “This is a shocking and extraordinary incident for 
Aberdeen and firstly our thoughts are with the family and friends of the boy 
who has sadly lost his life today.

“A full and thorough inquiry has been launched and there will be a police 
presence in the area for the foreseeable future. We are working closely with 
the education authorities and wider community as I am sure this incident will 
be felt not only in Aberdeen but much further afield.”

The school, in an affluent suburb of Aberdeen, was cordoned off after the 
incident and police officers remained at the scene. A number of parents 
reportedly arrived at the school but were not allowed to enter the building.

Cults Academy is the largest state school in the city and also one of the best 
performing, consistently winning awards for its exam results. A new building 
was opened in 2010 by the then local MSP, Alex Salmond. The school is expected 
to be closed for several days to allow police to continue with their 
investigations.

The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, expressed her condolences to those 
affected by the incident.

Speaking at a press conference outside the school, Mackie said the 16-year-old 
pupil that was detained remained in police custody. He added: “We have teams of 
specially trained detective officers interviewing witnesses who unfortunately 
are pupils and teachers at Cults Academy and as you can understand have been 
significantly affected by this matter.”

Gayle Gorman, the director of education and children’s services for Aberdeen 
city council, confirmed that the school would be closed for the next two days 
to help police with their investigation, and that there would be counselling 
and support for all staff and pupils.

Tributes were paid to the victim on social media using the hashtag #RIPBailey 
<https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ripbailey>. One fellow pupil wrote: “Cults 
Academy won’t be the same without you.” Another girl tweeted: “As a pupil of 
Cults Academy, I’m so shocked. RIP Bailey x.”

 Pupils laid floral tributes to their classmate outside the school gates while 
friends of the dead boy attended informal services of remembrance on Wednesday 
evening.

Callum McCaig, MP for Aberdeen South, said his thoughts were with the family 
of the boy who died. McCaig, himself a former pupil of Cults Academy, said that 
the incident was “utterly out of character for the school and for Aberdeen”.

“The school is a brand new facility since when I was there, absolutely 
state-of-the-art, in one of the wealthiest parts of the city,” he said. “It has 
a tremendous reputation and is regularly at the top of exam tables.”
