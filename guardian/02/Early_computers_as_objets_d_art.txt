“Dials and buttons, knobs and switches; they’re very charming,” says James 
Ball, the digital art director behind a new photography series calledGuide to 
Computing <http://www.docubyte.co.uk/projects/guide-to-computing/#.V0WE7ind79I>
, which celebrates early computers. Ball, who works under the pseudonym 
Docubyte, began the project after developing a fascination and affection for 
such retro devices.

“It’s rare now to find any machine that you can touch and interact with,” he 
says. “Computers now are all touch screens, slick and super-slim.” Ball feels 
that computers that pre-date the Apple era aren’t widely considered to be 
design pieces, and his nostalgia for this earlier, more “naive” aesthetic led 
him to seek out and photograph a range of machines that date from the latter 
half of the 20th century, representing them as if they were new and desirable 
products.

After shooting the machines, which he largely found in the Science Museum 
<http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/> in London, the Dresden Technical Collections 
<http://www.museen-dresden.de/index.php?lang=en&node=technischesammlungen> and 
theNational Museum of Computing <http://www.tnmoc.org/> at Bletchley Park, Ball 
painstakingly enhanced the images with the help of his colleagues at INK studio 
to make the computers look new.

“The retouching is quite important to the piece”, he says, taking as an 
example thePilot ACE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2013/apr/12/alan-turing-pilot-ace-computer-video>
, an early 1950s computer designed by Alan Turing, now in a state of 
semi-disrepair. “There are no colour photographs of it when it was new, so in a 
way we were making a new history, presenting the past in a new context.”

Among the eye-catching machines in the series is the Harwell Dekatron, a 
two-metre tall, 2.5 tonne monster 
<http://www.tnmoc.org/news/news-releases/worlds-oldest-original-working-digital-computer>
 from 1951 which is the world’s oldest functioning computer, and theControl 
Data 6600 <http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/supercomputers/10/33>from 
the 1960s, often called the first “supercomputer”.

“They look nice,” says Ball, “but I’d still like to do a comprehensive, quite 
nerdy book which is actually a guide to computing history.” With an air of 
affectionate poignancy, he points out that each of his images, rendered as a 
jpeg, is about 5mb in size – larger than any file that the individual computers 
could sustain. “Without sounding woefully pretentious,” he says, “they’re 
beautiful in their obsolescence.”
