News from the cut-throat world of food preparation now, as Lost in Showbiz is 
forced to announce thatAinsley Harriott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ainsleyharriott> v Gordon Ramsay is 
officially ON.

Poor Ainsley. Despite being a weapons-grade irritant, the Ready Steady Cook 
host is as lemon balm to Ramsay's anthrax.

And so it is with a heavy heart that we read his latest comments on the man we 
know simply as "Yes Chef!", knowing that it can only be a matter of time before 
Gordonretaliates by calling Ainsley a homo, or photoshopping his head onto a 
picture of a hideously misshapen farm animal or something

.

"You have to bring his temperament into question", Ainsley muses of Gordon to 
an interviewer. "I don't bring up children like that. I have spoken in schools 
and I don't think we should teach children about that sort of angry side, that 
dismissive side of things. It sends out the wrong message to children."

Will no one think of the Ainsley? As I say, it can only be hours before Gordon 
breaks off from watching his restaurant empire tank to say something perfectly 
beastly about the poor man, and our thoughts and protective hexes must encircle 
him at this vulnerable time.
