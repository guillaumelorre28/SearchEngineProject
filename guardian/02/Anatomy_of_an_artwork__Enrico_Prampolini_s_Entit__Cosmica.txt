War

This 1937 work is included in the exhibition Painting In Italy 1910s–1950s: 
Futurism, Abstraction, ConcreteArt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art>, and traces the three major 
styles at the forefront of an avant garde that flourished in the shadow of two 
world wars.

Nature

Faced with man-made horror, it is perhaps unsurprising that an artist would 
turn to nature. This manifests itself here in the curvaceous shapes of coloured 
enamel and oil paint flowing into each other amorphously.

Colour play

As well as an artist Prampolini was also a scenographer who wrote extensively 
on the theory of set design. His belief was that theatre sets should play with 
the audience’s senses and emotions just as much as the actors or script might. 
This would be achieved by “chromatic emanations” as Prampolini termed it – that 
is, the kind of lurid experimentation with colour and light that makes itself 
felt in this painting, too.

The future

This work saw Prampolini break from the futurist movement. His sharp angles 
and interest in human ingenuity, speed and technology have disappeared, making 
it, in a way, a rather pessimistic work.

Decorative

This was made in the latter half of Prampolini’s career, around the time he 
had begun to work with stained glass and mosaics. The influence of both these 
mediums can be felt here.
