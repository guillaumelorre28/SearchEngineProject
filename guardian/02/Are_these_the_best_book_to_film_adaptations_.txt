Debates about film versions of books are nearly as old as cinema itself. 
Movies can be a delightful reminder of great literature – but they can also 
ruin it, fixing beloved characters in gruesome shapes. Either way, the talk 
about them is unlikely to stop – and a new survey, coinciding withWorld Book Day
 <https://www.theguardian.com/books/world-book-day> in the UK, has canvassed 
3,000 UK fans of all ages for their favourites.

It turns out that if you crunch the preferences of 1,000 kids and 2,000 
adults, what comes out is a very mainstream list of franchises, mixing Bridget 
Jones and the Harry Potter saga with classics such as The Shawshank Redemption 
and questionable blockbusters likeThe Da Vinci Code 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/the-da-vinci-code>.

So, here is “the nation’s top 10” – as reported by BT TV. Below is the 
breakdown by (rather peculiar) genres. Can The Devil Wears Prada really be the 
UK’s favourite drama adaptation? And what’s with The Da Vinci Code beating The 
Godfather to the top thriller slot? We’d like to hear about less obvious (and 
dare we say better?) titles, so please do suggest your own in the comments.
