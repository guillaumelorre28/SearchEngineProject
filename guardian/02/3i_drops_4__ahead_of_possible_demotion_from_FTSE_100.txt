Next week sees the latest reshuffle of the FTSE indices, and there are 
contrasting fortunes at the moment for two of the companies under threat of 
eviction from the leading index.

Inmarsat, the satellite business, is up 3.5p to 484.1p but investment group 3i 
has fallen 8.7p to 203.2p, doing its chances of staying in the FTSE 100 little 
good.

If the two do get demoted, their possible replacements are Ashmore, down 1.9p 
at 406.p, andMeggitt, down 5.8p at 343.2p.

All the changes will be based on prices at the close of play on Tuesday night, 
so there is still a little time to go yet.
