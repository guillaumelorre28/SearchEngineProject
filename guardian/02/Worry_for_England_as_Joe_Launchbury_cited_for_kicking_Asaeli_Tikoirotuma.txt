The incident is alleged to have taken place in the second minute with 
Launchbury appearing to aim for the ball only to strike Tikoirotuma. The 
low-end sanction for the offence is four weeks, the mid-range eight weeks and 
the top-end 12 weeks plus, with Launchbury’s hearing scheduled for Monday 
afternoon.

Launchbury scored twice in the nine-try defeat of Fiji but could now miss the 
remaining two matches of England’s autumn program, against Argentina on 
Saturday and Australia on 3 December.

The Wasps captain has started alongside Courtney Lawes for the comfortable 
wins over South Africa

 and the Pacific Islanders due to the injury enforced absence of Maro Itoje and 
George Kruis.

However, Kruis’ return from ankle surgery is imminent therefore mitigating the 
disruption caused if Launchbury is suspended, although Jones will not want to 
be denied the use of one of his top performers this autumn.

In a busy weekend for the citing officers, three further players must appear 
at the disciplinary hearing on Monday. The Argentina fly-half Nicolás Sánchez 
has been cited for striking against Scotland, while the New Zealand duo Sam 
Cane and Malakai Fekitoa have been cited for dangerous tackles against Ireland.
