Arizona sacked Aaron Rodgers eight times and returned two of his fumbles for 
touchdowns on Sunday in a dominant 38-8 victory that clinched a first-round 
playoff bye for the streaking Cardinals.

Carson Palmer threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns for Arizona (13-2).

In all, the Packers were sacked nine times in by far their most one-sided loss 
of the season. Dwight Freeney had three and Calais Campbell 2 1/2. Cory Redding 
rambled 36 yards with one of the fumbles for a score, Jerraud Powers took 
another five yards for a touchdown.

The Packers (10-5) have a half-game lead over Minnesota in the NFC North with 
the Vikings facing the New York Giants Sunday night.

Green Bay is home against Minnesota in its regular-season finale next Sunday.

St Louis 23-17 Seattle

Todd Gurley scored on a 2-yard TD run with 10:34 left, Akeem Ayers returned a 
fumble 45 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter as St Louis ended 
Seattleâ€™s five-game winning streak.

St. Louis swept the season series from the Seahawks (9-6) having won 34-31 in 
overtime in Week 1. The Rams (7-8) flustered quarterback Russell Wilson.

Gurley rushed for 85 yards on 19 carries. Case Keenum won his third straight 
start for the Rams, completing 14 of 23 passes for 103 yards and a 28-yard 
touchdown pass to Kenny Britt in the second quarter.

Jacksonville 27-38 New Orleans

Drew Brees passed for 412 yards and three touchdowns despite his injured right 
foot.

Brees, who tore his plantar fascia ligament during a loss to Detroit last 
Monday, showed no ill effects of the normally painful injury while completing 
25 of 36 passes.

Running back Tim Hightower, who missed the previous three seasons because of a 
knee injury and subsequent complications, consolidated his recent resurgence 
with 122 yards and two touchdowns rushing for New Orleans (6-9).

Blake Bortles passed for 368 yards and four TDs for Jacksonville (5-10).
