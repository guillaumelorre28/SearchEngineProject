, the 47-year-old grins maniacally, face caked in blood, mallet in hand, then 
gazes ominously into space. The images give a taste of the savage and satirical 
tone of his latest album; but, as withall Grant’s creations

great beauty comes with the brutality and morbidity.

The album is also full of Grant’s deeply personal narrative and dark humour: 
“grey tickles” is a literal translation of the Icelandic for midlife crisis; 
“black pressure” translates the Turkish for nightmare. Inspired by a love 
affair with his adopted home, Iceland, and its native tongue, in which he 
speaks on much of the album, the singer has found a retreat in thecountry’s 
otherworldly landscape

. “I was in fight-or-flight response my whole life, with adrenaline fatigue, 
PTSD – there was no safety ever,” he says. “I feel safe here. It’s a cautious 
optimism connected to that feeling of security.”

The album was recorded in Dallas with producer John Congleton (St Vincent, 
Franz Ferdinand), and it sees Grant applying his haunted croon to theatrical 
ballads, warped disco and skewed electro pop. On Disappointing, Grant enlists 
the spectral vocals ofTracey Thorn
