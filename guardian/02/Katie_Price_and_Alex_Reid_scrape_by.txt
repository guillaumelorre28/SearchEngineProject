And so to the further wanderings of Jordan's husband Alex Reid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/alex-reid> – possibly Earth's most 
suggestible human. Lost in Showbiz adores Alex, who recently informed an 
interviewer: "This week I came back from LA and I had a dichotomy."

Fortunately, he has now recovered from that routine procedure, and on Saturday 
will have his quickie Vegas marriage to Katie formally blessed. As his good 
lady pointed out to Graham Norton the other day, they won't be selling it to a 
magazine. An almost-convincing Garbo impression, though one that forced the 
chatshow host to point out: "But it is all going to be on ITV, isn't it?"

It is, Graham – but for the last time. The Price genus is immensely strong, 
but it must mutate to survive, and this week madam severed her relationship 
with the channel by signing an exclusive deal with Living TV. One can't say how 
this will affect Alex, who recently claimed the BBC had "asked me to be in a 
costume blockbuster about the year 2,000BC". But the main thing is that Katie 
will be paid £6m a year, a salary that finally reflects the fact that she is 
more valuable to the health of the nation than 280 nurses. Truly, they 
crystallise the age – so live long and prosper, Price-Reids!
