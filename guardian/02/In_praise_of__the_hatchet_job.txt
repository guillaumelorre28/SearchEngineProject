First, pick your target carefully. Literary hatchet jobs are the application 
of a sharp blade to a distended reputation. Go after the big beasts – Amis, 
Roth, McEwan – not the newbies or the mid-listers. Second, paint in primary 
colours. Yours is not the nuanced analysis, still less the balanced scales of 
justice. Yours is the invitation outside. Think of Zoe Heller's recent 
roundhouse on the author of Midnight's Children: "The world is as large and as 
wide as it ever was; it's just Rushdie who got small.

" Or Dale Peck on Rick Moody: "The worst writer of his generation." Third, 
puncture pretension with wit. Michael Cunningham may not thank Adam Mars-Jones 
for his jibes –"that's not an epiphany, that's a postcard"

 – but he must have stifled a snort. Fourth, you are a disappointed idealist, 
not a wan cynic. Fifth, don't give what you can't take. Rushdie must already be 
on standby to review Heller's next book. We can't wait.
