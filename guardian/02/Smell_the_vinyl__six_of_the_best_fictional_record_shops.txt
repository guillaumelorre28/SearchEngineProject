Flick through the racks and smell the vinyl, because next Saturday is the 
seventh annualRecord Store Day <http://www.recordstoreday.co.uk/>. But before 
we celebrate real ones, warm up with our rundown of the six finest fictional 
record shops…

Championship Vinyl <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3TYIIpOZM>


As seen in… High Fidelity
In Nick Hornby's novel, heartbroken Rob Fleming owned this north London vinyl 
emporium. In Stephen Frears's film version (2000), the hero's name became 
Rob Gordon (John Cusack) and the shop was relocated to Chicago. What remained, 
though, were employees Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), aka"the 
musical moron twins" <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3TYIIpOZM>, who spend 
all day making top five lists and mocking customers' musical tastes.

Winston's stall 


As seen in… EastEnders
Run by the Cockney soap's longest-serving male extra, Winston's CD stall has 
been a fixture of Walford's Bridge Street market for 29 years. Characters buy 
the odd album but Winston (the mainly silent Ulric Browne) was less happy when 
the E20 Gang stole CDs and Ian Beale crashed his car into the stall. Not that 
he said as much, obviously.

As seen in… Pretty in Pink
In John Hughes's teen classic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76500/pretty-in-pink>, high school 
heroine Andie (Molly Ringwald) worked part-time at this Chicago new wave joint, 
managed by Iona (Annie Potts), who dispensed big-sisterly advice wearing killer 
80s outfits. Best of all, it saw the mighty Duckie (Jon Cryer) miming along to 
Otis Redding's Try a Little Tenderness.

Brokeland Records <http://dieselisbrokeland.com/>


From… Telegraph Avenue
Set on the street running between Oakland and Berkeley in California, Michael 
Chabon's 2012 novel is about friends Archy and Nat, whose secondhand jazz, 
blues and funk vinyl business is threatened with closure when a megastore opens 
two blocks away. Archy organises a fundraising gig for a young politician 
running for the Senate: some dude called Barack Obama.

Teuchtler Records <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQpYHiB0k6k>


As seen in… Before Sunrise
The first part of Richard Linklater's romantic trilogy found American tourist 
Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French student Céline (Julie Delpy) spend a fateful 
night strolling around Vienna. Their mutual attraction becomes obvious during a 
sweet scene in this well-stocked record shop, as they play folk-singer Kath 
Bloom's Come Here in a listening booth and steal coy glances at each other.

Chelsea Drugstore 
<http://www.myvideo.de/watch/4410324/a_clockwork_orange_the_old_in_out> 


As seen in… A Clockwork Orange
In Stanley Kubrick's controversial 1971 adaptation of Anthony Burgess's 
novella, delinquent droog leader Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) swaggers into 
this King's Road "disc-boutique", chats up two lollipop-sucking girls and takes 
them home for "the old in-out". One of the fictional bands mentioned is Heaven 
17, a name adopted by the Sheffield synthpoppers a decade later.
