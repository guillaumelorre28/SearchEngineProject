1941-

"Every word I write almost has a religious feeling for me, and a religious 
intensity."

Birthplace

New Orleans, US

Education

San Francisco State University (political science); master's degree in 
creative writing.

Other jobs

I didn't have a career or a job. It was perfectly OK with my husband if I just 
wrote. So I had nothing to sustain me but my dreams.

Did you know?

She was christened Howard ("my mother was a bit of a Bohemian. She had the 
idea that naming a woman Howard was going to give that woman an unusual 
advantage in the world"); Anne was the name she claimed for herself on her 
first day at school.

Critical verdict

Raised to be a genius in a Bohemian family blighted by alcoholism, desperate 
from an early age for literary success, Rice finished her first novel in five 
weeks after her young daughter died of a blood disease (she is immortalised in 
Interview... as Claudia, the eternally five-year-old vampire). Adored and 
ridiculed in equal measure for her highly strung prose and bloody subject 
matter, she takes her inspiration from the dark side: "Writers write about what 
obsesses them. You draw those cards. I lost my mother when I was 14. My 
daughter died at the age of 6. I lost my faith as a Catholic. When I'm writing, 
the darkness is always there. I go where the pain is." She also writes as Anne 
Rampling and AN Roquelaure.

Recommended works

The Vampire Chronicles are her strongest work.

Influences

She turns to Henry James and Nabokov for inspiration, and says she learned 
about writing from Simenon and the early chapters of David Copperfield.

Now read on

Go back a century or two to Gothic fiction's most florid and compelling 
oddities, Charles Maturin's sympathy-for-the-devil Melmoth the Wanderer and the 
proto-de Sade epic The Monk by Matthew Lewis, or check out Angela Carter's 
18-rated fairy stories in The Bloody Chamber.

Adaptations

"My efforts with Hollywood are like things written in water," Rice has stated 
- though she pronounced herself satisfied with the lushly filmed Interview with 
the Vampire (dir Neil Jordan, 1994). Her first and second choices for the part 
of Lestat, incidentally, were Daniel Day-Lewis and Jeremy Irons. Her 
pseudonymous porno tome Exit to Eden, about an S&M island, was radically toned 
down for the screen.

Recommended biography

Prism of the Night by Katherine Ramsland is a psychological investigation of 
Rice and her novels, written with the vampire queen's blessing.

Criticism

The accessible yet scholarly Anne Rice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/annerice> Reader (ed Katherine Ramsland) 
includes a history of vampire literature, essays on Rice's work and two early 
short stories.
