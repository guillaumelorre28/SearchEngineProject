Midnight in Paris star Rachel McAdams is set to feature once again in a 
time-shift romcom bysigning up to play one of the lead roles in Richard 
Curtis's next film, About Time 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rachel-mcadams-about-time-working-title-323151>
.

Produced by Curtis's regular collaborators, the British outfit Working Title, 
About Time has already secured Domhnall Gleeson (Never Let Me Go 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137791/never-let-me-go>) as its male 
lead, and is described as a fantastical feel-good movie about a man and his 
ability to travel back in time" who "eventually meets the girl of his dreams".

McAdams replaces Zooey Deschanel 
<http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118051976.html>, who had originally looked 
like the leading candidate for the role.

McAdams's acting career has revived quickly after a two-year "break" in 
2006-7; the success ofMidnight in Paris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141834/midnight-in-paris> was quickly 
followed by another career shot in the arm, the Valentine's Day romcomThe Vow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145707/vow>, which took over $180m 
worldwide. She has also had her artistic credibility reinforced by being cast 
in Terrence Malick's as-yet-untitled romance, opposite Ben Affleck.
