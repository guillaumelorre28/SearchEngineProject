, 21 October) throws into sharp relief the attitude of another Mancunian, David 
Walker, the bishop of Manchester, who while campaigning for Britain to take in 
more refugees, has allegedly refused to open up his six-bedroom house to anyone 
because it is “smallish … by bishops’ standards

”. Where is the moral leadership? Bishop Walker has been usurped by Neville on 
this front. I’m sure the bishop has preached from Luke chapter 10 on more than 
one occasion; I wonder, when he reflects on this parable, whether he sees 
himself as the Good Samaritan or the priest?

George Osborne is his own worst enemy

”, I thought you’d be deluged with short, clever, pithy and humorous letters 
recalling Ernest Bevin who, when told that Herbert Morrison was his own worst 
enemy, said: “Not while I’m alive he ain’t.” So I didn’t write (Letters

• The late Scottish harpsichordist Lucy Carolan once delineated to me the 
precise gradations of Scots hospitality (Ian Jack

told (assume appropriate accent): in Glasgow, “You’ll be having your tea”; in 
Edinburgh, “You’ll havehad your tea”; in Aberdeen, “Come on in: we have 
numerous comestibles, atvairy reasonable praices”.
