The controversial Stanley Kubrick picture A Clockwork Orange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-clockwork-orange> is to receive it first 
ever airing on British television. Admittedly the channel in question - the 
digital station Sky Box Office - is still some way from fully-fledged 
terrestrial exposure, but it represents another step in the film's long journey 
back to mainstream acceptance.

Adapted from the novel by Anthony Burgess 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/anthonyburgess>, A Clockwork Orange tells 
the story of a gang of futuristic thugs (droogs) led by Malcolm McDowell's 
amoral, Beethoven-loving chieftain. The film was pulled from cinemas at 
Kubrick's own insistence in 1973, following several copycat acts of violence 
and a resulting storm in the British tabloids. An illicit screening at London's 
Scala cinema in 1993 led to a public prosecution.

A Clockwork Orange was finally re-released in British cinemas last March to 
huge acclaim and surprisingly strong box office. Its appearance on Sky Box 
Office suggests that a terrestrial TV screening may not be far in the future.
