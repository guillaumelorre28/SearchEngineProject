Boltongate Old Rectory, nr Ireby
 Boltongate Old Rectory 
Southwest of Carlisle and a smidgen north of the Lake District national park, 
this luxury B&B is a great base for exploring both the northern Lakes and the 
less well-trodden north Cumbrian coast, including theSolway Coast AONB 
<http://www.solwaycoastaonb.org.uk>. Set in an old rectory, bedrooms here come 
with big beds, fresh flowers, guest dressing gowns and en-suite shower rooms 
fitted with underfloor heating; the Plum room also has a huge, freestanding 
bath. Food is another draw; guests can book in for three-course dinners at 
weekends or order locally sourced deli platters on other evenings. Unusually 
for a B&B it's also licensed, with a small but expertly chosen selection of 
wines close at hand for booze-minded arrivals.

Fox & Pheasant Inn, Armathwaite
 Fox and Pheasant Inn, Armathwaite 
This is a proper village pub at the heart of its community, where new faces 
are eagerly welcomed into the regular crowd propping up the 16th-century bar. 
Food is traditional and generous; when you need to walk it off, head into 
adjacent Coombs Wood along a riverside path that climbs dramatically above red 
sandstone cliffs. There are five smart bedrooms, of which several overlook one 
of the finest trout and salmon rivers in the country – landlord Billy can set 
up a fishing lesson or day permit. The scenicSettle to Carlisle railway 
<http://www.settle-carlisle.co.uk/> (Armathwaite to Carlisle: 20 minutes) is a 
five-minute walk away.

Drybeck Hall, Appleby-in-Westmorland
 Drybeck Hall 
Cumbrian stays don't get much more traditional than this two-room B&B tucked 
in the Eden Valley, between Appleby and the M6. Set in a listed, 17th-century 
farmhouse, cocooned by wood-panelled walls, antique mirrors and posies of 
freshly picked flowers, there's also a tennis court on site if you want to 
brush up your backhand. It's less than five miles to the restaurants and pubs 
of Appleby but, if you'd rather stay put, owner Lulie will rustle up a 
three-course dinner given a bit of notice (homemade strawberry and damson 
ice-cream is one of her specialities).
•  01768 351487, drybeckhall.co.uk <http://www.drybeckhall.co.uk>. B&B doubles 
from £90, dinners from £25

Miners Arms, Nenthead
 Miners Arms, Nenthead 
If you're looking for a boutique B&B or a gastropub with rooms, walk on by 
because the Miners Arms is neither of those. A fairly unreconstructed pub in 
one of England's highest villages, what this does boast is a friendly welcome, 
local ales on tap, filling no-fuss meals and three smart bedrooms; the triple 
is the most stylish, with leather headboards set against exposed stone walls, 
plum-coloured furnishings, walk-in showers and underfloor heating. A godsend in 
these parts, not least for weary-thighed cyclists pedalling their way along the
Sea to Sea cycle route <http://www.c2c-guide.co.uk>, there's also plenty of 
space for storing wet or muddy clothes, and bikes.
• 01434 381427, nenthead.com <http://www.nenthead.com>. B&B doubles from £70, 
mains around £9

Crake Trees Manor, Crosby Ravensworth
 Crake Trees Manor, Penrith 
This glam farmhouse B&B, between the M6 and Appleby, has been pulling in 
punters over the last couple of years with its cosy shepherd's hut "suite" but 
it also has three more conventional double bedrooms. Lounge in guest rooms 
laced with age-old chaise longues and chunky woollen blankets, or perch at the 
oak breakfast table (co-owner Mike runs a separatebusiness making green oak 
furniture <http://www.erratics.co.uk>) and peer out at the widescreen views 
onto the surrounding hills and fields. Deli-style supper trays can be arranged 
but don't miss a stroll to the local boozer, theButcher's Arms 
<http://www.thebutchersarmscrosbyravensworth.com>, one of the UK's first 
community-run pubs.
• 01931 715205, craketreesmanor.co.uk <http://www.craketreesmanor.co.uk>. 
Doubles from £90, shepherd's hut from £70, both B&B, supper trays from £15

Lazonby Hall, Eden Valley
 Lazonby Hall 
Despite its Eden Valley location, this grand country house B&B was originally 
built, in the 19th century, for a Scottish laird and it has a touch of the 
baronial about it (though the owners prefer to think along auld alliance lines, 
likening it to a French chateau). Rooms are cosy and colourful, with turquoise 
throws, violet-blue bathrooms and, in one case, a riot of floral wallpaper. 
Don't be fooled by such comforts as rose showerheads or properly ironed 
bedlinen, though. A stay here is more like a visit to a friend's posh country 
pad than a hotel; two of the four bedrooms share bathrooms and the owners will 
come and pick you up from the local station free of charge. It's also 
fatteningly close to one of Cumbria's best cake bakers,The Watermill at Little 
Salkeld <http://www.organicmill.co.uk>.
• 01768 870300, lazonbyhall.co.uk <http://www.lazonbyhall.co.uk>. B&B doubles 
from £80

Calsfell View, Cartmel
 Cartmel, Calsfell View 
On the edge of Cartmel village, this modern B&B is technically outside the 
Lake District national park, though it's so close to its southern fringes that 
you could fling your toothbrush and almost hit Windermere. There's plenty to do 
besides visiting the Lakes. Local attractions, beyond the village's12th-century 
priory <http://www.cartmelpriory.org.uk>, tend towards the epicurean; fine 
dining atL'Enclume <http://www.lenclume.co.uk>, less fussy dining at sister 
restaurantRogan & Company <http://www.roganandcompany.co.uk> and sticky toffee 
puddings <http://www.cartmelvillageshop.co.uk>. Or stay in and put your feet up 
in one of two double bedrooms, helping yourself to a nip of sherry and weighing 
up the local art on the walls.

doubles from £65

Black Swan Inn, Culgaith
 Black Swan Inn 
This village pub, just east of Penrith, punches above its weight in food 
terms, with fabulous home-cured salmon and plates of local cheeses. Though not 
the prettiest village in the area, Culgaith is a useful stopping-off point if 
you're heading up-country or across to Scotch Corner and, with a Center Parcs 
two miles away, it's no stranger to visitors (go early to get a fireside table 
in the bar area, a much more atmospheric space to eat in than the dated 
restaurant). Its seven modern bedrooms are comfortable if not especially fancy 
but, for the price, they're a good deal with cream walls and beige carpets 
pepped up by treacle, chocolate and charcoal furnishings and shiny white 
bathrooms.
• 01768 88223, blackswanculgaith.co.uk <http://www.blackswanculgaith.co.uk>. 
B&B doubles from £85

The Black Swan, Ravenstonedale
 Black Swan Hotel, Ravenstonedale 
Ravenstonedale lies between the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales, its 
surrounding limestone plateaus and upland pastures offering an isolation that 
can be hard to find within the boundaries of its national park neighbours. Such 
remoteness makes it all the more pleasurable to come home to the Black Swan, 
where you'll find real ales, fell-reared feasts, country-house bedrooms and 
locally handmade soaps (which are for sale in the pub-owned village shop). The 
beer garden, with its tuneful stream, is a blissful place to sink a pint of 
Black Sheep after a hike in the Howgill Fells.
• 01539 623204, blackswanhotel.com <http://blackswanhotel.com/>. B&B doubles 
from £75

Chapelburn House, Brampton
 Chapleburn House 
This 19th-century coaching inn turned B&B gets understandably booked up with 
walkers tacklingHadrian's Wall  <http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/HadriansWall>. 
Russet carpets, antique beds and plump duvets create perfect surroundings to 
unwind in post-hike (one bedroom has a kingsize bed and an en suite shower 
while the other makes up for its smaller double bed with a huge bathroom 
featuring both cast-iron bath and stylish walk-in shower) and owners Matt and 
Katie will pick you up or drop off along the trail. If you're too weary to go 
out foraging, they'll also cook you a very locally sourced dinner (even the 
honey comes from their own hives).
• 01697 746595, chapelburn.com <http://www.chapelburn.com>. B&B doubles from 
£70, meals from £25 for three courses
