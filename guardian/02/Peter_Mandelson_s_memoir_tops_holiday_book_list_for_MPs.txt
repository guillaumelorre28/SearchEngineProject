It could be described as a busman's holiday: the most popular book MPs will be 
"relaxing" with on their summer breaks this year is Peter Mandelson's memoir of 
New Labour, The Third Man.

Already a bestseller, with more than 45,000 copies sold since it was published 
last month, Mandelson's title was the top summer book choice in an annual 
survey by Waterstone's of 152 MPs.

Continuing the Labour trend, Chris Mullin's strong-selling political diary, A 
View from the Foothills, came in joint second place, sharing the spot with 
Christopher Andrew's authorised history of MI5, The Defence of the Realm. The 
first volume of Alastair Campbell's diaries, Andrew Rawnsley's own story of New 
Labour, The End of the Party, David Willetts's critique of the baby boomer 
generation, The Pinch, and Amartya Sen's The Idea of Justice shared third place.

"Overall, this list shows that while New Labour have lost power, there is 
still great fascination about the era among politicians new and old. This bodes 
well for what should be the big beast of political memoirs this year – Tony 
Blair's A Journey," said Andrew Lake, Waterstone's politics buyer.

Other pool and beachside reads for MPs – and probably not many others – 
include The Times Guide to the House of Commons, The History of the 
Conservative Party, The History of the Labour Party and How Parliament Works, 
according to the survey.
