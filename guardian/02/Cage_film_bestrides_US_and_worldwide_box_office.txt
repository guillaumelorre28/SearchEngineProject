While the critically acclaimed The Departed and The Queen were basking in 
their Oscar glory this weekend, an unashamedly commercial movie was minting it 
at cinemas around the world.

Ghost Rider, the comic book adaptation starring Nicolas Cage as the devil's 
bounty hunter, has remained on top of the US and worldwide box offices for a 
second week running.

In America, the movie grossed $20m (£10m), bringing its earnings there to $79m 
(£40m). Ghost Rider managed to maintain its position in the face of stiff 
competition from box-office favourite Jim Carrey and his new film The Number 
23, which earned just over $14m (£7m).

Ghost Rider also replicated its Stateside success around the globe. It raked 
in close to $17m (£8.6m) across 43 countries, bringing its total tally outside 
the US so far to $40m (£20m).

The former number one film, Night at the Museum, still managed to make a buck. 
The Ben Stiller comedy took $11m (£5.6m) in 23 countries, to reach a worldwide 
total of $268m (£136m).
