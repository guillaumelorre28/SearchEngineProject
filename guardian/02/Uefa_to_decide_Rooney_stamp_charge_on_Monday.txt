Uefa <http://www.uefa.com> will decide on Monday whether to charge Wayne 
Rooney over his clash with Aalborg's Kasper Risgard at Old Trafford on 
Wednesday.

Risgard claimed the Manchester United striker had deliberately stamped on him 
during the first-half of the2–2 Champions League draw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/11/championsleague-manchesterunited>
 and left marks on his chest.

Allan Kuhn, Aalborg's stand-in manager, also felt that Rooney had overstepped 
the mark and Uefa has confirmed this morning that it will assess the incident, 
which was missed by the referee, Laurent Duhamel. Should Uefa concur with 
Risgard's view, Rooney will almost certainly be banned for the beginning of the 
knockout rounds in February.

Sir Alex Ferguson was offered the chance to present his view of the incident 
ahead of tomorrow's trip to Tottenham — which Rooney will miss after collecting 
five bookings — but declined to offer an opinion.

However, he is unhappy at the reporting of the incident, feeling Rooney's case 
has not been helped by numerous re-runs on television. "I am not going to 
discuss Wayne Rooney," he said. "You press guys have created most of it. You 
are not getting anything from this club at all onWayne Rooney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/wayne-rooney>. That is it, finished."
