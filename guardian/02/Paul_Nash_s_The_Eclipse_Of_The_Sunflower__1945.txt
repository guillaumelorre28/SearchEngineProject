Cosmic rays

A black sun free-wheels through a violet, inky haze, propelled by licks of 
flame. It’s a sunflower but not as we know it, transformed into a cosmic, 
almost abstract dream symbol by one of British modernism’s great romantics, 
Paul Nash.

Change of scenery

Nash was an official artist during the first world war, and his style became 
decidedly darker when he returned from the conflict. Now a sense of darkness 
creeped into his landscapes like this one, its pitch-black heart lending an 
apocalyptic feel.

Flowered up

Nash was also a fan of James Frazer’s classic study of religion, The Golden 
Bough. Despite its stormy mood, death seems to be seen here as the sacrifice 
that facilitates harvest. The flower-head tumbles away from its stalk like a 
spirit set free.

Cruel nature

Through Nash’s eyes, what might otherwise be quaint became mysterious and 
otherworldly. Part of the last series he created before his untimely death from 
pneumonia, this painting took flowers from his Banbury garden as its starting 
point.

England’s dreaming

Nash witnessed first-hand the horrors and marvels of the early 20th century 
while nurturing a vision of old Albion that owed much to William Blake.
