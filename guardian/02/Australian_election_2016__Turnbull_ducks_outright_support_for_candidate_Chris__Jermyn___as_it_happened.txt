Let's ground the bird

Malcolm Turnbull is back in Canberra, Bill Shorten is in Brisbane. The 
campaigns have folded their respective tents, so that’s enough for today. 
Thanks very much for your fine company.

Let’s summarise, succinctly.

 * Malcolm Turnbull tried to keep ahead of his same-sex marriage plebiscite 
problems,Bill Shorten tried to keep ahead of the sense that Labor is losing the 
final week of the campaign, andRichard Di Natale wasn’t entirely clear whether 
the Greens would negotiate with Labor on offshore processing or not in the 
event of a minority parliament.

This blog will be back tomorrow morning at first light. Until we meet again, 
enjoy your evening.

Derryn Hinch on the marriage plebiscite.

A plebiscite is better than nothing, so you have to vote for it.

Derryn Hinch on entering politics: 'You'll know I'm there'

David Leyonhjelm and Derryn Hinch are on Sky News now. Hinch actually has a 
decent prospect of success with his Senate campaign. The broadcaster points out 
that the Coalition’s anti-independent advertising has not targeted him or 
Leyonhjelm. Perhaps the government thinks they canwork with them, Hinch says 
with a chuckle.

Hinch is busily warming up to the prospect of being able to use parliamentary 
privilege to name and shame people, sex offenders and the like, which is one of 
his favourite past times.

You’ll know I’m there.

After a brief interval.

If I get to Canberra, Derryn Hinch will listen.

(I hope you’ve all braced yourselves.)

More of the prime minister speaking to his new friends on regional radio. This 
excerpt is from the chat this morning in central Victoria. Folks who have been 
watching intently the whole campaign will rememberChris Jermyn, the Liberal 
candidate who could not explain the Liberal party’s health policy but was an 
expert on the closing times of a bunch of local pizza restaurants. There’s been 
a few other japes since that high point several weeks back.

Q: Let’s go to one of the candidates in our area. We are broadcasting in the 
Bendigo area in central Victoria. Chris Jermyn, Liberal candidate you would 
know well from McEwen, your face is on all the posters with him of course – he 
is under scrutiny because of his electoral address. Do you support him?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well he is the endorsed Liberal candidate and he has the party’s support and 
my support but I can’t, you know obviously if there are issues, the issues that 
you raise, they are matters to be determined by the AEC, but I have been 
talking this morning with Megan Purcell, our candidate in Bendigo, and she is a 
young economist, a businesswoman. She’s got her own retail business and she’s 
there today announcing federal funding to support the restoration of your 
amazingly handsome soldiers’ memorial in Bendigo which is much admired and 
needs a bit of love I think.

Q: OK,y, well that’s good news indeed, but back with Chris Jermyn. You give 
him your unqualified support?

Malcolm Turnbull:

All of our candidates have my support absolutely.

Q: Including Chris Jermyn?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well he is one of our candidates and he has my support and I encourage the 
electors of McEwen to vote for him as the Liberal candidate.

Q: When you first heard this story though, what had happened here with this 
vacant block, did you want to get rid of him? I mean, you have a captain’s 
pick. Did you actually want to – you must have been furious when you heard 
about this?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well can I say to you, I understand your interest in this matter but you know 
the big choice that we’ve got on Saturday is who is going to form a government. 
Who is going to provide Australia the leadership that it needs, the strong 
economic leadership it needs, and the only way to ensure that your vote 
supports a strong Coalition majority government and a clear national economic 
plan is to vote for Liberal or National candidates. There is no other way to do 
that and that is the most important choice. The issues that you’re raising, I 
understand why the opponents of theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> want to raise those 
matters. If there’s been some issues they can be dealt with by the AEC, but 
fundamentally what we are choosing on Saturday is the next government of 
Australia and that decision is critical to our future.

The Labor leader Bill Shorten’s decision to nudge the door open in relation to 
a federal anti-corruption commission hasn’t gone down well with the Institute 
of Public Affairs. The IPA’sSimon Breheny:

A key responsibility of government is to uphold the rule of law. The risk of 
entrenching an Icac-like body at the federal level is that it may strip away 
legal rights, such as the right to silence. The risk to the rule of law and to 
legal rights is very significant. Corruption commissions at the state level 
have become show trials. Important rules of procedure that protect individuals 
against an overbearing state are ignored in the context of these public 
hearings. After a high court case against NSW Icac found that it has failed to 
act within its statutory powers, the federal government should reject the idea 
of implementing anything that resembles such a regime at the federal level.

Interesting Shorten did this today. It suggests he’s in nothing-to-lose 
territory. Unions tried to get up a commitment on an Icac at Labor’s national 
conference this time last year, but it got squashed. Flat.

6.27am BST 06:27  <> 

My colleagues Lenore Taylor and Gabrielle Chan have been working for a couple 
of days to deliver some cut through on the post-election environment.

I’ve been saying for much of this week that the prime minister can’t really 
offer voters a guarantee of stability with regards to implementing his agenda 
post-election because he’s not in control. Depending on what the voters decide, 
and the national polls (if we believe them) tell us the election is close, 
either leader,Malcolm Turnbull or Bill Shorten, faces a risk of a hung 
parliament. Then there’s the Senate. I don’t think anyone is forecasting a 
scenario where a major party emerges on 3 July with control of the Senate.

So Gabi and Lenore have been talking to as many of the major independent 
players as possible, and the Greens, about their positions on key policies, 
such as the Coalition’s company tax cuts or Labor’s negative gearing 
concessions. And the outlook is like this.

The Coalition’s full company tax cut plan and many of its long-stalled 
‘zombie’ savings have little chance of becoming law after the election, a 
Guardian Australia survey has revealed, despiteMalcolm Turnbull’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> claim only Labor 
would face the ‘chaos’ of negotiations with minor parties and independents.

And if Bill Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> 
was to form government after Saturday, he would be forced to negotiate to get 
his plans to limit negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions through 
the Senate.

If you’ve hung in with the coverage all day you’ll know the prime minister did 
a radio blitz earlier. A lot of the stations he spoke to I wasn’t able to 
stream on my handy radio app, so I’ve been waiting for transcripts. They are 
starting to come in now. This is some opening sortie from the presenter on ABC 
south coast radio.

Q: Prime minister, there’s a perception from some community leaders in 
Eden-Monaro that the Liberal member, Peter Hendy, has been missing in action. 
Is that why we’re speaking to you this morning?

Malcolm Turnbull:

I’m speaking to lots of local radio stations around Australia today and indeed 
as I have been this week but, no, Peter Hendy is an outstanding member – he’s a 
very important member of my team and a very important member both as the local 
member and assistant minister in the Coalition government. The choice really, 
Simon, is between aCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> majority government, 
stable with a clear economic plan for the future, or a vote for Labor or the 
Greens or the independents [that] has all of the horrors of a hung parliament, 
parliament in disarray, a Greens-Labor-independent alliance and a high debt, 
more deficit, high taxes. It’s not what Australia needs right now. We need 
stability and a clear plan, and that’s what we have.

Q: Well it’s good to be able to speak to you this morning. But you must be 
worried about the Coalition’s ability to retain Eden-Monaro. Is there a chance 
that it could lose its bellwether status on Saturday night?

Malcolm Turnbull:

You know I’d say to you, the voters of Eden-Monaro have a very, very solemn 
responsibility because each voter in Eden-Monaro and each voter in every 
electorate in Australia should treat their vote as though that is the one vote 
that will determine the next government. The choice, as I said, is between a 
stable Coalition majority government, which I lead, with a clear economic plan 
that’s fully funded, fully costed, bringing the budget deficits down, bringing 
the budget back into balance, supporting business, driving jobs in Eden-Monaro 
and around Australia. On the other hand, theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> with a very 
anti-business agenda, the most anti-business I can remember in generations and 
of course, the prospect, as they’ve admitted and owned up to, of higher 
deficits and more debt and of course higher taxes, particularly on investment. 
How is that going to help jobs and business opportunities in Eden-Monaro?

(Labor has been quite confident about Eden-Monaro, but we’ll see what Saturday 
night brings.)

This little insight is quite lovely. Watch the two women, members of the prime 
minister’s staff, handle a mass walk by when there’s a negative poster of the 
boss potentially in the camera shot. The clip is self explanatory, really. 
Campaigns take a village.

close  
Malcolm Turnbull is back in Canberra, Bill Shorten is in Brisbane. The 
campaigns have folded their respective tents, so that’s enough for today. 
Thanks very much for your fine company.

Let’s summarise, succinctly.

 * Malcolm Turnbull tried to keep ahead of his same-sex marriage plebiscite 
problems,Bill Shorten tried to keep ahead of the sense that Labor is losing the 
final week of the campaign, andRichard Di Natale wasn’t entirely clear whether 
the Greens would negotiate with Labor on offshore processing or not in the 
event of a minority parliament.

This blog will be back tomorrow morning at first light. Until we meet again, 
enjoy your evening.
 
Derryn Hinch on the marriage plebiscite.

A plebiscite is better than nothing, so you have to vote for it.
 
David Leyonhjelm and Derryn Hinch are on Sky News now. Hinch actually has a 
decent prospect of success with his Senate campaign. The broadcaster points out 
that the Coalition’s anti-independent advertising has not targeted him or 
Leyonhjelm. Perhaps the government thinks they canwork with them, Hinch says 
with a chuckle.

Hinch is busily warming up to the prospect of being able to use parliamentary 
privilege to name and shame people, sex offenders and the like, which is one of 
his favourite past times.

You’ll know I’m there.

After a brief interval.

If I get to Canberra, Derryn Hinch will listen.

(I hope you’ve all braced yourselves.)
 
More of the prime minister speaking to his new friends on regional radio. This 
excerpt is from the chat this morning in central Victoria. Folks who have been 
watching intently the whole campaign will rememberChris Jermyn, the Liberal 
candidate who could not explain the Liberal party’s health policy but was an 
expert on the closing times of a bunch of local pizza restaurants. There’s been 
a few other japes since that high point several weeks back.

Q: Let’s go to one of the candidates in our area. We are broadcasting in the 
Bendigo area in central Victoria. Chris Jermyn, Liberal candidate you would 
know well from McEwen, your face is on all the posters with him of course – he 
is under scrutiny because of his electoral address. Do you support him?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well he is the endorsed Liberal candidate and he has the party’s support and 
my support but I can’t, you know obviously if there are issues, the issues that 
you raise, they are matters to be determined by the AEC, but I have been 
talking this morning with Megan Purcell, our candidate in Bendigo, and she is a 
young economist, a businesswoman. She’s got her own retail business and she’s 
there today announcing federal funding to support the restoration of your 
amazingly handsome soldiers’ memorial in Bendigo which is much admired and 
needs a bit of love I think.

Q: OK,y, well that’s good news indeed, but back with Chris Jermyn. You give 
him your unqualified support?

Malcolm Turnbull:

All of our candidates have my support absolutely.

Q: Including Chris Jermyn?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well he is one of our candidates and he has my support and I encourage the 
electors of McEwen to vote for him as the Liberal candidate.

Q: When you first heard this story though, what had happened here with this 
vacant block, did you want to get rid of him? I mean, you have a captain’s 
pick. Did you actually want to – you must have been furious when you heard 
about this?

Malcolm Turnbull:

Well can I say to you, I understand your interest in this matter but you know 
the big choice that we’ve got on Saturday is who is going to form a government. 
Who is going to provide Australia the leadership that it needs, the strong 
economic leadership it needs, and the only way to ensure that your vote 
supports a strong Coalition majority government and a clear national economic 
plan is to vote for Liberal or National candidates. There is no other way to do 
that and that is the most important choice. The issues that you’re raising, I 
understand why the opponents of theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> want to raise those 
matters. If there’s been some issues they can be dealt with by the AEC, but 
fundamentally what we are choosing on Saturday is the next government of 
Australia and that decision is critical to our future.
 
The Labor leader Bill Shorten’s decision to nudge the door open in relation to 
a federal anti-corruption commission hasn’t gone down well with the Institute 
of Public Affairs. The IPA’sSimon Breheny:

A key responsibility of government is to uphold the rule of law. The risk of 
entrenching an Icac-like body at the federal level is that it may strip away 
legal rights, such as the right to silence. The risk to the rule of law and to 
legal rights is very significant. Corruption commissions at the state level 
have become show trials. Important rules of procedure that protect individuals 
against an overbearing state are ignored in the context of these public 
hearings. After a high court case against NSW Icac found that it has failed to 
act within its statutory powers, the federal government should reject the idea 
of implementing anything that resembles such a regime at the federal level.

Interesting Shorten did this today. It suggests he’s in nothing-to-lose 
territory. Unions tried to get up a commitment on an Icac at Labor’s national 
conference this time last year, but it got squashed. Flat.

My colleagues Lenore Taylor and Gabrielle Chan have been working for a couple 
of days to deliver some cut through on the post-election environment.

I’ve been saying for much of this week that the prime minister can’t really 
offer voters a guarantee of stability with regards to implementing his agenda 
post-election because he’s not in control. Depending on what the voters decide, 
and the national polls (if we believe them) tell us the election is close, 
either leader,Malcolm Turnbull or Bill Shorten, faces a risk of a hung 
parliament. Then there’s the Senate. I don’t think anyone is forecasting a 
scenario where a major party emerges on 3 July with control of the Senate.

So Gabi and Lenore have been talking to as many of the major independent 
players as possible, and the Greens, about their positions on key policies, 
such as the Coalition’s company tax cuts or Labor’s negative gearing 
concessions. And the outlook is like this.

The Coalition’s full company tax cut plan and many of its long-stalled 
‘zombie’ savings have little chance of becoming law after the election, a 
Guardian Australia survey has revealed, despiteMalcolm Turnbull’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> claim only Labor 
would face the ‘chaos’ of negotiations with minor parties and independents.

And if Bill Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> 
was to form government after Saturday, he would be forced to negotiate to get 
his plans to limit negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions through 
the Senate.

If you’ve hung in with the coverage all day you’ll know the prime minister did 
a radio blitz earlier. A lot of the stations he spoke to I wasn’t able to 
stream on my handy radio app, so I’ve been waiting for transcripts. They are 
starting to come in now. This is some opening sortie from the presenter on ABC 
south coast radio.

Q: Prime minister, there’s a perception from some community leaders in 
Eden-Monaro that the Liberal member, Peter Hendy, has been missing in action. 
Is that why we’re speaking to you this morning?

Malcolm Turnbull:

I’m speaking to lots of local radio stations around Australia today and indeed 
as I have been this week but, no, Peter Hendy is an outstanding member – he’s a 
very important member of my team and a very important member both as the local 
member and assistant minister in the Coalition government. The choice really, 
Simon, is between aCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> majority government, 
stable with a clear economic plan for the future, or a vote for Labor or the 
Greens or the independents [that] has all of the horrors of a hung parliament, 
parliament in disarray, a Greens-Labor-independent alliance and a high debt, 
more deficit, high taxes. It’s not what Australia needs right now. We need 
stability and a clear plan, and that’s what we have.

Q: Well it’s good to be able to speak to you this morning. But you must be 
worried about the Coalition’s ability to retain Eden-Monaro. Is there a chance 
that it could lose its bellwether status on Saturday night?

Malcolm Turnbull:

You know I’d say to you, the voters of Eden-Monaro have a very, very solemn 
responsibility because each voter in Eden-Monaro and each voter in every 
electorate in Australia should treat their vote as though that is the one vote 
that will determine the next government. The choice, as I said, is between a 
stable Coalition majority government, which I lead, with a clear economic plan 
that’s fully funded, fully costed, bringing the budget deficits down, bringing 
the budget back into balance, supporting business, driving jobs in Eden-Monaro 
and around Australia. On the other hand, theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> with a very 
anti-business agenda, the most anti-business I can remember in generations and 
of course, the prospect, as they’ve admitted and owned up to, of higher 
deficits and more debt and of course higher taxes, particularly on investment. 
How is that going to help jobs and business opportunities in Eden-Monaro?

(Labor has been quite confident about Eden-Monaro, but we’ll see what Saturday 
night brings.)
 
This little insight is quite lovely. Watch the two women, members of the prime 
minister’s staff, handle a mass walk by when there’s a negative poster of the 
boss potentially in the camera shot. The clip is self explanatory, really. 
Campaigns take a village.
