Football and wine may not be a traditional pairing, but for fans of both an 
invitation to stay at Andrés Iniesta’s family vineyard is a unique opportunity.

The FC Barcelona and Spain player – widely agreed to be among the best 
footballers in the world – has turned Airbnb host in order to open the doors of 
theBodega Iniesta <http://bodegainiesta.es/en/> in the middle of the 
Castilla-La Mancha wine region.

The one-off listing, which went live on AirBnb on Friday morning 
<https://www.airbnb.es/rooms/4521684>, invites the public to explain in 100 
words why they deserve to visit. The winner and a guest will be given a 
personal tour of the vineyard by Iniesta and his family and get to see a 
“surprisingly private side” of the footballer.

 A vine romance … Andrés Iniesta at his family vineyard 
“For my family, the Bodega is a dream come true,” says Iniesta. “I want to 
share this charming space with travellers who are looking for a 
once-in-a-lifetime experience.”

It is the first time the Bodega has opened its doors to visitors in this way. 
Guests will stay in a “cosy” cottage on the site and enjoy a “delicious dinner” 
before spending the evening relaxing by the fireside. They will also be shown 
around Iniesta’s hometown of Fuentealbilla.

“Although people know me for my passion for football, we hope to share our 
other concerns,” writes Iniesta. “Such as our love of nature and the exquisite 
fruit of our vineyards.”

However, the stay at Bodega is not without its house rules. As Iniesta warns 
on the listing: “Be gentle with vines: in this field it’s better not to go with 
football boots.”

Iniesta is not the first professional footballer to dabble with Airbnb: during 
the World CupRonaldinho put his Brazilian mansion up

on the site, charging guests $15,000 a night.

“Anyone who knows me knows that I love entertaining friends and people around 
the world,” wrote Ronaldinho in the listing. “I lovepagode (a type of samba), 
spending time with my family, and of course, football! I hope you like my 
house.”
