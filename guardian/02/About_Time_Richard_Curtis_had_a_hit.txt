The winner

Following a summer season dominated by animation and action blockbusters, 
cinemas welcomed a more grownup programming mix after kids and teens went back 
to school after the long holiday. The reliable Richard Curtis delivered another 
box-office chart-topper,About Time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155249/about-time>, thanks to a debut 
of £1.76m, including £385,000 in Wednesday/Thursday takings. That's almost dead 
level with the opening salvo of 2009'sThe Boat That Rocked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/128972/boat-that-rocked>: £1.80m, 
including £471,000 in previews.

The Boat That Rocked was an expensively made film that ended up with a weak 
£6.2m total in the UK – a massive disappointment after the £36.8m success of 
2003'sLove Actually <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/96863/love.actually>
. About Time suggests itself as a tricky distribution challenge since the 
romance and comedy come with a time-travel sci-fi element, and also intimate 
family drama: great if all the genre hooks accrete; less so if they cancel each 
other out. On top of that, it's been a full decade since Curtis enjoyed a real 
box-office hit. The director's name is the strongest marketable ingredient in 
About Time since the protagonist is played by the talented but commercially 
unproven Domhnall Gleeson; co-stars Rachel McAdams andBill Nighy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/sep/06/bill-nighy-five-best-moments>
 also add value.

After encouraging results from advance "talker" free screenings, undertaken 
with various media partners, distributor Universal will be hoping that positive 
word-of-mouth will sustainAbout Time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/about-time> in the coming weeks, pushing its 
total ahead of that of The Boat That Rocked.

The runner-up

After 2004's creatively calamitous The Chronicles of Riddick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/101912/chronicles.of.riddick>, Vin 
Diesel's sci-fi franchise might have been considered beyond resuscitation. But 
with The Fast and the Furious series keeping him in the blockbuster limelight, 
the muscular star was able to mount a belated reboot, promising an 
adult-skewing sequel that would satisfy fans of the originalPitch Black 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81061/pitch.black>. Rated R in the US 
(as opposed to PG-13 for Chronicles),Riddick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156163/riddick> was targeted firmly at 
genre fans, who came out in reasonable numbers. Here in the UK, it opened with 
a decent £1.42m, although that includes £445,000 from Wednesday and Thursday. 
Without the previews, the weekend tally falls below £1m. This compares with a 
UK debut of £1.04m for Chronicles, without the benefit of previews. Pitch Black 
kicked off its run in 2000 with £901,000. Released at 400 cinemas, Riddick was 
in 156 fewer locations than About Time. Consequently, its screen average is 
higher: £3,538, as against £3,167 for the Curtis film.

Strip out Riddick's previews, and runner-up place actually belongs to One 
Direction: This Is Us <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156161>, with 
£1.12m. The film has accrued £5.8m so far, which compares with £8.1m forMichael 
Jackson's This Is It 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131430/michael-jackson-s-this-is-it>at 
the same stage of its run. However, the Jackson film opened with a big bang and 
then experienced rapid burnout, dropping by 52%, 65% and 76% during successive 
weekends. A 49% drop at the weekend for This Is Us, suggests only slightly more 
hope for a gentler decay rate.

The arthouse winner
 Suave … Toni Servillo and Galatea Ranzi in La Grande Bellezza. 
While summer 2013 hasn't exactly been buoyant overall for arthouse films, it's 
been exceptionally weak for foreign language titles – outside of Bollywood, of 
course. Now, at last, a foreign arthouse picture has arrived that is winning 
attention from audiences: Paolo Sorrentino'sThe Great Beauty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154524/great-beauty>. With a debut of 
£117,000 from 25 screens, delivering a site average of £4,682, it's 
convincingly the strongest opening in the UK ever for a Sorrentino film. The 
director's previous best debut wasIl Divo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/124317/divo>'s £72,000 from 30 screens. 
The biggest cumulative total for a Sorrentino film isThe Consequences of Love 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/102973/consequences.of.love>'s 
£451,000, in 2005, and distributor Artificial Eye will be hoping it can push 
The Great Beauty past that tally. Best result at the weekend was London' s 
Curzon Soho, with over £17,000. Reacting to the success, the BFI has granted 
the film a "Sleeper" cash award to add screens and help sustain advertising.

The Great Beauty led a long field of niche pictures – a bewildering 19 new 
releases at the weekend (see "Other openers" below). These included US indie
Ain't Them Bodies Saints 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155247/ain-t-them-bodies-saints> (a 
so-so £52,600 from 45 cinemas), the well-reviewed, Vienna-setMuseum Hours 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149892/museum-hours> (£10,800 from 
nine) and 1970s true storyAny Day Now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156173/any-day-now> (a weak £8,800 from 
17). In such a crowded space, only titles that punch through as must-see 
propositions are likely to thrive, which is what The Great Beauty has managed 
to achieve. Five-star reviews, including from theGuardian's Peter Bradshaw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/05/le-grande-bellezza-great-beauty-review>
, presumably helped.

The mid-table battle

Allstar/Columbia 
When Elysium <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156629/elysium> opened at 
the top spot with £3.13m, including £974,000 in previews,We're the Millers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156158/we-re-the-millers> landed in 
second place with £1.51m. The following weekend the gap narrowed: £1.21m for 
the Neill Blomkamp sc-fi and £1.12m for the Rawson Marshall Thurber comedy. 
Now, in the third week of play, the situations reverse: £919,000 for Millers, 
and £777,000 for Elysium. Of course, by cumulative total, Elysium is still well 
ahead and Millers will need to sustain a strong run to catch it.

Since momentarily drifting out of the top 10 in the second week of August, 
Despicable Me 2 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155771/despicable-me-2> 
has put on a strong run of chart positions that consistently seem to defy 
gravity: back up to 10th place, then two weeks at ninth and now up to eighth. 
In that time, several major new releases – includingKick-Ass 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155968/kick-ass-2>, 2 Guns 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156151/2-guns)> and The Mortal 
Instruments: City of Bones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156639/mortal-instruments> – have come 
and gone in the top 10. Disney'sPlanes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156154/planes> and Monsters University 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155588/monsters-university> are 
likewise experiencing slim declines, andThe Smurfs 2  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156070/smurfs-2> and Percy Jackson: Sea 
of Monsters <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156147/percy-jackson> are 
holding up nicely. Despite the return of most kids to school last Wednesday, 
families are evidently still catching up with the summer cinema offer.

The future

Although weekend takings overall rank only 44th out of 52 for the past year, 
the session is nevertheless a healthy 32% ahead of the equivalent frame from 
2012, when Dredd, Lawless and Anna Karenina all landed in the top three, with 
underwhelming grosses. Cinema owners have reason to hope that the market will 
continue to out-perform 2012 levels with the arrival this week of Ron Howard's 
much-buzzedRush <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156181/rush>, depicting 
a famous Formula 1 rivalry. Roland Emmerich'sWhite House Down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154513/white-house-down>, starring 
Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx, would be more eagerly anticipated had it not 
already under-performed in the US. Horror sequel Insidious: Chapter 2 should 
play solidly to its target audience. And animation Justin and the Knights of 
Valour couldn't have asked for a better trailer platform than the one recently 
provided by this summer's buoyant family market.
