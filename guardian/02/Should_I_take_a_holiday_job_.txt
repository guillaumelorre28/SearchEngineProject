Q I am a second-year student at university and I am already several thousand 
pounds in debt. My student loan just disappears in living costs, and I seem to 
overspend just in order to go out with my mates a bit at the weekends. I am 
thinking of taking on a holiday job to cover some of my debts, but then a 
friend said it wouldn't be worth it because I would only have to pay tax. Is 
this true?

A If you are regularly in debt, then you firstly need to draw up a budget to 
help you manage your money, then you can look at areas where you could 
economise. If after this you decide you still need a job, it could be a 
positive step, because it will give you good work experience to put on your CV 
and impress future employers.

As for income tax, you will start to pay this when the money that you earn 
exceeds your personal allowance.

Each person has an allowance which lets them earn money without paying tax. In 
the tax year until April 2003 it is £4,615. Once you have earned more than 
that, you start to pay tax at 10% on your first tranche of income up to £1,920. 
If you earn more than this, the basic rate of tax applies for the next tranche 
from £1,921 to £29,900. After that you're in the higher rate tax bracket of 40% 
- which is not that likely if you are still a student unless you are running 
your own successful business!

If you need more specific help, you could talk to the National Debtline on 
0808 808 4000 or to your student welfare officer on campus.
