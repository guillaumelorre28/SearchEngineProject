The government is considering a new tiered postal system where customers pay a 
premium for next-day delivery.


Australia Post <https://www.theguardian.com/business/australia-post> wants to 
charge customers extra to deliver letters within a designated time – for 
example the next day – while regular mail could take longer.

The government-owned postal service says losses due to plummeting demand in 
its letter businesscould overwhelm the entire company

 if changes aren’t made.

The communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, says the government, which has 
to approve changes to postal services, is reviewing the request.

“It’s under consideration,” Turnbull told the Nine Network on Friday.

Australia Post must earn $3 for every parcel delivery to offset the decline in 
the letter business.

“The profits are swamped by the losses in the letter business,” Turnbull said, 
adding the only option was to cut costs.

The postal service reported a 34.5% decline in full year profit to $116.2m on 
Thursday.

Profit was pulled back by losses of $328.4m in the mail business amid a drop 
in letter volumes and higher costs.

Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, warned the government not to forget 
about people in regional and rural Australia when making a decision.

“We’ve got to keep in our minds that it’s a big country and we’ve got a lot of 
people who live in remote areas,” she said.

“We don’t want to do anything that cuts them off.”
