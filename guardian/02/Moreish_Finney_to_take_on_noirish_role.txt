Albert Finney <https://www.theguardian.com/film/albert-finney> may take the 
lead role in the bizarrely titled indie feature, Dinner Music For A Pack Of 
Hungry Cannibals.

Writer/director Willard Carroll's project would star Finney as a newspaper 
columnist who gets involved in a murder case. The big twist is that it seems 
that none of the suspects wanted the victim dead.

Carroll told Variety that Finney liked the script because it "has a lot of 
humour to undercut its noir aspects".

Finney, a five-time Oscar nominee, is currently on a roll. His portrayal of 
Winston Churchill on the eve of the second world war in the acclaimed 
miniseries The Gathering Storm won him an Emmy this year, while his 
scene-stealing turn as attorney Ed Masry in Erin Brockovich garnered a best 
supporting actor Oscar nomination last year.
