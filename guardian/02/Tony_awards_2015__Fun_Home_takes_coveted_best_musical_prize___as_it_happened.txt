Oh what a night!

Kayla Epstein

Well that’s it for the 69th Annual Tony Awards. The big winner of the night 
was Fun Home, which won five trophies in key races like best musical, best 
actor in a musical, best director of a musical, and best book of a musical. Its 
young star Syndey Lucas, meanwhile, won all of our hearts. The Curious Case of 
the Dog in the Night-Time tied with five as well, including best play and the 
best actor prize for young Alex Sharp.


The King and I followed closely on their heels with four Tonys, including one 
— FINALLY! — for Kelli O’Hara.

As for the hosts? Alan Cumming and Kristen Chenoweth kept the show zipping 
along smoothly, with a few inventive costume changes and just enough banter to 
keep viewers entertained. It was more PG than we expected, given Cumming’s
tendency towards the suggestive.

As for disappointments: Both Kayla and Jana are pretty peeved that Hand to God 
walked away empty handed. The play tells the tale of a mother and son’s descent 
into madness after the death of the family patriarch. It featured a spectacular 
Gollum/Smeagol-esque performance from Steven Boyer, who played both a troubled 
young boy and his demonic sock puppet, Tyrone. It’s dark, profane, and utterly 
hilarious. Tickets for Fun Home and Curious Incident are going to be impossible 
to come by for the next couple weeks, so skip the rush lines and see this 
instead.

Alex Sharp, winner of the award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading 
Role in a Play for “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time”. 
Photograph: Jemal Countess/Getty Images 
Alex Sharp, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is one of the 
winners.

Sharp said that he was ”surprised to be holding this [award]” and that the 
moment he won was the “highest adrenaline moments of [his] life”.

“It’s too late, I am already stuck up and decadent,” he joked with the 
reporters when asked about whether winning would change him.

“I would like to take this opportunity to say that my fellow nominees are all 
extraordinary actors that I feel blessed to say that I am equal to them,” he 
said.

I feel extraordinary to be holding this. I feel like I won it for my 
character, Christopher, and for people like Christopher, people that he 
represents. I feel like that’s where the victory lies, not over my competitors.”

sixth Tony nomination. To her parents, she said: “This time you don’t have to 
pretend it’s ok.”

Well that’s it for the 69th Annual Tony Awards. The big winner of the night 
was Fun Home, which won five trophies in key races like best musical, best 
actor in a musical, best director of a musical, and best book of a musical. Its 
young star Syndey Lucas, meanwhile, won all of our hearts. The Curious Case of 
the Dog in the Night-Time tied with five as well, including best play and the 
best actor prize for young Alex Sharp.


The King and I followed closely on their heels with four Tonys, including one 
— FINALLY! — for Kelli O’Hara.

As for the hosts? Alan Cumming and Kristen Chenoweth kept the show zipping 
along smoothly, with a few inventive costume changes and just enough banter to 
keep viewers entertained. It was more PG than we expected, given Cumming’s
tendency towards the suggestive.

As for disappointments: Both Kayla and Jana are pretty peeved that Hand to God 
walked away empty handed. The play tells the tale of a mother and son’s descent 
into madness after the death of the family patriarch. It featured a spectacular 
Gollum/Smeagol-esque performance from Steven Boyer, who played both a troubled 
young boy and his demonic sock puppet, Tyrone. It’s dark, profane, and utterly 
hilarious. Tickets for Fun Home and Curious Incident are going to be impossible 
to come by for the next couple weeks, so skip the rush lines and see this 
instead.

Alex Sharp, winner of the award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading 
Role in a Play for “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time”.

Alex Sharp, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is one of the 
winners.

Sharp said that he was ”surprised to be holding this [award]” and that the 
moment he won was the “highest adrenaline moments of [his] life”.

“It’s too late, I am already stuck up and decadent,” he joked with the 
reporters when asked about whether winning would change him.

“I would like to take this opportunity to say that my fellow nominees are all 
extraordinary actors that I feel blessed to say that I am equal to them,” he 
said.

I feel extraordinary to be holding this. I feel like I won it for my 
character, Christopher, and for people like Christopher, people that he 
represents. I feel like that’s where the victory lies, not over my competitors.”
