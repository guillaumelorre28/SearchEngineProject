Having fronted ITV's failed Daybreak with Christine Bleakley two years ago, 
Adrian Chiles has more right than most to comment on its successor Good Morning 
Britain. The presenter tells the Mirror that the new "national sport" is giving 
ITV breakfast shows a "bloody kicking", adding: “They just have to stick to 
their guns. It is a perfectly good show now, it was a perfectly good show when 
we left. It wasn’t getting the audience so they changed it. They are good 
broadcasters and they will find a way. It seems to be national sport to give it 
a bloody kicking and having been on the end of that it is no fun. I am not 
enjoying watching them suffer now. They have just got to stick to it and they 
will be fine, it will come round, it just needs to be given time and it is 
difficult in the current climate.” And he says he is still living with the 
trauma of Daybreak: “I haven’t slept properly since. It was a stressful time as 
you can imagine.” Chiles, who is travelling to Brazil as part of ITV's World 
Cup squad, says of his other role, as a football host: “Life is very 
straightforward. You get out of bed and go watch football then you broadcast 
about football then you go out and eat and drink and talk about football." 
Monkey hopes he manages to squeeze in a bit of kip somewhere.
