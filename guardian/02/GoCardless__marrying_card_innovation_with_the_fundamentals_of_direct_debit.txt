Ahead of the Activate London Summit 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2014/may/02/activate-london-2014-programme>
, Matt Robinson, co-founder of GoCardless, spoke to us about innovation in the 
fintech sector and what the future of payments may look like.

Can you tell us a little about your role at GoCardless?
I'm heavily involved in all areas of the business, however, I have spent the 
last year building our sales and marketing teams from scratch. Now that we have 
pretty robust systems and processes in place for each it's become a case of 
scaling those and other parts of the business so I spend 50%+ of my time hiring.

What were your reasons for founding it?
Max Levchin said "Being an entrepreneur is not about being in love with an 
idea, it's about being in love with running a company" and that is completely 
true for us. Whilst we had experienced some of the problems of payments prior 
to starting, the idea was not the driving force, it was a desire to build 
something that helped a large number of people and simultaneously to build an 
organisation where great people could go to do great work.

How does GoCardless differ to other online payment platforms?
We use direct debit which means that we are far better for recurring payments. 
We're marrying all the great innovation seen in the card world over the past 
few years (great APIs, instant set-up and approvals) with the strong 
fundamentals of direct debit (incredibly low fees and failure rates and 
complete control over payment collection).

You've recently raised $7m in Series B funding 
<https://gocardless.com/blog/series-b-funding/>. How is GoCardless planning to 
use this?
Expanding the team. There are a number of incredibly exciting opportunities 
for us to attack in order to build a massive business, however, we do not have 
the bandwidth to do so right now. Chief amongst these are developing our 
offering for large enterprise clients (organisations doing 100,000 â€“ 10m 
recurring payments per month) and expanding across Europe.

What does the future of payments look like?
Arguably payments are ultimately going to become a homogenous good, and over 
time you will see a constant erosion of transaction fees down to zero. As a 
result companies will look to make money in new ways, chiefly through data. For 
example, through intelligent cross-selling (imagineAmazon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon>'s recommendation service across 
the web) or allowing companies to use that data to make better decisions 
(exposing more granular financial data to credit providers in order to help 
consumers get better interest rates).

Finally, what is your message for the delegates attending the Guardian's 
Activate London Summit?
To consumers of financial services: don't accept mediocre products, services 
or experiences. There is so much innovation in this space whether it be 
business-to-business, business-to-consumer (Nutmeg <http://www.nutmeg.com/>, 
Stripe <https://stripe.com/gb>) or consumer-to-consumer (TransferWise 
<https://transferwise.com/>).

To entrepreneurs: the barriers to entry for new startups in the financial 
space may seem high, but once overcome there is so much opportunity for 
disruptive innovation. Pick one of the many mediocre products or services 
provided by incumbents and find a way to do it better.

Matt Robinson will be speaking at this year's Activate London Summit
