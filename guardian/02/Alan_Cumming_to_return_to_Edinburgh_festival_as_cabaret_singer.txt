Alan Cumming will this summer make a return to the Edinburgh international 
festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/aug/07/edinburgh-fringe-international-festivals-theatre>
 – not as an actor, but as a cabaret singer and club promoter.

Cumming is to take up residence in the EIF’s base near Edinburgh Castle for 
three weeks with a cabaret show calledAlan Cumming 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alan-cumming> Sings Sappy Songs.

It is a show he has performed in New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/03/alan-cumming-sings-sappy-songs-review>
, but his commitments on the hit TV show The Good Wife means there has never 
been an extended run.

Festival director Fergus Linehan said Cumming, who last performed at the 
festival in The Bacchae in 2007 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/aug/13/edinburghfestival2007.edinburghfestival3>
, had demands which EIF was delighted to agree to.

“We said, ‘Would you come and do the show?’ and he said, ‘Yes, on the basis 
that I can then have a club.’ We said absolutely.”

Precisely how it will work remains to be seen. “Maybe it will be him 
performing, maybe he will play some records, maybe he will just hang about. 
People are saying it’s madness because so many people will turn up, but 
hopefully it will be fine.”

Cumming is one of a long list of internationally acclaimed artists heading to 
the festival this year, announced at the programme launch in Edinburgh on 
Wednesday.

In total, the festival will host 2,442 artists from 36 countries.

The major classical names this year include pianists András Schiff and Daniil 
Trifonov, mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, violinist Maxim Vengerov and soprano 
Anja Kampe; while orchestras include the Leipzig Gewandhaus, the Rotterdam 
Philharmonic and the Russian National Orchestra.

There will be major productions from two of the world’s leading opera 
festivals – Norma from Salzburg and Così fan tutte from Aix.

Theatre highlights include the European premiere of a new production of 
Tennessee Williams’s The Glass Menagerie, directed by John Tiffany and starring 
Cherry Jones (President Allison Taylor in 24) in the lead role.

The 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s death will be marked with 
Thomas Ostermeier’s Richard III from Berlin’s Schaubühne theatre 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mLOvbA2JZw>; Cheek by Jowl’s Measure for 
Measure, in a collaboration with Moscow’s Pushkin Theatre; and a re-imagining 
of Twelfth Night – with Illyria as a 1970s seaside holiday resort – from the 
France-based company of Dan Jemmett.

Barry Humphries will leave Dame Edna behind as he presents and performs an 
evening of Weimar cabaret with performance artistMeow Meow, soon to be seen in 
A Midsummer Night’s Dream at Shakespeare’s Globe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/16/emma-rice-wows-by-casting-meow-meow-in-first-globe-production>
.

The contemporary music strand, meanwhile, includes Youssou N’Dour, Young 
Fathers, Sigur Rós and Mogwai.
