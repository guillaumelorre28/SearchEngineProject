In a statement, Barratt said Google 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> Fiber would continue to provide 
service in a handful of cities where it’s already operating, including Atlanta, 
Austin and Charlotte.

But it will pause further plans in at least eight more metropolitan areas 
where it has been holding exploratory talks with local officials. Those include 
Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Dallas, Tampa and Jacksonville in Florida, Portland in 
Oregon and Los Angeles and San Jose in California.

Barratt didn’t say how many jobs would be cut. His statement described the 
Access business as “solid”, but said it would make “changes to focus our 
business and product strategy” and incorporate new technology.

A recent report by the tech news site the Information said the business was 
under pressure by theAlphabet <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/alphabet> 
CEO, Larry Page, to cut costs after failing to meet financial goals, including 
a target of signing up five million subscribers.

Barratt said he would continue to serve as an adviser to Page.
