A refugee on Nauru <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nauru> says he has been 
denied appropriate medical treatment since suffering a heart attack more than 
one month ago.

On 5 November the man, in his early 30s, presented at the Republic of Nauru 
hospital with chest pain, dizziness, numb feet, cold hands and sweating.

He was told by doctors that he needed medical treatment that could not be 
provided on the island because the hospital is not equipped with a cardiology 
unit, according to an advocate with the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, Natasha 
Blucher.

International Health & Medical Services (IHMS), contracted by the Australian 
government to provide healthcare to asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru, 
approved the man’s transfer to Papua New Guinea for treatment, Blucher said.

“He was told he would be sent on 23 November, which came and went, and then a 
doctor rang him on December 1 and said there had been problems with planes to 
Papua New Guinea and that he would be sent within one week,” she said. “But he 
still hasn’t been transferred.”

In a statement IHMS said it was “not contracted to provide acute and 
specialist care to refugees”. “Nor is IHMS involved in the management of the 
overseas medical referral process for refugees.”

The man, who wanted to be identified under the pseudonym “Yusuf”, told 
Guardian Australia through an interpreter that he was intermittently suffering 
from chest pains, chills and numbness.

“I’m not feeling well at all right now,” he said. “I’m really upset of course. 
I’m upset first of all but I’m mentally disturbed because I feel they’re doing 
this to push myself to the brink where I will kill myself out of desperation.”

Yusuf, who lives in the community, said he did not have any family with him 
and that he was sleeping in the same room as a friend, who was monitoring him 
and helping him with basic tasks. The accommodation is 40 minutes’ walk away 
from shops and other amenities but Yusuf grows dizzy and is unable to walk long 
distances.

“My friend is the only one helping me, he cooks my food and I don’t have 
anyone else who can give me any help,” he said.

Australian lawyers representing the man, from the national justice project 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/how-could-this-happen-indigenous-health-tragedies-spark-search-for-answers>
, declined to comment.

Guardian Australia understands the Australian government has sought its own, 
separate medical advice about the man.

A spokesman for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said it 
did not provide specific details on the health and transfer arrangements of 
individuals.

“Decisions about medical transfers are made on a case by case basis according 
to clinical need, in consultation with the contracted health services provider 
and the government of Nauru,” he said.

In September, an Afghan man also on Nauru said he was not provided 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/nauru-refugee-denied-emergency-evacuation-after-suspected-heart-attack>
 with the urgent medical treatment required after suffering from heart 
problems. The man was asked to write a will and requested that, if he died, the 
Australian government care for his children and provide them with an education.

And in May, a 26-year-old Bangladeshi refugee died in Nauru hospital 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/11/bangladeshi-refugee-dies-on-nauru-of-suspected-heart-attack>
 from suspected heart failure after suffering a series of heart attacks. Plans 
were made to take him to Australia by air ambulance but he could not be moved.

The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre chief executive, Kon Karapanagiotidis, said 
that “We cannot allow Yusuf to become another appalling failure of our 
government’s duty of care”.

“He must be transferred to safety immediately,” he said. “Australian 
authorities have a duty of care to refugees and people seeking asylum 
regardless of whether they are in detention centres or living in the community 
offshore and they are once again failing in that responsibility.”
