As Sarah Versprille and Daniel Hindman turned their attention to the follow up 
to last year’s Moon Tides, the duo’s core ambition was to avoid the patterns of 
every indie dream-pop record out at the moment. They enlisted John Congleton (

, Swans, Angel Olsen, the Walkmen) as producer, who encouraged them to tinker 
with gear, skew arrangements and strip their compositions of complexity.

“John pushed us to not make cliches, to not play into the style of other 
bands,” says Hindman. “He tricked me with the guitars on the album. We got the 
basic tracks down and he asked me to do scratch guitar and then [use] analog 
gear, with virtually no plug-ins or effects added afterwards, no hiding behind 
multiple layers. There aren’t a lot of tricks; what you hear is naturally 
what’s there.”

The end result is an elegantly experimental listen: the driving melancholy of 
shoegaze, the intimate, haunting romance ofBeach House

, the atmosphere of a strange, half-awake state.
