The machines were vital to the Nazi war effort but the Allies broke the codes 
– a feat said to have shortened the war by several years.

The work done to crack the codes by Alan Turing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/alan-turing> and fellow codebreakers at 
Bletchley Park was immortalised in the Benedict Cumberbatch film The Imitation 
Game.

The machine being offered for sale, which dates from 1943 and currently 
belongs to a European museum, will go under the hammer at Sotheby’s in London 
on Tuesday.

Few examples remain as many of the machines were destroyed by German forces as 
they retreated.
