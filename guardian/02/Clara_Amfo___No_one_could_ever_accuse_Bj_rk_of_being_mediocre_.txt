Those frantic horns at the start just make people go mad, myself included. I 
don’t think I’ve ever heard Giggs so amped!

The track that’s been unfairly slept on this year

They are a producer-singer duo signed to Drake’s OVO label who make really 
slick and imaginative R&B. They kept a lot of Frank Ocean fans I know happy in 
his absence.

The track I’d play at sunset in Ibiza

I was so happy when he came back with new material, it’s one of the sexiest 
songs I’ve heard in years.

The track that should have been a crossover hit

It has potential for my mum to sing along to which makes a hit in my eyes.

I used to DJ in a well-known high-street shop on Saturday afternoons and one 
of the rules was that songs had to be clean. I may have played an unedited 
version of this…

Even though the title suggests otherwise, this is good for mornings!


The track I’d play at my auntie’s wedding

My parents are from Ghana and Ghanaian weddings are always lively. This sounds 
like a highlife and Afrobeat tune that would keep all the aunties happy.

She’s an artist coming with through with solo material after being in a group 
called Last Night In Paris. I really like this.

My big brother was really into her, so I inherited his appreciation. No one 
could ever accuse her of being mediocre.
