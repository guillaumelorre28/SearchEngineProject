Richard Hawley’s last album, Standing At The Sky’s Edge, was something of a 
departure for the Sheffield singer. Rockier, and with a psychedelic edge, it 
suggested that the former Longpig may have been saying farewell to his world of 
beautifully crooned, 50s ballads.

Not so. Follow-up Hollow Meadows is something of a return to familiar ground 
for Hawley, although it doesn’t feel like a rehash: instead there is a sense of 
refinement at work here. The opening of I Still Want You sees an added 
roughness to his velvet-lined voice, whereas Tuesday PM moves with the stately 
grace of a Nick Cave ballad.
