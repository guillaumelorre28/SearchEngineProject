Arizona-born Mingus was one of jazz's greatest composers, a double-bass 
virtuoso, a challenger of racism inside and outside the white-run music 
business of his time, and a volatile individual with an incendiary temper. But 
though he creatively adapted the techniques of such 20th-century composers as 
Schoenberg, Bartók and Stravinsky, Mingus infused everything he wrote with the 
blues and gospel music of his childhood.

The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady (1963) is one of his most enthralling 
works. The album (with liner notes shared between Mingus and his psychiatrist) 
modifies the traditional blues and folk materials of jazz by bold, rhythmic 
variations, stark contrasts between dense, low-end harmonies and Charlie 
Mariano's soaring alto sax, collective improvisation, and dissonances swept up 
into soulful resolutions.

Mingus worked with Joni Mitchell in his last years and, after his death in 
1979, a huge symphonic piece called Epitaph (a secret life's work since his 
teens) was found among his possessions.
