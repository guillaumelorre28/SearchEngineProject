Speaking at Skoll World Forum in April 2014, Nigerian banker and 
philanthropist Tony Elumelu saidthe next big challenge for Africa would be 
tackling the lack of electricity 
<https://twitter.com/ElizaTalks/status/454644427982913536>.

Africa is home to nearly 1 billion people, accounts for over a sixth of the 
world's population, butgenerates only 4% of global electricity 
<http://www.economist.com/node/9660077>. On a continent full of natural 
resource wealth, where economic growth outpaces most other regions of the 
world, the fact that is often referred to as 'the dark continent' - withaccess 
to electrity in sub-Saharn African only at 17% 
<http://issuu.com/energynet1/docs/yearbook_2013_final?e=3211560/3832950> - is 
worrisome. So what is being done about it?

As well as the myriad of projects supported by the African Development Bank 
<http://www.afdb.org/en/topics-and-sectors/sectors/energy-power/> or the World 
Bank 
<http://web.worldbank.org/external/default/main?menuPK=717353&pagePK=34004426&piPK=34004444&theSitePK=717306>
, the Obama administration has alsocommitted $7bn to an initiative 
<http://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica> intended to double access to energy in the 
next five years. However, observers have already said the amount is "a drop in 
the bucket of what's needed." According to the International Energy Agency, 
sub-Saharan Africa willrequire more than $300bn 
<http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/policy/construction-begins-on-7-billion-power-africa-project>
 to achieve universal electricity access by 2030.

With a challenge of this scale, what is the kind of innovation and investment 
necessary? Is there room for new forms of partnership and new forms of energy 
to accelerate progress? With African businesses experiencing on average56 days 
of power outages a year 
<http://issuu.com/energynet1/docs/yearbook_2013_final?e=3211560/3832950>, will 
growth be sustained if access to energy is not addressed? Join us on Thursday 8 
May from 1pm - 3pm BST to discuss these and other questions.
