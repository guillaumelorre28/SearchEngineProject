Steve Morrison has built All3Media into an independent television production 
powerhouse responsible for Skins, Shameless, Peep Show and The Only Way Is 
Essex, and returns to the MediaGuardian 100after a two-year absence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/14/mediatop100200839> as he seeks a 
new financial backer.

Established in 2003 by the former Granada Media chief executive and two other 
ITV colleagues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/oct/14/independentproductioncompanies.broadcasting?INTCMP=SRCH>
, All3Media has pursued a private equity fuelled "buy and build" strategy that 
has seen it become king of UK indies.

Permira, which bought 51% of the company in a 2006 deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jul/31/privateequity.broadcasting> 
which valued it at £320m, wants to cash in its chips and Morrison is seeking a 
new partner. He turns 65 next year, but plans to lead the next phase.

Morrison was born in Glasgow and spent 28 years at Granada, where he produced 
World in Action and oversaw Cracker and Prime Suspect. Heleft in 2002 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/aug/28/broadcasting.business?INTCMP=SRCH>
 after taking the rap for the failure of ITV Digital.

Now he looks set to beat Elisabeth Murdoch, who sold her Shine Group for £415m 
earlier this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/21/elisabeth-murdoch-news-corporation-shine-television>
. If valued in the same way, All3Media could fetch £750m. "It's likely to be 
the biggest UK indie sale ever," our panel said.
