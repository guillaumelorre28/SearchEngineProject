In 1958, novice photographer Art Kane rounded up 58 New York jazz musicians 
for an Esquire photo shoot in front of a Harlem brownstone. An instant icon, 
the shot was immortalised in Jean Bach's 1994 documentary A Great Day in 
Harlem. Big names, including Mingus, Gillespie, Basie, Coleman Hawkins, Marian 
McPartland and Gerry Mulligan, make the picture a resonant memento of jazz's 
classical heyday â€“ though Willie "the Lion" Smith got bored and wandered off.
