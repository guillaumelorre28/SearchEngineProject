<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/07/pound-dollar-brexit-politicians-city-stock-markets-retail-live>
 since Britain voted to leave the EU on 23 June andconsumer confidence has 
taken a battering, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/brexit-vote-batters-consumer-confidence-slide-gfk-yougov-regions>
but it hasn’t been all bad news for UK firms. Here are some of the winners and 
losers so far from Brexit.

 Primark in London 
Primark’s owner, Associated British Foods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/associatedbritishfoods>, said the 
clothing chain’s UK profit margins would be hit by sterling’s fall but this 
would be offset by fatter margins at its sugar business. Profits earned outside 
the UK will be better than expected because of the weak pound, it added. The 
groupscrapped its earlier prediction that annual earnings would fall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/07/primark-owner-buoyed-by-stronger-euro>
.

Rentokil International has been one of the big gainers 
<http://www.investegate.co.uk/rentokil-initial-plc--rto-/rns/acquisition--cdc-contract-win-and-trading-update/201607070700084823D/>
 from the plunging pound. The pest control company makes 90% of its revenue 
outside the UK and if currency rates stay the same it will make up to £15m 
extra this year, it said.


Pinewood Studios, home to the James Bond and Star Wars films, said that its 
international customers would benefit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/pinewood-studios-set-to-profit-from-brexit-vote>
 from the fall in the pound, which will make Pinewood’s services cheaper to 
overseas producers.

 Bookmakers fared well in the referendum 
Bookmakers had their biggest non-sporting event ever at the referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-is-bookies-biggest-ever-non-sporting-event>
, with punters placing £100m in bets. Most of that money went on Britain 
staying in the EU, suggesting the bookies did pretty well, at least in the 
short term.


Accountants and law firms will be busy as companies caught off guard by the 
referendum result seek to rearrange their businesses.KPMG, one of the big four 
accountants,has appointed a head of Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/brexit-uncertainty-put-floats-takeovers-hold-kpmg>
 while rivals have set up specialist teams.

Aveva, the software maker, said the pound’s weakness against the euro and the 
dollar would increase the value of its overseas earnings if rates remain stable 
at current levels.

 Ocado 
Ocado is a potential beneficiary of the pound’s fall. The online grocer has 
been trying to do a deal with an overseas retailer to use its technology for 
more than a year. Thecompany said the weaker pound 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/28/ocado-warns-brexit-supermarket-prices-sales-rise>
 could make such a deal more attractive to buyers.

Losers

Sports Direct has warned of a tough year ahead, made worse because of Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/07/sports-direct-not-going-private-in-near-future-says-mike-ashley>
. Weakening consumer confidence is likely to hit sales and failure to insure 
against the pound’s fall will make products bought in dollars more expensive 
and incur losses on hedging contracts taken out on sterling against the euro.

Foxtons shares plunged to a record low when the estate agent said the 
referendum result would depress property sales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/27/foxtons-and-easyjet-issue-profits-warnings-eu-referendum>
 for the rest of the year in London, its main market. It had been hoping for a 
pick-up in activity after the referendum.

 Shares are down 20% 
Shares in Carpetright lost a fifth of their value when the flooring retailer 
saidthe referendum result had probably worsened tough trading conditions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/28/carpetright-shares-shed-fifth-of-value-result-eu-referendum>
 by increasing consumer uncertainty. The weak pound will also push up prices it 
pays for materials, analysts said.

Banks have been affected by worries about the post-Brexit economy and a 
probable cut in interest rates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/rbs-slumps-quarter-brexit-uk-bank-shares-severe-strain>
.Royal Bank of Scotland said the government will have to wait two years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/04/brexit-vote-setback-rbs-sell-off>
 or more to sell a further stake after its shares plunged. With the Bank of 
England expected to reduce rates from record lows, it will become still harder 
for banks to make money on lending.

 British Airways profits will be down, IAF forecasts Photograph: Steve 
Parsons/PA 
British Airways’ owner, International Airlines Group, said annual profit would 
be lower than expected 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/24/international-airlines-group-warns-on-profits-british-airways-eu-referendum>
 because of weak trading caused by the referendum. EasyJet warned three days 
later that the vote to leave had added to existing problems such as cancelled 
flights and that short-term profit would be affected.


C&C, the beverage maker, warned that the pound’s weakness could wipe out gains 
from improved trading and cost reductions so far this year. The Irish company, 
whose shares are traded in London, makes almost half its profits in sterling 
but reports in euros, leaving it exposed to the pound’s sharp fall.
