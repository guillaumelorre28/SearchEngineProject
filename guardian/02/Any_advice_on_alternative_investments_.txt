This week's question

Isa rates are so poor these days I'm thinking about trying my hand at 
alternative investments, but I'm not sure what to go for. I've been wondering 
about wine, coins or stamps, but I don't know where to start. I've got about 
£1,000 to play with initially. Any helpful hints?

What are your thoughts?
