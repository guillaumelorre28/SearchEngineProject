Since it's Caturday, you all know what that means: let's watch a video!

In this interesting video, we visit Anna Goldman 
<http://fieldmuseum.org/users/anna-goldman>, a mammals preparator at Chicago's 
Field Museum <http://fieldmuseum.org/>, and we watch as she dissects and 
prepares part of a dead zebra,Equus grevyi, for the museum's permanent 
collection.

As you will see in this video, we are clearly watching two professionals at 
work (WARNING: some scenes in this video may cause some people to cringe):
