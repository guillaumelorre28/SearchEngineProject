There is one place fashion fans are guaranteed to flock to in London this year 
– and it isn’t Barry’s Bootcamp. The real hot ticket is the Victoria and Albert 
museum’sAlexander McQueen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexander-mcqueen> retrospective, Savage 
Beauty. From provocative early catwalk shows The Hunger and Highland Rape to 
the late designer’s last fully realised collection, Plato’s Atlantis, the 
exhibition will feature almost two decades of his work. Plato’s Atlantis, 
curator Claire Wilcox says, “was incredibly complex”. It also featured the
Armadillo boots

that revolutionised footwear. “Very few designers have managed to startle us 
into an entirely new silhouette,” she curator Claire Wilcox says. “You think of
Dior <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/christian-dior>, you think of 
Balenciaga <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga>, you think of 
McQueen.”

The show was first staged at New York’s Metropolitan Museum in 2011: and will 
stick quite closely to its template. “I saw Savage Beauty at the Met and I was 
absolutely moved,” Wilcox says. “It was the best exhibition on fashion I had 
ever seen.” One tweak will be a London-focused “prelude” emphasising McQueen’s 
early work and links with the capital. “He grew up in the East End, was 
inspired by 19th-century London and was a great London museum-goer – I showed 
him pieces from our archive many times,” she says. “There seems to be a bit of 
a sense that McQueen has come home.”
