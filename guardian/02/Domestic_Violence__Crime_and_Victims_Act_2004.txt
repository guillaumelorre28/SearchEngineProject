Aim

"To make provision 
<http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2004/ukpga_20040028_en_1#Legislation-Preamble> 
about homicide; to make common assault an arrestable offence; to make provision 
for the payment of surcharges by offenders; to make provision about alternative 
verdicts; to provide for a procedure under which a jury tries only sample 
counts on an indictment; to make provision about findings of unfitness to plead 
and about persons found unfit to plead or not guilty by reason of insanity."

Main provisions

• Amends non-molestation orders 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/relationships/domestic_violence/practicalhh_index14.shtml>
 to include a criminal sanction for non-compliance which can carry a prison 
sentence of up to five years.
• Allows same-sex couples and cohabiting couples to apply for non-molestation 
orders.
• Allows courts to impose restraining orders on acquitted defendants.
• Allows judges, rather than a specially empanelled jury, to decide if a 
defendant is fit to plead.
• Expands the circumstances in which trials can be heard without a jury.
• Creates an offence of "causing or allowing the death of a child or 
vulnerable adult".
• Enables a jury to make inferences about any part of the case (including the 
guilt of the defendant), based upon the defendant's failure to give evidence if 
they are charged with the above offence and either or both murder and 
manslaughter.

Background

The new offence of "causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable 
adult" was designed to deal with scenarios in which a child or vulnerable adult 
dies as a result of neglect or abuse and it is not clear which member of their 
household was responsible for the death. The act also amends court procedures 
to require joint defendants to give their account of events in the witness box.

Criticism

Critics charged that this act prejudices a defendant's right 
<http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/supportingcharities/ogs/g071c001.asp> to 
a fair trial because the act allows an adverse inference to be taken by a 
defendant's silence. "This could put a defendant at risk of, say, a conviction 
for murder in circumstances where there is no case to answer in relation to 
that charge," say Simester and Sullivan in Criminal Law .

Liberty expressed similar concerns 
<http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/pdfs/policy03/dec-03-domestic-violence-2nd-reading.PDF>
 that this could lead someone who is innocent of any offence but who is 
frightened of testifying on their own behalf to be convicted.
