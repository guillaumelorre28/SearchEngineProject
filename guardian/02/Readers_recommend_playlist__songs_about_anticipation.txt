Recommend series at the end of the piece.

Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there’ll be some love
Arctic Monkeys


Yes, indeed there will – and the wait for love seems a sub-theme running 
through this week – but not without some anxiety and trepidation first.

. 
So then, we begin the playlist with Arctic Monkeys’ View From the Afternoon 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQAZsyucbQ&index=1&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
, watching the “lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine” as it makes 
its way through scenes of urban desolation. Could one of those girls be Magda 
Giannikou? No, for she’s providing the vocals for New York collectiveSnarky 
Puppy as she sings of her search for love in the enchanting Amour, T’es La 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPHB6hm2wV8&index=2&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
. She’s sure it’s around, and is,as nominator untergunther says 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/23/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-anticipation#comment-77353343>
, “waiting for a favourable answer … to the question: ‘Love, are you there?’” 
but it seems so elusive.


Meanwhile, Buddy Holly, in Everyday 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty31QY5ZGHo&index=3&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
, has his sights set on someone in particular …

Everyday, it’s a-gettin’ closer
Goin’ faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
Buddy Holly


PJ Harvey will be glad to hear that. Picturing herself as Snow White gently 
steaming up her glass coffin, she tells us that she canHardly Wait 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_glGLQGpi0&index=4&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
. Meanwhile,Madness are paying a visit to the chemist. They’re 16 now (so they 
tell us) so it’s welcome to theHouse of Fun 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ2X9SANsME&index=5&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
.


Jethro Tull are on their way Up the ‘Pool 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtLtrt6SQZI&index=6&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
. That’s Blackpool of course, with all the delights it has to offer. They may 
well find Canadian rockersTriumph there, singing I Live for the Weekend 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPt_xmKmgNs&index=7&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
, though it’s a long way to travel just to whoop it up. But who’s thatLeaning 
on a Lamp-post 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ08Iep06eE&index=8&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
? Yes, it’sGeorge Formby, waiting to see if “a certain little lady passes by … 
Oh me, oh my!”

But when a couple who fancy each other eventually do get together, nervousness 
and awkwardness may threaten to take over, as is so beautifully expressed in
Hazel O’Connor’s Will You? 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjxVTwTekw8&index=9&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>

And I’m feeling all fingers and thumbs
Spill my tea, oh, silly me
Hazel O’Connor

Will the relationship continue? That’s also what worries Johnny Mathis. On his 
way to see his beloved, and99 Miles From LA 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAZTtH1YNOU&index=10&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
, he’s reminded of her by everything that he sees. The same uncertainty besets
Ryan Adams, in his achingly tender song named after the Starlite Diner 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEJl3szz9dg&index=11&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
, where he awaits his love: “Is it possible to love someone too much?” he asks 
… “You bet.”


But all is well. Saint Etienne’s joyous Nothing Can Stop Us 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSuxnF8dOPU&index=12&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
 looks forward to a happy future. So how better to end this playlist than with 
a song written by George Harrison,The Beatles’ sublime classic, Here Comes the 
Sun 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYVBmEU-atw&index=13&list=PL7kF5w3-HpW9Fx260HG-1Gwfr5U9XAbgi>
?
