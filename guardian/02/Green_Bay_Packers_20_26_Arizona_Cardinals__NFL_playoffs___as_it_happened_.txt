Postgame

I may have a stroke. 

Itâ€™s one of those games that makes you remember why you stay home to watch 
sweaty men play with a ball on a Saturday night.

In sports, itâ€™s a rare moment when a team throws away an opportunity to win a 
huge game, and somehow still finds a way to win. That happened tonight.

The Cardinals survive horrendous clock management and a Hail Mary miracle, 
thanks to another insane play by Palmer, spinning out of pressure, bouncing off 
his own man, before finding Fitzgerald, who made the run of his career down to 
the five-yard line.

So Palmer has his playoff win and the Cardinals are in business. Theyâ€™ll head 
to Carolina or host Seattle depending on what happens Sunday.

The Packers? Well, I mean, what can you do right? Youâ€™re part of history, and 
for them, that has to be enough.

Me? I need a drink. Thanks for reading. More live NFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> blogs tomorrow, but until then, good 
morning, good afternoon and goodnight.

Packers 20-20 Cardinals, 14:00 overtime

The Cards call timeout because they canâ€™t believe what happened either. 

Then Palmer looks for Fitzgerald again in the corner of the endzone but itâ€™s 
incomplete.

Packers 20-20 Cardinals, 14:04 overtime

OK, here we go. We are still playing, amazingly. 

Palmer, in traffic spins off one of his own players and fires complete for 
Fitzgerald! Heâ€™s running across the field, through everybody! Heâ€™s possessed! 
Heâ€™s still going, left, right, across!

HE IS TAKEN DOWN FINALLY ON THE FIVE!

Clock management 101

A Cardinal fail. That game was over 45 seconds before that happened. But 
Arizona threw the ball incomplete, for reasons that may never be clear.

Horrible. 

More crazy s*&t, the coin toss: the referee threw it up and it didnâ€™t flip, 
because that happens all the time also.

They re-flipped it. Is that a word? Cards won, theyâ€™ll take the kick, although 
nothing is a given in this game.

Janis, yes it was Janis. That looks good to me. I think that is six, and if 
so, that would mean Crosby on for a pressure-packed extra point, or perhaps...

No. They wouldnâ€™t right?

Packers 13-20 Cardinals, :05 4th quarter

Arizona call time as their defensive set up was all over the place. Sloppy. 
But in this game, that makes sense.

Will Richard Rodgers catch lightning in a bottle, again?

Here we go - shotgun, Rodgers, facing pressure, backpedaling, and fires out of 
bounds.

Packers 13-20 Cardinals, :12 4th quarter

Itâ€™s llegal motion on the offense, the TE Rodgers, on a mess of a play where 
Green Bay looked like they were going to spike it, then they didnâ€™t.

Pack on the Arizona 40 - a long way to go. 

Timeout Arizona. 

Hail Mary, full of grace...

Packers 13-20 Cardinals, :55 4th quarter

Rodgers, off his back foot, throws out of bounds. Second & 10. 

Now heâ€™s sacked! Itâ€™s Dwight Freeny! Or itâ€™s Rodgers running into David 
Bakhtiari!

Rodgers on 3rd & 20, he guns it way down field in search of Janis, and that 
looks like it could have been interference, but there are no flags.

Fourth down. Timeout Cardinals.

Packers 13-20 Cardinals, 1:50 4th quarter

Janis is hit hard, shy of the 15. Good special teams play for Arizona to start 
off this final phase.

And away we go...

FIELD GOAL! Packers 13-20 Cardinals, 1:55 4th quarter

Itâ€™s good. 

Rodgers and the Packers need a touchdown or their season is over. They have 
just one timeout.

You ready?

Packers 13-17 Cardinals, 2:00 4th quarter

All the Cardinals have to do is what Cincinnati didnâ€™t do, and thatâ€™s hold on 
to the football, run that clock down, and kick a field goal possibly.

Johnson runs for two yards. 

Now Palmer throws the ball! Why is he throwing the ball? 

Itâ€™s incomplete!

What are these people doing? This is not a video game! I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A 
VIDEO GAME!

3rd & 8 - Johnson runs and is short of the first down. 

They run the clock to the two-minute warning, but that move saved Aaron 
Rodgers, say, 40 seconds or so.

Itâ€™s McCarthy v Arians in the Brain Bowl. 

Hereâ€™s the warning. When we return, Arizona will attempt a 36-yard field goal.

Packers 13-17 Cardinals, 2:38 4th quarter

Remember, Green Bay have just one timeout because people are stupid. 

Little pass to Kuhn for four yards. Little run by Lacy for a yard. 

3rd & 5, and the Arizona crowd are going a bit bananas. 

Rodgers is looking for Abbrederis - incomplete! He wants a flag and gets zilch.

Theyâ€™re going for it!! 

Rodgers back to pass and skips it off the turf into the hands of Jones, and 
thatâ€™s a turnover on downs!

McCarthy knew he had to gamlble, partially because he has just one timeout. 

Now the Cards are in field goal territory. Genius stuff.

TOUCHDOWN! Packers 13-17 Cardinals, 3:44 4th quarter

Palmer throws towards the endzone - Damarious Randall gets a hand on it - the 
ball is in the air, behind the intended receiver, itâ€™s misdirected into the 
hands of Floyd, and thatâ€™s a touchdown!

Palmer was looking for Fitzgerald, and somehow found Floyd, via Randall! And 
that really happened!

That is one lucky quarterback.

Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 4:00 4th quarter

Palmer nearly connects with Fitzgerald in the endzone but itâ€™s incomplete. 

Now he hits Johnson underneath, in major rush hour traffic, and the RB rolls 
towards a first down on 3rd & 10!

They measure and itâ€™s a first down by a nose!

Cards on the 19!

Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 4:32 4th quarter

Another third down conversion - John Brown needs four, gets nine.

Now Palmer is looking for Floyd and itâ€™s another floater SAM SHIELDS NEARLY 
PICKS IT OFF - he dropped an easy pick!

This is crazy - whatâ€™s up with these throws?

Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 5:41 4th quarter

Under six minutes remaining, and a big 3rd & 4 here. Palmer in the shotgun, 
pump fakes once, twice, almost into a helmet, before finding Michael Floyd, who 
came across the field towards the near sideline to make a first down catch to 
the 34.

Now theyâ€™re on the 26 after Johnson finally gets his wheels turning for a gain 
of on the ground of eight.

Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 8:30 4th quarter

Palmer looking for Ellington, who doesnâ€™t bother turn around when he is 
supposed to turn around, incomplete.

But then AZâ€™s QB fires to Brown for a gain of 21. 


Ellington again, on the ground this time, and heâ€™s wrapped up for a loss! This 
Ellington, maybe he doesnâ€™t come out again?

On 2nd & 13, Palmer hits Fitzgerald who is four yards short, but he 
stutter-steps, jukes, beats tacklers and somehow squeezes out a first down. 
Tremendous play by Fitzgerald who has really come alive here in the second half.

Ball on the GB 49 now...

PLAY UNDER REVIEW! Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 11:01 4th quarter

OK, itâ€™s incomplete, and then they added a few seconds to the clock. That 
means Green Bay have to punt, and they do, down to the 20, where Arizona will 
begin.

How the refs missed that one is unreal.

PLAY UNDER REVIEW! Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 10:54 4th quarter

Green Bay pick up a first down, and then on 2nd & 10, Rodgers looks way way 
downfield for Jones, incomplete.


Big 3rd & 10 here from the GB 42 - Rodgers fires over the middle complete to 
Rodgers. But was he down on contact? Rodgers didnâ€™t think so and he ran way 
down the field.

Now, Arizona are challenging whether Rodgers was down by contact, but the 
replay shows Rodgers never actually made the catch at all and itâ€™s incomplete.

So, if they are challenging down by contact, and the ball is incomplete, and 
they challenge the wrong call, what happens? Probably that it is incomplete.

Please stand by.

INTERCEPTION! Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 14:10 4th quarter

Palmer throws the kind of pass that makes you wonder if your grandmother could 
have done better, and it lands in the hands of the Packers Randall.

Thatâ€™s just the kind of mistake he made during the 2009 loss v the Jets, when 
he guided the Bengals to defeat in an early round match-up. I mean, who loses 
to the Jets in the playoffs?

I guess Arizona need a stop...(how is that for analysis)?

Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 14:20, 4th quarter

Suddenly thereâ€™s lots of space in the Packers secondary - John Brown has 
plenty of room in making the 18 yard catch on the far side. Cards down to the 
10.

Packers 13-10 Cardinals, end of 3rd quarter

Two tiny runs and a defensive holding call help Arizona to another first down. 

Now David Johnson is out of the backfield and has himself a first down catch - 
itâ€™s a 10-yard gain that parks Arizona on the Green Bay 28-yards line as the 
third quarter comes to a close.

Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 2:21 3rd quarter

The rhythm is a dancer, and that dancer is Larry Fitzgerald, who runs a filthy 
route during his 22-yard reception.

Now Mike McCarthy is challenging whether or not itâ€™s a catch because he 
alleges the ball came loose when he hit the ground.

Damn it, this is a catch. This is dumb football replay horse patootie, and now 
McCarthy pays the price. Why did he challenge that? Now they have just a single 
time out left.

SO STUPID!!!!! I HATE STUPID FOOTBALL!

Cards on the GB 47, first down.

Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 2:50 3rd quarter

The Pack start from the 35 thanks to a healthy return by Janis from the 
endzone - and how about that Janis?

After a penalty a pair of short runs and an incompletion, itâ€™s 3rd & 13. 

Rodgers in the shotgun, he finds Rodgers for a short gain, and Arizona force 
GB to punt: important play right there.


JustNow the punt is just 34-yards. Thatâ€™s short, and it puts Arizona on their 
31 instead of being buried deep in their own territory.

This stuff matters!

Packers 13-7 Cardinals, 5:09 3rd quarter

Palmer has Johnson open on the near side, about a yard outside the endzone, 
but he misfires incomplete. Thatâ€™s a terrible job by Palmer there - he has to 
hit the open Johsnon, and so the Cards have to settle for the field goal unit.

Packers 13-7 Cardinals, 5:41 3rd quarter

Fells gets done for hammering Burnett while running towards his own endzone 
(you follow) - thatâ€™s not allowed and costs the Cards 15 yards and momentum.

So now itâ€™s 2nd & goal from the 15. 

Then the Packers are called for having 12 men on the field, which is not 
allowed, so itâ€™s 2nd & goal from the 10.

Some dumb yard trading going on right now.

Packers 13-7 Cardinals, 6:45 3rd quarter

Cards have a little something something going on, an offensive rhythm thatâ€™s 
been missing for some time.

Fells, a catch over the middle for 11 yards, and you can tack on 15 more 
thanks to a silly unnecessary roughness call on Raji, who was aggressive with 
Fells after the catch.

Two plays later and Palmer has found Fitzgerald for a third time on this 
drive, this time in the middle of the field for a 19-yard gain.


Cards have 1st & goal from the seven.

Packers 13-7 Cardinals, 8:38 3rd quarter

Fitzgerald on the far side, a little quick out that quickly goes for four 
yards.

Now heâ€™s looking for Fitzgerald again, this time down the far sideline - a 
perfectly thrown ball that lands in the safe hands of the Cards wideout. Thatâ€™s 
32 yards.

Then a buzzkill, a delay-of-game call. Now the Cards are on their own 47.

TOUCHDOWN! Packers 13-7 Cardinals, 10:17 3rd quarter

Rodgers on the run again - he fires while moving forward - he has Janis! Jeff 
Janis! Heâ€™s in the middle of the endzone with the football - itâ€™s a touchdown 
catch that puts the Pack on top!


Thatâ€™s 81 yards on just six plays for seven points, in stark contrast to the 
pair of 17-play first-half drives that earned just six points.

Cards in trouble - they need to figure out a way to penetrate GBâ€™s re-tooled 
secondary...pronto.

Packers 6-7 Cardinals, 10:25 3rd quarter

On second down, Rodgers is buying all kinds of time, running here, there, 
everywhere, but itâ€™s not enough to find a receiver. He throws it away, setting 
up 3rd & goal from the eight.

Now Rodgers has to burn a timeout.

Packers 6-7 Cardinals, 11:04 3rd quarter

Hereâ€™s more good news for Packer fans - Lacy has back-to- back big runs.

The first is for 14 yards. 

The second is for 62! Glendale is arm-tackle town USA as Lacy motors down to 
the Cardinal eight - first and goal to go for Green Bay!

REVIEW! INTERCEPTION! Packers 6-7 Cardinals, 13:22 3rd quarter

Of course they looked at it, because they look at every turnover: the ruling 
on the play stands. There was some question as to whther or not the ball hit 
the ground when Dix hit the turf. It did, but the ball did not move, and that 
means itâ€™s a catch...

Stupid NFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> time wasting.

INTERCEPTION! Packers 6-7 Cardinals, 13:22 3rd quarter

Palmer lofts a pass down the far sideline looking for Floyd but itâ€™s Ha Ha 
Clinton-Dix who makes a remarkable interception in traffic!

So we begin the half with back-to-back picks - who had this one as low scoring?

Packers 6-7 Cardinals, 13:34 3rd quarter

Packers blitz on second down and Palmer overthrows John Brown down the far 
sideline.

Palmer is exceptional at picking up the blitz, but didnâ€™t look it there.

Packers 6-7 Cardinals, 14:33 3rd quarter

Lacy, desperate to get something going, runs into the line for no gain. 

Then Rodgers hits Rodgers (roger roger) on a post play for a first down - 
thatâ€™s a 15-yard gain to the GB 35.

We're back!

Packers have it to start the half - Janis chooses to take the touchback, and 
Green Bay will start at their 20.

Halftime

So if not for two flags on two very big plays, who knows how this game would 
look right now. One thing we can say confidently, there would be more points on 
the board.

Palmer and the Cards came out strong, but Green Bay managed to find their 
defensive footing, and more importantly, played the possession game to a tee. 
The Packers recovered from a pair of three-and-outs in the first quarter to put 
together a pair of drives that soaked up much of the ensuing play. That kept 
Palmer, who looks a bit jumpy in the pocket, on the sideline, which is the best 
place for him to bee if youâ€™re a cheesehead.

Here are some numbers...

Palmer was 8/14 for just 74 yards, Rodgers 16/26 for 121 yards. He wasnâ€™t 
sacked, which was kind of amazing since he was eight times by Arizona just 
three weeks ago.

Rodgers was also the Packers leading rusher - true story - with 21 yards, 
mostly because big Eddie Lacy hasnâ€™t gotten it going yet.

David Johnsonâ€™s wheels are hardly turning for the Cards: he has just 16 yards 
on six carries.

John Brown has 34 yards receiving for AZ, Abbrederis and Janis have combined 
for 91 yards as they try to make up for the loss of Randall Cobb.

Second half action coming soon. Please stand by.

Packers 6-7 Cardinals, end of half

What can the Cards do with 57 seconds?


Palmer hits Floyd, who has it, then doesnâ€™t have it, has it again, and doesnâ€™t 
have it, bobbles it some more and itâ€™s incomplete.

Then Palmer is sent to the turf! Thatsâ€™ defensive tackle Mike Daniels with the 
sack for GBâ€™s defense which has, rather stunningly, allowed just 75 yards so 
far to this high-octane Cards offense.

I say stunningly, because it looked like Palmer and the Cards were going to 
run over the Packers early on...but no.

Now itâ€™s 3rd & 19 and Johnson runs the ball so the clock runs out. Half over.

FIELD GOAL! Packers 6-7 Cardinals, 1:01 2nd quarter

Here we go. Rodgers is blitzed and has to chuck it away again! So here comes 
the field goal unit after the Green Bay drive stalls again.


Crosby has another easy one - 34 yards this time, and itâ€™s good. 

Thatâ€™s 17 plays, 71 yards and 7:55 for three points. 

That means six points from 34 plays in 15:26...if keeping Palmer off the field 
was their goal, well, so far so good.

Packers 3-7 Cardinals, 1:07 2nd quarter

Rodgers throws a screen to Starks on the far side but he goes nowhere. 

Now Rodgers pump fakes and then wanders to his right before throwing it away 
out of the endzone. He doesnâ€™t have a lot of options back there without Cobb.

Big 3rd & 14...and Rodgers wants to talk it over with head coach Mike 
McCarthy. Thatâ€™s their second time out.

Packers 3-7 Cardinals, 2:00 2nd quarter

Rodgers hits Janis, who is streaking across the middle and has first-down 
yardage.


Then the 13th play of this GB drive is a Eddie Lacy run for a one-yard loss. 

Now Rodgers hits Janis, AGAIN! Another first down, this time the play is to 
the far sideline.

Weâ€™ve hit the two-minute warning where the Packers are threatening on the 
Cards 12...

I may have a stroke. 

Itâ€™s one of those games that makes you remember why you stay home to watch 
sweaty men play with a ball on a Saturday night.

In sports, itâ€™s a rare moment when a team throws away an opportunity to win a 
huge game, and somehow still finds a way to win. That happened tonight.

The Cardinals survive horrendous clock management and a Hail Mary miracle, 
thanks to another insane play by Palmer, spinning out of pressure, bouncing off 
his own man, before finding Fitzgerald, who made the run of his career down to 
the five-yard line.

So Palmer has his playoff win and the Cardinals are in business. Theyâ€™ll head 
to Carolina or host Seattle depending on what happens Sunday.

The Packers? Well, I mean, what can you do right? Youâ€™re part of history, and 
for them, that has to be enough.

Me? I need a drink. Thanks for reading. More live NFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> blogs tomorrow, but until then, good 
morning, good afternoon and goodnight.
 
Palmer, a little flick to Fitzgerald, and heâ€™s in the endzone! Itâ€™s over! The 
Cardinals survive this crazy game!

Aaron Rodgers did it again: Packers down to 1 last play... Rodgers finds Jeff

Packers 20-20 Cardinals, 14:00 overtime

The Cards call timeout because they canâ€™t believe what happened either. 

Then Palmer looks for Fitzgerald again in the corner of the endzone but itâ€™s 
incomplete.
 
Packers 20-20 Cardinals, 14:04 overtime

OK, here we go. We are still playing, amazingly. 

Palmer, in traffic spins off one of his own players and fires complete for 
Fitzgerald! Heâ€™s running across the field, through everybody! Heâ€™s possessed! 
Heâ€™s still going, left, right, across!

HE IS TAKEN DOWN FINALLY ON THE FIVE! 
 
Clock management 101

A Cardinal fail. That game was over 45 seconds before that happened. But 
Arizona threw the ball incomplete, for reasons that may never be clear.

Horrible. 

More crazy s*&t, the coin toss: the referee threw it up and it didnâ€™t flip, 
because that happens all the time also.

They re-flipped it. Is that a word? Cards won, theyâ€™ll take the kick, although 
nothing is a given in this game.
 
It counts, and the kick is good. 

Oh man, we are tied. itâ€™s a tie game. 

My eyes are bleeding. 
 
Janis, yes it was Janis. That looks good to me. I think that is six, and if 
so, that would mean Crosby on for a pressure-packed extra point, or perhaps...

No. They wouldnâ€™t right?

 
Pressure, throws it up - endzone - Janis is there - HE HAS IT! THATâ€™S A 
TOUCHDOWN!!!!!!!


I THINK ITâ€™S A TOUCHDOWN! 


DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?

Letâ€™s go to the video tape...
 
Packers 13-20 Cardinals, :05 4th quarter

Arizona call time as their defensive set up was all over the place. Sloppy. 
But in this game, that makes sense.

Will Richard Rodgers catch lightning in a bottle, again?
 
Packers 13-20 Cardinals, :05 4th quarter

Here we go - shotgun, Rodgers, facing pressure, backpedaling, and fires out of 
bounds.

This is it!
 
Packers 13-20 Cardinals, :12 4th quarter

Itâ€™s llegal motion on the offense, the TE Rodgers, on a mess of a play where 
Green Bay looked like they were going to spike it, then they didnâ€™t.

Pack on the Arizona 40 - a long way to go. 

Timeout Arizona. 

Hail Mary, full of grace...

Itâ€™s 4th & 20 and season. Rodgers is running to his left - he fires way 
downfield and HAS JANIS!!! Thatâ€™s a 61-yard gain.
 
Packers 13-20 Cardinals, :55 4th quarter

Rodgers, off his back foot, throws out of bounds. Second & 10. 

Now heâ€™s sacked! Itâ€™s Dwight Freeny! Or itâ€™s Rodgers running into David 
Bakhtiari!

Rodgers on 3rd & 20, he guns it way down field in search of Janis, and that 
looks like it could have been interference, but there are no flags.

Fourth down. Timeout Cardinals. 
 
Packers 13-20 Cardinals, 1:50 4th quarter

Janis is hit hard, shy of the 15. Good special teams play for Arizona to start 
off this final phase.

And away we go...
 
Itâ€™s good. 

Rodgers and the Packers need a touchdown or their season is over. They have 
just one timeout.

You ready?
 
Packers 13-17 Cardinals, 2:00 4th quarter

All the Cardinals have to do is what Cincinnati didnâ€™t do, and thatâ€™s hold on 
to the football, run that clock down, and kick a field goal possibly.

Johnson runs for two yards. 

Now Palmer throws the ball! Why is he throwing the ball? 

Itâ€™s incomplete!

What are these people doing? This is not a video game! I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A 
VIDEO GAME!

3rd & 8 - Johnson runs and is short of the first down. 

They run the clock to the two-minute warning, but that move saved Aaron 
Rodgers, say, 40 seconds or so.

Itâ€™s McCarthy v Arians in the Brain Bowl. 

Hereâ€™s the warning. When we return, Arizona will attempt a 36-yard field goal. 
 
Packers 13-17 Cardinals, 2:38 4th quarter

Remember, Green Bay have just one timeout because people are stupid. 

Little pass to Kuhn for four yards. Little run by Lacy for a yard. 

3rd & 5, and the Arizona crowd are going a bit bananas. 

Rodgers is looking for Abbrederis - incomplete! He wants a flag and gets zilch.

Theyâ€™re going for it!! 

Rodgers back to pass and skips it off the turf into the hands of Jones, and 
thatâ€™s a turnover on downs!

McCarthy knew he had to gamlble, partially because he has just one timeout. 

Now the Cards are in field goal territory. Genius stuff.

Exactly. Now what?
 
Palmer throws towards the endzone - Damarious Randall gets a hand on it - the 
ball is in the air, behind the intended receiver, itâ€™s misdirected into the 
hands of Floyd, and thatâ€™s a touchdown!

Palmer was looking for Fitzgerald, and somehow found Floyd, via Randall! And 
that really happened!

That is one lucky quarterback. 
 
Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 4:00 4th quarter

Palmer nearly connects with Fitzgerald in the endzone but itâ€™s incomplete. 

Now he hits Johnson underneath, in major rush hour traffic, and the RB rolls 
towards a first down on 3rd & 10!

They measure and itâ€™s a first down by a nose!

Cards on the 19!
 
Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 4:32 4th quarter

Another third down conversion - John Brown needs four, gets nine.

Now Palmer is looking for Floyd and itâ€™s another floater SAM SHIELDS NEARLY 
PICKS IT OFF - he dropped an easy pick!

This is crazy - whatâ€™s up with these throws?
 
Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 5:41 4th quarter

Under six minutes remaining, and a big 3rd & 4 here. Palmer in the shotgun, 
pump fakes once, twice, almost into a helmet, before finding Michael Floyd, who 
came across the field towards the near sideline to make a first down catch to 
the 34.

Now theyâ€™re on the 26 after Johnson finally gets his wheels turning for a gain 
of on the ground of eight.
 
Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 8:30 4th quarter

Palmer looking for Ellington, who doesnâ€™t bother turn around when he is 
supposed to turn around, incomplete.

But then AZâ€™s QB fires to Brown for a gain of 21. 


Ellington again, on the ground this time, and heâ€™s wrapped up for a loss! This 
Ellington, maybe he doesnâ€™t come out again?

On 2nd & 13, Palmer hits Fitzgerald who is four yards short, but he 
stutter-steps, jukes, beats tacklers and somehow squeezes out a first down. 
Tremendous play by Fitzgerald who has really come alive here in the second half.

Ball on the GB 49 now...



 
OK, itâ€™s incomplete, and then they added a few seconds to the clock. That 
means Green Bay have to punt, and they do, down to the 20, where Arizona will 
begin.

How the refs missed that one is unreal. 
 
Green Bay pick up a first down, and then on 2nd & 10, Rodgers looks way way 
downfield for Jones, incomplete.


Big 3rd & 10 here from the GB 42 - Rodgers fires over the middle complete to 
Rodgers. But was he down on contact? Rodgers didnâ€™t think so and he ran way 
down the field.

Now, Arizona are challenging whether Rodgers was down by contact, but the 
replay shows Rodgers never actually made the catch at all and itâ€™s incomplete.

So, if they are challenging down by contact, and the ball is incomplete, and 
they challenge the wrong call, what happens? Probably that it is incomplete.

Please stand by. 
 
Palmer throws the kind of pass that makes you wonder if your grandmother could 
have done better, and it lands in the hands of the Packers Randall.

Thatâ€™s just the kind of mistake he made during the 2009 loss v the Jets, when 
he guided the Bengals to defeat in an early round match-up. I mean, who loses 
to the Jets in the playoffs?

I guess Arizona need a stop...(how is that for analysis)?
 
Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 14:20, 4th quarter

Suddenly thereâ€™s lots of space in the Packers secondary - John Brown has 
plenty of room in making the 18 yard catch on the far side. Cards down to the 
10.
  That Jeff Janis - he gets around. Photograph: Mark J. Rebilas/USA Today Sports  
Packers 13-10 Cardinals, end of 3rd quarter

Two tiny runs and a defensive holding call help Arizona to another first down. 

Now David Johnson is out of the backfield and has himself a first down catch - 
itâ€™s a 10-yard gain that parks Arizona on the Green Bay 28-yards line as the 
third quarter comes to a close.
 
Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 2:21 3rd quarter

The rhythm is a dancer, and that dancer is Larry Fitzgerald, who runs a filthy 
route during his 22-yard reception.

Now Mike McCarthy is challenging whether or not itâ€™s a catch because he 
alleges the ball came loose when he hit the ground.

Damn it, this is a catch. This is dumb football replay horse patootie, and now 
McCarthy pays the price. Why did he challenge that? Now they have just a single 
time out left.

SO STUPID!!!!! I HATE STUPID FOOTBALL!

Cards on the GB 47, first down. 
 
Packers 13-10 Cardinals, 2:50 3rd quarter

The Pack start from the 35 thanks to a healthy return by Janis from the 
endzone - and how about that Janis?

After a penalty a pair of short runs and an incompletion, itâ€™s 3rd & 13. 

Rodgers in the shotgun, he finds Rodgers for a short gain, and Arizona force 
GB to punt: important play right there.


JustNow the punt is just 34-yards. Thatâ€™s short, and it puts Arizona on their 
31 instead of being buried deep in their own territory.

This stuff matters!

 
Catanzaro pops it through from 28 and the Cards have their first points since 
the early first quarter.
 
Packers 13-7 Cardinals, 5:09 3rd quarter

Palmer has Johnson open on the near side, about a yard outside the endzone, 
but he misfires incomplete. Thatâ€™s a terrible job by Palmer there - he has to 
hit the open Johsnon, and so the Cards have to settle for the field goal unit.
 
Packers 13-7 Cardinals, 5:14 3rd quarter

Palmer is feeling pressure and fires incomplete looking for the running back 
David Johnson.

3rd & goal....
 
Packers 13-7 Cardinals, 5:41 3rd quarter

Fells gets done for hammering Burnett while running towards his own endzone 
(you follow) - thatâ€™s not allowed and costs the Cards 15 yards and momentum.

So now itâ€™s 2nd & goal from the 15. 

Then the Packers are called for having 12 men on the field, which is not 
allowed, so itâ€™s 2nd & goal from the 10.

Some dumb yard trading going on right now. 
 
Packers 13-7 Cardinals, 6:45 3rd quarter

Cards have a little something something going on, an offensive rhythm thatâ€™s 
been missing for some time.

Fells, a catch over the middle for 11 yards, and you can tack on 15 more 
thanks to a silly unnecessary roughness call on Raji, who was aggressive with 
Fells after the catch.

Two plays later and Palmer has found Fitzgerald for a third time on this 
drive, this time in the middle of the field for a 19-yard gain.


Cards have 1st & goal from the seven. 
 
Packers 13-7 Cardinals, 8:38 3rd quarter

Fitzgerald on the far side, a little quick out that quickly goes for four 
yards.

Now heâ€™s looking for Fitzgerald again, this time down the far sideline - a 
perfectly thrown ball that lands in the safe hands of the Cards wideout. Thatâ€™s 
32 yards.

Then a buzzkill, a delay-of-game call. Now the Cards are on their own 47.
 
Rodgers on the run again - he fires while moving forward - he has Janis! Jeff 
Janis! Heâ€™s in the middle of the endzone with the football - itâ€™s a touchdown 
catch that puts the Pack on top!


Thatâ€™s 81 yards on just six plays for seven points, in stark contrast to the 
pair of 17-play first-half drives that earned just six points.

Cards in trouble - they need to figure out a way to penetrate GBâ€™s re-tooled 
secondary...pronto.
 
Packers 6-7 Cardinals, 10:25 3rd quarter

On second down, Rodgers is buying all kinds of time, running here, there, 
everywhere, but itâ€™s not enough to find a receiver. He throws it away, setting 
up 3rd & goal from the eight.

Now Rodgers has to burn a timeout. 



 
Packers 6-7 Cardinals, 11:04 3rd quarter

Hereâ€™s more good news for Packer fans - Lacy has back-to- back big runs.

The first is for 14 yards. 

The second is for 62! Glendale is arm-tackle town USA as Lacy motors down to 
the Cardinal eight - first and goal to go for Green Bay!
 
Of course they looked at it, because they look at every turnover: the ruling 
on the play stands. There was some question as to whther or not the ball hit 
the ground when Dix hit the turf. It did, but the ball did not move, and that 
means itâ€™s a catch...

Stupid NFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl> time wasting.
 
Palmer lofts a pass down the far sideline looking for Floyd but itâ€™s Ha Ha 
Clinton-Dix who makes a remarkable interception in traffic!

So we begin the half with back-to-back picks - who had this one as low scoring?
 
Packers 6-7 Cardinals, 13:34 3rd quarter

Packers blitz on second down and Palmer overthrows John Brown down the far 
sideline.

Palmer is exceptional at picking up the blitz, but didnâ€™t look it there. 

 
Rodgers is looking for Abbrederis but the throw is way short - Rashad Johnson 
has an easy pick for the Cardinals who will take over on the Packers 47!
 
Packers 6-7 Cardinals, 14:33 3rd quarter

Lacy, desperate to get something going, runs into the line for no gain. 

Then Rodgers hits Rodgers (roger roger) on a post play for a first down - 
thatâ€™s a 15-yard gain to the GB 35.
 
Packers have it to start the half - Janis chooses to take the touchback, and 
Green Bay will start at their 20.
 
Halftime

So if not for two flags on two very big plays, who knows how this game would 
look right now. One thing we can say confidently, there would be more points on 
the board.

Palmer and the Cards came out strong, but Green Bay managed to find their 
defensive footing, and more importantly, played the possession game to a tee. 
The Packers recovered from a pair of three-and-outs in the first quarter to put 
together a pair of drives that soaked up much of the ensuing play. That kept 
Palmer, who looks a bit jumpy in the pocket, on the sideline, which is the best 
place for him to bee if youâ€™re a cheesehead.

Here are some numbers...

Palmer was 8/14 for just 74 yards, Rodgers 16/26 for 121 yards. He wasnâ€™t 
sacked, which was kind of amazing since he was eight times by Arizona just 
three weeks ago.

Rodgers was also the Packers leading rusher - true story - with 21 yards, 
mostly because big Eddie Lacy hasnâ€™t gotten it going yet.

David Johnsonâ€™s wheels are hardly turning for the Cards: he has just 16 yards 
on six carries.

John Brown has 34 yards receiving for AZ, Abbrederis and Janis have combined 
for 91 yards as they try to make up for the loss of Randall Cobb.

Second half action coming soon. Please stand by. 
 
What can the Cards do with 57 seconds?


Palmer hits Floyd, who has it, then doesnâ€™t have it, has it again, and doesnâ€™t 
have it, bobbles it some more and itâ€™s incomplete.

Then Palmer is sent to the turf! Thatsâ€™ defensive tackle Mike Daniels with the 
sack for GBâ€™s defense which has, rather stunningly, allowed just 75 yards so 
far to this high-octane Cards offense.

I say stunningly, because it looked like Palmer and the Cards were going to 
run over the Packers early on...but no.

Now itâ€™s 3rd & 19 and Johnson runs the ball so the clock runs out. Half over. 
 
Here we go. Rodgers is blitzed and has to chuck it away again! So here comes 
the field goal unit after the Green Bay drive stalls again.


Crosby has another easy one - 34 yards this time, and itâ€™s good. 

Thatâ€™s 17 plays, 71 yards and 7:55 for three points. 

That means six points from 34 plays in 15:26...if keeping Palmer off the field 
was their goal, well, so far so good.
 
Packers 3-7 Cardinals, 1:07 2nd quarter

Rodgers throws a screen to Starks on the far side but he goes nowhere. 

Now Rodgers pump fakes and then wanders to his right before throwing it away 
out of the endzone. He doesnâ€™t have a lot of options back there without Cobb.

Big 3rd & 14...and Rodgers wants to talk it over with head coach Mike 
McCarthy. Thatâ€™s their second time out.
 
Rodgers hits Janis, who is streaking across the middle and has first-down 
yardage.


Then the 13th play of this GB drive is a Eddie Lacy run for a one-yard loss. 

Now Rodgers hits Janis, AGAIN! Another first down, this time the play is to 
the far sideline.

Weâ€™ve hit the two-minute warning where the Packers are threatening on the 
Cards 12...
