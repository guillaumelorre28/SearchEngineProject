Anger management 

The essence of drama is conflict. Thus, Tacita Dean’s 16mm film portrait of an 
actor begins with Stephen Dillane circling the stage: a black silhouette 
waiting to be filled in, swearing liberally. It establishes bad feeling (real, 
faked?), between Dillane and the artist seated in the audience and is the first 
of their many plays on art, life and the grey areas in between.

Method in the madness 

Dean cuts between four performances, with Dillane’s wigs registering the 
changes. He shifts mode just as quickly, from Shakespearian swagger to 
naturalism.

A kind of magic 

With the emphasis firmly on illusion and delusion, we get the magician 
Prospero, a story about puppets and reflections on Dillane’s parents’ dementia; 
or is this also simply part of the script?

Talk the talk 

The charmed circle of the stage is repeatedly conjured and destroyed, but the 
film offers more than Brechtian alienation amped up to 11. It’s weighty with 
provocative insight, not least the comparison between the actor, uniquely free 
to flit between different texts, and people with dementia in a home, enjoying 
conversation without knowing what it is they’re talking about.
