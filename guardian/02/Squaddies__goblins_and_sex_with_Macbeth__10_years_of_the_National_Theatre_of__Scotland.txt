The debut

Home, various venues, 2006
There had been talk of a Scottish national theatre since the early 19th 
century, so it was with considerable weight of expectation that Vicky 
Featherstone launched her self-styled “theatre without walls”10 years ago 
<http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/national-not-nebulous-plays-for-today-1-1405133>
. She did so in a way that would define its maverick spirit. Not with red 
carpets, classic texts and theatrical grandees, but with 10 site-specific 
performances around the country on the same weekend. I saw amateur actors on a 
ferry in Lerwick, domestic drama in an Aberdeen council flat, a first 
minister’s question time written by schoolchildren and abseiling actors scaling 
down a Glasgow tower block. The National Theatre of Scotland had arrived.

The global hit

Black Watch, Drill Hall, Edinburgh, 2006
For all the careful planning that went into the inaugural year of the NTS, the 
one thing the company hadn’t anticipated was success. And Black Watch was a 
world-straddling hit, which would divert its attention for several years to 
come. Written by Gregory Burke and directed by John Tiffany, it told the story 
of a band of Fife squaddies on tour in Iraq at the very time when their 
regiment was being amalgamated into the Royal Regiment ofScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>. Staged on the scale of a military 
tattoo, it varied from the poetic to the scabrous, from the intimate to the 
international, as it foregrounded the little-heard voice of the ordinary 
soldier.

The impossible classic

Peer Gynt, Dundee Rep, 2007
The NTS was established not only to stage its own work but also to showcase 
Scotland’s existing companies. This collaboration with Dundee Rep on Ibsen’s 
unwieldy epic showed what could be achieved with a large permanent ensemble and 
a director as gifted as Dominic Hill. Sharing out the title role between Keith 
Fleming and Gerry Mulgrew – both on mesmerising form – Hill staged Colin 
Teevan’s translation with a vulgar raucousness, beginning with a wedding party 
in the foyer and continuing with a rock’n’roll swagger. Despite the swearing, 
comedy and irreverence of this “old whore of a tale”, it still hit a tone of 
poignancy by the end.

The solo turn

Macbeth, Tramway, Glasgow, 2013 
Famous faces to have worked with the NTS include Siobhan Redmond, Sofie Gråbøl 
and Billy Boyd, but few have been more starry than Alan Cumming. Having done a 
cheeky turn as Dionysus, the god of good times, inThe Bacchae 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/aug/13/edinburghfestival2007.edinburghfestival3>
, the Perthshire-born New Yorker returned to play the whole of Macbeth 
single-handed. Remarkably, he pulled it off. Working with director John 
Tiffany, he reconceived the tragedy as the disturbed imaginings of a 
psychiatric patient. Well cast in every role, he even managed to create a 
convincingly erotic sex scene between himself as Macbeth and himself as Lady 
Macbeth.

The verse comedy

The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart, Tron, Glasgow, 2011
National theatres tend to do things on a grand scale, but the “theatre without 
walls” approach allows the NTS to operate at any level. That includes 
performing in pubs – the route taken by David Greig’s modern take on the 
traditional borders ballad. A comically spooky tale of an academic who gets 
snowed in after a conference in Kelso, it was staged by director Wils Wilson 
around the bar-room tables where the audience sat. It was like being part of an 
unusually lively lock-in, complete with rhyming couplets, satirical stings and 
Kylie Minogue covers.

The blockbuster

The James Plays, Edinburgh festival theatre, 2015
The critic who claimed The James Plays plays were better than Shakespeare may 
have been overstating the case, but there’s no denying the accomplishment of 
Rona Munro’s historical trilogy. That Laurie Sansom chose to mark his arrival 
as artistic director of the NTS with a production spanning nearly eight hours 
demonstrated either recklessness or rare confidence. Either way, he did an 
impressive job of turning a little-known period of 15th-century history into 
something bold, gripping and funny. The three plays areback on tour

The community joyride 

Ignition, Brae, Shetland, 2013
If you live on an island, it’s hard to get by without a car. For many, there 
isn’t a major life event that happens without motorised transport. That’s why 
Wils Wilson’s Ignition was not just about cars but performed in them. From 
inside your vehicle, you heard from hitchhikers, watched displays of 
free-running and tuned in to stories on the radio. It was a novel experience, 
but it wasn’t just about the performance. One of many large-scale community 
projects set up by Simon Sharkey’s Learn department, it was the culmination of 
a six-month programme of songwriting, parkour training, knitting classes and 
reminiscence sessions that reached across Shetland.

The children’s show

Gobbo, North Edinburgh Arts Centre, 2006
When it comes to performances for younger audiences, it’s tempting to single 
out Mr Write, in which Rob Drummond conjured up a script about someone in the 
audience; Dragon, in which Vox Motus told a wordless story about grief; orA 
Christmas Carol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/06/a-christmas-carol-review>, in 
which Graham McLaren upped the gothic creepiness. But the one I loved most was 
Gobbo, a cross between a wild children’s party and an unorthodox fairy story 
that was as silly as it was imaginative. Written by David Greig (long before 
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory andThe Lorax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/17/dr-seuss-the-lorax-old-vic-london-family-show-david-greig>
), it was about a goblin who goes on an epic island quest and was performed 
with an exhilarating love of make-believe.

The frequent flier

Roam, Edinburgh international airport, 2006
Did the disembarking passengers ever realise they were walking into a 
theatrical performance? Probably not, but for those of us in the audience of 
Roam, the travellers were the realistic backdrop for a show about international 
travel, the movement of people and baggage, emotional and physical. Staged by 
site-specific specialists Grid Iron, Ben Harrison’s production took us beyond 
the check-in desks to reflect on a globalised world of holidaymakers, 
terrorists and refugees. Playing with the airport’s duel role as supplier of 
consumer fantasies and upholder of border controls, the show flew us through 
light and shade.

The online game-changer

Five Minute Theatre, 2011
With the possible exception of the Wall of Death fairground act, Five Minute 
Theatre was the NTS’s most audacious redefinition of what theatre could be. 
Watched online, it was a 24-hour compendium of mini-plays from around the 
world, most of them performed and streamed live. Amateurs, professionals, 
adults, children, old hands and first timers turned up in farmyards, 
treehouses, libraries, trains and caves. It wasn’t exactly that all of them 
were good, but such was the variety, imagination and enthusiasm, it was almost 
impossible to stop watching. See for yourselfon the website
