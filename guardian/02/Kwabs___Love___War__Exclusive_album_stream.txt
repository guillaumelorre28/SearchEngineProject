Kwabs says he’d always envisioned writing a debut album that he “could sing 
from a mountaintop”. His vocals are certainly big enough for such a location, 
although it would have to be a summit set up with an impressive range of 
technology. Because what makes Love + War stand out is the contrast between 
soulful emotive and inventive, synth-led production.

Certainly the electronic setting helps make the 24-year-old stand out from the 
plethora of MOR soul singers currently clogging up the charts. Featuring 
appearances from the likes of SOHN and Dave Okumu, Love + War tops a year that 
has seen Kwabs appear on the BBC’s Sound of 2015 longlist, score 200m streams 
for his hit single Walk and guest on Disclosure’s forthcoming second album. 
It’s an album aimed at the pop mainstream, but also one on which the 
London-born singer gets personal at times, especially on Father Figure and the 
closing track Cheating on Me.

“My story’s quite mixed up,” says Kwabs, acknowledging a journey that has 
taken him from growing up in social care to discovering his Ghanaian family 
roots to winning a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. “And my 
influences are quite mixed up because of my background. Whenever I try to 
explain that to people, they find me hard to categorise because they find it 
unfamiliar. I question it sometimes – should I be something more familiar to 
people? But I like it, I like being the product of several different weird 
parts.”
