Following its best screenplay Oscar win 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/23/oscars-2015-list-of-winners>, The 
Imitation Game is getting a second theatrical wind. A few months ago, we 
reminded ourselves thatAlan Turing was not, in fact, a crossword fiend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/nov/17/crossword-blog-alan-turing-no-crossword-fiend-imitation-game>
.

Of course, we have nothing against the sculpting of fact into biopic here at 
the crossword blog; it’s unquestionably interesting, though, that crosswording 
was not among Turing’s many intellectual pursuits. And arecent piece in Visual 
Thesaurus’s Word Count blog 
<https://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wc/the-palindrome-game-of-the-enigma-codebreakers/>
 gives a fascinating contrast concerning one particular type of wordplay – and 
concerning not Turing, butPeter Hilton 
<http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Eckmann-Hilton+argument>, played in the movie by 
Matthew Beard.

Hilton was recruited young to Bletchley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/dec/02/peter-hilton-obituary> – he’d 
completed one term of undergraduate maths, but had also taught himself German 
for a year. His description of his work in Michael Smith’sThe Secrets of 
Station X <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/secrets-of-station-x.html>is 
familiar to any solver of cryptics ...

There is this enormous excitement in codebreaking that what appears to be 
utter gibberish really makes sense only if you have the key, and I could do 
that sort of thing for 30 hours at a stretch and never feel tired.

... except perhaps the 30-hour part. So what did he do with his downtime? 
Bawdy songs, apparently, dirty jokes ... and palindromes.

Bletchley Park had an in-park competition based on those phrases which read 
the same backwards as forwards,as described in our Cryptic Crosswords for 
Beginners series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/nov/01/cryptic-crosswords-beginners-palindromes>
.

The challenge was to improve on STEP ON NO PETS, which Hilton bested after two 
days with SEX AT NOON TAXES – a phrase that started appearing in collections of 
wordplay in the 1970s, though, as with the actual work of those at Bletchley, 
unattributed.

Hilton went one further, though. His was a mind that could memorise the long 
strings of characters spewed out by two different teleprinters, then unravel 
them in his mind. So it’s no surprise to readthis account 
<https://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wc/the-palindrome-game-of-the-enigma-codebreakers/>
 from Mark Saltveit, editor of the Palindromist Magazine:

Incredibly, the young codebreaker did not use paper or pencil while composing 
his epic palindrome. He simply lay on his bed, eyes closed, and assembled it in 
his mind over one long night. It took him five hours.

The palindrome in question is one that beats MADAM, I’M ADAM and A MAN, A 
PLAN, A CANAL: PANAMA on length and at the very least rivals them on the 
surface reading:

Doc, note: I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.

Perfectly good biological advice, and exploited by the arch-fiend Sabre in a 
recent (issue 143) puzzle in the Magpie magazine, which you shouldsubscribe to 
<http://www.piemag.com/> if you’ve ever had a yen to make sense of apparent 
gibberish for 30 exciting hours at a time.
