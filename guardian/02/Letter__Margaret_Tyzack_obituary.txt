<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/27/margaret-tyzack-obituary>
, 28 June) gave her final stage performance last Christmas, in Paris, at the 
Théâtre du Chatelet, in Robert Carsen's sumptuous production of My Fair Lady. 
Maggie played Mrs Higgins, and I was her son, Henry. Maggie looked resplendent 
in Anthony Powell's Dufy-inspired frocks, and delivered a characteristically 
sensitive, no-nonsense, witty, masterclass of a performance. Every Shavian line 
landed like a depth charge in that vast and beautiful theatre. I had worked 
with Maggie twice before then – in The Importance of Being Earnest and in His 
Girl Friday. Maggie was a magnificent actor, a magnificent person, and a true 
friend – loyal, supportive, generous, forthright, and a prolific sender of 
wonderful postcards.
