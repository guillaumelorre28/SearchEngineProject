In a tale that could easily pass off as an April Fools' Day gag, but 
apparently isn't, the Sun is reporting thatBBC bosses have decided to change 
the name of their new gymnastics show, Let's Get Ready to Tumble, over fears 
that it might get pulled up by Ant and Dec. The duo had a 1994 "hit" with Let's 
Get Ready to Rhumble and it landed back in the charts (last March) after they 
performed it on their show Saturday Night Takeaway. An ever reliable 'source' 
said: "It works, but it's too similar to Ant and Dec's song so everyone was 
worried it would cause problems." Quite howUS boxing ring announcer Michael 
Buffer <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Buffer> has avoided the geordie 
pair's wrath for the past 30 years is beyond Monkey.
