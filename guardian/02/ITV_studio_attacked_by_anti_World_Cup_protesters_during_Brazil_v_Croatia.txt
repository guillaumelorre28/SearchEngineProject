During a turbulent opening day on and off the pitch in Brazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brazil>, anti-World Cup protesters turned 
their attention to the ITV studio on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, 
pelting it with rocks.

ITV’s World Cup presenter Adrian Chiles was in the studio alongside pundits 
Lee Dixon, Fabio Cannavaro and Patrick Vieira during the attack, which occurred 
duringBrazil’s 3-1 victory over Croatia

. The resulting damage included significant marks to large glass panels.

“This demonstration materialised about 10 minutes before the end of the game,” 
Chiles explained. “We were all sitting up here and then suddenly sharp 
clattering sounds started greeting our ears. That was them pelting the glass of 
our studio and other studios around here. We did try to explain to them that 
none of this is our fault at ITV Sport.”

Earlier in the day, Brazilian police fired teargas and concussion grenades at 
protesters in Rio and São Paolo

. The confrontation ahead of the opening ceremony at the Arena Corinthians led 
to at least one arrest and five injuries, including a suspected broken arm 
suffered by a CNN producer who was hit by a teargas canister.
