Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu feels like such a fixture of the Australian music 
scene that it’s hard to believe his debut self-titled albumGurrumul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/27/geoffrey-gurrumul-yunupingu-review>
 only came out in 2008. That record quickly went triple-platinum and catapulted 
its maker’s reputation, shored up with a second release,Rrakala

, in 2011, performed in a mixture of his native Yolgnu and English.

Now he’s back with his third studio record, The Gospel Album, released on 31 
July. It was inspired by Gurrumul’s mother and aunts, who raised him on the 
songs of the local Methodist church on Elcho Island, north-east Arnhem Land 
where he grew up.

Produced by Gurrumul’s long-time collaborator, Skinnyfish’s Michael Hohnen, 
this collection of 12 songs re-imagines those missionary spirituals in a style 
that could only come from the remotest corner of the Northern Territory. 
Gurrumul has been off wowing US audiences in New York, California and New 
Orleans, where Quincy Jones praised “one of the most unusual and emotional and 
musical voices I’ve ever heard”.

He’s in Sydney to play the Enmore theatre on Wednesday night
