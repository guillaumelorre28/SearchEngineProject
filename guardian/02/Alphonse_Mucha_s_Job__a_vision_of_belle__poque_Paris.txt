Alphonse Mucha’s poster for Job cigarette papers is one of the most famous 
works in design history. Taking its cue from a new kind of female beauty, its 
modern girl has hair with a life of its own. The tendrils look more like the 
floating tentacles of a jellyfish.

Modern life

Mucha saw a spiritual, even moral, dimension to beautiful art, though that 
clearly didn’t exclude commercial gigs: his designs advertised railways, beer 
and bicycles.

Woman’s world

Mucha’s reputation soared on the Paris art scene, yet his big break was total 
chance. The story goes that Mucha was the only hand available at a printers’ 
one day close to Christmas in 1894 so was asked to create a poster for theatre 
star Sarah Bernhardt. Pitching her as a goddess-cum-saintly icon in muted hues, 
his design was a runaway sensation.

Flower power

For most people, though, the Job poster is less likely to be associated with 
belle époque Paris, than the swinging 1960s. Its blissed-out smoker and trippy 
swirls made it an obvious choice for the bedroom walls of a later generation of 
freedom-seekers
