Sarandos, the company’s chief content officer, lured Sandler to Netflix for a 
four-picture deal and has come out in defence of the star.

“[I’m] thrilled,” he told the Hollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-boss-defends-adam-sandler-811525>
 when asked about the deal. “Not to give you a defensive answer there. I 
definitely don’t have to defend Adam Sandler.”

While Pixels <https://www.theguardian.com/film/pixels> has had a rough start 
in the US, the action comedy – about aliens attacking earth in the form of 
classic arcade games – has had a solid $25m international start.

“That’s why we made a deal with Adam Sandler: because he’s an enormous 
international movie star,” Sarandos said. “That $25m opening for Pixels is 
pretty respectable, and I think it will continue to grow. We are more 
encouraged than ever, and that split of US and international box office is 
exciting.”

The budget for Pixels is an estimated $88m, a figure it may not make back in 
the US alone. It’s the latest underperforming film for Sandler, followingBlended
