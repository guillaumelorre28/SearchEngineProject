The six stamps are devoted to classic Christie mysteries, including her debut 
The Mysterious Affair at Styles, which Christie began writing 100 years ago at 
the age of 26, and another Hercule Poirot mystery, Murder on the Orient Express 
– appropriately enough a first class stamp. Each design includes microtext, UV 
ink and thermochromic ink. These concealed clues can be revealed using either a 
magnifying glass, UV light or body heat and and provide pointers to the 
mysteries’ solutions.

“With more than two billion book sales worldwide, crime writer and playwright 
Agatha Christie has been outsold only by Shakespeare and the Bible,” said the
Royal Mail <https://www.theguardian.com/business/royal-mail>. “So it’s fitting 
that we mark not just the centenary of her writing her first crime novel, but 
also the 40th anniversary of her death with a stamp issue that’s full of 
intrigue.”

The series, designed by Jim Sutherland and Neil Webb, also includes the Miss 
Marple mysteries The Body in the Library and A Murder Is Announced, along with 
the Poirot tale The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, and the story of murder and mayhem 
on an island off the Devon coast adapted by the BBC last Christmas, And Then 
There Were None.

“I am delighted that, 100 years after she wrote her first detective novel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/10/crime-fiction-new-generation-golden-age-agatha-christie>
, my grandmother’s works are being celebrated in such a unique way by Royal 
Mail,” said Christie’s grandson Mathew Prichard. “The ingenuity of her 
mysteries is cleverly represented in these distinctive designs, with the use of 
cutting edge technology – a welcome alliance of the traditional and the modern 
– adding to the delight. I am certain that … mystery lovers will relish the 
puzzles that each stamp presents.”
