Monster hit

Albrecht Dürer had a showman’s instincts for killer subject matter. When 
history’s greatest print-maker decided to create an image of the rhinoceros 
that had visited Lisbon in 1515, it became one of the most influential animal 
pictures ever.

Prints charming

Perhaps anticipating high demand, Dürer rendered the animal not as an 
engraving, but a cheaper woodcut, which meant it could be quickly and easily 
reproduced.

Animal magic

Are those shoulders and flanks or plates of armour? Dürer had never seen his 
battleship of an animal in the flesh. His woodcut is derived from a written 
description and sketch by an unknown artist. It combines his passion for 
science with his gift for the awesome and fantastic.

Reality check

It’s a pre-eminent example of art besting reality. In Europe, Dürer’s rhino 
was taken to be the real deal well into the 18th century, when actual rhinos 
toured the continent and dispelled the illusion. Prior to that it inspired work 
as diverse as illustrations in naturalist books, the Duke of Florence’s emblem, 
and a relief sculpture on the doors of Pisa cathedral.
