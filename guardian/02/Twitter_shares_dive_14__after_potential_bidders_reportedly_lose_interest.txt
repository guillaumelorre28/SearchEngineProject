Shares in Twitter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> fell more 
than 14% on Monday following reports that all of its rumoured potential bidders 
have lost interest in buying the struggling social media company.


The shares, which spiked last month following speculation of a takeover by 
companies including Google, fell $2.82, or 14%, to $17.03 in early trading 
after Bloomberg reported that Twitter was unlikely to receive any takeover bids.

Google owner Alphabet, Walt Disney and Silicon Valley tech firm Salesforce 
have all been working with investment banks on a potential acquisition of the 
140-character service. ButBloomberg reported

 Google and Apple had decided against buying the company, which has been 
struggling to attract new users and build revenue.

Twitter’s stock market decline brings the company’s share price back below the 
level it was trading at before thetakeover speculation was first reported on 23 
September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/twitter-shares-google-salesforce-takeover>
.

The social media company, which floated on the stock market in November 2013 
at $26 a share and whose shares reached a high of $69 soon after, had hired 
Goldman Sachs Group and Allen & Co to investigate a sale.

Twitter’s chief executive and co-founder Jack Dorsey was opposed to a sale, 
but fellow co-founder and board member Ev Williams supported it. The company is 
reported to have hoped to conclude a sale before it reported its third quarter 
results on 27 October.

Salesforce had been seen as the most likely buyer as its chief executive Mark 
Benioff had publicly expressed his interest in Twitter. However, he appeared 
not to have sounded out his investors in advance.

Benioff was forced onto the defensive at a shareholder meeting last week after 
many investors publicly and privately expressed their doubts about the deal.

“I read all of your notes; you probably know that,” he said at the meeting in 
San Francisco. “I also read your emails. And as I digest all of that 
information, this is actually the No 1 thing that has been on my mind. In some 
cases we have been unusually surprised and we have had to do a reset.”


Salesforce’s shares, which had been depressed following the Twitter 
acquisition speculation, rose by 5.4% to $74.70 on Monday – taking them back to 
roughly the level they were at before the takeover talk was first reported.
