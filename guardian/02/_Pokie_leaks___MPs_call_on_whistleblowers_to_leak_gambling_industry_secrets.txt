Three federal MPs are calling on workers in the poker machine industry to 
become whistleblowers and send them secret information about how the industry 
conducts its business.

Independent senators Nick Xenophon and Andrew Wilkie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/andrew-wilkie>, and Greens senator 
Larissa Waters, launched their “pokie-leaks” campaign on Tuesday.

They want information such as how poker machines are designed to exploit 
vulnerable players, or how the industry influences political parties behind the 
scenes.

They would release the information in the Senate using parliamentary 
privilege, they said. They promised to keep whistleblowers’ identities 
protected at all times.

Waters told Guardian Australia the campaign would allow her parliamentary 
colleagues to expose the methods used by the industry to entrap gamblers.

She said using parliamentary privilege was a way to shield whistleblowers 
without involving complicated legislative provisions, which vary from state to 
state.

“We want to help the public realise that they’re being conned by poker 
machines,” she said.


“The industry has a history of making big donations to the major political 
parties, and they’ve got a history of suing politicians who get in their way, 
so I’m under no illusions that this will be a walk in the park.”

 Australians lost $1,241 per person on gambling in 2014-15, with poker 
machines the biggest cause of gambler losses at $11.6bn, an increase of 4.9% on 
the previous year.

The politicians’ campaign is supported by the Alliance for Gambling Reform 
<http://www.pokiesplayyou.org.au/>, a coalition of business people, academics 
and politicians who want greater restrictions on the industry.

Xenophon said his Adelaide office had recently received a USB anonymously with 
information that might expose how poker machines are programmed to make play 
more addictive.

If you know something that needs to be revealed, tell us, and with 
parliamentary privilege, we can tell everyone
Nick Xenophon 
“If you know something that needs to be revealed, tell us, and with 
parliamentary privilege, we can tell everyone. For too long, this predatory 
industry has relied on secret and harmful features, which are designed to be 
addictive,”he said

Also attending the “pokie-leaks” campaign launch were former gambling addict

Aristocrat for misleading and deceptive conduct under consumer law.
