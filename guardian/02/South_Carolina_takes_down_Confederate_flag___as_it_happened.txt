We’re going to close our coverage of the ceremony in Columbia, where the 
Confederate flag was officially removed from the statehouse premises for the 
first time in more than 50 years. You can reada full version of the story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/10/confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse>
 by my colleague Amanda Holpuchhere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/10/confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse>
.

As a crowd of mostly anti-flag demonstrators cheered, cried and applauded, a 
squad of theSouth Carolina <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> 
highway patrol honor guard spun down the flag, folded it and delivered it into 
the hands of a museum director. Governor Nikki Haley, who signed the law 
ordering the flag’s removal on Thursday, looked on from the statehouse steps.

Leaders praised the flag’s removal, with Barack Obama calling it “a meaningful 
step towards a better future” and representative James Clyburn saying “an era 
of division is over.”

The removal of the flag is a victory for activists who have protested the flag 
as an emblem of racism inextricably linked to the cruelties of the slaveholding 
south. Although a campaign has simmered for decades to remove the flag from 
public spaces in South Carolina and other former secessionist states, it gained 
extraordinary impetus following the murder of nine black people at a Charleston 
church, by a gunman believed to espouse racist beliefs.

scene right before the flag came down, with a crew of politicians and staffers 
have assembled on the State House steps and the crowd chanting, “Take it down.”

The battle over symbols of the Confederacy – their meaning, their place, their 
characterization – is far from over. Debates have begun again in Mississippi 
and Louisiana, and a controversial monument remains even on the ground of the
South Carolina <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> statehouse 
where the battle flag just went down.

From the LA Times 
<http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-confederate-flag-remove-south-carolina-20150709-story.html#page=1>
:

State Rep Joseph H Neal, a black Democrat whose ancestors were brought to 
South Carolina as slaves, has particular concerns about the statue of a 
resolute-looking Benjamin Tillman. An inscription eulogizes Tillman as a 
patriot, statesman, governor and US senator who was “the friend and leader of 
the common people.”

“He built his political career on a call for the genocide of black people in 
South Carolina,” Neal said Thursday. “He said, ‘Kill ’em all.’”

Tillman also advocated repealing the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
that guaranteed blacks the right to vote, and was a member of an all-white 
militia responsible for lynchings.

Neal doesn’t want to remove the statue. He would rather add a placard that 
accurately reflects Tillman’s legacy as “a monster.”

The officers turn in unison, with one holding the flag at their head, and they 
begin their rigid march back toward the statehouse steps.

The director of the Confederate relic and history museum takes the flag from 
the officer and leaves under guard. The governor shakes hands with the men and 
women around her, and the crowd continues its giddy cheering and applause.

Confederate flag taken down

One opens a gate for another, and they turn a winch on the flag pole. 

The flag comes down to massive applause and cheering.

There’s a crowd of several hundred people around the statehouse, most of whom 
cordoned away from the square where the Confederate flag flies.

Over the live stream there are several competing chants, but only “take it 
down!” is intelligible. Governor Nikki Haley has arrived, but there’s till no 
activity on the lawn.

Beyond whatever solemn pomp is planned for this morning’s ceremony, it’s not 
actually clear how officials will take down the flag: it has no rope or pulley, 
apparently designed as such to prevent opponents from pulling it down more 
frequently.

Per the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/us/south-carolina-confederate-flag.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0>
:

Part of the mystery is practical: The pole to which the flag is attached 
appears to have no mechanism — no winch, pulley, or rope — that a person on the 
ground might use to bring it down. Some have speculated that this design was 
all part of the passion that surrounds anything to do with the battle flag, 
which had originally flown over the State House but was moved to the pole, next 
to a Confederate soldiers’ memorial, after a bitter debate and political 
compromise in 2000.

It’s “a pretty even mix of pro- and anti-flag” in Columbia, where Matthew 
Teague is in Columbia reporting for the Guardian.

This gentleman is Ronald Brock, who drove across the continent from California 
to protest the taking down of the flag. The battle flags on his truck have a 
script on them reading: “I Ain’t Comin’ Down.”

Then there’s Charlene Stoll Hale, who is fairly representative of the pro-flag 
contingent. She’s from Lexington, SC.

“I’m here to honor my three great-grandfathers who fought in the civil war.”

What about the fact that they were fighting to preserve slavery? Does the flag 
carry no racist overtones?

“It may for some people, but not for me.”

The Confederate flag will be taken down from South Carolina’s capitol today, 
less than a month after nine black people were killed at a historic church, a 
half-century after lawmakers raised the flag in protest to desegregation, and 
more than 150 years after the state seceded from the union in a war that 
abolished the right to own slaves there.

On Thursday Governor Nikki Haley signed the law that will remove the flag 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/09/south-carolina-confederate-flag-friday>
 at a ceremony around 10am ET, following 15 hours of debate by lawmakers as to 
the flag’s meaning as a symbol of slavery or an artifact of heritage.

“The Confederate flag is coming off the grounds of the South Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> statehouse,” Haley said at 
a signing ceremony. “It’s hard for us to look at what is happening today and 
not think back to 22 days ago. It seems like so long ago because the grieving 
has been so hard.”

In June, nine black people were murdered during a Bible study session in 
Charleston, South Carolina, by a gunman believed to have espoused white 
supremacy. The mass shooting reinvigorated a campaign to remove take down 
public displays of the flag, with which the shootings suspect posed in photos.

The flag will be placed in a Confederate relic room and military museum.

We’re going to close our coverage of the ceremony in Columbia, where the 
Confederate flag was officially removed from the statehouse premises for the 
first time in more than 50 years. You can reada full version of the story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/10/confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse>
 by my colleague Amanda Holpuchhere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/10/confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse>
.

As a crowd of mostly anti-flag demonstrators cheered, cried and applauded, a 
squad of theSouth Carolina <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> 
highway patrol honor guard spun down the flag, folded it and delivered it into 
the hands of a museum director. Governor Nikki Haley, who signed the law 
ordering the flag’s removal on Thursday, looked on from the statehouse steps.

Leaders praised the flag’s removal, with Barack Obama calling it “a meaningful 
step towards a better future” and representative James Clyburn saying “an era 
of division is over.”

The removal of the flag is a victory for activists who have protested the flag 
as an emblem of racism inextricably linked to the cruelties of the slaveholding 
south. Although a campaign has simmered for decades to remove the flag from 
public spaces in South Carolina and other former secessionist states, it gained 
extraordinary impetus following the murder of nine black people at a Charleston 
church, by a gunman believed to espouse racist beliefs.
 
Matthew Teague, reporting for the Guardian from Columbia, sends a photo of the 
scene right before the flag came down, with a crew of politicians and staffers 
have assembled on the State House steps and the crowd chanting, “Take it down.”

The battle over symbols of the Confederacy – their meaning, their place, their 
characterization – is far from over. Debates have begun again in Mississippi 
and Louisiana, and a controversial monument remains even on the ground of the
South Carolina <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> statehouse 
where the battle flag just went down.

From the LA Times 
<http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-confederate-flag-remove-south-carolina-20150709-story.html#page=1>
:

State Rep Joseph H Neal, a black Democrat whose ancestors were brought to 
South Carolina as slaves, has particular concerns about the statue of a 
resolute-looking Benjamin Tillman. An inscription eulogizes Tillman as a 
patriot, statesman, governor and US senator who was “the friend and leader of 
the common people.”

“He built his political career on a call for the genocide of black people in 
South Carolina,” Neal said Thursday. “He said, ‘Kill ’em all.’”

Tillman also advocated repealing the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
that guaranteed blacks the right to vote, and was a member of an all-white 
militia responsible for lynchings.

Neal doesn’t want to remove the statue. He would rather add a placard that 
accurately reflects Tillman’s legacy as “a monster.”

The officers turn in unison, with one holding the flag at their head, and they 
begin their rigid march back toward the statehouse steps.

The director of the Confederate relic and history museum takes the flag from 
the officer and leaves under guard. The governor shakes hands with the men and 
women around her, and the crowd continues its giddy cheering and applause.

There’s a crowd of several hundred people around the statehouse, most of whom 
cordoned away from the square where the Confederate flag flies.

Over the live stream there are several competing chants, but only “take it

activity on the lawn.

Beyond whatever solemn pomp is planned for this morning’s ceremony, it’s not 
actually clear how officials will take down the flag: it has no rope or pulley, 
apparently designed as such to prevent opponents from pulling it down more 
frequently.

Per the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/us/south-carolina-confederate-flag.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0>
:

Part of the mystery is practical: The pole to which the flag is attached 
appears to have no mechanism — no winch, pulley, or rope — that a person on the 
ground might use to bring it down. Some have speculated that this design was 
all part of the passion that surrounds anything to do with the battle flag, 
which had originally flown over the State House but was moved to the pole, next 
to a Confederate soldiers’ memorial, after a bitter debate and political 
compromise in 2000.

Two weeks ago an activist needed climbing gear and a friend as spotter to 
hoist herself up and pull it down (they werepromptly arrested

).
 
The the statehouse there’re officers from the South Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> Highway Patrol, the 
director of the Confederate Relic Room (who’ll take once it’s down), and Jesse 
Jackson. The mayor, two former governors and the interim pastor from 
Charleston’s Emanuel AME church are all expected as well.

It’s “a pretty even mix of pro- and anti-flag” in Columbia, where Matthew 
Teague is in Columbia reporting for the Guardian.

This gentleman is Ronald Brock, who drove across the continent from California 
to protest the taking down of the flag. The battle flags on his truck have a 
script on them reading: “I Ain’t Comin’ Down.”

Then there’s Charlene Stoll Hale, who is fairly representative of the pro-flag 
contingent. She’s from Lexington, SC.

“I’m here to honor my three great-grandfathers who fought in the civil war.”

What about the fact that they were fighting to preserve slavery? Does the flag 
carry no racist overtones?

“It may for some people, but not for me.”
 
The Confederate flag will be taken down from South Carolina’s capitol today, 
less than a month after nine black people were killed at a historic church, a 
half-century after lawmakers raised the flag in protest to desegregation, and 
more than 150 years after the state seceded from the union in a war that 
abolished the right to own slaves there.

On Thursday Governor Nikki Haley signed the law that will remove the flag 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/09/south-carolina-confederate-flag-friday>
 at a ceremony around 10am ET, following 15 hours of debate by lawmakers as to 
the flag’s meaning as a symbol of slavery or an artifact of heritage.

“The Confederate flag is coming off the grounds of the South Carolina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina> statehouse,” Haley said at 
a signing ceremony. “It’s hard for us to look at what is happening today and 
not think back to 22 days ago. It seems like so long ago because the grieving 
has been so hard.”

In June, nine black people were murdered during a Bible study session in 
Charleston, South Carolina, by a gunman believed to have espoused white 
supremacy. The mass shooting reinvigorated a campaign to remove take down 
public displays of the flag, with which the shootings suspect posed in photos.

The flag will be placed in a Confederate relic room and military museum.
