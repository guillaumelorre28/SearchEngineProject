Playing arcade games on original hardware is the ultimate way to enjoy the 
arcade experience at home. But the cost – and size – of an arcade cabinet can 
be prohibitive. Yet there is a relatively unknown console that lets you play 
arcade hardware on a TV: the supergun.

Inside the arcade cabinet
Where games consoles have individual formats, such as PS4, SNES or Dreamcast, 
so do arcade cabinets. JAMMA is the most prolific. A JAMMA game comes on an 
arcade PCB: a slab of circuit board typically containing a single game that is 
“plugged in” inside a cabinet.

The supergun alternative
Imagine an arcade cabinet. Remove the screen, controls and the game from that 
vision. You’re left with a tangle of wires and circuit boards that is the 
cabinet’s heart. A supergun effectively squeezes that heart into a 
console-sized box, and provides a slot to plug in a JAMMA game, and a means to 
connect a TV and controller.

Where to find one
Superguns are largely made by sole arcade devotees. Jasen’s Customs builds and 
sells the MK30 ADCAP, a high-end supergun. Elsewhere, ArcadeForge’s MAK Strike 
is a popular option, or the brave can buy a kit and build their own. As for the 
JAMMA games, eBay is expensive, but UK trading forums such asArcade Otaku 
<http://forum.arcadeotaku.com/> and JAMMA+ <http://www.jammaplus.co.uk/> 
provide a marketplace and advice.

What about arcade ports?
Many classic arcade games have been released for console, but these ports 
often change the game and run at different speeds. And a wealth of superb 
arcade games have never seen a console version. Simply put, original hardware 
is the only authentic way to play true arcade games.
