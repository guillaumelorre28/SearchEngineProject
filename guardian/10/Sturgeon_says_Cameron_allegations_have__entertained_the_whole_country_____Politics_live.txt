Afternoon summary

 * Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has said the student drugs and 
debauchery allegations about David Cameron in a new biography by Lord Ashcroft 
have “entertained the nation”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/david-cameron-biography-downing-st-debauchery-claims>
 Downing Street has said it will not dignify the claims - which have generally 
prompted more amusement than outrage, at least on social media - with a 
response, although Tory sources have said that the most salacious allegation, 
involving a dead pig’s head, is “not true”. But Sturgeon and Labour’s Jon 
Trickett have both said Cameron should answer the charge that he knew about 
Ashcroft’s non-dom status earlier than he admitted ahead of the 2010 election. 
 * The Lib Dems have rejected a call for the party to commit itself to 
unilateral disarmament by 579 votes to 447.The vote is a victory for the new 
leader, Tim Farron, who wanted delegates to back existing policy, which 
proposes a scaled-down nuclear deterrent. 
 * George Osborne has sidestepped concerns over Downing Street’s growing 
proximity to Beijing, arguing that Britain should “run towards China” to help 
boost the UK economy. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/george-osborne-uk-should-do-more-business-with-china>
 * Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, has said Labour MPs should “show a 
little bit of respect” towards Jeremy Corbyn.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

My colleague Gary Younge has written up his take on the Ashcroft allegations. 
He says it is much easier to be reckless when you’re young if you’re 
privileged, not poor.

Nicola Sturgeon’s intervention is rather shrewd, for at least three reasons. 
First, she presents herself as someone with a sense of humour. Second, she is 
subtly implying that David Cameron has become a laughing stock. And, third, she 
has put pressure on Cameron to clarify his position on the claim that he did 
not tell the truth about when he first learnt about Lord Ashcroft’s non-dom 
status. This is the one issue that Labour is also pursuing. See12.44pm.

Sturgeon says Cameron has 'entertained the whole country'

Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has been commenting on the 
Ashcroft allegations. She did not know whether they were true or not, she said, 
but they did give us all some entertainment.

She said:

[Cameron] has entertained the whole country on a dreary Monday morning, so 
there is got to be something in that.

Sir Simon Hughes, the former Lib Dem MP, is winding up for those backing 
amendment one (ie, those in favour of a scaled-back nuclear deterrent). The 
current party policy was formed on the basis of evidence in the last 
parliament, he says. And it commits the party to work towards the elimination 
of nuclear weapons. And it commits Lib Dem MPs to voting against like-for-like
Trident <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> replacement.

Trident is a “sheathed weapon”, he says. That is better than having no weapon, 
he says.

Being in opposition should not be an excuse for casual policy making, he says.

Shirley Williams, the former Lib Dem leader in the Lords, is now speaking in 
theTrident <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> debate as it nears its end.

She says the world is on the edge of removing some nuclear threats; for 
example, Iran scaled back its nuclear programme in response to international

She says the leadership amendment (amendment one) will help Britain to lead 
internationally on this issue.

Lib Dems debate scrapping Trident

The Lib Dems have been debating a motion proposing scrapping Trident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>.

If it goes through - as it looks as though it may well do - it will be a blow 
toTim Farron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tim-farron> and the party 
leadership, which is backing an amendment defending existing party policy. 
Current policy is to oppose like-for-like replacement of Trident, but to 
support a cheaper nuclear alternative.

The motion would commit the party to full unilateralism.

We’ll get the vote very shortly.

Here is some comment on the debate.

From the Guardian’s Tom Clark

In a packed LDconf hall debating axing trident. From claps, it feels 50:50. 
Jez seems less extreme if they go for it

Any Labour people tempted by the LibDems should watch this Trident debate. 
It's basically kinder, gentler Corbynism versus fudge and mudge.

Ashcroft hints he's planning a second book critical of Cameron

Bad news for David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron>
. Following the publication of this biography,Lord Ashcroft may publish another 
potentially damaging memoir, he has hinted.

On his Twitter feed, Ashcroft has just posted a link to the full preface from 
his book.
Lord Ashcroft (@LordAshcroft) 
Full preface to my book on the PM, Call Me Dave, written with @IsabelOakeshott 
<https://twitter.com/IsabelOakeshott>. Hopefully it explains a great deal 
http://t.co/zAPkM7wKvw <http://t.co/zAPkM7wKvw>
 <https://twitter.com/LordAshcroft/status/645964492493451264> September 21, 
2015 <https://twitter.com/LordAshcroft/status/645964492493451264> 
Much of it appears in his article in today’s Mail. But the Mail left out this 
revelation. (Bold type inserted by me.)

Despite the disappointments I have described [no getting a government job], I 
want to be clear about my motivation for writing this book, which – however 
sorry I remain about what happened – is not about settling scores. I do not 
feature in the narrative at all, because I wanted to tell Cameron’s life story, 
not mine.My role in the party while he was Leader of the Opposition will be 
kept for another day.

He also reveals that he is already planning the second edition of Call Me Dave.

[Cameron] remained suspicious, and those around him were discouraged from 
speaking to us during our research.

Happily, a number of individuals close to him have helped, some only on 
condition of anonymity. Their input has been enormously valuable and it is a 
pity they cannot be thanked here. They know who they are.Perhaps when we come 
to update this book, as we intend, Cameron will have no fear.An overall 
majority is a wonderful achievement, however slim the margin. He has much of 
which to be proud.

That “have no fear” line is priceless, dripping with irony and menace.

Speaking at a fringe event at the Lib Dem conference also attended by Frances 
O’Grady, the TUC general secretary,Nick Clegg has warned against a “scorched 
earth” approach towards the European Union and complained about the attitude of 
the left towards the debate surrounding the upcoming referendum on Britain’s EU 
membership.

We’ve got to get away from this scorched earth politics where if you don’t 
like something you want to scrap the whole thing. If you don’t like Westminster 
– burn the whole thing to the ground. Since when in a mature democracy is it 
sensible to take a scorched earth approach, where every time you don’t like 
something you bash the nuclear button and blow everything up?

Just just because the Tory isolationists want to do that, the left, the centre 
left and and progressive forces in this country shouldn’t do so. I have seen it 
for five years now – parts of the left working themselves up into an absolute 
lather of indignation about some of the measures we had to do and in 
consequence – unwittingly perhaps – actually preparing the ground for what we 
have now got, which is a majority Conservative government.

I do not want to see these early rumblings of disquiet within the trade union 
movement cascade into something a whole lot worse. It could lead to an exit 
from the European Union and to profound damage to the life chances of many 
millions of working people in this country for many years to come. I just don’t 
think we should have any truck with it at all.


Clegg said that disaffected people may be tempted to deliver a “collective 
kick in the shins” to the Conservative government and that the unions should be 
clear about the benefits the EU brings to workers and not get wrapped up in 
debates about Cameron’s renegotiations. “I personally think that having an 
angry debate about renegotiation, in terms of tactics, is an odd place to 
start,” he said.

 * Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has said the student drugs and 
debauchery allegations about David Cameron in a new biography by Lord Ashcroft 
have “entertained the nation”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/david-cameron-biography-downing-st-debauchery-claims>
 Downing Street has said it will not dignify the claims - which have generally 
prompted more amusement than outrage, at least on social media - with a 
response, although Tory sources have said that the most salacious allegation, 
involving a dead pig’s head, is “not true”. But Sturgeon and Labour’s Jon 
Trickett have both said Cameron should answer the charge that he knew about 
Ashcroft’s non-dom status earlier than he admitted ahead of the 2010 election. 
 * The Lib Dems have rejected a call for the party to commit itself to 
unilateral disarmament by 579 votes to 447.The vote is a victory for the new 
leader, Tim Farron, who wanted delegates to back existing policy, which 
proposes a scaled-down nuclear deterrent. 
 * George Osborne has sidestepped concerns over Downing Street’s growing 
proximity to Beijing, arguing that Britain should “run towards China” to help 
boost the UK economy. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/george-osborne-uk-should-do-more-business-with-china>
 * Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, has said Labour MPs should “show a 
little bit of respect” towards Jeremy Corbyn.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
My colleague Gary Younge has written up his take on the Ashcroft allegations. 
He says it is much easier to be reckless when you’re young if you’re 
privileged, not poor.

If Nicola Sturgeon is saying the Cameron allegations have “entertained the 
whole country” (see 5.08pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/21/cameron-hit-by-student-drugs-and-debauchery-allegations-in-ashcroft-biography-politics-live#block-56002952e4b0c53c066a7071>
, the prime minister will at least be able to point to one area in which he is 
bringing the nations of the United Kingdom together.
 
Nicola Sturgeon’s intervention is rather shrewd, for at least three reasons. 
First, she presents herself as someone with a sense of humour. Second, she is 
subtly implying that David Cameron has become a laughing stock. And, third, she 
has put pressure on Cameron to clarify his position on the claim that he did 
not tell the truth about when he first learnt about Lord Ashcroft’s non-dom 
status. This is the one issue that Labour is also pursuing. See12.44pm.

The Lib Dems have rejected unilateralism. By 579 votes to 447, they backed 
existing policy, proposing a scaled-back nuclear deterrent.
 
Back at the Lib Dem conference they are voting on Trident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> now.
 
Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has been commenting on the 
Ashcroft allegations. She did not know whether they were true or not, she said, 
but they did give us all some entertainment.

She said:

[Cameron] has entertained the whole country on a dreary Monday morning, so 
there is got to be something in that.

But she also says that Cameron has a duty to respond to the claim that he knew 
about Ashcroft’s non-dom status earlier than he previously admitted.

Sir Simon Hughes, the former Lib Dem MP, is winding up for those backing 
amendment one (ie, those in favour of a scaled-back nuclear deterrent). The 
current party policy was formed on the basis of evidence in the last 
parliament, he says. And it commits the party to work towards the elimination 
of nuclear weapons. And it commits Lib Dem MPs to voting against like-for-like
Trident <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> replacement.

Trident is a “sheathed weapon”, he says. That is better than having no weapon, 
he says.

Being in opposition should not be an excuse for casual policy making, he says.
 
Shirley Williams, the former Lib Dem leader in the Lords, is now speaking in 
theTrident <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> debate as it nears its end.

She says the world is on the edge of removing some nuclear threats; for 
example, Iran scaled back its nuclear programme in response to international 
pressure.

She says the leadership amendment (amendment one) will help Britain to lead 
internationally on this issue.
 
The Lib Dems have been debating a motion proposing scrapping Trident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>.

If it goes through - as it looks as though it may well do - it will be a blow 
toTim Farron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tim-farron> and the party 
leadership, which is backing an amendment defending existing party policy. 
Current policy is to oppose like-for-like replacement of Trident, but to 
support a cheaper nuclear alternative.

The motion would commit the party to full unilateralism.

We’ll get the vote very shortly.

Here is some comment on the debate.

Any Labour people tempted by the LibDems should watch this Trident debate. 
It's basically kinder, gentler Corbynism versus fudge and mudge.

Bad news for David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron>
. Following the publication of this biography,Lord Ashcroft may publish another 
potentially damaging memoir, he has hinted.

On his Twitter feed, Ashcroft has just posted a link to the full preface from 
his book.
Lord Ashcroft (@LordAshcroft) 
Full preface to my book on the PM, Call Me Dave, written with @IsabelOakeshott 
<https://twitter.com/IsabelOakeshott>. Hopefully it explains a great deal

Much of it appears in his article in today’s Mail. But the Mail left out this 
revelation. (Bold type inserted by me.)

Despite the disappointments I have described [no getting a government job], I 
want to be clear about my motivation for writing this book, which – however 
sorry I remain about what happened – is not about settling scores. I do not 
feature in the narrative at all, because I wanted to tell Cameron’s life story, 
not mine.My role in the party while he was Leader of the Opposition will be 
kept for another day.

He also reveals that he is already planning the second edition of Call Me Dave.

[Cameron] remained suspicious, and those around him were discouraged from 
speaking to us during our research.

Happily, a number of individuals close to him have helped, some only on 
condition of anonymity. Their input has been enormously valuable and it is a 
pity they cannot be thanked here. They know who they are.Perhaps when we come 
to update this book, as we intend, Cameron will have no fear.An overall 
majority is a wonderful achievement, however slim the margin. He has much of 
which to be proud.

That “have no fear” line is priceless, dripping with irony and menace.

O’Grady, the TUC general secretary,Nick Clegg has warned against a “scorched 
earth” approach towards the European Union and complained about the attitude of

Just just because the Tory isolationists want to do that, the left, the centre

for five years now – parts of the left working themselves up into an absolute

movement cascade into something a whole lot worse. It could lead to an exit 
from the European Union and to profound damage to the life chances of many 
millions of working people in this country for many years to come. I just don’t 
think we should have any truck with it at all.


Clegg said that disaffected people may be tempted to deliver a “collective 
kick in the shins” to the Conservative government and that the unions should be 
clear about the benefits the EU brings to workers and not get wrapped up in 
debates about Cameron’s renegotiations. “I personally think that having an 
angry debate about renegotiation, in terms of tactics, is an odd place to 
start,” he said.
