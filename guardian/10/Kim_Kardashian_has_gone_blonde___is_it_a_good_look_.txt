Today we learned that Paris is all about hair. Famous people and their famous 
hair. First came the designer Rick Owens’ invite – leathery, hairy, a bit weird 
– turning our Instagram feeds into a virtual barber’s floor, and now this, from 
Kim Kardashian, who cast off her wallflower shackles and arrived at the Balmain 
show with newly blond hair.

It’s not the first time she has attempted to derail fashion week – in New 
York, she dressed baby North West in a bulletproof vest on the Frow, for the 
love of God. But back to the hair, which she paired with a black velvet Balmain 
dress and opaque tights. A straw poll reveals a mixed verdict (read: defiantly 
opposed) although, credit to Kardashian, she could pull off a toga so we’ll let 
this look settle before we decide.
