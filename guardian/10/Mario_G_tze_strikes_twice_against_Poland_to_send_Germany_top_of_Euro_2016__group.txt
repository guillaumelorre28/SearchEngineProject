Thomas Müller put the hosts in front after 12 minutes and Götze added a second 
with a fine solo effort seven minutes later before a third Bayern Munich 
player, the Poland captain Robert Lewandowski, cut the deficit with a diving 
header from Kamil Grosicki’s superb left-wing cross.

Götze, struggling for first team action in the Bundesliga over the past two 
seasons, sealed Germany’s win eight minutes from time on the rebound.

Both teams had plenty more chances in a flowing, attacking game but Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany>, who had lost 2-0 in Warsaw last 
year, proved more efficient and took over at the top of Group D on 16 points 
from seven games, two ahead of Poland.

Germany next play Scotland, who lost 1-0 away to Georgia earlier on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/04/georgia-scotland-euro-2016-qualifying-match-report>
, in Glasgow on Monday.
