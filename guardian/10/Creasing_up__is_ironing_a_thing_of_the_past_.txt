Good news for domestic dissenters: ironing has become unfashionable. An odd 
move, perhaps, for an industry that celebrates “looking great” but all the 
same, it’s happening. In womenswear, Céline showed peplumed tops with built-in, 
boxfresh creases for next season. Hip newish label Vetements’ current 
collection is consciously creased. In menswear, Italian brandPoeme Bohemien 
<http://www.daad-dantone.com/fashion-brand/boutique/Poeme-Bohemien-129> do a 
great line in crumpled cotton tops and Marques Almeida’s denim generally 
appears to be un-pressed, as well as frayed at the hems. Pretty Danish teenage 
indie group, Liss, seem to have cultivated a very specific look that is part 
ultra-normcore and part crumpled tees. Then there’s the 2016 Pirelli calendar 
(featuring clothed women!), a hotbed of creases – see Patti Smith and visual 
artist, Shirin Neshat. High-achieving women making crumpled shirts cool.

Wearing creased clothes isn’t always a choice; that it’s become “a thing” is 
merely fashion-enabled laziness. This move away from ironing isn’t for everyone.

Tools, or lack thereof, are often the issue. Half of my (mixed gender) 
colleagues don’t own an ironing board, some choosing to improvise on laminate 
flooring, on a tea towel or with straightners. GHD straightening, a relatively 
new phenomonen, is on the up. Observer columnist Eva Wiseman uses her 
straightners to iron “sleeves” and “baby clothes” and only owns “a sort of 
travel half-sized ironing board”. Guardian fashion stylist, Melanie Wilkinson, 
doesn’t iron either although she occasionally uses a kettle to steam creases 
away, a natty trick she picked up on shoots. The rest of us are a creased 
mess/bang on trend, depending where you stand.

Jeffrey Goltis, managing director of Savile Rowe, whose suits’ success banks 
on being perfectly pressed, is horrified: “I do understand the casual look – 
that distressed, crumpled fabric appearance – but I don’t see this as a trend 
that will take on. To me, creased clothing suggests laziness. Really, the 
technology today means there’s no need to wear anything crumpled. Eight out of 
10 of the shirts we sell are virtually non-iron. They’re cotton, and go through 
a pre-curing and dipping process. There isn’t really a reason to wear anything 
creased – it’s also far more flattering.”

For etiquette expert William Hanson, he thinks the problem is that “people 
aren’t taught to iron. Or they buy a cheap iron and a cheap ironing board which 
aren’t that effective.” Coming from a man who occasionally irons his underwear 
and once refused to sleep in a bed with un-ironed sheets, Hanson maintains 
ironing “improves your appearance by 100%. The fact that it’s waning is a 
pandemic issue.”


There is a certain superiority that goes alongside wearing creased clothes. 
It’s the power humblebrag of fashion – you are too busy to iron, or your mind 
is on other less-aesthetic matters such as opera or world peace. Plus, 
perspiration is nature’s own iron – wear a creased shirt to work and within a 
few hours, it will be less creased.

Maybe it’s less about trends and more about not having the time to. 
Statistically, we arestill ironing, although nowadays many of us are 
outsourcing it. Prince Charles allegedly gets his shoelaces irons because, 
presumably, he has the time and the staff.Handy <https://www.handy.com/> is a 
London-based high-end cleaning company that also deals with ironing. Since last 
year, requests for ironing have doubled, mostly among thirty- and 
fortysomething women with families: “Anecdotally,” explains Yvonne Manomano, 
cleaning operations manager, “among younger customers, there is still a sense 
that ironing is a soul-destroying chore.”

This tallies with an increased demand for non-iron clothing. Ten years ago, 
Thomas Pink launched its Traveller shirt, which doesn’t need ironing. In the 
past three months, sales have gone up by 30%. The success of athleisure – 
leisurewear that you can wear to the pub or even work – could be rooted in the 
fact that it doesn’t need serious ironing. Ironing isn’t compulsory with 
Angora, cashmere and wool-mix (seeRaey’s current collection 
<http://www.matchesfashion.com/products/Raey-Oversized-roll-neck-cashmere-sweater-1032068>
 at Matches).

So Céline <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/celine> aside, why is it 
happening? “I don’t think it’s gender-specific. It’s more that people are too 
busy on Facebook or Netflix to bother,” explains Hanson. “That said, a lot of 
womenswear is now dry-clean only or trickier to iron. People also don’t make or 
have the time to do it.” He adds: “It depends on what sort of image you want to 
show. Personally, I think messy clothes equal messy mind.”
