<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> play-offs after they lost 1-0 
at home to Spain despite the reigning champions fielding a second-string side 
in their final Group C qualifying match.

Slovakia’s result in Luxembourg to earn an automatic berth at the tournament in 
France next year but their fellow Eastern Europeans secured a 4-2 win to make 
sure of second place.

With Spain <https://www.theguardian.com/football/spain> already assured of top 
spot, Vicente del Bosque fielded an experimental team at Kiev’s Olympic 
Stadium, scene of Spain’s 4-0 triumph against Italy in the final of Euro 2012.

The full-back Mario Gaspar scored with a header on his debut to put Spain 
ahead in the 22nd minute and Cesc Fàbregas, captaining the side on his 100th 
international appearance, won a penalty moments later but had his effort saved 
by the Ukraine goalkeeper, Andriy Pyatov.

Spain’s eighth qualifying win in a row put them on 27 points from 10 matches 
and, for the first time, they have gone eight competitive matches without 
conceding. Slovakia have 22 points and Ukraine 19, eight ahead of fourth-placed 
Belarus.

Ukraine had a number of chances in the early stages and David de Gea, 
deputising for Iker Casillas in goal, made two brilliant saves to deny Artem 
Kravets and Ruslan Rotan after 15 minutes.

Spain made the breakthrough when Nolito sent Thiago Alcântara clear and his 
perfect cross to the far post was headed in by Gaspar with Pyatov stranded.

Nolito played Fàbregas in just after the restart and he was felled by 
Oleksandr Kucher but Pyatov flung out an arm to send the midfielder’s spot kick 
over the bar.

Fàbregas, the 10th player to reach 100 caps for Spain and the second-youngest 
after Sergio Ramos, has missed all four of his penalties for Spain, excluding 
shootouts.

Ukraine went close to an equaliser when Andriy Yarmolenko struck a shot 
against the frame of the goal in the 51st minute before Paco Alcácer was denied 
by another fine Pyatov save.

“It is a pity we did not take our chances,” the Ukraine coach, Mykhailo 
Fomenko, said. “We had plenty of opportunities but their goalkeeper was 
brilliant tonight.”
