First lady Michelle Obama channeled another powerful political woman on 
Tuesday night when she appeared at theState of the Union address 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-the-union-address> in a gray 
Michael Kors suit.

Eagle-eye television fans spotted the wide-collared tweed jacket as one 
sported last season by Julianna Margulies’s character Alicia Florrick on the 
CBS drama The Good Wife. Like the first lady, Florrick is a lawyer and the wife 
of a powerful figure in Chicago politics – the governor of Illinois.

ABC reported 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michelle-obama-sports-outfit-previously-worn-good-wife/story?id=28361170>
 that the Kors top, called the Origami Collar Tweed Jacket, retails for just 
under $800. The first lady has worn Michael Kors designs several times before. 
Her 2012 election night victory dress was a Kors designshe’d worn at least 
twice before <http://

.

The first lady’s outfit was almost overshadowed by the president’s attire. 
Just before 8pm ET, senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer teased his audience 
with a variation of Obama’s 2008 campaign slogan and a picture of a tan suit. 
Speculation raged on Twitter that the president would be wearing the suit he
famously

 wore atnews conference in August 
<http://www.latimes.com/fashion/alltherage/la-ig-obama-tan-suit-stop-freaking-out-20140828-story.html>
.

Instead, the president appeared before Congress on Tuesday wearing a dark 
suit, white shirt and blue tie.

Pfeiffer chastised the media industry for its immediate response to his 
Tuesday night Tweet <https://twitter.com/pfeiffer44/status/557712013200461825>: 
“Everyone visit the Obama library years from now, pull all the reporter emails 
on the tan suit tweet and then decide whether to laugh or cry.”

Republican senator Joni Ernst, of Iowa, wore camouflage-print heels 
<https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/557710348028235777> before her 
rebuttal speech. Ernst is the only female combat veteran to serve in the US 
Senate and her speech is expected to criticize Obama’s military actions.


Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wore a bright red coat and printed scarf, 
accessorized with a copy of the New York Times.
