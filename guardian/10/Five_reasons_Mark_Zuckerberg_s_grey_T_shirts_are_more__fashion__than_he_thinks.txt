1 High-minded disdain for the silly and frivolous would make a whole lot more 
sense if Zuckerberg was, say, running to the lab to work on a cure for Ebola. 
The sentiment is somewhat undermined when you recall that Zuckerberg’s key 
contribution to human progress is filling the internet with generic sunrise 
photos and updates on how your mum’s friend’s daughter is getting on 
potty-training her twins.

2 Mark Zuckerberg hasn’t always worn grey T-shirts, actually. Older pictures 
<http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/facebook-cover-2007.jpg> show him wearing 
hoodies, faded colourful sweatshirts and sometimes those awful thick-knitted 
bloke-sweaters with a half-zip that always reveals a clashing T-shirt. I am 
actually quite pleased Zuckerberg switched to wearing a grey T-shirt every day, 
as he has zero dress sense, which I guess he figured out at some point. I just 
don’t see why he has to be so smug about it.

3 Also, major eye roll at Zuckerberg thinking he landed on the grey T-shirt 
idea without being influenced by fashion.Grey is the most zeitgeisty shade of 
our era <> and that’s why Zuckerberg has landed on it, even if he doesn’t 
realise it. If I may quote Miranda Priestley in The Devil Wears Prada, 
explaining Anne Hathaway’s blue sweater back to her: “You’re trying to tell the 
world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your 
back [yet] that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and it’s 
sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from 
the fashion industry when, in fact, you’re wearing the sweater that was 
selected for you by the people in this room.”

4 Grey marl is a sartorial humblebrag. It’s everyman and yet classy at the 
same time. (For instance, if you are in a posh hotel gym, the proportion of 
grey marl T-shirts will be much higher than in a municipal leisure centre. 
Fact.) Note that when Zuckerberg talks about other men who wear the same 
clothes every day, the comparisons he draws are Steve Jobs and President Obama. 
An ego like that has no need of bling.

5 Zuckerberg did not invent the non-suit uniform. It’s been a staple of the 
fashion mogul for decades: seeGiorgio Armani in his navy crew-necks

, orMichael Kors in his boaty blazers

Wearing the same thing every day is an essential part of brand-building. 
Zuckerberg’s grey marl T-shirt sends a message that Facebook is for the 
cereal-eating good-guy enjoying well-earned downtime. He’s playing the game. 
Why pretend any different?
