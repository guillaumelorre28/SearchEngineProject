My student loan for September was sent to the wrong account number. The 
Student Loan Company (SLC) told me it would take up to 30 working days to 
retrieve it and it would make a manual payment if it exceeded that time. I’m 
now informed there’s no time frame, no chance of an interim payment and that I 
must sort it out with my bank, Santander. It says it can’t help. I have no 
other source of income and the stress is affecting my course work. DQ,

You say that you have not changed your account details since your last 
successful payment. SLC insists that it used the data on your online 
application, so any typos were down to you. “Once SLC was made aware of the 
issue, we asked the customer’s bank to trace the funds and we have chased this 
on a number of occasions,” it says. “SLC has no power to recover the payment.”

It’s remarkable how speedily an impasse dissolves when press offices get 
involved. Santander has finally discovered who received your money and got them 
to return it so you have now, finally, received your loan.
