The City regulator’s plan to set a 2018 deadline for payment protection 
insurance claims is “ill-judged” and would set a dangerous precedent, according 
to consumer bodyWhich? <http://www.which.co.uk/>

Last year the Financial Conduct Authority set out plans to impose a two-year 
time limit on PPI claims

, drawing a line under the financial industry’s costliest mis-selling scandal.


By the end of 2015 the total amount set aside by the big five banks for PPI 
compensation had reached £32bn, with more than £3bn paid out to customers last 
year alone, prompting Which? to claim that the scandal “is far from over”.

The FCA said it would run an advertising campaign to encourage customers to 
bring forward any remaining claims.


But Which? said a two-year time limit would “result in banks having little 
incentive to pay out compensation swiftly and directly to consumers in any 
future mis-selling scandals”.

The consumer body added: “It is clear that banks should do more to make their 
processes for handling PPI complaints simpler and fairer.”


The consumer body said that before the FCA goes ahead with any proposals for a 
time limit, it should bring in a simpler process for making a claim, with banks 
required to accept complaints electronically. It should also tighten up the 
regulation of claims management companies, making directors personally 
accountable if firms break the rules relating to nuisance calls.

The FCA also called for the publication of more information about how firms 
have handled claims to date, the amount of redress outstanding, and how the FCA 
will judge the time limit to be a success.
