target, 5 January

) that the United Arab Emirates has met the UN commitment of spending 0.7% of 
gross national income since 2013. The most recent OECD report, quoted in your 
article, shows that the UAE contributed 1.09% of GNI towards overseas aid in 
2015, making it second only to Sweden in terms of aid spending as a proportion 
of GNI. The UAE shares the UK’s commitment to overseas aid.

• It’s not often jazz hits the headlines. What a pity that when it does it 
displays ignorance of the genre (If every player plays like a jazz musician, 
it’ll be chaos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/03/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-manager-football-interview>
, 4 January). Pep Guardiola may not like jazz, but he should be aware that it 
is a highly disciplined music which demands complex musical skills and team 
spirit. That’s why Ray Charles liked to choose jazz musicians for his tour 
bands and why many classical performers I know envy the improvisational skills 
of jazzers – which I would have thought football managers would encourage in 
their players.

• In light of the revelation of interference in the US presidential vote by 
Russia (Report, 5 January

• A singer friend says that when performing to an audience of one, that person
