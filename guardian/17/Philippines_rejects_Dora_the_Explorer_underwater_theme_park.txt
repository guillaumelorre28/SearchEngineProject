The Philippine environment minister has said the US children’s television 
network Nickelodeon will not be allowed to build an underwater theme park on 
one of the country’s most pristine islands.

Nickelodeon’s parent firm announced on Monday it would build a themed 
attraction inspired by its cartoon characters such as Dora the Explorer and 
SpongeBob SquarePants as part of a 400-hectare (1,000-acre) development on 
Palawan, generating alarm from environmentalists.

The environment secretary, Gina Lopez, said on Wednesday she would reject the 
project.

“Lopez says she won’t allow the underwater theme park in Palawan,” the 
environment department tweeted.

In an interview with ABS-CBN television, Lopez said she would not allow any 
project that would damage the environment and the welfare of local communities.

“That’s our wealth. It’s not allowed. You can’t kill the corals. For a theme 
park? No. No way, man,” said Lopez, who has been a vocal opponent of mining 
projects in Palawan.

“The commitment of the government is first and foremost and always, always to 
the benefit of our people.”

Conservation <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation> groups 
call Palawan the country’s “last ecological frontier” because of its relatively 
untouched coastlines and forests, which are among the oldest and most diverse 
in south-east Asia.

Palawan is home to two Unesco world heritage-listed sites, a subterranean 
river and the Tubbataha coral reefs.

Monday’s statement by Nickelodeon’s parent firm, Viacom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/viacom> International Media Networks, said 
its resort would open in 2020 and feature restaurants and lounges six metres 
(20ft) below sea level.

It also said the Palawan project would “take its place alongside” other 
Nickelodeon-branded attractions such as Wet’n’Wild in Australia, Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles Land in Russia and IMG Worlds of Legends theme park in Dubai.

An online petition organised by local environmentalists calling for the 
project to be stopped attracted more than 125,000 signatures in less than 24 
hours.

Viacom’s Philippine partner, Coral World Park, issued a statement on Wednesday 
insisting the development was not a theme park and emphasised that it would not 
all be underwater.

The statement also highlighted the project’s “ocean conservation focus” and 
said it would help fund environmental protection in the area.

It referred to plans for a marine sanctuary and said the Coral World Park 
would “be the largest coral reef conservation program in Asia”.

“There has never been any form of communication from our side mentioning a 
theme park,” said Susan Lee, Coral World Park’s marketing and communications 
director.
