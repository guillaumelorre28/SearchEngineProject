Life Saving Victoria’s general manager, Paul Shannon, said Monday was much 
cooler than Christmas Day, with fewer people at beaches, and the closure was 
the only major event of the morning.

The premier, Daniel Andrews, told reporters on Monday he had talked with 
emergency management commissioner Craig Lapsley, who was working with Life 
Saving Victoria and monitoring the shark sightings. “Obviously this is not 
something we’ve had to deal with all that often,” Andrews said.

Shannon told radio 3AW on Monday morning there were more sightings at the 
beaches than expected for this time of year. But he said patrols had been 
stepped up on Christmas Day owing to increased numbers of swimmers in the 
water, with temperatures in Victoria reaching 41C.

, driving people to the water.

“When there is greater surveillance, there’s always going to be great 
reporting,” Shannon said.
