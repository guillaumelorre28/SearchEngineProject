 Levanter 
Absolutely, Ramsbottom is a real foodie destination. Levanter 
<http://www.levanterfinefoods.co.uk/>’s tapas, such as oxtail braised in rioja, 
are so good it is listed in the Michelin guide, while sister venue Baratxuri is 
an excellent Basque-style pintxo bar. TheEagle and Child 
<http://eagle-and-child.com/> has proper pub grub, including cheese and onion 
pie with homemade baked beans. TheHearth of the Ram 
<http://www.hearthoftheram.com/> is a posher affair: rabbit and black pudding 
pithivier followed by Goosnargh guinea fowl, perhaps.

How about a drink?
