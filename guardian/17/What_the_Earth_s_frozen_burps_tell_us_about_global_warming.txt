“When the earth burps, Law Dome records it,” says Australian climate scientist 
Dr David Etheridge.


Law Dome is a special spot in eastern Antarctica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica> where scientists have been 
drilling down into the continent’s long-frozen surface to pull out cores of ice.

Trapped in the ice cores are bubbles that give a record of the composition of 
the Earth’s atmosphere going back tens of thousands of years.

New analysis of those bubbles by a group of Australian, British and Italian 
scientists could have just given an answer to a crucial question.

As the Earth gets warmer, how will the planet’s soils and plants react? Will 
they start to “burp” too much CO2 and, if so, how much?

Answering this question is crucial as scientists try and work out just how 
much more greenhouse gases humans can afford to emit while still keeping to 
temperature targets agreed at the Paris climate talks last year.

The new ice core analysis, published in the journal Nature Geoscience 
<http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2769.html>, suggests 
the news is less than encouraging.

The research finds that for every 1C of warming, the Earth’s plants and soils 
– the “terrestrial biosphere” – will add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere to 
the tune of about 20 parts per million.Levels in the atmosphere continue to 
climb

.

But to arrive at this number, the scientific team went back to analyse bubbles 
trapped in the ice during the Little Ice Age (LIA) – a period which started 
around the year 1500 and lasted for about 250 years.

The ice cores used in the study were drilled from the late 1980s to the mid 
2000s and are stored near CSIRO’s Aspendale lab in Victoria and at the 
Australian Antarctic Division in Tasmania. The study also used data from ice 
cores drilled by the British Antarctic Survey 20 years ago.

Etheridge, a principal research scientist at CSIRO and co-author of the new 
research, has been to Antarctica seven times and is a veteran of ice core 
drilling programs.

Working temperatures for scientists at Law Dome can range from a balmy minus 
5C (Etheridge claims T-shirts are worn. I don’t believe him) to a blustery -20C 
to a clear but frigid 50 degrees below freezing (that’s -58F).

Little Ice Age 

During the LIA, temperatures globally cooled by a half degree Celsius or so 
and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dropped.

Etheridge says: “Before the industrial revolution there were changes in the 
global temperature and we have observations of that from the ice cores. This 
Little Ice Age was a natural event triggered probably by volcanoes going off 
and a slightly weaker sun.”

Scientists have known that atmospheric CO2 dropped during the LIA, but were 
not sure why.

One theory was that as pandemics swept through the Americas and Europe, this 
reduced the amount of farming activity. In turn, the regrowth sucked more CO2 
back into soils and plants.

But by analysing another compound trapped in ice cores – carbonyl sulfide – 
the scientists were able to show it was the falling temperatures, rather than 
the regrowth of plants, that caused the terrestrial biosphere to suck up more 
CO2 (and in turn, cut atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide).

If this were to operate at this level in the future it would significantly 
reduce the available carbon budget

On the flip side, this now means that as the planet warms, the Earth’s plants 
and soils will likely store less carbon and help push up CO2 levels in the 
atmosphere.

Essentially, Etheridge and his colleagues have found that the Earth’s 
terrestrial biosphere acts as a “positive feedback” in the climate system as 
global warming continues.

“More warming, leads to more CO2 from the terrestrial biosphere, which leads 
to more warming,” says Etheridge.

Etheridge explained there was some good and bad news from the study. 

The good news was that the findings suggested that some of the worse 
predictions of a potential feedback from plants and soils were probably now 
ruled out. “We now have a number to work with,” he said.

But the bad news was that the “positive feedback” was now confirmed, ruling 
out other studies that had predicted lower amounts of CO2 being released from 
the terrestrial biosphere, or not released at all.

Carbon cycle

This flow of carbon between the Earth’s atmosphere and its plants and soils is 
a vital issue for scientists to understand.

Scientists have started to set “budgets” for the amount of carbon dioxide that 
can be released by humans while still have a shot at keeping warming well below 
2C.

If the terrestrial biosphere adds more CO2 to the system than models 
anticipate, then this could mean governments around the world have less in that 
carbon budget than they thought.

Climate scientist Dr Bill Hare, founder of the respected group Climate 
Analytics, has been a key adviser to governments and the United Nations on 
carbon budgets.

I asked him for his view on the Nature Geoscience paper 
<http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2769.html>, which he 
described as “elegant” (I’ve found this is a word scientists often use when 
they’re mightily impressed with someone else’s work).

Hare said: “The paper shows a significant positive feedback from warming on 
the terrestrial carbon cycle. If this were to operate at this level in the 
future it would significantly reduce the available carbon budget for fossil 
fuel CO2 emissions, compared to present mid range estimates.”

Hare said the findings would “tend to push the budgets towards the lower range 
of the estimates available at present”.

“If there is a positive feedback as the authors calculate, this would only add 
to the urgency of reducing emissions as rapidly as possible in order to 
minimise that feedback and to minimise the impact on the remaining carbon 
budget.”

Roughly translated, all of this means that ice bubbles from the frigid 
Antarctic have just made the job of cutting fossil fuel emissions even more 
urgent.
