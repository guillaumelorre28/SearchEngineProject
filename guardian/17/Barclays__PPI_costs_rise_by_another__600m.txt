Barclays <https://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay> took another £600m hit 
to pay compensation to customers who were mis-sold the product.

The extra provision, announced as the bank reported a 10% fall in nine-month 
profits, takes Barclays’ costs to £8.4bn.

Barclays <https://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay> said its extra 
provision was caused by the cutoff point of June 2019 for claims, set by the 
Financial Conduct Authority. It added: “We will continue to review the adequacy 
of the provision levels in respect of the FCA’s proposals, which remain subject 
to consultation.”


In the midst of an overhaul being led by chief executive Jes Staley, the bank 
insisted it was “open for business” after the Brexit vote. But Staley admitted 
he was considering what changes it might need to make to its business as the UK 
made plans to leave the EU.

Staley said: “We are looking at our options. We will take incremental steps. 
We are engaged in active discussions with the British government. Our desire is 
to stay as fully invested in the UK as we can.”

This week, the Observer reported 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/22/leading-banks-set-to-pull-out-of-brexit-uk>
 a warning from Anthony Browne, the chief executive of the British Bankers 
Association, that bosses had their hands “quivering over the relocate button”. 
Staley said while Barclays was looking at its options, “I wouldn’t say our 
finger is quivering. Our intention is to stay as much invested in London as we 
can. We are a British bank.”

In July, Staley said operations might need to be strengthened in Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/barclays-profits-fall-21-percent-amid-restructuring-ppi-africa>
 if the government did not clinch a passport deal that gave access to the 
remaining 27 EU countries.

The bank’s shares were the biggest risers in the FTSE 100, despite the extra 
charge for PPI and the £150m hit to cover costs incurred in reducing office 
space because of job cuts. The bank would not disclose which office was 
affected, but it has been reported that it has been in talks about leasing 
space in Canary Wharf to the government.

The shares closed 4.5% higher, at 190p, after the bank reported that its 
profits fell to £2.9bn in the nine months to September, triggered by a loss in 
the non-core division that houses the operations Staley has earmarked for sale 
or closure.

Staley  joined Barclays in December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/barclays-appoints-jes-staley-new-chief-executive>
 and set aboutselling off the bank’s operations in Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/26/barclays-plans-sell-off-of-african-operations>
. He said: “The growing momentum in attaining our strategic goals means we can 
feel optimistic of our prospects of completing the restructuring of Barclays – 
a restructuring to a simplified, transatlantic, consumer, corporate and 
investment bank with the capacity to deliver sustainable, high-quality returns 
for shareholders. This quarter has seen us take another important stride toward 
that state.”

The vote to leave the EU had been a political shock, Staley said, but 
consumers had recovered swiftly.

“The referendum was a political shock, not an economic shock. I think 
consumers have recovered from that, but there has been an impact in the 
currency, which directly impacts the consumer,” said Staley.



Barclays said it remained in discussions with the US Department of Justice 
over a settlement related to mortgage bond mis-selling.
