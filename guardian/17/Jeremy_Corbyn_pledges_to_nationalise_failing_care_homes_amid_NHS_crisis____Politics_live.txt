Jeremy Corbyn's speech and Fabian conference - Summary and analysis

Here are the main points from the Fabian conference so far.


 * Jeremy Corbyn has announced that Labour would take care homes that are 
going bust into public ownership to protect residents.  
<http://nursing%20homes%20into%20public%20ownership%20to%20protect%20the%20welfare%20of%20residents%2C/>
He made the announcement in a keynote speech to the Fabian Society conference 
in which he said Labour was committed to giving social care “the funding it 
needs”. His speech did not say how much this proposals might cost, or how it 
might be funded. (I’ve asked his press officers about this, but so far have not 
had any reply. I will update later if I get one.) Corbyn’s speech came asSarah 
Wollaston, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons health committee, floated 
the idea of raising national insurance by 1% to fund social care. (See10.14am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-5879f801e4b0f10ba20b8253#block-5879f801e4b0f10ba20b8253>
UPDATE: Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> sources are 
saying that the proposal to take failing care homes into public ownership could 
be “effectively self-financing”. Some care homes are already paid by the state 
to lease buildings, and in those cases payments could just continue, a source 
indicated. In other cases, where care firms own property outright, the 
buildings could be purchased using money set aside for capital spending. This 
would be cheaper than building a new home from scratch, the source said. But he 
also said Labour’s current demand was for the government to find money for the 
system now by cancelling planned corporation tax cuts and other tax cuts for 
the rich.

 * Corbyn has accused Theresa May of being “in denial” about conditions in the 
NHS. She should listen to real doctors not spin doctors, he said. He was 
responding to the news thatDowning Street appears to be partially blaming some 
GPs for problems affecting A&E services 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/13/theresa-may-nhs-crisis-doctor-surgeries>
. (See11.05am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-587a0550e4b0f10ba20b8297#block-587a0550e4b0f10ba20b8297>
 * Corbyn has said that Labour would offer “a complete break with this rigged 
system”. (See 8.46am.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-5879ca81e4b0c0afac920be6#block-5879ca81e4b0c0afac920be6>
His speech used the word “rigged” in relation to the system, the economy or 
rules etc ten times and it confirms that he is determined to portray himself as 
an anti-establishment insurgent. According to briefing from his team Corbyn 
wants to learn some lessons from Donald Trump’s electoral success and this was 
perhaps evident in the speech where Corbyn made a virtue of taunting one of the 
newspapers hostile to him, the Daily Telegraph. (See10.42am.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-587a0059e4b0c0afac920c99#block-587a0059e4b0c0afac920c99>
The speech was one of the most polished and well-crafted he has delivered as 
Labour leader, something being attributed to the influence of his new 
speechwriter, the former deputy prime minister’s son David Prescott.

Corbyn argued that people voted for Brexit because they felt they were being 
ignored. (See 10.47am.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-587a0186e4b0710de27b9839#block-587a0186e4b0710de27b9839>
Theresa May makes almost exactly the same argument. Ironically on this point 
May agrees with Corbyn but not her chancellor, Philip Hammond, who uses an 
interview with this week’s Economist to say that he does not accept the May 
(and Corbyn) analysis. Here’s an extract from the Economist’s Bagehot column. 
<http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21714349-chancellor-convinced-its-liberal-model-can-survive-brexit-philip-hammond-discusses>
In a speech on January 8th [May] argued that the Brexit vote was about much 
more than EU membership: it was a rejection of “laissez-faire liberalism”. Mr 
Hammond recognises no such crux: “Where’s the evidence for the assertion that 
the Brexit vote was saying something about this or that or the other? It was 
saying something about Britain’s membership of the European Union.”

 * Corbyn said that, if he became prime minister, dealing with the housing 
crisis would be his top priority. During the Q&A he revealed that he had said 
this during a visit to a primary schools. “And primary kids got it and 
applauded straight away,” he said. (See11.20am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-587a0912e4b0710de27b9855#block-587a0912e4b0710de27b9855>
 * Corbyn admitted that some small businesses would “struggle” to pay the 
increased minimum wage that Labour is proposing. But the party would take steps 
to address this, he said.Labour is committed to paying the minimum wage at a 
rate needed for a decent life, which it says would be more than £10 an hour in 
2020. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/26/john-mcdonnell-10-an-hour-living-wage-plan-labour-conference>
When it was put to him during the Q&A that some firms would struggle with this, 
he replied: 
You’re quite right. There are small businesses, small shops and others, that 
would initially struggle to pay the kind of living wage that we would all want 
in this room. We’re committed to the TUC figure of £10. So I think there has to 
be a combination of measures to get you into that position, one of which would 
be to reduce the levels of business rates and taxation on small enterprises and 
small businesses. But also use public procurement as a leverage towards it. So 
we are talking to the CBI, the Federation of Small Business and others about 
this.

 * Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, has been jeered by 
Labour members for defending his party’s decision to put up a candidate for the 
Copeland byelection only minutes after saying Labour and the Greens should form 
an electoral pact. In a panel session Bartley said that if progressive parties 
like Labour and the Greens cooperate, they could achieve “seismic change” at 
the election. 
Anyone who wants to stop progressive politics dying needs to actively support 
real democracy and proportional representation and the best route to that is 
through a progressive agreement of some sort. I know that any sort of 
progressive pact is not an easy concept for any of us, especially for people 
like you and me who spend hours banging on doors for a party that we all really 
believe in. But my plea to people in this room is actually quite simple. Let’s 
at least explore whether some form of joint working might better deliver us a 
progressive government in 2020 ...

When it happens, when we find agreement, when we work together, there can be 
seismic change. Just think back to 1997 when Martin Bell stood against Neil 
Hamilton in Tatton, a rock-solid safe Tory seat where Neil Hamilton had won 55% 
of the vote and the other parties withdrew. Martin Bell stood there and 
overturned that rock-solid majority, and overturned it very significantly. It’s 
not just marginal seats we could win. We could kick out safe Tory seats. We 
could have seismic change in this country if we were prepared to put aside our 
differences, maybe have open primaries, maybe stand aside for one another, 
maybe involve the community in selecting those candidates.

But it was put to him that the Greens are not adopting this spirit in the 
Copeland byelection where they have decided they will field a candidate, even 
though this could increase the chances of Labour losing its small majority. 
Members of the audience jeered at Bartley over this. He defended his party’s 
move, saying:

We have a system whereby the local party decides.

 * A group of Labour MPs has backed a pamphlet calling on the party to agree 
on a series of Brexit red lines, including only leaving the EU single market if 
it causes no economic damage, and defending rights over work and the 
environment. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/14/labour-mps-back-call-for-party-to-set-brexit-red-lines>
 As Peter Walker reports, the publication, produced jointly by the 
Labour-affiliated Fabian Society and the Brexit pressure group Open Britain, 
outlines six “principles for progressives” that the party could use to pressure 
the government over the process. 
That’s all from me for today.

I won’t be covering the afternoon sessions but there is some good coverage on 
the Fabians’ Twitter feed,@thefabians. <https://twitter.com/thefabians>

Thanks for the comments.

The Labour MP Rushanara Ali is speaking now in the “metropolitan elite” 
session. She saysLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> sometimes 
makes the mistake of appearing to take certain voters for granted, like working 
class voters and ethnic minority voters.

Even in the inner cities Labour can lose if it appears to take people for 
granted. She says she represents a seat, Bethnal Green and Bow, which was 
Labour for decades but which Labour lost to George Galloway’s Respect.

She also says she is unhappy about the phrase “metropolitan elite”. Using the 
phrase sounds like an attack on London, she says.

On immigration, she says she does not have all the answers. But she thinks 
that Labour must find proposals on immigration rooted in Labour values.

The party also needs to get better at producing ideas, she says. At the moment 
ideas are being generated by a narrow circle. The party should get better at 
using ideas from outside bodies, like the Fabian Society.

7.44am EST 07:44  <> 

There are now various break-out sessions taking place. I’ve come to the 
“metropolitan elite” one, addressing the question “IsLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> for the inner cities?”

Maria Eagle, the former shadow culture secretary, is speaking. She says, if 
Labour wants to form a government, it has to win seats in rural and suburban 
areas.

She says before the 2015 election Labour had three policy documents relating 
to rural areas. She was shadow environment secretary at the time. But she could 
not get the documents published early enough to ensure that people knew about 
them.

She says another problem is that Labour’s habit of focusing on key seats has 
led to it ignoring seats in rural areas. The party has not build up it 
relevance and visibility in places that are not key seats.

Labour’s Stella Creasy asks how many people in the audience watched the 
President Obama/Joe Biden “bromance” video clips. 
<http://www.npr.org/2017/01/12/509545778/in-surprise-send-off-president-obama-awards-biden-presidential-medal-of-freedom>
“That is what an echo chamber looks like,” she says.

She repeats the point about how quickly the world is changing. We need to 
prepare for a world in which people have seven jobs over the course of their 
career, two of which haven’t even been invented yet, she says.

Green co-leader jeered after calling for electoral pact then defending Greens' 
decision to stand in Copeland

Jonathan Bartley says Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> and 
other progressive parties could take “rock-solid Tory seats” if they were 
willing to form an electoral pact.

Members of the audience ask why the Greens are not standing aside in Copeland. 
Stella Creasy, the Labour MP, also challenges Bartley on this.

Bartley says the Greens have a system that allows local parties to decide 
whether or not to put up byelection candidates. That provokes jeers from the 
audience.

The Green party announced yesterday that it was putting up a candidate in 
Copeland, the byelection triggered by the resignation of the Labour MP Jamie 
Reed.

Here is Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, responding to Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

Again Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> have failed to make 
a commitment to fight to stay in the single market. They have failed to 
represent the views of the millions who voted to stay in Europe and instead 
opted to fall in line behind the Conservative Brexit government.

Jonathan Bartley, the Green co-leader, says he got into Green politics after 
confronting David Cameron during the 2010 general election. He was taking his 
child to a hospital appointment in a wheelchair. A Tory aide saw the wheelchair 
and asked if Cameron could pose for a picture beside Bartley’s child. Bartley 
agreed, and then challenged Cameron over inclusive education. The subject 
dominated the news for a day.

Here are the main points from the Fabian conference so far.


 * Jeremy Corbyn has announced that Labour would take care homes that are 
going bust into public ownership to protect residents.  
<http://nursing%20homes%20into%20public%20ownership%20to%20protect%20the%20welfare%20of%20residents%2C/>
He made the announcement in a keynote speech to the Fabian Society conference 
in which he said Labour was committed to giving social care “the funding it 
needs”. His speech did not say how much this proposals might cost, or how it 
might be funded. (I’ve asked his press officers about this, but so far have not 
had any reply. I will update later if I get one.) Corbyn’s speech came asSarah 
Wollaston, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons health committee, floated 
the idea of raising national insurance by 1% to fund social care. (See10.14am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-5879f801e4b0f10ba20b8253#block-5879f801e4b0f10ba20b8253>
UPDATE: Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> sources are 
saying that the proposal to take failing care homes into public ownership could 
be “effectively self-financing”. Some care homes are already paid by the state 
to lease buildings, and in those cases payments could just continue, a source 
indicated. In other cases, where care firms own property outright, the 
buildings could be purchased using money set aside for capital spending. This 
would be cheaper than building a new home from scratch, the source said. But he 
also said Labour’s current demand was for the government to find money for the 
system now by cancelling planned corporation tax cuts and other tax cuts for 
the rich.

 * Corbyn has accused Theresa May of being “in denial” about conditions in the 
NHS. She should listen to real doctors not spin doctors, he said. He was 
responding to the news thatDowning Street appears to be partially blaming some 
GPs for problems affecting A&E services 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/13/theresa-may-nhs-crisis-doctor-surgeries>
. (See11.05am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-587a0550e4b0f10ba20b8297#block-587a0550e4b0f10ba20b8297>
 * Corbyn has said that Labour would offer “a complete break with this rigged 
system”. (See 8.46am.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-5879ca81e4b0c0afac920be6#block-5879ca81e4b0c0afac920be6>
His speech used the word “rigged” in relation to the system, the economy or 
rules etc ten times and it confirms that he is determined to portray himself as 
an anti-establishment insurgent. According to briefing from his team Corbyn 
wants to learn some lessons from Donald Trump’s electoral success and this was 
perhaps evident in the speech where Corbyn made a virtue of taunting one of the 
newspapers hostile to him, the Daily Telegraph. (See10.42am.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-587a0059e4b0c0afac920c99#block-587a0059e4b0c0afac920c99>
The speech was one of the most polished and well-crafted he has delivered as 
Labour leader, something being attributed to the influence of his new 
speechwriter, the former deputy prime minister’s son David Prescott. 
<http://lincolnshirereporter.co.uk/2016/10/jeremy-corbyn-hires-former-lincolnshire-mp-candidate-as-his-new-speechwriter/>
Corbyn argued that people voted for Brexit because they felt they were being 
ignored. (See 10.47am.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-587a0186e4b0710de27b9839#block-587a0186e4b0710de27b9839>
Theresa May makes almost exactly the same argument. Ironically on this point 
May agrees with Corbyn but not her chancellor, Philip Hammond, who uses an 
interview with this week’s Economist to say that he does not accept the May 
(and Corbyn) analysis. Here’s an extract from the Economist’s Bagehot column. 
<http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21714349-chancellor-convinced-its-liberal-model-can-survive-brexit-philip-hammond-discusses>
In a speech on January 8th [May] argued that the Brexit vote was about much 
more than EU membership: it was a rejection of “laissez-faire liberalism”. Mr 
Hammond recognises no such crux: “Where’s the evidence for the assertion that 
the Brexit vote was saying something about this or that or the other? It was 
saying something about Britain’s membership of the European Union.”

 * Corbyn said that, if he became prime minister, dealing with the housing 
crisis would be his top priority. During the Q&A he revealed that he had said 
this during a visit to a primary schools. “And primary kids got it and 
applauded straight away,” he said. (See11.20am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/14/jeremy-corbyn-speech-fabian-society-promises-complete-break-with-this-rigged-system-in-speech-to-fabians-politics-live?page=with:block-587a0912e4b0710de27b9855#block-587a0912e4b0710de27b9855>
 * Corbyn admitted that some small businesses would “struggle” to pay the 
increased minimum wage that Labour is proposing. But the party would take steps 
to address this, he said.Labour is committed to paying the minimum wage at a 
rate needed for a decent life, which it says would be more than £10 an hour in 
2020. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/26/john-mcdonnell-10-an-hour-living-wage-plan-labour-conference>
When it was put to him during the Q&A that some firms would struggle with this, 
he replied: 
You’re quite right. There are small businesses, small shops and others, that 
would initially struggle to pay the kind of living wage that we would all want 
in this room. We’re committed to the TUC figure of £10. So I think there has to 
be a combination of measures to get you into that position, one of which would 
be to reduce the levels of business rates and taxation on small enterprises and 
small businesses. But also use public procurement as a leverage towards it. So 
we are talking to the CBI, the Federation of Small Business and others about 
this.

 * Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, has been jeered by 
Labour members for defending his party’s decision to put up a candidate for the 
Copeland byelection only minutes after saying Labour and the Greens should form 
an electoral pact. In a panel session Bartley said that if progressive parties 
like Labour and the Greens cooperate, they could achieve “seismic change” at 
the election. 
Anyone who wants to stop progressive politics dying needs to actively support 
real democracy and proportional representation and the best route to that is 
through a progressive agreement of some sort. I know that any sort of 
progressive pact is not an easy concept for any of us, especially for people 
like you and me who spend hours banging on doors for a party that we all really 
believe in. But my plea to people in this room is actually quite simple. Let’s 
at least explore whether some form of joint working might better deliver us a 
progressive government in 2020 ...

When it happens, when we find agreement, when we work together, there can be 
seismic change. Just think back to 1997 when Martin Bell stood against Neil 
Hamilton in Tatton, a rock-solid safe Tory seat where Neil Hamilton had won 55% 
of the vote and the other parties withdrew. Martin Bell stood there and 
overturned that rock-solid majority, and overturned it very significantly. It’s 
not just marginal seats we could win. We could kick out safe Tory seats. We 
could have seismic change in this country if we were prepared to put aside our 
differences, maybe have open primaries, maybe stand aside for one another, 
maybe involve the community in selecting those candidates.

But it was put to him that the Greens are not adopting this spirit in the 
Copeland byelection where they have decided they will field a candidate, even 
though this could increase the chances of Labour losing its small majority. 
Members of the audience jeered at Bartley over this. He defended his party’s 
move, saying:

We have a system whereby the local party decides.

 * A group of Labour MPs has backed a pamphlet calling on the party to agree 
on a series of Brexit red lines, including only leaving the EU single market if 
it causes no economic damage, and defending rights over work and the 
environment. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/14/labour-mps-back-call-for-party-to-set-brexit-red-lines>
 As Peter Walker reports, the publication, produced jointly by the 
Labour-affiliated Fabian Society and the Brexit pressure group Open Britain, 
outlines six “principles for progressives” that the party could use to pressure 
the government over the process. 
That’s all from me for today.

I won’t be covering the afternoon sessions but there is some good coverage on 
the Fabians’ Twitter feed,@thefabians. <https://twitter.com/thefabians>

The Labour MP Rushanara Ali is speaking now in the “metropolitan elite”

makes the mistake of appearing to take certain voters for granted, like working 
class voters and ethnic minority voters.

Even in the inner cities Labour can lose if it appears to take people for 
granted. She says she represents a seat, Bethnal Green and Bow, which was 
Labour for decades but which Labour lost to George Galloway’s Respect.

She also says she is unhappy about the phrase “metropolitan elite”. Using the 
phrase sounds like an attack on London, she says.

On immigration, she says she does not have all the answers. But she thinks 
that Labour must find proposals on immigration rooted in Labour values.

The party also needs to get better at producing ideas, she says. At the moment 
ideas are being generated by a narrow circle. The party should get better at 
using ideas from outside bodies, like the Fabian Society.
 
There are now various break-out sessions taking place. I’ve come to the 
“metropolitan elite” one, addressing the question “IsLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> for the inner cities?”

Maria Eagle, the former shadow culture secretary, is speaking. She says, if 
Labour wants to form a government, it has to win seats in rural and suburban 
areas.

She says before the 2015 election Labour had three policy documents relating 
to rural areas. She was shadow environment secretary at the time. But she could 
not get the documents published early enough to ensure that people knew about 
them.

She says another problem is that Labour’s habit of focusing on key seats has 
led to it ignoring seats in rural areas. The party has not build up it 
relevance and visibility in places that are not key seats.
 
Labour’s Stella Creasy asks how many people in the audience watched the 
President Obama/Joe Biden “bromance” video clips.

“That is what an echo chamber looks like,” she says.

She repeats the point about how quickly the world is changing. We need to 
prepare for a world in which people have seven jobs over the course of their 
career, two of which haven’t even been invented yet, she says.
 
Jonathan Bartley says Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> and 
other progressive parties could take “rock-solid Tory seats” if they were 
willing to form an electoral pact.

Members of the audience ask why the Greens are not standing aside in Copeland. 
Stella Creasy, the Labour MP, also challenges Bartley on this.

Bartley says the Greens have a system that allows local parties to decide 
whether or not to put up byelection candidates. That provokes jeers from the 
audience.

The Green party announced yesterday that it was putting up a candidate in 
Copeland, the byelection triggered by the resignation of the Labour MP Jamie 
Reed.

Here is Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, responding to Jeremy Corbyn’s speech.

Again Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> have failed to make 
a commitment to fight to stay in the single market. They have failed to 
represent the views of the millions who voted to stay in Europe and instead 
opted to fall in line behind the Conservative Brexit government.
 
Christian Wolmar, Labour’s candidate in the Richmond Park byelection, has been

Jonathan Bartley, the Green co-leader, says he got into Green politics after 
confronting David Cameron during the 2010 general election. He was taking his 
child to a hospital appointment in a wheelchair. A Tory aide saw the wheelchair 
and asked if Cameron could pose for a picture beside Bartley’s child. Bartley 
agreed, and then challenged Cameron over inclusive education. The subject 
dominated the news for a day.
