Key points

Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> used all 
six of his questions to attack the government on the crises in the NHS and 
social care. He accused Theresa May of being “in denial” about the scale of the 
health service’s problems, quoting the British Red Cross’s description of a 
“humanitarian crisis”. This drew a sharp response from the prime minister, who 
called the BRC’s intervention “irresponsible and overblown”. Corbyn pressed the 
attack, quoting a series of criticisms from various royal medical colleges and 
the example of Sian, an NHS worker who told of her frustration at a child not 
getting proper help. May said there had been a small number of incidents where 
unacceptable things took place. The exchange then moved to mental health and 
social care provision, where May spoke of improving practices so that fewer 
mental health patients ended up in A&E. Corbyn said May’s vision of a “sharing 
society” was, in practice, about sharing trollies in hospital corridors.

Snap verdict

Corbyn had the best of that exchange. May finished strongly, but her jibe 
about Labour making multiple pledges based on corporation tax savings could not 
dispel the impression that she had little or nothing to say about a crisis that 
goes well beyond routine opposition shroud-waving. TheNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> is traditionally a good subject for 
Labour but Corbyn was passionate and focused. He responded particularly well to 
May’s point about mental health and he sounded credible and convincing. May had 
her moments – her British Red Cross put-down will probably resonate with many – 
but generally she gave the impression of being a politician on the defensive, 
not someone taking charge.

Memorable lines

We’ve all seen humanitarian crises around the world. To use that description 
of aNHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> which last year saw 2.5 
million more people treated in A&E than six years ago is irresponsible and 
overblown.


May responds to the British Red Cross.

 Cancel the corporation tax cuts and spend the money where it’s needed on 
social care and in our hospitals.


Corbyn’s solution.
