That’s all for today. Katie Allen’s news story about the ECB is here, and 
being updated now:

ECB keeps interest rates at 0%

I’ll be back tomorrow, to cover a meeting of eurozone finance ministers. 
They’ll be considering Greece’s bailout, where Athens has been falling behind 
its targets. So it could be a lively event.

Thanks for reading and commenting. GW

FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga is concerned that Europe’s recovery is 
faltering.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the Eurozone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> is entangled in a losing battle 
with faltering growth while static inflation levels continue to question the 
ECB’s credibility.

Although Draghi also suggested that the economic recovery in Europe is likely 
to be dampened by the UK’s Brexit vote, this was still not enough to prompt the 
central bank to act. While Draghi’s dovish rhetoric may have opened doors for 
an extension to bond buying program beyond March 2017, the visible 
disappointment could propel the Euro higher.

Markets should be patient, as the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> will surely boost 
its QE programme once its staff have worked out the best method.

So argues Craig Erlam, market analyst at City firm OANDA.

The ECB may not have announced any more policy easing today, or even indicated 
that further stimulus is likely in the coming months, butMario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> did a fine job in talking 
up bond yields in the euro area. Perhaps a sly attempt to free up more assets 
eligible for purchase under the current quantitative easing structure.

 There were two main takeaways from today’s ECB decision and press conference. 
The first is that inflation and growth forecasts were lowered but only 
marginally reflecting the negative, albeit less so than previously expected, 
impact of the Brexit vote. The other is that the committee has been given a 
full mandate to redesign QE. In other words, the central bank is approaching 
the point at which it will no longer be possible to carry out QE in its current 
form, but it is looking at ways to overcome it.

 That would explain why they did not announce an extension to the QE program 
beyond March 2017 today because they must first decide how the program will be 
adapted. That is not to say it won’t be. In fact, Draghi made it clear that QE 
will continue, stating that it will run until or beyond the current expiry if 
necessary. He also claimed that it will run until inflation path is consistent 
with its goal, which it currently isn’t close to.

 All things considered, today was not the event it was built up to be. 
However, it is clear that the ECB is working towards some significant changes 
to the QE program, even if that doesn’t necessarily mean more stimulus in the 
short term. Whether that takes three or six months isn’t really too important.

Stocks fall after ECB cools stimulus hopes

European stock markets have fallen into the red, after Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> disappointed those 
expecting a new bout of stimulus measures.

The German DAX is leading the selloff, down almost 1.4%.

Traders are somewhat disappointed that the ECB didn’t even discuss extending 
its QE programme, which runs out in six months.

Draghi also didn’t sound like a man close to hitting the panic button - as he 
repeatedly said that the ECB’s measures are working well.

Colin Dewar of Hargreaves Lansdown explains:

In its latest, eagerly awaited policy meeting, the central bank left interest 
rates on hold at its record low of 0.0% as widely expected.

However, during his associated press conference ECB president Mario Draghi 
went on to confirm an extension of its current stimulus programme was not 
discussed between policy makers, going against the predictions of many market 
analysts.

Draghi: We need higher wages

Final question (hurrah!) is also about Germany.

Q: Do we need much higher wages in Germany to cut the current account surplus 
and help other countries sell goods to German consumers?

This question is ‘absolutely right’, Draghi smiles - like a teacher awarding a 
gold star to a bright pupil.

It’s possible that the low inflation rate in the eurozone has fed through to 
wage settlements; if so, the ECB would be very concerned.

And in short:

The case for higher wages is unquestionable.

And with that, Draghi has left the room -- perhaps to get a strong coffee 
after that snoozefest of a press conference.....

Q: Have you considered whether the ECB’s inflation target (just below 2%), 
should be changed to a ‘nominal inflation’ target (ie, growth plus inflation).

We didn’t have that discussion yet, says Draghi, before quickly removing the 
‘yet’.

We didn’t have that discussion, he repeats firmly.

Q: Germany is on track to run a record surplus this year, so will you tell the 
Bundestag to do more to help their neighbours?

You can’t just push a button and eliminate a trade surplus if a country is 
naturally competitive, Draghi replies. This isn’t a “planned economy”.
James Mackintosh (@jmackin2) 
Draghi: "It's not a planned economy". no kidding.

Q: But do you want Germany to boost government spending to help the recovery?

Countries who have fiscal space should use it. Germany has fiscal space, 
Draghi replies smoothly.

Asked again about government policies on structural reforms, Draghi says the 
G20’s communique was quite powerful.

That statement said 
<http://www.g20.org/English/Dynamic/201609/t20160906_3396.html>:

Our growth must be shored up by well-designed and coordinated policies. We are 
determined to use all policy tools - monetary, fiscal and structural - 
individually and collectively to achieve our goal of strong, sustainable, 
balanced and inclusive growth.

Monetary policy will continue to support economic activity and ensure price 
stability, consistent with central banks’ mandates, but monetary policy alone 
cannot lead to balanced growth.

Words are cheaper than action, though, Mario.....
Joseph Lake (@EconomistLake) 
Mario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> apparently 
the only person who both reads and believes G20 statements.

Q: Can you rule out buying shares, or deploying helicopter money?

We haven’t discussed either, Draghi says, so I can’t ask that question.

Q: Can you reassure the public that interest rates will remain positive?

The average consumer is now the main actor in the recovery, Draghi says. The 
recovery is based on domestic consumption, which means it is more resilient 
than previous recoveries based on exports.
Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) 
The more reporters trying to press Draghi to implement further action, the 
more hawkish Draghi is sounding.

Draghi: Rates need to stay low

Eurozone interest rates need to remain low for some time, Draghi says, so that 
the recovery isn’t derailed.

Interest rates have to stay low for the economic recovery to proceed, and to 
firm up.

That, in the end, will have a positive impact on bank balance sheets too.

That’s all for today. Katie Allen’s news story about the ECB is here, and 
being updated now:

ECB keeps interest rates at 0%

I’ll be back tomorrow, to cover a meeting of eurozone finance ministers. 
They’ll be considering Greece’s bailout, where Athens has been falling behind 
its targets. So it could be a lively event.

Thanks for reading and commenting. GW
 
FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga is concerned that Europe’s recovery is 
faltering.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the Eurozone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> is entangled in a losing battle 
with faltering growth while static inflation levels continue to question the 
ECB’s credibility.

Although Draghi also suggested that the economic recovery in Europe is likely 
to be dampened by the UK’s Brexit vote, this was still not enough to prompt the 
central bank to act. While Draghi’s dovish rhetoric may have opened doors for 
an extension to bond buying program beyond March 2017, the visible 
disappointment could propel the Euro higher.
 
Markets should be patient, as the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> will surely boost 
its QE programme once its staff have worked out the best method.

So argues Craig Erlam, market analyst at City firm OANDA.

The ECB may not have announced any more policy easing today, or even indicated 
that further stimulus is likely in the coming months, butMario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> did a fine job in talking 
up bond yields in the euro area. Perhaps a sly attempt to free up more assets 
eligible for purchase under the current quantitative easing structure.

 There were two main takeaways from today’s ECB decision and press conference. 
The first is that inflation and growth forecasts were lowered but only 
marginally reflecting the negative, albeit less so than previously expected, 
impact of the Brexit vote. The other is that the committee has been given a 
full mandate to redesign QE. In other words, the central bank is approaching 
the point at which it will no longer be possible to carry out QE in its current 
form, but it is looking at ways to overcome it.

 That would explain why they did not announce an extension to the QE program 
beyond March 2017 today because they must first decide how the program will be 
adapted. That is not to say it won’t be. In fact, Draghi made it clear that QE 
will continue, stating that it will run until or beyond the current expiry if 
necessary. He also claimed that it will run until inflation path is consistent 
with its goal, which it currently isn’t close to.

 All things considered, today was not the event it was built up to be. 
However, it is clear that the ECB is working towards some significant changes 
to the QE program, even if that doesn’t necessarily mean more stimulus in the 
short term. Whether that takes three or six months isn’t really too important.

European stock markets have fallen into the red, after Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> disappointed those 
expecting a new bout of stimulus measures.

Traders are somewhat disappointed that the ECB didn’t even discuss extending 
its QE programme, which runs out in six months.

Draghi also didn’t sound like a man close to hitting the panic button - as he 
repeatedly said that the ECB’s measures are working well.

Colin Dewar of Hargreaves Lansdown explains:

In its latest, eagerly awaited policy meeting, the central bank left interest 
rates on hold at its record low of 0.0% as widely expected.

However, during his associated press conference ECB president Mario Draghi 
went on to confirm an extension of its current stimulus programme was not 
discussed between policy makers, going against the predictions of many market 
analysts.
 
Final question (hurrah!) is also about Germany.

Q: Do we need much higher wages in Germany to cut the current account surplus 
and help other countries sell goods to German consumers?

This question is ‘absolutely right’, Draghi smiles - like a teacher awarding a 
gold star to a bright pupil.

It’s possible that the low inflation rate in the eurozone has fed through to 
wage settlements; if so, the ECB would be very concerned.

And in short:

The case for higher wages is unquestionable.

And with that, Draghi has left the room -- perhaps to get a strong coffee 
after that snoozefest of a press conference.....
 
Q: Have you considered whether the ECB’s inflation target (just below 2%), 
should be changed to a ‘nominal inflation’ target (ie, growth plus inflation).

We didn’t have that discussion yet, says Draghi, before quickly removing the 
‘yet’.

We didn’t have that discussion, he repeats firmly.
 
This has not been the most exciting press conference in monetary policy 
history...

Q: Germany is on track to run a record surplus this year, so will you tell the 
Bundestag to do more to help their neighbours?

You can’t just push a button and eliminate a trade surplus if a country is 
naturally competitive, Draghi replies. This isn’t a “planned economy”.

Draghi: "It's not a planned economy". no kidding.

Q: But do you want Germany to boost government spending to help the recovery?

Countries who have fiscal space should use it. Germany has fiscal space, 
Draghi replies smoothly.
 
Asked again about government policies on structural reforms, Draghi says the 
G20’s communique was quite powerful.

That statement said 
<http://www.g20.org/English/Dynamic/201609/t20160906_3396.html>:

Our growth must be shored up by well-designed and coordinated policies. We are 
determined to use all policy tools - monetary, fiscal and structural - 
individually and collectively to achieve our goal of strong, sustainable, 
balanced and inclusive growth.

Monetary policy will continue to support economic activity and ensure price 
stability, consistent with central banks’ mandates, but monetary policy alone 
cannot lead to balanced growth.

Words are cheaper than action, though, Mario.....

Q: Can you rule out buying shares, or deploying helicopter money?

We haven’t discussed either, Draghi says, so I can’t ask that question.

Q: Can you reassure the public that interest rates will remain positive?

The average consumer is now the main actor in the recovery, Draghi says. The 
recovery is based on domestic consumption, which means it is more resilient 
than previous recoveries based on exports.
