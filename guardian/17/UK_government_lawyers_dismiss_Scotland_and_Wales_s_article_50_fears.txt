A constitutional row over devolution has erupted ahead of next week’s article 
50 case in the supreme court, setting the attorney generals in London and 
Belfast at odds with their counterparts in Cardiff and Edinburgh.

A submission

 by the Westminster government’s legal team has dismissed Scottish and Welsh 
arguments that triggeringarticle 50 of the Lisbon treaty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50> will diminish the legislative 
powers of their administrations.

When the case opens in the supreme court next week those seeking to assert 
their authority will include the counsel general for Wales, Mick Antoniw, who 
is a Labour member of the Welsh assembly; James Wolffe QC, Scotland’s lord 
advocate; John Larkin QC, attorney general for Northern Ireland; and the 
attorney general for England and Wales,Jeremy Wright QC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-wright>, who is a Conservative MP.

The main thrust of the legal dispute is over whether the government’s 
executive powers, derived from the royal prerogative, trump parliamentary 
sovereignty in terms of triggering the UK’s departure from the EU.

The question of whether Brexit can take place without the devolved assemblies’ 
agreement will, however, also be raised.

The supplementary skeleton argument released by the Westminster government on 
Thursday states: “The devolution legislation expressly does not give competence 
to the devolved legislatures or administrations over the conduct of foreign 
affairs, including relations with the EU. The prerogative power to withdraw 
from treaties is deliberately unaffected ... no issue concerning the Sewel 
convention arises in this case because there is no legislation before the 
court. This case concerns the proper use of the prerogative.”

The Sewel convention says that the UK parliament may not legislate for 
devolved matters without the consent of the devolved legislature.

The submission by Wright and his legal team continues: “The [supreme] court is 
being invited by the lord advocate and the counsel general to stray into areas 
of political judgment rather than legal adjudication. The court should resist 
that invitation, particularly where the underlying issue is one of considerable 
political sensitivity.”


The position adopted by Larkin, that the article 50 case does not raise any 
devolution issues even in relation to theGood Friday agreement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/jun/07/guardian190-good-friday-agreement-1998>
, was praised by Wright.

In a footnote the document refer to “the considerable repetition by the lord 
advocate and counsel general of submissions”. At another point it quibbles over 
the Welsh and Scottish approaches, saying: “That [Welsh] argument, in contrast 
to that of the lord advocate, at least has the merit of focusing on the issue 
of use of the prerogative, which is the issue before the court.”

Skeleton arguments, submitted to judges before court hearings, sometimes do 
contain personally dismissive asides. The tone of some of the language in 
Wright’s submission has, however, drawn sharp comment, including from Sir Paul 
Jenkins QC, a former head of the government legal department.

Jolyon Maugham <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jolyon-maugham> QC 
tweeted: “Translated from lawyer, para 39 says the Welsh assembly is wrong but, 
unlike the Scottish government, at least is not stupid to boot.”
