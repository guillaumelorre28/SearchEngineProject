In October 2015 I had a problem accessing my Yahoo email account. I Googled 
“Yahoo email help” and the first entry was an 0800 number, which I rang.

The person I spoke to took me through a series of actions which appeared to 
give him access to my computer, and the problems were solved. Naively I agreed 
to pay online as the person I was speaking to had access to my computer, and 
£198 was charged to my credit card account.

A year later I received a call purportedly from the same company claiming that 
my annual support was due, and asking me to turn my computer on. I said I was 
not interested. I was then told that I had entered a contract and there was a 
£200 cancellation fee. I replied that I had no intention of agreeing.

The person then quoted the last four digits of my credit card and said the 
amount would be taken unless I agreed to support continuing. All my instincts 
told me I was not at any risk, especially as in the meantime I had changed my 
computer. The money was never taken.

In December the calls resumed, this time with the added statement that my 
computer had been hacked and that all my systems would crash unless I allowed 
access.

I have put a stop on my credit card, and although I am fairly confident the 
situation is at an end, I shall of course monitor my account. Others beware.

A timely reminder as to why you should never give anyone remote access to your 
computer, irrespective of who they claim to be.

Had you not changed your computer I would have advised you to save all data to 
an external drive and wipe the computer clean, taking it back to factory 
settings, as it would have been compromised.
