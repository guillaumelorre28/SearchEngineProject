 William Hague's pledge of tough new asylum laws last night met heavy 
opposition from a former Tory immigration minister and a current Tory 
candidate, as well as Labour, Liberal Democrats and refugee leaders.
The centrepiece proposal, for compulsory detention for all asylum seekers in 
special reception centres, was declared unworkable by Charles Wardle, a Home 
Office minister in John Major's government.

Mr Wardle, who is now backing the UK Independence party, said: "It will not 
tackle the problem since the majority of asylum seekers are people who arrive 
on visas and overstay. Alternatively they will arrive as clandestines without a 
stamp in the passport. They could not be put into detention centres."

The Tory candidate in Dover, Paul Watkins, refused to back the idea of a 
reception centre in Dover itself. "We want a solution to the problem," he said.

Mr Hague, launching the first part of a long-planned strategy to capitalise on 
one of the main issues he believes will boost his poll standing, promised to 
"clear up Labour's asylum mess" with a package which also included a new 
"removals agency" to track down people whose claims had been rejected but who 
remained in the country.

In a speech in the marginal seat of Dover, where there have long been tensions 
between refugees and the local community, the Tory leader attacked Labour's 
record.

"The simple truth is that today our asylum system lies in pieces," he said. 
"We need a system which makes it possible to process claims speedily, so that 
genuine refugees can be integrated into British life and bogus claimants are 
sent back home."

Tony Blair accused the Tory leader of opportunism. "They are trying to exploit 
it while we are trying to deal with it," he said during a visit to Lincolnshire.

The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, said: "I think to play this card 
in this election is mad, bad and dangerous. This is a party which now combines 
all the instincts of Alf Garnett with the appeal of Michael Foot."

But the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, said: "We are not going to be 
driven off debating what is a massive problem. There is a conflation going on 
of asylum, immigration and race... Our political opponents are trying to 
pretend they are the same things and that is the reason for not debating them. 
They are not."

Mr Hague, in a speech which sought to be positive, stressed his commitment to 
the principle of asylum.

"I am determined that we should never abandon our proud tradition of offering 
sanctuary to those who are fleeing injustice and wrong," he said.

"I would be ashamed to live in a Britain that closed its doors to the genuine 
refugee."

The Tory leader pointed to statistics which show that the number of people 
claiming asylum in Britain had more than doubled since Labour came to power in 
1997, reaching a record 76,000 last year. Although nearly 80% of cases dealt 
with last year were refused, only 9,000 rejected applicants were deported from 
Britain, he said.

"The real people to blame for this situation are those who have plunged the 
system into chaos in the first place," he said. "The longer the queue, the 
worse the administrative confusion, the greater the incentive is for racketeers 
to target their efforts on Britain.

"There is a direct link between government incompetence in managing asylum 
cases and the surge in applications to stay here."

He said secure reception centres would ensure that "people who are trying to 
evade immigration controls are kept in one place and are not able to disappear 
into the wider community".

Proposals for a similar centre at Aldington in Kent were rejected by the 
Conservative local authority as unsuitable.

Miss Widdecombe later acknowledged there were difficulties. "I understand 
local concerns. There is always some degree of local resistance. But life is a 
series of obstacles you have to get over. It's not all going to be a primrose 
path."

She said the plans would act as a major deterrent to asylum seekers. Although 
home office ministers say places for up to 32,000 people could be needed, she 
believed 4,000 would be enough. That would still require 10 centres the size of 
the only one so far in existence, at Oakington in Cambridgeshire.

The Tories also propose a new "meet the planes" policy to tackle the problem 
of asylum seekers who get on a plane with documents and land without them. 
Under the new policy, immigration officers would go out to planes on the 
tarmac, which would remove any doubt about passengers' country of origin.

Lord Taylor of Warwick, the black Tory peer who called Mr Hague "weak" for not 
taking swift action against the outspoken MP John Townend during the recent 
race row, criticised the detention centre plan.

"You have to treat people like human beings," he told BBC Radio 4. "We are not 
talking about cages, but you are taking away in effect people's liberty.

"I think the real answer is not detention centres but to make sure that the 
system is more efficient and effective."

The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said it would launch a 
"radical" manifesto today to revamp Britain's "racist" immigration system, 
including urgent action to defend refugee status in Britain and scrapping the 
voucher scheme.

"It is universally accepted that British immigration policy is framed on 
racist principles," said Habib Rahman, the council's chief executive.
