Richard Rodgers’ and Lorenz Hart’s 1937 composition The Lady Is a Tramp has 
been performed by many singers, but the most widely known version is the1960 
recording by Buddy Greco <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2paVgBb8iE>, who has 
died aged 90. It encapsulated Greco’s jazz-inflected, finger-snapping, 
wisecracking, dynamic vocal style and went on to sell more than a million 
copies.

He was born Armando Greco in Philadelphia into a musical Italian-American 
family. His father was variously a record store owner, a radio show host and an 
opera critic, and his mother a musician. Armando took up the piano at the age 
of four in 1930, when he also made his radio debut as a singer. The family 
could pay for tuition but did not own a piano. He told an interviewer that 
after each lesson he would “run home and practise on a cut-out of a piano 
keyboard my father found on the cover of a magazine. I would play this keyboard 
and actually hear the notes in my head.”

The music heard in the Greco home was classical, but Armando was converted 
from Enrico Caruso to jazz as soon as he heard a Louis Armstrong record. He 
turned professional as a teenager and gained a new forename when a bandleader 
seeking a pianist at the local musicians’ union office asked him: “Buddy, would 
you like a job?”

 Buddy Greco performing The Lady Is a Tramp in 1964 
By the late 1940s, Greco was leading his own group, the Three Sharps, and in 
1948 he had a hit with a recording ofOoh Look-a There, Ain’t She Pretty 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8qyXBDcgLQ>, a song first recorded by Fats 
Waller. The next year the bandleader Benny Goodman offered Greco a job with his 
orchestra. He was in two minds but followed his father’s advice to “go with Mr 
Goodman and learn your craft”.

In 1951, Greco left the band to embark on a solo career of nightclub shows, 
recordings and television appearances (introduced as “Mr Excitement of Song”) 
that would continue throughout his life. He became the consummate example of 
what American reviewers called the saloon or lounge singer. He would often 
extemporise lyrics or call out “talk to me, piano” when embarking on a solo. 
Greco’s early nightclub act was captured on the 1955 LP Buddy Greco at Mr 
Kelly’s, recorded at a Chicago nightspot and one of the best of his albums, of 
which there were more than 60.

The zeal with which he ingratiated himself with audiences delighted some 
critics and alienated others. Some felt he was beyond parody, although the 
comedian Jerry Lewis got close with his portrayal of the character Buddy Love 
in the 1963 film The Nutty Professor.

Greco claimed to have played at least twice in every major club, but his most 
favoured venues were in Las Vegas and in Britain. For many years he was 
associated with the Desert Inn in Las Vegas, a city where he caroused with the 
so-called Rat Pack led by Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr, who said: “Buddy 
Greco’s world is a very swinging world.”

He made his first visit to Britain in 1949, performing at the London Palladium 
with Goodman. He had a home in London for many years and bought a flat in 
Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, telling a Big Issue interviewer in 2010 that Southend 
was “the greatest little city in the world”.

Among the highlights of his British career were the 1963 Royal Variety 
Performance headlined by the Beatles, concerts with the National YouthJazz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> Orchestra and performances with the 
London Symphony Orchestra, in which he would feature his bravura piano playing 
on Jimmy Webb’s MacArthur Park.

Greco was renowned for his hot temper. He once pushed a piano off stage 
towards an audience member who refused to extinguish his cigar, and he squared 
up to the younger singer Bobby Darin, whom he accused of stealing aspects of 
his act.

Greco last appeared in Las Vegas in November, when he was inducted into the 
Las Vegas Entertainment Hall of Fame.

He is survived by his fifth wife, the singer Lezlie Anders, seven children and 
many grandchildren from his earlier marriages to Sally Baionno, Dani Crayne, 
Margret Kinley and Jackie Sabatino. All ended in divorce.
