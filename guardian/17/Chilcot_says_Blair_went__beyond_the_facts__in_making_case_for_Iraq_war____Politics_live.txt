Afternoon summary

 * Sir John Chilcot has told MPs that Tony Blair’s “sheer psychological 
dominance” played a key role in the run-up to the Iraq war, and meant that 
flawed evidence justifying the 2003 invasion was never challenged. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/02/tony-blair-psychological-dominance-key-in-uk-joining-iraq-war-says-chilcot>
 * Labour has announced that it is organising special screening of Ken Loach’s 
film I, Daniel Blake ahead of the autumn statement as part of a campaign to get 
the government to reverse cuts to employment and support allowance, a 
disability benefit. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: 
In the run up to the autumn statement Labour will be pushing the chancellor, 
Philip Hammond, to scrap these cruel ESA cuts to sick and disabled people.

I, Daniel Blake was one of the most moving films I’ve ever seen so I’m very 
pleased we have teamed up with Ken Loach to urge people to go and watch it at 
these special screenings taking place before the autumn statement.

We’re living in an I, Daniel Blake society as a result of having the Tories in 
power for six years. The government should be caring for sick and disabled 
people, not making their lives worse.

 * Sir Michael Wilshaw, the Ofsted chief inspector, has described England’s 
education system as like its football team - “better than many, but hardly top 
notch”.In a speech he said: 
For the most part, England’s education system is a bit like its football team 
- better than many, but hardly top notch.

We comfort ourselves with past success, illusory as that might be, dream of 
future glory, then collapse into despair when we come across superior play.

This familiar tale of disappointment, however, is misleading in two important 
respects.

Firstly, it fails to recognise that our education system has come from a long 
way back. Twenty years ago, standards were truly dire across the phases, and 
generations of children were being let down year after year. Since the dark 
days of the 70s, 80s and much of the 90s, schools have got a lot better.

Secondly, it can tempt us to adopt fanciful and nostalgic solutions while our 
very real structural problems are ignored.

 * Drivers of polluting diesel vehicles could soon be charged to enter many 
city centres across Britain, after the government accepted in the high court on 
Wednesday that its current plans to tackle the nation’s air pollution crisis 
were so poor they broke the law. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/diesel-vehicles-face-charges-after-uk-government-loses-air-pollution-case>
As Damian Carrington reports, the humiliating legal defeat is the second in 18 
months and ends years of inadequate action and delays to tackle the problem 
which causes 50,000 early deaths every year. Ministers are now bound to 
implement new measures to cut toxic air quickly and the prime minister, Theresa 
May, indicated the government would this time respond positively: “There is 
more to do and we will do it.” The most likely measure is using charges to 
deter polluting diesel vehicles from “clean air zones” in urban centres, which 
could be in place next year in London and in 2018 in Birmingham and other 
cities. 
 * The Labour MP Marie Rimmer has walked free from court after a sheriff 
described allegations that she had assaulted a Scottish independence campaigner 
as “a storm in a tea cup”.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Andrew Tyrie tries to wind up. But Bernard Jenkin insists on one more 
question. What machinery should have been in place to address the point in 
paragraph 617. (See5.23pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/02/pmqs-may-corbyn-chilcot-hammond-to-adopt-flexible-fiscal-targets-in-autumn-statement-politics-live?page=with:block-581a2010e4b029b92ca44cde#block-581a2010e4b029b92ca44cde>

Chilcot says civil servants did propose government machinery of that kind. A 
paper went in to Number 10. But it came back with a crucial element missing - 
ministerial oversight.

And that’s it. The hearing is over.

Chilcot says you would have to look inside Blair’s heart and mind to know what 
he thought at the time.

There is a question to be asked about how much a modern prime minister can be 
expected to absorb, given how much he or she has to take in.

He says the inquiry came close to recommending that there should have been a 
full-time minister working for Blair on this.

Q: Wasn’t that the foreign secretary’s job?

Chilcot says the foreign secretary had other things to do.

He says the example he has in mind is Harold Macmillan, who during the second 
world war was a minister based in the Mediterranean working on the war effort.

Andrew Tyrie says it looks like a war that was pushed through by one man. 
Therefore you need to apportion blame accordingly.

Tyrie quotes paragraph 617 in the executive summary, saying: “At no stage did 
ministers or senior officials commission the systematic evaluation of different 
options, incorporating detailed analysis of risk and UK capabilities, military 
and civilian, which should have been required before the UK committed to any 
course of action inIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>.” He suggests 
Blair was to blame for that.

Chilcot says anyone who could have commissioned an evaluation should have done 
so.

Q: Was the procurement of protective equipment for troops delayed because 
Blair did not want to admit he had decided to go to war?

Chilcot says you cannot make that connection. He says Blair was reluctant to 
admit Blair was going to happen. But that did not hold up the acquisition of 
equipment that would have protected soldiers for IEDs [improvised explosive 
devices].

Chilcot says Saddam’s ‘hidden’ WMD was in fact just an 'accounting problem'

Q: What do you think Saddam did with his WMD? Did he destroy them or pass them 
on to someone else?

Chilcot says he does not for a moment think Saddam gave them to anyone else.

He thinks undocumented destruction and despatch of weapons took place on a 
vast scale after the first Gulf war. People thought the gap between what was 
recorded as being destroyed and what he had was seen as a hidden arsenal. It 
was not, he says. It was an “accounting problem”.

Q: Was Blair’s message to Bush a secret commitment to war?

Chilcot says it is worth asking what would have happened if the UK had not 
given that commitment.

He says if Blair had been firmer, he might have delayed the invastion until 
the autumn of 2003. That might have been a better time for the war, because of 
the weather. And it might have affected the internal dynamics in the White 
House. Colin Powell might have been more influential.

Q; Was Blair acting more from solidarity than strategy?

Chilcot says he agrees.
Patrick Kidd (@patrick_kidd) 
Julian Lewis: "was decision for war 'solidarity rather than strategy'?"
Chilcot: "That's an admirably concise statement with which I agree"

Julian Lewis, a Conservative, goes next. He says he supported the war but made 
a mistake.

Q: What do you blame Blair for, and what do you absolve him for?

Chilcot says he absolves Blair from the charge that he purposely set out to 
deceive.

But, when was making the case for war, he was engaged in advocacy, not sharing 
information in a reasonable way, he says.

Q: Who else do you blame?

Chilcot says Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, and Geoff Hoon, the defence 
secretary, were key figures. Clare Short, the international development 
secretary, had some responsibility, he says.

He says Straw was more influential than Hoon.

 * Sir John Chilcot has told MPs that Tony Blair’s “sheer psychological 
dominance” played a key role in the run-up to the Iraq war, and meant that 
flawed evidence justifying the 2003 invasion was never challenged.

 * Labour has announced that it is organising special screening of Ken Loach’s 
film I, Daniel Blake ahead of the autumn statement as part of a campaign to get 
the government to reverse cuts to employment and support allowance, a 
disability benefit. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: 
In the run up to the autumn statement Labour will be pushing the chancellor, 
Philip Hammond, to scrap these cruel ESA cuts to sick and disabled people.

I, Daniel Blake was one of the most moving films I’ve ever seen so I’m very 
pleased we have teamed up with Ken Loach to urge people to go and watch it at 
these special screenings taking place before the autumn statement.

We’re living in an I, Daniel Blake society as a result of having the Tories in 
power for six years. The government should be caring for sick and disabled 
people, not making their lives worse.

 * Sir Michael Wilshaw, the Ofsted chief inspector, has described England’s 
education system as like its football team - “better than many, but hardly top 
notch”.In a speech he said: 
For the most part, England’s education system is a bit like its football team 
- better than many, but hardly top notch.

We comfort ourselves with past success, illusory as that might be, dream of 
future glory, then collapse into despair when we come across superior play.

This familiar tale of disappointment, however, is misleading in two important 
respects.

Firstly, it fails to recognise that our education system has come from a long 
way back. Twenty years ago, standards were truly dire across the phases, and 
generations of children were being let down year after year. Since the dark 
days of the 70s, 80s and much of the 90s, schools have got a lot better.

Secondly, it can tempt us to adopt fanciful and nostalgic solutions while our 
very real structural problems are ignored.

 * Drivers of polluting diesel vehicles could soon be charged to enter many 
city centres across Britain, after the government accepted in the high court on 
Wednesday that its current plans to tackle the nation’s air pollution crisis 
were so poor they broke the law. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/diesel-vehicles-face-charges-after-uk-government-loses-air-pollution-case>
As Damian Carrington reports, the humiliating legal defeat is the second in 18 
months and ends years of inadequate action and delays to tackle the problem 
which causes 50,000 early deaths every year. Ministers are now bound to 
implement new measures to cut toxic air quickly and the prime minister, Theresa 
May, indicated the government would this time respond positively: “There is 
more to do and we will do it.” The most likely measure is using charges to 
deter polluting diesel vehicles from “clean air zones” in urban centres, which 
could be in place next year in London and in 2018 in Birmingham and other 
cities. 
 * The Labour MP Marie Rimmer has walked free from court after a sheriff 
described allegations that she had assaulted a Scottish independence campaigner 
as “a storm in a tea cup”.

Chilcot says civil servants did propose government machinery of that kind. A 
paper went in to Number 10. But it came back with a crucial element missing - 
ministerial oversight.

And that’s it. The hearing is over.
 
Chilcot says you would have to look inside Blair’s heart and mind to know what 
he thought at the time.

There is a question to be asked about how much a modern prime minister can be 
expected to absorb, given how much he or she has to take in.

He says the inquiry came close to recommending that there should have been a 
full-time minister working for Blair on this.

Q: Wasn’t that the foreign secretary’s job?

Chilcot says the foreign secretary had other things to do.

He says the example he has in mind is Harold Macmillan, who during the second 
world war was a minister based in the Mediterranean working on the war effort.
 
Chilcot says his inquiry team were very determined not to use hindsight when 
making judgments.
 
Andrew Tyrie says it looks like a war that was pushed through by one man. 
Therefore you need to apportion blame accordingly.

Tyrie quotes paragraph 617 in the executive summary, saying: “At no stage did 
ministers or senior officials commission the systematic evaluation of different 
options, incorporating detailed analysis of risk and UK capabilities, military 
and civilian, which should have been required before the UK committed to any 
course of action inIraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq>.” He suggests 
Blair was to blame for that.

Chilcot says anyone who could have commissioned an evaluation should have done 
so.

Q: Was the procurement of protective equipment for troops delayed because 
Blair did not want to admit he had decided to go to war?

Chilcot says you cannot make that connection. He says Blair was reluctant to 
admit Blair was going to happen. But that did not hold up the acquisition of 
equipment that would have protected soldiers for IEDs [improvised explosive 
devices].
 
Q: What do you think Saddam did with his WMD? Did he destroy them or pass them 
on to someone else?

Chilcot says he does not for a moment think Saddam gave them to anyone else.

He thinks undocumented destruction and despatch of weapons took place on a 
vast scale after the first Gulf war. People thought the gap between what was 
recorded as being destroyed and what he had was seen as a hidden arsenal. It 
was not, he says. It was an “accounting problem”.

 * Chilcot says Saddam’s ‘hidden’ WMD was in fact just an ‘accounting problem’. 
Q: Was Blair’s message to Bush a secret commitment to war?

Chilcot says it is worth asking what would have happened if the UK had not 
given that commitment.

He says if Blair had been firmer, he might have delayed the invastion until 
the autumn of 2003. That might have been a better time for the war, because of 
the weather. And it might have affected the internal dynamics in the White 
House. Colin Powell might have been more influential.

Q; Was Blair acting more from solidarity than strategy?

Chilcot says he agrees.

Julian Lewis: "was decision for war 'solidarity rather than strategy'?"
Chilcot: "That's an admirably concise statement with which I agree"

Julian Lewis, a Conservative, goes next. He says he supported the war but made 
a mistake.

Q: What do you blame Blair for, and what do you absolve him for?

Chilcot says he absolves Blair from the charge that he purposely set out to 
deceive.

But, when was making the case for war, he was engaged in advocacy, not sharing 
information in a reasonable way, he says.

Q: Who else do you blame?

Chilcot says Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, and Geoff Hoon, the defence 
secretary, were key figures. Clare Short, the international development 
secretary, had some responsibility, he says.

He says Straw was more influential than Hoon.
