Southern <https://www.theguardian.com/business/southern> rail passengers have 
been told services will be severely disrupted over the next few days because of 
a fresh strike by guards and an ongoing overtime ban by drivers.


Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> union will walk out for three days 
from New Year’s Eve in a long-running row over the role of conductors, while 
the train drivers’ union Aslef continues its ban on overtime in protest at 
driver-only trains.

The action will cause more travel chaos for passengers who have suffered 
delays and cancellations for months because of the industrial action, staff 
shortages, sickness, signalling problems and other issues.

Passengers are being advised to check before they travel over the new year 
period.

Southern said it would have a team of “contingency conductors” keeping key 
routes open, but that services on some routes would be reduced and finish 
earlier, while others would have no trains but a replacement bus service.

Services on all routes will be subject to possible cancellation and severe 
disruption.

Alex Foulds, Southern’s deputy chief operating officer, said: “While we will 
do everything we can to get passengers where they want to go, we have to warn 
people that journeys may be disrupted and take longer than normal.

“Our best advice is to check on the day you travel, particularly if you are 
heading out to new year celebrations, as services on some routes finish early 
in the evening.

“We are sorry that yet again passengers will have their plans disrupted by 
what is pointless industrial action. Our door remains open for meaningful talks 
and we urge theRMT <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/rmt> to see sense and 
join us in delivering a better railway for everyone in 2017.”

The RMT’s leader, Mick Cash, said: “The solution to this continuing chaos is 
in the hands of Govia Thameslink Railway, which runs Southern, and the 
government.

“If the owners, the Go Ahead Group, spent a fraction of the millions they are 
stockpiling in profits and dividends on staffing and safety, this dispute could 
be resolved overnight. RMT remains available for talks.”
