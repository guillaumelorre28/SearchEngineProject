I just had a battle with my new kitchen handwash plastic bottle. I couldn’t 
get the pump to work. I pressed it, twisted it, fiddled with it, broke it, and 
then suddenly, for no particular reason, the contents squirted everywhere.

Then I had another fight with the cellophane packaging on the cardboard box 
around my tea bags. Couldn’t get it off, couldn’t get my nails or the scissors 
under it, so I stabbed at the whole box with a pointy knife and ripped it open.


That’s all my own fault, because I should have bought a bar of soap, wrapped 
in paper, and loose-leaf tea, in one cardboard layer of packaging, not a few 
leaves wrapped in paper, wrapped in cardboard, wrapped in polythene.

I didn’t because I’m lazy, like a lot of modern consumers. But these 
relatively modern wrappings perhaps annoy and worry me more because I’m old 
enough to remember a time when we managed without them.

Plastic never goes away

I miss the old milk bottles (glass, made of sand and easily recyclable), the 
brown paper bags for loose fruit and vegetables. We used to drain our fried 
fish and chips on them and we used tea leaves and teapots instead of teabags. 
This isn’t just pointless nostalgia. It shows that you can live without 
excessive wrapping, like sellers on e-commerce sites withRussian-doll style 
packaging

, and without so much plastic.

Now it’s plastic, plastic, plastic: everywhere. Is there anything sillier than 
four apples or pears on a moulded polystyrene bed, covered in a hard plastic 
shell, wrapped in polythene? We can at least still buy fruit and veg loose, but 
hardly anyone makes their own chips. They’re sold, oven ready, in plastic bags.

 No wonder not many of us dare to think about packaging and recycling because, 
when you do, our prospects look terrifying. Travelling from Cairo to Cape Town, 
Melinda Watson, who set upRaw Foundation 
<http://rawfoundation.org/making-waves/>, stopped every 100km and recorded the 
alarming amount of plastic in one square metre on each side of the road, mostly 
plastic drinks bottles, plastic bags, polystyrene food containers.

“Plastic can never be recycled completely. After two or three recycles it 
becomes inferior in quality. A staggering 72% of plastic packaging is not 
recovered at all: 40% is landﬁlled, and 32% leaks out the collection system,” 
says Watson.

In our oceans, plastic breaks down into molecules, which behave like sponges 
and sop up other toxins – colourants, additives, plasticisers – which get into 
our food chain and poison us. It’s simple, if you put toxins in they have to 
come out somewhere. All the plastic ever made is still here, in one form or 
another.


Taxing coffee cups is not the answer: here's why

Bad design, poor recycling

 The worse culprits are single-use plastic and plastic packaging: coffee cups (
10,000 <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-36882799> chucked every two minutes, 
just in the UK), straws (Americans use500m 
<http://www.ecocycle.org/bestrawfree/faqs> every day), yoghurt cartons, 
cocktail stirrers, plastic razors, microbeads, and Tetra Pak cartons (because 
they’re made of several ingredients that are difficult to separate: card, 
aluminium, plastic coating) and coffee pods.

 You name it, we probably can’t recycle it. John Sylvan, inventor of the K-Cup 
single-serving coffee pod, America’s biggest selling capsule, now “feel[s] bad 
sometimes that [he] ever did it <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35605927>”. 
But it’s too late now. It’s out there, and we have to find a way of dealing 
with it – of disposing of the trillion pods, pots, containers, wrappers, pizza 
boxes, toothpaste tubes, and anything else with food stuck to it, before they 
finish us off, along with all marine life.

When it comes to coffee pods, Nespresso says its are 99% aluminium and 
completely recyclable, and that used capsules can be dropped off at one of its 
6,000 UK boutiques drop off points. But how many do that? Nestlé, which owns 
the Nespresso brand, hasrefused to say 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/27/nespresso-sustainability-transparency-recycling-coffee-pods-values-aluminum>
 what proportion of its coffee capsules are recycled.

Great ideas

However, there are more positive examples out there. The dairy company Müller 
is reversing its plan to only sell milk in plastic bottles, and encouraging a 
return to glass bottles and home deliveries. I wish them luck. Milk in the UK 
used to be 94% bottled, now it’s down to 4%.

 Less than 5% of our milk in the UK is now consumed in glass bottles.

On a national scale, France has passed a new law which will come into effect 
in 2020 to ensure all plastic cups, cutlery and plates can be composted and are 
made of biologically-sourced materials. Germany has theOriginal Unverpackt

There are also new companies emerging with more focus on sustainable 
packaging. An American brewery has introducededible six-pack rings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/29/florida-brewery-creates-edible-beer-holders-save-marine-life-saltwater>
, while Gumdrop recycles and processes chewing gum, and turns it into 
wellington boots, mobile phone covers, stationary and packaging. Others are 
making packing materials from compostablecorn starch

New York-basedEcovative design 
<http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/design_innovation/packaging/ecovative-foraging-fungi-displace-plastic-packaging-setti>
 has developed fungus-based packing materials.

These initiatives, large and small, give us some hope that we can tackle 
packaging waste. But, as we should remind ourselves, the good old days of zero 
packaging haven’t really gone away. We can choose glass bottles of milk, 
Marmite and ketchup, instead of those pointless plastic squeezy versions, we 
can refuse plastic bags, and try much harder to live less wastefully, as we 
used to.
