Govia Thameslink Railway is taking a legal case against drivers’ union Aslef 
to the supreme court over its industrial action onSouthern

The move came on the second day of strike action 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/10/strike-southern-rail-commuters-british-airways>
 by the union in a dispute over driver-only trains. A further strike will be 
held on Friday, with three more walkouts due at the end of the month.

The strikes have halted most of Southern’s 2,200 daily services. GTR lost a 
court case

 andan appeal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/12/southern-train-drivers-strike-tuesday-court-of-appeal>
 last year to try to stop the strikes.

A statement said: “GTR is determined to protect its passengers and its 
business from unlawful industrial action. GTR is therefore prepared to continue 
its legal claim to the supreme court, as it believes that it has an arguable 
case that the industrial action is unlawful under EU law.”

Last month, the high court rejected an argument from GTR that industrial 
action would breach customers’ rights. Aslef described last month’s legal 
action as a waste of taxpayers’, shareholders’ and passengers’ money.

There was no immediate comment from the union to the new legal move. Aslef 
members are continuing to ban overtime, which has led to delays and 
cancellations.
