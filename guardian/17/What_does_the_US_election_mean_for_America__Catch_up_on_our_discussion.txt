This says that it was Theresa May who called Trump (

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/10/concerns-over-special-relationship-allayed-as-may-speaks-to-trump>
 ):

May talked to Trump earlier on Thursday, a Downing Street statement said. It 
added that the prime minister called “to congratulate him on his hard-fought 
election campaign and victory”, and confirmed May had been invited to visit the 
US “as soon as possible”.

So he didn't call her, but she called him?

Our in the know colleague seems to have more ...

You mean everyone phones the new US president at the same time and he chooses 
what call to take first and Trump talked to another ten people before talking 
to Theresa May?

We think so!

Shocking changes to chocolate are a national obsession

Martin Belam

In a week that didn’t feature a great deal of cheer, there was one topic that 
unified the divided British nation. The outrageous changes to the shape of our 
beloved Toblerone chocolate. The most read list on the BBC News site was 
reassuringly British.

I’ve got to be honest – I always thought that Toblerone was something that 
people only ever bought in a panic at airports if they’d forgotten to get 
someone a gift when they were abroad.

I always thought they made Toblerone triangular so it fits in the box.

And of course, it didn’t unify us for long. There had to be a Brexit angle, 
didn’t there?

Rebecca Nicholson argued that it summed up 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/toblerone-gap-brexit-falling-pound-2016>
:


It’s easy to scoff at the fact that it takes food to act as a focal point for 
what is happening in this country, when there is so much that has been truly 
awful about this year...Child poverty, hate crime, the immediate retraction of 
a promise of extra NHS funding – all of these things should be more alarming 
than a slightly smaller chocolate bar, or a pricier snack. But all of these 
things have become part of a slow, heavy, ominous collective sigh that has 
summed up the past few months. Indeed, 2016 has been defined by a creeping 
sense of dread that all the progress humanity has made over the past few 
decades – centuries, if you’re feeling particularly doomy – might be about to 
unravel.

But then she was writing in the golden era before Trump was elected and we 
found out thatLeonard Cohen had died

Britain's fear and shame: systematic violations of disabled people's rights

Frances Ryan

In a week that brought us President-elect Trump, closer to home, Brits had our 
own reasons to feel that droning mix of fear and shame: a UN inquiry concluded 
that the UK’sausterity policies amounted to “systematic violations” <http:// 
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/uk-austerity-policies-amount-to-violations-of-disabled-peoples-rights>
 of disabled people’s rights.

The work and pensions secretary, Damian Green, dismissed the scathing report 
<http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/InquiryProcedure.aspx> as 
“patronising and offensive”to disabled people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/08/damian-green-dismisses-offensive-un-report-on-uk-disability-rights>
. Which is ironic, really, because I’d say the Conservatives telling 
paraplegics and cancer patients that being forced to pay the bedroom tax whilst 
having their disability benefit cut and social care removed “isn’t really as 
bad as you think” is the definition of patronising and offensive.

There’s been a lot of talk of a possible future president in Michelle Obama, 
but this reader doesn’t see it:

I'm astonished to see people quite seriously expressing hope that Michelle 
Obama will run next time.

All the stuff about writers hoping to tell their daughters that they could be 
President just like Hillary was undermined by her surname. Dynasties are part 
of the problem.

And this article suggests it isn’t likely to happen anyway:

Why Michelle Obama is unlikely to run for president

What does a Trump win mean for Egypt?

Carmen Fishwick

World leaders have begun congratulating Donald Trump on his election win as 
people around the world anxiously wait to seehow their country will engage with 
the new US president. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/as-citizens-we-will-suffer-people-around-the-world-react-to-trumps-win>

Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was the first global leader to speak to 
Donald Trump on the phone. He was also one of the first to congratulate him 
publicly. After a meeting in New York in September, where he met both Trump and 
Clinton, he described Trump as “a strong leader.” Trump in turn called Sisi “a 
fantastic guy”.

Trump’s victory has divided Egyptian society. Some are relieved to see Clinton 
— who they believe supported the Muslim Brotherhood — lose. Others are 
devastated, and fear the repercussions of his win.

As part of a community project we asked people in Egypt to share their 
thoughts with us. Here’s what they said.

“Sisi was more than thrilled by his win. Trump, as a fascist leader, won’t be 
concerned much with the state of human rights. His support will directly result 
in more bloodshed and more violations of law and human rights in Egypt.

“When the far-right controls the most powerful office in the world, this will 
give a huge push to all the rightwing in the world. I’m talking about the 
extremist terrorist movements. Electing an anti-Muslim anti-Arab as a president 
is going to feed more and more the image those movements are trying to spread 
about the US as the biggest devil in the world, and will further inflate the 
violence and terrorism. This will only help increase the instability and the 
warfare in the region, and maybe the whole world” – Amr, Egypt

“We live in a police state where students, activists and journalists disappear 
or are jailed. The Obama administration had been putting pressure on our 
government to improve human rights and freedom of speech, but I doubt Donald 
Trump’s administration will do the same. This is evident from our current 
president’s eagerness to connect with Trump.

“Both Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
and Trump are heavily disliked in the Middle East by Muslims and Arabs. While 
Trump is openly hostile to Muslims and clueless about the region, Hillary’s 
policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the 
region despite her party’s more tolerant and inclusive tone” –Mai, Egypt

When Obama was elected he was practically hailed as the second coming of Jesus.

I remember it well, people crying in joy, people hugging in the street, the 
world was going to be a better fairer place. What happened? Absolutely the same 
old same old, the rich got richer the poor poorer.

Now we have the situation in reverse, it looks like the Americans have elected 
the anti-christ and its going to be the end of the world.

We will have to wait and see, but I think that neither one is so bad or the 
other one was so good.

Trumpocalypse: in times of trouble turn to foods that heal

Dale Berning Sawa

Steven W Thrasher’s response to the news this week was one of the most 
heartfelt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/election-analysis-trump-clinton-terrifying-moment-for-america>
, simultaneously heartwarming and heartbreaking: “Hold tight to the ones you 
love, please ,” he wrote, “ because all we’ve got is each other.” It seems to 
be a thought that occurred to quite a few of my friends at the same time. 
“Well, the worst has happened,” texted my friend Alison. “We are terrified 
here.” And then, “I just wanted to say that I love you dearly.” And if you 
think about it, that’s a hopeful response to an otherwise hopeless event.

Telling someone you love them in the face of events that negate brotherly love 
is a small but resolute instance of resistance. Now a year’s worth of reading 
cookbooks on a daily basis – for my job – has made one thing clear. People who 
love to cook, love to share. And the one thing they share more than anything is 
a love of feeding people and the unshakeable belief that cooking a meal for 
someone is bold and restorative, an act of true love.


Georgina Hayden <http://georginahayden.com/apricot-jam/> wrote a book called 
Stirring Slowly this year, which is full of the kind of warming meals you just 
want to come home to on a cold night. She talks about food that heals. So you 
know what, let’s invite each other round to dinner. Let’s make lunchboxes for 
colleagues. Let’s bring cakes into offices and flapjacks into classrooms. Let’s 
take care of each other. Let’s eat together.

Who is Donald Trump? A view through the lens ...

Ben Beaumont-Thomas

I interviewed photographers who’d taken pictures of Trump throughout his 
career, and it struck me just how malleable the president-elect is. One of the 
photographers, Chris Buck, described Trump as being very different in person 
from his bolshy public persona: gracious, funny, charming.


But another, Nigel Parry, said he was exactly the same as in public, that what 
you see is what you get. The two photos were admittedly taken a decade apart, 
but the disparity in their stories seems to suggest that Trump is even more 
chameleonic that we imagine, to the point of never having a stable version of 
himself: a man who makes up his life as he goes along, powered by a kind of 
barrelling narcissism and alpha-male presumptuousness.

Photographers on their best Trump shot: 'I think he's a damaged person'

Who were the closet Trump voters?

Lois Beckett
sarah maclean (@sarahmaclean) 
I went outside to discover a Trump sign on my street, in a window that did not 
have that sign on Tuesday.

Who were the closet Trump voters? That’s a question I’ve been hearing again 
and again in the past few days.

I heard it at an election night party for students of Wharton, Trump’s alma 
mater. A student there told me that no one had been a vocal Trump supporter 
among the student body, but as the returns rolled in, she wondered how of them 
must have be closet Trump fans.

I heard it talking to cultural critic Mikki Kendall, who looked at the strong 
support for Trump among white women – exit polls suggested53% of white women 
voted for Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/white-women-donald-trump-victory>
 – and concluded that it was very difficult to say “that no one who was 
theoretically on the left voted for Trump.”

Trump’s win came as a shock to many Americans. They’re now wondering who 
supported him all along--and simply did not talk about it.


For some Americans, that’s a source of anxiety. At a protest in Chicago 
Thursday night, a young womantold the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/10/not-my-president-thousand-protest-trump-in-rallies-across-the-u-s/>
 that she was deeply upset by the people who had voted for Trump. “I see people 
differently now. I don’t smile at people on the street anymore. Because you 
never know,” she said.

Did British voters feel the same sense of shock that there might be closet 
Brexit supporters who had been around them all the time? Do you have any advice 
for Americans who are devastated by this outcome--the stages of mourning a 
Brexit?

This says that it was Theresa May who called Trump (

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/10/concerns-over-special-relationship-allayed-as-may-speaks-to-trump>
 ):

May talked to Trump earlier on Thursday, a Downing Street statement said. It 
added that the prime minister called “to congratulate him on his hard-fought 
election campaign and victory”, and confirmed May had been invited to visit the 
US “as soon as possible”.

So he didn't call her, but she called him?

You mean everyone phones the new US president at the same time and he chooses 
what call to take first and Trump talked to another ten people before talking 
to Theresa May?

In a week that didn’t feature a great deal of cheer, there was one topic that 
unified the divided British nation. The outrageous changes to the shape of our 
beloved Toblerone chocolate. The most read list on the BBC News site was 
reassuringly British.

I’ve got to be honest – I always thought that Toblerone was something that 
people only ever bought in a panic at airports if they’d forgotten to get 
someone a gift when they were abroad.

I always thought they made Toblerone triangular so it fits in the box.

And of course, it didn’t unify us for long. There had to be a Brexit angle, 
didn’t there?

Rebecca Nicholson argued that it summed up 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/toblerone-gap-brexit-falling-pound-2016>
:


It’s easy to scoff at the fact that it takes food to act as a focal point for 
what is happening in this country, when there is so much that has been truly 
awful about this year...Child poverty, hate crime, the immediate retraction of 
a promise of extra NHS funding – all of these things should be more alarming 
than a slightly smaller chocolate bar, or a pricier snack. But all of these 
things have become part of a slow, heavy, ominous collective sigh that has 
summed up the past few months. Indeed, 2016 has been defined by a creeping 
sense of dread that all the progress humanity has made over the past few 
decades – centuries, if you’re feeling particularly doomy – might be about to 
unravel.

But then she was writing in the golden era before Trump was elected and we 
found out thatLeonard Cohen had died 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/11/i-bunked-off-school-to-go-and-see-him-readers-tributes-to-leonard-cohen>
...
 
In a week that brought us President-elect Trump, closer to home, Brits had our 
own reasons to feel that droning mix of fear and shame: a UN inquiry concluded 
that the UK’sausterity policies amounted to “systematic violations” <http:// 
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/uk-austerity-policies-amount-to-violations-of-disabled-peoples-rights>
 of disabled people’s rights.

The work and pensions secretary, Damian Green, dismissed the scathing report 
<http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/InquiryProcedure.aspx> as 
“patronising and offensive”to disabled people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/08/damian-green-dismisses-offensive-un-report-on-uk-disability-rights>
. Which is ironic, really, because I’d say the Conservatives telling 
paraplegics and cancer patients that being forced to pay the bedroom tax whilst 
having their disability benefit cut and social care removed “isn’t really as 
bad as you think” is the definition of patronising and offensive.
 
There’s been a lot of talk of a possible future president in Michelle Obama, 
but this reader doesn’t see it:

I'm astonished to see people quite seriously expressing hope that Michelle 
Obama will run next time.

All the stuff about writers hoping to tell their daughters that they could be 
President just like Hillary was undermined by her surname. Dynasties are part 
of the problem.

And this article suggests it isn’t likely to happen anyway:

World leaders have begun congratulating Donald Trump on his election win as 
people around the world anxiously wait to seehow their country will engage with 
the new US president. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/as-citizens-we-will-suffer-people-around-the-world-react-to-trumps-win>

Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was the first global leader to speak to 
Donald Trump on the phone. He was also one of the first to congratulate him 
publicly. After a meeting in New York in September, where he met both Trump and 
Clinton, he described Trump as “a strong leader.” Trump in turn called Sisi “a 
fantastic guy”.

Trump’s victory has divided Egyptian society. Some are relieved to see Clinton 
— who they believe supported the Muslim Brotherhood — lose. Others are 
devastated, and fear the repercussions of his win.

As part of a community project we asked people in Egypt to share their 
thoughts with us. Here’s what they said.

“Sisi was more than thrilled by his win. Trump, as a fascist leader, won’t be 
concerned much with the state of human rights. His support will directly result 
in more bloodshed and more violations of law and human rights in Egypt.

“When the far-right controls the most powerful office in the world, this will 
give a huge push to all the rightwing in the world. I’m talking about the 
extremist terrorist movements. Electing an anti-Muslim anti-Arab as a president 
is going to feed more and more the image those movements are trying to spread 
about the US as the biggest devil in the world, and will further inflate the 
violence and terrorism. This will only help increase the instability and the 
warfare in the region, and maybe the whole world” – Amr, Egypt

“We live in a police state where students, activists and journalists disappear 
or are jailed. The Obama administration had been putting pressure on our 
government to improve human rights and freedom of speech, but I doubt Donald 
Trump’s administration will do the same. This is evident from our current 
president’s eagerness to connect with Trump.

“Both Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
and Trump are heavily disliked in the Middle East by Muslims and Arabs. While 
Trump is openly hostile to Muslims and clueless about the region, Hillary’s 
policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the 
region despite her party’s more tolerant and inclusive tone” –Mai, Egypt
 
Is it time to take a step back?

When Obama was elected he was practically hailed as the second coming of Jesus.

I remember it well, people crying in joy, people hugging in the street, the 
world was going to be a better fairer place. What happened? Absolutely the same 
old same old, the rich got richer the poor poorer.

Now we have the situation in reverse, it looks like the Americans have elected 
the anti-christ and its going to be the end of the world.

We will have to wait and see, but I think that neither one is so bad or the 
other one was so good.
 
Steven W Thrasher’s response to the news this week was one of the most 
heartfelt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/election-analysis-trump-clinton-terrifying-moment-for-america>
, simultaneously heartwarming and heartbreaking: “Hold tight to the ones you 
love, please ,” he wrote, “ because all we’ve got is each other.” It seems to 
be a thought that occurred to quite a few of my friends at the same time. 
“Well, the worst has happened,” texted my friend Alison. “We are terrified 
here.” And then, “I just wanted to say that I love you dearly.” And if you 
think about it, that’s a hopeful response to an otherwise hopeless event.

Telling someone you love them in the face of events that negate brotherly love 
is a small but resolute instance of resistance. Now a year’s worth of reading 
cookbooks on a daily basis – for my job – has made one thing clear. People who 
love to cook, love to share. And the one thing they share more than anything is 
a love of feeding people and the unshakeable belief that cooking a meal for 
someone is bold and restorative, an act of true love.


Georgina Hayden <http://georginahayden.com/apricot-jam/> wrote a book called 
Stirring Slowly this year, which is full of the kind of warming meals you just 
want to come home to on a cold night. She talks about food that heals. So you 
know what, let’s invite each other round to dinner. Let’s make lunchboxes for 
colleagues. Let’s bring cakes into offices and flapjacks into classrooms. Let’s 
take care of each other. Let’s eat together.
 
I interviewed photographers who’d taken pictures of Trump throughout his 
career, and it struck me just how malleable the president-elect is. One of the 
photographers, Chris Buck, described Trump as being very different in person 
from his bolshy public persona: gracious, funny, charming.


But another, Nigel Parry, said he was exactly the same as in public, that what 
you see is what you get. The two photos were admittedly taken a decade apart, 
but the disparity in their stories seems to suggest that Trump is even more 
chameleonic that we imagine, to the point of never having a stable version of 
himself: a man who makes up his life as he goes along, powered by a kind of 
barrelling narcissism and alpha-male presumptuousness.

among the student body, but as the returns rolled in, she wondered how of them 
must have be closet Trump fans.

I heard it talking to cultural critic Mikki Kendall, who looked at the strong 
support for Trump among white women – exit polls suggested53% of white women 
voted for Trump

 – and concluded that it was very difficult to say “that no one who was 
theoretically on the left voted for Trump.”

Trump’s win came as a shock to many Americans. They’re now wondering who 
supported him all along--and simply did not talk about it.


For some Americans, that’s a source of anxiety. At a protest in Chicago 
Thursday night, a young womantold the Washington Post 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/10/not-my-president-thousand-protest-trump-in-rallies-across-the-u-s/>
 that she was deeply upset by the people who had voted for Trump. “I see people 
differently now. I don’t smile at people on the street anymore. Because you 
never know,” she said.

Did British voters feel the same sense of shock that there might be closet 
Brexit supporters who had been around them all the time? Do you have any advice 
for Americans who are devastated by this outcome--the stages of mourning a 
Brexit?
