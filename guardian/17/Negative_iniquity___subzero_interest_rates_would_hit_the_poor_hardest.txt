You are correct when you say in your leader article (Negative interest rates: 
some positives but some minuses too 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/26/the-guardian-view-on-negative-interest-rates-positives-and-minuses>
, 27 July) that negative rates will affect Britons very differently. You are 
not right to assert that negative rates fall hardest on the rich. While the 
rich undoubtedly have the most to lose in monetary terms, it is those Britons 
eking out their miserly state pensions with small savings in building societies 
and other accounts who will suffer most. The small amount of interest derived 
from their savings can make the difference between abject poverty and actually 
living.
