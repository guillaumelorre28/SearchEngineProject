The 37-year-old wheelchair racer endured what he described as a “terrible” 
Paralympics <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics> at Rio last summer, 
missing out on a medal after having won four golds at London 2012.

He said in Brazil that Rio would be his final Paralympics and he would finish 
his career at the London Marathon on 23 April, rather than at July’s IPC 
athletics world championships at the London Stadium.

Weir also hinted at tensions with the national governing body but refused to 
discuss them. “I have been let down again,” Weir wrote on Twitter. “Today is 
the day I officially retire from GB I will never put a shirt on 
again.thanksBritishAthletics what a joke.”

In September, Weir claimed he had been “stabbed in the back a lot” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/18/david-weir-paralympics-rio-de-janeiro>
 and appeared to be directing his comments at British Athletics. Dame Tanni 
Grey-Thompson suggested the 37-year-old had felt isolated in the Team GB camp.

Weir added on Twitter on Tuesday: “I have just retired from GB I will still be 
at the London Marathon this year.”
