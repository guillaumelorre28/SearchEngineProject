For experienced skiers who have ticked off many of the resorts in the Alps, 
exotic skiing destinations renowned for their powder hold a special allure. 
Kashmir, Japan, Russia and Chile are among dream destinations but the ultimate 
edgy ski trip has to be to Iran.Tourism is growing at a stupendous rate

last summer.

Overnight snowfalls in excess of 50cm are not uncommon at its two main 
resorts, in the Alborz mountains north of Tehran. Shemshak is 2,550 metres 
high, and Dizin 2,650 metres, with slopes up to 3,500 metres, making it the 
highest resort in the country, with views of Iran’s tallest mountain: 
5,610-metre Damavand.

Sloping off: skiing in Iran

I picked Dizin for a day trip from Tehran in early December: a taxi takes 
about 90 minutes. Ali, a guide from new operatorToiran <http://www.toiran.com/> 
helped sort out equipment hire (just £8 a day) and a lift pass for £6. I 
yo-yoed up and down the French-built chairlifts and gondolas a few times and 
covered a good chunk of the ski area’s nine wide, long, rolling runs and 
powdery bowls, full of fantastic dry snow.

Men and women are segregated on the lifts but unite at the top and can share 
food and tiny tumblers of tea in the few cafes and restaurants.

Up here the Islamic dress code strictly enforced in Tehran is casually 
relaxed. I saw peroxide-blonde hair pouring from under woolly hats and forearms 
scandalously uncovered.

“Sometimes the gaste-ershad [morality police] come up here, but most are bad 
skiers so we can escape them,” said Soriah, from Tehran. At the foot of the 
slopes, she and her friends were drinking cans of non-alcoholic beer and 
smoking stubby Iranian-made Bahman cigarettes.

“You must have the ghormeh sabzi!” said Soriah, referring to Iran’s national 
dish of green herb and lamb stew, with sides of radishes, onions, gherkins, 
limes and mint. “In Tehran, I feel trapped,” she added. “I come to Dizin as 
much as I can in winter. I feel freer up here.”

After a couple of rounds of Iranian tea, served with lolly-like dipping sticks 
of crystalline yellow sugar, we stepped back into our skis.

Dizin’s pistes may be splendid, but it has no après ski at all – the Islamic 
Republic is not big on public nightlife anywhere. Most skiers avoid the cluster 
of sad-looking concrete hotels and head back to the capital after the slopes 
close.

On the way back, I stopped on the edge of the mountains an hour from Dizin in 
Darband. Once a village but now part of the fringes of northern Tehran, it has 
dozens of Persian-carpeted, open-air cafes, some on wooden platforms over the 
rivers that flow from the Alborz mountains on to the Tehran plateau below.

I ate garlic and lentil soup and beautifully cooked koobideh (minced lamb) 
kebabs, washed down withdoogh, a popular salted and minted yogurt drink. A boy 
was preparing tobacco in analyān, a variant of the Arabic hookah with a 
straight wooden pipe and an almost hysterically sorrowful old-time Persian tune 
played though the cafe’s crackling speakers. OK, I wasn’t doing vodka jelly 
shots with British seasonaires in Tignes but, for me, Darband’s après ski was a 
fine thing.
