But how does it work? How do we calculate which courses and campuses are the 
best? And how does our number-crunching differ from that of other guides?


The compiler of the tables, Matt Hiely-Rayner from Intelligent Metrix, will be 
on hand from12-2pm on Tuesday 24 May to answer all of your questions and 
explain the lengthy process of consultation, categorisation and calculation 
that goes in to creating the final list.

Take a look at our guide to using the tables 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/23/how-to-use-the-guardian-university-guide-2017>
 and – for the data-lovers – Hiely-Rayner’s detailedexplanation of the 
methodology 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/23/methodology-behind-the-guardian-university-guide-2017>
, including the changes made to the process for 2017. Then send us your
