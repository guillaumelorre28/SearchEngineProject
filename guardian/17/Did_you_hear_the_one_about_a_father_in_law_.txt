Guardian leaders used to find it impossible to mention Michael Gove without 
referring to his courtesy. Then came his laughably self-important implosion 
after the referendum, and it seemed we’d heard the last of this invisible 
trait. But now here’s Anne McElvoy, describing Gove as “intellectually 
respected” (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/theresa-may-brexit-compromise-tory-feuding-public>
, 3 January). The man who says that anyone whose views on education he 
disagrees with is“the blob” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/oct/02/michael-gove-referring-to-the-blob>
, and that“people in this country have had enough of experts” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote>
. Could Anne please name a few serious thinkers – well, one will do – who 
gratefully draw intellectual sustenance from Michael Gove?

• Maybe it’s my working-class origins, but I’d always thought that “earned” 
implies pay commensurate with the amount of work done. By what stretch of 
imagination did Sir Martin Sorrell “earn” more than £70m last year (In just 28 
hours, top bosses are paid more than a typical salary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/04/uk-bosses-will-make-more-by-midday-than-workers-will-earn-all-year-fat-cat-wednesday>
, 4 January)?

• I am ashamed of you, suggesting that “to get along with our mothers-in-law” 
is a typical New Year resolution (Editorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/the-guardian-view-on-new-year-resolutions-fitter-happier-more-productive>
, 4 January). We feminists are fed up that “mother-in-law” is still a standard 
joke. Where are the jokes about father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law?

• Reading Penny Pepper’s article on being able to get access to disabled 
toilets (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/disability-accessible-toilets-paralympian-train>
, 4 January) left me sympathetic and moved until I got to the part where she 
admitted that she had used them for a shag. Really? Sympathy out the window.

• Being ever playful with language, I don’t see why we shouldn’t allow a 
single kudo (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/30/family-chords-and-discord>, 
31 December). On growing my first ever crop of a single asparagu, I was 
delighted. It may even have engendered an applau.

• The postman wears shorts (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/03/why-bookies-workers-are-odds-on-to-lose-out>
, 4 January) because he has to run to do his job – like everyone else in the 
now privatised but former public sector.
