A Southern <https://www.theguardian.com/business/southern> train carriage 
being transported on a lorry caused delays for motorists when it became stuck 
at a crossroads in south-east London.

The carriage became wedged as it tried to navigate a tight corner in Crystal 
Palace on Wednesday night and held up traffic for half an hour, witness Luke 
Alexander said.

The incident happened at the junction of Gipsy Hill, Westow Hill, Westow 
Street and Central Hill at about 8.20pm.

Alexander, who works at a bar opposite the junction said he had gone outside 
after hearing a commotion. “I think the truck taking it had taken the wrong 
route and it had completely jammed itself on top of the crossroads,” he said.

“Everyone was finding it the most hilarious thing – including the truck 
drivers themselves who were trying to negotiate it through the crossroads.”

Alexander described the turning as a pretty tight squeeze and said at one 
point the carriage, which appeared damaged, was wedged against a traffic light.

The 25-year-old, who lives in Crystal Palace, said it was impossible not to 
see the “complete irony” of the situation. A ban on overtime by drivers on 
Southern has caused delays and cancellations for commuters, whileservices were 
halted for three days last week

 when members of Aslef went on strike. But Alexander said onlookers took the 
delay in “good spirit” and broke into huge applause when the lorry managed to 
turn the corner.
