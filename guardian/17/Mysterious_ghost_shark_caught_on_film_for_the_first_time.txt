American scientists surveying the depths of the ocean off the coast of 
California and Hawaii have unwittingly filmed the mysterious ghost shark for 
the first time.

The team from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Center 
<http://www.mbari.org/the-pointy-nosed-blue-chimaera-really-gets-around/> had 
sent a remote operated vehicle down to depths of 2,000 metres (6,700ft) when 
the creature appeared on their screens.

Also known as chimaeras, the creatures are related to sharks and rays. But 
unlike their namesakes, ghost sharks have tooth plates instead of teeth and 
open channels on their heads and faces that give them the appearance of having 
been stitched together like a rag doll.

Most remarkably perhaps, they have a retractable penis on their heads. 

Dave Ebert, program director for the Pacific Shark Research Center at Moss 
Landing Marine Laboratories toldNational Geographic 
<http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/pointy-nosed-blue-chimaeras-ghost-sharks/>
 that the discovery of the creature – proper name is Hydrolagus trolli – was 
“dumb luck”.

The footage was captured in 2009 but it has taken the team several years to 
confirm that the creature on the film is a type of ghost shark known as a 
pointy-nosed blue chimaera.

The species is usually found near Australia and New Zealand and has never been 
filmed alive in its natural habitat before. It is also believed to be the first 
time they have been seen in the northern hemisphere.
