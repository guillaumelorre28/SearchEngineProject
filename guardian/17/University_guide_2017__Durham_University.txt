self-catering which works out at £4,705 for the academic year (including 
induction week), though there are very few of these rooms. A more usual spec 
would be a single room with shared bathroom and self-catering which works out 
as £4,940. The most expensive are single, en-suite and catered (21 meals per 
week during term time) rooms which cost £7,353 for the academic year including 
induction week. Figures quoted refer to the year 2016-17, 2017/18 prices won’t
