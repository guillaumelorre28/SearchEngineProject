Fees £12,000 per year for full-time students from the UK, EU & EEA full-time 
students studying in the academic year 2017-18.


NCH is a private institution which means that most students from England, 
Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as EU nationals and those who have lived 
in the EEA or Switzerland can apply for a tuition fee loan of £6,000 from 
Student Finance.

For international students, fees are £19,750 per year. 

Scholarships NCH offers a select number of scholarships - including some named 
after individual members of its professoriate such as professor Richard Dawkins 
- to recognise exceptional academic potential and achievements. Each 
scholarship provides a subsidy of up to £2,000 towards the full tuition fees.


A list of scholarships available for the 2017-18 academic year can be found at 
nchlondon.ac.uk/scholarships <http://nchlondon.ac.uk/scholarships>.

Applicants from the UK, EU and EEA who are offered a place to study at at NCH 
– and who would be unable to attend the college without further financial 
support – can apply to the NCH Trust for a means-tested bursary to cover their 
tuition fees.

More information on bursaries can be found at nchlondon.ac.uk/bursaries 
<http://nchlondon.ac.uk/scholarships/#bursaries>.

International students can apply for a scholarship providing a subsidy of up 
to £6,000 towards the annual tuition fees.


Accommodation NCH recommends five accommodation sites to students, all of 
which are less than 25 minutes from the college. Prices range from £121 for a 
shared twin room in Bloomsbury to £500 a week for a Penthouse studio in Lambeth 
north.
