An ideological purity test to screen out immigrants with sympathies toward 
radical Islam has been proposed byDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> in a sharp escalation of what 
he claimed is a religious war with the west.

In a speech intended to refine his policies for combating Islamic State 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-fact-check-obama-isis-veterans-hillary-guns>
, the Republican presidential candidate insisted that such measures were 
necessary to stop its spread.

“We cannot let this evil continue,” Trump told a rally of supporters in Ohio. 
“Nor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam ... be allowed to spread 
within our own countries.”

The foreign policy address was billed by campaign officials as a return to a 
more presidential style from a candidate who has been buffeted in recent days by
collapsing poll numbers

.

But instead of softening his previously blunt language calling for an outright 
ban on Muslim immigration, Trump used the speech to emphasise what he claimed 
was a epoch-defining ideological struggle.

“Today we begin a conversation about how to make America safe again,” said the 
candidate as he compared the threat from radical Islamic terrorism to that of 
“Nazism” and communism and claimed it was a responsible for an attack outside 
the Middle East “war zone” every 84 hours this summer.

“France is suffering gravely,” he added as he listed all the recent terrorist 
attacks in Europe and the US in detail.

“Isis is on the loose. Isis has spread across the Middle East and into the 
west,” claimed Trump. “Today they are fully operational in 18 countries.”

Trump was introduced on stage by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who 
claimed that the threat of terrorism was terrifying travellers.

“I had a friend who left to go to London yesterday and he was afraid, afraid 
to go to London,” said Giuliani. “This is the world thatHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> created for us.”

“We didn’t start this war, they did,” added Giuliani. “And they started it to 
create a caliphate, to destroy the infidels ...”

Earlier, Hillary Clinton blasted Trump’s suitability as a candidate for 
commander in chief.

“He says: ‘I know more about Isis than the generals,’” said Clinton shaking 
her head, adding: “No, Donald, you don’t.

“He has the temerity to say that the United States military is a disaster,” 
she added.

But the hawkish new tone may help Trump restore some momentum to his flagging 
campaign.

Earlier, an editorial in the Wall Street Journal called on on him to “behave 
like a president or turn the nomination over to Mike Pence”.

But other Republicans have argued that they cannot change tack now. 
“Abandoning ship is not an option; the better option is to make sure that ship 
is sailing in the right direction,” Rick Santorum, a former Republican 
presidential candidate, told CNN on Monday.

Some in the party will hope that Trump’s emerging foreign policy doctrine will 
help distract from recent gaffes and draw sharp lines between their candidate 
and the policies of Clinton andBarack Obama

.

“It’s time to put the mistakes of the past behind us and chart a new course,” 
said Trump in his speech.

“If I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very 
swift and decisive end.”

But the most striking new aspect of the speech was likely to be draconian 
proposals to try to test the ideological persuasions of those entering the US.

“A new immigration policy is needed,” said Trump. “Clearly new screening 
procedures are needed.

“We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect 
our people.”

“In the cold war we had an ideological screening test ... The time is overdue 
for a new test. I call it extreme vetting,” he concluded.
