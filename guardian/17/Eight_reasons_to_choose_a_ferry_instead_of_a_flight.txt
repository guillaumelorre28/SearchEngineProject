Is the hassle of flying putting you off booking your next holiday? If you swap 
the skies for the sea there’s a raft of benefits to enjoy during your journey, 
as well as on holiday. Here are eight reasons why sailing with Brittany Ferries 
puts air travel in the shade.

Airport stress v easy check-in
Forget the endless queues, huge crowds, and labyrinthine check-in and security 
procedures. After showing Brittany Ferries boarding staff the tickets and 
passports – which doesn’t usually involve getting out of your car – simply 
drive on board.

Luggage restrictions v loading up
Most airlines restrict passengers to one piece of hold luggage (which has to 
be 23kg or less – expect additional fees if you’re over) and one piece of hand 
luggage. When you travel on a ferry there are no baggage restrictions, so you 
can take everything that fits into your car.

 Enjoy French cuisine created from fresh produce. 
Cramped v comfy quarters
You could strap yourself into a rigid airline seat – leg-room on an economy 
flight seat averages a measly 12 inches – or stretch your legs and explore the 
ship. Accommodation for overnight crossings ranges from standard two- and 
four-berth cabins to Commodore cabins – complete with a flat-screen TV, twin 
beds, a sofa bed and complimentary continental breakfast, served in your cabin.

Clock watching v movie watching
Time can really drag when you’re stuck in the same aeroplane seat, with 
limited views and free in-flight entertainment only available on long-haul 
flights. By contrast, as soon as you board Brittany Ferries your holiday 
starts. On-board entertainment includes live performances, stylish bars and 
movie theatres showing recent releases.

Airline food v French cuisine
As hard as they try to make meals tasty and exciting, airlines’ food is 
understandably limited. On board Brittany Ferries, French chefs create cuisine 
from fresh produce, much of it sourced locally from Brittany. Passengers can 
choose to dine in the a la carte or self-service restaurants, snack outlets or 
cafes, making their journey as smart or casual as they want … and not a tray 
table in sight.

Boredom v discovery
The reality of being stuck on a flight can soon take the edge off the kids’ 
excitement. Once the boredom threshold has been crossed, you could be in for a 
bumpy ride. On a ferry, they can explore play areas, games rooms, live 
entertainment and cinemas – and if you’re sailing on Brittany Ferries’ 
Pont-Aven or Cap Finistère, they can enjoy a splash in the onboard swimming 
pool.

Time-consuming transfers v your own set of wheels
Once a flight has finally touched down, there’s always further faffing with 
waiting for luggage, hire cars, taxis or a crowded transfer coach. Having your 
own car on a Brittany Ferries journey means you can travel onwards, rested and 
relaxed, all the way to your final destination in comfort.

Kennels v pet minders
Flying with pets is usually not an option. Brittany Ferries, however, offers 
its PETS travel scheme so you can holiday with your four-legged friends. As 
long as your pet has the relevant travel documentation, from just £16.50 your 
dog can sail with you on any Brittany Ferries route to France or Spain.
