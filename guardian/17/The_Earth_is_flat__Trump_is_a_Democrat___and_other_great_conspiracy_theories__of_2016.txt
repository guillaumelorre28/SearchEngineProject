If 2016 was the year facts didn’t matter, when Oxford Dictionaries declared we 
went “post-truth”, it makes sense that conspiracy theories flourished. These 
are some of the most outlandish (and, we feel fairly confident in saying, all 
untrue).

You might think that this one was put pretty conclusively to bed around 330BC, 
but it persists into 2016, championed by the radio-friendly rapper B.o.B.

The Atlanta musician resurrected the argument that the Earth may, in fact, be 
flat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/25/bob-rapper-flat-earth-twitter> 
with a storm of tweets in January that seemed to lean heavily on the fact the 
horizon appears straight in photos (“where is the curve? please explain this”).

Neil deGrasse Tyson’s public putdown prompted B.o.B. to release a diss track 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/26/flat-earth-rapper-bob-neil-degrasse-tyson-diss-track>
, which was not very good, but did show how far the bar has fallen when it

That was about the last time anyone spoke of B.o.B. in 2016.

Taylor Swift is a satanist

Taylor Swift’s similarity to the daughter of Anton Lavey, the founder of the 
Church of Satan, delighted social media this year, coinciding as it did withthe 
pop star’s “downfall”

Katy Perry is JonBenét Ramsey

This theory dates back to 2014 but resurfaced this year alongside a CBS 
documentary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/11/jonbenet-ramsey-the-brutal-child-that-still-haunts-america>
 about the girl’s murder.

In a video posted to YouTube, a truther refers persistently to “the Katy Perry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/katy-perry> character” (“You can see that 
that’s just an older JonBenét Ramsey, right? You can see that”) and puts 
forward the physical similarity between the two sets of parents as evidence 
(“same people”).

He then laboriously – and not entirely successfully, on a technical level – 
morphs Perry’s face with Ramsey’s.

 Embed ≠ endorsement. 
Never mind that Perry, born in 1984, would have been 12 when Ramsey died aged 
six in 1996. Other YouTubers taking up the theory have pointed out that, in 
photos, their eyebrows look similar.

 Perry has done nothing to address the rumours but did go paddle boarding with 
her new boyfriend, Orlando Bloom.

The theory – meme, joke, whatever – that the aspiring Republican presidential 
candidate was, in fact, the unknown killer operating in northern California in 
the late 1960s and early 1970s was inescapable on social media earlier this 
year, and eventually made its way into the real world.

Kylie Jenner is secretly fronting a pop band

The singer of the US pop trio Terror Jr is known only by the alias Lisa 
Terror, and hides her face behind her hair in promotional images. The only 
account the band follows on Twitter is that of Kylie Jenner: the teenage 
socialite/makeup mogul, a Kardashian by any other name.

In March, Jenner featured a song by Terror Jr in a promotional video for her 
lip glosses;that same day, Terror Jr launched its social media presences. (As 
far as conspiracy theories go, this one is admittedly low stakes.)

Jenner has denied being Lisa Terror on Snapchat, but then came the smoking 
gun: a Twitter userapparently found her 
<https://twitter.com/TylerMinear/status/795453163528683521> listed as a 
performer on the track 3 Strikes by a music licensing organisation.

The entry has since been amended, and when Teen Vogue put the theory to the 
band,it replied only with its trademark grape emoji 
<http://www.teenvogue.com/story/terror-jr-interview-bop-city-kylie-jenner>. But 
let’s be honest, it’s not like a Kardashian to shy from the spotlight.

This theory emerged on Reddit 
<https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5f6da8/justin_trudeau_is_actually_fidel_castros_son/>
 after the Canadian prime ministerraised eyebrows with his obituary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/27/justin-trudeau-ridiculed-over-praise-of-remarkable-fidel-castro>
 for the “remarkable leader” on Twitter.


User George_Rockwell said Trudeau’s parents had visited Cuba “on several 
occasions”, pointing to a photograph of Margaret Trudeau “happily allowing the 
tyrant to hold her four-month-old baby” as evidence. (Thebaby was, in fact, 
<http://gizmodo.com/no-thats-not-fidel-castro-holding-justin-trudeau-as-a-1789401371>
 Justin’s late brother Michel. Details, details.)

their two faces presented as “DAMNING EVIDENCE”.

Hillary Clinton is dead and was replaced by a surrogate

The theory that Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> had died was the logical 
extension of rumours of her ill health, and beloved by her detractors during 
the US election campaign.

YouTube user “Confederate Marshell” presented “100% PROOF” that Clinton had 
been dead since at least 11 September this year and replaced by CGI and 
multiple body doubles.

Hillary Clinton is running a child abuse ring from a pizza restaurant

You might want to be sitting down for this one: the Democratic presidential 
candidate and her campaign chief John Podesta are running a child sex ring from 
the backroom of the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in Washington.

A dinner party – or a possibly satanic ritual, 
<http://www.inquisitr.com/3759785/pizzagate-marina-abramovic-spirit-cooking/> 
depending on who you believe – thrown by theperformance artist Marina Abramović 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/04/marina-abramovic-podesta-clinton-emails-satanism-accusations>
 and a napkin with a “pizza-related” map on it are also involved.
🌟Homeboy Chris🌟 (@TheHomeboyChris)

Given that the fact the restaurant has the same initials as “child 
pornography” is put forward as evidence by believers, the truly shocking detail 
of this completely baseless conspiracy theory is that even one person believed 
it.

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/05/gunman-detained-at-comet-pizza-restaurant-was-self-investigating-fake-news-reports>
 the reports, wielding an assault rifle at a employee and firing it inside the

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/08/pizzagate-conspiracy-gunman-i-regret-how-i-handled-the-situation>
 he “wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way”. “I regret how I 
handled the situation,” he added.

That outlandish allegations posted to the online message board 4Chan and

Certainly there’s no subject it’s more vital that you “self-investigate” only 
on trusted news networks. Google “Pizzagate” and you’ll find websites such as 
“Truthlibrary.Info” that promise “all the facts in one spot” with the 
user-friendly advice: “WARNING: Turn away now if you do not want to be 
incredibly disturbed. This is real. Pay attention to ‘pizza’ and ‘cheese’ 
references throughout, as these are highly likely to be code.” (No, I’m not 
linking to it.)

Climate change is a hoax engineered by China, or maybe the UN


The president-elect of the US seems to subscribe to this one.

that global warming “was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US 
manufacturing non-competitive”.
