Out in Victoria, a short ferry hop from Vancouver in British Columbia, John 
Quilter finds a farm with a difference. This one is run by the owner of 10 
Acres Bistro, and he bought it to supply his restaurant. “It just makes sense,” 
he says simply, as though it were the most natural thing in the world.

In the video, city-boy Quilter discovers why electric fences are best left 
alone, why turkeys are proud, and why Nigerian dwarf goats are a great dairy 
breed. And then he samples the results. “Every single thing on the dinner plate 
comes from the farm,” says executive chef Marcelo Najarro.
