The Belief and Beyond Belief festival is made up of eight themed parts, 
focusing on the different elements and effects of belief in the 21st century – 
from death to morality to politics. Here are some highlights from the year to 
come ...

The Search for the Meaning of Life (16-28 January)

Stephen Hawking, 16 January

Mona Siddiqui: Does Struggle Give Life Meaning? 21 January
The opening weekend for Belief and Beyond Belief presents an array of talks 
including Edinburgh-based academic, writer and broadcaster Mona Siddiqui’s 
keynote address. She considers how Muslim and Christian thinkers have 
approached the topics of suffering and hope and whether we should accept 
struggle as an innate aspect of what it is to be human.

Losing My Religion: Faith and Doubt, 21 January
The former Bishop of Edinburgh, author and self-professed “after-religionist” 
Richard Holloway has written extensively on the relationship between religion 
and a range of contentious issues within contemporary life, such as sexuality, 
drugs and bioethics, beginning with 1981’s Beyond Belief. Here, he discusses 
his personal experience of religious doubt and provides a history of the search 
for different answers.

How to be a Shaman: Searching for Meaning in Indigenous Religion, 21 January
The world’s belief systems extend much further than just the major faiths and 
encompass thousands of lesser-known indigenous religions. Many still practised 
today are rooted in traditions that stretch back centuries, if not farther. A 
panel including award-winning journalist Abdul Rehman Malik considers the 
alternative perspectives and lessons that indigenous religions can present to 
us.

Beethoven’s Fidelio, 21 January
Conductor Vladimir Jurowski and the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) are 
joined by soprano Sofia Fomina and tenor Ben Johnson to perform Beethoven’s 
only opera – and his own favourite work. Fidelio is the tale of an innocent man 
facing death in captivity; it is also an escapade of disguises, love, faith and 
freedom.

Science versus Religion: Do We Need to Choose? (3–18 February)

Haydn’s The Creation, 4 Feburary
For Joseph Haydn, the thought of God inspired only the most uplifting music; 
his late-18th-century oratorio is renowned as a rousing masterpiece, evoking 
the creation of the universe – from its inception to flourishing life forms and 
a garden of Paradise. Conductor Sir Roger Norrington and the LPO summon all the 
joyous power of The Creation, with world-class vocalists Susan Gritton, Thomas 
Hobbs and Christopher Maltman performing the German-language libretto.

Marcus du Sautoy: God of the Gaps, 4 February
Marcus du Sautoy, professor of mathematics at the University of Oxford, hosts 
this Clore Ballroom discussion considering the outer limits of scientific 
exploration, from studies of origin and evolution to neuroscience. In the age 
of advanced scientific research, how do we explain the unknowable mysteries of 
the universe?

Alisa Weilerstein, 8 February
US virtuoso cellist Alisa Weilerstein brings her exceptional musicianship to a 
complete cycle of Johann Sebastian Bach’s groundbreaking suites for solo cello. 
Bach regularly inscribed his compositions with initials such as SDG – “Soli Deo 
Gloria” or “glory to God alone”. Through its complex mathematical precision and 
sophisticated beauty, Bach’s music is a clear manifestation of his belief in 
the divine.

John Adams’s Doctor Atomic Symphony – part of American Adventures, 11 February
Dr Atomic, the 2005 opera by US composer John Adams, heralds the dawn of the 
nuclear age, focusing on physicist J Robert Oppenheimer and the Trinity atomic 
bomb test of 1945. The symphony – inspired by a broad range of sources, 
including John Donne’s Holy Sonnets, Hindu epic the Bhagavad Gita, and 
declassified government documents – is performed here by the LPO, in a concert 
programme also including Philip Glass’s The Light, Charles Ives’s The 
Unanswered Question, and the UK premiere of Aaron J Kernis’s Flute Concerto.

How Do We Live with Death? (22 February–30 April)

Coffin Craft and Carnival, 4 March
Many cultures mark the end of life in vital, vibrant style – whether it’s 
Mexico’s colourful Day Of The Dead celebrations, lavish “fantasy coffin” 
craftworks from Ghana, or the irrepressibly brassy soundtracks of a New Orleans 
jazz funeral. Join this workshop to dream up and decorate a unique coffin 
design, and take part in the Coffin Carnival procession.

Krzysztof Penderecki talk and St Luke Passion, 4 March
The renowned Polish composer and conductor gives a free pre-concert talk, in 
conversation with Gillian Moore, director of music at Southbank Centre, ahead 
of the LPO’s performance of his 1966 masterpiece St Luke Passion – a work that 
achieved widespread acclaim at a time when the communist Polish government was 
opposed to religious expressions.

Dead Line, 4 March
Face your own fears, desires and dreams in life and death at this interactive 
event, which merges art installation and theatre performance. Participants are 
invited to openly address their mortality and ask others the soul-searching 
questions they might not dare to ask themselves – it’s a reflection from 
elsewhere, if not a voice from the other side.

Primo Levi’s If This Is A Man, 30 April
If This Is A Man, the Italian-Jewish writer Primo Levi’s formidable account of 
survival in Auschwitz, turns 70 next year. To celebrate the anniversary of its 
publication, a full text reading by award-winning novelist AL Kennedy, and 
barrister, writer and University College London professor of law Philippe Sands 
will be held at the Royal Festival Hall.

Prophets, Visionaries and Power (8–30 April)

Separation Of Powers: God in Politics, 8 April
Faith can be a mighty force – and it is entwined with political power in many 
nations east and west, whether in countries that adopt a definition of Sharia 
law, or those with Christian-led political parties. This panel of religious 
leaders and commentators discuss and debate whether religious beliefs have any 
place in political life, and whether core faith values can have a positive 
effect on society. Participants include Sayed Razawi, a government adviser on 
religious affairs and director of the Scottish Shia Muslim organisation Ahlul 
Bayt, and Indarjit Singh, a member of the House of Lords and key figure in Sikh 
and interfaith activities.

When Politics Meets Religion: Power & Faith, 8 April
Turkish author and academic Elif Safak, whose work spans eastern and western 
traditions, will investigate recent events in her homeland in this keynote 
address, including the unsuccessful coup d’etat against President Erdogan, as 
well as examining the role of faith in our political systems.

Strauss’s Four Last Songs with Angel Blue, 28 April
Internationally acclaimed US soprano Angel Blue brings her rich range to this 
LPO concert, performing Richard Strauss’s final compositions (written in 1948, 
a year before the composer’s death, aged 85). Its songs settle on the subject 
of mortality and acceptance, and form part of a programme of classical music 
exploring belief and the search for transcendence.

With God on our Side: Religion and War (3–15 November)

Karen Armstrong OBE: Is Religion Inherently Violent? 4 November
British religious historian, commentator and former nun Karen Armstrong OBE 
has written extensively on the subject of faith and conflict, including her 
books Holy War: The Crusades And Their Impact On Today’s World, and Fields Of 
Blood: Religion And The History Of Violence. She is also a noted voice for 
peace and tolerance. In this keynote address, Armstrong challenges the notion 
that religion is essentially violent.

AC Grayling: Can War Ever Be Justified? 5 November
Philosopher and vice-president of the British Humanist Association AC Grayling 
discusses his latest book, War, and debates whether military action can ever 
have a moral justification if human rights are at stake. He explores how 
warfare has changed in response to technology and questions if any war 
committed in the name of faith can be justified.

Sunday Assembly, 5 November
Founded by comedians Sanderson Jones and Pippa Evans in London in 2013, this 
secular congregation presents a heartfelt alternative to the traditional Sunday 
assembly, and now embraces more than 70 different communities in cities around 
the world. Here, it hosts a lunchtime get-together that aims to celebrate life, 
under its core motto: “Live Better, Help Often and Wonder More.”

Colm Tóibín: The Testament Of Mary, 16 December

the perspective of Jesus’s mother Mary for The Testament Of Mary, his 
Booker-shortlisted novel and play. In this work, Tóibín charts Mary’s later 
life, as a mother mourning the loss of her son, and as someone who may have 
also prayed to pagan gods of the period, such as Apollo.
