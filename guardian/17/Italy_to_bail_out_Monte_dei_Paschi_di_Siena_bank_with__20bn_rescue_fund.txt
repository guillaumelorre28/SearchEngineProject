A €20bn (£17bn) rescue fund for Italy’s banking sector has been approved by 
the country’s parliament, heralding a bailout of the world’s oldest bank, Monte 
dei Paschi di Siena (MPS).

The bank said late on Wednesday that it had failed to secure an anchor 
investor – the Qatar sovereign wealth fund – for a €5bn offer of new shares.

Despite announcing on Wednesday night that a debt-for-equity swap offer raised 
slightly over €2bn – part of acomplex fundraising exercise intended to bolster 
the strength of the bank

 – the failure to persuade a major investor to contribute €1bn meant the rescue 
plan would not succeed before it closed at 2pm on Thursday.

Italy's political class should be very alarmed if MPS needs state bailout

Shares in the bank, Italy’s third largest, gyrated wildly in Wednesday’s 
trading session, plunging 18% to record lows before closing 12% lower amid 
rumours that the fundraising effort would fail.

“The idea that Qatar could be an anchor investor has vanished and without an 
anchor investor there is no demand from anyone else,” one source told Reuters.


With MPS now likely to miss an end-of-year deadline imposed by the European 
Central Bank <https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> to 
raise fresh funds, the Italian government was expected to step in, possibly as 
soon as Thursday, and increase its 4% stake in the bank.

Led by prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, the government is now expected to 
force private investors owning about €2.1bn of the bank’s bonds to take losses.
Gentiloni was propelled into the role after Matteo Renzi resigned

 following the referendum defeat earlier this month that sparked fresh 
political turmoil and deterred investors from backing the fundraising.

Piercarlo Padoan, the finance minister, told parliament that the government’s 
proposed €20bn bailout would have a minimal impact on savers, in comments that 
sought to assuage the concerns of retail investors.

Padoan said: “This measure reinforces the ability of the Italian system to 
grow and consolidate itself and this growth will be a further element that 
helps banks’ balance sheets.”


He said that the impact on savers “if there was an intervention, would 
absolutely be minimised or non-existent”.

The implications of a government bailout stretch beyond Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, the eurozone’s third largest economy 
which is already running a debt to GDP ratio of more than 130%. It will be a 
major test of the new EU rules requiring bond holders to take losses before 
taxpayer money can be injected into banks. It will also be used as barometer 
for how the government will tackle the problem inside its banking sector, laden 
down with €360bn of bad debts.


Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: “Banking concerns have 
played across European markets once again today, as Monte dei Paschi looks set 
for a government takeover. The rescue plan has fallen apart, with Rome unable 
to find an anchor investor; for understandable reasons, no one wants to be 
first ‘over the top’ should the crisis worsen.”

The bank was instructed to find more capital after it was the weakest in a 
health check earlier this year on 51 European banks

.

Its struggle to boost its capital appeared to have an impact on its day-to-day 
funding as it warned its liquidity position – assets it can use immediately – 
was falling sharply. By April, it could breach regulatory minimums, reports 
said.

It was not immediately clear how much of the €20bn approved by the Italian 
government would be used for MPS, one of many banks which are in need of fresh 
funds. There were doubts about whether the €20bn would be a large enough sum to 
tackle Italy’s problem banks, which have accumulated bad debts as the economy 
stagnated. Eight years after the financial crisis, economic output remains 8% 
down on its pre-crash level.

Renzi had been attempting to tackle the problem before he resigned after 
losing the referendum he had called on constitutional reform. Hehad set up a 
€4.25bn backstop fund – known as Altante 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/10/battle-prop-up-italy-banks-eu-brexit-grexit-bad-loans>
 – which was backed by the major lenders and intended to be used to help 
troubled banks. It has a role in the MPS situation as it was involved in 
hoovering up bad loans in a clean-up exercise.
