Taboo

London, 1814. In top hat and trench coat, Tom Hardy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-hardy> is every inch the anti-Poldark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/poldark>. He plays James Keziah 
Delaney, an irascible renegade last seen on a slave ship in Africa and long 
presumed dead, who shows up at his father’s funeral. It’s a gruff gothic 
thriller, hooking us in with sordid rumours, gravediggers and supernatural 
visions. Co-written by Hardy with his dad, Chips, and produced byRidley Scott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ridley-scott>.

Chewing Gum

At the Baftas last year, the Beyoncé-loving acting-and-writing sensation 
Michaela Coel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/04/michaela-coel-chewing-gum-e4-comedy-series-men-and-sex>
 accepted her award for best female comedy performance wearing a gown her mum 
made – then gave a speech thanking her hero,Victoria Wood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/victoria-wood>, and encouraging black 
women to embrace their comedy, their beauty and the power of their voices. Coel 
has certainly found hers: there’s nothing else like Chewing Gum. Set on a 
council estate, it stars Coel as the naive Tracey, who falls in love with a 
white boy called Connor, then gets kicked out of her strict mum’s house. At 
series end, the pair were wandering off across the estate, in their pants, 
carrying binbags full of their belongings. You should watch this show.

Apple Tree Yard

What starts out as a simple, reckless mid-life affair between a genetic 
scientist named Yvonne (Emily Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/emily-watson>) and a Westminster paper pusher 
(Ben Chaplin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chaplin>) takes an intriguing 
turn when she realises he’s a spook – then suddenly gets very dark indeed. A 
provocative study of obsession, longing and just how far down a criminal path 
desire can take you.
