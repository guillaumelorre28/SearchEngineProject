An Australian family who went missing at a popular Japanese ski field have 
been found safe and well, local tourist officials have said.

Police and rescuers on snowmobiles set out at 7.15 local time on Tuesday 
morning and located the family about an hour and a half later, an official at 
the Nagano prefectural government told the Guardian. The three sons were 
located at 8.40 am, and their mother six minutes later.

A spokesman for the Nagano prefectural police said the family were being taken 
by ambulance to a nearby hospital. None of the four, whose names have not been 
released, is believed to have been seriously injured.

 that the family had been rescued near the top of the mountain.

“Missing family found and are all well in Nozawa Onsen,” its account tweeted 
on Tuesday. “Great news and a strong message to everyone to take care in the 
mountains.”

The woman in her 50s and her three sons, believed to be aged between 10 and 
their 20s, had failed to return after skiing or snowboarding away from marked 
trails on Mount Kenashi, the Mainichi newspaper reported.

They were unable to descend from the 1,649m mountain, where snow up to 1.32m 
thick had fallen by Monday night, with temperatures dropping as low as -10C.

They reportedly dug themselves into a snow hole to see out the night and were 
able to make contact with relatives on Facebook.

The family had set out from Nozawa Onsen, near the west coast of Japan’s main 
island.

A local weather report on Sunday said the snow was deeper than head-high in 
parts, after a severe blizzard.

“Don’t head off-piste as there are some extremely unstable layers and the 
likelihood of becoming stuck is an almost certainty,” the report on the Nozawa 
Onsen Guide website said.
