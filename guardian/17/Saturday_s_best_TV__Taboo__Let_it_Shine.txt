Taboo 
9.15pm, BBC1

The Tom Hardy-starring drama continues. In tonight’s episode, Delaney (Hardy) 
continues to make preparations for his new venture by buying a ship, settling 
his father’s debts and breathing heavily near his half-sister (Oona Chaplin). 
It’s all a bit overcooked in a Peaky Blinders vein. Still, while it’s no great 
change to see Hardy playing a person who growls a lot and has done bad things, 
he remains supremely watchable. Look out for Mark Gatiss and Scroobius Pip, too.

Let It Shine 
7pm, BBC1

Week two of Gary Barlow’s quest to find the next Gary Barlows to star in a 
musical loosely based on the career of, erm, Gary Barlow. With the able likes 
of Nicky, Clinton and Jason through to the next round, it’s time for Gaz, 
Martin Kemp, Amber Riley and Dannii Minogue to choose from a new batch of 
blokes. A fun spin on the talent search, and a formidable foe for ITV’s The 
Voice, even if Barlow’s omnipresence does occasionally verge on parody.Hannah J 
Davies

Ninja Warrior UK 
7pm, ITV

The climax of each Ninja Warrior tournament features plucky finalists in peak 
physical condition tackling the skyscraper scaffolding of Mount Midoriyama. 
This third series is still very much in the wheat-from-chaff stages, though, 
which means a parade of eccentrics inexpertly tackling the introductory assault 
course. A man cosplaying Lara Croft, the UK’s shortest bodybuilder and a 
64-year-old grandmother from Scarborough are among tonight’s hopefuls.Graeme 
Virtue

Imagine: Listen To Me Marlon 
9pm, BBC2

Pieced together from hundreds of hours of audio diaries and home-movie 
footage, Stevan Riley’s award-winning 2015 documentary gives us Brando’s story 
in his own words – as close to the mercurial, mischievous, tragedy-riven icon 
as we’re likely to get. For a man so deeply ambivalent about his own craft, he 
doesn’t half bang on about it; finally conceding sagely that “acting is just 
making stuff up, but that’s OK – life is a rehearsal.”Ali Catterall

Celebrity Big Brother 
10.30pm, Channel 5 

If you like watching celebrities you’ve only half heard of arguing about air, 
water and everything in between, then CBB will be a highlight of TV’s 
reality-heavy schedule. This series has already seen many a desperate moment 
from the tetchy housemates, who appear to be playing up more than ever. Of 
course, for every horrific Speidi there’s a harmless but irksome Jedward or an 
affable Calum Best, but the overall effect is the stuff of nightmares.Hannah

The Dengineers 
8.25am, CBBC

For those who think children today spend altogether too much time staring at 
screens, here’s hope. Dengineers, presented by Lauren Layfield and Mark Wright, 
follows projects to create dens, safe spaces where youngsters can, providing 
the home wifi extends far enough, erm, stare at screens without being nagged. 
This week, 11-year-old Whitney, a keen recycler who takes a bin bag everywhere 
she goes to collect any rubbish she encounters, wants to construct an “eco-den”.

Discovering Music 
9pm, Sky Arts

This double bill first introduces us to a little Dublin group named U2, who 
transcended their local post-punk scene to become one of the biggest bands of 
the last 40 years, their epic rock coupled with the philanthropic intentions of 
lead singer Bono. We then learn all about the Eagles, soft rockers responsible 
for Hotel California. To have not yet discovered either of these bands would 
make you either desperately incurious or very young but, if so, this is the 
series for you.David Stubbs

 The Charge of the Light Brigade Photograph: Woodfall/REX/Shutterstock 
(Tony Richardson, 1968) Saturday, 2.30pm, Movies4Men
Richardson’s swinging 60s account of the Battle of Balaclava in the 1854 
Crimean war overruns the unquestioned valour of the cavalry charge with 
political satire: this is very much about horsemen being led by donkeys. David 
Hemmings, fresh from the success of Blow-Up, is an anachronistic presence as 
rebellious Captain Nolan, but it is otherwise richly, coarsely evocative, with 
professional crusties Trevor Howard, John Gielgud and Harry Andrews superb as 
the old duffers presiding over one of the greatest blunders in British military 
history.Paul Howlett

Red River
(Howard Hawks, 1948), 4pm, ITV4
One of the great westerns: Red River is an epic, Oedipal tale acted out on the 
cattle trail. John Wayne’s Dunson is an old westerner clinging to outmoded 
values. Only a final confrontation with his adopted son (Montgomery Clift, in a 
stunning debut) offers hope of redemption. It’s packed with action and 
colourful characters, from Walter Brennan’s toothless Groot to Joanne Dru’s 
tough Tess; and it’s photographed with Fordian grandeur by Russell Harlan.PH

Oblivion
(Joseph Kosinski, 2013), 9pm, Channel 4
Like humanoid WALL-Es, Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough are monitoring a 
desolate Earth, overseeing defences against alien scavengers as the human race 
embarks on a new life on one of Saturn’s moons. It’s a gloomy (though 
beautifully designed) dystopia, and derivative (Cruise is haunted by 
Solaris-like memories), yet it’s a curiously compelling sci-fi drama.PH

Friends With Benefits
(Will Gluck, 2011), 9pm, E4
A formulaic but fun romcom that takes a couple – sexy Manhattan execs Justin 
Timberlake and Mila Kunis – and chucks them into a sex-without-commitment 
relationship, then sits back to watch wave after wave of cliches wash them 
towards Happy Ever After Land. Likable enough, in its manipulative way.PH
