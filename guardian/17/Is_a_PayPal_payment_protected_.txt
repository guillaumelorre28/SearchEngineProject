I’m thinking of booking a villa in Spain for a week in July. It’s advertised 
through a third-party website and I am advised that payment to the owner can be 
made by credit card usingPayPal <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/paypal>.

Can you advise what protection is afforded to me if I choose to use this 
method.JH, Gloucester

You are wise to ask, for the fact is you lose vital protection by using a 
credit card to pay by PayPal. Generally speaking, if you pay £100 or more for 
an item or a service you are shielded by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
if the transaction goes awry. This holds the card issuer jointly liable should 
the seller refuse to refund you and enables you to claim your money back via 
the bank.

Furthermore, if the card company refuses to cough up, you can take your case 
to the Financial Ombudsman Service rather than having to rely on the small 
claims court.

However, section 75 doesn’t apply if you pay a third-party agent such as 
PayPal, Amazon third-party sellers or a travel agent. Although PayPal will 
appear as the merchant on your credit card statement, it is merely an 
intermediary charged with passing your money on.

PayPal does offer its own protection, but this is not enshrined in law, nor is 
it as all embracing as Section 75. Decisions are taken solely at PayPal’s 
discretion and there is a 180-day time limit on filing a claim. You should, 
therefore, insist that you make the payment direct to the property owner via 
credit card.
