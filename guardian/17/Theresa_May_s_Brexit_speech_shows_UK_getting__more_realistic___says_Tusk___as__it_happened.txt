Sturgeon says May's speech has made second independence referendum more likely

Severin Carrell

Nicola Sturgeon has suggested Theresa May’s decision to press for a hard 
Brexit has made it “more likely” a further Scottish independence referendum 
will be held, since the prime minister seemed to have ignored Sturgeon’s effort 
to reach a compromise deal on Scotland’s continued membership of the single 
market.

Accusing May of pandering to the hard right of the Tory party, Sturgeon said 
it should be “crystal clear [that] the Tory government cannot be allowed to act 
against Scotland’s wishes and our interests, and [to] reject all attempts at 
compromise.”

But in a carefully-worded reaction to May’s speech, the first minister avoided 
using the word referendum or independence, stating instead:

The UK government cannot be allowed to take us out of the EU and the single 
market, regardless of the impact on our economy, jobs, living standards and our 
reputation as an open, tolerant country, without Scotland having the ability to 
choose between that and a different future.

With her comments today, the prime minister has only succeeded in making that 
choice more likely.

 Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, said May had actually accepted a 
number of Sturgeon’s demands. May’s “clear and reasonable plan” included free 
trade with the EU, protecting EU citizens residency and workers rights in the 
UK, increasing Holyrood powers, and protecting cross-border cooperation on 
crime fighting.

 “Nicola Sturgeon should now rule a second referendum out and instead work to 
get the best deal out of Brexit for all of us across the UK,” Davidson said.

David Davis says May's speech is the Brexit "plan" promised by the government

In the Commons David Davis has just effectively confirmed that Theresa May’s 
speech today is the government’s Brexit “plan” promised at the end of last year.
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/07/brexit-debate-plan-labour-pmqs-call-for-government-to-publish-its-brexit-plan-politics-live?page=with:block-584856cfe4b08659393b9dfc#block-584856cfe4b08659393b9dfc>
Asked if the government would be publishing a more detailed plan, he said he 
promised to publish a plan as soon as possible “and that’s what we’ve done”.

This suggests that Davis has been over-ruled to some extent. At the end of 
last yearhe told MPs that he would not be publishing the plan until February at 
the earliest because, until then, he would not know what he could include.

Downing Street has also been saying that today’s speech is the Brexit plan.

Keir Starmer's response to Theresa May - Analysis

Here is the quote from Sir Keir Starmer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/keir-starmer>, the shadow Brexit secretary, 
where he said Theresa May was ruling out hard Brexit at this stage. He was 
speaking in the Commons just a few minutes ago.

For many months we in Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
have been demanding the fullest possible access to the single market, 
emphasising the risks of leaving the customs union, arguing for a collaborative 
relationship with our EU partners, emphasising the need for transitional 
arrangements and the need for entrenchment of workers’ rights. Today the prime 
minister has rightly accepted these in her plan. I acknowledge that.

She has given little detail about how that is to be achieved and there are 
some unanswered questions and some big gaps. It is, in truth, a half-in, 
half-out plan.

Let me give an example. The prime minister says that she does not want the 
jurisdiction of the European court of justice. But she wants a comprehensive 
trade agreement. Sooner or later she and others will have to face up to the 
fact that any such agreement will have a disputes resolution clause and that 
will have to be independent of this country. It will not be by reason and 
resolution in the high court in London, according to English laws.

But, if the prime minister achieves all she has set out to achieve, she will 
fall short of hard Brexit that many in business and trade unions have feared, a 
Brexit of no deal, a bare trade agreement, out of any customs union and arms 
length with our EU relations. And it is good that she has ruled that hard 
Brexit out at this stage.

When governments make announcements, oppositions often have to choose between 
highlighting the attractive features, and notching it up as an opposition 
“win”, or highlighting the unattractive features and going on the attack. 
Starmer seems to have opted for the former approach. But it is an odd decision, 
for at least three reasons.

1) Starmer’s interpretation, that May has “ruled ... hard Brexit out at this 
stage”, is not a view shared by a lot of leftish, pro-European opinion.

2) His semi-positive response to what May said it quite different from the 
responses from his party leader, Jeremy Corbyn (see1.49pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e207ce4b01065cf5975e7#block-587e207ce4b01065cf5975e7>
 or Glenis Willmott, the leader of Labour MEPs (see1.59pm). 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e22dbe4b0f0efb00f4cd0#block-587e22dbe4b0f0efb00f4cd0>
 They are not contradictory in content (and, like Corbyn, Starmer was very 
critical of the threat to turn to the UK into a low-tax, US-style economy). But 
they were contradictory in tone.

3) May’s speech fails to meet at least two of the five conditions Starmer 
himself set for an acceptable Brexit plan in December last year. The five 
conditions arehere.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/07/brexit-debate-plan-labour-pmqs-call-for-government-to-publish-its-brexit-plan-politics-live?page=with:block-58483705e4b06a0d55b187ec#block-58483705e4b06a0d55b187ec>
Starmer said the government’s plan should contain enough details for the Office 
for Budget Responsibility to be able to make forecasts on the basis of it, and 
enough details to satisfy Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that their 
concerns have been met. May’s speech does not meet these tests. Arguably it 
does not meet the others either.

Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, has 
accusedTheresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> of turning 
her party into “Ukip-lite”. He said:

On the same day that the leader of the world’s largest communist party 
publicly lectures the world on the virtues of free trade, Theresa May has 
finally turned her back on Margaret Thatcher’s greatest economic achievement, 
the world’s largest borderless single market. It’s an astonishing mutation from 
Conservative into Ukip-light.

By siding with Donald Trump and against Angela Merkel, Theresa May has made it 
inevitable that the rest of the EU will react by safeguarding the integrity of 
the EU itself. Throwing the gauntlet down against the rest ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, the PM is virtually 
guaranteeing that acrimony rather than compromise will prevail.


The prime minister has pledged to act in the interests of the young and future 
generations. Yet she has now set herself on a course which emphatically rejects 
what the overwhelming majority of young voters said they wanted in the Brexit 
referendum. Claiming to represent the interests of the young whilst pursuing a 
hard Brexit which will damage their interests will only deepen the generational 
divide highlighted by the Brexit referendum. This speech is a kick in the teeth 
for the youth of Britain.

Here is Glenis Willmott, the leader of Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MEPs, on Theresa May’s speech.

So now we know: Theresa May has given up on the single market before 
negotiations have even begun, whatever the cost - the cost in jobs, the cost in 
trade, the cost to our economy. Britain is leaving theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, but the choices about how we leave will 
sit with Theresa May and the government - and this looks like a Tory plan that 
will make most people poorer.

And despite all of this, we still don’t have clarity on what she actually 
wants to achieve in terms of our future trading relationship withEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. So despite the all the talk we 
still face uncertainty, putting even more jobs at risk.

Starmer says May has effectively ruled out hard Brexit

In the Commons Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is responding to 
David Davis <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis>. He says Theresa 
May should have made her speech in the Commons. That is not just a convention, 
he says. That is so MPs can question her on behalf of their constituents.

He says Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> has been arguing 
for the best possible access to the single market and for the rights of EU 
nationals in Britain to be protected. May has accepted that, he says.

He says she is effectively offering a half-in, half-out solution.

If Britain has a free trade deal, there will have to be a mechanism for 
avoiding disputes.

He says May has effectively ruled out a hard Brexit. That is good, he says.

 * Starmer says May has effectively ruled out hard Brexit. 
He welcomes the fact that May has offered MPs a vote on the final deal.

But the threat to change the UK’s economic model if the UK does not get a good 
deal is a very serious one, he says. He says there would be no mandate for 
this. It would be “an act of huge self-harm for the UK”, he says. And he says 
this is incompatible with what May said about wanting to protect workers’ 
rights.

Jennifer Rankin

Many in continental Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
will see Theresa May’s speech as thinly-veiled threat to turn the UK into a tax 
haven.Philippe Lamberts, the co-chair of the Green group in the European 
parliament, described the speech as “a slap in the face for those who want to 
establish the new UK-EU relationship in a way that would preserve not only 
economic co-operation, but many other positive elements of the European social, 
environmental and legal acquis.”

He added: “It also risks painful consequences for the British people, many of 
whom would suffer deeply under a low-tax, low-regulation agenda.”

Corbyn accuses May of wanting to turn UK into 'bargain basement tax haven'

Jeremy Corbyn has put out a statement about Theresa May’s speech accusing her 
of wanting to turn the UK into a “bargain basement tax haven”. He said:

Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has made clear 
that she is determined to use Brexit to turn Britain into a bargain basement 
tax haven on the shores of Europe. She makes out this is a negotiating threat 
to the 27 EU countries but it’s actually a threat to the British people’s jobs, 
services and living standards.

We welcome that the prime minister has listened to the case we’ve been making 
about the need for full tariff free access to the single market but are deeply 
concerned about her reckless approach to achieving it.

This speech should have been given in parliament where MPs could ask her 
questions on behalf of their constituents. She talks about Brexit restoring 
parliamentary sovereignty but, once again, she is determined to avoid real 
scrutiny of her plans.

Nicola Sturgeon has suggested Theresa May’s decision to press for a hard 
Brexit has made it “more likely” a further Scottish independence referendum 
will be held, since the prime minister seemed to have ignored Sturgeon’s effort 
to reach a compromise deal on Scotland’s continued membership of the single 
market.

Accusing May of pandering to the hard right of the Tory party, Sturgeon said 
it should be “crystal clear [that] the Tory government cannot be allowed to act 
against Scotland’s wishes and our interests, and [to] reject all attempts at 
compromise.”

But in a carefully-worded reaction to May’s speech, the first minister avoided 
using the word referendum or independence, stating instead:

The UK government cannot be allowed to take us out of the EU and the single 
market, regardless of the impact on our economy, jobs, living standards and our 
reputation as an open, tolerant country, without Scotland having the ability to 
choose between that and a different future.

With her comments today, the prime minister has only succeeded in making that 
choice more likely.

 Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, said May had actually accepted a 
number of Sturgeon’s demands. May’s “clear and reasonable plan” included free 
trade with the EU, protecting EU citizens residency and workers rights in the 
UK, increasing Holyrood powers, and protecting cross-border cooperation on 
crime fighting.

 “Nicola Sturgeon should now rule a second referendum out and instead work to 
get the best deal out of Brexit for all of us across the UK,” Davidson said.

In the Commons David Davis has just effectively confirmed that Theresa May’s 
speech today is the government’s Brexit “plan” promised at the end of last year.
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/07/brexit-debate-plan-labour-pmqs-call-for-government-to-publish-its-brexit-plan-politics-live?page=with:block-584856cfe4b08659393b9dfc#block-584856cfe4b08659393b9dfc>
Asked if the government would be publishing a more detailed plan, he said he 
promised to publish a plan as soon as possible “and that’s what we’ve done”.

This suggests that Davis has been over-ruled to some extent. At the end of 
last yearhe told MPs that he would not be publishing the plan until February at 
the earliest because, until then, he would not know what he could include. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/14/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-david-davis-and-jeremy-corbyn-prepare-for-last-pmqs-of-2016-politics-live?page=with:block-58516ea4e4b09ee2001e8b52#block-58516ea4e4b09ee2001e8b52>

Downing Street has also been saying that today’s speech is the Brexit plan.
 
Here is the quote from Sir Keir Starmer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/keir-starmer>, the shadow Brexit secretary, 
where he said Theresa May was ruling out hard Brexit at this stage. He was 
speaking in the Commons just a few minutes ago.

For many months we in Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
have been demanding the fullest possible access to the single market, 
emphasising the risks of leaving the customs union, arguing for a collaborative 
relationship with our EU partners, emphasising the need for transitional 
arrangements and the need for entrenchment of workers’ rights. Today the prime 
minister has rightly accepted these in her plan. I acknowledge that.

She has given little detail about how that is to be achieved and there are 
some unanswered questions and some big gaps. It is, in truth, a half-in, 
half-out plan.

Let me give an example. The prime minister says that she does not want the 
jurisdiction of the European court of justice. But she wants a comprehensive 
trade agreement. Sooner or later she and others will have to face up to the 
fact that any such agreement will have a disputes resolution clause and that 
will have to be independent of this country. It will not be by reason and 
resolution in the high court in London, according to English laws.

But, if the prime minister achieves all she has set out to achieve, she will 
fall short of hard Brexit that many in business and trade unions have feared, a 
Brexit of no deal, a bare trade agreement, out of any customs union and arms 
length with our EU relations. And it is good that she has ruled that hard 
Brexit out at this stage.

When governments make announcements, oppositions often have to choose between 
highlighting the attractive features, and notching it up as an opposition 
“win”, or highlighting the unattractive features and going on the attack. 
Starmer seems to have opted for the former approach. But it is an odd decision, 
for at least three reasons.

1) Starmer’s interpretation, that May has “ruled ... hard Brexit out at this 
stage”, is not a view shared by a lot of leftish, pro-European opinion.

2) His semi-positive response to what May said it quite different from the 
responses from his party leader, Jeremy Corbyn (see1.49pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e207ce4b01065cf5975e7#block-587e207ce4b01065cf5975e7>
 or Glenis Willmott, the leader of Labour MEPs (see1.59pm). 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e22dbe4b0f0efb00f4cd0#block-587e22dbe4b0f0efb00f4cd0>
 They are not contradictory in content (and, like Corbyn, Starmer was very 
critical of the threat to turn to the UK into a low-tax, US-style economy). But 
they were contradictory in tone.

3) May’s speech fails to meet at least two of the five conditions Starmer 
himself set for an acceptable Brexit plan in December last year. The five 
conditions arehere.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/07/brexit-debate-plan-labour-pmqs-call-for-government-to-publish-its-brexit-plan-politics-live?page=with:block-58483705e4b06a0d55b187ec#block-58483705e4b06a0d55b187ec>
Starmer said the government’s plan should contain enough details for the Office 
for Budget Responsibility to be able to make forecasts on the basis of it, and 
enough details to satisfy Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that their 
concerns have been met. May’s speech does not meet these tests. Arguably it 
does not meet the others either.
 
Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, has 
accusedTheresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> of turning 
her party into “Ukip-lite”. He said:

On the same day that the leader of the world’s largest communist party 
publicly lectures the world on the virtues of free trade, Theresa May has 
finally turned her back on Margaret Thatcher’s greatest economic achievement, 
the world’s largest borderless single market. It’s an astonishing mutation from 
Conservative into Ukip-light.

By siding with Donald Trump and against Angela Merkel, Theresa May has made it 
inevitable that the rest of the EU will react by safeguarding the integrity of 
the EU itself. Throwing the gauntlet down against the rest ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, the PM is virtually 
guaranteeing that acrimony rather than compromise will prevail.


The prime minister has pledged to act in the interests of the young and future 
generations. Yet she has now set herself on a course which emphatically rejects 
what the overwhelming majority of young voters said they wanted in the Brexit 
referendum. Claiming to represent the interests of the young whilst pursuing a 
hard Brexit which will damage their interests will only deepen the generational 
divide highlighted by the Brexit referendum. This speech is a kick in the teeth 
for the youth of Britain.

 
Here is Glenis Willmott, the leader of Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MEPs, on Theresa May’s speech.

So now we know: Theresa May has given up on the single market before 
negotiations have even begun, whatever the cost - the cost in jobs, the cost in 
trade, the cost to our economy. Britain is leaving theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, but the choices about how we leave will 
sit with Theresa May and the government - and this looks like a Tory plan that 
will make most people poorer.

And despite all of this, we still don’t have clarity on what she actually 
wants to achieve in terms of our future trading relationship withEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. So despite the all the talk we 
still face uncertainty, putting even more jobs at risk.
 
In the Commons Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is responding to 
David Davis <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis>. He says Theresa 
May should have made her speech in the Commons. That is not just a convention, 
he says. That is so MPs can question her on behalf of their constituents.

He says Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> has been arguing 
for the best possible access to the single market and for the rights of EU 
nationals in Britain to be protected. May has accepted that, he says.

He says she is effectively offering a half-in, half-out solution.

If Britain has a free trade deal, there will have to be a mechanism for 
avoiding disputes.

He says May has effectively ruled out a hard Brexit. That is good, he says.

 * Starmer says May has effectively ruled out hard Brexit. 
He welcomes the fact that May has offered MPs a vote on the final deal.

But the threat to change the UK’s economic model if the UK does not get a good 
deal is a very serious one, he says. He says there would be no mandate for 
this. It would be “an act of huge self-harm for the UK”, he says. And he says 
this is incompatible with what May said about wanting to protect workers’ 
rights.
 
Many in continental Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
will see Theresa May’s speech as thinly-veiled threat to turn the UK into a tax 
haven.Philippe Lamberts, the co-chair of the Green group in the European 
parliament, described the speech as “a slap in the face for those who want to 
establish the new UK-EU relationship in a way that would preserve not only 
economic co-operation, but many other positive elements of the European social, 
environmental and legal acquis.”

He added: “It also risks painful consequences for the British people, many of 
whom would suffer deeply under a low-tax, low-regulation agenda.”
 
Jeremy Corbyn has put out a statement about Theresa May’s speech accusing her 
of wanting to turn the UK into a “bargain basement tax haven”. He said:

Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has made clear 
that she is determined to use Brexit to turn Britain into a bargain basement 
tax haven on the shores of Europe. She makes out this is a negotiating threat 
to the 27 EU countries but it’s actually a threat to the British people’s jobs, 
services and living standards.

We welcome that the prime minister has listened to the case we’ve been making 
about the need for full tariff free access to the single market but are deeply 
concerned about her reckless approach to achieving it.

This speech should have been given in parliament where MPs could ask her 
questions on behalf of their constituents. She talks about Brexit restoring 
parliamentary sovereignty but, once again, she is determined to avoid real 
scrutiny of her plans.

David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is making a statement now in the Commons 
about Theresa May’s speech. He is summarising what May said earlier.
