When were you happiest? 
As I get older, I get happier.

What is your greatest fear? 
Death.

What is your earliest memory?
My brother Tony putting a rabbit with myxomatosis out of its misery. I must 
have been four.

Which living person do you most admire, and why?
My father, because he’s never run away from anything.

What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?
Parking my worries with my husband at 2am and leaving him blinking into the 
darkness while I sleep.

What is the trait you most deplore in others?
Bigotry.

What was your most embarrassing moment?
At the Royal Court in 1994, doing The Libertine, the show where I met my 
husband. We were talking in the wings when he suddenly shouted, “You’re on!” 
and I ran on holding a chair. I looked back and he was in the wings utterly 
shocked: he didn’t think for a moment I’d believe him. I was in the wrong scene 
in the wrong costume, with a chair.

What is your favourite smell?
Petrol.

What is your guiltiest pleasure?
Eating entire lemons covered in salt.

Property aside, what’s the most expensive thing you’ve bought? 
Ten years ago I bought a painting. I lived with it for a year before realising 
I didn’t like it at all. So it’s on my wall, mocking me daily.

What is your most treasured possession?
A copy of Toni Morrison’s Beloved that my mum gave me.

What do you most dislike about your appearance?
My face completely gives me away.

Who would play you in the film of your life?
Animated by Pixar, voiced by Kathy Burke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kathy-burke>.

What is the worst thing anyone’s said to you?

Last March, someone stopped me in my local shopping centre and said, “Didn’t 
you used to be an actress?”

To whom would you most like to say sorry, and why?
To anyone I’ve worked with between 5.30am and 8.30am. I am not a morning 
person.

What does love feel like? 
Like you are standing with an army.

Which words or phrases do you most overuse?
“I don’t know my lines.”

What is the closest you’ve come to death?
Swimming off the north Cornish coast eight years ago. I remember thinking, 
“Why did they teach you how to inflate your pyjamas in life-saving classes at 
school, when they could have just told you what to do in a riptide?”

What song would you like played at your funeral?
Funerals are for the people left behind, so I don’t mind.

Tell us a secret
I am very good at keeping secrets, except when I am drunk, when I will tell 
you absolutely anything. You can even have my pin number.
