Name: Pamela Anderson.

Age: 49.

Occupation: Definitely not Julian Assange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/julian-assange>’s murderer.

You stated that a little too confidently for my liking. It’s true, though. 
Andersonabsolutely didn’t murder Assange with a Pret vegan sandwich 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3842846/Rumors-swirl-Pamela-Anderson-poisoned-Julian-Assange-vegan-meal-Pret.html>
 on Saturday. Not even a bit.

I mean, by those standards, neither did I. But Anderson really didn’t.

Can we track this back to the beginning for a second? Sure. On Saturday, 
Anderson visited Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. She brought him a 
vegan sandwich from Pret. And he remained staunchly unmurdered.

I’m so confused. Was she supposed to murder him? No, not at all. But he went 
quiet after the visit, and rumours began to swirl that he was dead from 
Anderson’s bready hand.

Is this real life? Did this actually happen? Yes, and it was exacerbated when 
Wikileaks begantweeting things such as 
<https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787777344740163584> “pre-commitment 1: 
John Kerry 4bb96075acadc3d80b5ac872874c3037a386f4f595fe99e687439aabd0219809”, 
which some people read as a dead man’s switch to be activated in the event of 
Assange’s death.

But he’s definitely alive? Well, he might be. After hearing about this, 
someone on Twitterwrote 
<https://twitter.com/MyWhiteNinja/status/787837574106742784>: “Don’t trust 
unconfirmed reports of Assange being alive. The Clinton machine is capable of 
body doubles. ARREST PAMELA ANDERSON NOW #MAGA.” So who knows?

Wait, Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is 
in on this, too? No. God, I hate 2016 so much.

Has Anderson actually said anything about this? Yes, after the visit she said: 
“I really believe in him and think he’s a good person, and I’m concerned about 
his health, his family, and I just hope that by some miracle he’s set free.”

And she tried to fix his ailing health with a vegan sandwich? An unpoisoned 
vegan sandwich, remember. There’s a big distinction.

Was she in the UK just to meet Assange? No, she also delivered a lecture to 
the Oxford Union 
<https://www.oxford-union.org/term_events/pamela_anderson_and_rabbi_shmuley_boteach>
 about the dangers of porn addiction.

Oh wow, that sounds interesting. Sorry, I’m too busy talking about the bigger 
story – you know, how she bought a sandwich for a man and he didn’t immediately 
die from it.

Do say: “The news is out of control.”

Don’t say: Thanks for lunch, Pammy. What’s with the skull and crossbones on 
the packaging?
