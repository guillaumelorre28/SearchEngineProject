Theresa May’s trip to Bahrain this week has relegated Wednesday’s prime 
minister’s questions to a B-team affair, a contest that would normally take 
place between two deputies.


But in 2016 parliamentary traditions have been watered down somewhat.

With no number two to call on, the prime minister has asked the leader of the 
House of Commons <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons>, David 
Lidington, to take her place.

Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, has asked the shadow foreign secretary, Emily 
Thornberry <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/emily-thornberry>, to step up 
in a move that some are saying is a snub for the party’s deputy leader, Tom 
Watson.


Watson might have been hoping that Commons ritual would mean he would be 
propelled into the limelight this week. But it wasn’t to be.

“Obviously Tom would have been happy to stand in but he respects Jeremy’s 
decision,” a spokesman said.

A source from the leader’s office replied: “There is no hard or fast rule 
about who doesPMQs <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> in place of the 
leader. Emily is a very senior member of the shadow cabinet and she’ll do an 
excellent job.”
