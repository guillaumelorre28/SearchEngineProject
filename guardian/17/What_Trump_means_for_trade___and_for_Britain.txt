, 12 January) makes some good points about Obama’s mixed legacy. But he fails 
to acknowledge the big difference between Trump’s forthcoming presidency and 
the one Obama has had to endure, especially during his last term. Unlike Obama 
– who despite his failings was shackled by an unprecedentedly destructive and 
obstructive Republican majority in both houses – Trump, with the prospect of an 
even bigger majority behind him, is likely to find it relatively easy to 
shoe-in all manner of regressive legislation (aided further by a supine supreme 
court, once he fills that vacant seat).

• There is a more puzzling conundrum than the potential success of a sinner 
over a saint. Recently, I listened to Bloomberg financial analysts on the 
fallout from “desired” US job repatriations. They chose Apple’s iPhone as an 
example. Unit production cost of an iPhone with Chinese labour:  $4. Estimated 
cost using US labour: $40. Estimated cost using fully automated factories: 0.75 
cents. (Foxconn already has such a factory in Asia). Conclusion: repatriation 
of production using old forms of labour is a no-brainer.

When such a demand is made by a fellow billionaire then capitalists apparently 
jump. What is the economic or political motive for such a reversal of 
capitalist plans to maximise profits? In the short term these companies appear 
to fear the political opprobrium heaped upon them (modulated by daily Trump 
tweets) more than the wrath of shareholders.

Imagine a demand to a global capitalist company such as General Motors or Ford 
to repatriate production by a President Sanders (or even Obama). This would be 
perceived as a gross interference in market freedom and the imposition of a 
socialist “command economy”. We have a perverse possibility of what historians 
of the left would regard as a revolution from above. Interesting times.

• American companies looked on with some discomfort as the European community 
developed into a trading bloc of some 350 million people establishing high 
standards of consumer protection, employment law, health and safety regulation, 
and increasingly transparent tax and accounting arrangements. They saw the EC 
as a real competitor in world markets. Europe in turn sought to reassure US 
investors of the stability and potential growth of the European market without 
compromising hard-won policies on competition and standards.

By decoupling from the EU, the UK will be exposed to intense and aggressive 
dealing from US business (Trade deal could put US business in driving seat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/16/a-uk-trade-deal-with-trump-be-careful-what-you-wish-for>
, 17 January). We are fooling ourselves if we think we will get better trading 
deals; nothing will be done in our favour if it can be avoided. It may be that 
we shall find ourselves having to agree to imported GM foods as a quid pro quo 
for something else. There is no level playing field; that is how American 
business works, and how the Trump administration will work.

• It seems that those who are keen to “take back control” by stepping away 
from the constraints and benefits of the single market hope to quickly step 
into the embrace of a Trumpist trade deal. Given the president-elect’s 
well-publicised mode of embracing vulnerable potential partners, isn’t a degree 
of scepticism required as to how balanced and free such a deal would be – if it 
ever came to fruition. We seem to be walking a short path from being partners 
to being victims, with a short detour to tell our former European partners how 
unimportant their concerns are compared with ours. The adage of pride coming 
before a fall has never been more appropriate.

• The UK has a serious long-term balance-of-trade deficit. The only new trade 
deals we should get excited about are those that offer the UK a prospect of 
achieving a reasonable surplus. I doubt that is what Trump has in mind (Trump: 
I’ll do quick trade deal with Britain after exit from EU

• You were kind enough to publish a letter from me 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/22/barack-obama-inauguration-letters>
 in January 2009 at the time of inauguration of President Obama. This was in 
response to a previous writer who wrote that Bush was once again a nonentity – 
an irrefutable argument for democracy. I wrote that the fact that he was 
elected twice was surely an argument against democracy. Now we have Trump and 
Brexit. What price democracy now?

• Trump has proclaimed the transfer of his asserts to a blind trust (Financial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/13/blind-trusts-what-do-theresa-may-and-donald-trump-have-in-common>
, 14 January). What are the odds for the trust also being deaf?
