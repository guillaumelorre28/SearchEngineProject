It’s Blue Monday again. Hooray. Let’s celebrate. Waiter, a bottle of your 
bleakest champagne, please.

Every third Monday in January is now Blue Monday, according

. Granted, some say the second Monday, or the fourth. It makes no difference, 
each one is just as likely to be the most depressing day of the year. You could 
pick the first Thursday in August if you like, it’s just as valid. Or the ninth 
Saturday inSmarch, <http://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Smarch> doesn’t matter. 

It’s difficult to keep track of how many times it’s been debunked 
<http://www.snopes.com/medical/myths/bluemonday.asp> and ridiculed, often in 
this very blog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/jan/16/blue-monday-depressing-day-pseudoscience>
. But it keeps coming back year after year, sometimes viawell-meant campaigns 
<https://twitter.com/PeteEtchells/status/555849288853766144> that sadly only 
serve to give it far more credibility than is warranted. Making an extra effort 
to be supportive of people with depression on “Blue Monday” is like being more 
considerate of diabetics because Jupiter is rising in Virgo.

I’d vowed to never speak of it again. But people keep asking me about it, 
letting me know it’s coming up, linking me to things referring to it, and all 
manner of stuff like that. Clearly all my previous efforts at mocking and 
distancing myself from the ludicrous phenomenon have backfired. So, I’m making 
one more effort at clarifying my thoughts on the matter and on the validity of 
Blue Monday.

Does depression work this way? No. Is the equation used to determine Blue 
Monday anything other than gibberish?No 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/jan/21/blue-monday-depressing-day-nonsense-science>
. Is it anything more than cynical advertising bumph that people have lapped up 
to an alarming extent?No 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/jan/20/blue-monday-bad-science-and-nonsense-pr>
.

And here’s the most important bit: is it really the most depressing day of the 
year?

No.

No, no, no. 

No. Na. Nein. Non. Nyet. Mhai. Illai. Não. Nee. Ne. Nope. Negatory. Nada. No 
way, Jose. Nil. Nu. Nie. Bu Dui. Iie. Nem. Nullus. Nej. Neen. And, in case any 
Klingons are reading this, Ghobe!

I don’t know how I can put it any clearer. But then, my previous efforts to 
state the facts of the matter in writing have failed to achieve any lasting 
effect. So if one method doesn’t work, you should try another. So here are some 
attempts at addressing the issue via methods that the internet seems to relate 
to.

So, is it the most depressing day of the year? What do you think, Darth Vader?

And you, TV’s Calculon?

What about you, 90’s era nostalgic reference 2 Unlimited? 
  
Maybe videos are still too subtle a format to get the point across? After all, 
it seems like Blue Monday is basically a meme at this point. And how do you 
fight a meme?

What do you think, Wonka?

How about you, Doge?

Of course, because of balance, if you ask a dog you have to consult …

That’s pretty clear. But some people might still be a bit confused. Isn’t that 
right, Fry?

Good point. What do you make of this, Kermit?

Excellent, another important aspect. What’s your take on it Buzz?

All right mate, take it easy yeah? 

If you had to sum it up Boromir, how would you do so?

Yes, exactly. 

And in case there’s anyone reading this who still doesn’t quite get it, here 
is the point of this piece made in a format that seemingly everyone will pay 
attention to; printed directly onto Kim Kardashian’s impressive posterior.

If you’re expecting a final sentence that sums up the point of this piece 
because you haven’t grasped it already, then I’m sorry but there’s no hope for 
you.

Dean Burnett is well aware that this piece is one of the most blatant 
demonstrations ofBetteridge’s law 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines> ever, this was 
intentional. But still, feel free to point it out to him via Twitter,@garwboy
