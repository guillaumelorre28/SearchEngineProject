Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it's up to you to 
help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next 
Saturday's paper.

This week's question

We live in the UK and are thinking of investing in a flat in central Dublin 
for weekends away. The two-beds that were €400k are now around €250k. Is it a 
good idea, or will prices go lower? Should I only make "silly" offers? And is 
Ireland's place in the euro a worry?

What are your thoughts?
