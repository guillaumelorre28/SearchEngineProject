Closing summary: Historic output from Opec, but questions remain

Here’s a snap summary, for new readers just tuning in.


Opec as defied sceptics and agreed its first production cut since the 
financial crisis struck. The oil cartel will shave 1.2 million barrels per day 
off its output, cutting it from 33.7m to 32.5m barrels per day.

OPEC president Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada announced the deal in Vienna this 
afternoon, after three days of talks and tension

. He called it a ‘historic move’ that would help to stabilise the market.

The deal was achieved thanks to a surprise agreement between Saudi Arabia, 
Iraq and Iran.

 Saudi will take the biggest hit, lowering output by almost 500k barrels per 
day, while Iraq will cut by 200,000. Iran, though, will be permitted to raise 
its production.

The deal is dependent on non-Opec members chipping in, cutting by another 
600,000 barrels per day. The two sides will met in 10 days time; Russia has 
indicated that it’s on board.

The oil price has surged by over 8% today, putting Brent crude over $50 per 
barrel.

Analysts, though, question whether the deal will really work 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/30/bank-of-england-stress-tests-opec-meeting-oil-business-live?page=with:block-583f10fbe4b056d3d56ac111#block-583f10fbe4b056d3d56ac111>
 (Opec is creating a new oversight committee to try to ensure compliance).

Mike Jakeman, Global analyst & commodities editor, Economist Intelligence 
Unit, says there are four reasons to be cautious:

 * First, it is possible that some cheating will occur. OPEC’s members do not 
have a good track record of sticking to production quotas.

 * Second, there has been no firm commitment yet from Russia, the largest 
non-OPEC producers. It is possible that Russian production could fill the gap 
left by Saudi.

 * Third, production even at the lower level of 32.5m b/d is still a high 
level. There is no threat of an oil shortage that could see the price zoom 
backup.

 * Last, if there was a sustained rise in prices, this would be likely to 
trigger a response from US shale producers, which would in turn push the price 
down again. We think the lack of a sustained rise in prices will see the deal 
fall apart within a year

I’ll be back tomorrow with more reaction and analysis. 


In the meantime, here’s economics editor Larry Elliott’s take:

The price of oil has surged by 8% after the 14-nation cartel Opec agreed to 
its first cut in production in eight years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/30/bank-of-england-stress-tests-opec-meeting-oil-business-live>
.

Confounding critics who said the club of oil-producing nations was too riven 
with political infighting to agree a deal,Opec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> announced it was trimming output by 
1.2m barrels per day (bpd) from 1 January.

The deal is contingent on securing the agreement of non-Opec producers to 
lower production by 600,000m barrels per day. But the Qatari oil minister 
Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada said he was confident that the key non-Opec player – 
Russia – would sign up to a 300,000 bpd cut.

Russia’s oil minister Alexander Novak welcomed the Opec move but said his 
country would only be able to cut production gradually due to “technical 
issues”. A meeting with non-Opec countries in Moscow on 9 December has been 
pencilled in.

Al-Sada said the deal was a great success and a “major step forward”.

But the news that Saudi Arabia had effectively admitted defeat in its 
long-running attempt to drive US shale producers out of business was enough to 
send the price of crude sharply higher on the world’s commodity markets.....

Paul Dean, the global <http://www.hfw.com/Paul-Dean> head of oil & gas at 
legal firm HFW <http://www.hfw.com/Paul-Dean>, questions whether today’s deal 
will really stabilise the markets, as Opec hopes.

The known unknowns are how Russia will react and whether it will lead to an 
increase in US production. The US picture made more complex from a geopolitical 
perspective by Trump’s threatened ban on the import of Saudi crude.

Therefore while there are certainly positives for the market to take from this 
agreement the jury must still be out on whether it is going to lead the 
stability that is so desperately needed.

Now this is interesting.... Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak has 
welcomed Opec’s decision to cut output by 1.2m barrels per day.

He also confirms that Russia is ready to gradually cut oil output by up to 
300,000, but only gradually because of “technical issues”, reports Reuters.

Novak also confirms that non-Opec members (such as Russia) will meet with Opec 
in 10 days time to discuss the issue. He expects other non-Opec members to come 
on board and cut production too.

Smaller companies are benefitting too. Cairn Energy and Tullow Oil, which both 
pump crude from the North Sea, have surged around 14% today.

This deal is a mixed blessing for the UK.

On the upside, it makes North Sea oil more valuable. Scotland’s oil industry 
should benefit from Brent crude surging 8% to $50/barrel; that’s good for jobs.

But.... car drivers face paying more at the pumps if this deal sticks, and 
companies are going to be charged more for transportation. That can feed into 
higher prices, which means lower real wages.

Energy analyst Dominick Chirichella <https://twitter.com/dacenergy> believes 
today’s deal is significant, especially if non-Opec members cut output by 
600,000.
Dominick Chirichella (@dacenergy) 
IF this is truly a total cut of 1.8 mil bpd effective 1/1/17 this is overall 
bullish and will accelerate global oil overbalancing in 2017

Important point: Opec are NOT using Indonesia’s suspension to fiddle their 
output figures. They have genuinely agreed to cut output by 1.2m barrels per 
day.

Here's the details of Opec's cuts

Journalists in Vienna have just been handed the new output table, explaining 
the details of today’s agreement to reduce output by 1.2m barrels per day.

And it confirms that Saudi Arabia will take the bulk of the cuts, cutting 
almost 500,000 barrels per day.

Iraq is also on board, with a 210,000 cut, followed by the UAE (-139,000), 
Kuwait (-131,000) and Venezuela (-95,000). Smaller countries are also doing 
their bit.

Iran, though, has the green light to keep raising output.

The table also confirms that Indonesia has suspended its membership (because, 
as a net importer of oil, it didn’t want to cut output and drive the price up).

The Opec press conference is now over. I’ll pull a summary together ASAP.

In the meantime, here’s some instant analysis from Mike Jakeman of the 
Economist Intelligence Unit:
Mike Jakeman (@mikejakeman) 
1) It's the first time the group has achieved co-ordinated action since 2008. 
This alone makes it significant.
 <https://twitter.com/mikejakeman/status/803999027167690752> November 30, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/mikejakeman/status/803999027167690752> Mike Jakeman 
(@mikejakeman) 
2) Saudi will bear the brunt of the cuts. Deal an admission that previous 
strategy, of driving US shale producers to the wall, has failed.

<https://twitter.com/mikejakeman/status/803999242557816837> Mike Jakeman 
(@mikejakeman) 
3) We do not expect the production cut to lead to a transformative increase in 
prices.

<https://twitter.com/mikejakeman/status/803999305535258625> Mike Jakeman 
(@mikejakeman) 
4) It is possible that some cheating will occur. OPEC's members do not have a 
good track record of sticking to production quotas.

<https://twitter.com/mikejakeman/status/803999363181793280> Mike Jakeman 
(@mikejakeman) 
5) There has been no firm commitment yet from Russia, the largest non-OPEC 
producer. Russian production could fill the gap left by Saudi.

6) Production even at the lower level of 32.5m b/d is still high. No threat of 
an oil shortage that could see the price zoom back up.

Here’s a snap summary, for new readers just tuning in.


Opec as defied sceptics and agreed its first production cut since the 
financial crisis struck. The oil cartel will shave 1.2 million barrels per day 
off its output, cutting it from 33.7m to 32.5m barrels per day.

OPEC president Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada announced the deal in Vienna this 
afternoon, after three days of talks and tension 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/30/bank-of-england-stress-tests-opec-meeting-oil-business-live?page=with:block-583ef9eee4b015a427f7635a#block-583ef9eee4b015a427f7635a>
. He called it a ‘historic move’ that would help to stabilise the market.

The deal was achieved thanks to a surprise agreement between Saudi Arabia, 
Iraq and Iran. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/30/bank-of-england-stress-tests-opec-meeting-oil-business-live?page=with:block-583f038fe4b015a427f76382#block-583f038fe4b015a427f76382>
 Saudi will take the biggest hit, lowering output by almost 500k barrels per 
day, while Iraq will cut by 200,000. Iran, though, will be permitted to raise 
its production.

The deal is dependent on non-Opec members chipping in, cutting by another 
600,000 barrels per day. The two sides will met in 10 days time; Russia has 
indicated that it’s on board.

The oil price has surged by over 8% today, putting Brent crude over $50 per 
barrel.

Analysts, though, question whether the deal will really work 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/30/bank-of-england-stress-tests-opec-meeting-oil-business-live?page=with:block-583f10fbe4b056d3d56ac111#block-583f10fbe4b056d3d56ac111>
 (Opec is creating a new oversight committee to try to ensure compliance).

Mike Jakeman, Global analyst & commodities editor, Economist Intelligence 
Unit, says there are four reasons to be cautious:

 * First, it is possible that some cheating will occur. OPEC’s members do not 
have a good track record of sticking to production quotas.

 * Second, there has been no firm commitment yet from Russia, the largest 
non-OPEC producers. It is possible that Russian production could fill the gap 
left by Saudi.

 * Third, production even at the lower level of 32.5m b/d is still a high 
level. There is no threat of an oil shortage that could see the price zoom 
backup.

 * Last, if there was a sustained rise in prices, this would be likely to 
trigger a response from US shale producers, which would in turn push the price 
down again. We think the lack of a sustained rise in prices will see the deal 
fall apart within a year

I’ll be back tomorrow with more reaction and analysis. 


In the meantime, here’s economics editor Larry Elliott’s take:

The price of oil has surged by 8% after the 14-nation cartel Opec agreed to 
its first cut in production in eight years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/30/bank-of-england-stress-tests-opec-meeting-oil-business-live>
.

Confounding critics who said the club of oil-producing nations was too riven 
with political infighting to agree a deal,Opec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> announced it was trimming output by 
1.2m barrels per day (bpd) from 1 January.

The deal is contingent on securing the agreement of non-Opec producers to 
lower production by 600,000m barrels per day. But the Qatari oil minister 
Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada said he was confident that the key non-Opec player – 
Russia – would sign up to a 300,000 bpd cut.

Russia’s oil minister Alexander Novak welcomed the Opec move but said his 
country would only be able to cut production gradually due to “technical 
issues”. A meeting with non-Opec countries in Moscow on 9 December has been 
pencilled in.

Al-Sada said the deal was a great success and a “major step forward”.

But the news that Saudi Arabia had effectively admitted defeat in its 
long-running attempt to drive US shale producers out of business was enough to 
send the price of crude sharply higher on the world’s commodity markets.....

Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW
 
Paul Dean, the global <http://www.hfw.com/Paul-Dean> head of oil & gas at 
legal firm HFW <http://www.hfw.com/Paul-Dean>, questions whether today’s deal 
will really stabilise the markets, as Opec hopes.

The known unknowns are how Russia will react and whether it will lead to an 
increase in US production. The US picture made more complex from a geopolitical 
perspective by Trump’s threatened ban on the import of Saudi crude.

Therefore while there are certainly positives for the market to take from this 
agreement the jury must still be out on whether it is going to lead the 
stability that is so desperately needed.
 
Now this is interesting.... Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak has 
welcomed Opec’s decision to cut output by 1.2m barrels per day.

He also confirms that Russia is ready to gradually cut oil output by up to 
300,000, but only gradually because of “technical issues”, reports Reuters.

Novak also confirms that non-Opec members (such as Russia) will meet with Opec 
in 10 days time to discuss the issue. He expects other non-Opec members to come 
on board and cut production too.

Shares in oil companies have jumped sharply; Royal Dutch Shell has rallied by 
4.2%, followed by BP up 3.8%.

Smaller companies are benefitting too. Cairn Energy and Tullow Oil, which both 
pump crude from the North Sea, have surged around 14% today.
 
This deal is a mixed blessing for the UK.

On the upside, it makes North Sea oil more valuable. Scotland’s oil industry 
should benefit from Brent crude surging 8% to $50/barrel; that’s good for jobs.

But.... car drivers face paying more at the pumps if this deal sticks, and 
companies are going to be charged more for transportation. That can feed into 
higher prices, which means lower real wages.

Chatham House fellow Valerie Marcel points out that Saudi persuaded its fellow

Energy analyst Dominick Chirichella <https://twitter.com/dacenergy> believes 
today’s deal is significant, especially if non-Opec members cut output by 
600,000.

IF this is truly a total cut of 1.8 mil bpd effective 1/1/17 this is overall 
bullish and will accelerate global oil overbalancing in 2017

Important point: Opec are NOT using Indonesia’s suspension to fiddle their 
output figures. They have genuinely agreed to cut output by 1.2m barrels per 
day.

Journalists in Vienna have just been handed the new output table, explaining 
the details of today’s agreement to reduce output by 1.2m barrels per day.

And it confirms that Saudi Arabia will take the bulk of the cuts, cutting 
almost 500,000 barrels per day.

Iraq is also on board, with a 210,000 cut, followed by the UAE (-139,000), 
Kuwait (-131,000) and Venezuela (-95,000). Smaller countries are also doing 
their bit.

Iran, though, has the green light to keep raising output.

The table also confirms that Indonesia has suspended its membership (because, 
as a net importer of oil, it didn’t want to cut output and drive the price up).

The Opec press conference is now over. I’ll pull a summary together ASAP.

In the meantime, here’s some instant analysis from Mike Jakeman of the 
Economist Intelligence Unit:
Mike Jakeman (@mikejakeman) 
1) It's the first time the group has achieved co-ordinated action since 2008. 
This alone makes it significant.

2) Saudi will bear the brunt of the cuts. Deal an admission that previous 
strategy, of driving US shale producers to the wall, has failed.

3) We do not expect the production cut to lead to a transformative increase in 
prices.
