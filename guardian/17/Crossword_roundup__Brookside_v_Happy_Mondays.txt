The news in clues

When the world learned of Donald Trump’s predacious conversation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-tape-arianne-zucker-sexual-assault-groping>
 with Billy Bush, one way to avoid visualising was to take a step back – to 
wonder: who knew, and when?

Accounts, naturally, differ 
<http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-hot-mic-tape-leaked/> as to how the 
videotape traveled from NBC’s archive to the front pages, but in the 
crosswording world, there had already been, quite literally,a clue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/26998#3-down>:

3d Trump, rampant rutter, close to irresistible (7)
[ heraldic sense of ‘rampant’ + animal that ruts + last letter of IRRESISTIBLE 
]
[ UP + STAG + E ]

Yes, we have noted already that the setter Paul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/sep/22/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-paul>
 seemed to have foresight ofan egg-smuggling operation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/sep/12/crossword-roundup-when-puzzles-accidentally-report-the-news>
, not to mention revelations aboutthe Cambridge spy ring 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/apr/11/crossword-roundup-covert-spies-and-cats-whiskers>
. But he is clearly even better connected than we surmised. So, Paul, what 
ghastliness is going to emerge beforethe third debate

Latter patter

Language old and new in this Independent on Sunday clue 
<http://puzzles.independent.co.uk/games/cryptic-crossword-independent/?puzzleDate=20161009#!201610>
 from Daedalus ...

20d Almost get lost arresting tabloid press (7)
[ most of synonym for ‘get lost’ surrounding (‘arresting’) slang term for a 
tabloid paper ]
[ most of DO ONE surrounding RAG ]

... for the answer DRAGOON. DO ONE means “get lost” in the sense of “go away”, 
as inthe recent Guardian euphemism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/07/the-fiver-graziano-pelle-italy>
: “Cordially invited to a reception at the Do One ambassador’s residence.”

It’s one of those phrases that looks impossibly vague, but in context and with 
memories of DO A BUNK, DO A RUNNER and so on, tends to make sense.Bloomsbury’s 
Dictionary of Contemporary Slang 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dictionary-of-contemporary-slang.html> 
reckons it comes from the north, circa 2000; Oxford suggests that the place is 
about right but the time is earlier, citing a line fromBrookside 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/dec/13/brookside-your-next-box-set>
 addressed to the hapless Thomas “Sinbad” Sweeney in 1990:

Look just do one, will y’ Sinbad!

All the Oxford lexicographers need do now is to contact the lyricist, Shaun 
Ryder, and ask him to clarify whether the DO ONE he used to open a song a 
quarter of a century ago ...

On one, in one, did one, do one, did one, have one, in one, have one
Come on, have one, did one, do one, good one, in one, have one

... is the same meaning they have in their definition for “one”, sub-heading 
P5, section (b). Other terms for which Brookside is Oxford’s first citation 
include INDIAN (in the sense “we’re going out for an Indian”) and the subject 
of our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue NO-MARK?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for OOMPA LOOMPA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/sep/26/crossword-roundup-splendiferous-scrumdiddlyumptious-setting>
. ComedyPseudonym gets the audacity award for the “no headroom” part of 
“There’s no headroom for two old men holding a weaving machine for a factory 
worker”, while ID2155366 gets a new honesty award for the caveat thathis or her 
clue <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84475111> is 
“perhaps neither accurate nor fair”!

I enjoyed the terseness of Alberyalbery’s “Industrial orangeman”, the 
luridness of TrickyJoe’s “Cinematic cautioner: ‘Balls. Member. Gore. Balls. 
Member. Skinned Cat’” and the imagery of Schroduck’s “Lederhosen-clad 
chocolatier heard Bavarian music repeatedly having drunk litres”.

The runners-up are both acrostic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/jan/27/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-initial-letters>
: Chrisbeee’s “Originally, one of many people, (all little), offering oddball 
manufacturer practical assistance” and Peshwari’s “The first out of many 
peculiarities, a little orange old man prancing about”; the winner is Ousgg’s 
misleading “Unusual Labour backing for reclusive tycoon”.

Kludos to Ousgg; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.
