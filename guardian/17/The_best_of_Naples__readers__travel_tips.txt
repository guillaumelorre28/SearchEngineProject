Winning tip: A relic of Maradona


There are different ways of expressing personal spiritual beliefs. In Naples 
there’s football. On Sundays Neapolitan streets fall silent when the city 
football team plays. Still, nothing compares to the late 1980s team, the one 
that won Serie A twice thanks mainly to one player: Diego Armando Maradona. 
He’s still worshipped in town – just take a walk to Piazzetta Nilo in the city 
centre, where you will find a light-blue reliquary in which a strand of curly 
black hair is preserved. Whose is this relic? Maradona’s of course, available 
to all devotees in search of a miracle for the next Sunday’s match.

Want to taste the famous pastry masterpieces like sfogliatella (a crispy 
little cake filled with ricotta-cheese cream),pastiera (orange-flavoured cake 
made with wheat grains, yes wheat grains) orbabà (soft cake literally drowned 
in rum and syrup)? Fancy trying thefrittatina (deep-fried cubes of pasta with 
tomato sauce and cheese)? And of course, you would want to taste pizza in its 
original crêpe-like form, folded and ready to eat on the street. You can do it 
all simply by walking in Spaccanapoli, the tiny, rowdy alley cutting through 
the historic centre of Naples: enjoy your walk!

Testimony to the centuries-old tradition of presepi, the Neapolitan Christmas 
cribs, San Gregorio Armeno is a year-round feast of colours and craftsmanship, 
but obviously it’s the weeks leading to Christmas that see it at its best. From 
Piazzetta Nilo, head east on Spaccanapoli and turn left when you see crowds of 
tourists and stalls packed with an impressive range of crib figurines, 
including a full-size Diego Maradona and a miniature Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge with offspring. Turn right at the end of the street to find the best 
pizza in town atPizzeria di Matteo <http://www.pizzeriadimatteo.com/> 
(margherita €4) while you start pondering the cheapest and safest way to ship a 
handmade crib and a handful of terracotta figurines back home.

For a day out from Naples, head off to the small island of Procida, about one 
hour by ferry. The island is still a well-kept secret. Marina Corricella is 
surrounded by picturesque houses that seem to have fallen into an artist’s 
colour pot; they are painted in the brightest pastel pink, yellow, blue and 
white. Wander the cobbled streets to get a feeling of local life, without the 
tourist crowds of more popularIschia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/sep/23/elena-ferrante-ischia-italy-island-paradise-naples>
 orCapri 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/16/nostalgia-trip-tim-dowling-second-honeymoon-capri>
, and enjoy a relaxing hour on one of the pretty beaches. Before the ferry 
heads back to Naples, have a seafood dinner offered in many of the Marina’s 
lovely restaurants.

Pizzeria Brandi in Naples is, according to some, where the Neapolitan pizza 
was invented. The place is not too dissimilar to Pizza Express, and may 
disappoint some. However, this is the spiritual home of pizza, and has to be 
visited if you are visiting Italy for its culinary history.

<http://www.immagineazionebb.com/>, an inspirational budget B&B owned by two 
photographers (doubles from €49).Gran Cafe Gambrinus 
<http://grancaffegambrinus.com/> is a great place for coffee where it is 
thought that Wilde, Hemingway, and Sartre loved to visit. Go to theBiblioteca 
Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III <http://www.bnnonline.it/> and admire the 
sublime architecture. Afterwards meditate in the beautiful garden. Finally, 
enjoy drinks atLibri e Caffè 
<https://www.facebook.com/LibriCaffeTeatroMercadante> (on Facebook 
<https://www.facebook.com/LibriCaffeTeatroMercadante>) where everything is made 
from recycled cardboard. In addition to the literary atmosphere, there are live 
music performances, DJ shows and book readings.

Transport buffs should not miss the National Railway Museum of Pietrarsa, 
<http://www.museopietrarsa.it/mpie-en> in what were originally the old Bourbon 
workshops founded in 1840 at the command of Ferdinand II. Visitors are taken on 
a history of railways in Italy from the mid-19th century to today’s high-speed 
trains. There are lots of locomotives on display and much of the museum is 
covered, making it perfect if you’re in the area on a rainy day. It lies just 
to the side of the Naples-Portici railway line – Italy’s first railway line – 
and is very close to Naples itself.

The real fun in Naples is down the side streets. In the main shopping areas, 
just look for the little turnings and you will find small family shops with 
excellent goods, the local cafes and restaurants that the people of Naples use, 
and real home-cooked food for themselves not for the tourists. No trip to 
Naples is complete without a trip to the city of Pompeii, the whole atmosphere 
of the city once you bypass the tourist areas is fun. In the middle of Pompeii 
there is a building that many Italians eat in: it’s just wall-to-wall tables 
with no charge for use. Like an indoor picnic area.

Herculaneum is a must, but don’t go on any tours booked through your hotel or 
travel rep. It’s easy to get there and hire your own private tour guide: there 
are plenty waiting. You get a more personal tour and go at your own pace, often 
learning and seeing more than when part of a larger group. The cost either 
works out the same or not much more, depending on how many there are of you. 
The same goes for Pompeii: it’s a vast place, and if you’re part of a large 
group you miss so much.

housing an impressive collection in which old and new are restored. You can 
also watch dolls being “operated” on. The nurses dress up in nursing clothes to

Hidden behind an unassuming entrance of gaudy plastic signs and graffiti-clad 
walls on Via Cesare Sersale, L’AnticaPizzeria da Michele <http://damichele.net/>
 is the stuff of legends when it comes to the Neapolitan pizza pie. Its name 
had been uttered in hushed, reverent whispers to me as I had made my way 
through Italy from the north, touted by many as the finest place to try the 
south’s most famous culinary export (even by biased northerners!). It did not 
disappoint. Mounds of buffalo mozzarella and fresh-cut peppers hid the chefs in 
the open kitchen at the back; an earthy, stripped-down interior gave way to a 
roaring wood-fired oven; and the locals appeared to enjoy the food and 
atmosphere as much as the visitors. The pizza was top-notch, complete with a 
fresh passata top and a dough that had bubbled up to mimic the topography of 
Vesuvius itself.

I went on a brilliant tour of Naples on the back of a scooter with a little 
operation calledVespAround <> (half-day tour €140). Local archaeologist and 
tour guide Emiliano Tufano picked me up from my hotel on his red Vespa. It was 
great fun bumping over cobbles, weaving through traffic and nipping down tiny 
streets. We toured the main sights, stopped off for a coffee at a marble-topped 
bar, popped into a church where human bones are worshipped, met some craftsmen 
who were carving Christmas decorations and bought a Lotto ticket from a 
backstreet shop where the owner interprets dreams into Lotto numbers. The whole 
time Emiliano patiently answered my stream of questions. It was the perfect way 
to see this notoriously chaotic city.

Go underground at the church of Santa Maria delle Anime del Purgatorio ad Arco 
in the historic centre of Naples (on Via dei Tribunali) and you’ll discover a 
death cult that still exists today, even though the church tried to ban it in 
the 1960s. Followers pray to skulls and bring them offerings, even putting them 
on cushions to bring them a little bit closer to heaven. Brides-to-be pray to a 
skull wearing a tiara – “Lucia”, a 16-year-old girl who died shortly after 
getting married. Yes, it’s macabre, but it’s also perhaps the most fascinating 
church in Italy.

The Mergellina Bay area of Naples is a great place to stay in the city. The 
shoreline path really comes to life for the eveningpasseggiata. Fish 
restaurants, pizzerias, (tryToto Sapore 
<http://www.ristorantetotosapore.it/index.php> for its €10 giant specials) and 
ice-cream cafes are busy and atmospheric. Standing at the foot of the Posillipo 
Hill, Mergellina has great views of Vesuvius and the Castel dell’Ovo. Stay at 
theyouth hostel

 (from €16pp B&B a night) and if you can be there in the build-up to the Feast 
of San Gennaro on 19 September – a local holiday – you are in for a spectacular 
Neapolitan firework display lighting up the night sky.
