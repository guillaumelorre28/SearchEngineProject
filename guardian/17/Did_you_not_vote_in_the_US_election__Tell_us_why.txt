The US election race has been a controversial and long-fought battle with 
millions of Americans divided on who to back. But as well as those who were 
firmly in team Trump or team Clinton, there’s another group to think about: the 
non-voters. How do these people feel now?

Voter turnout this year is unknown (it’s not yet clear how many eligible 
voters there were: these figures won’t be available until next year), but an 
academic in Florida hasestimated how many chose not to vote 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/14/us-election-2016-voter-turnout-fell-to-58-per-cent-this-year-est/>
, making projections based on the most recent population figures.

Michael McDonald, an associate professor at the University of Florida, who 
runs theUS Elections Project <http://www.electproject.org/> website, estimated 
that 57.9% of eligible voters made their voices heard in this year’s election, 
down from 58.6% in 2012 and from 61.6% in 2008.


We want to hear from the 42% who didn’t back either Trump, Clinton or other, 
independent candidates. Why didn’t you vote? How do you feel about the result?
