McIlroy underwent a scan on Monday morning

 and has been diagnosed with a stress fracture to a rib. No timetable has been 
given for his return, but the European Tour announced he would miss this week’s 
event in Abu Dhabi.

McIlroy said in a statement: “It’s bitterly disappointing to have to withdraw 
from the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship. I think everyone knows how much I love 
playing this tournament, which is one of the best on the European Tour thanks 
to the incredible support of HSBC and the Abu Dhabi Sports Council.

“To be forced to miss this week through injury is really quite annoying to be 
perfectly honest, but I am sure the tournament will be a huge success and I 
hope everyone involved has a great week.

“In situations like this you simply have to listen to the experts and the team 
I have consulted have all advised me to rest until my rib has fully recovered.”

McIlroy had initially cited the problem as suspected fatigue, after an 
off-season during which he hit a lot of balls in practice trying to decide on 
new equipment, with his former supplier Nike deciding to stop producing clubs 
last year. He played in Johannesburg with his back taped up while taking 
anti-inflammatories.

The American stars Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler, the defending champion, 
are due to play in Abu Dhabi, where McIlroy has finished outside the top three 
only three times in nine appearances.
