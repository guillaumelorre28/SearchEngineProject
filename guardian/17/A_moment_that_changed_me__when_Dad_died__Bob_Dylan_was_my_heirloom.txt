The summer before my dad died, we moved house. Up until that point, we had 
lived with my grandmother; now finally our family had our own space to spread 
out. As the temperature rose, we were gripped by a giddiness that found 
expression in acts of spontaneity. One night, I watched my parents dance round 
a bonfire, the glowing embers rising up to my bedroom window like prescient 
ghosts.

Money was tight, so there was no television set. But we owned a turntable on 
which my dad’s records spun constantly. It played Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash and 
Joan Baez, but mostly, it playedBob Dylan

 and Desire became the anthems of our new life. My brother and I, aged eight 
and 10, climbed trees, built dens and learned the words ofClothes Line Saga 
<http://bobdylan.com/songs/clothes-line-saga/>:

“Have you heard the news?” he said with a grin. 
“The vice-president’s gone mad.”
“Where? “Downtown.” “When?” “Last night.”
“Hmmm, say, that’s too bad!”

We would chant, over and over, consumed by our own hilarity.

It was January and the earth was hard when my dad suffered the aneurysm and 
collapsed in the back garden, close to the spot where the bonfire had blazed. 
The paramedics put him on a stretcher and took him to hospital, but with 
lethargy born of knowing they’d arrived too late. He was 36 going on 37 then, 
the same age as Dylan. Afterwards, our laughter subsided, but we kept on 
playing the records. With no grave to visit, listening to Dylan became our sole 
ritual of remembrance – his sandpaper rasp, a kind of keening. The two men 
became so intertwined in my head, I struggled to tell them apart. My dadwas the 
tousled-haired figure on the cover ofBlonde on Blonde

. A few bars of the harmonica was all it took to summon up his ghost.

Dylan was my dad’s gift to me. I kept on listening to Mr Tambourine Man, Don’t 
Think Twice and A Simple Twist of Fate, and my love of language grew. What 
child wouldn’t be spellbound by songs full of vagabonds, pirates and seasick 
sailors? But it was the strangeness of concepts I was too young to grasp that 
thrilled me most. What made a mouth “mercury” or eyes “warehouse”? How did it 
feel to have “no direction home?”Farewell, Angelina 
<http://bobdylan.com/songs/farewell-angelina/> became my party-piece:

The machine guns are roaring.
The puppets heave rocks.
The fiends nail timebombs
To the hands of the clocks.

I would sing this at church cheese and wines, to the disapproval of the 
assembled audience. Or perhaps not. A lot of allowances were made.

I grew up, as children are wont to do. I didn’t think about my dad or Dylan as 
much. I remained a fan of the music, but I wasn’t obsessed. I couldn’t have 
told you which tracks were on which album and which album was recorded in which 
year. Cataloguing my relationship with him would have diminished it and, 
anyway, I wasn’tthat interested.

Then, one day in early 1995, my brother phoned to say he had bought us both 
tickets to see him play at Brixton Academy. Work had been manic. London felt 
like a long way to go. But finally seeing Dylan step out on to the stage 
brought a sudden rush of euphoria. After an untypically upbeat set, which 
included Positively 4th Street and Love Minus Zero, No Limit, and two encores, 
he returned to perform I Shall Be Released with Elvis Costello. Standing amid 
the sweat and the smoke and the broken beer bottles, it didn’t feel like a gig: 
it felt like an act of faith.

I have seen Dylan a couple of times since, in Glasgow, with my mum. Watching 
him age has been a weird experience – a privilege, but also a reminder of what 
should have been. Together, we have fretted about his spindly legs, his 
arthritic-looking fingers and his broken voice as if we might be responsible 
for drawing up his future care plans. When he failed to come north on his last 
visit to the UK, it felt like a betrayal.

My brother is not around so much these days. He lives hundreds of miles away 
and spends a lot of time in the Far East, but he was up for a visit recently. 
We passed a convivial evening laughing and drinking, while his son and 
daughter, aged nine and 11, performed for us. My nephew looks much like him as 
a child, except that he has red hair and is as yet untouched by loss. His 
party-piece wasSubterranean Homesick Blues 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/13/bob-dylan-subterranean-homesick-blues-50th-anniversary>
. He sang it word-perfect and without hesitation.

And so it goes on: Dylan’s music as an heirloom, passed down the generations.

The great behatted one turns 75 next week. Imagine that. Despite all the hard 
living, he’s about to notch up three-quarters of a century. Doesn’t seems fair, 
somehow. It’s also 50 years since the release of Blonde on Blonde. An abundance 
of artists, including Emmylou Harris, will celebrate both events at Dylan Fest 
in Nashville. Other tributes will be held in cities across the US and the UK.

At home, I expect I’ll raise a glass and play a few tracks. Enough to 
remember, but not enough to make me maudlin. It will be a low-key affair, quite 
unbefitting to his status, but there will no shortage of gratitude, nonetheless.
