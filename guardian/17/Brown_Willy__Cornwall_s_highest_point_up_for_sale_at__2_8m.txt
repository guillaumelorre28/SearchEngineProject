One of the most iconic and rugged spots in the far south-west of Britain – 
Brown Willy on Bodmin Moor – is up for sale.

The tor, which at 420 metres (1,378 feet) above sea level is the highest point 
inCornwall <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cornwall>, lies within a 
1,225-acre plot that includes a granite farmhouse and is on the market with a 
guide price of £2.8m.

Actually, the name of the tor is more poetic than it may seem, coming from the 
Cornish Bronn Wennili, meaning “hill of swallows”. It has two manmade cairns on 
the summit and offers far reaching views across much of Cornwall.

The estate agent, Savills, makes much of the romantic nature of the spot, 
claiming in its blurb: “The rare and diverse beauty of the area has, through 
the ages, turned the heads and filled the eyes and minds of warriors, poets, 
artists and thinkers.”

Medieval field patterns and remnants of old settlements are still visible. The 
northern and eastern sections including Brown Willy tor comprise high downland 
made up of pasture, heather and rough grazing interspersed with outcrops of 
granite.

There are also pockets of woodland which provide a habitat for woodcock and 
red, fallow and roe deer.

The estate agent also points out that it is within striking distance of both 
surfing beaches and good schools. Though the farmhouse looks like something out 
of Poldark, it also has all the mod cons including a wind turbine to generate 
electricity for the property.

Public right of way to the tor will not be affected by the sale, Savills has 
said.
