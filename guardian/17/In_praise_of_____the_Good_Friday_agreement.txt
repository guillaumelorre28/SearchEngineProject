"A day like today is not a day for soundbites ... but I feel the hand of 
history upon our shoulder," declared Tony Blair 10 years ago this week - a 
comment that was as comic as it was true.

The Good Friday agreement (as nationalists call it) or the Belfast agreement 
(as it is known to unionists) did not bring peace toNorthern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland>, but it set in place the terms 
of the deal that did. It saw the leading parties from both communities (but not 
the Democratic Unionist party) agree to a political future based on popular 
consent, power-sharing and non-violence. In the end, it worked.

The extraordinary sight of Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness joking together 
in power as first minister and deputy was the result. Northern Ireland today is 
infinitely improved on a decade ago - evidence that persistence and negotiation 
can overcome violence.

Jonathan Powell, the Downing Street chief of staff whose memoirs were recently 
published, has described the claustrophobia and uncertainty of the hours before 
the deal, with Northern Irish politicians, Ireland's Bertie Ahern and Mr Blair 
trapped in the decaying 1970s Castle Buildings office block, battling for 
reassurance and advantage.

Eventually, an uneasy agreement was reached. "There was no applause, just 
stunned silence," records Powell. He suggests that there are lessons from 
Northern Ireland for other conflicts: talk to your enemies and sometimes 
compromise with them. Good Friday was a compromise, imperfect and not fully 
implemented. But it helped bring peace.
