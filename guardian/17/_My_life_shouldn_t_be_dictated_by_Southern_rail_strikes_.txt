In London Bridge station at 9.30am on Tuesday, big red crosses in LED lights 
shone above all but three of the 15 platforms. Beneath them, a young woman 
darted, talking into a hands-free mobile phone headset.

“I have an exam today and I don’t think I’m going to make it on time,” Benan 
Yolcu, 21, said. She was trying to get to Brighton, where she is studying law 
and criminology.

She had known a strike was coming but said that when she checked a rail 
timetable app there was nothing to suggest it was that day. “I thought it was 
not going to be today,” she said. “And when I checked online [on a rail 
timetable app] it said that everything was running normally.”

Yolcu was one of thousands of commuters caught up in the first of three days 
of strike action by train drivers on Southern rail. Staff have walked out over
plans to dispense with control of the doors

 by guards on all the operator’s services.

All Southern’s 2,242 weekday services were cancelled as a result of the 
industrial action by train drivers’ union Aslef. As a result, London Bridge, a 
terminus forSouthern <https://www.theguardian.com/business/southern> services, 
was quiet at what would have been the tail end of the morning rush hour.

When, where and why is the Southern rail strike taking place?

Commuters were urged not to travel. But that message had not got through to 
the dozens who turned up at Balham station, in south-west London, for their 
morning train. Jessica Knight, 23, arrived there just before 8am, hoping to 
make her way to work at a branch of Savills, the estate agent, in Richmond.

“I didn’t realise it was completely not working,” she said. “It’s annoying 
because there are so many people trying to get to work and do their jobs. They 
need to sort it out, really.”

Joseph Volcy, 32, who works in digital marketing, was another of those turned 
away at Balham. “I just didn’t know and it’s awful,” he said. “By the way I’m 
seeing it I won’t get to work until 11, because it’s in Kingston. I need to get 
on my phone, talk to all my clients one by one.


“It’s not the first time. I’m really disappointed. The train is never on time, 
sometimes it says it’s coming and just disappears. I’m thinking I have to move 
house. It’s bad because it really affects your morale.”

Many found that journeys they expected to measure in minutes stretched into 
hours. Allie Filippova, from Croydon, said her 45-minute trip to Clapham took 
two hours.

”I usually take the train to Balham in the mornings to get the Northern line 
to Clapham. This morning I took the No 50 bus, but after 90 minutes it stopped 
in the middle of nowhere for no apparent reason,” she said.

However, such a delay was not unusual, according to Filippova, even when 
drivers were working: “Last night it took me 1hr 40mins to get home because of 
unreliable Southern trains and a bus that also terminated early for no reason.”


Desperate commuters, it’s time for a rebellion the government can’t ignore |

Rebecca Ellis, from Coulsdon, avoided tortuous travel arrangements by staying 
with her boyfriend in central London. “My step-mum is having to stay at a 
friend’s for the next few days, and my father is having to book a hotel,” she 
said.

“All in all, I’d say we as a family are completely sick of these strikes. We 
understand the point of the unions, but we think both parties need to be 
stopped. It feels like for December we are in a constant state of unrest for 
work commitments.


“My life shouldn’t be dictated by rail strikes, but it has, and will continue 
to be until this madness stops. Too many evenings I have stood cold with 
hundreds of other commuters waiting for 30-45 minutes, sometimes longer for 
delayed or cancelled trains. Many times in the morning we have fought to get on 
an already packed train because they refuse to run a regular service, or simply 
cannot because of driver’s on strike.


“This whole situation has been an appalling mess for the past year, and I, as 
a citizen, demand the government do something.”
