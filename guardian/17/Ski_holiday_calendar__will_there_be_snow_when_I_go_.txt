In these troubled climatic times, skiers and snowboarders can no longer rely 
on adequate snow cover throughout the season. So planning is vital. In 
particular, anyone arranging an early or late holiday should choose somewhere 
at high altitude, then even if there’s insufficient natural stuff, the sub-zero 
temperatures – at least at night – should ensure that artificial snowmaking can 
take place.
• Prices below are per person for one week, including half-board, flights and 
transfers, unless stated otherwise

DECEMBER AND CHRISTMAS

For a trip in early December, pick a high-altitude destination with a glacier 
– just to be certain. Over the holiday period there should ideally be a white 
Christmas at village level, too. Go for a resort that’s over 1,800 metres high 
and snow cover won’t be a worry.

 Val Thorens, France, from Montagnes. 
From late November to early May, snow cover is rarely a problem in Val Thorens

excellent choice of independent ski schools here includes New Generation (
skinewgen.com <http://www.skinewgen.com/ski-schools/val-thorens/>). The resort 
has benefitted from new, attractive buildings, and a great collection of 
restaurants.

Val d’Isère is one of the Alps’ best-known resorts, which means it’s not the 
cheapest. But this is the one place that has plenty of snow at Christmas – 
especially as it has the largest snowmaking operation in Europe. It can pump 
out enough snow to cover Wembley stadium in a metre of snow in less than an 
hour.

Hochgurgl. The climate is snow-sure, so this is one of the first major resorts 
to open for the winter, normally in mid-November.

JANUARY: LOW-SEASON SKIING


Height isn’t so important in January because there should have been decent 
snowfall by now. It’s low season and therefore the month to find good-value 
holidays and slopes that are much emptier. Temperatures can be low, too, so 
wrap up in plenty of layers.

loads of wide and gentle slopes, perfect for beginners and improvers, with 43% 
of the pistes graded blue (easy).

This is a really big ski area with a wide variety of slopes. Austrian resort

hamlets of Les Coches, Montalbert and Champagny. About 70% of the pistes are 
above 2,000m. Plagne 1800 is set below Plagne Centre and, despite its 
traditional-looking chalets, most of the buildings have been built recently.

 Résidence L’Alpaga. 
Several villages, each linked to the piste, makes up Serre Chevalier. It’s a 
quiet area with tree-lined slopes that tend to hold their snow well. The 
weather pattern can be quite different from the resorts further north, so there 
may be plenty of snow here when there’s little elsewhere, and vice versa.

£802pp) in a one-bedroom, self-catering apartment (sleeps 5) at three-star

In December 2016, the new Flexenbahn gondola opens between Zürs and Stuben, 
which in turn links the St Anton and Lech ski areas. It’s been discussed for 
over half a century and now it’s really happening. As a result, the Arlberg 
will be the largest ski area in Austria and among the biggest in the world, 
with 82 lifts.
• From £827 per adult, from £727 per child, both half board in Chalet Sophia 
(sleeps 14) including flights and transfers. The chalet is 15 minutes walk from

This is where all three of my children learnt to ski and it was a wonderful 
place to start. The village has virtually no traffic and is very 
family-friendly. Goats and hens may roam around at Easter, but there’s always 
snow high up. Alpe d’Huez built lifts on its glacier – not for summer skiing, 
but to ensure good cover at the start and end of each season. As a result, Alpe 
d’Huez, and the linked village of Vaujany, offer excellent spring skiing.
• From £625pp in former farmhouse Chalet Dibona (sleeps six). Extras: £60pp 
for return transfers, flights not included. Crèche (six months to five years) 
€135 for five full days with lunch included,skipeak.net
