This week UN International Youth Day <http://www.un.org/en/events/youthday/> 
raises awareness about people aged between 15 and 24, and their contribution to 
society worldwide. Lower-income countries typically have more young people, and 
African nations have the largest proportion of youth. In Uganda, 70% of the 
population is under 25, and almost 50% under 15. Namibia has the highest 
proportion of 15- to 24-year-olds in the world, at 23%.

The world’s population continues to grow, though the global birth rate has 
levelled in recent years. This is due to population momentum: as fewer babies 
are born, population growth is a result of more people living longer. 
Higher-income countries tend to have aging populations and a diminishing 
proportion of young people. Globally, 15- to 24-year-olds make up 16% of the 
population. But every European country – except Albania, with 19% – has fewer 
young people than the global average.Antarctica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica> has no young people – it is the 
only continent with no permanent human population.
