Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, the leading 
contender to become the Republican party’s nominee for US presidential 
candidate, has called for a “total and complete shutdown” of the country’s 
borders to Muslims in the wake of the San Bernardino terrorist attack.


Trump made his most extreme pledge yet – in a race in which he has 
consistently pushed the boat out on issues of race and immigration – in a 
statement released to the media through his presidential campaign team.

 He said there was such hatred among Muslims around the world towards 
Americans that it was necessary to rebuff them en masse, until the problem was 
better understood.

Trump campaign: 'Nothing wrong' with banning Muslims from entering US

“Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous 
threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by 
people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for 
human life,” the billionaire real estate developer said.

Trump put out his incendiary proposal just hours before he was scheduled to 
appear at a rally on board the USS Yorktown, a second world war aircraft 
carrier that is berthed near Charleston, South Carolina. The military location 
was carefully chosen for an address that falls on the 74th anniversary of the 
Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor that brought America into the war. After being 
interrupted several times aboard the ship, he said the proposal was “probably 
not politically correct, but I don’t care”.

To justify his extreme call for a total rejection of all Muslims seeking to 
enter the US, Trump turned to what he claimed to be polling data that 
underlined what he said was the violent hatred of followers of the faith toward 
Americans. However, the statement cites the Center for Security Policy, an 
organisation branded extremist by anti-race-hatred campaigners at the Southern 
Poverty Law Center.

 “Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against non-believers who won’t 
convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to 
Americans, especially women,” Trump’s “policy statement” said.

The former reality TV star added: “Without looking at the various polling 
data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this 
hatred comes from and why we will have to determine.”


Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Trump’s proposed ban would apply 
to “everybody”, including Muslims seeking immigration visas as well as tourists 
seeking to enter the country. Another Trump staffer confirmed that the ban 
would also apply to American Muslims who were currently overseas – presumably 
including members of the military and diplomatic service. “This does not apply 
to people living in the country,” Trump said in an interview on Fox News, “but 
we have to be vigilant.”

In an interview with the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-campaign-defends-muslim-ban-sam-clovis-interview>
, Trump senior policy adviser Sam Clovis said: “I don’t think there is anything 
wrong about asking about religious affiliation.”

Trump’s remarks immediately drew condemnation from Democratic presidential 
candidate Martin O’Malley, who tweeted: “@realdonaldtrump removes all doubt: he 
is running for President as a fascist demagogue.” Otherpoliticians on both 
sides of the aisle quickly followed suit

Trump has come under fire before for his contentious views on how to deal with 
the threat of domestic radicalization of Muslims. He has refused to rule out 
creating a governmentdatabase of all American Muslims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/20/muslim-americans-outrage-donald-trump-ben-carson>
.


He has also called for the deportation of 11 million undocumented Hispanics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/donald-trump-deport-11-million-migrants-is-that-even-possible>
, as well as said were he elected president, he would build a wall along the 
border with Mexico.

Since the Paris attacks

Californiaby a married couple inspired by the terror group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/02/san-bernardino-california-shooting>
, Trump has sought to build his already substantial lead over his Republican 
presidential rivals by portraying himself as being tougher than all others on 
national security.

He responded in a tweet 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/673672413863927808> on Sunday night 
to President Obama’s Oval Office address on combating the Isis threat by 
saying: “Is that all there is? We need a new President – FAST!”

In his address to the nation on Sunday night, the president was at his most 
passionate when he made an appeal to Americans for tolerance in the aftermath 
of the California shooting.

Obama specifically sought to underscore that while Muslims have a 
responsibility to identify and reject extremism within their ranks, Americans 
cannot lose sight of the fact that the vast majority of Islam’s more than a 
billion followers are peaceful.

“We cannot turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war 
between America and Islam,” Obama said. “That, too, is what groups like Isil 
want. Isil does not speak forIslam <https://www.theguardian.com/world/islam>. 
They are thugs and killers. Part of a cult of death. And they account for a 
tiny fraction of a more than a billion Muslims around the world, including 
millions of patriotic Muslim Americans who reject their hateful ideology.

“Muslim Americans are our friends and our neighbors. Our co-workers. Our 
sports heroes. And, yes, they are our men and women in uniform who are willing 
to die in defense of our country,” he added. “We have to remember that.”

Trump’s threat was met with perplexed anger on the part of prominent Muslim 
American groups. Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the largest such group, the 
Council on American-Islamic Relations,said on Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/673979122838855680>: “Where is there 
left for him to go? Are we talking internment camps? Are we talking the final 
solution?”

Republican presidential rival Lindsey Graham, one of a number who have seen 
their prospects of making headway in the campaign subsumed by Trump’s 
dominance, said: “What has been in the past absurd and hateful has turned 
dangerous.”

He told the Guardian: “Donald Trump today took xenophobia and religious 
bigotry to a new level. His comments are hurting the war effort and putting our 
diplomats and soldiers serving in the Middle East at risk. The way to win this 
war is to reach to the vast majority of people in Islamic faith who reject Isil 
and provide them the capability to resist this ideology.

“Today’s statement embraces a ‘fortress America’ approach, is doomed to fail 
and shows a complete lack of understanding by Donald Trump as to what the war 
is all about. As to interpreters and others who have helped American military 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, this policy, if enacted, would be a death sentence.”

Trump’s choice of polling data to hold up his highly controversial views was 
in itself inflammatory. He cited data that purported to show that a quarter of 
those Muslims polled – Trump did not specify what the sample group was, nor 
even what part of the world he was referring to – “agreed that violence against 
Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of global jihad”.


 More than half of the unspecified sample group “agreed that Muslims in 
America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah”.

 The data was drawn from the Center for Security Policy, a neoconservative 
thinktank based in Washington DC whose founder and president, Frank Gaffney, is 
a prominent US Islamophobe. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors 
hate speech in the country, has described Gaffney as being “gripped by paranoid 
fantasies about Muslims destroying the west from within”.

 The SPLC said that “Gaffney believes that ‘creeping Shariah’, or Islamic 
religious law, is a dire threat to American democracy”.

 In 2011, Gaffney, a former Pentagon official in the Reagan administration, 
was barred from the influential Conservative Political Action Conference having 
suggested that two of its organizers had connections to the Muslim Brotherhood.
