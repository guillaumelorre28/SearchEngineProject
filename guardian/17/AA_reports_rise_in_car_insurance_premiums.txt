Drivers are paying almost £82 more for car insurance than a year ago and are 
likely to see premiums rise further, according to the latest figures from the 
Automobile Association (AA).

The average annual cost of a new policy rose to £586 in the three months to 
the end of September, a 16.3% increase on the same period in 2015, the motoring 
group said.

The AA said premiums were driven up by continuing problems with whiplash claims

 and consumers’ growing tendency to shop around for a new policy each year.

Its index of premiums compares the cost of the five cheapest policies for a 
range of different drivers. Insurers were becoming less inclined to offer low 
introductory rates to attract new customers, the AA said.

Other reports have suggested that the cost of motor cover has been pushed up 
by advances in technology.

Additions to cars such as parking sensors on bumpers have increased the cost 
of repairs after accidents. In September,insurer LV= warned

 that it may have to increase premiums after the cost of accident payouts rose.

Michael Lloyd, AA’s director of insurance, said: “We are witnessing sustained 
price increases once again, which is bad news for drivers. I can’t see an 
immediate end to the current upward trend.”

The AA index showed that the cost of cover rose most steeply for 60 to 
69-year-old drivers, with best-buy policies up by 5.4% in the third quarter to 
an average of £366. However, their premiums remained lower than other age 
groups.

Younger drivers continued to pay far in excess of other motorists, with the 
cheapest policies averaging £1,287, an increase of 3.6% since spring this year.

Motorists in Northern Ireland had the highest premiums, with those who shopped 
around for a quote paying an average of £862. By contrast, average premiums 
cost £422 a year in Scotland.

Since the end of September, insurance premium tax (IPT) has gone up

 for the second time in a year.

The AA called on the government to resist a further rise in the autumn 
statement next month and expressed disappointment at the Ministry of Justice’s 
decision todelay planned reforms

 designed to reduce whiplash claims.

“The whiplash epidemic has dogged the British motor insurance industry for a 
decade and continues to do so,” Lloyd said. “I do recognise that whiplash can 
be a serious and debilitating condition. But the activities of claim firms make 
life more difficult for those with a genuine injury.”
