George, if you could “convert” one climate skeptic to become an active 
spokesperson for climate change mitigation, who would you “convert”, and why?

I would hesitate to recommend anyone who claims that man-made climate change 
is not happening and is not a major problem,as the degree of self-deception and 
wilful ignorance required to take this position means that they wouldn't be a 
very useful ally. Who would want to recruit someone with those qualifications?

'How can we live without destroying the ability of others to live? '

 Can we survive without economic growth?

This is a key question and it is under explored. It should now be the central 
issue in economics. How can we live without destroying the ability of others to 
live? Does that mean an end to economic growth, and if so how can that happen 
without harming the prospects of the poor, and while achieving democratic 
consent? No other issue in economics is anywhere near as pertinent and 
important as this one.

Jonny Marshall asks:


 I think it’s great that you talk about the environmental impacts of animal 
agriculture, but, as someone who campaigns for the restoration of wildlife, 
presumably on the basis of being a lover of animals - I’d like to know what you 
think to the ethical questions about eating meat, dairy and eggs?

Many people argue that if we don’t need to eat these things, then if we are 
serious about animal welfare, then on the basis that we do not need to eat them 
in order to live an optimally healthy life, then we should eliminate them 
altogether on those grounds alone.

I feel that this is the cognitive shift that we need in order to move to plant 
based diets, as the reductionism that will result from the environmental 
argument is not enough to offer a real shift. What are your thoughts on this?

I believe that moving towards plant-based diets is one of the most important 
shifts of all. I am an almost-vegan (I estimate my diet as 97% plant-based) and 
I would like to see this becoming the norm.

RudolfRocker asks:

 As someone who works for an environmental NGO, investigating illegal forest 
clearance in Latin America and advocating for its conservation through a 
variety of strategies, I find myself traveling almost 6 weeks of the year. I 
love the job I do, but find it increasingly difficult to justify the long haul 
air travel I do in order to do it. I try and minimise the amount of travel I do 
as far as is possible, and do not own a car and do not eat meat. Must I quit 
the job I love in order to retain ethical consistency regarding each of our 
carbon footprints?

It sounds as if your job demands it, and I imagine you are doing considerably 
more good than harm. But wherever people can cut it out, I feel they should.

 asks:

 Hi George. Given that these issues are so pressing, why is it, do you think, 
that they are not in the mainstream? And how do we get them there? I’m always a 
little surprised that climate change or mass extinction aren’t raised as 
questions on Question Time for example. Especially this week with the release 
of the State of Nature report.

It's a constant struggle to ensure that these issues get any mainstream 
coverage at all. What is salient is not important; what is important is not 
salient. The media has a culture of its own: metropolitan, closely connected to 
wealth and power, detached from the way the great majority of people live and 
from the realities confronting much of the planet. It is hard to think of a 
worse position from which to inform people about what is happening.

Within the mainstream media, there are ever fewer islands of resistance. The 
BBC, with the exception of just one or two journalists, is now more or less a 
write-off, utterly obsessed by political and economic trivia, almost incapable 
of seeing the bigger picture.

 From battery technology that will store and deliver the clean power of the 
future to healthy lab-grown meat and other food, to the advancement of 
education against the traditions that, in particular, hold back the empowerment 
of women who ultimately control our populations, isn’t the truth that the 
future is full of exciting potential for greener and ethical living? Please 
tell us more about the cutting-edge technological advances that will actually 
deliver better outcomes for life on Earth, and the ones you are most excited 
about?

There is plenty of room for hope, though destruction is happening so rapidly 
that sometimes it seems quite remote. I think smart grids offer tremendous 
potential for the widespread deployment of renewables and the closure of 
thermal power plants, especially when coupled with high voltage DC cables, that 
can transport electricity from renewables over large distances.

 Today the EU ‘repurposed’ the higher ambition coalition (formed in Paris to 
push for 1.5 degrees target) for the international civil aviation organisation 
(ICAO). ICAO’s deal, that will be decided on at their next general assembly 
(27th Sep-7th Oct) is based on QUADRUPLING emissions and offsetting them. But 
ICAO’s offset proposal (especially at this scale - 1.8GT by 2050) undermines 
the very purpose of the higher ambition coalition (i.e. to achieve 1.5). What 
can we do to raise awareness about this insanity?

Offsetting aviation emissions is simply not going to work. It demands that 
every other sector of the economy has to cut its own emissions even more than 
under the existing targets. And why should the sector that most favours wealthy 
people (who are overwhelmingly the major users of aviation) be allowed to dump 
its impacts on everyone else?

I think the best exposition of the way in which this balance can be struck is 
Kate Raworth's doughnut economics model. Do take a look at it.

 I’m writing in from India where consumerism is on the rise, but the impact of

believe that worrying about our own individual consumerism is more important 
than challenging large-scale governmental or industrial appropriation of 
resources such as land (mining), water (agriculture, factories), and air 
(pollution)? If a large fraction of water use goes to feed industry or a 
particular crop like sugarcane with state subsidies, say, is it still important 
to focus on reducing individual household water use? Or do we recognise that 
this will make only a small dent and should we instead challenge powerful state

We have to do both. As your great countrymen said, we have to be the change we 
want to see. We become far more morally powerful if we live by the demands we 
make of others. If we live as hypocrites, we weaken our political impact. Of 
course, all of us are hypocrites to some extent, apart from those with no moral 
code against which we can judge their actions (cynics, in other words). But we 
can reduce the extent of our hypocrisy while simultaneously campaigning for 
collective action.

You are right. Our main effort when it comes to behavioural change is to make 
choices such as yours appear mainstream. At the moment they are marginalised 
and often the subject of mockery. In fact it often seems to me that the 
principal effort of many media outlets (particularly papers such as the Mail, 
the Sun, the Express and the Telegraph) is to try to knock down attempts at 
ethical behaviour.

I get pretty tired of having to explain why I have gone vegan. I would love to 
be in a situation where other people feel they should explain why they have not.

 asks:

 Obviously a vegan diet significantly reduces our environmental impact. But 
some specialist vegan foods which would encourage a lot of people to convert 
are too expensive for the average customer. Do you think there is a growing 
cultural elitism when it comes to ethical lifestyles?

As well as this, what is the environmental impact of for instance, soya? I 
sometimes am concerned that these products might be just as bad.

On the whole, vegan diets are cheaper than diets that are heavy in animal 
products. Pulses and beans etc are a really inexpensive way to get protein. 
Nuts and seeds on the other hand can be quite pricey. Remember that the world's 
poorest people are on the whole pretty close to being vegan most of the time. 
However, there is also a cultural veganism that can look and sound elitist. 
That is a perception vegans should counter, in the hope of making this choice 
more widely acceptable.

On the issue of soya, paradoxically, if you want to eat less of it, you should 
eat soya. The reason is that the great majority of soya is fed to livestock, in 
order to produce milk, eggs and meat. And that production process is highly 
inefficient by comparison to eating it yourself. If you eat it directly, you 
can choose soya products that are grown without rainforest destruction and 
other such impacts. That's much harder if you are eating it indirectly, through 
animal products.

Do you think journalists need to change their mindset, given their tendency to 
evaluate governments almost exclusively on their delivery of “GDP growth”, 
regardless of the environmental impact?

I think this is a big issue. GDP is an entirely inappropriate yardstick for 
measuring the health of society, and attempts to maximise GDP often lead to 
environmental destruction and the marginalisation of the poor. Yet both the 
media and politicians remain obsessed by it. Changing this is a major challenge 
but it appears to me to be essential.

 Hi George Monbiot I want to take you to another part of the planet - Rwanda. 
That country has been trying very hard to save the environment, knowing how 
precious it is to the future of the country’s many inhabitants. Whilst the 
government has a very ‘tight’ political hold on the country, there are 
undoubted strides in environmental protection, and Rwanda is the first country 
in the world to outlaw plastic bags. What do you think? Is this the way forward 
for other small countries? Should citizens tolerate ‘strict’ governments so 
long as those governments can deliver environmental protection and reduce 
poverty?

This is very interesting. I don't know anything about Rwandan environmental 
policy, but you have prompted me to look into it. Thank you

 asks:

Currently the onus on recycling is on the consumer but time and time again we 
see non-recyclable materials threaded throughout products which make it 
extremely difficult for people to easily know what to recycle and may lead them 
to just shove it in the household waste bin.

At what point do you think that the manufacturers need to assume the mantle of 
responsibility to use, if possible, up to 100% of recyclable materials?


As well as this, what would you estimate recycling levels in the country to 
move to if the entire system was streamlined?

The question which occurs to me time and again is: why hasn't this already 
happened? It's so easy to do, yet the lobbying power of manufacturers ensures 
that it hasn't materialised. It's a classic example of regulatory capture, of 
corporate power thwarting sensible decisions by taking over the levers of 
government.

Sometimes I do. But then I come across an amazing initiative or campaign and I 
regain it. There are some astonishing, dedicated, inspiring people doing great 
stuff all over the world, and they give me hope. I also find hope in the 
remarkable degree of empathy and altruism that human beings are capable of, 
that far exceeds anything you will find elsewhere in the animal kingdom. We are 
an astonishing species, and we can turn this remarkable capacity to good, 
though that requires constant resistance to the forces wrecking both the living 
world and the prospects for humanity.

Farming is the world's principal cause of habitat and species loss. Of course, 
we need farming, but that should not blind us to its impacts. So of course we 
should discuss those impacts. However, I don't believe that the problem lies 
with intensive farming alone. Extensive farming often causes far greater 
destruction per unit of production. Especially livestock ranching. But 
curiously we generally seem to attach the word intensive to any critique we 
make of the farming industry.

This is a key question and it is under explored. It should now be the central 
issue in economics. How can we live without destroying the ability of others to 
live? Does that mean an end to economic growth, and if so how can that happen 
without harming the prospects of the poor, and while achieving democratic 
consent? No other issue in economics is anywhere near as pertinent and 
important as this one.
 
Jonny Marshall asks:


 I think it’s great that you talk about the environmental impacts of animal 
agriculture, but, as someone who campaigns for the restoration of wildlife, 
presumably on the basis of being a lover of animals - I’d like to know what you 
think to the ethical questions about eating meat, dairy and eggs?

Many people argue that if we don’t need to eat these things, then if we are 
serious about animal welfare, then on the basis that we do not need to eat them 
in order to live an optimally healthy life, then we should eliminate them 
altogether on those grounds alone.

I feel that this is the cognitive shift that we need in order to move to plant 
based diets, as the reductionism that will result from the environmental 
argument is not enough to offer a real shift. What are your thoughts on this?

 Hi George. Given that these issues are so pressing, why is it, do you think,

It's a constant struggle to ensure that these issues get any mainstream 
coverage at all. What is salient is not important; what is important is not 
salient. The media has a culture of its own: metropolitan, closely connected to 
wealth and power, detached from the way the great majority of people live and 
from the realities confronting much of the planet. It is hard to think of a 
worse position from which to inform people about what is happening.

Within the mainstream media, there are ever fewer islands of resistance. The 
BBC, with the exception of just one or two journalists, is now more or less a 
write-off, utterly obsessed by political and economic trivia, almost incapable 
of seeing the bigger picture.

There is plenty of room for hope, though destruction is happening so rapidly 
that sometimes it seems quite remote. I think smart grids offer tremendous 
potential for the widespread deployment of renewables and the closure of 
thermal power plants, especially when coupled with high voltage DC cables, that 
can transport electricity from renewables over large distances.

(27th Sep-7th Oct) is based on QUADRUPLING emissions and offsetting them. But 
ICAO’s offset proposal (especially at this scale - 1.8GT by 2050) undermines

Offsetting aviation emissions is simply not going to work. It demands that 
every other sector of the economy has to cut its own emissions even more than 
under the existing targets. And why should the sector that most favours wealthy 
people (who are overwhelmingly the major users of aviation) be allowed to dump 
its impacts on everyone else?

We have to do both. As your great countrymen said, we have to be the change we 
want to see. We become far more morally powerful if we live by the demands we 
make of others. If we live as hypocrites, we weaken our political impact. Of 
course, all of us are hypocrites to some extent, apart from those with no moral 
code against which we can judge their actions (cynics, in other words). But we 
can reduce the extent of our hypocrisy while simultaneously campaigning for 
collective action.

You are right. Our main effort when it comes to behavioural change is to make 
choices such as yours appear mainstream. At the moment they are marginalised 
and often the subject of mockery. In fact it often seems to me that the 
principal effort of many media outlets (particularly papers such as the Mail, 
the Sun, the Express and the Telegraph) is to try to knock down attempts at 
ethical behaviour.

I get pretty tired of having to explain why I have gone vegan. I would love to 
be in a situation where other people feel they should explain why they have not.

 Obviously a vegan diet significantly reduces our environmental impact. But 
some specialist vegan foods which would encourage a lot of people to convert 
are too expensive for the average customer. Do you think there is a growing 
cultural elitism when it comes to ethical lifestyles?

As well as this, what is the environmental impact of for instance, soya? I 
sometimes am concerned that these products might be just as bad.

On the whole, vegan diets are cheaper than diets that are heavy in animal 
products. Pulses and beans etc are a really inexpensive way to get protein. 
Nuts and seeds on the other hand can be quite pricey. Remember that the world's 
poorest people are on the whole pretty close to being vegan most of the time. 
However, there is also a cultural veganism that can look and sound elitist. 
That is a perception vegans should counter, in the hope of making this choice 
more widely acceptable.

On the issue of soya, paradoxically, if you want to eat less of it, you should 
eat soya. The reason is that the great majority of soya is fed to livestock, in 
order to produce milk, eggs and meat. And that production process is highly 
inefficient by comparison to eating it yourself. If you eat it directly, you 
can choose soya products that are grown without rainforest destruction and 
other such impacts. That's much harder if you are eating it indirectly, through 
animal products.

I think this is a big issue. GDP is an entirely inappropriate yardstick for

environmental destruction and the marginalisation of the poor. Yet both the

 Hi George Monbiot I want to take you to another part of the planet - Rwanda. 
That country has been trying very hard to save the environment, knowing how

government has a very ‘tight’ political hold on the country, there are 
undoubted strides in environmental protection, and Rwanda is the first country

The question which occurs to me time and again is: why hasn't this already

Farming is the world's principal cause of habitat and species loss. Of course, 
we need farming, but that should not blind us to its impacts. So of course we 
should discuss those impacts. However, I don't believe that the problem lies 
with intensive farming alone. Extensive farming often causes far greater 
destruction per unit of production. Especially livestock ranching. But 
curiously we generally seem to attach the word intensive to any critique we 
make of the farming industry.
