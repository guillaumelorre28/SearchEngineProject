A great deal of Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>
’s political success can be put down to his body language and the unusual ways 
he uses his face. The first thing we notice about Trump’s facial expressions is 
the sheer variety. The second is their dramatic, often over-stated character. 
This was evident before and during the presidential election. While the other 
candidates – Hillary Clinton included – were struggling to appear likeable and 
restrained, Trump was busy performing grimaces that would not have looked out 
of place in Japanese Noh theatre. But what are Trump’s signature facial 
expressions, and what do they tell us about him?

1. Alpha face

During the campaign, Trump eclipsed Clinton in the macho stakes. He did this 
by adopting an “alpha face” of lowered brows, narrowed eyes and a firmly set 
mouth. This expression is the antithesis of submissiveness. Psychologists have 
discovered thatsmiling men are widely perceived as less dominant 
<http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&uid=2003-01977-007> 
and that powerful men show reduced levels of smiling. Individuals who want to 
demonstrate that they are not a threat are more likely to raise their eyebrows, 
widen their eyes and flash a smile – the precise opposite of what Trump does in 
this effort to remind everyone that he is not the kind of guy you can push 
around.

Most politicians, when they are angry, will allow themselves a modicum of 
indignation. That’s not enough for Trump. When he’s incensed, he pulls out all 
the stops and produces a larger-than-life spectacle of fury – eyes narrowed, 
brows tightly knitted together, mouth open and jaw tense. It is tempting to 
think that Trump’s outbursts come from a lack of inhibition, but their true 
source is more likely to be his realisation that exhibitions of anger reinforce 
an impression of dominance. This is certainlyin line with research by 
psychologists 
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513814000671>, which 
shows that people with a strong sense of entitlement, or who see themselves as 
powerful and unchallenged, are more ready to engage in public displays of anger 
than others.

3. Chin-jut

One of the ways that Trump tries to look like a tough politician is by jutting 
out his chin. The chin-jut relies on the fact that men with bigger chins have 
higher levels of testosterone and, partly for this reason, are more likely to 
reach positions of power. Ina study at West Point military academy in the US 
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580383?seq=1#fndtn-page_scan_tab_contents>, for 
example, it was discovered that male cadets who had larger chins were more 
likely to reach the rank of general in later life than their small-chinned 
peers. By using the chin-jut, Trump is taking full advantage of this fact – 
tilting his head back, thrusting out his lower jaw and attempting to give the 
impression that he deserves to be in charge.

Although Trump instinctively recognises the demeaning potential of smiling, 
there are occasions when he is prepared to throw caution to the wind and give a 
full-blown smile, with his teeth on display and wrinkles around the corners of 
the eyes – the latter being the feature that defines a genuine as opposed to a 
fake display of happiness. Trump tends to produce these beaming smiles when he 
is in a convivial setting and when he doesn’t feel the need to look like a 
leader, or when he is with people whose company he enjoys – as demonstrated by
his post-election photograph with Nigel Farage

This is the smile that Trump defaults to when he is in the public eye: the 
mouth is closed and the teeth remain hidden. That’s because the risorius 
muscles, which pull the corners of the mouth sideways, are much more active in 
this case than the zygomatic major muscles, which pull the corners of the mouth 
upwards and are otherwise involved in a full-blown smile. The result of this is 
that the zipped smile appears more guarded – and because the mouth is stretched 
sideways, it makes the face look slightly wider.

There could be several reasons why Trump is so attached to the zipped smile. 
One is that it makes him look less submissive. By avoiding a full-blown smile, 
he is able to appear circumspect, while keeping his options open – something he 
evidently likes to do.

Another reason is that zipped smiles make the mouth look wider. There is 
evidence, both from animals and humans, thatmouth width is linked to readiness 
to engage in physical combat 
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115300251>, and it 
has also been found that men with wider mouths are more likely to attain 
leadership positions. Trump might also be unconsciously attracted to the zipped 
smile because it increases the apparent width-to-height ratio of his face, 
which in turn makes him look more masculine and macho. Psychologists have 
consistently shown that men with a high facial width-to-height ratio are not 
only seen as tougher and more attractive,they also have higher levels of 
testosterone and are actually more competitive 
<http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132726>.But 
there is always the possibility that the origins of Trump’s zipped smile are 
cultural rather than personal. It is known, for example, that while Americans 
favour a full-blown smile that showcases the teeth, British people have 
historically preferred tight-lipped versions of the smile. There is every 
chance therefore that Trump’s zipped smile is actuallya throwback to his 
Scottish ancestors <https://www.scottishroots.com/people/donald.php> – which 
would of course demonstrate that his public persona is far less American than 
he has led us to believe.

Some of Trump’s zipped smiles are straightforward, but a large proportion of 
them are accompanied by a puckeredchin. These are what psychologists call 
“blended facial expressions”. The presence of this additional facial expression 
is quite significant because people often pull their chins in when they feel 
threatened – it’s a way of tensing the chin in anticipation of being 
symbolically punched in the face. The fact that a puckered chin features in so 
many of Trump’s zipped smiles suggests that he frequently feels threatened. 
Because zipped smiles are so effective at capturing people’s attention, they 
provide a perfect vehicle for Trump to disguise his feelings of vulnerability. 
All this is likely to be entirely unconscious, but by unwittingly externalising 
his feelings in this way Trump proves that he is not as tough as he would like 
everyone to think.

You can’t help notice the way Trump protrudes and contorts his mouth. In fact, 
his lips appear to have an almost prehensile quality, as if they were an extra 
pair of hands, reaching out from his face to manipulate the world around him. 
There are, however, at least two explanations we might consider. One is that 
Trump amplifies his lip movements because he is not completely convinced that 
people fully understand what he’s saying. Studies have shown that when mothers 
are talking to their infants,they often protrude their lips and make 
exaggerated mouth movements 
<http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781859> in an attempt to 
make themselves better understood. Is Trump operating on a similar assumption? 
Does he feel that the capacity of his audience to understand is so limited that 
he needs to enlist every articulatory channel to get his message across?

It is also conceivable that Trump’s exaggerated mouth movements are simply 
another example of a generalised strategy that involves using “supernormal 
stimuli <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_stimulus>” to attract 
attention to himself. The term supernormal stimuli” was coined by the eminent 
zoologist,Nico Tinbergen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaas_Tinbergen>, 
who discovered that herring gulls and stickleback fish responded with greater 
vigour when they were presented with exaggerated stimuli than when they were 
exposed to the stimuli they would normally encounter. Recent research on humans 
suggests that,like birds and fish, we too have an innate orienting reflex to 
supernormal stimuli 
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513812001225>, and that 
we respond more powerfully to things that are larger-than-life, whether in the 
realm of luxury goods, food or sex. Maybe Trump’s mouth movements – together 
with his histrionic hand gestures and overstated opinions – are all unknowingly 
designed to capitalise on this human reaction.

• So which facial expressions will Trump opt for during his inauguration? Will 
he try to present himself as a tough guy by putting on his alpha face and 
jutting out his chin, or will he embrace everyone with a big smile, or possibly 
even a zipped smile, with or without a puckered chin? Whatever happens, Trump’s 
face is sure to provide important clues about his attitude to the occasion and 
what is going through his mind. Having chosen to be everyone’s face, there’s 
really nowhere for him to hide.
