The sphinx-in-Prada is the great enigma of modern fashion. No matter how many 
hours we spend subtly (well, ish) observing her from across the catwalk, Anna 
Wintour doesn’t give much away. So on the rare occasions she gives an in-depth 
interview, it’s worth forensic study. Here’s what we learnt fromAmy Larocca’s 
interview with Wintour 
<http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/05/anna-wintour-amy-larocca-in-conversation.html>
, in the latest issue of New York magazine:


1. Anna is to Condé Nast what Karl is to Chanel


At least, we think that’s what she’s saying here, about why she was promoted 
to artistic director of Condé Nast: “Chuck [Townsend, Condé CEO] was at a 
conference and Karl Lagerfeld was being interviewed and he was talking about 
what he did at Chanel. And Chuck realized that since Si [Newhouse] had retired, 
we didn’t have anyone filling that role at Condé Nast.” This is all kinds of 
awesome. Being the Karl Lagerfeld of someplace = new life goal.

2. She looks hot in a polo neck

Check out the photo of late-60s Anna that accompanies the piece

. Black polo neck, Monica Vinader-esque pendant, Mona Lisa smile. You could 
channel that for AW15 and look bang on-trend.

3. She is no fan of Don Draper or Claire Underwood.

Intriguingly, the ice queen likes TV shows with good guys in. She doesn’t 
watch House of Cards because “everyone is so evil! There’s no one to root for, 
and you always want to root for somebody.” On Mad Men: “I can see that it’s 
wonderful, but it’s so depressing.” She loved Homeland (she put Claire Danes on 
the cover, remember) andshe’s a huge Game of Thrones fan 
<http://fashionista.com/2015/04/game-of-thrones-spring-covers> – which could be 
good news for Emilia Clarke, who’s already starred on the cover of British 
Vogue.

4. This Peter Lindbergh shot is her favourite ever Vogue cover ...

... even though the model’s eyes “were a little bit closed” and people were 
“asking me if she was pregnant”.

5. She’s got Hillary’s back

“Of course” she’ll be supporting Secretary Clinton. Expect some glamorous 
fundraisers.

6. Gay rights and gun control are the two American political issues she is 
most fired-up about right now

Having seen how “the mood of the country has changed” around gay rights in the 
past five years, she wants to see more conversations about gun control. 
“Politically it’s very tricky territory, and obviously the NRA is a very 
powerful lobby, but I remember a three- or four-year-old getting their hands on 
a gun and shooting their mother and I don’t understand how guns could even be 
anywhere near a child. It’s just insane.”

7. She follows her daughter and Mario Testino on Instagram

She thinks social media is “fascinating and fantastic and wonderful” but “it’s 
just not something I choose to do for myself. I am out there enough as it is.”
