Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has again 
criticised the cost of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet and tweeted that he 
has asked Boeing to offer a price for an older aircraft that lacks the same 
stealth capabilities.

Trump posted his message 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/812061677160202240> on Thursday, a 
day after the president-elect met the chief executives of both aerospace 
companies. In after-hours trading following the tweet, Lockheed shares fell 2% 
and Boeing’s rose 0.7%.

Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I 
have askedBoeing <https://www.theguardian.com/business/boeing> to price-out a 
comparable F-18 Super Hornet!

While the F-35 program has been dogged by problems and costs have escalated to 
an estimated $379bn, it is significantly newer than the F-18 Super Hornet Trump 
referred to. The aircraft does not have the same stealth capabilities.

“They’re two completely different aircraft from different generations,” said 
Phillip Carter, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a 
Washington-based thinktank. “It’s like comparing an old jeep to a Humvee.”

Dan Grazier of the Project on Government Oversight, a non-profit that 
investigates government contractors, said the F-35’s stealth capabilities drove 
up the cost, and its usefulness had not yet been demonstrated. He said 
canceling the program, however, would be “disruptive”.

On the campaign trail, Trump touted his negotiating skills as a businessman, 
and he appears to be using similar tactics as he prepares to take office on 20 
January. It was not clear how his blunt style would translate to Pentagon 
procurement or international diplomacy.


On Wednesday, Trump met the CEOs of Lockheed and Boeing at his resort in Palm 
Beach, Florida. Boeing’s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, said he had guaranteed costs 
would not get out of control for a replacement to Air Force One, the 
presidential plane, another project Trump has called too expensive.

Lockheed’s chief executive, Marillyn Hewson, did not speak to reporters but 
said in a statement the meeting was “productive.” Trump said he wanted to cut 
the F-35 program’s costs.

If Trump scrapped the F-35, such a move by a new administration would have 
some precedent. President Jimmy Carter canceled the B-1 bomber program in June 
1977, although it was resurrected by his White House successor, Ronald Reagan.

Trump’s jockeying for leverage via his Twitter account is likely to be a 
hurdle for all US defense contractors in the next administration, Roman 
Schweizer, aerospace and defense analyst at financial services firm Cowen & Co, 
wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.“We have no idea how this plays out but 
believe ‘Twitter risk’ for defense companies could be a significant issue over 
the next four years,” Schweizer wrote. “This is Lockheed Martin’s time in the 
barrel.”

Lockheed declined to comment. The F-35 program is a critical sales generator 
for the company, accounting for 20% of last year’s revenue of $46.1bn.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Boeing 
spokesman Todd Blecher said in an email the company was committed to providing 
the capability and affordability to meet national security needs.
