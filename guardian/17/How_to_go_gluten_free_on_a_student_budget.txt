I recently overheard a group of students talking about how impossible it was 
to keep up a gluten-free diet at university. Obviously, I sympathise.

The vast majority of my fellow students are uncomplaining consumers of 
late-night pizzas, kebabs and instant noodles.

But I’m gluten intolerant, which means that I have no choice but to avoid it 
altogether.

Gluten is the general term for the proteins found in wheat, rye and barley. So 
if your ingredients don’t contain any of these, you’re pretty much in the 
clear. But watch out for triticale, a wheat-rye hybrid.

An allergy or intolerance to Gluten can have varying effects on your body 
depending on how serious your condition is. This can be anything from a bloated 
stomach, to tiredness and skin rashes. Gluten is particularly dangerous to 
those withCoeliac disease <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease>, an 
autoimmune disorder that leads to problems with digestion.

Many choose to go gluten-free for its health benefits, however, without being 
intolerant at all.

Even though the total number of people being diagnosed with the Coeliac 
disease in the US hasdropped from 0.7% to 0.58% 
<http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2547201>
, the number of people who are choosing a gluten free diet has risen from 0.52% 
to 1.69%. It is believed to help you lose weight, stave off viruses and 
infections, and even reduce the risk of heart disease.

It can be difficult to budget, or to even be sure of what you can and can’t 
eat. But with a little practice and imagination, leading the gluten-free life 
is a easy as pie (with gluten-free pastry, of course).

Cooking from scratch can seem a little daunting, but it’s easy when you have a 
recipe in front of you. Plus it’s so much cheaper, and you’ll have the skills 
and leftover ingredients to make the dish again.

So give it a try. Whether you are gluten-intolerant and need some inspiration 
for new dishes, or just want to give the diet a go, here are a couple of 
recipes to get you started.

Spaghetti bolognese – cost per serving: £1.32

All students know how to cook pasta. (If you don’t, you really should.) The 
gluten-free substitute tastes just the same as the regular. Bottled sauces are 
notorious for hiding gluten products, so don’t bother with them. Whip up a 
fresh sauce with a tin of tomatoes, a chopped onion and some basil.

 My gluten-free spag bol. Photograph: Willow Harreden 
Serves two

1 tbsp cooking oil
½ pack gluten-free spaghetti
1 tin chopped tomatoes
1 onion
200g minced beef
1 tsp dried basil
Grated cheese to taste
Salt and pepper to taste.


1 Put a saucepan on to a medium heat and add a teaspoon of cooking oil.
2 Roughly chop the onions and sweat them for 10 minutes.
3 When the onions are soft and translucent, add the mince. Fry until the beef 
has browned.
4 Add the tinned tomatoes and dried basil, and simmer on a medium heat for 
another 10 minutes. At this point, you can add a stock cube for a richer taste 
(check it is gluten-free). When the sauce is beginning to come together, give 
it a taste to see if you need to add salt and pepper, or an extra sprinkle of 
herbs.
5 Cook the spaghetti according to the instructions on the packet. When the 
pasta is cooked, drain the water, adding a little of the water to the sauce to 
thin if necessary. Serve with grated cheese.


Lemon drizzle cake – total cost: £2.27

Gluten-free but missing those sweet treats? No need to despair. Gluten is a 
protein which helps hold foods together and maintain their shape, which is why 
so many baked goods contain it. But xanthan gum is a perfect substitute – it 
does the same job, and is the key to enjoying gluten-free breads, cakes and 
pastries. Available at the supermarket as a powder for a very reasonable price, 
it is perhaps the most important product I’ve stumbled across. (Without it, I’d 
still be munching on carrots and thinking how desperately unfair my life is.)

1 Pre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. 
2 Using an electric or handheld whisk, beat 175g caster sugar into the butter 
in a large mixing bowl until pale.
3 Sift the flour and the xanthan gum into the bowl and mix slowly till 
combined.
4 Whisk the eggs together separately, and fold them in the mix. Grate the 
lemon zest, and fold that in too.
5 Line and grease a 20cm round tin and pour in the mixture. Level gently with 
a spoon. Bake for 35 minutes, or until the top is golden and an inserted skewer 
comes out clean.
6 As the cake is cooking, make the drizzle. Combine the remaining sugar and 
the lemon juice in a bowl. As soon as the cake is out of the oven, prick a few 
times with a skewer. Pour the drizzle evenly over the cake and leave it to 
cool. Once cool, remove from the tin and serve.
