Britain is facing the prospect of an energy supply crisis which will see 
customers having to pay for a higher level of reliability, it has been reported.

Andrew Wright, a senior partner with energy watchdog Ofgem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ofgem>, is quoted as having warned that 
communities could be split between those who can afford to keep the lights on 
and those who cannot.

According to the Telegraph, he said there was much less flexibility for 
suppliers because Britain had lost fuel capacity due to the closure of coal 
mines.

Wright said: “In the future, not everyone will be able to use as much 
electricity as they want and there will be a need to rewrite the rules.

“We are currently all paying broadly the same price but we could be moving 
away from that and there will be some new features in the market which may see 
some choose to pay for a higher level of reliability.

“One household may be sitting with their lights on, charging their Tesla 
electric car, while someone else will be sitting in the dark.”

An Ofgem spokeswoman said Wright was speaking in a private capacity at a 
conference.

She said: “Ofgem is fully committed to delivering secure supplies for all 
consumers now and in the future. This is our number one priority. This is why 
we have driven up network reliability standards and worked closely with 
government to ensure secure energy supplies.

“In order to protect consumers, every regulator has to look a possible future 
challenges. Mr Wright was talking at a university conference in a personal 
capacity and looking at possible issues that might or might not arise in 10 to 
15 years’ time.”
