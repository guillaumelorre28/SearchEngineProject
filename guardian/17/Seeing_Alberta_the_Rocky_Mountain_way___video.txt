Is Alberta scenic? Does a YouTube chef cook in the woods? In the latest video 
from his Canadian food odyssey, John Quilter, aka YouTube’s The Food Busker, 
starts the day with a barbecue before going whitewater rafting and diving into 
the turquoise waters of Lake Louise, surrounded by misty mountains.

The view, says Quilter, is “truly wondrous. It just stops you in your tracks 
and begs you to pay attention.”
