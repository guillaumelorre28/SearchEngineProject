Hillary Clinton has a 70% chance of winning the election, according to a 
polling-day email from therespected pollster Nate Silver 
<http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=newsletter>.

That’s up from a 65% chance on Sunday night, so Clinton has had a good run in 
the polls in the final days of the campaign. Clinton’s projected margin of 
victory in the popular vote has increased to3.5% 
<http://link.fivethirtyeight.com/click/8062581.143954/aHR0cDovL3Byb2plY3RzLmZpdmV0aGlydHllaWdodC5jb20vMjAxNi1lbGVjdGlvbi1mb3JlY2FzdC8_ZXhfY2lkPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXI/581dcda3b84a9963668b4d16C5615a0f5>
 from 2.9%.

As a lot of you noticed, Nevada

 andFlorida

 flipped from red to blue over the course of Monday. We don’t think that’s a 
particularly meaningful metric, because the forecasts are probabilistic — 
Clinton’s chances of winning Florida increased to 54% from 48%, for instance, 
which is nontrivial but not an especially large change. Still, we know it’s 
something a lot of readers follow. It’s unlikely that any further states will 
flip to Clinton in our final forecast, as she’s too far behind inOhio 
<http://link.fivethirtyeight.com/click/8062581.143954/aHR0cDovL3Byb2plY3RzLmZpdmV0aGlydHllaWdodC5jb20vMjAxNi1lbGVjdGlvbi1mb3JlY2FzdC9vaGlvLz9leF9jaWQ9bmV3c2xldHRlcg/581dcda3b84a9963668b4d16Be6ea546f>
, the next-closest state. It’s possible that Florida and North Carolina could 
flipback to Trump by tomorrow morning, though probably not Nevada, where 
Clinton’s lead is a bit larger.

Who is to blame for not stopping Trump sooner? 

Few suspects spared a mention in Jonathan Freedland’s hall of shame. They 
include the other Republican presidential candidates such as Jeb Bush, Marco 
and Ted Cruz who “allowed themselves to be streamrollered by a reality TV host 
and serially bankrupted businessman”. But also “Trump’s trio of enablers: Rudy 
Giuliani, Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich.”

Those three horsemen of the Republican apocalypse conspired in the lie that a 
snake-oil salesman was fit to be president – and destroyed what remained of 
their reputations in the process.

Plus Trump’s running mate Mike Pence: “the defender of family values who has 
served as the running mate of a thrice-married, serially adulterous, 
self-confessed grabber of women.”

Freedland also rounds on the “indulgence on a epic scale” of the media. And 
there are cameos for Julian Assange and Vladimir Putin.

And finally there’s a dig at the US electorate: 

Some blame surely attaches to the Americans who let Trump keep up the bullying 
and the bigotry and voted for him anyway. There is no escaping the fact that 
north of 40% of the US electorate have been prepared to vote for Trump despite 
everything that he has said and done.One poll found 22% of Trump’s own 
supporters believed he would start a nuclear war 
<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/297383-poll-nearly-half-of-voters-think-trump-will-detonate-a>
. They thought that, but were prepared to vote for him anyway. None of them 
will be able to say: “We didn’t know.”

Who is to blame for this awful US election?

decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political class or by yourselves, the 
people”.

Hillary Clinton emerges from the plane with Bill at her side. Wearing bright 
red she waves at her supporters with both red-gloved hands. She also claps and 
looks very chipper.

Hillary Clinton’s campaign plane has just returned home to Westchester County 
Airport in New York, after her final rally in Raleigh, North Carolina.

CNN has live footage of members of her campaign team staggering off the plane. 
It also showed Bill Clinton milling about in the plane at the top of the steps.

(Some) votes counted

Election day has been and gone for three small towns in New Hampshire, which – 
thanks to the quirks of the electoral system – count their votes as soon as the 
clock strikes midnight. If anyone still uses striking clocks any more.

The turnouts weren’t huge numbers-wise, but then again, nor are the 
populations.

Caution: read nothing into these results.

Hillary Clinton: 4 votes

Donald Trump: 2 votes

The Reuters/Ipsos state of the nation study puts Clinton on a 90% likelihood 
of victory <http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKBN1322J1>.

Votes-wise, the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/polls.html> sees Clinton 
on 46% and Trump on 42.9%.

 – that is, including fringe candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein – also puts 
Clinton ahead, but by only 2.2 percentage points.

A BBC poll of polls <http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37450661> gives 
her a slightly more comfortable cushion of 48% v 44%.

As ever, read Mona Chalabi on the polls and what they are/aren’t telling you:

Hillary Clinton has a 70% chance of winning the election, according to a 
polling-day email from therespected pollster Nate Silver 
<http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=newsletter>.

That’s up from a 65% chance on Sunday night, so Clinton has had a good run in 
the polls in the final days of the campaign. Clinton’s projected margin of 
victory in the popular vote has increased to3.5%

 flipped from red to blue over the course of Monday. We don’t think that’s a 
particularly meaningful metric, because the forecasts are probabilistic — 
Clinton’s chances of winning Florida increased to 54% from 48%, for instance, 
which is nontrivial but not an especially large change. Still, we know it’s 
something a lot of readers follow. It’s unlikely that any further states will 
flip to Clinton in our final forecast, as she’s too far behind inOhio

, the next-closest state. It’s possible that Florida and North Carolina could 
flipback to Trump by tomorrow morning, though probably not Nevada, where 
Clinton’s lead is a bit larger.
 
Who is to blame for not stopping Trump sooner? 

Few suspects spared a mention in Jonathan Freedland’s hall of shame. They 
include the other Republican presidential candidates such as Jeb Bush, Marco 
and Ted Cruz who “allowed themselves to be streamrollered by a reality TV host 
and serially bankrupted businessman”. But also “Trump’s trio of enablers: Rudy 
Giuliani, Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich.”

Those three horsemen of the Republican apocalypse conspired in the lie that a 
snake-oil salesman was fit to be president – and destroyed what remained of 
their reputations in the process.

Plus Trump’s running mate Mike Pence: “the defender of family values who has 
served as the running mate of a thrice-married, serially adulterous, 
self-confessed grabber of women.”

Freedland also rounds on the “indulgence on a epic scale” of the media. And 
there are cameos for Julian Assange and Vladimir Putin.

And finally there’s a dig at the US electorate: 

Some blame surely attaches to the Americans who let Trump keep up the bullying 
and the bigotry and voted for him anyway. There is no escaping the fact that 
north of 40% of the US electorate have been prepared to vote for Trump despite 
everything that he has said and done.One poll found 22% of Trump’s own 
supporters believed he would start a nuclear war 
<http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/297383-poll-nearly-half-of-voters-think-trump-will-detonate-a>
. They thought that, but were prepared to vote for him anyway. None of them 
will be able to say: “We didn’t know.”

Who is to blame for this awful US election?

Hillary Clinton emerges from the plane with Bill at her side. Wearing bright 
red she waves at her supporters with both red-gloved hands. She also claps and 
looks very chipper.

Hillary Clinton’s campaign plane has just returned home to Westchester County 
Airport in New York, after her final rally in Raleigh, North Carolina.

CNN has live footage of members of her campaign team staggering off the plane. 
It also showed Bill Clinton milling about in the plane at the top of the steps.

Election day has been and gone for three small towns in New Hampshire, which – 
thanks to the quirks of the electoral system – count their votes as soon as the 
clock strikes midnight. If anyone still uses striking clocks any more.

The turnouts weren’t huge numbers-wise, but then again, nor are the 
populations.

Caution: read nothing into these results.

The Reuters/Ipsos state of the nation study puts Clinton on a 90% likelihood

Votes-wise, the New York Times

on 46% and Trump on 42.9%.

Clinton ahead, but by only 2.2 percentage points.

A BBC poll of polls <http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37450661> gives 
her a slightly more comfortable cushion of 48% v 44%.
