tranquil white carpet.

Ride the Dazzle ferry, Liverpool

Decorated by the “godfather” of British pop art, Sir Peter Blake, the Dazzle 
ferry is the result of an a eye-popping project to adorn a working Mersey ferry 
in multi-coloured dazzle paint of the kind used to camouflage ships in the 
first world war. An on-board exhibition will tell passengers more about the 
history of dazzle paint. The Dazzle ferry (previously known as Snowdrop) 
operates from 26-31 December, with a reduced service. If the weather is bright, 
there’s no better way to enjoy the Liverpool skyline.

It’s a movie classic, and usually gets a Christmas showing, but now you can 
learn about the story of the Dambusters outside of the living room, with this
