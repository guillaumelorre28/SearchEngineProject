Child abusers and rapists mostly get away with it. That’s the harrowing truth. 
“The problem is much bigger than shown in official statistics, as most crimes 
are not disclosed and/or reported,” 
<https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect/child-sexual-abuse/sexual-abuse-facts-statistics/>
 says the NSPCC. “Most sexual abuse isn’t reported, detected or prosecuted. 
Most children don’t tell anyone they’re being sexually abused.” The vast 
majority of abuse isn’t committed by random strangers: it’s by relatives, 
carers, people in positions of authority. It’s about exploiting a disparity of 
power, with the belief that the victim wouldn’t dare speak out. A society that 
leaves survivors of sexual abuse and rape with internalised shame and guilt 
silences them, too.

That’s why Eric Bristow’s disturbing tweets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/29/eric-bristow-loses-sky-sports-role-twitter-sex-abuse-story-comments>
 matter. They are extreme but indicative of a mindset shared by all too many. 
“Might be a looney but if some football coach was touching me when I was a kid 
as I got older I would have went back and sorted that poof out,”he tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/ericbristow/status/803353321725628417>. “Dart players 
tough guys footballers wimps,” continued his tirade. “U got to sought him out 
when u get older or don’t look in the mirror glad I am a dart player proper 
men.” An apology did eventually come: “Sorry meant paedo not poof.”

Where to even begin. Crude homophobia mixed with shaming survivors of child 
abuse as “wimps”. Thesurvivors of child abuse at football clubs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/27/fa-review-child-sex-abuse-football-barry-bennell-claims>
 who are now speaking out are showing astonishing courage. The lives of many of 
them have been nearly destroyed by what they suffered. If the ignorant raving 
of the likes of Bristow are left unchallenged,then other survivors will be 
deterred 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/26/barry-bennell-victims-football-paedophile-interviews>
 from coming forward. Such comments inflict genuine damage on people too: if 
you’ve internalised a “maybe it was my fault” sense of shame, if you feel 
emasculated, then Bristow’s rant will be a source of hurtful anguish.

Football sexual abuse scandal could be worse than Jimmy Savile case, says Andy 
Woodward

Predictably, Bristow relied on the “you can’t say anything any more”-type 
defence, claiming: “Everybody that works on TV is frightened to say the truth 
because they are frightened to lose their job.” Well,Bristow has lost his role 
at Sky Sports

what i was saying was when the football lads got older and fitter they should 
have went back and sorted him out

What Bristow’s tweets underline is a toxic form of unreconstructed 
masculinity, and the damage that it inflicts. This form of masculinity defines 
itself by being “tough” and aggressive. Real men don’t cry. Real men get into 
fights. Real men brag about how many shags they’ve had and how little they care 
about the women in their lives. And so you end up with a society where violence 
against women and children is rampant on the one hand, andthe biggest killer of 
men under 50 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/15/suicide-silence-depressed-men> 
– partly because they’re unable to open up because it’s “unmanly” – is suicide. 
A form of masculinity that is so toxic that survivors of child abuse are deemed 
weak and therefore intimidated into silence. And unless it is challenged, then 
many more people will suffer.
