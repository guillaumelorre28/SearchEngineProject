In Cape Town, the king of Camps Bay remains Cafe Caprice 
<http://cafecaprice.co.za/>, a beachfront institution that reigns over the posh 
strip’s lively bar scene — though you should feel free not to commit, grabbing 
a drink at each of the dozens of bars along the street as you work your way 
through the evening.
