Environmentalists have warned that Australia’s repeated delays on mandatory 
palm oil labelling are allowing deforestation and the destruction of orangutan 
habitats to continue unabated.

A proposal requiring palm oils 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/palm-oil> to be specifically listed on 
food labels has now been under consideration by Australian and New Zealand 
ministers for more than five years.

The changes would prevent palm oil from being listed generically as “vegetable 
oil”, helping to inform consumers, limit demand for unsustainable palm oil 
products, and reducethe devastating impact that plantations have on rainforests 
and orangutan habitats

, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia.

The proposal again came before the Australian and New Zealand Ministerial 
Forum on Food Regulation late last month, but any decision was put off until at 
least April.

The Zoos Victoria chief executive officer, Jenny Gray, who is leading one of 
several concurrent palm oil campaigns, said she was confused about what 
additional information the ministerial council was seeking.

“We know we’re losing a thousand orangutans a year at the moment, so if we 
delay for another year, that’s more habitats destroyed, that’s more orangutans 
impacted by this,” Gray said.

“Longer delays, it really is unclear why we would want to do that when this is 
such an urgent issue,” she said.


The decision on palm oil labelling is wrapped up in a broader review of 
labelling laws, which began in 2009.

In 2011, an expert panel, led by former Labor health minister Neal Blewett, 
recommended that added sugars, oils or fats be individually labelled.


The ministerial forum made some progress at its meeting late last month, 
splitting its consideration of palm oil from other labelling changes.

Blewett told Guardian Australia he thought the process had been “fairly slow”, 
but said the labelling reforms were complex and presented plenty of issues for 
stakeholders to “fight over”.


“It’s been fairly slow, I’ve got to say. And I’ve not been following it 
closely because I’ve not been involved in the later debates,” he said.

He said he had recommended mandatory palm oil labelling on health grounds, 
because it was arguably not as healthy as other vegetable oils.


Deforestation <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/deforestation> and 
habitat destruction, he said, were environmental concerns and couldn’t really 
be considered in the labelling process.

“The value side issues… you can’t start laying down rules for those,” he said.

“What you can do is get the market to work effectively so that companies will 
feel the need to, when they list vegetable oils, find it necessary to say that 
they haven’t got palm oils.”


The move faces opposition from the food industry, represented by the 
Australian Food and Grocery Council.


A council spokesman said many Australian companies had already begun using 
only sustainably sourced palm oil in their products.

He said that created a risk palm oil labelling would confuse consumers, who 
would be unable to tell sustainable and unsustainable products apart.

“The problem is there is low understanding of [certified sustainable palm oil] 
and consumers may confuse products that use responsibly sourced palm oil with 
those that don’t,” he said.

“We want to encourage companies to make the substantial investment in CSPO, 
but potentially lumping CSPO and non-CSPO products under one label may act as a 
disincentive.”

A survey commissioned by Zoos Victoria found 
<http://www.zoo.org.au/news/australians-and-new-zealanders-agree-palm-oil-should-be-labelled>
 84% of Australians and 92% of New Zealand consumers supported the initiative.


The labelling of palm oil, which is high in saturated fat, is also supported 
on health grounds by the Australian Medical Association.

The European Union implemented specific oil labelling in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/12/eu-labelling-changes-palm-oil-consumer-change>
, and the United States and Canada have adopted similar measures.

The EU’s experience, according to Gray, showed that the costs to industry were 
negligible.

She said it may actually be more costly for companies to maintain two 
different labelling regimes; one for Australia and another for the EU or US.

“It’s easy to say we don’t want change because it would cost us, it would be 
really good to see how they would quantify that,” Gray said. “Then to give the 
consumer the choice, I think people are happy to pay a few extra cents to know 
that they’re buying a sustainable product.”

The ministerial forum will meet again on 28 April.
