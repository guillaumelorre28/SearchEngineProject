Jeremy Corbyn’s conference speech was followed by a row over the provenance of 
the text, as it emerged that the leadership team used a lengthy passage written 
years ago by the author and former political adviser Richard Heller.

Heller said that the Labour leader had used the passage after he posted the 
text to the Labour leader’s team two weeks ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/29/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader-conference-speech>
. He had sent the same passage to Ed Miliband in 2011, and had offered versions 
of it to every leader since Neil Kinnock.

However Heller, a former adviser to Denis Healey, said that the use of the 
passage,which he published on his blog in August 2011 
<http://www.richardheller.co.uk/2011/08/belles-lettres/a-collection-of-zingers/>
 under the title “a collection of zingers”, did not amount to plagiarism 
because he had sent it in himself .

Corbyn’s office also said that Neale Coleman, a senior figure in the leader’s 
office, who wrote the speech, had done nothing wrong. ALabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> spokesman said: “Neale Coleman 
has spoken to Richard Heller. He liked some of his ideas and he sourced some of 
his material.”

Heller told the Guardian that he had not spoken to Coleman until the Spectator 
magazinereported that Corbyn had used a lengthy section 
<http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/09/much-of-jeremy-corbyns-speech-today-was-written-for-ed-miliband-in-2011/>
 from a post on his website from four years ago.

Heller told the Guardian: “I sent it to team Corbyn as I have sent it to each 
and every Labour leader before him. I am very proud of that passage. I had no 
idea they were going to use it until today, but I am delighted that they have.

“It is a very fine passage. I sent it by post two weeks ago, to the leader of 
the opposition’s office. I offered it to him as Labour leader, because I felt 
it was a passage applicable to anyone with the values of the Labour party.

“I also published it on my website, probably about four years ago. It may look 
like they took it from there but that isn’t the case and to say it was stolen 
or plagiarised is nonsense.”

The passage was delivered in the final section of Corbyn’s speech in which he 
spoke of the contrast, “since the dawn of history”, between people who are born 
to privilege and those who have to fight in life.

Corbyn began the section saying: “Since the dawn of history, in virtually 
every human society, there are some people who are given a great deal and many 
more people who are given little or nothing.”

The Spectator blog was written by Alex Massie, a friend of Heller’s. He 
highlighted the text in Heller’s 2011 blog and Corbyn’s speech on Tuesday.

The section in Corbyn’s speech with the words from Heller’s 2011 blog marked 
in bold:


“Since the dawn of history in virtually every human society there are some 
people who are given a great deal and many more people who are given little or 
nothing.

Some people have property and power, class and capital, status and clout which 
are denied to the many. 

And time and time again, the people who receive a great deal tell the many to 
be grateful to be given anything at all.

They say that the world cannot be changed and the many must accept the terms 
on which they are allowed to live in it.

These days this attitude is justified by economic theory. 

The many with little or nothing are told they live in a global economy whose 
terms cannot be changed.

They must accept the place assigned to them by competitive markets.


 By the way, isn’t it curious that globalisation always means low wages for 
poor people, but is used to justify massive payments to top chief executives.

Our Labour party came into being to fight that attitude. 


That is still what our Labour party is all about. Labour is the voice that 
says to the many, at home and abroad: “you don’t have to take what you’re 
given.”

Jeremy Corbyn's speech: what he said – and what he meant

Labour says: “You may be born poor but you don’t have to stay poor. You don’t 
have to live without power and without hope.

 “You don’t have to set limits on your talent and your ambition – or those of 
your children.

“You don’t have to accept prejudice and discrimination, or sickness or 
poverty, or destruction and war.

 “You don’t have to be grateful to survive in a world made by others. 

No, you set the terms for the people in power over you, and you dismiss them 
when they fail you.”

 That’s what democracy is about.

That has always been our Labour party’s message. 

You don’t have to take what you’re given.

 It was the great Nigerian writer Ben Okri who perhaps put it best: “The most 
authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to 
transform, to love”.

But they’re at it again. 

The people who want you to take what you’re given. 

This Tory government. 

This government which was made by the few – and paid for by the few.

Since becoming leader David Cameron has received £55m in donations from hedge 
funds. Frompeople who have a lot and want to keep it all.

That is why this pre-paid government came into being. 

To protect the few and tell all the rest of us to accept what we’re given. 

To deliver the £145m tax break they have given the hedge funds in return. 

They want us to believe there is no alternative to cutting jobs. Slashing 
public services.Vandalising the NHS. Cutting junior doctor’s pay. Reducing care 
for the elderly.

Destroying the hopes of young people for a college education or putting 
university graduates into massive debt.

 Putting half a million more children in poverty.

They want the people of Britain to accept all of these things.

They expect millions of people to work harder and longer for a lower quality 
of lifeon lower wages. Well, they’re not having it. 

Our Labour party says no. 

The British people never have to take what they are given.”
