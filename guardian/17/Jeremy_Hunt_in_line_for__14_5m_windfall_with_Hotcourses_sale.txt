The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt>, is set to become £14.5m 
richer after Hotcourses, the educational listings company he co-founded in 
1990, was sold to an Australian firm.

Hotcourses is being bought for £30.1m by IDP Education, a Melbourne-based 
student placement company that co-owns the popular IELTS English language 
proficiency test, IDP said in a statement.

Companies House listings for Hotcourses 
<https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/02471319> shows it is 48% owned by 
Hunt, who set it up with his childhood friend Mike Elms, who is still a 
director. Hunt stepped down as a director in 2009, with his shares held in a 
blind trust since then.

Hunt said he hoped to use his windfall to “campaign for causes I believe in” 
once he leaves politics.

Hunt, who has previously collected significant dividends from the company, 
will be in line for a payout of just under £14.5m, making him potentially the 
richest member of Theresa May’s cabinet.

Hotcourses puts together databases of places to study, and has a contract with 
the British Council to run the Education UK website, which offers information 
to overseas students seeking to take courses in Britain.

It has been linked to other purchasers in the past 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/08/jeremy-hunt-17m-hotcourses-sale-inflexion>
, but no deals went through. While Hunt had no say in the sale to IDP, the 
timing will be awkward for a health secretary dealing withclaims of a winter 
crisis in the NHS

In a statement, Hunt said: “I am incredibly proud to have set up a successful 
business, even prouder of the current Hotcourses team who have taken it from 
strength to strength, and intend to use a significant proportion of the 
proceeds to campaign for causes I believe in when I eventually leave frontline 
politics.”

Hotcourses runs education search websites including Whatuni, Postgraduate 
Search, the Complete University Guide, as well as sites under its own name.

Announcing the sale, IDP said Hotcourses had 2 million registered users and 
received 66m annual website visits. The company’s last accounts show it had an 
operating profit of just over £2.5m on a turnover of £10.6m.

Hunt has said previously that the success of Hotcourses came only after he and 
Elms had pursued a string of failed ventures, including a scheme to export 
marmalade to Japan, and building children’s playgrounds.

On his website, Hunt told his constituents in South West Surrey that he 
understood the hardship of starting up a new business: “A lot of people who 
start their own business do so because they think it’s a good way to make a lot 
of money, but when you start it becomes simply a matter of survival. It’s a 
daily struggle, which is why small business people tend to be very down to 
earth and practical,” he said.

Cabinet wealth

The sale of Hotcourses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/16/jeremy-hunt-in-line-for-145m-windfall-over-hotcourses-sale>
 will probably make Jeremy Hunt the richest member of Theresa May’s cabinet. 
The “probably” must be stressed however, because estimations of private wealth 
are generally little more than educated guesses. Hunt’s windfall is an 
exception, as the sale price of Hotcourses – £30.1m – and the 48% stake he owns 
are matters of public record.

As such, this list of Hunt’s fellow wealthy cabinet members should be taken as 
an approximation.


1 Jeremy Hunt

The health secretary has not controlled Hotcourses since 2009, and would 
probably have preferred that news of the sale did not come amid a winter crisis 
for theNHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs>. Hunt set up the company 
with his childhood friend, Mike Elms, in 1990. It makes money from websites 
giving databases of places to study, and has a contract with the British 
Council to run the Education UK website, which offers information to overseas 
students. Hunt has previously enjoyed dividends from the company, including 
£972,538 received in 2015.

The chancellor’s wealth is far less well documented, but is generally reported 
to be somewhere around £8m, a sum acquired mainly from Hammond’s varied and 
energetic business career before parliament.

An exhaustive Financial Times profile 
<https://www.ft.com/content/ecc02856-5e56-11e6-a72a-bd4bf1198c63> of the 
chancellor lists some of his endeavours which did less well, including a scheme 
to sell UK trips to Iranians – the 1979 overthrow of the Shah put paid to that 
– and a company making cardiac equipment, which he sold.

Most successful was Castlemead, a housebuilding company that expanded into 
constructing doctors’ surgeries. In 2007, when Hammond was a shadow minister, 
thecompany paid him and his wife

 more than £1.7m in dividends.

When he entered government in 2010, Hammond’s holding was placed in a trust 
that has a controlling interest in Castlemead.

The foreign secretary’s wealth is much more well-known than most MPs and much 
more varied – his lastentry in the parliamentary register 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/170109/johnson_boris.htm> 
of financial interests contained more than two dozen items.

While Johnson comes from a family wealthy enough to send him to Eton, his 
money is primarily earned and is based around his tendency to do at least three 
jobs at the same time.

As well as his £134,000 cabinet minister’s salary, Johnson earned just under 
£23,000 a month writing articles for the Daily Telegraph – a contract he 
terminated on entering government.


He also spent nearly a year being both an MP and the mayor of London, the 
latter of which paid just over £140,000 a year.

Finally, there are the books he has written, not least the title about Winston 
Churchill for which he received a reported £500,000 advance.

His latest register of interests showed book-related payments of more than 
£113,000 for the period, covering everything from £27,000 in royalties to £428 
for the sale of Hungarian sub-rights.

All that, plus the £3m or so value of the house he own in Islington, could 
well see Johnson’s wealth approach that of the chancellor.

Beyond the trio above, the riches or not of the current cabinet are much 
less-well documented. But Javid, the communities secretary, is by no means poor.

His father, an immigrant from Pakistan, worked as a bus driver before setting 
up a shop, while Javid went from university to work in investment banking.

He rose through the ranks of Chase Manhattan and then Deutsche Bank, reaching 
board level at the latter. Javid has declined toconfirm reports he made 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/11/sajid-javid-a-wonderful-life-banker-culture-minister>
 up to £3m a year in his old job.

Javid lives in a home reportedly worth more than £4m in Fulham and rents out 
another house in Chelsea. He also owns a house in Bristol.
