Afternoon summary

 * Sir Ivan Rogers has announced that he is resigning early from his post as 
Britain’s ambassador to the EU. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/03/uk-ambassador-to-eu-quits-amid-brexit-row>
 He had been due to go in October, but he revealed today that he will stand 
down within the next few weeks. Some Brexiteers view him as an incorrigible 
Europhile who sabotaged David Cameron’s attempts to achieve a far-reaching EU 
renegotiation (see 2.08am) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/03/corbyn-labour-fabian-society-report-saying-labour-needs-pact-with-other-parties-to-win-election-politics-live?page=with:block-586bad67e4b08d2df8a6e0da#block-586bad67e4b08d2df8a6e0da>
 and the news of his departure has been warmly welcomed by those pushing for a 
“hard” Brexit. By contrast, pro-Europeans likeNick Clegg (see 2.18pm)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/03/corbyn-labour-fabian-society-report-saying-labour-needs-pact-with-other-parties-to-win-election-politics-live?page=with:block-586bb157e4b0c44bce1f0576#block-586bb157e4b0c44bce1f0576>
andLord Mandelson (see 2.49pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/03/corbyn-labour-fabian-society-report-saying-labour-needs-pact-with-other-parties-to-win-election-politics-live?page=with:block-586bb919e4b0c44bce1f05af#block-586bb919e4b0c44bce1f05af>
 have said that his premature exit is a blow for the government and that it 
suggests ministers are having problems accepting unpalatable expert advice. 
Rogers has not said why he is quitting early but no one is challenging reports 
saying that he clashed with ministers who wanted him to be more positive about 
Brexit. There is nothing particularly unusual about governments wanting the top 
civil service jobs to go to people who are at least not hostile to their 
political aims and it is conceivable that a more pro-Brexit replacement could 
help Theresa May’s government get what it wants (once it actually decides what 
it wants.) But May cannot take credit for forcing him out because his departure 
seems to have taken Number 10 by surprise. And it is also questionable whether 
there is anyone at all in the Foreign Office, or in the civil service 
generally, with the knowledge and experience to replace Rogers who would be 
pro-Brexit enough for the hardcore anti-Europeans putting pressure on May. 
 * Jeremy Corbyn has rejected a Fabian Society report saying Labour needs to 
think about forming partnerships with other anti-Tory parties because it has no 
chance of winning the next general election on its own. (See 9.14am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/03/corbyn-labour-fabian-society-report-saying-labour-needs-pact-with-other-parties-to-win-election-politics-live?page=with:block-586b6090e4b0c44bce1f03bc#block-586b6090e4b0c44bce1f03bc>
 * Steve Hilton, David Cameron’s former head of strategy and a leave supporter 
during the EU referendum, has accused Theresa May of adopting a closed, 
“mean-spirited” approach to Brexit. Speaking on the Word at One, he said that 
he and others in the Vote Leave campaign called for an “open Brexit”. But the 
government has taken the opposite approach, he claimed, citing as an example 
the Conservative conference proposals (since abandoned) for firms to have to 
record the number of foreigners they employ. Hilton said: 
What I worry about is that the tone that Theresa May has set so far is exactly 
the opposite of that [“open Brexit”], exactly what we don’t need; a kind of 
closed Brexit, a mean-spirited, narrow version of what leaving the EU should 
have been all about ...

What Theresa May is doing, certainly again in the tone that she and her 
ministers have struck, is to give the impression that the UK is pulling up the 
drawbridge, and instead of being open to the world, being closed to people. 
That is bad for our economy and our society.

 * Major City employers are expected to decide within weeks whether they need 
to move business out of the UK as a result of the Brexit vote, the lobby group 
for Paris has predicted as it sets it sights on luring up to 20,000 roles away 
from London. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/paris-lobby-city-london-firms-decide-leave-uk-within-weeks-brexit>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Leave Means Leave has welcomed Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation. This is from is 
co-chair, Richard Tice.

Sir Ivan was a remainer who consistently failed to acknowledge the benefits 
Brexit will bring to Britain. His claims that a Brexit deal would take ten 
years to secure demonstrates the pessimistic and unrealistic outlook he had for 
British independence.

It would have been completely inappropriate for him to stay in post and 
obstruct the Brexit process any further.

His successor must be someone 100 per cent committed to embracing the 
opportunities a swift, clean Brexit will bring Britain and crucially, someone 
independently minded who will stand up for what is best for Britain in the 
upcoming negotiations.

Osborne defends Rogers, praising him as 'perceptive, pragmatic and patriotic'

George Osborne, the former chancellor, has praised Sir Ivan Rogers.

Ivan Rogers helped me on many ECOFIN deals over the years. He is a perceptive, 
pragmatic & patriotic public servant. Thank you.

 <https://twitter.com/George_Osborne/status/816313127553875969> 
His tweet is not hostile to the government, but it is implicitly critical of 
those in his party and elsewhere who have questioned Rogers’ professionalism.

Here’s Jonathan Isaby, editor of the pro-Brexit BrexitCentral website 
<http://brexitcentral.com/>, on Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation.

Sir Ivan was due to leave his posting in Brussels later this year in any case; 
would those decrying his departure not have found it more disruptive for him to 
have to be replaced just a few months into the Brexit negotiations? Or are they 
simply upset at the prospect of a UK ambassador in Brussels who accepts the 
referendum result and can be relied on to support the prime minister in 
delivering a successful Brexit?

Dame Margaret Beckett, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>
 former foreign secretary, said Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation created a “crisis” 
for the Foreign Office.

If, as it appears, [Rogers] is lost because he gave honest advice, that is not 
a good precedent. I think it is a crisis for the prime minister and for the 
Foreign Office. It is deeply alarming.

My colleague Matthew d’Ancona has written his take on Sir Ivan Rogers’ 
resignation. Here is an excerpt.

As a former home secretary, May is perfectly well-acquainted with the nuances 
and complexities of the EU. But she expected and required more from the UK’s 
permanent representative than to be reminded querulously of the obstacles to 
exit. As a prime minister who owes her job to a referendum that brought down 
her predecessor, she wanted the top diplomat in Brussels to offer solutions – 
and fast.

That said, Sir Ivan has long been a favourite (and useful) whipping boy for 
senior Tories. It suited them to roll their eyes, accuse him of going native 
and blame the failure of this or that negotiation upon his lack of patriotic 
fervour. Now they won’t have Rogers to kick around.

He will be replaced quickly enough, doubtless by someone billed by No 10 as a 
“safe pair of hands” – code for “more competent”. May will weather this 
particular squall. But a troubling question will linger and loom over the 
Brexit talks long after Sir Ivan has moved on: what if he was right?

And here is his article in full.

Sir Ivan Rogers’ sudden departure is a blow to Theresa May’s Brexit plans |

Gerard Batten, Ukip’s Brexit spokesman, has welcomed Sir Ivan Rogers’ 
resignation. In a statement 
<http://www.ukip.org/goodbye_sir_ivan_welcome_nigel_farage> Batten says that 
the government should not replace him until the European Communities Act has 
been repealed. Then Theresa May should consider appointing Nigel Farage to the 
post, Batten says.

When Farage was asked about this proposal, he told the Press Association: 
“That’s very sweet of [Batten]. It would be lots of fun, but it’s never going 
to happen.”

Farage says 'a lot more' diplomats should follow Rogers and resign

Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, told the Press Association that “a lot 
more” British diplomats should follow Sir Ivan Rogers and resign.

I think it would be appropriate if a lot more people in that position, British 
ambassadors, left. The world has changed. The political establishment in this 
country and the diplomatic service just doesn’t accept the vote.

He also said Theresa May should replace Rogers with a “firm Brexiteer”.

She should welcome it with open arms and put a firm Brexiteer in the position. 
Somebody who recognises that the world has changed, somebody tough, so we can 
get on with Brexit.

 * Sir Ivan Rogers has announced that he is resigning early from his post as 
Britain’s ambassador to the EU. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/03/uk-ambassador-to-eu-quits-amid-brexit-row>
 He had been due to go in October, but he revealed today that he will stand 
down within the next few weeks. Some Brexiteers view him as an incorrigible 
Europhile who sabotaged David Cameron’s attempts to achieve a far-reaching EU 
renegotiation (see 2.08am) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/03/corbyn-labour-fabian-society-report-saying-labour-needs-pact-with-other-parties-to-win-election-politics-live?page=with:block-586bad67e4b08d2df8a6e0da#block-586bad67e4b08d2df8a6e0da>
 and the news of his departure has been warmly welcomed by those pushing for a 
“hard” Brexit. By contrast, pro-Europeans likeNick Clegg (see 2.18pm)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/03/corbyn-labour-fabian-society-report-saying-labour-needs-pact-with-other-parties-to-win-election-politics-live?page=with:block-586bb157e4b0c44bce1f0576#block-586bb157e4b0c44bce1f0576>

 have said that his premature exit is a blow for the government and that it 
suggests ministers are having problems accepting unpalatable expert advice. 
Rogers has not said why he is quitting early but no one is challenging reports 
saying that he clashed with ministers who wanted him to be more positive about 
Brexit. There is nothing particularly unusual about governments wanting the top 
civil service jobs to go to people who are at least not hostile to their 
political aims and it is conceivable that a more pro-Brexit replacement could 
help Theresa May’s government get what it wants (once it actually decides what 
it wants.) But May cannot take credit for forcing him out because his departure 
seems to have taken Number 10 by surprise. And it is also questionable whether 
there is anyone at all in the Foreign Office, or in the civil service 
generally, with the knowledge and experience to replace Rogers who would be 
pro-Brexit enough for the hardcore anti-Europeans putting pressure on May. 
 * Jeremy Corbyn has rejected a Fabian Society report saying Labour needs to 
think about forming partnerships with other anti-Tory parties because it has no 
chance of winning the next general election on its own. (See 9.14am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/03/corbyn-labour-fabian-society-report-saying-labour-needs-pact-with-other-parties-to-win-election-politics-live?page=with:block-586b6090e4b0c44bce1f03bc#block-586b6090e4b0c44bce1f03bc>
 * Steve Hilton, David Cameron’s former head of strategy and a leave supporter 
during the EU referendum, has accused Theresa May of adopting a closed, 
“mean-spirited” approach to Brexit. Speaking on the Word at One, he said that 
he and others in the Vote Leave campaign called for an “open Brexit”. But the 
government has taken the opposite approach, he claimed, citing as an example 
the Conservative conference proposals (since abandoned) for firms to have to 
record the number of foreigners they employ. Hilton said: 
What I worry about is that the tone that Theresa May has set so far is exactly 
the opposite of that [“open Brexit”], exactly what we don’t need; a kind of 
closed Brexit, a mean-spirited, narrow version of what leaving the EU should 
have been all about ...

What Theresa May is doing, certainly again in the tone that she and her 
ministers have struck, is to give the impression that the UK is pulling up the 
drawbridge, and instead of being open to the world, being closed to people. 
That is bad for our economy and our society.

 * Major City employers are expected to decide within weeks whether they need 
to move business out of the UK as a result of the Brexit vote, the lobby group 
for Paris has predicted as it sets it sights on luring up to 20,000 roles away 
from London. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/paris-lobby-city-london-firms-decide-leave-uk-within-weeks-brexit>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, has now called for a “complete 
clear-out” of the Foreign Office.

Leave Means Leave has welcomed Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation. This is from is 
co-chair, Richard Tice.

Sir Ivan was a remainer who consistently failed to acknowledge the benefits 
Brexit will bring to Britain. His claims that a Brexit deal would take ten 
years to secure demonstrates the pessimistic and unrealistic outlook he had for 
British independence.

It would have been completely inappropriate for him to stay in post and 
obstruct the Brexit process any further.

His successor must be someone 100 per cent committed to embracing the 
opportunities a swift, clean Brexit will bring Britain and crucially, someone 
independently minded who will stand up for what is best for Britain in the 
upcoming negotiations.
 
And here is my colleague Dan Roberts’ take on Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation. He 
says it is the latest sign that the UK is heading for a hard Brexit.

George Osborne, the former chancellor, has praised Sir Ivan Rogers.
George Osborne (@George_Osborne) 
Ivan Rogers helped me on many ECOFIN deals over the years. He is a perceptive, 
pragmatic & patriotic public servant. Thank you.

His tweet is not hostile to the government, but it is implicitly critical of 
those in his party and elsewhere who have questioned Rogers’ professionalism.
 
Here’s Jonathan Isaby, editor of the pro-Brexit BrexitCentral website 
<http://brexitcentral.com/>, on Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation.

Sir Ivan was due to leave his posting in Brussels later this year in any case; 
would those decrying his departure not have found it more disruptive for him to 
have to be replaced just a few months into the Brexit negotiations? Or are they 
simply upset at the prospect of a UK ambassador in Brussels who accepts the 
referendum result and can be relied on to support the prime minister in 
delivering a successful Brexit?
 
Dame Margaret Beckett, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>
 former foreign secretary, said Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation created a “crisis” 
for the Foreign Office.

If, as it appears, [Rogers] is lost because he gave honest advice, that is not 
a good precedent. I think it is a crisis for the prime minister and for the 
Foreign Office. It is deeply alarming.
 
My colleague Matthew d’Ancona has written his take on Sir Ivan Rogers’ 
resignation. Here is an excerpt.

As a former home secretary, May is perfectly well-acquainted with the nuances 
and complexities of the EU. But she expected and required more from the UK’s 
permanent representative than to be reminded querulously of the obstacles to 
exit. As a prime minister who owes her job to a referendum that brought down 
her predecessor, she wanted the top diplomat in Brussels to offer solutions – 
and fast.

That said, Sir Ivan has long been a favourite (and useful) whipping boy for 
senior Tories. It suited them to roll their eyes, accuse him of going native 
and blame the failure of this or that negotiation upon his lack of patriotic 
fervour. Now they won’t have Rogers to kick around.

He will be replaced quickly enough, doubtless by someone billed by No 10 as a 
“safe pair of hands” – code for “more competent”. May will weather this 
particular squall. But a troubling question will linger and loom over the 
Brexit talks long after Sir Ivan has moved on: what if he was right?

And here is his article in full.

Here is some more reaction to Sir Ivan Rogers’ departure from commentators.

From Politico Europe’s Ryan Heath
Ryan Heath (@PoliticoRyan) 
Ivan Rogers resignation doesn't feel planned or well-managed by UK government: 
it smells of a discontented moderate fleeing a sinking ship.

Jean Quatremer, the Brussels correspondent of the French paper Libération and 
a fierce critic of British Eurosceptics, seems to be enjoying the news that Sir 
Ivan Rogers has resigned.
Jean Quatremer (@quatremer) 
La Grande-Bretagne est fin prête à négocier le #Brexit 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash> d’ici 3 mois : son ambassadeur 
auprès de l’UE, Ivan Rogers, vient de démissionner :-D

Gerard Batten, Ukip’s Brexit spokesman, has welcomed Sir Ivan Rogers’ 
resignation. In a statement 
<http://www.ukip.org/goodbye_sir_ivan_welcome_nigel_farage> Batten says that 
the government should not replace him until the European Communities Act has 
been repealed. Then Theresa May should consider appointing Nigel Farage to the 
post, Batten says.

When Farage was asked about this proposal, he told the Press Association: 
“That’s very sweet of [Batten]. It would be lots of fun, but it’s never going 
to happen.”
 
Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, told the Press Association that “a lot 
more” British diplomats should follow Sir Ivan Rogers and resign.

I think it would be appropriate if a lot more people in that position, British 
ambassadors, left. The world has changed. The political establishment in this 
country and the diplomatic service just doesn’t accept the vote.

He also said Theresa May should replace Rogers with a “firm Brexiteer”.

She should welcome it with open arms and put a firm Brexiteer in the position. 
Somebody who recognises that the world has changed, somebody tough, so we can 
get on with Brexit.
