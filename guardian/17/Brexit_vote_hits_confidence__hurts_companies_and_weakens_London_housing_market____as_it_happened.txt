European markets end lower

After the Federal Reserve kept US interest rates on hold and ahead of a 
decision by the Bank of Japan, stock markets fell back after their recent 
highs. Falling oil prices and disappointing results from the likes of Royal 
Dutch Shell andLloyds Banking Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group> also hit sentiment. 
Investors were nervous ahead of the European bank stress test results due on 
late on Friday. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 29.37 points or 0.44% at 6721.06 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.43% to 10,274.93 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.59% at 4420.58 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 2.02% to 16,522.64 on worries about the country’s 
banks ahead of the stress tests 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 2.1% lower at 8479.2 
 * In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.11% to 562.84 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 72 points or 
0.4%.

On that note, it’s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll 
be back tomorrow.

Markets are in wait and see mode ahead of the Bank of Japan rate decision 
later, but oil continues to fall on renewed worries about oversupply and weak 
demand. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark has now fallen 20% since its 
June highs, indicating a bear market.

Meanwhile in the UK the FTSE 100 is down just 7 points while the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average is 74 points lower after the Federal Reserve kept US 
interest rates on hold but hinted at possible rises later in the year. Joshua 
Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:

An unsurprisingly indecisive session in Europe has seen the likes of the FTSE 
largely flatlining as traders reduced their risk overnight ahead of the week’s 
risk event from the Bank of Japan. Commodities have enjoyed a particularly 
volatile second half of this week, with crude continuing to tumble heavily on a 
global supply glut alongside evidence that fund managers are heavily shorting 
crude prices.

Tonight’s Bank of Japan meeting has been the focal point of the week despite 
yesterday’s Fed announcement. One of the main reasons for the post-referendum 
rally has been the promise of easing from the likes of the ECB, Bank of England 
and Bank of Japan. With the overnight index swap markets rating the chance of a 
Bank of England rate cut at 100% next week, it seems like a matter of time 
until we see some sort of action. However, given that we have seen the 
post-referendum rally stall after weeks of inaction in Europe, there is a 
feeling that the FTSE is waiting for some form of stimulus to spark another leg 
higher.

Larry Elliott

The IMF has been criticised for its handling of the eurozone crisis...by the 
IMF. Larry Elliott reports:

The IMF’s handling of the financial crisis in the eurozone has been criticised 
by the organisation’s own independent watchdog in a report that says the fund 
failed to spot the scale of the problem, was guilty of over-optimistic 
forecasts and left the impression that it was treatingEurope 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/europe-news> differently.

While accepting that sorting out the problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal 
“posed extraordinary challenges”, the IMF’sIndependent Evaluation Office 
<http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2015/02/guide-imfs-independent-evaluation-office/>
 (IEO) said the fund had missed the buildup of banking system risks in some 
countries and shared the widely held “Europe is different” mindset.

The report looked into how the IMF handled the eurozone crisis, which began 
with theMay 2010 bailout of Greece 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2010/may/05/greece-debt-crisis-timeline>
, but subsequently spread to Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus.

It found that the “IMF’s pre-crisis surveillance identified the right issues 
but did not foresee the magnitude of the risks that would later become 
paramount”.

Henry McDonald

The vast majority of Irish small to medium enterprises believe Brexit is a 
threat to their business, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin:

A survey released today by the British-Irish Chamber of Commence found that 
out of 400 Irish SMEs 262 of them see Brexit as a threat with far fewer 
envisaging the post-EU future as an opportunity

The research also polled 88 British SMEs who do major business in Ireland. 
John McGrane, the Director General of the Chamber stressed that the Irish SME 
sector, which is the largest part of the Republic’s economy, still see the UK 
as key to their business despite Britain leaving the EU. McGrane said the 
uncertainty within Irish SME’s over what to do next after the Brexit vote 
required “joined up support” from both the Irish and British government and 
their relevant agencies.

He added: “Business wants collaborative thinking and the Chamber stands ready 
to support its members, and Government, to continue to protect and grow the 
deep trade linkages between the UK and Ireland. We’re ready to join up with 
likeminded agencies and organisations to ensure all businesses get the most 
joined-up supports they need to confront the uncertainties, and opportunities, 
ahead.”

The survey was conducted over the weeks following the EU referendum.

Back with Brexit, and ratings agency S&P Global says the decision to leave the 
European Union should have little impact on the UK’s project finance 
initiative. It said:

We analyse the effect of Brexit on our U.K. portfolio of over 50 rated 
transactions, in particular the potential repercussions of a higher 
inflationary environment, weaker economic growth, and the change in the credit 
quality of revenues and financial counterparties. While we believe that the 
risks of adverse economic developments in the U.K. have increased, we expect 
U.K. private finance initiative (PFI) projects will maintain their credit 
strength.

Belgian GDP grows by better than expected 0.5%

Ahead of eurozone GDP figures on Friday, new data from Belgium has shown the 
country’s economy growing by 0.5% quarter on quarter, despite terrorist attacks 
and strikes. That compares to 0.2% growth in the first quarter, and analyst 
expectations of a 0.3% increase. Year on year, the economy grew by 1.4%. 
Economist Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank said:

According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs the negative impact of the March 
22 terrorist attacks in Brussels on hotels, catering and retail trade amounted 
to about €180m for the first half of this year. This probably shaved off around 
0.1 percentage points from second quarter GDP growth. On top of that, the 
second quarter saw a rather tense social climate, with several strikes, most 
notably in public transport. This also weighed on growth.

While the GDP components have not been published yet, the improvement in 
sentiment in industry seems to point to a positive contribution from investment 
and export. Residential construction most likely also contributed positively. 
With the situation on the labour market continuing to improve, consumption has 
probably also expanded, though some negative impact of the terrorist attacks 
seems likely.

All in all today’s figure seems hopeful, as it confirms that the Belgian 
economy still has some underlying momentum, putting in a strong performance 
despite the terrorist attacks and the strikes. Certainly, with Brexit and 
potentially a somewhat tighter fiscal policy, there are new headwinds that 
might hamper growth in the second half, but we believe that even then a 
quarterly growth pace of around 0.2% to 0.3% should be feasible. We will await 
further data confirmation in the coming weeks, but on the back of today’s 
figures we are likely to have to revise our estimate for Belgian GDP growth 
upwards to 1.4% (from 1.2%).

Earlier, US jobless claims rose by more than expected last week, according to 
the Labor Department.

The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits grew by 14,000 to 
266,000, compared to expectations of an increase to 260,000. The previous 
week’s level was revised down by 1,000 to 252,000.

Weekly claims have been below 300,000, which is seen as a sign of a healthy 
labour market, for 73 consecutive weeks.

Over in Paris, an EDF board member has resigned shortly before the energy 
company announce whether it will push on with plans to build a new nuclear 
plant at Britain’s Hinkley Point.

Gerard Magnin said the project was risky, and would undermine France’s efforts 
to develop renewable energy technology.

Magnin’s resignation may be a sign that EDF will stick with Hinkley. An 
announcement is expected later today.

After the Federal Reserve kept US interest rates on hold and ahead of a 
decision by the Bank of Japan, stock markets fell back after their recent 
highs. Falling oil prices and disappointing results from the likes of Royal 
Dutch Shell andLloyds Banking Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group> also hit sentiment. 
Investors were nervous ahead of the European bank stress test results due on 
late on Friday. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished down 29.37 points or 0.44% at 6721.06 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.43% to 10,274.93 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.59% at 4420.58 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 2.02% to 16,522.64 on worries about the country’s 
banks ahead of the stress tests 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 2.1% lower at 8479.2 
 * In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.11% to 562.84 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 72 points or 
0.4%.

On that note, it’s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll 
be back tomorrow.
 
Markets are in wait and see mode ahead of the Bank of Japan rate decision 
later, but oil continues to fall on renewed worries about oversupply and weak 
demand. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark has now fallen 20% since its 
June highs, indicating a bear market.

Meanwhile in the UK the FTSE 100 is down just 7 points while the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average is 74 points lower after the Federal Reserve kept US 
interest rates on hold but hinted at possible rises later in the year. Joshua 
Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:

An unsurprisingly indecisive session in Europe has seen the likes of the FTSE 
largely flatlining as traders reduced their risk overnight ahead of the week’s 
risk event from the Bank of Japan. Commodities have enjoyed a particularly 
volatile second half of this week, with crude continuing to tumble heavily on a 
global supply glut alongside evidence that fund managers are heavily shorting 
crude prices.

Tonight’s Bank of Japan meeting has been the focal point of the week despite 
yesterday’s Fed announcement. One of the main reasons for the post-referendum 
rally has been the promise of easing from the likes of the ECB, Bank of England 
and Bank of Japan. With the overnight index swap markets rating the chance of a 
Bank of England rate cut at 100% next week, it seems like a matter of time 
until we see some sort of action. However, given that we have seen the 
post-referendum rally stall after weeks of inaction in Europe, there is a 
feeling that the FTSE is waiting for some form of stimulus to spark another leg 
higher.
 
The IMF has been criticised for its handling of the eurozone crisis...by the 
IMF. Larry Elliott reports:

The IMF’s handling of the financial crisis in the eurozone has been criticised 
by the organisation’s own independent watchdog in a report that says the fund 
failed to spot the scale of the problem, was guilty of over-optimistic 
forecasts and left the impression that it was treatingEurope 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/europe-news> differently.

While accepting that sorting out the problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal 
“posed extraordinary challenges”, the IMF’sIndependent Evaluation Office 
<http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2015/02/guide-imfs-independent-evaluation-office/>
 (IEO) said the fund had missed the buildup of banking system risks in some 
countries and shared the widely held “Europe is different” mindset.

The report looked into how the IMF handled the eurozone crisis, which began 
with theMay 2010 bailout of Greece 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2010/may/05/greece-debt-crisis-timeline>
, but subsequently spread to Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus.

It found that the “IMF’s pre-crisis surveillance identified the right issues 
but did not foresee the magnitude of the risks that would later become 
paramount”.

threat to their business, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin:

A survey released today by the British-Irish Chamber of Commence found that 
out of 400 Irish SMEs 262 of them see Brexit as a threat with far fewer 
envisaging the post-EU future as an opportunity

The research also polled 88 British SMEs who do major business in Ireland. 
John McGrane, the Director General of the Chamber stressed that the Irish SME 
sector, which is the largest part of the Republic’s economy, still see the UK 
as key to their business despite Britain leaving the EU. McGrane said the 
uncertainty within Irish SME’s over what to do next after the Brexit vote 
required “joined up support” from both the Irish and British government and 
their relevant agencies.

He added: “Business wants collaborative thinking and the Chamber stands ready 
to support its members, and Government, to continue to protect and grow the 
deep trade linkages between the UK and Ireland. We’re ready to join up with 
likeminded agencies and organisations to ensure all businesses get the most 
joined-up supports they need to confront the uncertainties, and opportunities, 
ahead.”

The survey was conducted over the weeks following the EU referendum. 
 
The expectation of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England continues to 
put pressure on sterling.

The pound has fallen 1% against the euro, hitting a two week low of 84.48p a 
euro. Against the dollar it is currently down 0.58% at $1.3142.
 
Back with Brexit, and ratings agency S&P Global says the decision to leave the 
European Union should have little impact on the UK’s project finance 
initiative. It said:

We analyse the effect of Brexit on our U.K. portfolio of over 50 rated 
transactions, in particular the potential repercussions of a higher 
inflationary environment, weaker economic growth, and the change in the credit 
quality of revenues and financial counterparties. While we believe that the 
risks of adverse economic developments in the U.K. have increased, we expect 
U.K. private finance initiative (PFI) projects will maintain their credit 
strength.
 
A day after the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold but suggested 
there could be a possible hike later this year, US stock markets have slipped 
lower in early trading.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 44 points or 0.22%, while the S&P 500 
has slipped 0.29% and Nasdaq 0.14%.
 
Ahead of eurozone GDP figures on Friday, new data from Belgium has shown the 
country’s economy growing by 0.5% quarter on quarter, despite terrorist attacks 
and strikes. That compares to 0.2% growth in the first quarter, and analyst 
expectations of a 0.3% increase. Year on year, the economy grew by 1.4%. 
Economist Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank said:

According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs the negative impact of the March 
22 terrorist attacks in Brussels on hotels, catering and retail trade amounted 
to about €180m for the first half of this year. This probably shaved off around 
0.1 percentage points from second quarter GDP growth. On top of that, the 
second quarter saw a rather tense social climate, with several strikes, most 
notably in public transport. This also weighed on growth.

While the GDP components have not been published yet, the improvement in 
sentiment in industry seems to point to a positive contribution from investment 
and export. Residential construction most likely also contributed positively. 
With the situation on the labour market continuing to improve, consumption has 
probably also expanded, though some negative impact of the terrorist attacks 
seems likely.

All in all today’s figure seems hopeful, as it confirms that the Belgian 
economy still has some underlying momentum, putting in a strong performance 
despite the terrorist attacks and the strikes. Certainly, with Brexit and 
potentially a somewhat tighter fiscal policy, there are new headwinds that 
might hamper growth in the second half, but we believe that even then a 
quarterly growth pace of around 0.2% to 0.3% should be feasible. We will await 
further data confirmation in the coming weeks, but on the back of today’s 
figures we are likely to have to revise our estimate for Belgian GDP growth 
upwards to 1.4% (from 1.2%).
 
Earlier, US jobless claims rose by more than expected last week, according to 
the Labor Department.

The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits grew by 14,000 to 
266,000, compared to expectations of an increase to 260,000. The previous 
week’s level was revised down by 1,000 to 252,000.

Weekly claims have been below 300,000, which is seen as a sign of a healthy 
labour market, for 73 consecutive weeks.

Over in Paris, an EDF board member has resigned shortly before the energy 
company announce whether it will push on with plans to build a new nuclear 
plant at Britain’s Hinkley Point.

Gerard Magnin said the project was risky, and would undermine France’s efforts 
to develop renewable energy technology.

Magnin’s resignation may be a sign that EDF will stick with Hinkley. An 
announcement is expected later today.
