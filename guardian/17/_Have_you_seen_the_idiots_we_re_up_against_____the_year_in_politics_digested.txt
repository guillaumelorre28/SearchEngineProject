January – April

George Osborne So how are the EU negotiations going, Dave?

David Cameron Absolutely tip-top. The first part of the negotiations have been 
negotiated. There will be some further negotiations in February that may or may 
not be negotiated and, if they aren’t, the negotiations will be concluded at 
some unspecified later date. But I can promise you that whether I manage to 
renegotiate the one tricky bit of my negotiations or not, the negotiations will 
have been successful.

Osborne Are you sure we’re going to win this referendum?

Cameron Have you seen the idiots we’re up against? Michael Gove 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove>, Chris Grayling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/chrisgrayling>, Nigel Farage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage>, IDS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/iain-duncan-smith> ... We can’t fail.

Osborne What about Boris?

Cameron He’s 100% behind me.

Boris Johnson Actually, I’m having trouble with my conscience.

Cameron Don’t be silly. You haven’t got one.

Johnson Thing is, Dave, I was playing tennis over the weekend and Govey 
pointed out I’d never become prime minister if I backed remain as then I’d 
always be behind Osbo in the pecking order. But if I lead the leave campaign to 
a close second, then I’d be first in line when you step down in 2019. You are 
still going in 2019, aren’t you?

Cameron So having spent the last six months telling everyone Britain would be 
better off staying in the EU, you’re now saying you’ve changed your mind.

Johnson That’s being a little harsh. But, basically, yes.

Ken Livingstone Hitler.

Jeremy Corbyn The Labour party is completely clear about the EU. We think it’s 
all a bit of a mess.

The Labour party No, we don’t. We’re fully behind it. It’s just you that has 
got a problem with it.

Corbyn OK, OK. Maybe the EU isn’t all that bad. Let’s just say that I’m about 
70/30 in favour of staying in.

Cameron Well, that’s not a great help. I’m relying on you to get the Labour 
remain vote out and you’re basically telling them not to bother.

Corbyn I might be able to stretch to 69/31 at a push ...

Cameron Don’t put yourself out. And while you’re about it, do up your tie, 
polish your shoes and buy yourself a decent suit.

Osborne Don’t worry, Dave. I’ve got our EU strategy sorted. We’re going to go 
with Project Fear. We’ll just tell everyone they will end up broke and die in 
agony if we leave the EU. That should do it.

Cameron You’re a genius. Where do we start?

Osborne With my budget. It turns out I’ve been getting my sums wrong for the 
past six years and we’re all a lot worse off than we thought we were going to 
be.

Cameron So we’re screwed if we stay in the EU ...

Osborne And even more screwed if we leave the EU.

Cameron That’s not necessarily going to be the easiest sell.

Osborne Have you got a better plan?

Cameron No.

Osborne Well, then. And, while I’ve got you, how are you going to explain your 
appearance in thePanama Papers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers>?

Cameron Oh, not you, too. I’ve had the Labour party going on about that as 
well. Look, it was just a bit of light, recreational, weekend tax avoidance. It 
was no biggy.

Livingstone Hitler.

Johnson Bonjour, Dartford. We need to escape the demented bureaucrats forcing 
us to under pouvoir notres vacuum cleaneurs! Are there downsides to leaving the 
EU? Absolument non. It is aussi clear as jour. The Frogs and the Krauts will 
still be gagging for all our clobber and we can have our gateau and eat it.

48% If it was as clear as all that, why did it take you so long to make up 
your mind which side of the referendum campaign you were on?

Johnson Don’t be such a gloomadon popper 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/03/11/boris-johnson-eu-vote-leave_n_9437394.html>
. Just look at this bus. £350m. That’s what we give to the EU every week and 
that’s what we’re going to give to the NHS instead.

Treasury select committee That’s just not true, is it, Boris. You haven’t 
taken into account the rebates we get or the ongoing subsidies we will have to 
make to farmers and the regions.

Johnson Well, it’s near enough true.

Treasury select committee As in a complete lie. And while you’re here, perhaps 
you could explain what kind of deal you want Britain to negotiate with the EU. 
Swedish, Canadian or Norwegian? One day you say one thing, the next another. 
You’re entirely inconsistent.

Johnson That’s not fair. I’m entirely consistent in my inconsistency. We’re 
going to take back control.

Gove Goveland is a land of freedom, a land of hope and glory. A land other 
nations shall admire from afar. A land that will be just about perfect because 
we can choose which foreigners we want and which ones we don’t. A land a bit 
like Australia, only not quite so hot. Or large. Or so far away. A land a bit 
like Switzerland, only not quite so cold. Or mountainous. Or in the middle of 
Europe. A land unlike any other land. A vote to leave is not just a vote to 
liberate a country; it is a vote to liberate the entire world. Rise up! You 
have nothing to lose but your MEP! My name is Goveymandias, king of kings. Look 
on my works, ye mighty, and despair.

Nigel Farage The pints are on me. The country is being overrun with immigrants.

Cameron We’re struggling to get our message across. I need some help, Theresa.

Theresa May I’m sorry, I’ve got an ingrowing toenail.

Cameron You’ve got to do better than that.

May How about I say the EU isn’t quite the worst thing in the world? Will that 
do?

Cameron Looks like it will have to.

May – June

Zac Goldsmith Sadiq is almost certainly a member of Isis.

Sadiq Khan I know I once said I was a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, but I’m not 
really. I’m actually a Labour moderate. I love London, me. Did I ever mention 
the fact that my dad was a bus driver?

London You did, but you can be our mayor as long as you stop going on and on 
about it.

Corbyn Who would have believed it? A Labour candidate just got elected.

Sky Welcome to the first TV referendum debate in which David Cameron and 
Michael Gove won’t actually debate anything as they are appearing on different 
nights because the prime minister is too much of a pussy. Prime minister, I put 
it to you that you’ve basically failed at everything.

Cameron Harsh but true.

Sky If you lose, what will you do.

Cameron I will respect the mandate and remain prime minister to implement the 
will of the people.

Sky Mr Gove. All the experts say that the leave campaign has basically just 
made facts up as they go along and that everything you say is just a total lie.

Gove Experts! Who needs experts? Experts always get everything wrong. Doctors 
and scientists are all idiots.

52 per cent We agree with Mikey. We’re sick and tired of experts. And even if 
they’re right, we still don’t care because we don’t want to be bossed around by 
Westminster any more.

Farage Quite right. The country has been run by posh boys like me, Mikey and 
Boris for far too long. I say let’s take back control and stop all foreigners 
coming into the country.

Opinion polls We can confirm that our exit polls suggest Britain has narrowly 
voted to remain in the EU.

Farage Oh bollocks. But who cares, because losing is just the same as winning 
for the leave campaign as we’ll have to have another referendum sooner rather 
than later.

BBC Actually, it’s looking like Vote Leave has won.

Farage Scrub the idea of a second referendum just because the vote was tight. 
Britain has voted by the enormous margin of 52-48% to leave and we are now 
officially independent. Now I’m off to get even more pissed.

Cameron It is my solemn duty to tell you that I will be stepping down as prime 
minister.

Everyone But you said you were going to remain as PM.

Cameron So what? I’ve change my mind. I just can’t be arsed after all.

Gove Bloody hell, Boris, we’ve actually gone and won. What do we do now?

Johnson Don’t ask me. I only agreed to back Vote Leave on the condition we 
weren’t going to win.

Everyone What are you going to do next?

Gove As someone who has just come down off a bad acid trip only to discover I 
have murdered my best friend, I am going to take the weekend off to recover.

Johnson And I’m off to play a game of cricket. I’ll speak to you all next week.

Everyone Thanks for nothing, guys.

Johnson I suppose this means I’d better stand to be the next prime minister. 
You will support me, Govey, won’t you?

Gove Absolutely. Wild horses couldn’t stop me.

May I knew appearing totally luke-warm about the EU was a good move. So, I’m 
also going to stand to be prime minister.

Liam Fox I also want to be prime minister.

Everyone Wasn’t he the idiot who had to resign as a minister after being 
caught taking his friend away with him on government business?

Stephen Crabb I also want to be PM.

Everyone Wasn’t he the sexter?

Andrea Leadsom I also want to be prime minister.

Everyone Who the hell are you?

Leadsom I’m a mother with a made-up CV. And I’m a mother.

Jacob Rees-Mogg I think Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> is just the person the country 
needs as its leader.

Gove Actually, I’ve change my mind, Boris. I want to be PM as well.

Johnson You complete and utter bastard. Now I’m going to have to stand down. 
Not only have you made me take Britain out of the EU but worse still you’ve 
stopped me from becoming PM.

Rees-Mogg I think Michael Gove is just the person the country needs as its 
leader.

Tories Crabb and Fox are nobodies. Gove can’t be trusted not to stab himself 
in the back. So that leaves the hopeless Leadsom versus the barely competent 
Theresa.

Rees-Mogg I think Andrea Leadsom is just the person the country needs as its 
leader.

Leadsom As a mother with a fictitious CV I have decided that as a mother I’m 
not up to the job of running the country.

May I win! Help me someone. What do I do next?

May’s advisers Put all your opponents in the big jobs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/boris-johnson-forced-to-share-mansion-with-liam-fox-and-david-davis>
. Make Boris foreign secretary, David Davis minister for Brexit and give Fox 
international trade. Either way you win. If they mess things up, as they almost 
certainly will, then they’ll get the blame. And if they by some minute chance 
make a success of it, then you’ll get the credit.

Britain Thanks for nothing.

Farage I’m resigning as leader of Ukip 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/nigel-farage-resigns-as-ukip-leader>
.

Britain Thank God for small mercies.

Farage I was only kidding!

July – December

Labour I suppose we should get a new leader as well.

Corbyn I have the backing of 300,000 party members.

Labour But the rest of the country thinks you’re unelectable.

Corbyn What’s that got to do with anything?

Labour Some of us quite like the thought of winning a general election.

Corbyn That’s such old-fashioned politics.

Labour front bench We’re all resigning.

Corbyn See if I care.

Owen Smith Well, if no one else will, then I’m going to stand against you.

Corbyn Who are you? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/21/jeremy-corbyn-labour-owen-smith-leader>

Smith The futile gesture.

Corbyn I win again.

Labour Well, that’s the 2020 election lost.

Livingstone Hitler.

May I’m taking this Brexit thing very seriously. The people have spoken.

Everyone What does Brexit mean?

May Brexit means Brexit.

Everyone Can you help us out a little more?

May I’m not going to give a running commentary on this. I’ve told you that 
Brexit means Brexitand I can’t be any clearer than that 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/so-brexit-means-brexit-means-brexit-is-that-it>
.

Everyone Oh God. She’s just as clueless as everyone else.

Labour Let’s start with something a bit easier to help you out. How about 
telling us a bit of the plan? Brexit soft or hard?

May Brexit means Brexit. I will trigger article 50 before the end of March 
next year and after that it’s fingers crossed.

The judiciary Actually, we think parliament ought to be involved in the 
process of triggering article 50.

May The judges are the enemies of the people. We didn’t take back control from 
the unelected Brussels bureaucrats only to give the British parliament a say in 
the country’s future.

Philip Hammond I’ve been looking at the sums. We’re really going to be in the 
shit if we leave the single market and the customs union.

May Since when did I ask for your opinion? Here’s the deal. I am now going for 
a red, white and blue Brexit.

Everyone We’re becoming French?

May I have a plan, which is my plan, which is to negotiate for the best deal 
for Britain, and the best deal for Britain will just happen to be the one I end 
up having negotiated.

Hammond No one will believe that.

May I know. Tell me some good news.

Hammond Donald Trump has just been elected president of the US.

May Aaagh.

Hammond And he wants Nigel Farage to be the UK ambassador in Washington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/22/nigel-farage-uk-ambassador-us-donald-trump>
.

May Aaaaaaagh. The next thing you’ll be telling me is that Boris has managed 
to insult the Saudis.

Johnson As it happens …

Livingstone Hitler.
