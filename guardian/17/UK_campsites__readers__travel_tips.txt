Cleadale, Isle of Eigg, the Hebrides 


If you enjoy your camping raw, earthy and inspiring, Cleadale is worth making 
the trek to. The soft pastures aren’t smooth, but you know you are surrounded 
by mother nature at her most inspiring here. The best grassy banks for tents 
look seaward to the Isle of Rum and you can eat your pasta as the sun sets 
while eagles and buzzards soar from cliff tops. JRR Tolkien penned some 
chapters of The Lord of the Rings when staying here, and you might want to 
write your own book or poem too.

This is a lovely campsite and vineyard near the picturesque village of 
Winkleigh, between Exmoor and Dartmoor. The owners are winemakers who know 
everything about wine and English sparkling wine, which of course you can also 
try. There are also some delightful little pigs and chickens – it’s perfect for 
family camping.

Lundy Island campsite

With the only distractions being the clear waters and dazzling night sky, 
Lundy, in the Bristol Channel, is our favourite camping spot in the UK. This is 
natural camping at its very best, and while it doesn’t seem like the perfect 
spot for camping at first sight, a few nights can be truly magical. You need to 
make sure you’re prepared for the possibility of some gusty Atlantic winds, but 
with the right weather this peaceful, remote location feels a million miles 
from modern life.

Staying in a tipi here was great; we took an air bed and bedding, and lit the 
fire before settling down for the night. It may not be glamping, but feeling 
that cosy with the gentle breeze through the trees and the noise of the river 
was luxurious. We ditched the car and went canoeing from the campsite the next 
day, along the river and its beautiful scenery into the magical place called 
Hay-on-Wye, aka the Town of Books.

One of my favourite weekends was a camping trip along the Jurassic coastline 
from Weymouth to Swanage. We walked about 18 miles on the first day, 
accompanied by breathtaking cliff views, and made camp at Steeple Leaze Farm, 
where we found ourselves being the only campers on a vast field of green. The 
owners leave you to yourself, but are very friendly if you have any questions. 
All you need to do is show up the next morning and pay a small pitching fee.

Sustainability Centre, Hampshire


Step off the South Downs Way and wheel your bike or weary legs into the quiet 
campsite at the Sustainability Centre. This is as close to wild camping as 
you’ll get without missing out on a refreshing morning wash. Light a campfire, 
sit under the stars and listen out for owls. Visitor numbers are kept low and 
you are encouraged to engage with and respect the natural habitat. Solar 
showers, compost toilets and recycling are part of the experience.

This is one of our favourite family-focused campsites in the UK. As you drive 
around the site for the first time the sea view hits you smack in the face and 
the whole family grins. It has an outdoor swimming pool, split into a kids 
shallow pool and a deep pool, but they also allow periods in the main pool for 
adults only. The bar/clubhouse has plenty of seating inside and out and has a 
stage/dancefloor for nightly entertainment. The area is great for photographers 
and steam train lovers and we like to take the car or foot ferry to Dartmouth 
or hire a motorboat and drive up the river.

We enjoy looking at the curious fluffy fellas (the local sheep) that often 
stroll along the clifftops next to the tents at North Hill Farm, although they 
always seem more interested in the burnt sausages coming off the barbecues in 
summer than the dramatic views of Penmaen and crumbling Pennard Castle across 
the valley!
