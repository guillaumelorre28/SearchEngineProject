Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks>, has taken part in an online 
interview session in which he faced questions from the public on subjects 
ranging from his relationship with Russia to whether he was, in fact, still 
alive.

Assange, who sought political asylum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/12/questioning-of-julian-assange-by-swedish-authorities-postponed>
 at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and who has been living there since 2012, 
participated in the Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) event on Tuesday.

He has faced criticism for what critics have alleged was interference in the 
US election. WikiLeaks published batches of information about the Democratic 
nominee,Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, 
which some believe cost her the US presidential election.

In the AMA, some questions about links to Russia, WikiLeaks’s ethics and 
relationship withFox News <https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news> were 
either ignored or given one-word answers.

Velocity_Rob summed up the frustration expressed by some users. “For someone 
who claims they’re all about transparency and openness, your answers here 
really don’t live up to those lofty ideals. Terse one-word answers, ignoring 
really pertinent questions, what exactly is the point of this AMA?


LameMeme did receive an answer to the question: “Please address the 
allegations thatWikiLeaks <https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks> has a 
friendly relationship with Russia and cannot be considered objective with their 
leaks and their agenda. The timeline that makes these allegations seem 
plausible:


 * 10/26/10 - WikiLeaks ready to drop a bombshell on Russia 
 * 11/01/10 - Russia’s FSB to WikiLeaks: We Can Destroy You 
 * 1/20/11 - Julian Assange gets Russian visa 
 * 1/25/12 - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s TV show to be aired on Russian 
channel 
 * 4/6/16 - WikiLeaks: US Gov’t Behind Panama Leaks to Attack Putin 
 * 8/8/16 -

“Since you are so adamant that Russia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> was not involved in the recent leaks 
that played a major role in the US presidential election, it would be helpful 
if you can make a compelling case for why Americans should trust you over their 
own intelligence agencies whose reason for existence is to defend the US 
against foreign threats and who are saying the opposite about Russian 
involvement.”

Assange gave a substantial reply which included: “WikiLeaks has published more 
than 10m million documents over 10 years. We have a 100% accuracy rate on 
authenticating our publications … WikiLeaks has published more than 800,000 
documents that relate to Russia or Vladimir Putin. Most of those are critical.”

Gddboygb, another participant, also received a substantial reply for the 
query: “People frequently group you together withEdward Snowden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/17/edward-snowden-nsa-files-whistleblower>
 because you’ve both released classified American documents. But your 
motivations and [philosophies] couldn’t be more different. Snowden claims to 
fight for privacy. He’s called privacy the bedrock of freedom, that one cannot 
be free without privacy.

“You have called privacy obsolete and unsustainable. You’ve said that privacy 
has no inherent value. You appear to believe privacy and freedom are 
incompatible, that you cannot be free if others can keep secrets from you. 
You’ve published the credit card numbers, social security numbers, medical 
information, and sexual preferences of individuals of zero public interest. Two 
of your most recent publications are the personal Gmail inboxes of civilians, 
exactly the sort of thing Snowden has tried to protect. Can you convince me 
that you’re right and Snowden’s wrong?”

Assange replied in part: “Edward has been a very important voice in talking 
about the importance of different aspects of them, but he has had no control. 
The result is that more than 97% of the Snowden documents have been censored. 
Enormously important material censored and while there have been some good 
journalists working on them, and I think Glenn Greenwald is one of the best 
journalists publishing in the United States, you have to have hundreds of 
people and engineers working on material like this to understand what is going 
on.”

Assange closed the session by addressing rumours that he was no longer alive 
or had been kidnapped. “I’m alive, and free from duress,” he said. The 
45-year-old read from the online currency bitcoin blockchain, a constantly 
updated listing of transactions, to prove that the video had not been recorded 
at an earlier time.

• This article was amended on 16 January 2017. An earlier version said 
LameMeme and Gddboygb did not receive replies to their questions. That was 
incorrect, and the replies from Assange have been added.
