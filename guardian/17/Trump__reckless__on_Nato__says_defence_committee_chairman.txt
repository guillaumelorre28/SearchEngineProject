The chairman of a Commons committee has described Donald Trump’s warning that 
the US might abandonNato <https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato> as “radical 
and reckless”, saying Europe would be vulnerable without American military 
protection.

Julian Lewis, who chairs the defence select committee, expressed the hope that 
the president-elect did not mean what he has said and that his rhetoric was 
just a negotiating ploy to force European countries to increase defence 
spending.

In a lecture at Westminster on Monday evening, the Conservative MP said: “It 
is as true today as it was when Nato was founded in 1949 that the only reliable 
deterrent to conventional war on the continent is the message, broadcast loud 
and clear, that an attack on any Nato state means war with America right from 
the outset.”


Lewis was speaking after Trump created alarm in European capitals by 
describing Nato as obsolete in an interview published by the Times on Monday. 
Last summer Trump also said he would not feel bound by Nato’s collective 
doctrinein which an attack on any one of the 28 member countries would be 
regarded as an attack on all

.

Responding, Lewis said: “And why is Mr Trump considering such a radical and 
reckless move? It is because the European Nato states – especially those which 
call most stridently for an EU defence identity – are investing nowhere near as 
much in their own armed forces, in GDP percentage terms, as either our 
principal ally in Washington DC or our principal adversary in Moscow.”
 Full text of Julian Lewis’s speech 
The MP, who was speaking in a personal capacity, and not in his role as the 
committee chairman, said that European countries without the US could deter 
nuclear blackmail from Russia, because both the UK and France had nuclear 
weapons, but not an attack by Russian conventional forces.

“It is no answer to assert that Europe will need to mount its own defence if 
Donald Trump’s America turns its back on Nato. If America turns away, Europe 
will have little chance of deterring anything other than a nuclear threat from 
Russia,” Lewis said.


Trump’s intentions towards Nato and Russia are hard to gauge, given the 
ambiguity and contradictions in his positions. In contrast with the 
president-elect’s hints of a rapprochement with Russia, his pick as next 
defence secretary, General James “Mad Dog” Mattis, has long been a vocal critic 
of Russia and a firm supporter of Nato.

In the same interview in which he called Nato obsolete, Trump described 
theorganisation as important and called on members to increased their defence 
budgets.

Lewis is as much in the dark about Trump’s intentions as just about everyone 
else but he hopes that Trump is bluffing. “The incoming US president prides 
himself on being a shrewd negotiator and also the political heir to Ronald 
Reagan. Those of us who remember President Reagan with admiration and respect 
need no reminding of his commitment to the north Atlantic alliance and his 
appreciation of the central role of Nato in preventing the third world war.”

Given Lewis’s remarks, it seems highly probable the defence committee will 
hold an inquiry into the US role in Europe.

The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said Trump’s criticism 
of Nato had caused great concern. “I’ve spoken today not only with EU foreign 
ministers but Nato foreign ministers as well and can report that the signals 
are that there’s been no easing of tensions,” he said.

Merkel to Trump: Europe’s fate is ‘in its own hands’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/16/merkel-to-trump-europes-fate-is-in-its-own-hands-video>
In response to the US president-elect’s comments on Nato and the strength of 
the EU, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said: “We Europeans have our fate 
in our own hands.”

But Moscow welcomed Trump’s vision of an obsolete Nato. “Since Nato is 
tailored toward confrontation, all its structures are dedicated to the ideals 
of confrontation, you can’t really call it a modern organisation meeting the 
ideas of stability, steady growth and security,” said Dmitry Peskov, spokesman 
for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.

Lewis also dismissed the idea of David Cameron becoming Nato secretary 
general, arguing that he was unsuitable for the role. At the end of last year, 
there was media speculation Cameron might be a candidate to replace Jens 
Stoltenberg when he stands down next year or the year after.


“David Cameron is a man of charm and ability. He deserves to find a role 
commensurate with his talents and I am sure that he will,” said Lewis, who 
often found himself at odds with the former prime minister, including when he 
opposed UK intervention in Libya.

“But those talents do not include wisely judging strategic issues, whether 
when toppling Arab dictators in place like Libya, increasing military 
commitments whilst cutting the armed forces, predicting a third world war in 
consequence of Brexit, or dangerously delaying the renewal of Trident for the 
sake of coalition politics – as he did.”
