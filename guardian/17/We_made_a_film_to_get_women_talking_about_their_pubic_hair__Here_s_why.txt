Pubic hair – or a lack thereof – became a talking point this week after 
several national media outlets, including The Daily Mail and The Mirror, 
published a video we made for our student TV station. In it, we asked female 
students at Bristol University how they groom their lady gardens – and the 
responses have kick-started a debate that is long overdue.

Some of those commenting below the Daily Mail’s article seem confused as to 
why such a question should be so newsworthy. One commenter below the article 
said: “Young feminists seem to make everything political. As men and women we 
all have our preferences.” Another (predictably) called us “snowflakes

”.

But we actually do feel that this is an important debate. The most personal 
aspects of our lives are sometimes the most political, precisely because the 
reasoning behind our choices is never discussed openly.

The idea for the video came about when a friend was complaining about the 
expense and pain of waxing, lamenting that shaving was no better an option 
because of the itchiness and ingrown hairs. It got us wondering why we put 
ourselves through this – a question often put to us by our mums, who tell us 
that the extensive hair removal so commonplace today was never such a big thing 
30 years ago.

We wanted to know whether other women also question the societal influences 
behind their habits, and indeed what their habits were in the first place. 
While filming, we were surprised at the number of women willing to talk; we 
actually had to cut out about half of our interviewees.

Pubic hair grooming linked to sexually transmitted infections

The overwhelming response from our interviewees was that they tend to remove 
all (a Hollywood) or most of their hair (a Brazilian). For many, this was down 
to personal preference. Simplicity, comfort and cleanliness were the most 
common explanations, althoughrecent research 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/13/pubic-hair-grooming-sexually-transmitted-infections-study>
 has actually suggested that hair removal could possibly lead to higher risk of 
infection.

Others, however, questioned why such a preference had become so normal in 
recent years. The porn industry was referred to frequently in this respect, 
because the removal of women’s hair in graphic videos was initially a method to 
allow for more visibility on screen. This ideal has perhaps changed the 
expectations of male viewers.

If a teenage boy’s introduction to sex is through watching pornographic 
videos, in which women have generally had a Hollywood wax, then it is 
unsurprising that they might go on to prefer less pubic hair in their real-life 
sexual encounters. There is, of course, no malice in this expectation. It is 
simply a manifestation of societal influences – which aren’t often (if ever) 
addressed inschool sex education classes

We were also interested to find out whether the opinions of current or 
potential sexual partners influenced young women’s preferences. A couple of 
students admitted that it did, or that if it didn’t now, it certainly used to 
when they were younger. Others saw this as a political issue, fiercely arguing 
that a partner should have no say in the way they choose to groom down there; 
their bush, their prerogative.

Whatever the reasons behind our gardening habits, and whether we choose 
shrubbery, a neat lawn or no garden at all, the main thing is that we feel free 
to talk about it.
