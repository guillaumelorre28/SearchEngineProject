Your editorial (26 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/25/the-guardian-view-on-democracy-an-uncertain-year>
) analyses the history of democracy as both a goal and structure for 
government. In reference to the origin in Greece and participation in the 
Scottish independence referendum debate, the issue of size is not addressed. 
The larger the population, the greater the centralisation of decision-making 
and control of service-provision, the longer the hierarchy and the less the 
belief of the population or service-users that their opinion matters one jot. 
This applies to non-governmental organisations as well.

I lived in Scotland for 15 years before moving back to Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/yorkshire> when I retired. It was like 
moving to a colony. From participation in politics, feeling that discussions 
and views were listened to, I had to accept that Westminster was, in effect, a 
different country, unconcerned about the views of subjects except near 
elections. No wonder there is apathy and distrust.

So size matters, decentralisation matters. But who is listening?

• For democracy to be real, people need skill, knowledge, confidence and 
contacts. Aristotle called politics the “master science” because it sets the 
priorities for all other sciences, and he saw its purpose as the common good of 
humanity. Unfortunately, citizenship education has almost disappeared from 
schools. Politics is difficult and demanding, but it affects everyone and is 
everyone’s business. We need a movement to promote skills for democracy at all 
levels of education, so that everyone can learn how the political system really 
works, why it matters, and how to take part. Without knowledge and skill, 
democratic citizenship is like owning a car without being able to drive or 
having a map of your area.
