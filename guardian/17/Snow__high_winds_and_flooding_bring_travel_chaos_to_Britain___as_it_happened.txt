A regional newspaper editor I used to work for used to say if there was no 
news, write about the weather. Well, the Plymouth Herald appears to have even 
found a way of writing about the weather when there’s no weather to write about.

The Environment Agency has moved more than 5 miles (8km) of temporary barriers 
and 25 pumps to depots and towns along the east coast.

It said the army was on standby to assist with its response to any flooding.

EA’s national duty manager Mark Sitton-Kent said: “The combination of 
gale-force winds, high tides, dangerous waves carrying rocks and a coastal 
surge means parts of the east coast are extremely dangerous.

“We have issued severe flood warnings and urge everyone to check their flood 
risk and ensure they are in a safe place.

“Our thoughts are with all those who are currently facing another uncertain 
day and night.

“We ask anyone tempted to go to the coast for a thrill or to take pictures to 
stay away - you would be putting yourself in unnecessary danger.”

IT manager Darren Clegg was facing his second night at the Tendring rest 
centre, after being evacuated last night from the nearby St Osyth’s beach 
caravan park.

He said he was told he didn’t have to be evacuated but was left with the 
impression that people who didn’t leave would be penalised.

Because he had had a glass of wine he could not drive, so walked three miles 
to pick up his car today. When he arrived the caravan park was shut and he 
couldn’t retrieve it, so he hitch-hiked back to the centre.

“I’m ok with spending another night here,” he said, adding that tonight he was 
going to try to avoid the snoring man who had kept him awake last night. “We’ve 
been very well looked after, there is food and tea, we had mattresses and 
sleeping bags so I can’t complain.”

He said that there had not been any clear information this morning, and he had 
got updates from journalists covering the story.

With a mi-fi connection he was taking the opportunity to work, and was trying 
not to think about the fate of his car and caravan. “I am not really worried- 
what will be, will be. We are all in the same position and I’ll just deal with 
it when it happens.”

Barry Dawson, 66, and Brenda Horwood, 74 came to the rest centre today in the 
hope of getting more information. The couple were worried about their bungalow 
that they have just finished renovating after 16 months.

Police had not called on them or posted an information leaflet, they said.

“My nan and grandad were floating around on an upturned table on Canvey Island 
in ‘53 so we’re not going to take any risks,” he said. He called the 
information availed “abysmal”.

“We’re alright, we’ve got the van and I’m a bit of a boy scout but the old 
people on our street, they can’t get out on their own. I’ve asked people here 
for information but they can’t tell me if my house is in the red zone or even 
when high tide is.”

Local authorities have triggered emergency measures to help rough sleepers as 
temperatures drop below zero. The emergency trigger– severe weather emergency 
protocols (SWEP) – means more outreach teams are sent onto the streets across 
England andWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> and local hostels put 
up more beds by using up all available space. “It’s a real lifesaving emergency 
situation,” said a spokeswoman for St Mungo’s.

Jaywick evacuation is under way, Essex police say

Jamie Grierson

The delayed evacuation of homes in Jaywick, Mistley and West Mersea, in Essex, 
has begun due to the expectation of severe flooding overnight.

A severe flood warning is in place for Jaywick, Mistley and West Mersea for 
high tide tonight at 12.15am in the early hours of Saturday. A full evacuation 
plan for the communities was triggered at 10.40am, Essex police said.

Ch Insp Russ Cole said:

I need residents in Jaywick, Mistley and West Mersea to comply with police 
instruction and evacuate immediately. Latest forecasting tells us that risk has 
moved to the next high tide expected just after midnight. That threat has led 
to a severe flood warning being put in place for tonight’s high tide.

Keeping people safe is our only priority and we will be evacuating residents 
from Jaywick, Mistley and West Mersea and need people to comply with our 
instructions.

That evacuation is most safely executed in daylight hours. We are activating 
our evacuation plans and are working closely with other partners including the 
other emergency services, local authorities, health and social care.

A rest centre has been established at Tendring Education Centre, Jaywick Lane, 
Clacton to accommodate Jaywick residents. Residents in Mistley will also be 
evacuated to Tendring Education Centre.

A rest centre at the Mica Centre, 38a High Street, West Mersea will be able to 
accommodate Mersea residents until their homes are deemed safe.

A regional newspaper editor I used to work for used to say if there was no 
news, write about the weather. Well, the Plymouth Herald appears to have even 
found a way of writing about the weather when there’s no weather to write about.

The Environment Agency has moved more than 5 miles (8km) of temporary barriers 
and 25 pumps to depots and towns along the east coast.

It said the army was on standby to assist with its response to any flooding.

EA’s national duty manager Mark Sitton-Kent said: “The combination of 
gale-force winds, high tides, dangerous waves carrying rocks and a coastal 
surge means parts of the east coast are extremely dangerous.

“We have issued severe flood warnings and urge everyone to check their flood 
risk and ensure they are in a safe place.

“Our thoughts are with all those who are currently facing another uncertain 
day and night.

“We ask anyone tempted to go to the coast for a thrill or to take pictures to 
stay away - you would be putting yourself in unnecessary danger.”
 
IT manager Darren Clegg was facing his second night at the Tendring rest 
centre, after being evacuated last night from the nearby St Osyth’s beach 
caravan park.

He said he was told he didn’t have to be evacuated but was left with the 
impression that people who didn’t leave would be penalised.

Because he had had a glass of wine he could not drive, so walked three miles 
to pick up his car today. When he arrived the caravan park was shut and he 
couldn’t retrieve it, so he hitch-hiked back to the centre.

“I’m ok with spending another night here,” he said, adding that tonight he was 
going to try to avoid the snoring man who had kept him awake last night. “We’ve 
been very well looked after, there is food and tea, we had mattresses and 
sleeping bags so I can’t complain.”

He said that there had not been any clear information this morning, and he had 
got updates from journalists covering the story.

With a mi-fi connection he was taking the opportunity to work, and was trying 
not to think about the fate of his car and caravan. “I am not really worried- 
what will be, will be. We are all in the same position and I’ll just deal with 
it when it happens.”

Barry Dawson, 66, and Brenda Horwood, 74 came to the rest centre today in the 
hope of getting more information. The couple were worried about their bungalow 
that they have just finished renovating after 16 months.

Police had not called on them or posted an information leaflet, they said.

“My nan and grandad were floating around on an upturned table on Canvey Island 
in ‘53 so we’re not going to take any risks,” he said. He called the 
information availed “abysmal”.

“We’re alright, we’ve got the van and I’m a bit of a boy scout but the old 
people on our street, they can’t get out on their own. I’ve asked people here 
for information but they can’t tell me if my house is in the red zone or even 
when high tide is.”
 
Local authorities have triggered emergency measures to help rough sleepers as 
temperatures drop below zero. The emergency trigger– severe weather emergency 
protocols (SWEP) – means more outreach teams are sent onto the streets across 
England andWales <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales> and local hostels put 
up more beds by using up all available space. “It’s a real lifesaving emergency 
situation,” said a spokeswoman for St Mungo’s.

Briefly looking ahead, the weekend weather looks quite different.

Quite a contrast in the weather this weekend. Whilst Saturday's looking cold 
but largely fine, Sunday will be wetter, and milder for many

The delayed evacuation of homes in Jaywick, Mistley and West Mersea, in Essex, 
has begun due to the expectation of severe flooding overnight.

A severe flood warning is in place for Jaywick, Mistley and West Mersea for 
high tide tonight at 12.15am in the early hours of Saturday. A full evacuation 
plan for the communities was triggered at 10.40am, Essex police said.

Ch Insp Russ Cole said:

I need residents in Jaywick, Mistley and West Mersea to comply with police 
instruction and evacuate immediately. Latest forecasting tells us that risk has 
moved to the next high tide expected just after midnight. That threat has led 
to a severe flood warning being put in place for tonight’s high tide.

Keeping people safe is our only priority and we will be evacuating residents 
from Jaywick, Mistley and West Mersea and need people to comply with our 
instructions.

That evacuation is most safely executed in daylight hours. We are activating 
our evacuation plans and are working closely with other partners including the 
other emergency services, local authorities, health and social care.

A rest centre has been established at Tendring Education Centre, Jaywick Lane, 
Clacton to accommodate Jaywick residents. Residents in Mistley will also be 
evacuated to Tendring Education Centre.

A rest centre at the Mica Centre, 38a High Street, West Mersea will be able to 
accommodate Mersea residents until their homes are deemed safe.
