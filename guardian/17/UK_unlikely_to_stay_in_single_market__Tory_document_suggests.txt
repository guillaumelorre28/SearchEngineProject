Britain is unlikely to be able to remain a member of the single market, 
according to a document photographed in the hands of a senior Conservative 
official on Downing Street.

A handwritten note, carried by an aide to the Tory vice-chair Mark Field after 
a meeting at the Department for Exiting theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, could be seen to say: “What’s the 
model? Have cake and eat it.”

And in a further embarrassment, it added “French likely to be most difficult.”

It also suggests that a deal on manufacturing with the EU should be 
“relatively straightforward” but admits that services, such as in the financial 
or legal sectors, are harder.

One idea cited in the note is a “Canada-plus” option, suggesting Britain could 
look to replicate the free trade deal hammered out by the EU over seven years 
with Ottawa.

However, it suggests that the UK would be seeking “more on services” than was 
agreed in the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (Ceta).

A government spokesperson distanced Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> from the document, saying: 
“These individual notes do not belong to a government official or a special 
adviser. They do not reflect the government’s position in relation to Brexit 
negotiations.”

However, the fact they appeared to have been taken during a meeting with 
officials or even ministers – given May’s tight-lipped approach to the 
negotiating strategy – means that they will be pored over.

The woman carrying the document appears to be Julia Dockerill, chief of staff 
to Field, who is vice-chair of the Conservative party, working on international 
issues and MP for the Cities of London and Westminster.

Field does not have a formal Brexit role but does take a keen interest on the 
impact that leaving the EU could have on the country’s financial services, many 
of which are based in his constituency, and is likely to have been speaking to 
senior figures about this issue.


Chance of an 'orderly' Brexit within two years is less than 50%, expert claims

The notes also said: “Transitional – loath to do it. Whitehall will hold onto 
it. We need to bring an end to negotiations.”


That could suggest that ministers are not keen to enter a transitional deal 
after the end of the article 50 period, despite May hinting last week that this 
would be possible.

Other comments include: “Difficult on article 50 implementation – Barnier 
wants to see what deal looks like first”, in reference to lead negotiator 
Michel Barnier.

“Got to be done in parallel – 20 odd negotiations. Keep the two years. Won’t 
provide more detail,” it adds. “We think it’s unlikely we’ll be offered Single 
Market.”

The document appears to reflect a discussion about the prospect of a trade 
deal like that of Norway, which is a member of the European Economic Area.

“Why no Norway – two elements – no ECJ intervention. Unlikely to do internal 
market.”

That appears to refer to the drawbacks of taking on the Norwegian model, which 
has the country outside the EU and its customs union, but inside the single 
market.

The reason Brexit supporters do not want to follow that idea is the 
requirement that Norway accepts free movement of people and is under the 
jurisdiction of the European court.

The document was being carried out of 9 Downing Street, the Brexit department, 
and into No 10 Downing Street when it was photographed. It comes after reports 
that there is a sign on the DExEU exit doors reading: “Stop! Are your documents 
on show?”.

It emerged on Monday that the government faces the prospect of a second legal 
challenge to 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/28/uk-government-faces-legal-challenge-over-single-market>
 its Brexit plans, with the group British Influence threatening a judicial 
review over whether leaving the EU means Britain must also automatically leave 
the European Economic Area and hence lose the free trading benefits of the 
single market.

However, the government and senior EU legal experts have claimed that this 
attempt is unlikely to be as successful as the high court ruling that 
parliament must have a vote before the Brexit process begins, which is the 
subject of an appeal by the government in the supreme court that is due to be 
heard next week.


Despite the denial about the note, it is likely to increase pressure on the 
government to lift the secrecy about its plan for Brexit, with opposition MPs 
complaining that there should be full transparency about the UK’s plans.

Stephen Gethins, the SNP spokesman on Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, said the notes reveal a 
government “with no direction, and no clue”.

“Worryingly, those in favour of taking us out of the EU appear set to cut off 
their nose to spite their face – with an apparent call to end any negotiations 
with Europe before they’ve properly begun and already wishing to pull the plug 
on the prospect of transitional arrangements,” he said.


“These scribbled papers, however scant, seem to be the only plan the UK 
government has and stand starkly in contrast to the very clear plans set out by 
first minister Nicola Sturgeon in the aftermath of the EU referendum.

“If they weren’t so deeply troubling, these revelations would be risible. 
Public patience has worn thin with stonewalling and obfuscating from the UK 
government – it’s now high time they set out a proper plan on leaving the EU as 
opposed to hastily jotted down notes, so short on substance.”

Tim Farron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tim-farron>, leader of the 
Lib Dems, added: “If this is a strategy it is incoherent. We can’t have our 
cake and eat it and there is no certainty on the single market. This picture 
shows the government doesn’t have a plan or even a clue.”


May has so far only promised to talk about her broad aims before triggering 
article 50 in March, and thereby officially notifying the EU of the UK’s 
intention to leave.


She has made clear that there will have to be more controls on immigration 
from the EU and wants to see an end to the jurisdiction of the European court 
of justice – which is why many think Britain will come out of the single market.

But the lack of further details from No 10 has alarmed many formerly pro-EU 
Labour and Tory MPs, who are increasingly cooperating in an attempt to stop a
“hard Brexit” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/28/hard-brexit-would-damage-almost-every-sector-of-uk-economy>
. Their key demands are staying as close to the single market as possible, a 
transitional deal to cushion the economic effect of leaving and more 
parliamentary scrutiny of the negotiations.

Some former remain politicians, including former prime ministers Tony Blair and
Sir John Major, are even pushing for a second referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/25/brexit-sir-john-major-says-perfectly-credible-case-for-second-referendum>
 to allow the public to vote on or even veto any deal for leaving the EU.

It was also reported in the Sunday Times that Mark Carney, the Bank of England 
governor, backs a transitional deal with the EU to cushion the impact of Brexit 
for businesses until at least 2021.
