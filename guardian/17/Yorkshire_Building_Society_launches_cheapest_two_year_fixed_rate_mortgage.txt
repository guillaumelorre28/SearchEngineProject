Another mortgage price war could be on the cards after Yorkshire Building 
Society launched a two-year fixed-rate deal with an interest rate of just 1.17%.

The society will offer borrowers with a 35% deposit the cheapest rate on the 
market, subject to a £1,345 product fee. The price cut follows a small increase 
in the cost of short-term fixed-rate mortgages since the summer.

Brendan Gilligan, product manager at Yorkshire Building Society, said it could 
offer a low rate because it was a mutual. “We reinvest our profits into the 
business to provide the best rates possible for our members,” he said.

The past fortnight has seen several of the UK’s biggest lenders make changes 
to criteria to attract customers and build market share. Barclays increased the 
amount it would lend through its“family springboard” guarantor mortgage to 100%

 both raised the ages to which they will offer loans. And on Monday, Nationwide 
cut the rates on mortgages for borrowers with small deposits.


Lenders are keen to do business and in April told the Bank of England that 
they expected demand for loans to increase in the second quarter of the year.

Figures from the Bank show the average rate of interest on a two-year 
fixed-rate mortgage for someone with a 25% deposit fell to 1.85% in April 2016, 
after creeping up from a low of 1.83% in June 2015 to reach 1.93% earlier this 
year.

The Yorkshire Building Society deal is not the lowest two-year fixed rate ever 
offered –that was a 1.05% mortgage from the Post Office

 available in July 2015 to borrowers with a 40% deposit. The mutual also 
offered a lower rate of 1.07% in 2015.

Andrew Montlake, of mortgage broker Coreco, said it would be “interesting to 
see how lenders play things over the next few weeks given the EU vote, which 
could mean a slight slowdown in business levels as people wait for the result”.


He added: “Lenders are still keen to get business in and it would be no 
surprise to see a mild rate war break out. The real battleground is around 
lending criteria rather than rate alone, which should help more borrowers find 
a way into the market.”

Charlotte Nelson, of financial information provider Moneyfacts, said: “Over 
the past few months we have seen the lowest rates creep up. However, it seems 
that the lowest mortgage rate war is starting again between providers, with 
many wanting to attract new customers – and the best way to do that is confirm 
they are the lowest in the market.

“It is possible that with a base rate rise being stretched further into the 
distance we could see rates fall again to the lows we have seen in the past if 
not further.”
