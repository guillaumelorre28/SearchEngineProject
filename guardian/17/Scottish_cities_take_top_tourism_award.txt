 Despite the slump in Scottish tourism, Edinburgh and Glasgow are the best two 
cities in the United Kingdom, according to this year's travel and tourism 
awards made by The Observer and the Guardian.
The awards were welcomed by Henry McLeish, the Minister for Enterprise and 
Lifelong Learning, who said he wanted the cities to be marketed as a twin 
attraction.

McLeish was speaking from the United States, where he is on a tour to promote 
investment and tourism.

He has been fending off criticism since the publication earlier this month of 
figures showing an 11 per cent fall in the number of overseas visitors to
Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> over the last year. McLeish 
said: 'This is excellent news. It confirms the potential of Scottish tourism.

'As part of our tourism drive I want to see Edinburgh and Glasgow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/glasgow> working closely, presenting themselves 
as "twin cities", not only to the UK, but to the rest of the world.'

It is the second year running that Edinburgh and Glasgow have taken the top 
spots in the awards which were based on the results of questionnaires in both 
newspapers which were completed by 17,000 readers.
