What we'll be discussing

Recycling rates in the UK have been stalling over the past five years. 
Government figurespublished in December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/15/recycling-rates-england-drop-first-time>
 show that the recycling rate in England actually fell from 44.8% in 2014 to 
43.9% in 2015.

This debate will explore potential solutions: how can producers and consumers 
be incentivised to recycle more? Would a tax on the manufacturers of packaging, 
for example, encourage better design? Do local authorities need clearer 
guidelines to prevent confusion among consumers?

Join us and our panel of experts in the comments section of this page on 
Thursday 19 January at 1-2pm (GMT) to discuss.
