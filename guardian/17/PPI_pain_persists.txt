The payment protection mis-selling scandal will not go away. As many as 5,000 
people a week are still complaining to the Financial Ombudsman Service about 
the way they were sold PPI and the way their claims have been handled by their 
banks.

This is down from 12,000 a year ago, but nonetheless PPI still accounts for 
two-thirds of all the problems reaching the ombudman's in-tray, a greater 
proportion than a year ago.

The banking industry is in the shameful position of already having set aside 
more than £20bn (according to Which?)to cover the cost of what has become 
Britain's biggest mis-selling scandal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/feb/03/ppi-banks-misselling>.

It is far bigger than was ever imagined back in May 2011 when Lloyds Banking 
Group was the first to throw in the towel on a legal battle with the regulator 
and start paying out claims. Back then Lloyds' bill was regarded as enormous: 
£3.2bn. By February this year it had reached an eye-watering £9.8bn – though it 
is yet to use £2.3bn of this provision.

But this has not stopped expectations that the industry's bill may yet rise 
further. There is now speculation that the banks will take a further £1.5bn hit 
when they report their half-year results, starting next week.

Barclays may have provided a clue in May of what is to come when it said: 
"March 2014 saw a significant spike in PPI complaints received via claims 
management companies, with the majority of these complaints relating to PPI 
sold over 10 years ago". It is a headache. A painful one.

But it is always worth remembering that this is a business that the City 
regulator has estimated brought in £44bn of premiums for the banks on 46m 
policies.
