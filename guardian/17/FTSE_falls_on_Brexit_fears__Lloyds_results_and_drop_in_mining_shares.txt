Leading shares have fallen back, with some profit taking in mining shares and 
a slide inLloyds Banking Group following its figures.

Antofagasta is the biggest faller so far, down 40.5p at 500p after it said 
full year copper production would be at the lower end of its guidance and 
suggested it might reconsider a hydroelectric project at its Los Pelambres mine 
because of cost overruns.

Other miners have given up some of their recent gains, with Anglo American 
down 21.5p at 1092.5p andBHP Billiton 22.5p lower at 1238.5p. A dip in the oil 
price on continuing doubts about whether production curbs can be agreed by Opec 
next month has also hit sentiment in the commodities sector.

Meanwhile Lloyds Banking Group has lost 1.74p to 53.61p after it unveiled a 
fresh £1bn provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance.

Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 63.37 points to 6954.27, not helped by new 
Brexit worries. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

The market got another dose of Brexit negativity this Wednesday morning, with 
the Resolution Foundation claiming that Britain faces a £84 billion black hole 
in the next half a decade

.

That report immediately dragged on the FTSE, which fell by 0.5% after the 
bell. The pound seemed slightly less effected by the news; against the dollar 
it saw flat, just below the 1.22 mark it slipped under yesterday, while against 
the euro it shed another 0.2%.

The Resolution Foundation’s warning wasn’t all weighing on the UK index, 
however.... The FTSE was also dealing with the 3% slide seen by Lloyds 
following its third quarter report, with the bank revealing it had incurred 
another £1 billion charge related to the mis-selling of PPI.

Supermarkets were lifted by positive comments from Goldman Sachs, with Tesco 
up 1.6p at 211.75p andSainsbury 1.7p better at 241.9p.

Goldman also helped FirstGroup, up 1.7p to 106.5p, as it raised its target 
price from 146p to 168p.

Elsewhere education group Pearson is down 5.5p at 741p following reports it is 
considering a disposal. Ian Whittaker at Liberum said:

The Economic Times in India reports that Pearson is in talks to sell part or 
all of their online education company TutorVista. The article suggests that 
Pearson will have to sell the assets at a loss given there has been a revenue 
decline.Pearson <https://www.theguardian.com/business/pearson> has not 
commented but a sale of part or all of the business would raise further 
questions on Pearson’s strategy, its M&A track record and, probably less so, 
whether the sale is being used to raise cash. Reiterate Sell.
