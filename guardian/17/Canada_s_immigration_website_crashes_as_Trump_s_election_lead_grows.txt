Canada’s main immigration website appeared to suffer repeated outages on 
Tuesday night as Trump took the lead in several major states and his prospects 
for winning the US presidency turned markedly higher.


 Some users in the United States, Canada and Asia saw an internal server error 
message when trying to access theCitizenship and Immigration Canada 
<http://www.cic.gc.ca/ website> website. 

When the Guardian clicked on the page it would not load and a “this page isn’t 
working” error message came up.

 Officials for the ministry could not immediately be reached for comment, but 
the website’s problems were noted by many on Twitter.

Data from Google Trends also suggested searches for “move to Canada” spiked 
significantly during the night as Trump victories unfolded in key battle states 
such as Florida and Ohio.

Canadians took to Twitter to comment on the night’s developments, with

soon trending in the country.

Caitlin Green tweeted: “If anyone needs me I’ll be drinking maple syrup until 
I pass out, while singing OhCanada <https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada>.”

Singer Marcio Novelli wrote: “Canada is the second largest country in the 
world with one-tenth of America’s population. We’ve got room.”

And in what many viewed as a reference to the Republican candidate, the 
official Canada Twitter account posted: “In Canada immigrants are encouraged to 
bring their cultural traditions with them and share them with their fellow 
citizens.”

, if Trump wins has been bubbling along throughout the election.

In February, the island of Cape Breton on Canada’s Atlantic coast marketed 
itself as a tranquil refuge for Americans seeking to escape should Trump 
capture the White House.
