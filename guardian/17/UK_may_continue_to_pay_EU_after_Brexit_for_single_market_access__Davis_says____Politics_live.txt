Sir Keir Starmer <https://www.theguardian.com/law/keir-starmer> says the 
government says there will be no running commentary on the government’s Brexit 
plans. Yet there is a running commentary, based on leaks and what Boris Johnson 
is saying. This is damaging. So when will the government set out its plans.

Davis says the government has already set out its strategic aims. It does not 
want to, at this stage at least, go into great detail.

The key issue is what’s best for Britain, Davis says.

Starmer says Davis told MPs recently that the government would reveal in due 
course whether the government will seek to remain in the customs union. There 
are just 121 days until article 50 has to be invoked, he says.

Davis says 121 days is a long time in policy terms. The government is doing 
the analysis first before deciding its policy. Starmer will have to wait until 
the analysis is complete.

 * Davis confirms government is still analysing its Brexit options and has not 
yet finalised its policy. Facebook

Davis says Boris Johnson does not support free movement

David Davis says what he has seen in the papers today about Boris Johnson - he 
is referring to this Sky story 
<http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-supports-freedom-of-movement-in-brexit-10678355>
 - is completely at odds with what Johnson thinks.

Johnson thinks some immigration is valuable. But that is not the same as 
saying that there should be free movement, he says.

 * Davis says Boris Johnson does not support free movement, contrary to claims 
based on what he allegedly told ambassadors in private.

Government may continue to pay EU after Brexit for single market access, Davis 
says

David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is responding to questions in the Commons 
now.

Labour’s Wayne David asks if the government will consider making any 
contribution to the EU after Brexit in return for access to the single market.

Davis says the government’s priority is to get the best possible access to the 
single market. So if that would involve paying the EU, then the government 
would consider it.

 * Davis says government considering paying EU for continued access to single 
market. 
Labour’s Hilary Benn says, in the week when it has has been reported that 
Boris Johnson is telling ambassadors about the government’s plans, 
<http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-supports-freedom-of-movement-in-brexit-10678355>
does Davis understand why MPs are fed up with not being told about the 
government’s plans.

Davis says Benn knows full well that the success of the negotiations depend on 
keeping things secret.

He says the “scribbled note in Downing Street” did not represent government 
policy.

Matthew Pennycook, the shadow Brexit minister, says it has been reported that 
Britain may have to pay €60bn to leave the EU. 
<https://www.ft.com/content/480b4ae0-aa9e-11e6-9cb3-bb8207902122> How much will 
the government spend?

Davis says that 60bn figure was just an opening bid from Brussels.

And here is my colleague Alan Travis’s story on the immigration figures.

Immigration to UK hit record levels in run-up to Brexit vote, latest figures

And here is how it starts.

Immigration to Britain hit its highest ever annual level of 650,000 in the 
run-up to the Brexit referendum, new official figures have revealed.

But the latest official figures show that since the Brexit vote in June new 
national insurance registrations by workers from theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> have fallen, with the largest drop – 17% 
– among workers from Poland and other east European countries.

The latest quarterly figures show that annual net migration to Britain in the 
12 months to June 2016 continued at a record level of 335,000, according to the 
Office of National Statistics.

Here is the first take from the Press Association’s story on the immigration 
figures.

Net long-term migration to the UK has remained around record levels at a third 
of a million as the inflow of EU citizens hit a historic high, official figures 
show.

The headline measure - the overall difference between the numbers arriving and 
leaving the country - was estimated at 335,000 in the year to June.

This was just below the previous peak of 336,000 in the previous year. 

Immigration, which covers the numbers of people coming into Britain only, was 
at 650,000 - the highest estimate recorded, the Office for National Statistics 
said.

An unprecedented 284,000 EU citizens are estimated to have arrived in the UK 
in the year to June, which covers a period up to and just after the referendum, 
while net migration from the bloc, which excludes UK citizens who went to other 
EU states, was at 189,000.

We have known for a long time that Theresa May has hardline views on 
immigration - David Cameron reportedly told colleagues that she seemed to be 
the only person in his cabinet, apart from him, who actually wanted to hit the 
Tory target of getting net migration below 100,000 - but a leak today sheds new 
light on her thinking on this topic. Last year May wanted schools to 
“deprioritise” the children of migrants living in the UK illegally.As letters 
leaked to the BBC reveal <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38165395>, the 
education department opposed the idea strongly and it was dropped from the 
immigration bill. The episode helps to explain why Nicky Morgan, then education 
secretary, was sacked when May became prime minister.

This morning Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has described the 
proposal as “disgusting” and said it is worrying that May was even considering 
it. Rayner told the Today programme:

It shows that actually Theresa May was not just considering it, her department 
was pushing it and I’m deeply concerned about it. I think it’s a terrible idea. 
Denying innocent children because of the circumstances of their parents the 
right to a good education is disgusting, it’s not a British value that we have.

There will be more on this topic today when the immigration figures come out 
within the next hour.

Here is the agenda for the day.

9.30am: Immigration figures are published.

9.30am: David Davis, the Brexit secretary, takes questions in the Commons.

10am: Sir Michael Wilshaw, the outgoing Ofsted chief inspector, publishes his 
final report.

And people are voting today in the Richmond Park byelection.

As usual, I will also be covering the breaking political news as it happens, 
as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read 
them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere 
and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although 
sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a 
question to me on Twitter.

David Jones, the Brexit minister, tells MPs that the government is still 
considering what powers repatriated from Brussels will be devolved to Scotland.
 
Sir Keir Starmer <https://www.theguardian.com/law/keir-starmer> says the 
government says there will be no running commentary on the government’s Brexit 
plans. Yet there is a running commentary, based on leaks and what Boris Johnson 
is saying. This is damaging. So when will the government set out its plans.

Davis says the government has already set out its strategic aims. It does not 
want to, at this stage at least, go into great detail.

The key issue is what’s best for Britain, Davis says.

Starmer says Davis told MPs recently that the government would reveal in due 
course whether the government will seek to remain in the customs union. There 
are just 121 days until article 50 has to be invoked, he says.

Davis says 121 days is a long time in policy terms. The government is doing 
the analysis first before deciding its policy. Starmer will have to wait until 
the analysis is complete.

 * Davis confirms government is still analysing its Brexit options and has not 
yet finalised its policy.  
David Davis says what he has seen in the papers today about Boris Johnson - he 
is referring to this Sky story 
<http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-supports-freedom-of-movement-in-brexit-10678355>
 - is completely at odds with what Johnson thinks.

Johnson thinks some immigration is valuable. But that is not the same as 
saying that there should be free movement, he says.

 * Davis says Boris Johnson does not support free movement, contrary to claims 
based on what he allegedly told ambassadors in private.  
David says we are four months from triggering article 50. That will be the 
point when the government is very clear about where it is going, he says.
 
David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is responding to questions in the Commons 
now.

Labour’s Wayne David asks if the government will consider making any 
contribution to the EU after Brexit in return for access to the single market.

Davis says the government’s priority is to get the best possible access to the 
single market. So if that would involve paying the EU, then the government 
would consider it.

 * Davis says government considering paying EU for continued access to single 
market. 
Labour’s Hilary Benn says, in the week when it has has been reported that 
Boris Johnson is telling ambassadors about the government’s plans, 
<http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-supports-freedom-of-movement-in-brexit-10678355>
does Davis understand why MPs are fed up with not being told about the 
government’s plans.

Davis says Benn knows full well that the success of the negotiations depend on 
keeping things secret.

He says the “scribbled note in Downing Street” did not represent government 
policy.

Matthew Pennycook, the shadow Brexit minister, says it has been reported that 
Britain may have to pay €60bn to leave the EU. 
<https://www.ft.com/content/480b4ae0-aa9e-11e6-9cb3-bb8207902122> How much will

Davis says that 60bn figure was just an opening bid from Brussels.

And here is how it starts.

Immigration to Britain hit its highest ever annual level of 650,000 in the 
run-up to the Brexit referendum, new official figures have revealed.

But the latest official figures show that since the Brexit vote in June new 
national insurance registrations by workers from theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> have fallen, with the largest drop – 17% 
– among workers from Poland and other east European countries.

The latest quarterly figures show that annual net migration to Britain in the 
12 months to June 2016 continued at a record level of 335,000, according to the 
Office of National Statistics.
 
Here is the ONS statistical bulletin with the quarterly migration figures.

Here is the first take from the Press Association’s story on the immigration 
figures.

Net long-term migration to the UK has remained around record levels at a third 
of a million as the inflow of EU citizens hit a historic high, official figures 
show.

The headline measure - the overall difference between the numbers arriving and 
leaving the country - was estimated at 335,000 in the year to June.

This was just below the previous peak of 336,000 in the previous year. 

Immigration, which covers the numbers of people coming into Britain only, was 
at 650,000 - the highest estimate recorded, the Office for National Statistics 
said.

An unprecedented 284,000 EU citizens are estimated to have arrived in the UK 
in the year to June, which covers a period up to and just after the referendum, 
while net migration from the bloc, which excludes UK citizens who went to other 
EU states, was at 189,000.
 
The migration figures are out.

At 335,000, net migration is still more than three times higher than the 
government’s target, 100,000.

We have known for a long time that Theresa May has hardline views on 
immigration - David Cameron reportedly told colleagues that she seemed to be 
the only person in his cabinet, apart from him, who actually wanted to hit the 
Tory target of getting net migration below 100,000 - but a leak today sheds new 
light on her thinking on this topic. Last year May wanted schools to 
“deprioritise” the children of migrants living in the UK illegally.As letters 
leaked to the BBC reveal <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38165395>, the 
education department opposed the idea strongly and it was dropped from the 
immigration bill. The episode helps to explain why Nicky Morgan, then education 
secretary, was sacked when May became prime minister.

This morning Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has described the 
proposal as “disgusting” and said it is worrying that May was even considering 
it. Rayner told the Today programme:

It shows that actually Theresa May was not just considering it, her department 
was pushing it and I’m deeply concerned about it. I think it’s a terrible idea. 
Denying innocent children because of the circumstances of their parents the 
right to a good education is disgusting, it’s not a British value that we have.

There will be more on this topic today when the immigration figures come out 
within the next hour.

Here is the agenda for the day.

9.30am: Immigration figures are published.

9.30am: David Davis, the Brexit secretary, takes questions in the Commons.

10am: Sir Michael Wilshaw, the outgoing Ofsted chief inspector, publishes his 
final report.

And people are voting today in the Richmond Park byelection.

As usual, I will also be covering the breaking political news as it happens, 
as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read 
them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere 
and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although 
sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a 
question to me on Twitter.
