 – when the currency nosedived by 9% against the dollar in Asian trading hours 
– was caused by a combination of inexperienced traders, algorithmic trading and 
complex trading positions,according to an official report 
<https://www.bis.org/publ/mktc09.htm>.

No single factor caused the dramatic moves

 which compounded the weakness of sterling after the Brexit vote, the 
international banking body, the Bank for International Settlements, said.

Other factors such as “fat finger” errors and potential market abuse cannot be 
ruled out, but there is little, if any, hard data to substantiate them, the 
report added.

The actions of individual participants, who are not identified, may have 
helped perpetuate the fall, as did the derivatives trading positions placed in 
the market. Some traders halted activity for as long as 30 minutes, including 
the black box algorithmic trading which does not rely on individuals to place 
orders.

Some of the trades made as sterling plunged to as low as $1.1491 – down from 
$1.26000 – just after midnight on 7 October were later cancelled, the BIS 
report said.

“Whatever the cause of the initial selling in sterling, the market was likely 
to be vulnerable at that time of day to sharp moves and an associated 
withdrawal of liquidity,” the report said.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who asked the BIS to investigate, said 
it was vital that lessons were learned from the incident, which drove the pound 
to the lowest level since March 1985.

“The report finds that there were no material losses incurred by systemic 
financial institutions, large volumes were transacted around the event window 
despite the illiquid time of day, and spillovers to other markets were very 
limited,” said Carney.

 The pound’s fall during October’s flash crash 
The report breaks down the event into three stages. First, just after 
midnight, for a period of only eight seconds (00:07:03 to 00:07:11) sterling 
fell from $1.2600 to 1.2494. About £252m of pound-dollar trades and €52m (£42m) 
of euro-pound trades took place on the Reuters platform.


Second, at 00:07:15, the Chicago Merchantile Exchange triggered its velocity 
logic mechanism, which pauses trading for 10 seconds on the futures exchange. 
Around this time, it become more difficult to find a price for the pound on the 
currency markets as there were not enough “bid” offers, which would have 
cushioned its falls. This was an “unusual phenomenon”, the report said.

By 00:07:15 the pound was at $1.24 and “gapping between trades” to slide to 
$1.1491 at 00:07:41, a 9% fall. Those were the prices quoted by Reuters and the 
report noted that the currency traded lower on other trading platforms.

In the third phase, the pound began to recover and was 2.2% down against the 
dollar by 00:20:00.

The event took place amid thin trading and during a public holiday in China. 
which also meant big players may not have been in the market. A survey of 12 of 
the most active dealers showed that the lack of buy orders may have been caused 
by trading positions already in place.

The time of day meant that traders were less experienced in sterling markets. 
“Such individuals were likely to have had lower risk limits and risk appetite, 
and may have had less expertise in the suitability of particular algorithms for 
the prevailing market conditions,” the report said.


“Evidence in the UK also suggests that some traders’ participation during the 
event may have been constrained as a result of concerns around potential market 
and conduct risks associated with trading in illiquid markets away from 
previous prevailing price levels. Both factors could have exaggerated the speed 
and dysfunctional nature of the price movement.”


As the slide coincided with a Financial Times story saying French president 
François Hollande was calling for a hard Brexit 
<https://www.ft.com/content/5f84e4c4-8c17-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731>, this had 
been cited as a potential cause. However, the report said this “is only likely 
to have added marginal weight to the move as it did not contain new 
information”.
