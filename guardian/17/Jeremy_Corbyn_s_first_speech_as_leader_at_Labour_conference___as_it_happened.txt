John McDonnell's Guardian fringe - Summary

Here are the main points from what John McDonnell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell> said.

 * McDonnell criticised Michael Dugher, the shadow culture secretary, for 
saying that the “punishment beatings” against non-Corbynites had to stop.Dugher 
said that in a comment to the Sunday Times.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/27/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-interview-on-the-andrew-marr-show-politics-live#block-56079f19e4b007191f0ba683>
McDonnell says stories about some Labour MPs facing deselection were “absolute 
rubbish”. And he went on: 
And then someone said something about “punishment beatings”. That’s laughable.

 * McDonnell said Labour should consider changing its rules so that the leader 
and deputy cannot both be men. The party should try for gender balance, he said.
 * He said he hoped Ed Miliband would in time return to the Labour front bench 
to serve under Jeremy Corbyn. 
 * McDonnell cast doubt on Chuka Umunna’s account of why he refused to serve 
in the shadow cabinet.Umunna said a key factor was Jeremy Corbyn’s stance on 
Europe. But “Chuka never spoke to us on that”, McDonnell said 
 * He said Labour MPs should be offered a free vote on military intervention 
in Syria. He would vote against, he said. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

McDonnell says it is hard for people to cope with change. They have to assure 
people that there is room for everyone. Producing policy through rumbustious 
debate will produce better policy.

And that’s it.

I will post a quick summary soon.

Q: Tell us about yourself?

McDonnell says he was brought up in Liverpool, in a working class family. He 
worked on the shopfloor, then went to Brunel, then worked for the NUM. Then he 
was on the GLC. And then he became an MP. But he never had a career plan.

Q: Have you got an allotment?

McDonnell says his garden is a mess. His wife said they should take up a 
hobby. He tried dinghy sailing. It was freezing. Then they tried in Sardinia, 
and that was better. Now he has a small boat that he sails on the Norfolk 
Broads. They are crap sailors, he says. But the Broads are great; you cannot 
get a signal on a mobile phone, he says.

McDonnell says that, for the first time, a majority of people in the shadow 
cabinet are women.

He says the notion of top jobs never came into it. The idea of their being 
four top jobs in government is based on 19th century thinking, when the Foreign 
Office just invaded places, and the Home Office just repressed people.

He says there might be a case for changing the rules so that there is gender 
balance on the leader/deputy leader ticket.

Q: What about the fears that MPs will be deselected?

McDonnell says some of the reports this week, including the one about 
“punishment beatings” (Michael Dugher in the Sunday Times) are nonsense.

The mood has been very positive, he says.

And he says that, contrary to reports, the mood at the first PLP was friendly.

McDonnell says Syria and Trident are the two difficult issues for Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.

Nato and Europe have not been divisive issues.

Q: But Chuka Umunna refused a job over Europe?

McDonnell says Umunna “never spoke to us” about Europe.

He says some MPs were resigning from positions they had not been offered on 
the basis of policies they had not seen.

On most issues the party will be able to find a compromise, he says.

He says MPs will also find that they have much bigger constituency parties 
because of the increased membership.

McDonnell calls for free vote on Syria for Labour MPs

Q: How will the party deal with issues where it is split?

McDonnell says on many issues the party will be able to compromise. On others 
that will not be possible.

He says he has been in the Commons on five occasions when a decision has been 
taken to send troops into action.

This is a conscience issue, he says.

He thinks sending troops to war should be a conscience issue. MPs should have 
a free vote.

McDonnell says at times he was “brimming over with anger” at the wasted 
opportunity of NewLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.

Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> is 
different. McDonnell says he can be aggressive. Corbyn is more consensual.

Q: When will you use your aggression in your new role?

It is a matter of channelling it, he says.

Economic credibility is key. No party can be elected unless it is seen as 
credible on the economy.

Every time Labour discovers a policy, it will have to test them and test them, 
he says.

It needs to get its views accepted as common sense.

Q: Why did Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> lose?

McDonnell says Labour’s message was not clear enough.

After the election he drew up plans to radicalise the parliamentary Labour 
party over the next five years. He thought he might be able to get more 
leftwing candidates in, and get 30% of the PLP to be filled by leftwingers by 
2020.

He saw himself moving into an elderly statesman role.

But the left were under pressure to run a candidate. He convened a meeting, 
and McDonnell said they would not be able to run a candidate. He thought they 
would only get 22 nominations. They had a meeting. McDonnell said he had run 
twice. Diane Abbott said she had tried. They all looked toJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>. He cracked and agreed to 
run. He says that is the leader you should have - someone who does not want to 
serve.

Then he and Jon Lansman started working on getting nominations. On the day 
nominations closed they only got the names at the very last minute. Andrew 
Smith and Gordon Marsden were the two last MPs to sign.

Here are the main points from what John McDonnell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell> said.

 * McDonnell criticised Michael Dugher, the shadow culture secretary, for 
saying that the “punishment beatings” against non-Corbynites had to stop.Dugher 
said that in a comment to the Sunday Times.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/27/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-interview-on-the-andrew-marr-show-politics-live#block-56079f19e4b007191f0ba683>
McDonnell says stories about some Labour MPs facing deselection were “absolute 
rubbish”. And he went on: 
And then someone said something about “punishment beatings”. That’s laughable.

 * McDonnell said Labour should consider changing its rules so that the leader 
and deputy cannot both be men. The party should try for gender balance, he said.
 * He said he hoped Ed Miliband would in time return to the Labour front bench 
to serve under Jeremy Corbyn. 
 * McDonnell cast doubt on Chuka Umunna’s account of why he refused to serve 
in the shadow cabinet.Umunna said a key factor was Jeremy Corbyn’s stance on 
Europe. But “Chuka never spoke to us on that”, McDonnell said 
 * He said Labour MPs should be offered a free vote on military intervention 
in Syria. He would vote against, he said. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.
 
McDonnell says it is hard for people to cope with change. They have to assure 
people that there is room for everyone. Producing policy through rumbustious 
debate will produce better policy.

And that’s it.

I will post a quick summary soon.
 
Q: Tell us about yourself?

McDonnell says he was brought up in Liverpool, in a working class family. He 
worked on the shopfloor, then went to Brunel, then worked for the NUM. Then he 
was on the GLC. And then he became an MP. But he never had a career plan.

Q: Have you got an allotment?

McDonnell says his garden is a mess. His wife said they should take up a 
hobby. He tried dinghy sailing. It was freezing. Then they tried in Sardinia, 
and that was better. Now he has a small boat that he sails on the Norfolk 
Broads. They are crap sailors, he says. But the Broads are great; you cannot 
get a signal on a mobile phone, he says.
 
McDonnell says that, for the first time, a majority of people in the shadow 
cabinet are women.

He says the notion of top jobs never came into it. The idea of their being 
four top jobs in government is based on 19th century thinking, when the Foreign 
Office just invaded places, and the Home Office just repressed people.

He says there might be a case for changing the rules so that there is gender 
balance on the leader/deputy leader ticket.
 
McDonnell says Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> has to 
build a movement again. The party will rise to the challenge, he says.
 
Q: What about the fears that MPs will be deselected?

McDonnell says some of the reports this week, including the one about 
“punishment beatings” (Michael Dugher in the Sunday Times) are nonsense.

The mood has been very positive, he says.

And he says that, contrary to reports, the mood at the first PLP was friendly.
 
McDonnell says Syria and Trident are the two difficult issues for Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.

Nato and Europe have not been divisive issues.

Q: But Chuka Umunna refused a job over Europe?

McDonnell says Umunna “never spoke to us” about Europe.

He says some MPs were resigning from positions they had not been offered on 
the basis of policies they had not seen.

On most issues the party will be able to find a compromise, he says.

He says MPs will also find that they have much bigger constituency parties 
because of the increased membership.
 
Q: How will the party deal with issues where it is split?

McDonnell says on many issues the party will be able to compromise. On others 
that will not be possible.

He says he has been in the Commons on five occasions when a decision has been 
taken to send troops into action.

This is a conscience issue, he says.

He thinks sending troops to war should be a conscience issue. MPs should have 
a free vote.

 * McDonnell calls for free vote on Syria for Labour MPs  
McDonnell says he won’t back bombing Syria.
 
McDonnell says at times he was “brimming over with anger” at the wasted 
opportunity of NewLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.

Jeremy Corbyn <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> is 
different. McDonnell says he can be aggressive. Corbyn is more consensual.

Q: When will you use your aggression in your new role?

It is a matter of channelling it, he says.

Economic credibility is key. No party can be elected unless it is seen as 
credible on the economy.

Every time Labour discovers a policy, it will have to test them and test them, 
he says.

It needs to get its views accepted as common sense.
 
McDonnell says he learnt a huge amount about finance at the GLC from one of 
the officials, who was one of the best public servants he has met.
 
McDonnell says the Eastern Daily Press put a notice in the paper asking if 
anyone knew anything about him. A woman wrote in, saying she used to sit next 
to him at primary school, and that he used to whisper the maths answers to her.
 
McDonnell says they started booking halls. And far more people than expected 
turned up.

Q: You used to be seen as a revolutionary. And now you want to be seen as a 
bank manager.

McDonnell says he is a bureaucratic. After university he wanted to manage the 
Co-op. He wanted to show that socialism could work in practice.
 
Q: Why did Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> lose?

McDonnell says Labour’s message was not clear enough.

After the election he drew up plans to radicalise the parliamentary Labour 
party over the next five years. He thought he might be able to get more 
leftwing candidates in, and get 30% of the PLP to be filled by leftwingers by 
2020.

He saw himself moving into an elderly statesman role.

But the left were under pressure to run a candidate. He convened a meeting, 
and McDonnell said they would not be able to run a candidate. He thought they 
would only get 22 nominations. They had a meeting. McDonnell said he had run 
twice. Diane Abbott said she had tried. They all looked toJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>. He cracked and agreed to 
run. He says that is the leader you should have - someone who does not want to 
serve.

Then he and Jon Lansman started working on getting nominations. On the day 
nominations closed they only got the names at the very last minute. Andrew 
Smith and Gordon Marsden were the two last MPs to sign.
