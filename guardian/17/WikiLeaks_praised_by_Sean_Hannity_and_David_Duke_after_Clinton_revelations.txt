On Friday night, the Fox News <https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news> 
personality Sean Hannity and David Duke, a US Senate candidate in Louisiana and 
former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, became the latest to offer their support.

In response to a tweet from the Nebraska Republican senator Ben Sasse that was 
critical of the Clinton leaks, Hannitypraised 
<https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/789654430975164416> Assange and 
WikiLeaks for having “done the USA a great service” by exposing “government 
corruption” and cybersecurity weakness.
Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) 
Senator Wiki has done the USA a great service. 1) he showed us we have no 
cyber security. 2) He has exposed how corrupt our government is.

WikiLeaks, which Assange founded in 2006, has been posting daily batches of 
emails from Clinton’s campaign chair, John Podesta, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/14/wiileaks-from-liberal-beacon-to-a-prop-for-trump-what-has-happened>
 seemingly in an attempt to harm Clinton’s electoral chances. Among other 
things, the leaks have shown communications with journalists that were meant to 
be kept secret, political advice about rivals within and without the Democratic 
party, and details of the candidate’s paid speeches to Wall Street firms.

Clinton has raised questions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/clinton-campaign-wikileaks-hack-russia-donald-trump>
 about the possible involvement of Russian hackers in obtaining the documents – 
the US governmenthas accused Russia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election>
 of being behind the hacks against the Democratic National Committee – and what 
it would mean if Vladimir Putin’s government were trying influence the race.

Trump has said information disclosed in the leaks ought to disqualify Clinton 
from the presidential election.

Some observers believe Assange is personally antagonistic to Clinton, who was 
secretary of state when the US began investigating him for potential crimes 
under the Espionage Act.

WikiLeaks came to prominence in 2010 for a massive dump of diplomatic cables 
and army reports related to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars provided to media 
outletsincluding the Guardian <https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks> by 
an American soldier,Chelsea Manning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chelsea-manning>. 

At the time, Hannity suggested that “people might die” because of the leaks. 
On Friday, hetweeted <https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/789658558560342016>
: “And I have said on radio and TV that my original fears were wrong. My 
biggest fear was people would die as a result. Listen, watch learn.”

Since 2012, Assange has been running WikiLeaks from the Ecuadorian embassy in 
London, after applying for political asylum. He is wanted in Sweden for rape, 
an accusation he links to a conspiracy to extradite him to the US to face 
charges. This week, the Ecuadorian embassysaid it had removed his internet 
access
