Montparnasse cafes 
The big cafes of the “lost generation” are still alive in the heart of 
Montparnasse. Le Sélect and La Coupole opened in the 1920s and their original 
Art Deco interiors survive. The Closerie des Lilas was where Ernest Hemingway 
wrote, but he caroused at the Dingo Bar, now the Auberge de Venise. F Scott 
Fitzgerald tracked him down there in 1925, the year The Great Gatsby came out. 
The mahogany bar where they met remains.

Shakespeare and Company
This lively and labyrinthine bookshop <https://shakespeareandcompany.com/> on 
the Left Bank, near Notre Dame, is filled to the ceiling with books old and 
new. The outdoor patio has a little cafe, where regular readings by writers 
take place.

Jardin du Luxembourg 
Enter on the Saint-Michel side and you’ll find a leafy trail to the left. 
Admire statues of George Sand, Stendhal, and Flaubert; bronze masks of Hugo and 
Balzac, and monuments to Baudelaire, Verlaine, and others. Henry James loved 
the gardens and wrote about them in The Ambassadors, as did Ernest Hemingway in 
A Moveable Feast, and William Faulkner in Sanctuary. Gertrude Stein and Alice B 
Toklas strolled in the gardens with their dog Basket.

Père Lachaise Cemetery 
The most moody, fascinating, wonderful place for walking is the Père Lachaise 
Cemetery. Old friends Molière and La Fontaine, Honoré de Balzac, Marcel Proust, 
Colette, and other French writers are buried here. Anglophones can visit Jim 
Morrison, Gertrude Stein, Alice B Toklas, Richard Wright, and the kiss-proofed 
tomb of Oscar Wilde. Pick up a map at the little door in the cemetery wall, 
just a few steps away from Père Lachaise Métro station.

Parc Monceau
Gustave Flaubert’s apartment fronted on to this delightful park of the chic 8th
 Arrondissement. Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette lived nearby as did Emile Zola’s 
literary creation, Nana. Guy de Maupassant’s statue stands in the park, as does 
Gustave Doré’s splendid statue of Alexandre Dumas. A statue of Alexandre Dumas
fils, the author of Camille, stands in the same square.
