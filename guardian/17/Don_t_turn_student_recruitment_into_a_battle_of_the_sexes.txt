Gender inequality is a complex issue in higher education. A recent report 
<http://www.hepi.ac.uk/2016/05/12/3317/> from the Higher Education Policy 
Institute (Hepi), however, risks oversimplifying it, stating that women get 
more out of university than men. It highlights the fact that, in January of 
this year, 94,000 more women had applied to university than men – and they are 
more likely to get first-class degrees and less likely to drop out.

While quantity of research is the name of the game, women are left on the 
sidelines

Sorana Vieru, the vice-president of the National Union of Students (NUS), 
highlighted the problem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/12/university-gender-gap-scandal-thinktank-men>
 earlier this month when she wrote that the report had turned the argument into 
“a battle of the sexes”.

The report suggests that action must be taken to address this situation. It 
states: “On current trends, the gap between rich and poor will be eclipsed by 
the gap between male and females.” I seriously doubt that any of us will live 
to see this eclipse.

Despite the fact that more women enter university than men, it is men who do 
better in the workplace in terms ofpay and promotion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/gender-pay-gap-has-barely-shrunk-in-four-years-say-mps>
. The report states that they are more likely than women to be employed or in 
education between the ages of 18 and 24, and are more likely to be employed 
full-time throughout their careers.

Women remain underrepresented in highly-paid industries such as engineering 
and finance, while taking the majority of roles in retail and childcare. Put 
simply: men do better than women in employment, with or without a university 
education.

But what happens to women who don’t have degrees? 


 * They are overrepresented in low-paid, insecure work. Four out of five of 
thosespending more than 10 years in low-paid work 
<http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Minimum-stay.pdf>
 are women. 
 * They lose out on apprenticeships. According to research we have carried out 
<http://www.youngwomenstrust.org/assets/0000/2906/Making_Apprenticeships_Work_for_Young_Women.pdf>
, they earn less, receive less training and are less likely to secure work at 
the end of an apprenticeship. 
 * They are more likely to be working part-time, but would like the 
opportunity to work more 
<http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/YWT_Young-Womens-Lives-Survey_October-2015_18-30s.pdf>
. 
 * They are less able to progress in the workplace 
<http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Non-grads.pdf> 
after having children. 
Women have far more to lose by not studying for a degree. This was confirmed 
in a recent report fromthe Resolution Foundation 
<http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Non-grads.pdf>, 
which found that, among those with five A*-C qualifications and no degree, 
women weremore likely to be economically inactive than men 
<http://www.youngwomenstrust.org/economicinactivity> (we’re about to begin a 
new study investigating the reasons for this).

I don’t doubt that there are also certain groups of young men whose long-term 
academic and financial prospects are strongly associated with their demography.

But please, let’s not blame women for the drop in the number of young men 
applying to university. I was very concerned to read Mary Curnock Cook’s 
foreword to the Hepi report, in which she proposes that “the dominance of women 
in the school workforce may play a role in boys’ underperformance relative to 
girls” – despite there being no evidence to support this idea.

In terms of gender equality, schools are no different from other 
organisations. Women are overrepresented at junior levels andunderrepresented 
in management and higher-paid roles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/feb/11/lack-of-female-headteachers-gender-diversity-education>
. What example does this set for young people of both genders?

 I agree completely with the imperative to create better gender balance across 
all spheres of life – but let’s not risk discouraging women even further as we 
work to achieve this.
