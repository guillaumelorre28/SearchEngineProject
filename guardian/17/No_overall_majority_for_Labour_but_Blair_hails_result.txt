Labour - 56 seats
 Tony Blair today hailed as "very good for us" election results which saw 
Labour denied an overall majority in the new Scottish Parliament, making the 
prospect of a coalition with the Liberal Democrats all but inevitable.
Mr Blair hailed the Scottish and Welsh results as a vindication of Labour's 
policy of devolution - and proof that most voters rejected separatism. "We have 
made devolution work and inScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> 
it's absolutely clear that the vast majority of people voted for parties that 
are opposed to the nationalist agenda of independence," he said.

Scottish National Party - 37 seats

Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond congratulated Donald Dewar on his 
success in the Scottish elections but promised that the SNP would be a creative 
and dynamic opposition. He said the SNP's performance was almost equal to the 
30% the party polled in the October 1974 general election, but this time it had 
the seats to match the votes.

"We have never in our party's 70-year history had more than 11 elected 
representatives. We are going to have more than three times that in the new 
parliament."

The SNP leader insisted that the independence campaign was not dead. He went 
on: "We do not have a mandate to hold an independence referendum but we will be 
a vital and dynamic opposition and seek that mandate at the first available 
opportunity... Being the opposition was not our goal in this campaign, we 
wanted to win. But oppositions have a habit of becoming governments."

Mr Salmond also dismissed suggestions that his leadership would be in 
question, saying: "I expect to lead the opposition in the new parliament."

Conservatives - 17 seats

Scottish Tory leader David McLetchie was finally confirmed as an MSP today, 
more than 17 hours after the election count began. Mr McLetchie said at the end 
of the long wait for his result: "I don't know if it's been a hard day's night 
or a hard night's day. It is a great honour for James Douglas-Hamilton and 
myself to be elected to represent the party.

"The Scottish Conservative and Unionist party is back. We are going to be the 
third force inScottish politics <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scotland>
."

Liberal Democrats - 17 seats

Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown warned Labour would be forced to make 
compromises in order to form a coalition in the Scottish parliament. "[Labour] 
are going to have to make compromises in what they do - that's called 
democracy," he said.

Liberal Democrat peer Lord Steel was also returned and is widely expected to 
be the first presiding officer, the parliament's speaker.

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace, the man hailed as king-maker in 
the Scottish parliament, was keeping his cards close to his chest as attention 
was focused on his coalition plans at Holyrood. Mr Wallace said he would not 
begin negotiations today but expected to do so in the next few days after 
consulting with his new MSP colleagues.

Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Wallace said his party would stick to its plan to 
first speak to the largest single party - which is Labour - but gave little 
away about his priority policies and Cabinet ambitions. He was jubilant about 
his party's election success in yesterday's polls, after many commentators had 
poured scorn on the Liberal Democrats' campaign and forecast a poor result.

Asked about coalition plans he said: "We are all minorities now... We always 
said we would stand by to talk to the party with the largest number of seats in 
the Scottish parliament to see if it is possible to set up a programme of 
government. "We have waited 300 years for this parliament, I think the voters 
have a bit more patience for two or three more days. We are not going to be 
rushed."

Greens - 1 seat

Green victor Robin Harper wept as he told jubilant supporters that today was 
an historic one. Clenching his fist and waving it in the air, Mr Harper was 
cheered as he pledged: "Today for Greens in the UK is an absolutely historic 
occasion.

"I'm the first Green! It's turning that way all across Europe. We don't have 
to be in power, we just have to be there to help things along.
