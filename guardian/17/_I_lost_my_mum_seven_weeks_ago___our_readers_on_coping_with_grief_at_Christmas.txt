Living with the loss of a loved one is always hard, but grief can feel more 
acute at certain times of the year. AtChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas>, for instance, when people 
come together, the absence of friends or family can be more keenly felt. So 
what are the best ways to cope?


We asked for our readers’ experiences. Here are their stories.

 ‘I lost my beloved mother seven weeks ago.’ 
Last year, my family and I spent Christmas Day in a hospital in Oxford, 
plating up a dinner for my mum and dad. We had paper hats and crackers. It was 
my mum’s first meal in four weeks. It was important to us, as we had spent the 
previous three months by her bedside waiting for a diagnosis. We learned that 
she had had central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, but they said the odds were 
good. That year we got the greatest gift ever: hope.


Fast forward to today, and it’s been seven weeks since I lost my beloved 
mother. The thought of Christmas this year has made me somewhat uneasy, though 
I know I must get through it for the sake of my children. I have been coping as 
best I can, getting on with everyday life. But while trying to untangle my 
Christmas tree lights recently the full weight of my loss came crashing down. I 
was overcome with emotion and it took me a few days to come back from a 
seemingly bottomless pit.


Christmas has amplified my grief. I’ve been made dizzy by the twinkling 
lights, festive songs and endless present-buying. The pressure to be happy has 
knocked me off my feet. Usually I can keep up with all the festive cheer, but 
this year I am not fit for the marathon.
The only advice I have been given is, “be kind to yourself”, “surround 
yourself with loved ones” and “let it out”. This is what people tell me on a 
daily basis. So with this in mind, I am heading up north to my in-laws. There 
is no doubt theirChristmas jumper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/dec/13/jingle-belles-10-of-the-best-christmas-jumpers>
 camaraderie will soften my woes. But I know that every moment I feel the 
slightest joy, I will see my mum’s face – and wonder if she, too, is sitting 
somewhere in a Christmas jumper missing me.

Maria O’Dwyer, 58 from Dublin: Every Christmas I remember my husband with my 
family. It helps me cope
 ‘My husband, Brian, passed away five years ago.’ 
My husband, Brian, passed away five years ago after suffering for seven years 
with multiple myeloma (a rare blood cancer). He was a gentle, witty, loving man.

Brian worked as a credit union manager and enjoyed his job. His passion from 
childhood, however, was flying: he got his pilot’s licence atBiggin Hill 
<http://www.bigginhillairport.com/> when he was 20, and flew small planes and 
gliders for years.

He had friends from all walks of life. We first met at Brian’s father’s 
wedding when his (widowed) father married my aunt. Brian was seven and I was 
five; we began dating 10 years later. Brian moved to London – but we kept in 
touch and met again and married in our 20s. We have one daughter.

We miss Brian every day, but Christmas is especially hard. Our families are 
connected because of his dad and my aunt. Brian was the centre of any party and 
always had his guitar close at hand. He was very musical. There is a huge hole 
in our lives now – and although people say time is a healer, in some ways I 
find it gets harder. As the years go by he seems further away.

Every year we meet Brian’s extended family for brunch on Christmas Eve – it’s 
a big family gathering. We talk about him and how much we all miss him. It 
brings him closer, even if it’s just for a few hours. It might sound flippant 
but I think it’s important to talk about the person you lost. Where possible 
stay in touch with mutual friends and share memories.

It’s easy to become isolated and cocooned at this time of year. Make a huge 
effort to meet people – and don’t be afraid to talk about your sadness and loss.

Kim Garcia, from New York: Christmas was the very last holiday we got to spend 
together as a family

I lost my 12-year-old son Brandon six years ago in a car accident. It’s never 
easy remembering the night he died, or even talking about it, but doing so has 
become part of my healing process.

 ‘Celebrate your loved one and remember that grieving doesn’t have a time 
frame.’ 
For the first couple of years it was very hard for me. I surrounded myself 
with family members, especially my two sons who survived the accident. You go 
through a stage of shock, where you try to come to terms with the fact that 
person is not coming back. I also went through a stage of fearing night-time, 
because that’s when the accident happened. I would stay up all night until I 
saw daylight.

I learned to cope by celebrating my son’s life; for instance, we mark his 
birthday every January. Christmas is the hardest time of year because it was 
the very last holiday we got to spend together as a family. I lost him in the 
summer. He was a happy boy who loved his family so much; I can still see his 
smiling face.

I celebrate his legacy by giving back to the community. He loved to help 
others and had a big heart. Once a year, on the anniversary of his death, I 
give away book bags and school supplies at his favourite book store to help 
families in our community in Dutchess County. And I try to offer love and 
compassion to other parents who have lost a child. I’ve become particularly 
close to another woman who lost a son. We support each other.

We also honour Brandon by wearing a T-shirt with his picture on it. My advice 
for anyone dealing with grief is allow God to be your strength. Celebrate your 
loved one and remember that grieving doesn’t have a time frame.

Bernard McGrath, 58 from Leeds: Life must go on, and the person you have lost 
would want you to carry on

My wife died unexpectedly on 12 November. She had not been ill. She had an 
epileptic fit during the night, which led to pulmonary aspiration. She stopped 
breathing and died.

 ‘My wife loved Christmas and also shopping for a large extended family.’ 
This will be the first Christmas my daughter and I will spend without her. 
People don’t know whether they should send cards; in some cases, they can’t 
bring themselves to say “Happy Christmas”. I know they are just trying to be 
kind, but they are being over-sensitive.

My wife loved Christmas, and loved shopping for our extended family. I now 
have to juggle coping without her and trying to provide some kind of normality 
for my daughter.

People who do not know Helen has died, naturally, still send cards addressed 
to all three of us. I find seeing all of our names on the envelope and card 
painful. The sense of loss will be most acute around Christmas Day. I used to 
stay up the night before with her until the early hours wrapping presents.


The best way to cope with grief is to talk about the person you have lost. Do 
not bottle up emotion. Be prepared for periods of normality, and then – out of 
the blue – intense emotion. Be fully aware that you will never truly get over 
your loss, there is no magic day of closure. Accept all and any support offered.

In time you will adjust. Ultimately, life goes on – and the person you have 
lost would want you to carry on.

Gillian, 33 from Lincoln: Every year I raise a glass to her while watching the 
Strictly Come Dancing special

I lost my big sister suddenly in October 2014. She had just had a coffee with 
our parents before getting into her car to drive home. She had a cardiac arrest 
before she even turned on the engine. About two months later we got a diagnosis 
ofarrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy 
<https://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/conditions/cardiomyopathy/arrhythmogenic-right-ventricular-cardiomyopathy>
 (ARVC). The same genetic heart condition that caused the footballer,Fabrice 
Muamba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/25/muamba-collapse-minute-by-minute>
, to collapse.

 Christmas is one of the hardest times of year, along with the anniversary of 
her death and her birthday. To have someone missing during the festive period 
is painful. We can all be sitting around together and I will find myself 
waiting for the doorbell to ring and for her to come in. For a long time her 
death didn’t feel real. That is a very common reaction when you lose somebody 
suddenly and unexpectedly.

 Every year at Christmas I raise a glass to her while watching the Strictly 
Come Dancing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/19/ore-oduba-winning-strictly-come-dancing-was-most-unexpected>
 special. We would never agree on our favourites. I know that she would’ve 
hated Ed Balls, but I loved him. I can hear her commenting on the smugness of 
certain contestants. That may sound silly, but thinking about this helps. She 
loved the show.


It’s OK to be sad; pretending otherwise is pointless. It helps to speak about 
the one you lost, even if it is painful. It’s also good to try to find beauty 
in music, church, family, charity – wherever you can.

It will always be sad and tragic, but the more you bring the person you lost 
into Christmas, the easier it gets over time.
