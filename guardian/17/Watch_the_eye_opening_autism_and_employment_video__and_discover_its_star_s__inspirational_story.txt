When Max Green, a 19-year-old IT desktop analyst, won west Berkshire’s 2016 
Apprentice of the Year award, he was both delighted and, he admits, surprised.


Just two years earlier he had left school convinced he was unemployable. “I 
have autism. I had no qualifications. On paper I had nothing to offer. I was 
very worried about the future,” recalls Max, the star of a new National 
Autistic Society film highlighting the difficulties facing those on the autism 
spectrum when looking for or staying in work.

Breaking down the barriers to employment for autistic people

Max knew from a school work-experience placement that he wanted to work in IT 
– and that he could do the job – but he believed his autism would prove a 
barrier. The effect on his self-esteem was terrible. “I felt worthless.”

Max’s first interviews only served to compound his fears. Being in an unknown 
place, surrounded by noise and bustle, facing new people and fielding a series 
of questions, is particularly intimidating for those on the autism spectrum who 
can be extra-sensitive to receiving too much information, he explains. “Despite 
being passionate about the subject, I always forgot everything I wanted to say. 
It always went terribly.”

So when Max spotted an advertisement for an apprenticeship with the Sovereign 
Housing Association in Newbury, he applied with low expectations of success.

“They must just have seen something in me, the determination perhaps,” he 
says, as he describes his delight at eventually being offered the post.

Fortunately this interview panel recognised Max’s discomfort and was unphased 
by the fact that he was wearing a colourful checked shirt while the other 
candidates were in suits. They worked hard to help him showcase his skills, for 
instance looking at notes he had made during his work experience and asking him 
to explain specific points.

You Stand the Rejection? 
Max is delighted that this support has continued ever since. He is able to 
take breaks outside when he feels his stress level rising. He also knows he can 
talk to his boss privately, should he have any worries.

“Knowing where to turn when I’m not sure how I should react to something is so 
reassuring,” he explains. Learning the unwritten social rules of the workplace 
– often so baffling to those on the autism spectrum – and getting to grips with 
“office banter” are challenging. “People sometimes have to tell me when it’s a 
joke, but I’m getting much better at it,” says Max.

A series of small changes have helped alleviate some of the sensory issues, 
which initially worried Max. He has adjusted his hours to avoid travelling on 
crowded peak-time buses – a previous source of anxiety – and chooses to wear 
his telephone headset at all times, to reduce noise.

Max and his boss discussed whether they should disclose his autism to 
colleagues. “There are positives and negatives both ways, but I wanted people 
to get to know me just as me first. I tell people who ask or who I feel will 
offer support, but I don’t want people prejudging me or treading on eggshells.”

Two years on, and with his apprenticeship now converted into a fulltime role, 
Max feels very much at home.

“It feels like a family. I love the fact that most people are aware, that 
there is so much support, but that they don’t treat me differently. I can do 
the job just as well as anyone else – if not better!”

Max is joking, but he does believe that some of his success is because of, 
rather than in spite of, his autism. An unusually good memory, attention to 
detail and an ability to think in unusual ways in the face of problems are all 
helpful.

Having felt isolated at school, he particularly enjoys the opportunity to 
interact with customers in a structured way. “I love helping people and I 
understand that things can be difficult so I am very empathetic,” he says. 
“They respond very well to that.”

Alongside his IT job, Max is also a keen part-time actor. “In a way I’ve had 
to act my entire life, learning to fit in, so I’m quite good at it,” he says. 
While Max has several TV credits – and the new National Autistic Society film, 
which shows what a job interview looks like from an autistic person’s point of 
view – he has also notched up over 1,000 rejection emails. They only fuel a 
determination he hopes others on the spectrum can share.


“It’s such a waste of talent if we don’t all do what we’re capable of,” he 
says. “We need to help everyone to thrive. We are dealt our cards in life, but 
it is what we do with them that makes us who we are.”

decisive action to double the number of autistic people in work.
