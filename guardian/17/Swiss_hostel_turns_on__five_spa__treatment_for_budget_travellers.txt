A youth hostel fitted out with jacuzzis, herbal steam baths and hydromassage 
facilities has opened in a Swiss alpine village, declaring itself the first 
“wellness hostel” in the world.

WellnessHostel 4000, in the glacier village of Saas-Fee in the canton of 
Valais, still offers the traditional hostel features of dormitories, bunk beds 
and shared showers. But typical forms of entertainment – shared TVs and poorly 
stocked bars – have been replaced by hot tubs and a tapas bar.

Manager Denise Emmerich said: “We have been open for just over two weeks and 
have seen a mix of guests through our doors, such as ski teams, older people, 
as well as groups of young people who are more or less looking for cheap 
accommodation.

“When you go to a hostel you expect it – how can I say it? – to not be 
anything like a hotel. But we have fitness and wellness facilities, a swimming 
pool, as well as a pool table and ping pong table.”

Other facilities include a Finnish sauna, hydromassage showers and an 
extensive massage programme.

“It is quite a relaxing place,” Emmerich said. “We have the mountain views and 
it is a quiet location. You have access to the sports and skiing in the 
mountains but also to calm – also helped by the fact that Saas-Fee is a 
car-free village.”

Prices for beds start at around 50 francs (£30), offering a cheaper 
alternative to the nearby resorts of Verbier and St Moritz that, according to 
2012 research, are the second and third most expensive ski destinations for 
Brits.

The wellnessHostel 4000 <http:> is part of a growing trend of upmarket 
hostels, from converted monasteries to “flashpacker pads” with rooms that 
wouldn’t look out of place in a boutique hotel.
