A master’s dissertation: your chance to take your creativity, know-how and 
essay-writing brilliance to a higher level. And for postgrad students the 
frenzy is reaching a peak as hand-in day approaches.

We want to know how you’ve been finding the last couple of months of the 
course. Do you have an unforeseen mountain to climb or do you have it all 
mapped out? How are you and your coursemates coping with the pressure and the 
long library stints? Do you have any stress-busting tips for other students?

We’d like to see photos of your workspace too – is it a model of neatness and 
organisation or a quivering mess of papers and pizza boxes?
