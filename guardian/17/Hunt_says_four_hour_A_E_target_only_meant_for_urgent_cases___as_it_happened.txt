Afternoon summary

 * Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has told MPs that up to 30% of people 
using A&E departments do not need emergency care and that he would like some of 
them to be directed elsewhere.In a statement to MPs, he also said the four-hour 
A&E target was only supposed to apply to genuine emergencies - not to people 
using A&E unnecessary. (See 4.45pm.)

 He said that, to help some hospitals cope with the current demand, some 
non-urgent operations may be cancelled and GPs released for urgent care work.

Responding to him for Labour, the shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth 
said: 
I know La La Land did well at the Golden Globes last night - I didn’t realise 
the secretary of state was living there. Perhaps that’s where he has been all 
weekend. Can he now confirm that theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> is facing a winter crisis and the 
blame for this lies at the door of No10 Downing Street? Does the secretary of 
state agree it was a monumental error to ignore the pleas for extra support for 
social care in the autumn statement a few weeks ago? Will he now support calls 
to bring forward the extra £700m allocated for 2019? Will he bring that forward 
now to help social care?

 * Theresa May has suggested the media are responsible for a slump in the 
value of the pound by wrongly claiming her views about Britain leaving the EU 
equate to a hard Brexit. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/09/theresa-may-media-is-misrepresenting-my-brexit-views>
 * Martin McGuinness, Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, is to resign 
from office in protest over his power-sharing partner’s handling of a bungled 
green energy scheme. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/09/martin-mcguinness-to-resign-as-northern-ireland-deputy-first-minister>
 * Members of Italy’s populist Five Star Movement (M5S) have voted 
overwhelmingly to cut ties with Nigel Farage and his MEPs in the European 
parliament, in favour of joining the pro-EU liberal group. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/09/five-star-movement-nigel-farage-meps-m5s-alde>
 * Sir Oliver Heald, the justice minister, has told MPs that the government is 
“determined” to ban perpetrators of domestic abuse from cross-examining their 
victims in the family courts. He said: 
The lord chancellor has requested urgent advice on how to put an end to this 
practice. This sort of cross-examination is illegal in the criminal courts, and 
I’m determined to see it banned in family courts too.

 * Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Treasury 
committee, has urged Theresa May to clarify her Brexit plans, particularly in 
relation to the single market, the customs union and a transitional plan.In a 
speech to a City dinner tonight he will say: 
The prime minister rightly talked about securing a deal with the EU that 
commanded the support of both leave and remain voters. That matters a lot. 
There is almost certainly a majority in the country – and a cross-party 
majority in parliament – for a continued close economic and political 
relationship with the EU from outside. Safeguarding the economic wellbeing of 
the country probably requires a relationship that is considerably deeper than 
that provided for under WTO rules.

Given the need to build a broad-based support for its position, at home and 
abroad, the sooner the government can provide clarity, the better.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Hunt says operations may be cancelled in some areas to reduce pressure on A&E 
departments

And this is what Hunt said in his statement about the emergency measures that 
may be taken in some areas to relieve pressure on A&E departments.

As of this weekend, there are signs that pressure is easing both in the most 
distressed trusts and across the system. However with further cold weather on 
the way this weekend and a spike in respiratory infections there will be 
further challenges ahead.

NHS England and NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> Improvement will 
also consider a series of further measures which may be taken in particularly 
distressed systems on a temporary basis at the discretion of the local clinical 
leaders. These may include:

temporarily releasing time for GPs to support urgent care work by extending 
the QOF [quality and outcomes framework] reporting period to the end of April

clinically triaging non-urgent calls to the ambulance service for residents of 
nursing and residential home before they are taken to hospital;

continuing to suspend elective care, including, where appropriate, suspension 
of non-urgent outpatient appointments;

working with the CQC [Care Quality Commission] on rapid re-inspection where 
this has the potential to re-open community health and social care bed capacity;

working with community trusts and community nursing teams to speed up 
discharge.

urgent care work to reduce pressure on A&E departments. Facebook

Hunt says up to 30% of A&E cases aren't emergencies and should be directed 
elsewhere

This is what Jeremy Hunt <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt> 
said about excluding non-urgent cases from the four-hour A&E target.

However, looking to the future, it is clear that we need to have an honest 
discussion with the public about the purpose of A&E departments. There is 
nowhere outside the UK that commits to all patients that we will sort out any 
health need within four hours. Only four other countries, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Australia and Canada, have similar national standards which are generally less 
stringent than ours.

This government is committed to maintaining and delivering that vital 
four-hour commitment to patients. But since it was announced in 2000 there are 
nearly 9m more visits to our A&Es, up to 30% of whomNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> England estimate do not need to be 
there. And the tide is continuing to rise.

So, if we are to protect our four-hour standard, we need to be clear it is a 
promise to sort out all urgent health problems within four hours, but not all 
health problems, however minor.

As Prof Keith Willett, NHS England’s medical director for acute care has said, 
no country in the world has a standard for all health problems, however small, 
and if we are to protect services for the most vulnerable, nor can we.

So NHS England and NHS Improvement will continue to explore ways to ensure 
that at least some of the patients who do not need to be in our A&Es can be 
given good alternative options, building on progress under way with the 
streaming policy in the NHS England A&E plan. This way we will be able to 
improve the patient experience for those with more minor conditions who are 
currently not seen within four hours, as well as protect the four-hour promise 
for those who actually need it.

 * Hunt signals he wants to direct non-urgent cases away from A&E. 
 * He says up to 30% of A&E cases are not emergencies. 
 * He says four-hour A&E waiting target only meant to apply to urgent cases.

Hunt says the government must have an honest conversation with the public 
about A&E.

No other country has such high A&E standards.

But there are 9m more visits to A&E since the 4-hour time standard was set.

It is estimated that 30% of visits to A&E are not emergencies, he says.

He says the NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> will continue to 
explore ways of diverting people from A&E.

This will improve the patient experience for people who do not need emergency 
treatement.

Hunt starts by paying tribute to NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> 
staff. They have never worked harder, he says.

He says NHS planning for the winter has been better than ever before.

As a result on some days NHS A&E departments have treated a record number of 
people within four hours.

But in some trusts the situation has been “extremely fragile”.

He says diverts and trolley waits are particular problems in certain trusts.

As of this weekend there are some signs pressure is easing.

But, with further cold weather coming this weekend, there will be further 
challenges ahead.

So some measures may be taken in some areas, including releasing GPs for A&E 
work, triaging the elderly before they are taken to hospital and working to 
speed up discharges.

These actions will allow the NHS to take further measures when necessary.

morning. He even includes a reference to the “shared society”.

On the NHS generally, he says demand was “unprecedented” after Christmas.

He will set out how the government intends to protect the NHS

Merkel says limits will be imposed on UK's access to single market if it does 
not accept free movement

Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has reaffirmed her belief that, if 
Britain does not accept free movement of EU citizens, it will not be able to 
keep full access to the single market after Brexit. Speaking to civil servants 
in Cologne she said:

Access to the single market can only be possible on the condition of 
respecting the four basic freedoms. Otherwise one has to talk about limits.

The Ulster Unionists have accused Sinn Féin of letting Arlene Foster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/arlene-foster> off the hook. This is from 
the UUP leaderMike Nesbitt.

Sinn Féin should have stayed, to hold the first minister to account, to force 
a public inquiry and to vote on the much-needed cost controls on the scheme.

Instead, they have prioritised self-interest, as always. This is Sinn Fein 
letting the DUP off the hook. The public mood clearly indicates they want the 
facts of the RHI debacle exposed. To move straight to an election without this 
taking place is farcical. They had a choice between the integrity of the 
institutions and electoral advantage and they appear to have chosen the latter.

Q&A on the Stormont crisis

Henry McDonald

Q: Why has nearly 10 years of power sharing between the old foes of Sinn Féin 
and the Democratic Unionist party been imperilled?

The irony about of this crisis is not that it centres not on traditional 
issues of dispute such as the constitutional status ofNorthern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> or even how the power-sharing 
government deals with the legacy of the Troubles and nearly 4,000 deaths. It 
has come crashing down due to a ‘cash for ash’ scandal.

Q: What is ‘cash for ash’?

In 2012 the DUP devised a green energy scheme called the Renewable Heating 
Initiative which was mean to encourage non-domestic consumers to use green 
energy such as wood pellets to heat farms, businesses and other enterprises.


Q: Why was it such a disaster?


The scheme offered £1.60 for every £1 spent by farmers and other non-domestic 
users if they signed up for the green initiative. It soon became apparent that 
there had been a massive miscalculation of the cost of the scheme, which some 
estimates now reckon will cost the taxpayer close to £500m in lost revenue.

Q: Why did it cause such a political furore?

Opposition parties ranging from the Ulster Unionists to Sinn Féin’s 
nationalist rivals in the SDLP called for an independent inquiry into the 
fiasco and for first ministerArlene Foster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/arlene-foster> to stand down temporarily 
while it was held. Sinn Féin, the DUP’s sole partner in coalition government, 
came under intense pressure to act.

Q: Will an election clear the air?


If past results are replicated the DUP and Sinn Fein will still end up as the 
two largest parties but the game-changer would be if the republican party was 
larger than its unionist rival. In that case a Sinn Féin assembly member could 
be elected for the first time as first minister as the DUP may ship votes and 
lose seats to their Ulster Unionist competitors.

Q: Will an election naturally lead to a new power-sharing/cross-community 
government

Not necessarily, given the bitterness that now exists between Sinn Féin and 
the DUP. It may take a long series of post-election negotiations to rebuild 
trust and recast a new coalition government, which inevitably will involve the 
two largest parties.


Q: Will a collapse of power-sharing and a fresh election destabilise the peace 
in Northern Ireland?


While dissident republicans will rejoice, hoping to inflict some damage at the 
ballot box to Sinn Féin and claiming the dysfunctional relationship between 
Sinn Féin and the DUP proves Northern Ireland is a failed state, this crisis 
will not fatally undermine the peace process. The overwhelming majority of 
people on all sides in Northern Ireland support the peace settlement and do not 
want a resumption of Troubles-style 24/7 violence.

 * Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has told MPs that up to 30% of people 
using A&E departments do not need emergency care and that he would like some of 
them to be directed elsewhere.In a statement to MPs, he also said the four-hour 
A&E target was only supposed to apply to genuine emergencies - not to people 
using A&E unnecessary. (See 4.45pm.)

Responding to him for Labour, the shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth 
said: 
I know La La Land did well at the Golden Globes last night - I didn’t realise 
the secretary of state was living there. Perhaps that’s where he has been all 
weekend. Can he now confirm that theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> is facing a winter crisis and the 
blame for this lies at the door of No10 Downing Street? Does the secretary of 
state agree it was a monumental error to ignore the pleas for extra support for 
social care in the autumn statement a few weeks ago? Will he now support calls 
to bring forward the extra £700m allocated for 2019? Will he bring that forward 
now to help social care?

 * Sir Oliver Heald, the justice minister, has told MPs that the government is 
“determined” to ban perpetrators of domestic abuse from cross-examining their 
victims in the family courts. He said: 
The lord chancellor has requested urgent advice on how to put an end to this 
practice. This sort of cross-examination is illegal in the criminal courts, and 
I’m determined to see it banned in family courts too.

 * Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Treasury 
committee, has urged Theresa May to clarify her Brexit plans, particularly in 
relation to the single market, the customs union and a transitional plan.In a 
speech to a City dinner tonight he will say: 
The prime minister rightly talked about securing a deal with the EU that 
commanded the support of both leave and remain voters. That matters a lot. 
There is almost certainly a majority in the country – and a cross-party 
majority in parliament – for a continued close economic and political 
relationship with the EU from outside. Safeguarding the economic wellbeing of 
the country probably requires a relationship that is considerably deeper than 
that provided for under WTO rules.

Given the need to build a broad-based support for its position, at home and 
abroad, the sooner the government can provide clarity, the better.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

 were not intended to mean that it is being watered down. It is not. He was 
making the point that the target was only supposed to apply to people in A&E in 
a real emergency. This is from Huffington Post’sPaul Waugh.

<https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/818499238250315777>  
And this is what Hunt said in his statement about the emergency measures that 
may be taken in some areas to relieve pressure on A&E departments.

As of this weekend, there are signs that pressure is easing both in the most 
distressed trusts and across the system. However with further cold weather on 
the way this weekend and a spike in respiratory infections there will be 
further challenges ahead.

NHS England and NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> Improvement will 
also consider a series of further measures which may be taken in particularly 
distressed systems on a temporary basis at the discretion of the local clinical 
leaders. These may include:

temporarily releasing time for GPs to support urgent care work by extending 
the QOF [quality and outcomes framework] reporting period to the end of April

clinically triaging non-urgent calls to the ambulance service for residents of 
nursing and residential home before they are taken to hospital;

continuing to suspend elective care, including, where appropriate, suspension 
of non-urgent outpatient appointments;

working with the CQC [Care Quality Commission] on rapid re-inspection where 
this has the potential to re-open community health and social care bed capacity;

working with community trusts and community nursing teams to speed up 
discharge.

 * Hunt says operations may be cancelled in some areas and GPs released for 
urgent care work to reduce pressure on A&E departments.  
This is what Jeremy Hunt <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt> 
said about excluding non-urgent cases from the four-hour A&E target.

However, looking to the future, it is clear that we need to have an honest 
discussion with the public about the purpose of A&E departments. There is 
nowhere outside the UK that commits to all patients that we will sort out any 
health need within four hours. Only four other countries, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Australia and Canada, have similar national standards which are generally less 
stringent than ours.

This government is committed to maintaining and delivering that vital 
four-hour commitment to patients. But since it was announced in 2000 there are 
nearly 9m more visits to our A&Es, up to 30% of whomNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> England estimate do not need to be 
there. And the tide is continuing to rise.

So, if we are to protect our four-hour standard, we need to be clear it is a 
promise to sort out all urgent health problems within four hours, but not all 
health problems, however minor.

As Prof Keith Willett, NHS England’s medical director for acute care has said, 
no country in the world has a standard for all health problems, however small, 
and if we are to protect services for the most vulnerable, nor can we.

So NHS England and NHS Improvement will continue to explore ways to ensure 
that at least some of the patients who do not need to be in our A&Es can be 
given good alternative options, building on progress under way with the 
streaming policy in the NHS England A&E plan. This way we will be able to 
improve the patient experience for those with more minor conditions who are 
currently not seen within four hours, as well as protect the four-hour promise 
for those who actually need it.

 * Hunt signals he wants to direct non-urgent cases away from A&E. 
 * He says up to 30% of A&E cases are not emergencies. 
 * He says four-hour A&E waiting target only meant to apply to urgent cases.  
Hunt says the government must have an honest conversation with the public 
about A&E.

No other country has such high A&E standards.

But there are 9m more visits to A&E since the 4-hour time standard was set.

It is estimated that 30% of visits to A&E are not emergencies, he says.

He says the NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> will continue to 
explore ways of diverting people from A&E.

This will improve the patient experience for people who do not need emergency 
treatement.
 
Hunt starts by paying tribute to NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> 
staff. They have never worked harder, he says.

He says NHS planning for the winter has been better than ever before.

As a result on some days NHS A&E departments have treated a record number of 
people within four hours.

But in some trusts the situation has been “extremely fragile”.

He says diverts and trolley waits are particular problems in certain trusts.

As of this weekend there are some signs pressure is easing.

But, with further cold weather coming this weekend, there will be further 
challenges ahead.

So some measures may be taken in some areas, including releasing GPs for A&E 
work, triaging the elderly before they are taken to hospital and working to 
speed up discharges.

These actions will allow the NHS to take further measures when necessary.

Access to the single market can only be possible on the condition of 
respecting the four basic freedoms. Otherwise one has to talk about limits.

The Ulster Unionists have accused Sinn Féin of letting Arlene Foster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/arlene-foster> off the hook. This is from 
the UUP leaderMike Nesbitt.

Sinn Féin should have stayed, to hold the first minister to account, to force 
a public inquiry and to vote on the much-needed cost controls on the scheme.

Instead, they have prioritised self-interest, as always. This is Sinn Fein 
letting the DUP off the hook. The public mood clearly indicates they want the 
facts of the RHI debacle exposed. To move straight to an election without this 
taking place is farcical. They had a choice between the integrity of the 
institutions and electoral advantage and they appear to have chosen the latter.

Q: Why has nearly 10 years of power sharing between the old foes of Sinn Féin 
and the Democratic Unionist party been imperilled?

The irony about of this crisis is not that it centres not on traditional 
issues of dispute such as the constitutional status ofNorthern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> or even how the power-sharing 
government deals with the legacy of the Troubles and nearly 4,000 deaths. It 
has come crashing down due to a ‘cash for ash’ scandal.

Q: What is ‘cash for ash’?

In 2012 the DUP devised a green energy scheme called the Renewable Heating 
Initiative which was mean to encourage non-domestic consumers to use green 
energy such as wood pellets to heat farms, businesses and other enterprises.


Q: Why was it such a disaster?


The scheme offered £1.60 for every £1 spent by farmers and other non-domestic 
users if they signed up for the green initiative. It soon became apparent that 
there had been a massive miscalculation of the cost of the scheme, which some 
estimates now reckon will cost the taxpayer close to £500m in lost revenue.

Q: Why did it cause such a political furore?

Opposition parties ranging from the Ulster Unionists to Sinn Féin’s 
nationalist rivals in the SDLP called for an independent inquiry into the 
fiasco and for first ministerArlene Foster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/arlene-foster> to stand down temporarily 
while it was held. Sinn Féin, the DUP’s sole partner in coalition government, 
came under intense pressure to act.

Q: Will an election clear the air?


If past results are replicated the DUP and Sinn Fein will still end up as the 
two largest parties but the game-changer would be if the republican party was 
larger than its unionist rival. In that case a Sinn Féin assembly member could 
be elected for the first time as first minister as the DUP may ship votes and 
lose seats to their Ulster Unionist competitors.

Q: Will an election naturally lead to a new power-sharing/cross-community 
government

Not necessarily, given the bitterness that now exists between Sinn Féin and 
the DUP. It may take a long series of post-election negotiations to rebuild 
trust and recast a new coalition government, which inevitably will involve the 
two largest parties.


Q: Will a collapse of power-sharing and a fresh election destabilise the peace 
in Northern Ireland?


While dissident republicans will rejoice, hoping to inflict some damage at the 
ballot box to Sinn Féin and claiming the dysfunctional relationship between 
Sinn Féin and the DUP proves Northern Ireland is a failed state, this crisis 
will not fatally undermine the peace process. The overwhelming majority of 
people on all sides in Northern Ireland support the peace settlement and do not 
want a resumption of Troubles-style 24/7 violence.
