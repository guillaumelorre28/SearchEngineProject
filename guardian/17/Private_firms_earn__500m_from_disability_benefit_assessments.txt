Two private firms have earned more than £500m in taxpayers’ money for carrying 
out controversial disability benefit assessments.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) paid Atos and Capita £507m for 
personal independence payment (PIP) tests between 2013 and 2016, despite fierce 
criticism of their services by MPs.

Figures up until September this year reported by the Daily Mirror suggest that 
61% of the 90,000 claimants who appealed against a PIP decision by the DWP, 
based on these companies’ assessments, won their case at tribunal. The DWP said 
it was unsure where this figure came from.

Hundreds have complained, many via the Guardian, that their benefits have been 
cut since PIP replaced the disability living allowance (DLA) in April 2013.

The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, queried how Atos and Capita could 
have been paid such huge sums. “This adds to the suspicion that these companies 
are just driven by a profit motive, and the incentive is to get the assessments 
done, but not necessarily to get the assessments right,” he told the Daily 
Mirror. “They are the ugly face of business.”

Figures show that the DWP paid Atos and Capita £7m in 2013, £91m in 2014, 
£198m in 2015, and £211m during the first 11 months of 2016.

A total of £382m was paid to the IT services firm Atos, a European IT services 
firm with headquarters in Paris, and £125m to London-based FTSE 100 company 
Capita.

The Guardian revealed in March that the government was  to review all of 
Atos’s major contracts from Whitehall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/06/government-to-review-500m-worth-of-atos-contracts-after-it-failure>
, which amount to more than £500m, following a serious IT failure. The Cabinet 
Office review found they were performing “within the normal parameters of large 
technology contracts” and that Atos provided an appropriate level of 
professional support.

After the PIP system was introduced, under 65-year-olds had to be reassessed 
and, up until October 2016, 110,000 out of 526,000 claimants who were 
reassessed lost their benefits.

MPs criticised Atos in a report by the public accounts committee in March, 
saying “it did not show an appropriate duty of care to the taxpayer” and 
questioned why the cost of one type of assessment had risen from £115 to £190. 
Capita divisional managing director Chris Stroud apologised for a poor quality 
service in front of the committee in February.

George Osborne announced a £4.4bn cut 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/22/george-osborne-refuses-to-apologise-for-disability-benefits-cut-plan>
 to benefits for the disabled in March over the course of parliament. The cuts 
were later shelved after the then work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith
resigned in protest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/18/iain-duncan-smith-resigns-from-cabinet-over-disability-cuts>
.

Theresa May’s administration has back-pedalled further on disability tests, 
with the work and pensions secretary, Damian Green, revealing in October that 
chronically sick people claiming employment and support allowancewould no 
longer have to prove every six months 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/01/dwp-scraps-retesting-for-chronically-ill-sickness-benefits-claimants>
 that they were still ill.

A DWP spokesman said: “We introduced PIP to replace the outdated DLA system 
and, as we invite more people to claim PIP, claims have been steadily 
increasing quarter on quarter since summer 2015. Payments to our providers 
reflect the amount of work they do for us.”

An Atos spokesman said: “The Atos team undertake PIP assessments on behalf of 
the DWP and do not take a decision on a person’s eligibility for PIP; that 
decision can only be taken by the DWP. Each assessment is carried out under the 
guidelines delivered by the DWP.”

Atos and DWP refused to comment when asked why so many appeals to PIP results 
were succeeding.

A Capita spokesperson said: “Capita carries out PIP assessments according to 
DWP guidelines and professional codes of conduct.”

• This article was amended on 27 December 2016. An earlier version described 
the assessments as being for “work capability” or “fit for work”. Atos and 
Capita carry out personal independence payment assessments, not fit-for-work 
tests. The article was also updated to give the findings of a Cabinet Office 
review of Atos’s major contracts from Whitehall.
