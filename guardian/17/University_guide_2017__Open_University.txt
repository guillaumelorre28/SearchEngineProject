Fees Fees vary. The cost of full time OU study (120 credits) works out at 
£5,572 per year in 2016-17. Modules cost £1,393 (30 credits) or £2,786 (60 
credits). Most OU students study 60 credits a year over six years for an 
honours degree.

Financial support If you’re on benefits or your income is less than £25,000, 
you may be eligible for a free introductory access module to build your 
confidence and skills before moving on to a full OU course. Once you’ve 
registered, you may be able to get help with study-related costs like travel, 
childcare and internet access. Figures quoted are for the year 2016.

The disabled students’ allowance (DSA) is a government grant to cover study 
support costs if you have a disability. It’s not means tested, and there’s no 
age limit.
