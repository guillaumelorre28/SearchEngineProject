 as part of an effort to improve the security of the region, Polish and US 
defense officials said on Wednesday.

The Polish defense minister, Antoni Macierewicz, made the announcement 
following talks with the commander of US land troops inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, Lt Gen Ben Hodges, in Żagań, 
western Poland. An armored brigade combat team from Fort Carson, Colorado, will 
be deployed there early next month, while another US force, a battalion, will 
be deployed on 1 April to Orzysz, in the north-east.

Hodges said the troops would arrive in the German port of Bremerhaven on 6 
January and would be immediately deployed toPoland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland>, the Baltic states and Romania. 
Their transfer would be timed and treated as a test of “how fast the force can 
move from port to field”, he said.

“I’m confident in the very powerful signal, the message it will send [that] 
the United States, along with the rest of Nato, is committed to deterrence,” 
Hodges said.

He said the armored brigade had already moved out of its Colorado base and was 
loading on ships.

“I’m excited about what my country is doing and I’m excited about continuing 
to work with our ally, Poland,” Hodges said.

In a separate decision, the members of Nato at a July summit in Warsaw 
approved the deployment of four multinational battalions to Poland and the 
Baltic states to deter Russia. Germany will lead a multinational battalion in 
Lithuania, with similar battalions to be led by the US in Poland, Britain in 
Estonia andCanada <https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada> in Latvia.

Poland and the Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have been 
uneasy about increased Russian military operations in the region, especially 
after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and have requested US 
and Nato troops on their soil as a deterrent. The alliance and the US insist 
the troop presence is not aimed against anyone, but Russia has threatened 
measures in response.

The US troops had previously been expected in mid- or late January.

“I am very happy that a decision has been taken by the US side for an earlier 
deployment,” Macierewicz said.

He did not say if the accelerated timetable was due to the 20 January 
inauguration of Donald Trump as US president. Trump has suggested he would like 
Europe to rely less on the US for its defense.
