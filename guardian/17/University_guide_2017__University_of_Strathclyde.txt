Fees £1,820 for full-time Scottish students. 


For other UK undergraduate students, the annual tuition fees will be £9,000 
for 2016-17. The cost will be capped at £27,000 for a four-year bachelor 
honours degree.

 If you are a first degree student and ordinarily resident in Scotland, you 
are eligible for your tuition fees to be covered by the Scottish government. If 
you are from elsewhere in the EU you are entitled to be charged the same level 
of tuition fees as Scottish students.


Bursaries/Scholarships The university offers a wide range of scholarships and 
bursaries to students which can be accessed via a search facility at
strath.ac.uk/scholarships <http://www.strath.ac.uk/studywithus/scholarships/>.

 The University offers a package of scholarship and bursary support to 
students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland, including an access bursary 
(rates advertised are for 2016-17, subject to change for 2017/18) for students 
from lower income families. A Strathclyde excellence award for highly qualified 
entrants and support with accommodation costs is also offered.

Accommodation Accommodation is guaranteed for first-year students who live 25 
miles from the city centre. 1,440 students live in the university’s campus 
village in the heart of Glasgow’s city centre; another 300 live a few minutes’ 
walk away. Prices range from £99 a week for a basic room in a shared flat to 
£133 a week for an ensuite room.
