Police are searching for a vandal who damaged two fossilised dinosaur 
footprints by pouring plaster into them.

The footprints, thought to be about 165m years old, are a tourist attraction 
at Staffin beach on Skye.

Police want to speak to a man in a camper van in connection with the 
vandalism, which took place on Wednesday.

A Police Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> spokesman said: 
“It has been reported to police that plaster-cast appears to have been poured 
into two of the fossilised dinosaur footprints on the beach, which has resulted 
in damage.

“Police would like to speak to a man believed to be aged in his late 40s to 
early 50s, of stocky build and approximately 6ft 1in to 6ft 2ins. It is 
believed he travelled in a white Hymer camper van.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101 or 
Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
