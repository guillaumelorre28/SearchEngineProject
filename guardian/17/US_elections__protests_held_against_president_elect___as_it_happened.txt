Summary

Claire Phipps

Politics as (un)unusual

 * Barack Obama will host president-elect Donald Trump at the Oval Office on 
Thursday. The two will meet at the White House at 11am ET, as will (separately) 
the current and future first ladies, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump. 
 * Hillary Clinton looks set to become the second nominee (hi, Al Gore!) to 
win the popular vote yet lose the electoral college 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/hillary-clinton-popular-vote-electoral-college-donald-trump>
 in the past five presidential elections. 
 * And Bernie Sanders has issued a statement about Trump’s win: 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> tapped into the 
anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment 
economics, establishment politics and the establishment media.


People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent 
paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not 
paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college 
education for their kids – all while the rich become very much richer.

To the degree that Mr Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve 
the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are 
prepared to work with him.

To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment 
policies, we will vigorously oppose him.

Protests in US cities

 * There were peaceful demonstrations on Wednesday night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/anti-donald-trump-protests-new-york-chicago-san-francisco>
 against the Trump victory and the rhetoric employed by the now president-elect 
during the campaign. Most protesters dispersed in the early hours of Thursday.

 * In New York city, several thousand people marched from Union Square to 
Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, blocking streets and prompting police to assemble 
hasty barricades. At least four arrests were made when marchers were moved on 
to Trump International Hotel and Tower on Central Park West. 
 * In downtown Chicago, several thousand people marched to that city’s Trump 
Tower, chanting “Not my president!” and “Our bodies, our choice!”. 
 * Thousands of demonstrators were also reported in Boston, heading from 
Boston Common to the Massachusetts statehouse. 
 * Other demonstrations have been taking place in Philadelphia, San Francisco, 
Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Portland and Washington DC, where a crowd massed 
outside a newly opened Trump hotel and others gathered outside the White House. 
 * Smaller marches were reported in St Paul, Minnesota; Richmond, Virginia; 
Kansas City; Omaha, Nebraska; and Austin, Texas. 
Globally

 * Asia-Pacific markets staged a huge recovery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/10/markets-rebound-investors-welcome-trump-plans-us-election-live>
 after an election day wobble, as the region followed the lead of the US and 
Europe. 
 * There has been a rush of interest from Americans in emigrating to New 
Zealand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/10/move-to-new-zealand-us-migration-inquiries-rise-24-fold-after-election-day>
. In the past 24 hours, the website of Immigration New Zealand (INZ) received 
56,300 visits from the US – a huge rise on its daily average of 2,300. 
And you should know

 * Reports 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-president-election-muslim-ban-immigrants-website-statement-removed-a7408466.html>
 that Donald Trump’s website no longer carries his statement promising a ban on 
Muslims entering the US are correct – but not as intriguing as they might seem. 
A glitch discovered by social media users on polling day thatallowed anyone to 
create their own banners on the press releases page 
<https://twitter.com/hansmollman/status/796115734501978112> was swiftly shut 
down by Trump techs, but the fix seems to have been taking down the whole page. 
So: no Muslim ban press release. But no press releases at all. 
 * And yes, the Simpsons did predict President Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/simpsons-predicted-president-trump-back-to-the-future>
. But those widely circulated pictures of cartoon Trump at the presidential 
podium? Not from 16 years ago, but from last year, after he announced his 
candidacy.  President Donald Trump meets Homer Simpson in 2015. Photograph: Fox

As president-elect, Trump will see the daily intelligence briefings that are 
sent to President Obama.

Former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright has been talking to the BBC 
Today programme <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04frqhy> about what happens 
now:

It is my hope that when he is given his full intelligence briefings and sits 
in the Oval Office and listens to people with foreign policy background, then 
he will understand that statements such as the ones that he made are dangerous 
for the United States; and that he will see that the world is not a zero-sum 
world and that we have to, and will need to, cooperate with others.

When America talked about America First before, it did not lead to the best 
results. And so my hope is that he is a smart man and that he will absorb the 
information when he sees it …

The main thing for the president of the United States is to remember that he 
is president of the United States and that our interests vis a vis what the 
Russians are doing are very important, and that our friends and allies in 
central and eastern Europe have been our friends and allies for a very, very 
long time.

Protests are quietening now, as parts of the US tick over into Thursday.

In New York, crowds have pretty much disappeared.

The marchers in Chicago have dispersed, with just a small group remaining of 
the several thousands earlier reported.

Demonstrations in Oakland – it’s still not 11pm there – are still going.

We’ve had no more reports of arrests.

A lot will be written about how Trump’s victory represents a backlash of rage 
from the white working classes, writesHadley Freeman:

Here’s an alternative take: we’ve heard enough of white rage now. Oh sure, 
listen to the grievances of enraged voters. But understanding them is different 
from indulging them, and the media and politicians – in the US and UK – have 
for too long conflated the two, encouraging the white victim narrative and 
stoking precisely the kind of nasty, race-baiting campaigns that led to Brexit 
and Trump (as the voter demographics have proved, the linking factor in Trump 
voters is not class but race).

Both campaigns promised to turn the clock back to a time when white men were 
in the ascendence, and both were fronted by privately educated false prophets 
such as Nigel Farage and Trump, absurdly privileged buccaneers who style 
themselves as friends of the working classes while pushing policies that work 
against them. They have bleached language of meaning, boasting that they aren’t 
“career politicians” (now a negative thing as opposed to someone who has 
devoted their life to public service), and they scorn “experts” (who are now 
apparently the biggest threat to democracy).

To call out voters for falling for damagingly racist and sexist messages is 
viewed by politicians as a vote-killer and dangerously snobby by the media, as 
though working-class people are precious toddlers who must be humoured and 
can’t possibly be held responsible for any flawed thinking.

There is no doubt the white working classes in the west have suffered in 
recent decades, yet no other demographic that has endured similarly straitened 
circumstances is indulged in this way. For decades, American politicians have 
demonised the black working classes who suffered far worse structural 
inequalities and for far longer – and Trumpcontinues to do so today

Trump's new Twitter account

Given the Twitter silence – 18 hours and counting – since the last tweet from 
@realDonaldTrump <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump>, it’s fair to guess that 
the president-elect hasn’t regained control of his account since aides relieved

After a Trump victory, what next for the left, in the US and beyond, asks Owen 
Jones:

Centrists have an easy retort. OK, smug radical, if we’re not the answer, 
let’s hear you list the flourishing leftwing governments, describe how the left 
bridges its divide? And, of course, they have a point. The style and culture of 
the radical left is often shaped by university-educated young people (a group 
that includes me). They are a growing and diverse group; often they hail from 
modest backgrounds. But their priorities, their rhetoric and their outlook is 
often radically different to older working-class voters in small town England, 
France or the US. Both groups are critical to building a victorious electoral 
coalition, and yet they are, indeed, divided.

That must change. Unless the left is rooted in working-class communities – 
from the diverse boroughs of London to the ex-mill towns of the north – unless 
it speaks a language that resonates with those it once saw as its natural 
constituency, shorn of contempt for working-class values or priorities, then it 
has no political future.

The left needs a new populism fast. It’s clear what happens if we fail | Owen 
Jones

Trump will meet the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in New York next week.

A Japanese foreign ministry official told AFP news agency the two would meet 
on 17 November, having spoken on the phone for about 20 minutes following 
Trump’s election win.

Abe will travel via New York to Peru for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) summit.

AFP reports:

On the phone, Abe “talked about the importance of the bilateral relationship 
and the Japan-US alliance”, which he stressed underpins the peace and stability 
of the Asia-Pacific region, the foreign ministry official said.

In response, Trump said he hoped to strengthen the US-Japan relationship 
further, the official said.

Trump also said he appreciated Abe’s economic policy and looked forward to 
working with him, she said.

She declined to elaborate on what else they discussed.

The police have now shifted the barricades to prevent more people from joining 
the protest outside Trump Tower in New York. Some people are shrugging their 
shoulders and going home. Others are marching to another Trump property at 
Columbus Circle to continue the protest despite the fact that Trump does not, 
in fact, live there.

At Trump International Hotel and Tower, Donald Trump’s property on Central 
Park West has become a new locus for protesters who have been prevented from 
joining the protest at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.

The building’s guests and residents could be seen observing the several 
thousand protesters congregated at its base, which the NYPD – either not 
anticipating protests here, or more concerned with protecting the 
president-elect’s Fifth Avenue residence – did not cordon off with more than a 
single cursory barricade.

Standing astride a plastic barrier for pedestrians across the street, a young 
man dressed in black performed a call-and-response monologue, echoed by nearly 
five dozen protesters standing side-by-side on the wall.

“I am a native New Yorker! I have lived here for 32 years! I grew up here! And 
we are putting you on notice! For your racism! For your fascism! For your 
heterosexism! And for your classism!” the man shouted, echoed after each

Politics as (un)unusual

 * Barack Obama will host president-elect Donald Trump at the Oval Office on 
Thursday. The two will meet at the White House at 11am ET, as will (separately) 
the current and future first ladies, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump. 
 * Hillary Clinton looks set to become the second nominee (hi, Al Gore!) to 
win the popular vote yet lose the electoral college 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/hillary-clinton-popular-vote-electoral-college-donald-trump>
 in the past five presidential elections. 
 * And Bernie Sanders has issued a statement about Trump’s win: 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> tapped into the 
anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment 
economics, establishment politics and the establishment media.


People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent 
paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not 
paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college 
education for their kids – all while the rich become very much richer.

To the degree that Mr Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve 
the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are 
prepared to work with him.

To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment 
policies, we will vigorously oppose him.

Protests in US cities

 * There were peaceful demonstrations on Wednesday night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/anti-donald-trump-protests-new-york-chicago-san-francisco>
 against the Trump victory and the rhetoric employed by the now president-elect 
during the campaign. Most protesters dispersed in the early hours of Thursday.

 * In New York city, several thousand people marched from Union Square to 
Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, blocking streets and prompting police to assemble 
hasty barricades. At least four arrests were made when marchers were moved on 
to Trump International Hotel and Tower on Central Park West. 
 * In downtown Chicago, several thousand people marched to that city’s Trump 
Tower, chanting “Not my president!” and “Our bodies, our choice!”. 
 * Thousands of demonstrators were also reported in Boston, heading from 
Boston Common to the Massachusetts statehouse. 
 * Other demonstrations have been taking place in Philadelphia, San Francisco, 
Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Portland and Washington DC, where a crowd massed 
outside a newly opened Trump hotel and others gathered outside the White House. 
 * Smaller marches were reported in St Paul, Minnesota; Richmond, Virginia; 
Kansas City; Omaha, Nebraska; and Austin, Texas. 
Globally

 * Asia-Pacific markets staged a huge recovery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/10/markets-rebound-investors-welcome-trump-plans-us-election-live>
 after an election day wobble, as the region followed the lead of the US and 
Europe. 
 * There has been a rush of interest from Americans in emigrating to New 
Zealand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/10/move-to-new-zealand-us-migration-inquiries-rise-24-fold-after-election-day>
. In the past 24 hours, the website of Immigration New Zealand (INZ) received 
56,300 visits from the US – a huge rise on its daily average of 2,300. 
And you should know

 * Reports 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-president-election-muslim-ban-immigrants-website-statement-removed-a7408466.html>
 that Donald Trump’s website no longer carries his statement promising a ban on 
Muslims entering the US are correct – but not as intriguing as they might seem. 
A glitch discovered by social media users on polling day thatallowed anyone to 
create their own banners on the press releases page 
<https://twitter.com/hansmollman/status/796115734501978112> was swiftly shut 
down by Trump techs, but the fix seems to have been taking down the whole page. 
So: no Muslim ban press release. But no press releases at all. 
 * And yes, the Simpsons did predict President Trump

podium? Not from 16 years ago, but from last year, after he announced his 
candidacy.  President Donald Trump meets Homer Simpson in 2015. Photograph: Fox 
Animation  
As president-elect, Trump will see the daily intelligence briefings that are 
sent to President Obama.

Former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright has been talking to the BBC 
Today programme <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04frqhy> about what happens 
now:

It is my hope that when he is given his full intelligence briefings and sits 
in the Oval Office and listens to people with foreign policy background, then 
he will understand that statements such as the ones that he made are dangerous 
for the United States; and that he will see that the world is not a zero-sum 
world and that we have to, and will need to, cooperate with others.

When America talked about America First before, it did not lead to the best 
results. And so my hope is that he is a smart man and that he will absorb the 
information when he sees it …

The main thing for the president of the United States is to remember that he 
is president of the United States and that our interests vis a vis what the 
Russians are doing are very important, and that our friends and allies in 
central and eastern Europe have been our friends and allies for a very, very 
long time.
 
Protests are quietening now, as parts of the US tick over into Thursday.

In New York, crowds have pretty much disappeared.

The marchers in Chicago have dispersed, with just a small group remaining of 
the several thousands earlier reported.

Demonstrations in Oakland – it’s still not 11pm there – are still going.

We’ve had no more reports of arrests.
 
A lot will be written about how Trump’s victory represents a backlash of rage 
from the white working classes, writesHadley Freeman:

Here’s an alternative take: we’ve heard enough of white rage now. Oh sure, 
listen to the grievances of enraged voters. But understanding them is different 
from indulging them, and the media and politicians – in the US and UK – have 
for too long conflated the two, encouraging the white victim narrative and 
stoking precisely the kind of nasty, race-baiting campaigns that led to Brexit 
and Trump (as the voter demographics have proved, the linking factor in Trump 
voters is not class but race).

Both campaigns promised to turn the clock back to a time when white men were 
in the ascendence, and both were fronted by privately educated false prophets 
such as Nigel Farage and Trump, absurdly privileged buccaneers who style 
themselves as friends of the working classes while pushing policies that work 
against them. They have bleached language of meaning, boasting that they aren’t 
“career politicians” (now a negative thing as opposed to someone who has 
devoted their life to public service), and they scorn “experts” (who are now 
apparently the biggest threat to democracy).

To call out voters for falling for damagingly racist and sexist messages is 
viewed by politicians as a vote-killer and dangerously snobby by the media, as 
though working-class people are precious toddlers who must be humoured and 
can’t possibly be held responsible for any flawed thinking.

There is no doubt the white working classes in the west have suffered in 
recent decades, yet no other demographic that has endured similarly straitened 
circumstances is indulged in this way. For decades, American politicians have 
demonised the black working classes who suffered far worse structural 
inequalities and for far longer – and Trumpcontinues to do so today

Given the Twitter silence – 18 hours and counting – since the last tweet from 
@realDonaldTrump <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump>, it’s fair to guess that 
the president-elect hasn’t regained control of his account since aides relieved 
him of tweeting duties ahead of polling day.

But here comes a new account for Trump news: @transition2017 
<https://twitter.com/transition2017>, which will deliver updates on the 
transition to a Trump administration. So far it’s just this:

The account follows one person: @realDonaldTrump

a step down from his own 14.1 million.
 
After a Trump victory, what next for the left, in the US and beyond, asks Owen 
Jones:

Centrists have an easy retort. OK, smug radical, if we’re not the answer, 
let’s hear you list the flourishing leftwing governments, describe how the left 
bridges its divide? And, of course, they have a point. The style and culture of 
the radical left is often shaped by university-educated young people (a group 
that includes me). They are a growing and diverse group; often they hail from 
modest backgrounds. But their priorities, their rhetoric and their outlook is 
often radically different to older working-class voters in small town England, 
France or the US. Both groups are critical to building a victorious electoral 
coalition, and yet they are, indeed, divided.

That must change. Unless the left is rooted in working-class communities – 
from the diverse boroughs of London to the ex-mill towns of the north – unless 
it speaks a language that resonates with those it once saw as its natural 
constituency, shorn of contempt for working-class values or priorities, then it 
has no political future.

The left needs a new populism fast. It’s clear what happens if we fail | Owen 
Jones

Trump will meet the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in New York next week.

A Japanese foreign ministry official told AFP news agency the two would meet 
on 17 November, having spoken on the phone for about 20 minutes following 
Trump’s election win.

Abe will travel via New York to Peru for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) summit.

AFP reports:

On the phone, Abe “talked about the importance of the bilateral relationship 
and the Japan-US alliance”, which he stressed underpins the peace and stability 
of the Asia-Pacific region, the foreign ministry official said.

In response, Trump said he hoped to strengthen the US-Japan relationship 
further, the official said.

Trump also said he appreciated Abe’s economic policy and looked forward to 
working with him, she said.

She declined to elaborate on what else they discussed.
 
In cities across the US, protesters have gathered on Wednesday night for 
peaceful demonstrations against the Trump victory and the rhetoric employed by 
the now president-elect during the campaign.

 * In New York city, several thousand people marched from Union Square to 
Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, blocking streets and prompting police to assemble 
hasty barricades. At least four arrests were made when marchers were moved on

At least four arrests have been made at the New York protest; many 
demonstrators have now cleared the area where police had started to act.
 
Scott Bixby, at the scene of the protest in New York, says a number of people 
have been arrested; the precise number and details aren’t yet clear:

The police have now shifted the barricades to prevent more people from joining 
the protest outside Trump Tower in New York. Some people are shrugging their 
shoulders and going home. Others are marching to another Trump property at 
Columbus Circle to continue the protest despite the fact that Trump does not, 
in fact, live there.

At Trump International Hotel and Tower, Donald Trump’s property on Central 
Park West has become a new locus for protesters who have been prevented from 
joining the protest at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.

The building’s guests and residents could be seen observing the several 
thousand protesters congregated at its base, which the NYPD – either not 
anticipating protests here, or more concerned with protecting the 
president-elect’s Fifth Avenue residence – did not cordon off with more than a 
single cursory barricade.

Standing astride a plastic barrier for pedestrians across the street, a young 
man dressed in black performed a call-and-response monologue, echoed by nearly 
five dozen protesters standing side-by-side on the wall.

“I am a native New Yorker! I have lived here for 32 years! I grew up here! And 
we are putting you on notice! For your racism! For your fascism! For your 
heterosexism! And for your classism!” the man shouted, echoed after each 
sentence by a friend with a bullhorn.
