Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> surprised the 
vice-president, Joe Biden, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Thursday.

A teary-eyed Biden accepted the medal, the highest civilian honor, at a 
ceremony at the White House.

Obama said he was bestowing the honor on Biden for “faith in your fellow 
Americans, for your love of country and a lifetime of service that will endure 
through the generations”.

He called the vice-president an “extraordinary man with an extraordinary 
career in public service”.

Biden praised his wife and children for their support throughout his career, 
and praised the Obama family for their dedication to country and service.

“I was part of the journey of a remarkable man who did remarkable things,” 
Biden said.

Speaking ahead of Biden, Obama said the tribute would give the internet one 
last chance to joke about the “bromance” the two share. He called Biden the 
“best possible choice, not just for me, but for the American people”.

Obama commended the “Biden heart”, listing the influences in Biden’s life, 
from the nuns who taught him in grade school, to his Senate colleagues, to his 
parents.

Noting that Biden’s career was “nowhere close to finished”, Obama said his 
vice-president would go on to have an impact in the US and abroad.
