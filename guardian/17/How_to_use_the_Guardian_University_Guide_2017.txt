An overall table and 54 subject tables

The Guardian University Guide <http://gu.com/p/48qay/> has an overall ranking 
of universities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2016/may/23/university-league-tables-2017>
 - and then there are54 tables for each subject area 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2016/may/23/university-league-tables-2017>
.

You can search for a specific course (for example, “illustration”), you can 
look at the table for the subject area it falls into (in this case, both “art” 
and “design and crafts” would be relevant) and you can see how well each 
university does at teaching that subject.

But you need to know what all the columns in the table represent before you 
can make a judgment.

Key to the table headings

1. The Guardian ranking of the university
2. Name of university
3. The Guardian score out of 100 is a rating of excellence based on a 
combination of all the other factors
4. Course satisfaction is the percentage of final-year students satisfied with 
overall quality, based on the National Student Survey (NSS)
5. The teaching quality score is the percentage of final-year students 
satisfied with the teaching they received, based on the NSS
6. The feedback score is the percentage of final-years satisfied with feedback 
and assessment by lecturers, based on the NSS
7. Staff-student ratio is the number of students per member of teaching staff
8. Spend is the amount of money spent on each student, given as a rating out 
of 10
9. Average entry tariff means the typical Ucas scores of students currently 
studying in that department
10. The value-added score compares students’ individual degree results with 
their entry qualifications, to show how effective the teaching is. It is given 
as a rating out of 10
11. The career score is the percentage of graduates who find graduate-level 
jobs, or are studying further, within six months of graduation. It’s our way of 
ranking employability

All the columns are sortable. So if one of these items is particularly 
important to you – for example, employability – you can reorder the table to 
see which universities do best for that.

You might need to know a bit more about the subjects universities offer, 
because there’ll be lots that you didn’t encounter at school. Have a look at 
our subject profiles, which were all drawn up with the help of academics who 
teach them. The links are at the top of each subject table.

If you hit the information button next to each university ranking, you can 
read about what makes the university special and get the info you need on fees, 
accommodation and transport links.

The Guardian University Guide is different


Our guide is different from other guides you might come across on the web. 
Very few of them rank universities. We do, by carefully combining scores for 
the aspects of university life that matter most to students.

Students <https://www.theguardian.com/education/students> need to know how 
good the teaching is. Will they get regular feedback on their work? What do 
other students think of the course? And do they stand a good chance of finding 
a job when they graduate? Answers to all these questions are contained in our 
tables.

Other university league tables focus on research scores. We don’t, because 
they are not important to students. We keep our eye firmly on what universities 
can do for you.

At some universities, there are so few students studying a particular course 
that we can’t include them in the statistics. Courses with small numbers of 
students are listed at the end of each table, but are not given a ranking. That 
should not be taken as any comment on their quality.

In compiling our tables, we have been advised by an expert review group of 
professionals from UK universities. The group meets regularly to monitor 
changes in subject areas and the way data is collected, and makes sure we 
produce the best possible guide.

The tables have been compiled for the Guardian by Intelligent Metrix, an 
independent consultancy that specialises in measuring performance in higher 
education. The rankings are based on official data collected by the Higher 
Education Statistics Agency (Hesa <http://www.hesa.ac.uk/>) and on the National 
Student Survey <http://www.thestudentsurvey.com/>, published by Hefce 
<http://www.hefce.ac.uk/>.

And if you’re the kind of person who likes raw data in spreadsheets to play 
around with, check out the spreadsheets on the Guardian datablog – they have 
all the numbers you might want to crunch.

Good luck with finding your perfect course.
