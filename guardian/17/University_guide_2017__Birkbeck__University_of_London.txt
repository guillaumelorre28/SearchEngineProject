 * While Birkbeck provides full-time courses in many of our subject areas, it 
has not been ranked alongside other universities in the league tables. This is 
because its full-time provision is a relatively new development and we cannot 
yet see how successful its graduates have been in finding employment. 
Furthermore, Birkbeck is unique in that its full-time provision takes place in 
the evening and we have some concerns this means it cannot support fair 
comparison with the rest of the sector.
