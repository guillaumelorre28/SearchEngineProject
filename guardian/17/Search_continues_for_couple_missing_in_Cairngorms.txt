The man and woman, aged 60 and 57, were reported missing on Sunday when they 
failed to return from a walk. Overnight searches in freezing temperatures 
failed to find them.

Police Scotland said the couple had been staying in the Glenmore area and set 
off at around 10am on New Year’s Day with their black collie dog. The man is 
believed to be wearing a red jacket and the woman has a turquoise coat.

Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team said a full-scale search was taking place on 
Monday with an RAF mountain rescue team and a coastguard helicopter involved.

Police said: “Officers are seeking assistance from the public to trace a 
couple who have been reported missing in the Cairngorms national park area.

“Police were called when they failed to return as expected in the evening. A 
search was carried out last night by search and rescue teams and a helicopter 
but the couple were not traced.

“This morning a search and rescue helicopter plus members of the Cairngorm 
Mountain Rescue Team and RAF search and rescue team will be out in the area 
looking for the pair.

“If anyone was out walking in the area yesterday and saw them they are asked 
to contact Police Scotland on 101 with any information they have.”
