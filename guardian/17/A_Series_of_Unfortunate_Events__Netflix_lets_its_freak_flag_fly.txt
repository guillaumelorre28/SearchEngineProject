Of all the high-profile non-starters of Hollywood’s franchise age, few have 
had as much going for them as 2004’sA Series Of Unfortunate Events, adapted 
from the hit children’s books by Lemony Snicket, fictional alter ego of author
Daniel Handler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/07/how-old-child-need-be-appreciate-lemony-snicket-daniel-handler-interview>
. Costing an outrageous $140m (more than that year’s Harry Potter entry), the 
film brought old-school sets, costumes and practical effects to a saga already 
steeped in cinematic intrigue, and introduced Liam Aiken and Emily Browning – 
perhaps the least annoying child stars of their generation – as the orphaned 
Klaus and Violet Baudelaire, the series’ industrious heroes.

It coped less well however with the demands of bringing a winding narrative 
serialised across 13 novels to the screen. Drawing on events from the first 
three books, the film threw out the series’ trademark narrative asides and 
storytelling cul-de-sacs, and instead rearranged the material into a 
traditional three-act structure, pasting over the joins with a bunch of rote 
Hollywood action sequences. Edges thusly rounded off, the film failed to set 
the box office alight (it was outgrossed almost four-to-one by that Potter 
movie) and a planned franchise never materialised.

Thirteen years on comes Netflix’s own adaptation of A Series Of Unfortunate 
Events, whose debut series – available from Friday – spreads the events of the 
first four books over eight hour-long episodes. Spreading a presumably smaller 
budget over a considerably larger running time, the show’s CGI-augmented 
universe can often feel murky and unreal where its big-screen counterpart’s 
felt crisp and tangible. And as the villainous Count Olaf, who schemes time and 
time again to wrestle an inheritance from the plucky Baudelaires, Neil Patrick 
Harris turns in little more than an echo of Jim Carrey’s performance from the 
film.

And yet, where 2004’s A Series Of Unfortunate Events seemed hell-bent on 
boxing in the books’ wilder narrative instincts, Netflix’s adaptation expands 
out in all directions to let the saga’s freak flag fly. Written by Handler 
himself, the show gleefully exploits the tools of its new televisual trade to 
amplify the literary playfulness of its source material. And so the mysterious 
figure ofLemony Snicket <https://www.theguardian.com/books/lemony-snicket>, 
whose oblique narration is the defining characteristic of the books, becomes a 
physical presence stalking the children through each scene, while his flights 
of storytelling fancy are spun into some of the most narratively ambitious 
kids’ TV ever. Offbeat, daring and totally gettable, it’s like a Ladybird Guide 
To Dialectical Theatre.
