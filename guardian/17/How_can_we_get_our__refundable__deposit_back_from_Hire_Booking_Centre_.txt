In October we hired a campervan from Hire Booking Centre, which operates out 
of the same address as Motorholme which you have written about before. We had 
to pay a £1,250 refundable deposit. We returned the vehicle but, despite 
repeated requests, are still waiting for our deposit.

The van was signed off as being undamaged so there are no problems on that 
front. On my most recent call I was told the issue was with the finance 
department who were all “out”. The finance department has no contact phone 
number.

Google reviews suggest this happens on a regular basis. I tried to report the 
firm to trading standards but have been told that they will only look into it 
if a number of complaints are raised.

A spokeswoman for the company told us it had been moving offices, and this was 
the reason for your delayed payment. After we got in touch the money was 
quickly repaid. This is another operation with poor online reviews, although it 
seems new senior staff have been brought in to try and turn things around.
