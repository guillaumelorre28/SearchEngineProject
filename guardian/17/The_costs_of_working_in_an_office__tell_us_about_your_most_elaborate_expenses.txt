Tea runs, gifts for departing colleagues, or sponsoring a co-worker’s latest 
marathon attempt – these are just some of the everyday expenses of working in 
an office.

But together they all add up: new research shows that the typical British 
employee can expect to spendmore than £14,000 during their working life

A survey by Nationwide Current Account of 2,000 office workers across the UK 
found that the combined cost of Christmas parties and dinners, cards and 
presents, coffees and teas, sponsorship requests and secret Santa, totalled 
more than £350 a year (or £14,500 across a 40-year career). Furthermore, when 
parties, nights out with colleagues and office clothing were included, this 
pushed the yearly estimate to more than £1,000.

The study found that men generally tended to be unhappier than women about 
spending money at work, but women were more likely to feel pressured into 
paying out for work-related items. For example, 42% of men were unhappy about 
spending money at work Christmas parties, compared with 34% of women.
