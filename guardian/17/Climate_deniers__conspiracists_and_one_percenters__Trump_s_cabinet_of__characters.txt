Barack Obama’s original cabinet was chockablock with historic firsts. The 
first African American attorney general. The first Nobel laureate upon 
appointment. The first female homeland security secretary, and the first 
African American to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Donald Trump’s cabinet, if confirmed, also would advance multiple historic 
firsts. It would be the first cabinet ofmultiple billionaires 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/18/donald-trump-senate-backlash-cabinet-of-billionaires>
. It would be the first cabinet to give pride of place toclimate deniers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/15/trump-cabinet-climate-change-deniers>
. It would be the first cabinet whose members want to eliminate their own 
agencies. And it would raise the bar – a lot – for conspiracy theorists.

Before Trump’s team faces closer scrutiny from Congress in January, here’s 
your guide to understanding how these four categories define many of Trump’s 
major nominees and advisers.


Climate deniers and enemies

These nominees would lead the four most important agencies in combatting 
climate change.

Scott Pruitt, EPA
Oklahoma state attorney general

Pruitt wrote in a May 2016 editorial in the National Review 
<http://www.nationalreview.com/article/435470/climate-change-attorneys-general> 
that there was a climate change “debate” that was “far from settled. Scientists 
continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its 
connection to the actions of mankind. That debate should be encouraged …” He 
was part of a “secretive alliance” with fossil fuel companies to fight Obama 
administration environmental regulations, according to 2014 New York Times
reporting 
<https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/us/politics/energy-firms-in-secretive-alliance-with-attorneys-general.html>
.

Ryan Zinke, Department of the Interior
Congressman from Montana

 In a 2014 interview 
<http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/politics/article_9acaff66-f67b-11e3-8238-001a4bcf887a.html>
, Zinke blamed the buildup of greenhouse gases on volcanoes. “I’m a 
conservationist, but when there’s a volcano in the Philippines that erupts and 
produces more CO2 than humans have produced in 200 years – is CO2 really the 
problem?”

Rick Perry, Department of Energy


 Former Texas governor

Perry wrote in a 2010 book that “we have been experiencing a cooling trend”. 
“I don’t believe that we have the settled science,” he said in a 2014interview 
<http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2014/06/19/in-dc-gov-rick-perry-talks-2016-ted-cruz-climate-change-border-security>
, continuing: “Calling CO2 a pollutant is doing a disservice the country, and I 
believe a disservice to the world ... I’m not a scientist.”

Mike Pompeo, CIA
Congressman from Kansas

Pompeo has used congressional hearings to grandstand 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmmMa-xMNVY> against “what you all call 
climate change today”. Hetold CSPAN in 2013 
<https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4456999/mike-pompeo-washington-journal>: “There 
are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change. There’s 
some who think we’re warming, there’s some who think we’re cooling, there’s 
some who think that the last 16 years have shown a pretty stable climate 
environment.”

Rex Tillerson, secretary of state
CEO of ExxonMobil

Tillerson pays lip service to “risks of climate change” but runs the world’s 
biggest non-state oil and gas extraction company. Likewise, he has said 
ExxonMobil favors a climate tax and supports the Paris climate accords buthas 
not backed 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elliott-negin/secretary-of-state-nomine_b_13713292.html>
 those statements with action.

One-percenters

Trump’s billionaire cabinet could be the wealthiest administration ever 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/02/trumps-rich-pickings-president-elects-team-could-be-wealthiest-ever>
. At least six appointees have net worths estimated in the nine figures. 
Collectively, they have more money than a third of American households 
combined, according to a Quartzcalculation 
<http://qz.com/862412/trumps-16-cabinet-level-picks-have-more-money-than-a-third-of-american-households-combined/>
.

Wilbur Ross, Department of Commerce


Industrialist

Net worth: $2.5bn, according to Forbes. He made it the old-fashioned way: by 
buying, merging and selling large industrial concerns in steel, textiles and 
coal.He owns 40 Magrittes

.

Linda McMahon, Small Business Administration
Entertainment executive

Forbes pegs the net worth of her husband, Vince McMahon, at $1.14bn; the 
couple has been married 50 years. Together they created the entertainment 
juggernaut now known as World Wrestling Entertainment.

Betsy DeVos, Department of Education
Philanthropist

Daughter-in-law of Richard DeVos, who co-founded the multi-level-marketing 
giant Amway, which specializes in beauty, home care and health products such as 
the dietary supplement Nutrilite.

Forbes pegs <http://www.forbes.com/profile/richard-devos/> Richard DeVos’s 
family’s net worth at $5.1bn.

Steve Mnuchin, treasury secretary
Financier

Net worth: about $655m, according to Bloomberg 
<https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-trump-cabinet/>. Former Goldman Sachs 
partner, hedge funder and Hollywood producer (Sully, American Sniper, The 
Legend of Tarzan).

Rex Tillerson

Net worth: around $365m, according to Bloomberg 
<https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-trump-cabinet/>. Outgoing chairman of 
ExxonMobil after 41 years with the energy giant.

Elaine Chao, Department of Transportation 
Public servant

Her net worth has faced scrutiny because her husband is Senate majority leader 
Mitch McConnell, who is subject to financial disclosure rules. Chao is a 
daughter of James SC Chao, a shipping magnate whose net worth PolitiFact had
difficulty nailing down 
<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/25/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-ad-says-mitch-mcconnell-ma/>
 in 2014, except to note that the family foundation recently gave $40m to 
Harvard.

Divided loyalties

A noticeable Trump innovation in picking a cabinet: appointing leaders who 
have said they would like to destroy the agencies they’re supposed to lead. A 
variation is appointing leaders whose careers have undercut the agencies 
they’re supposed to lead.

Scott Pruitt

Pruitt has been involved in multiple lawsuits against the EPA. He is currently 
part of a legal action waged by 28 states against the EPA to halt the Clean 
Power Plan, an effort by Obama’s administration to curb greenhouse gas 
emissions from coal-fired power plants. Pruitt has said the American people 
“are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to 
unnecessary EPA regulations”, and he boasted on his LinkedIn page that he was 
“a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda”.

Rick Perry

Perry famously suffered a memory lapse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/13/rick-perry-department-of-energy-trump-administration>
 during a presidential debate in trying to name the Department of Energy as one 
of three federal agencies he would eliminate if elected. “Oops,” he said. 
Perry’s background in nuclear issues, which is the energy department’s main 
charge, appears to be limited to an effort to privatize the disposal of 
radioactive waste in Texas. Perry’s two immediate predecessors in the job were 
both nuclear physicists.

Andrew Puzder, Department of Labor
Fast food executive

Puzder is a vehement critic of government regulation and staunch opponent of 
minimum wage laws and the Fight for $15 movement. He blames Obamacare for 
increased labor costs and has diagnosed a “government-mandated restaurant 
recession”.

Rex Tillerson 

As ExxonMobil’s main dealmaker around the world, Tillerson had interests that 
sometimes ran up against US interests. He continued (legally) to do business 
with Russia after the country became the target of continuing sanctions. During 
the Obama years, Tillerson defied the state department to cut an oil deal with 
the Iraqi Kurds, the New Yorkerpointed out 
<http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/rex-tillerson-from-a-corporate-oil-sovereign-to-the-state-department>
.

Betsy DeVos 

DeVos has been an advocate for school vouchers, which critics say undercut 
public schools.

Conspiracists

Trump traffics in conspiracy theories and fake news – Barack Obama was born 
outside the US and sympathizes with terrorists, the election was rigged, 
Hillary Clinton is a criminal – so it’s only proper that his cabinet should 
too. Here are the three Trump nominees in competition for the tinfoil hat 
trophy.

Ben Carson, Department of Housing and Urban Development 
Retired neurosurgeon

Carson believes pyramids were built by the biblical Joseph to store grain

Stephen Bannon, chief strategist 
Former CEO of Breitbart and Sirius XM radio host

Breitbart ran stories linking Hillary Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin

 to the Muslim Brotherhood in addition to stories stoking antisemitism, white 
supremacy and misogyny. As a Sirius host, Bannon made the “case that House 
speaker Paul Ryan is a liberal globalist trying to sell out the American worker 
to foreign Islamist shills”, the Daily Beastreported

Michael Flynn, national security adviser
Retired general

Flynn tweeted 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/05/did-michael-flynn-really-tweet-something-about-pizzagate-not-exactly/?utm_term=.b2e586933618>
 that Hillary Clinton had ties to “money laundering, sex crimes with children, 
etc”. Hetold his Twitter followers 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/kfile-flynn-tweets/> to buy the book of 
a far-right troll who said Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was part of a 
sex cult and the Orlando nightclub shooter did not act alone.

He once said 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/08/politics/kfile-michael-flynn-arabic-signs-on-border/>
 there were signs in Arabic along the Mexican border, which he had seen 
pictures of, to guide “radicalized Muslims” into the United States. “Onthree 
<https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=from%3Agenflynn%20%40JaredWyand&src=typd>
 occasions, Flynn tagged in his tweets Jared Wyland, an ‘alt-right’, 
antisemitic commentator who has tweeted about the ‘Liberal Jewish media’,” CNN
reported <http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/18/politics/kfile-flynn-tweets/>.
