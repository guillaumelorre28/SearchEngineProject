Spain possesses one of Europe’s richest food cultures, and its northern 
provinces offer both diversity and high quality. The north has a dazzling range 
of fine ingredients, displayed to perfection in its produce markets and 
food-based fiestas, and is proud of its time-honoured traditional dishes, from 
Asturian fabada to Cantabrian anchovies. Add to this the Michelin-starred 
restaurants, the tapas bars and down-home eating houses, and it’s very far from 
grim up north.

Cantabria

Markets and festivals

Mercado de la Esperanza <http://www.mercadodelaesperanza.com/> 
Slap-bang in the middle of Santander’s historic downtown stands this 
impressive traditional produce market, since 1904 the city’s food retail space
por excelencia. More than 80 stalls run the gamut of Spanish produce at its 
best (the fish section alone is worth the visit). Prices are competitive, and 
service fast and friendly.

Regional food fairs and fiestas <http://www.cucharaespanola.com/>
Cantabria is passionate about its native food and drink – that much is clear 
from the huge range of gastro-fests celebrated across the region throughout the 
year. Events such as thefiesta de la leche (milk festival) in Piélagos and the 
feria internacional del queso (international cheese fair) in Pesquera (August) 
are a fast-track route to the region’s foodie soul.

Regional specialities

Anchoas de Santoña
What acorn-fed ibérico ham is to southern Spain, Santoña anchovies are to the 
north. The salt-curedanchoas produced in this Cantabrian harbour town (
Sanfilippo <http://www.anchoasanfilippo.com/>, Emilia <http://anchoasemilia.es/>
 andDon Bocarte <http://www.donbocarte.com/inicio> are three of the best 
makers) are uniquely juicy and fine-flavoured. Look for them in delicatessens 
all over the region.

Sobao pasiego
It’s the quality of the raw materials – namely Cantabria’s excellent butter 
and eggs – that elevate the sobao pasiego from a simple sponge into a 
sought-after local speciality. Hailing from the verdant valley of Pas, it’s 
best sampled in the town of Selaya whereCasa El Macho 
<http://www.casaelmacho.com/> has been making fine sobaos since the 1950s.

Cachopo 
Those opting to self-cater could try their hand at this retro classic of 
Asturian cuisine, which consists of two thin steaks with slices of cheese and 
serrano ham between them, the whole thing coated in egg and breadcrumbs, then 
fried. The cachopo is also a brilliantly child-friendly menu option and is 
widely available.

Restaurants

Barrio Pesquero (Santander)
The salty, atmospheric Barrio Pesquero is the social and commercial hub of 
Santander’s fishing community. Along the Calle Marqués de la Ensenada lies a 
multitude of seafood restaurants – buzzing with a local clientele in search of 
sardines, paella, or grilled whole fish – headed up by classics likeLos Peñucas 
 <http://www.lospenucas.com/>and El Vivero <http://www.restauranteelvivero.es/>.

Restaurante El Cenador de Amós <http://www.cenadordeamos.com/inicio> 
(Villaverde de Pontones) 
Jesus Sánchez and his wife Marián Martínez are the duo behind this superb 
restaurant - probably Cantabria’s finest - where prime local ingredients (game, 
fish, vegetables) come together with contemporary techniques in dishes like raw 
tuna with spherified olives and “crystallisedtortilla de patatas”. (The locale, 
an 18th-century mansion, adds to the experience.)

Drinking

Cantabrian wine 
<http://www.turismodecantabria.com/descubrela/vinos-de-cantabria> 
The Cantabrian wine industry is still in its infancy but quality is improving 
by the year. The region’s wines are made in two vineyard areas: crisp and 
acidic whites in the coastal zone, and light, easy-drinking reds in the the 
uplands of Liébana. Picos de Cabariezo is the bodega to watch (try their 
excellent mencía).

Orujo
If there’s one tipple that defines Cantabria it’s orujo 
<http://www.orujoseltraviesu.com/>, a local firewater traditionally distilled 
in copperalquitaras and a speciality of the mountainous interior. Variants 
range from grappa-like clear orujo to the honey-flavoured licor de miel and the 
herb-infused licor de hierbas.

And other foody activities

La Jarradilla <http://quesoslajarradilla.com/en>
The Diego family makes cheese and butter from the milk of their Friesian herd 
in the verdant valley of Pas. The dairy, in bucolic surroundings, offers guided 
tours, cheesemaking workshops and tutored tastings of cheeses both Spanish and 
international. There’s also a farm shop (don’t miss the deliciousquesos frescos
).

Cocido montañés in Saja-Nansa county 
<https://www.guiarepsol.com/es/turismo/rutas/rutas-con-los-mejores-sabores/cocido-montanes/>
Here’s the plan: after a morning’s hike in the glorious Saja-Besaya Natural 
Park - Spain’s largest game reserve - repair to one of the rustic village 
restaurants in Bárcena Mayor or Tudanca for a restorative bowlful ofcocido 
montañés, a ribsticking stew of mixed meats and pulses, typical of Saja-Nansa 
county.

Markets and festivals

Mercado de Cangas de Onís 
<https://www.desdeasturias.com/mercado-dominical-de-cangas-de-onis/>
Jovellanos, the 18th-century Asturian chronicler, referred to the “many people 
and much movement” to be found at the Sunday market in Cangas, a proper Spanish 
souk sprawling around the parish church where locally-made crafts jostle with 
the best in Asturian cheeses, charcuterie, honey, fruit and vegetables.

Festival de la avellana <http://festivaldelaavellana.com/>
Asturias is big on fairs and fiestas celebrating a single product or dish, 
with the festival de la avellana being all about hazelnuts (of which the region 
is a major producer). Held over the first weekend in October, this annual fair 
is a chance for professionals and public to sample the new season’s crop. Go 
nuts!

Regional specialities and where to sample them

Fabada asturiana
Fabes, a type of large white bean, form the basis of Asturias´ signature dish: 
a potent stew with morcilla, chorizo and smoked bacon called fabada. Finding 
fabada is no problem – it appears on restaurant menus everywhere – but the luxe 
version served at restaurantCasa Gerardo <http://restaurantecasagerardo.es/> in 
Prendes is especially recommendable.

Cabrales <http://cheesefromspain.com/spanish-cheese-guide/do-cabrales/>
The pastures of the principality are ideal for dairy farming, and pungent 
Cabrales is up there with Roquefort and Stilton among Europe’s great blue 
cheeses. You’ll find this fragrant fromage all over the region, but the 
mountain towns of the Picos de Europa are the heartland of Cabrales production.

Restaurants

Restaurante Gueyu Mar <http://gueyumar.es/restaurante-en-ribadesella/>
Top-quality fish and seafood – landed at small-scale fishing harbours along 
the Cantabrian coast – is the USP at this beachside restaurant behind the 
sweeping sands at Playa de Vega. Gueyu Mar does a great line in whole fish (try 
the virrey or John Dory) cooked over coals or a la plancha.

Casa Marcial <http://www.casamarcial.com/web/>
In the same former farmhouse where his parents once ran a rustic shop and bar, 
Nacho Manzano now presides over a two-Michelin-starred restaurant where the 
food is both inventive and sophisticated, but never loses touch with the chef’s 
Asturian country roots.

Drinking

Oviedo Calle Gascona <http://www.sidreriasgascona.com/>
This Oviedo street teems with sidrerías (cider houses) serving plates of local 
food along with cider by the bottle. It’s a great place for total immersion in 
cider culture including curious customs such asescanciar, in which the drink is 
poured from a height (usually by expert waiters) into a flat-bottomed glass.

Vino de Asturias 
<https://www.turismoasturias.es/descubre/gastronomia/productos/vino>
Visitors to the rolling landscapes of Asturias’ south-west corner are often 
surprised to see vineyards among the oak and chestnut woods. In fact, wine has 
been made here since the ninth century and is currently undergoing a revival 
thanks to forward-thinking bodegas such as Antón Chicote, Vinos La Muriella and 
Monasterio de Corias.
