After his voyage on HMS Beagle, Charles Darwin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/charles-darwin> relocated to the English 
countryside near Orpington in 1842. There, he would spend the next 17 years 
working on his magnum opus, On the Origin of Species.

He adopted a surprisingly relaxed routine. A schedule was kept by his son, 
Francis Darwin, summarisinga typical day in his father’s life

.


7am: Rose and took a short walk, followed by breakfast.
8am: Worked in his study; he considered this his best working time.
9.30am: Went to drawing room and read his letters, followed by reading aloud 
of family letters.
10.30am: Returned to study for more research.
Noon: Walk, starting with visit to greenhouse, then down his gravel path known 
as the “sandwalk”, sometimes accompanied by his dog.
12.45pm: Lunch with whole family, which was his main meal of the day.
3pm: Rested in his bedroom on the sofa and smoked a cigarette, listened to a 
novel or other light literature read by Emma Darwin, his wife.
4pm: Walked around the sandwalk again.
4.30pm: Worked in study, clearing up matters of the day.
6pm: Rested again in bedroom with Emma reading aloud.
7.30pm: Light high tea while the family dined. In late years he never stayed 
in the dining room with the men, but retired to the drawing-room with the 
ladies.
10pm: Left the drawing room and usually in bed by 10.30, but slept badly.

Make an emotional connection 

Darwin’s strategy was one of crafted self-possession. He prioritised domestic 
comfort, time with his family and rambles in the country, rather than 
intellectual endurance. As a method for writing, it fostered a deep emotional 
connection with his research – and this intimacy resonates in the lucid flow 
and appreciative tone of his arguments:

“It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants 
of many kinds,” he writes. “With birds singing on the bushes, with various 
insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to 
reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, 
and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by 
laws acting around us.”

Getting it write: best practice in academic writing

Darwin resisted an automatic, or breakneck approach. The pleasure he took in 
both his writing and his research is tied up with his ability to take a moment, 
breathe and witness the world in a wider dimension. This consciousness of place 
is a method that can be applied to both natural history and to writing. If your 
writing is made up of frantic action, with no breathing space, you will spawn a 
confusing muddle of disparate ideas.

In a letter written to HW Bates in 1861 
<https://digital.case.edu/concern/texts/ksl:ditalldar00049> he provides an 
outline for effective working. Lamenting the sting of labouring “very hard and 
slowly at every sentence”, he admits that he sometimes finds style “a great 
difficulty”.


Find your imaginary person

His advice to fellow floundering writers is: “I find it a very good plan, when 
I cannot get a difficult discussion to please me, to fancy that someone comes 
into the room and asks me what I am doing, then try at once and explain to the 
imaginary person what it is all about.”

He also suggests that a writer should power through their piece briskly to 
construct a kind of skeleton argument. Equally, however, he is cautious to 
prepare for counter-arguments without appearing too dogmatic. On the Origin of 
Species has been described as“one long provocation in the guise of being none” 
<https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/11/11/adam-gopnik-angels-and-ages-darwin/>.

US writer Adam Gopnik, who wrote a book on Darwin, notes that the habit of 
“sympathetic summary” is essential to his rhetorical power.

“All of what remain today as the chief objections to his theory are introduced 
by Darwin himself, fairly and accurately, and in a spirit of almost panicked 
anxiety — and then rejected not by bullying insistence but by specific example, 
drawn from the reservoir of his minute experience of life… [On the Origin of 
Species] is not only a statement of a thesis; it is a book of answers to 
questions that no one had yet asked.”

The survival of his thesis was won partly because of intellectual empathy, 
rather than an ugly fight to the death played out in the public arena. Darwin 
teaches us that – in an effort to make sure that your work does not go the way 
of the dodo – it’s essential to adjust your methodology and anticipate 
arguments in order to survive.

But in the spirit of this philosophy, it is important to remember that such 
advice is worthless if you lack the tenacity to actually write the thing in the 
first place. So write. But be patient. After all, Darwin himself took more than 
two decades to finish his book.
