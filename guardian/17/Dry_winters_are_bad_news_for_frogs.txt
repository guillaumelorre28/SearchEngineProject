There are two types of ponds along the Greensand Ridge 
<http://greensandtrust.org/GreensandRidge.html> that runs across from Leighton 
Buzzard in Bedfordshire into South Cambridgeshire. They are either lined with 
clay, and fill with rainwater, or they are hollows in the ground that rely on 
rising groundwater in the winter.


Both provide breeding opportunities for the common frog

. The tadpoles have time to mature before some of the ponds dry out in late 
summer.

This ridge is made of mixed clay and sand, the terminal moraine of the last 
great ice sheet that almost completely covered England 10,000 years ago.Some of 
the ponds are ancient, made and lined by our ancestors

others have been scooped out by modern machinery to provide drainage.

Either way, aside from garden ponds, they are the main breeding ground for the 
frog, which favours the ones that dry out late in the season. This is probably 
because there are no fish to eat the tadpoles. In good years they can produce 
thousands of tiny frogs.

But this can be a gamble. Three years ago after a dry winter some seasonal 
ponds had such a tiny depth of water that the frogspawn was heaped up in the 
middle and was rescued by wildlife enthusiasts with buckets.

The last three months have also been unusually dry and the ground water is a 
metre below normal, leaving many of these ponds still empty. If the frogs are 
going to enjoy a good season in 2017 they need a great deal of rain in the next 
two months to top up the ground water and restore their breeding grounds.
