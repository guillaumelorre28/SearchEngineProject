 during a spell of despair related to her treatment as a transgender woman at 
the hands of her military jailers.

The army private, who is serving 35 years in the harshest sentence meted out 
to any source of an official government leak in modern history, announced her 
return to the general population of the military prison in Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kansas>, in a tweet.

Manning’s re-emergence puts to an end several days of jitters among her 
supporters who were alarmed by the sudden lack of communication with the 
prisoner. That prompted one of her most prominent supporters, Michael Stipe of 
REM, to put out a video statement on Facebook asking “Where isChelsea Manning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chelsea-manning>?”

Manning said that she was put into solitary last Tuesday, less than 15 minutes 
after she was served with a written notice of her punishment for the July 
suicide attempt. “I received written notification of the findings on Tuesday 
afternoon and was then placed in solitary less than 15 minutes later,” she said.

She was taken down to a so-called “segregation” cell where she was held in 
isolation, despite the fact that she had already indicated that she intended to 
appeal against the punishment. She is now likely to go ahead with the appeal, 
which has to be filed within the next seven days, in the hope of erasing the 
infraction from her prison record.

Military authorities at Fort Leavenworth and the Pentagon failed to respond to 
numerous requests from the Guardian for information about Manning’s apparent 
disappearance and solitary confinement.

Holding human beings in isolated confined spaces is well known to exacerbate 
depression and other mental health conditions. It has been found to induce 
serious psychological side-effects such as paranoia and suicidal thoughts 
within a matter of a few days.

Mental health experts reacted with shock and anger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/chelsea-manning-suicide-attempt-solitary-confinement-health-experts>
 at the decision of the US army to put someone who had survived a suicide 
attempt into solitary confinement – a response that risked reinforcing the 
behavior that it purported to punish.

The soldier’s support group @SaveManning expressed relief and said it was 
“nice to hear her voice”.
