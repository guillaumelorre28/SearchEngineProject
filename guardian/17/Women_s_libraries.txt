I would agree that there is no doubt that The Women’s Library at LSE is 
outstanding and I would encourage everyone to visit (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/21/womens-library-london-letter>, 
22 September). In terms of it being “nationally accredited both as an archive 
and as a museum”, I was informed by staff at LSE in November last year that The 
Women’s Library withdrew from the museum accreditation scheme in July 2015, and 
Arts Council England, which administers the scheme, does not include The 
Women’s Library at LSE in its comprehensive database of museums in England, 
available on the ACE website.
