Our owner, The Scott Trust, exists to secure the financial and editorial 
independence of the Guardian. Other than to cover expense, The Scott Trust 
takes no dividend from the business, ensuring all profits are reinvested back 
into the Guardian and its award-winning journalism.

One of the ways we generate revenue to safeguard our journalism for the future 
is by using your data (for example when you sign-in to the Guardian’s websites, 
and/or byusing cookies <https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies> when you 
browse our website) to make advertising more relevant to you.

This enables us to charge advertisers money, which helps us keep the website 
open to all, while at the same time making the Guardian and Observer’s own 
products and services more relevant to you.

We have guidelines <https://www.theguardian.com/help/privacy-policy> on our 
website which clearly explain how you can stay in control of the data you 
provide to us, as well as a place where you can manage your preferences, and a 
team who are dedicated to keeping any data you choose to share safe and secure.
