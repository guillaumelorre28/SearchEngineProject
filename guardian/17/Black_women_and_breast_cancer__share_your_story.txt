Black women in England are more likely to get advanced breast cancer than 
white women,new analysis  <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37991460>by Cancer

.

It was concluded that late-stage disease affected almost twice as many black 
women (22% of black African women and 22% of black Caribbean women) than white 
women (13%).

Experts say this is for many reasons, including possible differences in tumour 
biology, low awareness of symptoms and screening and barriers to seeking help.


While spotting the disease early is key, Heather Nelson of BME Cancer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer> Voice, said in an interview with 
the BBC: “Women of colour are less likely to go for screening.

“You’ll get leaflets through your door and they will be predominantly of 
white, middle-class women. There’s no representation of South Asian, African 
descent et cetera.

“If you get information like that, you’re going to look and think, ‘That’s not 
about me.’”

One woman said to the BBC: “A lot of us black people bury our head in the 
sand: ‘Oh, me, well, I don’t need to go, there’s nothing wrong with me.’”

But lots of work has taken place around breast cancer prevention. In October, 
the international community celebratedBreast Cancer Awareness Month 
<https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/10/25/breast-cancer-awareness-month/>
. The pink ribbon has become a symbol to express moral support for women with 
the disease.


So, why is this work not reaching everyone? If you’re a black survivor of 
breast cancer, we want to hear your thoughts. When did you find out you had 
cancer and what has your experience been? What do you think of the prevention 
messages available? Does it talk to a diverse range of communities? Why do you 
think that black women are less likely to go for screening?
