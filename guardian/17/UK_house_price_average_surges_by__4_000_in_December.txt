The average UK house price surged by nearly £4,000 in December in the fastest 
acceleration in values since theBrexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> vote, according to Halifax.


Prices rose by 1.7% in December alone, reaching a new all-time high of 
£222,484 and pushing the ratio of house prices to earnings to 5.81, just shy of 
its all-time high of 5.83 in July 2007 before the financial crisis struck.

forecasting a marked slowdown in the market in 2017.


Halifax said prices in the final quarter of the year were 2.5% higher than in 
the previous quarter, while the annualised rate of increase rose to 6.5% in 
December from 6% in November.

The eastern outer London borough of Barking and Dagenham experienced the 
second biggest rise in average house prices with an increase of 18.6%. 
Dunstable – Luton’s near neighbour – completed the top three with a 17.9% rise.

Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist, predicts that house price inflation 
will subside in 2017 despite December’s surge. “House prices finished 2016 
strongly. Slower economic growth, pressure on employment and a squeeze on 
spending power, together with affordability constraints, are expected to reduce 
housing demand during 2017.

“UK house prices should, however, continue to be supported by an ongoing 
shortage of property for sale, low levels of housebuilding, and exceptionally 
low interest rates. Overall, annual house price growth nationally is most 
likely expected to slow to 1%-4% by the end of 2017. The relatively wide range 
for the forecast reflects the higher than normal degree of uncertainty 
regarding the prospects for the UK economy this year.”

While final year-end figures for transactions have yet to be announced, 
Halifax estimates total UK home sales for 2016 will be broadly unchanged from 
2015 and 2014, at about 1.2m.

“Nearly six months on from the Brexit thunderbolt, prices are once again 
picking up speed slowly and steadily,” said Jonathan Hopper, managing director 
of GarringtonProperty <https://www.theguardian.com/money/property> Finders. 
“The chronic imbalance between demand and supply is playing a big part in 
driving up prices.”

Russell Quirk of online estate agent eMoov said economists are wrong to 
predict flat or falling prices in 2017.

“It would seem positive news on house prices simply will not go away despite 
the efforts of some to make us accept that the market will weaken in the wake 
of EU referendum angst.

“As we have said time and again, the UK housing market is fundamentally 
robust, bulletproof even, and we do not subscribe to the view of the naysayers 
that we will see price reductions in 2017. The clever money, given today’s 
numbers, is yet more positive news which will serve to underpin the overall 
economy this year.”

Economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight raised his forecast for 2017 
house prices from zero to 2%. “This is a modest upward revision from our 
previous forecast of flat house prices in 2017 due to the fact that house 
prices are carrying more momentum into 2017 than we had expected and also the 
fact that we have slightly upgraded our UK GDP growth forecast for 2017 to 1.4% 
(from 1.3%).

“We believe the fundamentals for house buyers will progressively deteriorate 
during 2017 with consumers’ purchasing power weakening markedly and the labour 
market likely softening. Increasing economic uncertainty is also likely to 
weigh down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major 
transactions such as buying a house.Housing market 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/housingmarket> activity and prices are 
also likely to be pressurised by stretched house prices to earnings ratios and 
tight checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders.”
