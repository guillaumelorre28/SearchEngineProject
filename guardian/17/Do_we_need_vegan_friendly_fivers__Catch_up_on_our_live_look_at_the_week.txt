What have you told your children about Santa?

Martin Belam

I had one of those moments parents dread this week. Just as I was putting the 
kids to bed my eldest, aged 7, asked “Does Father Christmas really bring us the 
presents, or is it you and mummy who get them?”
The question took me aback, and I’m afraid my reply was the rather 
unconvincing fluff of “Well, what do you think? It’s magic.”
She said to me “Look me in the face and say that, so I can see if you are 
lying.”
I was most conscious though that this was all in earshot of her 3-year-old 
brother. It’s been my policy not to lie to my children about anything. If 
they’ve asked where babies come from or questions about religion they get a 
very biological or honest answer. “Well some people believe Jesus was the son 
of God. But daddy doesn’t believe that.”
However, Father Christmas, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy all make an 
appearance in our household - which I guess makes me a bit of a hypocrite on 
the honesty front.
I was pleased today to find out I’m not alone, here is a lovely little 
collection ofwhat parents tell their kids about Santa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/02/refuse-lie-what-parents-tell-their-children-about-santa-claus-christmas>
 which is well worth your time.

Sending fat smokers to the back of the queue is a betrayal of NHS values

Polly Toynbee

The idea that NHS treatment should be denied or delayed for people who can be 
blamed for their condition is poisonous 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/01/fat-smokers-queue-nhs-health-drinkers>
. It will lead to the end of an NHS founded on the principle that treatment is 
free for all, when they need it, regardless of their status, their worth, their 
morals, their state of mind. It didn’t surprise me that lot of smug people 
wrote comments after my piece praising the Vale of York NHS, backed by Downing 
Street, for putting obese people and smokers to the back of the queue. People 
like to feel good about themselves by imagining they are superior to others, 
the unlucky, the addicted, or the unworthy. Which of us, really, is so 
virtuous? Let’s have empathy and support for the people who need it most when 
they are ill and treat everyone according to need.

Why are we so fascinated by the wardrobes of public figures?

Jess Cartner-Morley

Samantha Cameron’s intention to launch her own fashion label has been the 
worst-kept secret in fashion. This week it was confirmed with an announcement 
that the Cefinn brand will go on sale early next year. So far, all we have to 
go on are two outfits, and the fact that the brand logo is eyebrow-raisingly 
close to the Celine font. More details will be in the January issue of Vogue, 
which is out on Monday. But the news got me thinking: why is it that we are so 
fascinated by the wardrobes of public figures? And what does using a spell in 
Downing Street as a launchpad for a fashion or lifestyle brand say about modern 
politics?

I don't believe so as it's just a slaughter by product, and if it's more 
efficient to use by products than we should go with that. Having said that we 
should do everything we can to reduce beef and dairy consumption, as it's not 
the by products but the big market for those main products that are 
environmentally unfriendly and unsustainable. So lets focus on the real 
culprits, not the by products.

Are we failing women by not treating PMS seriously?

Zofia Niemtus

The nation’s wombs were a battleground this week, as the Royal College of 
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 
<https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/rcog-release-updated-advice-on-the-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-women-with-premenstrual-syndrome-pms/>
 recommended that sufferers of severe pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) should be 
offered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

The severe form of PMS affects about 2% of women, and is defined by 
psychological symptoms that interfere with work, school performance or 
relationships. According to the experts, CBT is a more effective treatment than 
antidepressants. Which sounds fair enough. But, of course, no.


Along with some fierce debate about the physical v psychological root of the 
issue, some interesting cultural questions were raised. Are we failing women by 
not treating PMS seriously? Are we trying to pathologise womanhood? Can our 
cash-strapped NHS afford to offer this kind of treatment? Can it afford not to? 
Do talking therapies work anyway? Can we have one damn story about periods that 
doesn’t prompt a load of sexist, sniggering comments? Let’s hear your 
thoughts...

Should women with PMS get free therapy on the NHS?

Are British vegetarians "stupid" to worry about the new fiver?

Campaigners are putting pressure on the Bank Of England, urging it make the 
new £5 note vegan friendly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/29/bank-of-england-urged-to-make-new-5-note-vegan-friendly>
. The response from the Australian pioneer of the polymer bank note? Well, he

Many readers don’t agree, and feel the bank should be more sympathetic – and 
perhaps more transparent.

I think it’s a reasonable demand that people who abhor and won’t partake in 
the death or suffering of animals to ask for alternative to a product they have 
no choice but to use.
It’s funny how easily people can trivialise others’ beliefs when they’re not 
their own.

But some of you are pointing out just how little of the material is in the 
notes.

And if you get about 40kg of tallow-worthy fat from the average cow, how many 
cows would you need to make every single £5 note in circulation?

JUST OVER HALF OF ONE COW

Maybe these nutjobs should campaign to only use tallow from a cow that died 
from natural causes if it still bugs them?

Conversation of the week: is eating al desko ever appropriate?

Guardian readers

We talked lunch this week, something that – perhaps because this feature runs 
around midday on a Friday – often comes up below the line. More specifically, 
it was the office lunches and your feelings towards your colleagues’ habits 
that turned cogitation to conversation.


How hot, smelly and noisy is your al desko lunch?

One comment that resonated with many was this, which talks of presenteeism 
culture invading the lunch hour.

<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4299139> 28 November 2016 1:51pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/88385839>  This comment 
has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate 
Even though my co-worker re-heats fish at her desk (gag), she actually makes 
fun of me/picks on me for "taking a lunch break" (as she calls it) because I 
leave the office for lunch.

That is what I find most depressing about the al desko (as the author calls 
it) trend. It makes leaving the office something to be ashamed of, whether it 
is your right to do so or not: many appear to think you are not working hard 
enough because you've left your desk for lunch

Part of the problem where I live (middle of the US) is that office buildings 
are not built with cafeterias or a break room anymore. Thus if you are bringing 
your lunch in, eating at your desk is the only solution.

Working during your lunch hour? This commenter agreed that this was the 
problem to tackle rather than stray odours.

Never mind the smell - it's working during your lunch that should be socially 
unacceptable. Previous generations worked hard to get us mandatory lunch 
breaks, but we willingly erode these rights with the creeping expectations of 
'professionalism' - a mythology of sacrifice and work obsession that negates 
our own interests.

And also away from the whiffs of reheated dinners, the sound ...

Less bothered by smells (unless they are incredibly vile) and more bothered by 
people who; eat with their mouth open / have weird clicky jaws / make weird 
munching sounds / take 2 hours to consume lunch.

I quite like having a nose and seeing what everyone's eating.

What do you think? Do you agree that we shouldn’t be eating at our desks? What 
foods go too far if you are chowing down above the keyboard? Share your 
thoughts in the comments.

Our video of the week: Sleaford Brexit byelection

John Harris

Today’s political news might be all about the Liberal Democrats’ win in 
Richmond Park, but next week a byelection happens in very different political 
territory. The Sleaford and North Hykeham constituency is in the Brexit 
heartland of Lincolnshire, and 62% of people in the relevant local authority 
area voted to leave the EU (in Richmond, 70% supported remain). As part of the 
Anywhere But Westminster series, I went there not to cover the electoral race – 
this is a very safe Tory seat – but to find out how the aftershocks of the EU 
referendum were playing out far from the capital.
Sleaford’s Brexit byelection: a people united by fear for the future 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/nov/30/sleaford-lincolnshire-brexit-byelection-young-video>
With my journo partner John Domokos, I found a deep generational divide, lots 
of Brexit voters who wanted the UK to get out of Europe as a matter of urgency, 
and also something much more complicated and challenging: a deep, emotional 
link between support for Brexit and strong feelings about the decline of 
community and solidarity, and simple loneliness. For anyone who thinks the 
leave vote was essentially reducible to nastiness and xenophobia, this film may 
serve as some kind of corrective; more generally, we think it’s not a bad 
picture of a very troubled England, and leave and remain voters united by one 
key thing – a pronounced fear of the future (oh. and some of what it explores 
probably also applies to Trump voters).

The result, along with the previous one at Witney, means that there's 
rich-pickings for any openly anti-brexit party. Sleaford could stop the 
bandwagon next week though.

37% of voters put the Conservatives into majority Government in 2015.
48% of voters supported Remain in 2016.

Harness the Remain voters, whilst Leavers are split between Lab/Con and who 
knows what could happen?

Here’s one of your views on that Richmond Park byelection:

I think what it means is that the country is more polarised than ever. 
Richmond is the kind of place where most people voted Remain. Rather than 
simply accept being told to "shut up" every five minutes, these people are now 
digging their heels in. The country is going to be divided for a very long time 
over this and the name-calling, wilful disregard of facts and tabloid hysteria 
have not helped one little bit. Neither, for that matter, has a government 
which has decided that "the will of the people" excludes millions who wanted 
exactly the opposite and that the referendum is a mandate not only to leave the 
EU, but to leave the single market, insult our neighbours, threaten people 
living legally in this country and sabotage the future prosperity of the 
nation. Paradoxically, both the Libdems and UKIP will be boosted by all this.

The Liberal Democrats – the only progressive party able to take advantage of 
Brexit schism?

Toby Moses

What does the Lib Dem victory in Richmond mean? Could a pro-EU message take a 
swathe of seats from the Tories? This graph by pollsterJames Kanagasooriam 
<https://twitter.com/jameskanag?lang=en> suggests that around 20-25 seats have 
enough people who voted Remain to overturn the Tory majority from 2015, so 
would be vulnerable to a similar swing – even without any drop in Tory 
popularity more generally.
James Kanagasooriam (@JamesKanag) 
Richmond one of a small group of Tory seats vulnerable to Remain tactical 
voting. Graphic below indicates up to c.20-25 could be vulnerable

<https://twitter.com/JamesKanag/status/804643509730942976> 
The question then becomes, can Labour take advantage? The Lib Dems are well 
placed – there are very few loyalists not in favour of staying the EU. Labour 
has a whole other problem with a swathe of northern Labour seats with large 
leave majorities. If Corbyn pivoted to an anti-Brexit, block Article 50 
position he might win over a few Tory seats, but he’d surely leave the north 
exposed to Ukip’s message that Labour is out of touch. That it wants to defy 
the will of the people and simple doesn’t understand what its base wants.

It’s a pickle for the Labour leadership to be sure – and one that is unlikely 
to be easily solved, which means the Liberal Democrats will be the only 
progressive party able to take advantage of the Brexit schism in the country. 
If they take enough seats from the Tories, and Labour can hold on to what 
they’ve got at the next general election a progressive coalition government 
could be a possibility – which I would suggest makes the chances of an early 
election slim. The risk is simply too great for a prime minister with a small 
majority and a reputation for playing it safe.

I definitely keep myself awake far too long in the evenings, mainly because I 
feel robbed of time after a day at work. When I come home I'm desperate just to 
spend time enjoying not being at work, relaxing, feeling equilibrium return. I 
arrive home exhausted and annoyed. I get a second wave of energy at about 9pm 
and that's bed by 11 gone out of the window.

Are we telling our bodies to do something totally unnatural?

For millennia, people went to sleep, then woke up for a few hours, then went 
back to sleep again. First sleep, second sleep. This is how we sleep. It's the 
natural way to do it. The idea of sleeping all night so we can go to work all 
day is entirely artificial, has only been around since the industrial 
revolution and not surprisingly, many people can't do it. What's surprising is 
that we can expect them to, or even ask them to do something so unnatural.

Our sleeplessness epidemic: why we are not getting enough shut-eye

Paula Cocozza

This week a report claimed that poor sleep costs the UK £40bn a year 
<http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1791.html>. People sleep badly, go 
into work, and with foggy heads do their best. But, whatever your job, such 
days are less productive than they should be.


Hit snooze! How a better night's sleep could save the UK £40bn

If only we could all sleep seven to nine hours a night, the UK would be 
wealthier. (The figures also showed a sharp impact of sleeplessness on 
productivity in the US, Japan, Canada and Germany.) Some companies provide 
napping areas. Others try to make the workplace feel homely.

But isn’t the real problem the endlessness of the working day, now revolving 
tirelessly around a world clock, the greed with which work wants to swallow the 
rest of our lives, so we stare at our smartphones when we should be sipping 
camomile and reading Marilynne Robinson?

Do you, like this reader, remember better times?

In one of my first jobs about thirty years ago, one of the manager's I worked 
for used to have a short nap in his office after lunch. But those were 
definitely different, less pressured times.

They are always welcome!
 
I had one of those moments parents dread this week. Just as I was putting the 
kids to bed my eldest, aged 7, asked “Does Father Christmas really bring us the 
presents, or is it you and mummy who get them?”
The question took me aback, and I’m afraid my reply was the rather 
unconvincing fluff of “Well, what do you think? It’s magic.”
She said to me “Look me in the face and say that, so I can see if you are 
lying.”
I was most conscious though that this was all in earshot of her 3-year-old 
brother. It’s been my policy not to lie to my children about anything. If 
they’ve asked where babies come from or questions about religion they get a 
very biological or honest answer. “Well some people believe Jesus was the son 
of God. But daddy doesn’t believe that.”
However, Father Christmas, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy all make an 
appearance in our household - which I guess makes me a bit of a hypocrite on 
the honesty front.
I was pleased today to find out I’m not alone, here is a lovely little 
collection ofwhat parents tell their kids about Santa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/02/refuse-lie-what-parents-tell-their-children-about-santa-claus-christmas>

The idea that NHS treatment should be denied or delayed for people who can be 
blamed for their condition is poisonous 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/01/fat-smokers-queue-nhs-health-drinkers>
. It will lead to the end of an NHS founded on the principle that treatment is 
free for all, when they need it, regardless of their status, their worth, their 
morals, their state of mind. It didn’t surprise me that lot of smug people 
wrote comments after my piece praising the Vale of York NHS, backed by Downing 
Street, for putting obese people and smokers to the back of the queue. People 
like to feel good about themselves by imagining they are superior to others, 
the unlucky, the addicted, or the unworthy. Which of us, really, is so 
virtuous? Let’s have empathy and support for the people who need it most when 
they are ill and treat everyone according to need.

Sending fat smokers to the back of the queue is a betrayal of NHS values|

Samantha Cameron’s intention to launch her own fashion label has been the 
worst-kept secret in fashion. This week it was confirmed with an announcement 
that the Cefinn brand will go on sale early next year. So far, all we have to 
go on are two outfits, and the fact that the brand logo is eyebrow-raisingly 
close to the Celine font. More details will be in the January issue of Vogue, 
which is out on Monday. But the news got me thinking: why is it that we are so 
fascinated by the wardrobes of public figures? And what does using a spell in 
Downing Street as a launchpad for a fashion or lifestyle brand say about modern 
politics?

I don't believe so as it's just a slaughter by product, and if it's more 
efficient to use by products than we should go with that. Having said that we 
should do everything we can to reduce beef and dairy consumption, as it's not 
the by products but the big market for those main products that are 
environmentally unfriendly and unsustainable. So lets focus on the real 
culprits, not the by products.
 
The nation’s wombs were a battleground this week, as the Royal College of 
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 
<https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/rcog-release-updated-advice-on-the-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-women-with-premenstrual-syndrome-pms/>
 recommended that sufferers of severe pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) should be 
offered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

The severe form of PMS affects about 2% of women, and is defined by 
psychological symptoms that interfere with work, school performance or 
relationships. According to the experts, CBT is a more effective treatment than 
antidepressants. Which sounds fair enough. But, of course, no.


Along with some fierce debate about the physical v psychological root of the 
issue, some interesting cultural questions were raised. Are we failing women by 
not treating PMS seriously? Are we trying to pathologise womanhood? Can our 
cash-strapped NHS afford to offer this kind of treatment? Can it afford not to? 
Do talking therapies work anyway? Can we have one damn story about periods that 
doesn’t prompt a load of sexist, sniggering comments? Let’s hear your 
thoughts...

Should women with PMS get free therapy on the NHS?

perhaps more transparent.

I think it’s a reasonable demand that people who abhor and won’t partake in 
the death or suffering of animals to ask for alternative to a product they have 
no choice but to use.
It’s funny how easily people can trivialise others’ beliefs when they’re not 
their own.

But some of you are pointing out just how little of the material is in the 
notes.

And if you get about 40kg of tallow-worthy fat from the average cow, how many 
cows would you need to make every single £5 note in circulation?

JUST OVER HALF OF ONE COW

Maybe these nutjobs should campaign to only use tallow from a cow that died 
from natural causes if it still bugs them?

We talked lunch this week, something that – perhaps because this feature runs 
around midday on a Friday – often comes up below the line. More specifically, 
it was the office lunches and your feelings towards your colleagues’ habits 
that turned cogitation to conversation.


How hot, smelly and noisy is your al desko lunch?

One comment that resonated with many was this, which talks of presenteeism 
culture invading the lunch hour.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/88385839>  This comment 
has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate 
Even though my co-worker re-heats fish at her desk (gag), she actually makes 
fun of me/picks on me for "taking a lunch break" (as she calls it) because I 
leave the office for lunch.

That is what I find most depressing about the al desko (as the author calls 
it) trend. It makes leaving the office something to be ashamed of, whether it 
is your right to do so or not: many appear to think you are not working hard 
enough because you've left your desk for lunch

Part of the problem where I live (middle of the US) is that office buildings 
are not built with cafeterias or a break room anymore. Thus if you are bringing 
your lunch in, eating at your desk is the only solution.

Working during your lunch hour? This commenter agreed that this was the 
problem to tackle rather than stray odours.

Never mind the smell - it's working during your lunch that should be socially 
unacceptable. Previous generations worked hard to get us mandatory lunch 
breaks, but we willingly erode these rights with the creeping expectations of 
'professionalism' - a mythology of sacrifice and work obsession that negates 
our own interests.

And also away from the whiffs of reheated dinners, the sound ...

Less bothered by smells (unless they are incredibly vile) and more bothered by 
people who; eat with their mouth open / have weird clicky jaws / make weird 
munching sounds / take 2 hours to consume lunch.

I quite like having a nose and seeing what everyone's eating.

What do you think? Do you agree that we shouldn’t be eating at our desks? What 
foods go too far if you are chowing down above the keyboard? Share your 
thoughts in the comments.

 
Today’s political news might be all about the Liberal Democrats’ win in 
Richmond Park, but next week a byelection happens in very different political 
territory. The Sleaford and North Hykeham constituency is in the Brexit 
heartland of Lincolnshire, and 62% of people in the relevant local authority 
area voted to leave the EU (in Richmond, 70% supported remain). As part of the 
Anywhere But Westminster series, I went there not to cover the electoral race – 
this is a very safe Tory seat – but to find out how the aftershocks of the EU 
referendum were playing out far from the capital.
Sleaford’s Brexit byelection: a people united by fear for the future 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/nov/30/sleaford-lincolnshire-brexit-byelection-young-video>
With my journo partner John Domokos, I found a deep generational divide, lots 
of Brexit voters who wanted the UK to get out of Europe as a matter of urgency, 
and also something much more complicated and challenging: a deep, emotional 
link between support for Brexit and strong feelings about the decline of 
community and solidarity, and simple loneliness. For anyone who thinks the 
leave vote was essentially reducible to nastiness and xenophobia, this film may 
serve as some kind of corrective; more generally, we think it’s not a bad 
picture of a very troubled England, and leave and remain voters united by one 
key thing – a pronounced fear of the future (oh. and some of what it explores 
probably also applies to Trump voters).
 
Some are looking not only to Richmond, but to Sleaford, Lincolnshire, where 
there will be a byelection next week.

<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16521069> 02 December 2016 1:26pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/88678545> 
The result, along with the previous one at Witney, means that there's 
rich-pickings for any openly anti-brexit party. Sleaford could stop the 
bandwagon next week though.

37% of voters put the Conservatives into majority Government in 2015.
48% of voters supported Remain in 2016.

Harness the Remain voters, whilst Leavers are split between Lab/Con and who 
knows what could happen?
 
Here’s one of your views on that Richmond Park byelection:
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16769876> Albert Ravey  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16769876> 02 December 2016 1:05pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/88677229> 
I think what it means is that the country is more polarised than ever. 
Richmond is the kind of place where most people voted Remain. Rather than 
simply accept being told to "shut up" every five minutes, these people are now 
digging their heels in. The country is going to be divided for a very long time 
over this and the name-calling, wilful disregard of facts and tabloid hysteria 
have not helped one little bit. Neither, for that matter, has a government 
which has decided that "the will of the people" excludes millions who wanted 
exactly the opposite and that the referendum is a mandate not only to leave the 
EU, but to leave the single market, insult our neighbours, threaten people 
living legally in this country and sabotage the future prosperity of the 
nation. Paradoxically, both the Libdems and UKIP will be boosted by all this.

Our colleague James Walsh has been speaking to readers in the Richmond Park 
constituency, resulting in this piece which is worth a read:

Why we voted to get rid of Zac Goldsmith

What does the Lib Dem victory in Richmond mean? Could a pro-EU message take a 
swathe of seats from the Tories? This graph by pollsterJames Kanagasooriam 
<https://twitter.com/jameskanag?lang=en> suggests that around 20-25 seats have 
enough people who voted Remain to overturn the Tory majority from 2015, so 
would be vulnerable to a similar swing – even without any drop in Tory 
popularity more generally.

The question then becomes, can Labour take advantage? The Lib Dems are well 
placed – there are very few loyalists not in favour of staying the EU. Labour 
has a whole other problem with a swathe of northern Labour seats with large 
leave majorities. If Corbyn pivoted to an anti-Brexit, block Article 50 
position he might win over a few Tory seats, but he’d surely leave the north 
exposed to Ukip’s message that Labour is out of touch. That it wants to defy 
the will of the people and simple doesn’t understand what its base wants.

It’s a pickle for the Labour leadership to be sure – and one that is unlikely 
to be easily solved, which means the Liberal Democrats will be the only 
progressive party able to take advantage of the Brexit schism in the country. 
If they take enough seats from the Tories, and Labour can hold on to what 
they’ve got at the next general election a progressive coalition government 
could be a possibility – which I would suggest makes the chances of an early 
election slim. The risk is simply too great for a prime minister with a small 
majority and a reputation for playing it safe.

I definitely keep myself awake far too long in the evenings, mainly because I 
feel robbed of time after a day at work. When I come home I'm desperate just to 
spend time enjoying not being at work, relaxing, feeling equilibrium return. I 
arrive home exhausted and annoyed. I get a second wave of energy at about 9pm 
and that's bed by 11 gone out of the window.
 
Are we telling our bodies to do something totally unnatural?

For millennia, people went to sleep, then woke up for a few hours, then went 
back to sleep again. First sleep, second sleep. This is how we sleep. It's the 
natural way to do it. The idea of sleeping all night so we can go to work all 
day is entirely artificial, has only been around since the industrial 
revolution and not surprisingly, many people can't do it. What's surprising is 
that we can expect them to, or even ask them to do something so unnatural.
 
This week a report claimed that poor sleep costs the UK £40bn a year 
<http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1791.html>. People sleep badly, go 
into work, and with foggy heads do their best. But, whatever your job, such 
days are less productive than they should be.

If only we could all sleep seven to nine hours a night, the UK would be 
wealthier. (The figures also showed a sharp impact of sleeplessness on 
productivity in the US, Japan, Canada and Germany.) Some companies provide 
napping areas. Others try to make the workplace feel homely.

But isn’t the real problem the endlessness of the working day, now revolving 
tirelessly around a world clock, the greed with which work wants to swallow the 
rest of our lives, so we stare at our smartphones when we should be sipping 
camomile and reading Marilynne Robinson?

Do you, like this reader, remember better times?

In one of my first jobs about thirty years ago, one of the manager's I worked 
for used to have a short nap in his office after lunch. But those were 
definitely different, less pressured times.
