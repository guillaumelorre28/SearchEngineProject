Anti-begging posters put up by Nottingham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/nottingham> City Council have been banned after 
complaints they implied that all homeless people were engaged in criminal and 
antisocial behaviour.

Over the summer the council ran a series of five posters to persuade the 
public to stop giving money to beggars.


One poster featured an image of a homeless man in sleeping bag begging with 
the text “Begging: watch your money go to a fraud. Beggars aren’t what they 
seem.”

A second featured a close-up of a person smoking a roll-up cigarette with the 
text “Begging: watch your money go up in smoke. Begging funds the misuse of 
drugs”.


And a third featured an image of a discarded lager can and the line “Begging: 
watch your money go down the drain. Begging funds the misuse of alcohol.”


The Advertising Standards Authority <https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> 
received seven complaints that the ads were offensive because they portrayed 
homeless people in a derogatory manner and implied they are engaged in criminal 
and antisocial behaviour.


Nottingham City Council denied that the campaign negatively targeted homeless 
people.


The council that its deliberately “hard-hitting” campaign was not 
anti-homeless people but designed to tackle the increasing problem of 
aggressive begging and to discourage members of the public from giving money to 
beggars, “almost none of whom were homeless”.

It contended that giving money to beggars is likely to fund drug and alcohol 
addiction and people wanting to help “genuine” homeless people should donate to 
charities that support them.


The ASA said that four of the five ads portrayed all beggars as “disingenuous 
and undeserving individuals”.


“We further considered the ads reinforced negative stereotypes of a group of 
individuals, most of whom were likely to be considered as vulnerable [and] who 
faced a multitude of issues and required specialist support,” said the ASA.


“On that basis we concluded [four of the ads] were likely to cause serious or 
widespread offence.”


The ASA therefore banned the ads.
