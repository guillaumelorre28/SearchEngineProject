I have two obsessions when I arrive at a hotel: first, as a near-religious 
neat freak, I load up the poor bell captain with all of my shirts, jackets and 
trousers for pressing. Nothing is more luxurious than opening a hotel closet 
with all of one’s things beautifully hung behind tissue and plastic sheaths.

Second, I am a candy addict who resists this temptation at home, but unleashes 
the monster when travelling – I head straight for the mini bar to grab the 
M&Ms, chocolate-covered almonds and other goodies.

I work in fashion, so all that travelling for photoshoots can make me feel 
rootless – which is why I’ve developed homely rituals to ground me. Walking 
into a hotel room, I immediately put the kettle on, unpack my toiletries and 
arrange them nicely by the sink, and hang up my clothes. Then I settle down 
with my tea and read the room service menu to scope out the place!

When working on low-budget projects, I find myself staying in some pretty odd 
joints. I usually look for a good spot to lie down on the floor with my legs up 
against a wall to stretch out. But the number-one luxury for me is music – 
familiar songs make even the strangest spaces feel like home(ish).

Having a centrally located hotel is key to my travel. The initial cost might 
be more, but in the long run you’ll save and it ensures a better experience. I 
always stay in a room with a view, because it makes me feel like I get an 
instant snapshot of the place I’m staying in.

I bring my trusty slippers, sometimes a familiar scented candle, always a few 
of my favourite teabags and a multi-plug socket splitter, so I can have my 
phone, laptop and camera all plugged in next to my bed, just like I do at home. 
It’s the little things.

I try to change into comfortable clothes as soon as I know I’ll be spending a 
few hours lounging in my room or getting ready for bed. A nice bath, something 
on the TV and a few hours relaxing in a comfortable bathrobe is the perfect way 
to wind down and feel right at home.
