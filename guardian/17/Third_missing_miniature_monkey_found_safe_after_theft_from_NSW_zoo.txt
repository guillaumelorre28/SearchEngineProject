On Tuesday morning, Symbio reported that Gomez had been returned home “in OK 
condition” but was “very scared”.

“Gomez has been reunited with his family this morning and we are allowing them 
as much time as needed to settle back in, in privacy,” the parksaid in a 
Facebook post. <https://www.facebook.com/symbiozoo/posts/10155564226759358>

“Sofia, the baby and the remaining family members are all doing well. Our 
exhibit will remain closed again today to give the family time to re-bond with 
Gomez, as we observe the dynamics within the family.”

Police are still hunting for the thief – or thieves – behind Friday’s monkey 
heist.
