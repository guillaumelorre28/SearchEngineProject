I own a Casio fx-85gt plus. It can perform 260 functions in less than a 
second, it can tell me when I've got a recurring decimal and it has a slide-on 
protective cover so that the buttons don't get pressed when it's in my bag. And 
even if the buttons do get pressed, I've got two-way power – solarand battery – 
so I'm sorted.

But as soon as I bought it I was disappointed. If I happened to be bored in a 
maths class, typed out 0.1134, turned my calculator upside down and slid it 
across to a friend I wouldn't get so much as a smile. The numbers look too much 
like normal typeface. 
 Typeface on a modern calculator 
It's a shame because this calculator, now recommended for GCSE and A/AS levels 
in most British schools is putting a knife into an age-old art form: the 
calculated insult.

Calculator spelling is known as 'beghilos' because most words have to use 
those letters. Hoping for a renaissance, we've dredged out a filthy old 
calculator and provided some reminders of this language's unique vocabulary. 

Try to decipher them and tell us which ones we've missed in the comments below…
 This one's a classic…  …but is also easily alterable  Having a bad day at

same with email. It doesn't work  Another one for the 'random and/or leery'
