A bug in iOS <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ios> is being exploited 
in a prank aimed at crashing iPhones and iPads using the power of simple text, 
flag and rainbow emojis.


The bug has two variants. One text string includes a waving white flag emoji, 
a zero, a rainbow and a hidden character called a variation selector, which can 
be copied into an iMessage conversation and sent to anyone. The other is the 
same string of characters, but embedded within a contacts file, which can be 
shared via iCloud Drive to an iMessage contact.

Both will crash and iPhone <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone> or 
iPad to varying degrees, although the text string sent via a standard iMessage 
only appears to affect iPhones and iPads with iOS 10.1 or below. The 
boobytrapped contact card affects all versions of iOS 10, including the latest 
iOS 10.2, the Guardian can confirm.

The bug was originally reported by YouTuber EverythingApplePro 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0iPhSuiMpk>, which has a history of reporting 
on iPhone crash pranks.

 EverythingApplePro demonstrating the emoji crash bug. 
French iOS developer Vincent Desmurs, who claims to have discovered the bug 
<https://vincedes3.com/crash-message-app-iphone/>, suggested that the issue is 
caused by Apple’s handling of the variation selector and the emojis beside it.
He said <https://vincedes3.com/bug-technical.html>: “What variation selector 16 
(VS16) does in this case essentially is tell the device to combine the two 
surrounding characters into one emoji, yielding the rainbow flag.

“The text you’re copying is actually a waving white flag, VS16, zero, rainbow 
emoji. What I’m assuming is happening is that the phone tries to combine the 
waving white flag and the zero into an emoji, but this obviously can’t be done.”

Users sent either the emojis via iMessage or the contact card see their iPhone 
oriPad <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad> crash after a short period 
of time, either resulting in a full lock up requiring a reboot, or a partial 
lockup that triggers a quick reboot. The irony of the prank this time is that 
by using the contact card it is quite difficult to avoid crashing the sender’s 
smartphone or even Mac computer, if sent through the desktop Messages app.

Users will need to delete their iMessage conversation with whichever prankster 
sent them the booby-trapped emoji to avoid repeated crashes on opening the 
messages. Some users have reported having their iPhones repeatedly lock up 
without being able to delete the conversation. Some have reported being sent a 
new message, or creating one with Siri before opening Messages to clear the 
block.

Apple’s iOS has a history of abnormal strings of text 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/27/iphone-crash-bug-text-imessage-ios>
 orvideos causing crashes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/22/iphone-prank-video-apple-smartphones-crash-bug-miaopai>
, which are then used to prank iPhone and iPad users, crashing their devices 
and in some cases preventing them from re-opening certain apps without clearing 
the prank messages.

Apple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> declined to comment.
