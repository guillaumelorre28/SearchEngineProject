University of London International Programmes 
<http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/> is part of the University of London, 
and was set up more than 150 years ago to enable students around the world to 
gain a University of London degree through distance and flexible study.

All of the programmes are developed by one of the University of London’s 
constituent colleges and are internationally recognised.

Students studying with the University of London International Programmes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/university-of-london-international-programmes>
 have between three and eight years to complete an undergraduate degree on the 
international programmes, meaning study can be combined with other commitments.

Students <https://www.theguardian.com/education/students> study using a 
combination of printed materials and online learning resources, and have access 
to a course website, which offers resources such as podcasts, activities to 
test progress, newsletters, and computer-marked assessments. Conferencing and 
discussion forums supervised by tutors are also available.

It also offers the opportunity to link up with fellow students around the 
world and participate in the university’s worldwide learning community. Course 
fees include 24/7 access to the university’s online library.

Fees Course fees are considerably lower than the costs of studying full-time, 
on campus. Visitlondoninternational.ac.uk
