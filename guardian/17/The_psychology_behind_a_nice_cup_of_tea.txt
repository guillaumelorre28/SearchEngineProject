As the temperature drops, you might find yourself reaching for a hot cup of 
coffee or tea, or warm mulled wine or cider more often than usual. But this may 
not just be because of the obvious benefits of warming your hands around the 
cup and banishing the cold from your belly.

In fact, studies have shown there’s a psychological element to choosing hot 
drinks - they can actually make us feel cosier and friendlier. In an 
experiment, people were asked to rate strangers on how welcoming and 
trustworthy they thought they were. Holding a warm cup of coffee made them rate 
the strangers higher on these attributes, while holding a cold drink had the 
opposite effect.

Those holding hot drinks were also more likely to be generous, and less likely 
to display behaviour thought of as selfish. This is due to the strong 
linguistic and metaphorical links created in the brain by repeatedly using the 
words ‘warm’ or ‘cold’ to describe personalities.

The same applies with sweetness. People who have eaten something sugary are 
more likely to describe a person positively - as ‘sweet’. Time to put the 
kettle on, perhaps.
