Yackandandah, like most Australian towns, has had its ups and its downs. One 
of its biggest ups was the north-east Victorian gold rush. By the 1890s our 
town was full of miners toiling to extract what was left of its alluvial gold. 
The only thing holding these folks back was an energy crisis. The miners were 
unable to source the power needed to sluice and dredge or crush the ore. The 
solution was a water race from high up on the West Kiewa river, which wasn’t 
the brainchild of government, or even the mines department – but rather a local 
man.

John Wallace, a Yackandandah resident, recognised a problem that needed 
immediate action and set about solving it.

Many people living outside of Australia’s cities are now observing a new 
energy crisis and, once again, it is from within these small communities that 
solutions are emerging. While policy makers dither and draft lifeless 
strategies, those outside of the political bubble have no time to waste as they 
already face the realities of climate change on a daily basis. With every 
hotter month, with every failing crop and with an ever increasing bushfire 
threat, those who live in rural and regional Australia are desperately looking 
within for climate change solutions – and acting.

Capturing the spirit of Wallace, our small community group Totally Renewable 
Yackandandah <http://totallyrenewableyack.org.au/> (TRY) is pushed by necessity 
to get on with putting new energy solutions in place.

Could carbon farming be the answer for a 'clapped-out' Australia?

We started by being ambitious: setting a Yackandandah renewable energy target 
of 100% renewable electricity by the year 2022. It won’t be easy but real 
change rarely is – as Wallace would vouch.

TRY has only been around for 18 months but has already witnessed a jump of 
more than 10% in the proportion of buildings supporting rooftop solar panels.

Before we began, there was the pioneering efforts of Yackandandah museum. 
After an electrical fire gutted the museum in 2006, forward-thinking historians 
saw the rebuild as an opportunity to embrace energy conservation and renewable 
generation. To this day, they pay next to nothing for power and both display 
artifacts and a model of intelligent energy planning.

In February, our town’s community-owned health service switched on 90 kW of 
solar panels which, along with a raft of energy efficiency measures, will 
substantially reduce daytime power demand from the grid and save the service 
$1m over the lifetime of the system. At the official launch of these new power 
measures, long-time residents of the health service retirement home could not 
have been more excited about the unfolding energy revolution.

Next door, the Yackandandah men’s shed committee created Australia’s first 
“stand-alone” men’s shed with a solar and battery system. Clearly our esteemed 
elders, many with a lived experience of scarcity, inherently understand the 
many benefits of generating their own renewable power.

Yackandandah also boasts a community-owned petrol station, borne by the 
looming loss of petrol supply more than 10 years ago. Not only does this 
business now return $20,000 each year to community initiatives, it also owns 
12kW of solar panels in partnership with a “low-carbon”folk festival 
<http://yackfolkfestival.com/about/environment/>. Perhaps, by necessity again, 
the pumped fuel might soon be electricity.

Unfortunately, our community ambition seems at odds with the capacity of 
successive governments to create strong, enduring and consistent energy policy. 
In fact, until last month no major party had announced an expansive policy on 
community power. If elected, the federal ALPpromises  
<http://onestepoffthegrid.com.au/community-renewables-to-get-98-7m-in-labor-climate-plan/>
to spend almost $100m on developing a a series of “community power hubs” around 
the country that provide legal and technical expertise, as well as start-up 
funding for groups like ours. We are still waiting to hear from the Coalition.

Instead, leadership has fallen to impassioned groups of people dotted around 
the country to use technology to dream their own way forward. The central 
Victorian communities of Daylesford andHepburn <https://www.hepburnwind.com.au/>
 Springs led the way by building a contemporary Australian community-owned wind 
farm. This was switched on in 2011 and the shareholder-owned enterprise 
produces sufficient power to meet the needs of 2,200 households. The 
cooperative also returns $30,000 annually to a community fund for local 
projects.

Newstead, in central Victoria, has also settled on a renewable electricity 
target of 100% by 2021. So far theNewstead community 
<http://www.renewablenewstead.com.au/> is making great gains with the bulk 
purchasing of green power, developments with micro-grids to push the boundaries 
of energy efficiency, local generation and electricity storage. Over the 
border, in New South Wales,Uralla <http://z-net.org.au/> has prepared a 
zero-net energy blueprint.

There are numerous other examples of communities tackling the issue: Anglesea 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-28/river-flow-the-top-concern-as-anglesea-looks-to-the-future/7279804>
 on Victoria’s coast lobbied hard to shut down their dirty coal power station 
and groups inPort Augusta <http://www.repowerportaugusta.org> and Latrobe Valley
 <http://www.latrobevalleysg.com/index.html> also want to transition to sources 
of clean, renewable electricity. Others inWoodend 
<http://wisegroup.org.au/projects/> and the Northern Rivers 
<http://www.enovaenergy.com.au> nurture their own community energy retailers. 
Members ofCorena <http://corenafund.org.au/> in Adelaide crowdsource funds 
nationally to install solar, while passionate people inMallacoota 
<http://www.energymatters.com.au/residential-solar/solar-buyers-group/mallacoota/>
 and Corryong work to strengthen their power supply with local, clean 
generation. The seasiders ofTathra 
<http://www.begavalley.nsw.gov.au/cp_themes/default/page.asp?p=DOC-GRG-41-34-16>
 power their waste-water treatment with solar,Byron Shire 
<http://www.byron.nsw.gov.au/byron-shire-aims-to-become-australias-first-zero-emissions-community>
 andTyalgum <http://www.energyforthepeople.com.au/solar-projects> are preparing 
to launch micro grids, and the ACT moves toward 100% renewable electricity.

Indeed, local communities all over Australia are hatching ambitious schemes, 
with 72 community energy groups throughout Australia, the majority of which are 
based regionally. Wallace might well be pleased at the way locals are finding 
and acting on solutions that work for their communities.

Isn’t it time that government policy took the emphatic science, engineering 
and economics on board and extended their hand to local groups such as these in 
leadership and solidarity? We need our state and federal policy makers to dream 
a conscious future and then act with courage. Then, and only then, will the 
ingenuity and can-do attitude of communities leading the way on renewable 
energy reach their full potential.
