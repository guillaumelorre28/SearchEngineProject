Air passengers have been warned to expect delays after southern England woke 
up to another blanket of fog.

The heavy fog covering the region on Saturday, which was expected to lift as 
the morning progressed, caused disruption at major airports. The Met Office fog 
warning across the south of the country was extended until mid-morning, with 
drivers being urged to take care on the roads.

Passengers at Gatwick and Heathrow airports were advised to check airport or 
airline websites for information on disruption.

A spokeswoman for Gatwick airport said: “Air traffic control restrictions 
imposed due to heavy fog across the south-east and Europe is causing delays to 
flights to and from Gatwick. … Gatwick is doing all it can to keep passengers 
moving and we apologise for the unavoidable and unfortunate disruption today.”

Friday’s weather disruption saw 70 departures and 70 arrivals cancelled at 
Gatwick. There were seven arrivals and eight departures with delays of more 
than an hour on Saturday at the airport, a spokeswoman said.

Some flights from Heathrow to destinations including Rome and Istanbul were 
cancelled on Saturday morning, while many were delayed by one to two hours.

Stansted airport said it was expecting a normal day’s operation with no 
cancellations, while Manchester airport said there was no fog affecting flights.

Highways England said there had been no significant weather-related incidents 
reported overnight on Friday or on Saturday morning.

A spokesman said: “The events over the last couple of days underline the 
importance of driving to the conditions. Fog can come very quickly so it’s 
important to leave plenty of space. The thing that’s really important to 
remember is when it’s wet it does take twice as long to stop.”

Forecasters said the heavy fog would largely lift before New Year’s Eve 
fireworks displays, although an incoming cold snap would see temperatures 
plummet as low as -5C (23F) by New Year’s Day.

expected to cause difficult driving conditions ahead of Hogmanay celebrations.

The Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said visibility on Saturday could be 
down to 100 metres after the lingering, freezing fog spread further overnight.

“We think it will gradually improve throughout the morning but it will be a 
slow process,” he said. Some patches of fog could persist into the evening “but 
not as widespread or as dense”.

The cold snap would be short-lived, lasting only until Monday and there would 
be more sunshine, he said.

Deborah Turbitt, from Public Health England in London, told people to look out 
for others, particularly the very young, old and ill, during the cold snap. 
“Every winter thousands of people die because of their exposure to cold 
weather, and doctors’ surgeries, hospitals and other parts of the NHS are kept 
busy as people fall ill – that’s why it’s really important that we all do 
everything we can to ensure everyone stays well this winter,” she said.

 in heavy fog near Milton Common in Oxfordshire at 2.45am on Friday. It 
happened 20 miles (32km) from the scene of a fatal pile-up on the A40 in 
similarly treacherous conditions on Wednesday morning.
