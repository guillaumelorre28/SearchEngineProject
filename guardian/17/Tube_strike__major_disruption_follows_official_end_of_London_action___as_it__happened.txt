efforts to avert yet more - here

.

This live blog is now closing. My colleague Matthew Weaver provided a 
comprehensive summary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2017/jan/09/tube-strike-all-lines-hit-and-most-central-london-stations-closed-live-updates?page=with:block-58739f2be4b02851854c23d6#block-58739f2be4b02851854c23d6>
 of the day’s events this afternoon.

Since then, the strikes have officially ended - ceasing at 6pm. Some services 
have been running, while others have remained down - particularly in central 
London, where most stations are still seeing disrupted services.Transport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> for London have said some will not 
reopen at all until tomorrow, though a normal service is expected then.

Many people have been trying to make their way on buses and, consequently, 
there has been congestion on those services.

Gwyn Topham

London Underground <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-underground> and the 
rail unions said they were prepared to resume talks later this week over safe 
staffing levels on the tube, after a day in which millions of commuters were 
affected by a strike across the network on Monday.

Reps from the TSSA union, who represent station staff, are meeting on 
Wednesday and talks could resume afterwards. Although unions have an ongoing 
mandate from a ballot in the autumn, allowing them to call further strikes in 
coming weeks, further industrial action is not expected, sources indicated.

Full tube services will be restored on Tuesday morning, but commuters in 
London’s suburbs and the south-east are braced for more disruption as train 
drivers, mainly in the Aslef union, along with some RMT members, strike on 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, and virtually no trains operating on the 
Southern network.

Tube stations throughout the centre were closed by the 24-hour walkout by 
staff in the TSSA and RMT unions which began at 6pm on Sunday night, leaving 
commuters to crowd onto trains or attempt to board busy buses slowed by 
gridlocked roads.

Limited Tube services ran in outer zones on the London Underground network 
that normally carries four millions passengers daily. Additional buses laid on 
byTransport <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> for London did little to 
alleviate many journeys, with heavy traffic delaying their progress. Many 
turned to walking or cycling, with almost twice as many bikes from the 
capital’s cycle scheme hired than normal.


Most national rail services were running into the capital, although Southern 
remained disrupted by the effects of an overtime ban by train drivers. At one 
point, Clapham Junction, the country’s busiest interchange on a normal day, was 
evacuated because of overcrowding.

The full report from Gwyn Topham is coming shortly.

however, most of the central London stations are still closed (the greyed-out

As Londoners struggle to make it home following the official ending of the 
tube strike during the evening rush hour, the prime minister’s spokeswoman has 
condemned the action. “As with the Southern rail strikes, the prime minister 
thinks it is unfair to be creating disruption for people in such an unfair and 
unjustified way,” she has said.

London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, had earlier broken ranks with many of his Labour 
colleagues to attack the strikes.

The strike is due to end at 6pm but it could be hours before services return 
to normal, so manyLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> workers are 
bracing themselves for what could be a tough journey home.

Here’s a summary of what’s happened so far:

 * A strike by London Underground workers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/08/london-underground-tube-strike-southern-ba-walkouts>
 has created severe disruption and gridlocked roads as most central tube 
stations closed.The 24-hour tube strike started at 6pm on Sunday but is 
expected to hit services until the end of Monday. 
 * Station staff in the RMT and TSSA unions walked out after last-minute talks 
aimed at limiting the impact of the industrial actionended unsuccessfully on 
Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/08/tube-strike-london-underground-severely-reduced-second-union-walks-out>
. The dispute is over staffing levels and station closures. 
 * Transport for London [TFL] said it was running a limited service on eight 
of its 11 tube lines on Monday and would open 69% of its stations across the 
network. The unions said the TFL’s figures were misleading. The TSSA said only 
10 of the 270 stations were open. 
 * Clapham Junction, the country’s busiest interchange on a normal day, was 
evacuated due to overcrowding as people looked for alternative ways to travel. 
A South West Trains spokesman said: “This is the worst crowding I’ve seen at 
Clapham Junction for many years.” 
 * London mayor Sadiq Khan condemned the strike - the only senior figure in 
the Labour party to do so.He said the unions had “legitimate concerns” about 
lack of staff at some stations, but he did not offer to recruit anymore staff. 
Khan’s political opponents have said the strike shattered his election pledge 
to end TFL strikes. 
 * Shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, expressed her support for the 
TSSA’s safety first message. John Leach, the RMT’s London regional organiser, 
claimedLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> Underground’s management 
privately also shared the union’s concerns about safety. 
 * Both sides in the dispute said they were willing to return to return to 
talks.But the RMT said Transport for London should increase its offer over 
staffing levels. TSSA general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said while hiring more 
staff was a step in the right direction, “200 jobs cannot plug the gaping hole 
that’s been left in the system by devastating Tory attacks on TfL’s budget”. 
 * There was a 149% increase in Santander cycle hires after extra bikes were 
put on in centralLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>. An extra 150 
buses were but many crowded bus journeys were delayed by an hour or more.

The RMT has accused TFL of using misleading figures about the number of open 
stations by counting unstaffed stations as open.

Daniel Randall, one of its London representatives, said central London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> stations remained “shut down”.

Open section stations can be kept open unstaffed, so this tweet is completely 
misleading. Zone 1 is shut down.#TubeStrike

TFL has since claimed that 69%, or 186 stations, are open.

I'm on 328. The problem is that the Journey Planner tells Bus 328 runs every 8 
minutes but I waited one hour.

You can read Gwyn Topham’s full piece on today’s travel disruption - and the 
efforts to avert yet more - here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/09/tube-strike-brings-manic-monday-for-commuters-in-gridlocked-london>
.

This live blog is now closing. My colleague Matthew Weaver provided a 
comprehensive summary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2017/jan/09/tube-strike-all-lines-hit-and-most-central-london-stations-closed-live-updates?page=with:block-58739f2be4b02851854c23d6#block-58739f2be4b02851854c23d6>
 of the day’s events this afternoon.

Since then, the strikes have officially ended - ceasing at 6pm. Some services 
have been running, while others have remained down - particularly in central 
London, where most stations are still seeing disrupted services.Transport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> for London have said some will not 
reopen at all until tomorrow, though a normal service is expected then.

Many people have been trying to make their way on buses and, consequently, 
there has been congestion on those services.
 
Many people are still struggling to get home now, two hours after the strike 
officially ended

London Underground <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-underground> and the 
rail unions said they were prepared to resume talks later this week over safe 
staffing levels on the tube, after a day in which millions of commuters were 
affected by a strike across the network on Monday.

Reps from the TSSA union, who represent station staff, are meeting on 
Wednesday and talks could resume afterwards. Although unions have an ongoing 
mandate from a ballot in the autumn, allowing them to call further strikes in 
coming weeks, further industrial action is not expected, sources indicated.

Full tube services will be restored on Tuesday morning, but commuters in 
London’s suburbs and the south-east are braced for more disruption as train 
drivers, mainly in the Aslef union, along with some RMT members, strike on 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, and virtually no trains operating on the 
Southern network.

Tube stations throughout the centre were closed by the 24-hour walkout by 
staff in the TSSA and RMT unions which began at 6pm on Sunday night, leaving 
commuters to crowd onto trains or attempt to board busy buses slowed by 
gridlocked roads.

Limited Tube services ran in outer zones on the London Underground network 
that normally carries four millions passengers daily. Additional buses laid on 
byTransport <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> for London did little to 
alleviate many journeys, with heavy traffic delaying their progress. Many 
turned to walking or cycling, with almost twice as many bikes from the 
capital’s cycle scheme hired than normal.


Most national rail services were running into the capital, although Southern 
remained disrupted by the effects of an overtime ban by train drivers. At one 
point, Clapham Junction, the country’s busiest interchange on a normal day, was 
evacuated because of overcrowding.

The full report from Gwyn Topham is coming shortly.
 
Some services are running at the moment, according to Transport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> for London. As the map below shows, 
however, most of the central London stations are still closed (the greyed-out 
areas are the stations where services are disrupted):

despite the fact the strike has officially ended:

As Londoners struggle to make it home following the official ending of the 
tube strike during the evening rush hour, the prime minister’s spokeswoman has 
condemned the action. “As with the Southern rail strikes, the prime minister 
thinks it is unfair to be creating disruption for people in such an unfair and 
unjustified way,” she has said.

London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, had earlier broken ranks with many of his Labour 
colleagues to attack the strikes.

We’re going to pause the blog for now, but we will be posting updates on any 
major developments. In the meantime there is more at theLondon Underground 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-underground> section of the site. If 
you’re working in London, good luck getting home.
 
The strike is due to end at 6pm but it could be hours before services return 
to normal, so manyLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> workers are 
bracing themselves for what could be a tough journey home.

Here’s a summary of what’s happened so far:

 * A strike by London Underground workers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/08/london-underground-tube-strike-southern-ba-walkouts>
 has created severe disruption and gridlocked roads as most central tube 
stations closed.The 24-hour tube strike started at 6pm on Sunday but is 
expected to hit services until the end of Monday. 
 * Station staff in the RMT and TSSA unions walked out after last-minute talks 
aimed at limiting the impact of the industrial actionended unsuccessfully on 
Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/08/tube-strike-london-underground-severely-reduced-second-union-walks-out>
. The dispute is over staffing levels and station closures. 
 * Transport for London [TFL] said it was running a limited service on eight 
of its 11 tube lines on Monday and would open 69% of its stations across the 
network. The unions said the TFL’s figures were misleading. The TSSA said only 
10 of the 270 stations were open. 
 * Clapham Junction, the country’s busiest interchange on a normal day, was 
evacuated due to overcrowding as people looked for alternative ways to travel. 
A South West Trains spokesman said: “This is the worst crowding I’ve seen at 
Clapham Junction for many years.” 
 * London mayor Sadiq Khan condemned the strike - the only senior figure in 
the Labour party to do so.He said the unions had “legitimate concerns” about 
lack of staff at some stations, but he did not offer to recruit anymore staff. 
Khan’s political opponents have said the strike shattered his election pledge 
to end TFL strikes. 
 * Shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, expressed her support for the 
TSSA’s safety first message. John Leach, the RMT’s London regional organiser, 
claimedLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> Underground’s management 
privately also shared the union’s concerns about safety. 
 * Both sides in the dispute said they were willing to return to return to 
talks.But the RMT said Transport for London should increase its offer over 
staffing levels. TSSA general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said while hiring more 
staff was a step in the right direction, “200 jobs cannot plug the gaping hole 
that’s been left in the system by devastating Tory attacks on TfL’s budget”. 
 * There was a 149% increase in Santander cycle hires after extra bikes were 
put on in centralLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>. An extra 150 
buses were but many crowded bus journeys were delayed by an hour or more.

The RMT has accused TFL of using misleading figures about the number of open 
stations by counting unstaffed stations as open.

Daniel Randall, one of its London representatives, said central London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> stations remained “shut down”.
Daniel Randall (@therubykid) 
Open section stations can be kept open unstaffed, so this tweet is completely 
misleading. Zone 1 is shut down.#TubeStrike

<https://twitter.com/therubykid/status/818455278492483584> 
TFL has since claimed that 69%, or 186 stations, are open.
