, the prime minister has said, claiming social efforts are more important than 
providing extra money for services.

Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> said the 
importance of support networks for people with mental illness had been brought 
home to her by the observation that anyone at work with their arm in a plaster 
would have colleagues talking about their injury, while “if you have a mental 
health problem, people are more likely to try to avoid you”.

As part of her vision for a “shared society”, May will announce measures on 
Monday aimed at improving the support available for people with mental health 
problems. “Money is going into mental health, but it is always wrong for people 
to assume that the only answer to these issues is about funding,” she said.

May is due to announce that Dennis Stevenson, a former HBOS chairman and a 
mental health campaigner, will lead a review alongside Paul Farmer, the chief 
executive of the mental health charity Mind. They will look at how people with 
mental health problems can be better supported in the workplace.

She will also announce plans to speed up the provision of digital mental 
health services, to improve services for schools and to stop GPs charging 
patients up to £300 for a form certifying their mental illness.

Speaking on Monday, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the speech was “an 
important part of her vision” as prime minister, with a particular focus on 
better mental health care for children and young people.

“First of all, we are accepting the reality that what we do at the moment is 
not good enough,” Hunt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

“In every classroom in the country there are probably about three children 
with a diagnosable mental health condition, and only help [for] about a quarter 
of them. That is a massive worry.”

Speaking ahead of her speech, May had said extra funding was going into mental 
health provision, but that addressing perceptions was more important. “We must 
get over the stigma. We must ensure that we are providing the services for 
people with mental health [issues].

“Actually if we look at the issue of mental health in this country, I think 
it’s more about the stigma that still attaches to mental health.”

An extra £1bn was pledged to the NHS for mental health services a year ago by 
David Cameron, but May said she wanted to tackle the problem in a wider sense. 
“It’s not a five-minute job. We can’t deal with these issues just overnight. 
It’s not about one speech, it is about driving reform forward over a period of 
time and being honest with the public that this does take time to deal with.”

Speaking on Today, Farmer said that giving priority to the issue would help 
deliver change, although when asked if any new money was being announced, he 
said: “No there isn’t. But ... when you make it a priority, you give it the 
priority, you join up the elements of government, you give the people with 
their own experiences, their own voice, a key role in the development of these 
policies, you can deliver change.”
