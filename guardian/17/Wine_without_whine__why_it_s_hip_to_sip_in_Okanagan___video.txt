The Okanagan has a continental climate moderated by beautiful Lake Okanagan, 
with hot summers and winters that are milder than the Canadian norm. This makes 
it an ideal terroir in which to grow and make world-class wines.

In this video, John Quilter takes a tasting tour of some of Okanagan’s finest: 
from See Ya Later Ranch, with vines planted back in 1961, to Jackson-Triggs, 
Canada’s most awarded winery, via Nk’mip Cellars – the first Aboriginal owned 
and operated winery.
