<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales> central west has 
health authorities sounding the alarm.

There has been an almost 100-fold increase in mosquitoes in the regions near 
Forbes, Leeton, Griffith and Moama, with an extraordinary number carrying 
viruses, according to tests by NSWHealth

“I am expecting to see one of the largest outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease 
ever recorded for inland areas of New South Wales,” a NSW Health scientist, 
Stephen Doggett, said on Monday.

Some of the mosquitoes are carrying Ross river and Barmah forest viruses, 
which can cripple sufferers for months. “They can cause persistent and 
debilitating symptoms such as joint aches and pains, fever, chills, headache 
and sometimes a rash,” Doggett said.

He warned it was possible some of the mosquitoes might be carrying the 
potentially fatal Murray valley encephalitis or the Kunjin virus, which can 
cause severe brain infection. There are no specific treatments for any of these 
viruses.

Flooding in the area

 is behind the spike and the mosquitoes are picking up the viruses from 
animals, according to NSW Health.

There have been more mosquitoes detected with Ross river than at the same time 
in the summer of 1998-99, when a record number of people infected. Only once 
before was the Barmah forest virus detected so early in the year, during a 
summer where there were more than four times the normal number of infections.

NSW Health is asking residents to take precautions to avoid being bitten, such 
as using mosquito repellent and covering up.
