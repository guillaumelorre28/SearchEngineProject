Jenni Murray’s recent suggestion of analysing pornography in the classroom 
might raise some eyebrows, but with up to 60% of young people using porn to 
teach themselves about sex, she’s right that schools should not ignore it (

, 17 October). The accessibility and lack of boundaries around pornography 
leave our children at risk of seeing confusing or upsetting images. Myths 
around dominance/submission, consent and sexual norms can skew ideas about 
relationships and gender, and unrealistic comparisons can damage body image.

A school working with parents to promote healthy relationships and internet 
safety should certainly support its pupils to make sense of porn, offering 
practical help to encourage positive choices online and offline.

Teaching about healthy relationships, consent and online safety begins in 
kindergarten, laying the foundations for the time when these topics become 
intertwined with pupils’ developing sexuality. As they mature, pupils benefit 
from a safe space in which to discuss broader questions. What pressures exist 
when considering a sexual relationship? What activities are you more likely to 
meet in a porn film than in real life? What are the different views found in 
society relating to pornography? What messages might porn give us and how might 
our relationships be affected?

Schools <https://www.theguardian.com/education/schools> should be seeking to 
empower young people to navigate today’s challenges. That includes 
understanding what porn is not: a manual for meaningful relationships.
