This week’s post is a one-off puzzle created by a crew captained by the 
Guardian setterBoatman <http://www.boatmancryptics.co.uk/> (you can get inside 
his head by reading our Q&A with him 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/jan/05/crosswords-meet-the-setter-boatman>
).

It’s a PDF, which you can download and print here 
<https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/06/14/boatman_puzzle_20160623.pdf>.

We’ll be back once you have all arrived at an answer.

Use a pencil.
