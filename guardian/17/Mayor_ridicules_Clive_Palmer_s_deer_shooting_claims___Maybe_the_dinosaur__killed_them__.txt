 had nothing to do with the council.

Palmer used a Facebook post on Saturday to claim council officers “armed with 
high-powered rifles” had slaughtered the deer on his property near the Avica 
Resort in Merrimac.

The former federal politician said at least 10 red deer had been shot and the 
meat then sold to local restaurants for $40 a kilogram.

Tate said an investigation of council records showed council had not culled 
the deer and an inspection of the property showed no signs of any slaughter.

“That kind of shooting would have left a lot of blood around and we didn’t see 
any of that,” he said before suggesting Palmer’s infamous animatronic 
Tyrannosaurus Rex from a differentQueensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> property was the 
culprit.

“One starts to wonder what did actually happen ... maybe the dinosaur ate 
them? You’re going to have to ask Clive that.

“Everyone’s having a holiday, watching old movies, I think Clive’s probably 
watched The Deer Hunter, woken up and gone ‘I’ve got those deers in the back of 
my yard and somebody shot them’.”

Palmer has reportedly been trying to sell the 76-hectare resort which he 
bought from a Japanese wedding company for $11.55m in 2010.

Comment has been sought from Palmer.
