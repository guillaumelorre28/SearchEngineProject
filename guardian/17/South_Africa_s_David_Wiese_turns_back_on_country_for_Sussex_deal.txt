The Guardian highlighted in December that Cricket South Africa has become 
powerless

 to prevent players from turning their backs on the country in order to join

 to join Hampshire last week, and now Sussex have announced the signing of 
Wiese as a Kolpak registered player subject to England and Wales Cricket Board 
permission.

The 31-year-old all-rounder, who had two stints at Hove last season, played 
six one-day internationals and 20 Twenty20s for South Africa. “I am very 
excited to be joining Sussex on a long-term deal. I thoroughly enjoyed my stint 
with the club last year and it made my decision so much easier when offered to 
return,” he said. Wiese will join his compatriot and fellow Kolpak Stiaan van 
Zyl, who signed for the club in November, at Hove for the 2017 season.

“Sussex is an extremely ambitious club and I look forward to being part of 
their future. I would like to thankCricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> South Africa for giving me the 
opportunity of fulfilling my lifelong dream of representing my country in the 
sport I love.”

The Sussex head coach, Mark Davis, said: “We are thrilled to have David 
joining us at Sussex Cricket. He is an extremely accomplished all-round 
cricketer who is effective in all formats and will bring great experience and 
skill to our group.

“He will add significantly to our white-ball team with his bowling and 
powerful batting at the death and has already shown his potential last season 
in the longer format. His experience will be invaluable to our young developing 
team.”

Wiese was due to be part of South Africa’s squad for the T20 series against 
Sri Lanka this month. But the CSA selection convener, Linda Zondi, confirmed he 
would not be available for selection. “David Wiese was one of our original 
selections but he has informed us that he intends to take up a Kolpak contract 
and has therefore been withdrawn from the squad,” he said.
