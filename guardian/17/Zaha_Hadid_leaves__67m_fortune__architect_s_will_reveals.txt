Zaha Hadid, the British-Iraqi architect who died suddenly last March 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/01/zaha-hadid-obituary>, 
left a fortune worth £67m, her will reveals.

The designer of the London Olympics aquatics centre, Guangzhou opera house and 
buildings in countries ranging from Saudi Arabia and South Korea to Azerbaijan, 
bequeathed a lump sum of £500,000 to her business partner Patrik Schumacher. 
Hadid also left a total of £1.7m to four nieces and nephews, as well as her 
brother Haytham Hadid, whose share was £500,000.

The architect, who was made a dame in 2012, was unmarried with no children and 
left her international design businesses, which account for the bulk of her 
wealth, in trust.

her several businesses, including the practice, to a wide range of parties. 
They include “past, current and future employees and office holders of the 
companies”, and the Zaha Hadid Foundation, which was set up to promote 
architectural education and exhibitions of Hadid’s work. Others who could 
benefit are family members and charities.

The will states that “for the moment” the trustees are her executors: 
Schumacher, Clarke, Palumbo and Rana Hadid.

Hadid was born in Baghdad in 1950 and became a revolutionary force in British 
architecture even though she struggled to win commissions in the UK for many 
years. She studied mathematics at the American University of Beirut before 
launching her architectural career in London at the Architectural Association.

By 1979, she had established her own practice in London – Zaha Hadid 
Architects – and gained a reputation across the world for groundbreaking 
theoretical works including the Peak in Hong Kong (1983), Kurfürstendamm 70 in 
Berlin (1986) and the Cardiff Bay opera house in Wales (1994).

The first major build commission that earned her international recognition was 
the Vitra fire station in Weil am Rhein, Germany (1993), but her scheme to 
build the Cardiff opera house was scrapped in the 1990s and she did not produce 
a major building in the UK until the Riverside Museum of Transport in Glasgow 
was completed in 2011.

She became the first female recipient of the Pritzker architecture prize in 
2004 and twice won the UK’s most prestigious architecture award, the RIBA 
Stirling prize.
