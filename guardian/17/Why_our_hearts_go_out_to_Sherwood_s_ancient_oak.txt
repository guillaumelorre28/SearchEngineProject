Although British place names make frequent reference to different tree 
species, there can be few road signs giving directions to a single specimen. 
Nor can there be many English woods more steeped in story thanSherwood Forest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/aug/30/sherwood-forest-travel-tips>.

I found a few incidental tales even as I walked up to the Major oak. There 
were fairy bonnet mushrooms painting their way across a dead stump likeLowry 
crowds

 through Salford. There were some last wasps around a waste bin, and wood 
pigeons so glutted on acorns their crops bulged. A robin laced its sad song 
among the birches, but sadder still was a bench with the following inscribed 
across its seat: “Abby Louise Hucknall – Missed So Much.” An emotional 
counterpoint came amid much open-armed laughter from the children playing along 
a Halloween-themed trail.

Then I arrived at the clearing and there was the biggest story of them all. It 
began about 1,100 years ago <http://www.eyemead.com/majoroak.htm> and has 
acquired a 10-metre waistband and two enormous stegosaurus-tail limbs, whose 
reach measures 90 metres around the top. The tree has worn out several names 
down the years – Cockpen Tree,Queen’s Oak 
<http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/rodgers1908/majoroak.htm> – and even its modern 
version derives from an18th-century historian, Major Rooke.

In time we have mingled anxiety with awe, and in 1908 slung steel harnesses 
and chains to cradle vulnerable branches. By 1975, along with our hands-on 
affections, came trampling feet that compacted the ground and starved the tree 
of nutrients. Now there are 10 steel support buttresses and a high fence around 
to hold the estimated 5 million visitors every decade at an oak’s arm’s length 
from too much intimacy.

Yet why exactly should we privilege this one organism with all our reverence? 
After all, those fairy bonnets or the wasps are chemically more complex than 
any lifeless planet out in the galaxy. The wood pigeons rising out of the trees 
bear aloft aheritage of flight dating back to the Jurassic 
<http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_06>. Or is it, 
perhaps, a simpler human-sized story: that, after 400,000 days on Earth, this 
magnificent oak is still full of life, like those playing children, while 
much-missed Abby Hucknall, alas, is not.
