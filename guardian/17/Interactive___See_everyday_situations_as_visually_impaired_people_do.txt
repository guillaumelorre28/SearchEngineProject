Maureen Hart (76), London: glaucoma

“I’d heard the word ‘glaucoma’ but I just thought you’d go to the hospital, 
they’d give you something and you’d be alright. I didn’t know it was incurable 
and you could lose your sight altogether. The top half of my vision is gone, if 
I close one eye. Eventually it can be a pinhole you’re looking through, if it 
progresses that much.

“It came on very quickly, about six years ago. At first I thought I was going 
to go blind the next day, but now I’ve gotten used to it and I’m living with 
it. I do thank God every morning when I open my eyes and think; ‘Can I see? 
Yeah, I can still see’.

“I can’t do yoga, pilates, weights in the gym or swimming any more - all 
things I loved doing. All I do now is dance. My life is a lot of dancing now.”

About glaucoma
Glaucoma is caused by fluid collecting inside the eye, putting pressure on the 
optic nerve, which causes damage. It’s a common condition but often goes 
undiagnosed, as it doesn’t always have symptoms in the early stages. It can 
affect people of all ages, even babies, but is most common in people over 70.

Debbie White (51), Warwickshire: retinitis pigmentosa

“The symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa can come in when you’re in your late 
teens. I was diagnosed late at 21, but hadn’t noticed – I just thought I was 
clumsy, bumping into things, knocking things over.

“If you can imagine looking through a toilet roll, that’s what my vision is 
like at the worst – I have these black spots in the bottom part of my eye, so 
lower-level things are harder for me to see. I also have night blindness.

“The biggest thing is losing your independence. You can’t just jump in a car. 
You can’t just get from A to B. I can’t just get my golf clubs and go for a 
game of golf, because I can’t see the ball. That’s what I miss the most.

“I don’t think I appreciated my eyesight when I was younger - but I don’t 
resent the condition, because I’ve lived with it for the last 31 years. Now, 
with the researchFight for Sight <https://www.theguardian.com/fight-for-sight> 
is doing, we can help other people understand their condition and there is hope 
of a treatment.”

About retinitis pigmentosa
A group of inherited conditions, retinitis pigmentosa affects the retina at 
the back of the eye, causing narrowing of the field of vision - how much varies 
widely from person to person.
