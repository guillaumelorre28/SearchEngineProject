A modern classic or a modish crowdpleaser? That’s the question Guardian critic 
Michael Billington recently asked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/21/art-review-rufus-sewell-tim-key-old-vic-london>
 ofYasmina Reza 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/22/yasmina-reza-interview-carnage-polanski>
’s stylish 1994 hit play. It’s a study of male bonding and honesty that pivots 
on the relationship between three old friends – played here byTim Key

,Paul Ritter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/14/paul-ritter-favourite-tv> 
andRufus Sewell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/mar/30/rufus-sewell-almost-famous> – 
which is challenged when one of them buys an expensive all-white painting. 
Billington is not alone in suggesting that, judging by Matthew Warchus’s finely 
nuanced revival, it’s the former.

2 Mamma Mia!
If the middle of January feels a bit bleak, inject a little silliness and Abba 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba> into your life with one of the West 
End’s longest runners. There is a reason why it has survived so long; not just 
the catchiness of those familiar songs, but the way that Catherine Johnson’s 
storytelling makes this a jukebox musical with heart.Phyllida Lloyd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/phyllida-lloyd>’s production ensures that 
the staging hits all the right emotional notes.

3 In a Pickle
Another little cracker from Oily Cart <http://www.oilycart.org.uk/>, the 
wonderful company for children that is the envy of many organisations making 
theatre exclusively for grownups. Commissioned bythe RSC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rsc>, where it played in 2012 to great 
acclaim, this reworked version of a show aimed at three- to five-year-olds 
takes its inspiration fromThe Winter’s Tale 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winter%27s_Tale>, particularly the Bohemia 
sheep-shearing festival. Follow a shepherd as she prepares for the celebration 
and help her trace the true parents of the lost baby she discovers.
Theatr Clwyd, Mold, to Saturday 21 Jan; touring to Sunday 12 Feb

4 Much Ado About Nothing
Playing alongside Love’s Labour’s Lost 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/05/best-shakespeare-productions-loves-labours-lost>
,Christopher Luscombe’s production 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/18/loves-labours-lost-much-ado-about-nothing-review-christopher-luscombe-rsc-london>
 is set at the end of the first world war among officers billeted in a 
Warwickshire country house. But it’s not the downer you might expect. Instead, 
Lisa Dillon’s Beatrice and Edward Bennett’s Benedick make hostilities seem 
decidedly merry. They circle around each other in a witty war of words in which 
marriage and happiness don’t seem inevitable but genuinely hard won.
Theatre Royal Haymarket, SW1, to Saturday 18 Mar

5 Amadeus
“Lush” is the only word for Michael Longhurst’s revival of Peter Shaffer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/shaffer>’s 1979 hit, about the rivalry 
between court composer Salieri and young upstart Mozart. There are fine 
performances from Adam Gillen as the precociously talented but charmless Mozart 
andLucian Msamati 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jan/28/lucian-msamati-othello-game-of-thrones-interview>
 as the eclipsed composer who may have had a hand in the prodigy’s death.
