are among five new names placed on a US sanctions list, as the Obama 
administration rushes to censure Russia before it relinquishes power in 10 
days’ time.

Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, suspects in the 2006 murder of Litvinenko

 with polonium in London, were placed on the “Magnitsky list” by the US 
Treasury, along with Alexander Bastrykin, the powerful head of Russia’s 
investigative committee.

Officials said the sanctions were not linked to the recent allegations that 
Russia interfered in the US elections, but the measures are the latest of 
several taken againstRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> in the 
past fortnight.

The Magnitsky Act was passed in 2012 with the aim of punishing officials 
responsible for human rights abuses, notably the 2009 prison death of the 
whistleblowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.


The other two people added to the list were Gennady Plaksin, a former bank 
chief, and Stanislav Gordiyevsky, a state investigator, both of whom have been 
tied to the Magnistky case.

The list is now made up of 44 Russians who are banned from travelling to the 
US and have had any assets in the country frozen.

Lugovoi, who is now an MP, told the RIA Novosti news agency he was perplexed 
at being placed on the list. Bastrykin has previously said it would be a great 
honour to be included on a US sanctions list.

US intelligence agencies have assessed that their Russian military 
counterparts hacked the Democratic party’s server, leaked data and carried out 
a multi-faceted campaign to promote Donald Trump’s election.The president-elect 
has called the claims

 “a political witch-hunt”, and the Kremlin hasrepeatedly denied 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/09/vladimir-putin-slates-baseless-amateurish-us-election-hacking-report>
 involvement.

In response to the assessment, the US expelled 35 Russian diplomats and closed 
down two diplomatic compounds used since the Soviet era. It also announced a 
number of sanctions against top intelligence officials, two criminal hackers 
and threetech companies

.


Trump has repeatedly praised Putin and declined to criticise Russia over the 
alleged interference. His initial public response to the expulsion of the 
diplomats was to call Putin “very smart” for not responding in kind. Putin said 
he believed relations could improve under Trump, and instead of a reciprocal 
expulsion, invited the children of US diplomats to see the Kremlin Christmas 
tree.

Trump wrote on Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/817753083707015168> over the 
weekend that once he is president, “both countries will, perhaps, work together 
to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!”

Trump’s adviser, Kellyanne Conway, said in a television interview on Monday 
that he could seek to roll back some of the sanctions. “I predict that 
President Trump will want to make sure that our actions are proportionate to 
what occurred, based on what we know,” she said.
