Losing a loved one to suicide can be incredibly painful and it’s a subject 
that people often struggle to talk about.


The grief associated with this sort of loss can often be very complicated. 
Suicide is usually quite sudden, unexpected and may be violent. This can make 
it more traumatic compared to many other types of bereavement. Sometimes people 
are left asking whether they could have done anything differently.

We want to hear from readers about how to cope when someone close to you takes 
their own life. What helped you through the grief? Do you have any advice for 
others? What impact did your loved one’s death have on you? What can be done
