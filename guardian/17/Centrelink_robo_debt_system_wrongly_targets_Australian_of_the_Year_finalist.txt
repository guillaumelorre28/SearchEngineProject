A leading fetal alcohol syndrome researcher and Queensland Australian of the 
Year finalist has been caught up in theCentrelink debt recovery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/centrelink-debt-recovery> scandal, 
after the system wrongly deemed she owed $7,600.

Medical ethnographer Janet Hammill, 76, has spent decades researching the 
foetal origins of health and disease, and remains with the University of
Queensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland>, where she 
works voluntarily and lives off the age pension.

Hammill received a $26,000 research grant between July 2011 and April 2012, 
which she fully reported toCentrelink 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/centrelink> at the time.

But Centrelink’s automated debt recovery system 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/09/ombudsman-launches-investigation-into-centrelink-debt-recovery-crisis>
 appears to haveaveraged the grant across all 26 fortnights of 2012 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/13/internal-centrelink-records-reveal-flaws-behind-debt-recovery-system>
, before deeming her to have been significantly overpaid.

She has struggled to get on to anyone at Centrelink to explain, including 
using their overloaded phone system and confusing online system.

“You feel so helpless, I mean for heaven’s sakes, you can look through my CV 
and see that I’m not helpless,” Hammill said.

“But this puts you into another category of disempowerment. I can just imagine 
somebody who is not computer literate or is just managing to get by day to day, 
it’s just been so terribly frustrating,” she said.


“They made me feel as though I’m some sort of cheat, and I haven’t had an 
income since April 2012.”

Her case comes as the federal government implements changes to attempt to 
address criticism of itscontroversial automated debt recovery system

.


The human services minister, Alan Tudge, who last week said the system was 
working as it should, has directed the department to begin including 
Centrelink’s dedicated 1800 phone number for the compliance team in letters to 
welfare recipients.

The language in the letters will also be simplified and made clearer, he said. 

In cases where Centrelink has sent letters to the wrong address 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/13/internal-centrelink-records-reveal-flaws-behind-debt-recovery-system>
, the government will allow them to have an internal review before they are 
asked to begin paying back money.

The government will also use other records, such as the electoral roll, to 
ensure Centrelink’s letters are going to the right address, and will begin 
using registered mail to ensure the correspondence is received.

In a small number of cases, Centrelink will also call customers to ensure they 
have received the letters.

“One of the issues has been that on some occasions the address which 
Centrelink has on file hasn’t been an up-to-date one, and so the first that a 
person might hear about their debt notice is when there’s a debt collector on 
their doorstep,” Tudge said on 2GB radio in Sydney on Monday.

“Now we’re fixing that problem by ensuring that we’re going to be using 
multiple different addresses including a person’s electoral roll address and 
other addresses to ensure they do get that letter and do get the opportunity to 
update their record if they do believe, honestly, that they have a valid 
explanation for why there’s a discrepancy.”

Labor’s Linda Burney has described the changes as a backflip, made after weeks 
of claiming there was nothing wrong with the system.

Burney issued a statement on Monday questioning whether the next batch of 
Centrelink’s letters, due to go out this week, will incorporate the changes, 
and how they would apply to those already affected.

“After weeks of denial the minster has finally admitted what everyone else 
already knows: there are serious problems with the robo-debt program,” Burney 
said. “Admitting the stuff-up is only the first step, now he needs to apologise 
and take action to help those who have been tormented by false debt claims.”

Independent MP Andrew Wilkie said he had been told by several Centrelink staff 
that the government is failing to properly deal with thoseleft feeling suicidal 
by the system 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/05/centrelinks-debt-recovery-risks-would-have-been-known-at-senior-levels-ex-official>
.

Wilkie said Centrelink staff are supposed to refer those feeling suicidal to 
social workers, but the level of demand for help has made that near impossible.

He said such cases were instead being referred back to casual Centrelink 
employees on the agency’s general phone line, who have no training in suicide 
prevention. Wilkie, who says he has spoken to several Centrelink 
whistleblowers, haswritten to the Commonwealth ombudsman detailing the 
allegations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/21/ombudsman-asked-to-investigate-if-centrelink-wrongly-pursuing-welfare-debts>
.

He said staff are being given a quota for the retrieval of debts (six to 10 
debt notices a day) and discouraged from looking “too closely” at complex cases.


He said he had been told that Centrelink staff are being discouraged from 
pausing debt repayments in cases of financial hardship.

“The system’s a complete dud and must be fixed or binned,” Wilkie said.


“By knowingly issuing these questionable debt notices and collecting money 
that turns out not to be owed, this government is stealing from taxpayers,” he 
said.

But the department of human services have rejected Wilkie’s claims as 
inaccurate and misleading.

Department general manager for communications, Hank Jongen, said there had 
been no increase in social work referrals due to the new system.

“Staff are transferring calls to social workers where necessary as per our 
standard process and we are meeting our service standards,” Jongen said in a 
statement released on Monday afternoon.

“There have been no procedural issues with social workers being available.”

Jongen said all staff who were reviewing cases had received additional 
training, and that only skilled staff undertake decision-making.

He said all cases, including complex ones, are appropriately considered. 
Jongen rejected any notion that staff are given a quota for the raising of 
debts, and said financial hardship is taken into account.

Jongen also dismissed claims that the system had a 20% error rate. 

“Commentary on the department’s online compliance system continues to 
incorrectly say 20 per cent of letters are being issued in error,” he said.

“This is misleading and a misrepresentation of the process.”
