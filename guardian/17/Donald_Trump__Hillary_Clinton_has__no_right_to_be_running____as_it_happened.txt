the election. Current and former FBI officials described a chaotic internal 
climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey’s July decision 
not to recommend an indictment over Clinton’s maintenance of a private email 
server on which classified information transited. “The FBI is Trumpland,” said 
one current agent.

Conservative group calls for supreme court blockade if Hillary Clinton wins

A conservative lobbying organization is pressuring Republican senators to 
stonewall any supreme court nominees put forward byHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> if she is elected 
president, a move that would break with 150 years of tradition for the senate 
to hold up-or-down votes on any supreme court nominees.

The Hill reports 
<http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/304231-heritage-calling-for-supreme-court-blockade-if-clinton-wins>
 that Heritage Action, a conservative policy advocacy organization, urged at a 
morning briefing today for Republican senators to commit to leaving the supreme 
court without a ninth justice for as long as half a decade.

The supreme court has been functioning, semi-successfully, without a ninth 
justice since February, when conservative stalwart Antonin Scalia died 
unexpectedly. The senate has refused to consider President Barack Obama’s 
nominee, Merrick Garland, declaring that the next president should be given the 
opportunity to shape the nation’s highest court.

“You’ve seen John McCain and others talk about the need to not confirm any 
liberal nominated to the Supreme Court,” said Dan Holler, Heritage Action’s 
vice president of communications and government relations. “That’s exactly the 
right position to have.”

A moving note from Tim Kaine’s law-school housemate:

Thirty-five years ago a new roommate moved into the attic bedroom. We were 
both single and trying to figure out our future. My parents called and asked 
what I thought of him. Long distance calls were expensive, so my answer was 
short and to the point. Thirty-five years later we are both married, fathers of 
three adult children and experienced in our chosen fields. My parents still 
call to ask questions about Tim. Voice plans now allow for unlimited talk, but 
my brief answer has never changed: “He’s the best person I have ever met.”

Hillary Clinton: 'I want you to hold me accountable'

Closing out her address in Raleigh, North Carolina, Democratic presidential 
nomineeHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
said that “the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the hatred 
and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in history.”

“I believe America’s best days are still ahead of us if we do what we’re 
supposed to do,” Clinton concluded. “Every social movement, every economic 
advance, has only come about because people going to work and sacrifice and 
keep pushing forward in the affect of adversity.”

“It wasn’t easy to get the vote for women; it wasn’t easy to have the final 
efforts made to ensure that the Civil Rights Act was enforced; it wasn’t easy, 
because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us 
down,” Clinton continued. “It is now our turn, our turn to stand up to people 
like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push 
you back!”

“We are fundamentally a good nation - and we need to make sure we deliver on 
that promise,” Clinton urged the crowd. “You can make the difference - not only 
in who you elect, but in the agenda that those people then get to work. I want 
you to hold me accountable; I want you to be my partners.”

“Everything I’ve done started by listening to people - listening to hear your 
stories, what you’re worried about - and then working to bring people together 
to solve those issues,” Clinton said. “If you elect me next Tuesday, that is 
the kind of president I will be.”

“So, let me just mention a few of the ideas that we’ve been putting forward,” 
Clinton continued.

“This election’s been a lot more fun since we’ve been on the same side!” 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> said of 
Bernie Sanders in North Carolina, after being introduced by the Vermont senator 
as the best hope for progressivism.

“As Bernie said earlier this year, when people who care about progressive 
causes stand together, we win - and then we can get to work on making those 
causes into reality,” Clinton continued. “I am so excited about the election, 
about everything that we’re going to do together - and I’m especially pleased 
to have Pharrell here!”

“Every time I see him - which is not often enough,” Clinton says, of the 
musician, “he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often neglected 
and ignored.”

“Are you really, really, really, really happy that we’re here tonight?” 
Clinton asked the crowd, in reference to Pharrell’s hit Happy. “Well, we sure 
are! There’s nowhere we’d rather be!”

Closing out his speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, Vermont senator and 
Democratic presidential also-ran Bernie Sanders told an ecstatic college-aged 
crowd that electingHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is a crucial step in 
protecting the hard-fought civil rights that his supporters value.

“We can disagree on many issues - but we have come too far, too many people 
have gone to jail, too many people have died in the struggle for civil rights. 
We are not going back to a bigoted society. And furthermore,” Sanders 
continued. “what we understand is our strength, our uniqueness, is our 
diversity. We should be proud of it!”

“We are not going to allow Trump or anyone to divide us up!”

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders lauded Hillary Clinton’s stance on the 
environment, and drew contrasts with, well, differences with Donald Trump’s 
platform.

“There is one [difference] that is very, very profound,” Sanders said. 
“Secretary Clinton believes in science. And I know, I know I put her in a 
difficult position. In 2016, to believe in science is a little bit dangerous, 
but what the heck.

“The debate is over - climate change is real, climate change is caused by 
human activity, and climate change is already, today, causing devastating 
problems in this country and around the world.”

Trump, meanwhile, “has concluded that climate change is a hoax emanating from 
China. Now, why he chose China and not Mexico or some Muslim country, I don’t 
know, but that’s the way it is.”

“This is not a funny issue. I’ve got seven grandchildren,” Sanders continued. 
“Our job as custodians of this planet is to make sure that we leave our 
children and grandchildren a planet that is healthy and habitable. And that 
means that we have to have the guts to take on the fossil-fuel industry and 
tell them that their short-term profits are not more important than the future 
of our planet.”

the election. Current and former FBI officials described a chaotic internal 
climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey’s July decision 
not to recommend an indictment over Clinton’s maintenance of a private email 
server on which classified information transited. “The FBI is Trumpland,” said 
one current agent.

that Beyoncé will join husband Jay Z at a get-out-the-vote concert in Cleveland

The concert

 will be the penultimate event in a series under the title Love Trumps Hate, 
and is aimed at boosting voter engagement for African American youth. This is 
not the first time the Clinton campaign has recruited entertainment industry 
powerhouses. At the conclusion of the Democratic national convention in July, 
Lady Gaga and Lenny Kravitz performed for Democratic delegates in a thank-you 
concert held in Camden, New Jersey.

 that Heritage Action, a conservative policy advocacy organization, urged at a 
morning briefing today for Republican senators to commit to leaving the supreme 
court without a ninth justice for as long as half a decade.

The supreme court has been functioning, semi-successfully, without a ninth 
justice since February, when conservative stalwart Antonin Scalia died 
unexpectedly. The senate has refused to consider President Barack Obama’s 
nominee, Merrick Garland, declaring that the next president should be given the 
opportunity to shape the nation’s highest court.

“You’ve seen John McCain and others talk about the need to not confirm any 
liberal nominated to the Supreme Court,” said Dan Holler, Heritage Action’s 
vice president of communications and government relations. “That’s exactly the 
right position to have.”
 
A moving note from Tim Kaine’s law-school housemate:

Thirty-five years ago a new roommate moved into the attic bedroom. We were 
both single and trying to figure out our future. My parents called and asked 
what I thought of him. Long distance calls were expensive, so my answer was 
short and to the point. Thirty-five years later we are both married, fathers of 
three adult children and experienced in our chosen fields. My parents still 
call to ask questions about Tim. Voice plans now allow for unlimited talk, but 
my brief answer has never changed: “He’s the best person I have ever met.”
 
Closing out her address in Raleigh, North Carolina, Democratic presidential 
nomineeHillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> 
said that “the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the hatred 
and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in history.”

“I believe America’s best days are still ahead of us if we do what we’re 
supposed to do,” Clinton concluded. “Every social movement, every economic 
advance, has only come about because people going to work and sacrifice and 
keep pushing forward in the affect of adversity.”

“It wasn’t easy to get the vote for women; it wasn’t easy to have the final 
efforts made to ensure that the Civil Rights Act was enforced; it wasn’t easy, 
because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us 
down,” Clinton continued. “It is now our turn, our turn to stand up to people 
like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push 
you back!”

“We are fundamentally a good nation - and we need to make sure we deliver on 
that promise,” Clinton urged the crowd. “You can make the difference - not only 
in who you elect, but in the agenda that those people then get to work. I want 
you to hold me accountable; I want you to be my partners.”
 
“Everything I’ve done started by listening to people - listening to hear your 
stories, what you’re worried about - and then working to bring people together 
to solve those issues,” Clinton said. “If you elect me next Tuesday, that is 
the kind of president I will be.”

“So, let me just mention a few of the ideas that we’ve been putting forward,” 
Clinton continued.
 
“This election’s been a lot more fun since we’ve been on the same side!” 
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> said of 
Bernie Sanders in North Carolina, after being introduced by the Vermont senator 
as the best hope for progressivism.

“As Bernie said earlier this year, when people who care about progressive 
causes stand together, we win - and then we can get to work on making those 
causes into reality,” Clinton continued. “I am so excited about the election, 
about everything that we’re going to do together - and I’m especially pleased 
to have Pharrell here!”

“Every time I see him - which is not often enough,” Clinton says, of the 
musician, “he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often neglected 
and ignored.”

“Are you really, really, really, really happy that we’re here tonight?” 
Clinton asked the crowd, in reference to Pharrell’s hit Happy. “Well, we sure 
are! There’s nowhere we’d rather be!”
 
Watch it here live:
 
Closing out his speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, Vermont senator and 
Democratic presidential also-ran Bernie Sanders told an ecstatic college-aged 
crowd that electingHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> is a crucial step in 
protecting the hard-fought civil rights that his supporters value.

“We can disagree on many issues - but we have come too far, too many people 
have gone to jail, too many people have died in the struggle for civil rights. 
We are not going back to a bigoted society. And furthermore,” Sanders 
continued. “what we understand is our strength, our uniqueness, is our 
diversity. We should be proud of it!”

“We are not going to allow Trump or anyone to divide us up!”
 
Vermont senator Bernie Sanders lauded Hillary Clinton’s stance on the 
environment, and drew contrasts with, well, differences with Donald Trump’s 
platform.

“There is one [difference] that is very, very profound,” Sanders said. 
“Secretary Clinton believes in science. And I know, I know I put her in a 
difficult position. In 2016, to believe in science is a little bit dangerous, 
but what the heck.

“The debate is over - climate change is real, climate change is caused by 
human activity, and climate change is already, today, causing devastating 
problems in this country and around the world.”

Trump, meanwhile, “has concluded that climate change is a hoax emanating from 
China. Now, why he chose China and not Mexico or some Muslim country, I don’t 
know, but that’s the way it is.”

“This is not a funny issue. I’ve got seven grandchildren,” Sanders continued. 
“Our job as custodians of this planet is to make sure that we leave our 
children and grandchildren a planet that is healthy and habitable. And that 
means that we have to have the guts to take on the fossil-fuel industry and 
tell them that their short-term profits are not more important than the future 
of our planet.”
 
Donald Trump attempts to praise veterans:

I’m brave in other ways — I’m financially brave. Big deal.
 
Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, campaigning for Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> in Raleigh, North 
Carolina, hit hard on the subject of paid family leave, one of Clinton’s most 
committed policy planks.

“That is why Secretary Clinton and I will fight o guarantee 12 weeks paid 
family and medical leave!” Sanders vowed.
