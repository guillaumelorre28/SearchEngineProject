The number of hate crimes leaped by 41% in the month after the vote to leave 
theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, new Home Office 
statistics confirm.

A daily breakdown of the hate crime offences reported to the police showed the 
number of incidents doubled in the days after the referendum 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/08/police-record-3000-hate-incidents-weeks-around-referendum>
. The level peaked at 207 incidents on 1 July, twice as many as before the 
vote, when the level was already unusually high.

In July, there were 5,468 hate crimes – 41% higher than July 2015.

 A Home Office report on the data noted that the “sharp increase” in hate crime 
was not replicated in equivalent offences at the time.

“These increases fit the widely reported pattern of an increase in hate crime 
following the EU referendum,” it said.

 David Issac, chair of he Equality and Human Rights commission said the 
figures “make it very clear that some people used the referendum result to 
justify their deplorable views and promote intolerance and hatred.”

He called for collective effort “bring the country back together.” 

Data from 31 police forces showed that in the two weeks up to and including 
the day of the referendum on 23 June, forces recorded 1,546 racially or 
religiously aggravated offences.

In the fortnight immediately after the poll, the number climbed to 2,241. 
There was an increase in racially and religiously aggravated offences recorded 
in June, followed by an even sharper rise in July 2016.


Levels of hate crime and racist incidents have since declined but remain 
significantly higher than last year. Overall, there were 52,465 incidents of 
hate crime in the year ending March 2016, an increase of 19% on the previous 
year.

Despite the increases, the report confirmed that police chiefs will no longer 
collate weekly figures, because by August this year the levels of hate crime 
returned to those seen earlier in 2016.

The report says: “This analysis shows a clear increase following the 
referendum result. The number of racially or religiously aggravated offences 
then falls during August, with the number of offences at the end of August at a 
similar level seen prior to the referendum.”

The figures are the most detailed confirmation of a post-referendum spike in 
hate crime.

The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said: “Hatred has no place in a Britain that 
works for everyone and we are determined to stamp it out.”

 In a press briefing, the Home Office claimed the increase was largely a 
result of more people reporting hate crime and better police recording.


Rudd added: “I am pleased to see government action is working and that more 
victims are finding the confidence to come forward to report these crimes.”

“Our hate crime laws are among the best in the world, but we cannot be 
complacent. Our Hate Crime Action Plan, published in July, sets out how we are 
further reducing hate crime, increasing reporting and improving support for 
victims.”


The Liberal Democrats’ home affairs spokesman, Alistair Carmichael, said the 
spike in hate crime was due “to the nasty, divisive European referendum 
campaign”.

He said: “[Ukip leader Nigel] Farage stood next to dehumanising posters that 
depicted people as hordes and then stood back shocked that their fanning the 
flames of prejudice had a reaction.

“Our government is treating the post-referendum landscape in the same divisive 
way. Telling 16 million people they are ‘citizens of nowhere’ is beneath 
contempt and not a way to treat those who believe Britain should be at the 
heart of Europe.”

The figures come after a series of reports of an alarming increase in various 
forms of hate crime in the wake of the referendum.

On Sunday, the LGBT anti-violence charity Gallop reported a 147% increase in 
crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/08/homophobic-attacks-double-after-brexit-vote>
. Last month, Britain’s most senior police officer, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, 
said the “horrible spike” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/28/hate-crime-horrible-spike-brexit-vote-metropolitan-police>
 in hate crime after the vote was at least partly linked to the referendum.

A survey by the Guardian found that European embassies in Britain had logged 
dozens of incidents of suspected hate crime and abuse against their citizens 
since the referendum.

The vast majority of incidents involved citizens from eastern European 
countries, with more attacks against Poles than against all other nationalities 
put together.

They include the killing of Arkadiusz Jóźwik in Harlow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/31/harlow-death-arkadiusz-jozwik-exposes-left-behind-town-where-residents-live-in-fear>
 in an apparently unprovoked attack that is being treated by police as a 
possible hate crime. A second Polish man survived the attack.
