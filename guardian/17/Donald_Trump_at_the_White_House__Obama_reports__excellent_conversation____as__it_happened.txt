 * President-elect Donald Trump was accorded a chilly but deferential welcome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/barack-obama-donald-trump-white-house-meeting-transition>
 at the White House this morning as the president-elect met with President 
Barack Obama for a 90-minute private meeting in the Oval Office. In the first 
stage of a 72-day transition process between Tuesday’s unexpected election 
victory and Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, Obama said the two men 
discussed “foreign and domestic policy” and how to ensure the handover of power 
went smoothly. 
 * “I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to 
do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the 
country succeeds,” Obama told his successor during a brief photo opportunity 
afterwards.

 * Jihadis have welcomed Trump’s surprise victory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/islamic-extremists-welcome-donald-trump-victory>
 in the American presidential race, saying his election would sow greater 
division and expose what they described as the hatred and racism of the west 
towards Muslims. The endorsement of the election result by extreme Islamist 
figures highlighted fears that Trump’s divisive rhetoric and call to ban 
Muslims from entering the US could empower radicals who have argued that the 
west seeks Islam’s destruction and is at war with its adherents.

 * Tens of thousands of Americans held further protests and acts of dissent 
against the election after a wave of demonstrations across the US on Wednesday 
night in which dozens were arrested. Protesters began mobilizing in major 
cities for a third day after crowds had descended on Trump buildings in New 
York, Chicago and Washington into the early hours to rail against the shock 
election result.

 * There was a spate of claims of hate crimes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/hate-crime-spike-us-donald-trump-president>
 in the US made on social media and to police today, in which the alleged 
victims said abusers had in some way cited Donald Trump’s victory in the US 
presidential election.Social media was rife with accounts of sometimes violent 
incidents of hate targeted at Muslims, Latinos and African Americans.

 * Samantha Bee blamed white people for ruining America: 
 * And the Trump transition team put forward a few key team members: Scott

President-elect Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
reports that he had “great chemistry” with president Barack Obama:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good 
meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!

Given that Trump spent much of the mid-aughts attempting to prove that Obama 
was not born in the United States and was therefore constitutionally ineligible 
to serve as president, this is surprising.

Students at Cornell University held a “cry-in” after the election of 
president-electDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, 
according to the Ivy League school’s student-run newspaper, where roughly 20 
students met in the bleakness that is a November day in upstate New York to 
share tears, hugs and sorrows.

“I am concerned how this is validating the behavior of a lot of people,” a 
student sipping a cup of coffee said inthe Cornell Daily Sun’s video 
<https://www.facebook.com/cornellsun/>, of the election.

“I’m quite terrified, honestly,” another student said. “It’s saying that 
people are really given into fear-mongering - they’re willing to put people 
down based on their identity just so that they would feel vindicated that they 
would be getting rid of ‘Crooked Hillary.’”

“I’d say the results are heartbreaking and such a slap in the face to so many 
of the populations that make up America,” a professor said. “I think it’s also 
an indication that there and many many people who are suffering and feel that 
haven’t been heard and they believe that Trump will answer their needs.”

Lawyers ask for Trump University trial to be delayed until next year

Donald Trump’s attorney told a federal judge on Thursday that he’s open to 
settlement talks in a class-action fraud lawsuit involving the president-elect 
and his now-defunct Trump University.


Attorney Daniel Petrocelli also asked during a hearing that the trial be 
delayed until early next year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-university-trial-request-delay-denied>
 because Trump needs time to work on the transition to the presidency.

The lawsuit alleging Trump University failed on its promise to teach success 
in real estate is currently set to begin 28 November in San Diego.


Petrocelli said he agreed to an offer by US district court Judge Gonzalo 
Curiel to have US district Judge Jeffrey Miller work with both sides on a 
possible settlement.

“I can tell you right now I’m all ears,” Petrocelli told Curiel.

Petrocelli said he planned to file a formal request for a delay by Monday.

Curiel didn’t say how he would rule but encouraged efforts to settle.

Petrocelli said it didn’t appear possible for Trump to attend the trial, and 
Curiel said he didn’t expect attendance by the president-elect.

“We’re in uncharted territory. We need a little bit of time,” Petrocelli said.

Earlier in the day Curiel, the Indiana-born jurist who was accused of bias by 
Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/judge-accused-by-trump-of-bias-to-hold-university-case-pre-trial-hearing>
 over his Mexican heritage, tentatively denied a request to ban statements made 
by and about Trump during his campaign from being used at the trial.

The highly unusual petition would apply to Trump’s tweets, a video of Trump

Arizona senator Jeff Flake, speaking with MSNBC’s Chuck Todd about the 
impending Trump administration,told the Meet the Press host 
<http://www.msnbc.com/mtp-daily/watch/sen-flake-on-trump-we-ve-seen-all-good-signs-so-far-806067267734>
 that although he opposed Trump during the campaign, “there are a lot of things 
that we agree on” and that Trump has, so far, been “gracious” to his vanquished 
and/or conquered opponents.

“I think all of us who have opposed him during the process of [have eaten] a 
huge helping of crow already,” said the Republican senator. “I didn’t think 
that he would get this far, I really didn’t.”

“When there are areas of disagreement and there may be some, there will be 
some, we’ll push back,” Flake continued. “But in the meantime, there are a lot 
of things that we agree on. I think he’s been gracious so far in terms of 
outreach and has done it right so far. And we’ll see where we go.”

Associated Press calls Arizona for Donald Trump

President-elect Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
has officially won the traditionally red state of Arizona, two days after 
election night.
Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Donald Trump wins Arizona two days after Election Day.
 <https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/796875848720773120> November 11, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/796875848720773120> 
Heavy Latino turnout in the Grand Canyon State, as well as young people 
encouraged by a ballot initiative that would have regulated marijuana like 
alcohol, contributed to a massive groundswell of Democratic support, but 
apparently not enough for defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to win 
the state.

Former president Bill Clinton has made a quick phone call to president-elect 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, wishing the 
newly minted 45th president of the United States and his wife’s former 
political rival well.

“During the brief call, President Clinton congratulated Mr. Trump and wished 
him well,” an aide to Clinton told ABC’s Liz Kreutz.

Because it’s 2016 and thus forbidden for a day to go past without an open 
letter appearing somewhere,here’s another one 
<http://www.vox.com/first-person/2016/11/10/13580582/leslie-knope-donald-trump>
. This time it’s written by a fictional character, if that helps any: Leslie 
Knope, the relentlessly positive public servant from Park and Recreation, 
played by Amy Poehler. Upbeat, yes. Positive: not so much.

 I do not accept it.


I acknowledge that Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is the president. I 
understand, intellectually, that he won the election. But I do not accept that 
our country has descended into the hatred-swirled slop pile that he lives in. I 
reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to 
racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and crypto-fascism.

I do not accept that. I reject that. I fight that. Today, and tomorrow, and 
every day until the next election, I reject and fight that story.

 * President-elect Donald Trump was accorded a chilly but deferential welcome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/barack-obama-donald-trump-white-house-meeting-transition>
 at the White House this morning as the president-elect met with President 
Barack Obama for a 90-minute private meeting in the Oval Office. In the first 
stage of a 72-day transition process between Tuesday’s unexpected election 
victory and Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, Obama said the two men 
discussed “foreign and domestic policy” and how to ensure the handover of power 
went smoothly. 
 * “I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to 
do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the 
country succeeds,” Obama told his successor during a brief photo opportunity 
afterwards.

 * Jihadis have welcomed Trump’s surprise victory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/islamic-extremists-welcome-donald-trump-victory>
 in the American presidential race, saying his election would sow greater 
division and expose what they described as the hatred and racism of the west 
towards Muslims. The endorsement of the election result by extreme Islamist 
figures highlighted fears that Trump’s divisive rhetoric and call to ban 
Muslims from entering the US could empower radicals who have argued that the 
west seeks Islam’s destruction and is at war with its adherents.

 * Tens of thousands of Americans held further protests and acts of dissent 
against the election after a wave of demonstrations across the US on Wednesday 
night in which dozens were arrested. Protesters began mobilizing in major 
cities for a third day after crowds had descended on Trump buildings in New 
York, Chicago and Washington into the early hours to rail against the shock 
election result.

 * There was a spate of claims of hate crimes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/hate-crime-spike-us-donald-trump-president>
 in the US made on social media and to police today, in which the alleged 
victims said abusers had in some way cited Donald Trump’s victory in the US 
presidential election.Social media was rife with accounts of sometimes violent 
incidents of hate targeted at Muslims, Latinos and African Americans.

Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott told ABC Radio National that the 
US and UK elections and Brexit vote show that the non-politically correctdon’t 
want to tell pollsters what they really think 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/11/tony-abbott-us-election-trump-polls>
 because they would face “excoriation.”

Tony Abbott: Trump fans weren’t upfront with pollsters over fear of abuse

President-elect Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
has made his first swipe at the political media in his new role:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional 
protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!

President-elect Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
reports that he had “great chemistry” with president Barack Obama:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good 
meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!

Given that Trump spent much of the mid-aughts attempting to prove that Obama 
was not born in the United States and was therefore constitutionally ineligible 
to serve as president, this is surprising.
 
Students at Cornell University held a “cry-in” after the election of 
president-electDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, 
according to the Ivy League school’s student-run newspaper, where roughly 20 
students met in the bleakness that is a November day in upstate New York to 
share tears, hugs and sorrows.

“I am concerned how this is validating the behavior of a lot of people,” a 
student sipping a cup of coffee said inthe Cornell Daily Sun’s video 
<https://www.facebook.com/cornellsun/>, of the election.

“I’m quite terrified, honestly,” another student said. “It’s saying that 
people are really given into fear-mongering - they’re willing to put people 
down based on their identity just so that they would feel vindicated that they 
would be getting rid of ‘Crooked Hillary.’”

“I’d say the results are heartbreaking and such a slap in the face to so many 
of the populations that make up America,” a professor said. “I think it’s also 
an indication that there and many many people who are suffering and feel that 
haven’t been heard and they believe that Trump will answer their needs.”

 
Donald Trump’s attorney told a federal judge on Thursday that he’s open to 
settlement talks in a class-action fraud lawsuit involving the president-elect 
and his now-defunct Trump University.


Attorney Daniel Petrocelli also asked during a hearing that the trial be 
delayed until early next year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-university-trial-request-delay-denied>
 because Trump needs time to work on the transition to the presidency.

The lawsuit alleging Trump University failed on its promise to teach success 
in real estate is currently set to begin 28 November in San Diego.


Petrocelli said he agreed to an offer by US district court Judge Gonzalo 
Curiel to have US district Judge Jeffrey Miller work with both sides on a 
possible settlement.

“I can tell you right now I’m all ears,” Petrocelli told Curiel.

Petrocelli said he planned to file a formal request for a delay by Monday.

Curiel didn’t say how he would rule but encouraged efforts to settle.

Petrocelli said it didn’t appear possible for Trump to attend the trial, and 
Curiel said he didn’t expect attendance by the president-elect.

“We’re in uncharted territory. We need a little bit of time,” Petrocelli said.

Earlier in the day Curiel, the Indiana-born jurist who was accused of bias by 
Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/judge-accused-by-trump-of-bias-to-hold-university-case-pre-trial-hearing>
 over his Mexican heritage, tentatively denied a request to ban statements made 
by and about Trump during his campaign from being used at the trial.

The highly unusual petition would apply to Trump’s tweets, a video of Trump 
making sexually predatory comments about women, his tax history, revelations 
about his private charitable foundation and the public criticism of the judge.

Arizona senator Jeff Flake, speaking with MSNBC’s Chuck Todd about the 
impending Trump administration,told the Meet the Press host 
<http://www.msnbc.com/mtp-daily/watch/sen-flake-on-trump-we-ve-seen-all-good-signs-so-far-806067267734>
 that although he opposed Trump during the campaign, “there are a lot of things 
that we agree on” and that Trump has, so far, been “gracious” to his vanquished 
and/or conquered opponents.

“I think all of us who have opposed him during the process of [have eaten] a 
huge helping of crow already,” said the Republican senator. “I didn’t think 
that he would get this far, I really didn’t.”

“When there are areas of disagreement and there may be some, there will be 
some, we’ll push back,” Flake continued. “But in the meantime, there are a lot 
of things that we agree on. I think he’s been gracious so far in terms of 
outreach and has done it right so far. And we’ll see where we go.”
 
President-elect Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> 
has officially won the traditionally red state of Arizona, two days after 
election night.

Heavy Latino turnout in the Grand Canyon State, as well as young people 
encouraged by a ballot initiative that would have regulated marijuana like 
alcohol, contributed to a massive groundswell of Democratic support, but 
apparently not enough for defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to win 
the state.
 
Former president Bill Clinton has made a quick phone call to president-elect 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, wishing the 
newly minted 45th president of the United States and his wife’s former 
political rival well.

“During the brief call, President Clinton congratulated Mr. Trump and wished 
him well,” an aide to Clinton told ABC’s Liz Kreutz.

Trump had long used Clinton’s personal peccadilloes as ammunition against the 
former secretary of state.

Because it’s 2016 and thus forbidden for a day to go past without an open 
letter appearing somewhere,here’s another one 
<http://www.vox.com/first-person/2016/11/10/13580582/leslie-knope-donald-trump>
. This time it’s written by a fictional character, if that helps any: Leslie 
Knope, the relentlessly positive public servant from Park and Recreation, 
played by Amy Poehler. Upbeat, yes. Positive: not so much.

 I do not accept it.


I acknowledge that Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> is the president. I 
understand, intellectually, that he won the election. But I do not accept that 
our country has descended into the hatred-swirled slop pile that he lives in. I 
reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to 
racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and crypto-fascism.

I do not accept that. I reject that. I fight that. Today, and tomorrow, and 
every day until the next election, I reject and fight that story.
