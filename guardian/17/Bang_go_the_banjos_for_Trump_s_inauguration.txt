The generally astute Marina Hyde betrays a lacuna in her usually sound musical 
knowledge in suggesting that the player onDueling Banjos 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dueling_Banjos> might be booked for Trump’s 
inaugural (6 January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/lostinshowbiz/2017/jan/05/stars-wont-do-presidential-inauguration-hand-to-family-von-trump>
). That musician was Eric Weissberg who, like myself, attendedThe Little Red 
School House in Greenwich Village <https://www.lrei.org/> where all us little 
reds went. Unless he has completely shed the politics that obtained in our 
school days, he would be the last person who would want anything to do with 
Trump.

• “Michelle Obama calls on America’s youth to live in hope and rise above 
fear” (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/06/michelle-obama-legacy-first-lady>
, 7 January) – illustrated by “eight years of style” and five photographs of 
different outfits. You should be ashamed of yourselves.

•  Re Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin> should we anticipate a 
statement from the president-elect: “I did not have international relations 
with that man.”

• While Sam Cowen may mock the concept of an asparagu (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/04/did-you-hear-the-one-about-a-father-in-law>
, 4 January), broccoli is clearly a plural Italian word and I cannot find 
anyone who can tell me what a broccolo is.

• Why describe the potential 5,000 sq km Larsen C iceberg as being “a 
quarter the size of Wales” (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/giant-iceberg-poised-to-break-off-from-antarctic-shelf-larsen-c>
, 7 January). As Wales is 20,779 sq km, a quarter would be 5,194. 
Northumberland measures 5,013 sq km, and would surely therefore be a far better 
unit of comparison.

• Going through some very old files, I discovered pages from the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/archive-educational-resource-april-2012>
 of 1 April 1977. Scientists calculated that San Serriffe would collide with 
Sri Lanka on 3 January 2011. I wondered if the date for this collision had been 
recalculated.
