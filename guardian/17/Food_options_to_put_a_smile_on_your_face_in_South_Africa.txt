Are you constantly on the lookout for the next hot restaurant, or do you take 
your culinary pleasure from eating on the street? Do you appreciate history, 
heritage and artisanal methods, or would you rather be wowed by Heston-style 
food theatrics? Maybe you are just looking for a decent plate of food? Whatever 
it is you seek, you’re in safe hands in South Africa.

Try a farmers’ market
You can’t swing an aubergine without hitting a food market in South Africa. In 
Cape Town, theOranjezicht City Farm <http://www.ozcf.co.za> is a non-profit 
project that celebrates local food, culture and community through urban 
farming. You can shop for organic vegetables and local street food at its 
weekly market, held in the scenic suburb of Granger Bay, adjacent to the 
Victoria and Alfred Waterfront (Saturday, 9am-2pm). Alternatively, you can 
visit the farm itself, located just outside the city (Monday-Friday 8am-4pm, 
Saturday 8am–1pm). TheNeighbourgoods Market  <http://neighbourgoodsmarket.co.za>
meanwhile (Saturday 9am-2pm) is another must-visit. Sprawling across the Old 
Biscuit Mill in the industrial neighbourhood of Woodstock, it offers fusion 
food and fun deli gifts. Its sister market takes place in Johannesburg 
(Saturday 9am-3pm) in the bustling creative neighbourhood of Braamfontein.

 Neighbourgoods Market serves up local produce in both Cape Town and 
Johannesburg 
Enjoy Jo’burg’s fast-growing food scene 
Johannesburg isn’t well known for its fine dining, but that’s changing. Visit 
now and catch a city in transition, where young chefs such as Angelo Scirocco 
and hisUrbanologi <http://www.urbanologi.co.za/> restaurant are making a name 
for themselves and establishing a new culinary identity. In Maboneng, a 
regenerated downtown area full of artists’ studios and boutiques, very 
different but equally impressive outlets knock up everything from sushi to 
shakshuka.

 Experimental eating at The Test Kitchen 
Don’t forget township food 
The street food found in the townships of South Africa is well worth sampling, 
as it’s where some of the most original flavours of the country can be found. 
You might be put off when confronted with a charred sheep’s head: it’s locally 
known as a “smiley”, but it’s delicious, as iskota (bread hollowed out and with 
a variety of fillings), and seven-colour rainbow rice. There are also plenty of 
opportunities to get involved with the thriving “bring-and-braai” scene, known 
asshisha nyama (a Zulu term for an informal barbecue). Try it all.

Get experimental in Cape Town 
Chef Luke Dale Roberts is almost deified in the Cape Town food community – by 
those who want to eat at the experimental edge. Sitting down to the experience 
of an eight-course set menu atThe Test Kitchen 
<http://www.thetestkitchen.co.za/>, you’re guaranteed to find novelty in his 
inventive ways with food. It’s symptomatic of Cape Town’s culinary standing – 
the city has always had a reputation for great eating, but now its chefs are on 
an urgent quest for new frontiers. Heston fans can get their kicks here.

Wherever you are, try South African meat 
Sorry veggies! Chefs and eaters all agree that in South Africa, meat is a star 
ingredient. And it isn’t just standard beef steak, either: springbok, kudu, 
impala and black wildebeest are all on the menu. “The quality of meat in South 
Africa is incredible and we are seeing a stronger focus on ethically farmed 
animals,” says Sam Linsell, Cape Town-based food blogger and author of the 
Drizzle & Dip cookbook (Instagram:instagram.com/drizzleanddip 
<https://www.instagram.com/drizzleanddip/>). “Game meat, which is naturally 
free-range, is also easily available. Lamb from the Karoo now has its own 
certification, too.”

Taste some award-winning cheese 
South Africa is not known for its cheese, but at the Klein River Farmstead 
<http://kleinrivercheese.co.za/>, a two-hour drive from Cape Town, you can 
taste some award-winning varieties. Cheese fans will be impressed by the 
offering, which is part-influenced by the Dutch heritage of the area, and the 
artisanal production methods. The opportunity to have a huge cheese and wine 
picnic on the scenic banks of the nearby Klein river makes this a memorable 
trip.

 Head out to the wine country at the Waterkloof Estate 
Dine in the winelands 
A visit to the wine country is worth it for the food alone. At the Waterkloof 
winery <http://www.waterkloofwines.co.za/> you can sit in a suspended 
glass-walled dining room and look out over the landscape, while enjoying top 
chef Gregory Czarnecki’s award-winning menu (and, go on, a drop of biodynamic 
wine, too). Or stop byThe Table <http://www.thetablerestaurant.co.za/>, an 
entirely outdoor restaurant on a farm at the heart of Stellenbosch, where the 
menu prepared depends on what has been harvested from the vegetable garden.
