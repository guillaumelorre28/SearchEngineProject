Britain may have voted to leave the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, but its short-term fate still lies 
predominantly in the hands of foreigners, according to a new Brexit “power 
list” that attempts to measure who wields the most clout in the tricky 
negotiations to come.

Theresa May and Germany’s Angela Merkel jointly share top spot in the Brexit50 
ranking 
<http://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/Brochure-Brexit-50.pdf>
 – drawn up by a panel of independent experts – as befits their respective 
roles as Britain and Europe’s most powerful politicians.

Yet key UK ministers including Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> and Liam Fox trail far behind 
lesser-known officials whose influence over the process is deemed likely to be 
far more influential.

The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier

, andDidier Seeuws 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/belgian-diplomat-to-head-eus-brexit-taskforce>
, a Belgian diplomat placed in charge of the European council’s “Brexit 
taskforce”, are the highest ranked non-politicians, in fourth and 11th places, 
while the UK foreign secretary and international trade secretary languish in 
21st and 19th spots respectively. As Brussels bureaucrats are fond of 
observing, process is power.

David Davis, the UK secretary of state for exiting the EU, lies only eighth, 
behind the chancellor, Philip Hammond (seventh), and Scotland’s first minister,
Nicola Sturgeon <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon> (third), 
who are seen as important moderating forces on the process.

While the methodology of the 18-strong panel 
<http://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/Brexit50-Panel-members.pdf>
 of international experts who drew up the list for the European media network
EurActiv <http://www.euractiv.com/> will be open to challenge, the process of 
voting on which figures to include has underlined how much leverage over the 
terms of Brexit clearly lies across the channel.

Half of those who made the list are from other EU countries while Brits 
feature 22 times, and Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch and the Bank of England 
governor – Mark Carney, a Canadian – round out a small group of non-Europeans 
deemed to have sway.
Brits v non-Brits

It is not just European national leaders who wield significant veto power. Guy 
Verhofstadt, a leader of the European parliament, reaches 10th place in the 
list due to the parliament’s power to potentially block any deal.

Among the British figures included in the list are Gina Miller, a campaigner 
to remain whose legal challengereaches the UK supreme court next week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules>
, and Patience Wheatcroft, a former journalist who is leading opposition in the 
House of Lords.

“This unprecedented political divorce will be hugely important to the futures 
of both sides of the split,” said the EurActiv editor, Daniela Vincenti. She 
said the ranking highlighted the “movers and shakers that will play a key role 
in this process for months and years ahead”.
