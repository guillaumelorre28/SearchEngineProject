Three officials were arrested Monday for leaking a chemistry exam paper to 
students, which forced the test to be cancelled for the second time for the 
same reason.


Education authorities in southern Karnataka state last week cancelled the exam 
just hours before it was due to start after a student tipped them off about the 
leak.

The cancellation lead to violent protests by the class 12 students, who were 
initially meant to sit the test on 21 March but a leak of that paper caused the 
exam to be delayed.

“We have arrested three persons over the leaking of question papers. We are 
probing the role of many more,” Sonia Narang, head of the criminal 
investigation department told AFP.

One of the arrested officials is a personal assistant to the medical education 
minister in the state government, she said.

An estimated 174,000 candidates were due to sit the pre-university course test 
across the state.

Media reports said 40 education department employees had been suspended 
following the scandal.

The leaked paper was sold for as little as 1,000 rupees ($15) on the Whatsapp 
messaging service, police said.

The agitated students attacked the office of the examining body over the 
weekend in Bangalore city, which has said the test will now take place on 12 
April.

, including the paying large bribes to buy test papers.

Last year hundreds of parents and relatives were arrested in eastern Bihar 
state for scaling the walls of schools and providing crib sheets and study 
material to students during exams.

Last month authorities in western state of Gujarat blocked mobile phone 
Internet services in many districts to stop candidates from cheating during a 
public sector jobs test.
