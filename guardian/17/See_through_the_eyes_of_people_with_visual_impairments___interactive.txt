Kevin Bradley (32), Leeds: diabetic retinopathy


“I was 12 when I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, but was diagnosed with 
retinopathy about two years ago. Within 20 years, 95% of diabetics will have 
some sort of retinopathy issues, so I’m coming up to that 20-year mark now.

“About four months ago I had a permanent blind spot in my left eye, at about 
10 o’clock, just off-centre. After two weeks it was still there and I thought, 
‘that’s it - it’s going to be there forever’, but a week later it had gone. 
They come and go.

“Colour-wise, a blind spot is grey. You know when you close your eyes, and 
look through your eyelids? That’s the kind of colour it is.

“It could get very bad in the future, but there’s nothing I can do about it, 
apart from controlling my diabetes as best I can. I can only get on with it.”

 About diabetic retinopathy
As the name suggests, this condition is a complication caused by diabetes, 
where high blood sugar levels damage the retina at the back of the eye. It can 
cause blindness if left undiagnosed or untreated.

John Bowler (87), London: age-related macular degeneration (AMD)

“They used to call me Hawkeye in the army. I was born in Africa, and I put my 
good vision down to the long distances you could see. It did come as a blow 
when I found out I had dry AMD, but by then I was probably about 70 and you get 
a little bit stoic – I didn’t expect to live to 87!

“I’m down to one eye now – central vision in my left eye. I don’t know why 
this one went first. It was probably the one I overused most in the old days. 
It’s amazing how you can accommodate. I used to love reading and I find that 
tedious now – I really need a magnifying glass. It curtails your activities 
somewhat.

“With my distance glasses, I could still drive but I gave up at the end of 
March. My insurance, my tax, everything was running out and I thought, this is 
trying to tell me something. I’d hate to cause some innocent bystander harm by 
not seeing something out of the corner of my eye.

“It’s made me appreciate my eyesight more, absolutely. You make use of what 
you’ve got. What else can you do in the human condition? You can’t just turn 
your toes up, stay indoors and go mouldy can you?

“To quote a favourite phrase of Winston Churchill: ‘keep buggering on’.”

About AMD
AMD comes in two forms – wet and dry. Dry AMD is caused by a build-up of 
deposits underneath the central part of the retina, responsible for the eye’s 
central vision (what you see when looking straight ahead). The condition 
usually worsens and your central vision becomes more blurred over time. Wet AMD 
occurs when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the retina, leaking tiny 
quantities of fluid and blood, causing damage to the cells. The damage may be 
rapid and severe. The majority of people with AMD have the dry form, but it is 
possible to have both dry and wet AMD in the same eye.
