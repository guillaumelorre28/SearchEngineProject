From butterflies to plain old flies, south-east Queensland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> is experiencing a 
two-phase swarm of insects amid weather conditions that allow both species to 
thrive.

Last Friday residents began reporting a sudden surge of butterflies, an influx 
of tens of millions of caper whites in what experts said was a phenomenon that 
occurred about once a decade.

As the butterflies’ numbers began thinning this week, they were set to be 
replaced by a less majestic spectacle: myriad black flies prompted by a warm 
spring after a wet winter.

The presence of the caper whites was the result of a mass migration from west 
of the Dividing Range from insects looking to lay eggs. The migration was an 
annual event but this year took place at a scale seen once every six to 10 
years.

Residents took to social media remarking on the spectacle, one joking it was 
“snowing butterflies”, others struggling to capture the flurry of tiny white 
dots with their cameras.

Ross Kendall, a butterfly farmer based in Indooroopilly in Brisbane’s west, 
told the Courier-Mail <http://www.couriermail.com.au/> the uncommon number of 
butterflies across the city could be a result of heavier rainfall out west.

“If the season is right out west of the divide they breed up into the 
millions,” he said. “Last year we didn’t get a big migration, but I think we 
are seeing more because of good rain out west.”

Christine Lambkin, the entomology curator for Queensland Museum, has said 
there are no simple explanations for waves of butterflies.

But Lambkin said in a 2015 blog that they could relate to hot and humid 
conditions, which provided “perfect flying weather for butterflies as they 
don’t need to consume as much energy to keep warm and hydrated”.

Brisbane’s peak temperatures at the weekend moved to above 34C, followed by 
several thunderstorms this week.

Parts of Queensland are expected to swelter on Thursday, with some areas 
predicted to hit top temperatures well above average. The area around Ipswich 
and Amberley is expected to top out at 38 degrees.

Lambkin told the ABC 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-08/conditions-ripe-for-flies-swarming-brisbane-homes/8004504>
 that the weekend weather had also provided perfect weather for twin pests for 
Brisbane households: house flies (Musca domestica) and bush flies (Musca 
vetustissima).

“The conditions were perfect last weekend and I think they’ve all broke out of 
their pupal cases after developing over our damp winter,” she said. “Most 
insects respond to the time of year — and when it’s spring, insects decide to 
become adults.”

Lambkin said Australia had an estimated 28,000 species of flies but only a 
quarter had scientific names to date.
