Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

I am an international student planning to study in the UK with a view to a 
career in fashion. According to my visa (Tier 4), as I understand it, I am not 
allowed to work during the course – I am only eligible to do so in holidays and 
during seasonal breaks. I want to know if there are any summer internships I 
could apply for in fashion.

I have seen a lot of online profiles of people who have proudly listed 
two-month internships at Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Harrods and so on, but although I 
have been scouring every advert I can find, these opportunities seem very rare. 
How do I find them?
