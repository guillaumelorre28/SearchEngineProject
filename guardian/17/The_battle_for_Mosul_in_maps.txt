In June 2014, when the leader of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared a global 
caliphate, he did it from Mosul, Iraq’s second city. Isis rapidly expanded its 
territory in Iraq and Syria throughout that year, but has since been gradually 
pushed back, partly due toUS-led airstrikes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/jan/08/us-led-airstrikes-against-islamic-state-syria-iraq-interactive-isis>
. Losing Mosul now could spell the end of the jihadi group’s ability to control 
large swaths of Iraq.

The long-awaited operation to take back Mosul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mosul> began on 16 October, involving a 
coalition of more than 30,000 troops drawn from Iraqi army forces, Kurdish 
peshmerga fighters and Shia militias, supported by airstrikes from a US-led 
coalition. Turkish forces are also involved despite Iraqi government opposition.

Around 6,000 Isis fighters could be holed up in the city among more than a 
million civilians

It was agreed that only the Iraqi army would enter Mosul, due to fears its 
mainly Sunni inhabitants would see the Kurdish and Shia forces as too partisan.

Week one: multi-pronged attack begins


After one week, progress was made to the north, south and east of Mosul 
despite Isis using a variety of defensive tactics. Advancing forces faced 
roadside bombs, dug-in snipers, fleets of suicide car bombs and oil fire haze. 
The jihadis also launched diversionary attacks,most significantly in Kirkuk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/kirkuk-police-compound-under-attack-militants-iraq-isis-mosul>
. It was also reported that Isis fighters were forcing people from the 
countryside into the cityto use as human shields 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/islamic-state-uses-hostages-as-human-shields-mosul-says-un>
. Most progress was made east of the city, where Iraqi forces took the baton 
from the peshmerga who overwhelmed several villages in the first few days of 
fighting. A southern push by Iraqi army troops and Shia militias lagged behind 
the faster-moving eastern axis.

Week two: city limits reached 

Iraqi special forces reached Mosul’s eastern edge on 31 October after just 
over two weeks of fighting along the main Irbil road. Footholds were 
established in districts such as Gogjali and Karama before the westward 
offensive resumed on 4 November in the face of heavy Isis resistance. Advancing 
troops are expected to face a brutal street fight in heavily mined terrain, 
with booby-trapped bridges and Isis fighters concealed in tunnels. This may yet 
extend the operation’s length to the months forecast in many initial estimates.

Week six: awaiting a breakthrough

Anti-Isis forces have effectively surrounded Mosul after more than six weeks 
of fighting but most observers expect the battle to last into 2017. The only 
Iraqi units inside the city are making slow progress in eastern districts, 
where Isis forces are fighting hard in areas where large numbers of civilians 
are still present. About 70,000 refugees are living in camps mainly to the 
north-east of Mosul but their numbers could swell if conditions deteriorate 
further inside the city. Fighting hascut off water supplies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/fighting-around-mosul-isis-city-without-water-pipe-line-hit-siege-iraq>
 for about 650,000 people and the UN has said a siege-like situation is 
developing. Food supplies have dwindled since Shia militia cut off the main 
corridor to Isis territory in Syria but the Iraqi government has discouraged 
them from taking the strategic town of Tel Afar, which may have raised 
sectarian tensions with its mainly Turkoman residents.

Week 14: Iraqi forces near to splitting city

A pincer movement by the Iraqi government’s Counter Terrorism Service is 
aiming to clear Isis fighters from the east bank of the river Tigris. Elite CTS 
forces seized control of the large Mosul University complex, which Isis 
fighters used as a base, on 15 January. Meanwhile other units have pushed north 
along the river after establishing their first bridgehead on 8 January. The 
offensive waseffectively relaunched 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/29/iraqi-troops-resume-push-to-take-mosul-from-isis-after-two-week-lull>
 at the end of 2016 when troops from other positions were redeployed, along 
with US special forces, to bolster the main lines of attack in east Mosul. This 
enabled the CTS to advance afterstruggling for weeks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/05/battle-for-mosul-stalls-islamic-state-stronghold-iraq>
 to move beyond suburbs reached earlier in the operation.

Tigris river are currently inoperable. Photograph: Khalid Mohammed/AP 
Iraqi forces now control the eastern side of three bridges over the Tigris but 
none are currently operational. All river crossings were partially destroyed by 
US-led airstrikes aimed at hampering Isis logistics but will now need repairing 
for an assault on the densely populated west bank where heavy Isis resistance 
and several more months of fighting likely awaits.
