Almost 100 dogs and cats have been rescued from appalling conditions at an 
allegedQueensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> puppy 
farm littered with the corpses of dead animals.

Detectives have interviewed a man after they teamed up with the RSPCA to raid 
an outback Queensland property where they said they found 81 dogs and puppies 
and 10 cats, some malnourished and injured.

The breeds included pitbulls, American staffordshire bull terriers and French 
bulldogs, a very popular breed that can sell for thousands of dollars.

On Monday authorities went to the property on Bosjnack Road at Glenarbon, in 
south-west Queensland, with a search warrant.

“The conditions the dogs and cats were being kept in were very disturbing,” 
the RSPCA Queensland chief inspector, Daniel Young, said.

“There was inadequate shelter and water and a number of the dogs were carrying 
injuries that needed urgent veterinary treatment.”

One dog was being kept in a small space beside a dead dog and other dog 
corpses were found near tethered dogs, Young said.

Police and the RSPCA were interviewing a 40-year-old man who was due to face 
Goondiwindi magistrates’ court on other matters.

The rescued animals were transferred to the RSPCA’s Queensland headquarters at 
Wacol.

Anyone who believes they may have purchased an animal from the property has 
been urged to contact police.
