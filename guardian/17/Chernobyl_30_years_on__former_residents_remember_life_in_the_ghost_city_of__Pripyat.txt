In a biting winter wind, Alexander Petrovich Zabirchenko walks slowly along a 
memorial to firefighters and workers who died inthe Chernobyl nuclear disaster 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/guides/456900/456957/html/nn1page1.stm>, 
touching each of the portraits engraved in granite. He does not shiver or 
complain of the cold. He is a big man and draws himself up to his full height 
before each sombre stone.

“Here is Valeri, and here Vladimir and Alexandr and Anatoli … I knew these 
men,” he says. “I worked with them. They were colleagues and friends.”

As one of the many Chernobyl workers who returned to the devastated plant to 
fight the fires, Zabirchenko is an official “Hero of the Soviet Union 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union>”. He bats away the 
honour with a wave of his hand.

“These men were the heroes; every one of them. They died preventing an even 
bigger disaster. They saved not justUkraine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine>, Russia or the Soviet Union as it 
was, but the whole of Europe.”

Next month, thousands of men, women and children in the northern Ukrainian 
city of Slavutych, will gather at the memorial here to light candles to the 30 
initial victims of the world’s worst nuclear accident. Three decades on, they 
will remember not just the dead, but the memories and dreams they left behind 
in Pripyat, the ghost city that was once their home.

The story of Pripyat and Slavutych is a tale of twin cities: Pripyat, a former 
model Soviet metropolis built to house Chernobyl workers butabandoned to 
radioactive contamination 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/29/chernobyl-desolation-camera-drone>
 and the ravages of nature; Slavutych, an urban phoenix that rose from the 
ashes of the disaster to replace it.


If Pripyat represents destruction, defeat, a lost city, a dead city – then 
Slavutych is the resurrection
Volodimir Udovichenko 
It took 36 hours after an ill-judged test on Reactor Number 4 at the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant went catastrophically wrong, for the Soviet authorities to 
order the evacuation of Pripyat, just two miles from the plant.

In under four hours, more than 49,000 people left their homes, most shuttled 
away from the plant – but not the cloud of radioactive dust carried by wind 
over swaths of westernEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> – 
by a fleet of 1,200 buses.


They were told they would be gone for two or three days and advised to take 
the minimum: identity papers, documents, food and clothing. None ever returned 
to live in Pripyat, declared too radioactively dangerous for human habitation 
for at least 24,000 years.

Six months after the disaster, the Soviet authorities declared a new city 
would be built around 30 miles to the north-east of the power station, to 
replace the old one. Many of the families evacuated from Pripyat moved to this 
city, Slavutych – the old Slavic name of the nearby Dnieper River.

The area on which it was built was first covered in two metres of fresh, 
uncontaminated soil. Architects and construction workers from eight former 
Soviet republics – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Lituania,
Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> and Ukraine – were each 
tasked with creating one of the city’s eight districts. As a result, each 
district has its own distinctive cultural and ethnic features: so, flats and 
houses in the Georgian district have more decoration than those in the more 
austere Russian district next door.


Photographs in the city’s museum capture the excitement of the first 
residents: many followed the Ukrainian tradition of letting a cat cross the 
threshold of their new homes for good luck. At the time, the new city mayor, 
Volodimir Udovichenko, told them: “If Pripyat represents destruction, defeat, a 
lost city, a dead city – then Slavutych is the resurrection”.


Today, the number of former Pripyat residents in Slavutych has dwindled to 
fewer than one in three, but thousands are still to this day employed at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant, despite itsclosure under European Union pressure 
in 2000 <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1071344.stm>.

Every morning the train from Slavutych transports workers such as 62-year-old 
Pasha Kondratiev, 50 minutes along the line to its only destination: the 
Chernobyl plant. Every evening, around 4.30pm it disgorges them back in 
Slavutych. All undergo daily radiation checks, including the train.

Kondratiev, who started work at the plant 33 years ago, works at Chernobyl 
checking radiation measuring equipment. On the day of the accident he and his 
wife Natasha and daughters Tatiana, 12, and Marina, 10, walked to the bridge 
over the river subsidiary feeding the nuclear plant’s cooling pond, to get a 
better view of what was going on. The site was later named “the bridge of 
death”, because of the levels of radiation in the area.

“I could see the ruins of the reactor. It was completely destroyed and there 
was a cloud of smoke coming from it. Nobody gave us any information, but we 
knew it was serious. We knew it was something terrifying,” Kondratiev says.

The following day when the evacuation was announced, Natasha grabbed the girls 
and crossed the city to catch a train to relatives living in Smolensk in 
neighbouring Russia.

At their neat bungalow home in Slavutych, Kondratiev adds: “When I saw the 
power plant, I understood at once there was no chance we were going back …”


His wife shakes her head: “I definitely thought we were coming back at first. 
Then when we were on the train, some of the women whose husbands were 
firefighters were talking about how they’d been burned and were crying, and I 
became so worried about Pasha. My heart was beating so fast. In those days we 
didn’t have mobile phones and I had no idea what would happen to him.”

Two years after the disaster, their previously healthy elder daughter Tatiana, 
became asthmatic. When she collapsed in the street in Slavutych, aged 19, the 
ambulance failed to arrive in time to save her.


“Who knows if Chernobyl caused her asthma. All we know is that before the 
accident she was healthy. She was exposed to radiation when she was 12, which 
is a critical age for a child’s development. It was probably linked to 
Chernobyl, but nobody can say for sure,” Natasha says.

She mourns for her daughter, and for their former home. “From the first day we 
came to Pripyat, I never wanted to leave. It was paradise. Everywhere there 
were roses and fruit trees, we could fish in the river and pick mushrooms in 
the forest. It seemed the place had been created especially for us.

“We went back to Pripyat a few years ago – it was very sad for us. We went to 
our apartment and saw the rooms and some of the things we left behind in 1986.”

Their second daughter, Marina Uldasheva, 39, says she remembers that just 
before the catastrophe, her mother had bought her a red raincoat. After she and 
her sister were evacuated, it was deemed radioactive and destroyed.

“I loved that coat; it was so fashionable. But all our clothes were taken away 
and my long hair was cut like a boy’s. They said it was radioactive too. We 
were given a blue worker’s boiler suit to wear, and slippers.

“I have no strong link with Pripyat – I was too young to remember it much. 
Unlike my parents, I have nothing with which to compare Slavutych, so it is my 
home and I will stay here.”

In the Russian district of Slavutych, Nikolai Syomin, 59, pins his medals 
declaring him a “Hero of the Soviet Union” to his jacket for a photograph. 
Syomin, a graduate of Leningrad Technical School employed as a repairman at 
Chernobyl, was celebrating his 30th birthday in his Pripyat flat on the evening 
of 25 April 1986.

“It was a hot evening and we left all the windows open. We saw some kind of 
smoke in the sky but we didn’t think much of it. Our apartment was in the 
centre of Pripyat. We later discovered the wind brought radioactive dust and 
made it one of the most contaminated areas.”

The following day, he phoned the nuclear plant. “I got through but was told 
they weren’t authorised to say anything and the person put the phone down. The 
next day they announced that Pripyat was being evacuated.”

As a designated “essential worker”, Syomin was told he must stay and help the 
clean-up operation. His wife Natalya, 60 – a cheerful, dignified woman, who 
worked as a nurse in Pripyat’s sports complex – says she grabbed one small bag 
and her three-year-old son Anton, and left.

“In the hours after the accident, everyone received a dose of radiation. Where 
we lived was among the worst areas contaminated. The forest around was 
bulldozed and buried,” she says. “When we left, we didn’t realise that it would 
be for good. It was only months later that we realised nothing would ever be 
the same again.”

Slavutych has the same “spirit” as the city they left, Natalya says, but it 
will always be “our second home”.

“Pripyat holds so many memories for us. Our son was born there and everyone 
misses it. All we have are memories. It was mentally tough to go back, very 
painful, so we stopped going.

“The last time [we were there], we saw that everything is overgrown, so we 
have to work hard to hold on to our memories. At the time we were young, we 
were alive and nothing was a problem. We didn’t worry about living near the 
power plant. We were told it was safe.


“Every 26 April we meet with friends and neighbours from Pripyat to remember. 
But we cannot go back, so we have to look forward.”

Next door to the Syomins, Sergei Matolievich Shedrakov, 59, and his wife 
Alexandra Ivanovna, 60, recall being evacuated from Pripyat with their two 
children – daughter Katya, then aged five, and son Pavel, aged 16 months.


“There was no panic, but looking back it was terrifying,” says Alexandra, who 
used to work in one of Pripyat’s post offices. “People lived with the power 
plant, they worked there, they relied on it. We didn’t even think of radiation.

I miss Pripyat very much. Sometimes it’s too painful to think about it
Lydia Petrovna Malesheva 
“Pripyat was a lovely city, life was good there – but it’s good here in 
Slavutych too. As the Russian saying goes, there are no good things without bad 
things.”

Lydia Petrovna Malesheva, 77, recalls the excitement generated by the news in 
the autumn of 1986 that Slavutych was to be built. “We were told a new city 
would be built just for us, the people who had lost Pripyat. We were so 
excited, we stayed up all night talking about it,” she says. “A city just for 
us. We could hardly believe it.”

Malesheva gives a guided tour of her small garden pointing out the “summer 
space” for barbecues, apple, apricot and pear trees.

“The first of us moved to Slavutych in August 1988. Those who had worked at 
the Chernobyl plant after the accident, like my late husband, were given a 
choice of apartments or little houses. We chose a house. Slavutych is lovely 
and the best solution in the circumstances – but it’s not Pripyat. I miss 
Pripyat very much. Sometimes it’s too painful to think about it.”

She adds: “We went back for the 20th anniversary and there were so many 
people, it was as if the city had come alive again, but of course it hadn’t.”

Once a year, around Easter, some former residents of the now contaminated 
“dead zone” around Chernobyl still return for a few hours – just long enough to 
visit relatives’ graves. Pripyat, built in 1970, was hailed as a triumph of 
Soviet urban planning: the austere concrete style favoured by USSR architects 
tempered by colourful murals and Communist slogans exhorting residents to 
study, work or remember the revolution. Boats and hydrofoils cruised the river 
whose sandy bank, nicknamed “The Beach”, was popular with sunbathers.


Pripyat’s shops were better stocked than elsewhere in the Soviet Union. Its 
hospital and clinics were fully equipped, the Palace of Culture housed a 
theatre, and there were sports halls and an Olympic-sized swimming pool too. At 
the time of the accident, residents were excited about the impending May Day 
inauguration of an amusement park with a Ferris wheel, swingboats and brightly 
coloured dodgems.


Today, Pripyat is a ghost city. The Ferris wheel that never turned has become 
an enduring symbol of the disaster. Radiation levels hover around62.3 
microroentgens an hour <http://www.chernobylpripyat.com/radiation/pripyat.html> 
(0.62 microsieverts): just over twice the normal background radiation in 
London, and less than going through an airport security scanner three times – 
which makes Pripyat safe enough for a brief visit, but not long-term habitation.

But Alexander Petrovich Zabirchenko, 68, who worked as head of Chernobyl’s 
electrical department, prefers not to return to his former home town, where he 
loved to fish in the river and the plant’s cooling reservoir. He has difficulty 
walking because of circulation problems he blames on radiation exposure, and 
will instead pay his tributes to the dead in Slavutych.

“The cemetery here was built with enough room for 50 years,” Zabirchenko says, 
“but it’s already full. So many friends and colleagues have gone.”

All those the Guardian spoke to named relatives and friends who had died of 
cancer, which theylinked to the catastrophe

 30 years ago. None expressed concern about the continuing danger from 
radioactive contamination. For them, the elephant in the room is not radiation, 
but the threat of unemployment.


Many fear the completion of the new EU-funded “sarcophagus” – being built to 
encase the lead and concrete shell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/apr/24/containing-chernobyls-deadly-legacy>
 that was hastily thrown over what was left of Reactor Number 4 – will drive 
many out of work when it is put in place next year, in a city still strangely 
reliant on the power station.

Marina Uldasheva, who has two children Varvara, aged five months, and Matvey, 
10, says she is not worried about her husband, Vitaly, working at Chernobyl 
where he is a member of the team decommissioning the reactors. “I don’t think 
about it. Everything terrifying happened a long time ago.”

Until 2008, when it mysteriously disappeared, central Slavutych boasted 
another Soviet-style art monument with the motto of the city’s architects: 
“From the ashes of the past, we will build a new world.”

The challenge facing Slavutych today is how to ensure an economic disaster 
does not transform the city into another Pripyat.
