One of Coyote Peterson’s most popular YouTube videos shows him writhing around 
in agony <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnExgQ81fhU> on the ground. He’s just 
been stung by atarantula hawk 
<http://undark.org/article/tarantula-hawk-wasp-sting-pain/>, a giant wasp that 
is considered to have the second most painful sting of any insect.

For the first 15 seconds Peterson is unable to speak. He just screams and 
grabs at the dirt.

“That is the most intense pain I’ve ever felt,” he says when he finally gets 
his breath. “Don’t think I can talk.”

Peterson – his real first name is Nathaniel – is the host of the Brave 
Wilderness Channel <https://www.youtube.com/user/BreakingTrail>, a YouTube-only 
show that sees him travelling around the US and Central America encountering 
animals and insects and often being attacked by them.

Brave Wilderness has been running for two years, and Peterson’s videos have 
525m views. His encounter with the tarantula hawk – aptly named because it 
flies around tarantulas stalking and stinging them – has been watched over 13m 
times.

Some of the other videos include: STUNG by a COW KILLER! 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-oSVCCqzU> – in which Peterson is stung by a 
velvet “cow killer” ant – andPINCHED by a HUGE CRAB! 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTReMFnGDUk>, where he is pinched by a large 
crab.

The titles are clearly clickbait, and some of the videos are reminiscent of 
the popular MTV series Jackass, where a group of men would perform 
self-injuring stunts.

“I’m Coyote Peterson,” our host tells us in the tarantula hawk video. 

“And I’m about to enter the sting zone with the tarantula hawk.”

 Coyote Peterson gets himself stung by a tarantula hawk. 
But Peterson, who is currently preparing to be stung by a bullet ant – said to 
possessthe most painful insect sting in the world 
<http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/the-biggest/the-10-most-painful-insect-stings-in-the-world/>
 – said his aim is actually to “create an educational series” which can warn 
people about certain animals while giving viewers “a vicarious experience”.

“If I were to just take a bullet ant and let it walk around on my arm or look 
at it in a glass capsule you’d have more people saying: ‘Ah, that was 
interesting, but it would have been a lot more interesting if you’d let it 
sting you’, because that at the end of the day is what people really want to 
see and we’re aware of that,” he said.

“At the end of the day what we’re really hoping is these extreme episodes 
bring in the audience that then does find the episodes that are more 
conservation-based.”

Brave Wilderness has a whole subsection of videos called “Coyote’s backyard”, 
which are more educational in nature. His daughter Olivia – nicknamed “pup” – 
and other children are featured in some of the clips as Peterson takes them 
looking for different animals and insects in a variety of locales.

Peterson, 35, grew up in Newbury, a rural town about 20 miles east of 
Cleveland, Ohio. He said he spent a lot of his childhood seeking out animals, 
particularly snapping turtles, and reading books about them.

Peterson has no formal animal training – he studied film at Ohio State 
University – but had the idea to combine his passion for animals with his 
film-making skills while talking with friends. He and a small team started 
developing the show and it was eventually picked up by the Discovery Channel as 
a web-only series.

“We were heavily inspired at the time by the show Man vs Wild with Bear 
Grylls,” Peterson said.

“And we said, well how can we take this concept of being in the wild and 
instead of killing and eating the animals, how do we present them in the 
fashion that Steve Irwin and Jeff Corwin and Jack Hanna did?”

In case it isn’t clear from Peterson’s reaction in the tarantula hawk video, 
he said that getting stung by it really, really hurt.

“When you do something like that your subconscious has this buildup of: ‘How 
bad is it going to be?’, and I think you almost sometimes over-anticipate 
things. In the case of the tarantula hawk that wasn’t true; it hurt just as bad 
as advertised,” he said.

“Everything I’d read said the pain subsides in about five minutes but it was 
about the longest five minutes of my life.”

For the bullet ant film, Peterson will travel to Costa Rica, where local 
guides will help him capture the ant. Then he will get it to sting him.

The bullet ant is named as such because the sting has been compared to being 
shot. The pain, which can last up to 24 hours,has also been described 
<http://www.businessinsider.com/most-painful-sting-justin-schmidt-bullet-ant-pain-index-2016-8>
 as “like walking over flaming charcoal with a three-inch nail embedded in your 
heel”.

Peterson said the video will be released just in time for Christmas.
