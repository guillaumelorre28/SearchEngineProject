Winning tip: Leisurely Lugano


Dramatically positioned on a glittering blue lake with mountains towering 
around, Lugano is a stunner. If arriving by train, take the little funicular 
down into the centre and soak up the rarefied air of the wealthy Italianate 
streets. Head 500 metres east through the elegantGiardini Pubblici 
<http://www.luganoturismo.ch/it/89/parchi.aspx> to Castagnola, to pick up the 
Sentiero dell’olivo 
<http://luganoturismo.ch/it/149/sentiero-dell-olivo-.aspx?idActivity=653&idMod=546>
 path, which leads 3.5km through shoreline olive groves to Gandria, a pretty 
cluster of houses clinging to the hillside just shy of the Italian border. It’s 
an enchanting walk (though beware Lycra-clad high-achieving Luganesi pounding 
past on their lunch break power jog) to a timewarp village with good lunch 
options and a convenient, scenic ferry ride back into town.

Said to be Switzerland’s oldest city (first settled around 3900BC), Chur is a 
must for visitors with its magnificent mountain setting and traffic-free old 
town. Try climbing up to its highest point at 1,800 metres above sea level, 
sample the local cherry liqueur or visit its many archaeological sites, ranging 
from prehistoric through Roman to medieval. You won’t go hungry – the city is 
brimming with gourmet restaurants and characterful cafes.

This central Swiss city has an attractive, compact medieval old town but all 
the attributes of a modern city. It has a beautiful lakeside setting where 
black kites wheel and scavenge, a river with two covered bridges (one built in 
1333) and a promenade lined with bars and cafes. Its city walls have a 
13th-century tower with views over town and surroundings. In typical Swiss 
fashion the train, bus and lake boat stations are next to each other, 
encouraging trips along the beautiful lake with possible stops for the world’s 
oldest cog railway up the 1,800-metre Rigi mountain or the world’s steepest cog 
railway to 2,100-metre Pilatus peak. Switzerland’sMuseum of Transportation 
<http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-gb/swiss-museum-of-transport-and-communication-lucerne.html>
 is in the town and you can take a 40-minute train journey to Engelberg, where 
Bollywood shoots its mountain scenes and the three-stage cable car goes up to 
the 3,200-metre Titlis mountain’s ski area all year round.

 The Rheinfall in Schaffhausen. Photograph: Alamy 
An hour’s drive north of Zurich is this beautiful medieval city with its 
stunning town centre and fabulous Rhein River Bath swimming area. A walk along 
the Rhein will take you Europe’s widest waterfall (249 metres), the Rheinfall, 
with great boat trips and castle to explore. In December don’t miss the strange 
Christmas market tradition of Santa being led through the streets by a group of 
men eerily clanging giant cowbells.

In any Swiss city seek out Manor <http://www.manor.ch/de/u/store-finder> or 
Migros <https://filialen.migros.ch/de/> shops for (relatively) cheap but very 
good meals in their self-service cafeterias. Migros offers an excellent cold 
buffet selection with meats, local cheeses and lots of salads. Food is priced 
by weight and great for vegetarians. Manor, unlike Migros, sells alcohol 
including local wines, and has a good choice of hot food as well as delicious 
cakes and pastries. Both cook meat to order for each customer and all the food 
is fresh and well-presented.

roam since 2009 when the pit was supplemented by Bären park. Until 27 November

superb fireworks on the Rhine. I lived inBasel <https://www.basel.com/en> for

seen anywhere, but you have to be early to secure your spot by the river,

 Red Cross Museum, Geneva. Photograph: Alamy 
Geneva is an ideal city break location. The International Red Cross Museum 
<http://www.redcrossmuseum.ch/en/> and its fascinating historical insights is 
within an easy walk from the centre, but on your way you can stop off at the
Musée Ariana <http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/fr/ariana/>, and enjoy an 
alfresco cup of tea on the ambient balcony. The superbbotanical gardens 
<http://www.ville-ge.ch/cjb/index_en.php> are free and, of course, there is a 
beautiful lake in Geneva! Take a boat ride to the other side for even more 
awe-inspiring scenery. Head out of the centre for less touristy restaurants and 
bars where you can enjoy the good life for less. The number 8 bus takes you 
over the border into France, where you can take a ski lift up the mountain for 
a delicious lunch or hike.

 Château de Neuchatel. Photograph: Getty Images 
This small city may not be as famous as Geneva or Basel, but it deserves as 
much attention. Only 30 minutes from the border with France, it sits on aJura 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/17/jura-holiday-guide-france> 
mountainside by a lake and is surrounded by vineyards. It is 1,000 years old, 
and its best-known sights are its château and the Collegiate Church, both 
dating from the 12th century and sharing a rocky promontory. Wandering around 
the city centre visitors will enjoy the yellow stones buildings. The lake, and 
its towns, are worth exploring by boat and on National Day, 1 August, thousands 
of fireworks are launched from all over the place, reflecting on the calm 
water. For nibbles, try one of the unforgettable cheese fondues atLa Taverne

 The rotunda of St Gallen Cathedral. Photograph: Alamy 
I’ve got family in Switzerland so often visit. I particularly love the city of 
St Gallen in the north-east. It has a fabulous eighth-century cathedral, a 
Unesco world heritage site, and a great baroque monastic library next door. Its 
collection includes manuscripts dating back to Roman times. The surroundings 
are fabulous too – with lake Constance and the charming villages and mountains 
of the Appenzell region. And it’s all easily reached by the wonderful local 
trains.
