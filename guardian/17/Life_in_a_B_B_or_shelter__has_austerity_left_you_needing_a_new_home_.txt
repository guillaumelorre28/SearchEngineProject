In Frances Ryan’s Hardworking Britain column each week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/hardworking-britain>, she 
focuses on stories of individuals who are affected by government policy, 
including the austerity agenda, which has led to a reduction in welfare 
spending over the past six years.

One key area affected by government policy is housing. Cuts to housing 
benefits and other support services mean more people are being forced to live 
in temporary accommodation, with figures last year showinga 308% rise in 
families living in B&Bs since 2010

 in England. There are also reports of people being priced out of city centres, 
and moving elsewhere.

Are you living in alternative accommodation due to high rents or a lack of 
financial support? Did you move in with friends or have you spent time sofa 
surfing? Or are you and your family living in a B&B or shelter? If you have a 
story you’d like to tell as part of the Hardworking Britain series, let us know
