At Godolphin School, our students are required to wear a blue pinafore for the 
duration of their secondary education until entering the sixth form (If teenage 
girls look frumpy at school, is that a bad thing?

, 8 July). This pinny serves multiple functions: it maintains a historical link 
to Godolphin’s traditions, it fosters a sense of school community, and on a 
practical level it shields students from the mounting social pressures to worry 
too much about one’s appearance. The pinny often attracts quizzical looks from 
visitors. Nevertheless, students continually express their support to keep it 
as a staple of the Godolphin uniform. I believe it is important for our young 
women to be able to grow up beneath their pinny, liberating them from feeling 
self-conscious about changes in shape or size. To me, the pinny is not so much 
a rule to hide behind, but an opportunity for girls to become confident in who 
they are.
