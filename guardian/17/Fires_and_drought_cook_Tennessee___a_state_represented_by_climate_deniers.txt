With my new hope that deniers of climate change will take ownership of the 
consequences, I am sad to report that this week, terrible wildfires haveswept 
through Tennessee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/30/tennessee-wildfires-human-caused-gatlinburg-dollywood-theme-park>
, a southeastern state in the USA. This state is beset by a tremendous drought, 
as seen by a recent US Drought Monitor map. There currently are severe, 
extreme, and exceptional drought conditions covering a wide swath of southern 
states. The causes of drought are combinations of lowered precipitation and 
higher temperatures.

The patterns of drought are the result of many weeks of weather (warm and dry) 
that have led to the current conditions. The recent high-temperature map from 
NOAA below provides just one example.

Why do we care about the crazy drought in the southern USA? Because it leads 
to bad consequences. As I write this post, we can read about the horrific fires 
in Tennessee that are destroying both natural habitat as well as towns and 
economies. A video about Gatlinburg Tennessee fires can be seenhere 
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/29/tennessee-wildfires-gatlinburg/94591254/>
. There, wildfires are threatening the resort town. It is too early to tell 
what economic damages will result.

Was this fire caused by climate change? The answer is yes. We are now in a 
world where all of our weather is impacted by humans.We know human-caused 
warming is making drought and heat more severe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/sep/17/global-warmings-one-two-punch-extreme-heat-and-drought>
 – that leads to fires like the one we are seeing. We also knowthat 2016 will 
be the hottest year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/21/global-warming-continues-2016-will-be-the-hottest-year-ever-recorded>
 ever recorded and the first time temperatures have reached the critical mark 
of 1C (1.8F) above normal.

Of course we feel sorry for the folks who are affected by the wildfire in 
Tennessee. But, Tennessee has not helped itself. In 2012,Tennessee passed a law 
<http://www.livescience.com/50085-states-outlaw-climate-change.html> 
encouraging teachers to present alternative reasons for climate change, even 
though those views are not supported by science.


Here are some insightful comments from legislators in Tennessee, as reported 
by Bill Moyers (found here 
<http://billmoyers.com/2015/02/03/congress-climate-deniers/#TN>). 

 * Rep. Diane Black (R-TN-06): “The far left-wing elements of this 
administration foresee a near future with carbon regulated as a pollutant and 
heavily taxed to discourage consumption and generate revenue. We must resist 
all of these radical approaches all geared to raise energy prices on American 
families and businesses.” [Project Vote Smart Issue Position 
<http://votesmart.org/public-statement/534481/>]

 * Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN-07): “[T]here is not consensus [on climate 
change] and you can look at the latest IPCC Report and look at Doctor Lindzen 
from MIT. His rejection of that or Judith Curry … from Georgia Tech. There is 
not consensus there.” [The Wire, 2/17/14 
<http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/02/fact-checking-bill-nye-marsha-blackburn-climate-change-debate/358149/>
]

 * Rep. John J. Duncan Jr. (R-TN-02): On his website, Duncan lists five 
scientists that claim global warming is not real, including how global warming 
is “the greatest scam in history.” [Duncan Website 
<http://duncan.house.gov/issue/environment-and-global-warming>]

 * Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN-03): When asked his opinion about global 
warming during a candidate debate, Fleischmann said: “I think we ought to take 
Al Gore, put him on an iceberg, and put him way out there.” [Times Free Press, 
7/5/12 
<http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2012/jul/07/put-who-on-an-iceberg-chattanooga-times/>
]

 * Rep. Phil Roe (R-TN-01): “Many believe greenhouse gas emissions are 
contributing to the gradual warming of our planet and changing of our climate. 
While there are many questions surrounding the science of the issue, it seems 
to me like we could develop a solution that will reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions without inflicting catastrophic damage on our economy.” [Project Vote 
Smart Issue Position, 1/1/11 <http://votesmart.org/public-statement/549174/>]

So, I will just tell my friends in Tennessee, make sure to give a big THANK 
YOU to Diane, Marsha, John, Chuck, and Phil. Maybe they will come to help your 
town clean up after these fires.

Climate change <https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange> is 
something we can prevent, but not with legislators like this.
