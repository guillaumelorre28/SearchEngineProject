Pauline Hanson <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/pauline-hanson> 
says she has been given tickets to the US for Donald Trump’s swearing-in as the 
US president on Friday.

But it will fall instead to Brian Burston, the One Nation senator in New South 
Wales, to fly to Washington for the inauguration.

Burston told Guardian Australia on Monday he was in the process of buying 
tickets for his trip, which he would pay for himself and not seek to claim 
under his parliamentary entitlements.

He said he would represent One Nation in Washington after Queensland senator 
Malcolm Roberts, who received an invitation to the inauguration through his 
advisor and former Trump campaign worker Darren Nelson, withdrew because of a 
medical condition.

Hanson, who was next in line for the tickets, said she had decided not to go, 
citing “work commitments”.


She earlier expressed her surprise and delight on Twitter at receiving tickets 
to the inauguration.

But Hanson almost immediately followed up by saying that because of other 
demands on her time she was yet to commit to the event, which is beingboycotted 
by some Democratic Congress representatives

Pauline Hanson (@PaulineHansonOz) 
Because of my duties to the people of Queensland & Australia I'm still 
deciding if I can attend the inauguration of@realDonaldTrump

She then revealed she had decided not to go.

Burston said the inauguration would be a “very historical” occasion and “a 
very rare opportunity, no doubt”.

“The president’s only elected every four years and this is almost 
unprecedented, this non-political president, so to speak – somebody with such a 
high profile and a lot of controversy surrounding him,” he said.

 “I’m looking forward to seeing him physically, we probably won’t get to meet 
him obviously, but certainly I’ll be in his presence and I’ll soak up the 
occasion.

“Malcolm Roberts recently visited over there with Darren and met some of his 
people, so I’m sure we are on his radar, or we’re known by him, and he is 
certainly aware of our presence and our similar views.

 Burston said the trip would be “privately funded, guaranteed”. 

“I’m a fierce critic of the parliamentary entitlements and I don’t believe 
we’re entitled to any more than what the ordinary citizen is. I don’t seek to 
take advantage of my position in any shape or form, particularly financially.

“It’s a privilege to serve the public and that’s exactly what I’ll be doing 
but I won’t be ripping the taxpayer off in any sense.”

Roberts released a statement saying he had originally planned to go to the 
inauguration but had to withdraw because he needed “urgent medical treatment 
for a incarcerated hernia”.

“Senator Brian Burston will now proudly represent Pauline Hanson’s One Nation 
at the historic event,” it said.

“It was originally planned at the end of his trip [through western Queensland] 
Senator Roberts would attend the United States to witness the inauguration of 
President Trump as a guest of the US government.”

Hanson earlier told News Corp 
<http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/pauline-hanson-gets-trump-inauguration-tickets/news-story/5d89e76cdcb23317f8e60ba133b314da>
: “I thought about it for a minute, it would be a fantastic opportunity, but 
I’ve got too much happening in Australia.”


“I think everyone knows my support for Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, I was so pleased to see him 
win, but I think my responsibility is here first and foremost, I’ve always said 
that.

“In light of what’s happening in WA, and Queensland elections at any time, 
I’ve got candidates relying on me. The cane growers in Queensland, they’re 
getting no satisfaction from Barnaby Joyce ... ”

A spokesman for Hanson said he understood the invitation may have been 
received several days ago. He said he could not disclose the source of the 
invitation but Hanson might later choose to do so. “I don’t believe they’re 
telling anyone at this point in time.”

Hanson and Roberts made headlines last November by toasting Trump’s election 
win with champagne

 outside Parliament House in Canberra.

Roberts is among those who have said Trump’s victory signalled a political 
swing to the right across the western world that showed parties such as One 
Nation were on the rise. Last month hemet the leader of Trump’s Environmental 
Protection Agency transition team
