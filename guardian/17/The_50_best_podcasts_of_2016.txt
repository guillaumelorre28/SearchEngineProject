Mortified <http://getmortified.com/podcast/>

People read highlights from their childhood diaries in front of a crowd of

Episode of the year: The first of the courageous four-parter

Without doubt the best listen all year. Jason Phipps

Now in its 14th year, Radiolab remains the gold standard of accessible 
documentary podcasts. This year has been no exception, with episodes on 
everything from Alzheimer’s to the ethical conundrums faced by defence lawyers.
Episode of the year: I Hart K-Pop <http://www.radiolab.org/story/i-hart-k-pop/>
, which argues that intrusive paparazzi tactics were actually a good thing for 
the ultra-conservative, almost militarily strict Korean pop music scene.Stuart 
Heritage

Heavyweight <https://gimletmedia.com/heavyweight/>

The hilariously deadpan Jonathan Goldstein helps people deal with unfinished 
business, whether it is scattering your father’s ashes illegally or getting 
Moby to give your CDs back. Funny, touching and short. A perfect podcast.
Episode of the year: Gregor’s story <https://gimletmedia.com/episode/2-gregor/>
 explores something so relatable – the feeling of being left behind by your 
peers. And when those peers are Moby and the president of Estonia, it’s easy to 
see why insecurities might arise.RS

The Dollop <https://thedollop.libsyn.com/>


Twice a week, standup comic Dave Anthony tells Gary Reynolds the life story of 
one extraordinary figure in American history – such as President Andrew 
Jackson, who was given a giant cheese that stank out the entire White House. 
Informative, witty and unbearably funny. You would never learn this stuff in a 
classroom.
Episode of the year: Huey Long <http://thedollop.libsyn.com/215-huey-long>. 
Did you know that in the 1930s Louisiana was run under a dictatorship that 
essentially stood apart from the rest of the US?RS

lone phone box in the desert and the man who became obsessed with first 
calling, and then visiting, it – before ultimately turning it into an internet

How to Be a Girl <http://www.howtobeagirlpodcast.com/>

An anonymous mum navigates the first few years after her young daughter comes 
out as transgender. A tender take on an under-represented reality.
Episode of the year: How to Be a Dad 
<http://www.howtobeagirlpodcast.com/episodes/episode-xii-how-to-be-a-dad>. The 
frank conversation between Dad and Mum, as they compare fears and acceptance 
processes, is compelling and runs counter to expectation. But equally potent is 
how much they sound like any old parents; scared, besotted and in awe of their 
child all at once.FM

Interviews

Roam Schooled <http://www.roamschooled.com/>

Jim Brunberg takes his twin six-year-old daughters on US roadtrips in their 
Winnebago to answer questions such as “What’s a lone wolf?”, interviewing 
people until the girls come to their own conclusions.
Episode of the year: “What’s a hippy? <http://www.roamschooled.com/episode-8/>
” in which the three meet veterans of the hippy movement who speak frankly 
about drugs and sex. A refreshing, beautiful listen.RS

Love + Radio <http://loveandradio.org/> 

Nick van der Kolk advises you to listen to Love + Radio with headphones on 
and, while it often earns its explicit tag, there is little formula apart from 
in-depth interviews. They may be controversial, they may be seedy and they may 
involve taxidermy.

 The daddy of British podcasting … Adam Buxton. Photograph: Ben Meadows 
The daddy of British podcasting is beloved for good reason. His pod is laced

ever done.
Episode of the year: Although he is most at home chatting to pals such as Joe 
Cornish and Louis Theroux, theepisode with Michael Palin 
<https://soundcloud.com/adam-buxton/ep-28-michael-palin> – whom Buxton 
obviously reveres – is a standout, largely for the very moving moment when they

Hello Internet <http://www.hellointernet.fm/>

An Australian and an American living in the UK have in-depth debates and 
banter that is actually amusing. And they are always well informed on topics, 
whether serious (electoral systems) or silly (the sticks that plug takeaway 
coffee lids). Their day jobs as educational YouTubers must help.
Episode of the year: A Classic Episode <http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/66>

before launching in to some satisfyingly objective Brexit talk.FM

Homecoming <https://gimletmedia.com/homecoming/>

One of the most high-profile launches of the year. The big-name stars – David 
Schwimmer, Catherine Keener, Oscar Isaac – ensure there is no cringey 
radio-drama acting. Heidi (Keener) is a caseworker in a government facility 
helping soldiers with PTSD back into the community.
Episode of the year: The first episode is a scene-setter, and features 
Schwimmer having a most unRoss-like meltdown at the airport.LH

The Radio Adventures of Eleanor Amplified 
<http://whyy.org/cms/eleanoramplified/>

Adventure, intrigue and cat videos. The silly drama of this kids pod will keep

brainwashing bad guys, trips to Siberia – and the mysterious Scary Dangerous 
Jungle Island.
Episode of the year: It’s Breakfast Time, America

Darkest Night <http://www.darkestnightpod.com/>

This horror anthology podcast follows the top-secret Project Cyclops, where 
researchers “uncover the secrets of the dead”. But we are including it for one 
reason – it is recorded in binaural sound. After 10 minutes of the noises and 
voices coming at you from all angles, you will be so disoriented you may walk 
into a lamppost. Fully immersive.

Sooo Many White Guys <http://www.wnyc.org/shows/whiteguys>

One half of 2 Dope Queens, Phoebe Robinson, nails a chatshow that turns the 
tables on white-guy privilege in the podcast zone. Her Ryan Seacrest impression 
may not cut it, but her humour and chat with “people who are killing it who are 
not just straight up white dudes” certainly does.

Crimetown <https://gimletmedia.com/crimetown/>

The creators of HBO documentary The Jinx turn their attention to corruption in 
American cities. The show starts with young prosecutor Buddy Cianci, who takes 
on the local crime family in Providence, Rhode Island. But as his political 
ambitions grow, he ends up in bed with the mob. A gripping series that weaves 
brutal crimes and dirty politics with good humour.
Episode of the year: The Making of a Mayor

 Minnesota guardsmen search for Jacob Wetterling. Photograph: Alamy 
Twenty-seven years ago, 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling was biking home from the 
video store in his Minnesota hometown when he was kidnapped at gunpoint by a 
stranger. He was never seen again. The case gripped the nation and led to the 
US creating a sex-offender register. This enthralling podcast retraces the 
criminal investigation, ending in the courtroom where a prisoner admits his

My Favourite Murder <http://www.feralaudio.com/show/my-favorite-murder/>

A world of horror and hilarity. Once a week, Karen Kilgariff and Georgia 
Hardstark come together to talk about murder. One of them tells the story of a 
killing, while the other reacts in utter shock and outrage. It’s important to 
note that they are incredibly respectful, and despair at the world almost 
continuously. This has built up quite a following, with fan art, Etsy pages and 
a sell-out run of T-shirts (all profits go to charity). “Stay Sexy and Don’t 
Get Murdered.”

 A must-listen … Malcolm Gladwell’s Revisionist History. 
Malcolm Gladwell takes a personal journey through past events to see if they 
can be reinterpreted, or new insights can be drawn. You will learn how an Elvis 
Costello song exposes the power of art, and how a car accident outside Chicago 
reveals the truth about mass delusion. A must-listen.

<https://theringer.com/keepin-it-1600-podcast-politics-election-jon-favreau-dan-pfeiffer-220924af4c94>

At a time when American politics is rapidly descending into ludicrousness, 
former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Dan Pfeiffer, Jon Lovett and Tommy Vietor 
provide an oasis of reason with this insider podcast. In the runup to 
November’s election, 1600 offered up an unapologetically partisan take on 
Clinton v Trump. In the wake of the latter’s victory, it has morphed into a 
sobering look at the many troubling aspects of Trump’s ensuing reign.
Episode of the year: The pod recorded in the immediate aftermath

why the Democrats lost.GM
