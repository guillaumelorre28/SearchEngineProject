An Action for Rail report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/03/rail-fares-cost-commuters-up-to-14-of-their-income-says-study>
 released earlier this week revealed the high cost of rail travel for UK 
commuters.

It found that commuters travelling between Luton and London St Pancras spent 
14% of anaverage wage <https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=AV_AN_WAGE>
 on a£387 monthly pass

 (equivalent to 3.1% of the average monthly wage).

A wider sample of rail passes for similar distances reveals a similar trend 
across a number of other European capitals: even in countries where monthly 
rail passes cost commuters more than the equivalent of £200, it still made up 
less than 8% of the average worker’s monthly earnings.

Workers travelling similar distances into Helsinki and Stockholm spend 6.5% of 
their monthly wage on commuting, while it costs Oslo’s workers 4% of their 
wages.

The only country in which the cost of train travel approaches that of the UK 
is Portugal, where low wages and high transport costs can see commuters 
spending more than 9% of their monthly wage on travel.
