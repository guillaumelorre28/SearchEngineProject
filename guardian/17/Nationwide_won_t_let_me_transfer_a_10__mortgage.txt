I have had a fixed-rate mortgage with Nationwide for about four years, 
originally for £100,000, but with overpayments I have reduced it to £61,000. I 
want to move and have had an offer accepted on a £685,000 house.Nationwide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/nationwide>, however, has refused to 
transfer the mortgage and insists I make a new application.

I gave it details of my past two years’ earnings – £53,000 and £34,000 
respectively – but was told that as I was moving out of the area I needed 
future predicted earnings. I am a foster carer so this is not straightforward – 
all for a 10% mortgage. I have never missed a payment or had credit refused. 
I’ve been told that there is no point in appealing. If I redeem my mortgage and 
go with another lender, I have an early repayment fee of £3,000. Is this fair?

Having showered people with money in the past, mortgage lenders have now gone 
to the other extreme, and are obsessed with the ability to be able to meet the 
payments. Clearly in this case, your refusal was a nonsense, and happily, after 
we took up your case, Nationwide has reviewed and agreed you can port the 
mortgage. “We have a duty to assess our customers’ financial situation and 
ability to repay a loan for every mortgage application,” it says.
