There has yet to be a more impudent introduction at an awards ceremony than 
David Letterman’s majestic effort for one former Hollywood couple at the 1995 
Oscars. “Here to present the award are Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon,” the 
host drawled, “Pay attention – I’m sure they’re pissed about something …” 
Primarily about that introduction, to see Sarandon and Robbins’s stony faces as 
they made their way on stage.

Back to the present day, then, where Sarandon’s pick for the US presidential 
election is being treated vastly more reverentially. My theory is that Susan 
coming out for Green party candidate Dr Jill Stein is definitely the most 
coveted celebrity endorsement since Vote Leave managed to getEmma Thompson to 
come out for remain

. Looking back, that was the six-pointer.

So I am amused by a headline in Newsweek reading 
<http://europe.newsweek.com/susan-sarandons-endorsement-dr-jill-stein-only-helps-donald-trump-516329?rm=eu>
: “Susan Sarandon’s endorsement of Dr Jill Stein only helps Trump.” Only helps 
Hillary, surely? I mean, obviously the major endorsement Hillary would want 
would be forBarbra Streisand to come out for Trump 
<http://gawker.com/5046973/obama-campaign-reaches-threat-level-streisand>. But 
in the absence of that big one, Susan is certainly not to be sniffed at.
