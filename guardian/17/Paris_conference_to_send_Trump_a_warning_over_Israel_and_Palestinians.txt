The international community will send Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> a strong warning that only a 
two-state solution can solve the Israel-Palestinian crisis, amid signs that the 
EU is willing to diverge from the US on Israel policy.

A conference in Paris on Sunday of more than 70 countries, organised by the 
French government and comingfive days before Trump is inaugurated 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/15/donald-trump-inauguration-washington-progressives>
, will warn that thetwo-state solution is under threat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-and-israel-late-but-necessary>
 and urge both sides in the conflict to resume talks.

It comes as Palestinians expressed concern that Trump advisers endorse the 
controversial Israeli settlement programme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/27/mahmoud-abbas-un-resolution-lays-groundwork-to-end-israeli-settlements>
 and want tomove the US embassy to Jerusalem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/21/us-israel-embassy-jerusalem-peace-process>
.

The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, has warned that such a symbolic move 
could derail the peace process.

Critics have claimed that the conference, the second organised by the French 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/21/france-to-hold-summit-on-israeli-palestinian-peace-process>
 in less than a year, is pointless, since neither Abbas nor the Israeli prime 
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will be present.

Netanyahu has called the event futile, rigged 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/12/netanyahu-middle-east-peace-conference-rigged-move-against-israel-paris-trump>
 and “a relic”, saying: “It’s a last gasp of the past before the future sets 
in.”

The French had at one point hoped the conference might lead to an agreement 
for Netanyahu and Abbas to meet, but that is off the table.

Instead, Abbas, pleased with the direction of European diplomacy, will meet 
the French soon after the conference.

In a statement alongside the conference, the French foreign minister, 
Jean-Marc Ayrault, defended the initiative. “For more than six years, the 
absence of a peace process has given way to a deceptive status quo,” he said. 
“Palestinians are seeing their future state shrinking as settlement expansion 
continues at an unprecedented speed. This, in turn, generates more occupation, 
since there is never one without the other.”

The French say the conference, to be addressed by the president, François 
Hollande, is not just a vital symbolic show ofsupport for a two-state solution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/28/the-two-state-solution-in-the-middle-east-all-you-need-to-know>
, but a chance to set out practical incentives for peace, including aiding 
Palestinian capacity-building and help for civil society, to promote dialogue.

Despite Israeli objections to the conference, and disapproval from the Trump 
team 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/11/the-guardian-view-on-trump-and-israel-stick-to-the-script>
, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, will attend, and he is eager for the 
event not to be dismissed as a swansong for hisfrustrated efforts to seek peace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/27/obama-and-allies-seek-to-isolate-netanyahu-before-trump-takes-office>
.

In a move that gave the conference a new relevance, the US broke with 
precedent in December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/28/kerry-defends-us-decision-to-not-veto-un-condemnation-of-israeli-settlements>
 by refusing to veto a UN security councilresolution that condemned Israeli 
settlements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/28/uks-key-role-in-brokering-un-resolution-on-israeli-settlements-confirmed>
 as “illegal and dangerously imperilling the viability of the two-state 
solution”. The resolution also called on “states in their relevant dealings to 
distinguish between the territory of the state of Israel and territories 
occupied since 1967”.

The clause, repeated in the draft Paris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris> communique, has been taken as a green 
light for campaigns to boycott goods from illegally occupied territory. The EU 
will meet this week to discuss how the proposal could be developed.

The draft communique, under negotiation over the weekend, also reaffirms 
existing international resolutions, urges both sides to restate their 
commitment to a negotiated two-state solution and disavows officials who reject 
it.


The text urges the protagonists to “refrain from unilateral steps that 
prejudge the outcome of final status negotiations”.


In a sign that the Obama administration had lost patience with Israel, Kerry 
followed the UN vote with a lengthy speech on 28 December detailing the scale 
of settlement activity, and the threat it posed to a contiguous Palestinian 
state. Describing the Israeli government as the most rightwing in the country’s 
history, he warned thatIsrael <https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> would 
never have true peace with the Arab world if it “goes down the path of one 
state”.

Although Israel has voiced concerns that the Paris conference may be used as a 
lever for a UN resolution, the more likely theatre for further activity is the 
EU, including over boycotts of goods generated within occupied territories. 
More broadly, it may represent the start of a EU foreign policy more 
independent of Washington.

Britain, caught between its support for a two-state solution and desire to 
gain traction with the Trump administration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/29/theresa-may-john-kerry-comments-israel-palestine-un-resolution>
, was deciding at what level to attend the conference.

To complicate matters further, the Russians are holding separate meetings in 
Moscow this week with Palestinian groups.

Trump has pledged to pursue more pro-Israeli policies, but in nomination 
hearings last week, neither theproposed secretary of state 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/13/rex-tillerson-trump-secretary-of-state-mitt-romney-out>
, Rex Tillerson, nor theexpected defence secretary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/01/james-mattis-secretary-of-defense-donald-trump>
, James Mattis, supported moving the embassy from Tel Aviv. But David Friedman, 
Trump’schoice for ambassador to Israel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/15/trump-israel-ambassador-david-friedman>
, has said he looks forward to working “from Israel’s eternal city, Jerusalem”.

A move to Jerusalem would endorse the disputed city as Israel’s capital.
