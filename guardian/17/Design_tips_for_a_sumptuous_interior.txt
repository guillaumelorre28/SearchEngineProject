Creating a warm, welcoming home doesn’t mean a total interior redesign. Simply 
adding some of your own personality to the furnishings and fittings can help 
you avoid the soulless look that can come with a perfectly manicured scheme. 
Think about introducing contrasting textures – with throws and rugs, or even a 
hanging textile. Rustic materials, with their own imperfections, can give 
softness, and that natural theme can be continued with the introduction of 
houseplants.

Bring in texture
Layer up different materials to instantly add both visual and physical warmth 
to your home. As well as adding rugs to floors and cushions or throws to sofas, 
consider textured wallpaper, woven baskets, or hanging textiles in place of 
wall art. Mix and match wools, velvets, wickers and faux furs to create a truly 
sumptuous feel.

Mismatched and informal
A perfectly curated scheme designed within an inch of its life can actually 
feel soulless – avoid being too rigid in your room décor by mixing furniture 
from different ranges and eras. As well as showcasing your personality, this 
can be a practical approach for when extra guests arrive, allowing you to layer 
in chunky floor cushions or extra armchairs as required.

Layer your lighting
A single light source can make a room feel stark – instead, create a warm 
ambiance by utilising various light sources, from accent lights – such as table 
or floor lamps – to wall pendants or sconces to add a gentle wash of uplight or 
downlight to a space. For an even cosier, welcoming look, opt for fabric shades 
over cold glass or industrial bare bulbs.

Natural materials
Woods, wools and other natural materials like rattan create an instant 
softness to any space. Opting for pieces that haven’t been overly produced – 
think a tabletop with a rustic matt texture with the natural imperfections 
still visible – creates a look that feels authentic and inviting. Introducing 
on-trend houseplants and succulents enhances the natural connection.

Play with shapes
Harsh lines and angles can feel uninviting, so break up shapes by mixing a 
square table with a round rug, bring in an armchair with gently sloping arms to 
counterbalance a boxy sofa, or choose a sideboard with curved corners to feel 
less intrusive in a hallway. Use the same tactic for smaller accessories on 
shelves or tabletops to help draw the eye around the space.
