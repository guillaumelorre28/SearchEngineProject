The number of British people who applied for Irish passports has shot up since 
the EU referendum. Figuresreleased by Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs 
<https://www.dfa.ie/passporttracking/passportstatistics/> show that in June the 
numbers were up by 9% on 2015. But by November the increase had risen to 106%, 
and passport offices in London and Edinburgh had received 6,443 applications 
compared with just over 3,000 the year before.
