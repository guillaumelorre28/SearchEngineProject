Alice Bell is right that we need to talk about climate change (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/06/trump-world-climate-change-denial>
, 6 December). However, when we do, people often say there is no point in 
cutting one’s own emissions (by not flying, for example) because hardly anyone 
else is; and they say there is no point in the UK doing anything, because other 
countries aren’t. Sadly, people in other countries are probably using the same 
arguments and so, in a self-fulfilling way, it could be argued that they are 
all correct. Certainly there is no evidence that nations or individuals are 
actually going to make the changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions 
adequately, whatever pledges may have been made at international conferences.

Clearly, we need a new approach: to invest in a combination of carbon 
scrubbing, geoengineering, third-way solutions, forest protection and 
reforestation. These can be funded by an international financial transactions 
tax, and they don’t involve lifestyle changes people won’t accept. We need to 
start now.

• There is much wringing of hands when you do talk about climate change in my 
experience. But, however blandly you suggest you don’t have to fly so often 
(most flights are holidays), or take the car to the supermarket, there is 
resistance, even antagonism. It seems that if an action interferes with our 
pleasure or convenience, it is not worthy enough.
