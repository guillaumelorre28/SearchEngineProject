 given by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, at the Tory party conference in 
October has been officially recorded as a hate incident, police have confirmed.


Rudd said in her speech that she wanted to make it harder for British 
companies to employ migrants and to ensure foreign workers “were not taking 
jobs British workers could do”.

The speech was followed by a background briefing by an aide who suggested 
firms could be required topublish lists

When the Tories talk about curbs on foreign workers, they don’t mean me. Or do 
they?

Media coverage of the speech so alarmed an Oxford University physics 
professor, Joshua Silver, that he complained to the police. “I felt politicians 
have been using hate speech to turn Britons against foreigners, and I thought 
that is probably not lawful,” he told the Times.

His complaint was dealt with by West Midlands police as the Tory conference 
took place in Birmingham.

National police reporting rules introduced in 2014 and endorsed by Rudd 
herself require all complaints of hate crime incidents to be recorded 
“regardless of whether or not those making the complaint are the victim and 
irrespective of whether or not there is any evidence to identify the hate crime 
incident”.

West Midlands police have now written to the professor saying they have 
concluded an assessment of his complaint and they will not be investigating 
Rudd’s speech as a hate crime. “The matter has been recorded in line with the 
National Police Chiefs’ Council manual as a non-crime hate incident,” the force 
told the professor.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “This was not a hate crime. The home 
secretary has been crystal clear that hatred has absolutely no place in a 
Britain that works for everyone. She’s made countering hate one of her key 
priorities; indeed, one of the first public interventions she made was to 
launch the hate crime action plan.”

The policy of blanket recording of all complaints of hate crime incidents was 
drawn up by the College of Policing in 2014 with the justification that 
increased reporting would help police to tackle hate crime more effectively.
