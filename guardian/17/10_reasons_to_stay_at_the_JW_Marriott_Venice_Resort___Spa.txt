Everything is personalised
Nothing at the spa of the resort is “off the shelf” – and that includes 
massages that are personalised right down to which homegrown herb you’d like 
added to the hotel’s own olive oil.

It’s on the Hot List
Condé Nast Traveller’s 2016 Hot List tips the retreat’s unique physicality and 
family friendliness. “Here is an eminently sensible way to do Venice with 
children in tow, dabbling in the tourist mayhem and then retreating – grownups 
to the spa and kids to the family pool, or to the cooking school or the 
volleyball court. Nowhere else inLa Serenissima has this much breathing room.” 

It’s located on a private island
Isola delle Rose, the private island home of the JW Marriott Venice Resort & 
Spa

, is 16 hectares of tranquility built for reconnecting mind with body, and busy 
people with family and nature. “How many times in your life do you get to enjoy 
yoga facing the Venice skyline?” asks Linda Bertoni, communication manager of 
the resort.

It’s pet-friendly
It’s not just humans who get the red carpet treatment. Pets are welcome, too. 
If you haven’t extended your family yet, don’t worry – you can spend a few 
hours playing withMaximus <https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/maximusatjw/>
, the resident golden-haired pooch.

It’s sporting and social
Whatever your taste, there’s something to entice you off the daybed and into 
your trainers. “We know that visitors are motivated by the social element, it’s 
a real trend – and we’ve used that to get people playing football or to do 
group runs around our park, for example. Sport brings people together,” says 
Bertoni.

Wellbeing extends to the staff
It’s a good sign when a company knows how to look after its staff as well as 
its guests. The resort has rolled out the Take Care programme, which encourages 
employees to get stuck into exercise on site and adopt healthy eating habits.

It has a Michelin-starred restaurant
Dopolavoro is the hotel’s Michelin-starred restaurant, led by chef Giancarlo 
Perbellini and coordinated by chef Federico Belluco. Dopolavoro translates as 
“after work” in Italian, and is therefore the right reward for an extended 
break away from the office.

The uplifting architecture
Architect Matteo Thun created smart but homely spaces out of the original 
structures on the island using reclaimed brick and wood. The spa, rooms and 
villas are flooded with natural light. And, of course, there’s that 360-degree 
view of Venice and the surrounding Laguna Veneta.

You can connect with nature
Roam Isola delle Rose on a courtesy bike and explore fertile parkland that 
dates back to 1870. The microclimate around the island has seen the rise of 
olive, palm and lime trees, willows and larches. Perfect for picnics or a 
meditative pause.

It’s getting even better next year …
Make 2017 the year to recharge your energy levels. “Next season we are 
planning an extensive, immersive wellness experience. We’re bringing healthy 
menus, fitness, wellbeing and detoxing together as one,” says Bertoni.
