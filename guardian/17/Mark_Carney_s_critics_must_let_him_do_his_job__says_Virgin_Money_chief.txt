Virgin Money’s chief executive has called on Mark Carney’s critics to let him 
get on with his job following his clarification of his departure date from the
Bank of England <https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor>.

Jayne-Anne Gadhia said the Bank’s governor had helped soothe fears about 
Brexit immediately after the EU referendum and that his decision to stay in the 
job until June 2019 would help bring stability.


She said the economy’s resilience in the months since the vote was in part due 
to Carney’s interventions, which included cutting interest rates, to shore up 
confidence.

Gadhia said: “Thank goodness for that would be my comment. When I think back 
to 24 June when an awful lot of people wondered who was leading the country I 
was pretty relieved whenMark Carney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> stepped up and was sensible. 
We need stability going forward.”

Carney’s future became the subject of intense speculation after a string of 
attacks on him by senior Conservatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/criticising-mark-carney-tory-hobby-bank-england-governor>
, including calls for him to resign. The Canadian had planned to leave the Bank 
in June 2018 after five yearsbut on Monday he agreed to stay an extra year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-extra-year-bank-of-england-governor>
 to see the UK through the process of leaving the EU.

Brexit campaigners criticised Carney during the referendum campaign for 
predicting a vote for Brexit would be bad for the economy. Since the vote, 
Conservatives have accused him of talking down the economy and others,including 
Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-theresa-may-bank-of-england-tory-conference>
, have criticised the harmful effects of low interest rates on savers.

Gadhia said criticism came with the job of Bank governor but she said with his 
future settled and with uncertain times ahead for the economy Carney should be 
left to concentrate on helping steer Britain through Brexit.

“How difficult to have a job where we are all able to comment. When you take 
on a big role like that you have to be a public figure and expect to have 
public comment. I don’t criticise people for making the comments they have 
made. I do think now he is here we should let him get on with his job. 
Hopefully that will add to the stability of the country.”


Gadhia made her comments as Virgin Money announced steady trading for the 
first nine months of the year. Gross mortgage lending increased 19% to £6.5bn 
from a year earlier and credit card balances rose 14% to £28.9bn from the end 
of December as deposits increased 12% to £28.3bn.

Virgin Money, backed by Sir Richard Branson, tightened its credit card lending 
after the referendum because of concerns about the economy, slowing lending 
growth in the third quarter.

Gadhia, who like Branson wanted Britain to stay in the EU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/06/europe-good-business-not-market-cant-decide-in-out-referendum>
, said she had seen no change in customers’ behaviour since the referendum and 
that the economy had performed better than she expected.

“That gives us an optimistic view of the future. It’s tempered by some 
caution, not because we see an economic downturn necessarily … but because the 
future is uncertain. Everybody needs to look forward with some caution.”
