A golf-and-hotel complex on the west coast of Ireland has applied to construct 
extensive dune erosion defences to mitigate the effects of erosion “due to sea 
level rise and increased Atlantic storminess”. An investigation by theUS news 
website Politico 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-climate-change-golf-course-223436>
 found that the environmental impact statement included with the application 
specifically uses climate change to justify the defence scheme. “If the 
predictions of an increase in sea level rise as a result of global warming 
prove correct … it is likely that there will be a corresponding increase in 
coastal erosion rates,” it says.

Why is this interesting? Because the resort in question is the Trump 
International Golf Links and Hotel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/11/donald-trump-irish-golf-scotland-windfarm>
. The golf course, for as long as it remains above water, is owned by a US 
presidential candidate, who hasdismissed global warming 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/23/donald-trump-says-climate-change-is-a-hoax-but-tries-to-protect/>
 as a “total hoax”. He’s alsocalled it “bullshit” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/18/obama-year-end-press-conference-climate-change-republicans>
 and a con, and although he now claims it was a jokehe once tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385> that global 
warming was invented by the Chinese to make US manufacturing less competitive.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to 
make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.

In September, Trump said Barack Obama’s climate strategy was trying “to solve 
a problem that I don’t think in any major fashion exists”.

But the disappearing golf course is no hoax. Shortly before Trump concluded 
the deal to buy it, in 2014, a storm carried off eight metres of beach. On a 
visit last week Trump’s sonEric told the Irish Times 
<http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/eric-trump-opens-redesigned-doonbeg-golf-course-1.2648885>
: “You have a couple more storms and, quite frankly, that course doesn’t exist.”

To suggest that Trump is willing to put his business interests ahead of his 
beliefs would be to imply he has beliefs in the first place. Does he secretly 
accept global warming, or is he just pretending it exists to get this sea wall 
built? The latter scenario would imply he at least read theenvironmental impact 
statement <http://www.eplanning.ie/ClareCC/AppFileRefDetails/16371/0> – which 
is, I can attest, really long and boring – submitted to Clare county council on 
his behalf. Anyway, it has been shown over and over that Trump’s core 
supporters aren’t troubled by questions about his integrity or his consistency. 
They like him like this.

So far, one person has filed a submission objecting to Trump’s planning 
application, but on the grounds that the erosion management works would have a 
negative impact on a special conservation area, and not because global warming 
is bullshit. There’s still time.

Money for nothing

I sympathise with the Radio 4 Today presenter Justin Webb, who described in 
the Radio Timeshaving to defend himself 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3605841/My-daughter-outraged-earn-doing-says-Radio-4-presenter-Justin-Webb.html>
 to his daughter for earning more than the prime minister. I don’t sympathise 
because I earn more than the PM, but because I too have faced the withering 
accusation Webb’s daughter levelled at him: “But you don’t do anything,” she 
said. In his defence Webb maintained that his job required him to get up 
extremely early. “But you just read things out,” she said. “Literally, Daddy, 
you just read for a living.”

I wish I could plausibly claim to my children that I rose at dawn to read 
aloud, but they’re usually out of the house before I wake up. As a freelance 
writer, I accept that my job doesn’t look like much to the untrained observer. 
To my children it just looks like a man who is sitting in front of a computer 
but not using it. And I accept that on some days when they arrive home earlier 
than I expect, it might look more like a man eating custard creams in front of 
Bargain Hunt.

Testing times

With all my children in the middle of exams, I am making a temporary effort to 
seem more administratively engaged when they’re around as a sort of show of 
support. But their exam schedules mean they come and go at weird hours, and all 
the looking busy is starting to get me down. I can’t carry on working like 
this, not even for the prime minister’s money.
