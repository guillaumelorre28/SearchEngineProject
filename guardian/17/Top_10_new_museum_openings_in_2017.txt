A landmark opening, and not just for South Africa, the Zeitz Museum of 
Contemporary Art Africa will be the biggest museum to open on the continent for 
over a century. It will be an influential place too: the $38m institution will 
be filled entirely with work created since the year 2000, and house the 
impressive collection of Jochen Zeitz (German philanthropist and former CEO of 
Puma), while it continues to acquire work of its own. The museum will be inside 
the 57-metre-high Grain Silo, a towering reminder of Cape Town’s industrial 
heritage – and soon to be a symbol of its creative future.

The reconstruction of EMST has been quite a tale, with over a decade financial 
and bureaucratic setbacks. Still, in October 2016 it was finally ready for a 
soft launch, inaugurating the temporary exhibition space with the show Urgent 
Conversations: Athens–Antwerp in its newly reconstructed home in the old Fix 
brewery. The permanent collection is pegged to be unveiled in autumn 2017, when 
the museum is expected to finally open in its entirety.

Indonesia will get its first museum dedicated to international modern art this 
year, when MACAN, the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Nusantara, opens 
its doors. With spacious interiors designed by London-based MET Studio Design, 
the museum will feature works from the collection of Indonesian philanthropist

With a new logo designed by Mark Bradford, which is meant to evoke the unique 
urban pace of Los Angeles, the ICA LA represents a rebranding and rehousing of 
the Santa Monica Museum of Art. It opens in the autumn in a new location in the 
Downtown LA arts district. Its new space aims to bring together “architecture, 
urban design, and sustainability to create cutting-edge environments for 
exhibitions, education, dialogue, and collaboration”.

With US politics as polarised as it is, there has perhaps never been a better 
time to reflect on the history of the country. This museum does just that; 
taking a non-partisan view of the revolutionary period through thousands of 
objects, artworks, manuscripts and artefacts. Exhibitions will take visitors on 
a chronological journey, from the roots of resistance to the legacy of its 
outcome.

One of the world’s most influential fashion designers, Yves Saint Laurent is 
also the only designer of his generation who has systematically archived his 
work since creating his couture house in the 1960s. This year two museums will 
open, in Paris and Marrakech, to house the thousands of garments, accessories, 
sketches, photographs and objects that represent his life’s work. The Parisian 
museum will be in the historical couture house at 5 avenue Marceau, which has 
been converted over the last year. The Marrakech museum will be an impressive 
new build, near Jardin Majorelle – a garden long associated with the designer.

This epic international collaboration between France and Abu Dhabi has had its 
opening date pushed back several times over the years (it was originally to be 
completed in 2012). This year, however, will hopefully see the ambitious new 
museum open its doors to the public. Designed by award-winning architecture 
firm Ateliers Jean Nouvel, the museum “city” consists of a series of white 
buildings inspired by the Arab medina.
