Royal Bank of Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup> is being forced 
to justify if the £400m it has set aside to compensate small business customers 
will be large enough to meet the claims from those who argue they have been 
mistreated by the bailed-out bank.

Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, 
has asked the 73% taxpayer-owned bank if the £400m is an underestimation of the 
cost of compensating customers of its defunct global restructuring group (GRG).

In a letter to the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, Tyrie said campaigners 
had asked for the bank to pay out £2bn in compensation.

Tyrie wrote to McEwan – and Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial 
Conduct Authority – after last month’s move by RBS toapologise to small 
business customers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/rbs-facing-400m-bill-to-compensate-small-business-customers>
 and pledge to issue them with refunds of fees and allow them to make fresh 
complaints about their treatment between 2008 and 2013.

At the time RBS said it expected to spend £400m on the process, which has 
followed three years of campaigning by customers. The issue with GRGfirst 
surfaced in 2013 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/25/rbs-accused-business-profits-regulators>
 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman, compiled a dossier alleging the bank 
deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits.

Tyrie set out a series of questions for McEwan which included providing 
details of the timescale for the payouts and information about whether firms 
which went into liquidation would receive payments.

The MP also asked Bailey when the regulator would publish its findings into 
GRG. The report – known as a section 166 report – is long delayed and may not 
be published in full until the individuals mentioned have been able to review 
it, in a process known as “Maxwellisation”.

In his letter to Bailey (pdf) 
<http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/treasury/Correspondence/Treasury-Committee-Chair-to-Andrew-Bailey-FCA-05-12-16.pdf>
, Tyrie also asked for the Treasury select committee to receive the agreement 
between RBS and the FCA about the redress scheme. “This should include any 
application made by RBS to the FCA for approval of the new review complaints 
procedure,” the letter said.

As he published his correspondence, Tyrie said: “More detail on the design of 
the scheme is needed. This could give affected businesses more confidence that 
they will obtain reasonable compensation. The regulator should publish its full 
report into GRG as soon as possible.”

Both RBS and the FCA said they would respond to Tyrie in due course. RBS 
shares closed up almost 6% at 209p – still below the 502p average price 
taxpayers paid for the stake during 2008 and 2009.
