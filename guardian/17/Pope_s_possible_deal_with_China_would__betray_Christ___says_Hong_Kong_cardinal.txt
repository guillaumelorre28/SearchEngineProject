The most senior Chinese Catholic has slammed a potential rapprochement between 
theVatican <https://www.theguardian.com/world/vatican> and Beijing, saying it 
would be “betraying Jesus Christ”, amid a thaw in more than six decades of 
bitter relations.

Talk of a deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/pope-francis-targets-deal-with-china-in-year-of-mercy-vatican-bishops>
 between the two sides has been building for months, with some saying the 
diplomatic coup for Pope Francis would be resolving the highly controversial 
issue of allowing China’s Communist government to have a hand in selecting 
bishops.

But Cardinal Joseph Zen <http://catholic.org.hk/v2/en/cdhk/a02cardinal.html>, 
the 84-year-old former bishop of Hong Kong, has been an outspoken critic, 
saying any agreement where Beijing would have a hand in approving clergy would 
be “a surrender”.

“Maybe the pope is a little naive, he doesn’t have the background to know the 
Communists in China,” Zen said at the Salesian school inHong Kong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong> where he still teaches. “The pope 
used to know the persecuted Communists [in Latin America], but he may not know 
the Communist persecutors who have killed hundreds of thousands.”

Chinese Catholics are free to go to mass and attend government-sanctioned 
churches, but barred from proselytising. The state-controlledChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> Catholic Patriotic Association 
controls the church and appoints bishops, currently without any input from the 
Vatican.

An “underground” Catholic church exists, with some estimates saying it is 
larger than the official one, and its members and clergy have faced persecution 
by authorities.

Protestant Christians also face similar challenges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/christian-church-leader-hu-shigen-jailed-chinese-human-rights-crackdown>
, and a recent campaign by authorities in eastern China has seen more than1,200 
crosses removed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/07/china-christians-removal-church-crosses-continues>
 from buildings and churches demolished.

Zen complained that most supporters of the deal did not truly know China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china>, lacking first-hand experience with 
the state of the church under the Communists. He spent seven years frequently 
teaching in cities across China in the wake of the1989 Tiananmen Square massacre
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/tiananmen-square-protests-1989>, a bloody 
crackdown on pro-democracy protesters that was followed by severe tightening of 
freedom of expression and religion.

One motivation for the Vatican is the relatively small number of Catholics in 
a country filled with people who are increasingly searching for meaning in 
their lives. There areroughly 10 million Catholics 
<http://www.hsstudyc.org.hk/en/china/en_cinfo_china_stat15.htmlhttp://www.hsstudyc.org.hk/en/china/en_cinfo_china_stat15.html>
, just a 10th of the overall number of Christians in the country.

The people sooner or later will see the bishops are puppets of the government
Cardinal Joseph Zen 
With “fake freedom” under a proposed deal, priests could more easily preach 
and more churches would open, Zen predicted, but “it’s only the impression of 
freedom, it’s not real freedom, the people sooner or later will see the bishops 
are puppets of the government and not really the shepherds of the flock.”

“The official bishops are not really preaching the gospel,” Zen added “They 
are preaching obedience to Communist authority.”

Francesco Sisci, an Italian scholar and journalist who is based in Beijing, 
said “a very wide-ranging agreement” appeared to be on the horizon but that it 
remained unclear exactly when the deal would be unveiled. No observers expected 
it to lead to full diplomatic relations.

Sisci, who conducted a rare interview with Pope Francis 
<http://www.atimes.com/at-exclusive-pope-francis-urges-world-not-to-fear-chinas-rise/>
 at the start of this year in which the leader of the Catholic church backed 
the idea of dialogue with Beijing, said he believed the deal would represent a 
“a major breakthrough” for China, the Vatican and people of all faiths.

Sisci rejected the idea that the Vatican was abandoning its principles by 
engaging with Beijing and claimed many within the church leadership believed it 
would be more effective to talk to China’s Communist leaders than to “wage war” 
against them on issues such as human rights and religious freedom.

“The church doesn’t want crusades … and doesn’t want to start a new one with 
China,” he said.

The Italian academic said he believed the pope thought the church could play 
“a crucial role in helping China move into the modern world, to become a modern 
society”.

“He may be naive but it is his job being naive, being a man of faith,” Sisci 
added.

But that naivety could harm the Catholic church in China for decades to come, 
according to Zen, and a perception is building that the pope is pushing a pact 
he may not fully understand.

“You cannot go into negotiations with the mentality ‘we want to sign an 
agreement at any cost’, then you are surrendering yourself, you are betraying 
yourself, you are betraying Jesus Christ,” Zen lamented.

“If you cannot get a good deal, an acceptable deal, then the Vatican should 
walk away and maybe try again later,” he added. “Could the church negotiate 
with Hitler? Could it negotiate with Stalin? No.”

Ordinary Catholics who attend the government-controlled church welcome the 
negotiations as any deal would legitimise what is essentially a schismatic 
church.

Chinese society needs faith right now
Zhao, Catholic church attendee 
“If they could really strike a deal, not only would us Catholics be happy, but 
all of the Chinese people should rejoice,” said Zhao, 36, who has been a 
Catholic for 20 years and works at the oldest Catholic church in China, close 
to Tiananmen Square in Beijing. He declined to give his full name because of 
the sensitivity of discussing religion.

“Chinese society needs faith right now,” he added, saying a warming of ties 
would increase the number of Catholics, “which is a benefit to all society”.

But Zen warned that gains, diplomatically and in the number of faithful, could 
be short-lived.


In the long run people would leave the church as they became disillusioned 
with the “fake” institution, Zen said, adding “the clergy need to side with the 
people, the poor and the persecuted, not to government”.

“The blood of the martyrs is the seed of new Christians,” Zen said. “If that 
blood is poisoned, how long will those new Christians last?”
