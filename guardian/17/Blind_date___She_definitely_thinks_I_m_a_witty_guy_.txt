Aaron on Alice

What were you hoping for?
Someone who shared my zest for life.

First impressions?
She was a really friendly and happy person. It got the evening off to a good 
start.

What did you talk about?
Travelling, which we are both really passionate about.

Any awkward moments?
No, not at all. Hopefully she didn’t mind me taking photos of the food.

Good table manners?
Yes.

Best thing about Alice?
Her energy.

Would you introduce her to your friends?
Yeah, definitely. I think they’d like her, too.

Describe her in three words
Fun, outgoing, enthusiastic.

What do you think she made of you?
She definitely thinks I’m a very funny and witty guy. And most certainly a 
“snappy” dresser.

Did you go on somewhere?
We were actually having such a great time over dinner, we had to dash to catch 
the last train.

And... did you kiss?
A cute kiss on the cheek at the end of the night – but not before exchanging 
numbers.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I regrettably passed up on the apple and plum crumble in lieu of the panettone.

Marks out of 10?
9.

Would you meet again?
Yeah, definitely.
