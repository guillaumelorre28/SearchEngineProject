Parts of England could shiver through temperatures well below freezing while 
northernScotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> basks in much milder 
weather, forecasters have predicted.

Met Office spokeswoman Emma Sillitoe said clear skies would help push 
temperatures to below freezing for areas south of Manchester on Tuesday night.

“We could see -6C (21F) or -7C (19F) around the Midlands and quite widely 
below freezing, so even in London we could see -2C (28F),” she said.

Meanwhile, cloud coverage further north will keep temperatures above freezing, 
with Inverness reaching 5C (41F) overnight.

There was a similar picture on Monday night. South Newington in Oxfordshire 
was the coldest place in the UK overnight, with a temperature of -7.5C (18.5F), 
while Bala, in Gwynedd, north-west Wales, reached -6.2C (21F).

The chilly conditions will continue into Wednesday morning. Sillitoe said 
there would be a “cold, crisp start to southern and central areas” with frost. 
“People will have to scrape the windows on their cars again,” she added.

The north-south divide will also continue into Wednesday. Glasgow is expected 
to peak at 9C (48F), and Edinburgh and Belfast at 8C (46F), while London is 
predicted to reach a high of 5C (41F), with Cardiff edging towards 4C (39F).

The arrival of colder weather comes as the Local Government Association’s 
(LGA) annual winter readiness survey shows that councils are well prepared with 
substantial grit stocks.

About half are at the limit of their storage capacity, and the LGA said 
gritters would be out treating thousands of miles of roads whenever overnight 
temperatures dropped below zero in the coming days.

LGA transport spokesman Martin Tett said: “We are well prepared for the cold, 
with 1.2m tonnes of salt stockpiled and a fleet of state-of-the-art gritters 
ready to be deployed.”

Public Health England has also warned people to remember that “cold does kill” 
even in places that are not experiencing the worst weather.

The start of December marks the beginning of meteorological winter, which 
lasts until the end of February.
