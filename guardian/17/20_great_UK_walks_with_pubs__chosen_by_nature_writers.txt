Refuel: Craven Arms, Appletreewick

Anyone who grows up in or around the Yorkshire dales ends up carrying it with 
them. There’s something about the crumpled-duvet landscapes of emerald field 
and heathery fell, about encountering its sudden, Shire-like valleys threaded 
with muscular peat rivers, about stumbling across a ruined abbey at dusk or 
drinking well-earned beers by pub fires that forever sticks in the head and the 
heart.

One of the national park’s greatest pubs has to be the Craven Arms 
<http://www.craven-cruckbarn.co.uk/> at Appletreewick (mains from £8.95). 
Tucked into the fell above the river Wharfe, and the halfway point of a 
wonderful 11-mile circular walk from Grassington, it could go toe to toe with 
anywhere for the title of “perfect country pub”. Its standout feature is the 
“cruck barn” at the back, built by the owner using traditional materials and 
the first in the dale for 400 years.

Reaching the Craven Arms from the village of Grassington is akin to drinking a 
neat shot of the dales. Cross the river by the photogenic Linton Falls before 
climbing up to the gorgeous hamlet of Thorpe through fields threaded with 
dry-stone walls. Carry on through meadows where lapwings “pee-wit” and a stray 
foot may startle a hare into pulsing flight, to reach Burnsall and what has to 
be the most photographed bridge in the dales. Cross the river and follows signs 
for Appletreewick, and find the Craven Arms close to the Mock Beggar Hall, an 
old monastic grange that testifies to the village’s connection to nearby Bolton 
Abbey. Below the pub is a fantastic wild swimming spot.

The five and half miles back are most atmospheric if you time it to arrive in 
Grassington at dusk. Return to Burnsall and then take the historic riverside 
path north-west, crossing the suspension bridge at Hebden. Along the way enjoy 
woodsmoke from farmhouse chimneys; the quiet grandeur of autumnal trees bronzed 
by late light, ground mist around their roots; the gurgling rush and calm of 
the river; and the unforgettable, far-reaching fells, alive with the bleats of 
Swaledale sheep, gradually bruising into black.

Autumn’s true glories are experienced through trees: the turning of leaves 
from greens to fiery yellows and reds; the wine-black clusters of berries and 
nuts on drooping branches; the musty smell of leaf litter as shafts of sun 
streak the damp earth.

A mile from my home on the northern edge of Harrogate, a thickly wooded river 
gorge provides the perfect stage to witness the splendour of autumn.

Enter the Nidd Gorge by following the Sustrans cycleway 67 
<http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-67> from Bilton to the defunct 
Victorian viaduct that spans the river. After taking in the viaduct’s views, 
descend and wind along for four miles of sylvan splendour to Knaresborough, 
slowing to the river’s pace and stepping through the dioramas of alder, oak, 
beech, chestnut, birch and waterside pines that lean over the mirror-like 
surface to create breathtaking patterns with their reflections.

There are kingfishers here; buzzards and dippers too. Once I watched for 10 
minutes as an otter threaded its way between bank, tree root and water, fishing 
for trout. Expect some mysterious, melancholic human traces, too – weirs and 
old mills reduced to rubble, strange caves – before the stunning reveal of 
Knaresborough’s commanding (and still-working) railway viaduct, the town’s 
tumble of handsome houses and, perched above, the ruins of Knaresborough Castle.

Walkers can break the circuit at Carriages (£10.95 for two courses at 
lunchtime), where the food is plentiful and delicious.

The return loops back along the Beryl Burton cycleway (Sustrans 636 
<http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-636>) and above the trees, on 
to the high ground from where Cromwell’s cannons pounded the royalist castle. 
Skirting the woods – stopping to pick sloes and crab apples – you may see roe 
deer, reminders of when this area was part of the medieval Royal Hunting Forest 
of Knaresborough.

Passing 17th-century Bilton Hall, follow the old track through the furrowed 
farm fields and the flaming trees back to the start, completing an idyllic 
autumn circuit.RC

Refuel: Ty Coch tavern, Porthdinllaen

The Ty Coch <http://www.tycoch.co.uk/> tavern (mains from £9.95), in 
Porthdinllaen <https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/porthdinllaen> on the old 
pilgrim route to Bardsey Island, exercises an inexorable pull for pilgrims of 
every creed as walkers, sailors, fishermen, golfers and lovers of craft beers 
converge on this beachfront pub.

The village used to be a substantial community, with a sailmaker and a 
coaching inn for travellers sailing to Dublin. Today, a handful of fishermen 
catch whelks, scallops and lobsters, and the Ty Coch is the only pub. The 
landlord, Stuart Webley and his family are the beach’s last permanent residents.

An excellent circular (clockwise) walk to Porthdinllaen starts in the inland 
village of Edern (park by the Ship Inn). Take the footpath from the wooden 
footbridge next to the butcher’s shop along the western bank of the Afon 
Geirch. Head north in the direction of the coast. Cross the stream in front of 
Porthdynllaen Farm and follow it until you meet the farm track, then hard left 
until you pick up the footpath again on the other side of the farmyard.

Pass by the campsite at the farm and follow the river, now on its eastern 
bank, to the rocky beach at Abergeirch. Stone steps will take you to the cliff 
path – the Wales Coast Path. A colony of seals live off the rocks at Life Boat 
Bay. When mackerel are in season it’s not unusual to see a pod of dolphins from 
the cliff. Rejoin the beach at Life Boat Bay and follow the coastal path to the 
Ty Coch.

Proud to be a chip-free zone, the Ty Coch provides carbs in a superb list of 
bottled craft beers, two local tap beers and a revolving guest ale. The saloon 
is the beach, with a great view of Anglesey, though you’d be surprised how many 
people can cram inside when it rains.

After lunch continue along the beach to Morfa Nefyn, enjoying superb views of 
the Yr Eifl hills until the road meets the beach below the Cliffs pub. Walk 
straight over at the crossroads, then turn right at the T-junction and take the 
footpath along the B4417 back into Edern. An alternative that avoids the road 
is to cut back across the golf course and follow the coastal path back to 
Abergeirch. To do this turn right (past Café Porth Dinllaen) instead of heading 
straight at the crossroads.

Refuel: The Brittania Inn <http://thebritanniainn.com/>

Lingmoor Fell, at 469m, is a modest climb from Elterwater village but steep 
enough to give a sense of achievement. It stands alone, affording superb views 
beyond Elterwater to Windermere. Head south out of the village, crossing the 
stone bridge over Great Langdale Beck and turn right and follow the lane 
(marked “Coniston challenging option” for cycles) alongside Sawrey’s Wood. It 
soon becomes a rough track, and at Dale End Farm (about a mile from the start) 
you will see the gate up on to the fell.


The trail is the old quarry path. A slate seat below the summit affords lovely 
views and you could follow this path to just below the summit, but I would 
follow the path along the ridge wall for a while instead and enjoy the views of 
Great Carrs, Wet Side Edge and Harter Fell. Descend by the same route and enjoy 
the views of Little Langdale Tarn. There is an alternative track that descends 
steeply into Sawrey’s Wood and begins a little to the east of the quarry path, 
though it can be tricky to spot. Do take a map!

The Brittania Inn <http://thebritanniainn.com/> (mains from £12) at Elterwater 
jolts you back 500 years with its low roof and whitewashed facade. Anna and 
Andrew Parker have run it since 1978 and the welcome is always warm, the food 
substantial. There is a great range of ales with names such as Neddy Goggle, 
and several brewed for the pub, including Britannia Gold.KN

Refuel: The Rhydspence Inn <http://www.rhydspence.com/>, Whitney-on-Wye

Setting out from the famous book town of Hay-on-Wye, this six-mile stroll 
starts along the western edge of the Wye. Immediately after the bridge, follow 
the path through an elevated riverine copse before dropping down to the banks. 
After a couple of miles along the valley floor, the path reaches Bronydd Farm. 
To avoid the busy A438, leave Offa’s Dyke here and head up to the steep pitch 
behind the roadside hamlet of Bronydd. The path eventually brings you out at 
Bettws Dingle, where you turn briefly west before heading back on yourself 
towards the river. Zigzagging along the contours of the hills will take you 
past Upper Bettws farm and on to Old House. Just before reaching the latter, 
bend right along the track and down through an old wood. Then it’s all downhill 
to the pub.

A splendid 14th-century coaching house, the Rhydspence Inn 
<http://www.rhydspence.com/> has been welcoming footsore travellers for 
centuries. The exterior is a gorgeous assemblage of squiggly timber beams and 
off-kilter windows. If a building could be happily sozzled, this age-old public 
house would be. At the rear, the garden slopes down towards the Wye: a perfect 
spot for a pint on a sunny afternoon. Along the southern perimeter, a brook 
marks the England-Wales border, its narrow banks keeping St George and the 
Dragon at arm’s length.

Inside, the atmosphere of a traditional country pub lives on, from the heavy 
oak front door and creaking corridors to the cubbyhole bar and open-hearth 
fire. Upstairs are seven bedrooms with delightful views.

The bar menu features all the pub favourites – steak and ale pie, lasagne, 
scampi, fish and chips, at around £10 – alongside baguettes and ciabatta rolls 
at lunchtime. The restaurant menu is a little more ambitious, with starters 
that include Thai fish cakes and smoked duck breast salad. For mains, the 
options are fairly meat-heavy (this is hill farmers’ country, after all). Welsh 
lamb casserole (£15) is a favourite.

In the western Brecon Beacons, Llyn y Fan Fach (literally “lake of the small 
beacon-hill”) is an overlooked gem. From the village, follow a steep stony 
track for about 40 minutes to the lip of the now-dammed glacial lake. Encircled 
above by a searing escarpment, this magnificent oval-shaped expanse of cold 
cobalt blue is rich in myth and mystery (the most popular folktale tells of a 
beautiful fairy girl rising from the lake and begetting three sons who would 
become famed physicians).

A looping path climbs westwards up the ridge above the lake and eventually 
round to the summit of Picws Du. On a clear day, the panoramic views are some 
of the best in Wales: Swansea Bay to the south, then the Pembrokeshire coast, 
the Epynt northward and then eastwards over the Brecon Beacons.

Continue along to the spur of Fan Foel and then down to the gully on the far 
side, where a faint path leads you off the mountain and back to the lake below. 
For a longer walk, carry on after Fan Foel to Fan Brycheiniog and then descend 
to a second, larger glacial lake (Llyn y Fan Fawr). Loop around the water’s 
southern edge and then circle back along peaty moorland to the start.

Because of the walk’s remoteness, the nearest pubs all require a short drive. 
For a classic locals’ hang-out, you can’t beat theTanners Arms 
<http://tannersarmspub.com/> in nearby Defynnog. Run by the ever-amiable Brenda 
and her chef-husband Alan, this cosy freehouse is a particular dream for craft 
ale and cider lovers. The walls are decorated with hundreds of pump clips, each 
denoting a bygone barrel consumed on the premises. Current specials on the 
cider board include the joyous-sounding Hairy Ferret, Crazy Goat and Farmer 
Jim’s Rootin Tootin. There’s even a zero-alcohol “beer” for dogs too (chicken 
or beef flavours, £2 a bottle).

Food is served either in the bar area or in a smart dining room next door, on 
the walls of which hang prints by local photographer Martin Dyde.

Given the pub’s location in the heart of rural Wales, entrées of Chinese duck 
spring rolls, Spanish dried meats, Japanese miso soup and onion bhajis speak to 
a surprisingly cosmopolitan palate. There’s no messing with the main dishes, 
which are solid, appetite-appeasing walkers’ fare from start to finish, such as 
lamb shank and pumpkin curry pie.OB

Road

To access this pleasant but slightly desolate former holiday location, take 
the train to Benfleet, from where you can walk across the bridge on to Canvey 
Island, home toDr Feelgood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/12/dr-feelgood-all-through-review> 
and recently chronicled in Julian Temple’s filmOil City Confidential 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/04/oil-city-confidential-review>. 
Turn right straight after the causeway, and follow the path that takes you 
round the island anti-clockwise. This leads first to empty grassland edged by 
deep narrow inlets marking the edge of the island and criss-crossed by drainage 
ditches. The walk is straightforward, easy to follow and surprisingly varied.

Keep the water to your right and eventually arrive at the Thames by the oil 
storage depot. Great jetties like a giant’s extended fingers reach out into the 
river all around you, and then, having probably not seen a soul all morning, 
you arrive at a caravan park and then a pub in quick succession. You are just 
about halfway round the island by now. The pub is theLobster Smack 
<http://www.thelobstersmackcanveyisland.co.uk/>, which is pretty and wooden 
from the outside and cosy inside, with decent pub grub. I had the beer-battered 
cod and chips (£9.79) accompanied by a pint of Blue Moon (without a slice of 
orange).

If the landscape so far reminds you of every TV adaptation you’ve ever seen of 
Great Expectations and you’ve found it hard to shake off the image of Abel 
Magwitch being pursued across the mudflats, it’s not surprising, because the 
Lobster Smack is the inn in the Dickens novel.

Restored, press on round the island, following the sea wall with its vibrant 
graffiti, past the lure of amusement arcades and a small beach. Canvey became a 
fashionable place for Londoners to visit during the Victorian era after its air 
was promoted as having healing properties.

Turning away from the Thames, continue round to the creeks and an old harbour, 
a dangerous eerie empty landscape of mud and brown water. Then there are new 
developments of large detached houses, a golf course and the view back to
Hadleigh Country Park <http://hadleighcountrypark.co.uk/> and the wooded 
Benfleet Downs on the mainland, a world away from this treeless, flat, 
low-lying island. Return to the causeway to Benfleet station in the near 
distance.

Not everyone associates Richmond with rock’n’roll, but exit Richmond station 
using the main entrance and straight across the road is the site of the Station 
Hotel, where the Crawdaddy Club debuted a host of famous acts during the 1960s, 
including the Rolling Stones.

Cross the road at the traffic lights and go down Old Station Passage. Turn 
left at the end and walk a few yards until you get to Richmond Green. Cross the 
common, using the paths on a diagonally right direction, aiming for Old Palace 
Lane. Follow Old Palace Lane until you reach the river and turn left. Walk with 
the river on your right and go under Richmond Bridge. Continue with the river 
on your right as you leave the town behind and you enter countryside.

The river begins a gentle curve to the right and you’ll walk past Petersham 
Meadows, with its herd of cows. Enjoy the sights, sounds and smell of the river 
as you head towards Ham House. You’ll be about three miles into your eight-mile 
walk now. With the river still on your right, not far past Ham House, you see 
Eel Pie Island in the middle of the river. The island was the site of the now 
legendary Eel Pie Island Hotel where artists including the Rolling Stones, The 
Who, Rod Stewart and Eric Clapton performed regularly throughout the 1960s.

Keep pushing on past Teddington Lock and with the suburbs of Kingston 
emerging, you will soon arrive at Canbury Gardens riverside park. Here you’ll 
find theBoaters Inn <http://www.boaterskingston.com/>. You’ve now walked nearly 
five miles and will have earned something to eat and drink. I had vegetarian 
kedgeree with hard-boiled egg, marinated tofu, curried rice, red chilli, 
parsley, spring onion and cashews (£12). Looking around, the beer-battered cod 
(£12.50) seemed very popular. There’s a constantly changing parade of local 
beers and I washed my meal down with a pint of Dark Star Hophead.

After leaving the pub, stick to the riverside with the river still on your 
right until you come to Kingston Bridge. Cross the bridge and turn immediately 
left, heading down to the riverbank, with the river on your left. Continue 
walking alongside the river as it makes its majestic sedate way to Hampton 
Court Palace. This part of the walk is approximately three miles. You can’t 
help but be impressed with the history on show here (but be aware that entry to 
the palace and gardens costs a hefty £19.80). Cross over the river once more on 
Hampton Court Bridge and Hampton Court station, with its regular trains back to 
Richmond or London’s Waterloo, is right in front of you.DG

Refuel: The Byre Inn <http://www.byreinn.co.uk/>, Brig o’Turk

In the 20 years since Glen Finglas was removed from the grasp of commercial 
forestry, I have watched with wonder as it has transformed into burgeoning 
native woodland. Autumn is its finest hour. The scented calm of old oakwood 
greets you at once at the Woodland Trust centre, where visitors can browse 
through leaflets giving details of colour-coded walks. This one is called the 
Brig o’Turk Loop and involves a climb on good paths up the lower slopes of 
hills that reach 600m. As the oak thins out, a self-sown birchwood reclaims the 
land from the felled spruces. Scots pine, willow, rowan, alder and hazel 
insinuate themselves into the mix.


The path contours a south-facing hillside with views across lochs, foothills 
and the majestic miles of the Great Trossachs Forest to Ben Venue above Scott’s 
Loch Katrine. Watch out for red squirrel, black grouse, golden eagle and pine 
marten. Drop down to a low path that circles back to the start.

The Byre Inn (mains from £9.95) at Brig o’Turk specialises in locally sourced 
game and fish and micro-brewery ales. The starter of your dreams is 
oatmeal-rolled haggis fritters. Log fires, of course.

Sligachan is a sea loch, a middle-of-nowhere hotel, and the most unforgettable 
glen in all Scotland. Unforgettable, because to walk there is to journey into a 
twilight world of hard rock and Celtic legend, and the sculptural glories of 
Scotland’s mountain masterpiece – the Cuillin. The Sligachan track takes a 
spectacular route between the superb peaks ofMarsco 
<http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/skye/marsco.shtml> on your left and Sgurr nan 
Gillean <http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/skye/sgurrnangillean.shtml> on your 
right.

The best low-level walk is to follow the glen south to Loch na Creitheach, 
tranquil but sensationally situated under the south ridge of the Cuillin’s 
aloof outlier, Blà Bheinn. Then just walk back the way you came. If luck is 
with you, a sprinkling of snow will embellish the peaks and stags will roar in 
the dusk.

Seumas’ Bar <http://www.sligachan.co.uk/seumas-bar/> in the Sligachan Hotel

from the adjacent Cuillin Brewery. Freshly landed seafood is a speciality, as 
is venison pie.JC

Refuel: The Albatros <http://albatroswells.co.uk/>, Wells

Parts of the coast are southern Britain’s last wild frontier, a place of space 
and peace, unchanged by human habitation. It is the illimitable horizon and 
vast open beach that first dazzle the visitor to Wells-next-the-Sea: this 
windswept space is intoxicating. At low tide it’s possible to imagine you’re in 
a desert until the tide creeps up with swift stealth.

An easy two-hour stroll is to take the footpath westwards into the pine woods 
at the far end of the beach car park at Wells. This becomes a sheltered grassy 
track at the edge of the woods where you can bump into muntjac deer or watch 
skeins of pink-footed geese and wading birds drawn to the wet fields in winter. 
At Holkham, you can turn through the pines on to the vast beach and head back 
east to Wells, keeping an eye out for seals, oystercatchers and other shoreline 
birds.

This is a particularly beautiful walk in autumn and winter, when there is more 
chance of encountering coastal wildlife. And even when it is busy, you can 
always find space and solitude on such an expanse of sand. My tip is to check 
the wind direction when you set out and do this walk whichever way round 
ensures that the wind is at your back on the beach.

After a fresh-air buffeting, you may require some refreshment; follow the 
coast path up the channel to the port of Wells, where you’ll find theAlbatros 
<http://albatroswells.co.uk/> moored on the Quay. This is an atmospheric, 
ramshackle-in-the-right-way old boat that Dutchman Ton Brouwer used to sail 
over from Holland. He liked Wells so much that he stayed, and serves real ales 
to wash down kingsize savoury Dutch pancakes (from £5.75) and three-course 
lunches for £17.50.

If you wrap up warm, you can sit on deck, or go below to the cosy, friendly 
innards of the ship, where there’ll be games, good conversation and live music 
at weekends.

Refuel: The Chequered Skipper <http://www.chequeredskipper.co.uk/>, Ashton

In 1975, a small brown butterfly abruptly vanished from England. Fortunately, 
the chequered skipper still thrives in the Scottish Highlands, but its only 
trace south of Scotland is a lovely thatched pub, theChequered Skipper 
<http://www.chequeredskipper.co.uk/>. It’s a beautiful country pub on the green 
of the village ofAshton 
<http://www.ashtonestatecountryholidays.co.uk/ashton-estate/> (confusingly 
there are two Ashtons in Northamptonshire – this one is near Oundle), part of 
an estate founded at the turn of the 20th century by the great butterfly lover 
and conservationistCharles Rothschild 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/may/16/charles-rothschild-nature-reserves>
. It offers fine Northamptonshire ales with an easy-going restaurant serving 
steaks, burgers, and dishes such as slow-roasted belly pork (£13.95) and 
polenta chips with roasted Mediterranean vegetables (£9.75).

The countryside around it contains some beautiful English woodlands, and some 
of the best butterfly territory in the country. There are some lovely lanes 
right on the pub doorstep, but I’d suggest a 10-minute drive toFermyn Woods 
<http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Leisure/countryside/Pages/Fermyn.aspx>
, a fragment of the old forest of Rockingham. Many of its conifers have been 
removed and the revived native wood has become one of the best places in 
Britain for the purple emperor, an elusive, iridescent butterfly that flashes 
purple and inspires obsessive devotion when it emerges in late June. At this 
time of year, it is a brilliantly camouflaged caterpillar but the rides of 
Fermyn remain a lovely walk.

If I’m in the area, I always call in at another nature reserve, Glapthorn Cow 
Pastures <http://www.wildlifebcn.org/reserves/glapthorn-cow-pastures>, which is 
even closer to the Chequered Skipper. This is a hidden gem, a mix of ancient 
woodland, meadows and blackthorn scrub, home to another rare butterfly, the 
black hairstreak. Like the purple emperor, this little butterfly with tiny 
tails on its wings has a cult following.PB

Grade: Easy 
Refuel: The Dyke’s End <http://www.dykesend.co.uk/>, Reach 

The Devil’s Dyke is a chalky, manmade trench-and-ridge earthwork, most likely 
built as an Anglo-Saxon defence. It rises out of woods and fields west of 
Cambridge, but this walk starts close to where it crosses into Suffolk by 
Newmarket race course (purple pasque flowers grow here and the grassy banks are 
good for butterflies).

The route then crosses the A14 on a footbridge back into Cambridgeshire and 
falls towards Reach green and a strikingly different landscape (sheep fields on 
this stretch attract migrating ring ouzels and wheatears in autumn). After 
Reach, the fens begin, with chalk replaced by peat, and the pathway bounces 
beneath your boots in a place that has not forgotten its swampy past.

The walk heads along the dyke’s watery extension, Reach Lode. Another manmade 
feature, this is an old waterway first dug, perhaps, in Roman times. Towards 
the newly rewilded Burwell Fen (where, in autumn and winter, short-eared owls 
quarter the air between barn owls, and visiting hen harriers jink between 
resident marsh harriers) the contours thin and the walk is below sea level. 
Then the skies grow up and Ely cathedral, gunmetal-grey on the western horizon, 
might be a beached whale or a stranded ship.

The Dyke’s End  <http://www.dykesend.co.uk/>pub looks out on to Reach village 
green and is an excellent halfway stop on a there-and-back walk. Good walkers’ 
grub in the stripped-pine interior includes local sausages and mash (£11.50).

A walk over the top of the Quantocks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/08/lets-go-to-the-quantock-hills-somerset>
 in west Somerset from Over Stowey or nearby Adscombe to Crowcombe takes you 
from oak woodland up across a hog’s back of moorland and down again to the 
shelter of trees. The path is obvious so you shouldn’t get lost.

Linger, on your way up, between the silver of the many streams and the 
salad-green tree canopy, and feel yourself in a temperate rainforest. From the 
top, the moor gives great views across the tea-brown non-sea of the Bristol 
Channel. On wind-scoured autumn days, the Welsh hills on the far side seem at 
the tip of your fingers. Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner took shape in his mind as 
he walked these paths and scanned the prospects.


Night walking, which he did with William and Dorothy Wordsworth, can be 
beautiful here, too. Pick a moonshiny night and time your walk to allow for 
rest and recuperation at theCarew Arms <http://www.thecarewarms.co.uk/> in 
Crowcombe before retracing your steps. The bar has a stone-age feel, with an 
open fire and a great flagged floor. Daytime walkers find a welcome, too. It is 
exhilarating to have crossed the whole of a lowland mountain and celebratory 
eating and drinking can follow. The butternut squash lasagne (£9.50) is a hit.TD

Refuel: The Nelson Head <http://thenelsonhead.com/>, Horsey 

With seagoing memorabilia all over its weathered redbrick walls, the Nelson 
Head <http://thenelsonhead.com/> like dozens of other pubs in the county, 
claims a direct link to Norfolk’s most famous sailor son. Unlike most, however, 
the Nelson’s Head is encircled by some of the most beautiful coastal scenery in 
the whole of East Anglia.

To the west lies the National Trust’s Horsey Broad, celebrated for its great 
sailing, its beautiful working windmill and the sounds of booming bitterns in 
spring. To the east – in fact the pub is within earshot of the waves – is the 
North Sea shoreline itself. In between is a great sand ridge that runs all the 
way south to Winterton Dunes, another national nature reserve and an eerily 
beautiful landscape noted for natterjack toads and sunbathing adders.

Recently, this stretch of coast has become known for the many Atlantic grey 
seals that haul themselves ashore from November onwards and give birth to one 
of the cutest sights in all of British nature: the doe-eyed, cream-furred pups.

Tens of thousands of people make the pilgrimage to ooh and aah at them, and 
those in the know stop off at the Nelson for lunch. The range of cask ales is 
huge and the menu, under the direction of a new chef, includes sandwiches (from 
£5.25), Cromer crab salad (£13.95) and fabulous burgers (from £12.95). All the 
meat comes from locally sourced ancient breeds.

As with the pub’s menu, visitors are spoilt for choice in terms of walking 
possibilities from the Nelson, and the wildlife at Horsey never disappoints. 
Marsh harriers are omnipresent. In winter, there are large flocks of 
pink-footed geese calling or wheeling across the vast skies, and Britain’s 
largest population of wild cranes.

One excellent option for a stroll with lunch is to park four miles down the 
coast at Winterton. There are ample opportunities for parking in the village 
centre, including a pay-and-display car park. Then follow the coastal path all 
the way through the Winterton Dunes reserve and along the landward side of the 
dune crest. The dunes and woods on the landward side are great for fungi in 
autumn (including the beautiful if poisonous fly agaric) and sparrowhawks or 
buzzards in all seasons.

After four miles you see the hamlet of Horsey with the Nelson Head. It is the 
first and only settlement north of Winterton. A clear track on the left, 
leading west into Horsey, takes you directly to it. For an alternative way back 
stroll by the sea and take in the fabulous gatherings of grey seals as you 
walk. Note that there are local access restrictions in the spots where the 
seals are in pup, but after these, for three miles of open beach, it is just 
you, the seals and the North Sea.

Refuel: The Beehive Inn <http://thebeehiveinn.co.uk/>

Forty years ago, my routine circumnavigation of the grouse moors on Combs 
Moss, between Buxton and Chapel-en-le-Frith, involved a delightful act of 
childhood trespass. Now I can both exercise my right to roam on the same route, 
and stop off for lunch at theBeehive Inn <http://thebeehiveinn.co.uk/>.

The first leg of the Combs Moss circuit is a great appetite builder. It is 
easy to park at the top of Lightwood Road in Buxton and then follow the gravel 
track to the bridge over a small brook and climb the steep facing slope. Then 
the route heads north-east, following the boundary line and gritstone wall, 
known as Black Edge, that divides the heather moorland from the upland pastures.

There is a sense of vast space, and glorious panoramas over the heart of the 
Peak District. Then, as you drop off the moor to the minor road above Combs 
Edge and make the last steep descent into Combs and the Beehive itself, you can 
see, way to the north, the darker contours of Kinder Scout and Blackden Moor.

Avoid retracing your steps by undertaking a post-lunch slog up Ridge Lane and 
back to Buxton via the old Roman road, completing an eight-mile circuit. You 
are largely walking on an old gravel and even tarmac road, so the route is 
clear and the going good. It gets a little tougher with the years and over time 
I have seen the lapwings and curlews decline, yet the buzzards, peregrines and 
ravens are all increasing. The varied colours of autumn vegetation seen from 
this route are particularly rewarding.

The fact that the Beehive pub is always busy despite being down a virtual 
cul-de-sac in the tiny hamlet of Combs, miles from the main road, speaks 
volumes for the friendliness of the staff and the reputation of its food and 
cask ale. It has a wood-lined interior with superb photos of local Derbyshire 
characters on the walls. There is an excellent range of traditional fare, but 
the generous Sunday roasts (£10.95; the beef was particularly good last time) 
with heaps of fresh vegetables have long been a stock choice of my family.MC

Refuel: The Salty Dog <http://saltydogbangor.com/>, Bangor

From busy marinas to quiet sandy beaches, this trip along the shore of Belfast 
Lough is a celebration of the coastal diversity a stone’s throw from the 
capital. The route follows a paved path just above the shoreline and is largely 
flat. Start by catching one of the regular trains from Bangor to Holywood. From 
the station, make your way to the seafront and turn right (north-east) along 
the promenade. In the first three miles, you pass the Royal North of Ireland 
Yacht Club and the Royal Belfast Golf Club.

An increasing number of sea birds pick over the coastal shelves as you enter 
the woodland ofCrawfordsburn country park 
<http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/Crawfordsburn-Country-Park-Helens-Bay-P2882>
. Follow the path through the trees to Grey Point, where defensive guns were 
kept trained across the water throughout both world wars. It’s not long now 
before you reach the beach at Helen’s Bay. Cross the sand, then pass a small 
headland to the wider expanse of Crawfordsburn beach.

Two more secluded coves bring you to the marina in Bangor. Continue around the 
seafront to theSalty Dog <http://saltydogbangor.com/>, a hotel and bar 
overlooking the eastern side of the harbour. Enjoy the afternoon sun on the 
outdoor terrace while sampling the wide selection of local craft beer. There’s 
a suitably fishy slant to the menu too, with mains such as fish pie with 
soft-boiled egg for £12, or Ardglass turbot with clam chowder for £22.

Refuel: Laragh Lodge <http://www.laraghlodge.co.uk/> 

This five-mile walk passes countless waterfalls, deep rocky gorges and 
extensive views down the Glenariff valley, one of the Glens of Antrim – with 
140 metres of ascent. The circuit starts and finishes beside Laragh Lodge, the 
pub that provides the reward at the end of the day. Avoid temptation at the 
start, however, and instead follow the riverside path around the back of the 
restaurant. Continue ahead along the bank of the Glenariff river, with the path 
soon becoming a wooden walkway across a rock ravine.

At the head of the gorge is the double waterfall of Ess-na-Larach 
<http://www.go4awalk.com/userpics/johndyason5.php>, which means “Mare’s Fall”. 
Cross the river here and follow the red markers upstream. At a third bridge, 
switch to the black waymarkers of the scenic trail, and climb through woodland 
to the upper reaches of the Inver river. Felling works may still be ongoing 
this autumn, but diversion signs mark an alternative route.

The descent traces the bank of the Inver river as far as Ess-na-Crub 
waterfall, then crosses both the Inver and the Glenariff. Now turn right and 
retrace your initial steps back to Laragh Lodge. The pub’s setting continues 
the watery theme. There are views of the rapids from both inside and outside, 
with evening floodlighting making the falls seem even more dramatic. Menu 
options include cracking roast pork for £11, or chicken with whisky, mustard 
and tomato cream for £10.95.HF

Refuel: The Lamb & Lion <http://www.lambandlioninnyork.com/>, High Petergate 

York’s 2.1 mile-long medieval walls are the longest and best preserved in 
England and, what’s more, come with a remarkable concentration of great views 
and points of interest. From the station (side trip to the railway museum, 
anyone?), I’d recommend turning left and following the road under the actual 
wall. You’ll spot where to get up on the ramparts. Now head back anti-clockwise 
around the walls toMicklegate Bar 
<http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/the-york-city-walls/micklegate-bar>, a 
14th-century gatehouse that has hosted the heads of many important noble houses 
– just the heads, you understand, on spikes.

A lovely long stretch of wall ends with crossing Skeldergate Bridge 
<http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/victorian/skeldergate-bridge> (the 
energetic can add a two-mile loop downriver to the Millennium Bridge). Once 
across the river, check out Clifford’s Tower – more gory history available. 
Further along the wall, there’s a very good pub, thePhoenix 
<http://www.york-pm.co.uk/phoenix.html>, but it only does bar snacks. A few 
hundred metres beyond you have to leave the wall, but at Monkgate you can 
reclaim the high vantage point and continue with excellent views of the Minster 
– this section is part of the original Roman fort wall.

The Lamb & Lion is just inside the wall at Bootham Bar. Try its version of 
Clifford’s Tower, a steak-and-ale pie with mashed potato (£14.95), or something 
lighter such as baked halloumi with tomatoes, courgettes and tempura broccoli 
(£10.95). The walk is well signposted, so all the ups and downs are easily 
negotiated. It’s free and open from 8am to dusk. At the finish, check out the
Maltings <http://maltings.co.uk/index.htm> for lunchtime sandwiches and a good 
pint of Black Sheep. There’s a detailed section-by-section guide to the walk at

Refuel: The Wheel Inn, Ticknall

Among all the gems in National Trust ownership, Calke Abbey 
<https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/calke-abbey> ranks very high: a baroque giant 
of a country pile that came to the trust in 1985 in lieu of death duties, and 
in a state of disrepair. Thankfully they kept it that way, although “shabby” in 
this instance means a slightly worn cushion, rather than water pouring through 
the ceiling.

This circular walk starts at the NT car park, but you could begin at the 
halfway point in Ticknall if you prefer to end it with lunch, and there are 
several possible additions. The route takes you through Ticknall limeyards, 
once a bustling medieval industrial site, but now a place where lime-loving 
plants thrive, including wild clematis, the rare hard shield fern, wild 
strawberries and various orchids. After winding through this area, you will 
pass through an old tunnel, following which turn right along the national 
forest trail.

This path becomes a lane that pops out on Ticknall’s Main Street and the Wheel 
Inn <http://www.thewheelticknall.co.uk/> is on your left. There’s an extensive 
menu, from toasted ciabattas (£8.95) to venison sausages (£10.95), plus a 
specials board with at least 10 dishes, around half of which are usually 
seafood. It’s hugely popular with locals so it’s best to book ahead.

Now retrace your steps back on to the forest trail and follow the path all the 
way to the abbey, watching out for some of Calke’s ancient trees, several of 
which are over 800 years old. The house itself is well worth a look: check out 
the book-lined drawing room and the wonderfully Heath Robinson bathroom 
equipment. More walk details atnationaltrust.org.uk.
