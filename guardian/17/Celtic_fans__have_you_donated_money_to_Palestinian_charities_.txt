The Green Brigade group of supporters set up an appeal 
<https://www.gofundme.com/matchfinepalestine> on the gofundme website on Sunday 
to match the anticipated fine. The fans are raising money forMedical Aid 
Palestine <http://www.map-uk.org/>, which delivers health and medical care to 
those “worst affected by conflict, occupation and displacement,” and the Lajee 
Centre, a cultural and sports project for children in Aida refugee camp, in 
Bethlehem.
