European football’s governing body Uefa has filed a criminal complaint against 
the ticketing website Viagogo for illegal ticket sales atEuro 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016>.

Sources in Bordeaux told the Guardian that French police raided the hotel Le 
Provençal last Saturday, where Viagogo staff had booked a room and were handing 
out tickets for the game between Italy and Germany.

Prosecutors are now expected to open a case against Viagogo, a website that 
allows fans to sell each other tickets and takes a commission on the price.

In the hotel room were computers and envelopes full of tickets, according to 
reports onFrench website Sudouest.fr 
<http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/07/07/l-uefa-part-en-guerre-contre-viagogo-2426358-2780.php>
, while hundreds of fans were queuing outside to receive tickets.

The Viagogo staff are understood to have had local lawyers from Bordeaux 
already with them when French officers arrived.

Gregory Lepesqueux, legal counsel at Uefa, told Sudouest.fr that the fact 
Viagogo took a commission on tickets sold between fans meant it was technically 
selling tickets. Euro 2016 tickets can only be bought legally throughUefa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa> itself.

He alleged that Viagogo had not provided buyers with information about where 
they were sitting, potentially leading to safety concerns if fans from rival 
teams were placed next to each other.

“Our entire policy of segregation, for reasons of safety, was put in 
jeopardy,” he said, adding that Uefa was concerned by the inability to trace 
supporters who bought tickets on the website.

Police also asked Viagogo staff to present their contracts of employment, 
which some of them were allegedly unable to do.

A spokesman for the football body said: “Uefa have filed criminal complaints 
against Viagogo with the public prosecutor in several cities in France, and we 
are also undertaking civil proceedings against Viagogo before the Tribunal de 
Grande Instance de Paris [high court of Paris].”

Social media sites such as Twitter featured multiple complaints from irate 
fans, some of whom said they had sold tickets via the company but not received 
any money.

Viagogo did not return the Guardian’s requests for comment. 

The ticketing site was founded in London in 2006 by Eric Baker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/26/eric-baker-viagogo-interview>
, who also set up StubHub before selling it to auction website eBay in 2007 for 
£160m.

Viagogo has attracted financial backing from former tennis stars Andre Agassi 
and Steffi Graf, both of whom sit on its board of directors.

Other backers include the Rothschild family of financiers, the chairman of 
Louis Vuitton Moet Hennesy (LVMH), Bernard Arnault, and venture capital firm 
Index Ventures.

The company liquidated its assets in 2012 and moved to Switzerland before the 
London OIympic Games.

The change of headquarters meant Viagogo was no longer subject to UK laws 
banning resale of tickets for Olympic events.

Viagogo is among firms named by consumer rights group Which? 
<http://www.which.co.uk/news/2016/05/event-tickets-still-being-sold-unlawfully-443074/>
 that may have breached consumer rights regulations by selling tickets for 
music and sports events without publishing their face value or details such as 
seat number and row.

The government is in the midst of a review of secondary ticketing companies – 
firms that offer a platform for the resale of tickets that have already been 
bought.

The Guardian revealed earlier this year that professional touts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/15/shady-world-of-the-ticket-touts> 
are able to make vast sums of money byexploiting weaknesses in ticket websites 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/21/ticket-touts-powerful-software-assist-widely-available>
 to hoover up large amounts of tickets and resell them on secondary website 
such as Viagogo.
