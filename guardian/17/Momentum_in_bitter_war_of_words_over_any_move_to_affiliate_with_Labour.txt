Momentum <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/momentum> would face an uphill 
battle lasting several years to affiliate to the Labour party, according to 
senior party sources, who have cast doubt on whether the group would ever be 
able to affiliate in its current incarnation.

The pro-Jeremy Corbyn grassroots movement, chaired by Labour veteran Jon 
Lansman,agreed a new constitution late on Tuesday night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/10/momentum-shakeup-will-force-members-to-join-labour>
 that requires its members to join Labour, with the aim of ultimately 
affiliating to the party.

The group’s 20,000 members must join the Labour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party by 1 July or leave 
Momentum, according to the constitution, which has sparked a bitter war of 
words between Lansman and other influential members of Momentum.

The rule could force out prominent members such as Jill Mountford, of the 
Alliance for Workers’ Liberty, and former Militant activist Nick Wrack, both 
currently expelled from Labour, and steering committee member Jackie Walker, 
who was suspended from Labour over antisemitism claims that she denies. 
Mountford called the move a “coup” by Lansman.

Lansman claims to have drawn up the proposals “in consultation with a number 
of others in Momentum, the leader’s office and trade unions that have supported 
Jeremy Corbyn”. Its existing governing structures have been dissolved and new 
elections for a ruling body are to be held.

A spokesman for Corbyn refused to be drawn on whether the Labour leader would 
welcome the movement’s affiliation with the party.

“Momentum is an independent body, it’s in a process of evolution and it’s 
discussing internally its own democracy and how that can be most effective,” 
the spokesman said. “From what’s taken place in Momentum, it’s very clear what 
the majority of its members thinks, but that’s a matter for Momentum and its 
members,” he said.

The process for Momentum to affiliate to the party would be long and 
difficult, Labour sources said. Organisations must have three years of accounts 
before they can apply to affiliate, with Momentum in existence for only just 
over a year.

Organisations that support a particular faction of the party, either left or 
right, cannot affiliate and affiliates cannot have a separate political agenda. 
Affiliates tend to be either trade unions or grouped around particular 
communities or issues, including organisations such as Chinese for Labour, the 
Jewish Labour Movement or the Labour Animal Welfare Society.

Long-standing Labour organisations, such as the New Labour pressure group 
Progress and the leftwing Campaign for Labour Party Democracy backed by Tony 
Benn, are not affiliates, because they do not necessarily support all party 
policy, and aim to get candidates from their particular slate elected to key 
positions in the party.

One Labour source said: “Momentum would have to substantially change what they 
do in order to be an affiliate. Anything that emulates structures of the Labour 
party, like constituency groups, won’t be allowed. It’s inherently a faction, 
not an affiliate.”

Affiliates also need to have democratic structures and be approved by the 
national executive committee (NEC) and by Labour party conference.

Another source close to Labour’s NEC said: “Even if they were to affiliate, 
there are so many socialist societies and affiliates, they wouldn’t have much 
influence. I suspect it’s mainly a rouse to purge the AWL [Alliance for 
Workers’ Liberty] and Militant.”

Progress’s director, Richard Angell, said Lansman’s actions on Tuesday showed 
the democratic structures of the party had some way to go. “He has acted like a 
monarch, granting a committee, granting a conference and taking them away 
again,” Angell said.

“He is the sole owner of the company and he can do that, but it is the 
equivalent of an absolute monarchy in Momentum, granting the democracy he will 
allow.”

Labour MPs including Tom Blenkinsop have also said they will oppose any 
attempt for Momentum to affiliate.

Another senior Labour source said they expected Momentum’s membership to drop 
significantly. “You do wonder once you have expelled the Trots and their fellow 
travellers how many people will just walk away,” the source said.

“You will always see a big membership jump around leadership elections, and 
then doesn’t renew. All the people who would have dropped off, but we had a 
second leadership election.”
