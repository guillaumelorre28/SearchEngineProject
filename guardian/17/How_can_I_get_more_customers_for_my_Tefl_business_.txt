Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights.

I am a self-employed Tefl <https://www.theguardian.com/education/tefl> teacher 
in London. I set up my business in 2012 and I’ve been working hard on my 
website and blog. I enjoy what I do but the problem is that I don’t get that 
many inquiries because my website isn’t in the first few pages of Google.

I advertise through Gumtree but it’s £100 a week (for a featured ad). I’ve 
also tried Google adwords but that’s pricey as well. I’m wondering if you have 
any ideas about how I can advertise or get funding to build my business.

Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy’s and readers’ help, send a 
brief email todear.jeremy@theguardian.com <mailto:dear.jeremy@theguardian.com>.
