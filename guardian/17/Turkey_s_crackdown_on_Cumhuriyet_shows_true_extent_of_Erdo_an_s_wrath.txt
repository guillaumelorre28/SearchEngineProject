There’s always a tipping point where democracy dies; and Turkey’s President 
Erdoğan reached it last week, when he dismissed another 10,000 civil servants, 
closed more media outlets and, crucially, arrested the editor and a dozen of 
his finest journalists onCumhuriyet.

Secular, independent Cumhuriyet is one of the jewels in Turkey’s free press 
crown. Is it a mouthpiece for Kurdish terrorism and closet supporter of 
Gülenists plotting against Erdoğan? That’s ludicrous if you know the work of 
Murat Sabuncu, its stalwart editor, or fiercely independent columnists such as 
my friend Kadri Gürsel. These aren’t the plotters of some fevered imagination. 
They are fine journalists doing their job – just like Sabuncu’s predecessor, 
Can Dündar, jailed for three months in a Turkish prison for publishing an 
entirely factual story about secret arms shipments to Syrian rebels.

If you want to know what it’s like on the rough side of Erdoğan’s wrath, then 
Dündar’s book,We Are Arrested, (Biteback, £14.99) shows how the pen can emerge 
mightier than a prison door. But that was in 2013, not 2016, when the wrath 
seems unconfined.
