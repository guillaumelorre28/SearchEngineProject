<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/04/takata-airbag-recall-doubled-cars>
 and tumble dryers that catch fire – all products that have recently led to 
safety alerts and, in some cases, recalls.

The exploding airbags supplied by Japan’s Takata to multiple car manufacturers 
across the globe led to one of the largest product recalls in history. It began 
in 2008 and is still going on, affecting 100m airbag inflaters in more than 40m 
cars.

Recalls, which are rarely on this scale, are an important means of 
safeguarding consumers from dangerous goods. There has therefore been anger and 
surprise atWhirlpool’s decision not to issue a product recall for tumble dryers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/13/government-urged-to-press-for-recall-of-faulty-tumble-dryers-over-fire-risk>
 that have caught fire, and instead to recommend consumers continue using them 
while waiting for them to be “modified”.


Product recalls <https://www.theguardian.com/money/product-recalls> are 
essentially safety alerts issued by a manufacturer, importer or retailer. They 
can be issued on a voluntary or compulsory basis by a market surveillance 
suthority (MSA), which monitors and enforces legal safety standards on consumer 
products. In the UK, the bulk of this work is undertaken by Trading Standards 
departments.

When issued voluntarily, the manufacturer admits the product is potentially 
dangerous and that it may present a hazard to consumers. It will usually issue 
a recall notice to inform customers of the batch number, product code and model 
of the item concerned. In most cases, products will either have to be returned 
to the store or distributor, who will organise for the repair or replacement of 
the item.

If agreement can’t be reached between the MSA and the manufacturer or 
distributor of the offending product, then compulsory measures are taken by 
Trading Standards, which can include a recall or even a withdrawal from sale.

If the product is sold in more than one EU state, the UK authorities must also 
notify Brussels so that the product can be placed onRapex 
<https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumers_safety/safety_products/rapex/alerts/main/?event=main.listNotifications>
, the European rapid alert system for dangerous products. It ensures that 
information about products withdrawn from the market and/or recalled from 
consumers anywhere in Europe is quickly circulated between member states and 
the European Commission, so that appropriate action can be taken everywhere in 
the EU.

Rapex notified member states of 2,072 products that posed a risk to consumers 
in 2015, of which 162 were alerts from the UK.


Consumers and businesses would be better served by a central system that 
enabled them to know what procedure to follow

Asked if Brexit will have an impact on this information sharing, the 
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: “The 
outcome of these negotiations will determine what arrangements apply in 
relation to EU legislation in future once the UK has left the EU.”


Checking a product
While around 400 products are recalled each year, only 10% to 20% are returned 
by customers, with many remaining unaware that certain products in their homes 
are potentially unsafe.

We have mentioned some sites below that list recalled products, but there 
isn’t any central database that lists them all, which makes it hard for 
consumers to check if things they have bought appear on them.

Gavin Reese, a partner at law firm RPC, says: “There are more than 30 websites 
that list product recalls, including theChartered Trading Standards Institute

“It is considered that consumers and businesses alike would be much better 
served if there was a central system that was easy to follow, which enabled 
both consumers and businesses to know what procedure to follow with recalling a 
product and what products have been recalled.”

 Electrical Safety First advises consumers to register their electrical 
appliances atRegisterMyAppliance <http://www.registermyappliance.org.uk> – the 
site lets manufacturers contact consumers in the event of a problem with their 
product.


Food recalls
These are handled by the Food Standards Agency in England and Wales and Foods 
Standards Scotland. In 2015, they investigated 1,514 foods, feed and 
environmental contamination incidents across the UK.


The most common problems were the discovery of salmonella, allergens, chemical 
contamination and residues of medicines given to animals.


Meat and meat products (other than poultry) were the most common food type to 
be recalled, followed by shellfish, fruit and vegetables, cereals and bakery 
products, and milk and milk products.

Legal rights
If you injure yourself using a consumer product or become ill from consuming a 
foodstuff you should contact the seller/manufacturer of the product and notify 
them of the problem.


You can also contact other agencies responsible as MSAs for the relevant area 
– such as Trading Standards, Electrical Safety First or the relevant local 
authority (in respect of alleged food poisoning), which can investigate.

Failure to provide warnings or confirmation of ingredients that give rise to 
injury can give rise to a claim for damages

If you have a problem with an item, Reese says you can either bring a claim 
under the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which applies to items purchased before 1 
October 2015, or under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 if the item was bought 
after that. The claim is on the basis that the goods are not of satisfactory 
quality and/or fit for purpose.

“In addition, it is necessary for the product to carry appropriate warnings 
about the use of the product or, in relation to food, its ingredients,” he 
says. “Failure to provide either warnings or confirmation of the ingredients 
which give rise to injury can give rise to a civil claim for damages.”

If you don’t take a product back or allow it to be repaired following a recall 
and are subsequently injured by the fault that you were notified about, you 
will not be entitled to make a claim in relation to that injury.

“However, if you sustain an injury as a result of a different fault 
unconnected to the notified fault, even if you refuse to return the product in 
relation to the notified fault, you may then be entitled to make a claim,” 
Reese adds.
