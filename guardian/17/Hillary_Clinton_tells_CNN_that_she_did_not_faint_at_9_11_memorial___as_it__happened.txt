Today in Campaign 2016

 * Donald Trump will release “very, very specific” results of a physical 
examination soon, the Republican presidential candidate said this morning, a 
day after the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, wasrevealed to have pneumonia
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated>
. “This last week I took a physical and I’ll be releasing when the numbers come 
in,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News. Trump has so far released only a 
short letter from his personal physician, which the doctor in question 
subsequently said had beenrushed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-doctor-letter-health-harold-bornstein>
. Clinton last year released a longerdoctor’s note 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-health-excellent-doctor-letter-2016-campaign-120861>
, written by the same physician who on Sunday released a statement saying that 
the nominee had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday.

 * Meanwhile, Clinton is resting at home in Chappaqua, New York, after 
canceling a two-day fundraising trip to California on the advice of her doctor. 
While Trump said Clinton’s health was “an issue”, he seemed today morning to 
prefer to attack his rival on different grounds, over hercharacterization 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump>
 at a fundraiser Friday of half of his supporters as belonging in a “basket of 
deplorables” – “the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you 
name it”.

 * Speaking to Anderson Cooper in a telephone interview tonight, Hillary 
Clinton told CNN that she did not faint after she left a 9/11 memorial event 
early on Sunday, and that the American people will soon know more about her 
health status after her diagnosis with pneumonia. “I’m feeling so much better, 
and obviously I should have gotten some rest sooner,” Clinton said. “Like a lot 
of people I thought I could just keep going forward and power through it, and 
obviously that didn’t work out so well.” 
 * Here’s a Donald Trump suggestion from a phone interviewer this morning that 
we don’t want to let go uncontemplated: Trump hassuggested that 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-no-debate-moderator-228016#ixzz4K4JN6JCN>
 – because he sees it as inevitable that the debates will be unfair for him– he 
and Clinton conduct an unmoderated debate:

 * 
The fact is that they’re gaming the system, and I think, maybe, we should have 
no moderator. Let Hillary and I sit there and just debate because I think the 
system is being rigged so it’s gonna be a very unfair debate, and I can see it 
happening right now because everyone’s saying that he was soft on Trump. Well 
now the new person’s gonna try to be really hard on Trump just to show, you 
know, the establishment what he can do. So I think it’s very unfair what 
they’re doing. So I think we should have a debate with no moderators — just 
Hillary and I sitting there talking.”

 * We kind of like the idea. What do you think?

A text from Hillary Clinton:

 I just wanted to thank you and everyone on this team for all the well-wishes 
you’ve sent. And since I’ve been hearing from so many people today, I wanted to 
tell you personally that I’m feeling fine and getting better. Like anyone who’s 
ever been home sick from work, I’m just anxious to get back out there. There’s 
so much at stake in this election, and we only have 57 days left in this 
campaign -- I want to make each one count.

Thank you for being the warmest, toughest, and most dependable team I could 
hope for -- you’ve lifted me up, today and every day.

The NCAA has pulled seven championship events from North Carolina, including 
opening weekend men’s basketball tournament games, for the coming year due to a 
state law that some saycan lead to discrimination against LGBT people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/north-carolina-lgbt-law-hb2-civil-rights-act-violation>
.


In a news release Monday, the NCAA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ncaa> 
said the decision by its board of governors came “because of the cumulative 
actions taken by the state concerning civil rights protections”.

“This decision is consistent with the NCAA’s long-standing core values of 
inclusion, student-athlete well-being and creating a culture of fairness,” said 
Georgia Tech president GP “Bud” Peterson, the chair of the board of governors.

The law – known as HB2 – requires transgender people to use restrooms at 
schools and government buildings corresponding to the sex on their birth 
certificates. It also excludes gender identity and sexual orientation from 
local and statewide anti-discrimination protections.

HB2 was signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory earlier this year.

Republican running mate Mike Pence’s decision not to lump KKK grand wizard 
David Duke in with “deplorables” hasalready drawn criticism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-news-election-live?page=with:block-57d727c6e4b013613fffca13#block-57d727c6e4b013613fffca13>
, but at least one person seems pleased with it: David Duke himself.

“It’s good to see an individual like Pence and others start to reject this 
absolute controlled media,”Duke told Buzzfeed News in an interview this evening 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/david-duke-good-to-see-mike-pence-reject-medias-game?utm_term=.vjQnNn9eYV#.trxxexOq5Z>
. “I received the vast majority of Republican votes for United States senator 
before and for governor before that in my state. The truth is the Republican 
party is big tent. I served in the Republican caucus. I was in the Republican 
caucus in the legislature. I had a perfect Republican voting record. It’s 
ridiculous that they attack me because of my involvement in that non-violent 
klan four decades ago.”


In an interview on CNN earlier today, Pence was asked if Duke, an avowed white 
nationalist, is “deplorable.”

“I’m not in the name-calling business,” Pence responded.

Fresh violence at Trump rally as supporter allegedly punches protester

A Donald Trump campaign rally was marred by violence yet again today as the 
Republican nominee attacked Hillary Clinton forcalling his supporters deplorable

A Trump supporter apparently punched a protester 
<https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/775467362195738624> at a rally held at 
the US Cellular Center in Asheville, North Carolina. The scuffle was the first 
violent incident at a Trump rally in months. Although throughout the primary 
season, Trump campaign events had beenmarked by violence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/donald-trump-campaign-claims-violence-rallies>
 by both Trump supporters and protesters, culminating innear riots in Chicago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-rally-called-off-in-chicago-amid-protests-violence-and-chaos>
 andSan Jose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/donald-trump-protests-san-jose-rally-violence-sanders-clinton>
, California, they had been comparatively peaceful in recent months. Prior to 
being punched, the protester reportedly directed an obscene gesture in Trump’s 
direction.

The incident happened as Trump attempted to attack Clinton for her statement 
that half of his supporters belong in “a basket of deplorables”. Although the 
former secretary of state has since backed down from the comment, she has 
continued to insist her opponent has “built his campaign largely on prejudice 
and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices”.

Trump has tried to paint this as an attack by Clinton on blue-collar 
Americans. “Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these 
working-class Americans,” he said in Asheville on Monday night, in an effort to
reinforce his attacks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-elitist-deplorables-comment>
 on his opponent as an insider member of the Beltway elite. The Republican 
nominee went on to repeat of Clinton: “She talks about people like they are 
objects, not human beings.”

Hillary Clinton tells CNN that she did not faint at 9/11 memorial

Speaking to Anderson Cooper in a telephone interview tonight, Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> told CNN that she did not 
faint after she left a 9/11 memorial event early on Sunday, and that the 
American people will soon know more about her health status after her diagnosis 
with pneumonia.

“I’m feeling so much better, and obviously I should have gotten some rest 
sooner,” Clinton said. “Like a lot of people I thought I could just keep going 
forward and power through it, and obviously that didn’t work out so well.”

Clinton said that she initially kept the diagnosis secret because she didn’t 
think it was “that big a deal” and hoped she could “power through” the 
pneumonia.

“I just didn’t think it was going to be that big a deal,” Clinton said. “It’s 
just the kind of thing that, if it happens to you and you’re a busy, active 
person, you keep moving forward.”

“Oh my goodness, Anderson,” Clinton said, in response to Cooper questioning 
whether her campaign’s decision to initially not disclose the diagnosis fed 
into perceptions that Clinton is secretive.

“I think it’s fair to say we’ve already met the standard of disclosure,” 
Clinton said, before pledging to release more information. “We’ve already met a 
high standard of transparency, and we know the least aboutDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> of any candidate in recent 
American history.”

“It’s really past time for him to be held to the same standard - not just as 
me - but everyone else who has held this job.”

As to when she plans to return to the campaign trail, Clinton seemed eager to 
return to campaigning full time.

“It’ll be in the next couple of days,” Clinton said. “They said I should rest 
for five days, and I obviously didn’t follow that very wise advice - I just 
want to get this over and done with and be back on the trail as soon as 
possible.”

“Who exactly was Hillary talking about when she made these despicable 
comments?” Eric Trump emailed supporters this evening, referring to Hillary 
Clinton’s remarks at a fundraiser on Friday night that half of his father’s 
political supporters are part of a “basket of deplorables” composed of racists, 
homophobes and xenophobes.

Trump’s answer to his own rhetorical question: The coal miners she vows to put 
out of business, the veterans dying while waiting for treatment, the police 
officers concerned about rising crime, the American citizens worried about an 
uncontrolled border, the workers who haven’t seen a raise in years.”

“And what about the former and active duty military members who strongly 
support my father over Hillary?” Eric Trump asked in italics “Are they 
‘deplorable’?”

Donald Trump’s rally in Asheville, North Carolina, was interrupted by the 
prolonged removal of protestors this evening that became violent, with 
protestors flipping Trump the middle finger and supporters of the Republican 
presidential candidate throwing punches and slapping protestors.

Trump, who has taken to telling audience members not to harm protestors after 
criticism of a serious of violent exchanges at rallies last fall, instead 
targeted the protestors, calling them “disgusting.”

Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton 'running a hate-filled' campaign

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, speaking in 
Asheville, North Carolina, promised the assembled supporters (and the odd 
protestor) that “in 56 days we are going to win this state, and we are going to 
win back the White House! Believe me.”

In contrast to what he characterized as his substantive and positive campaign 
for the White House, Trump focused on opponent Hillary Clinton’s “very horrible 
statements” in which she suggestedhalf of Trump’s supporters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables>
 belonged in “a basket of deplorables” which she described as consisting of 
“the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic – you name it.”

“My opponent’s campaign of hate. Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has been running a 
hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions and no new 
ideas.”

Clinton, Trump said, “slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.”

But Trump?

“I call you hardworking American patriots who want a better future for our 
country,” Trump said. “You are Americans, and you’re entitled to leadership 
that honors you, cheats you and totally defends you - and that’s what you’re 
going to get if you vote for Donald Trump. Every American is entitled to be 
treated with dignity and respect in our country.”

Trump then welcomed to the stage a group of supporters who he called 
“not-deplorable people.”

 * Donald Trump will release “very, very specific” results of a physical 
examination soon, the Republican presidential candidate said this morning, a 
day after the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, wasrevealed to have pneumonia
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated>
. “This last week I took a physical and I’ll be releasing when the numbers come 
in,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News. Trump has so far released only a 
short letter from his personal physician, which the doctor in question 
subsequently said had beenrushed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-doctor-letter-health-harold-bornstein>
. Clinton last year released a longerdoctor’s note 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-health-excellent-doctor-letter-2016-campaign-120861>
, written by the same physician who on Sunday released a statement saying that 
the nominee had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday.

 * Meanwhile, Clinton is resting at home in Chappaqua, New York, after 
canceling a two-day fundraising trip to California on the advice of her doctor. 
While Trump said Clinton’s health was “an issue”, he seemed today morning to 
prefer to attack his rival on different grounds, over hercharacterization 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump>
 at a fundraiser Friday of half of his supporters as belonging in a “basket of 
deplorables” – “the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you 
name it”.

 * Speaking to Anderson Cooper in a telephone interview tonight, Hillary 
Clinton told CNN that she did not faint after she left a 9/11 memorial event 
early on Sunday, and that the American people will soon know more about her 
health status after her diagnosis with pneumonia. “I’m feeling so much better, 
and obviously I should have gotten some rest sooner,” Clinton said. “Like a lot 
of people I thought I could just keep going forward and power through it, and 
obviously that didn’t work out so well.” 
 * Here’s a Donald Trump suggestion from a phone interviewer this morning that 
we don’t want to let go uncontemplated: Trump hassuggested that 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-no-debate-moderator-228016#ixzz4K4JN6JCN>
 – because he sees it as inevitable that the debates will be unfair for him– he 
and Clinton conduct an unmoderated debate:

 * 
The fact is that they’re gaming the system, and I think, maybe, we should have 
no moderator. Let Hillary and I sit there and just debate because I think the 
system is being rigged so it’s gonna be a very unfair debate, and I can see it 
happening right now because everyone’s saying that he was soft on Trump. Well 
now the new person’s gonna try to be really hard on Trump just to show, you 
know, the establishment what he can do. So I think it’s very unfair what 
they’re doing. So I think we should have a debate with no moderators — just 
Hillary and I sitting there talking.”

 * We kind of like the idea. What do you think?
 
A text from Hillary Clinton:

 I just wanted to thank you and everyone on this team for all the well-wishes 
you’ve sent. And since I’ve been hearing from so many people today, I wanted to 
tell you personally that I’m feeling fine and getting better. Like anyone who’s 
ever been home sick from work, I’m just anxious to get back out there. There’s 
so much at stake in this election, and we only have 57 days left in this 
campaign -- I want to make each one count.

Thank you for being the warmest, toughest, and most dependable team I could 
hope for -- you’ve lifted me up, today and every day.

The NCAA has pulled seven championship events from North Carolina, including 
opening weekend men’s basketball tournament games, for the coming year due to a 
state law that some saycan lead to discrimination against LGBT people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/north-carolina-lgbt-law-hb2-civil-rights-act-violation>
.


In a news release Monday, the NCAA <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ncaa> 
said the decision by its board of governors came “because of the cumulative 
actions taken by the state concerning civil rights protections”.

“This decision is consistent with the NCAA’s long-standing core values of 
inclusion, student-athlete well-being and creating a culture of fairness,” said 
Georgia Tech president GP “Bud” Peterson, the chair of the board of governors.

The law – known as HB2 – requires transgender people to use restrooms at 
schools and government buildings corresponding to the sex on their birth 
certificates. It also excludes gender identity and sexual orientation from 
local and statewide anti-discrimination protections.

HB2 was signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory earlier this year.

Republican running mate Mike Pence’s decision not to lump KKK grand wizard 
David Duke in with “deplorables” hasalready drawn criticism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-news-election-live?page=with:block-57d727c6e4b013613fffca13#block-57d727c6e4b013613fffca13>
, but at least one person seems pleased with it: David Duke himself.

“It’s good to see an individual like Pence and others start to reject this 
absolute controlled media,”Duke told Buzzfeed News in an interview this evening 
<https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/david-duke-good-to-see-mike-pence-reject-medias-game?utm_term=.vjQnNn9eYV#.trxxexOq5Z>
. “I received the vast majority of Republican votes for United States senator 
before and for governor before that in my state. The truth is the Republican 
party is big tent. I served in the Republican caucus. I was in the Republican 
caucus in the legislature. I had a perfect Republican voting record. It’s 
ridiculous that they attack me because of my involvement in that non-violent 
klan four decades ago.”


In an interview on CNN earlier today, Pence was asked if Duke, an avowed white 
nationalist, is “deplorable.”

“I’m not in the name-calling business,” Pence responded.
 
A Donald Trump campaign rally was marred by violence yet again today as the 
Republican nominee attacked Hillary Clinton forcalling his supporters deplorable

A Trump supporter apparently punched a protester 
<https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/775467362195738624> at a rally held at 
the US Cellular Center in Asheville, North Carolina. The scuffle was the first 
violent incident at a Trump rally in months. Although throughout the primary 
season, Trump campaign events had beenmarked by violence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/donald-trump-campaign-claims-violence-rallies>
 by both Trump supporters and protesters, culminating innear riots in Chicago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-rally-called-off-in-chicago-amid-protests-violence-and-chaos>
 andSan Jose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/donald-trump-protests-san-jose-rally-violence-sanders-clinton>
, California, they had been comparatively peaceful in recent months. Prior to 
being punched, the protester reportedly directed an obscene gesture in Trump’s 
direction.

The incident happened as Trump attempted to attack Clinton for her statement 
that half of his supporters belong in “a basket of deplorables”. Although the 
former secretary of state has since backed down from the comment, she has 
continued to insist her opponent has “built his campaign largely on prejudice 
and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices”.

Trump has tried to paint this as an attack by Clinton on blue-collar 
Americans. “Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these 
working-class Americans,” he said in Asheville on Monday night, in an effort to
reinforce his attacks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-elitist-deplorables-comment>
 on his opponent as an insider member of the Beltway elite. The Republican 
nominee went on to repeat of Clinton: “She talks about people like they are 
objects, not human beings.”

Clinton said that she initially kept the diagnosis secret because she didn’t 
think it was “that big a deal” and hoped she could “power through” the 
pneumonia.

“I just didn’t think it was going to be that big a deal,” Clinton said. “It’s 
just the kind of thing that, if it happens to you and you’re a busy, active 
person, you keep moving forward.”

“Oh my goodness, Anderson,” Clinton said, in response to Cooper questioning 
whether her campaign’s decision to initially not disclose the diagnosis fed 
into perceptions that Clinton is secretive.

“I think it’s fair to say we’ve already met the standard of disclosure,” 
Clinton said, before pledging to release more information. “We’ve already met a 
high standard of transparency, and we know the least aboutDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> of any candidate in recent 
American history.”

“It’s really past time for him to be held to the same standard - not just as 
me - but everyone else who has held this job.”

As to when she plans to return to the campaign trail, Clinton seemed eager to 
return to campaigning full time.

“It’ll be in the next couple of days,” Clinton said. “They said I should rest 
for five days, and I obviously didn’t follow that very wise advice - I just 
want to get this over and done with and be back on the trail as soon as 
possible.”
 
Chess grandmaster - and Croatian citizen - Garry Kasparov has cast his vote:

No, I'm not a Hillary "fan", as my years of writing make very clear. But you 
watch Trump & you don't care if Hillary has bubonic plague!

“Who exactly was Hillary talking about when she made these despicable 
comments?” Eric Trump emailed supporters this evening, referring to Hillary 
Clinton’s remarks at a fundraiser on Friday night that half of his father’s 
political supporters are part of a “basket of deplorables” composed of racists, 
homophobes and xenophobes.

Trump’s answer to his own rhetorical question: The coal miners she vows to put 
out of business, the veterans dying while waiting for treatment, the police 
officers concerned about rising crime, the American citizens worried about an 
uncontrolled border, the workers who haven’t seen a raise in years.”

“And what about the former and active duty military members who strongly 
support my father over Hillary?” Eric Trump asked in italics “Are they

What’s going on with Hillary Clinton’s health? A quick overview

The Guardian looks at how the world learned of her diagnosis, and Donald 
Trump’s somewhat muted response to the news despite months of jeering over her 
“stamina”.
 
Donald Trump’s rally in Asheville, North Carolina, was interrupted by the 
prolonged removal of protestors this evening that became violent, with 
protestors flipping Trump the middle finger and supporters of the Republican 
presidential candidate throwing punches and slapping protestors.

Trump, who has taken to telling audience members not to harm protestors after 
criticism of a serious of violent exchanges at rallies last fall, instead 
targeted the protestors, calling them “disgusting.”
 
Donald Trump, on Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables” comment:

Never in history has a major-party presidential candidate so viciously 
demonized the American voter.
 
Hillary Clinton’s campaign has already jumped on Mike Pence’s refusal to call 
former KKK grand wizard David Duke “deplorable”:

If you won’t say the KKK is deplorable, you have no business running the

Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, speaking in 
Asheville, North Carolina, promised the assembled supporters (and the odd 
protestor) that “in 56 days we are going to win this state, and we are going to 
win back the White House! Believe me.”

In contrast to what he characterized as his substantive and positive campaign 
for the White House, Trump focused on opponent Hillary Clinton’s “very horrible 
statements” in which she suggestedhalf of Trump’s supporters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables>
 belonged in “a basket of deplorables” which she described as consisting of 
“the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic – you name it.”

“My opponent’s campaign of hate. Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> has been running a 
hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions and no new 
ideas.”

Clinton, Trump said, “slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.”

But Trump?

“I call you hardworking American patriots who want a better future for our 
country,” Trump said. “You are Americans, and you’re entitled to leadership 
that honors you, cheats you and totally defends you - and that’s what you’re 
going to get if you vote for Donald Trump. Every American is entitled to be 
treated with dignity and respect in our country.”

Trump then welcomed to the stage a group of supporters who he called 
“not-deplorable people.”
