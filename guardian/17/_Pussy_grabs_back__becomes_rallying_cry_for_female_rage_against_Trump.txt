Donald Trump’s sex boasts: ‘When you are a star they let you do anything’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video>
 In a 2005 hot mic conversation with TV host Billy Bush, Trump said he tried 
to seduce a married woman and that he starts kissing beautiful women when he 
sees them without consent. “It’s like a magnet. You just kiss. I don’t even 
wait,” he said in tapes obtained by the Washington Post.

“When you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ’em by the 
pussy. You can do anything,” Trump said.


In response, some Republicans withdrew their support 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-list-of-republicans-reject-support-endorsement>
 for the presidential nominee.Athletes fought back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-locker-room-banter-athletes-reaction>
 against Trump’s defense that the remarks were common “locker room” banter.
Women powerfully responded 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/women-share-sexual-assault-stories-on-twitter-after-donald-trump-comments>
 by speaking out about their sexual assaults. Hillary Clinton called the 
remarks “horrific”. “We cannot allow this man to become president,” shetweeted

.

“Pussy Grabs Back” became a popular hashtag on Twitter. Actor America Ferrera 
used it <https://twitter.com/AmericaFerrera/status/784946679975858176> to share 
an all blue map by FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver, showing what the electoral 
college would look like if women refused to vote for Trump.

Some shared images of the Trump campaign’s famous red hats

the phrase “Grab em by the pussy” in white embroidery. The “Don’t Tread On Me” 
flag from the American Revolutionary War and the Obama “Hope” image were also 
adapted for the cause.

Jessica Bennett, author of Feminist Fight Club 
<http://www.feministfightclub.com/the-book>, turned the phrase into a widely 
shared image with a cat in mid-snarl, crediting Amanda Duarte with the 
sentiment. Bennett, Duarte and Stella Marrs, who created theoriginal image of 
the cat 
<http://www.stellamarrs.com/catalog/detail.php?product_id=103&type=category&cat=3&offset=8>
, and Female Collective, a feminist brand and online community, have turned the 
image into a T-shirt. Proceeds from sales will also be donated to the Rape, 
Abuse & Incest National Network (Rainn).

“Here’s to smashing patriarchy, respecting women’s bodies, pussy power, and 
the end of the road for Donald Trump.... and the party he rode in on,” the
description of the T-shirt 
<http://www.femalecollective.org/product/pussy-grabs-back> reads.

The musician Kim Boekbinder created a song called Pussy Grabs Back 
<https://kimboekbinder.bandcamp.com/track/pussy-grabs-back>, available for free 
or pay-what-you-want download, with some proceeds going to Rainn. “We’re not 
daughters, not wives / We’re humans, with lives / On November 8th, we’re gonna 
rock it,” the song goes. It samples the the tape of Trump and Bush talking.

Discussing her creation on Twitter, Boekbinder described the song as “pure 
rage”. Shewrote that 
<https://twitter.com/KimBoekbinder/status/785475439972212736> she had created 
the song over 27 hours and the weekend had been triggering for her as a 
survivor of sexual assault.
