A man who spray-painted a horse’s face has been given a three-month suspended 
jail term for a string of vandalism offences.


Ricky Lee Tomlinson, of Chesterfield, was found guilty of nine counts of 
criminal damage at Chesterfield justice centre last month, Derbyshire police 
said.

He had denied spray-painting the head of a horse and the blanket of another 
horse, as well as signs, doors and other property in October 2014.

Magistrates, sitting on 19 December, suspended Tomlinson’s jail term for 12 
months and ordered him to pay £1,085 in compensation.

An RSPCA spokeswoman said: “This sounds like a very cruel and unusual incident 
and must have been very distressing for this poor horse, but sadly the RSPCA 
see mistreated animals like this every day.

“If anyone is concerned about the wellbeing of any animal they can ring the 
RSPCA 24-hour cruelty line on 0300 123 4999.”
