Afternoon summary

 * Downing Street has hit back at the Institute for Fiscal Studies after it 
said workers face the longest period without a real-terms increase in wages 
since the second world war. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/ifs-warnsf-biggest-squeeze-on-pay-for-70-years-autumn-statement>
Number 10 said these figures were misleading because disposable income figures 
show that people are getting better off. (See 4.28pm.)

In a separate report the Resolution Foundation said that family incomes would 
grow for the rest of the decade - but by less than after the financial crisis 
and not for the poorest third, who will see their incomes fall. It said: 
We can look at the outlook for family incomes in the coming years, and it 
paints a grim picture. Our new income forecast brings together lower earnings 
growth, higher inflation, and tax/benefit changes. It shows that overall, the 
rest of this parliament looks set to be as grim as the last, with incomes 
growing by an average of 0.2 per cent a year, compared with 0.5 per cent a year 
between 2010-11 and 2014-15. While top earners were hit the hardest following 
the financial crisis, the big difference looking forward is that the biggest 
losers are lower income families, with the entire bottom third of the income 
distribution set to see incomes fall in the years ahead.

 * Brexit could be halted if the British people decided the costs of leaving 
the EU greatly outweighed any benefits, Tony Blair has said in an interview 
marking his self-proclaimed return to political activity. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/24/tony-blair-brexit-could-be-stopped-if-britons-change-their-minds>
 * George Osborne, the former chancellor, made more than £320,400 in a month 
from giving speeches to US banks, financial organisations and a university, his 
register of interests shows. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/24/george-osborne-made-more-than-300000-in-a-month-from-speeches>
 * Andrew Lansley, the former Conservative health secretary, has urged the 
government to invest more in social care. Speaking on the World at One, he said 
he was “disappointed” that Philip Hammond did not address this in his autumn 
statement. Lansley said: 
The next two years are going to be incredibly difficult. And I think the time 
is now for trying to put some measures in place to try and help health and 
social care through those next two years.

 * Jeremy Corbyn has called for more money to be spent on hospitals, social 
care and mental health.Speaking ahead of Labour’s NHS campaign day on Saturday, 
he said the campaign had three elements. 
There’s three elements. One - hospital provision, under-funding of hospitals, 
waiting times and STP - sustainability and transformation plans, which are 
putting at risk a lot of A&E departments all around the country.

The second element is social care, under-funding of social care, the need to 
improve social care and improve the way in which we treat care workers. They’re 
vital, valuable, very responsible and very well experienced people. They should 
be treated better and paid better.

Third, there is a mental health crisis across the country. I feel very 
passionately about this, that’s why I have appointed a shadow minister at 
cabinet level just for dealing with mental health because I think as a country 
we have to face up to the crisis we’re in, fund it properly, but above all 
change the mood music as well. The biggest killer of under-50-year-old men is 
suicide from mental health conditions - that’s terrible.

 * Nigel Farage has reportedly dismissed reports that he plans to emigrate to 
the US as “utter nonsense”.

No 10 hits back at IFS and says disposable income figures show people are 
getting better off

Number 10 has hit back at the IFS. It says that if you look at disposable 
income, not wages, then people are getting better off.

These are from Huffington Post’s Paul Waugh.

No10 hits back at IFS, says real household disposable incomes will rise by 
2.8% by 2021.

 relate to earnings. Number 10 is talking about disposable income, a different 
measure that includes earnings, benefits and pensions, and looks at what’s left 
after tax and national insurance have been paid.

Open Britain, the group campaigning to keep Britain in the single market, has 
put out a statement from Labour’s Chris Leslie saying the IFS analysis shows 
that the economic warnings about Brexit issued during the EU referendum 
campaign were accurate. He said:

This is clear proof that the Brexit vote has made working families worse off. 
The irresponsibility of leave campaigners was breathtaking – they should now be 
admitting that economic warnings made during the campaign were not Project 
Fear; they were Project Fact.

Their promises that Brexit would make Britain better off now appear naive and 
complacent.

Duncan Smith rejects IFS's claim that workers face wage stagnation

Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, told 
BBC News this afternoon that he did not acceptthe IFS claim that workers face 
the longest squeeze on wages for 70 years. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/ifs-warnsf-biggest-squeeze-on-pay-for-70-years-autumn-statement>
 Asked about its analysis, he said:

Well, actually, I’m surprised because wages are increasing, they’re increasing 
now, they’re increasing across the board and well above inflation. Yes, there 
was a period when they were absolutely static. But over the last two, two and a 
half years, wages hae been increasing and the forecasts all the way have been 
that wages will continue to increase. So I don’t recognise this dire prediction 
of no increase at all since the crash.

He also said that he did not accept the forecasts from bodies like the IFS and 
the Office for Budget Responsibility about the impact of Brexit on the economy.

My sense about this is that the UK economy is already confounding the 
forecasts. All the forecasts, from the IFS and from the OBR and everybody else, 
all said that we were going to see a downturn immediately after the Brexit 
vote. We haven’t seen that. The is growing faster than they predicted. We just 
saw the debt fall three days ago, when they predicted it would rise. So my 
sense about this is we are into territory where nobody really knows that the 
future holds.

Duncan Smith is right about wages growing now, but he ignores the fact that 
they fell so far, in real terms, that they have not caught up with where they 
were before the crash. The Resolution Foundation makes the point today in this 
chart, inits autumn statement analysis (pdf)

Here is John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, on the IFS analysis.

This lost decade for living standards is unprecedented in modern British 
history and is a damning indictment of the total, abject failure of the Tories’ 
economic policy during their six wasted years in office. The so-called 
‘long-term economic plan’ has meant long-term decline in living standards for 
working people even as the super-rich and the big corporations are given large 
tax giveaways.

Chancellor Philip Hammond <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond>
 promised action in the autumn statement for those ‘just about managing’. 
Instead he has betrayed them by continuing to slash in-work benefits, failing 
to raise the ‘national living wage’ to the level promised, failing to deliver 
more funding for our NHS and social care and now he’s threatening pensioners 
with removing the ‘triple lock’.

Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> has different priorities 
and will prepare our economy for Brexit. Instead of cutting taxes for the 
super-rich and giant corporations, we will make sure our NHS is properly 
funded, support the pensions ‘triple lock’, and introduce a real living wage 
built on an economy that invests for the long-term so that no-one and no 
community is left behind.

The IFS has now put up on its websites its distributional analysis slides 
(pdf). 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/ifs-warnsf-biggest-squeeze-on-pay-for-70-years-autumn-statement>

This one shows the impact of all tax and benefit reforms since the 2015 
election. They are highly regressive. The gains in the autumn statement (the 
light green bars) were very modest, and came nowhere near compensating for the 
impact of the benefit cuts announced byGeorge Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> last year.

And this shows the impact of the post-election tax and benefit changes on 
family groups. Pensioners have done best, especially wealthy pensioners. 
Working-age families without children were in the middle, and working-age 
families with children have done worst.

And here are two more important charts from one of the IFS slideshow 
presentations (pdf). 
<https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/budgets/as2016/as2016_ah.pdf>

This one shows the impact the government’s benefit freeze was going to have on 
families with inflation forecast to grow at the rate expected in March.

And this chart, or rather the dark green bars in this chart, show how the 
impact as got worse in the light of the new inflation forecasts.

And here is the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg commenting on these figures.

Here is a chart from one of the IFS slideshow presentations (pdf) 
<https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/budgets/as2016/as2016_ce.pdf> 
showing debt as proportion of national income going back to 1700. It has been 
much higher before, but the two previous peaks were caused by the Napoleonic 
wars and the second world war.

Don't worry, says the IFS, public debt *has* been higher than this in the 
past. During World War Two. Oh and during the Napoleonic wars.

IFS's autumn statement analysis - Summary

Here are the key points from Paul Johnson’s opening statement (pdf 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/24/ministers-defend-obr-after-pro-brexit-tories-accuse-it-of-scaremongering-politics-live?page=with:block-5836e982e4b0da4920d6bb49#block-5836e982e4b0da4920d6bb49>
) at the IFS autumn statement briefing.

 * Johnson said by 2021 wages would still be lower than they were in 2008 in 
real terms and that Britain has not had such a “dreadful” period without 
earnings growth since the second world war. (See 1.14pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/24/ministers-defend-obr-after-pro-brexit-tories-accuse-it-of-scaremongering-politics-live?page=with:block-5836e6ade4b0cc60d34769b8#block-5836e6ade4b0cc60d34769b8>
 * He said the expected rise in inflation meant the real value of the 
“national living wage” would rise by just over 20% during the course of this 
parliament, not 25% as expected. 
 * He said inflation also meant that “the real value of working age benefits 
like JSA [jobseeker’s allowance] that are currently frozen in cash terms will 
fall by 7.7% rather than 6.5%”. 
 * He said Philip Hammond had effectively adopted Ed Balls’ spending plans. 
Rather than aiming for Budget balance in 2019-20 Mr Hammond will be happy 
borrowing 2% of national income, that’s about £40 billion, in 2020-21. Remember 
that at the last election the then Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, said he was 
aiming to balance the current budget by 2018-19, i.e. borrow just to invest. 
Keeping to that over the parliament would have allowed borrowing of just over 
2% of GDP in 2020-21. To misquote Michael Heseltine, it wouldn’t be far from 
the truth to say that the new fiscal plans aren’t Osborne’s, they are Balls’.

 * He predicted that the government would have to spend more money on health 
or social care. 
Strikingly [Hammond] responded not at all to calls for more money for either 
the NHS or social care. I’m going to stick my neck out and suggest he won’t be 
able to do that for much longer.

 * He criticised the government for continuing to freeze fuel duty every year 
instead of simply abandoning the proposed annual increases. 
One of the more expensive measures announced was yet another freeze to fuel 
duty – the seventh year in a row this has happened. If the policy is never to 
increase fuel duty again, as seems to be the case, we should just be told 
rather than being told always that it will rise with inflation next year and 
then that never happening. This is turning into a really big problem both for 
the Treasury and for our approach to the taxation of motoring.

 * He said the OBR’s forecasts were “noticeably more upbeat” than the Bank of 
England’s. 
Earlier this month the Bank projected growth of 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6% in 2017, 
2018 and 2019 respectively. The OBR’s projections are for growth of 1.4, 1.7 
and 2.1%. That’s quite a big difference.

 * He said Hammond’s policy in the autumn statement amounted to “jam tomorrow” 
not “jam today”. 
In the face of deteriorating forecasts Mr Hammond neither tightened fiscal 
policy nor followed his predecessor’s example of sticking with previous 
spending plans. He loosened by an annual £10 billion or so. And he loosened in 
a rather specific way, mostly by increasing planned capital spending. Given the 
choice between jam today in the form of more money in people’s pockets and jam 
tomorrow in the form of potential economic returns from greater investment, he 
went for jam tomorrow.

 * He accused Hammond of being disingenuous about the increase in the 
insurance premium tax, arguing that the 12% rate was hard to justify. 
Mr Hammond wasn’t guilty of too many fiscal infelicities yesterday, but the 
way in which he announced the increase in IPT was certainly one of them. It is 
half the rate of VAT, he said, as if in explanation of the rise. Well, so it 
should be - in fact it should be lower. It’s only the value of the insurance – 
premiums net of pay outs – which one should think of as being VATable. That 
would imply an IPT rate much less than 10%, not more.

 * He said the IFS backed the idea of scrapping the autumn statement, although 
he expressed scepticism about whether this would happen. 
We will also wait and see whether this really is the last Autumn Statement. We 
have been here before after all. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke also moved from a 
separate Autumn Statement and Spring Budget to a single Autumn Budget. That 
didn’t survive a change of occupancy at number 11.

Workers in Britain face the biggest squeeze on their pay for 70 years as a 
Brexit blow to the economy knocks wage growth and stokes inflation, according 
to an analysis of the UK’s government’s latest tax and spending plans.

Picking over Philip Hammond’s autumn statement, the Institute for Fiscal 
Studies <https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies> 
said real wages in the UK – pay adjusted for inflation – will still be below 
their 2008 level in 2021.

Paul Johnson, the thinktank’s director said in his presentation (pdf): 
<https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/budgets/as2016/as2016_pj.pdf> “One cannot 
stress how dreadful that is – more than a decade without real earnings growth. 
We have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 years.”

The warning follows signs that the pound’s sharp fall since the referendum 
result is hiking the cost of imports to the UK and could soon be passed on to 
consumers. At the same time, experts warn pay growth could stall as companies 
grapple with politicial and economic uncertainty.


On Wednesday, the government’s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget 
Responsibility, saidthe economy would slow next year and inflation would rise

.

In a separate analysis of the autumn statement 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/nov/24/uk-living-standards-squeeze-will-be-worse-than-after-global-crash>
, the thinktank, Resolution Foundation, said families faced a worse squeeze on 
their living standards over the next five years than they suffered in the wake 
of the financial crisis.

IFS says workers face 'dreadful' decade without real-terms increase in wages

Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies>, has just 
started the IFS’s briefing on the autumn statement.

He says wages in real terms will still be below their 2008 levels in 2021. 
This is “dreadful”, he says.

Here is the key quote.

However, the outlook for living standards has deteriorated rather sharply 
since March. The OBR is forecasting both lower nominal wage growth as a result 
of lower productivity, and higher inflation resulting from the exchange rate 
depreciation. Overall real average earnings are forecast to rise by less than 
5% between now and 2021. That means they will be 3.7% lower in 2021 than was 
projected in March. To put it another way around half of the wage growth 
projected for the next five years back in March is not now projected to happen. 
On these projections real wages will, remarkably, still be below their 2008 
levels in 2021. One cannot stress enough how dreadful that is – more than a 
decade without real earnings growth. We have certainly not seen a period 
remotely like it in the last 70 years.

I will post a full summary of his statement shortly.

Only a third of voters think autumn statement measures will help economy, poll 
suggests

Only a third of voters think the measures announced in the autumn statement 
will help the economy, an ICM poll conducted for the Guardian suggests.

ICM carried out its survey online last night and, although respondents were 
generally positive about the measures in the autumn statement they were asked 
about, overall they did not seem very convinced that Philip Hammond’s policies 
would do a lot to help the economy.

Asked if the package of measures announced by Hammond would be helpful or 
unhelpful to the economy, the results were:

Helpful: 33%

Unhelpful: 8%

No difference: 35%

Don’t know: 24%

ICM also asked about six specific policies in the autumn. All received either 
majority or plurality support, but there were some interesting variations.

The measure with the highest net support was increasing the “national living 
wage” by 30p an hour to £7.50. But the measure with the highest number of 
people both supporting it, and saying it would make a difference, was 
increasing the income tax threshold to £11,500 in April (a measure announced by
George Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> in March, 
but reconfirmed by Hammond yesterday).

And the measure with the lowest net support was abandoning the 2019-20 budget 
surplus targets.

Here are the net support figures for the six policies (percentage saying they 
are in favour, whether or not they think it will make a difference).

Raising the “national living wage” - 82%

Raising the income tax threshold - 79%

Funding 40,000 new affordable homes - 73%

Investing an extra £1.1bn in transport - 68%

Not seeking any more welfare cuts - 53%

Abandoning the 2019-20 budget surplus target - 49%

And here are the same policies, but this time listed in order of people saying 
they support themand think the policy is sufficient to make a difference.

Raising the income tax threshold - 42% (against 38% in favour, but thinking it 
won’t be enough to make a difference)

Raising the “national living wage” - 34% (against 48% in favour/no difference)

Investing £1.1bn in transport - 32% (against 36% in favour/no difference)

Funding 40,000 new homes - 28% (against 45% in favour/no difference)

Not seeking welfare cuts - 24% (against 30% in favour/no difference)

Abandoning budget surplus target - 20% (against 29% in favour/no difference)

Osborne makes £320,000 from speeches in America, Commons register shows

George Osborne made £320,000 in a few weeks from delivering speeches in 
America, the Press Association reports.

The former chancellor, sacked from the government by Theresa May when she 
became prime minister in July, has been paid more than £80,000 a go for some of 
his recent speaking engagements.

The figures, revealed in the latest register of MPs’ financial interests, show 
Osborne expects to receive payments of £81,174 and £60,578 from JP Morgan for 
two speeches delivered at the start of October - a total of seven hours work.

Osborne signed up to the Washington Speakers’ Bureau after he left Government 
and he is due to be paid £80,240 from Palmex Derivatives for a speech in New 
York he gave on October 27 - which he recorded as a total of two hours work.

Osborne also expects to be paid £69,992 by the Securities Industry and 
Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) in return for a speech on September 27 
and October 18.

Meanwhile, the former chancellor is due to be paid £28,454 for a speech on 
October 17 from the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

The latest register of interests also show Michael Bloomberg paid for Osborne 
and his wife to attend a dinner for the former mayor of New York City in Paris.

The value of the travel, accommodation and dinner in the middle of October was 
estimated at £4,086.

Osborne has previously disclosed two helicopter trips in the register of 
interests: one in November 2015 to the Forest of Dean Conservative dinner and 
another to Ripon North Conservatives’ Summer Reception in July this year.

Tony Blair says Brexit can be stopped

Tony Blair has given a lengthy interview to the New Statesman 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/11/tony-blair-s-unfinished-business>
. Here are some of the top lines.

 * Blair says that he wants to help resurrect centre-ground politics. As the 
Guardian reported on Monday,he is setting up a new political organisation next 
year. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/21/tony-blair-hoping-to-revitalise-centre-ground-with-political-comeback>
 In his interview he rules out a return to the political frontline himself, but 
he explains that he wants to help politicians who are challenging extremists. 
What I’m doing is to spend more time not in the front line of politics, 
because I have no intention of going back to the front line of politics, to 
correct another misunderstanding ... but in trying to create the space for a 
political debate about where modern Western democracies go and where the 
progressive forces particularly find their place ... I’m dismayed by the state 
of Western politics, but also incredibly motivated by it. I think in Britain 
today, you’ve got millions of effectively politically homeless people ...

What I’m interested in doing is asking: what are the types of ideas that we 
should be taking forward? How do we provide a service to people who are in the 
front line of politics, so that we can provide some thinking and some ideas? 
The thing that’s really tragic about politics today is that the best ideas 
about politics aren’t in politics. I find the ideas are much more interesting 
in the technology sector, much more interesting ideas about how you change the 
world.

 * He says that Brexit could be reversed. 
It can be stopped if the British people decide that, having seen what it 
means, the pain-gain/cost-benefit analysis doesn’t stack up. And that can 
happen in one of two ways. I’m not saying it will [be stopped], by the way, but 
it could. I’m just saying: until you see what it means, how do you know?

Explaining the two ways in which Brexit could be reversed, he goes on:

Either you get maximum access to the single market - in which case you’ll end 
up accepting a significant number of the rules on immigration, on payment into 
the budget, on the European court’s jurisdiction. People may then say, ‘Well, 
hang on, why are we leaving then?’ Or alternatively, you’ll be out of the 
single market and the economic pain may be very great, because beyond doubt if 
you do that you’ll have years, maybe a decade, of economic restructuring.

The Resolution Foundation thinktank has published its full verdict on the 
autumn statement. As my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot report, it 
is saying that the squeeze on living standards over the next five years could 
be even worse than it was during the financial crash.

Here is there story.

UK living standards squeeze 'will be worse than after global crash'
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/24/uk-living-standards-squeeze-will-be-worse-than-after-global-crash>
This is how it starts.

Families face a worse squeeze on their living standards over the next five 
years than they suffered in the wake of the financial crisis, as Brexit slows 
the economy and Conservative welfare cuts bite, according to a new report.

Analysis of Wednesday’s autumn statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/brexit-will-blow-59bn-hole-in-public-finances-admits-hammond>
 by the Resolution Foundation thinktank suggests average earnings are set to 
grow only half as rapidly as in the austerity years after the economic crisis. 
At the same time, living standards will be undermined by higher inflation and 
ongoing welfare cuts.

While the squeeze of the last parliament affected workers across the income 
spectrum, the foundation says low-paid households are set to be hardest hit 
over the next five years, because they are particularly affected by planned 
welfare cuts.

And here is the full Resolution Foundation report (pdf).

McDonnell says Labour committed to keeping the triple lock for pensioners

John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has also been giving interviews this 
morning. Here are the key points he has been making.

 * McDonnell indicated that Labour wanted taxes to be fairer, but that it was 
not looking to increase the overall tax burden. 
We’d make sure that instead of giving tax giveaways to the wealthy and 
corporations, and ignoring the issue of tax avoidance and tax evasion, we’d 
make sure we had a fair taxation system. And in that way we’re not talking 
about increasing taxes or anything like that, what we are saying is that we use 
our resources more effectively.

We will want to abide by the principles that you spend what you earn. 

They have given tax giveways on capital gains tax, on corporation tax, on 
inheritance tax to the wealthy in our community and also to corporations. And 
what we saw yesterday - they were cutting the universal credits that are going 
to be given to what they call Jams, the just about managing, people going into 
work, looking after their families, doing everything asked of them. So they’ve 
got the wrong priorities.

 * He defended Labour’s decision to support a tax cut for people paying the 
higher rate of income tax.Labour is backing the government’s plan to increase 
the tax threshold for people paying the higher 40p rate of income tax. Asked 
about this, he said: 
There are large numbers of people earning above £43,000 who are in jobs like 
train drivers, like senior teachers and others who have been hit and do need 
protecting.

If we are going to be doing redistribution we should be hitting those who are 
over [that level]. For example, our policy is 50p on £150,000, reverting to the 
original tax system we had some years ago.

We have to recognise that the reality of those people on middle incomes and 
the pressures that they are under, particularly with regard to housing costs in 
certain parts of our country.

 * He said Labour was committed to keeping the triple lock - the law that says 
pensions will rise every year by 2.5% or in line with earnings or inflation, 
whichever is higher. The Tories are committed to keeping this until 2020 but 
Philip Hammond, in his autumn statement, hinted that it could be dropped after 
that because it is too expensive. 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/state-pension-changes-cuts-autumn-statement-triple-lock-2016-latest-2020-a7434206.html>
 Asked if Hammond was right to review it, McDonnell replied: 
No, I would be very disappointed if he did [drop the triple lock]. Under the 
Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> government Gordon Brown 
wanted to tackle the issues around child poverty and pensioner poverty and that 
is what he did. He lifted people out of poverty at both stages of their lives, 
both children and older people ... If we can grow the economy, and we have a 
fair taxation system, we can afford it.

(McDonnell was right to say the last Labour government did a lot to reduce 
pensioner poverty, but the triple lock was actually a coalition policy, not a 
Labour one.)

 * He said the government’s failure to set out its Brexit stance was 
increasing economic uncertaintly. 
We can’t do these negotiations without openness and transparency. People need 
to know where is the government going and how is it going to get there. At 
least then you stabilise things and people will be able to settle down into 
serious negotiations and we will get the best deal. Until the government gets 
to that position, we are going to have these uncertainties and this speculation.

 * He played down the significance of a picture showing many Labour MPs 
looking at their phones in the Commons chamber when he was responding to 
Hammond yesterday. He said: 
It doesn’t look brilliant but that’s what they do now and they have to think 
themselves. The new style in parliament at the moment is people are tweeting 
all the time. They’re doing a running commentary on what’s going on. It doesn’t 
look good, but that’s what happens.

It’s interesting because everybody’s got these new handheld devices all the 
time, they’re tweeting all the time, but interestingly enough the general 
response to the points I was making was received quite well within parliament 
and outside.

And it’s interesting – I’ve never seen this before and this is not me boasting 
– if you looked at the MPs opposite me and those behind, I held their 
attention. Even though they’re tweeting, they’re tweeting about what I’m saying.

Philip Hammond's morning interviews - Summary

Here is a full summary of the main points from Philip Hammond’s interviews 
this morning.

 * Hammond said the economic future was uncertain because no one knew what the 
outcome of the Brexit talks would be.When it was put to him that the government 
was at fault for telling the Office for Budget Responsibility very little about 
its Brexit plans, he said that the government had said what it wanted: the 
greatest possible access to European markets. But the outcome of the Brexit 
negotiations would not just depend on what the government wanted, he went on. 
The fact is, it is not about what we want the outcome to be. It’s going to be 
a negotiation. We are going to sit at the table with the representatives of the 
European Union. And nobody, at this stage, can be certain about what the 
outcome of that negotiation will be. That is what creates the uncertainty, 
whether you are a chancellor of the exchequer trying to forecast the public 
finances for a couple of years down the line or whether you are a businessman 
making an investment in a production line.

He said the government was preparing for “a range of possible outcomes” from 
the Brexit talks. “That’s a sensible and prudent thing to do,” he said.

 * He defended the OBR, saying the government would be wrong to ignore its 
forecasts. Pro-Brexit Tories have criticised the OBR, saying its forecasts 
about the impact of Brexit on the economy are wrong. Hammond said it was 
important to remember that forecasting was not a precise science. But he said 
the government would be wrong to ignore what it said. 
Economic forecasting is not a precise science. And the OBR itself makes the 
point in its report that there is a very high degree of uncertainty around the 
report that they issued yesterday because of the circumstances that they are in.

When it was put to him that this means he thinks the OBR forecasts should be 
taken with “a pinch of salt”, as the Telegraph claims this morning, he replied:

I think we should look at what the report is projecting, we should certainly 
not ignore that, we should look at it as one of the possible range of outcomes 
that we need to plan for.

The BBC’s Ross Hawkins has posted this on Twitter, pointing out that Hammond 
was right to say the OBR has acknowledged a high degree of uncertainty.

 <https://twitter.com/rosschawkins/status/801701090668515328> 
 * He said the government was preparing for a possible economic slowdown next 
year. 
To me it makes sense, given the warning signals from the OBR report, to keep a 
little bit of firepower in the locker, to build a little bit of a reserve so 
that if there is a slowdown next year, we’ve got enough capacity to support the 
economy, to protect jobs, to ensure that the economy can get through any 
headwinds it encounters.

 * He rejected claims that debt was out of control. When it was put to him 
that the government had lost control of debt he replied: 
It’s not out of control, it’s larger than we would like it to be.

 * He rejected claims that the autumn statement contained nothing for “Jams”, 
the families who are “just about managing”. When this was put to him, he 
replied: 
I don’t think that’s true at all. We are facing very significant fiscal 
challenges. Within the constraints that that imposes, we’ve tried to focus what 
firepower we do have on helping those who are ordinary working families who are 
hard-pressed to get by.

Stopping the scheduled rise in fuel duty was an important step in that 
process. Reducing the taper in universal credit so that people in work on low 
wages are able to keep more of their wages. Recommitting to raising the 
personal allowance in the income tax system to 12,500 by the end of this 
parliament despite the fiscal challenges will leave everybody in this country 
better off.

And of course a rise in the “national living wage” which will put 500 a year 
in the pockets of somebody over 25 working full-time on the “national living 
wage”. I think those are important steps forward.

 * He rejected claims that the government was now adopting the spending plans 
Labour proposed at the 2015 general election.Labour would have exempted 
investment spending from borrowing rules, he said. He said his new fiscal rules 
included investment spending. 
 * He rejected claims that he ignored the NHS in his statement. When this was 
put to him, he replied: 
It is not true that it was not mentioned. If you read the statement, it 
absolutely was mentioned. As I said yesterday in parliament, it may have been 
my first autumn statement, but I’m not a complete rookie and I would not have 
failed to mention the NHS.

 * He rejected the ideal of Nigel Farage playing any role in the government’s 
relations with Washington. Asked about this, he replied: 
If I ever need any advice from Nigel Farage I’ve got his number and I’ll give 
him a call. Tell him not to hold his breath.

 * Downing Street has hit back at the Institute for Fiscal Studies after it 
said workers face the longest period without a real-terms increase in wages 
since the second world war.

Number 10 said these figures were misleading because disposable income figures 
show that people are getting better off. (See 4.28pm.)

In a separate report the Resolution Foundation said that family incomes would 
grow for the rest of the decade - but by less than after the financial crisis 
and not for the poorest third, who will see their incomes fall. It said: 
We can look at the outlook for family incomes in the coming years, and it 
paints a grim picture. Our new income forecast brings together lower earnings 
growth, higher inflation, and tax/benefit changes. It shows that overall, the 
rest of this parliament looks set to be as grim as the last, with incomes 
growing by an average of 0.2 per cent a year, compared with 0.5 per cent a year 
between 2010-11 and 2014-15. While top earners were hit the hardest following 
the financial crisis, the big difference looking forward is that the biggest 
losers are lower income families, with the entire bottom third of the income 
distribution set to see incomes fall in the years ahead.

 * Brexit could be halted if the British people decided the costs of leaving 
the EU greatly outweighed any benefits, Tony Blair has said in an interview 
marking his self-proclaimed return to political activity. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/24/tony-blair-brexit-could-be-stopped-if-britons-change-their-minds>
 * George Osborne, the former chancellor, made more than £320,400 in a month 
from giving speeches to US banks, financial organisations and a university, his 
register of interests shows.

 * Andrew Lansley, the former Conservative health secretary, has urged the 
government to invest more in social care. Speaking on the World at One, he said 
he was “disappointed” that Philip Hammond did not address this in his autumn 
statement. Lansley said: 
The next two years are going to be incredibly difficult. And I think the time 
is now for trying to put some measures in place to try and help health and 
social care through those next two years.

 * Jeremy Corbyn has called for more money to be spent on hospitals, social 
care and mental health.Speaking ahead of Labour’s NHS campaign day on Saturday, 
he said the campaign had three elements. 
There’s three elements. One - hospital provision, under-funding of hospitals, 
waiting times and STP - sustainability and transformation plans, which are 
putting at risk a lot of A&E departments all around the country.

The second element is social care, under-funding of social care, the need to 
improve social care and improve the way in which we treat care workers. They’re 
vital, valuable, very responsible and very well experienced people. They should 
be treated better and paid better.

Third, there is a mental health crisis across the country. I feel very 
passionately about this, that’s why I have appointed a shadow minister at 
cabinet level just for dealing with mental health because I think as a country 
we have to face up to the crisis we’re in, fund it properly, but above all 
change the mood music as well. The biggest killer of under-50-year-old men is 
suicide from mental health conditions - that’s terrible.

the US as “utter nonsense”.

Number 10 has hit back at the IFS. It says that if you look at disposable 
income, not wages, then people are getting better off.

These are from Huffington Post’s Paul Waugh.

The IFS figures

 relate to earnings. Number 10 is talking about disposable income, a different 
measure that includes earnings, benefits and pensions, and looks at what’s left 
after tax and national insurance have been paid.
 
Open Britain, the group campaigning to keep Britain in the single market, has 
put out a statement from Labour’s Chris Leslie saying the IFS analysis shows 
that the economic warnings about Brexit issued during the EU referendum 
campaign were accurate. He said:

This is clear proof that the Brexit vote has made working families worse off. 
The irresponsibility of leave campaigners was breathtaking – they should now be 
admitting that economic warnings made during the campaign were not Project 
Fear; they were Project Fact.

Their promises that Brexit would make Britain better off now appear naive and 
complacent.
 
Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, told 
BBC News this afternoon that he did not acceptthe IFS claim that workers face 
the longest squeeze on wages for 70 years. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/ifs-warnsf-biggest-squeeze-on-pay-for-70-years-autumn-statement>
 Asked about its analysis, he said:

Well, actually, I’m surprised because wages are increasing, they’re increasing 
now, they’re increasing across the board and well above inflation. Yes, there 
was a period when they were absolutely static. But over the last two, two and a 
half years, wages hae been increasing and the forecasts all the way have been 
that wages will continue to increase. So I don’t recognise this dire prediction 
of no increase at all since the crash.

He also said that he did not accept the forecasts from bodies like the IFS and 
the Office for Budget Responsibility about the impact of Brexit on the economy.

My sense about this is that the UK economy is already confounding the 
forecasts. All the forecasts, from the IFS and from the OBR and everybody else, 
all said that we were going to see a downturn immediately after the Brexit 
vote. We haven’t seen that. The is growing faster than they predicted. We just 
saw the debt fall three days ago, when they predicted it would rise. So my 
sense about this is we are into territory where nobody really knows that the 
future holds.

Duncan Smith is right about wages growing now, but he ignores the fact that 
they fell so far, in real terms, that they have not caught up with where they 
were before the crash. The Resolution Foundation makes the point today in this 
chart, inits autumn statement analysis (pdf) 
<http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Bending-the-rules-AS.pdf>
 published this morning.

Here is John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, on the IFS analysis.

This lost decade for living standards is unprecedented in modern British 
history and is a damning indictment of the total, abject failure of the Tories’ 
economic policy during their six wasted years in office. The so-called 
‘long-term economic plan’ has meant long-term decline in living standards for 
working people even as the super-rich and the big corporations are given large 
tax giveaways.

Chancellor Philip Hammond <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond>
 promised action in the autumn statement for those ‘just about managing’. 
Instead he has betrayed them by continuing to slash in-work benefits, failing 
to raise the ‘national living wage’ to the level promised, failing to deliver 
more funding for our NHS and social care and now he’s threatening pensioners 
with removing the ‘triple lock’.

Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> has different priorities 
and will prepare our economy for Brexit. Instead of cutting taxes for the 
super-rich and giant corporations, we will make sure our NHS is properly 
funded, support the pensions ‘triple lock’, and introduce a real living wage 
built on an economy that invests for the long-term so that no-one and no 
community is left behind.
 
The IFS has now put up on its websites its distributional analysis slides 
(pdf). 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/ifs-warnsf-biggest-squeeze-on-pay-for-70-years-autumn-statement>

This one shows the impact of all tax and benefit reforms since the 2015 
election. They are highly regressive. The gains in the autumn statement (the 
light green bars) were very modest, and came nowhere near compensating for the 
impact of the benefit cuts announced byGeorge Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> last year.

And this shows the impact of the post-election tax and benefit changes on 
family groups. Pensioners have done best, especially wealthy pensioners. 
Working-age families without children were in the middle, and working-age 
families with children have done worst.

And here are two more important charts from one of the IFS slideshow 
presentations (pdf). 
<https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/budgets/as2016/as2016_ah.pdf>

This one shows the impact the government’s benefit freeze was going to have on 
families with inflation forecast to grow at the rate expected in March.

And this chart, or rather the dark green bars in this chart, show how the 
impact as got worse in the light of the new inflation forecasts.

wars and the second world war.

Here are the key points from Paul Johnson’s opening statement (pdf 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/24/ministers-defend-obr-after-pro-brexit-tories-accuse-it-of-scaremongering-politics-live?page=with:block-5836e982e4b0da4920d6bb49#block-5836e982e4b0da4920d6bb49>
) at the IFS autumn statement briefing.

 * Johnson said by 2021 wages would still be lower than they were in 2008 in 
real terms and that Britain has not had such a “dreadful” period without 
earnings growth since the second world war. (See 1.14pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/24/ministers-defend-obr-after-pro-brexit-tories-accuse-it-of-scaremongering-politics-live?page=with:block-5836e6ade4b0cc60d34769b8#block-5836e6ade4b0cc60d34769b8>
 * He said the expected rise in inflation meant the real value of the 
“national living wage” would rise by just over 20% during the course of this 
parliament, not 25% as expected. 
 * He said inflation also meant that “the real value of working age benefits 
like JSA [jobseeker’s allowance] that are currently frozen in cash terms will 
fall by 7.7% rather than 6.5%”. 
 * He said Philip Hammond had effectively adopted Ed Balls’ spending plans. 
Rather than aiming for Budget balance in 2019-20 Mr Hammond will be happy 
borrowing 2% of national income, that’s about £40 billion, in 2020-21. Remember 
that at the last election the then Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, said he was 
aiming to balance the current budget by 2018-19, i.e. borrow just to invest. 
Keeping to that over the parliament would have allowed borrowing of just over 
2% of GDP in 2020-21. To misquote Michael Heseltine, it wouldn’t be far from 
the truth to say that the new fiscal plans aren’t Osborne’s, they are Balls’.

 * He predicted that the government would have to spend more money on health 
or social care. 
Strikingly [Hammond] responded not at all to calls for more money for either 
the NHS or social care. I’m going to stick my neck out and suggest he won’t be 
able to do that for much longer.

 * He criticised the government for continuing to freeze fuel duty every year 
instead of simply abandoning the proposed annual increases. 
One of the more expensive measures announced was yet another freeze to fuel 
duty – the seventh year in a row this has happened. If the policy is never to 
increase fuel duty again, as seems to be the case, we should just be told 
rather than being told always that it will rise with inflation next year and 
then that never happening. This is turning into a really big problem both for 
the Treasury and for our approach to the taxation of motoring.

 * He said the OBR’s forecasts were “noticeably more upbeat” than the Bank of 
England’s. 
Earlier this month the Bank projected growth of 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6% in 2017, 
2018 and 2019 respectively. The OBR’s projections are for growth of 1.4, 1.7 
and 2.1%. That’s quite a big difference.

 * He said Hammond’s policy in the autumn statement amounted to “jam tomorrow” 
not “jam today”. 
In the face of deteriorating forecasts Mr Hammond neither tightened fiscal 
policy nor followed his predecessor’s example of sticking with previous 
spending plans. He loosened by an annual £10 billion or so. And he loosened in 
a rather specific way, mostly by increasing planned capital spending. Given the 
choice between jam today in the form of more money in people’s pockets and jam 
tomorrow in the form of potential economic returns from greater investment, he 
went for jam tomorrow.

 * He accused Hammond of being disingenuous about the increase in the 
insurance premium tax, arguing that the 12% rate was hard to justify. 
Mr Hammond wasn’t guilty of too many fiscal infelicities yesterday, but the 
way in which he announced the increase in IPT was certainly one of them. It is 
half the rate of VAT, he said, as if in explanation of the rise. Well, so it 
should be - in fact it should be lower. It’s only the value of the insurance – 
premiums net of pay outs – which one should think of as being VATable. That 
would imply an IPT rate much less than 10%, not more.

 * He said the IFS backed the idea of scrapping the autumn statement, although 
he expressed scepticism about whether this would happen. 
We will also wait and see whether this really is the last Autumn Statement. We 
have been here before after all. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke also moved from a 
separate Autumn Statement and Spring Budget to a single Autumn Budget. That 
didn’t survive a change of occupancy at number 11.

opening presentation at the IFS briefing.
 
Workers in Britain face the biggest squeeze on their pay for 70 years as a 
Brexit blow to the economy knocks wage growth and stokes inflation, according 
to an analysis of the UK’s government’s latest tax and spending plans.

Picking over Philip Hammond’s autumn statement, the Institute for Fiscal 
Studies <https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies> 
said real wages in the UK – pay adjusted for inflation – will still be below 
their 2008 level in 2021.

Paul Johnson, the thinktank’s director said in his presentation (pdf): 
<https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/budgets/as2016/as2016_pj.pdf> “One cannot 
stress how dreadful that is – more than a decade without real earnings growth. 
We have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 years.”

The warning follows signs that the pound’s sharp fall since the referendum 
result is hiking the cost of imports to the UK and could soon be passed on to 
consumers. At the same time, experts warn pay growth could stall as companies 
grapple with politicial and economic uncertainty.


On Wednesday, the government’s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget 
Responsibility, saidthe economy would slow next year and inflation would rise 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/nov/23/move-over-jams-next-year-this-time-the-focus-may-be-on-pgps>
.

In a separate analysis of the autumn statement 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/nov/24/uk-living-standards-squeeze-will-be-worse-than-after-global-crash>
, the thinktank, Resolution Foundation, said families faced a worse squeeze on 
their living standards over the next five years than they suffered in the wake 
of the financial crisis.
 
Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies>, has just 
started the IFS’s briefing on the autumn statement.

He says wages in real terms will still be below their 2008 levels in 2021. 
This is “dreadful”, he says.

Here is the key quote.

However, the outlook for living standards has deteriorated rather sharply 
since March. The OBR is forecasting both lower nominal wage growth as a result 
of lower productivity, and higher inflation resulting from the exchange rate 
depreciation. Overall real average earnings are forecast to rise by less than 
5% between now and 2021. That means they will be 3.7% lower in 2021 than was 
projected in March. To put it another way around half of the wage growth 
projected for the next five years back in March is not now projected to happen. 
On these projections real wages will, remarkably, still be below their 2008 
levels in 2021. One cannot stress enough how dreadful that is – more than a 
decade without real earnings growth. We have certainly not seen a period 
remotely like it in the last 70 years.

I will post a full summary of his statement shortly.
 
Only a third of voters think the measures announced in the autumn statement 
will help the economy, an ICM poll conducted for the Guardian suggests.

ICM carried out its survey online last night and, although respondents were 
generally positive about the measures in the autumn statement they were asked 
about, overall they did not seem very convinced that Philip Hammond’s policies 
would do a lot to help the economy.

Asked if the package of measures announced by Hammond would be helpful or 
unhelpful to the economy, the results were:

Helpful: 33%

Unhelpful: 8%

No difference: 35%

Don’t know: 24%

ICM also asked about six specific policies in the autumn. All received either 
majority or plurality support, but there were some interesting variations.

The measure with the highest net support was increasing the “national living 
wage” by 30p an hour to £7.50. But the measure with the highest number of 
people both supporting it, and saying it would make a difference, was 
increasing the income tax threshold to £11,500 in April (a measure announced by
George Osborne <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> in March, 
but reconfirmed by Hammond yesterday).

And the measure with the lowest net support was abandoning the 2019-20 budget 
surplus targets.

Here are the net support figures for the six policies (percentage saying they 
are in favour, whether or not they think it will make a difference).

Raising the “national living wage” - 82%

Raising the income tax threshold - 79%

Funding 40,000 new affordable homes - 73%

Investing an extra £1.1bn in transport - 68%

Not seeking any more welfare cuts - 53%

Abandoning the 2019-20 budget surplus target - 49%

And here are the same policies, but this time listed in order of people saying 
they support themand think the policy is sufficient to make a difference.

Raising the income tax threshold - 42% (against 38% in favour, but thinking it 
won’t be enough to make a difference)

Raising the “national living wage” - 34% (against 48% in favour/no difference)

Investing £1.1bn in transport - 32% (against 36% in favour/no difference)

Funding 40,000 new homes - 28% (against 45% in favour/no difference)

Not seeking welfare cuts - 24% (against 30% in favour/no difference)

Abandoning budget surplus target - 20% (against 29% in favour/no difference)

ICM Unlimited interviewed an online sample of 1,317 adults aged 18+, online on 
the evening of 23rd November 2016. Interviews were conducted across the country 
and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a 
member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.
 
George Osborne made £320,000 in a few weeks from delivering speeches in 
America, the Press Association reports.

The former chancellor, sacked from the government by Theresa May when she 
became prime minister in July, has been paid more than £80,000 a go for some of 
his recent speaking engagements.

The figures, revealed in the latest register of MPs’ financial interests, show 
Osborne expects to receive payments of £81,174 and £60,578 from JP Morgan for 
two speeches delivered at the start of October - a total of seven hours work.

Osborne signed up to the Washington Speakers’ Bureau after he left Government 
and he is due to be paid £80,240 from Palmex Derivatives for a speech in New 
York he gave on October 27 - which he recorded as a total of two hours work.

Osborne also expects to be paid £69,992 by the Securities Industry and 
Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) in return for a speech on September 27 
and October 18.

Meanwhile, the former chancellor is due to be paid £28,454 for a speech on 
October 17 from the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

The latest register of interests also show Michael Bloomberg paid for Osborne 
and his wife to attend a dinner for the former mayor of New York City in Paris.

The value of the travel, accommodation and dinner in the middle of October was 
estimated at £4,086.

Osborne has previously disclosed two helicopter trips in the register of 
interests: one in November 2015 to the Forest of Dean Conservative dinner and 
another to Ripon North Conservatives’ Summer Reception in July this year.
 
Tony Blair has given a lengthy interview to the New Statesman 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/11/tony-blair-s-unfinished-business>
. Here are some of the top lines.

 * Blair says that he wants to help resurrect centre-ground politics. As the 
Guardian reported on Monday,he is setting up a new political organisation next 
year. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/21/tony-blair-hoping-to-revitalise-centre-ground-with-political-comeback>
 In his interview he rules out a return to the political frontline himself, but 
he explains that he wants to help politicians who are challenging extremists. 
What I’m doing is to spend more time not in the front line of politics, 
because I have no intention of going back to the front line of politics, to 
correct another misunderstanding ... but in trying to create the space for a 
political debate about where modern Western democracies go and where the 
progressive forces particularly find their place ... I’m dismayed by the state 
of Western politics, but also incredibly motivated by it. I think in Britain 
today, you’ve got millions of effectively politically homeless people ...

What I’m interested in doing is asking: what are the types of ideas that we 
should be taking forward? How do we provide a service to people who are in the 
front line of politics, so that we can provide some thinking and some ideas? 
The thing that’s really tragic about politics today is that the best ideas 
about politics aren’t in politics. I find the ideas are much more interesting 
in the technology sector, much more interesting ideas about how you change the 
world.

 * He says that Brexit could be reversed. 
It can be stopped if the British people decide that, having seen what it 
means, the pain-gain/cost-benefit analysis doesn’t stack up. And that can 
happen in one of two ways. I’m not saying it will [be stopped], by the way, but 
it could. I’m just saying: until you see what it means, how do you know?

Explaining the two ways in which Brexit could be reversed, he goes on:

Either you get maximum access to the single market - in which case you’ll end 
up accepting a significant number of the rules on immigration, on payment into 
the budget, on the European court’s jurisdiction. People may then say, ‘Well, 
hang on, why are we leaving then?’ Or alternatively, you’ll be out of the 
single market and the economic pain may be very great, because beyond doubt if 
you do that you’ll have years, maybe a decade, of economic restructuring.
 
The Resolution Foundation thinktank has published its full verdict on the 
autumn statement. As my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot report, it 
is saying that the squeeze on living standards over the next five years could 
be even worse than it was during the financial crash.

Here is there story.

UK living standards squeeze 'will be worse than after global crash'
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/24/uk-living-standards-squeeze-will-be-worse-than-after-global-crash>
This is how it starts.

Families face a worse squeeze on their living standards over the next five 
years than they suffered in the wake of the financial crisis, as Brexit slows 
the economy and Conservative welfare cuts bite, according to a new report.

Analysis of Wednesday’s autumn statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/brexit-will-blow-59bn-hole-in-public-finances-admits-hammond>
 by the Resolution Foundation thinktank suggests average earnings are set to 
grow only half as rapidly as in the austerity years after the economic crisis. 
At the same time, living standards will be undermined by higher inflation and 
ongoing welfare cuts.

While the squeeze of the last parliament affected workers across the income 
spectrum, the foundation says low-paid households are set to be hardest hit 
over the next five years, because they are particularly affected by planned 
welfare cuts.

And here is the full Resolution Foundation report (pdf).

John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has also been giving interviews this 
morning. Here are the key points he has been making.

 * McDonnell indicated that Labour wanted taxes to be fairer, but that it was 
not looking to increase the overall tax burden. 
We’d make sure that instead of giving tax giveaways to the wealthy and 
corporations, and ignoring the issue of tax avoidance and tax evasion, we’d 
make sure we had a fair taxation system. And in that way we’re not talking 
about increasing taxes or anything like that, what we are saying is that we use 
our resources more effectively.

We will want to abide by the principles that you spend what you earn. 

They have given tax giveways on capital gains tax, on corporation tax, on 
inheritance tax to the wealthy in our community and also to corporations. And 
what we saw yesterday - they were cutting the universal credits that are going 
to be given to what they call Jams, the just about managing, people going into 
work, looking after their families, doing everything asked of them. So they’ve 
got the wrong priorities.

 * He defended Labour’s decision to support a tax cut for people paying the 
higher rate of income tax.Labour is backing the government’s plan to increase 
the tax threshold for people paying the higher 40p rate of income tax. Asked 
about this, he said: 
There are large numbers of people earning above £43,000 who are in jobs like 
train drivers, like senior teachers and others who have been hit and do need 
protecting.

If we are going to be doing redistribution we should be hitting those who are 
over [that level]. For example, our policy is 50p on £150,000, reverting to the 
original tax system we had some years ago.

We have to recognise that the reality of those people on middle incomes and 
the pressures that they are under, particularly with regard to housing costs in 
certain parts of our country.

 * He said Labour was committed to keeping the triple lock - the law that says 
pensions will rise every year by 2.5% or in line with earnings or inflation, 
whichever is higher. The Tories are committed to keeping this until 2020 but 
Philip Hammond, in his autumn statement, hinted that it could be dropped after 
that because it is too expensive. 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/state-pension-changes-cuts-autumn-statement-triple-lock-2016-latest-2020-a7434206.html>
 Asked if Hammond was right to review it, McDonnell replied: 
No, I would be very disappointed if he did [drop the triple lock]. Under the 
Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> government Gordon Brown 
wanted to tackle the issues around child poverty and pensioner poverty and that 
is what he did. He lifted people out of poverty at both stages of their lives, 
both children and older people ... If we can grow the economy, and we have a 
fair taxation system, we can afford it.

(McDonnell was right to say the last Labour government did a lot to reduce 
pensioner poverty, but the triple lock was actually a coalition policy, not a 
Labour one.)

 * He said the government’s failure to set out its Brexit stance was 
increasing economic uncertaintly. 
We can’t do these negotiations without openness and transparency. People need 
to know where is the government going and how is it going to get there. At 
least then you stabilise things and people will be able to settle down into 
serious negotiations and we will get the best deal. Until the government gets 
to that position, we are going to have these uncertainties and this speculation.

 * He played down the significance of a picture showing many Labour MPs 
looking at their phones in the Commons chamber when he was responding to 
Hammond yesterday. He said: 
It doesn’t look brilliant but that’s what they do now and they have to think 
themselves. The new style in parliament at the moment is people are tweeting 
all the time. They’re doing a running commentary on what’s going on. It doesn’t 
look good, but that’s what happens.

It’s interesting because everybody’s got these new handheld devices all the 
time, they’re tweeting all the time, but interestingly enough the general 
response to the points I was making was received quite well within parliament 
and outside.

And it’s interesting – I’ve never seen this before and this is not me boasting 
– if you looked at the MPs opposite me and those behind, I held their 
attention. Even though they’re tweeting, they’re tweeting about what I’m saying.

<https://twitter.com/JohnRentoul/status/801698989469003776>  
Here is a full summary of the main points from Philip Hammond’s interviews 
this morning.

 * Hammond said the economic future was uncertain because no one knew what the 
outcome of the Brexit talks would be.When it was put to him that the government 
was at fault for telling the Office for Budget Responsibility very little about 
its Brexit plans, he said that the government had said what it wanted: the 
greatest possible access to European markets. But the outcome of the Brexit 
negotiations would not just depend on what the government wanted, he went on. 
The fact is, it is not about what we want the outcome to be. It’s going to be 
a negotiation. We are going to sit at the table with the representatives of the 
European Union. And nobody, at this stage, can be certain about what the 
outcome of that negotiation will be. That is what creates the uncertainty, 
whether you are a chancellor of the exchequer trying to forecast the public 
finances for a couple of years down the line or whether you are a businessman 
making an investment in a production line.

He said the government was preparing for “a range of possible outcomes” from 
the Brexit talks. “That’s a sensible and prudent thing to do,” he said.

 * He defended the OBR, saying the government would be wrong to ignore its 
forecasts. Pro-Brexit Tories have criticised the OBR, saying its forecasts 
about the impact of Brexit on the economy are wrong. Hammond said it was 
important to remember that forecasting was not a precise science. But he said 
the government would be wrong to ignore what it said. 
Economic forecasting is not a precise science. And the OBR itself makes the 
point in its report that there is a very high degree of uncertainty around the 
report that they issued yesterday because of the circumstances that they are in.

When it was put to him that this means he thinks the OBR forecasts should be 
taken with “a pinch of salt”, as the Telegraph claims this morning, he replied:

I think we should look at what the report is projecting, we should certainly 
not ignore that, we should look at it as one of the possible range of outcomes 
that we need to plan for.

The BBC’s Ross Hawkins has posted this on Twitter, pointing out that Hammond 
was right to say the OBR has acknowledged a high degree of uncertainty.

 <https://twitter.com/rosschawkins/status/801701090668515328> 
 * He said the government was preparing for a possible economic slowdown next 
year. 
To me it makes sense, given the warning signals from the OBR report, to keep a 
little bit of firepower in the locker, to build a little bit of a reserve so 
that if there is a slowdown next year, we’ve got enough capacity to support the 
economy, to protect jobs, to ensure that the economy can get through any 
headwinds it encounters.

 * He rejected claims that debt was out of control. When it was put to him 
that the government had lost control of debt he replied: 
It’s not out of control, it’s larger than we would like it to be.

 * He rejected claims that the autumn statement contained nothing for “Jams”, 
the families who are “just about managing”. When this was put to him, he 
replied: 
I don’t think that’s true at all. We are facing very significant fiscal 
challenges. Within the constraints that that imposes, we’ve tried to focus what 
firepower we do have on helping those who are ordinary working families who are 
hard-pressed to get by.

Stopping the scheduled rise in fuel duty was an important step in that 
process. Reducing the taper in universal credit so that people in work on low 
wages are able to keep more of their wages. Recommitting to raising the 
personal allowance in the income tax system to 12,500 by the end of this 
parliament despite the fiscal challenges will leave everybody in this country 
better off.

If I ever need any advice from Nigel Farage I’ve got his number and I’ll give 
him a call. Tell him not to hold his breath.
