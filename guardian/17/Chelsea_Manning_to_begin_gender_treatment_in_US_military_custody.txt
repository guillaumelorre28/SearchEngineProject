The US Bureau of Prisons has rejected the Army's request to accept the 
transfer of national security leaker Private Chelsea Manning from a military 
prison. So the military will begin treatment for her gender-identity condition.

A defense official said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has approved the Army's 
recommendation to keepManning in military custody and start a rudimentary level 
of gender treatment.

The Army tried to get Manning transferred to the federal prison system, but 
officials said those discussions have ended.

Manning has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the sense of being a woman 
in a man's body. Civilian prisons can provide treatment, but the Defense 
Department doesn't have the medical expertise needed.

Officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to 
discuss the matter publicly by name.
