Just when we thought we were going to lose art history A level, the government 
recently announced a reprieve. As Anish Kapoor said: ‘Art and art history are 
the study of what inspires and guides the poetic in us.’

Studying art can have a dramatic effect on our brain activity, too. What we 
know changes how we look at things and this is easy to prove in the art world. 
Scientists have tracked the movements of an art historian’s eyes: the results 
show how they scan, fixate and linger on particular points of the canvas 
reveals their skill and is entirely different to someone with an untrained eye.

We know that every area of expertise changes our view of the world, so why 
concentrate on art historians? Simply because they are the easiest to study, as 
they’re often focusing on one static image at a time – unlike film critics, 
racing drivers or neurosurgeons. This may reassure parents worried about the 
gravitas of the subject. Now they know that if their children immerse 
themselves in art history, they will develop such a specialist skill it will 
produce a  change in their brains. Maybe more government ministers should study 
it, too.
