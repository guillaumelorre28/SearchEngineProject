A man has been charged with murdering his son and daughter and the attempted 
murder of their mother.

Endris Mohammed, 46, was charged with killing Saros Endris, eight, and 
six-year-old Leanor Endris, following a fire at their home in Birmingham. He 
was also charged with attempting to kill their mother, Penil Teklehaimanot.


Detectives interviewed Mohammed on Tuesday night about the deaths after his 
release from hospital, where he was being treated for burns suffered in a car 
fire.

He was discovered in the burning vehicle in Newcastle-under-Lyme, 
Staffordshire, hours after a fire at the children’s house in Holland Road, 
Birmingham, in October.

Both children were found in their home in the early hours of 28 October after 
the blaze, and were pronounced dead in hospital. An inquest heard that neither 
child’s death was a result of smoke inhalation or burns. Forensic tests were 
continuing to establish the cause of death.

Mohammed would appear at Walsall magistrates court later, West Midlands police 
said.
