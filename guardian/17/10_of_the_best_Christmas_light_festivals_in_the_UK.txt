Festival of Light and Sound, Eden Project, Cornwall


The Eden Project has a spectacular new light and sound show this Christmas. 
Visitors can watch from a viewing platform or walk along the pathways as lasers 
create a canopy of light, painting the biomes with festive colours, set to a 
soundscape of music and stories. There are light projections in the 
Mediterranean biome, too, illuminating the winter planting displays, plus live 
performances by musicians and choirs from the south-west. The show is the 
brainchild of light artist Chris Levene, who created the laser tribute to David 
Bowie at Glastonbury festival, and Marco Perry, Björk’s spatial sound designer. 
Other festive fun includes ice skating, winter storytelling, festive crafts and 
meeting Father Christmas and his elves. A baobab rum cocktail (or a smoothie 
for the kids) will take the chill off.
• From £22.50 adult/£12.60 child/£62 family/under-fives free, 5pm-8pm on 3, 4, 
9, 10, 11 and 16-23 December, and 5pm-7pm on 27-30 December,edenproject.com

multisensory path, including a scented fire garden, fibre-optic lawns and 
twinkling hedges. The lake is illuminated with lit-up boats, the fountains 
cascade in time to Christmas music, the waterfall is bathed in colour and the 
arbour sparkles with fairy lights. Santa Claus and his elves have set up their 
workshop in the boathouse, and there are festive sideshows and a Victorian 
carousel in the courtyard. Warm up with spiced cider, mulled wine and hot 
chocolate, roasted chestnuts and toasted marshmallows.

Longleat is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and it has pulled out 
all the stops for its third light festival. Giant lanterns take the shape of 
some of the park’s animals – an avenue of lions, a troop of monkeys – but there 
are also lots of Beatrix Potter characters, to mark the 150th anniversary of 
the author’s birth: Peter Rabbit, Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, Jemima Puddle-Duck, 
Squirrel Nutkin will all be there. There is also an illuminated Christmas scene 
and a 20-metre-high birthday cake. Altogether, the displays use 12 miles of 
silk, 30,000 bulbs and 2½ miles of LED lighting. Plus there is a Santa Express, 
a musical Christmas tree, an Arctic playzone for kids and an exhibition of 
costumes from the 1971 Royal Opera House production of The Tales of Beatrix 
Potter.
• From £27.85 adult/£20.65 child/under-threes free, to 2 January,

Light up the North <http://www.lightupthenorth.com/> is a network of light 
festivals in the north of England: York, Leeds, Lancaster, Durham, Blackpool, 
Salford – and, over Christmas, Gateshead. Enchanted Parks is an interactive 
walk through Saltwell park, just south of the town centre, along a trail of 
light with art installations, performances, sculptures and projections. The 
story being told is a Midwinter Night’s Tale, inspired by the 400th anniversary 
of William Shakespeare’s death.

The garden is glowing with giant illuminated flowers for the second year 
running – but this year they are bigger and brighter. Some of the trees are 
ablaze, too, including a liquidambar, giant redwood and scots pine. The 
glasshouse is decorated like a gingerbread house, and displays seasonal plants 
such as poinsettias, Christmas cacti and bromeliads. There are lanterns around 
the lake, and the plant centre has been turned into Santa and Mrs Claus’s 
grotto. The cafe serves hearty goulash, hot chocolate with marshmallows and 
spiced apple juice. Visitors can stock up at the Christmas shop, join stories 
and songs with Santa, and attend gingerbread-decorating workshops.

Kew is a special place to visit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jul/26/kew-gardens-london-kids-family-day-trip>
 at any time of the day or year, but the festive light show gives it a magical 
twist, as the mile-long trail through the garden sparkles with 60,000 lights, 
passing a Christmas karaoke juke box and eight newly commissioned artworks. 
These include singing Christmas trees, a light installation of 1,700 swaying 
flowers and a roaring fire garden. Some of the garden’s oldest and tallest 
trees are also beautifully lit along the way. The finale is the iconic Palm 
House and pond lit up with coloured laser beams and streams of light dancing to 
Christmas songs.

The national arboretum has a one-mile illuminated trail, with the towering 
trees lit up, and interactive displays along the way. There are free Christmas 
crafts, carol singing, an old-fashioned carousel and two Christmas shops – one 
is devoted to decorations, housed in a shepherd’s hut. Father Christmas is 
there with his elves, Mrs Christmas tells stories in a yuletide yurt, and 
stilt-walking versions of Jack Frost and the Christmas Fairy flit around. 
Winter warmers include hog roasts and Baileys hot chocolate.

The first Magical Lantern festival was held in Chiswick House Gardens, London, 
last winter. It is back from 19 January but, first, the magic is heading to 
Roundhay Park in Leeds and the Botanical Gardens in Birmingham. Each festival 
has a trail of giant lanterns, mixing seasonal themes, local landmarks and 
Chinese culture. In Birmingham, for example, there is a Bullring Bull alongside 
a Christmas fairy, snowmen, penguins, trees and presents. London (again at 
Chiswick) has a Houses of Parliament lantern and a Silk Road theme. Leeds is 
home to Santa’s grotto and a funfair, London has an ice rink and ice bar, and 
all three have Chinese food stalls and global street food.
• Leeds and Birmingham from £12.50 adult/£8.50 child/£38 family/under-fours

Norwich has created the UK’s first tunnel of light this Christmas. The 
45-metre passage on Hay Hill is made from 50,000 pulsating LEDs, designed to 
echo the colours and patterns of the northern lights. The city is also 
projecting Christmas films set to music on to the castle and town hall each 
night. There are lights all over the city, a eight-metre Christmas tree on the 
corner of Bethel Street and events from a Christmas tree festival at St Peter 
Mancroft church to craft markets.

Penzance has pushed the boat out this Christmas. Landmarks including St 
Michael’s Mount and St Mary’s church are lit up, and there is a competition for 
the brightest light-themed shop window display. On 17 December, there is a 
lantern parade to celebrate local scientist Humphry Davy, who invented the 
miner’s safety lamp. The Montol festival marks the winter solstice on 21 
December, with fire performers, processions and a huge midwinter bonfire. 
Nearby Newlyn and Mousehole, meanwhile, have spectacular displays of Christmas 
lights.
