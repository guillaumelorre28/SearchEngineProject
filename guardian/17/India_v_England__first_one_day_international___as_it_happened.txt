That’s all from me. England will be heartbroken by that: they made their 
highest ever score in India and had their hosts on the ropes at 63 for four. 
You really should win any match from there. But, as poorly as they bowled and 
as badly as Eoin Morgan captained his side - and they were both very bad - that 
was a brilliant chase from India. Virat Kohli has booted AB de Villiers off 
that elevated plane and claimed it for himself - his 27th ODI hundred was among 
his best. And after he struggled for support, Kedar Jadhav came in and didn’t 
just support but matched his captain. Their 200-run partnership left England 
with nothing in the tank and rooted the fourth-highest successful run chase in 
history. Bigger bats, smaller boundaries, pumped up players and all mean that 
record will probably change hands a few times in the coming years, but India’s 
batting was bloody brilliant nonetheless.

Virat Kohli reels in England in style to give India win in first ODI

India win by three wickets

48.1 overs: India 356-7 (Ashwin 15, Pandya 40) target 351 Ravi Ashwin slogs 
the first ball of the over into the stands beyond cow corner to complete a 
quite brilliant run-chase.

48th over: India 350-7 (Ashwin 9, Pandya 40) target 351 Cap’n Morgan wants 
this over and done with, so brings Rashid back into the attack. Attack. Talking 
of England bowlers who have come out of this in credit, Rashid has not. There 
is a review for a run-out when Ashwin calls Pandya through for a quick one but 
the batsman is home by inches. He celebrates by smashing the final ball down 
the ground for six over long-off.Scores level...

47th over: India 339-7 (Ashwin 7, Pandya 31) target 351 Ball keeps it tight, 
concedes just five and delays the inevitable. The big Notts man has come out of 
this with more credit than any England bowler bar Stokes.

46th over: India 334-7 (Ashwin 4, Pandya 30) target 351 One last over from 
Stokes, who has figures of 9-0-64-2 so far. Another glorious shot from Pandya 
brings India closer - opening the face and running a bumper to the third man 
fence. Five more from the other five balls, too, including a nicely timed two 
through midwicket for Ashwin. This has been a cracking little run-a-ball 
innings from Pandya, by the way, to nearly see India home.

Shubham Sharma writes: “The odds may still be in england’s favour now as India 
is known for its batting collapses. last year AUS had given a similiar total to 
IND in canberra. India were cruising at 250/2(centuries by kohli and 
dhawan),then they get all out for 300-something. Indians are known to lose 
their heads when their top man goes.”

45th over: India 325-7 (Ashwin 1, Pandya 24) target 351 Ball’s third wicket 
gives England a sniff, although the new man is Ashwin; hardly a mug. He might 
well just want to stand and watch Pandya, though, as the latter drills a drive 
as sweet as you’ll see through extra-cover for four. Seven from the over, just 
26 needed.

44th over: India 318-6 (Jadeja 13, Pandya 18) target 351 And here is Stokes 
but he’s immediately hurt: Moeen throws from mid-on looking to hit the stumps 
but Stokes, diving, wears it on the chest. He’s OK to continue, England fans 
will be pleased to hear. Unusually, given this over features both Stokes and 
Jadeja, it’s a fairly sedate one.

43rd over: India 314-6 (Jadeja 12, Pandya 16) target 351 Ball is back and he’s 
very harshly called for a wide from a short ball. That was barely shoulder 
height. A slightly lower delivery is then given the treatment by Jadeja, who 
creams it through midwicket on the pull for four. If England squint very hard 
and look towards the horizon, they might see the wheels.

42nd over: India 305-6 (Jadeja 7, Pandya 15) target 351 Speaking of optimstic, 
England are going back to spin and Moeen Ali. A single into the off-side brings 
up the 300 and one t’other way reduces the runs needed to 50. Expect lots of 
nudges and singles from hereon in. Six off this over, which is exactly what 
India’s doctor ordered.

41st over: India 299-6 (Jadeja 5, Pandya 12) target 351 Jadeja becomes, by my 
reckoning, the fourth batsman in this innings to get his first runs with a 
boundary and a lovely shot it is too: just a neat push, the bat turned towards 
the leg-side and the ball sent whistling along the baize to the midwicket 
boundary. England go for a wildly optimistic review but there’s nowt down.

Hate. Bloody. Football.

40th over: India 291-6 (Jadeja 0, Pandya 10) target 351 Hey look at that, a 
good over for England! Three runs and one lovely wicket. 60 runs needed.

“Is there a harder shot to play than a ‘back-foot on-drive over wide mid-on 
for an enormous six’ (34th over)?” asks Peter Davies. “How does he do it 
without falling over?” No is the answer to your first question; if I knew the 
answer to the second I’d be playing cricket rather than sat on a sofa writing 
about it.

Wicket! Jadhav c Stokes b Ball 120

The short ball works again for the tall Ball. Jadhav nails the pull straight 
to the man at deep midwicket.

39th over: India 288-5 (Jadhav 119, Pandya 8) target 351 England’s bowling is 
going the way of Manchester City’s defence: two very similar poor balls aimed 
down the leg-side and each batsman drags it along, round the corner and to the 
ropes.

38th over: India 277-5 (Jadhav 114, Pandya 2) target 351 Ball returns and 
Jadhav is more than happy to welcome him back: a length ball is launched 
imperiously back over his head and over long-off for the batsman’s third six. 
He is struggling with cramp though and mistimes another big heave; it plugs 
near cow corner but is a dot ball as he’s down hurt. Surely he can’t continue? 
Well, Kohli won’t be there to see his team home but Jadhav is damn well going 
to try. After a break he smashes the final ball high over midwicket for another 
six!

“Dear Dan,” writes Ravi Raman, “we were doing live coverage of cricket and 
football since 1998. Two sites, India On The Net (now closed) and Chennai 
Online (now changed beyond recognition).The dotcom bubble bursting followed by 
two more boom/bust periods put paid to our glorious experiments.”

37th over: India 264-5 (Jadhav 102, Pandya 1) target 351 Ben Stokes strikes 
then, as hoped, and the crowd goes quiet with 88 still needed. India should 
still win this and if they do that’ll go down as one of the great ODI innings. 
He and Stokes have shown today why they’re two of the most exciting cricketers 
in the men’s game. The latter nearly has two in an over when Pandya, on none, 
top edges a wild pull but it lands safely behind the keeper.

A mirage of hope for England. Slower and shorter outside off from Stokes. 
Kohli misreads it, looking to whack it over mid-on and he top-edges to Willey

Jadhav reaches his century

35th over: India 262-4 (Jadhav 101, Kohli 122) target 351 A new tactic: Woakes 
comes round the wicket to Kohli, just 50-odd runs too late. It’s not a 
brilliant tactic to be honest: the attempt to take the on-side out of the 
occasion is met with a closed bat face and a thumping clip through midwicket 
for four. A single later, Jadhav takes the other approach, opening the face and 
running it down to third man for a fantastichundred on his home ground!

35th over: India 251-4 (Jadhav 95, Kohli 117) target 351 Kohli gets two with a 
clip from a low full-toss but that’s about as good as it gets from this over. 
Still, a smattering of singles won’t dishearten them especially as the 250 
comes up.

“This match seems to be heading in a similar way to most of the recent Tests,” 
reckons Tom van der Gucht. “We bat first and grind out what appears to be a 
respectable total; a few wickets are taken providing more than a glimmer of 
hope that England are on top; then, Kohli comes in to bat; all our bowlers 
suddenly look pedestrian; we lose. I’m off to watch La La Land, hopefully when 
I come out of the film, England will have engineered a dramatic collapse. Then 
again, with Ashwin lurking in the wings and waiting to boff out some more runs 
whilst further breaking our hearts, it seems unlikely.”


La La Land is terrible. I haven’t seen it, but it’s a musical and therefore 
inherently wrong and weird. As for the cricket, Kohli has won this match; 
England’s batting was in no way to blame.

34th over: India 245-4 (Jadhav 93, Kohli 113) target 351 Oh this is getting 
silly. Kohli stands tall to a bumper from Woakes and lifts it, with a back-foot 
on-drive, over wide mid-on for an enormous six. There was a cheat code on EA 
SportsCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> 2005 that gave you a 
giant bat and enabled you to mistime any ball out the ground; that’s what this 
is like. A single and then Jadhav tickles one round the corner to move into the 
90s himself with a boundary. Time to break this old favourite out:

33rd over: India 232-4 (Jadhav 88, Kohli 106) target 351 After a drinks break, 
Stokes comes into the attack. He’s gone at more than 10 in his three overs so 
far but he has looked dangerous. After a couple of singles Jadhav mistimes a 
pull and top-edges it, but the ball lands safely in front of square-leg. That’s 
better from England.

Peter Salmon writes: “I’d actually assumed all the OBO correspondents were 
made-up, your Gary Naylors and John Starbucks and so forth - essentially that 
OBO is kind of like Sally Field in Sybil. Not even sure cricket exists any more 
- all this T20, absurd batting collapses and strike rates in the gazillions, 
all of which started at the same time as OBO. Surely the whole thing is one 
man’s madness, and somewhere, unwatched, there’s a proper test match going on 
with England 2-67 at lunch.”


Robert Wilson is warming to the theme: “You’re touchingly naive, dear Dan. 
Gary Naylor is bad medicine. He is a notorious (and out-dated) performance 
artist who pretends to be from Liverpool and to know about cricket. He’s 
actually the unacknowledged lovechild of Phillip K Dick and Cilla Black and a 
discredited dental hygienist. Never believe anything he says about Adil Rashid 
- though in fairness to him, hewas once an extra on The Larry Sanders Show.”

Good god what if you’re all right?

Kohli reaches his century

32nd over: India 229-4 (Jadhav 86, Kohli 105) target 351 Back comes Woakes, 
with a wicket or three needed. Kohli drills his first ball out to deep mid-on 
and wants two but Jadhav has overrun at the other end. Another single next ball 
brings Kohli back on strike, the crowd noise builds, camera phones (or whatever 
the kids use now) light up the stands and ... three dot balls but then Kohli 
drives a full one back down the ground tobring up his 27th ODI century with a 
stunning six! This is going to be one of the great innings.

31st over: India 221-4 (Jadhav 85, Kohli 98) target 351 With nowt for 26 from 
his first three overs, Adil Rashid is back on for Moeen. There’s little change 
though, another poor short ball is clubbed over midwicket for four then a 
better, fuller one outside off is driven extraordinarily over extra-cover for 
six. Magnificent batting from Jadhav, really.

“India should win this now, eh?” writes Simon McMahon, changing his tune.

30th over: India 208-4 (Jadhav 73, Kohli 97) target 351 On Sky, Nasser 
questions the fitness of the 31-year-old Jadhav. Three days before a certain 
OBOer, who shall go unnamed, turns 31 himself. Nass also notes that Jadhav has 
only faced seven dot balls, so his fitness can’t be that shoddy. As for his 
partner, Kohli knocks one into the leg-side to bring up India’s 200 and move 
himself into the 90s. I can’t imagine a batsman who would find those less 
nerve-racking. Buttler comes up to the stumps, Willey drops short and Kohli 
rocks back to ramp up and over third man for four. Told you. He gets three more

29th over: India 198-4 (Jadhav 71, Kohli 89) target 351 When it’s not your 
day... Moeen fires a quicker one down the leg-side, Buttler is too slow to 
react and off it goes to fine-leg for four byes. Four more singles and, from 
the last, two from a mistimed chip over midwicket by Jadhav.

The emails are coming as quickly as the runs. Damian Clarke has tried watching 
A: “Thanks for the reply. I actually made it to 45 seconds of the clip before 
throwing half a peeled carrot at the speaker. Please give my regards to Grant, 
I was at Brighton when he tore his larynx. Unfortunately, I was too far back to 
make it to the stage when he invited volunteers to sing the rest of the gig. 
The motley threesome of Sussex’s finest that did get on stage had clearly never 
heard anything other than Buck Rogers, and wasted their shot at glory by just 
screaming ‘Feeder! Fuck yeah!’ Tragic.”

28th over: India 188-4 (Jadhav 67, Kohli 83) target 351 Now Willey is back. 
Will he find the swing he got earlier? Will the change of pace trouble this 
pair? No. Kohli opens his stance, opens the face and flashes it past point for 
four. There wasn’t even any width for him to play that shot. Ludicrous.

“Bit unfair to call A a Feeder knock off given that they both started at the 
same time,” reckons Paul Boldrin. “I saw them both at the same gig in London, 
must have been one of their first big ones. They were supporting Jesus Lizard. 
I’m sure there are many Jesus Lizard fans reading the OBO who will almost 
certainly never have seen one of their videos embedded in the OBO, please could 
you fix this.”


Always happy to disappoint.

27th over: India 181-4 (Jadhav 66, Kohli 77) target 351 “Better for England,” 
I began writing as India took just three singles from the first five balls. 
Then Jadhav ruined that with a wonderful inside-out drive, flat over mid-off 
and it bounces just inside the rope for four.

26th over: India 174-4 (Jadhav 61, Kohli 75) target 351 Almost as if he’d only 
just remembered that this is Joe Root, a part-time bowler, Kohli comes down the 
track and launches one high over midwicket for a monstrous six. The replay 
doesn’t need to add a shotgun sound effect but does for bad measure. Jadhav’s 
boundary in the previous over brought up the100 partnership, by the way. It’s 
now worth Nelson from 87 balls.

25th over: India 165-4 (Jadhav 60, Kohli 67) target 351 Jadhav goes for a walk 
and thinks about whacking Moeen down the ground, but the bowler sees him coming 
and drags his length back, forcing the batsman to defend. England only need to 
find 10 overs of spin and this is the eighth. Jadhav does club the final ball 
of the over down the ground and, despite a very good attempt at flicking it 
back in from Stokes, the fielder signals that it’s four runs.

23rd over: India 152-4 (Jadhav 52, Kohli 62) target 351 And there’s Jadhav’s 50
 from just 29 balls, the 29th of which was worked into the on-side for one. 
After a shoddy start, Kohli has found a partner who can not just stay there but 
match the captain for his contribution to this chase. Later in the over, Kohli 
takes a single to bring up the 150, which will be rather pleasing given his 
side were 63 for four. I’d bring Willey back on soon for a short burst.

22nd over: India 147-4 (Jadhav 49, Kohli 60) target 351 Another change: Root 
is into the attack. Is this a sniff of desperation or a hunch that he might 
surprise the batsmen from Morgan? My money would be on the former, though 
Morgan would never admit it. After a handful of singles, Kohli gets two with a 
push into the leg-side and moves to 60. India on to a snooker-friendly 147.

21st over: India 140-4 (Jadhav 45, Kohli 57) target 351 This is going to be 
crucial: spin from both ends as Moeen comes on with this partnership looking 
very settled on 70. Jadhav waits on a straight one wide of off, waits a bit 
longer, keeeeeps waiting, opens the face with a flourish of the wrists and 
steers it behind point for - yep - four runs.

More on liveblogging heritage from David Duncan: “Huge fan of OBO, I had a 
good story about how to cook squirrel chilli noted once. But just a wee 
shoutout to a dotcom startup from the late 90’s calledbritsport.com 
<http://britsport.com/> which did (first?) live online cricket text commentary 
of the Scottish cricket cup final from Linlithgow some time in the late 90s (I 
can’t find it online). Also did first ever (I think) live video streaming of a 
sport event (same era, English Youth Basketball finals).”

20th over: India 132-4 (Jadhav 39, Kohli 55) target 351 It seems as though 
Kohli wants two from every ball and there’s a risk he and Jadhav could fall out 
over the matter. A run out could be brewing. Jadhav does get two from a 
mistimed pull over mid-on, then four slog-sweeping a rubbish short one through 
midwicket. He’s crept up to 39 very nicely.

19th over: India 125-4 (Jadhav 33, Kohli 54) target 351 The way these two are 
happy to take it easy and just see Ball off suggests they fancy getting stuck 
into Rashid and, perhaps, Moeen later on. Six off the over, five off the bat 
and all utterly forgettable.

Angus Doulton asks: “Did you chance upon the episode of Midsomer Murders in 
which the captain of the village side was murdered in the nets by a full speed 
beamer from the bowling machine while the vice was impaled by a stump fired 
from a crossbow-like contraption? It was clear that the script writer had taken 
the need to redress the balance between vastly over engineered modern bats and 
the still unreformed ball to heart. I’m wondering whether the ODI format might 
provide the ideal testing ground for such ideas.”


No, but I was getting updates from my girlfriend and then saw Dan Norcross 
from TMS live-tweeting the repeat. I’m going to have a look for it online later 
this afternoon.

18th over: India 119-4 (Jadhav 31, Kohli 51) target 351 A brief pause as, two 
overs on from drinks, the batsmen take another drink. I guess it must be hotter 
out there than it is here in Manchester. Not a great amount of turn here (well, 
there) for Rashid. Kohli drills a full delivery off his toes and out through 
deep midwicket for two runs, bringing up his39th half-century in ODI cricket, 
from 45 balls. He has 26 hundreds to go with those, too. Crivenny. Jadhav goes 
hard at the final ball, slog-sweeping it hard over long-on (!) for six!

17th over: India 108-4 (Jadhav 24, Kohli 47) target 351 Ball continues from 
the other end. It’s a rare quiet over, just six singles milked from it. The 
required rate is above seven, which isn’t a huge ask for this batting lineup, 
having as it does Ravi Ashwin at No9.

Syndey and I’d just like to say that nothing can possibly go wrong now.” Why do 
I get the sneaking suspicion you’re Australian, Richard?

and sorry to say that rank ball is still there: a half-tracker that Jadhav 
mullers through square on the pull to bring up India’s hundred.

15th over: India 94-4 (Jadhav 15, Kohli 42) target 351 Ah Jake. Jadhav slashes 
a cut behind point, Ball comes round and dives for it at deep backward point 
and promptly palms the ball into his own face. Forget it Jake: the ball spins 
back to the rope. Jadhav is more convincing next ball, guiding it wide of 
Rashid at mid-on and away for another boundary. That’sdrinks.

14th over: India 82-4 (Jadhav 5, Kohli 40) target 351 Don’t put your money on 
England while Kohlie is at the crease; he gets his fourth boundary with a 
sweet, crunching drive through extra cover, a shot he’s played a thousand times 
if he’s played it at all. His ODI average is 64 chasing, compared to 41 batting 
first.

“Afternoon Dan.” Afternoon,  Brian Flanagan  Simon McMahon. “Like, I suspect, 
a lot of people, I first started reading the OBO during the 2005 Ashes, though 
it was a few years after that before I started ‘contributing’. Many years later 
and it remains a thing of wonder. A mistress, wife, mother, daughter, errant 
child. Bringing tears to your eyes and blood to your shoulders. Highs, lows, 
hope and despair. Not to mention cocktails. England should win this now, eh?”

13th over: India 74-4 (Jadhav 4, Kohli 33) target 351 Kohli looks to clamber 
into a wide-ish one from Stokes but is denied all four runs by a cracking dive 
from Morgan at cover. The scalpel is going to be more effective than the hammer 
here, you think and Kohli proves as much with a lovely timed push back past the 
bowler to the long-on boundary. After a single and a wide, Jadhav joins in with 
the Getting Off The Mark With A Boundary lark, doing so with a mistimed pull 
over midwicket.

Here’s Ian Copestake: “Not that I wish to cast nasturtiums on your 
unKohli-like circle of friends, but does your Feeder friend not like cricket? 
Or is he Phil Starbuck in disguise?” Very good. But he’s a rugby man.

Wicket! Dhoni c Willey b Ball 6

This is big! Short from Ball and it comes back into the batsman just a 
fraction. Dhoni goes for the pull and sends top-edges Ball’s ball to Willey. 
Don’t say we don’t give you innuendo here.

11th over: India 61-3 (Dhoni 5, Kohli 26) target 351 10 overs done and it’s 
time for a change of bowling: Stokes is into the attack and a loose line is 
first punished, Yuvraj turning him off the pads for four to fine leg, then 
effective as an attempt at repeating the shot brings only a fine inside edge 
through to the keeper. England are on top now, although that’s a risky thing to 
say when you see who the next man in is. The former captain is under way with a 
nice wristy cut behind point for four.

That’s all from me. England will be heartbroken by that: they made their 
highest ever score in India and had their hosts on the ropes at 63 for four. 
You really should win any match from there. But, as poorly as they bowled and 
as badly as Eoin Morgan captained his side - and they were both very bad - that 
was a brilliant chase from India. Virat Kohli has booted AB de Villiers off 
that elevated plane and claimed it for himself - his 27th ODI hundred was among 
his best. And after he struggled for support, Kedar Jadhav came in and didn’t 
just support but matched his captain. Their 200-run partnership left England 
with nothing in the tank and rooted the fourth-highest successful run chase in 
history. Bigger bats, smaller boundaries, pumped up players and all mean that 
record will probably change hands a few times in the coming years, but India’s 
batting was bloody brilliant nonetheless.

Join us again on Thursday for match two of three. Thank you for reading and 
cheers for all your emails/tweets. Sorry I couldn’t get them all in. Bye!
 
48.1 overs: India 356-7 (Ashwin 15, Pandya 40) target 351 Ravi Ashwin slogs 
the first ball of the over into the stands beyond cow corner to complete a 
quite brilliant run-chase.
 
48th over: India 350-7 (Ashwin 9, Pandya 40) target 351 Cap’n Morgan wants 
this over and done with, so brings Rashid back into the attack. Attack. Talking 
of England bowlers who have come out of this in credit, Rashid has not. There 
is a review for a run-out when Ashwin calls Pandya through for a quick one but 
the batsman is home by inches. He celebrates by smashing the final ball down 
the ground for six over long-off.Scores level...
 
47th over: India 339-7 (Ashwin 7, Pandya 31) target 351 Ball keeps it tight, 
concedes just five and delays the inevitable. The big Notts man has come out of 
this with more credit than any England bowler bar Stokes.
 
46th over: India 334-7 (Ashwin 4, Pandya 30) target 351 One last over from 
Stokes, who has figures of 9-0-64-2 so far. Another glorious shot from Pandya 
brings India closer - opening the face and running a bumper to the third man 
fence. Five more from the other five balls, too, including a nicely timed two 
through midwicket for Ashwin. This has been a cracking little run-a-ball 
innings from Pandya, by the way, to nearly see India home.

Shubham Sharma writes: “The odds may still be in england’s favour now as India 
is known for its batting collapses. last year AUS had given a similiar total to 
IND in canberra. India were cruising at 250/2(centuries by kohli and 
dhawan),then they get all out for 300-something. Indians are known to lose 
their heads when their top man goes.”


No.
 
45th over: India 325-7 (Ashwin 1, Pandya 24) target 351 Ball’s third wicket 
gives England a sniff, although the new man is Ashwin; hardly a mug. He might 
well just want to stand and watch Pandya, though, as the latter drills a drive 
as sweet as you’ll see through extra-cover for four. Seven from the over, just 
26 needed.
 
Jadeja’s innings falls a touch flat: a short one from Ball again and this time 
it sticks in the pitch. Jadeja top-edges to Rashid at midwicket.
 
44th over: India 318-6 (Jadeja 13, Pandya 18) target 351 And here is Stokes 
but he’s immediately hurt: Moeen throws from mid-on looking to hit the stumps 
but Stokes, diving, wears it on the chest. He’s OK to continue, England fans 
will be pleased to hear. Unusually, given this over features both Stokes and 
Jadeja, it’s a fairly sedate one.
 
43rd over: India 314-6 (Jadeja 12, Pandya 16) target 351 Ball is back and he’s 
very harshly called for a wide from a short ball. That was barely shoulder 
height. A slightly lower delivery is then given the treatment by Jadeja, who 
creams it through midwicket on the pull for four. If England squint very hard 
and look towards the horizon, they might see the wheels.

42nd over: India 305-6 (Jadeja 7, Pandya 15) target 351 Speaking of optimstic, 
England are going back to spin and Moeen Ali. A single into the off-side brings 
up the 300 and one t’other way reduces the runs needed to 50. Expect lots of 
nudges and singles from hereon in. Six off this over, which is exactly what 
India’s doctor ordered.
 
41st over: India 299-6 (Jadeja 5, Pandya 12) target 351 Jadeja becomes, by my 
reckoning, the fourth batsman in this innings to get his first runs with a 
boundary and a lovely shot it is too: just a neat push, the bat turned towards 
the leg-side and the ball sent whistling along the baize to the midwicket 
boundary. England go for a wildly optimistic review but there’s nowt down.

Hate. Bloody. Football. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/jan/15/everton-manchester-city-premier-league-live>
 
It’s going miles over the top.
 
Given not out, lbw against Jadeja. Looked high to me.
 
40th over: India 291-6 (Jadeja 0, Pandya 10) target 351 Hey look at that, a 
good over for England! Three runs and one lovely wicket. 60 runs needed.

“Is there a harder shot to play than a ‘back-foot on-drive over wide mid-on 
for an enormous six’ (34th over)?” asks Peter Davies. “How does he do it 
without falling over?” No is the answer to your first question; if I knew the 
answer to the second I’d be playing cricket rather than sat on a sofa writing 
about it.

 
The short ball works again for the tall Ball. Jadhav nails the pull straight 
to the man at deep midwicket.
 
39th over: India 288-5 (Jadhav 119, Pandya 8) target 351 England’s bowling is 
going the way of Manchester City’s defence: two very similar poor balls aimed 
down the leg-side and each batsman drags it along, round the corner and to the 
ropes.
 
38th over: India 277-5 (Jadhav 114, Pandya 2) target 351 Ball returns and 
Jadhav is more than happy to welcome him back: a length ball is launched 
imperiously back over his head and over long-off for the batsman’s third six. 
He is struggling with cramp though and mistimes another big heave; it plugs 
near cow corner but is a dot ball as he’s down hurt. Surely he can’t continue? 
Well, Kohli won’t be there to see his team home but Jadhav is damn well going 
to try. After a break he smashes the final ball high over midwicket for another 
six!

“Dear Dan,” writes Ravi Raman, “we were doing live coverage of cricket and 
football since 1998. Two sites, India On The Net (now closed) and Chennai 
Online (now changed beyond recognition).The dotcom bubble bursting followed by 
two more boom/bust periods put paid to our glorious experiments.”

 
37th over: India 264-5 (Jadhav 102, Pandya 1) target 351 Ben Stokes strikes 
then, as hoped, and the crowd goes quiet with 88 still needed. India should 
still win this and if they do that’ll go down as one of the great ODI innings. 
He and Stokes have shown today why they’re two of the most exciting cricketers 
in the men’s game. The latter nearly has two in an over when Pandya, on none, 
top edges a wild pull but it lands safely behind the keeper.
 
A mirage of hope for England. Slower and shorter outside off from Stokes. 
Kohli misreads it, looking to whack it over mid-on and he top-edges to Willey 
at cover.
 
35th over: India 262-4 (Jadhav 101, Kohli 122) target 351 A new tactic: Woakes 
comes round the wicket to Kohli, just 50-odd runs too late. It’s not a 
brilliant tactic to be honest: the attempt to take the on-side out of the 
occasion is met with a closed bat face and a thumping clip through midwicket 
for four. A single later, Jadhav takes the other approach, opening the face and 
running it down to third man for a fantastichundred on his home ground!
 
35th over: India 251-4 (Jadhav 95, Kohli 117) target 351 Kohli gets two with a 
clip from a low full-toss but that’s about as good as it gets from this over. 
Still, a smattering of singles won’t dishearten them especially as the 250 
comes up.

“This match seems to be heading in a similar way to most of the recent Tests,” 
reckons Tom van der Gucht. “We bat first and grind out what appears to be a 
respectable total; a few wickets are taken providing more than a glimmer of 
hope that England are on top; then, Kohli comes in to bat; all our bowlers 
suddenly look pedestrian; we lose. I’m off to watch La La Land, hopefully when 
I come out of the film, England will have engineered a dramatic collapse. Then 
again, with Ashwin lurking in the wings and waiting to boff out some more runs 
whilst further breaking our hearts, it seems unlikely.”


La La Land is terrible. I haven’t seen it, but it’s a musical and therefore 
inherently wrong and weird. As for the cricket, Kohli has won this match; 
England’s batting was in no way to blame.
 
34th over: India 245-4 (Jadhav 93, Kohli 113) target 351 Oh this is getting 
silly. Kohli stands tall to a bumper from Woakes and lifts it, with a back-foot 
on-drive, over wide mid-on for an enormous six. There was a cheat code on EA 
SportsCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> 2005 that gave you a 
giant bat and enabled you to mistime any ball out the ground; that’s what this 
is like. A single and then Jadhav tickles one round the corner to move into the 
90s himself with a boundary. Time to break this old favourite out:
 
33rd over: India 232-4 (Jadhav 88, Kohli 106) target 351 After a drinks break, 
Stokes comes into the attack. He’s gone at more than 10 in his three overs so 
far but he has looked dangerous. After a couple of singles Jadhav mistimes a 
pull and top-edges it, but the ball lands safely in front of square-leg. That’s 
better from England.

Peter Salmon writes: “I’d actually assumed all the OBO correspondents were 
made-up, your Gary Naylors and John Starbucks and so forth - essentially that 
OBO is kind of like Sally Field in Sybil. Not even sure cricket exists any more 
- all this T20, absurd batting collapses and strike rates in the gazillions, 
all of which started at the same time as OBO. Surely the whole thing is one 
man’s madness, and somewhere, unwatched, there’s a proper test match going on 
with England 2-67 at lunch.”


Robert Wilson is warming to the theme: “You’re touchingly naive, dear Dan. 
Gary Naylor is bad medicine. He is a notorious (and out-dated) performance 
artist who pretends to be from Liverpool and to know about cricket. He’s 
actually the unacknowledged lovechild of Phillip K Dick and Cilla Black and a 
discredited dental hygienist. Never believe anything he says about Adil Rashid 
- though in fairness to him, hewas once an extra on The Larry Sanders Show.”

Good god what if you’re all right?
 
32nd over: India 229-4 (Jadhav 86, Kohli 105) target 351 Back comes Woakes, 
with a wicket or three needed. Kohli drills his first ball out to deep mid-on 
and wants two but Jadhav has overrun at the other end. Another single next ball 
brings Kohli back on strike, the crowd noise builds, camera phones (or whatever 
the kids use now) light up the stands and ... three dot balls but then Kohli 
drives a full one back down the ground tobring up his 27th ODI century with a 
stunning six! This is going to be one of the great innings.
 Kohli celebrates his hundred. Photograph: Rajanish Kakade/AP  
31st over: India 221-4 (Jadhav 85, Kohli 98) target 351 With nowt for 26 from 
his first three overs, Adil Rashid is back on for Moeen. There’s little change 
though, another poor short ball is clubbed over midwicket for four then a 
better, fuller one outside off is driven extraordinarily over extra-cover for 
six. Magnificent batting from Jadhav, really.

“India should win this now, eh?” writes Simon McMahon, changing his tune.

 
30th over: India 208-4 (Jadhav 73, Kohli 97) target 351 On Sky, Nasser 
questions the fitness of the 31-year-old Jadhav. Three days before a certain 
OBOer, who shall go unnamed, turns 31 himself. Nass also notes that Jadhav has 
only faced seven dot balls, so his fitness can’t be that shoddy. As for his 
partner, Kohli knocks one into the leg-side to bring up India’s 200 and move 
himself into the 90s. I can’t imagine a batsman who would find those less 
nerve-racking. Buttler comes up to the stumps, Willey drops short and Kohli 
rocks back to ramp up and over third man for four. Told you. He gets three more 
from the next two balls. He won’t be in the 90s long.
 
29th over: India 198-4 (Jadhav 71, Kohli 89) target 351 When it’s not your 
day... Moeen fires a quicker one down the leg-side, Buttler is too slow to 
react and off it goes to fine-leg for four byes. Four more singles and, from 
the last, two from a mistimed chip over midwicket by Jadhav.

The emails are coming as quickly as the runs. Damian Clarke has tried watching 
A: “Thanks for the reply. I actually made it to 45 seconds of the clip before 
throwing half a peeled carrot at the speaker. Please give my regards to Grant, 
I was at Brighton when he tore his larynx. Unfortunately, I was too far back to 
make it to the stage when he invited volunteers to sing the rest of the gig. 
The motley threesome of Sussex’s finest that did get on stage had clearly never 
heard anything other than Buck Rogers, and wasted their shot at glory by just 
screaming ‘Feeder! Fuck yeah!’ Tragic.”
 
28th over: India 188-4 (Jadhav 67, Kohli 83) target 351 Now Willey is back. 
Will he find the swing he got earlier? Will the change of pace trouble this 
pair? No. Kohli opens his stance, opens the face and flashes it past point for 
four. There wasn’t even any width for him to play that shot. Ludicrous.

“Bit unfair to call A a Feeder knock off given that they both started at the 
same time,” reckons Paul Boldrin. “I saw them both at the same gig in London, 
must have been one of their first big ones. They were supporting Jesus Lizard. 
I’m sure there are many Jesus Lizard fans reading the OBO who will almost 
certainly never have seen one of their videos embedded in the OBO, please could 
you fix this.”


Always happy to disappoint.
 Sorry.  
27th over: India 181-4 (Jadhav 66, Kohli 77) target 351 “Better for England,” 
I began writing as India took just three singles from the first five balls. 
Then Jadhav ruined that with a wonderful inside-out drive, flat over mid-off 
and it bounces just inside the rope for four.
 
26th over: India 174-4 (Jadhav 61, Kohli 75) target 351 Almost as if he’d only 
just remembered that this is Joe Root, a part-time bowler, Kohli comes down the 
track and launches one high over midwicket for a monstrous six. The replay 
doesn’t need to add a shotgun sound effect but does for bad measure. Jadhav’s 
boundary in the previous over brought up the100 partnership, by the way. It’s 
now worth Nelson from 87 balls.
 
25th over: India 165-4 (Jadhav 60, Kohli 67) target 351 Jadhav goes for a walk 
and thinks about whacking Moeen down the ground, but the bowler sees him coming 
and drags his length back, forcing the batsman to defend. England only need to 
find 10 overs of spin and this is the eighth. Jadhav does club the final ball 
of the over down the ground and, despite a very good attempt at flicking it 
back in from Stokes, the fielder signals that it’s four runs.
 
24th over: India 158-4 (Jadhav 55, Kohli 66) target 351 Another break as the 
batsmen take drinks, as they have every other over. Without wanting to 
moralise, that’s not really on. Six off the over. This is marvellous chasing.

Not true. I too used to think Naylor was a figment of OBOers’ imaginations but 
I have met him.
 
23rd over: India 152-4 (Jadhav 52, Kohli 62) target 351 And there’s Jadhav’s 50
 from just 29 balls, the 29th of which was worked into the on-side for one. 
After a shoddy start, Kohli has found a partner who can not just stay there but 
match the captain for his contribution to this chase. Later in the over, Kohli 
takes a single to bring up the 150, which will be rather pleasing given his 
side were 63 for four. I’d bring Willey back on soon for a short burst.
 
22nd over: India 147-4 (Jadhav 49, Kohli 60) target 351 Another change: Root 
is into the attack. Is this a sniff of desperation or a hunch that he might 
surprise the batsmen from Morgan? My money would be on the former, though 
Morgan would never admit it. After a handful of singles, Kohli gets two with a 
push into the leg-side and moves to 60. India on to a snooker-friendly 147.
 
21st over: India 140-4 (Jadhav 45, Kohli 57) target 351 This is going to be 
crucial: spin from both ends as Moeen comes on with this partnership looking 
very settled on 70. Jadhav waits on a straight one wide of off, waits a bit 
longer, keeeeeps waiting, opens the face with a flourish of the wrists and 
steers it behind point for - yep - four runs.

More on liveblogging heritage from David Duncan: “Huge fan of OBO, I had a 
good story about how to cook squirrel chilli noted once. But just a wee 
shoutout to a dotcom startup from the late 90’s calledbritsport.com 
<http://britsport.com/> which did (first?) live online cricket text commentary 
of the Scottish cricket cup final from Linlithgow some time in the late 90s (I 
can’t find it online). Also did first ever (I think) live video streaming of a 
sport event (same era, English Youth Basketball finals).”
 
20th over: India 132-4 (Jadhav 39, Kohli 55) target 351 It seems as though 
Kohli wants two from every ball and there’s a risk he and Jadhav could fall out 
over the matter. A run out could be brewing. Jadhav does get two from a 
mistimed pull over mid-on, then four slog-sweeping a rubbish short one through 
midwicket. He’s crept up to 39 very nicely.
 
19th over: India 125-4 (Jadhav 33, Kohli 54) target 351 The way these two are 
happy to take it easy and just see Ball off suggests they fancy getting stuck 
into Rashid and, perhaps, Moeen later on. Six off the over, five off the bat 
and all utterly forgettable.

Angus Doulton asks: “Did you chance upon the episode of Midsomer Murders in 
which the captain of the village side was murdered in the nets by a full speed 
beamer from the bowling machine while the vice was impaled by a stump fired 
from a crossbow-like contraption? It was clear that the script writer had taken 
the need to redress the balance between vastly over engineered modern bats and 
the still unreformed ball to heart. I’m wondering whether the ODI format might 
provide the ideal testing ground for such ideas.”


No, but I was getting updates from my girlfriend and then saw Dan Norcross 
from TMS live-tweeting the repeat. I’m going to have a look for it online later 
this afternoon.
 
18th over: India 119-4 (Jadhav 31, Kohli 51) target 351 A brief pause as, two 
overs on from drinks, the batsmen take another drink. I guess it must be hotter 
out there than it is here in Manchester. Not a great amount of turn here (well, 
there) for Rashid. Kohli drills a full delivery off his toes and out through 
deep midwicket for two runs, bringing up his39th half-century in ODI cricket, 
from 45 balls. He has 26 hundreds to go with those, too. Crivenny. Jadhav goes 
hard at the final ball, slog-sweeping it hard over long-on (!) for six!
 
17th over: India 108-4 (Jadhav 24, Kohli 47) target 351 Ball continues from 
the other end. It’s a rare quiet over, just six singles milked from it. The 
required rate is above seven, which isn’t a huge ask for this batting lineup, 
having as it does Ravi Ashwin at No9.


Richard Stanton writes: “I’m reading the OBO lying down in a dark room in 
Syndey and I’d just like to say that nothing can possibly go wrong now.” Why do 
I get the sneaking suspicion you’re Australian, Richard?
 
16th over: India 102-4 (Jadhav 21, Kohli 44) target 351 Spin now from Rashid 
and sorry to say that rank ball is still there: a half-tracker that Jadhav 
mullers through square on the pull to bring up India’s hundred.
 
15th over: India 94-4 (Jadhav 15, Kohli 42) target 351 Ah Jake. Jadhav slashes 
a cut behind point, Ball comes round and dives for it at deep backward point 
and promptly palms the ball into his own face. Forget it Jake: the ball spins 
back to the rope. Jadhav is more convincing next ball, guiding it wide of 
Rashid at mid-on and away for another boundary. That’sdrinks.
 
14th over: India 82-4 (Jadhav 5, Kohli 40) target 351 Don’t put your money on 
England while Kohlie is at the crease; he gets his fourth boundary with a 
sweet, crunching drive through extra cover, a shot he’s played a thousand times 
if he’s played it at all. His ODI average is 64 chasing, compared to 41 batting 
first.

“Afternoon Dan.” Afternoon,  Brian Flanagan  Simon McMahon. “Like, I suspect, 
a lot of people, I first started reading the OBO during the 2005 Ashes, though 
it was a few years after that before I started ‘contributing’. Many years later 
and it remains a thing of wonder. A mistress, wife, mother, daughter, errant 
child. Bringing tears to your eyes and blood to your shoulders. Highs, lows, 
hope and despair. Not to mention cocktails. England should win this now, eh?”

 
13th over: India 74-4 (Jadhav 4, Kohli 33) target 351 Kohli looks to clamber 
into a wide-ish one from Stokes but is denied all four runs by a cracking dive 
from Morgan at cover. The scalpel is going to be more effective than the hammer 
here, you think and Kohli proves as much with a lovely timed push back past the 
bowler to the long-on boundary. After a single and a wide, Jadhav joins in with 
the Getting Off The Mark With A Boundary lark, doing so with a mistimed pull 
over midwicket.

Here’s Ian Copestake: “Not that I wish to cast nasturtiums on your 
unKohli-like circle of friends, but does your Feeder friend not like cricket? 
Or is he Phil Starbuck in disguise?” Very good. But he’s a rugby man.

 
12th over: India 64-4 (Jadhav 0, Kohli 28) target 351 Here’s Ball, who bowled 
the 10th over I should have said. After a couple of singles he digs one in 
short and sends Dhoni packing. England are strong favourites now.
 
This is big! Short from Ball and it comes back into the batsman just a 
fraction. Dhoni goes for the pull and sends top-edges Ball’s ball to Willey. 
Don’t say we don’t give you innuendo here.
 
11th over: India 61-3 (Dhoni 5, Kohli 26) target 351 10 overs done and it’s 
time for a change of bowling: Stokes is into the attack and a loose line is 
first punished, Yuvraj turning him off the pads for four to fine leg, then 
effective as an attempt at repeating the shot brings only a fine inside edge 
through to the keeper. England are on top now, although that’s a risky thing to 
say when you see who the next man in is. The former captain is under way with a 
nice wristy cut behind point for four.
