Bursaries/Scholarships A range of funds offered. The excellence scholarship is 
a cash award paid to students who attain at least ABB in their A-levels (or 
equivalent pre-entry qualifications), regardless of household income levels. 
The cash award, of up to £2,000 per year of study, is available to UK and EU 
students liable for the £9,000 tuition fee. Means-tested bursaries, as well as 
awards for care leavers and asylum seekers are also available. For updates and 
more information, visitkeele.ac.uk/undergraduatebursariesandscholarships

For international students, The Keele international student scholarship is an 
award of £2,000 deducted from the cost of the annual tuition fees for the 
duration of a course. Students studying a three-year degree can therefore save 
£6,000 from the total cost of their degree studies. For updates and more
