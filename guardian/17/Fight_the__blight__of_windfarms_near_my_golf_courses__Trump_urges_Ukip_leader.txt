The president-elect said he was “dismayed that his beloved Scotland has become 
overrun with ugly wind farms which he believes are a blight on the stunning 
landscape”, according to a member of the delegation that came with the UKIP 
leader, Nigel Farage, tomeet Trump on the first weekend after his shock 
election win

Andy Wigmore, the communications director for Leave.EU – the successful Brexit 
campaign led by Farage – said Trump urged the group, which included UKIP’s 
major donor Arron Banks, to campaign against the spread of windfarms inScotland

“He has a bugbear,” Wigmore said. “He doesn’t like windfarms at all. He said 
‘When I look out of my window and I see these windmills, it offends me. Nigel, 
Arron, Andy, you have got to do something about these windmills.’

“He said: ‘Let’s put them offshore, but why spoil the beautiful countryside.’ 
So he has asked us to campaign about getting rid of windfarms in the way they 
currently stand. I don’t want Scotland, the most beautiful country ever to be 
sullied by these awful windmills.”

Trump did not dispute the conversation during a meeting with New York Times 
staff on Tuesday, according to journalist Maggie Haberman.She tweeted:

Trump’s complex web of investments and potential conflicts of interest around 
the world are coming under increasing scrutiny. The president-elect is involved 
in at least 16 partnerships or corporations in India alone, the Washington Post 
reported, and he met withdevelopers from a project in India 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-towers-pune-india-investigations>
 even after winning the election.

The paper also noted that about 100 foreign diplomats gathered at Trump’s new 
luxury hotel in Washington, close to the White House, last weekend, apparently 
in the hope of earning his approbation.

On Monday his aides and a spokesperson for the Argentinian president, Mauricio 
Macri, wereforced to deny rumours that the pair discussed stalled permits for 
Trump buildings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/mauricio-macri-donald-trump-buenos-aires-office>
 when Macri called to congratulate him on the election result.

The New York Post’s editorial board wrote on Tuesday: “Of all the issues 
facing the president-elect and his brain trust, the question of how to avoid 
conflicts of interest with his global business may be the thorniest.”


Trump has stated that he will hand over management of the Trump Organization 
to his children but it was notable this his daughter Ivanka was present at a 
meeting with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe.

In his discussion with the New York Times, Trump seemed to shrug off the 
potential conflicts of interest. According to Haberman’s Twitter feed, he said: 
“The law’s totally on my side, the president can’t have a conflict of interest.”


He added: “In theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the 
country perfectly. There’s never been a case like this.”

In the UK, Trump has been involved in long-running rows over the impact of 
wind farms on his Scottish golf courses and in Decemberlost a supreme court 
battle

 against an experimental offshore array being built in the North Sea several 
miles off his links course in Aberdeenshire.

His comments about windfarms suggest he may be ready to reignite the dispute 
from the White House and have raised concerns they may strengthen a renewed 
lobbying effort in Britain against wind energy. They follow Trump’s campaign 
threatto abandon the international Paris climate change agreement

.


“Politics should not determine the future of our energy mix,” said Emma 
Pinchbeck, executive director of Renewable UK which represents the windfarm 
industry. “Offshore wind is massively popular – 75% of people in the UK support 
it. It’s also a vital part of our modern energy system and it’s playing a key 
role in Britain’s industrial success, both here and abroad.”

She said “a populist politician might want to back technologies with public 
support and which offer good value to the taxpayer”.

Vattenfall, the Swedish energy company which runs the Aberdeenshire array, has 
already begun onshore construction work less than five miles south of Trump’s 
resort. It is co-funded by the European Union and the Scottish government and 
foundations for the first turbines are expected to be installed later next 
year, with turbines generating power from summer 2018.

A spokesman for Vattenfall said: “We’re pressing ahead because we believe that 
that way is substantially closed. We don’t think there’s any further 
opportunity for anyone to bring a legal challenge. I’m not a legal expert but 
that’s the advice we’ve received.”
