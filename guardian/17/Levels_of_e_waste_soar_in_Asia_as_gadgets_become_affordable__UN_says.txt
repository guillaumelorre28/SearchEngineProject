Levels of electronic waste are rising sharply across Asia, as higher incomes 
mean hundreds of millions of people can afford smartphones and other gadgets, 
according to a UN study.

The amount of e-waste in Asia has risen by 63% in five years, a report by 
United Nations University said, warning of the need toimprove recycling and

 across the region to prevent serious environmental and health consequences.

Ruediger Kuehr, the report’s co-author and head of UNU’s sustainable cycles 
programme, said: “For many countries that already lack infrastructure for 
environmentally sound e-waste management, the increasing volumes are a cause 
for concern.”

For many years, China and other Asian countries have recycled discarded 
electronics from wealthier countries

 in rudimentary and often unsafe factories.

But the report said Asia has become a major source of e-waste due to 
increasingly affluent consumers buying electronic items including phones, 
tablets, refrigerators, computers and televisions.

China’s generation of e-waste

 more than doubled between 2010 and 2015, the period of the study, according to 
the report.

Hong Kong generated the highest amount of e-waste in Asia in 2015, an average 
of 21.7kg (3.4st) per person.

Singapore and Taiwan created just over 19kg per person in 2015.

Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines were among the lowest e-waste 
generators, with an average of about 1kg per person.
