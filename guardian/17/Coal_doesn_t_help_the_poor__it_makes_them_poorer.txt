A dozen international poverty and development organizations published a report 
<https://www.odi.org/publications/10589-beyond-coal-scaling-clean-energy-fight-global-poverty>
 last week on the impact of building new coal power plants in countries where a 
large percentage of the population lacks access to electricity. The report’s 
conclusions are strikingly counter-intuitive: on the whole, building coal power 
plants does little to help the poor, and often it can actually make them poorer.

Delivering electricity to those in energy poverty is certainly important. For 
example,household air pollution killed 4.3 million people 
<http://www.who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/HAP_BoD_results_March2014.pdf?ua=1)>
 globally in 2012; many of those lives could be saved and health improved with 
the use of electric stoves to replace burning wood or charcoal. However, the 
question remains whether coal is the best way to deliver that electricity.

More coal doesn’t help people living close to the grid

The report notes that approximately 15% of people in energy poverty live close 
to existing electric grids, but there are a variety of barriers blocking their 
connection. For example, the poor consume relatively little electricity, so the 
costs of connecting them may exceed the resulting profits. The power lines used 
to connect them also result in high energy losses and power system instability. 
The poor also have little political influence in many developing countries. As 
the report concludes:

This means that for energy-poor families living close to the grid, building 
new power generation capacity – coalfiredor otherwise – will not help them get 
connected.Instead, access will require financing the upfront costs of new 
connections, and rationalising tariffs to reflect the truecosts of supplying 
power.

More coal also doesn’t help people in rural areas

Approximately 84% of energy-poor households live in rural areas further away 
from the grid. For this group, decentralized stand-alone and mini-grid 
solutions are much quicker than waiting to build a new centralized power plant 
and distribution lines. A single power plant can take a decade between planning 
and ultimate completion, while distributed wind turbines or solar panels can be 
deployed much more rapidly, as Elon Musk explained in ‘Before the Flood’:

In fact, most planned coal development isn’t aimed at delivering electricity 
to the poor. It’s mostly targeted toward industrialized areas in China, which 
already have high levels of access to electricity. In India, many areas with 
the densest concentration of coal plants also have the lowest rates of 
electricity access.

New coal plants aren’t built for the poor because it’s not profitable.

China dramatically reduced poverty, but coal played only a small role

There’s a common misconception that China’s coal power expansion lifted much 
of its population out of poverty. For example,according to Bjorn Lomborg 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/opinion/the-poor-need-cheap-fossil-fuels.html>
:

Over the last 30 years, China moved an estimated 680 million people out of 
poverty by giving them access to modern energy, mostly powered by coal.

However, as this new report notes, about two-thirds of China’s reduction in 
extreme poverty occurred in the 1980s, before its dramatic expansion of coal 
power starting in the 1990s.

More importantly, China enacted agricultural reform, which helped the 
profitability of small farms. China’s hard push towards industrialization did 
rely on coal power, but it only happened after the agricultural reforms had 
lifted most of its population out of extreme poverty.

Burning coal causes air, water, and carbon pollution

China’s air pollution problems are an example of the consequences of relying 
too heavily on burning coal for generating electricity. The report notes that 
sickness and death caused by air pollution currently costs China an estimated 
9.7% to 13.2% of its GDP annually. It currently causes some 670,000 premature 
deaths a year in China and 100,000 in India.Coal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal> also requires substantial 
amounts of freshwater for operation:

The coal industry withdraws, consumes and pollutes substantial quantities of 
freshwater, oftencompeting for limited water resources with other sectors, such 
as smallholder agriculture, that are crucial for povertyreduction. Roughly 44% 
of existing and planned coalplants are located in areas with high to extremely 
highwater stress.  A quarter are located in ‘red-listed’ areas, where surface 
and groundwater resources are at risk ofdrying up because water is being 
withdrawn faster than itcan be replenished … Coal plants’ direct competition 
with poor farmersfor scarce water resources has already led to political 
tensions and social unrest.

And of course the more coal we burn, the more global warming will result. 
Poorer countries tend to be the most vulnerable 
<http://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=15> to the impacts of climate 
change. As the report notes:

By 2050, climate change impacts could draw an estimated 720 million people 
into extreme poverty(Granoff et al., 2015). This is about the same number 
lifted out of extreme poverty in the last two decades andwould thus cancel out 
much of the progress made inpoverty eradication to date … Coal expansion as 
currently planned is enough topush climate change to catastrophic levels. A 
changingclimate already disproportionately hits the poorest people with least 
resources to enable them to adapt.

Wind and solar are already becoming cheaper than coal

Not only are wind and solar better for the poor in terms of ease of 
deployment, clean air, and slowing climate change, they’ve also become 
cost-competitive.

South Africa, for example, is the cheapest place in Africa to generate 
coal-fired power, yet electricity from its new 4.7gigawatt Medupi advanced coal 
plant willcost ... 17% more than the electricity generated from South Africa’s 2
gigawatt of new onshore wind power. In India, the minister responsible for 
power development recently stated: ‘I thinka new coal plant would give you 
costlier power than a solarplant’ (Climate Home, 2016). The statement is 
supported bythe extremely low bid prices for recent solar procurements in India 
(Kenning, 2015). Renewable energy investment in the emerging world now outpaces 
that in developed countries(McGrath, 2016).

Renewable energy also has low operating cost and zero fuel cost, while fossil 
fuel costs are variable and susceptible to price spikes. And renewable energy 
creates more (and safer) jobs than coal.

Coal companies and their allies often argue that we need to burn their 
products to lift the poor out of poverty. For example,Matt Ridley has claimed 
<http://www.thegwpf.com/matt-ridley-africa-needs-to-be-rich-rather-than-green/>:

those who advocate no support for coal are effectively saying that the 
adoption of renewable energy is more important than alleviating African poverty

In reality, there are better, faster, cleaner alternatives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/12/global-warming-energy-intertwined-africa>
 to help deliver electricity to the energy-poor. Those who argue to the 
contrary often do so to advance their own agendas.
