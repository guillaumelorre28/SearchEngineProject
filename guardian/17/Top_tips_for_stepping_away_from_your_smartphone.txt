It can be a struggle for all of us to power down, recharge the batteries, and 
plug back into our family lives. The main way of achieving this in our “always 
on” culture is to get away from the devices that can hog our attention a tad 
too much. David Lloyd Clubs know the sure signs that you need to take a break 
from your smartphone…

1. Tap of the morning to you:
The first thing you do when you wake up in the morning is reach for the phone. 
You’re not alone in this:research has found that as many as 70% of us 
<http://minutehack.com/news/two-thirds-check-smartphones-before-getting-out-of-bed>
 are tapping away on our phone within the first 15 minutes of waking up. Ask 
yourself this: how long do you spend in bed in the morning flicking through 
your phone? Could that time be used for having breakfast or going for a swim?

2. Flushpoint:
You bring your phone with you into the bathroom, or you check your phone 
sitting on the toilet.Apparently, 26% of us do this [PDF] 
<https://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/media/1132/from-reading-to-flirting-nation-of-multi-taskers-making-the-most-of-train-journeys.pdf>
. And after reading this, 100% of us will never borrow a phone again.

3. Locked-in:
All of the spare few minutes you get during your day involve your phone. The 
average iPhone user unlocks their phone 80 times per day 
<http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-average-iphone-is-unlocked-80-times-per-day-2016-4?_ga=1.159542522.630383624.1455728630?r=US&IR=T>
, according to one study. That means that over a 12-hour day, users check their 
phones between six and seven times an hour, or roughly every 10 minutes. If 
you’re the competitive type at work or play, you could always test your metal 
to get that ‘unlock’ statistic down to half or even lower.

4. Take Barack your ‘you’ time:
You have invested time and money in your health and wellbeing – but it also 
includes screen time (phones in the gym or at a spa being the prime examples). 
It might be smart to take a lesson from Barack Obama who fits in a 45-minute, 
uninterrupted exercise session up to six times a week. “He values his workout 
time as time to think and relieve stress,”an aide said about the US president’s 
routine

. If he can go without his phone for a block of time in his day, all of us can.

5. oWPhone: 
You’ve injured yourself while distractedly checking your phone. One in 10 of us
 
<https://www.national-accident-helpline.co.uk/about-us/news/press/how-accident-prone-are-you>
 has walked into something because we were texting,while 60% 
<https://www.national-accident-helpline.co.uk/about-us/news/press/how-accident-prone-are-you>
 of people have dropped their phone on their face when using it while lying 
down.

6. FOMO-sapiens:
You find yourself in a constant state of anxiety that everyone else is living 
a better life than you, going by the seemingly fabulous pictures and check-ins 
friends and colleagues are posting on social media. This is the very modern 
condition FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). There’s one known cure for this: meeting 
up with those important to you and doing something together in real life. Just 
don’t spend all your time during that activity “capturing the moment” on your 
phone.

7. Chew it over:
You and all your family check your phones throughout dinner. Here’s a 
suggestion 
<http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-hot-button/you-have-2-new-text-messages-also-youre-paying-for-dinner/article2296118/>
: at the start of a meal, pile all your phones, face down, in the middle of the 
table. The first one to check their device has to do all the washing-up.

8. Group-off:
You’re a member of more than three different WhatsApp groups. Also, if you 
have a family/house-share WhatsApp group, and you message one another while you 
are all at home rather than speaking, then it might be time to step away from 
the phone.

9. Bed down:
You check your smartphone during sex. Yes, this is happening now 
<http://metro.co.uk/2016/05/13/one-in-ten-people-are-rude-enough-to-check-their-phones-during-sex-5879512/>
. Is nothing sacred?
