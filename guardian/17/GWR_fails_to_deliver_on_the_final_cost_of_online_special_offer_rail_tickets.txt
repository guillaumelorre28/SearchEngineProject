I tried to buy a senior open return ticket from Bath Spa to Paddington using 
the Great Western Rail website. The fare was advertised at £24, but a further 
£6 was automatically added at checkout for special delivery mailing without the 
usual option of collecting the ticket from the station.

Customer services initially told me there was a fault on the website, and then 
that ticket machines and ticket office computers at stations did not recognise 
the codes for these tickets so they had to be posted.

In the end I went to the station and bought the same ticket for the same 
price. Going online today I find that, more than two weeks later, the issue is 
still there – and there is still no warning advising customers of it.STB, Bath

GWR explains that the ticket you were trying to buy was a discounted offer 
available until December and says that the web page promoting the deal makes 
clear that if you book more than five days before the date of travel, tickets 
are posted for free by second class post, whereas if you are travelling 
imminently the system defaults to the £6 special delivery. Otherwise, you can 
buy them on the day from the station but, exasperatingly, you cannot collect 
pre-paid tickets from there if they are part of the discounted deal.

Obviously, it would be helpful if these facts were repeated on the payment 
page. GWR says it’s “investigating being able to make subsequent offers 
available for collection through vending machines or as e-tickets”.

In the meantime, anyone tempted by the offer of 60% off had better make sure 
they book online a week in advance or get to the station good and early on the 
day to buy their ticket.
