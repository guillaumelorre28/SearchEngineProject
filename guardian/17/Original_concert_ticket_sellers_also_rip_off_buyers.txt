Once again the problem with secondary ticket prices is being “investigated” (
Ticket resale sites face inquiry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/19/ticket-resale-sites-new-scrutiny-touting-seatwave-viagogo>
, 20 December). Though laudable, why not take this a step further and 
investigate the ripping off of ticket buyers by the original ticket sellers. 
The upfront advertised price of tickets is nowhere near what you actually pay. 
Booking fees, handling charges, postage, etc can add quite a lot to the cost of 
each ticket.

How can companies justify booking fees of say £8 on a £50 ticket? Then they 
charge you £2.50 postage for something that arrives by second-class mail. 
The worst example of this I have come across was a ticket to see Graham Nash 
last summer. The ticket had a face value of £35. On top of this, you were 
charged a booking fee, a handling charge and a “facility fee”. Total cost was 
£48. A 40% mark up.

Large stadium concerts are just a licence to print money for these companies. 
Buying eight tickets for a stadium gig can easily cost you an extra £100 in 
fees. A few years ago, a reunion tour allegedly sold 200,000 tickets for three 
concerts in 60 minutes. With booking fees etc that was £1.5m into the coffers 
of the ticket sellers in an hour.

There should be a reasonable flat fee for each ticket sold, and the price 
advertised should be the price you pay including the fee. The Competition and 
Markets Authority should be looking into how the original purchaser of tickets 
is being exploited by these companies alongside any investigation into resale 
websites.
