Cycling in the city: Detroit's problems pedal change

Nick Van Mead

I didn’t know what to expect turning up in Detroit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/detroit> to write about American cities 
trying to find alternatives to the car recently, beyond the cliches of blight 
and abandonment.

America’s road trip: will the US ever kick the car habit?
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/nov/02/america-road-trip-us-car-habit-detroit-houston-los-angeles>
Those things are undeniable – and hit you as soon as you enter the city – but 
what I hadn’t expected was how they could lead to something positive.

Van Mead 
A contact suggested I have a look at the deprived Chalmers neighbourhood of 
east Detroit, so I borrowed a bike and headed over. The tyre shop, the chicken 
place, the beauty salon … more than half the high street stores along that 
section of Jefferson Avenue were boarded up; some optimistically offered as 
“development opportunities”. A glance at the residential streets behind 
revealed row upon row of vacant lots.

Pimp my bike: Detroit's custom cycles – in pictures
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2016/nov/02/pimp-my-bike-detroit-custom-cycles-slow-ride-in-pictures>
But Chalmers also had a few hundred yards of something new in the City of 
Detroit and rare in the United States – a protected bike lane.


I poked around a bit, then pedalled east across the invisible line into the 
wealthy suburb of Grosse Pointe. The poverty stopped abruptly … but so did the 
safe space for cyclists.


That was the point when it hit me that Detroit’s problems had created 
something most cities don’t have – and wish they did – space. Ironically, I 
didn’t have room to include it in the finished article.

'Fat letter' sent by schools: food for thought?

Rebecca Ratcliffe

Getting a letter through the post saying your child is obese is never going to 
be a comfortable experience. Weight is a sensitive subject, and noone wants to 
feel their parenting style is being criticised. But, given that one in five 
children now leave primary school obese, do local authorities have a duty to 
warn parents?

The comments below the line on this piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/state-sometimes-wiser-than-parents>
 are an interesting read, includingthis from Pepperthecat 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86960217>


“I don’t actually know of any evidence the this ‘letter to parents’ 
intervention is an effective one (e.g. do kids getting letters have a lower 
incidence of obesity later on in life than a control group who have not 
received them?) Has it ever been tested properly ie in a randomised trial? If 
not, it is quite possible that it has no benefit, or is even harmful!


If the government were serious about childhood obesity they would focus on 
proven interventions at a population level, such as banning junk food 
advertising, heavy taxes on sugary drinks and the like.”

What are your thoughts?

9/10 on the false news quizz. I didn't pay strict attention to how ill Hillary 
was when walking to her SUV.

Have a go yourself here:

10/10 - although I would have fallen for the last one if I hadn't already read 
that it was false somewhere else.

Epic love story

Stuart Heritage

It’s sweet, in a way, that Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher had an affair on 
the set of Star Wars. After all, they played two of the most iconic characters 
in movie history, so in a way it’s a bit like hearing that Michael J Fox and 
Christopher Lloyd got it on during the Back to the Future wrap party. It’s 
sweet. But let’s not read too much into any of this. It was a fleeting thing, 
and it’s over now. And thank goodness for that – if Episode VII taught us 
anything at all, it’s that a Ford/Fisher pregnancy can only ever end badly.

Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford: does it matter if movie romances are real?

all foretold a scary amount of stuff that actually came to pass, but there was 
a lot we didn’t have room to get into the magazine. Driverless cars – like 
those pootling about inTotal Recall 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGi6j2VrL0o> (only without the creepy-as-hell 
robotic driver) and Demolition Man – are here; Star Trek’s replicators inch 
ever closer with each advancement made in 3D printing; and the virtual reality 
ofThe Lawnmower Man <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCxFGxqLsHE> and Red Dwarf 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ANUIr50ts> is now within reach of anyone 
willing to fork out a grand or so

But, after we also talked about cryonics earlier what other cases are there of 
science fiction becoming everyday fact? And are there any instances where 
sci-fi predictions missed the mark?

A lot of you have some LONG commutes!

For a few years my commute was bout 4 hours a day (2 either way). I didn't 
really mind it at the time, as I just slept on the way up and the journey on 
the way back was a good length of time to read, watch videos etc, without too 
much disruption. I ultimately gave it up though as I was needing to work longer 
and longer hours and a 4 hour commute on top of that isn't sustainable.

It was only when I gave it up did I realise how completely knackered I had 
felt the whole time. That seemed normal to me, and it was only in not feeling 
that way did I realise how unhealthy it probably was. I'd never go back to 
doing that as a result, unless things were absolutely dire (and given that the 
route in question is operated by Southern, it would have to be really,really 
dire to do that commute again).

My husband has a 2 and a quarter hour commute each way, from Gloucestershire 
to Canary Wharf, three days a week. He goes by train so his strategy is to 
sleep on the way in, mop up emails and doze on the way home.
Our next door neighbour is often on the same trains and I know at least four 
others that do it on a regular basis

A post-truth year?

Further to that false news quiz (see here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/nov/18/would-you-want-your-body-frozen-after-death-join-our-live-look-at-the-week?page=with:block-582f03e4e4b090fc8128280b#block-582f03e4e4b090fc8128280b>
) we were interested to spot this week’s announcement of the Oxford 
Dictionaries’ word of the year ... We’ll let the Guardian’s Instagram feed 
explain:


Oxford Dictionaries has declared 'post-truth' to be its international word of 
the year. The use of the term has increased by around 2,000% in 2016 compared 
to last year. Oxford Dictionaries explains that this is in the context of 
Brexit and the US presidential election. Last year's word of the year was - try 
to keep a straight face -the ‘Tears of Joy' emoji: 😂

What do you make of the concept, and the phrase?

And here’s a response to the quiz

Oh, the embarrassment. I actually fell for two of those ten stories in the 
quiz. Goes to show, nobody is immune to the pernicious effects of this 
propaganda. (Most of it isn't satire--it's propaganda. Learn the difference.)

Cats + the internet work so well because in real life they're so full of 
contempt for humans and so aloof (my own cat only thinks of me as a reasonably 
efficient food dispenser AT BEST) that capturing them unawares on camera 
looking daft is very rewarding, much more so than dogs because you get the 
feeling dogs would be so happy that a picture of them looking silly made you 
happy. A new cat gallery everyday please or maybe a rolling liveblog. Thanks in 
advance.

Your daily commute

Sarah Marsh

The number of workers who commute daily for two hours or more has increased by 
a third in five years, a study shows. Why? Research finds stagnant wages and 
soaring housing costs mean people are forced to get jobs further from home. I 
am keen to hear from readers who regularly spend a good few hours en route to 
the workplace. How do you cope? Do you love it? What are your favourite 
commuting activities? Have you learnt any valuable rules of travel?

Cats on the internet – a cliché made in heaven?

Matthew Holmes

I don’t quite “get” the obsession with talking about how cats on the internet 
are a perfect match. But sometimes you just have to roll with it.

I didn’t know what to expect turning up in Detroit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/detroit> to write about American cities 
trying to find alternatives to the car recently, beyond the cliches of blight 
and abandonment.

<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/nov/02/america-road-trip-us-car-habit-detroit-houston-los-angeles>
Those things are undeniable – and hit you as soon as you enter the city – but 
what I hadn’t expected was how they could lead to something positive.

A contact suggested I have a look at the deprived Chalmers neighbourhood of 
east Detroit, so I borrowed a bike and headed over. The tyre shop, the chicken 
place, the beauty salon … more than half the high street stores along that 
section of Jefferson Avenue were boarded up; some optimistically offered as 
“development opportunities”. A glance at the residential streets behind 
revealed row upon row of vacant lots.

<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2016/nov/02/pimp-my-bike-detroit-custom-cycles-slow-ride-in-pictures>
But Chalmers also had a few hundred yards of something new in the City of 
Detroit and rare in the United States – a protected bike lane.


I poked around a bit, then pedalled east across the invisible line into the 
wealthy suburb of Grosse Pointe. The poverty stopped abruptly … but so did the 
safe space for cyclists.


That was the point when it hit me that Detroit’s problems had created 
something most cities don’t have – and wish they did – space. Ironically, I 
didn’t have room to include it in the finished article.
 
Getting a letter through the post saying your child is obese is never going to 
be a comfortable experience. Weight is a sensitive subject, and noone wants to 
feel their parenting style is being criticised. But, given that one in five 
children now leave primary school obese, do local authorities have a duty to 
warn parents?

The comments below the line on this piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/state-sometimes-wiser-than-parents>
 are an interesting read, includingthis from Pepperthecat 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86960217>


“I don’t actually know of any evidence the this ‘letter to parents’ 
intervention is an effective one (e.g. do kids getting letters have a lower 
incidence of obesity later on in life than a control group who have not 
received them?) Has it ever been tested properly ie in a randomised trial? If 
not, it is quite possible that it has no benefit, or is even harmful!


If the government were serious about childhood obesity they would focus on 
proven interventions at a population level, such as banning junk food 
advertising, heavy taxes on sugary drinks and the like.”

What are your thoughts?

10/10 - although I would have fallen for the last one if I hadn't already read 
that it was false somewhere else.
 
It’s sweet, in a way, that Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher had an affair on 
the set of Star Wars. After all, they played two of the most iconic characters 
in movie history, so in a way it’s a bit like hearing that Michael J Fox and 
Christopher Lloyd got it on during the Back to the Future wrap party. It’s 
sweet. But let’s not read too much into any of this. It was a fleeting thing, 
and it’s over now. And thank goodness for that – if Episode VII taught us 
anything at all, it’s that a Ford/Fisher pregnancy can only ever end badly.

But, after we also talked about cryonics earlier what other cases are there of 
science fiction becoming everyday fact? And are there any instances where 
sci-fi predictions missed the mark?

For a few years my commute was bout 4 hours a day (2 either way). I didn't 
really mind it at the time, as I just slept on the way up and the journey on 
the way back was a good length of time to read, watch videos etc, without too 
much disruption. I ultimately gave it up though as I was needing to work longer 
and longer hours and a 4 hour commute on top of that isn't sustainable.

It was only when I gave it up did I realise how completely knackered I had 
felt the whole time. That seemed normal to me, and it was only in not feeling 
that way did I realise how unhealthy it probably was. I'd never go back to 
doing that as a result, unless things were absolutely dire (and given that the 
route in question is operated by Southern, it would have to be really,really 
dire to do that commute again).

My husband has a 2 and a quarter hour commute each way, from Gloucestershire 
to Canary Wharf, three days a week. He goes by train so his strategy is to 
sleep on the way in, mop up emails and doze on the way home.
Our next door neighbour is often on the same trains and I know at least four 
others that do it on a regular basis

) we were interested to spot this week’s announcement of the Oxford 
Dictionaries’ word of the year ... We’ll let the Guardian’s Instagram feed 
explain:


Oxford Dictionaries has declared 'post-truth' to be its international word of 
the year. The use of the term has increased by around 2,000% in 2016 compared 
to last year. Oxford Dictionaries explains that this is in the context of 
Brexit and the US presidential election. Last year's word of the year was - try 
to keep a straight face -the ‘Tears of Joy' emoji: 😂

Cats + the internet work so well because in real life they're so full of 
contempt for humans and so aloof (my own cat only thinks of me as a reasonably 
efficient food dispenser AT BEST) that capturing them unawares on camera 
looking daft is very rewarding, much more so than dogs because you get the 
feeling dogs would be so happy that a picture of them looking silly made you 
happy. A new cat gallery everyday please or maybe a rolling liveblog. Thanks in 
advance.
