their beaks smashed but were left alive in an apparent act of animal cruelty, 
the RSPCA says.

NSW police are investigating the attacks on the protected native birds, which 
were found at The Entrance and taken to a vet but had to be euthanised.

“While we are not sure if this has been caused by a malicious attack or 
unfortunate natural circumstances at this point, it does look very suspicious,” 
RSPCA inspector Graeme Dymond said. “It’s sickening to see gruesome injuries 
like these inflicted on such beautiful birds.”
