Pakistan draw level in ODI series

Jonathan Howcroft

It’s been a difficult tour for Pakistan but pride was salvaged at the MCG.

The match was won and lost in the afternoon when Australia threw wickets away 
cheaply to set a gettable total. That Pakistan reached it for the loss of just 
four wickets owed plenty to captain Mohammad Hafeez and veteran Shoaib Malik 
who anchored each end of the chase.

Pakistan’s win leaves the series poised at 1-1 with the third leg in Perth on 
Thursday.

As you’d expect, we’ll be here to bring you all the action. For now though, 
here’s Adam Collins’ match report from the ‘G:

Pakistan salvage some pride as Australia are cut down to size in second ODI

Pakistan win by six wickets

48th over: Pakistan 221-4 (Malik 42, Akmal 18) - Target 221

The pace of Head and Faulkner’s overs makes you think Smith’s just put this 
pair on to repair his over-rate. Akmal eventually connects with a couple of 
Head’s pies, a pair of fours to tie the scores.

The field comes up to crowd the bat... and Head chucks a rancid wide down the 
leg-side. An ignominious end to an historic victory for Pakistan over Australia 
at the MCG.

47th over: Pakistan 212-4 (Malik 42, Akmal 10) - Target 221

Umar Akmal really swings from the hips but his timing needs some work. 
Faulkner’s changes of pace continue to bamboozle both batsmen and he concedes 
just one run to extend play a few minutes further.

went for 11, but his second just three as Pakistan navigate a potential banana

Faulkner, Australia’s best tonight, has another dart but he’s fodder for Akmal 
this close to victory. The Pakistan number six smites a four with a free swing 
of the bat sending the ball back over the bowler’s head.

Marsh continuing his spell but Pakistan are refusing to go into their shells. 
Akmal gets off the mark with a crisp square drive on his tiptoes, and then 
Malik crunches a pull for four to midwicket to take his country beyond 200.

43rd over: Pakistan 195-4 (Malik 32, Akmal 0) - Target 221

Shafiq won’t be there at the end after he played at one he’ll regret even 
thinking about attacking. Umar Akmal almost joined him a ball later but a Starc 
thunderbolt just whistled past - and not into - his stumps.

Pakistan need 26 off 42.

WICKET! Shafiq c Wade b Starc 13 (Pakistan 195-4)

Starc strikes in his final over. Shafiq chases a full wide one but doesn’t 
connect well enough and Wade pouches a regulation catch.

42nd over: Pakistan 191-3 (Shafiq 12, Malik 32) - Target 221

Marsh, recalled to the Australian Test side, hasn’t done his international 
reputation much good today. A golden duck with the bat and now wicketless with 
the ball. An innocuous over passes with little incident.

Sahib Rahman has emailed in. “Hello,” he writes. Hello Sahib.
Dan Liebke (@LiebCricket) 
“Back live,” says Tubby, in case we were unable to tell the difference between 
the bowling of Mitchell Marsh and Wasim Akram.

41st over: Pakistan 187-3 (Shafiq 11, Malik 31) - Target 221

Last roll of the dice from Smith, bringing Starc back. His main weapon has 
just two overs remaining.

The change fails to work though with Shafiq and Malik looking composed at the 
crease, working the straight deliveries into gaps and not chasing the wider 
ones.
Daniel Brettig (@danbrettig) 
This has been a good pitch for spin bowling. Pakistan made most of it, then 
jumped on Travis Head to ensure Smith didn't#AUSvPAK

40th over: Pakistan 183-3 (Shafiq 8, Malik 30) - Target 221

Mitch Marsh back into the attack and he begins with a loosener, short and wide 
and slapped behind point for four. Malik betters his own work a few deliveries 
later, presenting the full face of the bat to a ball that races away beyond 
Marsh’s follow through for four more.

After that wobble 10-overs or so ago, Pakistan are back in the groove.

MCG scoreboard not replaying that Hazlewood LBW appeal.
But I've seen the fans dressed as the Mario brothers a few dozen times.

39th over: Pakistan 175-3 (Shafiq 8, Malik 22) - Target 221

Hazlewood has a big LBW shout turned down but has no review to play with. DRS 
indicated an Umpire’s Call so that review wouldn’t have benefited Australia 
anyway.

Just two singles from the over, Hazlewood’s last. He finishes with 0/31 from 
his ten.

Pakistan require 46 from 66 - still theirs to lose. The required run rate 
hasn’t gone above 5rpo all night.

38th over: Pakistan 173-3 (Shafiq 7, Malik 21) - Target 221

Malik survives his second REVIEW in quick succession. This time it was 
Australia’s call after Cummins thundered one into the batsman’s pads but it was 
bouncing over the stumps.

After that scare it turns into a good over for Pakistan with both batsmen 
piercing gaps and collecting a series of ones and twos.

Malik is taking control for Pakistan, looking for boundaries, running hard, 
putting the pressure back on Australia.

37th over: Pakistan 166-3 (Shafiq 3, Malik 18) - Target 221

Shafiq can’t get away and in his desperation he almost pulls Hazlewood 
straight to short midwicket, then survives a leading edge that falls just short 
of cover, AND a run-out opportunity that would have been touch and go had the 
Australian fielder hit the stumps.

Hold my Gatorade, says Malik. One clean elegant flowing swing of the bat sends 
the ball arcing over the bowler’s head for six. What a shot to unfurl at this 
stage in proceedings.

This game has come to the boil beautifully.

36th over: Pakistan 159-3 (Shafiq 2, Malik 12) - Target 221

A rasping square drive from the crease from the opening delivery of Cummins’ 
over releases the pressure on Malik. But the pressure ramps up the next 
delivery as Malik is given out caught behind by umpire Gaffaney but the batsman
REVIEWSand is reprieved with nothing showing on hot spot or snicko. 

The atmosphere has lifted inside the MCG and the tension is mounting. 
Australia can smell blood but can they make the kill?

35th over: Pakistan 152-3 (Shafiq 2, Malik 6) - Target 221

Smith goes back to Hazlewood who concedes just one run bowling full and 
straight at Malik. Pakistan understandably regrouping, but this pair can’t 
dally too long.

34th over: Pakistan 151-3 (Shafiq 2, Malik 5) - Target 221

Cummins replaces the excellent Faulkner and he almost nabs another! A quick 
length delivery finds the edge of Malik’s bat but it dies just short of the 
first of two slips, and to add insult to injury Marsh is unable to deny the 
boundary.

70 required from 96.

Out of nowhere every delivery now looks like taking a wicket. Starc’s pace and 
angle from over the wicket is giving the new batsmen all sorts of problems.

Come on Pakistan. You know I appreciate a quality hilarious collapse but you 
really need to come up with some fresh material.#AUSvPAK

WICKET! Hafeez c Hazlewood b Faulkner 72 (Pakistan 142-3)

Oh dear, Pakistan, what are you doing!? Hafeez throws his wicket away after 
all that hard work, slogging Faulkner across the line and spooning a catch to 
mid-on. Faulkner’s changes of pace doing the trick but what an unnecessarily 
rash shot from the Pakistan captain.

31st over: Pakistan 140-2 (Hafeez 71, 0) - Target 221

Hafeez and Babar put on 72 in 16 overs, and they were starting to put their 
foot on the accelerator before that dismissal. Can Australia capitalise?

WICKET! Babar c Hazlewood b Starc 34 (Pakistan 140-2)

Just as Pakistan were beginning to open their shoulders Australia jag one 
back. Babar timed a superb ramp shot off Starc but it doesn’t clear Hazlewood 
on the third-man fence.

30th over: Pakistan 131-1 (Hafeez 66, Babar 30) - Target 221

Faulkner has looked the most likely for Australia and again his changes of 
pace and cutters take Hafeez out of his comfort zone. Babar’s much more 
comfortable, nailing a stylish boundary through the covers to keep up the 
momentum.

Phil Withall is following the action. “Evening Jonathan. I confess that 
listening to the commentators struggling to suggest a delivery the bowlers 
could make to take a wicket is splendid entertainment. Constantly state the 
obvious, talk up every dot ball and the bowlers potential. I’m looking forward 
to them covering Trump’s inauguration next week.”

I’m not looking forward to anything about that particular event.

29th over: Pakistan 130-1 (Hafeez 65, Babar 30) - Target 221

Expensive over for Australia and Mitchell Starc. Fours are conceded in the air 
over the vacant cordon and through point at catchable height. There’s leaky 
leg-side runs in amongst that too as Starc alternates over and around the 
wicket with no success.

28th over: Pakistan 116-1 (Hafeez 58, Babar 23) - Target 221

Faulkner and his lucky dip left-armers return to the attack, prompting 
questions from commentators about the lack of a frontline spinner in 
Australia’s XI.

Those conversations are curtailed abruptly as Cummins almost takes a screamer. 
Stationed at a deeper than regulation extra-cover Cummins leaped high in the 
air and got his fingertips to a lofted drive from Hafeez but couldn’t return to 
earth with the catch. That was so close to a highlight-reel staple.

27th over: Pakistan 111-1 (Hafeez 55, Babar 22) - Target 221

Starc working up a head of steam but it’s being met in kind by Babar. The 
batsman thinks he has a certain four but his cover drive right off the screws 
is fielded superbly by Head. A loose drive is then slashed away to third-man 
but well away from the solitary slip.

26th over: Pakistan 109-1 (Hafeez 54, Babar 21) - Target 221

Cummins continues his toil and it’s not a pretty over. Babar feasts on some 
rare length with a confident pull after Hafeez milked a three off his pads.

Back to a procession again for Pakistan after a shaky spell.

25th over: Pakistan 101-1 (Hafeez 51, Babar 16) - Target 221

Starc returns as Smith continues his quest for wickets but Hafeez is ready and 
waiting, tucking one off his pads for four to bring up his 50 and Pakistan’s 
100.

It’s not been the most elegant knock, what with being dropped on none and 
rattled on his helmet and fingers repeatedly, but it’s been a valuable one for 
his country nonetheless.

At the halfway mark of their chase, Pakistan require 120 runs from 150 balls.

24th over: Pakistan 97-1 (Hafeez 47, Babar 16) - Target 221

Smith’s stationed a catcher at short mid-on for Cummins but it doesn’t phase 
Babar who drives forcefully just on the other side of the strip. Pakistan 
expertly turn three into two with some laboured running. They’ve probably left 
five to ten runs out there already in this chase because of sloppy running 
between the wickets.

23rd over: Pakistan 92-1 (Hafeez 46, Babar 12) - Target 221

The running repairs continue for Hafeez but he’s toughing it out. And he’ll be 
delighted with what he sees from the non-striker’s end as Babar times one 
beautifully off Hazlewood and through midwicket for four.

This partnership far from fluent though, just 24-runs from nearly nine overs.

22nd over: Pakistan 87-1 (Hafeez 45, Babar 8) - Target 221

It won’t be Marsh, it will be the returning Cummins, but the effect is 
similar, heavy, length balls that climb on the Pakistan skipper. Hafeez again 
escapes after the ball smashes into his helmet, this time coming off the 
shoulder of his bat as he flinched at one that rears at him.

Just one from the over. Australia putting the breaks on Pakistan’s chase.

21st over: Pakistan 86-1 (Hafeez 44, Babar 8) - Target 221

Hazlewood probing but Pakistan have largely batted sensibly, in the ‘V’, and 
from the crease, denying him any cheap wickets. Moreover, the lack of swing or 
seam has prevented him for forcing any. He earns a maiden, now can Marsh join 
those dots with a ‘W’?

20th over: Pakistan 86-1 (Hafeez 44, Babar 8) - Target 221

Marsh continues his spell with his strong action and high arm. Again he rushes 
one through Hafeez who is late on a pull and wears one on his grille. The 
second time the Pakistan skipper has been struck on his lid this knock, not to 
mention the damaged finger.

19th over: Pakistan 82-1 (Hafeez 44, Babar 5) - Target 221

Smith knows he has to go for wickets so he returns to one of his main men in 
Hazlewood. His tight line and length fails to jag another wicket.

18th over: Pakistan 81-1 (Hafeez 43, Babar 1) - Target 221

Babar finally off the mark after nine deliveries. That precedes a delay in 
play as Marsh wraps Hafeez on the tip of his right index finger, drawing blood. 
The bowler extracted some extra, unexpected bounce, and it caught Hafeez a 
nasty blow.

Unperturbed, Hafeez caresses an off-drive for three after the restart. Babar 
responds with an even better shot, high elbow, straight blade, the ball racing 
past the non-striker for four stylish runs. Good cricket.

It’s been a difficult tour for Pakistan but pride was salvaged at the MCG.

The match was won and lost in the afternoon when Australia threw wickets away 
cheaply to set a gettable total. That Pakistan reached it for the loss of just 
four wickets owed plenty to captain Mohammad Hafeez and veteran Shoaib Malik 
who anchored each end of the chase.

Pakistan’s win leaves the series poised at 1-1 with the third leg in Perth on 
Thursday.

As you’d expect, we’ll be here to bring you all the action. For now though, 
here’s Adam Collins’ match report from the ‘G:

48th over: Pakistan 221-4 (Malik 42, Akmal 18) - Target 221

The pace of Head and Faulkner’s overs makes you think Smith’s just put this 
pair on to repair his over-rate. Akmal eventually connects with a couple of 
Head’s pies, a pair of fours to tie the scores.

The field comes up to crowd the bat... and Head chucks a rancid wide down the 
leg-side. An ignominious end to an historic victory for Pakistan over Australia 
at the MCG.
 
47th over: Pakistan 212-4 (Malik 42, Akmal 10) - Target 221

Umar Akmal really swings from the hips but his timing needs some work. 
Faulkner’s changes of pace continue to bamboozle both batsmen and he concedes 
just one run to extend play a few minutes further.
 
46th over: Pakistan 211-4 (Malik 42, Akmal 9) - Target 221

Smith going for the Hail Mary, handing the ball to Travis Head. His first over 
went for 11, but his second just three as Pakistan navigate a potential banana 
skin.
 
45th over: Pakistan 208-4 (Malik 40, Akmal 8) - Target 221

Faulkner, Australia’s best tonight, has another dart but he’s fodder for Akmal 
this close to victory. The Pakistan number six smites a four with a free swing 
of the bat sending the ball back over the bowler’s head.

A reasonable BBL attendance today at a third-full MCG. 
 
44th over: Pakistan 203-4 (Malik 40, Akmal 3) - Target 221

Marsh continuing his spell but Pakistan are refusing to go into their shells. 
Akmal gets off the mark with a crisp square drive on his tiptoes, and then 
Malik crunches a pull for four to midwicket to take his country beyond 200.
 
43rd over: Pakistan 195-4 (Malik 32, Akmal 0) - Target 221

Shafiq won’t be there at the end after he played at one he’ll regret even 
thinking about attacking. Umar Akmal almost joined him a ball later but a Starc 
thunderbolt just whistled past - and not into - his stumps.

Pakistan need 26 off 42.
 
Starc strikes in his final over. Shafiq chases a full wide one but doesn’t 
connect well enough and Wade pouches a regulation catch.
 
42nd over: Pakistan 191-3 (Shafiq 12, Malik 32) - Target 221

Marsh, recalled to the Australian Test side, hasn’t done his international 
reputation much good today. A golden duck with the bat and now wicketless with 
the ball. An innocuous over passes with little incident.

Sahib Rahman has emailed in. “Hello,” he writes. Hello Sahib.

“Back live,” says Tubby, in case we were unable to tell the difference between 
the bowling of Mitchell Marsh and Wasim Akram.

41st over: Pakistan 187-3 (Shafiq 11, Malik 31) - Target 221

Last roll of the dice from Smith, bringing Starc back. His main weapon has 
just two overs remaining.

The change fails to work though with Shafiq and Malik looking composed at the 
crease, working the straight deliveries into gaps and not chasing the wider 
ones.

40th over: Pakistan 183-3 (Shafiq 8, Malik 30) - Target 221

Mitch Marsh back into the attack and he begins with a loosener, short and wide 
and slapped behind point for four. Malik betters his own work a few deliveries 
later, presenting the full face of the bat to a ball that races away beyond 
Marsh’s follow through for four more.

After that wobble 10-overs or so ago, Pakistan are back in the groove.

39th over: Pakistan 175-3 (Shafiq 8, Malik 22) - Target 221

Hazlewood has a big LBW shout turned down but has no review to play with. DRS 
indicated an Umpire’s Call so that review wouldn’t have benefited Australia 
anyway.

Just two singles from the over, Hazlewood’s last. He finishes with 0/31 from 
his ten.

Pakistan require 46 from 66 - still theirs to lose. The required run rate 
hasn’t gone above 5rpo all night.
 
38th over: Pakistan 173-3 (Shafiq 7, Malik 21) - Target 221

Malik survives his second REVIEW in quick succession. This time it was 
Australia’s call after Cummins thundered one into the batsman’s pads but it was 
bouncing over the stumps.

After that scare it turns into a good over for Pakistan with both batsmen 
piercing gaps and collecting a series of ones and twos.

Malik is taking control for Pakistan, looking for boundaries, running hard, 
putting the pressure back on Australia.
 
37th over: Pakistan 166-3 (Shafiq 3, Malik 18) - Target 221

Shafiq can’t get away and in his desperation he almost pulls Hazlewood 
straight to short midwicket, then survives a leading edge that falls just short 
of cover, AND a run-out opportunity that would have been touch and go had the 
Australian fielder hit the stumps.

Hold my Gatorade, says Malik. One clean elegant flowing swing of the bat sends 
the ball arcing over the bowler’s head for six. What a shot to unfurl at this 
stage in proceedings.

This game has come to the boil beautifully. 
 
36th over: Pakistan 159-3 (Shafiq 2, Malik 12) - Target 221

A rasping square drive from the crease from the opening delivery of Cummins’ 
over releases the pressure on Malik. But the pressure ramps up the next 
delivery as Malik is given out caught behind by umpire Gaffaney but the batsman
REVIEWSand is reprieved with nothing showing on hot spot or snicko. 

The atmosphere has lifted inside the MCG and the tension is mounting. 
Australia can smell blood but can they make the kill?
 
35th over: Pakistan 152-3 (Shafiq 2, Malik 6) - Target 221

Smith goes back to Hazlewood who concedes just one run bowling full and 
straight at Malik. Pakistan understandably regrouping, but this pair can’t 
dally too long.

chase at the MCG. Photograph: Scott Barbour/Getty Images  
34th over: Pakistan 151-3 (Shafiq 2, Malik 5) - Target 221

Cummins replaces the excellent Faulkner and he almost nabs another! A quick 
length delivery finds the edge of Malik’s bat but it dies just short of the 
first of two slips, and to add insult to injury Marsh is unable to deny the 
boundary.

70 required from 96.
 
33rd over: Pakistan 146-3 (Shafiq 2, Malik 0) - Target 221

Out of nowhere every delivery now looks like taking a wicket. Starc’s pace and 
angle from over the wicket is giving the new batsmen all sorts of problems.

32nd over: Pakistan 142-3 (Shafiq 1, Malik 0) - Target 221

Game very much on again at the MCG. Asad Shafiq and Shoaib Malik the two new 
batsmen.
 
Oh dear, Pakistan, what are you doing!? Hafeez throws his wicket away after 
all that hard work, slogging Faulkner across the line and spooning a catch to 
mid-on. Faulkner’s changes of pace doing the trick but what an unnecessarily 
rash shot from the Pakistan captain.
 
31st over: Pakistan 140-2 (Hafeez 71, 0) - Target 221

Hafeez and Babar put on 72 in 16 overs, and they were starting to put their 
foot on the accelerator before that dismissal. Can Australia capitalise?
 
Just as Pakistan were beginning to open their shoulders Australia jag one 
back. Babar timed a superb ramp shot off Starc but it doesn’t clear Hazlewood 
on the third-man fence.
 
30th over: Pakistan 131-1 (Hafeez 66, Babar 30) - Target 221

Faulkner has looked the most likely for Australia and again his changes of 
pace and cutters take Hafeez out of his comfort zone. Babar’s much more 
comfortable, nailing a stylish boundary through the covers to keep up the 
momentum.

Phil Withall is following the action. “Evening Jonathan. I confess that 
listening to the commentators struggling to suggest a delivery the bowlers 
could make to take a wicket is splendid entertainment. Constantly state the 
obvious, talk up every dot ball and the bowlers potential. I’m looking forward 
to them covering Trump’s inauguration next week.”

I’m not looking forward to anything about that particular event. 
 
29th over: Pakistan 130-1 (Hafeez 65, Babar 30) - Target 221

Expensive over for Australia and Mitchell Starc. Fours are conceded in the air 
over the vacant cordon and through point at catchable height. There’s leaky 
leg-side runs in amongst that too as Starc alternates over and around the 
wicket with no success.

28th over: Pakistan 116-1 (Hafeez 58, Babar 23) - Target 221

Faulkner and his lucky dip left-armers return to the attack, prompting 
questions from commentators about the lack of a frontline spinner in 
Australia’s XI.

Those conversations are curtailed abruptly as Cummins almost takes a screamer. 
Stationed at a deeper than regulation extra-cover Cummins leaped high in the 
air and got his fingertips to a lofted drive from Hafeez but couldn’t return to 
earth with the catch. That was so close to a highlight-reel staple.
 
27th over: Pakistan 111-1 (Hafeez 55, Babar 22) - Target 221

Starc working up a head of steam but it’s being met in kind by Babar. The 
batsman thinks he has a certain four but his cover drive right off the screws 
is fielded superbly by Head. A loose drive is then slashed away to third-man 
but well away from the solitary slip.
 
26th over: Pakistan 109-1 (Hafeez 54, Babar 21) - Target 221

Cummins continues his toil and it’s not a pretty over. Babar feasts on some 
rare length with a confident pull after Hafeez milked a three off his pads.

Back to a procession again for Pakistan after a shaky spell.

221 at the MCG. Photograph: Joe Castro/AAP  
25th over: Pakistan 101-1 (Hafeez 51, Babar 16) - Target 221

Starc returns as Smith continues his quest for wickets but Hafeez is ready and 
waiting, tucking one off his pads for four to bring up his 50 and Pakistan’s 
100.

It’s not been the most elegant knock, what with being dropped on none and 
rattled on his helmet and fingers repeatedly, but it’s been a valuable one for 
his country nonetheless.

At the halfway mark of their chase, Pakistan require 120 runs from 150 balls.
 
24th over: Pakistan 97-1 (Hafeez 47, Babar 16) - Target 221

Smith’s stationed a catcher at short mid-on for Cummins but it doesn’t phase 
Babar who drives forcefully just on the other side of the strip. Pakistan 
expertly turn three into two with some laboured running. They’ve probably left 
five to ten runs out there already in this chase because of sloppy running 
between the wickets.
 
23rd over: Pakistan 92-1 (Hafeez 46, Babar 12) - Target 221

The running repairs continue for Hafeez but he’s toughing it out. And he’ll be 
delighted with what he sees from the non-striker’s end as Babar times one 
beautifully off Hazlewood and through midwicket for four.

This partnership far from fluent though, just 24-runs from nearly nine overs.

22nd over: Pakistan 87-1 (Hafeez 45, Babar 8) - Target 221

It won’t be Marsh, it will be the returning Cummins, but the effect is 
similar, heavy, length balls that climb on the Pakistan skipper. Hafeez again 
escapes after the ball smashes into his helmet, this time coming off the 
shoulder of his bat as he flinched at one that rears at him.

Just one from the over. Australia putting the breaks on Pakistan’s chase. 
 
21st over: Pakistan 86-1 (Hafeez 44, Babar 8) - Target 221

Hazlewood probing but Pakistan have largely batted sensibly, in the ‘V’, and 
from the crease, denying him any cheap wickets. Moreover, the lack of swing or 
seam has prevented him for forcing any. He earns a maiden, now can Marsh join 
those dots with a ‘W’?

20th over: Pakistan 86-1 (Hafeez 44, Babar 8) - Target 221

Marsh continues his spell with his strong action and high arm. Again he rushes 
one through Hafeez who is late on a pull and wears one on his grille. The 
second time the Pakistan skipper has been struck on his lid this knock, not to 
mention the damaged finger.
 
19th over: Pakistan 82-1 (Hafeez 44, Babar 5) - Target 221

Smith knows he has to go for wickets so he returns to one of his main men in 
Hazlewood. His tight line and length fails to jag another wicket.
 
18th over: Pakistan 81-1 (Hafeez 43, Babar 1) - Target 221

Babar finally off the mark after nine deliveries. That precedes a delay in 
play as Marsh wraps Hafeez on the tip of his right index finger, drawing blood. 
The bowler extracted some extra, unexpected bounce, and it caught Hafeez a 
nasty blow.

Unperturbed, Hafeez caresses an off-drive for three after the restart. Babar 
responds with an even better shot, high elbow, straight blade, the ball racing 
past the non-striker for four stylish runs. Good cricket.
