If Pat Njagi had any nagging doubts about her buy-to-let investment in 
Detroit, they were surely confirmed last February when she was told that she 
wouldn’t be receiving that month’s rent. The reason? Her rent collector had 
been shot, robbed, and left to die on a doorstep.

Like hundreds of other Brits who were persuaded to buy property in America’s 
most depressed city, the teacher, who lives in Bishop’s Stortford, 
Hertfordshire, was sold the promise that the city would soon bounce back.

Now she fears she has lost the £18,000 inheritance she invested in a house in 
the city less than two years ago. Along with many others she says she was 
persuaded to buy a three-bed house that came with a sitting tenant and a 
promised 20% annual return.

Today she is being sued by a property management company in Detroit for unpaid 
fees and faces losing her entire investment. Her only solace, she says, is that 
it could have been a lot worse. Others who bought multiple properties claim to 
have lost up to £80,000.

When Detroit’s dramatic decline first hit the headlines, investors from around 
the world (the Chinese were a particular target) were soon being offered homes 
– sometimes for less than the cost of a pair of designer shoes. Njagi’s story 
starts in 2012 when she was looking to invest money she had inherited. Somehow, 
she’s not quite sure how, she came across a London-based property agency – one 
of a number of firms selling Detroit properties – called Experience 
International, run by Steve Worboys.

The company promised her a “hands-free, fully managed” investment in a 
property in Detroit. The house, she was told, had a tenant in place paying a 
healthy return. The rent, in her case, was guaranteed for at least three months.
She says that all through the sales process there was no hard sell. Buyers 
were promised sitting tenants, some that came with government-backed payments 
and rental guarantees.

She and other buyers who contacted Guardian Money say they were repeatedly 
told that Experience had undertaken “due diligence”, and as a result they could 
be confident about the deal.

Experience International’s salesman Casey Harwood, in an email, told Njagi 
that the firm’s “property management team recently reported a significant 
shortage of four-bedroom homes in Detroit. The majority of our properties are 
sold within 48 hours after an email launch so don’t miss out on your chance to 
secure proven high returns”. Another investor from London says she was told 
that she was not just buying a house, “but an investment package with 
guaranteed 23% a year rental returns”. She says that according to Harwood, 
location was the most important thing, and he “knew Detroit intimately”.

In Njagi’s case, she eventually agreed, in November 2012, to pay $27,000 
(£18,000) for a three-bed house. The sum included a £1,500 fee for Experience 
International.

The company that actually supplied and managed her property – another UK-based 
operation that went under two names, New Orbit Funding and Detroit Advantage – 
did initially produce the promised $625 a month rent, minus $875 for what she 
was told was boiler maintenance.


“Our rent collector was shot at point blank range through the chest whilst out 
collecting rent late one night and whilst he led (sic) there dying, the rent 
money that he was carrying was stolen,” it read.

It went on to say that she would be transferred to a local property management 
firm called Garner Properties & Management.

Later that year she was told her tenant had stopped paying the rent. Garner, 
she was told by Detroit Advantage, had incurred court fees evicting her tenant, 
and was now chasing her to pay them.
 Detroit properties advertised on Rightmove for British investors. 
Unwilling to spend any more money on what she fears is a doomed invesment, 
Njagi is now resigned to losing the home, while Garner’s charges have jumped 
from $1,400 to $5,400 (£3,214). Garner, she says, failed to find her a 
replacement tenant, and her home remains empty.

Others who have paid different local managing agents have found ever higher 
charges applied to their account, but no sign of any tenants, she says.
Njagi says that a group of around 30 investors met up in London recently to 
compare stories. There it emerged some had bought several homes at once, 
investing more than £55,000. All told similar stories; one woman claims to have 
lost everything, and has been suicidal as a result.

Some have asked local residents of Detroit to visit the properties they 
invested in, and video the result – only to find they are trashed wrecks.

One of the group, who wishes to remain anonymous, told Guardian Money this 
week that he bought a similar property in almost the exact same circumstances 
to Njagi from Experience International – paying around £18,000. In his case he 
was promised five months’ rent which, he says, was paid each month.

However, when his tenant left he asked a local agent to visit his property. 
The reports shocked him: he says he was told that wild dogs were living in his 
house and that it had been gutted. The boiler and other fixtures had been 
removed and, crucially, the local agent said the house looked as though it 
hadn’t been lived in for many years. The buyer says he was even more surprised 
when a private detective told him that no services had been connected to the 
house during the supposed tenancy. The agent told him that he could try and 
sell the house, but the price would not even cover the sales fees.

The buyer now accepts he won’t be getting any money back. However, Njagi is 
less sanguine. “I know now that I was a naive idiot, and it looks as though I 
have lost my inheritance from my father through this. However I want to warn 
others, and to try to do whatever I can to stop these people from continuing to 
wreck lives. What is most distressing for me is that these companies can 
continue because there is no law to say what they are doing is wrong.”

Steve Worboys, who ran Experience International, denies any wrongdoing and 
says his firm only marketed the properties on New Orbit/Detroit Advantage’s 
behalf. He said for every one client who’d had problems, 10 were satisfied. We 
asked for names of happy clients but none were provided. He added that as soon 
as he became aware of his clients’ issues he had stopped offering properties in 
Detroit. He claimed he is also owed money by the man behind New Orbit, Sean 
Murray, and is as keen as anyone to see him investigated by the authorities. 
Murray could not be reached this week.

Worboys now runs a separate company, Experience Invest, and sells UK property 
investments, including student housing.

Casey Harwood, together with a former member of New Orbit’s staff, Denise 
Lambert, now run UsaAdvantage.com, a site that sells US property. Emails and 
calls from Guardian Money this week went unanswered.

Chris Garner places Njagi’s problems at New Orbit’s door, which he said had no 
business selling the Detroit homes in the way it did. “We are a professional 
management company that inherited a tenant not paying the rent and took steps 
as per the management agreement – that Njagi signed – to remove her. We have 
spent $1,500 on dealing with her property and just want this money back. So far 
she has only paid us $350,” he says.

The sales patter


The car industry has long departed, and the city famously declared bankruptcy 
in 2013. It’s a place with the highest crime rate of any large US city, and has 
lost almost two-thirds of its 2.2m population since 1950.

But despite the headlines and stories, ambitious agents are right now trying 
to find risk-taking – or highly gullible (depending on your view) – British 
buyers who are prepared to bet that the city will bounce back, buyers who are 
tempted to snap up whole houses for the price of a used Ford Mondeo.
Rightmove this week was advertising 135 ­properties in the city, being 
marketed by an agent in the UK. Starting at just $8,999 (£5,350), the cheapest 
is a property in Wayne County. Like many others it is being offered as 
“currently occupied by a long-term tenant”.
The sales blurb promises that there is the option to “increase the rent at a 
future date”, in spite of the fact that parts of the city are so thoroughly 
abandoned that they have been ­described as looking like farmland.
The houses are advertised as ­offering “incredible value for money” and come 
with promised 30%-plus ­returns on investment.
