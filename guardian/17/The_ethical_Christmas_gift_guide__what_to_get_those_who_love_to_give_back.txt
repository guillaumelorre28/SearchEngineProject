The environmentalist

We all have that one friend. The one, just like Leonardo DiCaprio, who likes 
to educate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/08/leonardo-dicaprio-donald-trump-green-jobs>
 people about climate change and has gifted their own share of Before The Flood 
and Inconvenient Truth DVDs. This Christmas, you can show your environmentalist 
friend that you are listening by making adonation to WildEarth Guardians 
<https://secure3.convio.net/wg/site/Donation2;jsessionid=1C35A335809AF102F95B3E530D3AF95C.app317b?idb=1011732180&DONATION_LEVEL_ID_SELECTED=1&df_id=7420&mfc_pref=T&7420.donation=form1&idb=0#.WFRfXFMrKpo>
 on their behalf.

WildEarth started in 1989 to fight logging in New Mexico, but it has since 
expanded its efforts to protect and restore wildlife in the American West. 
Using your donation, the organization will plant native cottonwoods and willows 
at one of their river restoration sites. Each Hamilton (a $10 bill) will pay 
for one new tree. WildEarth will notify your friend about the donation by 
sending a personalized card.

The teenager

Shopping for teenagers is hard. Almost as difficult as having the birds and 
the bees talk. Why not kill two birds with one stone and subscribe your teen to 
Sex, Etc <http://sexetc.org/about>?

sex education among America’s youth. The magazine comes out three times a year 
and addresses sex, relationships, pregnancy, STDs, birth control, sexual 
orientation and more. Published by Answer, a national sex education 
organization at Rutgers University in New Jersey, each issue costs just $5 
<https://answer.rutgers.edu/subscribe>, or $15 for an annual subscription.

of Americans consider themselves vegetarian. If the vegetarian in your life has 
a soft spot for farm animals, you should consider sponsoring a farm animal at 
the Farm Sanctuary <https://www.farmsanctuary.org/>. Not only does sponsorship 
provide food and shelter for a needy farm animal, but the sanctuary, which has 
several locations throughout the US, also allows sponsors to visit 
<https://www.farmsanctuary.org/giving/adopt-a-farm-animal/adopt-a-farm-animal-faq/>
 their special farm friend during its visitors season.

Sponsoring a chicken will set you back $120

 a year. It would be $180 a year for a duck, goose or turkey and $300 a year 
for a goat or sheep. While a one-time donation of $20 is not enough to sponsor 
an animal, it does come with aone-year membership

On behalf of a loved one who can always spare change for the homeless, make a 
contribution to the Empowerment Plan <http://www.empowermentplan.org/>. The 
organization offers ways to sponsor food, clothing, shelter and transportation 
for the homeless. A $100 donation, for example, pays for a coat that can turn 
into a sleeping bag. The Empowerment Plan hires single parents out of shelters 
to work as seamstresses making the coats. According to its website, it has 
employed 34 homeless people and handed out more than 15,000 coats since 2012.

The news junkie

Independent, local journalism is critical for keeping elected officials 
accountable and connecting people within a community. Consider a local 
newspaper subscription for your news junkie friend. (Or, ahem,the Guardian 
<https://contribute.theguardian.com/us>.) If you aren’t sure about the 
subscription options, enter your friend’s zipcodehere 
<https://mylocalpaper.com/HomeDelivery.aspx?fZip=47303https://mylocalpaper.com/HomeDelivery.aspx?fZip=47303>
 to find out <https://mylocalpaper.com/HomeDelivery.aspx?fZip=47303> if they 
are eligible. (It is best to subscribe to newspapers straight from their 
websites, however.) A good alternative to a local newspaper is a subscription 
to a regional magazine such as Boston Magazine 
<https://secure.palmcoastd.com/pcd/eSv?iMagId=16102&i4Ky=IHTR>, Texas Monthly 
<https://tex.pcdfusion.com/pcd/Order?iKey=I**NVB>, Texas Tribune 
<https://support.texastribune.org/?_ga=1.192865770.1986906606.1481782842>, 
Chicago Magazine <https://cma.pcdfusion.com/pcd/Order?iKey=I**DEB> or Our State 
<https://www.ourstate.com/subscriptions/gift-subscriptions/>, a North Carolina 
magazine.

Throw in a few good DVDs about journalism, too. Spotlight, on the Boston 
Globe’s investigation of a sexual abuse coverup within the Catholic church, is 
a good one. So is Network, an oldie from 1976 about a fictional TV news program 
that uses entertainment to drive ratings.

The conservative relative

Holding a civil debate with conservative relatives can be so challenging 
during the holidays. Let counter-programming do the work instead. Sign them up 
for a subscription to theirlocal NPR station <http://www.npr.org/stations/> and 
ask them to give its content a chance. <http://www.npr.org/> 

Want to avoid politics? You can sign them up for nonpartisan collections of 
stories on NPR, such as thedog tales 
<http://shop.npr.org/products/driveway-moments-dog-tales> or cat tales 
<http://shop.npr.org/products/npr-driveway-moments-cat-tales>. After all, who 
doesn’t love a good animal story?

The bookworm

Delight your book lover friends by introducing them to tomes from a small 
publishing house. Almost 40% of books 
<http://www.bookbusinessmag.com/post/self-publishing-big-five-dominate-book-market-according-nielsen/>
 are published by five major publishing houses. Small, independent presses are 
an important source for a greater variety of voices and perspectives. Here are 
a few great small publishers who have fabulous books in fiction, nonfiction and 
poetry:Graywolf Press 
<https://www.graywolfpress.org/https:/www.graywolfpress.org/https:/www.graywolfpress.org/>
, Red Hen Press <http://redhen.org/>, Inkshares <https://www.inkshares.com/>, 
and Melville House <http://www.mhpbooks.com/>.

Books from small, independent co-op bookstores are also a great gift idea. Try 
Antigone Books <http://www.antigonebooks.com/> in Tucson, Arizona, which also 
has the benefit of being 100% solar-powered;Powell’s <http://www.powells.com/> 
in Portland, Oregon; and the famousCity Lights <http://www.citylights.com/> in 
San Francisco, California.
