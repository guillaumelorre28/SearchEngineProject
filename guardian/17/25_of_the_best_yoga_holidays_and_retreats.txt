You can’t move for downward dog opportunities these days. The explosion of 
yoga in western countries means there’s a studio on every other street and such 
a variety of styles and options, that choosing a holiday or retreat can be 
overwhelming. So where to start? It makes sense to try a weekend away before 
committing to a whole week. One possibility is to choose a teacher you know or 
like the sound of and see if they’re running anything that suits. Or you could 
pick a venue you fancy and see what teachers are hosting holidays there. Think 
about what you want too – some combine yoga with other activities (maybe good 
for those with non-yogi partners), some are vegan, some don’t ban booze – it’s 
always worth asking before you book.

Most retreats will cater for all levels, with teachers listening to individual 
needs, but I’ve marked those particularly for beginners suitable with aB. We 
think all the places we’re covering here offer good value, but those that stand 
out price-wise are marked with a£.

There is a glossary of yoga terms at the end of this article.

At the soulful Sen Wellness Sanctuary, in a nature reserve, there are yoga 
classes on breathtaking Rekawa beach as the sun rises, followed by breakfast of 
fruits and a fresh coconut, and ayurvedic treatments or sessions with a 
resident osteopath before sunset yoga in the shala overlooking mangroves. 
Excellent acupuncture is available, and meals are veggie with some fish. Yoga 
teachers in residence in 2017 include kundalini teacher Maren Lander and Pleuni 
van Hulten, who teaches two Scaravelli-inspired vinyasa flow and yin yoga 
classes each day, giving a lot of useful hands-on adjustments. All meals are 
ayurvedic Sri Lankan curries, and you’ll see wild monkeys in the trees.

bodywork and vegan meals.
