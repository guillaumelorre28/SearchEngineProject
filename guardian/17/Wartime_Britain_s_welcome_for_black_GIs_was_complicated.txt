While Hugh Muir’s observations on the positive reception received by African 
American troops in the UK during the second world war are largely accurate (

, Opinion, 31 December), the full story is more complicated. The presence of 
American soldiers was a temporary wartime expedient, and the treatment these 
young men received, particularly those who were black, was partially because 
they would not be staying. Moreover, while African Americans were certainly 
welcomed, this reflected not only British hospitality but also anti-American 
sentiment as much as a rejection of American racism. British publicans, for 
example, objected to being told by white Americans who they could or could not 
serve. As one Briton noted: “I don’t mind the Yanks, but I can’t say I care for 
those white chaps they’ve brought with them.”
