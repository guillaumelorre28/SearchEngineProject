Back in June I rented a car for a week from Fleet Rent a Car at Dubrovnik 
airport via the Holiday Autos website. The plane was slightly late and Fleet 
charged me an extra £32 for late pick-up. It also took my card details for 
pre-authorisation of £1,250, which was refunded at the end of the rental when 
the car was returned on time, full of petrol and with no damage.

I assumed that was the end of it but then, in September, two payments were 
taken from my credit card, amounting to £325. I immediately contacted Holiday 
Autos with the reference number of the booking, and was eventually told it was 
a late pick-up charge. I pointed out that this was already paid and sent it my 
credit card statement, but this has been ignored.

How can a car hire company just take money without any authority and the agent 
not do anything about it?MW, Cambridge

Receiving unexpected charges on your credit card months after the event is 
just one the pleasures of hiring a car in Europe these days. This one was at 
least relatively easy to sort out. Holiday Autos claimed the additional charges 
came as a result of a “clerical error on the supplier’s part”. The “supplier” 
has now agreed to refund you in full for the £325. Additionally, Holiday Autos 
is sending you a token of goodwill for the inconvenience caused by the issue.

European consumer bodies really need to tackle the car hire industry and put 
in place ways to stop these spurious charges appearing on renters’ bills.
