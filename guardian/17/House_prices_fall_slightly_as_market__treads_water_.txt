House prices <https://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices> fell for a second 
month running in August and the housing market continues to "tread water", 
according to the latest monthly report from mortgage lender Halifax.

The average house price was Â£160,256 last month, which was 0.4% lower than the 
previous month, Halifax said, cancelling out two previous rises as prices 
drifted back to levels seen at the end of 2011.

Halifax's housing economist, Martin Ellis, said easing inflation should boost 
spending power and support house prices in the coming months, but added that 
the market was expected to remain flat heading into 2013.

The figures are at odds with a recent report by the Nationwide which showed 
thathouse prices rose 1.3% in August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/31/house-prices-august-rise-nationwide>
, their biggest monthly rebound in more than two-and-a-half years. Nationwide 
also recorded a 0.7% annual fall compared with Halifax's 0.9%.

However, the two lenders use different methodology

with Halifax calculating its annual price change figure by taking an average 
over three months and comparing that with the same period of the previous year.

House price data has been volatile in recent months with low sales volumes as 
banks rein in mortgage lending.

Ellis said: "A gradual upward trend in spending power, aided by lower 
inflation, should help to support housing demand in the coming months. 
Nonetheless, house prices are likely to remain flat over the remainder of 2012 
and into next year."

Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: 
"September heralds the start of a final push in property sales before the end 
of the year, as would-be buyers aim to get into their new homes before 
Christmas, so we expect to see a pick-up in business in the next couple of 
months."
