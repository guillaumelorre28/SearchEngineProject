Afternoon summary

 * Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, has undermined Theresa 
May’s claim to be funding health properly by flatly contradicting her assertion 
that the service has been given all the money it wants. He made the point 
during an assertive appearance before the Commons public accounts committee 
during which he also disagreed openly withChris Wormald, permanent secretary at 
the Department of Health. Wormald said spending on health in the UK was in line 
with the OECD average. Stevens said that that was misleading because the OECD 
figures included countries like Mexico, that the UK spent less than on health 
than comparable advanced nations, and that it spent 30% less on health per head 
than Germany. May has repeatedly said that the NHS was given more than Stevens 
requested when he set out his five-year plan. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/30/theresa-mays-claim-on-health-funding-not-true-say-mps>
 But Stevens denied this. He told the MPs: 
Like probably every part of the public service we got less than we asked for 
in that process. So I think it would be stretching it to say theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> has got more than it asked for ... 
There are clearly very substantial pressures, and I don’t think it helps 
anybody to try and pretend that there aren’t.

Stevens, a former Labour councillor and a health adviser to Tony Blair who was 
appointed to run NHS England by David Cameron, was not asked about a Times 
story claiming that No 10 aides think his unenthusiastic approach is 
contributing to problems in the NHS. (See 9.21am.)

 But his evidence, which also saw him demanding a more robust government 
response to the social care crisis, was interpreted as him fighting back. (See 
4.35pm.)

 * Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has claimed that Labour’s proposals to 
scrap corporation tax cuts to release more money for health are “mortally 
dangerous” to the NHS.Speaking in a Commons debate on the NHS called by Labour 
he said: 
This reveals, I’m afraid, a fundamental misunderstanding about how you fund 
the NHS. Corporation taxes are being cut so that we can boost jobs and 
strengthen the economy so that we can fund the NHS. The reason we’ve been able 
to protect and increase funding in the NHS in the last six years, when the 
party opposite was not willing to do so, is precisely because we’ve created two 
million jobs and we’ve given this country the fastest growing economy in the G7 
- and that is even more important post-Brexit.

So to risk that growth, which is what their proposal will do, would not just 
risk funding for the NHS - it’d be dangerous for the economy and mortally 
dangerous for the NHS.

 * The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has attempted to pave the way for a smooth 
Brexit by assuring Germany that the UK has no desire to disrupt the EU during 
its divorce from Brussels. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/11/phil-hammond-seeks-to-assure-germany-over-smooth-path-to-brexit>
 * Germany’s largest centre-left party says it would be prepared to let the 
country’s own short-term economic interests take a back seat and make the 
“unity of the European Union” a priority in the upcoming Brexit negotiations if 
it were to form part of the next government. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/11/german-centre-left-would-make-eu-unity-a-priority-in-brexit-talks>
 * Dairy farms in Northern Ireland will “go out of business” after Brexit if 
barriers to trade with the Republic of Ireland are erected, the government has 
been warned. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/11/brexit-barriers-would-ruin-northern-ireland-dairy-farms-mps-told>
 * The Foreign Office is to review its policy on forced marriage after the 
Guardian revealed that victims are ordered to repay the government the costs of 
their repatriation. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/11/fco-foreign-office-reviews-policy-of-making-forced-marriage-victims-pay-for-flights-loan>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Q: What effect would a hard Brexit have on the NHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs>?

Wormald says Brexit would raise issues for the DoH. But the issue does not 
dominate the department’s thinking.

There would be an impact on workforce, and impact on drug regulation and an 
impact on the mutal recognition of health costs.

But the government is not giving a running commentary, he says.

Stevens says about a quarter of NHS doctors are foreign nationals. The NHS has 
a slight advantage, in terms of having a relatively low proportion of hospital 
doctors over 55. But the NHS will continue to need to hire foreign staff.

Mackey says this year the NHS will deliver efficiency savings at just over 3%. 
He says 4% has been set as a target. He says he would like these targets to be 
lower. He says people did not expect theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> to be able to achieve the 
efficiencies it has managed this year. But it will not be possible to go on 
like this forever, he says.

And this is from Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary.

Just hours after the prime minister stands up at PMQs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> commending her government’s funding 
of the NHS, the NHS England chief tells MPs that it would be stretching it to 
say that the NHS has got more money than it asked for.

Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> is in total 
denial about the crisis the Tories have created in the NHS.

The warnings from professionals and patients have flooded in, but Theresa May 
has just buried her head in the sand. At prime minister’s questions today she 
again refused Labour’s calls for extra funding, claiming that she’s given the 
NHS the money it needs. But her argument has now been blown out of the water by 
two top NHS chiefs who have starkly laid out the truth: theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> is facing financial crisis under the 
Tories.

Enough is enough. Theresa May needs to come out of her bunker, admit she’s got 
it wrong and guarantee the funding the NHS needs.

Number 10 should listen to the experts like Simon Stevens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/simon-stevens> and not be briefing against 
him.

The two NHS “chiefs” Ashworth is referring to are Chris Hopson (see 3.04pm)

Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem health spokesman, has put out this response to Simon 
Stevens’ comments about theNHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> not 
getting all the money it wanted. He said:

These worrying comments reinforce the case for a fresh approach to NHS funding.

The government must stop trying to shoot the messenger and admit that current 
levels of underfunding are not sustainable.

We urgently need serious cross-party discussions on how to fund the NHS and 
social care in the long-term, or standards will fall and patients will suffer.

Partisan politics has failed, and no one party can provide a solution to this 
crisis.

My genuine hope is that the prime minister’s acceptance of my request to meet 
[see 12.28pm]

 might be the start of a more rational approach, which could provide the NHS 
and social care with the resources they need to provide high-quality care for 
future generations.

Simon Stevens has been going for almost an hour and a half now, and he still 
has not been asked about today’s Times splash. (See9.21am.)

But the Times story may explain Stevens’ tone. This is from Alastair McLellan,

Stevens is clearly telling No10 spinners - come after me and I'll hit back 
twice as hard. Interesting to see their reaction

Stevens says there are four beds in care home for every acute hospital bed.

So what happens in care homes affects hospital.

He says the problems in the care sector need to be stabilised “pretty quickly”.

Then the government needs to push health and social care integration over the 
next few years.

And, after 2020, the government needs a proper review of the way health and 
social care is funded.

Caroline Flint, the Labour MP and a former health minister, goes next.

Q: Labour built health centres to improve what services GPs can offer. Why are 
these not being used?

Stevens says GPs’ views have changed. In the past, when “polyclinics” were 
proposed, GPs would run a mile.

He says, although the NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> is 
efficient, there are still more efficiencies that can be achieved.

Wormald says total health spending is around the average for the OECD.

Stevens says he does not like to disagree with Wormald. The OECD includes 
countries like Mexico. If we look at countries we normally compare ourselves 
to, we are spending less than the average. We are spending 30% less per head 
than Germany, he says.

He produced a newspaper cutting from the Daily Mail saying Britain spends less 
than Europe on doctors, beds and scanners. He implies that is a tribute to the 
NHS’s efficiency.

UPDATE:

 * Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, has undermined Theresa 
May’s claim to be funding health properly by flatly contradicting her assertion 
that the service has been given all the money it wants. He made the point 
during an assertive appearance before the Commons public accounts committee 
during which he also disagreed openly withChris Wormald, permanent secretary at 
the Department of Health. Wormald said spending on health in the UK was in line 
with the OECD average. Stevens said that that was misleading because the OECD 
figures included countries like Mexico, that the UK spent less than on health 
than comparable advanced nations, and that it spent 30% less on health per head 
than Germany. May has repeatedly said that the NHS was given more than Stevens 
requested when he set out his five-year plan. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/30/theresa-mays-claim-on-health-funding-not-true-say-mps>
 But Stevens denied this. He told the MPs: 
Like probably every part of the public service we got less than we asked for 
in that process. So I think it would be stretching it to say theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> has got more than it asked for ... 
There are clearly very substantial pressures, and I don’t think it helps 
anybody to try and pretend that there aren’t.

Stevens, a former Labour councillor and a health adviser to Tony Blair who was 
appointed to run NHS England by David Cameron, was not asked about a Times 
story claiming that No 10 aides think his unenthusiastic approach is 
contributing to problems in the NHS. (See 9.21am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/11/pmqs-may-corbyn-nhs-simon-stevens-10-plays-down-reports-of-rift-with-nhs-chief-simon-stevens-politics-live?page=with:block-5875f1b6e4b0710de27b8657#block-5875f1b6e4b0710de27b8657>
 But his evidence, which also saw him demanding a more robust government 
response to the social care crisis, was interpreted as him fighting back. (See 
4.35pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/11/pmqs-may-corbyn-nhs-simon-stevens-10-plays-down-reports-of-rift-with-nhs-chief-simon-stevens-politics-live?page=with:block-58765e31e4b0c0afac91fb5d#block-58765e31e4b0c0afac91fb5d>

 * Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has claimed that Labour’s proposals to 
scrap corporation tax cuts to release more money for health are “mortally 
dangerous” to the NHS.Speaking in a Commons debate on the NHS called by Labour 
he said: 
This reveals, I’m afraid, a fundamental misunderstanding about how you fund 
the NHS. Corporation taxes are being cut so that we can boost jobs and 
strengthen the economy so that we can fund the NHS. The reason we’ve been able 
to protect and increase funding in the NHS in the last six years, when the 
party opposite was not willing to do so, is precisely because we’ve created two 
million jobs and we’ve given this country the fastest growing economy in the G7 
- and that is even more important post-Brexit.

So to risk that growth, which is what their proposal will do, would not just 
risk funding for the NHS - it’d be dangerous for the economy and mortally 
dangerous for the NHS.

 * The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has attempted to pave the way for a smooth 
Brexit by assuring Germany that the UK has no desire to disrupt the EU during 
its divorce from Brussels. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/11/phil-hammond-seeks-to-assure-germany-over-smooth-path-to-brexit>
 * Germany’s largest centre-left party says it would be prepared to let the 
country’s own short-term economic interests take a back seat and make the 
“unity of the European Union” a priority in the upcoming Brexit negotiations if 
it were to form part of the next government.

 * Dairy farms in Northern Ireland will “go out of business” after Brexit if 
barriers to trade with the Republic of Ireland are erected, the government has 
been warned.

their repatriation. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/11/fco-foreign-office-reviews-policy-of-making-forced-marriage-victims-pay-for-flights-loan>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Q: What effect would a hard Brexit have on the NHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs>?

Wormald says Brexit would raise issues for the DoH. But the issue does not 
dominate the department’s thinking.

There would be an impact on workforce, and impact on drug regulation and an 
impact on the mutal recognition of health costs.

But the government is not giving a running commentary, he says.

Stevens says about a quarter of NHS doctors are foreign nationals. The NHS has 
a slight advantage, in terms of having a relatively low proportion of hospital 
doctors over 55. But the NHS will continue to need to hire foreign staff.
 
Mackey says this year the NHS will deliver efficiency savings at just over 3%. 
He says 4% has been set as a target. He says he would like these targets to be 
lower. He says people did not expect theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> to be able to achieve the 
efficiencies it has managed this year. But it will not be possible to go on 
like this forever, he says.
 
The Times story this morning said Downing Street aides complain that Simon 
Stevens is not “enthusiastic”. (See9.21am.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/11/pmqs-may-corbyn-nhs-simon-stevens-10-plays-down-reports-of-rift-with-nhs-chief-simon-stevens-politics-live?page=with:block-5875f1b6e4b0710de27b8657#block-5875f1b6e4b0710de27b8657>
The Times’sChris Smyth says Stevens has been using his evidence this afternoon 
to hit back quite pointedly.
Chris Smyth (@Smyth_Chris) 
No 10 says Stevens not "enthusiastic". He says he is campaigning against govt 
social care cuts "enthusiastically I might add". Gratuitous

<https://twitter.com/Smyth_Chris/status/819225223946010624>  
And this is from Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary.

Just hours after the prime minister stands up at PMQs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> commending her government’s funding 
of the NHS, the NHS England chief tells MPs that it would be stretching it to 
say that the NHS has got more money than it asked for.

Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> is in total 
denial about the crisis the Tories have created in the NHS.

The warnings from professionals and patients have flooded in, but Theresa May 
has just buried her head in the sand. At prime minister’s questions today she 
again refused Labour’s calls for extra funding, claiming that she’s given the 
NHS the money it needs. But her argument has now been blown out of the water by 
two top NHS chiefs who have starkly laid out the truth: theNHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> is facing financial crisis under the 
Tories.

Enough is enough. Theresa May needs to come out of her bunker, admit she’s got 
it wrong and guarantee the funding the NHS needs.

Number 10 should listen to the experts like Simon Stevens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/simon-stevens> and not be briefing against 
him.

The two NHS “chiefs” Ashworth is referring to are Chris Hopson (see 3.04pm)

Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem health spokesman, has put out this response to Simon 
Stevens’ comments about theNHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> not 
getting all the money it wanted. He said:

These worrying comments reinforce the case for a fresh approach to NHS funding.

The government must stop trying to shoot the messenger and admit that current 
levels of underfunding are not sustainable.

We urgently need serious cross-party discussions on how to fund the NHS and 
social care in the long-term, or standards will fall and patients will suffer.

Partisan politics has failed, and no one party can provide a solution to this 
crisis.

My genuine hope is that the prime minister’s acceptance of my request to meet 
[see 12.28pm] 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/11/pmqs-may-corbyn-nhs-simon-stevens-10-plays-down-reports-of-rift-with-nhs-chief-simon-stevens-politics-live?page=with:block-587624bbe4b0710de27b86d0#block-587624bbe4b0710de27b86d0>
 might be the start of a more rational approach, which could provide the NHS 
and social care with the resources they need to provide high-quality care for 
future generations.
 
Stevens is now talking about STP’s (sustainability and transformation plans).

Simon Stevens has been going for almost an hour and a half now, and he still 
has not been asked about today’s Times splash. (See9.21am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/11/pmqs-may-corbyn-nhs-simon-stevens-10-plays-down-reports-of-rift-with-nhs-chief-simon-stevens-politics-live?page=with:block-5875f1b6e4b0710de27b8657#block-5875f1b6e4b0710de27b8657>

But the Times story may explain Stevens’ tone. This is from Alastair McLellan, 
editor of theHealth <https://www.theguardian.com/society/health> Service 
Journal.
Alastair McLellan (@HSJEditor) 
Stevens is clearly telling No10 spinners - come after me and I'll hit back

NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> boss Stevens says he has been 
"running a little campaign" against cuts to social care. Bloomin' 'eck. Are 
officials allowed to do that?
 <https://twitter.com/Peston/status/819218179163570176> January 11, 2017 
<https://twitter.com/Peston/status/819218179163570176>  
Stevens says there are four beds in care home for every acute hospital bed.

So what happens in care homes affects hospital.

He says the problems in the care sector need to be stabilised “pretty quickly”.

Then the government needs to push health and social care integration over the 
next few years.

And, after 2020, the government needs a proper review of the way health and 
social care is funded.

Caroline Flint, the Labour MP and a former health minister, goes next.

Q: Labour built health centres to improve what services GPs can offer. Why are 
these not being used?

Stevens says GPs’ views have changed. In the past, when “polyclinics” were 
proposed, GPs would run a mile.

He says, although the NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> is 
efficient, there are still more efficiencies that can be achieved.

<https://twitter.com/patrick_kidd/status/819215489322909703>  
Wormald says total health spending is around the average for the OECD.

Stevens says he does not like to disagree with Wormald. The OECD includes 
countries like Mexico. If we look at countries we normally compare ourselves 
to, we are spending less than the average. We are spending 30% less per head 
than Germany, he says.

He produced a newspaper cutting from the Daily Mail saying Britain spends less 
than Europe on doctors, beds and scanners. He implies that is a tribute to the 
NHS’s efficiency.
