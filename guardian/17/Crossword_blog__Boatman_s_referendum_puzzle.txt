That’s right: “solutions” plural. If you found the top-right corner a little 
tricky, that’s because all was not as it seemed. Likewise, if you didn’t have 
any trouble, but thought it was a little hubristic for a cryptic crossword to 
predict the outcome of a democratic decision, read on.

This astonishing crossword is in the spirit of America’s best loved puzzle. In 
1996, the maths professor Jerry Farrell set a crossword for the New York Times 
in which 39 across purported to give the “Lead story in tomorrow’s newspaper 
(!)” – that is, the name of the new president.

And it was able to do so because of a section of the grid where every down 
clue led to two equally valid answers. “Black Halloween animal”, for example, 
gave CAT and BAT. “Trumpet” gave BLAST and BOAST. And the single-letter 
differences between these entries meant that you ended up with either CLINTON 
or BOB DOLE in the middle row, next to the word ELECTED.

It was a giddying experience for solvers, and finally British crossworders 
have been given the same strange gift, this time with cryptic clueing, and with 
BRITAIN STAYS IN EUROPEAN UNION and BRITAIN TO LEAVE EUROPEAN UNION as valid 
“results”. Let’s talk to Boatman about how it was done.

Congratulations on the puzzle. Tell us a little about where the idea came from.

I’d been talking to my crossword students 
<http://www.boatmancryptics.co.uk/index_files/CrosswordMasterclasses.html> 
about the challenge of creating an ambiguous cryptic clue. Can you find two 
words that can be defined in the same way? Alternatively, can you make the 
wordplay for one possible solution serve as the definition for another, and 
vice versa?

Then the referendum was announced and some inner demon suggested that if ever 
there were a chance to put these ideas into practice, this was it.

We’ve had few opportunities in the UK for a puzzle like the CLINTON/DOLE one. 
It wouldn’t work in a general election here, because we can never be absolutely 
sure of getting one clear winner and we’re not limited to two candidates.

What do you imagine the solver’s experience was like?

Well, it would be wonderful if nobody noticed anything unusual, but I suspect 
that most solvers will have been frustrated for some time by trying to fit 
together incompatible solutions for the down clues, until spotting one of the 
possible solutions for five across, followed by a loud penny-dropping moment as 
they realised that at least one of the downs had an alternative solution, 
possibly followed by an even louder “PDM” as they saw that the ambiguity 
extended to the top row as well.

And if some solvers haven’t had that last moment of realisation until just 
now, so much the better!

The puzzle is by “Boatman and Crew”. Who are the Crew?

The Crew are five new setters who have taken my crossword-masterclass 
programme and are starting to make names for themselves by creatingcustom 
puzzles <http://www.customcrypticcrosswords.com/> and setting in newspapers and 
magazines. They are known as Claret (of 1 Across magazine), Jack/Serpent 
(Guardian Genius, Independent and 1 Across), Soup (Genius and 1 Across), Vigo 
(Independent) and Windsurfer.

The Crew fine-tuned the grid and supplied sparkling clue-writing for the slots 
that remained after I’d set up the core ambiguous theme clues.

Finally, let’s get technical. How does that top row work?

My first job was to find two phrases of the same length to express remaining 
or exiting. I eventually settled on BRITAIN STAYS IN and BRITAIN TO LEAVE 
because each had 14 letters and stood a good chance of fitting across the top 
of a Guardian grid.

If you have 14 or more letters to play with, there’s almost always an anagram 
to be found, so that’s what I looked for: one for each of the possible 
solutions, which would also work as the definition for the other.

I soon saw that SANITY and BRAIN were part of BRITAIN STAYS IN, and I liked 
the way the other solution was bookended by BRAVE, so I had the promise of a 
possible clue and a relevant, “semi-&lit 
<http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2008/08/and-literally-so.html>” surface.

This was what I came up with in the end:

Use brain! It’s sanity to change? Take courage and embrace it with wild 
elation! (3 words)

So for the solution BRITAIN STAYS IN, the definition is “Take courage and 
embrace it with wild elation!” and the wordplay is an anagram of BRAIN IT’S 
SANITY.

And for BRITAIN TO LEAVE, the definition is “Use brain! It’s sanity to change” 
and the wordplay is (be) BRAVE containing IT and an anagram of ELATION.

And what about the tricksy down answers?

I didn’t want the multiple solutions to spread too far, so I looked for pairs 
of words in the north-east corner that were identical apart from the first 
letter and perhaps one or two other non-crossing letters. After some false 
starts, these were the final results.

5d Messing with/immersing ends of mangetout, perhaps, in great cooking (9)

I had a few options for this slot, and chose SIMMERING / TAMPERING because the 
possible definitions of “cooking” and “messing” both suggested anagrams.


So SIMMERING is given by the definition “Ends of mangetout, perhaps, in great 
cooking” and the wordplay is an anagram of IMMERSING.

And TAMPERING is defined by “messing”, with the first letters of MANGETOUT and 
PERHAPS inside an angram of IN GREAT.

6d Join absolute beginner with unusual model kin (4) 

A late substitution, after struggling to make my first idea of A-ONE / LONE 
work, led (with apologies for the agonising lift-and-separate device in the 
wordplay for the Remain solution) to this pair.


AUNT is defined by “kin” and the wordplay is the first letter of ABSOLUTE, 
then UN, then the “usual model” is T.


LINK is defined by “join” and the wordplay is L plus an anagram of KIN.

7d Cut in half, as part of crossword by Boatman’s boss was set down (8)

This one is more straightforward than its lengthy clue suggests, and revolves 
around two ways of taking or cutting half of “as”.


For SLIGHTED, the definition is “cut” and the wordplay is half of AS, plus 
LIGHT plus ED.


And ALIGHTED is defined by “was set down”, with the wordplay the other half of 
AS, likewise followed by LIGHT and ED.

8d Women often get into theirs later – after a point, that is an odd sight, 
overall (8)

I saved a silly one for last, in which (just for a change) the definition is 
shared between the two cases:


For NIGHTIES, the definition is “Women often get into theirs later” (as in, 
later in the evening), and the wordplay is the compass point N followed by an 
anagram of SIGHT containing IE.

And EIGHTIES is defined by “Women often get into theirs later” (as in, later 
in life), with the wordplay a different compass point (E), again followed by an 
anagram of SIGHT containing IE.

Phew! I hope you enjoyed that, because I certainly enjoyed the setting of it.

I, for one, am delighted with the outcome. (The puzzle, that is. This post was 
prepared in advance of polling day.)
