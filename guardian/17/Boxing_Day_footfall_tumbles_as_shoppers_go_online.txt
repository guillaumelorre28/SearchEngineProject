British bargain hunters have shunned high streets and shopping centres this 
Boxing Day, according to early indications that highlight the growing 
competition faced by traditional retailers from online stores.

Retailers sought to put a positive spin on trade on one of their most crucial 
days of the year, but early estimates of Boxing Day footfall, a measure of 
shopper numbers, showed it was down 7.2% on a year ago by 4pm.

The decline was driven by a 15.5% drop in shopping centre footfall and 4.7% 
decline in those visiting Britain’s high streets, according to the figures from 
retail analysts Springboard.

Out-of-town stores did not fare quite so badly, with their footfall down just 
3% on Boxing Day 2015.

Diane Wehrle, Springboard’s insights director, estimated that once figures for 
the full 24 hours were in they would show a Boxing Day drop of about 5% on a 
year ago.

The decline in footfall follows signs of slowdown in retail sales amid rising 
consumer worries about inflation

 and the uncertain economic outlook after the Brexit vote.

Stores traditionally targeted by Boxing Day bargain hunters continued to 
report strong trade

 and there were signs the weak pound was helping to bolster takings from 
tourists.

In London, Harrods said it was expecting a busy Boxing Day to build on a 
strong run-up to Christmas when it had achieved double-digit sales growth on a 
year ago.

The managing director of the luxury department store, Michael Ward, said 
butlers were on hand on Monday to serve queues of shoppers coffee and 
croissants.

“I have to say we have never seen numbers like it, 20 minutes after we opened 
they were still streaming in from Sloane Street,” said Ward.

“Christmas has been particularly strong this year,” he said, highlighting 
solid demand for bags, shoes and diamonds, with Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci 
among the most popular brands.

Ward said Harrods had been insulated from the economic gloom emerging in the UK

 since the Brexit vote.


“The top end of the market is always less affected than anyone else. The 
second [factor] is to an extent London is a bit of a bubble in the UK. So from 
our perspective we’ve got great local customers plus we’ve seen more 
international customers come to London,” he said.

Harrods, like other UK retailers, has benefited from tourist spending since 
the pound’s sharp fall against other currencies after the EU referendum in 
June. The pound’s weakness has meant tourists’ spending money here stretches 
further and official figures show a jump in watch and jewellery sales after the 
Brexit vote.

Ward said the weak pound was only part of the picture in the pickup in 
spending at Harrods by visitors from China, Thailand, Malaysia, the US and the 
Middle East.

“To some extent, it’s the pound being weaker but also London is seen as a much 
safer place to come and shop. So the atrocities in France and in Germany have 
meant that people will centre on London as a destination that they feel safer 
in,” he said.

In Sheffield, the Meadowhall centre was expecting its busiest day of the year 
with 160,000 shoppers on Boxing Day. Its director, Darren Pearce, saidshoppers 
had queued from 2am 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/26/uk-shoppers-brave-boxing-day-sales-westfield>
, six hours before opening time.

Despite some surveys showing a dip in consumer confidence and rising worries 
about inflation, Pearce said the centre had been busy this Christmas.

“The week leading up to Christmas was our busiest of the year, with 
bestselling toys including Nerf Guns, Hatchimals and Lego Star Wars, according 
to our retailers. The parka jacket for men, women and kids has also been a top 
seller,” he said.

“We’ve had a big year on jewellery once again with shoppers making a beeline 
for luxury items … Branded handbags and premium cosmetics … have also been big 
sellers. And vinyl’s making a comeback.”

Selfridges also sought to send an upbeat message about Boxing Day trade and 
said customers were queuing from the early hours for sale items. It took £2m in 
the first hour of trade across its four stores and online.

Intu, the owner, manager and developer of regional shopping centres at sites 
including Braehead, Gateshead and Milton Keynes, also said it was expecting 
heavy footfall.

Gordon McKinnon, operations director at Intu, said: “This morning, we saw 
die-hard shoppers brave the winter cold and queue up early to ensure they had 
first pick of the bargains. Across the UK, we witnessed large queues of 
shoppers all waiting to get their hands on discounted products at the leading 
retailers.”

In Cardiff, the St David’s shopping centre also said it was busy. The general 
manager, Steven Madeley, said: “The mall has been packed with tens of thousands 
of shoppers treating themselves and spending gift cards they’ve received as 
presents.”
