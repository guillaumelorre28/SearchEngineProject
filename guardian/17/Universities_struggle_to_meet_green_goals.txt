UK universities are helping lead the world on environmental research – but 
when it comes to their own back yard they appear to be falling behind.

Only a quarter are on track to meet their carbon reduction targets by 2020. 
Teams leading environmental initiatives are being cut and sustainability 
strategies have not been renewed, according to the results of the2016 People & 
Planet University League <https://peopleandplanet.org/university-league/table>, 
published on Tuesday (see below).

Lack of government support for public sector sustainability is blamed for the 
stalling of energy-saving schemes. It is the fourth year that the league – 
ranking institutions by environmental and ethical performance – has recorded 
fewer universities on course to meet their legally binding target of reducing 
emissions by 43% from 2005 levels by 2020.

But not all have abandoned their green goals, with “first class” status being 
awarded to 30 of the 150 universities. This year Nottingham Trent University, 
which tops the table, opened the Pavilion, its first carbon negative building. 
Brighton University, in second place, has made sustainability one of its four 
core values. The University of Warwick – the biggest mover, up from 129 last 
year to 34th – is launching a unique BASc cross-disciplinary degree in global 
sustainable development.

Nottingham Trent’s high score reflects its commitment to engage staff and 
students, and its aim to include sustainability in all its courses, while the 
University of Brighton has managed to reduce its carbon footprint despite 
expanding in size and opening its buildings for longer hours. “Sustainability 
is a core value in our university,” says Prof Debra Humphris, Brighton’s 
vice-chancellor. “With students and staff we aim to embed sustainable 
practices; we all need to play our part.”

A spokesman for the University of Warwick said its improved showing could be 
partly due to the different way statistics for the league have been collected 
this year. “They may have picked up more of the things we are doing this year, 
such as the bike hire scheme, the £5,000 fund to support student projects, and 
our staff and student green champions initiative,” he said.

The 2016 league table, based on information in the public domain, scores 
institutions on such factors as the commitment of senior management, the 
employment of dedicated sustainability staff, divesting from investment in the 
fossil fuel industry and meeting public sector carbon reduction commitments. It 
also considers employment factors, such as paying staff the living wage, joining
Electronics Watch <http://electronicswatch.org/en/> to improve workers’ rights 
in that industry and investing in projects that do not exploit or pollute 
communities.

Before 2010 and the election of the coalition and the Conservative 
governments, there was a flurry of carbon reduction initiatives linked to 
higher education funding, says People & Planet, a student campaigning network. 
“Sustainability drivers such as the capital investment framework (which made 
tranches of funding contingent on plans to reduce carbon emissions), the higher 
education green academy and the student green fund have all been removed. 
Today, it says, “the landscape looks bereft of any significant support or 
incentive for sustainable development in universities in England.”

“We can now see the concerning impact of the current government’s 
short-termism with regard to energy and climate policy,” says Hannah Smith, 
co-director for campaigns and research. “Environmental sustainability has been 
removed from the government’s annual grant letter setting out higher education 
funding, leaving the Higher Education Funding Council [Hefce] without the 
resources it had in the past to support sustainable practice.”

Wealth and academic prestige appear to be uncorrelated to progress on 
sustainability and ethical employment and procurement. The University of Oxford 
comes 46th and Cambridge 57th.

Grant Anderson, Nottingham Trent’s environmental manager, says that in the 
past, external pressures were useful in engaging senior management in the 
sustainability drive. “These now don’t exist. However, it hasn’t impeded us. We 
continue to expand from an initial focus on carbon, waste, transport etc to a 
more holistic approach, understanding the sustainability opportunities of our 
core business of education and research.

“We made it a formal requirement six months ago that all of our courses 
incorporate at least one of the17 UN sustainable development goals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive>
. We don’t specify what they include, that is up to the academics, but we think 
it will give our students an edge in their careers to have considered some of 
the environmental challenges they will face in their lifetimes. For example, 
chemistry students are exploring their role in finding solutions to feeding the 
world in a sustainable way and primary education students learn practical 
gardening skills at the university’s food share allotments that they will be 
able to share with their future pupils.”

Government policy is likely to continue to have an impact, however – but a 
less positive one. Abigail Dombey, Brighton’s environmental manager, says the 
university has recently installed 893 solar panels, which will save £40,000 a 
year in energy bills and reduce its carbon footprint by more than 100 tonnes a 
year. “But the feed-in tariffs – the financial incentives for generating 
electricity from renewable sources –have been slashed by the government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/08/solar-installation-in-british-homes-falls-by-three-quarters-after-subsidy-cuts>
 so there is much less incentive to invest in renewable energy.”

She fears some universities could also face higher taxes under the business 
rates revaluation from next April through the government’s proposal to increase 
the rateable value of solar panels. As charities, most universities are exempt 
from at least 80% of business rates but some pay 20% and all pay rates on 
buildings used commercially.

The bottom 10 in the green league are mostly small, specialist institutions 
that are less likely to have the resources to employ staff to oversee 
environmental issues. However, the small specialist Royal Agricultural 
University, at 16th in the league, shows that a lot can be achieved on a 
smaller scale.

St Mary’s University in Twickenham, London, with 4,400 students, came in the 
bottom 10 after researchers found it had no environmental policy or strategy, 
no publicly available carbon management plan, ethical investment policy or 
evidence of dedicated sustainability staff. In response, a spokesman said the 
findings were “not reflective of St Mary’s approach to sustainability” and that 
“the university has extensive environmental policies including strategies for 
carbon management, biodiversity and sustainable catering”.

Hefce says its capital investment framework remains in force and requires 
universities and colleges to “demonstrate that their capital investment plans 
are aligned with the goal of managing environmental impact and that they have 
an acceptable carbon management plan in place”. It adds: “The HE sector has 
developed its expertise significantly over the last decade or so and they are 
the real experts in what the sector needs to do to drive sustainability plans 
forward.”

• This article was amended on 22 November 2016 to correct the rankings for 
four universities in the top 20, and to put Bournemouth University at No 20 
rather than Coventry University. The article was also amended to correct a 
reference to the Royal Agricultural College; it has been the Royal Agricultural 
University since 2013.
