Last February, I went to the Preston branch of DW Fitness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness> on a day pass, with a view 
to renewing my previously ended membership. I filled out a membership form with 
the manager, leaving out my bank details.

In the end, I decided that the gym had not improved since I was a member and, 
as a result, I wasn’t going to go back. I told them this on the phone.

In May, I discovered payments had been taken out of my bank account. It seems 
someone at the firm took my bank details from my previous membership and 
activated my account.

I went to the bank to explain what had happened and have been refunded. 
However, now the company has called in debt collectors to chase me.DA, Preston

This is the latest in a long list of complaints we have received about 
DW Fitness – a company that also suffers frompoor online reviews 
<http://www.reviewcentre.com/reviews152574.html>. The complaints to us have 
slowed but continue to come in.

In fairness to the company, it has listened and appears to have taken steps to 
treat customers trying to exit contracts more reasonably.

In this case, it denies your version of events. It says you had paid a joining 
fee in cash, that you had not had your bank details on you and so they were 
pulled off the system and that you signed the form.

It is hard to know what really happened, but what is important is that the 
company has now called off the debt collectors and you are relieved.
