Afternoon summary

 * Michael Gove has been criticised by fellow parliamentarians for being too 
deferential to Donald Trump in his interview with him. The Labour MP Mary 
Creagh told Gove on the BBC‚Äôs Daily Politics: 
You are elected by people in Surrey to represent them and yet you talk about 
your job being to generate news, not to stand up to some of the outrageous 
things Trump has said. There was nothing in your interview about his comments 
on women, which I find disgraceful. I think it creates real questions about 
this second job you have got.

On Twitter Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said:

Seems to me Gove's interview tells us more about Gove's desire for publicity 
than Trump's desire for a trade deal!

And Sayeeda Warsi, the former Conservative party chairman, used Twitter to 
criticise Gove for endorsing someone which such a poor record on issues like 
gender and racial equality.

 * A quick trade deal with the US under Donald Trump could mean harsh 
compromises on issues such as the environment and food safety, campaigners and 
politicians including the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg have warned. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/16/brexit-rush-for-us-trade-deal-could-force-tough-concessions-say-critics>
 * The CBI has said that Britain risks a ‚Äúdisorderly crash landing‚Äù if it 
assumes it can safely walk away from troublesome Brexit talks. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/16/uk-business-leaders-cbi-train-crash-brexit>
Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI‚Äôs director general, spoke out in an interview with 
the Guardian as the Policy Exchange thinktank publisheda report saying the 
government should go for a ‚Äúclean Brexit‚Äù, leaving the single market and the 
customs union. <https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/clean-brexit/>The 
reports authors, economistsGerard Lyons and Liam Halligan, say:

We need key planks of the UK‚Äôs future relationship with the EU to be clear as 
soon as possible. Chief among those is that we must leave the Customs Union and 
the Single Market. Declaring ‚ÄòClean Brexit‚Äô now, and putting it at the 
forefront of our thinking, helps avoid a dramatic policy change overnight for 
which we are unprepared. It offers businesses greater certainty about the 
future. It also means we can walk away from the Article 50 negotiations if the 
EU does not offer us a good enough deal without endangering our economy.

 * Less than a third of voters trust the government‚Äôs so-called ‚ÄúThree 
Brexiteers‚Äù to ‚Äúdo what is right‚Äù regarding Brexit, a poll suggests. As the 
Press Association reports, foreign secretary Boris Johnson (26%), Brexit 
secretary David Davis (24%) and international trade secretary Liam Fox (20%) 
trailed Theresa May in the trust ratings, although she also lacked majority 
support and attracted 36% of support among respondents. In a separate question, 
May‚Äôs trust rating following the EU referendum was 35% compared to 23% for 
Jeremy Corbyn - with the Labour leader having scored 28% in 2016 - while 
Johnson dropped from 43% in 2014 to 24% in 2017.

 * A government review of a Scottish business model has been launched 
following allegations linking it to a $1bn US dollar fraud. 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/review-of-limited-partnership-business-model-launched-following-accusations-of-criminality>
 As the Press Association reports, the UK Government review will examine 
limited partnerships across the country, particularly focusing on Scotland. 
Scottish limited partnerships (SLPs) have their own ‚Äúlegal personality‚Äù 
enabling them to hold assets, borrow money from banks and enter into contracts 
- unlike limited partnerships elsewhere in the UK - which is allegedly leading 
to exploitation by criminals. 
That‚Äôs all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Bercow pays tribute to the late Prof Anthony King

In the Commons the Labour MP Ian Austen used a point of order to pay tribute to
Prof Anthony King, the political scientist and broadcaster who died last week. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/12/anthony-king-face-of-bbc-election-night-coverage-dies-aged-82>
 Austen was taught by him at the University of Essex, and he said that King 
also taughtJohn Bercow, the Speaker, Priti Patel, the international development 
secretary, and the Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. But Bercow was the only one of 
them to get a first, Austen said.

Bercow thanked Austen for raising the issue. He went on:

Colleagues will doubtless have noted that Prof Anthony King died last week, 
aged 82, after a stellar career and vocation as one of the most distinguished 
political scientists of this generation. He was a brilliant teacher. He was an 
outstanding communicator, not least on television in his analysis of 
byelections. And he was a prodigious and illuminating writer. Personally I feel 
every day a sense of gratitude to Tony for what he did for me - and, God, I 
must have been an awkward student to teach 30 years ago - and he stuck with me, 
and I‚Äôm hugely grateful ... Tony King was a great man who did wonders for the 
study and teaching of political science in the United Kingdom and we should 
honour his memory.

Henry McDonald

A potent warning from the student movement in Northern Ireland today about the 
political crisis at Stormont and the collapse of the power sharing government.

Fergal McFerran, president of the National Union of Students/Union of Students 
in Ireland, has said the imminent end of the cross community government would 
convince young educated people from the region never to come back home. 
McFerran said:

Today I am reflecting on the thousands of young people who leave Northern 
Ireland to make a future for themselves elsewhere. The majority of those young 
people will never return. Looking at the state of affairs as they are, why 
would they?

An increasing number of people look to Stormont and see nothing that relates 
to their lives in any meaningful way. We are treading dangerous territory where 
people question the value of devolution and its capacity to improve our 
society. That is an appalling place for us to be.

The Institute for Government thinktank has published a report today calling 
for the tax-making process to be simplified. 
<https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/better-budgets-making-tax-policy-better>
 It supports the government‚Äôs plan to abolish the autumn statement and have 
just one budget statement a year and it says budgets should contain fewer 
measures which are better thought out.

The report includes these charts to justify the IfG‚Äôs claim that new taxes are 
proliferating.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lifted UK growth forecasts for 2017 
saying better-than-expected economic performance in the wake of the Brexit vote 
raised prospects for the year ahead, the Press Association reports.

However, a simultaneous downgrade to the IMF‚Äôs forecast for 2018 is pointing 
to a slowdown in Britain‚Äôs productivity.

In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF said it now expects the UK 
economy to grow by 1.5% this year, marking a 0.4% upward revision to forecasts 
made in October.

The UK is among a number of countries - including the Germany, Japan and Spain 
- to see growth forecasts raised ‚Äúmostly on account of a stronger-than-expected 
performance during the latter part of 2016,‚Äù the report stated.

‚ÄúPreliminary third-quarter growth figures were somewhat stronger than 
previously forecast in some economies, such as Spain and the United Kingdom, 
where domestic demand held up better than expected in the aftermath of the 
Brexit vote.‚Äù

The IMF has downgraded its UK forecasts for 2018 by 0.3%, with gross domestic 
product (GDP) growth for 2018 now expected to come in at 1.4%.


The IMF is also warning that Donald Trump‚Äôs protectionism could be a threat to 
the world economy.

deal with the UK after Brexit while stressing that only limited discussions are 
possible before the departure from the EU is finalised.

an Australian firm.

My colleague Jonathan Freedland has a good article on the Trump/Gove 
interview. Here‚Äôs an excerpt.

Above all, the Gove/Trump encounter provides a useful glimpse into what the 
future of direct media accountability of the US president will look like. You 
can see why Trump Tower granted the former minister his hour. It‚Äôs the same 
reason Trump gives regular access toSean Hannity of Fox News 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news>
. He would prefer to be questioned only by those who are ideological 
sympathisers.

Gove provided regular reassurance of that, seeing no reason to challenge Trump 
on anything. So when the new president slammed the invasion of Iraq, Gove was 
too polite to note that Trump is on tapesupporting that decision 
<http://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/09/30/howard-stern-donald-trump-support-iraq-war-sot-lemon-tonight.cnn>
. (‚ÄúAre you for invading Iraq?‚ÄùTrump was asked 
<http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/19/trump-endorsed-iraq-invasion-in-2002-radio-interview.html>
 on 11 September 2002. His reply: ‚ÄúYeah, I guess so.‚Äù) The MP was similarly 
happy to let the billionaire assert that the EU‚Äôs uselessness was proved by the 
fact that he was blocked from building asea wall to protect a Trump golf course 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/may/26/donald-trump-wants-to-build-a-wall-to-save-his-golf-course-from-global-warming>
 on the Irish coast from the effects of the same climate changeTrump calls a 
‚Äúhoax‚Äù 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/24/donald-trump-bunker-climate-change-views>
.

And here is the piece in full.

ignorance | Jonathan Freedland

No 10 lobby briefing - Summary

Here is a summary of the Number 10 lobby briefing.

 * Downing Street played down the prospects of a trade deal with the US being 
signed as soon as the UK leaves the EU.The prime minister‚Äôs spokeswoman said 
that the government welcomed Trump‚Äôs comments about an early trade deal. But 
she also said that Britain would respect its obligations while it remained a 
member of the EU, and that these prevented EU member states from entering into 
free trade agreements. She said ‚Äúscoping discussions‚Äù about a deal could take 
place before the UK left, but she did not challenge suggestions that these 
would not amount to full trade negotiations. 
 * Number 10 refused to support Trump‚Äôs plan to introduce ‚Äúextreme vetting‚Äù 
for Muslims entering the US. In his Times interview Trump said this policy 
would apply to Muslims entering the country from places with terrorist 
problems. He told the newspaper: 
There will be extreme vetting, it‚Äôs not gonna be like it is now, they don‚Äôt 
even, we don‚Äôt even have real vetting. The vetting into this country is 
essentially non-existent as it is, as it was at least, with your country.

Asked if the UK government supported this, the spokeswoman said there would be 
much greater opportunity to learn about the policies of the new administration 
once Trump takes office. Britain would want to discuss ‚Äúa whole range of 
issues‚Äù with the president then, she said.

 * The spokeswoman indicated that May does not share Trump‚Äôs views about the 
future of the EU.‚ÄúWe want to see a strong, successful European Union,‚Äù the 
spokeswoman said. But Trump is neutral about the survival of the EU (see10.12am)

and he told the Times that he expected other countries to leave and that it 
would be ‚Äúvery hard to keep it together‚Äù. 
 * The spokeswoman said May was not bothered about the fact that Trump had 
shown Michael Gove the letter May sent her at Christmas. May also sent Trump a 
copy of Churchill‚Äôs address to the American people in 1941, after Pearl 
Harbour, and May told Trump what Churchill said in the speech about the ‚Äúunity 
and fraternal association‚Äù between the UK and the US then applied as much 
today. The Times has published a photograph of May‚Äôs letter. Asked about this, 
the spokeswoman said: 
[Trump] was delighted to receive a gift. Often when you are delighted to 
receive a gift, you tell people about it.

 * The spokeswoman hinted that May‚Äôs Brexit speech tomorrow might amount to 
the full Brexit plan promised by the government. In December last year the 
government agreed to publish a plan for Brexit before article 50 is invoked. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/07/brexit-debate-plan-labour-pmqs-call-for-government-to-publish-its-brexit-plan-politics-live?page=with:block-584856cfe4b08659393b9dfc#block-584856cfe4b08659393b9dfc>
 David Davis, the Brexit secretary, tolds MPs thatit would not be published 
before February. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/14/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-david-davis-and-jeremy-corbyn-prepare-for-last-pmqs-of-2016-politics-live?page=with:block-58516ea4e4b09ee2001e8b52#block-58516ea4e4b09ee2001e8b52>
 Many MPs want it to comprise a lengthy white paper, but Davis refused to say 
what form it would take when giving evidence to MPs in December. Asked if the 
government was still planning to publish a plan at some point after May‚Äôs 
speech, the spokeswoman said that May would be setting out more details 
tomorrow and that people should wait for that. The spokeswoman also refused to 
rule out a document of some kind being published alongside the speech tomorrow. 
 * The spokeswoman played down the prospect of ministers or officials 
debriefing Gove to learn more about Trump.The government had ‚Äústrong lines of 
communication‚Äù with Trump already, she said. 
 * Number 10 reaffirmed Philip Hammond‚Äôs threat that the government could 
slash business taxes in the UK if the EU failed to offer a good Brexit deal.
Hammond made this point in an interview with a German newspaper released at the 
weekend. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/15/philip-hammond-suggests-uk-outside-single-market-could-become-tax-haven>
Asked if Theresa May agreed, her spokeswoman said: 
We want to remain in the mainstream of recognisable, European-style taxation 
systems. But if we are forced to do something different if we can‚Äôt get the 
right deal, then we stand ready to do so.

But the spokeswoman rejected claims that Hammond‚Äôs comments amounted to a 
threat to reconfigure the welfare system. In his interview 
<https://www.welt.de/english-news/article161182946/Philip-Hammond-issues-threat-to-EU-partners.html>
 Hammond said:

We are on the US end of the European spectrum, but we do have an open-market 
economy with a social model that is recognisably the European social model that 
is recognisably in the mainstream of European norms, not US norms. And most of 
us who had voted remain would like the UK to remain a recognisably 
European-style economy with European-style taxation systems, European-style 
regulation systems etcetera. I personally hope we will be able to remain in the 
mainstream of European economic and social thinking. But if we are forced to be 
something different, then we will have to become something different.

But the spokeswoman said that it would be wrong to read what Hammond said as 
applying to welfare.

 * The spokeswoman refused to say what May thought about the fact that three 
of her Brexit interventions have led to falls in the value of the pound.(See 
9.08am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/16/trump-wants-a-uk-us-trade-deal-signature-ready-for-brexit-in-2019-says-gove-politics-live?page=with:block-587c8c09e4b0f10ba20b8bad#block-587c8c09e4b0f10ba20b8bad>
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a long-standing policy of not commenting on the currency,‚Äù the 
spokeswoman said. She also refused to confirm reports saying some in Number 10 
expect her speech to lead to what they call a ‚Äúmarket correction‚Äù (ie, a 
devaluation). 
 * May spoke to Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland‚Äôs first minister, and Martin 
McGuinness, her Sinn Fein deputy, this morning about the crisis affecting the 
Northern Ireland assembly, the spokeswoman said.The spokeswoman said May 
‚Äúwanted to encourage them to take what time is left today to try to find a 
resolution‚Äù. 
 * The spokeswoman said that the NHS plans to increase the amount it recovers 
from foreigners who are treated in hospitals in this country. Some ¬£289m a year 
is recovered now, and this is due to go up to ¬£500m by the middle of this 
parliament, she said. This question was prompted bythe story about a hospital 
being left with a bill for ¬£350,000 after it treated a Nigerian woman who had 
complications when giving birth to twins. 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nhs-left-unpaid-bill-350000-9631294> 
 * Britain has raised concerns with the authorities in Bahrain over the 
execution of three men found guilty of a deadly bomb attack on police in the 
Gulf state, the spokeswoman said.The execution by firing squad of the Shiite 
men on Sunday has been condemned by human rights groups and sparked outrage 
among opponents of the Sunni-ruled government. Asked about this, the 
spokeswoman said: 
Clearly, we have concerns about the situation there. We are firmly opposed to 
the death penalty. The foreign secretary [Boris Johnson] raised this specific 
issue with the Bahrain government in a phone call ahead of the weekend.

Richard Tice, the co-chair of Leave Means Leave, has just told BBC News that 
it is ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù, legally and practically, for Number 10 to argue that the UK

No 10 plays down prospect of UK-US trade deal being ready for when Brexit 
happens

I‚Äôm just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. These are probably the two 
best lines.

 * Number 10 reaffirmed Philip Hammond‚Äôs threat that the government could 
slash business taxes in the UK if the EU failed to offer a good Brexit deal. 
 * Downing Street played down the prospects of a trade deal with the US being 
signed as soon as the UK leaves the EU. 
UPDATE: There is now a full summary of the lobby briefing here, at 1.13pm.

Greens criticise Corbyn over nuclear power U-turn

During the 2015 Labour leadership campaign Jeremy Corbyn said he was opposed 
to building new nuclear power stations. 
<http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2978777/jeremy_corbyn_the_green_britain_i_want_to_build.html>
 But this stance creates problems for Labour in the Copeland byelection 
(Sellafield is the most important employer in Copeland) and in an interview 
with Andrew Marr yesterday (pdf) 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/15011702.pdf> Corbyn shifted his 
stance, indicating that he would back plans for a new nuclear power station in 
the constituency at Moorside. He told Marr:

I want to make sure there‚Äôs an energy mix in this country. We have to first of 
all make sure there is sufficient energy supplies and there has to be an energy 
platform. So what happens in Moorfield is pretty key to ensuring that actually 
happens.

This morning the Green party has attacked him for this. Jonathan Bartley, the 
Green party <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/green-party> co-leader, said:

Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs defeatist attitude will no doubt be a massive disappointment 
to the many people across the country who don‚Äôt believe that dirty, expensive 
nuclear power is the way forward. We know that alternatives to nuclear exist ‚Äì 
and that renewable power will provide more jobs than this redundant technology 
of the past.

Labour‚Äôs U-turn leaves the Greens as the only party who will be fielding an 
anti-nuclear candidate in the Copeland by-election. We‚Äôll have our plans for a 
clean energy revolution at the heart of our campaign, as well as protecting the 
NHS and maintaining a close relationship withEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

I‚Äôm off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am.

it as a book on how to fight terrorism. Trump replied:

Good, I‚Äôd love that. That‚Äôs fantastic - how to fight terrorism. I can use that.

Gove's interviews about Trump - Summary

Michael Gove has given several interviews this morning about his Trump 
interview. Here are the key points he has been making.

 * Gove said that Donald Trump wanted a UK-US trade deal ‚Äúsignature ready‚Äù for 
when Britain left the EU in 2019.(See 8.55pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/16/trump-wants-a-uk-us-trade-deal-signature-ready-for-brexit-in-2019-says-gove-politics-live?page=with:block-587c8432e4b0f10ba20b8b9f#block-587c8432e4b0f10ba20b8b9f>
 * Gove said he believed an expert analysis saying a UK-US trade deal could 
increase jobs and growth ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù. 
I‚Äôve been impressed by work that has been done by Shanker Singham of the 
Legatum Institute [a thinktank] who is probably at the moment in Britain the 
leading expert on trade deals, and he‚Äôs pointed out that it would be possible 
for Britain to conclude a deal not just with America but with other countries 
like New Zealand, whose prime minster was here recently ... Shanker Singham has 
concluded that such a deal could increase Britain‚Äôs GDP and jobs and growth 
significantly. There are some experts whom one does not automatically follow, 
but I‚Äôm inclined to believe that Shanker Singham and the work the Legatum 
Institute has done points the way to a successful trade relationship between 
Britain and other countries.

In his final sentence he is alluding to his famous comment about Britain 
having had enough of experts who get things wrong.

 * Gove said Trump a proprietorial interest in Brexit. 
He feels a sort of sense of ownership of our decision to leave the European 
Union, because he predicted it and he was one of the few international figures 
to back our leaving theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. 
Now he says that he wants to make a success of it.

 * Gove played down the fact that Trump refused to say yes when Gove put it to 
him that the UK would be in the front of the queue for a trade deal with the US 
after Brexit.Trump said it was a mistake for President Obama to say the UK 
would be at the back of the queue. Gove then put it to him that the UK would be 
at the front of the queue. Trump replied: ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre doing great. I think 
it‚Äôs going great.‚Äù When it was put to him that this did not sound like a yes, 
Gove replied:

One of the things about interviewing President Trump is that he does not like 
anyone putting words into his mouth. So when you ask a question, it‚Äôs as much a 
prompt to the next flow of information and rhetoric as anything else.

Gove also said it thought it was possible to ‚Äúread what it is that [Trump] 
wants. When asked if he felt he could trust Trump, he replied: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt make a 
window into Donald Trump‚Äôs soul. But what I can tell is that was enthusiastic 
about Brexit.‚Äù

 * Gove said he did not believe that Trump wanted to destabilise the EU. When 
asked if he thought this was Trump‚Äôs intention, he said no. But he also implied 
that he thought Trump was neutral about whether the EU survived. Until now, 
American administrations have always supported the EU. But Gove said: 
We asked Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> what 
his view as directly about the European Union. Did he believe that it was 
better for America for there to be a strong European Union or stronger 
individual nation states? And he said that, in a sense, that he did not have a 
strong view either way about the future of Europe from America‚Äôs point of view. 
He said specifically that he felt that the European Union had been created in 
order to have a rival trade bloc to America. But he concentrates on what‚Äôs 
right for America.

 * Gove dismissed suggestions that he could be Britain‚Äôs next ambassador to 
Washington.When this was put to him by Today‚Äôs Sarah Montague, he laughed. Then 
he went on: 
I think you can probably tell from my instinctive reaction to that that, 
wonderful though the Foreign Office is, it is probably better off without me as 
one of its ambassadors. We have got Kim Darroch doing a fantastic job in 
Washington, by all accounts. Certainly, from the encounters I have had with 
him, he is a first-class diplomat.

<https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/820922792858320896> 
 * Gove said that he thought Theresa May was doing an ‚Äúexemplary job‚Äù as prime 
minister. He said they last spoke in a private meeting before Christmas. Gove 
would not say what they said to each other. 
 * He said he did not agree with Trump‚Äôs claim that the EU refugee crisis was 
the reason for people voting to leave the EU. He said he thought Lord 
Ashcroft‚Äôs analysis 
<http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/> 
explained best why people voted for Brexit. 
 * Gove said that, while he could not defend some of the things Trump has said 
and done, he found him an ‚Äúengaging‚Äù personality. He said Trump was a ‚Äúbig, 
bombastic personality‚Äù. 
When you actually meet him, yes he is an electric figure - charismatic - but 
also he is warmer ... close up than you would imagine.

 * Gove said Trump was a deal-maker who wanted the best deal for both sides. 
Everything that he says is in capital letters and in glowing gold, but then he 
also, when he gets into the room, looks at the spreadsheet and tries to get the 
best possible outcome for both sides ... He is a businessman. The important 
thing about any world leader dealing with Donald Trump is to think ‚ÄòHow can I 
get a deal that suits us both?‚Äô.

 * He said Trump had a ‚Äúsoft spot‚Äù for Britain. 
His mum comes from Scotland and he has a soft spot for Scotland particularly 
but Britain generally.

Pound falls in value ahead of Theresa May's Brexit speech tomorrow

Theresa May is giving a speech on Brexit tomorrow and advance briefing 
suggests it will firm up suggestions that the UK will be leaving the single 
market and the customs unions.For at least the third time,

Trump wants a UK-US trade deal 'signature ready' for Brexit in 2019, says Gove

Unless you have managed to avoid all news this morning, you‚Äôll know by now that
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has given an 
interview to the Times and that it was conducted byMichael Gove, the former 
justice secretary and former Vote Leave leader who was sacked by Theresa May 
when she became prime minister. This is how the Times has presented.

Donald Trump's first UK post-election interview: Brexit a 'great thing'
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/15/trumps-first-uk-post-election-interview-brexit-a-great-thing>
Gove has been giving interviews this morning and, on the Today programme, he 
firmed up the line that Trump wants to negotiate a trade deal with the UK 
quickly. The president-elect wanted a deal that would be ‚Äúsignature ready‚Äù by 
2019, when the UK is due to leave the EU, Gove said. (The UK cannot sign one 
while it is still a member.) Gove said:

Judging from both the interview and also from the conversation that we had off 
the record, he wants to seeTheresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> as quickly as possible, he 
wants to invite her to the White House as quickly as possible, and then lay the 
groundwork for a deal.

My understanding - I have to stress I‚Äôm no expert in trade negotiations - is 
that we have to wait until Britain has concluded its divorce from the European 
Union before we can sign any new deal. But I think the president-elect wants to 
have something signature ready at the earliest possible opportunity, and I 
think there are two reasons for that. Firstly, he sees real economic benefits 
for both Britain and America in forging this deal. The other things is that he 
feels a certain, what‚Äôs the word, sympathy for Britain as a result of our 
decision to leave theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

I will post more from Gove‚Äôs interview soon. Meanwhile, here is a Guardian 
summary of what Trump said in the interview.

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/15/trumps-first-uk-post-election-interview-brexit-a-great-thing>

May is due to deliver her big speech on Brexit tomorrow, but we‚Äôve got a 
Number 10 lobby briefing at 11am, and so we should get some reaction to Trump 
then. Otherwise, the diary is relatively empty.

As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as 
bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to 
post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon.

I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read 
them all. If you have a direct question, do include ‚ÄúAndrew‚Äù in it somewhere 
and I‚Äôm more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although 
sometimes I miss them or don‚Äôt have time. Alternatively you could post a 
question to me on Twitter.

 * Michael Gove has been criticised by fellow parliamentarians for being too 
deferential to Donald Trump in his interview with him. The Labour MP Mary 
Creagh told Gove on the BBC‚Äôs Daily Politics: 
You are elected by people in Surrey to represent them and yet you talk about 
your job being to generate news, not to stand up to some of the outrageous 
things Trump has said. There was nothing in your interview about his comments 
on women, which I find disgraceful. I think it creates real questions about 
this second job you have got.

On Twitter Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said:
Barry Gardiner (@BarryGardiner) 
Seems to me Gove's interview tells us more about Gove's desire for publicity 
than Trump's desire for a trade deal!

And Sayeeda Warsi, the former Conservative party chairman, used Twitter to 
criticise Gove for endorsing someone which such a poor record on issues like 
gender and racial equality.

 * A quick trade deal with the US under Donald Trump could mean harsh 
compromises on issues such as the environment and food safety, campaigners and 
politicians including the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg have warned. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/16/brexit-rush-for-us-trade-deal-could-force-tough-concessions-say-critics>
 * The CBI has said that Britain risks a ‚Äúdisorderly crash landing‚Äù if it 
assumes it can safely walk away from troublesome Brexit talks. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/16/uk-business-leaders-cbi-train-crash-brexit>
Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI‚Äôs director general, spoke out in an interview with 
the Guardian as the Policy Exchange thinktank publisheda report saying the 
government should go for a ‚Äúclean Brexit‚Äù, leaving the single market and the 
customs union. <https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/clean-brexit/>The 
reports authors, economistsGerard Lyons and Liam Halligan, say:

We need key planks of the UK‚Äôs future relationship with the EU to be clear as 
soon as possible. Chief among those is that we must leave the Customs Union and 
the Single Market. Declaring ‚ÄòClean Brexit‚Äô now, and putting it at the 
forefront of our thinking, helps avoid a dramatic policy change overnight for 
which we are unprepared. It offers businesses greater certainty about the 
future. It also means we can walk away from the Article 50 negotiations if the 
EU does not offer us a good enough deal without endangering our economy.

 * Less than a third of voters trust the government‚Äôs so-called ‚ÄúThree 
Brexiteers‚Äù to ‚Äúdo what is right‚Äù regarding Brexit, a poll suggests. As the 
Press Association reports, foreign secretary Boris Johnson (26%), Brexit 
secretary David Davis (24%) and international trade secretary Liam Fox (20%) 
trailed Theresa May in the trust ratings, although she also lacked majority 
support and attracted 36% of support among respondents. In a separate question, 
May‚Äôs trust rating following the EU referendum was 35% compared to 23% for 
Jeremy Corbyn - with the Labour leader having scored 28% in 2016 - while 
Johnson dropped from 43% in 2014 to 24% in 2017.

 * A government review of a Scottish business model has been launched 
following allegations linking it to a $1bn US dollar fraud. 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/review-of-limited-partnership-business-model-launched-following-accusations-of-criminality>
 As the Press Association reports, the UK Government review will examine 
limited partnerships across the country, particularly focusing on Scotland. 
Scottish limited partnerships (SLPs) have their own ‚Äúlegal personality‚Äù 
enabling them to hold assets, borrow money from banks and enter into contracts 
- unlike limited partnerships elsewhere in the UK - which is allegedly leading 
to exploitation by criminals. 
That‚Äôs all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
In the Commons the Labour MP Ian Austen used a point of order to pay tribute to
Prof Anthony King, the political scientist and broadcaster who died last week. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/12/anthony-king-face-of-bbc-election-night-coverage-dies-aged-82>
 Austen was taught by him at the University of Essex, and he said that King 
also taughtJohn Bercow, the Speaker, Priti Patel, the international development 
secretary, and the Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. But Bercow was the only one of 
them to get a first, Austen said.

Bercow thanked Austen for raising the issue. He went on:

Colleagues will doubtless have noted that Prof Anthony King died last week, 
aged 82, after a stellar career and vocation as one of the most distinguished 
political scientists of this generation. He was a brilliant teacher. He was an 
outstanding communicator, not least on television in his analysis of 
byelections. And he was a prodigious and illuminating writer. Personally I feel 
every day a sense of gratitude to Tony for what he did for me - and, God, I 
must have been an awkward student to teach 30 years ago - and he stuck with me, 
and I‚Äôm hugely grateful ... Tony King was a great man who did wonders for the 
study and teaching of political science in the United Kingdom and we should 
honour his memory.

A potent warning from the student movement in Northern Ireland today about the 
political crisis at Stormont and the collapse of the power sharing government.

Fergal McFerran, president of the National Union of Students/Union of Students 
in Ireland, has said the imminent end of the cross community government would 
convince young educated people from the region never to come back home. 
McFerran said:

Today I am reflecting on the thousands of young people who leave Northern 
Ireland to make a future for themselves elsewhere. The majority of those young 
people will never return. Looking at the state of affairs as they are, why 
would they?

An increasing number of people look to Stormont and see nothing that relates 
to their lives in any meaningful way. We are treading dangerous territory where 
people question the value of devolution and its capacity to improve our 
society. That is an appalling place for us to be.
 
The Institute for Government thinktank has published a report today calling 
for the tax-making process to be simplified. 
<https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/better-budgets-making-tax-policy-better>
 It supports the government‚Äôs plan to abolish the autumn statement and have 
just one budget statement a year and it says budgets should contain fewer 
measures which are better thought out.

The report includes these charts to justify the IfG‚Äôs claim that new taxes are 
proliferating.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lifted UK growth forecasts for 2017 
saying better-than-expected economic performance in the wake of the Brexit vote 
raised prospects for the year ahead, the Press Association reports.

However, a simultaneous downgrade to the IMF‚Äôs forecast for 2018 is pointing 
to a slowdown in Britain‚Äôs productivity.

In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF said it now expects the UK 
economy to grow by 1.5% this year, marking a 0.4% upward revision to forecasts 
made in October.

The UK is among a number of countries - including the Germany, Japan and Spain 
- to see growth forecasts raised ‚Äúmostly on account of a stronger-than-expected 
performance during the latter part of 2016,‚Äù the report stated.

‚ÄúPreliminary third-quarter growth figures were somewhat stronger than 
previously forecast in some economies, such as Spain and the United Kingdom, 
where domestic demand held up better than expected in the aftermath of the 
Brexit vote.‚Äù

The IMF has downgraded its UK forecasts for 2018 by 0.3%, with gross domestic 
product (GDP) growth for 2018 now expected to come in at 1.4%.


The IMF is also warning that Donald Trump‚Äôs protectionism could be a threat to 
the world economy.

leant from the Trump/Gove interview.

My colleague Jonathan Freedland has a good article on the Trump/Gove 
interview. Here‚Äôs an excerpt.

Above all, the Gove/Trump encounter provides a useful glimpse into what the 
future of direct media accountability of the US president will look like. You 
can see why Trump Tower granted the former minister his hour. It‚Äôs the same 
reason Trump gives regular access toSean Hannity of Fox News 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news>
. He would prefer to be questioned only by those who are ideological 
sympathisers.

Gove provided regular reassurance of that, seeing no reason to challenge Trump 
on anything. So when the new president slammed the invasion of Iraq, Gove was 
too polite to note that Trump is on tapesupporting that decision 
<http://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/09/30/howard-stern-donald-trump-support-iraq-war-sot-lemon-tonight.cnn>

<http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/19/trump-endorsed-iraq-invasion-in-2002-radio-interview.html>
 on 11 September 2002. His reply: ‚ÄúYeah, I guess so.‚Äù) The MP was similarly 
happy to let the billionaire assert that the EU‚Äôs uselessness was proved by the 
fact that he was blocked from building asea wall to protect a Trump golf course

2017 <https://twitter.com/daily_politics/status/820976683620544513>  
Here is a summary of the Number 10 lobby briefing.

 * Downing Street played down the prospects of a trade deal with the US being 
signed as soon as the UK leaves the EU.The prime minister‚Äôs spokeswoman said 
that the government welcomed Trump‚Äôs comments about an early trade deal. But 
she also said that Britain would respect its obligations while it remained a 
member of the EU, and that these prevented EU member states from entering into 
free trade agreements. She said ‚Äúscoping discussions‚Äù about a deal could take 
place before the UK left, but she did not challenge suggestions that these 
would not amount to full trade negotiations. 
 * Number 10 refused to support Trump‚Äôs plan to introduce ‚Äúextreme vetting‚Äù 
for Muslims entering the US. In his Times interview Trump said this policy 
would apply to Muslims entering the country from places with terrorist 
problems. He told the newspaper: 
There will be extreme vetting, it‚Äôs not gonna be like it is now, they don‚Äôt 
even, we don‚Äôt even have real vetting. The vetting into this country is 
essentially non-existent as it is, as it was at least, with your country.

Asked if the UK government supported this, the spokeswoman said there would be 
much greater opportunity to learn about the policies of the new administration 
once Trump takes office. Britain would want to discuss ‚Äúa whole range of 
issues‚Äù with the president then, she said.

 * The spokeswoman indicated that May does not share Trump‚Äôs views about the 
future of the EU.‚ÄúWe want to see a strong, successful European Union,‚Äù the 
spokeswoman said. But Trump is neutral about the survival of the EU (see10.12am)
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/16/trump-wants-a-uk-us-trade-deal-signature-ready-for-brexit-in-2019-says-gove-politics-live?page=with:block-587c8fdae4b0f10ba20b8bb8#block-587c8fdae4b0f10ba20b8bb8>
and he told the Times that he expected other countries to leave and that it 
would be ‚Äúvery hard to keep it together‚Äù. 
 * The spokeswoman said May was not bothered about the fact that Trump had 
shown Michael Gove the letter May sent her at Christmas. May also sent Trump a 
copy of Churchill‚Äôs address to the American people in 1941, after Pearl 
Harbour, and May told Trump what Churchill said in the speech about the ‚Äúunity 
and fraternal association‚Äù between the UK and the US then applied as much 
today. The Times has published a photograph of May‚Äôs letter. Asked about this, 
the spokeswoman said: 
[Trump] was delighted to receive a gift. Often when you are delighted to 
receive a gift, you tell people about it.

 * The spokeswoman hinted that May‚Äôs Brexit speech tomorrow might amount to 
the full Brexit plan promised by the government. In December last year the 
government agreed to publish a plan for Brexit before article 50 is invoked. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/07/brexit-debate-plan-labour-pmqs-call-for-government-to-publish-its-brexit-plan-politics-live?page=with:block-584856cfe4b08659393b9dfc#block-584856cfe4b08659393b9dfc>
 David Davis, the Brexit secretary, tolds MPs thatit would not be published 
before February. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/14/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-david-davis-and-jeremy-corbyn-prepare-for-last-pmqs-of-2016-politics-live?page=with:block-58516ea4e4b09ee2001e8b52#block-58516ea4e4b09ee2001e8b52>
 Many MPs want it to comprise a lengthy white paper, but Davis refused to say 
what form it would take when giving evidence to MPs in December. Asked if the 
government was still planning to publish a plan at some point after May‚Äôs 
speech, the spokeswoman said that May would be setting out more details 
tomorrow and that people should wait for that. The spokeswoman also refused to 
rule out a document of some kind being published alongside the speech tomorrow. 
 * The spokeswoman played down the prospect of ministers or officials 
debriefing Gove to learn more about Trump.The government had ‚Äústrong lines of 
communication‚Äù with Trump already, she said. 
 * Number 10 reaffirmed Philip Hammond‚Äôs threat that the government could 
slash business taxes in the UK if the EU failed to offer a good Brexit deal.
Hammond made this point in an interview with a German newspaper released at the 
weekend. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/15/philip-hammond-suggests-uk-outside-single-market-could-become-tax-haven>
Asked if Theresa May agreed, her spokeswoman said: 
We want to remain in the mainstream of recognisable, European-style taxation 
systems. But if we are forced to do something different if we can‚Äôt get the 
right deal, then we stand ready to do so.

But the spokeswoman rejected claims that Hammond‚Äôs comments amounted to a 
threat to reconfigure the welfare system. In his interview 
<https://www.welt.de/english-news/article161182946/Philip-Hammond-issues-threat-to-EU-partners.html>
 Hammond said:

We are on the US end of the European spectrum, but we do have an open-market 
economy with a social model that is recognisably the European social model that 
is recognisably in the mainstream of European norms, not US norms. And most of 
us who had voted remain would like the UK to remain a recognisably 
European-style economy with European-style taxation systems, European-style 
regulation systems etcetera. I personally hope we will be able to remain in the 
mainstream of European economic and social thinking. But if we are forced to be 
something different, then we will have to become something different.

But the spokeswoman said that it would be wrong to read what Hammond said as 
applying to welfare.

 * The spokeswoman refused to say what May thought about the fact that three 
of her Brexit interventions have led to falls in the value of the pound.(See 
9.08am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/16/trump-wants-a-uk-us-trade-deal-signature-ready-for-brexit-in-2019-says-gove-politics-live?page=with:block-587c8c09e4b0f10ba20b8bad#block-587c8c09e4b0f10ba20b8bad>
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a long-standing policy of not commenting on the currency,‚Äù the 
spokeswoman said. She also refused to confirm reports saying some in Number 10 
expect her speech to lead to what they call a ‚Äúmarket correction‚Äù (ie, a 
devaluation). 
 * May spoke to Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland‚Äôs first minister, and Martin 
McGuinness, her Sinn Fein deputy, this morning about the crisis affecting the 
Northern Ireland assembly, the spokeswoman said.The spokeswoman said May 
‚Äúwanted to encourage them to take what time is left today to try to find a 
resolution‚Äù. 
 * The spokeswoman said that the NHS plans to increase the amount it recovers 
from foreigners who are treated in hospitals in this country. Some ¬£289m a year 
is recovered now, and this is due to go up to ¬£500m by the middle of this 
parliament, she said. This question was prompted bythe story about a hospital 
being left with a bill for ¬£350,000 after it treated a Nigerian woman who had 
complications when giving birth to twins. 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nhs-left-unpaid-bill-350000-9631294> 
 * Britain has raised concerns with the authorities in Bahrain over the 
execution of three men found guilty of a deadly bomb attack on police in the 
Gulf state, the spokeswoman said.The execution by firing squad of the Shiite 
men on Sunday has been condemned by human rights groups and sparked outrage 
among opponents of the Sunni-ruled government. Asked about this, the 
spokeswoman said: 
Clearly, we have concerns about the situation there. We are firmly opposed to 
the death penalty. The foreign secretary [Boris Johnson] raised this specific 
issue with the Bahrain government in a phone call ahead of the weekend.

Richard Tice, the co-chair of Leave Means Leave, has just told BBC News that 
it is ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù, legally and practically, for Number 10 to argue that the UK 
cannot start formal trade talks with the US while it remains a member of the EU.
 
I‚Äôm just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. These are probably the two 
best lines.

 * Number 10 reaffirmed Philip Hammond‚Äôs threat that the government could 
slash business taxes in the UK if the EU failed to offer a good Brexit deal. 
 * Downing Street played down the prospects of a trade deal with the US being 
signed as soon as the UK leaves the EU. 
UPDATE: There is now a full summary of the lobby briefing here, at 1.13pm.

During the 2015 Labour leadership campaign Jeremy Corbyn said he was opposed 
to building new nuclear power stations. 
<http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2978777/jeremy_corbyn_the_green_britain_i_want_to_build.html>
 But this stance creates problems for Labour in the Copeland byelection 
(Sellafield is the most important employer in Copeland) and in an interview 
with Andrew Marr yesterday (pdf) 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/15011702.pdf> Corbyn shifted his 
stance, indicating that he would back plans for a new nuclear power station in 
the constituency at Moorside. He told Marr:

I want to make sure there‚Äôs an energy mix in this country. We have to first of 
all make sure there is sufficient energy supplies and there has to be an energy 
platform. So what happens in Moorfield is pretty key to ensuring that actually 
happens.

This morning the Green party has attacked him for this. Jonathan Bartley, the 
Green party <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/green-party> co-leader, said:

Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs defeatist attitude will no doubt be a massive disappointment 
to the many people across the country who don‚Äôt believe that dirty, expensive 
nuclear power is the way forward. We know that alternatives to nuclear exist ‚Äì 
and that renewable power will provide more jobs than this redundant technology 
of the past.

Labour‚Äôs U-turn leaves the Greens as the only party who will be fielding an 
anti-nuclear candidate in the Copeland by-election. We‚Äôll have our plans for a 
clean energy revolution at the heart of our campaign, as well as protecting the 
NHS and maintaining a close relationship withEurope

I‚Äôm off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am.
 
The full transcript of Michael Gove‚Äôs interview with Donald Trump which has 
gone upon the Times‚Äô website (paywall)  
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/full-transcript-of-interview-with-donald-trump-5d39sr09d>
shows that Gove gave the president-elect a copy of his book Celsius 7/7 about 
Islamist extremism. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius_7/7> Gove described 
it as a book on how to fight terrorism. Trump replied:

Good, I‚Äôd love that. That‚Äôs fantastic - how to fight terrorism. I can use that.
 
Michael Gove has given several interviews this morning about his Trump 
interview. Here are the key points he has been making.

 * Gove said that Donald Trump wanted a UK-US trade deal ‚Äúsignature ready‚Äù for 
when Britain left the EU in 2019.(See 8.55pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/16/trump-wants-a-uk-us-trade-deal-signature-ready-for-brexit-in-2019-says-gove-politics-live?page=with:block-587c8432e4b0f10ba20b8b9f#block-587c8432e4b0f10ba20b8b9f>
 * Gove said he believed an expert analysis saying a UK-US trade deal could 
increase jobs and growth ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù. 
I‚Äôve been impressed by work that has been done by Shanker Singham of the 
Legatum Institute [a thinktank] who is probably at the moment in Britain the 
leading expert on trade deals, and he‚Äôs pointed out that it would be possible 
for Britain to conclude a deal not just with America but with other countries 
like New Zealand, whose prime minster was here recently ... Shanker Singham has 
concluded that such a deal could increase Britain‚Äôs GDP and jobs and growth 
significantly. There are some experts whom one does not automatically follow, 
but I‚Äôm inclined to believe that Shanker Singham and the work the Legatum 
Institute has done points the way to a successful trade relationship between 
Britain and other countries.

In his final sentence he is alluding to his famous comment about Britain 
having had enough of experts who get things wrong.

 * Gove said Trump a proprietorial interest in Brexit. 
He feels a sort of sense of ownership of our decision to leave the European 
Union, because he predicted it and he was one of the few international figures 
to back our leaving theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. 
Now he says that he wants to make a success of it.

 * Gove played down the fact that Trump refused to say yes when Gove put it to 
him that the UK would be in the front of the queue for a trade deal with the US 
after Brexit.Trump said it was a mistake for President Obama to say the UK 
would be at the back of the queue. Gove then put it to him that the UK would be 
at the front of the queue. Trump replied: ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre doing great. I think 
it‚Äôs going great.‚Äù When it was put to him that this did not sound like a yes, 
Gove replied:

One of the things about interviewing President Trump is that he does not like 
anyone putting words into his mouth. So when you ask a question, it‚Äôs as much a 
prompt to the next flow of information and rhetoric as anything else.

Gove also said it thought it was possible to ‚Äúread what it is that [Trump] 
wants. When asked if he felt he could trust Trump, he replied: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt make a 
window into Donald Trump‚Äôs soul. But what I can tell is that was enthusiastic 
about Brexit.‚Äù

 * Gove said he did not believe that Trump wanted to destabilise the EU. When 
asked if he thought this was Trump‚Äôs intention, he said no. But he also implied 
that he thought Trump was neutral about whether the EU survived. Until now, 
American administrations have always supported the EU. But Gove said: 
We asked Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> what 
his view as directly about the European Union. Did he believe that it was 
better for America for there to be a strong European Union or stronger 
individual nation states? And he said that, in a sense, that he did not have a 
strong view either way about the future of Europe from America‚Äôs point of view. 
He said specifically that he felt that the European Union had been created in 
order to have a rival trade bloc to America. But he concentrates on what‚Äôs 
right for America.

 * Gove dismissed suggestions that he could be Britain‚Äôs next ambassador to 
Washington.When this was put to him by Today‚Äôs Sarah Montague, he laughed. Then 
he went on: 
I think you can probably tell from my instinctive reaction to that that, 
wonderful though the Foreign Office is, it is probably better off without me as 
one of its ambassadors. We have got Kim Darroch doing a fantastic job in 
Washington, by all accounts. Certainly, from the encounters I have had with 
him, he is a first-class diplomat.

 * Gove said that he thought Theresa May was doing an ‚Äúexemplary job‚Äù as prime 
minister. He said they last spoke in a private meeting before Christmas. Gove 
would not say what they said to each other. 
 * He said he did not agree with Trump‚Äôs claim that the EU refugee crisis was 
the reason for people voting to leave the EU. He said he thought Lord 
Ashcroft‚Äôs analysis 
<http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/> 
explained best why people voted for Brexit. 
 * Gove said that, while he could not defend some of the things Trump has said 
and done, he found him an ‚Äúengaging‚Äù personality. He said Trump was a ‚Äúbig, 
bombastic personality‚Äù. 
When you actually meet him, yes he is an electric figure - charismatic - but 
also he is warmer ... close up than you would imagine.

 * Gove said Trump was a deal-maker who wanted the best deal for both sides. 
Everything that he says is in capital letters and in glowing gold, but then he 
also, when he gets into the room, looks at the spreadsheet and tries to get the 
best possible outcome for both sides ... He is a businessman. The important 
thing about any world leader dealing with Donald Trump is to think ‚ÄòHow can I 
get a deal that suits us both?‚Äô.

 * He said Trump had a ‚Äúsoft spot‚Äù for Britain. 
His mum comes from Scotland and he has a soft spot for Scotland particularly 
but Britain generally.

Theresa May is giving a speech on Brexit tomorrow and advance briefing 
suggests it will firm up suggestions that the UK will be leaving the single 
market and the customs unions.For at least the third time,

Unless you have managed to avoid all news this morning, you‚Äôll know by now that
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has given an 
interview to the Times and that it was conducted byMichael Gove, the former 
justice secretary and former Vote Leave leader who was sacked by Theresa May 
when she became prime minister. This is how the Times has presented.

Donald Trump's first UK post-election interview: Brexit a 'great thing'
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/15/trumps-first-uk-post-election-interview-brexit-a-great-thing>
Gove has been giving interviews this morning and, on the Today programme, he 
firmed up the line that Trump wants to negotiate a trade deal with the UK 
quickly. The president-elect wanted a deal that would be ‚Äúsignature ready‚Äù by 
2019, when the UK is due to leave the EU, Gove said. (The UK cannot sign one 
while it is still a member.) Gove said:

Judging from both the interview and also from the conversation that we had off 
the record, he wants to seeTheresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> as quickly as possible, he 
wants to invite her to the White House as quickly as possible, and then lay the 
groundwork for a deal.

My understanding - I have to stress I‚Äôm no expert in trade negotiations - is 
that we have to wait until Britain has concluded its divorce from the European 
Union before we can sign any new deal. But I think the president-elect wants to 
have something signature ready at the earliest possible opportunity, and I 
think there are two reasons for that. Firstly, he sees real economic benefits 
for both Britain and America in forging this deal. The other things is that he 
feels a certain, what‚Äôs the word, sympathy for Britain as a result of our 
decision to leave theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

I will post more from Gove‚Äôs interview soon. Meanwhile, here is a Guardian 
summary of what Trump said in the interview. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/16/the-trump-interviews-what-he-said-about-brexit-putin-israel-syria-and-twitter>

May is due to deliver her big speech on Brexit tomorrow, but we‚Äôve got a 
Number 10 lobby briefing at 11am, and so we should get some reaction to Trump 
then. Otherwise, the diary is relatively empty.

As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as 
bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to 
post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon.
