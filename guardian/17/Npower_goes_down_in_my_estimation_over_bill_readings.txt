When I moved in July I gave gas and electricity readings to npower. The 
electricity reading was significantly less than npower’s previous estimate, 
while the gas reading was higher.

However, the final electricity bill used the estimate, which was higher than 
the supplied reading, while the gas bill went with the meter reading, which was 
higher than the estimate.

This statement showed I was in credit by £37.99. I advised npower that I was 
due a bigger refund because it had overestimated my electricity. In response I 
received a bill for £270. It then admitted it had made a mistake… and instead 
issued a bill for £265.64. On all three bills the amount charged for the same 
electricity usage was different. In October a fourth bill arrived for £157.81. 
In vain did I repeat that it was npower which owed me money.

Npower attempts the excuse that your meter has been changed, which it hasn’t, 
and then claims your meter was incorrectly identified in 2012.

Now it says the meter details hadn’t been updated – that is to say it 
apparently hadn’t got round to recording your final electricity reading, 
although it managed to with the higher than predicted gas one. It has refunded 
you the overpayments plus a goodwill gesture.
