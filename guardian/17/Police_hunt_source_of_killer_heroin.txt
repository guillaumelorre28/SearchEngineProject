 Police and public health officials in Glasgow are trying to identify what 
might have killed eight heroin addicts and left 11 more seriously ill in the 
past two weeks.
The search for an explanation has centred on the possibility that a batch of 
contaminated citric acid, which addicts use to dissolve heroin before 
injecting, may be to blame.

In most of the cases the illness has started as an abscess at the point where 
heroin had been injected.

Abscesses are not uncommon among drug users but in the recent cases they 
became uncharacteristically large and severe.

Laurence Gruer, consultant in public health medicine with Greater Glasgow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/glasgow> health board, has said the fact that 
seven of the dead are women supports the citric acid theory.

"Most of the patients appear to have been injecting into their muscles or have 
accidentally missed the vein," he said.

"The most likely explanation is that they have injected heroin, or a substance 
used to dissolve it, which has been contaminated with infective or toxic 
material ...

"Women tend to run out of veins more quickly than men and have to resort to 
muscles to get drugs in."

Citric acid is available as a household product but health board officials 
said the wider community was not at risk. Preliminary tests on one batch of 
acid have proved negative.

Officials were also looking at the possibility that a bad batch of heroin may 
have caused the illness. Thirteen of the victims came from the Govanhill area 
and the others all lived in the north of the city.

Addicts were urged to seek medical help if they developed an abscess or severe 
inflammation.
