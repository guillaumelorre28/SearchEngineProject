What is help to buy London?

It is a scheme offering buyers in the capital a government-backed loan to help 
them purchase a new property. To qualify, the property must be a new-build home 
and cost up to £600,000.

The loan, which is given out by the Homes and Communities Agency, is worth up 
to 40% of the cost of the property and is interest-free for the first five 
years. It is repaid when the property is sold, in instalments as the borrower 
can afford it, or after 25 years.

How does it differ from normal help to buy?

The main scheme has two parts – the equity loan element and a mortgage 
guarantee element

. Both allow people with just 5% deposits to buy properties.

Outside London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>, the loan part offers a 
government loan of between 10% and 20% of the property price on new-builds. The 
mortgage scheme is the same across the country and offers a 95% mortgage on 
new-build and existing homes – the lender is able to buy a guarantee from the 
government to protect it from losses if the property is eventually repossessed.

How does help to buy London work?

Buyers of a new-build home can apply for a loan of up to 40% of its price. On 
a property costing £300,000, this means they can borrow up to £120,000 to help 
with their purchase. They must raise a deposit of at least 5% – in this case 
that would be £15,000 – and prove to a mortgage lender that they qualify to 
borrow the remaining amount – up to 55% – as a normal mortgage.

For the first five years they repay only the mortgage. If after five years the 
loan is still outstanding they pay interest on it.

How much is the interest?

In the first year it is 1.75%. It will rise each year after that in line with 
inflation, plus 1%.

Before offering you a mortgage the lender will check you can afford to repay 
it and the loan when interest payments kick in. Leeds building society checks 
that you can afford repayments at an interest rate of 4%, so on a £100,000 loan 
you will need to show your income can cover £333 a month, on top of your 
mortgage and other outgoings.

What happens when I move?

The amount you have to repay the government is the proportion of the 
property’s price you borrowed – so if you took out the full 40% you will have 
to repay 40% of the sale price. On a property bought for £300,000 which sells 
for £350,000, the repayment on a £120,000 loan would be £140,000.

If the property falls in value, the amount you need to repay will also fall. 
If the property in the example above sells for £250,000, the loan repayment 
will drop to £100,000.

What if I want to clear the loan before I move?

You can opt to repay the loan as and when you want, subject to paying off a 
minimum of 10% of your property’s value at a time. Each time you opt to do this 
you will have to pay for a valuation.

Who can use the scheme?

In theory anyone who wants to buy a home to live in – there is no age limit 
and it is open to homemovers as well as first-time buyers. You will, however, 
need to be able to show a lender that you can afford the mortgage and the loan 
repayments, so you will need a reasonable salary and a reliable income.

The scheme also has a limit on borrowing – you cannot use it if you need a 
mortgage more than 4.5 times your household income.


Who offers mortgages?

So far 10 lenders have signed up: Aldermore, Bank of Scotland, Barclays, 
Halifax, Leeds, Lloyds, Nationwide, NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and 
Teachers building society.


How long will this be available?

The equity loan part of help to buy is due to run until 2021.
