I'm going to bring this blog to an end there. Here is our latest news report 
on the storm and flooding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/06/east-coast-flood-threat-environment-secretary>
.

As thousands of people began cleaning up after record-breaking high tides 
flooded homes and other buildings along Britain's east coast, ministers warned 
the crisis was not over yet.

While flood defences and flood warnings leading to mass evacuations in some 
towns on Thursday night were credited with saving lives, authorities warned 
that more high tides were expected later on Friday and Saturday.

Although only two people are known to have died in the storms so far – in 
separate incidents on Thursday –Owen Paterson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-paterson>, the environment 
secretary, warned that the crisis was not over.

"There will still be exceptionally high tides today and tomorrow, and I would 
urge everybody to pay very close attention to advice from theEnvironment Agency 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment-agency> and also to follow 
instructions from the police, local government andemergency services 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/emergency-services>."

Despite overnight flooding <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/flooding> 
not being as severe as expected, it still brought disruption to large areas of 
England on Friday.

Thanks for all your comments.

In Boston, Lincolnshire, a rescue centre set up last night will be open again 
tonight and for as long as it is needed, Laura Dixon reports.

Some 223 people from 191 properties were rehoused last night. 

 Most have been going back to their homes today to assess the damage but the 
council do not yet know how many people are going to need alternative housing, 
Laura reports.

 The town council says it are now over the worst of the flooding, and is now 
in "recovery stage".

3.11pm GMT 

The Press Association has been speaking to the Marine Conservation Society 
about the porpoises in the Thames. A spokesman for the society said:

﻿It is unusual for five animals to be in the river though, as porpoises tend 
to be seen alone, and in smaller groups.

It isn't possible to say whether the tidal surge is the cause of the porpoises 
being in the river, but it could well be related, either to the tidal movement, 
or as a response to the particularly rough seas beforehand.

The outer Thames estuary would have been relatively sheltered from northerly 
offshore winds.

The pod should be able to navigate back to sea, and pass through the Thames 
Barrier when the tide goes out and the barriers are opened.

Norfolk police have told thousands of residents that there is no longer any 
need for them to stay away from their homes.

A spokesman said: 


﻿The second high tide did not lead to any major incidents so the closure of 
rest centres will now be staggered to ensure residents and property owners can 
return in a safe manner.

The Environment Agency still has 12 severe flood warnings 
<http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/142151.aspx> in 
place, most of them along the east coast in East Anglia, as well as 60 flood 
warnings along the east coast, and 41 of the less serious flood alerts.

3.01pm GMT 

The Environment Agency confirms that the Thames Barrier will be reopened at 
5.30pm, at which point the porpoises will be able to make a break for it. There 
are no further plans to close it.

Fredrick McConnell has been down to the Thames on the trail of the porpoises. 
The photo earlier showed a porpoise near Blackfriars Bridge, but the 
Metropolitan police have told Fredrick they were last spotted near Westminster 
on their way out to sea.

The problem is, though, that the Thames Barrier is closed. So how are they 
going to get out?

More details soon ...

Last night, business owners in Boston, Lincolnshire, whose properties back on 
to the river were forced to evacuate when the water started coming over the 
banks, reportsLaura Dixon.

Many had tried to move what they could to higher floors, but others were taken 
by surprise by the speed of the water.

Daniel Philpott is the owner of the Britannia pub, is dressed in a fleece and 
looks exhausted. Piled outside the front door are fridges, freezers, and bits 
of sodden carpet. Already they have had to clear thousands of pounds worth of 
contaminated stock.

"By about 6.30, 7 o'clock, water was coming through the garden, through the 
kitchen, and coming into the pub. We set up boards and tried to barricade it, 
but the water was coming, we had to evacuate."

When they came back to the kitchen, they found the crockery floating around 
like it was in a swimming pool.

With no heating or electricity yet today, they have a fire burning, and the 
pub is filled with a smoky air as they try and clean off the grills, but they 
are determined to clean up in time to open tonight. "I'll need a drink by 
then," he said.

Laura Dixon sends this on Boston, Lincolnshire, one of the towns that suffered 
from the tidal surge.

The seawater was forced upstream and eventually spilled over the riverbanks. 

This morning, while the water is back down to a normal level, mud and debris 
on the riverside show how high the water reached. Locals said they had not seen 
anything like it.

With a huge clean up under way along the riverbanks, Paul Kenny, the mayor of 
the town, estimated that 1,000 properties had been affected. 

"At 7pm the water was about a foot off the top of the bank. By 20 past it was 
as high as that wall. I was standing on the bridge and it was like looking at a 
lake. 

"There's probably about 1,000 properties that have been affected in the town. 
It was this high," he said gesturing with his arm. "Imagine that in your living 
room." 

He said many of the businesses in the old town centre had fared better than 
they had feared, but some had been flooded and that on one street by the church 
the water was flowing "like a torrent, 18 inches high". 

"I was standing next to one of the restaurant owners, he was in tears," he 
said. "I have lived here for 20 odd years and have always heard that Boston 
could potentially flood. Everything that we dreaded happened last night."

12.34pm GMT 

Including the two men killed in seperate incidents in the UK yesterday, the 
storm has storm killed at least seven people across Europe. The additional 
deaths were reported in Poland, Sweden and Denmark.

As well as high winds and floods, northern Europe has experienced heavy snow 
and ice, which have seriously affected air and road travel. In Hamburg, a tidal 
surge saw flood waters rise by 4m (13ft).

12.26pm GMT 

In Lincolnshire, police are advising residents that they can go home, but they 
are asked to talk to a uniformed officer in their street, who will assess the 
risk, before re-entering their properties. 

Any residents who return to properties that have flooded and have any concerns 
over the safety of gas and electricity supplies should not use them, police say.

In Britain we are obsessed with the weather.

The opening line of a BBC Timewatch documentary 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vARjm3yHKzY> about the 1953 storm. Then, floods 
and extreme weather killed over 2,500 people across Europe. Today, with tides 
in some places rising higher than 60 years ago, modern forecasting and 
emergency response services mean rural and urban communities are much safer.

11.19am GMT 

The Environment Agency has put out a press release calling last night’s 
flooding “the most serious coastal tidal surge for over 60 years” and warning 
that significant flooding is expected to continue along the east coast today.

Parts of North Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, 
Suffolk, Essex and Kent are at greatest risk from the combination of a large 
surge, high tides and large waves. The areas at risk of flooding also include 
the Northumberland coastline to Redcar and West Sussex.

Some defences could be overtopped by the combined effect of the high tides, 
high winds and a large tidal surge.

Jason Wakeford, an Environment Agency spokesman said:

The worst effects were in darkness overnight so it is too soon to assess the 
overall picture but several thousand properties have been affected in the 
biggest coastal event of the last 60 years and the warnings we issued were in 
line with that risk.

Dr Paul Leinster, Environment Agency chief executive, said:

Our thoughts are with those who have been affected by flooding. We are urging 
people to remain vigilant, as we expect further flooding today along large 
parts of the east coast of England.

The Environment Agency estimates that at least 800,000 properties have been 
protected by flood schemes in the past 24 hours. Flood risk management assets, 
including the Thames and Hull Barriers, have protected thousands of homes and 
businesses from sea levels higher in some places than those that occurred 
during the devastating floods of 1953.

Advances in flood forecasting mean that early alerts of the tidal surge were 
given to emergency services, homes and businesses, allowing vital time to 
prepare.

Our teams continue to work closely with partner organisations including the 
emergency services, Met Office and local authorities. Our teams have been out 
in force overnight, inspecting and repairing flood defences and barriers, 
monitoring sea levels and issuing flood warnings.

Here is the latest news story summarising what happened last night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/06/uk-flood-defences-storm-surge-east-coast>
.

Police in Norfolk, where the coastal storm surge destroyed a number of homes, 
havereleased an update 
<http://www.norfolk.police.uk/newsandevents/newsstories/2013/december/norfolkfloodsdaytwo.aspx#.UqGo1I2stLA.twitter>
. Yesterday and last night, fire and rescue services were called out to 116 
incidents including nine flood rescues. Deputy Chief Constable Charlie Hall 
said:

In places, water levels were higher than those experienced in the flooding of 
1953, when many people lost their lives. Thankfully that has not been the case 
on this occasion ... The widespread evacuation was based on the high risk of 
severe flooding and was essential in ensuring the public’s safety.

The constabulary also offered public health advice to those affected by 
flooding:

• If you’re caught in a flood, do not consume food that has been contaminated 
by floodwaters.

• Do not let young children play in flood water and try to avoid coming into 
contact with floodwater.

• If you do come in contact with floo water, wash hands using clean water and 
soap and be aware of young children putting their hands in their mouth.

• Keep in touch with elderly and vulnerable friends, family and neighbours in 
affected areas, ask about their welfare and offer assistance when possible.

Reader David Platt sends this dramatic video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2013/dec/06/uk-weather-scarborough-man-rescued-tidal-surge-flood>
 of a man being rescued from the sea in Scarborough at 5.30pm yesterday. At one 
point the waves wash away a JCB next to his van; after that his car is swept 
away. He toldCaroline Bannock:

The Scarborough police closed off a number of roads but it seems this man had 
parked his vehicle on Marine Drive and nobody had spotted him. He got into his 
van and tried to drive off but his vehicle came to a halt. He got out into the 
water and then the JCB appeared (they had been working on the sewers); the man 
then got back in his van but as you can see he almost got swept away – it was 
really dangerous. Some of the lads ran foward and helped him out of the water.

I have just been speaking to Patrick Barkham 
<https://audioboo.fm/boos/1779583-storm-guardian-s-patrick-barkham-in-hemsby-norfolk-where-homes-have-fallen-into-the-sea>
, who is in Hemsby, Norfolk, where a number of homes have fallen into the sea.

Hemsby’s lost five properties in the night; five homes have literally gone 
over the cliff edge, over the soft sand dunes here. About 30ft of the coast has 
been chewed away by last night’s storm surge.

One resident just described how he watched his house go, and it was literally 
folded over by the sea and carried away within half an hour.

And several other people were actually still living in their homes, even 
though they were perched right on the edge of the sand dunes, and they had to 
very hurriedly evacuate last night and remove all their things, and they’re now 
coming back this morning to a scene of complete devastation, really, of bits of 
timber and bits of veranda and bits of front window left on the top of the sand 
dune, and the rest of the house nowhere to be seen.

There’s an enormous swell. The North Sea isn’t known for its swells, really. 
The tide’s still coming up again for another high tide this morning that’s 
going to peak at about quarter to eleven.

Had the residents had enough warning to leave last night?

As far as I can tell. I haven’t spoken to any residents who said they weren’t 
warned. Several of them appeared to be wanting to stick by their homes, and 
almost defend their homes, if you like, so people hadn’t left until quite late 
yesterday. There were actually local people putting concrete blocks out on the 
beach until 5.30 last night, as a sort of last ditch makeshift sea defence, a 
sort of DIY sea defence, but they said they soon realised that this was 
completely hopeless when faced with the might of the sea.

Patrick said this morning’s high tide hadn’t reached the levels of last 
night’s peak. “People are quite hopeful that the worst is over, although 
emergency services are still saying to people who were evacuated that they 
should remain in the rest centres where they are and they shouldn’t return to 
their homes until we watch to see how the high tide goes tonight.”

I asked him about other parts of Norfolk.

There’s been damage all round the coast. A friend of mine who lives on the 
cliffs at Overstrand said it was like living in a house above the London 
Underground, when you hear a tube go under your house. The whole house was 
vibrating with the waves pounding against the cliffs last night.

In Cromer we’ve had burger vans disappear. The pier has taken a real 
battering. Almost all the beach houses, the little wooden huts there, have been 
damaged or have been blown away. There’s a lovely beach cafe at Caister-on-Sea 
that’s been smashed to pieces and has disappeared, and the owner of that cafe’s 
slightly upset, because she felt that the flood defences that were put in last 
night actually hindered her from taking her possessions from her cafe.

He said the evacuation had been very well-organised, and the sea defences 
seemed to have done their job.

Caroline Bannock has been speaking to James Hardaker, a taxi driver from 
Skegness who filmed the below video at 7.02pm last night. He told her:

I was at the end of Scarbrough Esplanade, Skegness, which is beside the pier. 
The video was taken looking southwards along what is normally a foreshore 
footpath. I took the movie on my iPhone, shortly after this the streetlighting 
went out! The water has subsided this morning.

Skegness Tidal Surge 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/52a028a8e4b0acc591790cd5/686371>

A surge results in a particularly high tide in Skegness on the evening of 
Thursday 5 December 2013. This is the foreshore walk, looking away from the 
Pier in the direction of Tower Esplanade, shortly before 7pm; about 40 minutes 
before high tide. For an indication of depth, the object visible at the end of 
the wall this side of the shelter, is the top of a litter bin.

Philip Oltermann sends more from Germany, where the storm they are calling 
"Hurricane Xaver" has pummelled the north of the country, causing extensive 
damage and bringing infrastructure to a standstill.

In the country's second largest city, Hamburg, water rose six metres above sea 
level – triggering memories of the great flood of 1962, which claimed 315 
lives. Several streets around the historic harbour area are still flooded this 
morning. More than 130 flights in and out of the city have been cancelled, and 
schools have remained closed across north Germany.

In Hanover, one man was seriously injured when a minibus full of children was 
caught by a gust of wind and pushed into oncoming traffic. In Stralsund in the 
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, the wind tore off the roof of a supermarket. The 
North-Sea islands off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein are currently cut off 
from the mainland.

The storm also left its mark in the country's capital. Outside Berlin's Palace 
Bellevue, the residency of German president Joachim Gauck, the wind knocked 
over a 13-metre Christmas tree.

Summary

Here is a summary of this morning’s news:

• Loss of life and property was minimised despite “record-breaking” sea levels 
along the east coast of Britain last night because of beefed-up defences and 
flood warnings, according to the Environment Agency. Following a meeting of the 
government's Cobra emergencies committee, environment secretary Owen Paterson 
warned that the danger was not over. "There will still be exceptionally high 
tides today and tomorrow and I would ask everybody to pay very close attention 
to advice from the Environment Agency and also to follow instructions from the 
police, local government and the emergency services," he said.

• Although floodwaters were reported to be receding, the Environment Agency 
<http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/142151.aspx> still 
had 28 severe flood warnings ("danger to life") in place and 141 flood warnings 
("immediate action required") – mostly along almost the whole east coast. The 
agency also had 63 of its less serious flood alerts in place, along parts of 
the south coast of England, and the north and south coasts of Wales.

• Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes after the largest North 
Sea surge for more than 60 years hit the north Norfolk coast last night and 
headed south.

• Two people were killed as the storm battered Britain yesterday. A lorry 
driver died in West Lothian when his HGV toppled onto a number of cars as high 
winds and gales battered Scotland, while a second man was killed by a falling 
tree in Retford, Nottinghamshire.

• The Thames Barrier, which protects London, was shut overnight and faced the 
biggest tide since it began operating in 1982. It was then reopened, but will 
be closing again at 11.15am.

9.48am GMT 

In England and Wales, the Environment Agency 
<http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/142151.aspx> still

Flood warnings have been lifted across Scotland after yesterday's storms 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/06/flood-warnings-lifted-scotland-weather>
.

Transport links were returning to normal on Friday morning after the entire 
rail network was shut down. ScotRail said it expected a full train service to 
operate but travellers might still face some disruption.

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) lifted the majority of flood 
warnings – which indicate that flooding is expected and immediate action is 
required – on Friday morning. One remains in place for the Eyemouth coastal 
area.

9.23am GMT 

Norway, Denmark and Germany were also hit by the storm. In Hamburg, Germany's 
second-biggest city, the water rose about 13 feet (4 meters) above average 
flood levels Friday, hitting heights rarely seen and parts of the city's busy 
port were shut.

German weather service meteorologist, Andreas Friedrich, said:

The truly dangerous thing about this storm is that the winds will continue for 
hours and won't let up. The danger of coastal flooding is high.

Sandwich, in Kent, escaped lightly, reports Andrew Culf, despite having a 
severe flood alert warning of danger to life.

About 20 homes closest to the Quay, where the flood defences are currently 
being improved in a £21m scheme, are thought to have suffered flooding when the 
defences were overtopped. About 178 properties were evacuated, with some 
residents spending the night in a local leisure centre. Strand Street, one of 
the main streets in the centre of Sandwich, remains closed where 
Environment Agency staff set up a temporary barrier. On Thursday night 
residents queued for an allocation of 10 sandbags per house, some using 
borrowed shopping trolleys to carry them. Householders have been warned the 
emergency is not over, with a second high tide forecast for around 1pm.

Transport update

The storms are continuing to cause travel chaos, with some roads flooded and 
trains disrupted.

• A number of Greater Anglia 
<http://www.greateranglia.co.uk/travel-information/journey-planning/service-disruptions>
 services are not operating, and some Norwich to London trains have been 
cancelled. There will be no service on the Ipswich-Lowestoft route until at 
least 2pm.

• First Capital Connect 
<http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/plan-your-journey/live-train-updates/> 
has reduced the number of trains running between Stevenage and London Kings 
Cross/Moorgate via Hertford North.

• There are delays of up to 40 minutes on Southeastern 
<http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/>.

• Arriva Trains Wales  
<http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/LiveServiceInformation/>says services will 
be suspended until at least Saturday between Chester and Rhyl.

• Most Scottish rail services <http://www.scotrail.co.uk/> are running again 
after Thursday's virtual shutdown.

Among the roads closed are the A12 in Blythburgh in Suffolk, the A16 in Boston 
in Lincolnshire, the A63 in Hull and the A178 in Hartlepool. Some roads in Kent 
are flooded. TheHighways Agency <http://www.highways.gov.uk/> says extra staff 
are being deployed to help keep trunk roads in East Anglia clear of debris. It 
advised motorists to avoid the A47 and A12 if possible.

8.11am GMT 

More on the Environment Agency's weather warnings. In an update on Thursday 
night it said strong to gale-force winds were expected to continue on Friday 
along the east coast. It said: 

There is a high likelihood of severe coastal flooding impacts along parts of 
the North Yorkshire, East Riding of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk 
and Essex coastline on Thursday and Friday. There is also a high likelihood of 
severe coastal flooding impacts along parts of the Kent coastline on Friday.

8.06am GMT 

My colleague Patrick Barkham, who is in Norfolk, writes:

As the sun comes up over Norfolk it appears that most of the defences built 
after the catastrophic 1953 floods have done their job 60 years on. Up to 
20,000 people have been evacuated but so far just 60 homes are reported to be 
flooded. Last night's tidal surge has carved into Norfolk's fast-eroding 
cliffs, and five homes have fallen over the cliff in Hemsby. Witnesses watched 
the lifeboat station destroyed by one enormous wave.

High tides are expected again this morning and tonight, with evacuated people 
advised to stay in the rest centres – closed schools – until tomorrow.

I'm heading to Hemsby now but tweet me @Patrick_Barkham 
<https://twitter.com/patrick_barkham> if there are other flood-affected places 
in Norfolk I should visit.

Summary

Good morning. Parts of Britain are waking up to discover what damage has been 
left by a tidal surge reported to be the worst for 60 years. The North Sea 
surge hit the north Norfolk coast on Thursday evening before moving south.

• Thousands of homes have been evacuated along the east coast. In Norfolk, 
9,000 homes were evacuated, mainly around Great Yarmouth. In Boston, 
Lincolnshire, more than 250 people were taken to evacuation centres, and 200 
were reported to be at a centre in Clacton-on-Sea in Essex.

• More than 100,000 properties have been hit by power cuts as winds of up to 
140mph hit powerlines.

• Soldiers were drafted in to help emergency efforts. The Ministry of Defence 
said 60 Light Dragoons, based at the Swanton Morley Army base in Norfolk, were 
involved.

• Parts of the country said the floods had not been as bad as feared. 
Northumbria police tweeted: "Early indications are that the tidal surges in our 
area this morning are less than what we saw yesterday." Essex police downgraded 
a severe flood warning to a flood warning.

• Two lives were claimed by the storm on Thursday. A man died after he was 
struck by a falling tree in a park in Retford, Nottinghamshire, and a lorry 
driver was killed when his HGV toppled on to a number of cars in West Lothian.
