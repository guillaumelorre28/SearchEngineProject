The gap between Scotland’s public spending and tax revenues has widened, with 
the crash in global oil prices leading to a deficit of nearly £15bn.

The latest official data shows that Scotland’s structural deficit was more 
than twice that of the UK last year, after its share ofNorth Sea oil tax 
revenues collapsed

, falling from £1.8bn in the previous year to £60m.

The government expenditure and revenue Scotland (Gers) figures 
<http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2016/08/2132> show that in 2015-16, Scottish 
tax receipts were £400 less than the UK average, at £10,000, after several 
decades during which oil had pushed them above the UK level.

The Scottish and UK governments spent £1,200 a head more on public services in 
Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>, and on Scotland’s share of 
UK and overseas spending, while overall tax receipts fell by £400 a head.

Compared with spending at UK level, that led to a gulf of £1,600 a head 
between what was raised in taxes and spent in Scotland. Overall government 
spending as a share of the economy increased again to reach nearly 44% of 
Scotland’s GDP, compared with 40% at UK level.

Nicola Sturgeon <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon>, the 
Scottish first minister, said the figures were very difficult and the plunge in 
oil prices meant that Scotland had “suffered an economic shock, which has 
impact on our fiscal position”.

The Gers data presented a challenging picture for Scotland, she said, adding: 
“It is a challenge we have had for some time now – how to grow and diversify 
our onshore economy.”


Senior economists warned that a budget deficit of this scale made Scottish 
independence effectively unaffordable

, unless Sturgeon made very tough choices on spending cuts or tax rises.

The Fraser of Allander Institute 
<http://www.strath.ac.uk/business/economics/fraserofallanderinstitute/>, an 
economics thinktank at Strathclyde University, directly challenged Sturgeon’s 
statement on Wednesday that “the route to closing the deficit is fundamentally 
on the revenue growth side”.

Closing a 21% structural deficit would need rates of economic growth for 
Scotland not seen in current lifetimes, the FAI said. As Sturgeon had pointed 
out on Tuesday, the Brexit vote was likely to make those efforts even more 
difficult.

“It is simply not possible to operate under independence with a deficit at 
this scale – full stop,” the FAI said. “The Scottish government needs to set 
out the tough choices that it would make alongside a detailed and comprehensive 
plan for how it would manage the public finances under independence. This won’t 
be easy, but is essential.”

The data put Scotland’s net fiscal deficit last year at £14.8bn, including 
North Sea receipts, £522m higher than the previous year. That was equivalent to 
9.5% of Scotland’s GDP. The UK’s estimated deficit for the same period was 4% 
of GDP.

Asked how an independent Scotland could meet the EU’s requirements for an 
annual spending deficit to be lower than 3% 
<http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/index_en.htm>, 
Sturgeon said independence would change Scotland’s overall financial position. 
“I accept Scotland faces, whatever our constitutional arrangements, a very 
challenging fiscal position, [but] the fundamentals of our economy are strong,” 
she said.

Scotland’s tax revenues were estimated at £53.7bn, but the Scottish and UK 
governments spent £68.6bn on public services in Scotland, and on Scotland’s 
share of UK and overseas spending.

Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said the figures “should act as a 
reality check for those calling for another independence referendum”.

“During the independence referendum, Nicola Sturgeon personally promised a 
second oil boom. Her own government’s figures show she misled people and that 
is unforgivable,” she said.

“The SNP’s own figures confirm independence would mean severe cuts over and 
above those already being imposed by the Tories, at exactly the time when our 
public services need more investment.”

David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said: “Scotland weathered a dramatic 
slump in oil revenues last year because we are part of a United Kingdom that 
has at its heart a system for pooling and sharing resources across the country 
as a whole.

“The fact public spending was £1,200 per head higher in Scotland than the UK 
as a whole also demonstrates that the United Kingdom, not the European Union, 
is the vital union for Scotland’s prosperity.”

Sturgeon denied that this meant the country was being subsidised by the rest 
of the UK, saying Scotland had paid in a higher rate of tax revenues than the 
UK on average in recent decades.

That position ignores the far higher levels of public spending in Scotland, 
which needed in effect an injection of £15bn last year from the UK treasury.

Sturgeon denied that closing the gap would require spending cuts or tax rises. 
“What I say is growing revenue is the priority. Public spending in Scotland is 
higher than the rest of the UK for some very good and in many respects 
unavoidable reasons, such as its rurality. It costs more to deliver health 
services to island communities,” she said.

Sturgeon insisted that the data offered cause for some optimism. It showed 
that taxes from the onshore economy, excluding North Sea revenues, had grown by 
£1.9bn. At 36.5% of Scotland’s GDP, this was the best figure since the 
financial crisis and more than offset the £1.7bn lost from the decline in oil 
and gas taxes.

But she said the overall figures underlined her anxieties about the damage 
that leaving the EU could do to the Scottish economy. “Leaving the EU will 
leave the task of growing the onshore economy so much harder than it might be,” 
Sturgeon said.

Prof John McLaren, an independent economist at Scottish Trends, said future 
oil revenues were never likely to recover enough to significantly cut the 
deficit. A doubling of current oil prices to $100 a barrel would still only 
raise oil receipts to £2.8bn.

McLaren said Scotland’s worse position compared with the UK was likely to 
continue for the next five years, the direct reverse of claims made in Alex 
Salmond’s white paper on independence in 2013 that Scotland’s tax revenues and 
finances would remain stronger than the UK’s.

“Scotland’s fiscal position relative to the UK can be forecast with greater 
certainty and is likely to remain at around the current level – about 5.5% of 
GDP worse off than the UK’s,” McLaren predicted.
