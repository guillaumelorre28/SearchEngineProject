 in the US vote.

“We are already, even now, having to deal with information out of Russia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> or with internet attacks that are of 
Russian origin or with news which sows false information,” the German 
chancellor said at a press conference alongside the Norwegian prime minister, 
Erna Solberg, on Tuesday. Dealing with that was already “a daily task”, she 
told reporters in Berlin. “So it may be that this could also play a role during 
the election campaign.”

The comments came in response to a question about whether Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> could experience the type of 
cyber-attacks that have plagued the White House race, notably targeting Hillary 
Clinton’s Democratic party.

Washington last month formally accused the Russian government of trying to 
“interfere” in the election by hacking US political institutions,charges the 
Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed

.

Germany’s domestic secret service earlier this year accused Russia of a series 
of international cyber-spying and sabotage attacks, including a case in which 
the German lower house of parliament was targeted last year.

Germans are scheduled to go to the polls in September 2017. Merkel has yet to 
announce her candidacy but is widely expected to run for a fourth term.
