Ticketmaster quietly unveiled a treat for tribute band fans on Tuesday, 
dispensing millions of dollars of free ticket vouchers to customers as part of 
a class action lawsuit settlement.

Excitement over the settlement quickly dissolved as people learned that the 
true value of the payout is dependent on a person’s tastes and geography.

Live in Chicago or Seattle 
<https://twitter.com/1077TheEnd/status/745640215054684160>? As of Wednesday 
afternoon, the vouchers could not be used at any shows in those cities. Are you 
a fan of Dolly Parton or Gwen Stefani? Hopefully you live close to Chula Vista, 
California, or Raleigh, North Carolina. Tech website the Verge described the 
deal as a“garbage fire legal settlement

These Ticketmaster vouchers are like finding money in your couch cushions, 
then realizing it's foreign currency from a failed state.

The offerings were particularly dismal for some of the country’s most 
populated cities – New York City’s 8.4 million citizens must travel out of 
state to use the vouchers unless they want to see act such as a tribute band to
Guns N’ Roses

the shows you can attend with ticketmaster vouchers are perfect if you're a 
37-year-old who lives in his van

The vouchers were made available as part of a settlement in a class action 
lawsuit with customers who purchased tickets between 21 October 1999 and 27 
February 2013. For each ticket purchased in that period, customers can get one 
voucher, up to 17 vouchers. Some people are also eligible for $5 or $2.25 
discounts on future purchases (to see if you’re one of these people, log in to 
Ticketmaster, and select the “Active Vouchers 
<https://www.ticketmaster.com/member/vouchers?_ga=1.114308292.271879565.1463659570>
” section).

Use of these vouchers is first come, first served. So even though Ticketmaster 
said that the vouchers expire in 2020, ticket availability is actually 
dependent on how many other people use the discounts and vouchers before then.

The problem with these Ticketmaster vouchers is that I almost talked myself 
into getting tix to see the Goo Goo Dolls in Sarasota Springs.

While the listings seem dismal, there are some good gigs nestled between 
lounge singers and 90s-themed dance parties, such as Dead Kennedys in 
Philadelphianext week

Then, of course, there are the offerings for tribute band enthusiasts – 
vouchers can be used across the country for tributes to: Fleetwood Mac, 
Metallica, the Doors, Journey, Stevie Wonder, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, 
Nirvana, Pearl Jam, REM, Stone Temple Pilots, the Rolling Stones, Kid Rock, 
Elton John, Van Halen, Guns N’ Roses, Led Zeppelin, Billy Joel, Pink Floyd and
Black Sabbath

Ticketmaster tried to give some wack concerts as part of their settlement deal 
but didn't know I'm Seal's biggest fan so who's laughing now?
