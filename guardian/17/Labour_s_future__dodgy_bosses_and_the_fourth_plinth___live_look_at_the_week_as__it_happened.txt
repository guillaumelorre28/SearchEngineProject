See you next week!

Thanks for taking part today, it’s been really interesting to follow the 
discussion, which we hope you can continue for a while yet!

We’ll be back next Friday with another of these – in the meantime we’d love to 
hear from you either in the comments or via email about what you’d like us to 
talk about above the line. You can contact matthew.holmes@theguardian.com or 
sarah.marsh@theguardian.com – or indeed look out for us below. We’ll also be 
happy to try and pass on other points or questions to colleagues at the 
Guardian, so if there’s a burning issue you want to talk about let us know.


Have a great weekend.

More of your GuardianWitness wild camping images

Some of these pictures shared in response to a gallery we published earlier

 are really getting us in the mood for leaving the office, and indeed the city 
for the weekend.

Wild camping on Hunstanton Beach in Norfolk 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57ea9914e4b04cbd30bc3a9c/5006541>

I love camping and I love the beach so I decided to combine the two one night 
in May this year. It was lovely falling asleep to the sound of the waves and 
unzipping the canvas to see the sea just a few metres away!

Wild camping isn't always easy to do in England but if you find somewhere 
quiet, with little footfall you can do it. Just make sure you leave no trace, 
arrive late and leave early! It's a truly magical adventure.

Cliff top wild camp 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57ea9914e4b04cbd30bc3a9c/5006555>

Following a beautiful day walking the South West coastal path, spent a great 
evening under starry skies wild camping on the cliff top, This was the view I 
was greeted with in the morning, which was a nice accompaniment to a bacon 
sandwich.

Would you let a robot look after your child?

Julia Carrie Wong

This week I attended a robotics exhibition in San Jose, California, where 
Chinese company Avatar Mind was showing off a“social robot” for children 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/29/ipal-robot-childcare-robobusiness-san-jose>
 called the iPal. Already in production in China, the company hopes to start 
selling the humanoid robots in the United States in 2017.
 The iPal. Look into its eyes and feel its pain. Photograph: Julia Carrie Wong 
for the Guardian 
The robot can talk, help with homework, dance, play games, and run a video 
stream so parents can keep an eye on their children while still at work. The 
founder told me children ages three to eight would be alright for “a couple of 
hours” without adult supervision with the iPal.

The idea of a robotic nanny has been around since the Jetsons, but ethicists 
have raised serious concerns about the potential dangers of leaving children 
with machines that approximate, but do not match, human interaction.

What do you think? Is leaving a child with a robot better than leaving her in 
front of the TV? Can a robot parent raise a human child?

Some historical context to the latest discussion below the line on Labour, 
which you’ve continued to discuss after earlier articles we highlighted.

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4524985> ID3620306  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4524985> 30 September 2016 3:44pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84370447> 
After every period Labour has had in office there has been a backlash from the 
left. It happened in the 1950s after the Attlee government. The left were 
unhappy with NHS charges, the policy on nuclear weapons and towards the Soviet 
Union. This led to infighting which kept the party out of power for 13 years.

After the Wilson/Callaghan governments of the 60s and 70s we got the infamous 
i infighting of the 80s. Corbyn's mentor helped build a myth that the party had 
betrayed socialism and was just the same as the Tories. This helped keep Labour 
out of power for 18 years.

So now after the Blair/Brown governments we're getting the same thing. The 
left are trashing the parties record and focusing on the past. They cannot see 
what led Labour to success in the past. The only difference each time this 
happens is that the divisions get deeper and the time in the wilderness seems 
to get longer. 13 years, 18 years and how long now? 25-30?

Can Britain afford to wait that long or like the Liberal Party a century ago, 
has Labour's time just come to an end?

Discussion of the week on diversity in advertising

Guardian readers

Each week we ask our team of moderators to highlight a couple of conversations 
they thought were particularly interesting or enjoyable.

The first we’ll choose was in reaction to this piece on diversity in 
advertising 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/hm-advert-diversity-ad-women>
, a response to a new H&M advert which, as the author describes with some 
scepticism, “features Normal Women™ doing Normal Things™”. You can click the 
links on the comments to follow the full conversation.

‘If this signals a change that includes more diversity going forward, then I’m 
in’
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15258506> ifeelshiny

I thought the ad was gorgeous - sorry. How can you win? You put white thing 
women in an advert, you're not representative (true). You put a diverse range 
of women in an advert, you're pandering. True, there was something a bit 
tokenistic about the campaign, and they could have maybe done it a bit more 
subtly than having a bunch of "diverse" women in one advert saying "see how 
diverse we are???"
Then again, you have to start somewhere. If this signals a change in H&M's 
advertising that includes more diversity in all of their media going forward, 
then I'm in. Let's just see if they carry it forward.
Oh and on the unrelated paragraph about portraying mixed race couples - I had 
no idea it produced such backlash. I am a product of a mixed marriage myself, 
so I am frankly just bemused at furious reactions over mixed marriages and 
relationships. They've been a fact of life for thousands of years and have been 
increasingly common and will only get more common as air travel and 
multi-culturalism increases. I'm not even offended, I just find it highly 
amusing that there are still people out there who honestly believe that 
"mixing" is wrong. Next fact of life to get offended over - the sky is blue.

‘The problem is down to agencies insisting on hiring privately educated 
individuals with degrees’

I work in advertising. I've worked at several agencies and can tell you from 
experience that the problem is not down to gender imbalance (though this is 
definitely the case at the very senior levels). Nor is it necessarily down to a 
lack of ethnic diversity (though this still has a long way to go). In my 
opinion, the problem is down to these agencies insisting that they generally 
hire privately educated individuals with degrees. This means that my colleagues 
are effectively homogenised in their views and experiences. How then, is it 
possible for them to create ads which resonate with society at large, when they 
only hire individuals who have been living in a lovely middle-class bubble 
their whole lives? A lot of the products we make ads for would never be bought 
by such people. Rather, it's those in the council estates that flock to buy 
them en masse. And the disconnect between what they want, and what a lot of my 
colleagues think they want, is marked.

‘This is just the voice in the doorman’s earpiece saying, ‘It’s a flat night,

Okay, I've watched it. There were no women on the verge of obesity in there; 
there was no depressed and solitary-looking woman, there wasn't a woman with 
alopecia or rosacea. No one with MS, no amputee. I know why, you know why, so 
what's with the celebration of bullshit from H&M and Dove? This is just the 
voice in the doorman's earpiece saying, 'It's a flat night, let the people in 
we wouldn't last night.'

What do you think of David Shrigley's fourth plinth?

Matthew Holmes

On Thursday Sadiq Khan unveiled the latest piece to occupy the fourth plinth 
in Trafalgar Square in London – a seven-metre high bronze thumbs up by 
Manchester-based artist David Shrigley.

<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2016/sep/29/david-shrigley-gives-thumbs-up-to-trafalgar-squares-fourth-plinth-video>
The Guardian’s Jonathan Jones calls it “phallic, ungainly and hysterically 
strident” –but gives a four star review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/29/david-shrigley-really-good-fourth-plinth-trafalgar-square>
.

We can go one better than an art critic. Reader Aubrey Leahy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/dec/25/behind-the-lens-day-25-of-the-guardianwitness-advent-calendar>
 will be better known to many commenters andGuardianWitness 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55956743e4b08f71d0eba8d7/1617315> 
contributors byhis username on site: fourthplinth 
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4318372>.

How could we not ask him for his thoughts?

Of his username he says: “Since I was a 14-year-old sea cadet in 1958, and 
part of a guard of honour celebrating Trafalgar Day, Trafalgar Square has 
always held a particular sweet spot and place in my heart.”


So what are his first impressions of the new piece occupying the plinth?

Perhaps thumbs up gives a nod to the fast-fading cheerful cockney spirit? It 
does seem to suit the plinth and convey the upbeat spirit of London. It’s 
certainly in keeping with the fact that each sculpture has been different. (My 
all time favorite remains Yinka Shonibare’sShip in a Bottle 
<http://www.yinkashonibarembe.com/press/past/hms-victory-returns-to-trafalgar/>
).

I suspect it won’t be long before it gets a hat or a traffic cone added (as 
Nelson wore for the Jubilee). The main problem for me is am very familiar with 
another similar sculpture of a thumb which this reminds me of (at Clos Pegase 
winery in the Napa Valley <http://thisismyhappiness.com/2012/04/30/clos-pegase/>
). It would be awfully unoriginal to give it a thumbs up, so will instead give 
it a pig Latin SupraPollice Verso <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollice_verso>.

So there we go – what do you think?

Mental health and young women … what's going on?

Sarah Marsh

Dr Liz England comments on a story out this week showing mental illness has 
soared among young women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/29/self-harm-ptsd-and-mental-illness-soaring-among-young-women-in-england-survey>
. She responds to the question – why are women more affected?

Women have always felt more comfortable coming forward and I don’t think men 
self-harm as much. Instead, they tend to turn to other things to ease their 
distress, such as alcohol. That’s why it’s important to have gender specific 
services. We are seeing more women with post traumatic stress disorder from 
domestic violence, after childbirth and from sexual violence they experience in 
relationships. Those sort of conditions need a different approach to ones we 
have as standard at the moment.

Similarly with men a different approach is also needed, and for them we need 
to make services and treatment accessible. We know that middle-aged men have 
the highest suicide rate, so what are we doing to get that group into treatment 
and support earlier. It’s good that we have identified these new statistics as 
if we know about these problems then we can plan services better and think, why 
is this happening?

Mental health problems are increasingly (there’s lots of reasons for this). I 
worry, in particular, about the impact of the media and social media. People 
are seeing things like self-harm on social media dn it makes it more accessible 
and we need to be really alert and able to talk to our children. We need to 
have that conversation around those issues and make sure they are safe.

Pictures of the week

Joanna Ruck

Picture editor Joanna Ruck shares some of her images of the week.

First, the images from Aleppo have been particularly hard to look at this week 
and very graphic and distressing. There’s a gallery of images from Aleppo you 
can see here:

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/sep/29/devastation-in-aleppo-syria-in-pictures>
As a counterpoint to those images, it’s always nice to look at a panda falling 
over ...

But the picture that caused us the most amusement this week was Jeremy 
Corbyn’s photocall as he arrived to give his speech to the Labour Party 
conference. We couldn’t decide if he’d accidentally walked onto the set of a 
hair commercial or looked like a headmaster on A-level results day.

What makes a horrible boss?

Over delegation and micro management. We've just said goodbye to someone who 
took delegation to the extreme and palmed off everything they did not feel like 
doing. For them it was all about hand picking the tasks that gave them the 
right exposure and allowing plenty of time for telling everyone just how busy 
they were. The unfortunate staff under her were saddled with a lot of the grunt 
work and tasks above their pay grade, for which they recieved nothing but 
constant harrassment from the boss to get the work done. She walked away with a 
fat bonus and no parting recommendation to management that her staff receive 
similar.

The worst bosses are the ones who demand you get some piece of work done by 
last week, and then call a 5 hour meeting to discuss how all the work is going. 
Sigh.

* Liars

* Those more concerned with their careers than their staff

* Those who pass blame down

* Those who steal the achievements of those below them

* Micro-managers

* Those who are too afraid to delegate

* Those who pass on responsibility but not the authority to deliver

That's my list over the years and what I say to all my staff is that they all 
see these people, these horrible bosses, so why therefore do so many when their 
time comes, behave in the same manner.

Basically if you wouldn't like it going to yourself then don't do it to others.

That being said I've met far more bloody horrible staff in my time than 
managers, but then there are more staff and the managers unfortunately have 
more ability to cause significant damage.

Also one final point to make is that "managers" and not "leaders" and vice 
versa. Those are two distinct skill sets and being good at one does not mean 
you will be good at the other.

Bad bosses - sure. 

But I seem to remember that about 1 in 10 of us are bosses - that means that 
for every nightmare boss there are 10 nightmare employees.

No wonder bosses get a bit frazzled.

Thanks for taking part today, it’s been really interesting to follow the 
discussion, which we hope you can continue for a while yet!

We’ll be back next Friday with another of these – in the meantime we’d love to 
hear from you either in the comments or via email about what you’d like us to 
talk about above the line. You can contact matthew.holmes@theguardian.com or 
sarah.marsh@theguardian.com – or indeed look out for us below. We’ll also be 
happy to try and pass on other points or questions to colleagues at the 
Guardian, so if there’s a burning issue you want to talk about let us know.


Have a great weekend.

Wild camping on Hunstanton Beach in Norfolk 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57ea9914e4b04cbd30bc3a9c/5006541>

I love camping and I love the beach so I decided to combine the two one night 
in May this year. It was lovely falling asleep to the sound of the waves and 
unzipping the canvas to see the sea just a few metres away!

Wild camping isn't always easy to do in England but if you find somewhere 
quiet, with little footfall you can do it. Just make sure you leave no trace, 
arrive late and leave early! It's a truly magical adventure.

This week I attended a robotics exhibition in San Jose, California, where 
Chinese company Avatar Mind was showing off a“social robot” for children 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/29/ipal-robot-childcare-robobusiness-san-jose>
 called the iPal. Already in production in China, the company hopes to start 
selling the humanoid robots in the United States in 2017.
 The iPal. Look into its eyes and feel its pain. Photograph: Julia Carrie Wong 
for the Guardian 
The robot can talk, help with homework, dance, play games, and run a video 
stream so parents can keep an eye on their children while still at work. The 
founder told me children ages three to eight would be alright for “a couple of 
hours” without adult supervision with the iPal.

The idea of a robotic nanny has been around since the Jetsons, but ethicists 
have raised serious concerns about the potential dangers of leaving children 
with machines that approximate, but do not match, human interaction.

What do you think? Is leaving a child with a robot better than leaving her in 
front of the TV? Can a robot parent raise a human child?
 
Some historical context to the latest discussion below the line on Labour, 
which you’ve continued to discuss after earlier articles we highlighted.

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4524985> ID3620306  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4524985> 30 September 2016 3:44pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84370447> 
After every period Labour has had in office there has been a backlash from the 
left. It happened in the 1950s after the Attlee government. The left were 
unhappy with NHS charges, the policy on nuclear weapons and towards the Soviet 
Union. This led to infighting which kept the party out of power for 13 years.

After the Wilson/Callaghan governments of the 60s and 70s we got the infamous 
i infighting of the 80s. Corbyn's mentor helped build a myth that the party had 
betrayed socialism and was just the same as the Tories. This helped keep Labour 
out of power for 18 years.

So now after the Blair/Brown governments we're getting the same thing. The 
left are trashing the parties record and focusing on the past. They cannot see 
what led Labour to success in the past. The only difference each time this 
happens is that the divisions get deeper and the time in the wilderness seems 
to get longer. 13 years, 18 years and how long now? 25-30?

Can Britain afford to wait that long or like the Liberal Party a century ago, 
has Labour's time just come to an end?
 
Each week we ask our team of moderators to highlight a couple of conversations 
they thought were particularly interesting or enjoyable.

The first we’ll choose was in reaction to this piece on diversity in 
advertising 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/hm-advert-diversity-ad-women>
, a response to a new H&M advert which, as the author describes with some 
scepticism, “features Normal Women™ doing Normal Things™”. You can click the 
links on the comments to follow the full conversation.

‘If this signals a change that includes more diversity going forward, then I’m 
in’

I thought the ad was gorgeous - sorry. How can you win? You put white thing 
women in an advert, you're not representative (true). You put a diverse range 
of women in an advert, you're pandering. True, there was something a bit 
tokenistic about the campaign, and they could have maybe done it a bit more 
subtly than having a bunch of "diverse" women in one advert saying "see how 
diverse we are???"
Then again, you have to start somewhere. If this signals a change in H&M's 
advertising that includes more diversity in all of their media going forward, 
then I'm in. Let's just see if they carry it forward.
Oh and on the unrelated paragraph about portraying mixed race couples - I had 
no idea it produced such backlash. I am a product of a mixed marriage myself, 
so I am frankly just bemused at furious reactions over mixed marriages and 
relationships. They've been a fact of life for thousands of years and have been 
increasingly common and will only get more common as air travel and 
multi-culturalism increases. I'm not even offended, I just find it highly 
amusing that there are still people out there who honestly believe that 
"mixing" is wrong. Next fact of life to get offended over - the sky is blue.

‘The problem is down to agencies insisting on hiring privately educated 
individuals with degrees’

I work in advertising. I've worked at several agencies and can tell you from 
experience that the problem is not down to gender imbalance (though this is 
definitely the case at the very senior levels). Nor is it necessarily down to a 
lack of ethnic diversity (though this still has a long way to go). In my 
opinion, the problem is down to these agencies insisting that they generally 
hire privately educated individuals with degrees. This means that my colleagues 
are effectively homogenised in their views and experiences. How then, is it 
possible for them to create ads which resonate with society at large, when they 
only hire individuals who have been living in a lovely middle-class bubble 
their whole lives? A lot of the products we make ads for would never be bought 
by such people. Rather, it's those in the council estates that flock to buy 
them en masse. And the disconnect between what they want, and what a lot of my 
colleagues think they want, is marked.

Okay, I've watched it. There were no women on the verge of obesity in there; 
there was no depressed and solitary-looking woman, there wasn't a woman with 
alopecia or rosacea. No one with MS, no amputee. I know why, you know why, so 
what's with the celebration of bullshit from H&M and Dove? This is just the 
voice in the doorman's earpiece saying, 'It's a flat night, let the people in

On Thursday Sadiq Khan unveiled the latest piece to occupy the fourth plinth 
in Trafalgar Square in London – a seven-metre high bronze thumbs up by 
Manchester-based artist David Shrigley.

<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2016/sep/29/david-shrigley-gives-thumbs-up-to-trafalgar-squares-fourth-plinth-video>
The Guardian’s Jonathan Jones calls it “phallic, ungainly and hysterically 
strident” –but gives a four star review

We can go one better than an art critic. Reader Aubrey Leahy

 will be better known to many commenters andGuardianWitness

contributors byhis username on site: fourthplinth 
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4318372>.

How could we not ask him for his thoughts?

Of his username he says: “Since I was a 14-year-old sea cadet in 1958, and 
part of a guard of honour celebrating Trafalgar Day, Trafalgar Square has 
always held a particular sweet spot and place in my heart.”


So what are his first impressions of the new piece occupying the plinth?

Perhaps thumbs up gives a nod to the fast-fading cheerful cockney spirit? It 
does seem to suit the plinth and convey the upbeat spirit of London. It’s 
certainly in keeping with the fact that each sculpture has been different. (My 
all time favorite remains Yinka Shonibare’sShip in a Bottle 
<http://www.yinkashonibarembe.com/press/past/hms-victory-returns-to-trafalgar/>
).

I suspect it won’t be long before it gets a hat or a traffic cone added (as 
Nelson wore for the Jubilee). The main problem for me is am very familiar with 
another similar sculpture of a thumb which this reminds me of (at Clos Pegase 
winery in the Napa Valley <http://thisismyhappiness.com/2012/04/30/clos-pegase/>
). It would be awfully unoriginal to give it a thumbs up, so will instead give 
it a pig Latin SupraPollice Verso <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollice_verso>.

So there we go – what do you think?

 
Dr Liz England comments on a story out this week showing mental illness has 
soared among young women 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/29/self-harm-ptsd-and-mental-illness-soaring-among-young-women-in-england-survey>
. She responds to the question – why are women more affected?

Women have always felt more comfortable coming forward and I don’t think men 
self-harm as much. Instead, they tend to turn to other things to ease their 
distress, such as alcohol. That’s why it’s important to have gender specific 
services. We are seeing more women with post traumatic stress disorder from 
domestic violence, after childbirth and from sexual violence they experience in 
relationships. Those sort of conditions need a different approach to ones we 
have as standard at the moment.

Similarly with men a different approach is also needed, and for them we need 
to make services and treatment accessible. We know that middle-aged men have 
the highest suicide rate, so what are we doing to get that group into treatment 
and support earlier. It’s good that we have identified these new statistics as 
if we know about these problems then we can plan services better and think, why 
is this happening?

Mental health problems are increasingly (there’s lots of reasons for this). I 
worry, in particular, about the impact of the media and social media. People 
are seeing things like self-harm on social media dn it makes it more accessible 
and we need to be really alert and able to talk to our children. We need to 
have that conversation around those issues and make sure they are safe.
 
Picture editor Joanna Ruck shares some of her images of the week.

First, the images from Aleppo have been particularly hard to look at this week 
and very graphic and distressing. There’s a gallery of images from Aleppo you 
can see here:

As a counterpoint to those images, it’s always nice to look at a panda falling 
over ...

But the picture that caused us the most amusement this week was Jeremy 
Corbyn’s photocall as he arrived to give his speech to the Labour Party 
conference. We couldn’t decide if he’d accidentally walked onto the set of a 
hair commercial or looked like a headmaster on A-level results day.

What makes a horrible boss?

Over delegation and micro management. We've just said goodbye to someone who 
took delegation to the extreme and palmed off everything they did not feel like 
doing. For them it was all about hand picking the tasks that gave them the 
right exposure and allowing plenty of time for telling everyone just how busy 
they were. The unfortunate staff under her were saddled with a lot of the grunt 
work and tasks above their pay grade, for which they recieved nothing but 
constant harrassment from the boss to get the work done. She walked away with a 
fat bonus and no parting recommendation to management that her staff receive 
similar.

The worst bosses are the ones who demand you get some piece of work done by 
last week, and then call a 5 hour meeting to discuss how all the work is going. 
Sigh.

* Liars

* Those more concerned with their careers than their staff

* Those who pass blame down

* Those who steal the achievements of those below them

* Micro-managers

* Those who are too afraid to delegate

* Those who pass on responsibility but not the authority to deliver

That's my list over the years and what I say to all my staff is that they all 
see these people, these horrible bosses, so why therefore do so many when their 
time comes, behave in the same manner.

Basically if you wouldn't like it going to yourself then don't do it to others.

That being said I've met far more bloody horrible staff in my time than 
managers, but then there are more staff and the managers unfortunately have 
more ability to cause significant damage.

Also one final point to make is that "managers" and not "leaders" and vice 
versa. Those are two distinct skill sets and being good at one does not mean 
you will be good at the other.
