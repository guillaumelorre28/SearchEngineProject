Barack Obama’s legacy is likely to come under attack once the Trump 
administration <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration> takes 
power in Washington this month. Here are five key areas in which battle is set 
to be joined.

Environment

Obama’s goal: vowed to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 and invest 
$150bn in energy-saving technologies. “Delay is no longer an option,” he said.

Obama’s achievement: persuaded China to join the Paris climate accord, the 
first comprehensive deal to lower emissions across nearly 200 countries. The 
solar industry now employs more Americans than coal mining.

Trump’s intentions: has vowed to pull out of the Paris agreement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/13/trump-looking-at-quickest-way-to-quit-paris-climate-agreement-says-report>
 and dismissed climate change as a Chinese-concocted hoax. But the green energy 
industry is now a major employer and not easily reversed.

Same-sex marriage

Obama’s goal: in November 2008, he said: “I believe marriage is between a man 
and a woman. I am not in favour of gay marriage.”

Obama’s achievement: the president “evolved” on the issue and became the first 
sitting president to endorse same-sex marriage, which in 2015 was affirmed by 
the supreme court as a constitutional right.

Trump’s intentions: in November, the president-elect said he was “fine” with 
the court’s opinion andcalled it “settled”.

 Trump has proclaimed himself a supporter of gay rights, although Republicans 
in Congress support legislation that would allow employers and business owners 
to discriminate.

Healthcare

Obama’s goal: campaigned on a platform of “universal” health insurance.

Obama’s achievement: the Affordable Care Act, the first US social safety net 
created in more than half a century, provided health insurance to 22 million 
people, though the system remains far from perfect.

Trump’s intentions: repeal and replace Obamacare immediately, although what 
that replacement will be remains vague, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/04/mike-pence-repeal-obama-healthcare-law-first>
 suggesting some elements may remain. Democrats warn that a sudden change could 
produce chaos and leave up to 30 million people without insurance.

Iran

Obama’s goal: prevent Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, a scenario identified 
by the US and its allies as the number one threat to Middle East and global 
security.

Obama’s achievement: despite opposition from Israel, the US reached an 
international agreement that saw Iran pour concrete into a reactor and ship 
most of its stockpile of low-enriched uranium abroad.

Trump’s intentions: tear up what he referred to last week as “the horrible 
Iran deal”.But on Friday Bob Corker, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/06/bob-corker-iran-nuclear-deal-enforcement-trump>
 the Republican chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, said the deal 
should be enforced more strictly, rather than dropped.

Jobs

Obama’s goal: prevent America from sinking into another Great Depression and 
halt the rise of unemployment.

Obama’s achievement: stabilisation and recovery. The administration says it 
has added jobs for a record 75 consecutive months, bringing unemployment down 
to 4.7%. But the labour force participation rate – the number of people in work 
or actively looking for it – has reached a low unseen since the 1970s.

Trump’s intentions: slash taxes and regulations, scrap or renegotiate trade 
deals, penalise companies that send jobs offshore and nominatea cabinet steeped 
in Wall Street.

 Critics warn such measures will benefit only the rich.
