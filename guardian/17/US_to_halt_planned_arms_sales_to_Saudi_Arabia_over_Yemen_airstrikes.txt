The US is preparing to halt planned arms sales to Saudi Arabia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia> because of the high death toll 
among civilians in the kingdom’s bombing campaign in Yemen.


Obama administration officials were quoted on Reuters, who broke the story, 
saying that the “systematic, endemic problems in Saudi Arabia’s targeting drove 
the US decision to halt a future weapons sale involving precision-guided 
munitions”.

“We’ve decided not to move forward with some foreign military sales cases for 
air-dropped munitions, PGMs (precision-guided munitions),” a US official said.

“That’s obviously a direct reflection of the concerns that we have about Saudi 
strikes that have resulted in civilian casualties

.”

A second official confirmed the decision to suspend the sale of certain 
weaponry.

The US move would leave the UK exposed diplomatically and faced with an 
awkward dilemma because of the scale of its arms sales to the kingdom and the 
presence of UK military personnel at the Saudi headquarters from where the 
bombing campaign is being conducted.


Andrew Smith of the UK-based Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) said: “Like 
the US, the UK has licensed billions of pounds worth of arms to Saudi forces. 
Like their US counterparts, UK arms companies have fuelled and profited from 
the destruction taking place. If even the US is questioning its support for 
Saudi Arabia, then why is the UK government pulling out all stops to support 
them? Why are human rights regarded as less important than arms company 
profits?”


Brendan O’Hara, the SNP’s defence spokesman, said the party had been urging 
the UK government to suspend arms sales to Saudi. “It is something the 
government has resisted and it must be embarrassing that the US takes the lead 
in suspending arms sales. How bad does a regime have to be for the UK 
government to act?” he asked.

The UK has staff at Saudi headquarters who are involved in giving advice on 
targeting. The UK Ministry of Defence has repeatedly said that its advice is 
limited to whether the targets comply with international law and that it does 
not help choose the targets.

But the US criticism of the Saudi targeting will raise even more questions 
about the UK presence. The US is to offer Saudi Arabia training in targeting.

Human rights organisations have protested about the scale of the bombing in 
the almost two-year-long Saudi action against the Houthis, who are backed by 
Iran. Yemen has become caught between Saudi and Iran, one of theproxy wars that 
the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, complained

.

Reuters reported that a specific arms sale already put on hold appeared to 
involve the sale of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of guidance systems 
manufactured by Raytheon Co that convert dumb bombs into precision-guided 
munitions that can more accurately hit their targets.


The UK has licensed over £3.3bn worth of arms to Saudi forces since the 
bombing ofYemen <https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen> began in March 2015 
and is engaged in negotiations to sell a new generation of fighter jets to the 
Saudi military.

UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia are currently subject to a judicial review, 
following an application by CAAT. A three-day review will take place in front 
of two judges in February.
