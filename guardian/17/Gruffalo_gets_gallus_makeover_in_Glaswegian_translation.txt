The wee gallus moose squares uptae an auld owl, a sleekit snake an a ginormous 
gruffalo in a new version of Julia Donaldson’s classic picture book The 
Gruffalo, now translated into Glaswegian.

Actor and comedian Elaine C Smith, known for her role as Rab C Nesbitt’s wife 
Mary Doll Nesbit, has written a Glaswegian version of Donaldson’s well-known 
opening to her children’s story, “A mouse took a stroll through a deep dark 
wood. A fox saw the mouse and the mouse looked good.” Smith writes, instead: “A 
gallus moose taen a dauner through a scary big wood. A fox clocked the moose an 
the moose looked good.”

The Glasgow <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/glasgow> Gruffalo is out this week 
from Itchy Coo, which is also home to translations of The Gruffalo into 
Dundonian Scots (“A moosie taen a daandir throo thi daip, derk waid. A tod saa 
that moosie an that moosie looked gaid”) and Shetlandic Scots (“Ida hert o a 
forest deep an dark, a perrie broon moose guid oot for a waak”). Illustrated by 
Axel Scheffler, The Gruffalo has sold more than 3m copies since it was first 
published in 1999.

The publisher also released a Scots version of Charlie and the Chocolate 
Factory last month, in which translator Matthew Fitt transformed the Oompa 
Loompas into the Heedrum-Hodrums, Violet Beauregarde into Violet Boakregarde 
and the Great Glass Elevator into Wullie Wonka’s Muckle Gless Lift.
