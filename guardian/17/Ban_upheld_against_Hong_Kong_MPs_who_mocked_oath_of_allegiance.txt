A Hong Kong <https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong> court has upheld a 
ban on two pro-independence lawmakers, a day after the government signalled it 
would seek to disqualify a third legislator in an unprecedented series of legal 
challenges.


A panel of three judges upheld a lower court’s ruling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/15/hong-kong-bans-pro-democracy-politicians-after-beijing-rewrites-oath-law>
 that Yau Wai-ching, 25, and Sixtus “Baggio” Leung, 30, were disqualified for 
not properly reading the oath of office. The pair have previously said they 
plan to take the case to the court of final appeal, Hong Kong’s highest court.

Lawmakers must swear allegiance 
<http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html> to “the Hong Kong 
special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China”, according to 
the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution.

The duo’s disqualification hinges on a dramatic swearing-in ceremony 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/hong-kong-pro-democracy-oath-snub-china>
 in October where they unfurled flags that said “Hong Kong is not China”, 
declared allegiance to the “Hong Kong nation” and used an expletive to refer to 
China.

In maintaining the ban on Yau and Leung, the judges said “the taking of an 
oath and pledging of allegiance are serious matters”.

Hong Kong’s government will likely use a similar argument as it aims to 
disqualify 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/hong-kong-seeks-ban-third-pro-democracy-member-of-parliament-lau-siu-lai>
 a third lawmaker, Lau Siu-lai, who read her oath incredibly slowly and later 
said her pace was a sign it was “fabricated”.

The court ruling has dealt a major blow to Hong Kong’s burgeoning independence 
movement, increasingly popular among the city’s youth who feel two decades of 
pro-democracy movements in the legislature have had little effect.
