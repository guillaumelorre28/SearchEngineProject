A thread of just 20km of ice is now preventing the 5,000 sq km mass from 
floating away, following the sudden expansion last month of a rift that has 
been steadily growing for more than a decade.

The iceberg, which is positioned on the most northern major ice shelf in 
Antarctica, known as Larsen C 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/13/thinning-antarctic-ice-shelf-could-contribute-to-sea-level-rise-says-study>
, is predicted to be one of the largest 10 break-offs ever recorded.

Professor Adrian Luckman, a scientist at Swansea University and leader of the 
UK’s Midas project <http://www.projectmidas.org/>, said in a statement: “After 
a few months of steady, incremental advance since the last event, the rift grew 
suddenly by a further 18km during the second half of December 2016. Only a 
final 20km of ice now connects an iceberg one quarter the size of Wales to its 
parent ice shelf.”

The separation of the iceberg “will fundamentally change the landscape of the 
Antarctic Peninsula” and could trigger a wider break-up of the Larsen C ice 
shelf, he added.

“If it doesn’t go in the next few months, I’ll be amazed,” Luckman told BBC 
News <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-38522954>.


Antarctic ice sheet collapse will cause sea levels to rise. So what's new?

Ice shelves are vast expanses of ice floating on the sea, several hundred 
metres thick, at the edge of glaciers.


Scientists fear the loss of ice shelves will destabilise the frozen 
continent’s inland glaciers. And while the splitting off of the iceberg would 
not contribute to rising sea levels, the loss of glacial ice would.

Martin O’Leary, also of Swansea University, said: “It just makes the whole 
shelf less stable. If it were to collapse there would be nothing holding the 
glaciers up and they would start to flow quite quickly indeed.”

O’Leary added that while calving is a natural process that happens every 
decade or so and is not driven by climate change, the disintegration of a major 
shelf could accelerate the melting of glacial ice linked to warming oceans.

Several ice shelves have cracked up around northern parts of Antarctica in 
recent years, including theLarsen B that disintegrated in 2002

“We have previously shown <http://www.the-cryosphere.net/9/1223/2015/> that 
the new configuration will be less stable than it was prior to the rift, and 
that Larsen C may eventually followthe example of its neighbour Larsen B 
<http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldOfChange/larsenb.php>, which 
disintegrated in 2002 following a similar rift-induced calving event,” the 
Midas project website said.

The scientists predict that when the vast chunk of ice eventually breaks away 
it will drift gently out to sea, with smaller pieces splintering off. “It would 
be a very dramatic event if you were standing next to it, but probably not in 
the grand scheme of things,” said O’Leary.
