Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to 
help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next 
Saturday’s paper.

This week’s question:

We live in a big old Victorian house, but on a low income. We turn radiators 
off in rooms we don’t use. Now a friend says it’s a false economy, risking damp 
and making the whole house cold. Should we turn them back on, or do you have 
any other tips?
