It’s impossible not to feel a bit envious of Nordic nations. Norway, Denmark 
andSweden <https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden> were so accomplished at 
recycling that by 2014 they had no need for landfill. Just like Nordic prisons, 
the landfills are empty. Now Denmark even has hygge, a system for living that 
combines cosiness and chunky knits with sustainability, and an enviable design 
aesthetic. What’s not to like?

But Sweden normally gets the gold star. One of the first countries to 
implement a heavy tax on fossil fuels in 1991, it now sources almost half its 
electricity from renewable resources. The ruling coalition (Green and Social 
Democrat) has just announced plans to slash VAT on repairs to bicycles, clothes 
and shoes from 25% to 12%, in a big effort to drive sustainability.

No wonder Swedes are regularly touted as the most sustainable nation. The only 
problem is, it’s not necessarily true according to Johan Rockstrom of the
Stockholm Resilience Centre <http://www.stockholmresilience.org/>, someone who 
knows who is, and isn’t, overstepping the mark

Rockstrom points to the fact that the much praised Swedish psyche that prizes 
responsibility doesn’t actually add up to impressively low emissions. Two years 
ago, a World Wide Fund for Nature survey of ecological performance from 152 
countries placed Sweden in the bottom 10 (ahead of the UK and behind Kuwait, 
that came first). Rockstrom confirms what other economists and sustainability 
experts have suggested: wealthy Swedes are bumping up their carbon footprint 
with endless holidays. Meanwhile the nation remains dependent on imports (with 
a lot of embodied carbon). It’s not easy being green, or a Swede, and not at 
all easy being a green Swede.

The big picture: ugly food

With their book Ugly Food: Overlooked and Undercooked, Richard Horsey and Tim 
Wharton have become cheerleaders for those vegetables, animal parts and fish 
species deemed so unattractive that they go to waste. With photographs by Tanya 
Ghosh, it Includes tricks you need to prepare undervalued ingredients with 
ease. Even chicken feet or pig’s cheeks suddenly look a whole lot more 
appetising.

 Dramatic questions: World Factory Photograph: David Sandison 
Sustainable fashion is getting its theatrical moment in the spotlight. World 
Factory (with the strapline ‘Made in China. Sold in Britain. Worn by You’) is 
an interactive theatre performance where you, as the audience, have to get 
stuck into the fashion supply chain, role playing and making decisions. Will 
you be an ethical factory owner or will profits always come first? In the rag 
trade, can anyone ever really win? Zoë Svendsen and Simon Daw collaborated with 
Shanghai-based theatre director Zhao Chuan to pool research and develop the 
project. Nobody said it would be easy, but Metis Arts has come up with a 
brilliant way of helping us to engage with the complexity of the fashion supply 
chain. The usual division between performers and audience dissolves, we are 
provoked to engage with real problems in a realistic way.
