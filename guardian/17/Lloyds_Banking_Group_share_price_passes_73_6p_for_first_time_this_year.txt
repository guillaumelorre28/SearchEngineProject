Shares in Lloyds Banking Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group> have passed the 
level at which taxpayers break even on their stake in the bailed-out bank for 
the first time this year.

The move through 73.6p will be closely watched by George Osborne. The 
chancellor was forced to postpone an offering of the bank’s shares to the public

as a resut of the turmoil in the markets in the start of the year.

The shares closed at 73.74p on Wednesday, up 1.8%.

Even though the retail offering is on hold, Osborne can offload shares in 
small tranches to professional investors every time the shares rise past 73.6p 
mark. In December, this so-called trading plan was extended to the end of June.

The dip in Lloyds’ share price, whichhas been below 60p this year, means 
little headway has been made in reducing the taxpayers’ stake below 9%. The 
shares last traded above 73.6p on 29 December.

Osborne has pledged to offer £2bn of shares to the public at a 5% discount to 
the prevailing price

.

Earlier this month, the Treasury said it had received a £130m dividend payment 
from Lloyds, taking the total it has received from the bank to £16.8bn. At the 
time, Treasury minister Harriett Baldwin, reiterated the government’s intention 
to conduct an offering of shares to the public later this year.

 The taxpayer stake was 43% following Lloyds’ takeover of HBOS during the 2008 
crisis. It has been reduced through a series of transactions since. The first 
was September 2013 when£3.2bn of shares were sold at 75p a share to 
institutional investors
