Fees £9,000 a year for full-time undergraduates in 2016-17. £28,000 for 
international students.

Bursaries HYMS students on the MBBS programme starting in 2016, including 
graduate entrants, registered either at the University of York or the 
University of Hull will be eligible for bursaries.


Students <https://www.theguardian.com/education/students> with a residual 
household income of up to £25,000 will receive an accommodation bursary of 
£2,400 for each year of study. This is paid as a cash sum in all cases when the 
student is not in university accommodation.


Students intercalating in HYMS and undertaking undergraduate study will have 
access to the same financial support. HYMS entrants will also be eligible for 
the Realising Opportunities and Next Step York Progression bursaries regardless 
of whether they register with the University of Hull or York. Visit
