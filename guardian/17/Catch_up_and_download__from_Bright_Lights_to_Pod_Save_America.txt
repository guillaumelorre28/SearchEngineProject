Bright Lights
Affecting in its own right, this HBO film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/10/bright-lights-review-debbie-reynolds-carrie-fisher>
 looking at the relationship betweenCarrie Fisher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/27/carrie-fisher-celebrity-tributes>
 and her motherDebbie Reynolds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/29/debbie-reynolds-obituary-singin-in-the-rain-actor>
 was lent an almost unbearable poignancy by the pair’s deaths within a day of 
each other just before Christmas. If that makes Bright Lights seem glum, it 
really isn’t: for the most part, this documentary acts as a celebration of a 
delightfully eccentric mother-daughter bond. It’s also at times, extremely 
funny, with Fisher responsible for some great one-liners: “If you die when 
you’re fat, are you a fat ghost, or do they go back to a more flattering time?” 
she asks, mock-guilelessly at one point. Essential viewing.

Annie Mac: Who Killed The Night
The recent reopening of Fabric 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/07/fabric-reopens-crowds-in-high-spirits-as-legendary-club-returns>
, while welcome, obscured a troubling truth about the rapid atrophying of 
nightlife in the UK, with almost half of the country’s clubs having closed over 
the past decade. In this BBC3 doc, DJ andRadio 1 host Annie Mac 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wqdc> looks at the various factors 
contributing to clubbing’s demise, from property development to punitive 
policing. Can anything be done to arrest this demise?

Over the past few years, Yates has morphed from mildly irritating kids’ TV 
mainstay to worthy social documentarian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/28/reggie-yates-in-a-texan-jail-bbc3-documentary>
, unafraid to singe his hands on hot-potato topics such as race, sexuality, 
drugs and religion. Here, he travels to Australia, seeking to understand the 
appalling social disparity between white and indigenous communities; the former 
often guilty of indulging in ingrained institutional racism, the latter 
suffering inordinate rates of unemployment and addiction. This offers more 
questions than answers, but is no less worthy for that.

Netflix

Voltron: Legendary Defender
This animated series, co-produced by DreamWorks, conjures up memories of the 
golden age of Saturday morning kids’ TV, mainly because it’s a remake of a 
series from that era – the 1984-85 series of the same name. The gist, for those 
who weren’t there first time round, is that four military cadets control robot 
lions that together form a universe-defending mega-bot. Sort of a cross between 
Transformers and Power Rangers, then. Still, it features enough hints of the 
original to sate any nostalgia-seekers, and slick enough cartoonery to keep 
pace with its modern rivals. Season two launches this week.

Podcast

Pod Save America
One of the best pods of 2016, political chat-fest Keepin’ It 1600 
<https://theringer.com/keepin-it-1600-podcast-politics-election-jon-favreau-dan-pfeiffer-220924af4c94#.9gfdsboxq>
 is no more. But that’s only because its hosts – ex-Obama staffers Jon Favreau 
(not that one), Jon Lovett, Tommy Vietor and Dan Pfeiffer – have upped sticks 
and created their own politics site,Crooked Media <https://getcrookedmedia.com/>
, formed in opposition to the incoming Potus. This flagship podcast takes in 
largely the same format as 1600, with acerbic takedowns of Trump and the party 
he belongs to, but there’s more of an activist bent: the opening episode has a 
discussion with the organisers ofthe Women’s March on Washington 
<https://www.womensmarch.com/>, scheduled for the very day of the Donald’s 
inauguration.
