In the third week of January bank balances are often running low just as bills 
start arriving for Christmas borrowing. It’s no wonder that debt charities 
report that it is one of their busiest times of year.

We are running a live advice clinic on Monday 18 January to answer readers’ 
questions about debt and how to deal with it.


If you feel overwhelmed by your financial situation, need information about 
debt management plans and the other options open to you, or advice on how to 
deal with your creditors, our experts can help.

 Rachel Connor, a debt adviser from advice charity StepChange 
<http://www.stepchange.org/DebtAwarenessWeek.aspx> will be online to answer 
your questions.

If your debt is less of a problem but you want to find out if you could pay 
less for it, personal finance expert Andrew Hagger, fromMoneycomms 
<http://moneycomms.co.uk/>, may be able to offer guidance on finding the right 
credit card or loan for your circumstances.

Please post your questions below and our advisers will be online from 1.30pm 
on Monday to help.

The advice will be of a general nature. If you want to speak to an adviser for 
individual help,you can find information on debt services here
