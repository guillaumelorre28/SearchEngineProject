Afternoon summary

 * Tory and Labour MPs have turned out in force to vote down an SNP motion 
accusing Tony Blair of misleading parliament about Iraq and demanding a fresh 
investigation by a Commons committee into his conduct. The motion was defeated 
by 439 votes to 70, a majority of 369. 
 * Theresa May has defended her refusal to guarantee the rights of EU 
nationals currently living in the UK, telling prime minister’s questions that 
Donald Tusk’s letter blaming Britain for the uncertainty showed it was vital to 
maintain a bargaining hand. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/30/theresa-may-defends-refusal-guarantee-eu-citizens-rights-uk>
 * Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has said Theresa May should 
unilaterally pass legislation to secure the rights of up to 3 million European 
Union citizens to stay in Britain or risk souring the tone of the Brexit talks. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/30/keir-starmer-uk-guarantee-eu-citizens-rights-talks-brexit>
 * Liberal Democrats in Richmond Park are predicting they will narrowly snatch 
the west London seat from Zac Goldsmith, after a campaigning blitz in which the 
party claimed activists spoke to more than 30,000 voters. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/30/lib-dems-eye-victory-over-zac-goldsmith-richmond-park>
The singerBob Geldof has been campaigning for the Lib Dems in the constituency 
today. He said: 
I know Zac Goldsmith and I like the guy, but the plain fact is that Zac is a 
political failure. Worst of all of is that he’s not only failed but betrayed 
the people of Richmond, who like the rest of London, voted overwhelmingly to 
stay in Europe. How can Goldsmith represent the opinion of the people of 
Richmond in parliament when he is the poster-boy for the Brexiteers and is 
urging the Government daily on its catastrophic course? The fightback can begin 
in Richmond tomorrow; Zac has to go.

Or, “Zac is crap,” as Geldof also put it.

 * Robert Chote, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, has said he 
expects Brexit to cost the government £12bn a year.(See 3.51pm.)

less than a year after the health service received a “good settlement” from the 
government.

 * Theresa May has weighed in on the government’s decision to approve four 
white men as Channel 4 board members, but reject a highly qualified minority 
ethnic woman, saying that the public appointments process “is about who is 
right for the job”.

 * More than 200 opposition MPs and backbench Tories, including Emily 
Thornberry and Michael Gove, are supporting a campaign for airdrops of aid into 
Syria, meaning there would be a majority in parliament for the humanitarian 
plan if the government were to give its support.

One conclusion that could be drawn from the result of the vote is that, even 
though quite a lot of MPs (Tories and Labour) dislikeTony Blair 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair>, they hate the SNP even more.

Here is the key exchange between Rachel Reeves and Robert Chote earlier where 
Chote said Brexit could cost the country £12bn a year.

RR: You estimate the cumulative increase in borrowing as a result of the 
referendum between 2016-17 and 2020-21 as £58.7bn. Is it fair to interpret that 
figure as the cost of Brexit?

RC: Well, we’ve made a series of judgments as you can see. I’m wary of adding 
up nominal numbers because the more years you add up, the larger the number you 
get and that’s not necessarily terribly helpful. If you look at the overall 
level of the change in the budget deficit, before any policy measures, it’s 
about 1.1% of GDP. The Brexit element of that is about 0.5% of GDP. So that 
would be one way of thinking of it.

If you look at the adjustment we’ve made, and compare it to the adjustments 
we’ve made on productivity in past forecasts, it’s the third largest of the 
ones that we have made over the last 14 forecasts. So it’s not insignificant. 
But it’s not the biggest.

RR: Do you think a better way of looking at it is to say it’s costing half a 
percent of GDP?

RC: In the public finances over this period, that would be a reasonable way of 
looking at it?

RR: What would that be in pounds?

RC: Well, if you’ve got roughly £60bn over roughly five years, it’s roughly 
£12bn a year, would be another way to do it.

Q: You have created a big headline saying the economy will be badly hit 
because fewer people will come here because of Brexit.

Chote says the OBR has to make an assumption about what migration will be. It 
sets out its reasoning.

Q: But you have built in a policy that does not exist - stricter controls.

Chote says the OBR does not know what the government will do. It has made a 
transparent set of assumptions.

Q: What is the trend in net migration since the end of June?

Chote says he does not have those figures.

Q: Why are you assuming that the government will have more controls over 
immigration?

Chote says that is what the government says it wants to do.

Q: For the last few years you have been under-estimated net migration. But now 
you are assuming it will fall. Isn’t that guesswork?

Chote says it is a transparent assumption on which the OBR has based its 
forecast.

Q: Will your forecast be 100% wrong?

Yes, says Chote. That is in the nature of forecasts. 

But he says the OBR’s forecasts are more optimistic than some others. That 
means there is a net downside risk, he says. (That means, on balance, it is 
more likely that the chances are that things could turn out worse.)

Q; Newspapers give prominence to your forecasts. But they never explain the 
risks?

Chote says he is not sure there is a great weight of people out their who have 
great faith in forecasts. And some newspapers are very critical of the 
forecasts.

Labour’s John Mann is asking the questions now.

Q: Do average Germans leave more to their children?

No idea, says Prof Sir Stephen Nickell.

Mann says Germans pay less in mortgages. So they should have more money to 
leave to their children.

Nickell says he does not know what Germans leave. But most Britons do not 
leave big estates to their children.

Mann says he is making a point about productivity.

The singerBob Geldof has been campaigning for the Lib Dems in the constituency

I know Zac Goldsmith and I like the guy, but the plain fact is that Zac is a 
political failure. Worst of all of is that he’s not only failed but betrayed 
the people of Richmond, who like the rest of London, voted overwhelmingly to 
stay in Europe. How can Goldsmith represent the opinion of the people of 
Richmond in parliament when he is the poster-boy for the Brexiteers and is 
urging the Government daily on its catastrophic course? The fightback can begin 
in Richmond tomorrow; Zac has to go.

Or, “Zac is crap,” as Geldof also put it.

One conclusion that could be drawn from the result of the vote is that, even 
though quite a lot of MPs (Tories and Labour) dislikeTony Blair

The Iraq/Blair debate has just finished.

Mike Penning, the defence minister, concluded by saying the government did not 
see the need for a new inquiry and would not be backing the motion.
 
Here is the key exchange between Rachel Reeves and Robert Chote earlier where 
Chote said Brexit could cost the country £12bn a year.

RR: You estimate the cumulative increase in borrowing as a result of the 
referendum between 2016-17 and 2020-21 as £58.7bn. Is it fair to interpret that 
figure as the cost of Brexit?

RC: Well, we’ve made a series of judgments as you can see. I’m wary of adding 
up nominal numbers because the more years you add up, the larger the number you 
get and that’s not necessarily terribly helpful. If you look at the overall 
level of the change in the budget deficit, before any policy measures, it’s 
about 1.1% of GDP. The Brexit element of that is about 0.5% of GDP. So that 
would be one way of thinking of it.

If you look at the adjustment we’ve made, and compare it to the adjustments 
we’ve made on productivity in past forecasts, it’s the third largest of the 
ones that we have made over the last 14 forecasts. So it’s not insignificant. 
But it’s not the biggest.

RR: Do you think a better way of looking at it is to say it’s costing half a 
percent of GDP?

RC: In the public finances over this period, that would be a reasonable way of 
looking at it?

RR: What would that be in pounds?

RC: Well, if you’ve got roughly £60bn over roughly five years, it’s roughly 
£12bn a year, would be another way to do it.
 
Q: You have created a big headline saying the economy will be badly hit 
because fewer people will come here because of Brexit.

Chote says the OBR has to make an assumption about what migration will be. It 
sets out its reasoning.

Q: But you have built in a policy that does not exist - stricter controls.

Chote says the OBR does not know what the government will do. It has made a 
transparent set of assumptions.
 
Q: What is the trend in net migration since the end of June?

Chote says he does not have those figures.

Q: Why are you assuming that the government will have more controls over 
immigration?

Chote says that is what the government says it wants to do.

Q: For the last few years you have been under-estimated net migration. But now 
you are assuming it will fall. Isn’t that guesswork?

Chote says it is a transparent assumption on which the OBR has based its 
forecast.
 
Q: Will your forecast be 100% wrong?

Yes, says Chote. That is in the nature of forecasts. 

But he says the OBR’s forecasts are more optimistic than some others. That 
means there is a net downside risk, he says. (That means, on balance, it is 
more likely that the chances are that things could turn out worse.)

Q; Newspapers give prominence to your forecasts. But they never explain the 
risks?

Chote says he is not sure there is a great weight of people out their who have 
great faith in forecasts. And some newspapers are very critical of the 
forecasts.
