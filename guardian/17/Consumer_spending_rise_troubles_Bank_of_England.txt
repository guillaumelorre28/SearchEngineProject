Appearing before the cross-party Treasury select committee alongside the 
Bank’s governor, Mark Carney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/24/german-trade-low-mark-carney-us-growth-live>
, Andy Haldane warned that consumer credit, in particular personal loans, had 
been “picking up at a rate of knots. That ultimately might be an issue that the 
financial policy committee [FPC] might want to look at fairly carefully.”

The Financial Policy Committee (FPC), created after the financial crisis, is 
meant to prevent a future crash by allowing the Bank to take action in 
particular markets without using the blunter tool of interest rates. Chaired by 
the governor,it has 10 members

include Haldane.

The FPC has already stepped in to constrain mortgage lending but its powers to 
confront a credit bubble are untested. Thelatest data

 from the Bank showed the rate of growth of consumer credit picking up sharply.

Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, 
said: “The FPC has huge new powers which only small numbers of the public have 
so far been aware of, and it is particularly important that we hold them 
accountable. Many of these decisions were formerly the preserve of politicians.”

Carney told MPs he was limited as to how much he could say about the FPC, as 
he was in “purdah”, as its next meeting approached; but he confirmed the rapid 
pace of credit growth was something it might need to look at.

He added that the separate monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets 
interest rates, has to take into account the historically high debt levels of 
Britain’s households as it made interest rate decisions.

“Without question, more indebted households are more vulnerable,” he said. 
“The pressure on households because of the debt burden is significant. There is 
less margin for error.”

However, the governor also reiterated that he believed the moment for raising 
interest rates was approaching. “The question in my mind is when is the right 
time for interest rates to increase,” he said.

Carney was supported by an independent MPC member, the American economist 
Kristin Forbes, who has previously taken a hawkish stance. Forbes said the jobs 
market, which the Bank has been watching closely for signs that wage inflation 
was emerging, appeared to be improving. “A number of measures we look at are 
back to pre-crisis levels. All in all, the evidence is of quite a tight labour 
market,” she said.

The governor has stressed that the decision about whether to tighten monetary 
policy is likely to “come into sharper relief” at the turn of the year.

While just one MPC member, Ian McCafferty, has so far voted for higher 
borrowing costs, awidely anticipated rate rise by the US Federal Reserve in 
December

 is expected to open the way for higher UK rates.

However, the hearing also underlined the divisions about the shape of the 
economy within the Bank, with Haldane presenting written testimony underlining 
his judgment that interest rates are as likely to move down as up.

“Given the balance of risks, I have a neutral stance on the future direction 
of monetary policy. In my view, policy needs to be poised to move in either 
direction in the period ahead, depending on how the data and risks, domestic 
and international, play out.”

Carney also rejected the idea Haldane discussed in a recent speech, of 
abolishing physical cash at some point in the future, to allow interest rates 
to be made negative.


When MP Steve Baker raised the issue, the governor, who referred to his 
colleague throughout as “Mr Haldane”, said: “Just to be clear, there are no 
plans to abolish cash at the Bank of England. As Mr Haldane just said, it was a 
thought experiment.”

Asked whether, as Haldane suggested, rates might have to fall further from 
their record low of 0.5%,Mark Carney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney> made clear he did not 
believe that was a “likely scenario”.


Gertjan Vlieghe, the new independent member of the MPC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/28/bank-england-gertjan-vlieghe-new-mpc-member>
, expressed scepticism about the idea that fresh measures – such as direct cash 
transfers to consumers, known as “helicopter money” – might be needed to 
stimulate the economy. “I do think there are really big problems with 
helicopter money, because essentially it’s stating that we’ve abandoned our 
inflation target,” he said.
