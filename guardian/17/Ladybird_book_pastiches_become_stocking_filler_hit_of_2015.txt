Nostalgia for the days of learning to read with Peter and Jane appears to have 
made Ladybird’s series of spoof titles for grownups a must-buy thisChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas>, with more than 600,000 
copies of the mini-hardbacks sold in less than two months.

The eight books, which range from How it Works: The Husband – “As the husband 
grows older, he starts to make lots of funny little noises” – to The Ladybird 
Book of Mindfulness, use original Ladybird artwork with new, deadpan text from 
Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris.

“Leanne has been staring at this beautiful tree for five hours. She was meant 
to be in the office. Tomorrow she will be fired. In this way, mindfulness has 
solved her work-related stress,” runs the mindfulness spoof, later adding, 
alongside an image of a woman in a field of flowers: “Sophie is concentrating 
on her breath. It smells of Frazzles. She says she has light for breakfast, air 
for lunch and love for supper, but Sophie has also secretly had some Frazzles.”

Penguin originally printed 15,000 copies of each title. By mid-November, it 
had 1m copies in print, and that number has now grown to 1.5m, the publisher 
said on Monday. According to book sales monitor Nielsen, it has sold 627,150 
copies of the eight books to date, while the Bookseller said that all eight 
were in the top 50 last week, with the biggest sellers How It Works: The 
Husband and How It Works: The Wife in the top 10.

The titles, which also include The Ladybird Book of Sheds, The Ladybird Book 
of The Hipster and The Ladybird Book of the Mid-Life Crisis, have proved so 
popular that some bookshops have struggled to get their hands on stock,reported 
the Bookseller

.

At Waterstones, non-fiction buyer Richard Humphreys said that the chain was 
doing “amazingly well” with the books. “These strong sales are down to a number 
of factors: it’s been Ladybird’s 100th anniversary this year and almost 
everybody will have a fond memory of the Ladybird books of their childhood,” he 
said.

“The writers have a fantastic track record writing for TV – working on 
Miranda, Charlie Brooker and Mitchell and Webb – and they have taken the 
national treasure that is the Ladybird brand and produced these very funny, 
cynical and brilliant books. They have been the perfect humour stocking-filler 
this Christmas.”
