Unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 11 years in September in a further 
indication that Britain’s employers have largely shrugged off the Brexit vote.

Official figures show the unemployment rate was 4.8%, the lowest since 
September 2005 and downfrom 4.9% in August

 and 5.3% a year earlier.

The fall in unemployment by 37,000 from the previous quarter to 1.6 million 
people was held up by the employment minister, Damian Hinds, as the mark of a 
strong labour market in the wake of the EU referendum.

He also welcomed the employment rate, which remained at a record high of 
74.5%, and figures showing that annual wage rises, excluding bonuses, nudged 
higher to 2.4% from 2.3% in August and 2.1% in July.

“Growth is being fuelled by full-time professional jobs while wages are 
continuing to perform strongly, which underlines the resilience of the UK 
labour market,” he said.

But figures from the Office for National Statistics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics> (ONS) revealed 
the claimant count in October jumped by its highest number since May, and 
analysts warned that the rate at which employers were taking on new workers had 
slowed dramatically.

Employment growth dropped to 49,000 in the three months to September from 
106,000 in August and 173,000 in the three months to July, while the claimant 
count jumped by almost 10,000 to 803,300.

The figures for the three months to September are the first health check of 
the labour market where all the data applies to the period following the 
referendum.

 and Paris-based thinktank the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) had all predicted that a UK vote to leave the EU would take 
its toll on employers and push up unemployment.

Most forecasters now expect GDP growth to slow and inflation to rise in the 
coming months, overtaking wage rises and threatening the living standards of 
most workers during 2017.


The Scotiabank economist Alan Clarke said: “Our only hope is that wage 
inflation will rise in tandem with inflation. However, I suspect that given the 
leads and lags, wages will not rise quickly enough to offset the squeeze to 
real incomes in 2017.”


John Philpott, the director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said that while 
the post-Brexit period had proved calmer than many had previously thought, the 
prospect of leaving the EU was unlikely to aid productivity growth, which 
remains stuck at 0.4%.

“When higher price inflation is also in the pipeline, even a strong labour 
market may struggle to deliver sustained real wage improvements for most UK 
workers.”

The only compensation for mortgage borrowers will be that interest rates 
remain low. Bank of England’s deputy governor, Sir Jon Cunliffe, said 
Threadneedle Street was likely to “look through” rises in inflation next year 
if they are driven mainly by the post-Brexit fall in sterling.

In a speech at Manchester University, he said global forces were keeping 
general inflationary pressures near zero, which meant central banks would be 
forced to keep interest rates lower for longer.

The Federation of Small Businesses said the continuing rise in self-employment 
was another indication of the shift to insecure employment and the increasingly 
fragile state of the labour market.

The number of self-employed people has increased by 213,000 since the same 
time last year to reach 15.1% of those in work.


Mike Cherry, the FSB’s national chairman, said: “The UK has so far failed to 
keep pace with the rapid rise of self-employment. These figures are another 
signal that more needs to be done to support the self-employed, including on 
developing a clear legal definition of self-employment and on issues like 
access to mortgages and income protection, and addressing the discrepancies 
between the self-employed and employees in the social security system, such as 
on maternity pay.”

Independent thinktank Fathom Consulting said the uncertainty generated by the 
Brexit vote “will go on for months, if not years”, hitting business investment 
first, and resulting in greater job losses.

ONS statistician David Freeman said the slowdown in employment growth showed 
the labour market “might be cooling”.


He added that the limited information on the flow of foreign workers “suggests 
the referendum outcome and subsequent devaluation of sterling has had little 
impact so far on the number of EU workers in the UK labour force”.
