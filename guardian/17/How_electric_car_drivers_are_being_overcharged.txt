As a relatively new owner of a Nissan Leaf, I support entirely the need for 
adequate provision of charge points (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/28/more-charge-points-needed-urgently-for-switch-to-electric-cars>
, 29 November). The ecotricity charging points at motorway services are great, 
even if they are now not free. But you can now only pay using a mobile phone 
app – not much use for my wife whose phone is too old to run the app, and not 
much use for anyone if their phone is lost or broken. What is wrong with a 
swipe card, as offered by Charge your Car at other charging points? But the 
biggest absurdity, as employed by all charging points, is that you pay by 
charging session, not by the amount of electricity you use. In a petrol or 
diesel car in an area with few fuel stations, you will top up whenever you have 
the opportunity even if it means putting in only, say, a quarter of a tank. 
Electric car users may need to follow that routine, but will have to pay the 
same however much electricity they need.
