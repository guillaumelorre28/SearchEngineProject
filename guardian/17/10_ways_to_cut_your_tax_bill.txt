For many people this month means tackling one of the dreariest jobs of the 
year – filling in a tax return ahead of the 31 January deadline. But there are 
numerous ways that you can legally reduce your bill by using rebates and 
allowances, without resorting to dodgy tactics. Some are new tax breaks that 
have only come into force in recent years, while others have always been 
available but are little known.

1 The marriage allowance – save up to £432
 This works if one person in a couple is a low earner, but millions of people 
are failing to take it up. Since April 2015 couples in which one person pays no 
tax because their income is less than the personal allowance (currently 
£11,000) have been able to transfer £1,100 of that allowance to their 
tax-paying partner. The rebate is worth £220 a year. It only applies if the 
earning partner (married or civil partnership) earns £11,000-£43,000. So far it 
has only been taken up by 1.3 million of the eligible 4.2 million people. 
Applicants can backdate their claim to the previous tax year, and receive a 
payment of up to £432.

This applies whether you have to fill in a tax return or not. Go to 
Gov.uk/marriage-allowance <https://www.gov.uk/marriage-allowance> to claim.

Meanwhile, given that everyone gets a personal tax allowance (the amount of 
income each of us can receive without paying any tax, currently £11,000) – it 
makes no sense for one person in a couple to pay tax on their savings or 
buy-to-let investment, particularly at a higher rate, while the other pays 
nothing. You can shift savings and assets into an account in your partner’s 
name. Richard Morley, tax partner at accountants BDO, says couples can give 
each other up to £11,100 a year without incurring capital gains tax.

The first £1,000 of interest you receive from savings is tax-free if you are a 
basic-rate taxpayer

2 Share dividend income – now virtually tax-free
Did you know that since April 2016, the first £5,000 you receive in share 
dividends is tax-free, meaning you don’t have to declare any income below that. 
If you receive more than £5,000, basic-rate taxpayers have to declare and pay 
7.5% tax while higher-rate taxpayers pay 32.5%. It makes investing in shares 
for an income an attractive, though of course much riskier, proposition 
compared to deposit accounts.

3 Pay no tax on your savings
Under the new Personal Savings Allowance, the first £1,000 of interest you 
receive from savings is now also tax-free if you are a basic-rate taxpayer. If 
you are a higher-rate taxpayer the threshold is £500. It is only if your 
savings income exceeds the allowance that any tax is due on it.Tax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/tax> is no longer deducted at source by the 
banks/building societies – if tax is due you can pay it via self-assessment or 
have it deducted via PAYE through an adjustment in your tax code.

Higher-rate taxpayers should remember they can invest £15,240 in tax-free Isas 
each year – in either cash or shares.

4 Claim back some money on charitable donations
If you are a higher-rate taxpayer and have made gift-aided charitable 
donations during the year you can claim back the higher-rate tax you have paid. 
If you donated £100 to your favourite charity, the total value of your donation 
was £125, and you can claim back £25 if you pay tax at 40% (£125 × 20%). 
National Trust membership (currently £111 a year for a family) is worth a 
£27.75 rebate to higher-rate taxpayers, provided it was gift aided.

5 Any mileage in this allowance?
Staff paid a mileage allowance to use their own car can offset some cash if 
their employer pays them less per mile than the permitted rate. If you run a 
car or van and are paid less than 45p a mile for the first 10,000 business 
miles travelled you can claim the difference. For any business mileage in 
excess of 10,000 miles you can claim 25p per mile.

6 Professional/union fees are deductible in some cases
HM Revenue & Customs has a list of approved bodies 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/professional-bodies-approved-for-tax-relief-list-3/approved-professional-organisations-and-learned-societies>
 whose fees you can deduct from your income before tax. The National Union of 
Teachers (£177 a year) and Norfolk Association of Agricultural Valuers are on 
the list. The National Union of Journalists isn’t.

7 ... And so are some uniform costs
HMRC has agreed flat-rate deductions – typically £80-£140 a year – for 
employees working in a longlist of different 
<https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim32712> 
occupations who are required to wear a uniform. For example, prison officers 
can claim £80 a year. If your occupation isn’t listed you may still be able to 
claim a standard annual amount of £60 in tax relief.

8 Airbnb – it’s tax-free up to a point
 If you have been taking in guests during the year via Airbnb, or you have 
housed students or a lodger, you don’t have to declare any income of up to 
£7,500 (once costs are deducted) as it comes under the auspices of the Rent a 
Room scheme, says Morley. Incomes above that amount must be declared in the 
usual way.

It’s a similar story for those who buy and sell on auction sites. From next 
April any income of up to £1,000 a year gained in this way will no longer have 
to be declared, says Morley.

However, money earned in the last tax year should be declared – minus 
reasonable costs.

Be aware that HMRC is reportedly targeting individuals and businesses who earn 
substantially more a year, and is comparing payments data with tax returns to 
catch those not declaring large incomes from eBay and Airbnb.

9 Claim if you do other work
 If you earn some extra money in a self-employed capacity, deduct all 
reasonable costs before you declare it. If you work from home you can claim a 
proportion of costs, such as lighting, heating, cleaning, insurance, mortgage 
interest, council tax, water rates and general maintenance. If one room out of 
your home’s 10 is used one day a week, do the maths to come up with a 
reasonable deduction. HMRC won’t allow you to deduct your full phone and 
broadband costs as it assumes you incur these anyway.

Note that if you earn less than £1,000 a year in this way you will able to 
disregard it after next April – as per the eBay rule.

10 Check your tax code is correct
 Every PAYE employee has a tax code that shows the allowances and deductions 
that are used to calculate your tax bill. HMRC uses certain assumptions – you 
receive private medical insurance or you have a company car – to calculate its 
monthly deductions.

The problem is that these things can change, and it is easy to end up paying 
the wrong amount of tax. Morley says some changes – particularly the award of 
(or the giving up of) a company car – will have a big impact on your 
deductions. He advises anyone whose affairs have substantially changed, or 
those with an incorrect code, to contact HMRC immediately.
