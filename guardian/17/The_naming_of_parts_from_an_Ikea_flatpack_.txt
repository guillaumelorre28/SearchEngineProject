I assured several worried parents that the collection of pupil nationality 
data was simply for Department for Education research purposes. It wasn’t. The 
mandatory data request was not fully explained to schools. It now appears to 
have been a murky compromise with a Home Office plan to tackle illegal 
immigration (May wanted to ‘deprioritise’ school places for children of people 
illegally in UK

overlapping layers, and then top with mulch or manure to enrich and protect 
soil over the winter. I like doing this with all those unnecessary photos of

It’s also the only section in which I will find nothing to distract me from the 
task. Strictly for the birds?

• Professor Pedanticus needs to have a quiet word with Uncle Rebus (Chris 
Maslanka’s puzzles, 3 December). That’s not a bolt upright, it’s more of a set 
screw vertical.
