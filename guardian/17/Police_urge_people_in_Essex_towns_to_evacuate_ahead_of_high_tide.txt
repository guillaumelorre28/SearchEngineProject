Essex police have insisted they are not “crying wolf” in urging residents in 
the coastal communities of Jaywick, Mistley and West Mersea to evacuate their 
homes immediately before expected severe flooding on Friday night.

By early afternoon evacuees were beginning to arrive at emergency “rest 
centres” in Clacton and West Mersea.

Ch Insp Russ Cole confirmed a full evacuation was now under way. Speaking to 
the Guardian at a rest centre where more than 75 people had registered by early 
afternoon, Cole said the force was not “crying wolf”.

A severe flood warning is in place for Jaywick, Mistley and West Mersea at 
high tide, expected at 12:15am. A full evacuation plan was triggered at about 
11am on Friday.

Police had expected the biggest flood risk of the day to come at high tide at 
lunch time, but high tide this evening is now seen to be a higher risk with 
coastal flooding a “real and present risk”, Cole said.

The evacuation of seaside village Jaywick started on Thursday night but was 
put on hold by mid-morning while police waited for assessments from the 
Environment Agency. That evacuation was “reinvigorated” by 11am and by early 
afternoon about 200 officers were knocking on doors urging people to leave 
Jaywick.

A rest centre with inflatable beds, sleeping bags and hot food has been set up 
at Tendring Education Centre, Jaywick Lane, Clacton, for Jaywick and Mistley 
residents.

Mersea residents were being directed to the Mica Centre in West Mersea “until 
their homes were safe to return to”.

“We haven’t taken this decision lightly,” said Cole. “We are not crying wolf 
we have taken a carefully considered assessment. We can’t force people to leave 
their homes but there is a real and present risk.”

Some residents facing evacuation have expressed concerns about looting, but 
Cole said there would be increased police patrols around empty properties.

“If anyone thinks they can come with a van and commit crime in any of these 
areas they are wrong. We are doing stop checks and criminals are more likely to 
be arrested today when there are 200 extra officers on the ground.”

To those who chose not to evacuate the town, he said: “If you are contacted by 
police please do listen, they are saying this for a reason. Stay with friends 
or family or come to the rest centre with your pets – there really is no reason 
to stay behind.”

IT manager Darren Clegg was facing his second night at the Tendring rest 
centre, after being evacuated from the nearby St Osyth’s beach caravan park on 
Thursday night.

He said he was told he did not have to be evacuated but was left with the 
impression that people who did not leave would be penalised.

Because he had had a glass of wine he could not drive, so walked three miles 
to pick up his car on Friday. When he arrived the caravan park was shut and he 
could not retrieve it, so he hitchhiked back to the centre.

“I’m OK with spending another night here,” he said, adding that tonight he was 
going to try to avoid the snoring man who had kept him awake the night before.

“We’ve been very well looked after, there is food and tea and coffee, we have 
mattresses and sleeping bags so I can’t complain.”

Barry Dawson, 66, and Brenda Horwood, 74, went to the rest centre in the hope 
of getting more information.

The couple were worried about their bungalow in Jaywick, which they have just 
finished renovating after 16 months.

Police had not yet called on them or posted an information leaflet, they said.

“My nan and grandad were floating around on an upturned table on Canvey Island 
in 1953 so we’re not going to take any risks,” said Dawson. He called the 
information they had been given “abysmal”.

“We’re alright, we’ve got the van and I’m a bit of a Boy Scout but the old 
people on our street, they can’t get out on their own. I’ve asked people here 
for information but they can’t tell me if my house is in the red zone or even 
when high tide is.”

Nigel Brown, communications manager for Tendring district council, said the 
council and police were doing everything possible to keep people informed.

The rest centre was expecting greater numbers of evacuees as the afternoon 
progressed and people became more nervous as darkness approached.

“It is one thing if a flood happens during the day, but at night it could be 
much worse. That is why we are asking and helping people to come now, 
especially the elderly, frail and people on their own.”

Transport, which had been paused this morning, is now available to bring 
people to the rest centres, he said.
