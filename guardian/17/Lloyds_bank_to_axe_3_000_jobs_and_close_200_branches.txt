Lloyds Banking Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group> is axing 3,000 jobs 
and closing 200 branches as customers desert the high street for digital 
channels in a move that allows it to save costs at a time when interest rates 
are expected to be cut after the Brexit vote.

The job cuts come on top of 54,000 announced since the rescue of HBOS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/hbos> in 2008 and sparked an angry 
reaction from unions, which warned about the impact on customers.

The latest cutbacks to the remaining 75,000-strong workforce were revealed as 
the 9% taxpayer-owned bank reported a doubling in pre-tax profits and admitted 
it was being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over the way it 
handled customers having difficulty paying their mortgages.

The UK’s biggest mortgage lender and savings institution was unable to say 
whether it faced a penalty from the City regulator, but it has set aside £350m 
to cover the costs of mishandling customers in arrears not only with their home 
loans but also with unsecured debts.

António Horta-Osório, Lloyds’s chief executive, said the decision to cut jobs 
– which will save £400m – had been tough. But he said the use of branches had 
fallen by 15% year on year, faster than had been the case when he announceda 
£1bn cost-saving programme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/28/lloyds-banking-group-axe-9000-jobs-200-branches>
 of 200 branch closures and 9,000 job cuts in October 2014.


He refuted a warning by an official at Unite that customer service would be 
damaged. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, described the cuts as “grim 
news”, while Ged Nichols, general secretary of the Accord union, which 
represents 22,000 staff who joined Lloyds from Halifax, said staff would be 
confused.

“The loyal, dedicated and customer-focused employees in the Lloyds Banking 
Group are still reeling from recent job losses,” said Nichols. “They will be 
bewildered by today’s news and wonder what has happened that is so catastrophic 
that these further job cuts and branch closures are necessary.Interest rates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/interest-rates> might be lower for 
longer, but why are job losses higher and faster? Where will the axe fall next?”

Horta-Osório – born in Portugal, who has taken British nationality – said he 
expected the vote for Brexit to cause a “deceleration of growth” in a period of 
uncertainty. Interest rates would likely be cut to 0.25% from their historic 
low of 0.5%, he said, but should not go below zero because of the negative 
signal this would send about the economy. He would not say how long he expected 
rates to remain at that level.


“Additional monetary measures will have only a marginal impact,” said 
Horta-Osório, who urged the government to consider an infrastructure programme 
to bolster productivity.

“This country has underinvested for years ... The productively problem is 
already an issue. We can borrow almost at zero.”

Insisting that the vote for Brexit would not cause the bank to alter its 
lending criteria or strategy, Horta-Osório said: “We should focus on helping 
the country to grow and get out of this uncertainty as quickly as possible in 
the best possible way.”. He refused to confirm the bank would pass on the full 
effect of any rate cut to borrowers or require savers to take a knock to their 
income.

While first half pre-tax profits doubled to £2.5bn, Horta-Osório focused on 
the underlying profits – which exclude restructuring costs and other items – 
that were down 5% at £4.1bn.

While he said the acceleration of the branch closure programme was motivated 
by customers increasingly banking online or digitally, analysts were 
calculating the impact of an interest rate cut on its profits and ability to 
generate surplus capital to pay out in dividends.

 A quarter-point cut at next week’s monetary policy committee meeting would 
knock £100m off annual profits while the bank’s finance director, George 
Culmer, admitted that the plunge in the pound to 31-year lows had reduced the 
amount of capital the bank holds as it increases the value of its riskiest 
assets.

But the Brexit vote had also led to £10bn of deposits being placed with the 
bank.

As a result of buying HBOS – which includes the former Halifax building 
society – Lloyds has 2.7 million retail investors and is paying a 0.85p pence 
per share dividend, up 13%.

The prospect of special dividends had helped propel the share price last year 
– when George Osbornehad promised to sell the remaining taxpayer stake to the 
public at a discount 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/lloyds-bank-shares-to-be-offered-cut-price-to-the-public>
. It is not clear how his successor, Philip Hammond, would tackle any selloff 
given the fall in the share price since the Brexit vote, which at one point 
plunged below 50p. The taxpayer took what was a 43% stake in the bank at an 
average price of 73p and after the results were down 5% at 52p.

“Lloyds has increased its interim dividend significantly, but if the Brexit 
axe is to fall anywhere it’s likely to be on the special dividend at the end of 
the year,” said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stock broker Hargreaves 
Lansdown.
