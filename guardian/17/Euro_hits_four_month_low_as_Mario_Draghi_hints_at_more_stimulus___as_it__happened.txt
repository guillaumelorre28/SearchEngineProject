European markets edge higher

With nothing much in the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> latest 
deliberations to rock the boat, stock markets managed to end the day in 
positive territory, even as the euro was put under pressure. The banking sector 
was boosted by this week’s positive results from US financial businesses, with 
BNY Mellon being the latest to report better than expected figures. So the 
final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 0.07% or just 4.98 points at 7026.90 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.52% to 10,701.39 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.44% to 4540.12 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB was up 0.57% at 17,141.38 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 1.24% higher at 9061.2 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.49% to 595.90 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly steady, 
up 7 points or 0.04%.

Elsewhere the pound is down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2255, and up 0.14% 
at €1.1212. Against the dollar the euro has fallen 0.39% to a four month low of 
$1.0930.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Helena Smith

Meanwhile over in Greec, Mario Draghi’s statements today are not going down 
well. Helena Smith reports from Athens: 

The ECB president’s assertion this afternoon that it is premature to 
contemplate Greece being included in the bank’s quantitative easing program 
before its debt is made sustainable has landed with the force of a lead balloon 
in Athens. “It effectively kills any prospect of debt forgiveness any time 
soon,” said one well-placed source in the governing Syriza party. “How, in 
God’s name, is the economy ever to recover after seven years of recession and 
internal deflation?”

Both investors and government officials say inclusion in the program would be 
a mood changer for a country enduring its worst slump in modern times.

Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who has spent the day pushing for debt relief 
in meetings with top EU officials in Brussels, says inclusion in the program is 
essential if the debt-stricken nation is to return to capital markets and 
finally get some form of primary debt relief. Greece has been excluded from QE 
because of its low credit rating.

Tsipras has called for a debt deal to be concluded by December when Athens 
hopes to have completed its second review of the economy with international 
inspectors representing the EU and IMF. The audit begins in earnest tomorrow 
when Tsipras will also be pressing the point in talks with German chancellor 
Angela Merkel.

The euro is still at four month lows against the dollar, but the pound is not 
looking too rosy either.

Sterling is suffering as EU leaders arrive for their latest summit in 
Brussels, with EC president Donald Tusk saying there would be no pre-Article 50 
negotiations about the UK leaving Europe. Meanwhile Frenchpresident Francois 
Hollande said if Britain wanted a hard Brexit, negotiations would be hard. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/20/philip-green-knighthood-commons-set-to-debate-stripping-philip-green-of-his-knighthood-politics-live?page=with:block-5808cfdce4b005f21833b78c#block-5808cfdce4b005f21833b78c>

So the pound is down 0.36% at $1.2237 and virtually unchanged against the euro 
at €1.1201.

10.44am EDT 10:44  <> 

Most analysts seem agreed that Mario Draghi’s comments suggest the ECB will 
unveil plans to extend its quantitative easing measures at its December meeting.

Marco Valli, chief eurozone economist at UniCredit Research, said:

Draghi’s remarks do support our view that in December QE will be extended 
beyond March 2017 at the current pace...

So any policy decision will be announced on 8 December, when the new 
macroeconomic projections will be published (they will include for the first 
time numbers for 2019). What will the ECB do at that meeting? We remain 
convinced that the general council will opt for an extension of QE by six to 
nine months at the current pace. This would require €480-720bn of additional 
purchasable assets. We estimate that, under current market conditions, raising 
the ISIN limit from 33% to 50% and applying the deposit-rate restriction to a 
portfolio of bonds rather than to individual bonds would free a sufficient 
amount of German paper to make this extension possible. Bank bond purchases do 
not seem to be on the agenda, while a deposit rate cut remains highly unlikely 
as its side effects would outweigh the benefits.

ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said:

It would go too far to call this the Americanisation of the Eurozone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone>. But the outcome of today’s ECB 
meeting showed some imitations of last night’s presidential debate in the US; 
at least in terms of memorable statements. Whether it is on tapering, the 
extension of QE or solutions to the scarcity problem, the ECB is keeping 
everyone in suspense. At least until the December meeting.

[So] what are the take-aways from today’s meeting? In our view, the ECB is not 
yet ready to extend QE. The recovery of the Eurozone economy is not weak enough 
to justify more stimulus but also not strong enough to light-heartedly talk 
about tapering. This is why the ECB is simply buying time. Mario Draghi’s 
elegant balancing between tapering and an extension of QE keeps all 
expectations alive and could have one welcome fall-out: slightly higher 
long-term rates which will bring some relief to the scarcity problem without 
panic. At the December meeting, our view is that the ECB will announce an 
extension of QE until the end of 2017, possibly at a slower pace than the 
current €80bn.

Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said:

There was only a small chance that Mr Draghi would discuss an extension of QE 
today, following the recent reports that ECB had begun to consider a taper of 
the programme.

In the event, he chose not to. A more appropriate time to do this will be at 
the next ECB meeting in December, when bank staff have had a chance to revise 
their economic forecasts.

Growth in the Eurozone remains sluggish but steady, with no sign of any major 
impact from the Brexit vote. Very low core inflation and wage growth should 
most concern policy makers, and are the main reasons we expect a QE extension 
in March.

But Kathleen Brooks at City Index said although an extension was likely in 
December, it was not entirely guaranteed:

Although we believe that deflation risks in the Eurozone are receding, we 
still don’t think that the Eurozone economy is out of the deflationary woods 
yet, so QE is unlikely to end anytime soon. We do expect the ECB to announce 
that it will lengthen its asset purchase programme when it ends in March 2017, 
market expectations are for an announcement at its next policy meeting in 
December. However, we think that there is a small but significant chance that 
the ECB may hold off from expanding its QE programme, or it may only extend it 
in the short-term, as the ECB’s whopping €3.5 trillion balance sheet creates a 
liquid monetary environment even if QE stops.

Summary: Draghi hints at more action

Even though the ECB didn’t take new measures today, Mario Draghi’s press 
conference was packed with interesting elements. So what did we learn?

Mario Draghi dropped a clear hint that the ECB could boost its asset purchase 
scheme in December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/20/markets-ecb-meeting-mario-draghi-uk-retail-sales-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5808b9cde4b0cd26ff71f214#block-5808b9cde4b0cd26ff71f214>
.

He said:

We will continue to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available 
within our mandate...

In December the Governing Council’s assessment will benefitf rom the new staff 
macroeconomic projections extending through 2019 and from the work of the 
Eurosystem committees on the options to ensure the smooth implementation of our 
purchase programme until March 2017 or beyond if necessary.”

Draghi also appeared to back up recent reports that the ECB could ‘taper’ its 
QE programme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/20/markets-ecb-meeting-mario-draghi-uk-retail-sales-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5808bdbae4b005f21833b731#block-5808bdbae4b005f21833b731>
, which is currently buying €80bn of new bonds each month.

He said:

“An abrupt ending to bond purchases? I would say it’s unlikely.”

But Draghi also insisted that the Governing Council did not discuss extending 
QE, or tapering, at today’s meeting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/20/markets-ecb-meeting-mario-draghi-uk-retail-sales-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5808bbf9e4b0cd26ff71f21e#block-5808bbf9e4b0cd26ff71f21e>
.

This sent the euro on a wild ride, jumping initially before then hitting a 
four-month low.

Draghi sounded cautious about the eurozone economy, saying that it was showing 
“resilience to the adverse effects of global economic and political 
uncertainty”.

And he repeated his regular call for eurozone governments to make their 
economies more competitive, and to get more people into work.

The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up 
to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro 
area. Structural reforms are necessary in all euro area countries.

 The focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business 
environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, 
which are vital to increase investment and boost job creation.

Draghi denied that he felt threatened by recent criticism of central banks, 
notably by UK prime minister Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/20/markets-ecb-meeting-mario-draghi-uk-retail-sales-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5808c0e7e4b0cd26ff71f23e#block-5808c0e7e4b0cd26ff71f23e>
.

No, I don’t feel threatened. Neither is the independence of monetary policy by 
the governing council threatened.

He insisted that QE didn’t cause long-term inequality, on the grounds that it 
helped to get people into work.

The point is, and there is actually an interesting study by the Bundesbank on 
whether, more generally, non-conventional monetary policy measures increase 
inequality. The answer is by and large no.

The reason is that the main source of inequality is unemployment. So to the 
extent that the monetary policy is effective, it will reduce inequality.

Although, as you buy assets from people who are wealthy, in the short run, you 
certainly increase inequality.

And he also warned that Portugal would no longer be eligible for the ECB’s QE 
programme, if its credit rating is downgraded tomorrow.

Euro falls to four-month low

Mario Draghi still has the power to move the markets!

The single currency has fallen to its lowest level since the EU referendum in 
June, after the ECB president hinted that the ECB could agree new stimulus 
measures at its December meeting.

It hit a low of $1.0942, a four month low.

Q: Since June the ECB has bought 660 corporate bonds, including from companies 
such as Nestle and Glencore who have nothing to do with the eurozone. And by 
driving down the cost of borrowing for large companies, you help them take over 
smaller ones. How can you justify it?

I don’t have to justify it. It’s not true, Draghi insists. 


He argues that smaller companies also benefit from the ECB’s bond-buying, as 
it encourages banks to lend more to SMEs. That pushes down their borrowing 
costs.

Draghi: SMEs also benefit from corporate bond purchase programme. Spreads

However, he doesn’t say why the ECB has bought bonds issued by nine Swiss 
companies.

Draghi: No idea if we profited from Taper Tantrum

Q: Did the ECB profit from the story, run on Bloomberg last week, that the ECB 
was considering tapering its QE programme (which drove down bond prices).


Draghi looks a little pained at the very thought!

I never though we could profit from sudden moves, coming from unauthorized and 
probably uninformed sources, he insists.

I have no idea if the ECB profited out of it. But I can only reiterate that 
profit is not how we run monetary policy, he adds.


And on the general issue of whether to taper or not, Draghi says:

My perception is that the ‘sudden stop’ isn’t present in anyone’s mind

 * That’s another hint that the ECB may indeed taper the programme down, 
gradually, from the €80bn of bonds it’s buying each month today.

Q: Would you stop buying Portuguese bonds if Portugal is downgraded by the 
DBRS credit rating agency tomorrow?

Draghi confirms that a downgrade would mean that Portugal wouldn’t be 
automatically eligible for QE.

But he also praises Portugal’s progress, hinting that the country wouldn’t be 
hoofed out into the cold.

Draghi: I'm not threatened by Theresa May

Q: What do you think about Theresa May’s criticism on quantitative easing and 
low interest rates, and her attack on the Bank of England? Do you think the 
independence of central banks is being threatened?


No, I don’t feel threatened. Nor is the independence of the governing council 
threatened, saysMario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi>
 firmly.

Draghi says the ECB has looked at the issue of income inequality. 


By and large, he insists, loose monetary policy does not increase inequality, 
because inequality is primarily caused by unemployment.

But he concedes that QE does drive up asset prices (and thus help wealthier 
people, as Theresa May said this month).

With nothing much in the European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> latest 
deliberations to rock the boat, stock markets managed to end the day in 
positive territory, even as the euro was put under pressure. The banking sector 
was boosted by this week’s positive results from US financial businesses, with 
BNY Mellon being the latest to report better than expected figures. So the 
final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 0.07% or just 4.98 points at 7026.90 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.52% to 10,701.39 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.44% to 4540.12 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB was up 0.57% at 17,141.38 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 1.24% higher at 9061.2 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.49% to 595.90 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly steady, 
up 7 points or 0.04%.

Elsewhere the pound is down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2255, and up 0.14% 
at €1.1212. Against the dollar the euro has fallen 0.39% to a four month low of 
$1.0930.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Meanwhile over in Greec, Mario Draghi’s statements today are not going down 
well. Helena Smith reports from Athens: 

The ECB president’s assertion this afternoon that it is premature to 
contemplate Greece being included in the bank’s quantitative easing program 
before its debt is made sustainable has landed with the force of a lead balloon 
in Athens. “It effectively kills any prospect of debt forgiveness any time 
soon,” said one well-placed source in the governing Syriza party. “How, in 
God’s name, is the economy ever to recover after seven years of recession and 
internal deflation?”

Both investors and government officials say inclusion in the program would be 
a mood changer for a country enduring its worst slump in modern times.

Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi atthe 
European Summit in Brussels. Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA 
Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who has spent the day pushing for debt relief 
in meetings with top EU officials in Brussels, says inclusion in the program is 
essential if the debt-stricken nation is to return to capital markets and 
finally get some form of primary debt relief. Greece has been excluded from QE 
because of its low credit rating.

Tsipras has called for a debt deal to be concluded by December when Athens 
hopes to have completed its second review of the economy with international 
inspectors representing the EU and IMF. The audit begins in earnest tomorrow 
when Tsipras will also be pressing the point in talks with German chancellor 
Angela Merkel.

The euro is still at four month lows against the dollar, but the pound is not 
looking too rosy either.

Sterling is suffering as EU leaders arrive for their latest summit in 
Brussels, with EC president Donald Tusk saying there would be no pre-Article 50 
negotiations about the UK leaving Europe. Meanwhile Frenchpresident Francois 
Hollande said if Britain wanted a hard Brexit, negotiations would be hard.

So the pound is down 0.36% at $1.2237 and virtually unchanged against the euro 
at €1.1201.
 
Most analysts seem agreed that Mario Draghi’s comments suggest the ECB will 
unveil plans to extend its quantitative easing measures at its December meeting.

Marco Valli, chief eurozone economist at UniCredit Research, said:

Draghi’s remarks do support our view that in December QE will be extended 
beyond March 2017 at the current pace...

So any policy decision will be announced on 8 December, when the new 
macroeconomic projections will be published (they will include for the first 
time numbers for 2019). What will the ECB do at that meeting? We remain 
convinced that the general council will opt for an extension of QE by six to 
nine months at the current pace. This would require €480-720bn of additional 
purchasable assets. We estimate that, under current market conditions, raising 
the ISIN limit from 33% to 50% and applying the deposit-rate restriction to a 
portfolio of bonds rather than to individual bonds would free a sufficient 
amount of German paper to make this extension possible. Bank bond purchases do 
not seem to be on the agenda, while a deposit rate cut remains highly unlikely 
as its side effects would outweigh the benefits.

ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said:

It would go too far to call this the Americanisation of the Eurozone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone>. But the outcome of today’s ECB 
meeting showed some imitations of last night’s presidential debate in the US; 
at least in terms of memorable statements. Whether it is on tapering, the 
extension of QE or solutions to the scarcity problem, the ECB is keeping 
everyone in suspense. At least until the December meeting.

[So] what are the take-aways from today’s meeting? In our view, the ECB is not 
yet ready to extend QE. The recovery of the Eurozone economy is not weak enough 
to justify more stimulus but also not strong enough to light-heartedly talk 
about tapering. This is why the ECB is simply buying time. Mario Draghi’s 
elegant balancing between tapering and an extension of QE keeps all 
expectations alive and could have one welcome fall-out: slightly higher 
long-term rates which will bring some relief to the scarcity problem without 
panic. At the December meeting, our view is that the ECB will announce an 
extension of QE until the end of 2017, possibly at a slower pace than the 
current €80bn.

Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said:

There was only a small chance that Mr Draghi would discuss an extension of QE 
today, following the recent reports that ECB had begun to consider a taper of 
the programme.

In the event, he chose not to. A more appropriate time to do this will be at 
the next ECB meeting in December, when bank staff have had a chance to revise 
their economic forecasts.

Growth in the Eurozone remains sluggish but steady, with no sign of any major 
impact from the Brexit vote. Very low core inflation and wage growth should 
most concern policy makers, and are the main reasons we expect a QE extension 
in March.

But Kathleen Brooks at City Index said although an extension was likely in 
December, it was not entirely guaranteed:

Although we believe that deflation risks in the Eurozone are receding, we 
still don’t think that the Eurozone economy is out of the deflationary woods 
yet, so QE is unlikely to end anytime soon. We do expect the ECB to announce 
that it will lengthen its asset purchase programme when it ends in March 2017, 
market expectations are for an announcement at its next policy meeting in 
December. However, we think that there is a small but significant chance that 
the ECB may hold off from expanding its QE programme, or it may only extend it 
in the short-term, as the ECB’s whopping €3.5 trillion balance sheet creates a 
liquid monetary environment even if QE stops.
 
Even though the ECB didn’t take new measures today, Mario Draghi’s press 
conference was packed with interesting elements. So what did we learn?

Mario Draghi dropped a clear hint that the ECB could boost its asset purchase 
scheme in December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/20/markets-ecb-meeting-mario-draghi-uk-retail-sales-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5808b9cde4b0cd26ff71f214#block-5808b9cde4b0cd26ff71f214>
.

He said:

We will continue to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available 
within our mandate...

In December the Governing Council’s assessment will benefitf rom the new staff 
macroeconomic projections extending through 2019 and from the work of the 
Eurosystem committees on the options to ensure the smooth implementation of our 
purchase programme until March 2017 or beyond if necessary.”

Draghi also appeared to back up recent reports that the ECB could ‘taper’ its 
QE programme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/20/markets-ecb-meeting-mario-draghi-uk-retail-sales-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5808bdbae4b005f21833b731#block-5808bdbae4b005f21833b731>
, which is currently buying €80bn of new bonds each month.

He said:

“An abrupt ending to bond purchases? I would say it’s unlikely.”

But Draghi also insisted that the Governing Council did not discuss extending 
QE, or tapering, at today’s meeting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/20/markets-ecb-meeting-mario-draghi-uk-retail-sales-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5808bbf9e4b0cd26ff71f21e#block-5808bbf9e4b0cd26ff71f21e>
.

This sent the euro on a wild ride, jumping initially before then hitting a 
four-month low.

Draghi sounded cautious about the eurozone economy, saying that it was showing 
“resilience to the adverse effects of global economic and political 
uncertainty”.

And he repeated his regular call for eurozone governments to make their 
economies more competitive, and to get more people into work.

The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up 
to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro 
area. Structural reforms are necessary in all euro area countries.

 The focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business 
environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, 
which are vital to increase investment and boost job creation.

Draghi denied that he felt threatened by recent criticism of central banks, 
notably by UK prime minister Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/20/markets-ecb-meeting-mario-draghi-uk-retail-sales-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5808c0e7e4b0cd26ff71f23e#block-5808c0e7e4b0cd26ff71f23e>
.

No, I don’t feel threatened. Neither is the independence of monetary policy by 
the governing council threatened.

He insisted that QE didn’t cause long-term inequality, on the grounds that it 
helped to get people into work.

The point is, and there is actually an interesting study by the Bundesbank on 
whether, more generally, non-conventional monetary policy measures increase 
inequality. The answer is by and large no.

The reason is that the main source of inequality is unemployment. So to the 
extent that the monetary policy is effective, it will reduce inequality.

Although, as you buy assets from people who are wealthy, in the short run, you 
certainly increase inequality.

And he also warned that Portugal would no longer be eligible for the ECB’s QE 
programme, if its credit rating is downgraded tomorrow.

Mario Draghi still has the power to move the markets!

The single currency has fallen to its lowest level since the EU referendum in 
June, after the ECB president hinted that the ECB could agree new stimulus 
measures at its December meeting.

It hit a low of $1.0942, a four month low.

Q: Since June the ECB has bought 660 corporate bonds, including from companies 
such as Nestle and Glencore who have nothing to do with the eurozone. And by 
driving down the cost of borrowing for large companies, you help them take over 
smaller ones. How can you justify it?

I don’t have to justify it. It’s not true, Draghi insists. 


He argues that smaller companies also benefit from the ECB’s bond-buying, as 
it encourages banks to lend more to SMEs. That pushes down their borrowing 
costs.

However, he doesn’t say why the ECB has bought bonds issued by nine Swiss 
companies.

<https://twitter.com/ScouseView/status/789091232693747712>  
Q: Did the ECB profit from the story, run on Bloomberg last week, that the ECB 
was considering tapering its QE programme (which drove down bond prices).


Draghi looks a little pained at the very thought!

I never though we could profit from sudden moves, coming from unauthorized and 
probably uninformed sources, he insists.

I have no idea if the ECB profited out of it. But I can only reiterate that 
profit is not how we run monetary policy, he adds.


And on the general issue of whether to taper or not, Draghi says:

My perception is that the ‘sudden stop’ isn’t present in anyone’s mind

 * That’s another hint that the ECB may indeed taper the programme down, 
gradually, from the €80bn of bonds it’s buying each month today.
 
Q: Would you stop buying Portuguese bonds if Portugal is downgraded by the 
DBRS credit rating agency tomorrow?

Draghi confirms that a downgrade would mean that Portugal wouldn’t be 
automatically eligible for QE.

But he also praises Portugal’s progress, hinting that the country wouldn’t be 
hoofed out into the cold.

Q: What do you think about Theresa May’s criticism on quantitative easing and 
low interest rates, and her attack on the Bank of England? Do you think the 
independence of central banks is being threatened?


No, I don’t feel threatened. Nor is the independence of the governing council 
threatened, saysMario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi>
 firmly.

Draghi says the ECB has looked at the issue of income inequality. 


By and large, he insists, loose monetary policy does not increase inequality, 
because inequality is primarily caused by unemployment.

But he concedes that QE does drive up asset prices (and thus help wealthier 
people, as Theresa May said this month).
