Fees £9,000 for home and EU full-time students; international student fees 
range from £11,750 (arts, law, social sciences and education) to £13,300 
(science, engineering and health studies). Figures quoted are for the academic 
year 2016-17, checkbangor.ac.uk/fees <https://www.bangor.ac.uk/ar/main/fees> 
for updates.

 Welsh and EU students are entitled to a tuition fee grant of up to £5,100 
which means that eligible Welsh and EU students will actually borrow £3,900 
(not £9,000) per year in 2016-17.

Bursaries and scholarships There’s a mix of awards on offer, including merit 
scholarships (worth up to £3,000) for students who excel in the university’s 
entrance scholarship examinations and sport scholarships worth up to £3,000 
each. Start-up bursaries of £1,000 are also offered to students who are 
care-leavers, former Foyer residents or who were homeless immediately prior to 
their studies. Some academic departments also offer their own scholarships.

2016, fees were £77 for shared facilities; £112 for en-suite facilities; £149
