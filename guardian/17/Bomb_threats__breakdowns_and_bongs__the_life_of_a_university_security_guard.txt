“Bombs have been put in place in buildings on the campus,” read the email. 
“They will explode later today. Do NOT ignore this warning!”

It’s not the weirdest message we’ve had in the security office – those would 
be the vice-chancellor’s dinner menus we get copied into. Herb-crusted fillet 
of sustainable pollock on a provencal bean stew. Medallions of spiced monkfish 
with braised shredded fennel. Other things I can’t pronounce, let alone imagine 
swallowing.

Academics Anonymous: the inside stories of universities in 2015

But on the day we got the bomb threats, just before the 2012 Olympics, the 
security manager took action. He used to be a celebrity bodyguard, he told us, 
a close-protection security specialist. He was 5ft 4in in boots.

“Get out and look for devices.”

It turned out no one knew what a device looked like. Yorkie had one land on 
him when he was in the Falklands, but he was hazy, so our only points of 
reference were what we’d seen in The Hurt Locker, or Danger Mouse. To this day, 
I still think it was our boss who sent the email.

I remember his predecessor: he was more one of us, but in a blazer. He’d sit 
at his desk and run the entire campus with nothing but a phone, a pad and 
paper, a black coffee and a fag.

“Don’t do the students,” he warned me when I started the job. “It’s the 
quickest way to get out the gate.”

It was also one of the first rules I saw being broken, first by academics (or 
Planet Corduroy, as we call them) and then by management. Who are ex-NHS 
directors, or corporate chiefs. Untouchable.

I don’t know what led me into security. I’ve always liked being around people 
but I’m not a good talker, so it was either security guard or monk, and monks 
don’t get walkie-talkies. When I was 18, I felt like flotsam: crap marks, crap 
job, no girlfriend and a vague fear of the Millennium bug. If only someone 
outside of my family had told me that’s normal (and to go easy on the weed).

Yes, let's discuss lad culture – but don't let university leaders off the hook

That’s my favourite part of the job, welfare. Every September, at the start of 
freshers’ week, you see the kids who aren’t going to join a society, and who 
won’t be doing neknominate down the union. Slouched with loneliness. 
Time-bombs, we call them: if you can reach out to them and get talking about 
Liverpool FC or Walter White, you can stop them going down a bad road. Most of 
the time we’re the only ones who spot them, because we’re here 24/7. Unless 
they crack up between the hours of 8.30am and 5pm, they just get emails from 
other departments.

I love the gossip: the stuff I’ve heard here would make Tom Sharpe shit a 
pineapple. There was the young bloke who ran on to campus yelling that he was 
going to kill the head of music; when we asked him why, he said it was because 
his girlfriend had been guaranteed a first if she blew him.

There was the 40-year-old evangelist placed in halls of residence, who used to 
wake the entire block up by screaming passages from the bible, and chased after 
kids in wheelchairs, shouting that he could heal them.

The scariest thing is when my shiftmates crack. One guy came in with a bread 
knife and tried to open his arm in front of our team leader. Another bloke, 
ex-special forces, has been mentioned in more books than half the published 
staff, but lives in daily terror of being volunteered for role-play exercises 
in our customer-care sessions.

A former RAF trainer told me that knowledge dispels fear – as the university’s 
de facto bomb squad, mental health service, litter pickers, ceremonial mace 
bearers, first aid service, goldfish feeders and bulb-changers, the amount of 
information we have to hold in our heads means that there’s no room for nerves.

We’ve got to be able to tell a bong cough from an embolism and what 
constitutes a breach of the peace (essential when trying to get the law 
students to dial it down). Add 119 alarm codes on top of that and it’s no 
wonder we come in wearing odd socks sometimes.

When I tell people I’m a university security guard, they ask me if it’s fun. 
Is it basically Porkies? When you collar an undergraduate, do you feel like 
Inspector Morse?

It’s like being a babysitter, I tell them: you stare at screens, you have a 
nose around. You check the kids are breathing and you don’t touch your 
employer’s vodka. Then you pray the LEDs on the monitor never light up red.
