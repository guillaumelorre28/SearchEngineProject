Lech and St Anton are merging to form Austria’s biggest ski area: 340km of 
marked ski runs. A new lift between Stuben/Rauz and Zürs will connect the 
entire Arlberg area. It is best explored on a new 65km, 18,000-vertical-metre 
ski circuit, the Run of Fame. The route starts in St Anton, heads to Lech and 
Zürs, then over to Warth and Schröcken, before the White Thrill run back to St 
Anton.

Solaise, one of the two main mountains in Val d’Isère, his just finishing a 
two-year, €16m redevelopment. The final phase is a new gondola, which opens in 
December, increasing capacity by 40%, carrying 3,600 passengers an hour and 
taking just seven minutes to reach the summit. A new day lodge at the top has 
great views and welcomes picknickers – so no more overpriced resort food. There 
is also a new beginners’ area, which means novices can enjoy learning at the 
top of the mountain. Finally, there is a new €35-a-day lift pass for green and 
blue runs.

OK, it’s far too expensive for most of us, but superfans might be tempted by a 
week’s skiing with Eddie the Eagle. The trip involves six days of skiing in 
three resorts – Kicking Horse, Lake Louise and Revelstoke; a tour of the 
Olympic Park in Calgary where Eddie became a ski-jump legend in 1988; and a 
snowmobile evening.
• £2,595pp, including accommodation in a boutique hotel, meals, activities and 
transfers from Calgary, but not flights,kickinghorsepowdertours.com

 Skyfly Ischgl operates all year. Photograph: Stefan Kuerzi 
Skyfly, a 2km twin zipwire from mountain to valley in Ischgl, is a new way to 
reach the après-ski pronto, after a hard day on the slopes. It starts at the 
Silvretta gondola mid-station and lands on the valley station of the 
Pardatschgrat gondola; cables are 50m above the ground and riders can reach 
speeds of up to 84kmph (52mph). Ski and snowboard gear can be hooked up to fly 
down with the owners; it beats queueing for the gondola.
