Three schoolchildren from Theresa May’s Maidenhead constituency have designed 
the festive cards for her firstChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> as prime minister.

Jade Windsor, 11, drew a picture of 10 Downing Street with a Christmas tree 
and flying union flag, and an image of the prime minister’s Christmas dinner. 
May has said sheprefers to cook roast goose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/05/pms-christmas-poirot-goose-and-church-before-presents>
 rather than the traditional turkey on Christmas Day.

Sophie Brazil, also 11, drew Father Christmas visiting Downing Street with his 
elves, with the famous black railings hung with holly, stockings and a 
Christmas pudding.

 as children sing carols with the police officer outside No 10, with Father 
Christmas’s sleigh flying overhead.

The greeting inside the card, which will be sent to politicians and 
dignitaries, reads: “Best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.” 
It is signed by the prime minister and her husband, Philip.

Downing Street said it had been May’s annual tradition as Maidenhead MP to 
choose cards designed by children in her constituency. She will switch on the 
No 10 Christmas lights at 5pm on Thursday.

The colourful cards are a marked contrast to what turned out to be David 
Cameron’s last card as prime minister in 2015, which showed him and wife, 
Samantha, smiling on the steps of No 10on the day he was re-elected 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/british-pm-david-cameron-confounds-polls-to-win-second-term>
.

Cameron regularly chose pictures of himself and his family for his Christmas 
cards: in 2010 they featured the couple cradling their newborn daughter 
Florence, and again in 2013 when she was three.

The Camerons’ cards also regularly used photographs from special events at 
Downing Street, including theroyal wedding street party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/apr/29/downing-street-party-royal-wedding>
 and a welcome party for the London 2012 Olympics.

Nicola Sturgeon <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon> is the 
only other UK political leader so far to reveal the design for this year’s 
Christmas card.

The card features an image of Scotland’s first minister peering around the 
side of a shed after leaving a present for the Sunday Post cartoon character 
Oor Wullie, who is sitting on an upturned bucket wearing his black dungarees.

This year is the 80th anniversary of the cartoon’s first appearance in the 
Scottish newspaper, and the original illustration will be auctioned for charity 
next year.
