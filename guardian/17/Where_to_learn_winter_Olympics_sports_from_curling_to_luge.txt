Snowboard

What is it? It may be one of the more recent Olympic disciplines – making its 
debut in 1998 – but snowboarding is undoubtedly one of the most popular. Among 
the 10 snowboarding events in the Games is the gravity-defying halfpipe 
competition, in which athletes fly out of the rim of a halfpipe shaped slope, 
performing tricks while in the air in order to score points, while the 
aggressive snowboard cross sees groups of athletes race against one another 
down a course made up of obstacles, banks and jumps.Team GB's Billy Morgan 
<http://www.teamgb.com/athletes/billy-morgan> is a hopeful in the slopestyle 
event, which involves doing jumps and tricks on obstacles including 
quarterpipes and rails.

Where to learn: Morzine, France
Morzine loves snowboarding and while you won't get any summer training camps 
held on glaciers (it's way too low for that) you do get a resort which heartily 
embraces the sport. Mint is a snowboard-only school run by Roxy-sponsored rider 
Tammy Esten whose camps and lessons will take you from a nervous beginner 
snowboarder to a full-on ripper on the huge jumps in the Arare park or the 
Burton Stash. You'll forget they ever invented twin-tip skis …
• Two-hour private lessons from £116, +33 6 8077 6609, mintsnowboarding.com

Where to practise: Northstar, California, USA
Shaun White's home mountain should be on the bucket list of every snowboarder. 
The resort has seven, yes seven, different terrain parks with features rated 
from small to large so you know what you're in for before you take off. It also 
hosts a 7m superpipe designed by White himself, which presumably means most of 
us will stand at the lip and weep instead of riding it.

Alpine Skiing

Tignes in November 2013. Photograph: Jean-Pierre Clatot/AFP/Getty 
What is it? Perhaps one of the most popular and accessible winter sports, 
alpine skiing <http://www.sochi2014.com/en/alpine-skiing> describes a variety 
of events in which athletes race down steep courses on, you guessed it, a pair 
of skis. In the downhill event these fearless individuals can hit speeds of 
75mph as they compete for the fastest time, while in the slalom events athletes 
have to swerve their way through gates marked out with flags.

Where to learn: Tignes, France
Tignes may lack the charm of its sister resort Val d'Isère but that means you 
get slightly lower prices and an altitude that almost always provides snow. As 
part of the Espace Killy ski area, you get 186 miles of slopes and a plethora 
of runs in the greens and blues. Experienced skiers have the pick of the race 
camps that utilise the glacier in winter and summer for ski-race training. 
Tignes-based ski school New Generation runs regular clinics catering for 
everyone from beginners to advanced skiers.
• Prices start from £115 for the two-day (three hours each day) course, 0844

Where to practise: Kitzbühel, Austria
Any resort that hosts a World Cup downhill event would be a great place to 
practise your high-speed carving but one of the most legendary has to be 
Kitzbühel. The Streif, named after the Streifalm meadow on the upper part of 
the course is infamous for its blind corners, uphill sections and high-speed 
jumps compounding the difficulty of a technically extreme course. Regular 
punters can pit themselves against it whenever they want, while a "family 
Streif" course signpost directs you away from the more extreme sections.

Cross-Country
 Photograph: Alamy 
What is it? Banish all thoughts of cross-country as the genteel cousin of 
downhill skiing. In the mass-start races, 60-80 competitors jostle for position 
using various tactics before sprinting to the finish line, while the skiathlon 
sees skiers race the first half of the course on classic technique skis, before 
a Formula One-style pitstop to change into skating skis for the second half of 
the event. There are also individual races, sprints, and a relay.

Where to learn: Söll, Austria
Söll is situated in the Wilder Kaiser region of Tirol which, being part of a 
nature conservation area, gives access to one of the most beautiful areas for 
cross-country in the whole of Austria. The softly undulating terrain – and 
plentiful sunshine – is perfect for beginners and the 44 miles of trails link 
Söll to three other villages making frequent stop offs for fortification easy.

Where to practise: Jotunheim, Norway
Once you've got to grips with cross-country and you're looking to pit yourself 
against a stunning environment, landscapes don't come much more dramatic than 
the Jotunheim region of Norway. The classic route through the area is from 
north to south, taking in plateaus and superb views of Norway's highest peak 
Galdhøpiggen, and while days may be long, the skiing level is not as technical 
as you'd think.

Bobsleigh

What is it? Despite originating in the icy hills of Switzerland, thanks to the 
success of the classic filmCool Runnings <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106611/>
, bobsleigh is now most strongly associated with Jamaica. The sport involves 
rocketing down an icy track in a bullet-shaped sled – a bit like a 
rollercoaster – in an attempt to make the fastest time in this notoriously 
dangerous event. Teams consist of two, or four, athletes, who make a sprint 
start before hopping into the bobsleigh to begin their descent.

Where to learn? Whistler, Canada
There are only 15 tracks in the world sanctioned for competition by the 
Federation Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing and one of the newest 
is in Whistler. The Whistler Sliding Centre runs daily public bobsleigh 
sessions where complete beginners will be taken through an initiation, 
orientation, track etiquette and mock run before meeting their pilot and crew 
and hurtling down the 1,700m track at speeds of up to 80mph.
•One session, £94pp, +1 604 964 0040, whistlerslidingcentre.com

Where to practise: St Moritz, Switzerland
A difficult sport to practise unless you belong to a club or team but it's 
definitely worth riding the world's only naturally refrigerated bobsleigh run 
in St Moritz. The 1,722m track is open until 2 March and while you can't just 
turn up with a tray and ride, you can book guest rides that include a voucher 
for a glass of prosecco and a certificate noting your "Bobbaptism".

Skeleton
 Photograph: Derek Leung/Getty Images 
What is it? Bobsleigh's crazy cousin, skeleton involves going face first down 
an ice track on a sled. And, apparently, the Brits aren't too bad at it: Team 
GB's medal hopefulLizzy Yarnold <http://lizzyyarnold.com/> has been notching up 
the fastest times during practice. There's no steering devices on the sled – 
athletes have to control themselves using spikes on the tips of their shoes, 
which they can drag into the ice as they speed down. Hitting speeds of up to 
85mph on their way down, the daring athletes can experience up to 5g of g-force 
… that's more than your average rollercoaster.

Where to learn? Salt Lake City, Utah
If the thought of skeleton bob already unnerves you, the addition of the 
phrase "g-force" to an intro session probably isn't going to help. Housed in 
the Olympic Park created for the 2002 Games, the 1,335m track has five starts 
to accommodate beginners, so you're not thrown totally in at the deep – and icy 
– end. The "G-Force fantasy camp" includes up to three runs, a track walk with 
Olympic coaches who will also train you in basic driving skills.

Where to practise: Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy
The problem with falling in love with a sport such as skeleton bob is that you 
need a track and those aren't easy to come by. British Skeleton has its base in 
Bath where there is a 140m track for you to practise your push-offs from. But 
if you're looking for the real thing Cortina d'Ampezzo, which hosted the first 
televisedWinter Olympics, in Italy, in 1956 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1956_Winter_Olympics>, has a vibrant bob club and 
track set against beautiful Dolomites scenery.

Ski Jumping
 Photograph: Alamy 
What is it? Just like bobsleigh, ski jumping is another sport best-known for 
its underdogs, in the UK's case it wasEddie "The Eagle" Edwards 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_%22The_Eagle%22_Edwards>. Edwards was our 
first-ever Olympic jumper, meaning he was best in Britain but, sadly, worst in 
the world. The sport, most recently popularised byChannel 4's 
push-a-celeb-down-a-slope show The Jump 
<http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-jump>, consists of speeding down a huge 
hill and seeing who can fly the furthest off the end of it. The longest 
distance reached can be between 100m-140m, depending on the size of the hill. 
The event has been in the Winter Olympics since 1924, but this year women will 
compete in the event for the first time.

Where to learn? Oslo, Norway
OK, well not exactly to learn as it's not really a sport many people do on a 
ski holiday and in most cases you need to belong to a club to get started. The
Holmenkollen jump <http://www.holmenkollen.com/> is one of the more 
architecturally significant jumps having been completed in 2010 and created 
using 100 tonnes of steel. It houses a ski museum in the base of the tower and 
has a ski simulator so you can get a pretty good idea of what you'd be in for.

Where to practise: Steamboat Springs, Colorado USA
The Howelson ski area opened in 1915 making it Colorado's oldest continually 
operated ski area. It has also trained a fair few Olympians and is home to the 
largest and most complete natural ski jumping complex in North America. Jumps 
range from 20m to 75m while kids can get a taste for flying on the miniature 
"Bump Jump".

Ice Hockey

Johnston/Toronto Star/ Getty Images 
What is it? This aggressive sport – known as much for its shoulder barging as 
it is for its highly skilled, rapid plays – sees two teams of six battle to 
score goals by hitting the puck (a small rubber disc) into their opponent's 
net. Ice hockey is thought to have originated in Nova Scotia, after being taken 
to North America by the English, and the first formal rules for the game were 
established in 1879.

Where to learn: Sheffield, UK
Sheffield plays host to two ice hockey teams: the Steelers and the Steel Dogs, 
as well as an ice hockey academy, so it's fair to say it has a vibrant hockey 
scene. Once you've completed the intensive learn-to-skate session on one of the 
two Olympic-sized rinks at Ice Sheffield you can progress to its six-week 
learn-to-play course, which builds on your skills and takes you through the ins 
and outs of the game.

Where to practise: Toronto, Canada
On New Year's Day, 105,591 fans packed Michigan Stadium to see the Toronto 
Maple Leafs win the NHL Winter Classic. It's safe to say they love their hockey 
over there. If you've got your own equipment and you want to get a taste of 
playing in a nation that adores the sport, then Hockey Toronto will sort you 
out to play in one of its "pick-up" games or skills sessions. It will also help 
you get hold of tickets to NHL games.

Nordic Combined
 Seefeld, Austria. Photograph: Alamy 
What is it? For this event, first conceived by Norwegian soldiers, athletes 
compete at ski jumping and cross-country skiing to win one medal. The jump 
takes place first and the points scored determines the order that the athletes 
get to start the cross-country section. The point difference between each 
athlete determines the gap between when each can start, so a 15-point lead in 
the ski jump gives the skiier a one-minute head start. The first skier to cross 
the finish line wins the event overall.

Where to learn: Saalfelden, Austria
Let's face it, when it comes to Nordic Combined, most of us are going to be 
stressing over the jump part rather than the cross-country ski part. Besides 
Saalfelden has the latter sorted with 95 miles of perfectly groomed trails as 
well as a dedicated ski school (+43 6583 8353). On top of this the resort also 
runs two-day ski jump courses, which include theory lessons, video feedback, 
beginner steps on dry slopes and then progression to one of four height slopes. 
Easy!

Curling

Olympics. Photograph: PA 
What is it? Britain has history with curling, literally – it originated in 
Scotland in the 16th century – which may explain why we're so good at it. The 
sport is one of the few in which the British teams – both the men's and women's 
are headed up by Scottish curlers – have a real chance of bringing home a 
medal. The game is played with two teams of four players each, the idea being 
to get the stone as close to the target or "house" as possible. Fun fact: 
players wear special shoes with different soles – one for sliding and one for 
gripping.

Where to learn: Edinburgh, Scotland
Scotland has 22 ice-skating rinks that are equipped for curling and A LOT of 
curling clubs. Edinburgh Curling Club is running 50-minute taster sessions 
throughout February and March at Murrayfield ice rink for an affordable £3pp. 
If the bug takes you after that it has a weekly drop-in session from 
12.30pm-2.45pm for all levels for £5pp.

Figure Skating

What is it? The oldest discipline in the Winter Games: it was included in the 
1908 London Olympics 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating_at_the_1908_Summer_Olympics> – is 
also the most controversial: it's fair to say the golden couple of skating 
Torvill and Dean weren't always best of friends, anddocumentaries are still 
being made <http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=thepriceofgold> about the 
Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan saga. But of course Team GB 2014 – none of 
whom were even born when Torvill and Dean won gold at the 1984 Olympics in 
Sarajevo – will be purely focused on the present and the very real chance of 
winning a medal.

Where to learn: Nottingham, England
The National Ice Centre in Nottingham is a great place to go to learn any of 
the ice rink sports but seeing as British ice-dance legends Torvill and Dean 
met in Nottingham it seems appropriate to note it now. The centre's Learn to 
Skate programme is a six-week course that will take you from absolute beginner 
to a confident skater, able to diversify into your chosen discipline.

Luge
 Photograph: Darryl Dyck/AP 
What is it? The Luge – sounds so much better than sled (the English 
translation of this French word).According to the official Sochi site 
<http://www.sochi2014.com/en/luge-about> sleds were used as far back as Viking 
times but they probably weren't hurtling down a track feet first. However, the 
sport is older than you might think: the inaugural international luge 
competition took place as long ago as1883 in Davos 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Luge_Federation>, four years after 
the first course was built in the resort. Today luge is one of the most 
dangerous winter sports, with athletes speeding down the course at up to 85mph. 
At the 2014 games, for the first time, there's a relay, as well as singles and 
doubles events.

Where to learn: La Plagne, France
La Plagne is one of those chirpy little French resorts that often gets 
overlooked because it's not one of the big hitters in the Trois Vallées, say. 
But it does have a world-class skeleton, luge and bobsleigh track and you don't 
even have to commit to a full-on open luge experience. While the speed luge 
will still have you reaching speeds of up to 55mph, you're protected in a 
vehicle halfway between a luge and a bobsled. Perfect for beginners and 
scaredy-cats.

Schönau am Königsee is beautiful. The town rests on the banks of crystal-clear 
Lake Königsee, itself set in theBerchtesgaden national park

you won't see any of this as you hurtle down 1,300m of technically demanding 
world cup track at inconceivable speeds. The track was the first artificially 
refrigerated one to be built ever, but whether you'll care by the time you hit 
top speed is questionable.

Freestyle Skiing

moguls qualification round at the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games. Photograph: Mike 
Blake/Reuters 
What is it? Taking skiing to the next level, the freestyle events see athletes 
performing breathtaking stunts, spins and leaps as they compete in this extreme 
discipline. Among the events are the aerials competition, where skiers perform 
jumps and are then marked on technique, and ski halfpipe: in which skiers fly 
out of the slope while executing tricks in much the same way as the 
snowboarders do. It's a modern sport – first gaining popularity in the late 
1960s – but one that is likely to remain popular with spectators.

Where to learn: Manchester, UK
Taking "freestyle skiing" to mean moguls as opposed to all of the disciplines 
encompassed in the heading, there are few things that show up rubbish technique 
– and destroy your knees - faster. Luckily Manchester's Chill Factore indoor 
real snow slope creates a mogul field once a month and runs open and intro 
sessions alongside performance and competitive mogul coaching.

Fancy making an intermediate skier break out into a sweat using just two 
words? Tortin, Wall. Formidably steep, breathtakingly long and with moguls the

Biathlon
 Le Grand Bornand 
What is it? In spite of the rational assumption that skiing while in 
possession of a firearm is a risky endeavour, the athletes that take part in 
the biathlon prove it can be done with style and finesse. Originating in the 
ancient hunting practices of northern Europe, the event combines cross-country 
skiing with rifle shooting. Thebiathlon events at Sochi 
<http://www.sochi2014.com/en/biathlon> includes the individual competitions, in 
which competitors ski laps of a loop that's 1.8-2.5 miles in length, while 
stopping to shoot targets. Missing the targets means a one-minute penalty is 
added to the competitor's time.

Where to learn: Le Grand Bornand, France
Sitting on the western slopes of the Aravis range, Le Grand Bornand is a 
pretty ski town that has access to some great off piste in the shadow of Mont 
Blanc. But it is also a great place to learn biathlon with discovery days 
running every Wednesday throughout the season for €13 per hour. Following that 
you can book group, family, improver's or private lessons through the Ecole du 
Ski Francais, eventually working up to a full stage Biathlon (20km 
cross-country ski, skied in five laps with four opportunities to shoot).

Something of a biathlon hotspot, practising the sport in Ruhpolding gives you 
the opportunity of testing your skills on a world-cup stage. The Chiemgau Arena 
is a regular fixture on the world cup circuit and while it's not open to 
amateurs, tours – that include the chance to shoot on the range – can be 
arranged via the Fritz Fischer biathlon camp; an organisation that also offers 
twice-weekly "biathlon for everyone" training sessions and the opportunity to 
practise your gunmanship using laser rifles.

Speed Skating
 Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty 
What is it? Speed skaters are like sprinters on ice. Racing in a range of 
distances: from 500m-10,000m. The sport encompasses individual and team events 
with athletes speeding around an oval rink. The team pursuit sees two teams of 
three racing against each other, starting at different sides of the track. As 
with like cyclists in velodromes, the skaters take it in turns to lead the pack 
and take on the brunt of the air resistance.

Short Track

What is it? This form of speed skating involves fast, aggressive races in 
which athletes skate round an oval-shaped ice track as quickly as possible. In 
the individual event, races are up to 1,500m in length, while in the relay, 
races are up to 5,000m. Just like at your local ice rink, everyone has to go in 
the same direction – and crashes are frequent.

Where to learn speed skating and short track: Cardiff, UK
You may not have thighs the size of your torso yet but you probably will when 
you've finished one of Planet Ice's learn-to-speed-skate courses. Spread over 
six or 20 weeks with a 45-minute session each time, the course will have you 
upping your speed and tucking your turns, as well as learning about the ins and
