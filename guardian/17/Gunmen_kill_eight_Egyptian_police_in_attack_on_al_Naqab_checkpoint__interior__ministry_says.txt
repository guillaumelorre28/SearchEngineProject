Jihadists have killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen since the military 
overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, which was followed by a 
bloody crackdown on his supporters.

Most of the attacks have taken place in the north of the Sinai Peninsula, 
which borders Israel and the Palestinian Gaza Strip. Attacks have occurred in 
other parts of the country, including Cairo.

The Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> jihadist group said 
on 10 January it was behind a car bomb assault on a police checkpoint in the 
Sinai that killed eight people a day earlier.

Isis also claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed 28 
Christian Copts at a church service in Cairo on 11 December
