Owen Jones paints a picture of Britain’s railway that is far from accurate (On 
the floor and in first class our railways are a disgrace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/floor-first-class-railways-jeremy-corbyn-privatisation-train>
, 25 August). Twenty years ago, Britain’s railway ran at a £2bn a year loss in 
terms of day-to-day costs. As the safest and fastest-growing railway in Europe, 
it now virtually covers those costs, with £3.5bn a year from taxpayers spent on 
building a better railway.

To claim Britain has the highest fares in Europe is misleading, as The Man in 
Seat 61 explains <http://www.seat61.com/uk-europe-train-fares-comparison.html>: 
“This is only 15% of the story. The other 85% is that we have similar or even 
cheaper fares, too … the highest fares [are] designed to get maximum revenue 
from business travel, and some of the lowest fares [are] designed to get more 
revenue by filling more seats.”

The chairman of East Coast while it was under public operation, Michael 
Holden, recently stated that it“only really worked because it was smallish, 
one-off and considered temporary” 
<https://twitter.com/holdmch/status/768487274258501632>. EC paid £1bn back to 
the Treasury over five years, but Virgin Trains East Coast will pay back £3.3bn 
over eight.

We know overcrowding is a problem, as Graham Ruddick and Dan Milmo point out (
Are trains in Britain as overcrowded as Jeremy Corbyn claims? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/24/virgin-trains-fares-overcrowding-jeremy-corbyn-railways-q-and-a>
, 24 August). Therailway upgrade plan of over £50bn 
<http://www.railstaff.uk/2016/08/10/britain-runs-on-rail/> will improve 
journeys, create space for more trains and modernise how we run services. 
We know it’s causing disruption. But rail passengers have already rated the 
UK’s railway the best major network in the European Union.

• We can confirm Jeremy Beecham’s comments re the poor state of toilets on 
Virgin East Coast trains (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/26/no-sign-of-nudity-or-swastika-t-shirts>
, 27 September). When we boarded the 10.45 Virgin train to King’s Cross at 
Leeds on 16 August, the stench from the toilet hit us as we climbed up the 
steps. The smell persisted as we walked (some way) down to our reserved seats 
in the quiet coach, and as soon as the train started we moved as far away as 
possible. Our reserved seats would presumably have then remained empty for the 
rest of the journey.

An “out of order” sign on the door of the toilet had handwritten additions: 
“toilet blocked” and “seat broken”, dated July and August. Was it really 
possible that the toilet had been out of order and unrepaired all that time, or 
does Virgin keep a sign permanently on board for reuse in the event of broken 
toilets?

When we complained to the conductor, she sounded distinctly uninterested, with 
barely an attempt at an apology. We reported this to Virgin when it asked 
immediately after the journey for feedback – we have received no response.

• Right target, wrong issue, sums up the Jeremy Corbyn video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/24/passengers-on-jeremy-corbyns-train-journey-ive-never-once-not-got-a-seat>
. Virgin East Coast is always overcrowded at weekends and peak times on 
weekdays, but less so at other times, compared with commuter trains in the 
south-east; and company policy is not to reserve seats in coach H.

However, since Virgin took over from the renationalised East Coast, standards 
have plummeted. Toilets are regularly out of action, as the passenger you 
quoted found, all the more annoying as there are fewer toilets on 225s than the 
old 125s. There is no longer a reduction for booking fares online, and the 
number of cheaper seats has reduced markedly, so advance fares have increased 
significantly. More seriously, at a national level, the company accrues large 
profits whereas the renationalised East Coast returned £1m to the national 
exchequer, for the benefit of all.

• I have experienced some grimly overcrowded journeys out of Edinburgh on 
Scotrail. After the last occasion, I duly completed and submitted Scotrail’s 
complaint form, pointing out two issues in particular: (1) it would be 
bordering on illegal, if not actually illegal, to transport livestock in these 
condition; and (2) in the event of an accident, the likely difficulties in 
evacuating a carriage – or in recovering casualties – resulting from 
overcrowding would compromise safety and be in breach of Scotrail’s duty of 
care to its passengers. The reply I received ignored the former, but with 
regard to the latter, their response was that they did not consider 
overcrowding to compromise passenger safety.

So that’s that then. On the upside, I did receive a Scotrail £5 travel voucher 
for their failure to respond to my complaint within seven days.

• My wife and I travel on Virgin Trains 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/virginrail> from Liverpool Lime Street to 
Euston on a regular basisregularly to visit our three grandchildren in 
Teddington. The service is always good, taking just over two hours. Then we 
cross London via tube and train to Twickenham. After our visit we return in the 
late afternoon. The South West Trains service can be a nightmare, with 
eight-coach trains packed solid. Nobody sits on the floor; there is barely room 
to move an arm! We feel rather sorry for the silent masses on these trains; 
being northerners, we chat to passengers, often to their shock and horror, 
advising them to move to Liverpool for an easier and friendly life.

• Virgin Trains says it can get a passenger to Liverpool “in just two hours 14 
minutes, giving you the time to put your feet up” (Party seals Virgin deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/26/virgin-trains-teams-up-with-labour-to-offer-discounts-and-a-seat>
, 27 August). Since the only way to put your feet up on a train is to plant 
them on the seat opposite, this is encouraging two bad habits – blocking the 
seat opposite and leaving dirt for the next passenger. How about some joined-up 
thinking here?

• I wonder how Martin Kettle knows that “Corbyn speaks of renationalising the 
railways, not because it would work well but because he thinks state ownership 
is right” (On left and right, politics is now led by nostalgic gestures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/left-right-politics-dominated-nostalgic-gestures>
, 26 August). I would not presume to pontificate on the reasons why anyone 
supports particular policies or ideas, rather than debating the policies or 
ideas themselves. In fact the case for renationalising Britain’s railways is 
that it is both right in principle and would work better than at present. The 
need is for an integrated system, with rational timetables and fare structures 
nationwide, which can only be achieved with a single operator rather than the 
present mish-mash. And to ensure that such a monopoly does not exploit its 
position it has to be publicly owned, with accountability at all levels.

• During four gloriously sunny days in the Lake District last week my wife and 
I wasted at least three hours trying and failing to book seats on Virgin Trains 
for our return journey. On boarding the crowded train, we were able to find 
seats but could not sit together.

On Japanese railways there are multiple ways to book seats, including when 
arriving at the station a few minutes before departure, while on the French TGV 
it is not possible to board without a booked seat. Can Mr Branson not afford a 
decent computer, or does the money made from packing in standing passengers 
outweigh customer service?

• The mystery for me is why so many people reserve a train seat, presumably 
when they purchase their ticket, and don’t travel. Why doesn’t the conductor 
remove the reservations card on unoccupied seats, say, 10 minutes after 
departure, thus freeing them up for other passengers?
