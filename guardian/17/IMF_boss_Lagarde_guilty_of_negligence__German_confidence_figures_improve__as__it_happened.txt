Greece denies early elections

Helena Smith

Over in Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> the government is 
once again denying any suggestion that elections are on the horizon despite 
mounting speculation that a national ballot may soon be inevitable. Helena 
Smith reports:

Greece’s latest standoff with creditors has sparked widespread conjecture that 
early elections are not far off. Lenders’ demands for additional austerity 
beyond 2018, when the country’s current bailout programme ends, has put Athens’ 
leftist-led government increasingly on the defensive. Prime minister Alexis 
Tsipras’ surprise announcement of fiscal support for vulnerable groups appears 
only to have toughened the hard line approach with the European Stability 
Mechanism, the euro zone’s financing arm abruptly freezing short-term debt 
relief measures last week.

Senior cadres in the ruling Syriza party say they are now being told that 
unless €4.5 bn worth of extra measures in the form of pension and tax reforms 
are legislated, a crucial second review of the economy will be delayed. That 
could once again raise the spectre of Greece’s ejection from the eurozone. 
Earlier today the credit ratings agency, Moody’s, said it would increase the 
risk of Greece defaulting on bond payments in July.

“We are being blackmailed,” said one. “We have accepted reforms that 
ideologically have been very difficult to swallow. Asking us to vote through 
more is democratically unacceptable.”

With the two-party government’s wafer thin majority of 153 in the 300-seat 
house it was far from sure that further belt-tightening could be endorsed. 
Approval ratings of Syriza and Tsipras have plummeted precipitously on the back 
of fury over unpopular reforms.

“Early elections are not part of our plans,” the government spokesman Dimitris 
Tzanakopoulos said. “In 2018 Greece will exit the memoranda and [international] 
supervision,” he said referring to the latest bailout programme. “Even if the 
review is delayed we will not have elections. The country does not need 
elections.”

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Here’s our report on the Christine Lagarde guilty verdict. Kim Willsher 
reports:

Christine Lagarde <https://www.theguardian.com/world/christine-lagarde>, the 
head of the International Monetary Fund, has been found guilty of negligence in 
approving a massive payout of taxpayers’ money to controversial French 
businessman Bernard Tapie, but avoided a jail sentence.

A French court convicted the former government minister, who had faced a 
€15,000 fine and up to a year in jail, but decided she should not be punished 
and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record.

The verdict came as a surprise as even the public prosecutor had admitted the 
evidence against Lagarde was “weak” during a five day trial last week. 
Jean-Claude Marin told the court Lagarde’s actions fell into the category of 
politics and not criminality and called for her to be acquitted.

Lagarde, who has always argued she did nothing wrong and acted “in the public 
interest”, was not present for the judgment. Her lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve 
said she had flown back to Washington DC, where the IMF is based.

Lagarde had appeared before the Cour de Justice de la République, a special 
tribunal set up to judge ministers and public officials for alleged crimes 
committed while in office. It is made up of three judges and 12 politicians 
from the French houses of parliament.

It was only the fifth time the court had sat and its judgements cannot be 
appealed against.

Here’s AP on the Lagarde news:

A special French court has declared International Monetary Fund chief 
Christine Lagarde guilty of criminal negligence in a long-running arbitration 
case.

But the court decided not to punish her or give her a criminal record.

The Court of Justice of the Republic ruled that her negligence while servicing 
as finance minister allowed for the misappropriation of funds by other people. 
The others, in a separate case, haven’t yet been tried.

Uh oh. There could be a spanner in the works of the Monte dei Paschi 
fundraising. Reuters reports:

Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena is trying to resolve differences with a 
key investor over its 5 billion euro ($5.2 billion) rescue plan to allow the 
deal to go ahead and avoid a state bailout.

Italy’s third-largest bank has until the end of December to raise capital and 
offload 28 billion euros in gross bad loans as requested by European Central 
Bank supervisors.

Monte dei Paschi has failed to find buyers for its shares so far. On Monday, 
it shook the market again with a warning that Italian bank industry bailout 
fund Atlante was rethinking its 1.5 billion euro purchase of bad loans from the 
lender.

Atlante had expressed “deep reservations” in a Dec. 17 letter over the terms 
of a bridge loan that Monte dei Paschi had secured as part of the sale of bad 
loans, the bank said.

Monte dei Paschi shares extended losses on the news, erasing a week’s gains to 
trade down 7.7 percent at 19.3 euros each.

“If issues raised by (Atlante’s manager) Quaestio cannot be solved, the 
operation could not be concluded by Dec. 31, 2016 as requested by the European 
Central Bank,” the bank said in a statement.

However, Carlo Messina, chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Atlante’s 
top contributors, said he believed the investment fund should go ahead with the 
deal and that it would reach a decision by Tuesday at the latest.

Italy is ready to bail out Monte dei Paschi, the world’s oldest bank,to 
prevent it being wound down and destabilising the euro zone’s fourth-largest 
banking sector.

Time for an update on the markets, and it’s an uncertain pattern.

Most European markets are still marginally lower, although off their worst 
levels, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is up 0.3% despite the fall in Monte dei Paschi 
as the bank starts its €5bn refinancing.

The FTSE 100 has also edged higher - just - up 0.09%. But France’s Cac is 
0.26% lower, Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.03% and Spain’s Ibex is down 0.66%

Meanwhile with the strength of the dollar continuing in the wake of last 
week’s rate rise from the US Federal Reserve, the pound fell around 1% to its 
lowest level for a month, although it has recovered a little ground and is now 
down 0.75% at £1.2394.

Against the euro, sterling is down 0.5% at €1.1882.

Tomorrow could see more developments in the row between Greek and its lenders 
over the government’s plan to pay pensioners a Christmas bonus, something which 
was not approved by the lenders.Greece’s Kathimerini reports: 
<http://www.ekathimerini.com/214694/article/ekathimerini/business/ewg-to-discuss-impact-of-christmas-bonus-on-greek-program>

The Euro Working Group (EWG) is to meet Tuesday to discuss the impact on the 
Greek program of the SYRIZA-led government’s decision to grant a one-off 
supplement to pensioners.

The European Stability Mechanism reacted to the measure by suspending for the 
time being the implementation of the short-term debt relief measures that were 
only rubber stamped by eurozone finance ministers on December 5.

EWG is expected to discuss a report by representatives of the institutions on 
the actual cost of the handout. The report was requested by German Finance 
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble.

The International Monetary Fund is positive about the actions taken by Ukraine 
over its biggest lender, PrivatBank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/19/markets-await-german-confidence-figures-business-live?page=with:block-58579a62e4b0010b9dd8327f#block-58579a62e4b0010b9dd8327f>
. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde,who also has other things on her mind 
at the moment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/12/christine-lagarde-imf-chief-in-court-over-400m-payout-to-french-tycoon>
, said:

Today’s decision of Ukrainian authorities to nationalize PrivatBank is an 
important step in their efforts to safeguard financial stability. This decision 
was taken to ensure the smooth operations of the bank given its systemic role 
in Ukraine’s financial system, and in view of insufficient efforts to 
strengthen its capital adequacy in recent months...

It is now important that the process of nationalisation be followed by firm 
efforts to maximise the repayment of related-party loans, and the appointment 
of an independent management team to restore the bank’s viability, minimising 
the cost to the state and taxpayers in line with existing legislation and 
international best practice.

The IMF will continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to build strong 
institutions, enhance transparency, and advance structural reforms which are 
critical to achieve strong and sustainable economic growth.

Jennifer Rankin

The details of the European Union’s decision against Apple in a dispute over 
the tax it pays to Ireland have been released. Jennifer Rankin reports from 
Brussels:

Apple could reduce its €13bn (£10.8bn) tax bill to Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> if it increased payments to its US 
parent company or paid back taxes to other EU countries, the European 
commission has said, as it revealed the full text of its landmark ruling 
against the US tech giant for the first time.

Margrethe Vestager 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/28/margrethe-vestager-eu-competition-commissioner-google-tax-deal-uk-government>
, the EU competition commissioner, suggested Ireland may not see the full €13bn 
in back taxes, if Apple chose to pay larger amounts to its US headquarters to 
fund research and development.

Speaking to the Irish Independent 
<http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/apple-could-cut-13bn-tax-bill-by-paying-more-to-us-parent-vestager-35304707.html>
, she also said the total paid to Ireland could be reduced because other EU 
member states may demand more tax from Apple if they concluded that the US tech 
firm had underpaid them, because it had been routing profits to Apple’s Irish 
headquarters in Cork.

The full text of the EU’s decision, published on Monday, sets the stage for a 
titanic legal battle, which pits the European commission againstApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> and Dublin, with implications 
for hundreds of companies.

In August, the commission said a sweetheart deal devised by the Irish 
government had allowed Apple to pay tax of just 0.005% in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid>
 and an average rate of 1% over many years.

Apple can reduce €13bn Irish tax bill if it shares payments, EU says

UK investigation into ticket re-sellers

The UK Competition and Markets Authority will investigate the secondary 
ticketing market 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-launches-enforcement-investigation-into-online-secondary-ticketing>
. It said:

The CMA has today launched an enforcement investigation into suspected 
breaches of consumer protection law in the online secondary tickets market.

This follows concerns that people are not getting the full range of 
information required by law when buying tickets put up for resale.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will specifically look at if 
information is provided on who the seller is and any connections the seller may 
have with the platform or event organisers; whether there are any restrictions 
on the use of resold tickets which could result in the person being denied 
access to the event; and where a seat is located in the venue.

Andrea Coscelli, CMA Acting Chief Executive, said: “A night out at a concert 
or a trip to a big match is something that millions of people look forward to. 
So it’s important they know who they are buying from and whether there are any 
restrictions that could stop them using the ticket.

“We have heard concerns about a lack of transparency over who is buying up 
tickets from the primary market. We also think that it is essential that those 
consumers who buy tickets from the secondary market are made aware if there is 
a risk that they will be turned away at the door.”

Annual growth in hourly eurozone wages rose 1.6% in the third quarter, 
compared to an increase of just 0.9% in the previous three months and 1.7% in 
the first quarter.

Hourly labour costs - which include wages and non-wage costs - rose by 1.5% in 
the eurozone and by 1.9% in the wider 28 member European Union in the third 
quarter of 2016, compared with the same quarter of the previous year. Report 
compilerEurostat  <http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat>said:

The two main components of labour costs are wages & salaries and non-wage 
costs. In the euro area, wages & salaries per hour worked grew by 1.6% and the 
non-wage component by 1.2% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the same 
quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, the annual changes were +0.9% 
and +1.5% respectively. In the EU28, hourly wages & salaries rose by 2.0% and 
the non-wage component by 1.5% in the third quarter of 2016. In the second 
quarter of 2016, annual changes were +1.4% and +1.7% respectively.

Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit, said the data 
could be encouraging for the European Central Bank:

A rise in Eurozone wage costs and total labour costs in the third quarter of 
2016 may fuel hope within the ECB that underlying Eurozone inflationary 
pressures may just be starting to pick up. The ECB has been frustrated and 
disappointed by the lack of a pick-up in underlyingEurozone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> in recent months, even though 
the headline consumer price inflation rate has picked up...

However, while the ECB may well take some comfort from the third-quarter 
Eurozone labour costs and wage data, the Governing Council will still be wary 
about the current weakness of underlying price pressures – the ECB will likely 
note that while annual growth in Eurozone total labour costs and wages both 
picked up in the third quarter, this followed a sharp relapse in the second 
quarter and both were still just below the levels seen in the first quarter.

Over in Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> the government is 
once again denying any suggestion that elections are on the horizon despite 
mounting speculation that a national ballot may soon be inevitable. Helena 
Smith reports:

Greece’s latest standoff with creditors has sparked widespread conjecture that 
early elections are not far off. Lenders’ demands for additional austerity 
beyond 2018, when the country’s current bailout programme ends, has put Athens’ 
leftist-led government increasingly on the defensive. Prime minister Alexis 
Tsipras’ surprise announcement of fiscal support for vulnerable groups appears 
only to have toughened the hard line approach with the European Stability 
Mechanism, the euro zone’s financing arm abruptly freezing short-term debt 
relief measures last week.

Senior cadres in the ruling Syriza party say they are now being told that 
unless €4.5 bn worth of extra measures in the form of pension and tax reforms 
are legislated, a crucial second review of the economy will be delayed. That 
could once again raise the spectre of Greece’s ejection from the eurozone. 
Earlier today the credit ratings agency, Moody’s, said it would increase the 
risk of Greece defaulting on bond payments in July.

“We are being blackmailed,” said one. “We have accepted reforms that 
ideologically have been very difficult to swallow. Asking us to vote through 
more is democratically unacceptable.”

With the two-party government’s wafer thin majority of 153 in the 300-seat 
house it was far from sure that further belt-tightening could be endorsed. 
Approval ratings of Syriza and Tsipras have plummeted precipitously on the back 
of fury over unpopular reforms.

“Early elections are not part of our plans,” the government spokesman Dimitris 
Tzanakopoulos said. “In 2018 Greece will exit the memoranda and [international] 
supervision,” he said referring to the latest bailout programme. “Even if the 
review is delayed we will not have elections. The country does not need 
elections.”

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Here’s our report on the Christine Lagarde guilty verdict. Kim Willsher 
reports:

Christine Lagarde <https://www.theguardian.com/world/christine-lagarde>, the 
head of the International Monetary Fund, has been found guilty of negligence in 
approving a massive payout of taxpayers’ money to controversial French 
businessman Bernard Tapie, but avoided a jail sentence.

A French court convicted the former government minister, who had faced a 
€15,000 fine and up to a year in jail, but decided she should not be punished 
and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record.

The verdict came as a surprise as even the public prosecutor had admitted the 
evidence against Lagarde was “weak” during a five day trial last week. 
Jean-Claude Marin told the court Lagarde’s actions fell into the category of 
politics and not criminality and called for her to be acquitted.

Lagarde, who has always argued she did nothing wrong and acted “in the public 
interest”, was not present for the judgment. Her lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve 
said she had flown back to Washington DC, where the IMF is based.

Lagarde had appeared before the Cour de Justice de la République, a special 
tribunal set up to judge ministers and public officials for alleged crimes 
committed while in office. It is made up of three judges and 12 politicians 
from the French houses of parliament.

It was only the fifth time the court had sat and its judgements cannot be 
appealed against.

as finance minister allowed for the misappropriation of funds by other people.

Uh oh. There could be a spanner in the works of the Monte dei Paschi 
fundraising. Reuters reports:

Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena is trying to resolve differences with a 
key investor over its 5 billion euro ($5.2 billion) rescue plan to allow the 
deal to go ahead and avoid a state bailout.

Italy’s third-largest bank has until the end of December to raise capital and 
offload 28 billion euros in gross bad loans as requested by European Central 
Bank supervisors.

Monte dei Paschi has failed to find buyers for its shares so far. On Monday, 
it shook the market again with a warning that Italian bank industry bailout 
fund Atlante was rethinking its 1.5 billion euro purchase of bad loans from the 
lender.

Atlante had expressed “deep reservations” in a Dec. 17 letter over the terms 
of a bridge loan that Monte dei Paschi had secured as part of the sale of bad 
loans, the bank said.

Monte dei Paschi shares extended losses on the news, erasing a week’s gains to 
trade down 7.7 percent at 19.3 euros each.

“If issues raised by (Atlante’s manager) Quaestio cannot be solved, the 
operation could not be concluded by Dec. 31, 2016 as requested by the European 
Central Bank,” the bank said in a statement.

However, Carlo Messina, chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Atlante’s 
top contributors, said he believed the investment fund should go ahead with the 
deal and that it would reach a decision by Tuesday at the latest.

Italy is ready to bail out Monte dei Paschi, the world’s oldest bank,to 
prevent it being wound down and destabilising the euro zone’s fourth-largest 
banking sector.
 
Time for an update on the markets, and it’s an uncertain pattern.

Most European markets are still marginally lower, although off their worst 
levels, while Italy’s FTSE MIB is up 0.3% despite the fall in Monte dei Paschi 
as the bank starts its €5bn refinancing.

The FTSE 100 has also edged higher - just - up 0.09%. But France’s Cac is 
0.26% lower, Germany’s Dax has dipped 0.03% and Spain’s Ibex is down 0.66%

Meanwhile with the strength of the dollar continuing in the wake of last 
week’s rate rise from the US Federal Reserve, the pound fell around 1% to its 
lowest level for a month, although it has recovered a little ground and is now 
down 0.75% at £1.2394.

Against the euro, sterling is down 0.5% at €1.1882.
 
Tomorrow could see more developments in the row between Greek and its lenders 
over the government’s plan to pay pensioners a Christmas bonus, something which 
was not approved by the lenders.Greece’s Kathimerini reports: 
<http://www.ekathimerini.com/214694/article/ekathimerini/business/ewg-to-discuss-impact-of-christmas-bonus-on-greek-program>

The Euro Working Group (EWG) is to meet Tuesday to discuss the impact on the 
Greek program of the SYRIZA-led government’s decision to grant a one-off 
supplement to pensioners.

The European Stability Mechanism reacted to the measure by suspending for the 
time being the implementation of the short-term debt relief measures that were 
only rubber stamped by eurozone finance ministers on December 5.

EWG is expected to discuss a report by representatives of the institutions on 
the actual cost of the handout. The report was requested by German Finance 
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble.

at the moment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/12/christine-lagarde-imf-chief-in-court-over-400m-payout-to-french-tycoon>
, said:

Today’s decision of Ukrainian authorities to nationalize PrivatBank is an 
important step in their efforts to safeguard financial stability. This decision 
was taken to ensure the smooth operations of the bank given its systemic role 
in Ukraine’s financial system, and in view of insufficient efforts to 
strengthen its capital adequacy in recent months...

It is now important that the process of nationalisation be followed by firm 
efforts to maximise the repayment of related-party loans, and the appointment 
of an independent management team to restore the bank’s viability, minimising 
the cost to the state and taxpayers in line with existing legislation and 
international best practice.

The IMF will continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to build strong 
institutions, enhance transparency, and advance structural reforms which are 
critical to achieve strong and sustainable economic growth.

The details of the European Union’s decision against Apple in a dispute over 
the tax it pays to Ireland have been released. Jennifer Rankin reports from 
Brussels:

Apple could reduce its €13bn (£10.8bn) tax bill to Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> if it increased payments to its US 
parent company or paid back taxes to other EU countries, the European 
commission has said, as it revealed the full text of its landmark ruling 
against the US tech giant for the first time.

Margrethe Vestager 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/28/margrethe-vestager-eu-competition-commissioner-google-tax-deal-uk-government>
, the EU competition commissioner, suggested Ireland may not see the full €13bn 
in back taxes, if Apple chose to pay larger amounts to its US headquarters to 
fund research and development.

Speaking to the Irish Independent 
<http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/apple-could-cut-13bn-tax-bill-by-paying-more-to-us-parent-vestager-35304707.html>
, she also said the total paid to Ireland could be reduced because other EU 
member states may demand more tax from Apple if they concluded that the US tech 
firm had underpaid them, because it had been routing profits to Apple’s Irish 
headquarters in Cork.

The full text of the EU’s decision, published on Monday, sets the stage for a 
titanic legal battle, which pits the European commission againstApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> and Dublin, with implications 
for hundreds of companies.

In August, the commission said a sweetheart deal devised by the Irish 
government had allowed Apple to pay tax of just 0.005% in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid>
 and an average rate of 1% over many years.

The UK Competition and Markets Authority will investigate the secondary 
ticketing market 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-launches-enforcement-investigation-into-online-secondary-ticketing>
. It said:

The CMA has today launched an enforcement investigation into suspected 
breaches of consumer protection law in the online secondary tickets market.

This follows concerns that people are not getting the full range of 
information required by law when buying tickets put up for resale.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will specifically look at if 
information is provided on who the seller is and any connections the seller may 
have with the platform or event organisers; whether there are any restrictions 
on the use of resold tickets which could result in the person being denied 
access to the event; and where a seat is located in the venue.

Andrea Coscelli, CMA Acting Chief Executive, said: “A night out at a concert 
or a trip to a big match is something that millions of people look forward to. 
So it’s important they know who they are buying from and whether there are any 
restrictions that could stop them using the ticket.

“We have heard concerns about a lack of transparency over who is buying up 
tickets from the primary market. We also think that it is essential that those 
consumers who buy tickets from the secondary market are made aware if there is 
a risk that they will be turned away at the door.”

Annual growth in hourly eurozone wages rose 1.6% in the third quarter, 
compared to an increase of just 0.9% in the previous three months and 1.7% in 
the first quarter.

Hourly labour costs - which include wages and non-wage costs - rose by 1.5% in 
the eurozone and by 1.9% in the wider 28 member European Union in the third 
quarter of 2016, compared with the same quarter of the previous year. Report 
compilerEurostat  <http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat>said:

The two main components of labour costs are wages & salaries and non-wage 
costs. In the euro area, wages & salaries per hour worked grew by 1.6% and the 
non-wage component by 1.2% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the same 
quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, the annual changes were +0.9% 
and +1.5% respectively. In the EU28, hourly wages & salaries rose by 2.0% and 
the non-wage component by 1.5% in the third quarter of 2016. In the second 
quarter of 2016, annual changes were +1.4% and +1.7% respectively.

Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit, said the data 
could be encouraging for the European Central Bank:

A rise in Eurozone wage costs and total labour costs in the third quarter of 
2016 may fuel hope within the ECB that underlying Eurozone inflationary 
pressures may just be starting to pick up. The ECB has been frustrated and 
disappointed by the lack of a pick-up in underlyingEurozone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone> in recent months, even though 
the headline consumer price inflation rate has picked up...

However, while the ECB may well take some comfort from the third-quarter 
Eurozone labour costs and wage data, the Governing Council will still be wary 
about the current weakness of underlying price pressures – the ECB will likely 
note that while annual growth in Eurozone total labour costs and wages both 
picked up in the third quarter, this followed a sharp relapse in the second 
quarter and both were still just below the levels seen in the first quarter.
