The north-south divide was on display in a new survey showing house prices 
edging up in London and the home counties but stagnant or falling in Yorkshire 
and Wales.

The May figures recorded in a national survey for property analysts, 
Hometrack, showed an overall rise of 0.2% across the country, boosted by the 
capital hosting the Olympics which was up by 0.6%.

East Anglia and the south-east also saw small positive gains but in the 
Midlands they were unchanged, while prices actually fell 0.1% further north.

The gloomy picture of stagnant prices, few transactions and a beleaguered 
housebuilding industry was reinforced by official figures showing the 
construction sector has contracted this year and purchases are at their second 
lowest level since mid-2011.

The number of new buyers registering with estate agents across the country 
slowed over the month, recording a 0.4% increase compared with 2.1% in April.

The volume of properties coming to market also slowed as part of a seasonal 
post-Easter pattern, but the 2.2% increase it recorded over the month is higher 
than the rise in new buyers.

Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack, sees no great price uplift 
in the near future: "Increased mortgage rates and mounting concerns over the 
impact of the eurozone on the UK's economic growth and employment are likely to 
keep demand and prices in check as we move into summer."
