Here‚Äôs Ryan Lizza in the New Yorker on the appointment of former Breibart duce 
Steve Bannon as chief White House strategist and senior adviser to Donald Trump:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Leninist,‚Äù Steve Bannon told a writer for The Daily Beast, in early 
2014. ‚ÄúLenin wanted to destroy the state, and that‚Äôs my goal, too. I want to 
bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today‚Äôs establishment.‚Äù

At the time, Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, the 
far-right news site. When he became the C.E.O. of Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign, in 
August, he told the writer that he had no recollection of the conversation. On 
Sunday, Trump, in his first personnel decisions as President-elect, named 
Bannon as his chief strategist and senior counselor and Reince Priebus, the 
Republican National Committee Chairman, his chief of staff.
 Monday. Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA 
The press release from the Trump transition staff said that Bannon and Priebus 
would be ‚Äúequal partners.‚Äù This is a signal to Washington that Bannon will be 
the most powerful person in Trump‚Äôs White House. On November 6, 2008, the day 
after his election, Barack Obama made just one personnel announcement: that 
Congressman Rahm Emanuel would be his chief of staff. Every staff member in the 
Obama White House reported to Emanuel, including political advisers such as 
David Axelrod. Even in the George W. Bush White House, which at first had a 
weak chief of staff, Andy Card, and a powerful political adviser, Karl Rove, 
everyone, including Rove, formally reported to Card.

Trump has indicated that, in his White House, Bannon will be first among 
equals.

have not started filling out paperwork for such clearances, contradicting 
earlier reports by CNN and CBS News (see earlier post

What‚Äôs the next goal for Democrats? Here‚Äôs a piece of it: Elect state 
governors who are in charge of approving the redistrictingplans for 
congressional seats that will happen in 2020, with the Census.

2016 was a disaster for Democrats in every way, including at the state level. 
Republicans now claim33 governorships, which is the record going back almost 
100 years, the Washington Postpoints out 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/12/these-3-maps-show-just-how-dominant-republicans-are-in-america-after-tuesday/?ex_cid=newsletter>
. Republicans now are sliding into control of an all-time, historic high69/99 
state legislative bodies.

That leaves a lot of room for state-level activism for Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> on abortion, voting rights, 
same-sex marriage and transgender discrimination, immigration, drug laws and 
more.

So the Democratic goal is to elect some governors, stop further gerrymandering 
and along the way stand up Democratic legislatures that can pass some laws 
making citizens less vulnerable ‚Äì in the current political climate ‚Äúless 
vulnerable‚Äù seems to capture it ‚Äì to national-level chaos, and that would 
create a base for greater influence at the national level

Clinton as quoted: 'no one is sorrier than me'

Lauren Gambino

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and 
Barack Obama urged their party to reflect on what went wrong as Democrats 
search to find a new leader and rebuild after her stunning defeat to Donald 
Trump.

On a conference call with congressional lawmakers, Clinton offered a raw 
evaluation of how the loss has impacted her but encouragedDemocrats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> to fight for the party‚Äôs values 
harder than ever in the Trump era.

‚ÄúNo one is sorrier than me,‚Äù she said, according to a Democrat on the call. 
‚ÄúHeartbreaks don‚Äôt heal overnight, and this one won‚Äôt.‚Äù

Clinton said the party must ‚Äúanalyze‚Äù and warned lawmakers against becoming 
‚Äúdistracted or divided‚Äù in the many fights ahead.

Meanwhile, Obama addressed supporters on a conference call late on Monday, 
congratulating Clinton on a ‚Äúhistory-making race‚Äù while acknowledging how 
painful it is to lose.

‚ÄúExpected losses are hard enough, unexpected ones are just worse,‚Äù Obama said. 
‚ÄúI was telling my team, you‚Äôre allowed to mope for a week and a half, maybe two 
if you really need it. But after that, we‚Äôve got to brush ourselves off and get 
back to work. We‚Äôve got to come together and focus on a way ahead.‚Äù

Like Clinton, Obama encouraged the party to evaluate what went wrong and to 
rework its strategy at a grassroots level.

‚ÄúWe have better ideas,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúBut they have to be heard for us to 
actually translate those ideas into votes and ultimately into action.‚Äù

Pence to meet Trump on Tuesday to discuss cabinet picks

The Trump transition press pool has conducted an interview just then with 
Jason Miller, a Trump communications adviser, who came down to the Trump Tower 
lobby around 8:15pm and spoke briefly to reporters.

What follows is the pool‚Äôs transcription of the encounter in full:

Q: Should we expect any cabinet announcements or senior White House 
appointments this week?

A: ‚ÄúVice President-elect Mike Pence will be here tomorrow meeting with 
President-elect Trump. They‚Äôll be reviewing a number of names. There has been a 
lot of work put in by both the Vice President-elect and a number of members of 
the transition team.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be meeting tomorrow. I don‚Äôt want to put a finite time table. 
Obviously, inauguration day is not getting further away. And people need to get 
going. This is an absolute top priority understood by the President-elect and 
the Vice President-elect.‚Äù

 Q: Any decisions coming tomorrow?

A: ‚ÄúIf the Vice President-elect is getting together with the President-elect 
to discuss names, then I would say that it‚Äôs serious, obviously.‚Äù

 Q: Noting that Senator Jeff Sessions entered the building earlier tonight ‚Äì 
is he under consideration for Secretary of Defense, State, etc.?

A: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a huge fan of Sen Sessions and the President-elect will be lucky to 
have him in any capacity.‚Äù

Q: Are Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton finalists for the Secretary of State 
position?

A: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt believe everything you read. I don‚Äôt want to play the 
speculation game as far as names. There‚Äôs a thorough, detailed process that the 
Vice President-elect and the transition team are going through and the 
President-elect will make the decision and let us know.‚Äù

Q: [Right-wing talk-radio host] Laura Ingraham for White House Press Secretary?

A: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see a number of different names that are ultimately 
becoming a part of the President-elect‚Äôs administration. There will be 
non-traditional names, a number of people who have had wide-ranging success in 
a number of different fields; wide-ranging success in business ‚Ä¶ People will be 
excited when they see the type of leaders the President-elect brings into this 
administration.‚Äù

Q: Comment on Gwen Ifill‚Äôs passing? 

A: [Paraphrasing]: Soon to come. Monitor Facebook and Twitter accounts.

In which writer Alice McKeon imagines running into Mitt Romney in the deli 
line and hashing out this whole Trump business with a former Republican 
presidential nominee who seemed, to her, unacceptable at the time:

<https://medium.com/@amckeon/running-into-mitt-romney-in-the-grocery-store-93c9c1e5e9be#.33z0wqb5o>

Excuse me, Mr. Romney? Hi. Wow, I‚Äôve never seen the deli line this long. What 
number do you have? Yikes‚Ä¶ So, how are you doing? I know that this week must 
have been a bit of a blow for you. I mean, a racist, chauvinistic imbecile 
accomplished something that you, a successful businessman and scion of the 
Republican Party couldn‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt seem right, even for someone who voted 
against you with a fair bit of glee.

What I wouldn‚Äôt now give for your ‚Äúbinder full of women‚Äù to be the worst thing 
said about women on a campaign. It almost sounds quaint. I still don‚Äôt think 
that you would give us control of our own reproductive rights, and I wouldn‚Äôt 
be surprised if you casually said that women had smaller brains because of our 
head shapes. But I can virtually guarantee that you have never grabbed anyone‚Äôs 
nether regions without their consent.

Here‚Äôs Ryan Lizza in the New Yorker on the appointment of former Breibart duce 
Steve Bannon as chief White House strategist and senior adviser to Donald Trump:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Leninist,‚Äù Steve Bannon told a writer for The Daily Beast, in early 
2014. ‚ÄúLenin wanted to destroy the state, and that‚Äôs my goal, too. I want to 
bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today‚Äôs establishment.‚Äù

At the time, Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, the 
far-right news site. When he became the C.E.O. of Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign, in 
August, he told the writer that he had no recollection of the conversation. On 
Sunday, Trump, in his first personnel decisions as President-elect, named 
Bannon as his chief strategist and senior counselor and Reince Priebus, the 
Republican National Committee Chairman, his chief of staff.

The press release from the Trump transition staff said that Bannon and Priebus 
would be ‚Äúequal partners.‚Äù This is a signal to Washington that Bannon will be 
the most powerful person in Trump‚Äôs White House. On November 6, 2008, the day 
after his election, Barack Obama made just one personnel announcement: that 
Congressman Rahm Emanuel would be his chief of staff. Every staff member in the 
Obama White House reported to Emanuel, including political advisers such as 
David Axelrod. Even in the George W. Bush White House, which at first had a 
weak chief of staff, Andy Card, and a powerful political adviser, Karl Rove, 
everyone, including Rove, formally reported to Card.

Trump has indicated that, in his White House, Bannon will be first among 
equals.

A Trump transition official has told the media pool that Trump has not 
requested top-level security clearances for his children and that the children 
have not started filling out paperwork for such clearances, contradicting 
earlier reports by CNN and CBS News (see earlier post 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/14/donald-trump-transition-team-white-house-live?page=with:block-582a4ec8e4b05c05c52f5089#block-582a4ec8e4b05c05c52f5089>

What‚Äôs the next goal for Democrats? Here‚Äôs a piece of it: Elect state 
governors who are in charge of approving the redistrictingplans for 
congressional seats that will happen in 2020, with the Census.

2016 was a disaster for Democrats in every way, including at the state level. 
Republicans now claim33 governorships, which is the record going back almost 
100 years, the Washington Postpoints out 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/12/these-3-maps-show-just-how-dominant-republicans-are-in-america-after-tuesday/?ex_cid=newsletter>
. Republicans now are sliding into control of an all-time, historic high69/99 
state legislative bodies.

That leaves a lot of room for state-level activism for Republicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> on abortion, voting rights, 
same-sex marriage and transgender discrimination, immigration, drug laws and 
more.

So the Democratic goal is to elect some governors, stop further gerrymandering 
and along the way stand up Democratic legislatures that can pass some laws 
making citizens less vulnerable ‚Äì in the current political climate ‚Äúless 
vulnerable‚Äù seems to capture it ‚Äì to national-level chaos, and that would 
create a base for greater influence at the national level

Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and 
Barack Obama urged their party to reflect on what went wrong as Democrats 
search to find a new leader and rebuild after her stunning defeat to Donald 
Trump.

On a conference call with congressional lawmakers, Clinton offered a raw 
evaluation of how the loss has impacted her but encouragedDemocrats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> to fight for the party‚Äôs values 
harder than ever in the Trump era.

‚ÄúNo one is sorrier than me,‚Äù she said, according to a Democrat on the call. 
‚ÄúHeartbreaks don‚Äôt heal overnight, and this one won‚Äôt.‚Äù

Clinton said the party must ‚Äúanalyze‚Äù and warned lawmakers against becoming 
‚Äúdistracted or divided‚Äù in the many fights ahead.

Meanwhile, Obama addressed supporters on a conference call late on Monday, 
congratulating Clinton on a ‚Äúhistory-making race‚Äù while acknowledging how 
painful it is to lose.

‚ÄúExpected losses are hard enough, unexpected ones are just worse,‚Äù Obama said. 
‚ÄúI was telling my team, you‚Äôre allowed to mope for a week and a half, maybe two 
if you really need it. But after that, we‚Äôve got to brush ourselves off and get 
back to work. We‚Äôve got to come together and focus on a way ahead.‚Äù

Like Clinton, Obama encouraged the party to evaluate what went wrong and to 
rework its strategy at a grassroots level.

‚ÄúWe have better ideas,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúBut they have to be heard for us to 
actually translate those ideas into votes and ultimately into action.‚Äù

The Trump transition press pool has conducted an interview just then with 
Jason Miller, a Trump communications adviser, who came down to the Trump Tower 
lobby around 8:15pm and spoke briefly to reporters.

What follows is the pool‚Äôs transcription of the encounter in full:

Q: Should we expect any cabinet announcements or senior White House 
appointments this week?

A: ‚ÄúVice President-elect Mike Pence will be here tomorrow meeting with 
President-elect Trump. They‚Äôll be reviewing a number of names. There has been a 
lot of work put in by both the Vice President-elect and a number of members of 
the transition team.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be meeting tomorrow. I don‚Äôt want to put a finite time table. 
Obviously, inauguration day is not getting further away. And people need to get 
going. This is an absolute top priority understood by the President-elect and 
the Vice President-elect.‚Äù

 Q: Any decisions coming tomorrow?

A: ‚ÄúIf the Vice President-elect is getting together with the President-elect 
to discuss names, then I would say that it‚Äôs serious, obviously.‚Äù

 Q: Noting that Senator Jeff Sessions entered the building earlier tonight ‚Äì 
is he under consideration for Secretary of Defense, State, etc.?

A: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a huge fan of Sen Sessions and the President-elect will be lucky to 
have him in any capacity.‚Äù

Q: Are Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton finalists for the Secretary of State 
position?

A: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt believe everything you read. I don‚Äôt want to play the 
speculation game as far as names. There‚Äôs a thorough, detailed process that the 
Vice President-elect and the transition team are going through and the 
President-elect will make the decision and let us know.‚Äù

Q: [Right-wing talk-radio host] Laura Ingraham for White House Press Secretary?

A: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see a number of different names that are ultimately 
becoming a part of the President-elect‚Äôs administration. There will be 
non-traditional names, a number of people who have had wide-ranging success in 
a number of different fields; wide-ranging success in business ‚Ä¶ People will be 
excited when they see the type of leaders the President-elect brings into this 
administration.‚Äù

Q: Comment on Gwen Ifill‚Äôs passing? 

A: [Paraphrasing]: Soon to come. Monitor Facebook and Twitter accounts.

In which writer Alice McKeon imagines running into Mitt Romney in the deli 
line and hashing out this whole Trump business with a former Republican 
presidential nominee who seemed, to her, unacceptable at the time:

Here‚Äôs the top of the Medium post: 
<https://medium.com/@amckeon/running-into-mitt-romney-in-the-grocery-store-93c9c1e5e9be#.33z0wqb5o>

Excuse me, Mr. Romney? Hi. Wow, I‚Äôve never seen the deli line this long. What 
number do you have? Yikes‚Ä¶ So, how are you doing? I know that this week must 
have been a bit of a blow for you. I mean, a racist, chauvinistic imbecile 
accomplished something that you, a successful businessman and scion of the 
Republican Party couldn‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt seem right, even for someone who voted 
against you with a fair bit of glee.

What I wouldn‚Äôt now give for your ‚Äúbinder full of women‚Äù to be the worst thing 
said about women on a campaign. It almost sounds quaint. I still don‚Äôt think 
that you would give us control of our own reproductive rights, and I wouldn‚Äôt 
be surprised if you casually said that women had smaller brains because of our 
head shapes. But I can virtually guarantee that you have never grabbed anyone‚Äôs 
nether regions without their consent.
