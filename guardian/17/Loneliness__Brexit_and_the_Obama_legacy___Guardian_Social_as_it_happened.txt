Britain's strictest school

Rebecca Ratcliffe

This  profile on the Michaela school 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/dec/30/no-excuses-inside-britains-strictest-school>
 in London caught my eye at the weekend. Michaela is touted as Britain’s 
strictest school – the corridors are silent (children walk in single file 
without talking) and there’s a no-excuses policy on behaviour. Arrive to school 
one minute late and you’ll get a detention. But the school has proved 
controversial – it recently hit the headlines when it emerged that children 
whose parents had not paid their dinner money were put in “lunch isolation”.


Its approach to teaching has also divided opinion among education bloggers. 
Judging bythe comments on this piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/dec/30/no-excuses-inside-britains-strictest-school#comments>
, Guardian readers are also split.

“We have the teacher standing at the front and imparting knowledge. We believe 
the teacher knows more than the children. Most teachers in Britain do not 
believe that. They believe that the children and teachers all know pretty much 
the same stuff, which is why the children just need to be guided by the teacher 
as opposed to being taught by the teacher.”

What complete and utter rubbish. Most teachers in Britain do not believe that. 
And if she thinks that 'imparting knowledge' is the same as teaching then she 
has no business running a school.

In 1999 I inspected a few of East Anglia's top comprehensives for the 
Telegraph Good Schools Guide, and one school had a 'zero tolerance' discipline 
policy which wasn't quite as strict as Michaela's. The classes were all 
impressive: pupils were all on message and eager to learn, and teachers were 
never 'challenged'. At the finish of the day, I was left in the library with 
all of the Year 11 pupils and no member of staff was present. Their enthusiasm 
for 'zero tolerance' was amazing--they said that coming from primary schools 
where you could do almost anything, it was a shock finding that you could be 
sent to 'time out' just for dropping a pencil on the floor. But very soon you 
discovered how much more interesting lessons were when they weren't constantly 
disrupted. And just as importantly, teachers were always happy to help you 
because they weren't "stressed out" (their words!).

I visited Michaela last year, and (like all visitors) I had plenty of 
opportunities to talk to pupils when no member of staff was present. Their 
attitudes were pretty much the same as the above, even though these pupils were 
all Year 7. But what really amazed me was the standard of work the pupils were 
producing, and the obvious pride they took in their achievement.

The abuse that Katherine Birbalsingh has suffered speaks volumes--about the 
abusers. They are not nice people. I can quite understand that some people 
might not want this kind of school for their own children, but to sink to the 
level of some of her detractors is just plain sick.

What did you think?

Fake or for real – an Instagram Stories experiment

Eleni Stefanou

We’re piloting a weekly series on Instagram Stories called Fake or for real. 
Here’s how it works: our presenter,Leah Green 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/leah-green> (who you can see below) reads 
out headlines that may or may not be true. You then have a few seconds to suss 
out whether the story is legit – before we reveal the answer ...
 ‘Covered in a ... ’ ? Check out the Guardian on Instagram to find out. 
Photograph: Instagram 
Fake or for real is a response to the wake-up call we received after the US 
election – fake news stories have been quietly flooding social media feeds, and 
we wanted to do something about it. A Stanford studyrevealed late last year 
that students have a hard time spotting fake news 
<http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/23/503129818/study-finds-students-have-dismaying-inability-to-tell-fake-news-from-real>
, so we figured Fake or for real could be a fun way to encourage a more 
vigilant approach to news consumption.


Episode two launches later today, so follow us on Instagram (@guardian 
<https://www.instagram.com/guardian/>) to check it out for yourselves. 


Once you’ve seen it, send us a message to let us know what you thought.

Have never felt the urge to congregate with other runners.

I go running to get away from other humans.

I love running but I detest the 'cor, we must be mad!!!' mentality, since it's 
basically an exercise in mutual back slapping. Bollocks to it. Run or don't, 
wear tights or don't. Nobody gives a shit.

(Even by my standards, that's a very grumpy comment. Soz.)

I'm a cyclist rather than a runner but ... cross training. My riding group 
this morning was discussing what to call ourselves. We're past being MAMILs 
(middle-aged men in Lycra) and the alternatives suggested were OFILs (old farts 
in Lycra) or (here's the relevance) VOMITs (very old men in TIGHTS).

Lycra leggings – the final step in the evolution of a running fanatic

Oliver Balch

I’ve learned a lot about running tights over the last 48 hours. I now know, 
for example, that Lycra is a specific brand and not a generic material. That’s 
if anyone actually used Lycra. Apparently, nowadays it’s all about “technical” 
materials, the watchword of which is “weave”. Weave helps absorb sweat better, 
I’m told. Or it would, if “absorb” weren’t out of vogue. “Wicking” sweat is now 
where it’s at.

This wealth of tights-related knowledge came in response to my piece about 
becoming a runner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/jan/04/lycra-leggings-the-final-step-in-the-evolution-of-a-running-fanatic>
. Or at least beginning to think of myself as such. Readers raised other issues 
too. A lot had to do with kit: how much you need, how much you don’t need, how 
it was simpler in the old days, how silly/important/dazzling head-torches are.

What no one really talked about was the joy of running. For me, being a 
“runner” (whatever that means) is ultimately about the simple pleasure of 
putting one step in front of the other. It’s about relishing the open road. 
It’s about the thrill of clearing your mind.

If you’ve resolved to run more in the year ahead, then great. Focus on finding 
that joy. Seek it out. Track it down. It’s there, waiting for you. And tights: 
really, they’re not worth sweating about.

"While I agree with those who were critical of his failure to curb the 
surveillance state and drones, I still believe that in time he will be regarded 
as one of America’s better presidents."

Surveillance state and use of drones in warfare isn't limited to Obama and any 
other US president (Democrat or Republican) would have done exactly the same 
thing as you can't stop government using new technology, especially when 
terrorist threats use it too.

The UK public is one of the most spied on and nobody is blaming David Cameron 
and the conservatives for it. Same with the rest of the 5 eyes of mass 
surveillance (Australia, New Zealand, US, UK, Canada).

The Obama legacy

Ewen MacAskill

Ewen MacAskill <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ewenmacaskill>, the 
Guardian’s Washington bureau chief from 2007 to 2013, looks at President Barack 
Obama and his legacy.

As a news reporter, I am conflicted about writing these retrospective pieces 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/04/barack-obama-first-term-hope-obamacare>
. But I was keen to look back at the early years of Obama’s presidency, 
particularly the excitement of those early days on the presidential campaign 
trail in 2007 and 2008, following Obama around states such as Iowa, New 
Hampshire and South Carolina.

But instead of indulging in nostalgia, it might have been better to have 
focused on one particular issue rather than a broad sweep of his presidency. 
And the particular issue I have in mind – which I am pleased to see several 
readers picked up on – is whether Obama and the Democrats wasted his first two 
years in office.

At the time, the Democrats had control of Congress. To me, it was a lost 
opportunity. They could have rammed through all the legislation they wanted. 
But some of the Democratic members, particularly the conservative or fiscal 
Democrats, were still operating under the old system in which Democrats and 
Republicans often worked together, seeking compromises. When the Republicans 
gained a majority in 2010, the Democrats quickly realised the old rules no 
longer applied and the name of the game was to obstruct Obama at almost every 
turn.

One reader, commenting on my article, made a fair point that Obama is as much 
to blame (or even more to blame) for the lost opportunity by standing back and 
waiting for Congress to come up with the details of what was to become 
Obamacare.

The tone of the readers’ comments was heartening, engaged in a serious debate. 
I was a little surprised by how negative many of the comments were about the 
Obama presidency. While I agree with those who were critical of his failure to 
curb the surveillance state and drones, I still believe that in time he will be 
regarded as one of America’s better presidents.

More of your thoughts on loneliness

Here’s an interesting response to a comment we highlighted at 13:21 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2017/jan/06/how-can-we-tackle-loneliness-this-year-our-live-look-at-the-week?page=with:block-586f99b8e4b081b2b4edab45#block-586f99b8e4b081b2b4edab45>
 that forms part of a broader conversation around loneliness that is still 
going on in the comments.

I have no understanding of how people can be lonely. If you are lonely go and 
do something to make yourself not lonely.

Confidence plays a very large part in how older people interact. If you've 
ever been in hospital for a long time, you'll likely have found crossing the 
road and going to the supermarket to be initially quite mentally testing 
experiences.

I work with older people and there are many who for one reason or another are 
unable to just toodle along to a coffee morning. Sometimes, in sheltered 
housing, the coffee morning is in the same building, but they are still nervous 
of being among people after time spent away.

Lack of hearing must also not be underestimated. For many they find it hard to 
pick out voices in a crowded room, leading to embarrassing situations, and the 
feeling of being in a glass box.

One of my ladies had a fall while trying to get on a bus. She was quite badly 
hurt, in hospital for 8 weeks, and after that terrified of trying to get up 
that step again, so stopped using buses, and became isolated.

Some people with dementia who know their memories are going are terrified to 
enter social situations where they may not be able to remember names, tick of 
the bingo numbers quick enough, etc. That again, removes their confidence.



go and do something to make yourself not lonely

One of the most important lessons in health and social care is not to judge 
others by what you can do, by one standard. It may be easy for you to rock up 
to a club, just as some of my older people will get on planes and visit distant 
relatives whereas others break into a sweat using a cash machine. People are 
individuals with a myriad of physical and mental health combinations as well as 
experience and behaviour limitations. You may not understand how anyone can be 
lonely, but look closer at who thatanyone is made up of.

Science story of the week: bursting into the new year

Tash Reith-Banks

There’s nothing like a little Contact-style drama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/08/why-i-love-jodie-foster-contact>
 to kick off the New Year, so Wednesday’s report that thesource of fast radio 
bursts first detected a decade ago has been traced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/04/radio-wave-source-discovered-space>
 is pretty exciting. They’re likely to have emanated from a dwarf galaxy around 
3bn light years from Earth, according to the a paper published in Nature. Since 
2007 there have been 18 fast radio bursts registered, and there’s been a lot of 
debate about what causes these high-energy surges of long waves at the far end 
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

observatories, on the Plains of San Agustin 50 miles west of Socorro, New 
Mexico. Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images 
There’s still lots of speculation as to what precisely has caused the pulses, 
but the finding is “a real game-changer” according to Heino Falcke, an 
astronomer at Radboud University Nijmegen. I personally feel that it bodes well 
for stargazing and beyond in 2017!

Is this a place to comment on Rafael Behr's piece? I have to say I'm getting 
tired of comment pieces that remark on how pathetic the government is in its 
response to the referendum result and its approach to grasping what leaving the 
EU means. We cannot keep waiting on this government to show the way. The 
Guardian needs to take a stronger line in pointing out that the constitution of 
the UK has changed through our being a member of the EU and that leaving the EU 
means drawing up a new constitutional settlement. This is not a task for one 
political party to take forward, especially one that draws its support from a 
minority of voters and from England primarily.

Brexit and the suspicions leaking out from Whitehall

Rafael Behr

Diplomacy is meant to be discreet, so when senior diplomats make headlines, 
something has gone wrong. The resignation of Ivan Rogers from the UK’s mission 
to Brussels is significant not because the individual at the centre of the 
story was pivotal to the success or failure of Brexit but because it indicates 
a collective unreadiness for the task. Pro-Europeans lament the episode as part 
of a long martyrdom of The Experts. Eurosceptics are glad to see the back of 
someone whose commitment to the Great Continental Disentanglement they always 
doubted. In truth, diplomats come and go. Sir Ivan was due to go in the autumn, 
anyway. What matters in this case is the fact that second-order questions of 
second-tier personnel in the Brexit chain-of-command are elevated to 
first-order news. This is politics abhorring a strategic vacuum.

It has become fashionable to say that Theresa May’s ambitions for Brexit are 
opaque, which isn’t quite true. We know she prioritises immigration control 
over economic integration. We also know that she abhors protectionism and wants 
to preserve favourable terms of trade with the single market (but cannot keep 
full membership). We don’t know whether she has the capability to achieve that 
combination. The mystery is not in the “what” but the “how” and that is a 
question of organisation and negotiating skill. Sir Ivan’s resignation letter 
confirms suspicions leaking out from Whitehall that there is no organising 
principle ahead of the Brexit talks.

The pieces of the jigsaw have been tipped out of the box but not yet arranged 
in any useful fashion. The edges have barely been fished out to construct a 
frame. The prime minister behaves as if this is not a problem because 
everything will fall into place in good time. That is a proposition of faith – 
an invitation to believe that she knows what she is doing. But until we have 
counted the pieces, checked they are all really there, and seen her interlock 
them deftly into some coherent pattern, there is no particular reason – no 
supporting evidence – to believe her.

A final couple of thoughts about loneliness – can online communities help?

Get online. Solved.
A million ways to interact with others. Or use the internet to form new groups 
in your local community to get active in some way. Or you know post up things 
in the community or basically do anything other than nothing.

I have no understanding of how people can be lonely. If you are lonely go and 
do something to make yourself not lonely. My Grandparents who are all sadly not 
with us now were part of multiple groups in the communities they lived in, and 
then when they were less able to get around people from those communities would 
visit them, as well as us as the family ofc.

I think the only situation would be of course if someone had a physical 
disability which stopped them going out. Although saying that my aunt had polio 
as a child and was in a wheelchair all her life and she still would go out down 
to coffee mornings and general events in the village. right into her 80's.

Loneliness is something more complex today than previously. We are all more 
and less alone than previously. It's that super-position that creates problems. 
Through the web we are in touch with so many more people and, if we want to, 
are never truly alone. But equally, we are physically with people less often 
and fewer people know us as the physical person.

Truth is that it's the perspective that we take that matters. I was a teen 
when the web was still young and I lived out in the countryside. And that was 
intensely lonely for me. But the friends I had online, especially friends who 
were older than me and treated me like an adult made that period feel bearable. 
And looked at like that the web is something great for bringing people 
together; somewhere that absolutely everyone can find friends.

But we all still crave personal, face to face relationships. And especially at 
Christmas we have a tendency to look at words on a screen and feel that this is 
just a shallow facsimile. In truth what we need are real friends, whether 
online or in meatspace. That's what matters. We shouldn't devalue friends 
because we've never seen them in person. Equally we shouldn't believe that just 
the net is enough, or use it as an excuse not to bother going outside.

Everyone should make it their business to visit elderly parents or relatives 
if they don't already do so. If you don't have any then try adopting some. A 
cup of tea and a chat means the world to lonely, elderly people.

Documenting your year in photographs

Matthew Holmes

Over the last couple of years we’ve hosted a year-long photography project 
where readers contribute an image a day over their 365 days (or 366 in the case 
of 2016 – thanks to the eagle eyed readers who got in touch to mention the leap 
year after we missed it last January!)


The result is a collection of fascinating images from daily life, 
extraordinary events and even personal moments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/dec/31/365-days-your-2016-in-photographs>
 – as well as an interactive featuring some of our favourites published on 31 
December.
 “Each New Year’s Day for the past few years some friends have gathered on

How can you tackle loneliness for old people? Have places for them to go 
during the day, oh wait it turns out they've been closed down because of cuts.

My dad spoke highly of the local salvation army and their lunches after my mum 
died - even though he saw my extensive family regularly. Stuff like that helps.

We could all do a little more to tackle loneliness

Anushka Asthana

I met Jo Cox before she became a Labour politician through a mutual friend, 
and then got to know her better once she’d arrived in parliament. She was 
lovely – empathetic, friendly, vivacious and incredibly passionate. And she 
told me she wanted to direct that seemingly endless energy to two key 
priorities: helping civilians in war-torn Syria, andtackling the scourge of 
loneliness 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/28/jo-coxs-campaign-to-tackle-loneliness-lives-on-with-help-of-friends>

Half a million older people spend every day alone, poll shows

<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/06/half-a-million-older-people-spend-every-day-alone-poll-shows>
Typically for Jo, she made both cross-party efforts, teaming up on loneliness 
with Conservative Seema Kennedy, who will now take forward the work with Jo’s 
friend and colleague, Rachel Reeves. As they say in this interview I did in 
December, their focus won’t just be the elderly but new mums, children, 
refugees, the disabled and men who often don’t turn to anyone for help.

We could all heed their simple call to action – call a grandparent, visit a 
neighbour, meet the friend you keep putting off.

This  profile on the Michaela school 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/dec/30/no-excuses-inside-britains-strictest-school>
 in London caught my eye at the weekend. Michaela is touted as Britain’s 
strictest school – the corridors are silent (children walk in single file 
without talking) and there’s a no-excuses policy on behaviour. Arrive to school 
one minute late and you’ll get a detention. But the school has proved 
controversial – it recently hit the headlines when it emerged that children 
whose parents had not paid their dinner money were put in “lunch isolation”.


Its approach to teaching has also divided opinion among education bloggers. 
Judging bythe comments on this piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/dec/30/no-excuses-inside-britains-strictest-school#comments>
, Guardian readers are also split.

“We have the teacher standing at the front and imparting knowledge. We believe 
the teacher knows more than the children. Most teachers in Britain do not 
believe that. They believe that the children and teachers all know pretty much 
the same stuff, which is why the children just need to be guided by the teacher 
as opposed to being taught by the teacher.”

What complete and utter rubbish. Most teachers in Britain do not believe that. 
And if she thinks that 'imparting knowledge' is the same as teaching then she 
has no business running a school.

In 1999 I inspected a few of East Anglia's top comprehensives for the 
Telegraph Good Schools Guide, and one school had a 'zero tolerance' discipline 
policy which wasn't quite as strict as Michaela's. The classes were all 
impressive: pupils were all on message and eager to learn, and teachers were 
never 'challenged'. At the finish of the day, I was left in the library with 
all of the Year 11 pupils and no member of staff was present. Their enthusiasm 
for 'zero tolerance' was amazing--they said that coming from primary schools 
where you could do almost anything, it was a shock finding that you could be 
sent to 'time out' just for dropping a pencil on the floor. But very soon you 
discovered how much more interesting lessons were when they weren't constantly 
disrupted. And just as importantly, teachers were always happy to help you 
because they weren't "stressed out" (their words!).

I visited Michaela last year, and (like all visitors) I had plenty of 
opportunities to talk to pupils when no member of staff was present. Their 
attitudes were pretty much the same as the above, even though these pupils were 
all Year 7. But what really amazed me was the standard of work the pupils were 
producing, and the obvious pride they took in their achievement.

The abuse that Katherine Birbalsingh has suffered speaks volumes--about the 
abusers. They are not nice people. I can quite understand that some people 
might not want this kind of school for their own children, but to sink to the 
level of some of her detractors is just plain sick.

What did you think?

 
We’re piloting a weekly series on Instagram Stories called Fake or for real. 
Here’s how it works: our presenter,Leah Green 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/leah-green> (who you can see below) reads 
out headlines that may or may not be true. You then have a few seconds to suss 
out whether the story is legit – before we reveal the answer ...
 ‘Covered in a ... ’ ? Check out the Guardian on Instagram to find out. 
Photograph: Instagram 
Fake or for real is a response to the wake-up call we received after the US 
election – fake news stories have been quietly flooding social media feeds, and 
we wanted to do something about it. A Stanford studyrevealed late last year 
that students have a hard time spotting fake news 
<http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/23/503129818/study-finds-students-have-dismaying-inability-to-tell-fake-news-from-real>
, so we figured Fake or for real could be a fun way to encourage a more 
vigilant approach to news consumption.


Episode two launches later today, so follow us on Instagram (@guardian 
<https://www.instagram.com/guardian/>) to check it out for yourselves.

Have never felt the urge to congregate with other runners.

I go running to get away from other humans.

I love running but I detest the 'cor, we must be mad!!!' mentality, since it's 
basically an exercise in mutual back slapping. Bollocks to it. Run or don't, 
wear tights or don't. Nobody gives a shit.

(Even by my standards, that's a very grumpy comment. Soz.)

I'm a cyclist rather than a runner but ... cross training. My riding group 
this morning was discussing what to call ourselves. We're past being MAMILs 
(middle-aged men in Lycra) and the alternatives suggested were OFILs (old farts 
in Lycra) or (here's the relevance) VOMITs (very old men in TIGHTS).
 
I’ve learned a lot about running tights over the last 48 hours. I now know, 
for example, that Lycra is a specific brand and not a generic material. That’s 
if anyone actually used Lycra. Apparently, nowadays it’s all about “technical” 
materials, the watchword of which is “weave”. Weave helps absorb sweat better, 
I’m told. Or it would, if “absorb” weren’t out of vogue. “Wicking” sweat is now 
where it’s at.

This wealth of tights-related knowledge came in response to my piece about 
becoming a runner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/jan/04/lycra-leggings-the-final-step-in-the-evolution-of-a-running-fanatic>
. Or at least beginning to think of myself as such. Readers raised other issues 
too. A lot had to do with kit: how much you need, how much you don’t need, how

What no one really talked about was the joy of running. For me, being a 
“runner” (whatever that means) is ultimately about the simple pleasure of 
putting one step in front of the other. It’s about relishing the open road. 
It’s about the thrill of clearing your mind.

If you’ve resolved to run more in the year ahead, then great. Focus on finding 
that joy. Seek it out. Track it down. It’s there, waiting for you. And tights: 
really, they’re not worth sweating about.

"While I agree with those who were critical of his failure to curb the 
surveillance state and drones, I still believe that in time he will be regarded 
as one of America’s better presidents."

Surveillance state and use of drones in warfare isn't limited to Obama and any 
other US president (Democrat or Republican) would have done exactly the same 
thing as you can't stop government using new technology, especially when 
terrorist threats use it too.

The UK public is one of the most spied on and nobody is blaming David Cameron 
and the conservatives for it. Same with the rest of the 5 eyes of mass 
surveillance (Australia, New Zealand, US, UK, Canada).
 
And here’s a short film our colleagues in the US have produced as Michelle 
Obama says goodbye to the role of first lady.

Ewen MacAskill <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ewenmacaskill>, the 
Guardian’s Washington bureau chief from 2007 to 2013, looks at President Barack 
Obama and his legacy.

As a news reporter, I am conflicted about writing these retrospective pieces 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/04/barack-obama-first-term-hope-obamacare>
. But I was keen to look back at the early years of Obama’s presidency, 
particularly the excitement of those early days on the presidential campaign 
trail in 2007 and 2008, following Obama around states such as Iowa, New 
Hampshire and South Carolina.

But instead of indulging in nostalgia, it might have been better to have 
focused on one particular issue rather than a broad sweep of his presidency. 
And the particular issue I have in mind – which I am pleased to see several 
readers picked up on – is whether Obama and the Democrats wasted his first two 
years in office.

At the time, the Democrats had control of Congress. To me, it was a lost 
opportunity. They could have rammed through all the legislation they wanted. 
But some of the Democratic members, particularly the conservative or fiscal 
Democrats, were still operating under the old system in which Democrats and 
Republicans often worked together, seeking compromises. When the Republicans 
gained a majority in 2010, the Democrats quickly realised the old rules no 
longer applied and the name of the game was to obstruct Obama at almost every 
turn.

One reader, commenting on my article, made a fair point that Obama is as much 
to blame (or even more to blame) for the lost opportunity by standing back and 
waiting for Congress to come up with the details of what was to become 
Obamacare.

The tone of the readers’ comments was heartening, engaged in a serious debate. 
I was a little surprised by how negative many of the comments were about the 
Obama presidency. While I agree with those who were critical of his failure to 
curb the surveillance state and drones, I still believe that in time he will be 
regarded as one of America’s better presidents.
 
Here’s an interesting response to a comment we highlighted at 13:21 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2017/jan/06/how-can-we-tackle-loneliness-this-year-our-live-look-at-the-week?page=with:block-586f99b8e4b081b2b4edab45#block-586f99b8e4b081b2b4edab45>
 that forms part of a broader conversation around loneliness that is still 
going on in the comments.

I have no understanding of how people can be lonely. If you are lonely go and 
do something to make yourself not lonely.

Confidence plays a very large part in how older people interact. If you've 
ever been in hospital for a long time, you'll likely have found crossing the 
road and going to the supermarket to be initially quite mentally testing 
experiences.

I work with older people and there are many who for one reason or another are 
unable to just toodle along to a coffee morning. Sometimes, in sheltered 
housing, the coffee morning is in the same building, but they are still nervous 
of being among people after time spent away.

Lack of hearing must also not be underestimated. For many they find it hard to 
pick out voices in a crowded room, leading to embarrassing situations, and the 
feeling of being in a glass box.

One of my ladies had a fall while trying to get on a bus. She was quite badly 
hurt, in hospital for 8 weeks, and after that terrified of trying to get up 
that step again, so stopped using buses, and became isolated.

Some people with dementia who know their memories are going are terrified to 
enter social situations where they may not be able to remember names, tick of 
the bingo numbers quick enough, etc. That again, removes their confidence.



go and do something to make yourself not lonely

One of the most important lessons in health and social care is not to judge 
others by what you can do, by one standard. It may be easy for you to rock up 
to a club, just as some of my older people will get on planes and visit distant 
relatives whereas others break into a sweat using a cash machine. People are 
individuals with a myriad of physical and mental health combinations as well as 
experience and behaviour limitations. You may not understand how anyone can be 
lonely, but look closer at who thatanyone is made up of.

There’s nothing like a little Contact-style drama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/08/why-i-love-jodie-foster-contact>
 to kick off the New Year, so Wednesday’s report that thesource of fast radio 
bursts first detected a decade ago has been traced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/04/radio-wave-source-discovered-space>
 is pretty exciting. They’re likely to have emanated from a dwarf galaxy around 
3bn light years from Earth, according to the a paper published in Nature. Since 
2007 there have been 18 fast radio bursts registered, and there’s been a lot of 
debate about what causes these high-energy surges of long waves at the far end 
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

observatories, on the Plains of San Agustin 50 miles west of Socorro, New

There’s still lots of speculation as to what precisely has caused the pulses, 
but the finding is “a real game-changer” according to Heino Falcke, an 
astronomer at Radboud University Nijmegen. I personally feel that it bodes well 
for stargazing and beyond in 2017!

Is this a place to comment on Rafael Behr's piece? I have to say I'm getting 
tired of comment pieces that remark on how pathetic the government is in its 
response to the referendum result and its approach to grasping what leaving the 
EU means. We cannot keep waiting on this government to show the way. The 
Guardian needs to take a stronger line in pointing out that the constitution of 
the UK has changed through our being a member of the EU and that leaving the EU 
means drawing up a new constitutional settlement. This is not a task for one 
political party to take forward, especially one that draws its support from a 
minority of voters and from England primarily.
 
Diplomacy is meant to be discreet, so when senior diplomats make headlines, 
something has gone wrong. The resignation of Ivan Rogers from the UK’s mission 
to Brussels is significant not because the individual at the centre of the 
story was pivotal to the success or failure of Brexit but because it indicates 
a collective unreadiness for the task. Pro-Europeans lament the episode as part 
of a long martyrdom of The Experts. Eurosceptics are glad to see the back of 
someone whose commitment to the Great Continental Disentanglement they always 
doubted. In truth, diplomats come and go. Sir Ivan was due to go in the autumn, 
anyway. What matters in this case is the fact that second-order questions of 
second-tier personnel in the Brexit chain-of-command are elevated to 
first-order news. This is politics abhorring a strategic vacuum.

It has become fashionable to say that Theresa May’s ambitions for Brexit are 
opaque, which isn’t quite true. We know she prioritises immigration control 
over economic integration. We also know that she abhors protectionism and wants 
to preserve favourable terms of trade with the single market (but cannot keep 
full membership). We don’t know whether she has the capability to achieve that 
combination. The mystery is not in the “what” but the “how” and that is a 
question of organisation and negotiating skill. Sir Ivan’s resignation letter 
confirms suspicions leaking out from Whitehall that there is no organising 
principle ahead of the Brexit talks.

The pieces of the jigsaw have been tipped out of the box but not yet arranged 
in any useful fashion. The edges have barely been fished out to construct a 
frame. The prime minister behaves as if this is not a problem because 
everything will fall into place in good time. That is a proposition of faith – 
an invitation to believe that she knows what she is doing. But until we have 
counted the pieces, checked they are all really there, and seen her interlock 
them deftly into some coherent pattern, there is no particular reason – no 
supporting evidence – to believe her.

 
A final couple of thoughts about loneliness – can online communities help?

Get online. Solved.
A million ways to interact with others. Or use the internet to form new groups 
in your local community to get active in some way. Or you know post up things 
in the community or basically do anything other than nothing.

I have no understanding of how people can be lonely. If you are lonely go and 
do something to make yourself not lonely. My Grandparents who are all sadly not 
with us now were part of multiple groups in the communities they lived in, and 
then when they were less able to get around people from those communities would 
visit them, as well as us as the family ofc.

I think the only situation would be of course if someone had a physical 
disability which stopped them going out. Although saying that my aunt had polio 
as a child and was in a wheelchair all her life and she still would go out down 
to coffee mornings and general events in the village. right into her 80's.

Loneliness is something more complex today than previously. We are all more 
and less alone than previously. It's that super-position that creates problems. 
Through the web we are in touch with so many more people and, if we want to, 
are never truly alone. But equally, we are physically with people less often 
and fewer people know us as the physical person.

Truth is that it's the perspective that we take that matters. I was a teen 
when the web was still young and I lived out in the countryside. And that was 
intensely lonely for me. But the friends I had online, especially friends who 
were older than me and treated me like an adult made that period feel bearable. 
And looked at like that the web is something great for bringing people 
together; somewhere that absolutely everyone can find friends.

But we all still crave personal, face to face relationships. And especially at 
Christmas we have a tendency to look at words on a screen and feel that this is 
just a shallow facsimile. In truth what we need are real friends, whether 
online or in meatspace. That's what matters. We shouldn't devalue friends 
because we've never seen them in person. Equally we shouldn't believe that just 
the net is enough, or use it as an excuse not to bother going outside.

Everyone should make it their business to visit elderly parents or relatives 
if they don't already do so. If you don't have any then try adopting some. A 
cup of tea and a chat means the world to lonely, elderly people.
 
Over the last couple of years we’ve hosted a year-long photography project 
where readers contribute an image a day over their 365 days (or 366 in the case 
of 2016 – thanks to the eagle eyed readers who got in touch to mention the leap 
year after we missed it last January!)


The result is a collection of fascinating images from daily life, 
extraordinary events and even personal moments

How can you tackle loneliness for old people? Have places for them to go 
during the day, oh wait it turns out they've been closed down because of cuts.

My dad spoke highly of the local salvation army and their lunches after my mum 
died - even though he saw my extensive family regularly. Stuff like that helps.
 
I met Jo Cox before she became a Labour politician through a mutual friend, 
and then got to know her better once she’d arrived in parliament. She was 
lovely – empathetic, friendly, vivacious and incredibly passionate. And she 
told me she wanted to direct that seemingly endless energy to two key 
priorities: helping civilians in war-torn Syria, andtackling the scourge of 
loneliness

Typically for Jo, she made both cross-party efforts, teaming up on loneliness 
with Conservative Seema Kennedy, who will now take forward the work with Jo’s 
friend and colleague, Rachel Reeves. As they say in this interview I did in 
December, their focus won’t just be the elderly but new mums, children, 
refugees, the disabled and men who often don’t turn to anyone for help.

We could all heed their simple call to action – call a grandparent, visit a 
neighbour, meet the friend you keep putting off.
