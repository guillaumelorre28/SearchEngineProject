I guess it is another of many examples of US English usage that originated 
with German immigrants before travelling back over the Atlantic to us. It’s 
very common in German to begin a sentence with an “Also …” pronounced with the 
emphasis on the first syllable and meaning “Well, …”. Sometimes the meaning of 
a German-influenced word or phrase undergoes a subtle or even radical 
alteration on its way into the English language. The oddest example that I can 
think of is our use of “half two” to mean “half past two”. In German “halb 
zwei” is 1.30 not 2.30.
