The government’s ambition to make Britain’s schools among the best in the 
world in teaching core subjects by 2020 appears to have been foiled, after 
international comparisons published on Tuesday showed few signs of improvement.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s programme for 
international student assessment <http://www.oecd.org/pisa/> (Pisa) found a 
little-changed performance in reading, maths and science among 15- and 
16-year-olds in England – but good enough to make it the best performing UK 
nation after a sharp decline in Scotland’s performance.

In the 2015 election campaign, the Conservatives said they aimed to have 
England among the top countries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/02/conservative-education-plans-branded-election-gimmicks>
 in Europe by 2020 based on international rankings. But the steep improvement 
now required means the ambition is doomed after the latest results were almost
identical to the OECD’s 2012 tests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/03/uk-students-education-oecd-pisa-report>
.

The Pisa exams are administered to more than 500,000 pupils in the 70 
countries that paid to take part, with the three subjects examined worldwide at 
the end of 2015. At the top of the table,Singapore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/singapore> replaced Shanghai for all three 
subjects tested, with Shanghai’s stellar maths effort in 2012 diluted by the 
addition of students from Beijing, Jiangsu and Guangdong this time, sending its 
results tumbling.

The UK’s combined ranking in science rose six places to 15th despite a slight 
fall in pupil performances, illustrating the fluctuations of the Pisa league 
tables and why education experts prefer to look at a country’s exam scores 
rather than international placings to gauge success.

The UK’s maths ranking fell by one place to 27th but its reading position rose 
two places, although in both cases the actual scores were barely changed from 
2012’s exam results.

“For the UK as a whole this is not a bad result: essentially no change,” said 
Robert Coe, professor of education at Durham University. “Now that the 
political contexts of the education systems of the four UK nations are entirely 
separate, people will increasingly concentrate on the performance of those 
separate nations.

“All three measures place England, Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> and Wales in that order, and these 
gaps will no doubt be the focus of intense political attention and rivalry.”

While Shanghai’s demise meant that the gap between the UK and the top of the 
table closed dramatically, the static results make it almost impossible for the 
British government to realise its aim in the 2015 Conservative manifesto “to 
make Britain the best place in the world to study maths, science and 
engineering, measured by improved performance in the Pisa league tables”.

Nicky Morgan, the then education secretary, also said during the election 
campaign that England’s schools were to be “the best in Europe for literacy and 
maths by 2020”.
In the UK average performance in all three subjects has fallen in the past 
three years 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-06T09:23:43/embed.html>
The 2015 results place the UK among a group of similar European countries 
including France and Spain, and behind leading lights such as Finland, Estonia, 
Ireland and Germany.


But ministers in London may be buoyed by England’s better performance compared 
with the three other home nations. Scotland in particular suffered a poor set 
of results, with substantial falls in reading and science compounded by a fall 
in maths.

England scored 500 in reading and 493 in maths, while Scotland dipped to 493 
in reading and 491 in maths, a fall of 13 and seven points respectively from 
2012.

Performance in science fell across the UK in 2015 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-06T09:30:10/embed.html>
Scotland’s weak results left England as the highest scoring UK nation in both 
science and reading, and tied with Northern Ireland for the best result in 
maths.

Labour’s Scottish education spokesman, Iain Gray, said the SNP should be 
ashamed by the results. “These are terrible results after 10 years of SNP 
government. They must wake up to the fact that their cuts to school budgets, 
teachers numbers and support staff are damaging the life chances of Scotland’s 
children,” Gray said.


John Swinney, the Scottish education secretary, admitted the Pisa figures 
“undoubtedly make uncomfortable reading” but said its findings underlined the 
“plain message” that sweeping reforms of school education were needed.

Those would include detailed attainment measures for each school – attacked by 
critics as new league tables, and devolving control to schools and communities.

“It is by carrying through on these reforms – no matter how controversial – 
that we can make Scottish education world-class again,” Swinney said.


Wales also lost ground in science and reading. There was better news for 
reformers in Cardiff with a substantial improvement in maths scores. However, 
Wales alone of the UK nations fell below theOECD 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/oecd> average in all three subjects.
In Scotland performance in reading had its largest fall, from a high in 2012 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-06T09:29:27/embed.html>
Kirsty Williams, Wales’ education secretary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/lib-dem-kirsty-williams-appointed-to-welsh-labour-led-cabinet>
, said the advice she had received from a recent OECD report was to press on 
with the government’s school reforms.

“Pisa may divide opinion but it is the recognised international benchmark for 
skills. It has never been more important to demonstrate to ourselves, and to 
the world, that our young people can compete with the best,” Williams said.
Wales still underperforms in maths compared to the rest of the UK despite 
improvements in 2015 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-06T09:28:28/embed.html>
“Other small, innovative nations have stolen a march on us in their reform 
journeys. But if Ireland and Estonia can do it, so can we.”

Nick Gibb, the schools minister for England, said more grammar schools could 
boost future Pisa results for England: “We know that grammar schools provide a 
good education for their disadvantaged pupils, which is why we want more pupils 
from lower income backgrounds to benefit from them.”
In Australia average rankings in all three subjects have fallen over the past 
six years but are still higher than in the UK 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-06T09:25:30/embed.html>
But Gibbs’ view was disputed by Russell Hobby, general secretary of the 
National Association of Head Teachers, who said Pisa offered “strong evidence” 
that early selection of pupils by schools did not narrow gaps in attainment.

“Any government serious about evidence-based policy must address this 
finding,” Hobby said.

John Jerrim, of the UCL Institute of Education 
<http://educationdatalab.org.uk/2016/12/the-10-key-findings-from-pisa-2015/>, 
said the science results showed England’s grammar school pupils to be among the 
best performers in the world.


“These figures do not provide any evidence as to whether grammar schools are 
more effective than other school types, as differences in the demographic 
characteristics of pupils and their prior achievement has not been taken into 
account,” Jerrim said.


Andreas Schleicher, director of education for the OECD, said the Pisa data 
showed “clearly and consistently” that selection by ability at a young age led 
to middle class students doing better at the expense of the more disadvantaged.

“As you make a system more selective, you have to redouble your efforts to 
mediate its impact on social backgrounds. That is really important,” Schleicher 
said.

Schleicher also said that the spate of school reforms in UK nations were yet 
be felt.


“When I look at Wales, I think the really interesting reforms are too recent 
to show any impact. I actually think they have a lot of promise but you can’t 
see them now,” he said.

“Scotland is more of a surprise to me, I would have hoped and expected that 
some of the efforts they have made would have come out. But in the data there 
is no evidence, rather the opposite.”


In England, with the advent of academies and greater school autonomy, “you’d 
have hoped that, certainly at the top end, England would be more prominent than 
it is. Maybe it’s too soon,” Schleicher said.


“When you don’t see improvements it’s important to revisit maybe not the 
design but the implementation. It’s important to keep a careful eye on that,” 
Schleicher said.

Singapore’s success, topping all three tables in mathematics, reading and 
science, has been seized on by enthusiasts of the“mastery” approach to maths 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/05/can-you-solve-it-are-you-smarter-than-a-singaporean-10-year-old>
, deployed to great success in Singapore and east Asian countries at the top of 
the OECD tables and inother recent international maths tests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/29/english-pupils-improve-results-in-international-maths-and-science-exams>
.
In the US the average ranking for maths fell to 470 in 2015 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-06T09:26:29/embed.html>
The mastery approach aims to deepen pupils’ conceptual understanding of 
mathematical concepts, covering fewer topics but in greater depth.

The UK government has developed a teacher exchange programme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/26/shanghai-teaching-method-could-improve-uk-results-within-four-years>
 with Shanghai and wants to roll out the mastery method in England’s 
classrooms. So far, more than 360 schools have implemented the mastery method, 
reaching 3,000 teachers and almost 100,000 primary and secondary pupils.

Helen Drury, executive director of the mathematics mastery development 
programme, said the UK remained in “a frustratingly average position” in the 
Pisa tables but the results were a reminder of what can be learned from high 
performing countries.

British teachers should be given time for high-quality professional 
development throughout their career, as is standard in Singapore and Shanghai, 
Drury said.

Details from the report showed a high percentage of head teachers in the UK 
complained about staff shortages, while truancy was higher than many other OECD 
countries.


Why do you think schools in some areas perform better than others? In the UK, 
England’s results are now better than Scotland and Wales, and in Europe, 
Finland, Estonia, Ireland and Germany lead the top of the table with their 
results.

Sample Pisa exam questions – science

Q: Most migratory birds gather in one area and then migrate in large groups 
rather than individually. This behaviour is a result of evolution. Which of the 
following is the best scientific explanation for the evolution of this 
behaviour in most migratory birds?

A: Birds that migrated individually or in small groups were less likely to 
survive and have offspring.

B: Birds that migrated individually or in small groups were more likely to 
find adequate food.

C: Flying in large groups allowed other bird species to join the migration.

D: Flying in large groups allowed each bird to have a better chance of finding 
a nesting site.

[answer: A]



Q: Rocks in space that enter Earth’s atmosphere are called meteoroids. 
Meteoroids heat up, and glow as they fall through Earth’s atmosphere. Most 
meteoroids burn up before they hit Earth’s surface. When a meteoroid hits Earth 
it can make a hole called a crater.

As a meteoroid approaches Earth and its atmosphere, it speeds up. Why does 
this happen?

A: The meteoroid is pulled in by the rotation of Earth.

B: The meteoroid is pushed by the light of the Sun.

C: The meteoroid is attracted to the mass of Earth.

D: The meteoroid is repelled by the vacuum of space.

[answer: C]
