LLB, DipHE or CertHE in 2016-17.

full-time course and dividing it by the number of years it takes the student to 
complete the course.


£10,500 for international students, or £7,500 for an integrated foundation 
year.


Bursaries and scholarships Cumbria bursaries, worth up to £4,000, are designed 
to support students with a household income of less than £25,000. These 
bursaries are also offered to some part-time students (worth £1,500 in total 
over the first three years of the course - £500 cash in each year).

The university also offers eight progression awards to new undergraduate 
students who apply to the university immediately after completing courses at 
the selected further education colleges. One Progression Award is granted per 
college. These awards are worth £1,500.
