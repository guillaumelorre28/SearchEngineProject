The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> have released an analysis of the 
allegedly Russian government-sponsored hacking groups blamed for breaching 
several different parts of the Democratic party during the 2016 elections.

The 13-page document, released on Thursday and meant for information 
technology professionals, came as Barack Obamaannounced sanctions  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/29/barack-obama-sanctions-russia-election-hack>
against Russia for interfering in the 2016 elections. The report was criticized 
by security experts, who said it lacked depth and came too late.

“The activity by [Russian intelligence services] is part of an ongoing 
campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the US government and its 
citizens,” wrote the authors of the government report. “This [joint analysis 
report] provides technical indicators related to many of these operations, 
recommended mitigations, suggested actions to take in response to the 
indicators provided, and information on how to report such incidents to the US 
government.”

The government report follows several from the private sector, notably a 
lengthy section in a Microsoft report from 2015 on a hacking team referred to 
as “advanced persistent threat 28” (APT 28), which the company’s internal 
nomenclature calls Strontium and others have called Fancy Bear. Also mentioned 
in the government document is another group called APT 29 or Cozy Bear.

Before the government report, other security researchers tracked “the bears” 
to breaches including

the summer 2016attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/22/russian-hackers-world-anti-doping-agency-dnc-hack-fancy-bear>
, apparently an act of revenge against whistleblowing Russian athlete Yuliya 
Stepanova. Other attacks attributed to the same set of apparently Russian 
actors include an attack on Georgian elections in 2008, the hack of French news 
channel TV5Monde, and a Twitter account and blog supposedly operated by a 
hacker calling himself Guccifer 2.0 but more likely aninstrument of Fancy Bear

 the attack on the Democratic National Committee shortly before subsequent 
breaches of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Hillary 
Clinton campaign were discovered.

Security experts on Twitter criticized the government report as too basic. 
Jonathan Zdziarski, a highly regarded security researcher, compared the joint 
action report to achild’s activity center

Tom Killalea, former vice-president of security at Amazon and a Capital One 
board member,wrote <https://twitter.com/tomk_/status/814568926545788928>: 
“Russian attack on DNC similar to so many other attacks in past 15yrs. Big 
question: Why such poor incident response?”
