After recent events, some will already be nostalgic for a pre-Trump world. Yet 
nostalgia is a feeling of familiarity which doesn’t always connect to actual 
memories. Indeed those who wanted Trump to make America great again were 
harking back to a version of the country that never really existed. Research 
has found that the brain systems which control recognition and familiarity are 
quite different from each other. The two usually work together but can be 
activated separately, meaning it’s possible to feel a strong sense of 
acquaintanceship with a place or thing, when in fact you have never been here 
or used it before.

This is why you can completely forget where and when you were introduced to 
someone, but just know that you’ve seen them before. Familiarity is instant, 
whereas memory recall can be a slow process - with lots of effort, it’s 
sometimes possible to remember the room where you met them, or the time of year 
it was. These details can then help unearth the full memory, something we 
should rely upon more than fleeting familiarity, especially in the post-factual 
world we live in.
