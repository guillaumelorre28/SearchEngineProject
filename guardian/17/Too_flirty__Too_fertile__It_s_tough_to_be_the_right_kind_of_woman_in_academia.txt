“I wouldn’t do a session with you,” a colleague said at a conference. CC, we 
can call him. Prior to this, I had met him at a handful of other conferences in 
a handful of other UK cities. Which is a lot, really, considering I had not 
been in the UK long. But I guess that’s what happens when you work in a 
relatively small field that draws the same crowd to each of its events.

At first, I was confused by his comment.


“But CC,” I pointed out, “we’ve already been on a panel together. We have lots 
of shared research interests. Why wouldn’t you do another panel with me?”


“I don’t mean I wouldn’t agree to be on a panel if you were on it,” he said. 
“I mean I wouldn’t actually work on a project with you. I wouldn’t collaborate 
with you.”


Sexual harassment is rife in universities, but complaining means risking your 
career

Did he think poorly of my scholarship? Of my speaking skills? He was a senior 
academic; I didn’t even have a full-time lectureship.

“Why not?” I asked unhappily.


“I can’t. My wife thinks you’re a threat,” he replied. “She thinks you flirt 
with me.”


That I did not expect.


As I pulled my lower jaw up to reconnect with its partner, I considered this 
claim. OK, calm down, I told myself. There might be a reason this woman, who 
has never met me, feels this way. Something he has told her has made her think 
I’m out to ensnare him.

Maybe it’s because…

Perhaps it’s because I smile a lot. This is often commented on, along with 
compliments on my unBritish teeth.

Perhaps it’s because I am not always appropriate (when I was 36 weeks 
pregnant, for example, I discovered, at a routine doctor’s appointment, that I 
was six centimetres dilated. Six! And there I was just walking around with a 
baby about to fall out of me. I was astounded, and posted it on Facebook. My 
poor mom had to call me up and say: “Please can you take down your public 
announcement? All my friends are calling me up to ask about your vagina.”)

Perhaps it’s because when I like people, I am very obvious about it. I might 
even say: “Hey, I like you!” I’ll seek them out. I’ll text them for no 
important reason. Where I come from, we call this open and honest. Here in the 
UK, it’s considered very strange.

How should we cope with sexism? That's the wrong question

But really, what I thought about my colleague’s revelation was: how 
ridiculous! I laughed. I pointed out how silly it was. When we parted, CC 
hugged me goodbye, and I thought all was well.

Then I became concerned that I had perhaps been too glib, that maybe this was 
a real issue in his marriage. So I apologised, via Messenger, that evening. No 
reply. I wrote again the next day, suggesting he bring his family over the next 
time they were in town. Still no response.

I was taken aback, hurt, surprised. Weren’t we friends? Or friends-ish? 

The penny drops

Finally it dawned on me that I was hurt not just personally but 
professionally. This man was a senior academic with funding to organise events 
in my field. He had recognised the value of my research and had offered to put 
me in touch with a prestigious editor.

He could help me make progress in academia. But instead – presumably because I 
had smiled and been open, because I hadn’t censored my every word in his 
presence, because I had treated him as friend as much as professional contact – 
he could very seriously hurt my career.

I shouldn’t have been surprised. I could list for you a score of things that 
senior academic men have said to me over the past two years that reeked of 
entrenched sexism. This sort of thing:

“If you take this [very part-time, low-status] job, we need to you to promise 
to stay in it to the end. Unless, of course, your [high-flying] husband finds a 
better job elsewhere!”

I was being stalked, but my university refused to protect me

“Tim Hunt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/30/the-guardian-view-on-the-tim-hunt-affair-an-explosive-combination-of-science-sexism-and-social-media>
? Oh, well that wasn’t such a big deal. It was just sexism – it’s not like it 
was racism.”

“Your CV looks good, but the problem is that you had so many kids!”

For the most part, these comments were made by men who have been supportive of 
my career. But what they say speaks to a bigger picture: professional women are 
categorised as less important than men in the workforce; sexism is not 
considered a big problem; being overly maternal stifles women’s careers.

“I think academia is more sexist here,” I once confided, tentatively, to a 
male academic colleague in my university.

“That’s not fair,” he responded. “In the US, you’ve got rape culture 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/07/brock-turner-statement-stanford-rape-case-campus-culture>
. How can you compare that to the minor incidents here?” (He didn’t say in the 
US, we had Donald Trump as our incoming president, but how could he know? Who 
would have imagined it?)


“Minor incidents” have major implications. Sexism comes in many forms. And it 
doesn’t help that men in academia, as elsewhere, are still the top dogs.

We turn to them as mentors, as colleagues, as friends. The last of these 
categories is the place where we least expect to get hurt. But I’m sad to say, 
it is often those men whom we consider our “friends” – those with whom we are 
warm and open – who hurt us the most.
