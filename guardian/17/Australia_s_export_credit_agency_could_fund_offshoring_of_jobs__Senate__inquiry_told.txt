Australia’s export credit agency could end up financing companies that have 
axed their domestic workforces to manufacture more cheaply overseas, aSenate 
inquiry

 has been told.

The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation could become instrumental in the 
“further offshoring of Australian manufacturing” underdraft laws 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5758>
 proposed by the Coalition that would scrap the requirement to fund only 
exporters that manufacture “substantially or wholly in Australia”, the 
Australia Institute has warned in a submission seen by Guardian Australia.

And a new arm of the progressive thinktank, Jubilee Australia, warned in its 
published submission that the government’s proposed reforms fell short of what 
was needed to make a secretive agency accountable in light of its chequered 
record financing overseas mining projects linked to civil strife and 
environmental degradation.

Jubilee called for changes to the bill, including to remove Efic’s exemptions 
from environmental protection and freedom-of-information laws.

Jubilee, which has studied in-depth Efic’s role in funding problematic 
projects in Papua New Guinea, also said legislation should force the trade 
minister to disclose how decisions to fund risky projects in the “national 
interest” were assessed and the reasons for approval.

And Efic’s governing act should ensure it carried out “adequate assessment and 
disclosure of human rights impacts and environmental damage” of projects it 
finances, Jubilee said.

Its submissions were backed by submissions from Oxfam Australia, AidWatch, 
Greenpeace, CAER (Corporate Analysis, Enhance Responsibility), the Human Rights 
Law Centre and Australian Lawyers for Human Rights.

Efic in its own submission said its act already recognised “international 
obligations with regard to environmental, social and human rights”.

The agency also pointed to the public release of independent audit reports 
every two years as existing way of raising “confidence in EFIC’s environmental 
and social assessment of transactions”.

The minister for trade, Steven Ciobo, told parliament 
<http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2Fe089c8c3-75b7-4858-80ac-58b4e4c6e749%2F0021%22>
 in November that the export finance and insurance corporation amendment 
(support for commonwealth entities) bill 2016 would “enhance Efic’s capacity to 
provide loans” to small and medium-sized Australian exporters.

It would allow Efic to directly finance businesses that substantially 
manufactured overseas, rather than just provide guarantees for private finance.

Ciobo said the change “rightly focuses on the benefit flowing back to 
Australia from the export activity – like export earnings – rather than details 
of where the goods are assembled, where investments are made, or who the buyer 
is”.

But the Australia Institute said this seemed to “remove any focus” on the 
export of Australian-made goods, which the original Efic Act was intended to 
help.

“Contrary to the minister [Ciobo’s] claim … that this would mean ‘more job 
opportunities and a better standard of living for all Australians’, it has the 
potential to reduce jobs that produce goods and services in Australia,” it said.

It said “a garment company based in Australia could move all production 
offshore but still be eligible for Efic’s services”.

“This has the potential to not only deprive finance to companies that produce 
in Australia but also to give advantage to their competition in other 
countries.”

However, a submission 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Foreign_Affairs_Defence_and_Trade/Completed_inquiries/2010-13/eficbill201343/submissions>
 by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade noted there were “caveats” in 
the bill limiting Efic’s proposed new powers to give guarantees to foreign 
subsidiaries of Australian-based parent companies.

“Specifically, Efic’s ability to provide a guarantee to a foreign subsidiary 
is only possible if the [small to medium enterprise] parent in Australia 
certifies that the guarantee will not result in a net reduction in the number 
of employees of the SME in Australia,” Dfat said.

Ciobo in November said “following Efic’s provision of services to the Northern 
Australia Infrastructure Fund [NAIF], we know there is latent demand within the 
commonwealth public service to leverage Efic’s specialist expertise around 
financing”.

The bill would override current laws that stop Efic sharing “its expertise 
within the Australian government”, Ciobo said, adding access to the agency 
would be “subject to ministerial approval”.

But the Australia Institute said Efic’s work with NAIF – which is considering 
a $1b loan to Adani - was particularly “concerning” given its record of “due 
diligence failures” around overseas mines.

Efic’s largest loan to date was to the ExxonMobil-led Papua New Guinea LNG 
project in 2009. That project has since been linked to a PNG government 
financial crisis and civil conflict that risks escalating into serious violence.

“Efic was grossly incompetent at assessing social, economic and political 
risks related to this project and must bear some responsibility for a downturn 
in the PNG economy and the current conflict in Hela province,” the Australia 
Institute said. It was one of a “litany of examples where Efic has been unable 
to assess risks associated with large scale resource projects.”

Efic finance helped with the Rio Tinto-controlled Panguna mine expansion in 
the 1980s, with exploitation related to that mine leading to the Bougainville 
civil war, “the largest and most destructive war in the South Pacific region 
since world war two”.

It also backed development of BHP’s Ok Tedi mine, where waste dumping resulted 
in environmental destruction of the Fly river.

The Australia Institute cited Efic’s current proposal to fund the Boikarabelo 
coal project in South Africa, which would “directly compete with Australian 
mines” in selling thermal coal to markets like India.

The South African mine’s proponent, Resource Generation or ResGen, is listed 
on the Australian stock exchange but had no office or employees in Australia, 
it said.

Efic had “conducted no public analysis of how Boikarabelo and Waterberg mines 
would affect potential exports of Australian coal to India”, the institute said.

If the governments bill passed unchanged, Efic’s resources would be more 
easily available to producers who like ResGen were “nominally Australian” but 
performed all the key work overseas, it said.

A spokeswoman for Efic said the agency was not prepared to comment on the 
Australia Institute submission as it had not yet been published by the Senate 
inquiry.
