Clare Hollingworth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/10/clare-hollingworth-obituary> was 
my mentor and gave me confidence when I joined the Guardian – a greenhorn and 
virtually the only other female foreign correspondent. On trips to Hong Kong in 
later years as diplomatic correspondent, I always saw her: she took me under 
her wing and introduced me tothe Foreign Correspondents’ Club 
<http://www.fcchk.org/celebration-of-life-for-clare-hollingworth/>, where she 
was the acknowledged queen, and hugely respected and loved. Chris Patten, the 
last governor, was a great supporter of hers. She was an indomitable force and 
always a generous and loyal friend.
