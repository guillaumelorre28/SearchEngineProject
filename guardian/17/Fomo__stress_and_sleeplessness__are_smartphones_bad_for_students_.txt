As with all technology, mobile phones can have their pros and cons, 
<http://unitec.researchbank.ac.nz/handle/10652/1270> depending on how they are 
used. At their best, they can be useful tools for staying in touch, finding out 
new information and co-ordinating social activities. At worst, they can 
negatively affect concentration, communication and sleep, or increase fear of 
missing out, procrastination and stress.

 These potential negative consequences are especially important to consider 
for teenagers.Their brains work differently to those of adults 
<https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/dec/09/teenage-brain-psychologist-guide-teachers-classroom>
: they are more susceptible to peer pressure and have less self-control.

The dangers


Reduced concentration
A study on the science of distraction found that each time an office worker 
was distracted (say from a text message or email), it took them up to an 
average of25 minutes to refocus  
<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/magazine/meet-the-life-hackers.html?_r=0>on 
the original task at hand. That’s what makes students doing their homework with 
their mobile phone nearby so problematic. It is a myth that most people can 
multitask. In truth, it takes up a lot of time, energy, effort and focus to 
switch between two tasks.

Students don’t even have to be on their mobile phone for it to distract them. 
For tasks that require attention and cognitive demands (ie homework), 
researchers have found thatthe mere presence of a mobile phone may be 
sufficiently distracting to damage attention.

Reduced face-to face, quality communication
In a fascinating study, 
<http://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/09/how-mere-presence-of-mobile-phone.html?m=1> 
researchers asked strangers to talk to each other for 10 minutes. Half the 
participants had the conversation with their mobile phones on the table; the 
other half had a notebook instead. The results? Those who chatted in sight of 
their mobile phone said they were less likely to be friends with their partner 
and reported feeling less close to them.

What was particularly interesting was that the participants were not aware of 
the effect that having their mobile phone out had on them.Mobile phones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mobilephones> can affect the quality of 
face-to-face communication even if you don’t consciously know it.

Increased Fomo
The fear of missing out (Fomo) is very common in teenagers 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/schoolreport/31942696>. It is characterised by the need 
to know what everyone is doing and worrying that they are having more fun than 
you. Mobile phones can be a dangerous vehicle for those with high Fomo. These 
students are more likely to experience lower overall quality in their mood, 
have increased anxiety, and aremore likely to check their phones and social 
media during lessons or study time

Disrupted sleep
Using your mobile phone too much in the evening can lead to going to bed 
later, getting less overall sleep, and lower quality sleep 
<http://www.sleep-journal.com/article/S1389-9457(10)00163-2/abstract>. Why does 
being on your mobile phone affect your sleep? The sleep hormone,melatonin 
<https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/melatonin-and-sleep>, typically gets 
released at around 9pm at night. However, the bright backlight on a mobile 
phone can trick your brain into thinking it’s still day,suppressing the release 
of melatonin 
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687012001159>. This 
means being on your phone late at night still keeps your brain awake and alert 
at the exact time you want to be feeling relaxed and sleepy.

Increased procrastination
Procrastination is extremely common in students 
<http://www.innerdrive.co.uk/Release_Your_Inner_Drive/7-ways-to-overcome-procrastination/>
. So much so that75% of US college students 
<http://studiemetro.au.dk/fileadmin/www.studiemetro.au.dk/Procrastination_2.pdf>
 consider themselves procrastinators. In our experience, if you were to ask a 
group of teenagers what they do when they are procrastinating, the common 
answers tend to involve their phone; texting, social media, games and shopping. 
Mobile phones might not turn students into procrastinators, but they can 
certainly act as a vehicle for their procrastination.

Increased stress
Being over-reliant on a mobile phone can be bad for a person’s psychological 
health. Excessive use of mobile phones has been associated withanxiety, 
irritation, frustration and impatience. 
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321300397X> A study on 
young people and mobile phones found that60% reported 
<http://www.akademiai.com/doi/abs/10.1556/JBA.3.2014.015> that they felt very 
agitated when they could not access their phone.

Are students addicted to their phones?

A recent study found that US students aged 19-24 spend around 95 minutes each 
day texting, 49 minutes emailing, and 39 minutes on Facebook.Young women 
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214007626> are more 
likely to develop addictive mobile phone behaviours than young men. Those who 
are addicted to their phone (known as being nomophobic) report experiencing
phantom vibrations 
<http://www.bps.org.uk/news/turn-your-smart-phone-beat-stress>, which is the 
phenomenon of checking your phone even when no messages have been received. 
Research by the Institute of Pyschiatry has found that adults who are 
distracted from work by emails and their mobile phone suffer a fall of10 IQ 
points <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4471607.stm> (more than twice the impact 
on IQ of smoking marijuana).

Is banning phones the answer?

London School of Economics and Political Science recently produced a report 
<https://aefpweb.org/sites/default/files/webform/aefp40/lpb_rm_mobile_phones_v21.pdf>
 that found that grades improved in schools that banned mobile phones. This 
effect was most pronounced for struggling students; however, trying to enforce 
this is a contentious issue for manystudents, parents 
<http://schoolsimprovement.net/pupil-petition-wont-stop-headteacher-banning-mobile-phones-at-secondary-school>
 andteachers. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/27/should-mobiles-be-banned-schools>

Mobile phones are now so entwined in our daily lives that, even if banned at 
school, teenagers will be on their phones for long periods at home. In that 
case, here are our five tips to help students manage their mobile phone usage:

Practice what you preach
Get into the habit of managing your own mobile phone usage. It is very easy to 
get into the habit of checking your phone too much late at night. Simple tips 
on how to avoid this can be foundhere 
<http://www.innerdrive.co.uk/Release_Your_Inner_Drive/your-phone-at-night/>.


Encourage students to put their phone away during homework
Or at the very least, encourage students to put their phone on airplane mode. 
Self-control can be hard, so help students and parents manage theirstudy 
environment at home. 
<http://www.innerdrive.co.uk/Release_Your_Inner_Drive/is-school-one-big-marshmallow-test/>


Turn down the backlight on mobile phones
It is best not to be on your phone in the run-up to bedtime 
<http://www.innerdrive.co.uk/Release_Your_Inner_Drive/9-common-sleep-mistakes/>
, but students can’t resist doing so, advise them to dim the backlight on their 
screens.

Accept social media for what it is 
No-one is as happy as they seem on Facebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> or as wise as they appear on 
Twitter. Help students understand that people often project a false 
representation of themselves online. Encourage them not to spend too much time 
comparing themselves to others

Explain the myth of multitasking 
Demonstrate that when a person tries to do two things at once there is often a 
drop in either accuracy or speed. This can lead on to a discussion about the 
kind of things that distract them while doing their homework.
