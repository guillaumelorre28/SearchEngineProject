Obama criticises FBI: we don’t operate on innuendo – video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/02/obama-criticises-fbi-we-dont-operate-on-innuendo-video>
 * Barack Obama criticised 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/barack-obama-fbi-hillary-clinton-emails-election-polls>
 the way the FBI revealed a new investigation of emails possibly linked to 
Hillary Clinton’s private email servers, a move that has rocked the US 
presidential election in its final stretch. “I do think that there is a norm 
that when there are investigations, we don’t operate on innuendo,” Obama told 
the online outletNowThisNews <https://nowthisnews.com/>. “We don’t operate on 
incomplete information. We don’t operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete 
decisions that are made.” 
 * Clinton, addressing a rally in traditionally red Arizona, told supporters 
the “state is in play for the first time in years”. In front of a crowd of 
15,000 – one of the largest of her campaign – she lambasted Trump’s attacks on 
Muslims, Latinos and women and said she wanted to be the first Democratic 
candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996 to win the state.  Clinton during a

 * A key confidante of Trump’s provided new details about the “mutual friend” 
of Julian Assange who served as a back channel to give him broad tips in 
advance about WikiLeaks’ releases of emails to and from key allies of 
Clinton’s. Roger Stone, a longtime unofficial adviser to the Republican 
presidential nominee, was briefed in general terms in advance about the 
sensitive and embarrassing leaked Democratic emails by an American libertarian 
who works in the media on the “opinion side”,he told the Guardian in an 
interview.

 * A woman who is suing Trump for allegedly raping her as a child abandoned a 
plan to speak publicly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-13-year-old-cancels-public-event>
 today, citing death threats. The woman, known by the pseudonym Jane Doe, hid 
from media who were invited to her lawyer’s Los Angeles office for a press 
conference in which she was expected to reveal her identity. “Jane Doe has 
received numerous threats today as have all the Trump accusers that I have 
represented,” attorney Lisa Bloom told a room full of frustrated reporters. 
“She has decided she is too afraid to show her face. She has been here all day, 
ready to do it, but unfortunately she is in terrible fear. We’re going to have 
to reschedule. I apologize to all of you who came. I have nothing further.”

 * In an interview with a New Hampshire radio station, New Hampshire senator 
Kelly Ayotte declared that she would not want her 12-year-old daughter in the 
same room as either Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump or former 
president Bill Clinton. “I wouldn’t want my daughter in the room with any of 
them,” Ayotte responded,according to CNN. 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/ayotte-daughter-trump-clinton/index.html>
 “But, the point of this, that, uh, you know, why would I want my daughter in 
the room with them? You know, and this isn’t about my daughter. I love my 
daughter and um, you know, obviously being a mom is a very important to me.”

 * In a Louisiana senate debate, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke was 
asked about an article on his website that made numerous and repeated 
references to “CNN Jews” in a story about a leaked video that showed Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. 
“Well, lemme tell you something – we have to start talking openly about any 
subject,” Duke said, “and there is a problem in America with a very strong, 
powerful, tribal group that dominates our media and dominates our international 
banking.”

The last Democrat to win here, she says, “was my husband in 1996 – one of the

Clinton swings back to climate change.

She says she has a plan to boost renewable energy and help communities prepare 
for the effects of climate change.

Unlike Trump, she doesn’t think it’s a hoax.

 * Barack Obama criticised 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/barack-obama-fbi-hillary-clinton-emails-election-polls>
 the way the FBI revealed a new investigation of emails possibly linked to 
Hillary Clinton’s private email servers, a move that has rocked the US 
presidential election in its final stretch. “I do think that there is a norm 
that when there are investigations, we don’t operate on innuendo,” Obama told 
the online outletNowThisNews <https://nowthisnews.com/>. “We don’t operate on 
incomplete information. We don’t operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete 
decisions that are made.” 
 * Clinton, addressing a rally in traditionally red Arizona, told supporters 
the “state is in play for the first time in years”. In front of a crowd of 
15,000 – one of the largest of her campaign – she lambasted Trump’s attacks on 
Muslims, Latinos and women and said she wanted to be the first Democratic 
candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996 to win the state.  Clinton during a

 * A key confidante of Trump’s provided new details about the “mutual friend” 
of Julian Assange who served as a back channel to give him broad tips in 
advance about WikiLeaks’ releases of emails to and from key allies of 
Clinton’s. Roger Stone, a longtime unofficial adviser to the Republican 
presidential nominee, was briefed in general terms in advance about the 
sensitive and embarrassing leaked Democratic emails by an American libertarian 
who works in the media on the “opinion side”,he told the Guardian in an 
interview.

 * A woman who is suing Trump for allegedly raping her as a child abandoned a 
plan to speak publicly

 today, citing death threats. The woman, known by the pseudonym Jane Doe, hid 
from media who were invited to her lawyer’s Los Angeles office for a press 
conference in which she was expected to reveal her identity. “Jane Doe has 
received numerous threats today as have all the Trump accusers that I have 
represented,” attorney Lisa Bloom told a room full of frustrated reporters. 
“She has decided she is too afraid to show her face. She has been here all day, 
ready to do it, but unfortunately she is in terrible fear. We’re going to have 
to reschedule. I apologize to all of you who came. I have nothing further.”

 * In an interview with a New Hampshire radio station, New Hampshire senator 
Kelly Ayotte declared that she would not want her 12-year-old daughter in the 
same room as either Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump or former 
president Bill Clinton. “I wouldn’t want my daughter in the room with any of 
them,” Ayotte responded,according to CNN.

 “But, the point of this, that, uh, you know, why would I want my daughter in 
the room with them? You know, and this isn’t about my daughter. I love my 
daughter and um, you know, obviously being a mom is a very important to me.”

 * In a Louisiana senate debate, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke was 
asked about an article on his website that made numerous and repeated 
references to “CNN Jews” in a story about a leaked video that showed Republican 
presidential nominee Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. 
“Well, lemme tell you something – we have to start talking openly about any 
subject,” Duke said, “and there is a problem in America with a very strong, 
powerful, tribal group that dominates our media and dominates our international 
banking.”
 
The Clinton camp are certainly on their Twitter game this evening (she was 
born in Chicago, to be fair):

In the night’s other news, the Chicago Cubs won the world series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/03/world-series-game-7-chicago-cubs-cleveland-indians-mlb>
. No tweets from either candidate yet – can they be far off? – but confirmation 
that at least one of them was watching:

If you're wondering, Clinton did indeed watch that. In her car in the 
motorcade in Tempe, on Philippe Reines' laptop.

And here’s Guardian US’ Mona Chalabi on whether the polls really are 
tightening – and whether it matters anyway:

Clinton's 'October surprise' helps Trump in polls – but will it affect 
election day?

And with that Clinton is finished, giving her time to catch the end of the 
world series game, which isstill going on:

“We are on the path to one of the biggest turnouts in history … let’s make 
that the story of this election,” she says.

“I don’t want any of us to wake up next week and think ohhhhhh.” (This is 
probably a sentiment shared by many people of whatever political stripes.)
 
“This state is in play for the first time in years!” Clinton tells the crowd.

The last Democrat to win here, she says, “was my husband in 1996 – one of the 
many reasons Bill and I love Arizona.”

We have a real chance to turn this state blue again.
 
Clinton swings back to climate change.

She says she has a plan to boost renewable energy and help communities prepare 
for the effects of climate change.

Unlike Trump, she doesn’t think it’s a hoax.
 
I think there was a brief mention of tackling climate change there. More than 
in the debates, I guess.

Just as controversially, Clinton claims making lists is “maybe a women’s 
thing”. (Not this woman: I’m more of a “random collection of Post-Its” person.)
