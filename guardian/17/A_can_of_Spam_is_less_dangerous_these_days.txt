too much red meat causes cancer”, before noting that Cancer Research UK is a 
“reliable source … for advice and support” (The truth about cancer diets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/16/everything-you-want-to-know-about-diets-and-cancer>
, G2, 16 January). However, responding to the WHO’s October 2015 International 
Agency for Research on Cancer report which classified red meat as “probably 
carcinogenic to humans”, Professor Tim Key, Cancer Research UK’s epidemiologist 
at the University of Oxford, said: “Cancer Research UK supports IARC’s decision 
that there’s strong enough evidence to classify … red meat as a probable cause 
of cancer.

• The letter headed “Standing in solidarity with Brazil’s Lula 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/13/standing-in-solidarity-with-brazils-lula>
” (14 January) shows a remarkably one-sided view and a lack of concern for the 
facts. An example: “Investigating Lula, prosecutors have been unable to find 
any illegal activity committed.” This is nonsense. Lula has been charged on 
various counts including money laundering, being a member of a criminal 
organisation, influence peddling and misconduct. More than 50 Brazilian 
politicians, past and present and from various parties, have been charged with 
illegal activities and Lula is one of them.

• As was said of Wall Street corporations when the US supreme court granted 
them “personhood”, I’ll believe robots are people when the state of Texas 
executes one (Letters

• I don’t know about corned beef as I don’t buy it, but Spam has replaced the 
old key opening with a ring pull, presumably to reduce hand injuries (Letters

• I have crunchy peanut butter on Weetabix (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/16/experiencing-trump-image-overload>
, 17 January). My family think I’m weird, though they appreciate my lack of 
conversation over breakfast.
