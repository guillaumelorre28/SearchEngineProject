Each week on the Guardian’s podcast What Would a Feminist Do?, host Jessica 
Valenti tackles a different issue that women face today. Next week, we’re doing 
a post-election debrief.

As always we want to hear from you: do you have anxieties or concerns about a 
President Trump? What specifically do you think will change?
