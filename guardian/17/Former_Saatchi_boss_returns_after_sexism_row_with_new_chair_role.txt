Kevin Roberts, the former chairman of Saatchi & Saatchi who resigned after a 
sexism row, has taken a role chairing a UK communications group that says 70% 
of its leadership team are women.

In August, Roberts was put on leave and subsequently resigned

 from Publicis Groupe, the parent company of Saatchi & Saatchi, after provoking 
fury with his comments about women in aninterview with Business Insider

.

Roberts, who is from Lancashire and ran Saatchi & Saatchi for 20 years, said 
the debate about gender diversity, lack of women in leadership roles and sexism 
in the advertising industry was “fucking over”. He also said women in the ad 
industry lacked ambition and were not held back by sexism.

Asked about female campaigners such as the advertising consultant Cindy 
Gallop, who tweeted thatsexual harassment was endemic in the media, advertising 
and every industry

, Roberts said: “I think she’s got problems that are of her own making. I think 
she’s making up a lot of the stuff to create a profile, and to take applause, 
and to get on a soap[box].”


Gallop said Publicis Groupe, the third largest marketing services company in 
the world, should have fired Roberts.

Roberts, who also held the role of head coach at Publicis Groupe, has taken 
the role of chairman at Beattie as it looks to continue expanding outside the 
UK.

The company, which employs 120 people in the UK, said seven of its 10-person 
leadership team were women.

“Beattie is a creative communications consultancy with enormous potential to 
grow internationally,” Roberts said. “We are an integrated marketing and 
communications company with foundations in PR, marketing, creativity, content, 
technology and data. We have no plans to become a traditional advertising 
agency.”

The company is looking to expand further in the UK as well as North America 
and Australasia.

Beattie, which has eight UK offices trading under three brands, recently 
announced plans to open three offices in Canada.

The company was founded 30 years ago in Scotland by the journalist Gordon 
Beattie, who continues as president. Beattie is predicting turnover of £50m by 
2020.
