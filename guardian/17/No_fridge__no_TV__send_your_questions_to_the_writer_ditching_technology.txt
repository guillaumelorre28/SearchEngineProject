Technology is king. Most people spend their days at work staring at a computer 
screen. When we’re not doing that we’re on our phones, scrolling through social 
media, watching Netflix, shopping online or warming up food in the microwave. 
So what happens when you try to ditch technological devices?

Mark Boyle is going to find out and will write about his experiences over the 
next year. In hisfirst column today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/19/life-without-technology-rejecting-technology>
, he explains his ambitious plan:

From Wednesday, I’m rejecting the world of complex technology entirely. That 
means no laptop, no internet, no phone, no washing machine, no tapped water, no 
gas, no fridge, no television or electronic music; no anything requiring the 
copper-mining, oil-rigging, plastics-manufacturing essential to the production 
of a single toaster or solar photovoltaic system.

Do you have a question or a comment for him during his technology abstinence? 
We’ll make sure he gets them – through old-fashioned snail mail.

Guardian, 90 York Way, London, N1 9AG.
