Figures released by LSL showed there were 31,400 sales to first-time buyers 
during March, the highest figure since the property market was near its peak 
six-and-a-half years ago, bolstered in part by the government's Help to Buy 
scheme. However, from 26 April getting a mortgage could become harder as 
homebuyers and remortgagers will face tougher checks from lenders and be asked 
to give more details about their spending.

With these stories in mind, we're looking to hear from recent first-time 
buyers, those who are in the process of buying their first home and those who 
are thinking of stepping on the first rung of the property ladder. As the 
tougher rules come into force, we would also be keen to hear how borrowers have 
got on.

Whatever your experience, good or bad, we would like to hear from you to get a 
better picture of the human stories behind house buying figures. Share your 
stories with GuardianWitness and we will use the most interesting as part of 
our coverage.
