The housemates

After Helen Pidd and Yasser, her Syrian lodger, wrote about their house-share 
in January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/09/my-syrian-refugee-lodger-helen-pidd>
, they were inundated with offers of help, dinner invitations and football 
tickets. Readers asked how they, too, could host a refugee: an 89-year-old 
retired academic put up a friend of Yasser’s.

Burnage Academy <http://www.burnage.manchester.sch.uk>, a boys’ school in 
south Manchester, invited Helen and Yasser to talk to their new-to-English 
students, then offered Yasser the opportunity to volunteer as a classroom 
assistant.Able <http://able-manchester.co.uk>, a private language school, gave 
him 10 hours a week free English tuition for as long as he wants it;Empowering 
Learning <http://www.empowering-learning.com>, a teacher-training consultancy 
in London, offered to sponsor Yasser through his teaching qualifications, so he 
could pick up the career he had so loved back home in Syria.

Yasser moved out in April, when his wife and toddler daughter arrived. They 
are now happily settled in north Manchester. He has a job stewarding for 
Manchester United and at Chester Races, and recently passed his driving test. 
After he left, Helen took in another refugee, a female academic from Damascus. 
She left in August and Helen is enjoying an empty house – for now.

Inside story of a heist

Hatton Garden jewellery heist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/23/one-last-job-inside-story-of-the-hatton-garden-heist>

indeed it was optioned by Working Title Films. Filming plans are now under way,

Mark Smith, a former soldier turned disabled bodybuilder, told Chris 
Stokel-Walker in January why he was planning to compete alongside able-bodied 
men in international contests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/02/pecs-appeal-rise-disabled-bodybuilding-mark-smith>
. But a taster session for strongman training, where participants test their 
strength in challenges with extremely heavy weights, made him want to pursue 
that instead. In May, Smith won a national strongman contest; in August, he 
came sixth in the World’s Strongest Disabled Man competition. Next year, he’s 
aiming to win.

infertility

, they had been trying to conceive their third child for nine months. Myles, 
28, had been told at the age of 21 that, due to an illness he had suffered as a 
baby, he had only a 15% chance of ever having a child, with the likelihood 
greater while he and Erin were young. They had their first, Lucy, when they 
were 22; their second, Norah, two years later. They recently announced Erin is 
pregnant again; the baby is due in May.

<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/02/never-thought-he-wouldnt-come-home-why-son-connor-sparrowhawk-die>
, who drowned in a bath three years ago, aged 18, at a residential unit run by 
Southern Health, an NHS foundation trust. His death eventually led to the 
finding that Southern Health had, between 2011 and 2015, failed properly to 
investigate the deaths of more than 700 people with learning disabilities or 
mental health problems. In August, chief executive Katrina Percy stepped down, 
only to be given a new advisory role. In October,she left Southern Health 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/07/ex-southern-health-boss-katrina-percy-payoff-quitting-advisory-role>
; the trust’s board said public feedback had led it to decide it was “no longer 
possible for her to continue”.

Bangladeshi men trafficked into slavery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/28/slavery-human-trafficking-hotel-workers-bangladesh-scotland>
 in a remote hotel in the Scottish Highlands. In 2008, they were deceived into 
paying thousands of pounds for a visa, only to find themselves doing forced 
labour and abused by their employer, who was later jailed for three years. 
Readersset up a crowdfunding site 
<https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/AbulAzadScottishTraffickingVictims#!> 
to help with legal fees, and raised nearly £12,000 in four weeks. MPs in 
Scotland appealed directly to the Home Office to grant the men the right to 
remain. Last month, despite their being recognised as victims of trafficking 
and having served as key witnesses in the prosecution of their trafficker, 
their applications were rejected. They are now on their final appeal and face 
deportation.

an official function and two firearm offences. His mother, Lynne Sandford, 
revealed that Michael was suicidal. Readers raised more than £10,000 to help 
with his legal bills. This month, he was sentenced to 12 months in prison. 
Judge James Mahan told him: “You have a medical problem. You should not be 
ashamed or embarrassed about it… I don’t think you wanted to kill anybody.” 
Lynne Sandford was hugely touched by the support from readers, saying, “Michael 
passes on his sincerest thanks. I’m glad readers realise that, despite what he 
attempted to do, he’s not a bad person at heart.”

In August, novelist Mary Paulson-Ellis followed the story of Mr Lobban, an 
elderly man who died in Edinburgh with no next-of-kin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/27/solving-mysteries-those-who-die-alone-mr-lobban>
 and an ambiguous identity. Several people who knew him got in touch. Buff 
Hardie, an undergraduate with Mr Lobban at Aberdeen University in the early 
50s, described a young man with “a flawless Oxbridge accent”, often the target 
of a gossip column in the student newspaper.


An email from Douglas Cameron placed Lobban next in Cambridge, a dapper man 
“like a youngDavid Suchet playing Poirot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/nov/10/david-suchet-poirot-and-me>
”, teaching English as a foreign language. The first sighting of him in 
Edinburgh is in the 70s, remembered as someone “well-informed and amusing”, but 
skilled at deflecting questions.

Mr Lobban’s neighbour of 20 years got in touch to say she found him charming, 
though eccentric. He was a divisive figure, especially latterly, when his 
hoarding became extreme. She discovered a Jewish genealogy website detailing 
the fate of his father, Martin Krebs, who died at Auschwitz in 1944. 
Paulson-Ellis says, “It was a thrill to hear from those who knew Mr Lobban – an 
afterlife of sorts for the article and for him.”

Fifty-two matches, various kisses (some more awkward than others) and a 
handful of second dates: Cupid has had a busy year inour Blind date column 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date>. We can happily 
report thatTom and Emily 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/29/blind-date-emily-tom> (29 
October) are still dating, even though he forgot her name the first time. “I’ve 
worn my full hi-vis cycle look in front of him,” Emily says, “and it didn’t put 
him off.”

Michael’s date with Rebecca 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/09/blind-date-rebecca-michael>
 (9 April) also led to a match – with a friend of a friend saw the article and 
got in touch. “I will always remember 2016 as the year when a reckless gamble 
paid off,” Michael says. “So if you’re in two minds, take the plunge.”
