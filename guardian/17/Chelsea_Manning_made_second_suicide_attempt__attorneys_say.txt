Chelsea Manning <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chelsea-manning> 
attempted suicide for the second time in recent months while in prison in 
Kansas for leaking classified information, two of her attorneys said on Friday.

 Attorneys Vincent Ward and Chase Strangio declined to divulge details of 
Manning’s suicide attempt last month at a military prison at Fort Leavenworth 
in Kansas. Wayne Hall, an army spokesman, said medical privacy laws barred him 
from discussing the matter.

But Manning’s attorneys cited her prison conditions – including the solitary 
confinement

 that her legal team says she received as punishment for her July suicide 
attempt – as contributing to their client’s fragile mental state.

Strangio, in an email to the Associated Press, called Manning’s treatment 
since her 2010 arrest and subsequent time serving a 35-year sentence 
“demoralizing and destabilizing assaults on her health and humanity”.

“After her July suicide attempt, I watched her begin to piece her life and 
spirit back together only to have that shattered by the disciplinary 
proceedings brought against her and then the unannounced initiation of her term 
of punishment last month,” Strangio wrote. “She has repeatedly been punished 
for trying to survive and now is being repeatedly punished for trying to die.”

Strangio added he worries about Manning’s “ability to keep fighting under 
these relentless abuses”.

Manning, arrested in 2010 as Bradley Manning, was convicted in 2013 in 
military court of leaking more than 700,000 secret military and state 
department documents to WikiLeaks. Manning was an intelligence analyst in Iraq 
at the time.

In 2014, the ACLU sued the US Department of Defense over its refusal to treat 
Manning’s gender dysphoria.

Manning staged a several-day hunger strike in September until the army agreed 
to get her treatment for her gender dysphoria, including surgery recommended in 
April by her psychologist, the ACLU said.
