He’s almost become the forgotten spinner of Australian cricket, but Fawad 
Ahmed has made sure the Sydney Sixers won’t forget him in a hurry. Leggie Ahmed 
bowled a magical spell to set up Thunder’s eight-wicket win over their local 
Big Bash rivals in front of 39,756 spectators, the biggest crowd for a domestic 
cricket game at the SCG.

Pakistan-born Ahmed hasn’t added to the three ODIs and two T20 internationals 
in Britain in 2013, but is becoming an increasingly influential part of the 
Thunder’s late season BBL charge. Recognising the need to boost their 
tournament run rate, Thunder made light work of an easy target, winning with 10 
overs to spare.

Openers Kurtis Patterson (38 not out off 26 balls) and James Vince (28 off 18) 
blasted 54 off the first 5.1 overs. English import Vince and skipper Shane 
Watson (four off three) were both dismissed by Sean Abbott in the sixth over. 
But Patterson and Ben Rohrer (26 off 13) hurried the visitors to a thumping 
victory.

The only major delay to Thunder’s chase came at the end of the eighth over 
when two streakers cheered up the home supporters and held up the game. The 
interlopers arguably displayed the best moves of the night, even ahead of the 
dab wicket-taking celebrations of Thunder import Carlos Brathwaite, as they had 
numerous security guards driving around.

The Sixers were reasonably placed in their innings at 2-53 in the ninth over, 
when Ahmed triggered a collapse of 6-15. He induced key middle-order hitters 
Nic Maddinson and Moises Henriques to spoon catches off miss-hit strokes from 
successive balls. Ahmed bowled new Sixers import Colin Munro in his next over 
and dismissed Sean Abbott in his last.

Another Thunder import, West Indian Brathwaite (3-21) also got among the 
Sixers, with veteran Brad Haddin one of his victims, while Chris Green and 
Watson both only conceded four an over from their spells. Opener Daniel Hughes 
top scored for the Sixers with 20 and Ben Dwarshuis finished 19 not out, but 
the team managed just six fours and a six.

Thunder move up to fifth on the BBL ladder as a result of the big win. The 
Sixers are third. “It was a complete effort, fielding bowling and 
captaincy-wise,” Brathwaite said.

Thunder’s score of 9-99 was the lowest of this season’s BBL and Ahmed’s 
figures were his best in the T20 from. “I think I got lucky, with a few 
wickets, the batsmen made a few mistakes,” Ahmed said.

Sixers captain Moises Henriques lamented the poor decision making and shot 
selection of his team. “I feel we were just a little bit complacent about 
batting, coming off a couple of really good chases, of 170 and 186,” Henriques 
said. “The last couple of run chases we were able to go out and bat with 
freedom because we had good solid starts, but today we were under the pump a 
little bit, but we still tried to go out and take the game to them all the way 
down.

“We turned it into a 30-over game. There were (close to) 40,000 spectators 
come out and watch and it was disappointing we weren’t able to give them a good 
game of cricket.”’

The emphatic win lifted Thunder’s net run rate above the Sixers, though they 
are two points behind. Both teams face a potential must-win scenario in their 
final match; Sixers away to Melbourne Stars and Thunder at home against 
Adelaide Strikers.
