The BBC iPlayer must be completely re-invented with new technology such as 
artificial intelligence, voice recognition and personalisation if it is to keep 
its lead in online video, director generalTony Hall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/tony-hall> is to tell staff.

In his first major speech under the new BBC charter, and less than 24 hours 
after Sir David Clementiwas confirmed as the new chair of the BBC board 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/10/sir-david-clementi-bbc-chair-unitary-board-trust-bank-of-england>
, Lord Hall will say that the corporation needs to “reinvent public 
broadcasting for a new generation” at a critical juncture for the UK following 
the vote to leave the EU.

As well as improving its technology, Hall will say the BBC must do a better 
job of helping the public understand the news, and ensure its commercial arms, 
BBC Worldwide and the soon-to-be spun offBBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> Studios, contribute to the UK economy.

The iPlayer was not the first video-on-demand service in the UK, but it set 
the standard for online TV globally following its launch in 2007. However, it 
has faced increasing competition from new global players such as Netflix and 
Amazon Instant Video with huge research and development budgets.Netflix in 
particular has led the way on personalisation, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/23/netflix-viewer-data-house-of-cards>
 using machine learning to get better at suggesting programmes based on what 
you have already watched.

Figures from regulator Ofcom published last summer showed that at the end of 
2015iPlayer <https://www.theguardian.com/media/iplayer> was used by almost a 
third of the UK population, ahead of Sky’s TV platform and web-based Netflix, 
both used by 16%.

In his speech, Hall will describe the iPlayer as the corporation’s “biggest 
revolution” of the last 10 years, but said it needed to transform from a 
catchup service into a “must-visit destination in its own right”.

He will say: “Our goal, even in the face of rapid growth by our competitors, 
is for iPlayer to be the number one online TV service in the UK.

“That will mean doubling our reach, and quadrupling the time each person 
spends on it every week. And we want do it by 2020. That’s tough, but I know we 
can do it.”

The BBC is already pushing a single sign in for users, called BBC ID, which 
ties into apps and other services to provide recommendations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/19/bbc-personalisation-app-ties-together-iplayer-and-other-digital-services>
 from across the corporation’s content.

Users do not have to sign in to watch iPlayer, and up until last September a 
TV licence was not required to watch catch-up content. Howeverthe rules were 
changed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/01/bbc-iplayer-tv-licence-iplayer-loophole>
 as part of the corporation’s latest funding agreement with the government.

Hall will also tell staff that the BBC must “do much more to help our 
audiences understand what’s happening in the world today” with “slow news” such 
as in-depth analysis to accompany breaking coverage.

Though improving the iPlayer’s technology would help it stay in competition 
with the US tech firms, it is also facing increased international competition 
for content. Amazon spent a reported £160m for three series ofThe Grand Tour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/18/the-grand-tour-review-jeremy-clarkson-james-may-richard-hammond-leave-the-bbc-in-their-dust>
, starring the BBC’s former Top Gear team, while Netflix spent a reported £100m 
for Queen Elizabeth biopicThe Crown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/04/the-crown-review-netflix-100m-gamble-on-the-queen-pays-off-royally>
.

The corporation is preparing to spin-off the bulk of its in-house production 
capacity as BBC Studios, which will allow it to make shows for other 
broadcasters. BBC Worldwide, which sells BBC content and intellectual property 
overseas, would be crucial in exporting BBC Studios content and providing more 
money for programming.

Hall will add: “I don’t want us just to be brilliant at making high-quality, 
distinctive British programmes, I want us to be truly brilliant at exporting 
them across the globe.”

“That’s why we need BBC Worldwide to thrive as a strategic partner for BBC 
Studios, making the very most of our global reach. My challenge to Worldwide is 
to look again at how we best grow our business to deliver more returns back to 
BBC public service – to reinvest in yet more great British programmes and 
services.”
