<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/glasgow>.

The accident happened at about 3.15pm on Monday at Dalness Street, 
Shettleston, in the east end of the city.

The boy was “seriously injured” after being struck by a white Ford Transit van.

He was taken by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth University hospital where he 
died a short time later.

Sgt Jackie Dunbar said: “From our inquiries so far, it would appear that the 
boy, a pupil at St Paul’s (Shettleston) primary school on Anwoth Street, 
Glasgow, was struck by the van, which had come into Dalness Street from 
Tollcross Road, as it turned into a car park on Dalness Street.

“It was picking-up time at the school and there were a number of people in the 
area at the time of the incident.

“I would ask anyone who saw what happened, and who has not already been spoken 
to by police, to contact officers.”

Dalness Street was closed at Dalness Close to allow officers to carry out 
their investigations with local diversions in place.

A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal. 

Anyone with information can contact police via 101 or alternatively through 
Crimestoppers where information can be given anonymously.
