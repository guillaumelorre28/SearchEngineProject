I have received a series of unsolicited text messages on my mobile phone over 
recent months concerning an Aqua Reward credit card application I have not 
made. I’ve ignored them as a presumed scam and would appreciate your advice as 
to whether this is indeed the correct thing to do, or whether I should report 
it.

The messages initially told me not to forget to activate my card. Another 
warned that a £127 payment would soon be taken by direct debit. As far as I 
know I’ve never signed anything from this company requesting a card or other 
service. And I haven’t received a card or any paperwork in the post.SC, by email

We suspect that someone filling in a credit card application – or someone at 
the company – has mis-typed in the mobile number and as a result you are 
getting someone else’s texts. However, given the high rate of fraudulent credit 
card applications it is worth keeping a vigilant eye on your bank statements, 
which will be easy as the texts say when the payments were to be taken.

Equally, there is nothing to stop you calling Aqua to ask why it keeps sending 
you the texts. While that probably won’t be a short call, it might be prudent.
