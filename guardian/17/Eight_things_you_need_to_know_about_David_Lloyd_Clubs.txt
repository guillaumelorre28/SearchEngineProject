It all started with tennis
Inspired by time spent coaching in Canada, former British Davis Cup captain 
David Lloyd opened his first club in Hounslow, West London, in 1982. There are 
now 83 David Lloyd Clubs across the UK, boasting the world’s largest number of 
qualified coaches, as well as 850 match-quality courts – both indoors and 
outdoors.

But it’s so much more than tennis
David Lloyd Clubs offer a raft of other racquet sports including badminton 
(nearly 200 courts), squash (almost 150 courts), and Padel (a super-fast 
variety of doubles tennis played in an enclosed court, which originated in 
Mexico). With more than 30 years of experience of serving up this variety of 
disciplines, members can enjoy expert coaching and incredible courts. Some 
12,500 children are taught racquet sports at David Lloyd Clubs every week, and 
members can quickly book courts in advance with the David Lloyd Clubs app, too.

Power of the pool
Away from the courts, swimming is a great low-impact workout option for those 
looking to feel slimmer, stronger, more flexible and less stressed. David Lloyd 
Clubs have both indoor and outdoor pools at a majority of their venues.

A unique way to work out
David Lloyd Clubs aim to keep workouts interesting and offer a brand new type 
of gym that integrates every possible kind of training in a friendly, open-plan 
layout. It’s divided into specialised zones – areas for cardio, free weights, 
functional training and more. Further, there is an impressive range of 
equipment and plenty of it, too – so members will never have to wait for a turn.

Getting personal (training)
In addition to access to first-class gym equipment (and an unbeatable range of 
classes – more of which below), David Lloyd Clubs members are encouraged to 
make the most of carefully selected personal trainers. They are approachable 
and friendly, but also aim to push and motivate members, whether running 
functional training and gym-floor classes or providing one-to-one sessions.

Healthy in numbers
Group exercise, and working out with other people, has been proven to be a 
good way to retain motivation – and make new friends, too. David Lloyd Clubs 
serve up a wide range of group exercise classes, making use of the superb 
equipment and instructors available, ensuring members get the most out of each 
and every session. There are studios for different types of exercise, including 
mind and body (holistic classes like yoga and pilates), group cycling, and high 
impact (interval training, circuit training and martial arts).

Kids are (more-than) alright
If you want your children to stay active, members are encouraged to sign their 
little ones up to the DL Kids programme, which carefully times the sessions to 
match up with group exercise classes – so adults can work out while the 
youngsters play a sport, some games or have fun in an arts and crafts class. 
And then there’s the All Stars programmes, which gradually teach children ways 
to improve and progress in certain sports, while having lots of fun along the 
way. Small children can be cared for by fully qualified creche staff.
