“It’s the increasing numbers that shocks people,” says Lily Axworthy, 25, from 
theGreater Manchester Winter Night Shelter <https://gmwns.wordpress.com/> 
(GMWNS). “I walk to work and see eight or nine people sleeping in doorways. 
There’s people sleeping in the car park where I leave my car. And that’s only 
what you can see. People are under bridges, in parks, in tents.”

The story of GMWNS – set up by Lily, a charity worker, in 2015 – could be a 
snapshot of poverty in modern Britain. The scale is spiralling, austerity has 
fostered it, and – miles away from ministers in Westminster – it’s a team of 
volunteers left to pick up the pieces.

In January, the shelter ran as a small pilot project to help a few dozen 
street sleepers. “The need was obvious,” Lily says simply – and six weeks ago, 
the shelter began a six-month stretch to get hundreds of people through the 
cold weather.

GMWNS gets no statutory funding. All money comes from charity, grants and the 
public (even the camp beds are donated), and it is staffed by volunteers – 
almost 200 of them: nurses, solicitors, teachers, students and ex-street 
sleepers.

The shelter itself is seven different “donated” venues – mainly churches – 
that open nightly on rotation through the week (it keeps costs and red tape 
down). Twelve beds are set up in each of them. Lily knows that’s nowhere near 
enough for the number of rough sleepers inManchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester>. “But it’s 12 more than there would 
be otherwise,” she says.

The youngest men they see are in their early 20s (“With the cuts to housing 
benefit, I think we’ll get more soon,” Lily says) but ages range up to late 
60s. “They’re waiting for the pensions, hoping that will be some income,” she 
says.

What hits hard is that the men coming to the winter shelter aren’t people who 
have been homeless for 10 or 20 years. It’s that so many are new now. As Lily 
puts it: “They never thought in a million years they’d be homeless.”

Few give details about why they’re here. Embarrassment and shame are common. 
“They say ‘I’ve fallen on hard times’,” Lily says. “The thing is, the welfare 
system is designed for hard times. And it’s not functioning now.” Many she sees 
have been hit by benefit and housing problems, high private rents (“they’re 
evicted for rent arrears and can’t afford anywhere else”), relationship 
breakdown and the lack of social housing.

At the same time as it’s becoming harder for people to keep a roof over their 
head, the services that once would have helped them – debt advice, mental 
health centres or mediation support (be it between landlords and tenants or 
families) – have been cut as well. “They just don’t exist any more,” Lily says. 
“Your local Citizens Advice isn’t there so you have to go to a neighbouring 
city, but there’s twice as many people queuing who need help.”

It fell several degrees below freezing in Manchester twice last week, and 
local charities and the council are now focused on finding ways to get rough 
sleepers inside. There are no state-run shelters in the city, and temporary 
accommodation services are full. Instead, outreach workers are now using 
communal spaces of sheltered accommodation to house people for the night: 
living rooms, sofas, wherever they can fit. “Just to keep people alive,” Lily 
says.

This is Britain’s homelessness crisis: where a cocktail of cuts is 
simultaneously swelling the numbers of street sleepers while giving them, in 
Lily’s words, “nowhere to go”.More than a quarter of a million people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/01/shelter-homelessness-england-charity-poverty-social-housing>
 in England are now homeless, according to figures by Shelter this month. In 
the last fortnight, three rough sleepers have died – two of the men were found 
in aderelict building in Manchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/04/rough-sleeper-numbers-homeless>
, the other in hissleeping bag in a Birmingham car park

.

The nights are only going to get colder and Lily tells me that, as it is, 
GMWNS is already full every night. Despite the strain, its aim is always to 
provide “more than a bed”. That means practical help: a local charity,the Booth 
Centre <http://www.boothcentre.org.uk/about-the-booth-centre.html>, gives out 
benefit advice and housing support, and in turn refers its own users to the 
shelter. It offers little human touches too: volunteers greet whoever comes to 
the shelter with a cup of tea, and everyone eats a meal together.

As we finish talking, Lily is planning Christmas gifts for anyone who needs 
the shelter over the holiday. She has just helped two men get a bed for the 
night. Both are middle-aged and have worked all their lives. They lost their 
jobs a while ago, and without enough savings to get by, they started to sleep 
on the street. Neither of their families know they’re homeless now, she says. 
They don’t want to burden them.

“It makes you realise this can happen to anyone,” Lily says. “We’re all one 
pay cheque away from it.”
