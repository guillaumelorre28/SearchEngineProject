1 Rae Sremmurd

Mixing the youthful energy of Kriss Kross (who could have predicted we’d be 
using that reference in 2017?) with the beguiling DayGlo weirdness of much 
modern hip-hop, it was only fitting thatRae Sremmurd’s Black Beatles 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/black-beatles-inside-rae-sremmurds-unlikely-smash-w458849>
 should soundtrack last year’s oddest craze:the mannequin challenge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2016/nov/07/the-mannequin-challenge-like-the-harlem-shake-but-stationary>
. Go wild – or stand still – when they hit the UK this week.

2 AJ Tracey

It seems the days when your parents were terminally uncool are over: this west 
London MC’s dad was a rapper, while his mum was a pirate radio DJ. Happily, 
musical talent appears to have been passed down the genetic line. Thiago Silva, 
AJ Tracey’s collaboration withfellow rapper Dave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/02/five-of-the-best-rock-pop-gigs>
, wasone of the Guardian’s top tracks of 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/dec/19/best-track-of-2016-work-by-rihanna>
 and helped make him one of several artists livening up this year’s tip lists.

3 Laura Marling

Before a full UK tour in March, Laura Marling is teaming up with the Scottish 
Symphony Orchestra 
<http://www.celticconnections.com/events/Pages/event.aspx?ev=3c9af5b1-7ea5-4061-9560-a6a600c01091>
 for her debut appearance at Celtic Connections festival. The 26-year-old has 
folkie roots, of course, and this will be a chance to hear those explored and 
reinterpreted with an orchestral makeover.
Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, Thursday 19 Jan

4 JoJo

Owing to tedious contractual wrangles, 00s pop-R&B singer JoJo has ended up 
putting out gently experimental mixtapes rather than proper albums for several 
years. This changed with 2016’sMad Love 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/16/jojo-mad-love-review>, and 
she’ll be attempting to revitalise her career with an accompanying tour.
The Academy, Dublin, Sunday 15 Jan <http://www.theacademydublin.com/>; Koko,

5 Beach Slang

“Play it loud, play it fast,” is the opening line on Beach Slang 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/17/james-alex-and-philadelphia-punks-beach-slang>
’s latest album,A Loud Bash Of Teenage Feelings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/22/beach-slang-a-loud-bash-of-teenage-feelings-review-album>
, and it’s advice they seem to have taken on board themselves. The 
Pennsylvanian band’s big, earnest US college rock is responsible for some of 
the most riotous shows around at the moment.
