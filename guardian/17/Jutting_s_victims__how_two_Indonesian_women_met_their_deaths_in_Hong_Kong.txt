Like millions of Indonesian women, Sumarti Ningsih travelled thousands of 
miles from her village in the hopes of providing much-needed extra income for 
her family back home.


What set her apart was not the long hours or back-breaking work as a maid she 
endured in a systemsome say amounts to modern-day slavery

 – along with another woman, Seneng Mujiasih – at the hands of Rurik Jutting, a 
Cambridge-educated British banker.

Rurik Jutting guilty of murder of two Indonesian women in Hong Kong

Now, two years after the killings, a jury has unanimously found Jutting guilty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/rurik-jutting-guilty-murder-indonesian-women-hong-kong>
 of the murders of both women.

Both women first came to Hong Kong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong> as domestic helpers. For 
Ningsih’s family, in Cilacap, Central Java, having a daughter working in a 
far-off city never to return was all too familiar. In 2008, her older sister 
went to work as a domestic helper in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta. Shortly after 
she arrived, she disappeared and has never been seen since.

That was the same year Ningsih married at 17. Her son was born less than a 
year later after her husband left just before the baby’s birth. She would be 
dead at 23.

For her family at home, supporting six people on just $70 (£56) a month from 
rice farming became increasingly difficult, and by the time Ningsih was 
murdered she was sending her family nearly four times that amount.

Although she called her family every day, her son was too young to sit for 
long conversations and barely knew the woman on the other end of the phone. He 
was only five years old when she was killed.

“Her son never really knew what it meant to have a mother,” Suyitno, Ningsih’s 
older brother, tells the Guardian. “He knows this woman is dead, that she was 
murdered, but doesn’t fully understand who she is in relation to him.”

Roughly half <http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat/sub/gender/labour_force/> of 
Hong Kong’s 340,000 live-in maids are from Indonesia, surviving on just 
HK$4,000 (£415) a month.

Desperate situations are common among migrants in the city 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/mar/14/forced-labour-common-among-hong-kongs-domestic-helpers-study-finds>
. The agencies that bring the women from Indonesia and the Philippines levy 
high fees, often in the form of debt, and their entire lives are dictated by 
their employer. Their lives are worlds away from the expat bankers and even the
Hong Kong <https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong> families that hire them.

Both Ningsih and Mujiasih worked as maids before losing their jobs. Finding 
new work often means months of waiting, a new round of agency fees and a 
requirement they first leave Hong Kong.

“Anyone can fall into the situation of these two women if they are desperate 
enough, but no one comes willingly to do sex work,” says Eni Lestari, chair of 
theInternational Migrants Alliance <https://wearemigrants.net/>. “We are 
confined to a certain box where we can only do a few jobs.”

The laws governing domestic workers, Lestari adds, mean: “Hong Kong is a place 
where modern-day slavery is actually promoted.”

Once the two women lost their jobs, finding new work was necessary to survive. 
Ningsih first went back toIndonesia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/indonesia>, studying to become a DJ, before 
returning to Hong Kong to work as a waitress, her family says.

Mujiasih, also known as Jesse Lorena, from Muna, in Indonesia’s southeast 
Sulawesi province, overstayed her visa and worked odd jobs. Her gradual slide 
into occasional sex work happened over a period of months, friends say.

“Everyone thinks her life was sex, drugs and rock and roll, and it’s not like 
that, it’s really not,” says Rob Van Den Bosch, a friend of Mujiasih’s and 
entertainment manager at the Queen Victoria pub.

“It became a tool for survival and also a mindset in her head: ‘If I do this, 
I can really have a future – I can leave Hong Kong and have all the money I 
need.’”

Van Den Bosch met Mujiasih through an ex-girlfriend and saw her almost every 
Sunday for about three years.

“She was a strong, nice, gentle and friendly woman,” he says. “She was really 
alive, but that is all gone now.”

Despite the killings, which grabbed headlines around the world, there is 
little sign anything has changed in the area.

The Wan Chai neighbourhood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/05/plight-of-hong-kong-sex-workers> 
where Jutting met the two women is a collection of contradictions. Part 
red-light district, part moneyed playground, so-called girlie bars line the 
notorious Lockhart Road, while down the street rich workers sip expensive 
cocktails, all a stone’s throw away from traditional wonton noodle shops.

Mama-sans sit on stools above miniature shrines built into the façade of 
nearly every girlie bar, filling the air with the smell of burning incense.

At the New Makati pub and disco, the last place Mujiasih was seen alive, Yadi, 
28, explains a typical night.

“I start here, then have two other bars I go to, and I have many boyfriends at 
each one,” she says, as sped-up renditions of year-old pop music blare in the 
background. “Hong Kong is exhausting, but working here is the only way I can 
ever afford to build a house and live a better life.”

She is originally from a village outside the Indonesian port city of Surabaya, 
and came to Hong Kong this time on an “entertainment visa”. She belts out a few 
lines of Adele’s Someone Like You; the only point in the entire evening Yadi 
looks truly happy is when she sings.

But she admits there are few opportunities for her to perform, and that those 
are mainly to fulfill the conditions of her visa. She complains that wages for 
domestic helpers were too low, and not enough to support her parents, two young 
sisters as well as her brother’s young family.


“I’m planning to go back home next year. I’ll have enough money by then,” she 
says, a common refrain among the women working in Wan Chai.

As Yadi heads to the next bar, she passes a currency exchange window on the 
corner lit up like a capitalist Christmas tree, where a stream of older white 
men hand over notes from around the world, quickly changed into Hong Kong 
dollars to be spent at nearby bars.

Just around the corner a Western Union branch prominently displays exchange 
rates for Filipino and Indonesian currencies, transmitting the wages earned 
down the street to families back home.


Jutting’s apartment was just a five-minute walk from this road, in one of the 
area’s most expensive addresses. He has spent the past two years in prison on 
the edge of the city.

Ningsih’s family hasn’t followed the news of the trial closely – they say it’s 
too painful – but they want to know the verdict and sentence in the murder 
case. Jutting was not separately charged with rape or torture, and the family 
is also mulling filing a civil suit against him.

“We want to sue, but even if we are given US$100,000, any amount won’t be 
enough for Jutting to pay for what he did and it will never bring Sumarti back 
to us,” her brother Suyitno says.

He wants to leave the village to earn a better salary in a nearby city, but 
his parents fear losing a third child to an unfamiliar place.

Villagers in Ningsih’s hometown have watched the case with a sense of worry 
that the Hong Kong court would fail to deliver the justice they seek.

“Everyone here was very shocked and angry and they all hate Rurik,” Suyitno 
said. “Some were so angry they said: ‘Bring this man to our village, we will 
kill him together.’”
