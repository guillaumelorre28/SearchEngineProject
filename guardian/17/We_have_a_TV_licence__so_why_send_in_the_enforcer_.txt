For a number of months we been threatened with an enforcement investigation by 
TV Licensing, despite having a valid licence since 2010.

Even though we received a letter in November acknowledging that we do have a 
licence, it is still threatening us with an imminent visit “to find out if a TV 
is being watched, recorded or downloaded illegally”.

We get relatively few complaints about TV Licensing, and most of those we do 
receive seem to be from people without TVs who can’t persuade the authorities 
that they don’t have a set.

Happily, your error was easily resolved. A duplicate address has now been 
removed from the database and the threatening letters will stop. TV Licensing 
is writing to apologise.

We welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at
