Fees £1,820 for home/EU students on campus-based courses in 2016-17. Fees for 
rest of UK and international students vary by programme and level. Visit

 If you are a first degree student and ordinarily resident in Scotland, you 
are eligible for your tuition fees to be covered by the Scottish government. If 
you are from elsewhere in the EU (not the rest of the UK) you are entitled to 
be charged the same level of tuition fees as Scottish students.


Bursaries Scottish students benefit from a range of support from the Scottish 
executive and SRUC has a limited means-tested centenary bursary available. It 
also has up to three honours-year bursaries available to successful 
participants in the SRUC trust traineeship scheme. Visit
