The Bank of England’s chief economist has admitted his profession is in crisis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/05/chief-economist-of-bank-of-england-admits-errors>
 having failed to foresee the 2008 financial crash and having misjudged the 
impact of the Brexit vote. Andy Haldane said it was “a fair cop” referring to a 
series of forecasting errors before and after the financial crash which had 
brought the profession’s reputation into question.

So what can the dismal science do to regain the trust of the public and 
politicians?

Chief economist of Bank of England admits errors in Brexit forecasting

1. Be more transparent

Michael Gove, the former justice secretary and Brexit campaigner, said last 
week his criticism of experts was that they made claims about the impact of 
policy changes without revealing their forecasting assumptions.

Economists were top of his list, especially those in the big institutions that 
predicted the economy would fall off a cliff after a Brexit vote and were then 
proved wrong.

The Treasury was a particular culprit and is in the line of fire again. It was 
accused of shielding its calculations about the economy by Graham Gudgin from 
the Centre for Business Research at the University of Cambridge. He said his 
team’s attempt to replicate the Treasury forecast had failed for lack of detail 
and cited the various failed attempts, not just by his team, but by journalists 
and academics to prise the information from Whitehall as the main reason.

 The2008 crash was economists’ Michael Fish moment, says chief economist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2017/jan/06/2008-crash-was-economists-michael-fish-moment-says-chief-economist-video>
There is a degree of transparency in the way City economists view the next 12 
months and the assumptions they make. Under pressure from their clients, they 
spell out how they judge the activity in various parts of the economy and what 
is important and what isn’t.


But the actual calculations behind the forecasts are commercially sensitive 
and closely guarded by the economists’ employers – the banks.

2. Take human behaviour into account

Economic forecasters like to plug things into models and see what comes out. 
As Haldane said, those models have failed to cope with “irrational behaviour” 
in the modern era.

To use a simple example, economists forecasting the impact of a vote for 
Brexit forecast the sudden change in the UK’s political outlook and uncertainty 
around its future trading relationships would spook consumers and investors. 
That, they said, could knock consumer spending, hit share prices and send house 
prices lower as people stopped shopping, investing and making big decisions 
such as moving house.

That was one way things could pan out, but in reality, people are individuals 
and just because they behaved one way in the past, they won’t necessarily do 
the same in the future, especially as the nature of the economy and the labour 
market changes. So after the referendum, some people perhaps decided that if 
prices were going to go up because of the weak pound, it was better to buy 
things now. Some read the news and couldn’t decide if Brexit really meant 
Brexit and so kept spending regardless. Some – presumably a large portion of 
those who voted out – saw Brexit as a positive. Others possibly felt the 
outlook was uncertain but day to day were more swayed in their shopping habits 
by special offers and the weather.

In other words, humans are humans and economic models will always struggle to 
predict their behaviour. Of course, surveys help get a gauge on how people are 
feeling and forecasters like theBank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor> keep a close eye 
on consumer confidence reports and polls of businesses. But people’s feelings 
change. In short, we can look to economics to give us best guesses of how 
changes might affect people but should not take them as cast iron predictions.

3. Be less certain

Officials inside the Treasury have faced criticism for predicting a technical 
recession in the second half of the year without factoring in policy changes by 
the government in reaction to the Brexit vote (which should be easy when it is 
the Treasury itself that makes the changes) and the Bank of England, which 
could, and did, have a huge impact.

Philip Hammond, who took over from George Osborne, said he would relax his 
predecessor’s policy of austerity. The Bank of England cut interest rates and 
boosted its stimulus package by £60bn to £435bn. Both moves reassured consumers 
and the stock market.

Neither possible action was apparently taken into account by the Treasury, or 
seemingly by other eminent forecasters, including the IMF and the OECD.

4. Change our education system

One for the government rather than the economics profession, but it’s 
certainly something it should lobby on. Rather than lambasting experts, Gove 
and his like would do well to shake up the UK education system so that people 
leave school better equipped to make their own judgments about economic 
forecasts, the financial system and the government’s tax and spending decisions.

Financial education has become part of the secondary school curriculum in 
England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/22/lessons-in-finance-british-schoolchildren>
 and budgeting and public spending are now taught in citizenship. But critics 
say the topic is squeezed into an already packed timetable and they point out 
there are no compulsory financial lessons for anyone over 16 when they are 
about to make big financial decisions, and will soon be able to vote.

5. Shake up economics teaching

There is a movement inside universities to move away from a purely 
mathematical view of the economy. Students have become increasingly uneasy with 
the focus on equations to judge how the economy operates. Equations are 
expected to balance, but according to Steve Keen, professor of economics at 
Kingston University, they often don’t, especially in the economies worst hit by 
the financial crash.

There is also a lack of economic history teaching, which would illustrate how 
economics has been here before, in the 1930s, when the excesses of the 1920s 
defied their models of economic behaviour and left them floundering in the 
subsequent decade until John Maynard Keynes grabbed the spotlight.

Few students will be given a grounding in different ways of looking at 
economic behaviour and especially Marxist interpretations, which are deemed to 
be simplistic and unable to cope with the complexities of modern capitalism.
