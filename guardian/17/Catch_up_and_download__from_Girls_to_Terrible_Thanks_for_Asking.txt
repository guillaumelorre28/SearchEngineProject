Girls
Lena Dunham’s state-of-the-millennial-nation series will go from Girls to gone 
Girls this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/07/goodbye-girls-lena-dunham-hbo-comedy-bows-out-in-2017>
, when its final season airs in February. For those yet to be acquainted with 
Dunham’s divisive creation Hannah Horvath, as well as her equally lost 
twentysomething pals Marnie, Jessa and Shoshanna, Sky has uploaded the show’s 
entire run to date on to its box sets service. For all the criticisms levelled 
at the show, it remains groundbreaking, inspiring a host of similarly minded 
dramedies, fromLouie

Acquitted
Norway’s biggest TV drama 
<http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/acquitted-becomes-norways-biggest-tv-drama-hit-1201445109/>
 arrives to nuzzle its way into a UK schedule hardly lacking in fjord-focused 
series. Nevertheless, the setup sets it apart from the flock: 20 years after 
being acquitted of the murder of his girlfriend, besuited – and, it has to be 
said, devilishly handsome – businessman Asken Borgen (no relation) returns to 
his home town to save it from economic ruin. There, his past inevitably catches 
up with him, as new and deadly events unfold. Intelligent and intriguing drama.

clear of villainy for the time being. Yet here he is rocking up as a monstrous 
mobster in this series, which he also co-created.Sneaky Pete

<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000610/> as Marius, a ex con forced to assume the 
identity of his cellmate Pete when Vince (Cranston) comes looking for the 
$100,000 Marius owes him. Cue a blackly funny crime saga that shares more than 
a little stylistically with – you guessed it –Breaking Bad

Tourettes: They Still Can’t Help It
Documentary catching up with John Davidson, a man with Tourette syndrome who 
was first profiled in the groundbreaking 1989 filmJohn’s Not Mad 
<http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xseenh_john-s-not-mad_shortfilms>. In the 
years since, Davidson has sought to help younger people with the syndrome by 
running a Tourette Camp, where attendees, including 12-year-old Rory Brown 
(also featured here) are able to make noises without offending members of the 
public. Given thatonly 10% of those with Tourette syndrome have coprolalia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/29/challenging-stereotypes-about-tourette-syndrome>
, the specific term for swearing tics, TV’s outsized focus on this aspect of 
the condition is rather telling. Yet past documentaries featuring Davidson have 
been notable for their insight and sensitivity. Hopefully this should continue 
the trend.

Terrible Thanks For Asking
Dubbed “podcasting’s first real-life weepie”, Nora McInerny’s new weekly pod 
is a stark look at loss, starting with her account of her partner’s death as a 
result of brain cancer. Later episodes profile others who have suffered moments 
of trauma, includinga nurse who received a brain injury from a patient 
<https://www.apmpodcasts.org/ttfa/2016/12/help-me-remember/>, to an expectant 
mother who suffered a miscarriage 
<https://www.apmpodcasts.org/ttfa/2017/01/a-henry-sky/>. It’s tough stuff, but 
the honesty of both McInerny and her interviewees is refreshing.
