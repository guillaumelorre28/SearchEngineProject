It seems cash is no longer king. Technological advances have seen a marked 
rise in electronic and contactless payment options that are rapidly moving us 
towards a cashless society.

In the not-so-distant future, physical notes and coins could be obsolete as 
fast and convenient tap-and-go card payments and tap-and-pay phone apps take 
their place.

In fact, according to Jonah Cretser-Hartenstein, manager of digital innovation 
and emerging channels at ING DIRECT Australia, it is not a question of if we go 
cashless but when.

“The move away from cash is inevitable,” he says. “As technology allows us to 
be able to increase our mobile and digital transactions, the relevance of cash 
will start to fade. People will no longer want or need to carry wads of cash 
around.

“And while I don’t think Australia will necessarily be the first [country to 
go cashless], we are massive adopters of technology. The uptake of contactless 
payments [such as Visa payWave and MasterCard PayPass] was one of if not the 
fastest and most pervasive uptakes globally. It’s still relatively early days 
for mobile phone payments, but if it’s anything like contactless payments, it 
will be a huge success.

“Globally we will be cashless one day, and technologies that support the move 
from physical to digital, Bitcoin for example, will only hasten this 
transition.”

A report published in the International Journal of Electronic Business 
estimates that it could be as soon as the next five to 10 years that we see the 
demise of “real” money. But whatever the time frame, what will the lack of 
physical cash mean for the way we spend and think about money?

According to Dr Paul Harrington, director of the Centre for Organisational 
Health and Consumer Wellbeing at Deakin University, living in a cashless 
society will require a shift in mindset for many people.

“There’s a huge amount of psychology around money,” he says. “And research 
tells us that people have a different response to handing over cash as opposed 
to handing over a card, whether it be a debit or credit card.

“Paying for something in cash elicits greater psychological pain than other 
modes of payment. It couples an immediate loss of available money with a 
purchase. Whereas paying with a credit card or mobile app gives consumers a 
buffer zone between the purchase and the loss of their money.”

The upshot, Dr Harrington says, is that people may be more likely to spend 
more money when using a cash-free payment method.

Research is in its infancy, but it shows that we tend to spend more readily 
and easily using cards than we do with cash.

“The research is in its infancy, but it shows that we tend to spend more 
readily and easily using cards than we do with cash. It’s tricky because 
humans, both from an evolutionary and cultural perspective, have a desire to 
consume. The easier it is to consume – whether that be food, products or 
services – the more likely we are to respond to it.”

To counter this, Dr Harrington suggests we consider “conscious spending”. 
“It’s a little like conscious eating – we will need to think a little bit more 
about what we are spending our money on.”

However, Cretser-Hartenstein says the flipside is that while mobile and 
electronic banking makes spending money easier for consumers, it also 
streamlines budgeting and saving.

“Yes, there’s the potential of an opening of the floodgates in terms of 
impulse buying. However, that said, I think we are also getting better in 
delivering a more transparent and empowering service through digital 
interaction. While I know how much is in my pocket, in the past I didn’t always 
know exactly how much was left in my bank, whereas now I have that front and 
centre. And I can manage and access my accounts from almost anywhere.

“For example, you now have the availability to check your bank balance without 
even logging into our mobile phone app. You can simply swipe down on the 
notifications section in iOS or look at your widget in Android and see 
immediately exactly how much money is available and what your spending limit is.

“So we are coming at it from two angles – from one side, yes it’s more 
convenient and potentially easier to spend, but we are also giving people the 
tools to have more control and transparency of their finances.”

According to the Reserve Bank of Australia, cash transactions have dropped 
from nearly 70 per cent in 2007 to 47 per in 2013. The ING International Survey 
on Mobile Banking earlier this year also reflects a decrease in cash 
transactions, revealing that 53 per cent of Australians say they use physical 
cash much less than they did 12 months ago.

This trend is set to continue, despite some initial concerns regarding the 
safety of cashless payments. In fact, with improved technologies, mobile phone 
payment apps actually offer better protection, with fingerprint scanning and 
voice recognition replacing signatures and PINs.

“When it comes to new payment capabilities, there’s a little bit of the 
unknown so initially there can be some fears or concerns about security,” 
Cretser-Hartenstein says. “But once people use them, their fears are usually 
allayed. In fact, mobile phone apps offer a step up on the security around 
contactless payments. If you lose your phone you can shut it down. You can’t do 
that with cash. You also have to authenticate yourself biometrically before you 
can make any transactions, which adds another layer of security to mobile phone 
payments.”

Ultimately, the move towards a cashless society is inevitable, with 
contactless payments offering fast, convenient and safe transactions that can 
be made anywhere, anytime.

“At the end of the day, people value their time,” Cretser-Hartenstein says. 
“And physical cash has no real value in itself. So if I can do something five 
times faster, more easily and more securely than I could before, then I will. 
Those are the types of things that are going to drive mass adoption.”
