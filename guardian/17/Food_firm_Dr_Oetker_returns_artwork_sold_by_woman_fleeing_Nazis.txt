The German food company Dr Oetker, best known for its baking powders, cake 
mixes and pizzas, has said it will return an artwork to the heirs of the former 
Jewish owner who was forced to flee NaziGermany

The decision to restitute the work, a lithograph by Hans Thoma called Spring 
in the Mountains (Frühling im Gebirge/Kinderreigen) follows an audit of the 
company’s art collection which aimed to discover whether any of the works were 
looted by the Nazis.

The work had been in the possession of Hedwig Ullmann, who fled Nazi Germany 
in 1938 and was forced to sell her art collection. Rudolf-August Oetker, the 
grandson of the Oetker empire’s founder, bought the work at auction in 1954.


Ullmann’s heirs had no idea what had happened to the artwork until they were 
contacted by Dr Oetker, who informed them that the company wished to return it 
for “moral reasons”.

The heirs’ New York-based lawyer, David J Rowland, described the decision as 
exemplary.

“This is an outstanding example of a private company doing the right thing 
with regards toNazi-looted art

 and sets a standard of best practice in this field,” he said. The decision 
abides by the internationalWashington principles 
<https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/hlcst/122038.htm> – a set of rules which 
usually only apply to public galleries that govern the return of looted 
artworks or financial compensation.

Thoma, who was born in the Black Forest in southern Germany in 1839 and died 
in 1924, started out as a painter of clock faces and built a reputation for his 
depictions of rural life.

The Oetker collection was largely assembled by Rudolf-August, who died in 2007.

Dr Oetker announced in 2015 that it had commissioned a provenance researcher 
to investigate the collection on the back of a study it published detailing the 
company’s history during the Third Reich.

Three other objects in the collection have been identified as possible 
Nazi-looted artworks. Dr Oetker spokesman Jörg Schillinger told German media 
that once their provenance was clear, those works would also be returned in the 
near future.

The company, which has an annual revenue of about £8.9bn and employs more than 
30,000 staff, is probably best known for the instant cake mix it started 
selling in 1891, the year the company was founded.
