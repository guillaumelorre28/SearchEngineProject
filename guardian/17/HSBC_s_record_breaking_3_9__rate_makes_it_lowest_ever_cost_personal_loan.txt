HSBC has launched a personal loan at 3.9% – the lowest rate ever charged – 
sparking a price war among providers.
The 3.9% rate will apply to loans between £7,000 and £15,000, with repayments 
spread over one to five years. The rate is even lower than the 4.29% HSBC 
charges first-time buyers for its standard two-year fixed-rate mortgage.
Sylvia Waycot, editor at data provider Moneyfacts, confirmed that the deal "is 
the lowest rate ever recorded on Moneyfacts". It smashes the previous 
lowest-rate personal loans, which have charged around 5% interest.
HSBC's move has sparked a price war among loan providers. Tesco almost 
immediately cut its cheapest loans from 4.5% to 4.1% – although that still 
leaves it pricier than HSBC.
For a five-year HSBC loan of £7,000, monthly repayments will be £128.40. For 
£15,000, repayments will be £275.14.
So what's the catch? HSBC said the deal is for existing customers only – but 
added that it had a total of 16.1 million customers in the UK, about one in 
four of the population.
Many applicants for "best-buy" loans are rebuffed because they don't meet the 
bank's credit-scoring criteria. But under credit rules, an advertised interest 
rate must be given to at least 51% of applicants accepted for loans.
According to Moneyfacts, applicants for loans whose credit score is rated as 
"fair" rather than "good" are offered deals at far worse rates. It says 
Everyday Loans offers finance to those on a "fair" credit score at 37.1% 
interest.
The HSBC loans will appeal most to car buyers, but homeowners may prefer an 
HSBC personal loan to a mortgage extension to finance improvements.
