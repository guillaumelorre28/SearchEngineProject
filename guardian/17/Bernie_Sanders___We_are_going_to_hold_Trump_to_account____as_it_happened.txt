Today in post-campaign 2016

Presidential Transition Team, exits Trump Tower. Photograph: Eduardo

 * Donald Trump renewed his fight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/donald-trump-media-new-york-times-tweets>
 with the American media, criticizing the New York Times, ducking reporters to 
visit a restaurant and turning to Twitter as a means of direct communication. 
The US president-elect even appeared to allude to his reality TV show The 
Apprentice as he denied reports that his transition process is in turmoil and 
plagued by infighting. 
 * Trump waged an unprecedented one-man war against the media during his 
election campaign, banning some organizations from his rallies and regularly 
inciting his supporters to boo and jeer reporters. He used Twitter, on which he 
has more than 15 million followers, to berate his critics and throw out often 
incendiary statements.

 * Tom Hanks has spoken out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/16/tom-hanks-us-election-donald-trump-president>
 about the results of the election, reassuring people that the US has seen 
difficult times before and is still “the greatest country in the world.” 
 * “We are going to be all right,” he said, according to Vulture. “America has 
been in worse places than we are at right now.” He went on to praise the 
constitution, saying: “That document is going to protect us, over and over 
again, whether or not our neighbors preserve and protect and defend it 
themselves.” 
 * Senate Democrats today elected Chuck Schumer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/chuck-schumer-senate-democrats-elect-minority-leader>
 of New York to lead the party into the Donald Trump era, while Senate 
Republicans re-elected Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to be their key legislative 
bridge to the next administration. Schumer had hoped he might be the majority 
leader if his party recaptured the Senate, working closely with Hillary 
Clinton’s administration. Instead, the New York Democrat will serve as the 
party’s main counterweight to a Trump presidency as minority leader. He will 
replace Harry Reid, the sharp-tongued senator from Nevada, who is retiring. 
Kellyanne Conway: Donald Trump’s team has made ‘a lot of progress’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/16/kellyanne-conway-defends-trump-transition-team-video>
 * Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, a newly minted member of the Democratic 
leadership in the upper chamber, has released a statement calling the 
appointment of Breitbart chair Steve Bannon as president-elect Donald Trump’s 
chief strategist and senior counsel “totally unacceptable.” 
 * “This country, since its inception, has struggled to overcome 
discrimination of all forms: racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia,” 
Sanders declared in a statement. “Over the years we have made progress in 
becoming a less discriminatory and more tolerant society – and we are not going 
backward.”

 * An official in the Chinese foreign ministry has responded to 
president-elect Donald Trump’s old allegation that the Chinese government 
created the concept of climate change as a hoax to trick the West into ruining 
its manufacturing industry. Facebook

Who is Jared Kushner? Trump's son-in-law at center of transition team drama

One of the key men behind Donald Trump’s transition to power is a 35-year-old 
real estate mogul, businessman and publisher called Jared Kushner. He is also 
married to Trump’s influential daughter Ivanka, and is in line to be arguably 
the most powerful son-in-law to ever set foot in the White House.

During the latter stages of the campaign it was Kushner who effectively 
functioned as Trump’s campaign manger. He advised him on strategy, drafted his 
speeches and ran the candidate’s digital media campaign.

But eight days after Trump’s unexpected victory, Kushner is now at the centre 
ofa messy and Shakespearean body-strewn transition process 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/15/donald-trump-transition-team-disarray-adviser-purge>
, variously described as infighting, a “Stalinist purge”, and a “knife fight”. 
On Friday, New Jersey governorChris Christie was abruptly sacked as head of the 
transition team 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/chris-christie-dropped-trump-transition-team>
 and replaced with Trump’s vice-president-elect, Mike Pence.

Christie’s ousting is thought to be the result of a feud with Kushner. As a 
federal prosecutor, Christie prosecuted Kushner’s father, Charles, who was 
convicted and jailed on charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal 
campaign contributions. He got two years in jail, and was released after one. 
While he was in jail, Kushner took over the running of his father’s property 
business.

Earlier this week, two more senior members of Trump’s team were sacked. They 
were Mike Rogers, who had been handling national security, and Matthew 
Freedman, a lobbyist and liaison with business and foreign governments. Both 
were allies of Christie.

Good-looking, tall and patrician, Kushner studied at Harvard and New York 
universities. (According to Daniel Golden, author of The Price of Admissions: 
How America’s Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges, he was admitted to 
Harvard after his father donated $2.5m to the university.) At age 26, he was 
conducting his own mega-deals. In 2007, he bought an office building on Fifth 
Avenue for a record $1.8bn. Most of the cash involved in the acquisition was 
borrowed.


Kushner has one characteristic which sets him apart from Trump’s alt-right 
entourage: he’s Jewish. (Ivanka Trump converted to Judaism when they married in 
2009; the couple have three children who they’re raising as Orthodox Jews.) 
Kushner has defended his father-in-law against persistent accusations of 
antisemitism, including in a notable piece published by the New York Observer, 
which he owns.


Trump has described his son-in-law as a “great guy”. The president-elect has 
also reportedly taken the unprecedented step of requesting security clearance 
for Kushner to attend top-secret presidential briefings, the first one of which 
was on Tuesday. It’s unclear if the request will be approved. It marks an 
astonishing departure and invites the accusation of nepotism.

Hillary Clinton, on facing adversity:

America is worth it. Our children are worth it. Believe in our country, fight 
for our values, and never give up. Because over the past two years, I’ve met so 
many people who’ve reaffirmed my belief in this country.

Speaking in New York City, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton declared at a gala for the Children’s Defense Fund that “no child” 
should live in fear of their parents being deported, or of violence at their 
schools because of their race or religion.

“No child should have to live with fear like that,” Clinton said, in an 
apparent reference to president-elect Donald Trump’s proposals regarding 
undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United States. “No child 
should be afraid to go to school because they are Latino, or African American, 
or Muslim, or have a disability.”

“There is work to do,” Clinton continued. “Girls as well as boys, in every 
country, in every continent, deserve that chance to fulfill their potential.”

“If they can persevere, so can all of us.”

On a conference call with reporters tonight, Republican National Committee 
strategist Sean Spicer and president-elect Donald Trump’s senior communications 
advisor, Jason Miller, announced that landing teams will be deployed in the 
coming days to start the transition process and noted that all of those joining 
landing teams will sign a pledge that they will not serve as a lobbyist at the 
federal and state level for the next five years.

They also noted several of the meetings that the president-elect had held with 
potential cabinet members today, including Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, 
General Mike Flynn, Georgia congressman Tom Price, Kansas congressman Mike 
Pompeo and charter school activist Eva Moskowitz.

They added that Trump is expected to meet tomorrow with South Carolina 
governor Nikki Haley, Florida governor Rick Scott and former secretary of state 
Henry Kissinger, among others.

Speaking at a gala celebrating the Children’s Defense Fund, former Democratic 
presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the audience of philanthropists and 
children’s rights activists that although after the loss of the presidential 
race one week ago, she wanted to “curl up with a book, maybe my dogs, and never 
leave the house again,” but that she was inspired in part by the stories of the 
children that the organization helps.

“The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. Now, 
sometimes it can feel awfully long - believe me, I know,” Clinton said, to 
muted laughter. “But it does bend towards justice.”

“You don’t get to stop paying rent just because things don’t go your way,” 
Clinton continued. “I know that many of you are disappointed in the results of 
last week’s election - so am I, more than I can ever express, but as I said 
last week, our campaign was never about one person or even one election,” 
Clinton said, but about “building an America that is hopeful, inclusive and 
bighearted.”

 * Donald Trump renewed his fight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/donald-trump-media-new-york-times-tweets>
 with the American media, criticizing the New York Times, ducking reporters to 
visit a restaurant and turning to Twitter as a means of direct communication. 
The US president-elect even appeared to allude to his reality TV show The 
Apprentice as he denied reports that his transition process is in turmoil and 
plagued by infighting. 
 * Trump waged an unprecedented one-man war against the media during his 
election campaign, banning some organizations from his rallies and regularly 
inciting his supporters to boo and jeer reporters. He used Twitter, on which he 
has more than 15 million followers, to berate his critics and throw out often 
incendiary statements.

 * Tom Hanks has spoken out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/16/tom-hanks-us-election-donald-trump-president>
 about the results of the election, reassuring people that the US has seen 
difficult times before and is still “the greatest country in the world.” 
 * “We are going to be all right,” he said, according to Vulture. “America has 
been in worse places than we are at right now.” He went on to praise the 
constitution, saying: “That document is going to protect us, over and over 
again, whether or not our neighbors preserve and protect and defend it 
themselves.” 
 * Senate Democrats today elected Chuck Schumer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/chuck-schumer-senate-democrats-elect-minority-leader>
 of New York to lead the party into the Donald Trump era, while Senate 
Republicans re-elected Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to be their key legislative 
bridge to the next administration. Schumer had hoped he might be the majority 
leader if his party recaptured the Senate, working closely with Hillary 
Clinton’s administration. Instead, the New York Democrat will serve as the 
party’s main counterweight to a Trump presidency as minority leader. He will 
replace Harry Reid, the sharp-tongued senator from Nevada, who is retiring. 
Kellyanne Conway: Donald Trump’s team has made ‘a lot of progress’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/16/kellyanne-conway-defends-trump-transition-team-video>
 * Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, a newly minted member of the Democratic 
leadership in the upper chamber, has released a statement calling the 
appointment of Breitbart chair Steve Bannon as president-elect Donald Trump’s 
chief strategist and senior counsel “totally unacceptable.” 
 * “This country, since its inception, has struggled to overcome 
discrimination of all forms: racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia,” 
Sanders declared in a statement. “Over the years we have made progress in 
becoming a less discriminatory and more tolerant society – and we are not going 
backward.”

 * An official in the Chinese foreign ministry has responded to 
president-elect Donald Trump’s old allegation that the Chinese government 
created the concept of climate change as a hoax to trick the West into ruining 
its manufacturing industry.

One of the key men behind Donald Trump’s transition to power is a 35-year-old 
real estate mogul, businessman and publisher called Jared Kushner. He is also 
married to Trump’s influential daughter Ivanka, and is in line to be arguably 
the most powerful son-in-law to ever set foot in the White House.

During the latter stages of the campaign it was Kushner who effectively 
functioned as Trump’s campaign manger. He advised him on strategy, drafted his 
speeches and ran the candidate’s digital media campaign.

But eight days after Trump’s unexpected victory, Kushner is now at the centre 
ofa messy and Shakespearean body-strewn transition process 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/15/donald-trump-transition-team-disarray-adviser-purge>
, variously described as infighting, a “Stalinist purge”, and a “knife fight”. 
On Friday, New Jersey governorChris Christie was abruptly sacked as head of the 
transition team 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/chris-christie-dropped-trump-transition-team>
 and replaced with Trump’s vice-president-elect, Mike Pence.

Christie’s ousting is thought to be the result of a feud with Kushner. As a 
federal prosecutor, Christie prosecuted Kushner’s father, Charles, who was 
convicted and jailed on charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal 
campaign contributions. He got two years in jail, and was released after one. 
While he was in jail, Kushner took over the running of his father’s property 
business.

Earlier this week, two more senior members of Trump’s team were sacked. They 
were Mike Rogers, who had been handling national security, and Matthew 
Freedman, a lobbyist and liaison with business and foreign governments. Both 
were allies of Christie.

Good-looking, tall and patrician, Kushner studied at Harvard and New York 
universities. (According to Daniel Golden, author of The Price of Admissions: 
How America’s Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges, he was admitted to 
Harvard after his father donated $2.5m to the university.) At age 26, he was 
conducting his own mega-deals. In 2007, he bought an office building on Fifth 
Avenue for a record $1.8bn. Most of the cash involved in the acquisition was 
borrowed.


Kushner has one characteristic which sets him apart from Trump’s alt-right 
entourage: he’s Jewish. (Ivanka Trump converted to Judaism when they married in 
2009; the couple have three children who they’re raising as Orthodox Jews.) 
Kushner has defended his father-in-law against persistent accusations of 
antisemitism, including in a notable piece published by the New York Observer, 
which he owns.


Trump has described his son-in-law as a “great guy”. The president-elect has 
also reportedly taken the unprecedented step of requesting security clearance 
for Kushner to attend top-secret presidential briefings, the first one of which 
was on Tuesday. It’s unclear if the request will be approved. It marks an 
astonishing departure and invites the accusation of nepotism.

Megyn Kelly, speaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, declared tonight while 
promoting her new book that president-elect Donald Trump’s lawyer had to be 
told that if she were to be killed after the lawyer retweeted a demand that she 
be “gutted,” “it would not help your candidate.”

Hillary Clinton, on facing adversity:

America is worth it. Our children are worth it. Believe in our country, fight 
for our values, and never give up. Because over the past two years, I’ve met so 
many people who’ve reaffirmed my belief in this country.
 
Speaking in New York City, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton declared at a gala for the Children’s Defense Fund that “no child” 
should live in fear of their parents being deported, or of violence at their 
schools because of their race or religion.

“No child should have to live with fear like that,” Clinton said, in an 
apparent reference to president-elect Donald Trump’s proposals regarding 
undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United States. “No child 
should be afraid to go to school because they are Latino, or African American, 
or Muslim, or have a disability.”

“There is work to do,” Clinton continued. “Girls as well as boys, in every 
country, in every continent, deserve that chance to fulfill their potential.”

“If they can persevere, so can all of us.”
 
On a conference call with reporters tonight, Republican National Committee 
strategist Sean Spicer and president-elect Donald Trump’s senior communications 
advisor, Jason Miller, announced that landing teams will be deployed in the 
coming days to start the transition process and noted that all of those joining 
landing teams will sign a pledge that they will not serve as a lobbyist at the 
federal and state level for the next five years.

They also noted several of the meetings that the president-elect had held with 
potential cabinet members today, including Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, 
General Mike Flynn, Georgia congressman Tom Price, Kansas congressman Mike 
Pompeo and charter school activist Eva Moskowitz.

They added that Trump is expected to meet tomorrow with South Carolina 
governor Nikki Haley, Florida governor Rick Scott and former secretary of state 
Henry Kissinger, among others.

 
Speaking at a gala celebrating the Children’s Defense Fund, former Democratic 
presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the audience of philanthropists and 
children’s rights activists that although after the loss of the presidential 
race one week ago, she wanted to “curl up with a book, maybe my dogs, and never 
leave the house again,” but that she was inspired in part by the stories of the 
children that the organization helps.

“The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. Now, 
sometimes it can feel awfully long - believe me, I know,” Clinton said, to 
muted laughter. “But it does bend towards justice.”

“You don’t get to stop paying rent just because things don’t go your way,” 
Clinton continued. “I know that many of you are disappointed in the results of 
last week’s election - so am I, more than I can ever express, but as I said 
last week, our campaign was never about one person or even one election,” 
Clinton said, but about “building an America that is hopeful, inclusive and 
bighearted.”

Video: Donald Trump’s name has been stripped from three New York City 
apartment buildings that he once developed and later sold, after protests from 
the building’s residents that the name was negatively affecting their ability 
to attract renters and buyers.

Kellyanne Conway, adviser for president-elect Donald Trump’s transition team, 
dismissed reports of problems in forming his cabinet in an on-camera interview 
with pool reporters this evening, and said that new appointments should be 
announced soon.
Trump adviser on transition: ‘You don’t form a government overnight’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/17/trump-adviser-on-transition-you-dont-form-a-government-overnight-video>
“We feel really good about the transition,” Conway said. “I actually would 
just say it’s false to say it’s not going well.”
