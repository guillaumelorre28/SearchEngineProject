The education secretary, Nicky Morgan, has confirmed that the troubled Durham 
free school

is to close, a month after Ofsted inspectors revealed that it was beset by weak 
leadership and bullying.

A letter from the Department for Education (DfE ) said the school had failed 
to show enough evidence of improvement, and gaveformal notice 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-of-termination-of-funding-agreement-to-durham-free-school>
 that its funding would be terminated and should close before Easter.

Morgan said: “It is clear that the school is not delivering the high standard 
of education that parents and I expect. It is also clear that there is no 
imminent prospect of improvement and I am not prepared to let any child remain 
in a failing school.”

I am not prepared to let any child remain in a failing school

Durham free school opened in September 2013 as part of the government’s 
controversial programme to allow new schools to be established outside of local 
authority control. Several have run into difficulty, and four have now been 
closed or re-established.

Durham local authority has contacted parents to arrange new school places. The 
DfE said any disruption would be “outweighed by the positive impact on pupils 
that will come from receiving a higher standard of education in other local 
school”.

Pat Glass, the Labour MP for North West Durham, told the House of Commons last 
month that the school had become “a haven for every crap teacher in the 
north-east”.

Ofsted’s inspection report 
<http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/140005>
 rated the school as inadequate and placed it in special measures. A separate 
report by the DfE’s Education Funding Agency had serious concerns over the 
school’s financial management.
