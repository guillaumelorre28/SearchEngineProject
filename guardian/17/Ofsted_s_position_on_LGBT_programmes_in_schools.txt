With reference to your article (LGBT author hits back at attacks over book for 
schoolchildren on gender diversity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/02/book-explaining-gender-diversity-to-primary-school-children-sparks-furore>
, 3 January), I would like to take the opportunity to clarify for your readers 
that Ofsted does not formally recognise any specific programmes to support 
LGBTQ inclusion in schools. As an independent arbiter of education standards, 
Ofsted is mindful of avoiding suggestions that we endorse or recommend 
particular educational programmes or resources. From time to time individual 
inspection reports may make reference to the tools or programmes a school has 
used, and the impact they have had in the context of that particular school. 
However, this should not be taken as official recognition or endorsement of 
those tools and programmes.
Sean Harford
National Director, Education, Ofsted
