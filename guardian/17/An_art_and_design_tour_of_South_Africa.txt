When it comes to art and design in South Africa things are heating up. Cape 
Town will soon be home to the largest contemporary art gallery on the 
continent, and, on the streets of major cities, art collectives are sharing 
their unique experience through prolific street work, while entire 
neighbourhoods are sprouting up around creative communities. Of course, this is 
a boon for the culturally curious traveller. It is impossible to cover 
everything South Africa has to offer the art and design lover in just one 
place, but here are some things to get excited about if exploring the arts is 
your reason to travel.

The new Zeitz MOCAA
Backed by Jochen Zeitz, a successful businessman who also happens to be an 
avid collector of African art, theZeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa 
<http://www.zeitzmocaa.museum/> (MOCAA) in Cape Town is set to be one of the 
global art community’s most anticipated art openings in 2017. London-based 
architect and design firm Heatherwick Studio is transforming an enormous grain 
silo on the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront into a new cornerstone of African art. 
Zeitz’s impressive collection will form the backbone of the permanent 
exhibition at the museum, which will officially open in September 2017.

Cape Town’s Woodstock neighbourhood
“I absolutely love Woodstock,” says Cape Town photographer Ockie Fourie 
(Instagram:theworldsyoungestman 
<https://www.instagram.com/theworldsyoungestman/>) of what is arguably Cape 
Town’s trendiest neighbourhood. “There is a shot for me around every corner. 
The architecture, the people and the overall atmosphere make it a suburb unlike 
any other.” Begin your exploration of the area atThe Old Biscuit Mill 
<http://www.theoldbiscuitmill.co.za/> – its craft design stores make it a 
hipster magnet, but it is no less enjoyable for that. For serious art, make 
time for theWhatiftheworld Gallery <http://www.whatiftheworld.com/> – a 
well-curated collection of modern works, both local and international.

Street art
South Africa’s busiest cities, much like those in Europe and the US, are being 
transformed through the force of what some call gentrification and others call 
regeneration. And most of Johannesburg and Cape Town’s street artists operate 
with this in mind. Anyone who truly wants to get under the cultural surface 
should open their eyes to works on street walls, where collectives such as the
Burning Museum <https://burningmuseum.wordpress.com/> (Cape Town) are offering 
their urgent and important views on contemporary South African issues through 
their work. A quick way for visitors to get to the heart of the action is a 
street art tour. Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban all offer them. As the Cape 
Town’s Woodstock tour organisers note: “Graffiti art does not merely act as 
embellishment for the area’s buildings but is also a way to bring positive 
socio-economical changes within the community.” See a preview of what’s on 
offer in your chosen city before you visit atGraffiti South Africa 
<http://www.graffitisouthafrica.com/>. 

Johannesburg’s Maboneng precinct
Once a rundown part of town, the Maboneng precinct is now a modern lifestyle 
mecca. Much noise is around theCosmopolitan <http://www.thecosmopolitan.joburg/>
, a recently opened artisanal shopping mall art museum in a refurbished 
Victorian building. But the Cosmo isn’t the only ticket worth taking in the 
neighbourhood. Local filmmaker Gareth Pon (Instagram:garethpon 
<https://www.instagram.com/garethpon/>) highly recommends the area’s Museum of 
African Design <http://www.moadjhb.com/>. Housed in a renovated art deco 
building, it is the first museum on the whole continent dedicated to the topic. 
“In many ways you can discover some of the most unique expressions of 
creativity in the world, while still feeling the heart of South Africa,” says 
Pon.

 Nirox Sculpture Park is set in a Unesco world heritage site 
The Nirox Sculpture Park 
Not all of what South Africa has to offer the art and design lover is in its 
cities.Nirox Sculpture Park <http://niroxarts.com/index.php/sculpture-park/> is 
a sprawling 15-hectare (37-acre) outdoor gallery set within the Khatlhampi 
Private Reserve, found in the Cradle of Humankind, a Unesco world heritage site 
in the province of Gauteng. The park offers great artworks set within a region 
of mind-altering beauty and exotic wildlife, including zebras. Drop everything 
and go.

Port Elizabeth’s creative scene 
The Athenaeum cultural centre in Port Elizabeth’s Nelson Mandela Bay says a 
lot about the city - there’s theatre, art and creativity of all kinds to be 
discovered. TheAthenaeum <http://www.theathenaeum.co.za/About> is the Grand Old 
Lady of the city, and the cornerstone of Port Elizabeth’s creative community, 
which has flourished through a recent public funding of artists. Port Elizabeth 
is also home to accomplished street art, energetic pop-up galleries and Route 
67 – a tour of 67 public artworks symbolising Nelson Mandela’s 67 years of 
political life and freedom fighting.
