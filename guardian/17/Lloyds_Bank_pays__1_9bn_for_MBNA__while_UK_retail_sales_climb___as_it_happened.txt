Wall Street opens higher

US shares continue to forge ahead, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
making further strides towards the 20,000 barrier.

The Dow is currently up 61 points or 0.3% 19,944, as the post election rally 
continues. The S&P 500 has opened 0.22% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.3% 
better.

The moves higher came despite the increased global tensions, following the 
attacks in Berlin and Turkey.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:

US markets are continuing to remain resilient despite the continued rise in 
yields and the US dollar, with the Dow looking to have another crack at the 
20,000 level that it fell just short of last week.

As for Europe, the FTSE 100 is up 0.3%, Germany’s Dax is 0.19% higher and 
France’s Cac has climbed 0.4%. Hewson said:


It’s been another fairly quiet pre-Christmas trading day for European equity 
markets which, after yesterday’s brief pause have continued to build on the 
gains of the last few weeks with the Dax shrugging off the tragic events in 
Berlin, to put in another new high for the year.

The FTSE100 has also hit its highest level since October as both key European 
benchmarks reap the benefits of a weaker currency with the euro hitting its 
lowest levels since 2002 and the pound posting a one month low against the US 
dollar.

If investors are in any way fazed by the rise in geopolitical tension over the 
past 24 hours it’s certainly not being reflected in stock market valuations.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Helena Smith

Over in Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, the euro working 
group is set to decide whether to reinstate short-term debt relief measures 
abruptly suspended last week. Helena Smith reports:

In Athens officials are privately expressing optimism that lenders will take 
the view the government’s announcement of relief measures for the vulnerable 
“in no way conflicts with fiscal targets.”

Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who caught creditors off guard when he declared 
a budget primary surplus would allow his leftist led coalition to grant a 
one-off bonus to around 1.6 million low-income pensioners, is hoping today’s 
teleconference will clear up “any misunderstanding.”
 Greek prime minister Tsipras. 
Greece has been on a collision course with bailout partners since the measures 
were unveiled. Suspension of a planned VAT rise on islands in the Aegean hit by 
refugee flows - a second measure - was included in a draft bill put before 
parliament last night.

The hope is that the euro working group will unblock the debt relief measures 
it froze last week so that a second review of the economy assessing the headway 
Greece has made in implementing reforms can be concluded when euro zone finance 
ministers convene again on 26 January.

The euro continues to fall against the dollar, heading closer towards parity. 
The decline is mainly a function of the strength of the US currency of course, 
as further interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve loom large. But the 
problems of the eurozone, including the troubled Italian banking sector, are 
also a factor, as is the horrific attack in Berlin.

The euro is currently down 0.5% at $1.0353, its lowest since early 2003.

Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said:

Another day, anther multi-year high for the dollar. This afternoon saw the 
euro/dollar drop below last week’s low to hit its lowest level since 2003. The 
world’s heaviest traded pair has been falling sharply in recent times as 
disparity between Eurozone and US monetary policies grow. Whereas the ECB has 
turned even more dovish by expanding its QE stimulus programme to at least 
December 2017, the Fed has [raised] interest rates and has talked up the 
possibility of three further hikes next year. This is basically the driving 
force behind the euro/dollar’s downward move and will probably remain so in the 
early parts of next year.

[The] next phase of the move could be severe in terms of magnitude. At a 
minimum, the euro/dollar, I think, would reach parity, possibly before the year 
is out. I think there is potential for it to drop even lower over time.

Here’s our report on the CBI’s retail sales survey. Larry Elliott writes:

Retailers have been enjoying their strongest sales growth in more than a year 
amid signs from Britain’s leading employers’ organisation of a pre-Christmas 
consumer spending spree.

The latest health check of high street and online activity from the CBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/cbi> found that sales so far in December 
beat expectations, were above average for the time of year, and led to 
retailers beefing up their orders to suppliers.

But the CBI’s distributive trades survey also found that retailers expect the 
pace of growth to slacken in early 2017 when thefall in the value of the pound 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/winners-losers-sterling-plunge-brexit>
 pushes up inflation and reduces living standards.

The survey of 112 retailers reported 51% as saying sales were higher than a 
year ago while 16% said they were lower. The resulting balance of +35 points 
was up on the +26 points recorded in November and the highest since September 
2015.

UK rates as likely to rise as fall - BoE's McCafferty

As if to confirm the CBI’s comments about rising prices, the Bank of England’s 
Ian McCafferty has pointed to the prospect of higher inflation, and reiterated 
the bank’s stance that interest rates were as likely to rise as to fall.

In a speech at the Dorset Chamber of Commerce 
<http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2016/951.aspx>, he 
said that higher inflation, weaker growth and the fallout from the Brexit vote 
complicated the outlook for the UK economy:

This confluence of trends - rising inflation, initial demand resilience but a 
slowdown in growth in prospect and a likely hit to supply over the longer term 
- provides a challenging background for policy setting...

On the basis of our current understanding of the economy, the balance of risks 
around the outlook was two-sided, such that from the current level, any further 
changes in our policy stance in the near future were as likely to be upward as 
downward...

The uncertainties about the future path of the economy following the 
referendum are such that we will be following the emerging data even more 
closely than normal. Quite where policy will go next will depend crucially on 
how the different cogs and wheels in the economy behave over the coming year or 
two.

Consumers may be splashing out because they anticipate prices are heading 
higher, says economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit:

Retailers will certainly be hoping that consumers’ willingness to spend holds 
up over the final part of the vital Christmas shopping period and into the New 
Year. The CBI survey indicates that retailers are more cautious about sales 
prospects in January although they still see them at a relatively decent 
level....

For now, consumers are still benefiting from decent fundamentals, notably 
relatively decent purchasing power and high employment...

The major problem facing the economy - and retailers in particular - is that 
it looks inevitable that the fundamentals for consumers will weaken markedly 
over the coming months with purchasing power being increasingly squeezed and 
the labour market likely weakening...

In the near-term, there is the possibility that some consumers will bring 
forward purchases of big-ticket items in the belief that their prices are 
likely to rise appreciably over the coming months.

Expectations of rising prices may make consumers particularly keen to take 
advantage of genuine bargains in the clearance sales in late-December and 
January.

Next year looks more challenging for retailers, ING economist James Knightley 
agrees:

Households are clearly willing to spend, but the headwinds for next year are 
strong.

The UK’s Confederation of British Industry has reported that retailers have 
had a really strong Christmas trading period so far. A net 35% of retailers saw 
higher volumes of sales than 12 months ago, up from 26% in November and well 
ahead of the 20% consensus. This is the strongest reading since September last 
year and suggests that consumer spending will again make a big contribution to 
4Q GDP growth. It also again highlights the resilience of the UK economy 
despite the Brexit uncertainty.

However, 2017 is already shaping up to be more challenging. Consumer 
confidence has weakened significantly in the past couple of months, which may 
be partly due to growing fears over what Brexit might mean for households, but 
also an anticipation of sharply higher prices. Inflation expectations have 
jumped in response to warnings from industry groups and individual companies 
that the pound’s collapse means higher costs that will likely be passed onto 
consumers. This is going to squeeze household spending power and may be partly 
responsible for the recent run of strong spending – people bringing forward 
purchases to avoid higher prices.

The CBI survey 
<http://www.cbi.org.uk/news/retail-sales-grow-at-slightly-faster-rate-than-expected/>
 actually takes in the last week of November and the first two weeks of this 
month, so it includes Black Friday as well as the pre-Christmas shopping spree.

The CBI calculates its balance figure by taking away the percentage of 
retailers who saw falling sales from those who reported a rise.

So 51% said sales volumes were up, whilst 16% said they were down, giving a 
balance of +35%.

But despite the boom in the numbers, the CBI said it expected sales to slow in 
2017 as the weaker pound pushed up prices and squeezed disposable income.

It said the growth was broad based, with strong performances from clothing and 
grocers. Internet sales - of course - continued to move higher, at their best 
pace since November 2014. CBI economist Ben Jones said:

It’s encouraging to see retailers reporting another month of healthy sales 
growth leading up to the festive season, which rounds off a fairly solid 
quarter.

While we still expect to see decent growth in the near term, the pressures on 
retail activity are likely to increase during 2017, as the impact of sterling’s 
depreciation feeds through.

With higher inflation beginning to weigh on households’ purchasing power, 
consumption patterns are likely to shift, creating winners and losers across 
the retail landscape.

Stronger than expected UK retail sales

So far in December retail sales have come in stronger than expected, according 
to the CBI.

Its retail sales index showed a balance of +35%, up from +26% in November and 
better than the expected +20%. This is the highest level since September 2015.

The index of retailers’ orders with suppliers was up 12% in December compared 
to a rise of 6% in November, the best level for more than a year.

A quick update on the markets.

Despite the horrific events in Berlin and Turkey, leading shares are 
attempting to move higher.

The FTSE 100 is up 0.03%, while Germany’s Dax is up 0.05% and France’s Cac has 
climbed 0.3%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said:

Equity indices are trading flat on another sombre post-terror attack day with 
markets shrugging off renewed geopolitical risk and Travel stocks not suffering 
their usual knee-jerk weakness. The FTSE100 is treading water with Lloyds (MBNA 
purchase offers chance for growth) and big Pharma offsetting losses for HSBC, 
Oil majors and Tobacco despite the weak pound.

Major bourses remain close to highs, but may struggle to improve without a 
Monte dei Paschi recap/rescue in the bag. The FTSE 100 is sideways 6995-7020, 
waiting to pop one way or the other. The DAX 30 is holding its December uptrend 
above 14000, still trying to engineer a breakout to fresh 13-month highs. Dow 
Jones Futures are knocking at 19920 resistance trying to challenge 19965 
all-time highs.

The Lloyds/MDNA deal owes something to the regulators, says Laith Khalaf, 
senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown:

Lloyds is backing itself despite the uncertain economic outlook, and this deal 
will mean the bank has now cornered a quarter of the UK credit card market.

This does mean a special dividend for 2016 has become less likely, but at the 
same time the additional earnings from the credit card book bolster the 
dividend-paying prospects of the bank in years to come.

The acquisition will allow Lloyds to boost its net interest margin, which is 
pretty valuable against a backdrop of such low interest rates.

The deal owes some thanks to the FCA deadline on PPI claims, which has given 
some measure of certainty to the level of compensation MBNA will have to pay 
out, providing both parties with a more solid platform for negotiation.

News from Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece> of a delay in 
appointing a new chief executive for the country’s biggest bank. Greece’s 
Kathimerini reports:

The process for the appointment of a new chief executive officer will resume 
in 2017, Piraeus Bank’s governing board decided on Monday.

Earlier, the majority of the board had voted down the lone candidacy of 
Christos Papadopoulos due to reservations expressed by the European Central 
Bank’s Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).

Sources say that the appointment was postponed after consultation with the 
SSM, as it appears that once again the insistence of the Hellenic Financial 
Stability Fund (HFSF) that a CEO must be appointed did not convince the bank’s 
board. The HFSF is the biggest stakeholder in Piraeus Bank. It holds 26 percent 
of its shares.

The mandate of the board expires next summer and, according to sources, that 
will set the time frame for the completion of administrative changes in the 
lender.

US shares continue to forge ahead, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
making further strides towards the 20,000 barrier.

The Dow is currently up 61 points or 0.3% 19,944, as the post election rally 
continues. The S&P 500 has opened 0.22% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.3% 
better.

The moves higher came despite the increased global tensions, following the 
attacks in Berlin and Turkey.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:

US markets are continuing to remain resilient despite the continued rise in 
yields and the US dollar, with the Dow looking to have another crack at the 
20,000 level that it fell just short of last week.

As for Europe, the FTSE 100 is up 0.3%, Germany’s Dax is 0.19% higher and 
France’s Cac has climbed 0.4%. Hewson said:


It’s been another fairly quiet pre-Christmas trading day for European equity 
markets which, after yesterday’s brief pause have continued to build on the 
gains of the last few weeks with the Dax shrugging off the tragic events in 
Berlin, to put in another new high for the year.

The FTSE100 has also hit its highest level since October as both key European 
benchmarks reap the benefits of a weaker currency with the euro hitting its 
lowest levels since 2002 and the pound posting a one month low against the US 
dollar.

If investors are in any way fazed by the rise in geopolitical tension over the 
past 24 hours it’s certainly not being reflected in stock market valuations.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Over in Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>, the euro working 
group is set to decide whether to reinstate short-term debt relief measures 
abruptly suspended last week. Helena Smith reports:

In Athens officials are privately expressing optimism that lenders will take 
the view the government’s announcement of relief measures for the vulnerable 
“in no way conflicts with fiscal targets.”

Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who caught creditors off guard when he declared 
a budget primary surplus would allow his leftist led coalition to grant a 
one-off bonus to around 1.6 million low-income pensioners, is hoping today’s 
teleconference will clear up “any misunderstanding.”
 Greek prime minister Tsipras. 
Greece has been on a collision course with bailout partners since the measures 
were unveiled. Suspension of a planned VAT rise on islands in the Aegean hit by 
refugee flows - a second measure - was included in a draft bill put before 
parliament last night.

The hope is that the euro working group will unblock the debt relief measures 
it froze last week so that a second review of the economy assessing the headway 
Greece has made in implementing reforms can be concluded when euro zone finance 
ministers convene again on 26 January.
 
The euro continues to fall against the dollar, heading closer towards parity. 
The decline is mainly a function of the strength of the US currency of course, 
as further interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve loom large. But the 
problems of the eurozone, including the troubled Italian banking sector, are 
also a factor, as is the horrific attack in Berlin.

The euro is currently down 0.5% at $1.0353, its lowest since early 2003.

Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said:

Another day, anther multi-year high for the dollar. This afternoon saw the 
euro/dollar drop below last week’s low to hit its lowest level since 2003. The 
world’s heaviest traded pair has been falling sharply in recent times as 
disparity between Eurozone and US monetary policies grow. Whereas the ECB has 
turned even more dovish by expanding its QE stimulus programme to at least 
December 2017, the Fed has [raised] interest rates and has talked up the 
possibility of three further hikes next year. This is basically the driving 
force behind the euro/dollar’s downward move and will probably remain so in the 
early parts of next year.

[The] next phase of the move could be severe in terms of magnitude. At a 
minimum, the euro/dollar, I think, would reach parity, possibly before the year 
is out. I think there is potential for it to drop even lower over time.
 
Here’s our report on the CBI’s retail sales survey. Larry Elliott writes:

Retailers have been enjoying their strongest sales growth in more than a year 
amid signs from Britain’s leading employers’ organisation of a pre-Christmas 
consumer spending spree.

The latest health check of high street and online activity from the CBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/cbi> found that sales so far in December 
beat expectations, were above average for the time of year, and led to 
retailers beefing up their orders to suppliers.

But the CBI’s distributive trades survey also found that retailers expect the 
pace of growth to slacken in early 2017 when thefall in the value of the pound 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/winners-losers-sterling-plunge-brexit>
 pushes up inflation and reduces living standards.

The survey of 112 retailers reported 51% as saying sales were higher than a 
year ago while 16% said they were lower. The resulting balance of +35 points 
was up on the +26 points recorded in November and the highest since September 
2015.

As if to confirm the CBI’s comments about rising prices, the Bank of England’s 
Ian McCafferty has pointed to the prospect of higher inflation, and reiterated 
the bank’s stance that interest rates were as likely to rise as to fall.

In a speech at the Dorset Chamber of Commerce 
<http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2016/951.aspx>, he 
said that higher inflation, weaker growth and the fallout from the Brexit vote 
complicated the outlook for the UK economy:

This confluence of trends - rising inflation, initial demand resilience but a 
slowdown in growth in prospect and a likely hit to supply over the longer term 
- provides a challenging background for policy setting...

On the basis of our current understanding of the economy, the balance of risks 
around the outlook was two-sided, such that from the current level, any further 
changes in our policy stance in the near future were as likely to be upward as 
downward...

The uncertainties about the future path of the economy following the 
referendum are such that we will be following the emerging data even more 
closely than normal. Quite where policy will go next will depend crucially on 
how the different cogs and wheels in the economy behave over the coming year or 
two.

Consumers may be splashing out because they anticipate prices are heading 
higher, says economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit:

Retailers will certainly be hoping that consumers’ willingness to spend holds 
up over the final part of the vital Christmas shopping period and into the New 
Year. The CBI survey indicates that retailers are more cautious about sales 
prospects in January although they still see them at a relatively decent 
level....

For now, consumers are still benefiting from decent fundamentals, notably 
relatively decent purchasing power and high employment...

The major problem facing the economy - and retailers in particular - is that 
it looks inevitable that the fundamentals for consumers will weaken markedly 
over the coming months with purchasing power being increasingly squeezed and 
the labour market likely weakening...

In the near-term, there is the possibility that some consumers will bring 
forward purchases of big-ticket items in the belief that their prices are 
likely to rise appreciably over the coming months.

Expectations of rising prices may make consumers particularly keen to take 
advantage of genuine bargains in the clearance sales in late-December and 
January.






 
Next year looks more challenging for retailers, ING economist James Knightley 
agrees:

Households are clearly willing to spend, but the headwinds for next year are 
strong.

The UK’s Confederation of British Industry has reported that retailers have 
had a really strong Christmas trading period so far. A net 35% of retailers saw 
higher volumes of sales than 12 months ago, up from 26% in November and well 
ahead of the 20% consensus. This is the strongest reading since September last 
year and suggests that consumer spending will again make a big contribution to 
4Q GDP growth. It also again highlights the resilience of the UK economy 
despite the Brexit uncertainty.

However, 2017 is already shaping up to be more challenging. Consumer 
confidence has weakened significantly in the past couple of months, which may 
be partly due to growing fears over what Brexit might mean for households, but 
also an anticipation of sharply higher prices. Inflation expectations have 
jumped in response to warnings from industry groups and individual companies 
that the pound’s collapse means higher costs that will likely be passed onto 
consumers. This is going to squeeze household spending power and may be partly 
responsible for the recent run of strong spending – people bringing forward 
purchases to avoid higher prices.
 
The CBI survey 
<http://www.cbi.org.uk/news/retail-sales-grow-at-slightly-faster-rate-than-expected/>
 actually takes in the last week of November and the first two weeks of this 
month, so it includes Black Friday as well as the pre-Christmas shopping spree.

The CBI calculates its balance figure by taking away the percentage of 
retailers who saw falling sales from those who reported a rise.

So 51% said sales volumes were up, whilst 16% said they were down, giving a 
balance of +35%.

But despite the boom in the numbers, the CBI said it expected sales to slow in 
2017 as the weaker pound pushed up prices and squeezed disposable income.

It said the growth was broad based, with strong performances from clothing and 
grocers. Internet sales - of course - continued to move higher, at their best 
pace since November 2014. CBI economist Ben Jones said:

It’s encouraging to see retailers reporting another month of healthy sales 
growth leading up to the festive season, which rounds off a fairly solid 
quarter.

While we still expect to see decent growth in the near term, the pressures on 
retail activity are likely to increase during 2017, as the impact of sterling’s 
depreciation feeds through.

With higher inflation beginning to weigh on households’ purchasing power, 
consumption patterns are likely to shift, creating winners and losers across 
the retail landscape.
 
So far in December retail sales have come in stronger than expected, according 
to the CBI.

Its retail sales index showed a balance of +35%, up from +26% in November and 
better than the expected +20%. This is the highest level since September 2015.

The index of retailers’ orders with suppliers was up 12% in December compared 
to a rise of 6% in November, the best level for more than a year.

A quick update on the markets.

Despite the horrific events in Berlin and Turkey, leading shares are 
attempting to move higher.

The FTSE 100 is up 0.03%, while Germany’s Dax is up 0.05% and France’s Cac has 
climbed 0.3%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said:

Equity indices are trading flat on another sombre post-terror attack day with 
markets shrugging off renewed geopolitical risk and Travel stocks not suffering 
their usual knee-jerk weakness. The FTSE100 is treading water with Lloyds (MBNA 
purchase offers chance for growth) and big Pharma offsetting losses for HSBC, 
Oil majors and Tobacco despite the weak pound.

Major bourses remain close to highs, but may struggle to improve without a 
Monte dei Paschi recap/rescue in the bag. The FTSE 100 is sideways 6995-7020, 
waiting to pop one way or the other. The DAX 30 is holding its December uptrend 
above 14000, still trying to engineer a breakout to fresh 13-month highs. Dow 
Jones Futures are knocking at 19920 resistance trying to challenge 19965 
all-time highs.
