Scientists say they have discovered what might be a new species of octopus 
while searching the Pacific Ocean floor near the Hawaiian Islands.

On 27 February, a team found a small light-coloured octopus at a depth of 
about 2.5 miles.

Michael Vecchione of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said 
the discovery was made near Necker Island. The octopus did not have fins and 
all of its suckers were in one row on each arm, Vecchione said.

The octopus “did not seem very muscular”, he said.

“This resulted in a ghostlike appearance, leading to a comment on social media 
that it should be called Casper, like the friendly cartoon ghost. It is almost 
certainly an undescribed species ..., “ he said in the statementposted on 
Wednesday on the NOAA website <http://1.usa.gov/1oXarVu>.

It’s unusual to find an octopus without fins so deep in the ocean, said 
Vecchione, who noted that the previous depths at which an octopus without fins 
was found were all less than 4,000m, or 2.5 miles.

Two scientists he has consulted “agreed that this is something unusual and is 
a depth record ...,” said Vecchione, who is with NOAA’s National Systematics 
Laboratory.

The octopus was discovered during a search of the ocean floor by NOAA’s 
Okeanos Explorer, he said.
