Southern

 and other poorly performing franchises, has admitted it has been wrongly 
telling customers they are not entitled to delay compensation as a result of a 
“computer glitch”.

In the run up to Christmas, thousands of passengers filed repayment claims 
with the firm after suffering significant delays following broken down trains, 
signal failures and cancellations due to driver shortages. Almost 65% of its 
trains ran late between 13 November and 10 December.

But is has now emerged that Govia, which has been the UK’s worst performing 
rail company for two years 
<http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/Rail-News/gtr-marks-two-years-at-the-bottom-of-toc-performance-table>
, has been writing to customers telling them theirDelay Repay claim 
<http://www.thameslinkrailway.com/contact-us/delay-repay/> won’t be paid, 
saying their application is too late.

Under current rules, passengers can claim 25%-100% of a single journey 
following delays of more than 15 or 30 minutes depending on the rail company, 
within 28 days of their journey.

Guardian reader Deborah Cassidy from St Albans received four letters from 
Govia last weekend declining her valid compensation claims for a series of 
delayed journeys in November and December. In each one the letter stated that 
her claim had been declined as it had been submitted too late, despite the 
letter itself showing the claim was within the 28-day limit.

“Since very basic mathematics cannot be beyond Govia’s compensation 
department, one cannot help but wonder whether these letters are sent out 
deliberately, hoping that most passengers will not check the dates,” she said.

Carol Granere from Orkney said her claim was similarly denied. She was delayed 
while travelling from Sandwich to Horsham on 1 November, and filed her claim on 
16 November, but was told by Govia that it could not be paid because it was 
filed 28 days after the delay.

“I have asked them to explain how they manage to calculate that there are more 
than 28 days between the 1st and 16th of November. So far, no response, except 
their inability to match a name with a reference number,” she said.

A spokesman for Govia, which runs the Southern, Southeastern, Thameslink and 
Great Northern franchises, told the Guardian that the letters had been sent out 
in error, and that it was now putting things right. “We apologise to any 
customers who received letters containing erroneous information. There was a 
short-term technical issue with our system shortly before Christmas, but some 
letters containing incorrect information were sent to customers. We will be 
contacting those who received incorrect letters.”

Is Britain’s rail network getting worse?

In October the government announced passengers would be able to claim 
following delays of 15 minutes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/13/rail-users-train-passengers-claim-compensation-15-minute-delays-repay>
, and in December the scheme was introduced on several routes in the Govia 
network, including Southern and Thameslink which have been beset with delays.

Until then passengers could only seek compensation after being delayed 30 
minutes or more. The move was partly prompted by consumer group Which? after it 
used its super-complaint powers in 2015 to request an investigation into how 
passengers are compensated for delayed and cancelled journeys. The subsequent 
investigation by the Office of Rail and Road found there were “significant 
barriers” to passengers being able to easily claim for delays.
