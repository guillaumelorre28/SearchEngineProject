Fees £9,000 for home/EU full-time students. A modular fee structure for 
part-time study is offered, which is cheaper than the fees charged for studying 
full-time. This means that regardless of whether you choose part-time or 
full-time, you will not be disadvantaged financially.

Part-time students studying at least 25% of the intensity of a full-time 
course will also have access to a loan to cover the cost of their tuition but 
will not be entitled to any support for living costs. The amount of the tuition 
loan will depend on the proportion of a full-time course that is studied each 
year.


For international students fees are £10,600.

Bursaries A range of scholarships are available, including: team Staffs sports 
elite scholarships, which is offered to undergraduates who play
