Republicans refuse to criticize Steve Bannon hire after growing backlash

Sabrina Siddiqui

Republicans <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> declined to 
criticize Donald Trump’s decision to appoint Steve Bannon as the chief 
strategist to his impending administration, despite the latter’s record of 
promoting white supremacy.


As lawmakers returned to Washington on Tuesday for the first time since 
Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, Democrats swiftly called on 
the president-elect to rescind his hiring of Bannon.

But Republicans said it was time to unify behind Trump and sidestepped 
questions on his promotion of antisemitic, anti-Muslim and misogynist content 
while overseeing the “alt-right” website Breitbart News.

“I don’t want to accuse a man of being antisemitic or racist whom I’ve never 
met,” said Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina told reporters on 
Capitol Hill when asked about the Bannon appointment.

“I’ve never met him. I wouldn’t know him if he walked in the door,” he said, 
before adding of Breitbart: “The website in question was a friendly site to the 
alt-right. I don’t like them and they don’t like me and I’m glad.”

Marco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> said he had “no 
reaction” to the Bannon news, even though the former Breitbart chairman used 
his website to try and undermine the Florida senator’s political career.

“The president has a right to choose his own staff,” said Rubio, who ran 
unsuccessfully against Trump for the Republican nomination but was re-elected 
to a second term in the Senate last week.

Rubio also dismissed speculation that he might serve in Trump’s cabinet, 
saying he had not spoken with the president-elect’s transition team and would 
“prefer to be in the Senate”.

Former House intelligence committee chairman Mike Rogers has been replaced on 
Trump’s transition team by Islamophobic fantasist Frank Gaffney, the Wall 
Street Journal reports.

Rogers was ousted as a part of a purge of potential Chris Christie loyalists, 
the report says.

The Politico report says:

Republican foreign policy veterans are newly alarmed over the emerging shape 
of Donald Trump’s national security team, after signs that Trump is passing 
over well-regarded establishment figures in favor of controversial and less 
experienced political allies including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a 
likely secretary of state pick.

Read Haroon Moghul in the Guardian  
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/18/islamophobia-ted-cruz-national-security-advisor-frank-gaffney>
last March about Gaffney:

For those of you who don’t know him, Gaffney is a conspiracy theorist whose 
obsessive focus on Islam and Muslims is clear from his statedconcerns about 
<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2010/02/24/can-this-possibly-be-true-new-obama-missile-defense-logo-includes-a-crescent/>
 a “worrying pattern of official US submission to Islam and the 
theo-political-legal program the latter’s authorities call Shariah”. He 
believes the redesigned logo of the Missile Defense Agency, for example 
“appears ominously to reflect a morphing of the Islamic crescent and star with 
the Obama campaign logo”.

It’s hard to find a better description of American decline: from the country 
that repeatedly put men on the moon to the country whose national security 
experts are searching for secret Islamic lunar motifs in government images.

From the longer- and longer-suffering press pool:

Donald Trump is currently at the 21 Club on West 52nd Street. The block is 
shut down and police are allowing a small group of reporters to stand outside 
the restaurant, but we will not be allowed inside.
 I just talked to [Trump spokeswoman] Hope Hicks who said “I wasn’t aware of 
this movement” and she would never do anything to “leave the press in the 
dark.” She said that a protective pool has not yet been set up so she is unable 
to coordinate the press pool traveling with the president-elect. Once that is 
set up, she says reporters will have “all of the access that they have ever had 
under any president.”

That’s encouraging.

The long-suffering transition press pool picks up on this tweet, which appears 
to showDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, tonight, 
now-ish(?), at the 21 Club, three blocks south of Trump tower.

The press pool staked out in the lobby of Trump tower didn’t see him leave and 
weren’t informed he would.

The tweet says “Keene’s” but that’s not historic Keens on 36th:

Obama: 'guard against crude nationalism'

Helena Smith

Barack Obama used his last foreign tour as president to warn against the rise 
of divisive politics with the global ascent of what he described as coarse 
nationalism and tribalism, apparently referring to Donald Trump’s decision to 
appointStephen Bannon as his chief strategist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/steve-bannon-white-house-racism-fear>
.

In Athens, a city he repeatedly hailed as the birthplace of democracy, the 
outgoing leader spoke of the dangers posed by such politics with the stark 
reminder that not that long agoEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> had been turned into “a 
bloodbath” because of them.

“I do believe, separate and apart from any particular election or movement, 
that we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of 
nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an us and a 
them,” he said. “We all know what happens when Europeans start dividing 
themselves and emphasise their differences. The 20th century was a bloodbath.”

Addressing reporters after talks with Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime 
minister, Obama sought to distance himself from the diplomatic language he has 
employed since the election last week of his successor.

From the long-suffering transition press pool, another Mike Pence sighting:

At 5:41pm, Mike Pence emerged from a backed elevator after spending more than 
six hours at Trump Tower. As cameras clicked and a huge crowd of gawkers 
watched, Pence and his wife quickly walked through the lobby, past reporters, 
through the Trump Bar and out to a waiting motorcade.

One reporter asked how the day went and Pence responded: “Great day.”

Another asked if the transition team is behind schedule. Pence didn’t seem to 
respond to that question and instead proclaimed for a second time: “Great day.”

Steyer vows to spend 'whatever is necessary' to block Trump anti-environment 
agenda

Reuters reports that “billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, who has 
spent more than $140 million on fighting climate change, said on Tuesday he 
will spend whatever it takes to fight President-elect Donald Trump’s 
pro-drilling and anti-regulation agenda”:

The former hedge fund manager from California is putting together a strategy 
that will “engage voters and citizens to fight back” once Trump takes the White 
House in January, he told Reuters in an interview. However, he stressed he was 
not planning to fight Trump through the courts.

Instead, he would focus on “trying to present an opposite point of view and 
trying to get that point of view expressed, and communicated to citizens.”

Steyer’s pledge to fight Trump suggests an intensifying battle for U.S. public 
opinion on global climate change, an issue that has already divided many 
Americans, lawmakers, and companies between those who consider it a major 
global threat and those who doubt its existence.

for American Progress’ 2014 Making Progress Policy Conference in Washington

Other U.S. environmental groups are also preparing to resist Trump’s agenda, 
with some vowing street protests and more established organizations that helped 
draft some of President Barack Obama’s environmental regulations preparing to 
defend them in court.

“We have always been willing to do whatever is necessary,” Steyer said, when 
asked how much money he was willing to spend to oppose Trump’s agenda.

Republicans <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans> declined to 
criticize Donald Trump’s decision to appoint Steve Bannon as the chief 
strategist to his impending administration, despite the latter’s record of 
promoting white supremacy.


As lawmakers returned to Washington on Tuesday for the first time since 
Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, Democrats swiftly called on 
the president-elect to rescind his hiring of Bannon.

But Republicans said it was time to unify behind Trump and sidestepped 
questions on his promotion of antisemitic, anti-Muslim and misogynist content 
while overseeing the “alt-right” website Breitbart News.

“I don’t want to accuse a man of being antisemitic or racist whom I’ve never 
met,” said Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina told reporters on 
Capitol Hill when asked about the Bannon appointment.

“I’ve never met him. I wouldn’t know him if he walked in the door,” he said, 
before adding of Breitbart: “The website in question was a friendly site to the 
alt-right. I don’t like them and they don’t like me and I’m glad.”

Marco Rubio <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio> said he had “no 
reaction” to the Bannon news, even though the former Breitbart chairman used 
his website to try and undermine the Florida senator’s political career.

“The president has a right to choose his own staff,” said Rubio, who ran 
unsuccessfully against Trump for the Republican nomination but was re-elected 
to a second term in the Senate last week.

Rubio also dismissed speculation that he might serve in Trump’s cabinet, 
saying he had not spoken with the president-elect’s transition team and would 
“prefer to be in the Senate”.

Former House intelligence committee chairman Mike Rogers has been replaced on

Rogers was ousted as a part of a purge of potential Chris Christie loyalists,

The Politico report says:

Republican foreign policy veterans are newly alarmed over the emerging shape 
of Donald Trump’s national security team, after signs that Trump is passing 
over well-regarded establishment figures in favor of controversial and less 
experienced political allies including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a 
likely secretary of state pick.

Read Haroon Moghul in the Guardian  
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/18/islamophobia-ted-cruz-national-security-advisor-frank-gaffney>
last March about Gaffney:

For those of you who don’t know him, Gaffney is a conspiracy theorist whose 
obsessive focus on Islam and Muslims is clear from his statedconcerns about 
<http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2010/02/24/can-this-possibly-be-true-new-obama-missile-defense-logo-includes-a-crescent/>
 a “worrying pattern of official US submission to Islam and the 
theo-political-legal program the latter’s authorities call Shariah”. He 
believes the redesigned logo of the Missile Defense Agency, for example 
“appears ominously to reflect a morphing of the Islamic crescent and star with 
the Obama campaign logo”.

It’s hard to find a better description of American decline: from the country 
that repeatedly put men on the moon to the country whose national security 
experts are searching for secret Islamic lunar motifs in government images.

From the longer- and longer-suffering press pool:

Donald Trump is currently at the 21 Club on West 52nd Street. The block is 
shut down and police are allowing a small group of reporters to stand outside 
the restaurant, but we will not be allowed inside.
 I just talked to [Trump spokeswoman] Hope Hicks who said “I wasn’t aware of 
this movement” and she would never do anything to “leave the press in the 
dark.” She said that a protective pool has not yet been set up so she is unable 
to coordinate the press pool traveling with the president-elect. Once that is 
set up, she says reporters will have “all of the access that they have ever had 
under any president.”

That’s encouraging.
 
The long-suffering transition press pool picks up on this tweet, which appears 
to showDonald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, tonight, 
now-ish(?), at the 21 Club, three blocks south of Trump tower.

The press pool staked out in the lobby of Trump tower didn’t see him leave and 
weren’t informed he would.

A 1967 anti-nepotism statute <https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3110> 
bars any public official from appointing a relative “to a civilian position in 
the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or 
control.”
 
Barack Obama used his last foreign tour as president to warn against the rise 
of divisive politics with the global ascent of what he described as coarse 
nationalism and tribalism, apparently referring to Donald Trump’s decision to 
appointStephen Bannon as his chief strategist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/steve-bannon-white-house-racism-fear>
.

In Athens, a city he repeatedly hailed as the birthplace of democracy, the 
outgoing leader spoke of the dangers posed by such politics with the stark 
reminder that not that long agoEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> had been turned into “a 
bloodbath” because of them.

“I do believe, separate and apart from any particular election or movement, 
that we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of 
nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an us and a 
them,” he said. “We all know what happens when Europeans start dividing 
themselves and emphasise their differences. The 20th century was a bloodbath.”

Addressing reporters after talks with Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime 
minister, Obama sought to distance himself from the diplomatic language he has 
employed since the election last week of his successor.

From the long-suffering transition press pool, another Mike Pence sighting:

At 5:41pm, Mike Pence emerged from a backed elevator after spending more than 
six hours at Trump Tower. As cameras clicked and a huge crowd of gawkers 
watched, Pence and his wife quickly walked through the lobby, past reporters, 
through the Trump Bar and out to a waiting motorcade.

One reporter asked how the day went and Pence responded: “Great day.”

Another asked if the transition team is behind schedule. Pence didn’t seem to 
respond to that question and instead proclaimed for a second time: “Great day.”
 
Reuters reports that “billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, who has 
spent more than $140 million on fighting climate change, said on Tuesday he 
will spend whatever it takes to fight President-elect Donald Trump’s 
pro-drilling and anti-regulation agenda”:

The former hedge fund manager from California is putting together a strategy 
that will “engage voters and citizens to fight back” once Trump takes the White 
House in January, he told Reuters in an interview. However, he stressed he was 
not planning to fight Trump through the courts.

Instead, he would focus on “trying to present an opposite point of view and 
trying to get that point of view expressed, and communicated to citizens.”

Steyer’s pledge to fight Trump suggests an intensifying battle for U.S. public 
opinion on global climate change, an issue that has already divided many 
Americans, lawmakers, and companies between those who consider it a major 
global threat and those who doubt its existence.

Other U.S. environmental groups are also preparing to resist Trump’s agenda, 
with some vowing street protests and more established organizations that helped 
draft some of President Barack Obama’s environmental regulations preparing to 
defend them in court.

“We have always been willing to do whatever is necessary,” Steyer said, when 
asked how much money he was willing to spend to oppose Trump’s agenda.
