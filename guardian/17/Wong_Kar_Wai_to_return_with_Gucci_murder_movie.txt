Wong Kar-Wai’s films have long been praised for their keen visual panache, as 
well as moving narratives. Movies such asIn the Mood for Love 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/19/in-the-mood-for-love> and
2046 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1389581,00.html>

Man, trainer of kung fu film star Bruce Lee.
