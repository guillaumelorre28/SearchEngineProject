Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to 
help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next 
Saturday’s paper.

This week’s question:

My local salon has shut after years of doing a wash and cut for £40. The next 
nearest charges £60 and thinks I should go far more often. Should I switch to 
£20 Supercuts deals (are they any good?) or accept that as a woman I have to 
pay a small fortune?
