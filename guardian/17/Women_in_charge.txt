Going back through some of my long-ago columns to see if there was anything 
that needs saying again, I came across one that discussed what happens when a 
man and a woman achieve something together.

I wrote that Bedford College in London used to have a brilliant reputation and 
only female students; when it admitted men it got a male principal. When
Felicity Green 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/feb/13/women-national-newspapers>
, the only woman director in Fleet Street, left IPC for Vidal Sassoon, it meant 
that with women making up half the readers and many contributors, the 
newspapers of Fleet Street had no women on boards at all.

I wrote that it was not so much the inevitability of patriarchy that was the 
trouble, it’s the way men cannot be stopped from finding other men more normal. 
I quoted Michael Korda, who said in his bookSuccess! that it is usually 
attributed to the man; he also said that if a woman ever becomes president of 
the United States, it would suddenly be the vice president, if male, who would 
be considered really important.

Well, maybe we shall see, if Hillary Clinton gets in, if he is right, but the 
good news is that nowadays it may not be so. Angela Merkel’s actions and 
achievements are not attributed to anyone else in Germany or anywhere else, and 
it is Christine Lagarde who is known to run the International Monetary Fund.

Women <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> have always been 
allowed to be in charge of things that were for women only – convents, ladies’ 
magazines, schools and, time was, nursing; but increasingly there’s no knowing 
where women may be found running things, and no one ever suggested, did they, 
that there had to be a man telling Mrs Thatcher what to do? We’ll just have to 
wait and see what advice our current prime minister accepts.
