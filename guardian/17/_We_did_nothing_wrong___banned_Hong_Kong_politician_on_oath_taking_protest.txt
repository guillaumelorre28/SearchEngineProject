A 25-year-old pro-independence activist who has been disqualified from Hong 
Kong’s parliament has said she has no regrets over the crisis unleashed by her 
decision to defy Beijing.

Yau Wai-ching, one of the leading figures of the Youngspiration party, became 
the youngest woman to be elected to the former colony’s legislative council in 
early September.


But her decision, along with fellow Youngspiration activist Sixtus “Baggio” 
Leung,to criticise China during a dramatic swearing-in ceremony 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/hong-kong-pro-democracy-oath-snub-china>
 last month, has sparked a bitter political row.


On Tuesday, one week after Beijing took highly controversial steps 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/07/china-bans-hong-kong-pro-independence-politicians-crisis-grows>
 to stop the pair taking office by tightening up the rules around the 
swearing-in ceremony, Hong Kong’s high courtofficially disqualified the two 
activists from assuming their positions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/15/hong-kong-bans-pro-democracy-politicians-after-beijing-rewrites-oath-law>
 in a move that is likely to provoke further protests.

Speaking to the Guardian just before the ruling, Yau said she stood by her 
actions.


“We didn’t do anything wrong,” she said in an interview in the parliamentary 
office she must now vacate. “This is just whatChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> must do to maintain their 
dictatorship, so we don’t think it is our fault.”

On Tuesday, Yau told reporters outside Hong Kong’s high court that the ruling 
was not fair, “but it was expected”. She said: “[Since] the court adopted such 
measures to strip us of our lawmaker qualifications, I think you all have an 
idea what kind of society this is.”


As recently as two years ago, Yau would never have anticipated playing a key 
role in one of the most severe political crises sinceHong Kong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong> was returned to Chinese hands in 
1997.

The pro-independence politician said her civil servant parents disapproved of 
television, so she turned to books. She studied Chinese classics at university 
where she penned her own versions, featuring homosexual relationships, of 
imperial love stories.

After university, Yau got a job processing applications at the Hong Kong 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
Umbrella movement explainer 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/explainer-interactive/embed/embed.html?id=b5638b1f-7f1e-49d4-b76a-fb375dccfa17>
It was only in 2012 that she had her first brush with politics, taking part in 
marches against proposed reforms to Hong Kong’s education system that critics 
said was a Communist party attempt to brainwash the city’s youth.


Yau’s full immersion into the world of politics came during the 79-day 
umbrella movement street occupation, in 2014, in which tens of thousands of 
Hong Kong residents took to the streets to demand greater democratic rights.

Yau recalls looking on and feeling compelled to act as students, some of them 
still in secondary school, attempted to storm the legislature. “I thought I 
should take part instead of those students, they shouldn’t have to bear such a 
big responsibility. Adults like us should take more of a part.”

When the umbrella protests ended, Yau decided to throw herself into 
conventional politics, first running unsuccessfully for a district council seat 
and thenwinning a seat in the 70-member legislature in early September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/hong-kong-poll-pro-independence-activists-poised-to-win-seats-in-record-turnout>
.


She should have taken office last month following an oath-taking session on 12 
October 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/hong-kong-pro-democracy-oath-snub-china>
. But rather than read the formal oath, Yau and Leung sparked outrage in 
Beijing by holding up banners that read “Hong Kong is not China”. Yau went even 
further, declaring allegiance to a place she called the “People’s Refucking of 
Shina”.

Hong Kong politicians defy China as they are sworn in 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/12/hong-kong-politicians-defy-china-as-they-are-sworn-in-video>
The incident outraged pro-Chinese opponents in the legislature and officials 
in Beijing. “It’s a tradition for the lawmakers to do something in the 
oath-taking session, so we did something, but we didn’t expect this reaction,” 
Yau said.

Weeks of protests and vitriolic attacks from her critics have followed. One 
politician labelled Yau a “cancer cell” while a pro-China scholar referred to 
her asa “festering pustule” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/07/festering-pustules-two-pro-democracy-activists-targets-chinas-wrath>
.


Even some pro-democracy activists and voters criticised her use of offensive 
language while still opposing China’s response to the incident.

Eddie Chu, another newly elected politician who has promised to fight for 
greater autonomy from China, said the behaviour of Yau and Leung had “triggered 
a retaliation from Beijing”.

“But it would have come sooner or later … Beijing will try to create an 
atmosphere where a lot of pro-democracy legislators are in a firing range and 
they can pull the trigger whenever they want,” he said.


Chu, who shouted “Democracy and self-determination. Autocracy will die!” 
during the same swearing-in ceremony, is also in a vulnerable position in the 
current crisis. Pro-Beijing supporters are pushing for a review of whether he 
and seven other legislators should also be disqualified from office because of 
their protests at the oath-taking ceremony.


“I’m not worried at all,” Chu insisted of the potential case against him, 
which has yet to be accepted by the court. “I still have popular support.”

In a sign of Beijing’s concern over growing support for the idea of 
independence in Hong Kong, President Xi Jinping recentlydeclared that 
separating the country would be a “tragedy” 
<http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-11/12/content_27354289.htm>.

“We will never allow any person, any organisation, any political party, at any 
time, in any way, to split from any part of China’s territory,” he said.

Yau said she and her pro-independence supporters were a product of China’s 
hardline stance in dealing with issues it considers its “core interests”.

“There will be a trend for more Hongkongers to be localist,” she said, using a 
term associated with a younger generation that hopes to distance the city 
politically fromChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china>. “If the 
government will keep up their actions and attitudes towards the public, most 
Hongkongers will turn into localists in the next few years.

 “If they don’t respect the values of Hongkongers, they can’t expect 
Hongkongers to fully obey.”

She claimed that moderate pro-democracy politicians and activists had achieved 
little by working within Hong Kong’s traditional political system. As a result 
she believed independence or “self-determination” were now the only ways to 
wrestle genuine democracy from Beijing. “We have to find another way to get 
what we want,” she said.

Political observers, however, fear the political climate in Hong Kong is 
likely to deteriorate as Beijing will not compromise with those daring to call 
for a split with China.


“This is going to put a constraint on freedom of speech in Hong Kong,” said Ma 
Ngok, a politics professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Now 
political speech can get you disqualified from office … It shows that China 
doesn’t care about the reaction of the people in Hong Kong.”
