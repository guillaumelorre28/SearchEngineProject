Background

Zinke is a Republican congressman from Montana who was elected to his second 
term representing the Treasure State in November.

A former Navy Seal who retired in 2008, Zinke has long emphasized his service 
in the armed forces. However, a former superior of Zinke’sraised questions

in an interview with the New York Times about whether the Montana congressman 
exaggerated the scope of his responsibilities while deployed in Iraq.

Zinke has a track record

 as an ardent supporter of conservation within the GOP and has fought efforts 
by fellow Republicans to sell off public lands. However, Zinke is skeptical on 
the issue of climate change,saying in a 2014 debate

: “It’s not a hoax, but it’s not proven science either.”

Senate Democrats have a particular political motivation to support Zinke’s 
nomination. Zinke had long been mooted as a potential challenger to incumbent 
Democratic senator Jon Tester in 2018. In being appointed to the cabinet, it 
removes the Republican seen to be Tester’s most formidable rival for 
re-election in Montana.

Key points to watch for

 * Climate change: In light of the president-elect’s longstanding skepticism 
about mankind contributing to climate change, senators are likely to try to pin 
down Zinke on this issue.

 * Drilling on public lands: The interior department oversees public lands in 
the US and, in particular, the permit process for those private companies 
seeking to drill for oil or natural gas there. Trump has long supported 
increased energy exploration on public land, including national parks.
