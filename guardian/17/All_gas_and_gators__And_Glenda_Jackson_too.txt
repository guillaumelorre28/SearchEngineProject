One of the reasons why relatively few people change energy supplier (Millions 
stuck on ‘rip-off’ energy tariffs, data reveals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/ofgem-energy-league-table-price-comparison>
, 15 December) is that price comparison is made more difficult by the standing 
daily charge that the energy companies include in their bills. The government 
could help us all by making this illegal. Then there would be a single figure 
to compare: the charge for a unit of electricity or its equivalent for gas.

, 15 December) did say that more than half of all the jobs created by UK 
employers this year went to EU workers, this is hardly surprising. At the 
moment, every UK citizen who works here is an EU worker.

• Rod Edmond (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/13/welcome-revival-of-robert-louis-stevenson-samoa-tales>
, 14 December) mentions a radio adaptation by Dylan Thomas of The Beach of 
Falesa by Robert Louis Stevenson and wonders if it was ever broadcast. In fact, 
an adaptation of Thomas’s screenplay of the story was first broadcast on BBC
