Your excellent summary (What this year could hold for public services 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/03/society-2017-prisons-homelessness-welfare-reforms-nhs-social-care>
, 4 January) had much useful analysis on how the NHS and other state services 
may be “brought to the brink”. Your readers may also wish to know that the 
House of Commons is currently considering a bill that will remove the duty to 
have local safeguarding children boards, the well-established multi-agency 
groups across the country that coordinate safeguarding and assure its 
effectiveness. Our government says the children and social work bill “creates 
new, more flexible partnership arrangements to protect children locally” but 
there are serious concerns that such “freedoms” will place children in danger – 
like the one that the Lords recently rejected regarding local authorities being 
“offered freedom” through this bill not to comply with the Children Act. The 
“flexible” arrangements offered by this bill also reduce the statutory 
requirement for the currently large range of agencies to work together in 
safeguarding to only three – and schools, our most important safeguarders of 
children, will not be included.

The parliament website recently gave short notice that the public, and any 
interested bodies, may send in their views by 17 January
