Britain borrowed more than expected in the last financial year as local 
councils sought to fill the gap created by deep budget cuts by dipping into 
reserves and increasing their debts.

Local authorities borrowed £6bn, more than £4bn higher than the previous 12 
months, offsetting bumper tax receipts and a clampdown on central government 
spending.

The figures were another blow to George Osborne’s attempts to eliminate the 
deficit

, which hit £74bn in the 2015-16 financial year, almost £2bn more than the 
official forecast of £72.2bn from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in 
last month’s budget.

In 2010 the chancellor expected the deficit to be more than two-thirds lower 
at £20bn. But he has since been knocked off course by the negative effects of 
his own austerity measures on growth, the 2012 eurozone crisis and the slowdown 
in China.

Renewed momentum in the last year has brought the deficit down by almost 
£18bn, which the Treasury said came after the lowest monthly borrowing in March 
for a decade.

Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the 
trend in public borrowing has improved over recent months, but the lagging 
nature of the public finances “suggests that they have not registered yet the 
impact ofthe recent economic slowdown

”.

The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing excluding 
the bailed-out banks was £4.8bn in March, well below the £7.4bn in March 2015 
and better than the consensus among City analysts of a £6bn shortfall.In 
February 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/22/uk-governments-borrowing-target-adrift-after-fall-in-tax-receipts>
, public sector borrowing fell by just £500m to £7.1bn compared with the same 
month last year.

During the year to March tax receipts grew by 5.4%, from 4.7% in February. The 
improvement was broad-based, with income tax receipts up 4.9%, VAT receipts up 
5.2% and corporation tax receipts up 3.0%. Meanwhile, central government 
current expenditure rose just 0.8% year-over-year.


Tombs warned of a growing risk of a much bigger overshoot this year because 
the economy has slowed, with a slowdown in tax receipts likely.

“With the fiscal projections also resting on optimistic assumptions for 
revenues from tax avoidance measures and savings from the welfare budget, we 
continue to think that the chancellor will have to implement even more 
austerity than planned to achieve a budget surplus by 2020.”


Howard Archer, the chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said Osborne would 
“probably be pretty relieved” that a much improved March performance meant that 
he missed the OBR’s target by only a narrow margin.


“Furthermore, he can argue that the public finance data will be revised many 
times over the coming months so there is a realistic chance that the final 
figure will show that he achieved his targets,” said Archer.

The Treasury said: “Today’s figures confirm that the record postwar deficit we 
inherited has been cut by almost two-thirds as a share of GDP.


“We are borrowing £18bn less than last year and March’s monthly borrowing was 
the lowest for a decade. But while the deficit is falling, the job of repairing 
the public finances is not done and the budget set out action to ensure that 
debt falls in 2016-17 and Britain is back in the black by the end of this 
parliament.”

The total national debt has now hit £1,594.1bn, equivalent to 83.5% of GDP, up 
from about 40% before the 2008 financial crash.
