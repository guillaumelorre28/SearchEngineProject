Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to 
help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next 
Saturday’s paper.

This week’s question

We are about to move house and have been getting quotes from various removal 
firms. The cost of getting the company to do all the packing – about £300 or 
more – is quite high and we think we will do it ourselves. If you’ve done it 
would you do it again, or was it more a case of “never again”? How hard can it 
be to put some crockery in boxes – or are we missing something here?

What do you think?
