A decade ago our first multiple-signatory “toxic childhood” press letter 
described how children’s health and wellbeing were being undermined by the 
decline of outdoor play, increasingly screen-based lifestyles, a 
hyper-competitive schooling system and the unremitting commercialisation of 
childhood.

Despite widespread public concern, subsequent policymaking has been 
half-hearted, short-termist and disjointedly ineffective. The above factors 
continue to affect children adversely, with “school and cool” displacing 
active, self-directed play at an ever-earlier age. Physical health problems 
like obesity continue to escalate, and mental health problems among children 
and young people are approaching crisis levels. As well as the intense distress 
caused to families, there are obviously longer-term social and economic 
consequences for society as a whole.

Experts call for official guidelines on child screen use

If children are to develop the self-regulation and emotional resilience 
required to thrive in modern technological culture, they need unhurried 
engagement with caring adults and plenty of self-directed outdoor play, 
especially during their early years (0–7). We therefore urge the government to 
take immediate action, including:

• The development of a coherent, well-funded approach to care and education 
from pre-birth to age seven, including a kindergarten stage for three- to 
seven-year-olds emphasising social and emotional development and outdoor play.

• National guidelines on screen-based technology for children up to the age of 
12, produced by recognised authorities in child health and development.

We also recommend the appointment of a cabinet-level minister for children, 
remaining in post for a full parliament, whose department audits all government 
policies for their impact on children’s health and wellbeing; or as an absolute 
minimum, the setting up of a non-party-political standing conference on 
children’s health and wellbeing, meeting and reporting regularly to parliament.

Without concerted action, our children’s physical and mental health will 
continue to deteriorate, with long-term results for UK society that are frankly 
unthinkable.
