Bird flu has been confirmed in a flock of about 6,000 turkeys at a farm in 
Lincolnshire, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) 
has said. The H5N8 strain of avian flu – the same as that found in aflock of 
turkeys on a nearby farm on 16 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/16/bird-flu-louth-turkey-farm-lincolnshire-h5n8>
 – was confirmed by the UK’s chief veterinary officer, Nigel Gibbens.

A number of birds at the farm in East Lindsey have died, and those remaining 
will be culled. The two cases are unlikely to be linked, but an investigation 
is under way, Defra said.

A 3km protection zone and 10km surveillance zone have been put in place around 
the affected farm to limit the risk of the disease spreading. It comes after 
H5N8 avian flu was found in flocks in Carmarthenshire, south west Wales, and 
Settle, North Yorkshire, earlier this month.
