A Russian man was killed and his friend seriously injured after their ride 
down a ski slope in a giant inflatable zorb ball turned to disaster.

A harrowing video <http://lifenews.ru/news/109149> captures the victim, 
27-year-old Denis Burakov, and his friend Vladimir Shcherbakov, 33, setting off 
in the ball at a resort in the Caucasus mountains.

The ride starts promisingly. But the zorb quickly veers off course, with one 
man unsuccessfully trying to stop it. It then hurtles leftwards down a ravine. 
Onlookers watch in horror, one asking: "What's down there?" A voice replies: 
"Nothing. Catastrophe."

The zorb continued rolling for about half a mile before finally coming to a 
halt near a frozen lake. The emergencies ministry said both men were ejected 
from the tumbling zorb, and landed on the snow about 10 metres apart.

Rescuers could reach the two tourists only by skiing down a sheer, rocky 
gully. They dragged the men back up the hill. Burakov died on the way to 
hospital from spinal injuries; Shcherbakov suffered concussion and remains in 
hospital.

The Russian authorities have opened a criminal case into the accident 
<http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2101769>, which took place in Mount Musa 
Achitara, a resort in Dombai, in the southern republic of Karachayâ€“Cherkessia. 
Police are seeking the zorb's owner.

Burakov, a keen snowboarder, and Shcherbakov, were the first people to try out 
the ball, which had been set up just an hour earlier next to a beginner's slope,
Russian websites reported <http://www.newsru.com/russia/09jan2013/zorb.html>. 
Their trip to the resort, on 3 January, was supposed to be a new year's treat.

The accident prompted the head of the national emergency rescue services to 
demand thatRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> tighten its 
enforcement of safety rules for winter sports, citing a series of accidents 
over the January holidays.

Sergei Loginov, deputy director of Z-orb.ru, the largest supplier of zorbs in 
Russia, said the zorbing run that killed Burakov had been conducted in 
violation of all safety rules.

Zorbing requires a smooth, gentle slope, with fences on both sides of the 
track and a secure spot at the bottom where the ball can be safely be brought 
to rest, he said; none of these elements were present at Dombai.

"It's not even irresponsibility. It's an experiment on life," Loginov said. 
"It's all or nothing. They either survive or they don't."

The sport of zorbing originated in the 1990s in New Zealand 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorbing>, and is now done around the world.
