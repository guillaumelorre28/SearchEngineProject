A Conservative MP who faced heavy criticism after claiming that the justice 
system was skewed to discriminate against men has been elected on to a 
parliamentary committee that scrutinises issues linked to women’s rights and 
equality.

Philip Davies, whose claim that “feminist zealots really do want women to have 
their cake and eat it”was exposed by the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/pressure-mounts-on-may-to-respond-to-philip-davies-feminist-zealots-comment>
 in August, was elected unopposed to fill a Tory place in the grouping.

The decision led to an outcry on Twitter with Sophie Walker, the leader of the 
Women’sEquality <https://www.theguardian.com/society/equality> party, one of 
the first to respond:

Labour’s outspoken MP renowned for her feminist views, Jess Phillips said: 
“I’ll not be standing in the way of it. I have every faith that the 
intelligence and skills of those on the committee will mean he will have little 
effect, much like in the rest of his career.”

 The Labour Party said that select committees were matters for MPs, while 
Labour MP, Gavin Shuker, announced the news and then added: “Just let that sink 
in for a minute.”

Others called it a “sick joke” or “another finger up to the people of the 
country”.

One tweeter, known as the secret barrister, pointed out that Davies was a man 
whose priority was to send more women to prison. Others, who also consider 
themselves anti-feminist, cheered the outcome.

The MP for Shipley will join a committee chaired by the former women’s 
minister and campaigner on equality issues, Maria Miller.

The committee is investigating inequalities faced by Gypsy, Roma and Traveller 
communities, ensuring strong equalities after Brexit, disability, women in the
House of Commons <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons> and 
employment opportunities for Muslims.
