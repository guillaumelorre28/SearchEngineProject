The typical British employee can expect to spend more than £14,000 during 
their working life on the daily costs of being in the office, including 
afternoon tea runs, cards and gifts for leaving colleagues and sponsorship for 
co-workers’ charitable pursuits, according to research.

A survey of 2,000 office workers across the UK found that the combined cost of 
Christmas parties and dinners, cards and presents, coffees and teas, 
sponsorship requests and secret Santa totalled more than £350 a year.

Over the course of a 40-year career, that would amount to about £14,500, 
according to Nationwide Current Account, which carried out the survey.

The study found that the inclusion of parties and nights out with colleagues 
and office clothing pushed the average costto just over £1,000 a year– or about 
£40,000 over the course of a 40-year working life.

Men generally tend to be unhappier than women about spending money at work, 
but women are more likely to feel pressured into paying out for work-related 
items.


Two-fifths (42%) of men were unhappy about spending money at work Christmas 
parties, compared with 34% of women. But one in five women said they felt under 
pressure to spend money at Christmas parties, compared with just 12% of men.

Overall, more than a quarter of people surveyed said they felt pressured when 
it came to contributing towards birthday and leaving gifts, with 28% feeling 
this way about birthday presents and 27% of people saying this about gifts for 
colleagues who were leaving.

Nearly a third (32%) said they felt pressured into contributing money to help 
their colleagues’ charity fundraising efforts.

One in 10 people surveyed spent time with their colleagues outside working 
hours on a weekly basis, but 35% of office workers surveyed said they did not 
like to socialise with their colleagues after work.

Alan Oliver, Nationwide’s head of external affairs, said: “Working in an 
office can be an expensive business, especially in big teams. While most people 
value the camaraderie of working in a team, birthdays, retirements and charity 
fundraisers can take their toll on our wallets and purses.”
