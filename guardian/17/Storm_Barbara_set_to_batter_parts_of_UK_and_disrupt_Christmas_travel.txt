Gusts of up to 90mph are set to batter parts of Scotland, northern England and 
Northern Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> over 
Christmas as Storm Barbara wreaks havoc over the festive period.

Forecasters have warned that power supplies may be hit, ferries delayed and 
bridges closed due to strong winds on Friday and Christmas Eve.

Western and northern Scotland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> are 
expected to be worst-affected by the gale-force winds – overnight on Friday.

An amber weather warning – meaning be prepared – is in place for the Scottish 
highlands and Shetlands, where gusts of 80-90mph are forecast into Christmas 
Eve.

Parts of Northern Ireland and northern England will also be hit, the Met 
Office has warned, with gales of between 60mph and 80mph expected on Friday and 
the early hours of Christmas Eve.

Forecasters said Storm Barbara had the potential to disrupt travel over the 
Christmas period and urged people to make alternative plans.


Nicky Maxey, from the Met Office, said: “It has the potential to be quite 
disruptive so we would urge people to think about their travel arrangements if 
they’re trying to get away for Christmas.

“There is a risk that it could disrupt power supplies, bring disruption to 
ferries and flights, bring restrictions on bridges – it’s quite important 
people think about their travel arrangements as much as they can.”

The gusts could cause chaos on the roads for the 3.5 million drivers predicted 
by the RAC to be planning a Christmas getaway on Friday, with 3.8 million 
expected to take to the roads on Christmas Eve.

Snowfall of up to 10cm has been forecast in upland areas of western and 
central Highlands.

Ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne has said 21 of its 26 routes had already 
been disrupted by the weather, with several services cancelled.
