A vast 14th-century monks’ dormitory with original oak-beamed ceiling is the 
centrepiece of a £10.9m permanent exhibition charting Christian history and 
culture in the north-east of England, which opens to the public at Durham 
Cathedral at the weekend.

Artefacts dating from the 3rd century onwards, including burial stones, 
preaching crosses and medieval manuscripts – some of which have never before 
been displayed – will be on show atOpen Treasure 
<https://www.durhamcathedral.co.uk/open-treasure>, which opens on Saturday. 


Next year, the coffin and cross of St Cuthbert, the 7th century missionary 
monk who travelled through northern England, are due to be put on display in 
climate-controlled conditions under a soaring vaulted stone roof that was once 
in the monastery’s great kitchen. Cuthbert’s remains are buried in the 
cathedral grounds.


“It has been an incredibly complex project, and I am in awe and wonder of the 
splendours of this space. This is a seminal moment in the life of the 
cathedral,” said Andrew Tremlett, the new dean of Durham Cathedral, who took up 
his post last Sunday. The exhibition tells “the history and culture which has 
shaped the north-east of England”, he added.

Open Treasure, which has taken more than three years to create, opens up 
hidden spaces within the cathedral – which itself is a Unesco world heritage 
site along with the adjacent castle – that were previously inaccessible to 
visitors.

The medieval dormitory, once housing dozens of sparse, narrow cubicles in 
which Benedictine monks slept and studied, became a library in the 19th 
century. Now it combines ancient artefacts with interactive technology to allow 
visitors to smell the scents of monastic life, such as tallow, beeswax, incense 
and malted barley.


The exhibition charts the monks’ days, which began at 6am and ended with 
strict silence from 7.30pm, while their nights were interrupted by an hour of 
prayer from midnight. They subsisted on a diet of mostly fish and bread.


A collections gallery, hermetically sealed with airlock doors, provides 
carefully controlled environmental conditions for fragile items in their glass 
display cabinets – including fish bones found embedded in the floor of the 
great kitchen and unexpectedly worldly betting slips found in the monks’ 
quarters.


The roof stones of the octagonal kitchen, which contains eight fireplaces, 
have been carefully cleaned. A large central display cabinet, currently 
containing the cathedral’s plate collection, will next year become the home of 
Cuthbert’s highly decorated but battered coffin once tests have been carried 
out to ensure visitors won’t upset the controlled climate.


The Normans began building a hilltop monastery in 1093 on the site of 
Cuthbert’s shrine at Durham. It was surrendered to the crown in 1539 during the 
reformation, but re-founded two years later. In 1650, the cathedral was closed 
for worship when Oliver Cromwell incarcerated 3,000 Scottish soldiers there 
after the Battle of Dunbar. Mass graves containing many of the soldiers’ bodies 
were discovered in 2013.

“The exhibition will locate Durham Cathedral in an unbroken timeline from the 
9th century to the present day,” said Tremlett. “Visitors will get a sense of 
being connected to history.”


Cathedral officials hope that 120,000 of the cathedral’s annual 750,000 
visitors will buy tickets for Open Treasure, which will cost £7.50 for adults 
and £2.50 for children.

The cathedral has running costs of about £10,000 per day, said Ivor Stolliday, 
its treasurer, and an additional £40m is needed over the next 15 years to 
repair and renovate the building. “The exhibition is designed to create a 
surplus to help with the very considerable costs of the cathedral,” said 
Stolliday.


Tremlett, previously vice-dean of Westminster Abbey, which charges adults £20 
to enter, said that only 15% of the London cathedral’s visitors were from the 
UK.


“At Durham, the vast majority of visitors are UK citizens – so we have more 
Britons visiting here than Westminster Abbey. If we can maintain Durham 
Cathedral as free to enter while also generating revenue, that’s the best of 
both worlds,” he said.


On Thursday, the government announced grants of £14.5m for urgent repairs to 
Church of England and Catholic cathedrals in England. Thirty-two cathedrals 
will receive sums of between £15,000 and £870,000, with the largest grant going 
to Coventry Cathedral. Durham received a grant of £599,000 for belfry repairs.


“Cathedrals are the beating hearts of their communities, offering sanctuary, 
beauty, collective history, and social and economic support to people of every 
generation,” said Fiona Reynolds, chair of the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for 
England.


Cathedrals were “jewels in the centres of their cities” and showcases to the 
nation, she added.

Cathedral was not among the recipients of the government grants announced on 
Thursday.
