When my boss, and her boss, beckoned me to follow them to the meeting room 
downstairs, I picked up a notepad and pen and braced myself for a boring chat 
about press releases. It was a chilly, grey Friday in the middle of January, 
and I really just wanted to get through the day without incident so I could go 
to the pub.

If my superiors seemed tense or sombre, I didn’t really notice. My boss 
started with, “So, we’ve been having a chat …” and I made a thoughtful, 
attentive face and uncapped a biro before processing the last part of her 
sentence, which was “ ... and it’s not really working with you here, is it?” 
What wasn’t working? The biro?

Her boss took over. “You’ve got some great ideas, and you’re a good writer, 
but you’re not doing the job we hired you to do. We need a person who is really 
hot on organisation, and you’ve said yourself that it’s not your strong point.”

His eyes rested on the exposed inches of my lower back – I’d left my belt at 
my boyfriend’s house that morning, and my jeans did not meet my jumper. “We’ll 
give you next month’s pay, and references. You can always tell people this was 
just an internship.” Finally, I got it. My eyes shone and my lower lip wobbled. 
Awkwardly, my boss – ex-boss now – patted my hand. “One day, this moment will 
go in your memoirs.”

Even as a grandiose, delusional 22-year-old with a rich fantasy life, I 
thought her comment was ridiculous. However, not quite 10 years later I have 
written a book – my third book – which features an account of the incident. 
(It’s calledHow to Be a Grown Up 
<https://www.headline.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781472238849>, and will be 
published next spring.)

If I had been slightly better at working in PR, if I’d kept my head down and 
made more coffees and learned how to send mass emails without accidentally 
addressing every journalist as “Dear Simon”, there’s a chance I’d still be 
there, miserable and bookless.

The passing of time has made me realise that I’m not the heroine of this 
anecdote, and my bosses were not baddies. No human being has ever been as bad 
at anything as I was at that job. They were right to fire me.

 ‘My understanding of PR was entirely based on the film Sliding Doors’ 
The previous summer, I’d graduated from university with an upper second in 
English literature. I’d spent the three years vacillating between arrogance and 
panic. Of course I’d do OK in the end. I always did! But what if I didn’t? I’d 
had plenty of confidence wobbles at school, but I tended to come out on top 
afterwards.

At university, the work was much harder, and I spent more time resenting its 
difficulty than actually applying myself. Getting a degree against all the odds 
served to bolster my noxious privilege, my James I-style sense that I deserved 
a happy ending as long as I worried enough during the second act.

Being the first of my friends to find a “proper” job seemed to confirm this. 
Admittedly, my understanding of PR was entirely based on the filmSliding Doors 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/24/television>, and I didn’t really 
want a career in it. However, the idea of pursuing my actual dreams, and 
writing for a living, seemed laughable. I’d really have to compete for that 
sort of job! I’d have failed before I got started.

Getting fired taught me that I’m not the sort of person who 'deserves' a happy 
ending. I deserve nothing

Getting fired taught me that I’m not the sort of person who “deserves” a happy 
ending. I deserve nothing. I made a poor choice, I was ill-suited to the role, 
I hadn’t tried hard enough – and it was up to me to deal with the consequences.

It also showed me there’s no virtue or validation that comes from 
compromising. It’s not fair to anyone to graciously make them your second 
choice. When everything goes wrong – and it will – they won’t choose you back.

I was lucky enough to be able to move back to my parents’ house and to find 
work temping in acall centre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/13/secret-life-call-centre-worker>
. And while there, my dream job was advertised. It was a features internship at 
a teen magazine, and I longed to work there with a ferocity that made me 
miserable. Everyone would want it! What was the point of applying?

Still, I had no Plan B to hide behind, and nothing left to lose. My editor 
told me she decided to give me the job when I told her I’d rather work for her 
than at Vogue. I meant it.

I had been knocked off a straightforward career path and forced to find my own 
way through the woods. Now, as a freelance writer, I do a job I love. I think I 
deserve it, but I’ve worked hard to earn it, getting up early, writing at 
weekends, constantly doing everything I can to demonstrate my enthusiasm and 
commitment to my choice. Losing my job taught me the world doesn’t owe me a 
living. Failing badly was the motivation I needed to try my luck, and follow my 
passions.
