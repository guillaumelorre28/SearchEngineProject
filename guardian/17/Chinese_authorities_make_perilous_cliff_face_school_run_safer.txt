Authorities in south-west China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> have 
come to the aid of schoolchildren who had to climb an 800m cliff to get to and 
from school – by installing a thin steel ladder at the site.

Atuler, a mountainside hamlet nicknamed “cliff village”, is located on a 
plateau in the Chinese province of Sichuan and is home to the Yi people, a 
minority ethnic group also found in Vietnam and Thailand.

Fears arose for the schoolchildren after images of their 90-minute descent to 
the school at the bottom of the cliff went viral earlier this year

Api Jiti, the head of the 72-family impoverished farming community, told 
Beijing News that “seven or eight” villagers had plunged to their deaths after 
losing their grip during the climb.

Until now, wooden ladders were the secluded village’s only way to reach the 
outside world, with children forced to scale the rock face to get down to their 
school.


Residents reported that the ladders were hundreds of years old and only 
replaced when one of them was found to be rotting.

So perilous was the climb that a Chinese reporter who was once dispatched to 
the villageburst into tears as she attempted

the ascent.

The photographer behind the original pictures, Chen Jie, described the moment 
he first witnessed the schoolchildren, aged between six and 15, scaling the 
cliff. “There is no doubt I was shocked by the scene I saw in front of me,”he 
wrote 
<https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3Mzg3MDczOA==&mid=2653595092&idx=1&sn=4d0ffe57dfcd0608c6afef3c17dc496e&scene=1&srcid=0527NPqY14iX0In9cHVTmNvR&key=8d8120cb97983fad752e3739d8d885fef8e3662eba4a37e6b5ae71199884c51ca07238e7b00423f75849abc3d7e755aa&ascene=0&uin=MjM3MDgzOTg2MA%3D%3D&devicetype=iMac+MacBookAir7%2C1+OSX+OSX+10.10.5+build%2814F1808%29&version=11020201&pass_ticket=Z9Z%2B9QDdySc2x%2B1dB3ZJKSWHLtIbSBCOjh3lh5mcP4mlCOfuKPyvJFQAMjzVKARU>
, adding that he hoped his photographs could help change the village’s “painful 
reality”.


Jiti said there had been insufficient room to build a school on the 
mountaintop. The government subsequently promised to take action, and the 
region’s Communist party secretary said a steel staircase would be built to 
connect the deprived hamlet with the outside world while a permanent solution 
was found.

The ladder was finally put in place earlier this month. 

While the climb remains difficult, locals said the ladder has made a 
significant difference, and the climb now takes an hour less than it used to.
