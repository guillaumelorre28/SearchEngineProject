Forget Strictly, this is the season of dancing animals. All things furry and 
animated - from panto horses to balletic hippos and pirouetting mice - come out 
atChristmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> time. Children 
are captivated – and we are, too. This is down to more than cultural tradition. 
It’s also biological. We identify with animal movement because the wiring that 
connects our limbs to our spines is so similar. Even though we walk on two legs 
and animals on four, our basic movements are controlled by very similar 
circuits.

We use our body control systems to help us see and understand theirs. For 
example, the areas of our brain that respond to seeing a human biting something 
are also sensitive to watching a monkey or a dog biting. And this resonance is 
part of the way we appreciate the emotions of other species. It helps us to 
anthropomorphise, whether we want to or not. We automatically identify and 
empathise with a frightened rabbit whether it’s on a country walk or a theatre 
stage. So it’s no wonder we are fascinated by animal motion, and so drawn to 
festive performances likePeter and the Wolf. Even if we pretend it’s the kids 
that make us go.
