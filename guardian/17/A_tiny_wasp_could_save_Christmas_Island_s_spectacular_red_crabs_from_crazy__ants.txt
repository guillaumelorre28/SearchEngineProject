Have you heard the one about the wasp that kills the bug that feeds the ants 
that kill the crabs that keep the forests healthy onChristmas Island 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/christmas-island>?

If not, that’s because it hasn’t happened yet, but it is a tale worth telling.

In the coming weeks, Parks Australia will release a 2mm wasp on Christmas 
Island to control the island’s yellow crazy ant infestation. Crazy ants are a 
big threat to the island’s wildlife, including its famous red crabs.


Biological control – when we use one species to control another – is infamous 
for giving Australia its cane toad invasion. So, how do we know this one will 
work?

Christmas Island and its crabs

Christmas Island is a unique natural habitat with many endemic species. The 
national park covers two-thirds of the island, which has been referred to as 
the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean.

Many people are aware of the red crabs 
<http://www.parksaustralia.gov.au/christmas/people-place/red-crabs.html> whose 
mass migration to the sea has been described as one of the wonders of the 
natural world.

 Red crabs on Christmas Island 
Christmas Island has many other species of crabs, including the impressive 
robber crabs <http://www.christmasislandcrabs.com/anomuran-crabs>. These may be 
the largest land-dwelling arthropod (the group that insects and crustaceans 
belong to) on earth.

Together these abundant land crabs clear the forests of leaf litter and 
maintain burrows that prevent soil becoming compacted, creating an open and 
diverse forest.

But this thriving natural system was disrupted when an invasive ant species 
became abundant on the island.

The ants

In the early 20th century, yellow crazy ants 
<https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/898583db-b929-491a-8448-73fb652bca66/files/brochure-detail-crazy-ant-control-options.pdf>
 (Anoplolepis gracilipes) found their way to Christmas Island. These ants now 
form super-colonies, with billions of individuals across hundreds of hectares.

The crazy ants spray formic acid in the eyes and leg joints of the crabs, 
which immobilises them. The crabs soon die and become food for the ants.

In some cases, crabs that live in areas free of crazy ants are killed during 
their annual migration and so never return to their original forest. This 
creates crab-free zones even where the ants do not live.

With fewer crabs, the forest has become less diverse, with a dense understory 
and compacted soils due to the collapse of crab burrows. Other invasive species 
such as the giant African land snail have become common where crabs declined.

Parks Australia <https://www.environment.gov.au/resource/crazy-ant-biocontrol> 
has been trying lots of different methods from aerial to hand-baiting to 
reverse the impact of yellow crazy ants on red crabs.

The impact was so severe that a chemical control program targeting the 
super-colonies began in 2001. This program has slowed the decline of crab 
populations but is expensive and time-consuming, so researchers began to look 
into other options, including using other species.

The bug: a scale insect

Super-colonies of yellow crazy ants require a reliable food source and this is 
provided by yet another invasive species: the yellow lac scale insect (
Tachardina aurantiaca).

Scale insects (a type of true bug <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiptera>) 
suck the sap of trees and produce a sweet secretion from their anal pore called 
honeydew, which ants then harvest.

It seems that the super-colonies of these crazy ants could not survive without 
the carbohydrate-rich honeydew provided by abundant scale insects in a patch of 
forest.

There is evidence that the scale insects increase ant reproduction and make 
them more likely to attack other species. One large field experiment 
demonstrated that if we stopped the ants getting access to the scale insects, 
ant activity on the ground fell by 95% in just four weeks.

The scale insects may need the ants as much as the ants need the scale 
insects. Some ants protect the scale insects in the same way that humans 
protect their livestock, by chasing away other predators.

The interaction between these two invasive species has allowed them to build 
their populations to extremely high densities, something known asinvasional 
meltdown <https://conservationbytes.com/2008/10/26/classics-invasion-meltdown/>.

The good news is that scale insects, unlike ants, are amenable to biological 
control. For instance, Australian lady bugs were spectacularly successful in 
controllingthe cottony cushion scale 
<http://gardenbees.com/biological%20control/revolution.htm> in North America.

The wasp

The search began to find a species that could control the scale insect on 
Christmas Island. And we found it: a tiny wasp known asTachardiaephagus 
somervillei, which attacks the yellow lac scale insect in its native Southeast 
Asia.

This wasp lays its eggs in mature female scale insects and kills them from the 
inside, producing more wasps that then lay eggs in more females. This wasp (and 
other predators) are so effective that the yellow lac scale insect is rare in 
its native habitat.

Obviously, we had to test that the wasp wouldn’t attack other species. 
Researchers did this in the field in Malaysia, an unusual approach that yielded 
excellent results. The scientists exposed eight closely related scale insects 
to the wasp, and none were harmed.

This proves that no other scale insect population on Christmas Island is at 
risk if the wasp is introduced, with the possible exception of another 
introduced scale insect that is a pest in its own right.

Researchers also checked that the wasps would still work when the scale 
insects are being tended by yellow crazy ants – and they still attacked. After 
years of research it is exciting to be on the verge of releasing this wasp on 
Christmas Island.

Postscript: the toads

We all know the biological control stories that went wrong. The introduction 
of cane toads to control cane beetles in Australia backfired spectacularly. In 
Hawaii, the introduction of mongooses to control rats failed because mongooses 
are active during the day and the rats were active at night. In both those 
cases, those species were introduced without sufficient research.

But these examples changed the rules and laws around introducing species. 
Today governments are much more aware of the risks of invasive species. 
Rigorous experiments and risk assessments are required before any introduction 
can occur.

In this case, researchers from La Trobe University have worked closely with 
Parks Australia and the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia to collect enough 
data to satisfy the Australian government.

We believe that this is the most closely scrutinised biological control 
project in Australia. When the wasps arrive on Christmas Island in a few weeks, 
we are confident that this will set an example for best-practice conservation.

Fewer ants means more crabs, healthier trees, fewer African snails and better 
soil. And it will save money being spent on expensive conservation efforts for 
years to come.
