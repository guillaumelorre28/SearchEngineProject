I am contacting you on behalf of my elderly aunt, whose son ran up debts 
through various companies then emigrated. As he had no official address at the 
time, he used her address. We have returned all correspondence sent to him as 
“not at this address”, but the bailiffs keep showing up. She does not want to 
give them her son’s address, but is finding the situation really intimidating 
and upsetting. Is there anything to be done to stop these visits? AS Wetherby, 
West Yorkshire

First, her own credit standing is not at risk. According to Experian, even if 
her son had been made bankrupt at her address it would not show up on her 
credit report unless there had been a joint credit activity between them that 
created a link, which is probably unlikely. Getting a copy of her credit report 
will reveal that, it says.

It advises you to write to the debt collectors, informing them he has moved 
on, and asking for written confirmation that they have updated their records.

We would be inclined to tell them his new address which, if it is abroad, 
would likely be the end of the matter. If subsequent to this bailiffs keep 
showing up, then make a formal complaint to each one. If that doesn’t work you 
can then go to the ombudsman and any relevant trade body – for collectors that 
should be theCredit Services Association <http://www.csa-uk.com/>.
