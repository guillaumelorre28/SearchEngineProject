Re Roger Frisby’s experience in Morrisons (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/22/fragile-habitats-but-sturdy-ikea-flatpacks>
, 23 August), at the start of September last year, the first aisle in our 
nearest big Tesco had a “back to school” sign above it, but the shelves were 
filled with special-offer booze, cut-price wine, spirits etc, which had 
replaced the stationery and backpacks. I drew the conclusion that it was aimed 
at teachers.

• Thank you for publishing my occasional letters, the most recent one on the 
difficulty I now have with the cryptic crossword (23 August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/22/fragile-habitats-but-sturdy-ikea-flatpacks>
). I have loved the Guardian and its history since I was a student in the 60s. 
I am now severely deaf with very debilitating tinnitus (my hero was Jack Ashley,
as indicated in a previous letter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/02/the-archers-has-made-us-notorious>
), and when the lovely young Harry rings to say a letter is under 
consideration, a somewhat dark day becomes considerably brighter. He has become 
a part of my family!

• Cryptic crossword? I used to complete the quick crossword over my muesli. 
Now I struggle to finish it by teatime.

• It’s not just the cryptic crossword – the Suguru has taken a step up in 
difficulty recently, too.

• Here is another Olympics statistic (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/23/theresa-may-tops-trump-when-it-comes-to-nukes>
, 24 August): Wales’s tally of 10 medals was their best ever. It is almost a 
sixth of the UK total, yet from a population that is only a 20th of the whole 
UK’s. Wales has outperformed England yet again, as its team did in the football.

• As an occasional visitor to the Isle of Wight, I have never seen any 
evidence of inbreeding (Ofsted’s Hoare quits over Isle of Wight ‘inbreeding’ 
slur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/23/ofsted-chair-david-hoare-quits-after-isle-of-wight-ghetto-remarks>
, 24 August) except during Cowes week.
