Christmas TV ads - the search for a cracker, the fear of a turkey

It might seem too obvious but any list of the best Christmas ads 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/christmas-ads> would not be complete without 
the campaign that has become the most anticipated in the marketing calendar. 
John Lewis’s formula is tried and tested and has spawned any number of parodies 
and copycats. Yet for all the chit-chat itv still delivers in the key area: 
sales.

“The one that started it all, The Long Wait 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBtHj0674Is>, about the boy who just could not 
wait to give his parents their presents on Christmas day, is most people’s 
favourite. But give me the tale of two snowmen any day, a beautifully told and 
moving story of the lengths someone (a snowman) will go to get the right gift 
and completely in line with John Lewis’s ‘thoughtful giving’ brand strapline.”

 Lidly Christmas advert 2015 
The rise of the discounters has a lot to do with their excellent advertising 
andChristmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> is no 
exception. Their greatest trick of all might be convincing people to use them 
over the festive period, when people typically steer away from cheaper brands 
as they look to treat themselves.

“2014’s ‘Surprises’ campaign, featuring a blind taste test of Lidl products, 
is a classic example of using a simple message to help shift perceptions ofLidl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lidl> from a discounter to a grocer 
selling premium products cheaply.”

Currys/PC World – Spare the Act

 Spare the Act 2015 – with Jeff Goldblum. 
Currys PC World tends to use Christmas to push its products but last year, for 
the first time, it tried selling its brand instead. The campaign starred 
Hollywood star Jeff Goldblum and aimed to get across the idea that if you buy 
people the right presents (from Currys or PC World, of course) then they won’t 
have to pretend to like them.

“In a sea of brands trying to copy John Lewis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis> by pulling at the 
heartstrings, Currys PC World’s focus on humour was refreshing and successful, 
so much so they’ve brought it back this year.”

Sainsbury’s – Christmas in a Day

 Sainsbury’s advert 2015 
Back in 2013 Sainsbury’s pulled out all the stops by creating not a single ad 
campaign but a 50-minute film showing how Britain spends Christmas day using 
videos sent in by customers. It featured traditional scenes such as decorating 
the Christmas tree and children waiting for Santa, as well as personal shots 
of, for example, a soldier surprising his kids with an unexpected Christmas 
visit.

“It was a risk, but one that paid off and has given the supermarket the 
confidence to break the mould ever since and, almost, steal the Christmas crown 
from John Lewis.”

 The Warburton’s Xmas ad 
Warburtons joined the Christmas ad battle last year, drafting in the Muppets 
to help flog its new giant crumpets. And it worked. The product launch was one 
of the most successful of last year and helped it win recognition as the ‘top 
Christmas ad’ according to marketresearch company Millward Brown.

“By creating a Christmas campaign with a twist and getting the Muppets to 
pitch an idea to sell the crumpets, Warburtons came up with a winning campaign 
that showed of its brand personality and innovation.”

Boots – Discover More

Boots has proved a bit hit and miss at Christmas. It found itself the subject 
of an investigation by the ad regulator in 2012 for a scene in which a child 
pointed a hairdryer at a dog, but followed that up with two great campaigns 
featuring a boy leaving gifts for neighbours and a family waiting until mum got 
home from work at midnight to celebrate Christmas. Then just when they seemed 
to be on the right track, last year they came out with Discover More, which 
followed a firefly around a giant Boots factory.

“After two years of great campaigns I was eagerly waiting to see what Boots 
would do. What we got was a hugely disappointing campaign made even worse by a 
backing track sung by Jessie J.”

 M&S 2013 
M&S’s advertising always looks amazing and 2013 was no exception. Millions 
were spent creating an ad showcasing its best products across home, food and 
clothing. The problem is that the ad feels worlds away from the average M&S 
shopper and their experience of shopping in one of its stores.

“As with much of M&S’s marketing, this is style over substance. It’s a 
beautiful ad but its so far removed from the reality of M&S on the high street.”

Morrisons and Asda – 2012

 Asda advert 2015 
Retailers want to see people talking about their ads, but in 2012 Morrisons and
Asda hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons. 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHUFZSa7JNc> Both managed to produce ads that 
caused hundreds to complain to the ad regulator for using “stereotypical” 
depictions of women as being in charge of cooking on Christmas day and dads 
being little more than feckless idiots.

“The ire raised served as a reminder to all brands that there is no place for 
stereotypes and cliches in modern advertising.”
