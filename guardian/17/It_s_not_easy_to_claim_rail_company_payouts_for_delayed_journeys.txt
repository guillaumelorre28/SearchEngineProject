It is not surprising that only one in five rail passengers who are entitled to 
compensation for delayed services actually claim it (Passengers to get payouts 
for 15-minute rail delays

, 13 October). On a journey I made last year between Darlington and Inverness a 
delay of 10 minutes at the start became two hours by the time I reached my 
destination. Station staff were most helpful in issuing the appropriate form to 
make my claim for 100% compensation, which I later received in vouchers.

It was when I tried to use the vouchers that the obstacle course began. I was 
not permitted to use vouchers if I booked my next journey online – I had to do 
it by phone. On the phone I was given a reference number. Next, I had to write 
a letter giving details of my intended journey, the voucher numbers and the 
reference number. This had to be sent by post, allowing a minimum of 10 days 
for my tickets to be posted to me before my journey.

I went through this cumbersome and outdated process several times until I had 
used all my vouchers. How many people with busy lives would do so?
