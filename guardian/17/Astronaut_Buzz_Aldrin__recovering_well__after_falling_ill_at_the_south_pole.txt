On Thursday morning, tour guide company White Desert said Aldrin’s health had 
“deteriorated” and the 86-year-old had been flown out of the south pole to 
McMurdo Station, a US Antarctic research center on Ross Island offAntarctica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/antarctica>.

The company said in a news release 
<http://iaato.org/news-from-iaato?p_p_id=56_INSTANCE_GfSmZE4yK62p&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1>

As a precaution, following discussion between the White Desert doctor and the 
US Antarctic Program (USAP) doctor, Mr Aldrin, accompanied by a member of his 
team, was evacuated on the first available flight out of the South Pole to 
McMurdo with the USAP under the care of a USAP doctor. His condition was 
described as stable upon White Desert doctor’s hand-over to the USAP medial 
team.

The National Science Foundation said in a statement 
<https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=190518&org=NSF&from=news> that 
it provided a medical evacuation flight to Aldrin, described as an “ailing 
visitor”, after a medical request on Thursday, and were arranging the flight to 
New Zealand.

Three days ago, Aldrin tweeted photos 
<https://twitter.com/TheRealBuzz/status/803501192810823681> of himself in Cape 
Town, South Africa, about to board a plane to Antarctica.
