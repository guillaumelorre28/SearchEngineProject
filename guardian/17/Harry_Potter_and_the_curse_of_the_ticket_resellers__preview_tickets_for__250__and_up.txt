Harry Potter and the Cursed Child started its previews 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/08/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-previews-opening-plays-system-absurd>
 in London’s West End this week – and the two-part play is already sold out 
until 2017. For the producers, however, there is little defence against the 
dark arts of ticket reselling. At the time of writing, the cheapest ticket you 
can get to see the show next week on theresale site Viagogo 
<http://www.viagogo.co.uk/Theatre-Tickets/Theatre/Harry-Potter-and-the-Cursed-Child-Tickets>
 is £250: double the top box-office price of £125.

On Broadway, tickets for Hamilton, the hip-hop musical about the US founding 
father Alexander Hamilton, attract an even steeper mark-up. At each 
performance, at least $30,000 (£20,700) goes to resellers, according to 
Bloomberg, with some premium seats being sold for around $1,000 (£691), and 
cancellation lines starting days in advance.

Back in London, the only shows drawing prices close to Harry Potter are The 
Spoils, starring Jesse Eisenberg, and Nabucco at the Royal Opera House, with 
Placido Domingo. A recent government review said UK ticket sites need to do 
more to prevent reselling, suggesting buyers should be forced to show IDs, like 
at Glastonbury.
