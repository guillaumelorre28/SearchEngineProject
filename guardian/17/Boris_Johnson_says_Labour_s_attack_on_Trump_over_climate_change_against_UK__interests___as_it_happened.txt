Afternoon summary

 * The British government has been given a blunt warning to stay out of the 
EU’s post-Brexit business by a senior leader in the European parliament, who 
lambasted Boris Johnson for his “unbelievable arrogance” and insisted Britain 
would have “no say any more” in the long-term future of Europe. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/22/stay-out-of-eu-affairs-leading-mep-manfred-weber-tells-british-government>
 * Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has accused the UK government 
of sending out a “not welcome here” message to EU nationals. Speaking to 
investors at the annual Aberdeen Asset Management conference in London, she 
said: 
More than anything else, our long-term economic success will depend on 
nurturing the talent of those already in Scotland and of those who believe ours 
is the kind of welcoming country that allows ambition to flourish.

The position of the UK government and some others is very different. From the 
refusal to guarantee the status of fellow EU nationals living in Scotland and 
the UK, to the threat to draw up lists of foreign workers, the UK government 
seems intent on sending out a ‘not welcome here’ message.

I am determined that we send out a different message: one that says to all 
those living, working and studying in Scotland that they are most definitely 
welcome.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Gideon Rachman, the Financial Times’ foreign affairs columnist, thinks that 
appointing Nigel Farage as ambassador to the US might not be such a bad idea 
after all. Here’s an extract from his FT Instant Insight column (subscription). 
<https://www.ft.com/content/f5e33ab0-b0a2-11e6-a37c-f4a01f1b0fa1?tagToFollow=TnN0ZWluX1BOXzIwMDkwNjIzXzE2MTY=-UE4=>

What is the first job of a UK ambassador to Washington? It is to get close to 
the White House. Mr Farage would have an unprecedented closeness to the US 
president, the kind of access that other British ambassadors could only dream 
of. He campaigned alongside the president-elect and, after the election, had a 
personal meeting with Mr Trump — well before Theresa May (the British prime 
minister) was given a perfunctory 10 minutes on the phone ...

Ambassador Farage could also play an important role in securing one of 
Britain’s most important foreign-policy goals: a free-trade deal with the US. 
Unlike Mr Farage, I believe thatBritain’s decision to leave the EU 
<https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Brexit> is a disastrous mistake which will 
inflict long-term economic damage on Britain. But we are where we are. Given 
Britain has got itself into this absurd situation, we need to look for escape 
routes. Mr Farage is probably one of the few people with a chance of persuading 
the Trump administration to make a US-UK trade deal a top priority.

Some of the reasons for rejecting a Farage ambassadorship amount to little 
more than wounded pride. Yes, Mr Trump’s suggestion is a humiliating breach of 
protocol. But, frankly, it is just a foretaste of the indignities that Mr Trump 
is likely to inflict on Britain over the next four years. (Anyone looking 
forward to that state visit to London?)

Leading doctors have expressed concern over the impact Brexit could have on 
the NHS workforce, the Press Association reports.

If there is a dip in the number of European surgeons who work in the NHS there 
could be a “significant problem”,Ian Eardley, vice president of the Royal 
College of Surgeons said.

He told the House of Lords Committee on the Long-Term Sustainability of the 
NHS that recent years had seen an increase in the number of European surgeons 
who were coming to work in the NHS.

Around one in five surgeons in the NHS in England come from the EU, Mr Eardley 
said.

He said: “Forty percent of surgeons on specialist registers in this country 
trained overseas.

“Of these half trained in Europe and the other half trained outside Europe and 
what has happened in recent years is the number of people coming from outside 
Europe has been diminishing while the numbers coming from withinEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> has been increasing.

“So if that tap was to be turned off there could be potentially a significant 
problem certainly for surgery.”

Prof Jane Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians, told peers: “Up 
to 20% of our workforce is from theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

“We haven’t done the numbers yet because it is still up in the air, I think 
suffice to say, it is not good.”

On Monday the Department of Health’s most senior civil servant Chris Wormald 
told the public accounts committee that issues surrounding workforce from the 
EU was one of the main priorities for the Department’s team working on Brexit.

On the BBC’s Daily Politics Mike Penning, the armed forces minister, said that 
the government was now backing a private member’s bill that would making posing 
as a veteran and wearing medals that you have not earned a criminal offence. 
“The whole government is going to back this now on Friday,” Penning said. The 
bill has been tabled by the Conservative MPGareth Johnson who says “people who 
pretend they have won medals for courage, when that is not the case, should be 
punished accordingly.” 
<http://www.garethjohnsondartford.co.uk/stolen-valour-private-members-bill/>

But James Glancy, a former captain in the Royal Marines who received the 
Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for his service in Afghanistan, told the programme 
that the bill was unnecessary. He said:

I think it’s just going too far to suggest someone could go to prison … I 
think it’s very important to look at what’s going on with someone that is 
actually pretending that they served in the armed forces. There may well be a 
serious mental health problem and actually that person just has low 
self-esteem, they’re not a threat to the public, and they actually need 
professional help.

Lunchtime summary

 * Downing Street and the Foreign Office have slapped down a suggestion from 
the US president-elect, Donald Trump, that Nigel Farage would be a good 
ambassador to Washington, as MPs said the Ukip leader’s inflammatory views made 
him a poor candidate for a diplomatic post. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/22/nigel-farage-will-not-be-ambassador-to-us-say-no10-and-foreign-office-donald-trump>
 * The Electoral Commission has begun an investigation into whether Ukip broke 
election funding laws by apparently using money from a European parliament 
group to fund Nigel Farage’s failed attempt to win a Westminster seat, and in 
the Brexit referendum. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/22/electoral-commission-investigates-ukip-over-impermissible-donations>
 * Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has criticised Labour for attacking 
Donald Trump’s stance on climate change. During Foreign Office questions in the 
Commons he also claimed that Britain hoped to “shape and influence” the actions 
of the Trump administration. (See12.02pm

.) 
 * Manfred Weber, a German MEP and chair of the centre-right European People’s 
party in the European parliament, has said he thinks the UK wants to stay in 
the single market. Speaking after a meeting with David Davis, the Brexit 
secretary, in the European parliament, Weber said: 
What we really expect are clear proposals. Today, in my talk with David Davis, 
unfortunately I have not heard anything new, I have not heard much as to how 
the British government wants to tackle Brexit and what Brexit really means. I 
have not received any new information, quite the opposite is true.

Today I have been told that the British government, as far as the economy is 
concerned, it wants to stay in the single market - but the British government 
would also like to continue and have very close co-operation in legal issues.

Later Downing Street said that the government’s position had not changed and 
that it wanted “a trading relationship that allows UK companies to trade both 
with and within the single market and lets European businesses do the same.”

 * Weber has also criticised Boris Johnson for promoting the idea of Turkey 
joining the EU while he spread alarm about it during the EU referendum campaign.
Referring to Johnson, Weber said: 
[Johnson] himself did, in the Brexit campaign, leaflets where he showed 
Turkey, Syria and Iraq as possible members of the European Union, making people 
afraid of possible EU migration waves. He used it himself and then a few weeks 
afterwards he is travelling to Erdogan and he is offering support for becoming 
a member of theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> - it is 
unbelievable, it is a provocation and it is arrogant what we hear from him. I 
cannot respect this any more, what he is doing in this regard.

 * Britain’s factories are poised to raise both output and prices over the 
coming months as they continue to adjust to the impact of the EU referendum in 
June. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/22/manufacturers-strong-order-books-prices-forced-up-cbi>
AsLarry Elliott reports, the latest snapshot of the economy from the 
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/cbi>showed that order books for UK 
manufacturers are strong and production is expected to rise at its fastest pace 
in almost two years over the next three months.But the employers’ organisation 
warned that the fall in the value of the pound since theBrexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> vote was pushing up the 
cost of the raw materials and components used by industry and factory gate 
prices were going up at their fastest rate since early 2014. 
 * Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, has told the Commons 
public administration and constitutional affairs committee that the civil 
service will have to expand if it wants to be able to cope with both Brexit and 
its normal government duties. He said: 
There is a genuine issue about capacity to manage both the demands of Brexit, 
which is huge, complex and with big stakes, and at the same time taking forward 
a set of other policy initiatives that government wants to take up. I think 
it’s not possible to do that at a point where the civil service is at its 
lowest number since the Second World War and continuing to fall.

The government ought to do some form of independent or semi-independent 
assessment of its preparedness for this huge task it’s got ahead of it on 
Brexit.

 * Thomas Mair, who is accused of murdering the Labour MP Jo Cox, has opted 
not to give evidence in his defence at the Old Bailey. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/22/jo-cox-trial-thomas-mair-opts-not-to-give-evidence-in-his-defence>
 AsMatthew Taylor reports, the jury was told that Mair had declined to appear 
as a witness in the trial. Simon Russell Flint QC said the defence would offer 
no other evidence. 
 * Michael O’Leary, the Ryanair boss, has claimed ministers “haven’t a clue” 
over Brexit. Speaking at the annual conference of the Airport Operators 
Association O’Leary, who campaigned for remain, said: 
Frankly there’s very little evidence apart from some mildly lunatic optimism 
over here that it will be all right on the night. It’s like Dad’s Army going 
off to war here. It’ll be all right Sergeant [sic] Jones. You’ll just keep 
plodding along.

These guys have no idea where they’re going for the next two years and the 
problem is that in the absence of any discussions with the Europeans on Brexit 
they’re all talking to themselves. They stand up in the Houses of Parliament 
[and say] ‘We’re going to do a good deal for Britain’. Any idea what a good 
deal looks like? No, they haven’t a clue.

The UK is going to walk itself off a cliff unless somebody in the Tory Party 
comes up with a bright idea.

 * The government has published plans for a major overhaul of aid spending 
that would allow billions of pounds of development funding to be channelled 
into the government’s controversial private equity arm, the Financial Times 
(subscription) reports.

Here is my colleague Patrick Wintour’s take on Donald Trump’s suggestion that 
Nigel Farage <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> should be 
appointed UK ambassador to the US.

Trump's tweet queries how special our relationship should be
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/trumps-tweet-queries-how-special-our-relationship-should-be>
And here is how it starts.

Donald Trump’s interest in other world leaders has sometimes seemed closely 
related to whether or not his family has a golf course or luxury hotel under 
construction in their territory. The conversations reportedly turn as much to 
completing a planning permission as a peace process.

So it will have been with alarm that Downing Street woke up this morning to 
find Donald Trump has been involved in some more Twitter diplomacy – advising 
thatNigel Farage <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage>, the 
interim Ukip leader, would make a great UK ambassador to Washington.

Apart from underlining how social media has become integral to modern 
politics, the tweet reveals how strong and deep Trump’s connections are with 
the Farage Ukip team, how little he possibly cares – or possibly knows – about 
diplomatic protocol, and how much his ego precedes all else.

Johnson says UK hopes to 'shape and influence' actions of Trump administration

And here is the quote from Boris Johnson where he said the British government 
hoped to “shape and influence” the actions of the Trump administration. He was 
responding to the SNP MP Gavin Newlands. (See11.39am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/22/no-10-rejects-trumps-call-for-farage-to-beuk-ambassador-to-the-us-politics-live?page=with:block-58342d5be4b0e0ad2d75be4b#block-58342d5be4b0e0ad2d75be4b>
 Johnson said:

I do think it is very important that on all sides of this House we should be 
as positive as we possibly can be about working with the incoming US 
administration. It is of massive importance to our country and indeed to the 
world. And I suggest to the honourable member that he should judge that new 
administration by their actions in office which, of course, we hope to shape 
and influence.

Johnson says UK will try to change Trump's stance on climate change

And here is the Boris Johnson quote where he said the UK would urge Donald 
Trump to accept the reality of climate change. He was responding to Labour’s 
Emily Thornberry (see 11.49am)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/22/no-10-rejects-trumps-call-for-farage-to-beuk-ambassador-to-the-us-politics-live?page=with:block-5834300ee4b0da4920d6b0fc#block-5834300ee4b0da4920d6b0fc>
and he said:


I think it is vital that we are as positive as we can possibly be about the 
new administration-elect. And, as I have said before, I believe the UK-US 
relationship is of vital importance. I think that president-elect Trump is a 
deal maker. And when it comes to climate change, this is something that the UK 
has led on globally, we have had outstanding success and, yes - I’m very open 
with the House - it is a message that we are taking to the administration, we 
believe it to be important, we believe it be in the interests of the United 
States and of the world.

Johnson accuses Labour of damaging the national interest by attacking Trump 
over climate change

Here is the quote where Boris Johnson said Labour’s attacks on Trump were 
against the national interest.

Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said that Donald Trump’s 
election was a “hugely dangerous development for the future of our planet” 
because he thought climate change was a hoax. She asked if Theresa May would 
have “have the moral backbone to tell [Trump] he is wrong on climate change” 
when she visited him in Washington. And Thornberry said that, if Trump refuses 
to change his stance on climate change, May should condemn him.

Johnson replied:

I really must say to the right honourable lady that I believe she is being 
premature in her hostile judgments of the administration-elect. And any such 
premature verdict, I believe, could be damaging to the interests of this 
country. It is important for us in this country to use our influence, which is 
very considerable, to help the United States to see its responsibilities, as 
I’m sure they will.

Labour’s Emma Reynolds asks Johnson to confirm that the government is 
considering a transitional deal on Brexit.

Johnson says the government will get the best possible deal for the UK. It 
will be “win/win” for the UK and the EU, he says.

Johnson says Labour attacks on Trump are against the national interest

Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says we meet on the 53rd 
anniversary of John F Kennedy’s death. Johnson says Trump is a “liberal guy” 
and that we have every reason to be positive about him. Why should be be 
positive about his views on climate change?

Johnson says it is vital we are as positive as we can be about Trump.

He says Trump is a deal maker. And, when it comes to climate change, this is 
something the UK has led on. The UK will be taking this message to the Trump 
administration, he says.

 * Johnson says UK will urge Trump to accept the reality of climate change. 
Thornberry says Trump thinks climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. 
Will Theresa May tell Trump he is wrong. And will she condemn Trump if he 
scraps the Paris climate change treaty.

Johnson says Thornberry is being “premature”. And he says criticising Trump 
like this is against the national interest.

 * The British government has been given a blunt warning to stay out of the 
EU’s post-Brexit business by a senior leader in the European parliament, who 
lambasted Boris Johnson for his “unbelievable arrogance” and insisted Britain 
would have “no say any more” in the long-term future of Europe. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/22/stay-out-of-eu-affairs-leading-mep-manfred-weber-tells-british-government>
 * Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has accused the UK government 
of sending out a “not welcome here” message to EU nationals. Speaking to 
investors at the annual Aberdeen Asset Management conference in London, she 
said: 
More than anything else, our long-term economic success will depend on 
nurturing the talent of those already in Scotland and of those who believe ours 
is the kind of welcoming country that allows ambition to flourish.

The position of the UK government and some others is very different. From the 
refusal to guarantee the status of fellow EU nationals living in Scotland and 
the UK, to the threat to draw up lists of foreign workers, the UK government 
seems intent on sending out a ‘not welcome here’ message.

I am determined that we send out a different message: one that says to all 
those living, working and studying in Scotland that they are most definitely 
welcome.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
My colleague Patrick Wintour, the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, seems to agree 
with Sir Christopher Meyer.
Patrick Wintour (@patrickwintour) 
Sir Kim Darroch UK's man in US today briefed UK National Security Council on 
the implications of Trump's election. Imagine Farage doing so.
 <https://twitter.com/patrickwintour/status/801092052880658434> November 22, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/patrickwintour/status/801092052880658434>  
But Sir Christopher Meyer, who himself served as Britain’s ambassador in 
Washington, has told the Independentthat that giving the job to Nigel Farage 
would be “barking mad”. 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-donald-trump-ambassador-to-the-us-would-be-barking-mad-says-sir-chistopher-meyer-a7432126.html>
 
Gideon Rachman, the Financial Times’ foreign affairs columnist, thinks that 
appointing Nigel Farage as ambassador to the US might not be such a bad idea 
after all. Here’s an extract from his FT Instant Insight column (subscription). 
<https://www.ft.com/content/f5e33ab0-b0a2-11e6-a37c-f4a01f1b0fa1?tagToFollow=TnN0ZWluX1BOXzIwMDkwNjIzXzE2MTY=-UE4=>

What is the first job of a UK ambassador to Washington? It is to get close to 
the White House. Mr Farage would have an unprecedented closeness to the US 
president, the kind of access that other British ambassadors could only dream 
of. He campaigned alongside the president-elect and, after the election, had a 
personal meeting with Mr Trump — well before Theresa May (the British prime 
minister) was given a perfunctory 10 minutes on the phone ...

Ambassador Farage could also play an important role in securing one of 
Britain’s most important foreign-policy goals: a free-trade deal with the US. 
Unlike Mr Farage, I believe thatBritain’s decision to leave the EU 
<https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Brexit> is a disastrous mistake which will 
inflict long-term economic damage on Britain. But we are where we are. Given 
Britain has got itself into this absurd situation, we need to look for escape 
routes. Mr Farage is probably one of the few people with a chance of persuading 
the Trump administration to make a US-UK trade deal a top priority.

Some of the reasons for rejecting a Farage ambassadorship amount to little 
more than wounded pride. Yes, Mr Trump’s suggestion is a humiliating breach of 
protocol. But, frankly, it is just a foretaste of the indignities that Mr Trump 
is likely to inflict on Britain over the next four years. (Anyone looking 
forward to that state visit to London?)

Leading doctors have expressed concern over the impact Brexit could have on 
the NHS workforce, the Press Association reports.

If there is a dip in the number of European surgeons who work in the NHS there 
could be a “significant problem”,Ian Eardley, vice president of the Royal 
College of Surgeons said.

He told the House of Lords Committee on the Long-Term Sustainability of the 
NHS that recent years had seen an increase in the number of European surgeons 
who were coming to work in the NHS.

Around one in five surgeons in the NHS in England come from the EU, Mr Eardley 
said.

He said: “Forty percent of surgeons on specialist registers in this country 
trained overseas.

“Of these half trained in Europe and the other half trained outside Europe and 
what has happened in recent years is the number of people coming from outside 
Europe has been diminishing while the numbers coming from withinEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> has been increasing.

“So if that tap was to be turned off there could be potentially a significant 
problem certainly for surgery.”

Prof Jane Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians, told peers: “Up 
to 20% of our workforce is from theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

“We haven’t done the numbers yet because it is still up in the air, I think 
suffice to say, it is not good.”

On Monday the Department of Health’s most senior civil servant Chris Wormald 
told the public accounts committee that issues surrounding workforce from the 
EU was one of the main priorities for the Department’s team working on Brexit.
 
On the BBC’s Daily Politics Mike Penning, the armed forces minister, said that 
the government was now backing a private member’s bill that would making posing 
as a veteran and wearing medals that you have not earned a criminal offence. 
“The whole government is going to back this now on Friday,” Penning said. The 
bill has been tabled by the Conservative MPGareth Johnson who says “people who 
pretend they have won medals for courage, when that is not the case, should be 
punished accordingly.”

But James Glancy, a former captain in the Royal Marines who received the 
Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for his service in Afghanistan, told the programme 
that the bill was unnecessary. He said:

I think it’s just going too far to suggest someone could go to prison … I 
think it’s very important to look at what’s going on with someone that is 
actually pretending that they served in the armed forces. There may well be a 
serious mental health problem and actually that person just has low 
self-esteem, they’re not a threat to the public, and they actually need 
professional help.
 
 * Downing Street and the Foreign Office have slapped down a suggestion from 
the US president-elect, Donald Trump, that Nigel Farage would be a good 
ambassador to Washington, as MPs said the Ukip leader’s inflammatory views made 
him a poor candidate for a diplomatic post. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/22/nigel-farage-will-not-be-ambassador-to-us-say-no10-and-foreign-office-donald-trump>
 * The Electoral Commission has begun an investigation into whether Ukip broke 
election funding laws by apparently using money from a European parliament 
group to fund Nigel Farage’s failed attempt to win a Westminster seat, and in 
the Brexit referendum.

 * Manfred Weber, a German MEP and chair of the centre-right European People’s 
party in the European parliament, has said he thinks the UK wants to stay in 
the single market. Speaking after a meeting with David Davis, the Brexit 
secretary, in the European parliament, Weber said: 
What we really expect are clear proposals. Today, in my talk with David Davis, 
unfortunately I have not heard anything new, I have not heard much as to how 
the British government wants to tackle Brexit and what Brexit really means. I 
have not received any new information, quite the opposite is true.

Today I have been told that the British government, as far as the economy is 
concerned, it wants to stay in the single market - but the British government 
would also like to continue and have very close co-operation in legal issues.

Later Downing Street said that the government’s position had not changed and 
that it wanted “a trading relationship that allows UK companies to trade both 
with and within the single market and lets European businesses do the same.”

 * Weber has also criticised Boris Johnson for promoting the idea of Turkey 
joining the EU while he spread alarm about it during the EU referendum campaign.
Referring to Johnson, Weber said: 
[Johnson] himself did, in the Brexit campaign, leaflets where he showed 
Turkey, Syria and Iraq as possible members of the European Union, making people 
afraid of possible EU migration waves. He used it himself and then a few weeks 
afterwards he is travelling to Erdogan and he is offering support for becoming 
a member of theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> - it is 
unbelievable, it is a provocation and it is arrogant what we hear from him. I 
cannot respect this any more, what he is doing in this regard.

 * Britain’s factories are poised to raise both output and prices over the 
coming months as they continue to adjust to the impact of the EU referendum in 
June. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/22/manufacturers-strong-order-books-prices-forced-up-cbi>
AsLarry Elliott reports, the latest snapshot of the economy from the 
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/cbi>showed that order books for UK 
manufacturers are strong and production is expected to rise at its fastest pace 
in almost two years over the next three months.But the employers’ organisation 
warned that the fall in the value of the pound since theBrexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> vote was pushing up the 
cost of the raw materials and components used by industry and factory gate 
prices were going up at their fastest rate since early 2014. 
 * Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, has told the Commons 
public administration and constitutional affairs committee that the civil 
service will have to expand if it wants to be able to cope with both Brexit and 
its normal government duties. He said: 
There is a genuine issue about capacity to manage both the demands of Brexit, 
which is huge, complex and with big stakes, and at the same time taking forward 
a set of other policy initiatives that government wants to take up. I think 
it’s not possible to do that at a point where the civil service is at its 
lowest number since the Second World War and continuing to fall.

The government ought to do some form of independent or semi-independent 
assessment of its preparedness for this huge task it’s got ahead of it on 
Brexit.

 * Thomas Mair, who is accused of murdering the Labour MP Jo Cox, has opted 
not to give evidence in his defence at the Old Bailey. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/22/jo-cox-trial-thomas-mair-opts-not-to-give-evidence-in-his-defence>
 AsMatthew Taylor reports, the jury was told that Mair had declined to appear 
as a witness in the trial. Simon Russell Flint QC said the defence would offer 
no other evidence. 
 * Michael O’Leary, the Ryanair boss, has claimed ministers “haven’t a clue” 
over Brexit. Speaking at the annual conference of the Airport Operators 
Association O’Leary, who campaigned for remain, said: 
Frankly there’s very little evidence apart from some mildly lunatic optimism 
over here that it will be all right on the night. It’s like Dad’s Army going 
off to war here. It’ll be all right Sergeant [sic] Jones. You’ll just keep 
plodding along.

These guys have no idea where they’re going for the next two years and the 
problem is that in the absence of any discussions with the Europeans on Brexit 
they’re all talking to themselves. They stand up in the Houses of Parliament 
[and say] ‘We’re going to do a good deal for Britain’. Any idea what a good 
deal looks like? No, they haven’t a clue.

The UK is going to walk itself off a cliff unless somebody in the Tory Party 
comes up with a bright idea.

 * The government has published plans for a major overhaul of aid spending 
that would allow billions of pounds of development funding to be channelled 
into the government’s controversial private equity arm, the Financial Times 
(subscription) reports.

Here is my colleague Patrick Wintour’s take on Donald Trump’s suggestion that 
Nigel Farage <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> should be 
appointed UK ambassador to the US.

Trump's tweet queries how special our relationship should be
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/trumps-tweet-queries-how-special-our-relationship-should-be>
And here is how it starts.

Donald Trump’s interest in other world leaders has sometimes seemed closely 
related to whether or not his family has a golf course or luxury hotel under 
construction in their territory. The conversations reportedly turn as much to 
completing a planning permission as a peace process.

So it will have been with alarm that Downing Street woke up this morning to 
find Donald Trump has been involved in some more Twitter diplomacy – advising 
thatNigel Farage <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage>, the 
interim Ukip leader, would make a great UK ambassador to Washington.

Apart from underlining how social media has become integral to modern 
politics, the tweet reveals how strong and deep Trump’s connections are with 
the Farage Ukip team, how little he possibly cares – or possibly knows – about 
diplomatic protocol, and how much his ego precedes all else.
 
Here is Boris Johnson in the Commons saying there is no vacancy for ambassador 
to the US.

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/22/boris-johnson-donald-trump-nigel-farage-ambassador-video> 
Johnson says that although the UK is leaving the EU, it is not leaving Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. He says he wants UK to carry 
on hosting the 2023 European capital of culture. And he wants the UK to carry 
on participating in events like this after it leaves.
 
Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> is now taking topic 
questions in the Commons. These are questions that have not been tabled in 
advance, and so any subject can come up.
 
Here is the SNP MP Mhairi Black on Boris Johnson’s comments on Donald Trump

And here is the quote from Boris Johnson where he said the British government 
hoped to “shape and influence” the actions of the Trump administration. He was 
responding to the SNP MP Gavin Newlands. (See11.39am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/22/no-10-rejects-trumps-call-for-farage-to-beuk-ambassador-to-the-us-politics-live?page=with:block-58342d5be4b0e0ad2d75be4b#block-58342d5be4b0e0ad2d75be4b>
 Johnson said:

I do think it is very important that on all sides of this House we should be 
as positive as we possibly can be about working with the incoming US 
administration. It is of massive importance to our country and indeed to the 
world. And I suggest to the honourable member that he should judge that new 
administration by their actions in office which, of course, we hope to shape 
and influence.
 
And here is the Boris Johnson quote where he said the UK would urge Donald 
Trump to accept the reality of climate change. He was responding to Labour’s 
Emily Thornberry (see 11.49am)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/22/no-10-rejects-trumps-call-for-farage-to-beuk-ambassador-to-the-us-politics-live?page=with:block-5834300ee4b0da4920d6b0fc#block-5834300ee4b0da4920d6b0fc>
and he said:


I think it is vital that we are as positive as we can possibly be about the 
new administration-elect. And, as I have said before, I believe the UK-US 
relationship is of vital importance. I think that president-elect Trump is a 
deal maker. And when it comes to climate change, this is something that the UK 
has led on globally, we have had outstanding success and, yes - I’m very open 
with the House - it is a message that we are taking to the administration, we 
believe it to be important, we believe it be in the interests of the United 
States and of the world.
 
Here is the quote where Boris Johnson said Labour’s attacks on Trump were 
against the national interest.

Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said that Donald Trump’s 
election was a “hugely dangerous development for the future of our planet” 
because he thought climate change was a hoax. She asked if Theresa May would 
have “have the moral backbone to tell [Trump] he is wrong on climate change” 
when she visited him in Washington. And Thornberry said that, if Trump refuses 
to change his stance on climate change, May should condemn him.

Johnson replied:

I really must say to the right honourable lady that I believe she is being 
premature in her hostile judgments of the administration-elect. And any such 
premature verdict, I believe, could be damaging to the interests of this 
country. It is important for us in this country to use our influence, which is 
very considerable, to help the United States to see its responsibilities, as 
I’m sure they will.
Boris Johnson: Labour’s climate attack on Trump could damage national interest 
– video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/22/boris-johnson-labours-climate-attack-on-trump-could-damage-national-interest-video> 
Labour’s Emma Reynolds asks Johnson to confirm that the government is 
considering a transitional deal on Brexit.

Johnson says the government will get the best possible deal for the UK. It 
will be “win/win” for the UK and the EU, he says.
 
Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says we meet on the 53rd 
anniversary of John F Kennedy’s death. Johnson says Trump is a “liberal guy” 
and that we have every reason to be positive about him. Why should be be 
positive about his views on climate change?

Johnson says it is vital we are as positive as we can be about Trump.

He says Trump is a deal maker. And, when it comes to climate change, this is 
something the UK has led on. The UK will be taking this message to the Trump 
administration, he says.

 * Johnson says UK will urge Trump to accept the reality of climate change. 
Thornberry says Trump thinks climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. 
Will Theresa May tell Trump he is wrong. And will she condemn Trump if he 
scraps the Paris climate change treaty.

Johnson says Thornberry is being “premature”. And he says criticising Trump 
like this is against the national interest.

 * Johnson says Labour attacks on Trump are against the national interest.
