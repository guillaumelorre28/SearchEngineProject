The vote in the Greek parliament saw some unlikely allies back the 
government’s Christmas bonus to pensioners, with the final figure in favour

European markets move higher

With the Federal Reserve <https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve>
 raising interest rates for the first time in a year and talking of three more 
increases to come next year, the dollar has strengthened and helped push 
banking shares higher, supporting European markets in general. Simon Gergel, 
chief investment officer of UK equities at Allianz told Reuters:

Rising interest rates are generally quite good for banks, depending on their 
specific situation, but in general they are sitting on large deposit bases and 
they can make a bigger spread as interest rates go up.

The market gains came despite a fall in commodity stocks after the greenback 
moved higher. The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 49.82 points or 0.72% higher at 6999.01, tantalising 
close to the 7000 level 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 1.08% to 11,366.40 
 * France’s Cac closed up 1.05% at 4819.23 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB jumped 2.09% to 18,994.79 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.33% at 9340.8 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.88% to 613.76

In Athens the vote on the controversial legislation has just begun as 
thousands of pensioners take to the streets in Athens.


With the support of three political parties and the ruling two-party coalition 
the ballot is easily expected to secure sought support to be passed into law. 
That means pensioners will receive a 13th payment before Christmas. Helena 
Smith reports:

Pensioners, representing organizations across the country, have gathered en 
masse in central Athens, in a protest rally now headed towards the prime 
minister’s office. The demonstration could not be better timed, coinciding with 
the vote and the spotlight the Greek PM, Alexis Tsipras, has inadvertently 
placed on pensioners with the announcement of his surprise pre-Christmas bonus. 
Holding banners decrying the loss of benefits many have suffered since the 
crisis began, they demanded that the cuts be reinstated. “We can’t forget what 
we gave to the social security system, we are not going to give up what is 
rightly ours, we are not going to sell our dignity,” the organisations said in 
a statement.

Pensioners, some living on as little as €300 a month, are among those who have 
been hardest hit by the harsh fiscal policies debt-stricken Greece has been 
forced to apply in return for international rescue funds. While Tsipras’ 
unexpected gift has been welcomed most do not feel it goes far enough. “They 
have to give us back our full pensions, which represent all the years that we 
worked, all the contributions that we made, not make a mockery of us with 
crumbs and bonuses,” said Dimos Koubouris, who heads the federation of 
pensioners.

The Greek parliament is due to start voting shortly on the government’s plan 
to pay one-off Christmas bonuses to pensioners, the move which annoyed the 
country’s creditors so much they put debt relief on hold.

As markets move higher, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

Despite a woeful performance from the mining sector and falling oil prices, 
the FTSE 100 is ending the day firmly in positive territory. Clearly the number 
of stocks expected to benefit from rising US rates outpaces those who will 
suffer from lower commodity prices. Investors are spending their first 24 hours 
in a new world, one dominated by rising US interest rates plus an impending 
fiscal stimulus that is meant to rescue the US from economic malaise.

With the euro in full flight it is not surprising to see eurozone markets 
racing, and this is probably something we should get used to for the year 
ahead. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100’s performance will depend on whether the rising 
dollar does too much to torpedo the commodity rally, or whether higher rates 
will lift bank stocks sufficiently in the year ahead to offset this. 15 
December 2016 may well prove to be a microcosm of what 2017 has to offer.

Positive US figures

Earlier there were some new US economic figures, all fairly positive in the 
wake of the Fed’s interest rate rise and plans for another three increases next 
year.

The consumer price index rose 0.2%, in line with expectations, while the New 
York Federal Reserve’s Empire manufacturing index came in at 9 in December, 
well above the consensus of 4 and the November figure of 1.5.

Jobless claims fell for the second week in a row, down 4,000 to a seasonally 
adjusted 254,000. This is the 93rd straight week that claims have been below 
300,000, which is a level associated with a healthy jobs market.

Meanwhile the US current account deficit fell from $118.3bn in the second 
quarter to $113bn in the latest three months. A jump in soybean shipments 
boosted exports, according to the commerce department.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up around 120 points 
or 0.6%.

Tsakalotos has defended Athens’ plans to pay out one-off benefits for 
low-income pensioners ahead of Christmas. A day after eurozone lenders put 
short-term debt relief for Greece on hold in response, he told Reuters in 
Berlin:

I don’t think this is a big issue. We have bigger fish to fry.

Tsakalotos also argued that Europe needed to show it could solve its own 
problems in order to restore confidence among working-class people after 
populist gains in a series of European elections, the Brexit vote and the 
Italian referendum.

His comments came as French President François Hollande jumped to Greece’s 
defence of Greece after European creditors pulled a recently announced debt 
relief package for the country.

Hollande said ahead of today’s summit of EU leaders that 

it is out of the question to ask for further additional efforts from Greece or 
prevent them from taking a number of sovereign measures that respect the 
commitments” that Greece previously took.

Just days after a eurozone agreement to approve some debt relief, Greek prime 
minister Alexis Tsipras surprised eurozone creditors by announcing a Christmas 
bonus for some 1.6 million low-income pensioners and committing to restore a 
lower sales tax rate for Aegean Sea islanders.


Tsipras said at the summit there’s room for “a breakthrough, without 
blackmail.”

Greek parliament approves pension deal
Nick Barnets (@NickBarnets) 
#Greece <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash>'s parliament approves 
#Tsipras <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tsipras?src=hash>' controversial 
pensioners bonus w/ 195 out of 300 votes.

With the Federal Reserve <https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve>
 raising interest rates for the first time in a year and talking of three more 
increases to come next year, the dollar has strengthened and helped push 
banking shares higher, supporting European markets in general. Simon Gergel, 
chief investment officer of UK equities at Allianz told Reuters:

Rising interest rates are generally quite good for banks, depending on their 
specific situation, but in general they are sitting on large deposit bases and 
they can make a bigger spread as interest rates go up.

The market gains came despite a fall in commodity stocks after the greenback 
moved higher. The final scores in Europe showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 49.82 points or 0.72% higher at 6999.01, tantalising 
close to the 7000 level 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 1.08% to 11,366.40 
 * France’s Cac closed up 1.05% at 4819.23 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB jumped 2.09% to 18,994.79 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.33% at 9340.8 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.88% to 613.76 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 
 
In Athens the vote on the controversial legislation has just begun as 
thousands of pensioners take to the streets in Athens.


With the support of three political parties and the ruling two-party coalition 
the ballot is easily expected to secure sought support to be passed into law. 
That means pensioners will receive a 13th payment before Christmas. Helena 
Smith reports:

Pensioners, representing organizations across the country, have gathered en 
masse in central Athens, in a protest rally now headed towards the prime 
minister’s office. The demonstration could not be better timed, coinciding with 
the vote and the spotlight the Greek PM, Alexis Tsipras, has inadvertently 
placed on pensioners with the announcement of his surprise pre-Christmas bonus. 
Holding banners decrying the loss of benefits many have suffered since the 
crisis began, they demanded that the cuts be reinstated. “We can’t forget what 
we gave to the social security system, we are not going to give up what is 
rightly ours, we are not going to sell our dignity,” the organisations said in 
a statement.

Pensioners, some living on as little as €300 a month, are among those who have 
been hardest hit by the harsh fiscal policies debt-stricken Greece has been 
forced to apply in return for international rescue funds. While Tsipras’ 
unexpected gift has been welcomed most do not feel it goes far enough. “They 
have to give us back our full pensions, which represent all the years that we 
worked, all the contributions that we made, not make a mockery of us with 
crumbs and bonuses,” said Dimos Koubouris, who heads the federation of 
pensioners.
 
The Greek parliament is due to start voting shortly on the government’s plan 
to pay one-off Christmas bonuses to pensioners, the move which annoyed the 
country’s creditors so much they put debt relief on hold.

As markets move higher, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

Despite a woeful performance from the mining sector and falling oil prices, 
the FTSE 100 is ending the day firmly in positive territory. Clearly the number 
of stocks expected to benefit from rising US rates outpaces those who will 
suffer from lower commodity prices. Investors are spending their first 24 hours 
in a new world, one dominated by rising US interest rates plus an impending 
fiscal stimulus that is meant to rescue the US from economic malaise.

With the euro in full flight it is not surprising to see eurozone markets 
racing, and this is probably something we should get used to for the year 
ahead. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100’s performance will depend on whether the rising 
dollar does too much to torpedo the commodity rally, or whether higher rates 
will lift bank stocks sufficiently in the year ahead to offset this. 15 
December 2016 may well prove to be a microcosm of what 2017 has to offer.
 
Back with the US and the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to climb 
following the Fed rate decision.

It is now up around 154 points at 19,946 and heading towards 20,000.

The FTSE 100 has regained the 7000 level for the first time since the end of 
October.

Bank shares are among the leading risers after the US rate hike from the 
Federal Reserve <https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve>, and 
hopes that Italian banks will be recapitalised.
 
Earlier there were some new US economic figures, all fairly positive in the 
wake of the Fed’s interest rate rise and plans for another three increases next 
year.

The consumer price index rose 0.2%, in line with expectations, while the New 
York Federal Reserve’s Empire manufacturing index came in at 9 in December, 
well above the consensus of 4 and the November figure of 1.5.

Jobless claims fell for the second week in a row, down 4,000 to a seasonally 
adjusted 254,000. This is the 93rd straight week that claims have been below 
300,000, which is a level associated with a healthy jobs market.

Meanwhile the US current account deficit fell from $118.3bn in the second 
quarter to $113bn in the latest three months. A jump in soybean shipments 
boosted exports, according to the commerce department.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up around 120 points 
or 0.6%.
 
Tsakalotos has defended Athens’ plans to pay out one-off benefits for 
low-income pensioners ahead of Christmas. A day after eurozone lenders put 
short-term debt relief for Greece on hold in response, he told Reuters in 
Berlin:

I don’t think this is a big issue. We have bigger fish to fry.

Tsakalotos also argued that Europe needed to show it could solve its own 
problems in order to restore confidence among working-class people after 
populist gains in a series of European elections, the Brexit vote and the 
Italian referendum.
