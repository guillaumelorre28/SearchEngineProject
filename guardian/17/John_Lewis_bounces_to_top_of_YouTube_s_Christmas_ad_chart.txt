its founder, featuring Domhnall Gleeson, Sienna Miller and Dominic West, has 
racked up almost 13.8m views despite not airing on TV.

David Black, the managing director of branding at the UK arm of YouTube’s 
parent, Google, said that it has seen a 40% increase in searches for Christmas 
ads this year compared with 2015. “They start searching before the ads are even 
launched on TV,” he said. “More brands than ever are makingChristmas ads 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/christmas-ads> that users love.”

YouTube uses an algorithm to determine the most popular Christmas ads, which 
takes into account factors including how much of the video people watched, 
which is why Sainsbury’s ranks higher thanBurberry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/burberrygroup> despite having slightly 
fewer views.


The top five is rounded out by German supermarket Edeka, which has been 
accused of containing neo-Nazi symbolism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/24/german-supermarket-edeka-denies-neo-nazi-symbolism-tv-ad>
, and a Brazilian Coca-Cola ad.


“It’s great to see UK brands leading the way with Christmas ads,” said Black. 

Last year, Sainsbury’s Mog cat ad pipped John Lewis’s Man on the Moon ad in 
the same contest.

In 2014, John Lewis’s Monty the penguin ad beat Sainsbury’s
