See you next week

Thanks for getting involved today in a broad discussion involving Donald 
Trump, Brexit and a northern “brain drain” in the UK. We’ll be back next week 
with another opportunity to discuss the week’s news and features with our 
journalists below the line, but in the meantime you can get in touch with any 
feedback. Email sarah.marsh@theguardian.com or matthew.holmes@theguardian.com 
with suggestions, or continue the conversation below, where we’ll also be 
checking in. Have a great weekend.


Lastly from us today, we’ll leave you with this: random hugs all round!

If you ever feel like you're have the joy of being alive suffocated out of you 
by nihilistic journalism and opinion pieces, one thing that's worth hanging on 
to: I've met a lot of middle class liberal Guardian reading types recently, 
they're alright if you know how to take them, can be a bit weird and intense 
about some things, but they are not that much different from everyone else. My 
advice , if you're coming home from work and you spot a MCLG-type, give them a 
random hug. It doesn't matter how sweaty or work-dirty you are, just do it!

Thanks Norman.

Conversation of the week: should the government define 'unconventional' sex?

Guardian readers

Each week we ask our team of moderators to highlight a conversation they 
enjoyed reading or felt was particularly constructive or interesting.

First today was the discussion below a news article after it was announced 
that the UK was to censor online videos of “non-conventional” sex acts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/23/censor-non-conventional-sex-acts-online-internet-pornography>
. Many readers disagreed with the plan.

‘No place in a free and open society’

This sort of censorship has no place in a free and open society.

Adults should be free to consume whatever material they want, regardless of 
how distasteful others may find it, provided all subjects involved are 
performing with consent.

End of story.

‘Stunningly, hilariously naive’

The only thing more astonishing than the fact this ban is happening at all, is 
the fact it appears the people enforcing it think it'll be possible to enforce.

Stunningly, hilariously naive.

‘Who was even pushing for this to happen?’

Right so it's now illegal to show female ejaculation which in itself is not 
only legal but perfectly natural. But films can still show terrorism, violence, 
drug use and murder.

Or how about sports like UFC, it's not really conventional to beat someone 
until they pass out.

It's completely illogical, and furthermore who was even pushing for this to 
happen ?

“Government should not be regulating what is moral ... just what is consenting’

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/88107958> 
What the hell kind of a category is "unconventional acts"? Who gets to define 
that? When it comes to sex, government should not be in the business of 
regulating what is moral, normal, decent, or conventional; just what is 
CONSENTING.

London for one reader wasn’t paved with gold

My experience in living in "London" for short periods in Lewisham, Golders 
Green and Selsdon was that most people lived in their own enclave . The idea of 
"living in London" seemed far from the truth. I did have a stepson who gave up 
his job as a supervisor in Tescos in Northants where he could have afforded a 
nice flat to go to London so he could go to the top clubs like Ministry of 
Sound. For that he lived in a room no bigger than a coffin. he had to put his 
bedside table on the bed to open or close the door. how many in London like him?

Fabric makes a comeback, but what does it mean for London nightlife?

Will Coldwell

In September, Fabric had its licence revoked following the deaths of two 
18-year-olds who took ecstasy while at the venue. Three months later, after an 
impressive campaign from the nightlife community, theclub is set to reopen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/21/fabric-nightclub-to-reopen-under-strict-new-licensing-conditions>
.


Fabric nightclub to reopen under strict new licensing conditions
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/21/fabric-nightclub-to-reopen-under-strict-new-licensing-conditions>
A deal was struck between Fabric, the Met and Islington council. It’s not 
plain sailing though;Fabric <https://www.theguardian.com/music/fabric> has 
agreed to 32 conditions that include new ID scanning systems, enhanced 
searching, covert surveillance within the club, lifetime bans for anyone found 
in possession of drugs and no entry for anyone under 19. The licensing 
conditions are evidence that the council and police still prioritise a 
“zero-tolerance” approach to drugs in clubs (which, let’s be honest, is 
probably impossible to ever achieve) over anything else, such as pragmatically 
improving the safety of those inside.

Whether clubbers will care to enter a venue that has to enforce a draconian 
level of security simply to listen to music and dance will be the biggest worry 
for Fabric’s management.


On a more positive note, London (and the UK’s) nightlife community has never 
seemed more focused and active; Fabric’s closure provoked real action. But 
while the club may be set to reopen, do you feel that London’s nightlife has 
been saved?

Readers on the UK 'northern braindrain' – is London the only way?

Guardian readers

Leaving the north of England for London is, for some, the only way to find 
work – that is according to a new study that says there is a “brain drain” from 
the north, with310,000 graduates moving south in the last decade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/nov/19/brain-drain-southward-310000-graduates-left-north-ten-years>

Readers shared their experiences above the line in this article commissioned 
to further tell the story

‘London’s great for the weekend, up north is better for an asthmatic’

Lived in London (well, one of the suburbs at the end of the Met line) most of 
my life. Loved the city, the food, the nightlife, the culture etc.

Moved up north, miss the things that make London great. Don't miss the 
traffic, the pollution, the crush of people on the tube. Love the walks in the 
countryside up here, love the accent.

London's great for the weekend, up north is better for a middle aged wheezing 
asthmatic with an energetic hound.

‘Organizations need to get their HQs out of London’

Organizations need to get their HQs OUT of London. All those charities REALLY 
don't need to be there. They can have a small media/advocacy office that they 
share with other orgs and move the entire rest of their staff somewhere 
cheaper. In the meantime they are wasting their supporters' money on London 
wages and rents, and doing nothing to support a better economic balance in this 
country. Drives me crazy.

I'd love to move back to Manchester. The reminder that our mayor is a former 
"Mr Gay UK" just made me well up with pride. An affordable, liberal city with 
character. Problem is - I've looked for jobs in my specialist field ever since 
I graduated, and haven't seen a thing. Stuck down here in my overpriced 5 
person house share in the south.

The Guardian can help the North and save itself financially by moving back 
north. With modern communication technlogy there is no good reason to be in 
London. Sell the Guardian London building and rent inexpensive offices up north.

Surely the survival of the Manchester Guardian is more important than the 
desire of Guardian writers to live in London?

And one more – presumably from the West Midlands?

the other week there was a piece about the number of Londoners moving out to 
Birmingham. It wasn't labelled a brain drain though, so presumably they were 
all thicko's going in that direction;)

What do you think – have you made the move? Would you? If you aren’t from the 
UK, have you noticed a similar debate about so-called “brain drain” to or from 
the capital?

Is there no such thing as bad publicity for Trump?

During the election campaign, because of the huge animosity to Hillary (and 
Obama) it was probably true that all publicity was good publicity for Trump. 
That's not going to be the case once he takes office. Unfortunately I think he 
knows it, and already he is moderating his tone and output.

There is no such thing as bad publicity in many ways... look at all the sleb 
careers built on it... Trump obviously thinks being Prez is a bit like being a 
Kardashian or Paris Hilton...

A couple of your comments on Trump vs the media, now:

Whatever he's selling, the media are buying.

Corruption within the Trump foundation? Nah, let's report on Pence getting 
booed at Hamilton instead, because, you know, clicks.

Trump's long history of corruption and dodgy dealing? Nah, let's report 
disproportionately on Hillary's non-scandal and treat Trump like a joke.

The media did as much as anybody to elect Trump during this election.

Until people who voted remain at least try to acknowledge that some of the 
British population may have a valid reason for voting to leave the EU, we're 
never going to get back to more progressive politics

With regard to this quoted passage above the line, it mirrors similar claims 
made about many of those who voted Brexit or Trump. The thing is that I still 
haven't heard an explanation of those reasons that makes sense beyond the 
obvious ones.

Seeking to excuse or explain away the fact that millions of people have used 
their democratic choices in what by all ordinary measures are illogical and 
inexplicable ways may simply be ignoring a plain truth that those people 
decided that giving vent to their racism and xenophobia was worth the 
economic/social risk.

Trump vs the 'mainstream media': is fairness and truth at risk?

Ed Pilkington

The headline on my piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/22/election-2016-donald-trump-media-coverage>
 on the relationship between Donald Trump and the “mainstream media” 
crystalised everything I had been trying to say.


Trump v the media: did his tactics mortally wound the fourth estate?
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/22/election-2016-donald-trump-media-coverage>
Overnight, the president-elect had released a two-minute video 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xX_KaStFT8> direct to camera on YouTube 
setting out his plans for his first 100 days. It was classic Trump – using the 
power of social media to bypass TV news and press outlets entirely and speak 
directly to the American people. What he’s doing is to cut out the role of the 
media as a filter that stands between a president and the public, and by doing 
so he is raising a serious threat to many of the values that media outlets hold 
dear: truth, fact and fairness to name but three.

Regarding Trump, I think his entire philosophy is based on the old saw "There 
is no such thing as bad publicity."


He does not mind upsetting people, in fact by this point he seems to be doing 
it deliberately. Because when everyone's talking about the latest thing he came 
out with, or the latest group he offended,they are still talking about Donald 
Trump.

How the election of Trump can kick off a new global feminist movement

Anna Leach

A view from Anna Leach, who works on the Guardian’s Global Development 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development> network. 


After the shocking (and some might say foolish) results of election this year 
in the US and UK, can developed nations continue to take a superior view over

Electing a self-evident misogynist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/donald-trump-rolled-back-gains-american-women-torrent-misogyny>
 as leader of the “free” world shows that sexism is alive and well all over. 
And although the contexts are different, we can find strength from working 
together.

Is Trump's tweeting part of a dead cat strategy. Do you mean the one he wears 
on his head?

I think that trumps mo is pretty clear now: make any process appear as chaotic 
as possible and leak names that are wildly inappropriate then when the picks 
are merely terrible people will think it's not as bad as it could of been.

We saw it play out constantly in the campaign but most clearly in the debates 
where objectively trump performed awfully but the expectations were so low that 
it was considered a win for him to even turn up.

Government on those terms will wear thin very quickly

I like the dead cat analogy. Perhaps that was why people voted for him... to 
hide something even more sinister.

Until people who voted remain at least try to acknowledge that some of the 
British population may have a valid reason for voting to leave the EU, we're 
never going to get back to more progressive politics. The people who may have 
voted Labour in the past, and therefore, the ones who offer the number of votes 
you need, feel that globalisation has not worked for them or their communities. 
Now, either try to understand this and move forward, and be ready for when the 
opportunity - inevitably - arises, or you can just carry on blaming Brexit for 
everything, calling people stupid rascists and never regain political power. 
"It's simple, stupid."

I think because the level of debate before the referendum was so poor and full 
of lies and emotion, that people have been left quite bitter. We didn't even 
come closer to the question "Would Britain be better off outside the EU?" We 
had a vote on it but our understanding is no better than a year a go.

Is Donald Trump's tweeting part of a dead cat strategy?

Martin Belam

I feel like every day I am waking up, and finding myself working out how I am 
going to explain to people in our morning@GuardianNews 
<https://twitter.com/guardiannews> round-up what Donald Trump was tweeting 
about last night.
Guardian news (@guardiannews) 
2️⃣ We regret to inform you that the president-elect of the US has been 
tweeting againhttps://t.co/LsxUfLwojl <https://t.co/LsxUfLwojl> 
pic.twitter.com/trdT6sdqWh <https://t.co/trdT6sdqWh>
 <https://twitter.com/guardiannews/status/800972767814418432> November 22, 2016
 <https://twitter.com/guardiannews/status/800972767814418432> 
It seems completely unprecedented to have the president-elect of the US 
telling us thatthe cast of a play have been rude to his VP-to-be 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/800298286204723200>, or that the 
New York Times is failing 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/798861300453539840>, or that he’s 
thinking about appointingthis person 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/801110690387857408> or that person 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/800332639844659201> to a role.

It also gives us a question as journalists. Does he do it as part of a “dead 
cat strategy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/20/lynton-crosby-and-dead-cat-won-election-conservatives-labour-intellectually-lazy>
” - where you throw a dead cat on the table to distract from something else?

Are we too quick to blame Brexit for everything

It may be true that reasoned and nuance discussions are few and far between 
these days, and that people will lash out at a target that best suits whatever 
opinions they already hold. I think there's been a surge of this kind of 
reciprocal shouting because of the recent furore and hyperbole around the 
referendum campaign, which politicised a large group of people who previously 
had little interest in the system. In other words I blame Brexit.

"Are we too quick to blame Brexit for everything?"

"We"? 

Five months on, there's no evidence of great popular opposition to leaving the 
EU. The Lib Dems are the only major party in Eng and Wales opposing Brexit and 
their poll ratings are stuck in single figures.

It seems to me that Cameron, Osborne, May et al are to blame. There was no 
need for a referendum. It was reckless, it was political vanity, it was 
irresponsible and without a contingency plan they are negligent. And Labour are 
to blame for (still) not providing a credible opposition and alternative 
narrative. Brexit voters are to blame for being gullible and fantasists.

Are we too quick to blame Brexit for everything?

Yes. In fairness it's not a new trend - newspapers are always keen to blame 
long term economic trends on the most recent event.

The same bad news stories which are currently all being blamed on Brexit, 
would have all been blamed on Conservative government policies before the 
referendum, and before 2010 they would have all been blamed on the global 
financial crisis. Simple narratives are seductive, but usually wrong.

An astonishing autumn statement

Anne Perkins

The autumn statement was astonishing. Nothing for the so-called Jams, the 
families who are just managing. And, maybe even more shocking, nothing at all 
for the NHS or, more specifically, for councils so they can afford to provide 
social care for older and vulnerable people –even though it is the biggest 
single cause of the NHS crisis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-nhs-cash-crisis-social-care-comes-first>
.


Eight charts to help you understand the autumn statement
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/24/charts-autumn-statement-obr-spending-deficit-gdp>
But just when it seemed things couldn’t be worse, along came the Institute for 
Fiscal Studies’analysis of what the numbers mean for real people. The single 
most striking conclusion was that by 2021 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/ifs-warnsf-biggest-squeeze-on-pay-for-70-years-autumn-statement>
, for most families pay would only just be back at pre-2008 levels.

Meanwhile the same crew that rubbished the judges for doing their job of 
adjudicating on a legal row – also known as judging – was back on the airwaves 
yesterday heaping scorn on the IFS for doing its job of studying budgets and 
mapping their consequences. There are some senior politicians who are beginning 
to sound like the Tories’ Breitbart wing.

Or do you think they have a point? Are those of us who voted remain too quick 
to blame Brexit for everything (after all, the other EU economies are not 
exactly booming)? And is it legitimate for the 48% to keep fighting for what we 
believe in, or does there come a point when we have to get on and live with it?

If you ever feel like you're have the joy of being alive suffocated out of you 
by nihilistic journalism and opinion pieces, one thing that's worth hanging on 
to: I've met a lot of middle class liberal Guardian reading types recently, 
they're alright if you know how to take them, can be a bit weird and intense 
about some things, but they are not that much different from everyone else. My 
advice , if you're coming home from work and you spot a MCLG-type, give them a 
random hug. It doesn't matter how sweaty or work-dirty you are, just do it!

Thanks Norman.

This sort of censorship has no place in a free and open society.

Adults should be free to consume whatever material they want, regardless of 
how distasteful others may find it, provided all subjects involved are 
performing with consent.

The only thing more astonishing than the fact this ban is happening at all, is 
the fact it appears the people enforcing it think it'll be possible to enforce.

Right so it's now illegal to show female ejaculation which in itself is not 
only legal but perfectly natural. But films can still show terrorism, violence, 
drug use and murder.

Or how about sports like UFC, it's not really conventional to beat someone 
until they pass out.

It's completely illogical, and furthermore who was even pushing for this to 
happen ?

What the hell kind of a category is "unconventional acts"? Who gets to define 
that? When it comes to sex, government should not be in the business of 
regulating what is moral, normal, decent, or conventional; just what is 
CONSENTING.

London for one reader wasn’t paved with gold

My experience in living in "London" for short periods in Lewisham, Golders 
Green and Selsdon was that most people lived in their own enclave . The idea of 
"living in London" seemed far from the truth. I did have a stepson who gave up 
his job as a supervisor in Tescos in Northants where he could have afforded a 
nice flat to go to London so he could go to the top clubs like Ministry of 
Sound. For that he lived in a room no bigger than a coffin. he had to put his 
bedside table on the bed to open or close the door. how many in London like him?
 
In September, Fabric had its licence revoked following the deaths of two 
18-year-olds who took ecstasy while at the venue. Three months later, after an 
impressive campaign from the nightlife community, theclub is set to reopen

A deal was struck between Fabric, the Met and Islington council. It’s not 
plain sailing though;Fabric <https://www.theguardian.com/music/fabric> has 
agreed to 32 conditions that include new ID scanning systems, enhanced 
searching, covert surveillance within the club, lifetime bans for anyone found 
in possession of drugs and no entry for anyone under 19. The licensing 
conditions are evidence that the council and police still prioritise a 
“zero-tolerance” approach to drugs in clubs (which, let’s be honest, is 
probably impossible to ever achieve) over anything else, such as pragmatically 
improving the safety of those inside.

Whether clubbers will care to enter a venue that has to enforce a draconian 
level of security simply to listen to music and dance will be the biggest worry 
for Fabric’s management.


On a more positive note, London (and the UK’s) nightlife community has never 
seemed more focused and active; Fabric’s closure provoked real action. But 
while the club may be set to reopen, do you feel that London’s nightlife has 
been saved?
 
Leaving the north of England for London is, for some, the only way to find

the north, with310,000 graduates moving south in the last decade

Lived in London (well, one of the suburbs at the end of the Met line) most of 
my life. Loved the city, the food, the nightlife, the culture etc.

Moved up north, miss the things that make London great. Don't miss the 
traffic, the pollution, the crush of people on the tube. Love the walks in the 
countryside up here, love the accent.

London's great for the weekend, up north is better for a middle aged wheezing 
asthmatic with an energetic hound.

Organizations need to get their HQs OUT of London. All those charities REALLY 
don't need to be there. They can have a small media/advocacy office that they 
share with other orgs and move the entire rest of their staff somewhere 
cheaper. In the meantime they are wasting their supporters' money on London 
wages and rents, and doing nothing to support a better economic balance in this 
country. Drives me crazy.

I'd love to move back to Manchester. The reminder that our mayor is a former 
"Mr Gay UK" just made me well up with pride. An affordable, liberal city with 
character. Problem is - I've looked for jobs in my specialist field ever since 
I graduated, and haven't seen a thing. Stuck down here in my overpriced 5 
person house share in the south.

The Guardian can help the North and save itself financially by moving back 
north. With modern communication technlogy there is no good reason to be in 
London. Sell the Guardian London building and rent inexpensive offices up north.

Surely the survival of the Manchester Guardian is more important than the 
desire of Guardian writers to live in London?

And one more – presumably from the West Midlands?

the other week there was a piece about the number of Londoners moving out to 
Birmingham. It wasn't labelled a brain drain though, so presumably they were 
all thicko's going in that direction;)

What do you think – have you made the move? Would you? If you aren’t from the 
UK, have you noticed a similar debate about so-called “brain drain” to or from 
the capital?

Is there no such thing as bad publicity for Trump?

During the election campaign, because of the huge animosity to Hillary (and 
Obama) it was probably true that all publicity was good publicity for Trump. 
That's not going to be the case once he takes office. Unfortunately I think he 
knows it, and already he is moderating his tone and output.

There is no such thing as bad publicity in many ways... look at all the sleb 
careers built on it... Trump obviously thinks being Prez is a bit like being a 
Kardashian or Paris Hilton...

Whatever he's selling, the media are buying.

Corruption within the Trump foundation? Nah, let's report on Pence getting 
booed at Hamilton instead, because, you know, clicks.

Trump's long history of corruption and dodgy dealing? Nah, let's report 
disproportionately on Hillary's non-scandal and treat Trump like a joke.

The media did as much as anybody to elect Trump during this election.

Until people who voted remain at least try to acknowledge that some of the 
British population may have a valid reason for voting to leave the EU, we're 
never going to get back to more progressive politics

With regard to this quoted passage above the line, it mirrors similar claims 
made about many of those who voted Brexit or Trump. The thing is that I still 
haven't heard an explanation of those reasons that makes sense beyond the 
obvious ones.

Seeking to excuse or explain away the fact that millions of people have used 
their democratic choices in what by all ordinary measures are illogical and 
inexplicable ways may simply be ignoring a plain truth that those people 
decided that giving vent to their racism and xenophobia was worth the 
economic/social risk.

Overnight, the president-elect had released a two-minute video 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xX_KaStFT8> direct to camera on YouTube 
setting out his plans for his first 100 days. It was classic Trump – using the 
power of social media to bypass TV news and press outlets entirely and speak 
directly to the American people. What he’s doing is to cut out the role of the 
media as a filter that stands between a president and the public, and by doing 
so he is raising a serious threat to many of the values that media outlets hold 
dear: truth, fact and fairness to name but three.

Regarding Trump, I think his entire philosophy is based on the old saw "There 
is no such thing as bad publicity."


He does not mind upsetting people, in fact by this point he seems to be doing 
it deliberately. Because when everyone's talking about the latest thing he came 
out with, or the latest group he offended,they are still talking about Donald 
Trump.
 
A view from Anna Leach, who works on the Guardian’s Global Development 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development> network. 


After the shocking (and some might say foolish) results of election this year 
in the US and UK, can developed nations continue to take a superior view over 
the political injustices of the world?

Electing a self-evident misogynist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/donald-trump-rolled-back-gains-american-women-torrent-misogyny>

And although the contexts are different, we can find strength from working 
together.

I think that trumps mo is pretty clear now: make any process appear as chaotic 
as possible and leak names that are wildly inappropriate then when the picks 
are merely terrible people will think it's not as bad as it could of been.

We saw it play out constantly in the campaign but most clearly in the debates 
where objectively trump performed awfully but the expectations were so low that 
it was considered a win for him to even turn up.

Government on those terms will wear thin very quickly

Until people who voted remain at least try to acknowledge that some of the 
British population may have a valid reason for voting to leave the EU, we're 
never going to get back to more progressive politics. The people who may have 
voted Labour in the past, and therefore, the ones who offer the number of votes 
you need, feel that globalisation has not worked for them or their communities. 
Now, either try to understand this and move forward, and be ready for when the 
opportunity - inevitably - arises, or you can just carry on blaming Brexit for 
everything, calling people stupid rascists and never regain political power. 
"It's simple, stupid."

I think because the level of debate before the referendum was so poor and full 
of lies and emotion, that people have been left quite bitter. We didn't even 
come closer to the question "Would Britain be better off outside the EU?" We 
had a vote on it but our understanding is no better than a year a go.

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/25/britain-not-ready-trigger-article-50-april-brexit-malta-pm>
) any time soon – and, in line with that picture of former prime minister David 
Cameron, the most commented piece on the Guardian today is this on John Major’s 
recent comments:

Are we too quick to blame Brexit for everything

It may be true that reasoned and nuance discussions are few and far between 
these days, and that people will lash out at a target that best suits whatever 
opinions they already hold. I think there's been a surge of this kind of 
reciprocal shouting because of the recent furore and hyperbole around the 
referendum campaign, which politicised a large group of people who previously 
had little interest in the system. In other words I blame Brexit.

"Are we too quick to blame Brexit for everything?"

"We"? 

Five months on, there's no evidence of great popular opposition to leaving the 
EU. The Lib Dems are the only major party in Eng and Wales opposing Brexit and 
their poll ratings are stuck in single figures.

It seems to me that Cameron, Osborne, May et al are to blame. There was no 
need for a referendum. It was reckless, it was political vanity, it was 
irresponsible and without a contingency plan they are negligent. And Labour are 
to blame for (still) not providing a credible opposition and alternative 
narrative. Brexit voters are to blame for being gullible and fantasists.

Are we too quick to blame Brexit for everything?

Yes. In fairness it's not a new trend - newspapers are always keen to blame 
long term economic trends on the most recent event.

The same bad news stories which are currently all being blamed on Brexit, 
would have all been blamed on Conservative government policies before the 
referendum, and before 2010 they would have all been blamed on the global 
financial crisis. Simple narratives are seductive, but usually wrong.
 
The autumn statement was astonishing. Nothing for the so-called Jams, the 
families who are just managing. And, maybe even more shocking, nothing at all 
for the NHS or, more specifically, for councils so they can afford to provide 
social care for older and vulnerable people –even though it is the biggest 
single cause of the NHS crisis

But just when it seemed things couldn’t be worse, along came the Institute for 
Fiscal Studies’analysis of what the numbers mean for real people. The single 
most striking conclusion was that by 2021 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/ifs-warnsf-biggest-squeeze-on-pay-for-70-years-autumn-statement>
, for most families pay would only just be back at pre-2008 levels.

Meanwhile the same crew that rubbished the judges for doing their job of 
adjudicating on a legal row – also known as judging – was back on the airwaves 
yesterday heaping scorn on the IFS for doing its job of studying budgets and 
mapping their consequences. There are some senior politicians who are beginning 
to sound like the Tories’ Breitbart wing.

Or do you think they have a point? Are those of us who voted remain too quick 
to blame Brexit for everything (after all, the other EU economies are not 
exactly booming)? And is it legitimate for the 48% to keep fighting for what we 
believe in, or does there come a point when we have to get on and live with it?
